# A 						CAMPUS IN FULL
## For his new novel, Tom Wolfe visited Stanford to learn about dormcest, frat parties, and basketball stars 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tom Wolfe's latest novel, "I
Am Charlotte Simmons," re
leased earlier this month, was
partly inspired by his research at
Stanford, he said at a promotional
event in Menlo Park on Saturday.
The hefty, 688-page book
traces the eventful and often trau
matic freshman year of its epony
mous heroine, an innocent girl
from the"three stoplight town" of
Sparta, North Carolina, who is
shocked by the binge drinking, ca
sual sex and social elitism running
rampant at the fictional Dupont
University, which is loosely mod
eled on Stanford.
Wolfe, known for his incisive
social commentary, portrays
Dupont as primarily a school for
socialization, where, on its perfect
ly manicured campus, students are
taught the postures of adulthood.
Earning top grades matters far less
than achieving social dominance
with good looks, designer labels,
profanity-laced eloquence and,
most importantly, sexual prowess.
Wolfe, dressed in his trademark
white suit, a Cambridge-blue ox
ford and steel-colored tie, spoke to
the 250 audience members about
the relevance of the book's subject
matter.
"The importance of universi
ties today cannot be underestimat
ed. The changes in moral tone,

changes in ethics, changes in out
looks — they are not coming from
religious institutions; they are now
coming from universities," he said.
Wolfe also elaborated on the
lessons he learned from doing re
search at Stanford in 1999. For ex
ample. he said. "I talked to one of
the residential advisors at Stan
ford and discovered the term
'dormcest.'"
"When I discovered dormcest I
was one of the happiest people in
the world. I said. That's new! No
one else knows about that!"' he
said exuberantly.
Wolfe explained that dormcest
was considered "very lame" at
Stanford: "It's dorky. There's
nothing of lower sex appeal than
that," he said, eliciting hearty
laughter from the crowd.
Communication Prof. Ted
Glasser hosted the author during
his visits to Stanford. Glasser said
the department was "delighted to
have him" and called Wolfe "a
very gracious man." In exchange
for facilitating his research. Wolfe

served as a guest lecturer at vari
ous communication classes and
spoke at the journalism gradua
tion dinner.
Wolfe said his research at Stan
ford was not as difficult as he had
initially feared.
"At first 1 thought it was a stag
gering challenge because I'm 50
years older than the undergradu
ates, but then I realized it was just
a reporting challenge," he said.
He said he decided that the best
way to gain insight on undergradu
ate life "was not to arrive at a col
lege in a white suit and say, 'Here I
am: Tom Wolfe! Let's get it on!"
"So I changed into a blue blaz
er," he quipped.
Nonetheless, the author didn't
exactly blend into the woodwork,
Glasser said.
"When he hung out on campus,
there was no missing him." Glass
er said. "I remember seeing him in
the blazer. He's a meticulous
dresser."

In the novel. Wolfe also notes the
secretive study habits adopted by
image-conscious students. In one
scene, a star basketball player is mor
tified after a teammate claims to have
seen him studying in the library late
at night: "He had just been accused
of not only getting good grades — it
was rumored that his GPA was a 3.5
- but of trying to get them."
In a recent interview with the San
Jose Mercury News, Wolfe made
other observations on Stanford life.
"Even at Stanford, the fraternities
are the social engines of the parties,
just as everywhere else," he said.
However, the majority of the
book's rowdier, alcohol-, vomit- and
drug-filled scenes were not culled
from Stanford's parties, nor was the
subplot about corruption within
Dupont's NCAA Championship
winning basketball team inspired by
the Cardinal's athletic department.
Wolfe said in the same interview.
"There was nothing going wrong
enough to satisfy my mission," he
said of his trips to Stanford. "The
students seemed bright. The athletic
program seemed good and clear, as

far as I know. It was a little too nice."
Glasser said Wolfe seemed to
enjoy himself at Stanford.
"He was here at scattered times
during the year. He loved it," Glass
er said.
Among the other 11 universities
Wolfe visited while researching the
book were Harvard. Princeton, the
University of Florida, the University
of Michigan and the University of
North Carolina-Chapel Hill.
Reviews have been mixed for the
book, which is Wolfe's follow-up to
1998's hugely successful "A Man in
Full." Some critics have called the
book's characters stereotypical and
reductive. Along with the naive title
character, the book features an
anorexic roommate, a callous frat
boy, a morally bankrupt basketball
star, a clique of catty sorority girls and
a geeky student newspaper reporter.
However, freshman Lindsay
Reinsmith thought the central story
line— depicting Charlotte's strug
gle to adapt to life outside a small
town — was a plausible one. Rein
smith hails from The Woodlands,
Tx., a small Houston suburb, which

she described as "predominantly
Christian conservative and very
sheltered."
Reinsmith said many of her high
school classmates rarely ventured
outside city limits, and she. like Char
lotte, was shocked by college life.
"After a lot of my friends left The
Woodlands, they were startled by
the open way other people dealt with
social issues, especially sex, at col
lege," she said. "They didn't really
know how to approach the issue be
cause they were never taught how."
At Saturday's event, Wolfe said
he was "dumfounded" that there
was no significant literature on un
dergraduate culture since the 19605,
a fact that further impelled him to
write "1 am Charlotte Simmons."
Regardless of the novel's recep
tion. Wolfe's status as "one of the
twentieth century's most distin
guished journalists" is unimpeach
able. Glasser said.
"The jury may still be out on his
fiction, but the jury's in on his jour
nalism. He is a groundbreaking fig
ure who helped define the genre of
'new journalism."

Reinsmith said many of her high

"After a lot of my friends left The

Stanford was 'a little too
nice,' in Wolfe's opinion
Tom Wolfe's latest novel, "I
Am Charlotte Simmons," re
leased earlier this month, was
partly inspired by his research at
Stanford, he said at a promotional
event in Menlo Park on Saturday.
The hefty, 688-page book
traces the eventful and often trau
matic freshman year of its epony
mous heroine, an innocent girl
from the"three stoplight town" of
Sparta, North Carolina, who is
shocked by the binge drinking, ca
sual sex and social elitism running
rampant at the fictional Dupont
University, which is loosely mod
eled on Stanford.
Wolfe, known for his incisive
social commentary, portrays
Dupont as primarily a school for
socialization, where, on its perfect
ly manicured campus, students are
taught the postures of adulthood.
Earning top grades matters far less
than achieving social dominance
with good looks, designer labels,
profanity-laced eloquence and,
most importantly, sexual prowess.
Wolfe, dressed in his trademark
white suit, a Cambridge-blue ox
ford and steel-colored tie, spoke to
the 250 audience members about
the relevance of the book's subject
matter.
"The importance of universi
ties today cannot be underestimat
ed. The changes in moral tone,

changes in ethics, changes in out
looks — they are not coming from
religious institutions; they are now
coming from universities," he said.
Wolfe also elaborated on the
lessons he learned from doing re
search at Stanford in 1999. For ex
ample. he said. "I talked to one of
the residential advisors at Stan
ford and discovered the term
'dormcest.'"
"When I discovered dormcest I
was one of the happiest people in
the world. I said. That's new! No
one else knows about that!"' he
said exuberantly.
Wolfe explained that dormcest
was considered "very lame" at
Stanford: "It's dorky. There's
nothing of lower sex appeal than
that," he said, eliciting hearty
laughter from the crowd.
Communication Prof. Ted
Glasser hosted the author during
his visits to Stanford. Glasser said
the department was "delighted to
have him" and called Wolfe "a
very gracious man." In exchange
for facilitating his research. Wolfe

served as a guest lecturer at vari
ous communication classes and
spoke at the journalism gradua
tion dinner.
Wolfe said his research at Stan
ford was not as difficult as he had
initially feared.
"At first 1 thought it was a stag
gering challenge because I'm 50
years older than the undergradu
ates, but then I realized it was just
a reporting challenge," he said.
He said he decided that the best
way to gain insight on undergradu
ate life "was not to arrive at a col
lege in a white suit and say, 'Here I
am: Tom Wolfe! Let's get it on!"
"So I changed into a blue blaz
er," he quipped.
Nonetheless, the author didn't
exactly blend into the woodwork,
Glasser said.
"When he hung out on campus,
there was no missing him." Glass
er said. "I remember seeing him in
the blazer. He's a meticulous
dresser."

In the novel. Wolfe also notes the
secretive study habits adopted by
image-conscious students. In one
scene, a star basketball player is mor
tified after a teammate claims to have
seen him studying in the library late
at night: "He had just been accused
of not only getting good grades — it
was rumored that his GPA was a 3.5
- but of trying to get them."
In a recent interview with the San
Jose Mercury News, Wolfe made
other observations on Stanford life.
"Even at Stanford, the fraternities
are the social engines of the parties,
just as everywhere else," he said.
However, the majority of the
book's rowdier, alcohol-, vomit- and
drug-filled scenes were not culled
from Stanford's parties, nor was the
subplot about corruption within
Dupont's NCAA Championship
winning basketball team inspired by
the Cardinal's athletic department.
Wolfe said in the same interview.
"There was nothing going wrong
enough to satisfy my mission," he
said of his trips to Stanford. "The
students seemed bright. The athletic
program seemed good and clear, as

far as I know. It was a little too nice."
Glasser said Wolfe seemed to
enjoy himself at Stanford.
"He was here at scattered times
during the year. He loved it," Glass
er said.
Among the other 11 universities
Wolfe visited while researching the
book were Harvard. Princeton, the
University of Florida, the University
of Michigan and the University of
North Carolina-Chapel Hill.
Reviews have been mixed for the
book, which is Wolfe's follow-up to
1998's hugely successful "A Man in
Full." Some critics have called the
book's characters stereotypical and
reductive. Along with the naive title
character, the book features an
anorexic roommate, a callous frat
boy, a morally bankrupt basketball
star, a clique of catty sorority girls and
a geeky student newspaper reporter.
