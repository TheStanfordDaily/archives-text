						CAMPUS IN FULL
## For his new novel, Tom Wolfe visited Stanford to learn about dormcest, frat parties, and basketball stars 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tom Wolfe's latest novel, "I
Am Charlotte Simmons," re
leased earlier this month, was
partly inspired by his research at
Stanford, he said at a promotional
event in Menlo Park on Saturday.
The hefty, 688-page book
traces the eventful and often trau
matic freshman year of its epony
mous heroine, an innocent girl
from the"three stoplight town" of
Sparta, North Carolina, who is
shocked by the binge drinking, ca
sual sex and social elitism running
rampant at the fictional Dupont
University, which is loosely mod
eled on Stanford.
Wolfe, known for his incisive
social commentary, portrays
Dupont as primarily a school for
socialization, where, on its perfect
ly manicured campus, students are
taught the postures of adulthood.
Earning top grades matters far less
than achieving social dominance
with good looks, designer labels,
profanity-laced eloquence and,
most importantly, sexual prowess.
Wolfe, dressed in his trademark
white suit, a Cambridge-blue ox
ford and steel-colored tie, spoke to
the 250 audience members about
the relevance of the book's subject
matter.
"The importance of universi
ties today cannot be underestimat
ed. The changes in moral tone,

changes in ethics, changes in out
looks â€” they are not coming from
religious institutions; they are now
coming from universities," he said.
Wolfe also elaborated on the
lessons he learned from doing re
search at Stanford in 1999. For ex
ample. he said. "I talked to one of
the residential advisors at Stan
ford and discovered the term
'dormcest.'"
"When I discovered dormcest I
was one of the happiest people in
the world. I said. That's new! No
one else knows about that!"' he
said exuberantly.
Wolfe explained that dormcest
was considered "very lame" at
Stanford: "It's dorky. There's
nothing of lower sex appeal than
that," he said, eliciting hearty
laughter from the crowd.
Communication Prof. Ted
Glasser hosted the author during
his visits to Stanford. Glasser said
the department was "delighted to
have him" and called Wolfe "a
very gracious man." In exchange
for facilitating his research. Wolfe

served as a guest lecturer at vari
ous communication classes and
spoke at the journalism gradua
tion dinner.
Wolfe said his research at Stan
ford was not as difficult as he had
initially feared.
"At first 1 thought it was a stag
gering challenge because I'm 50
years older than the undergradu
ates, but then I realized it was just
a reporting challenge," he said.
He said he decided that the best
way to gain insight on undergradu
ate life "was not to arrive at a col
lege in a white suit and say, 'Here I
am: Tom Wolfe! Let's get it on!"
"So I changed into a blue blaz
er," he quipped.
Nonetheless, the author didn't
exactly blend into the woodwork,
Glasser said.
"When he hung out on campus,
there was no missing him." Glass
er said. "I remember seeing him in
the blazer. He's a meticulous
dresser."
