### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In their final home game of the 2004
season. No. 7 Stanford matched up with
No. 25 Santa Clara at Burnham Pavilion
last night. Stanford continued its winning
ways, easily dispatching the Broncos in
three games, 30-14, 30-19, and 30-23.
The Cardinal (21-6, 13-3 Pacific-10
Conference), ranked their highest since
an early season loss to St. Mary's, came in
fresh off a sweep of the Washington
schools. Santa Clara (18-7, 9-5 West
Coast Conference) heat Pepperdine be
fore losing to Loyola Marymount over
the weekend.
After a hit of a sleepy start, during
which Santa Clara took a 3-1 lead, the
Cardinal started working and took a 9-4
edge as a Broncos' attack went wide of
the antenna. The onslaught continued, as
Stanford scored 10 of the next 13, seem
ing to almost sleepwalk effortlessly to

victory.
Stanford hit a respectable .333 during
the game, while the Broncos had more
errors than kills, hitting .056.
Freshman setter Bryn Kehoe crashed
into the scorer's table in the opening
points of game two, saving the ball and
giving Stanford a 2-0 lead. The Broncos
battled back and established their first
lead of the match at 6-5. But the charge
for the Broncos was cut short by the Car
dinal, who closed things out on a kill right
down the middle from senior outside hit
ter Ogonna Nnamani, 30-19.
Stanford rushed out to a 6-1 in the
third game, forcing a very early timeout
by the Broncos. It then turned into a
game of runs, as Stanford and Santa
Clara traded groups of points, neither
team really doing anything to the Cardi
nal lead. The Cardinal reached match
point on a service error, 29-22, and put
the game away on a cross-court kill by
