## Cal sucks, but they're doing something right with that team 
### 
1 spent a good chunk of Saturday morning
walking with a friend up Durant Avenue in
Berkeley to get to Big Game. More specif
ically, 1 was walking up to Tightwad Hill, the
Fallujah of anti-Stanford sentiment, where the

prevailing mood was one ot
gleeful certitude. Cal fans
knew from the outset that
there was no way Stanford
could keep up with the
Bears, giving them plenty of
time to come up with new
and creative ways (read:
throwing beer cans) to ex
press their joy. Meanwhile, 1
don't even know what that
feels like, having never been
present fora Big Game win.

Those crying over the fact that the Cardinal
have emerged with the same 4-7 record as in
2003 usually bring up the fact that they lost so
many close games. This isn't the same team,
we've heard. We've been ingrained with the
belief that the difference between this year and
last year is immense. And, to some extent, it is.
The Cardinal lost heartbreakers to very
good USC and Arizona State teams and were
competitive in almost all their games â€” the
exception, of course, being Saturday's 41-6
punishing at the hands of the Bears, the worst
Big Game loss since 1930. This also came when
Cal played its ugliest game of the year. I shud
der to think what would have happened if the
Bears had come out firing on all cylinders.
But of course, we're not even going to ac
knowledge it. We're going to ignore the fact
that our football team hasn't beaten a team
with a winning record in the last three years,
and the fact that we prepared for the rout ev
eryone knew was coming with a combination
of the botched entertainment abortion that is
Gaieties, and an Axe rally without a bonfire,
due to school regulations mandating that no
fire be larger than three feet high. Cal is right;
Stanford does, on a few very important levels,
suck.
But hey, at least we can validate ourselves
with our self-important and devilishly witty
"Accepted / Rejected" cheers, right?

I'm embarrassed that ESPN still
deigns to put Cal-Stanford on its list
of top rivalries. I want to apologize
to Auburn and Oklahoma fans for
being mentioned in the same para
graph as the Iron Bowl and the Red
River Shootout.
I've always been under the im
pression that to make it a "rivalry,"
both sides need to care. The driving
force behind the Stanford-Cal bat
tle exists largely on the other side of
the Bay, mostly because they have
enough sports-smart students to
build a great atmosphere.
If our football team hadn't
picked up the slack by winning Big
Game so often and instilling an un
warranted sense of snotty superior
ity in Stanford students. I can guar
antee that it would be even less of a
rivalry. If Stanford had started los
ing, I'm sure its students would
have abandoned what little atten
tion they gave to football.
But there's a reason for the stu
dents' recent apathy: Stanford IS
the same team as last year. It had
the same record, the same dismal
Big Game outcome and, most glar
ingly, the same coaching staff. This
is a university that can get the very
best athletes, and there is absolute
ly no reason why we should be satis
fied with this outcome.
There are two ways we can solve
this problem. The first option is to
build a student body that is willing
to fervently support a losing foot

hall team. Anyone who went to the
Big Game rally (or, for that matter.
Big Game itself) would agree that,
based on the sports acumen of most
Stanford students, this is numerical
ly impossible.
The second choice, which seems
a lot more reasonable, is to win
more football games.
Saturday highlighted some big
differences between Stanford and
Cal. After losing an unprecedented
seven straight Big Games, instead
of giving up all hope. Cal took ac
tion. They continued to fill up one
of the largest stadiums in college
football, kept supporting what was
at the time one of the worst football
programs in the nation and made a
coaching change.
I don't need to bring up the com
parison between Cal coach Jeff
Tedford and Buddy Teevens again,
since Tedford's resume makes
Teevens look like the Special Ed
department of the Pac-10. Nobody
wants to be impolite by pointing out
the kid that's falling behind, but
deep down, they all know.
I realize that we're a very for
ward-thinking institution, but when
1 think "progress," I think "increase
in wins." After climbing up from
"wincingly awful" in 2002 to "sub
par" in 2(X)3, the Cardinal football
program has failed to take another
step forward.
Stanford football is at a turning
point because it simply doesn't have

a large or fervent enough support
base to keep up hope in a bad pro
gram. The coaching staff needs to
be replaced, and quickly.
Yes, the Cardinal lost a lot of
close games. You know what wins
close games? Coaching. The Yan
kees win almost every one-run
game they're in because Joe Torre
squeezes runs out of his team, not
because Bernie Williams gets hits
at the right time. Stanford's re
peated failure to capitalize on op
portunities is damning this pro
gram to mediocrity.
I've seen this movie before, and
I'm not going to sit through it a third
time. 1 don't want Ted Leland to ac
cept a program that can't win close
games and has gotten flat-out em
barrassed three times in the only
games that have meant anything to
the school since 2001.
I feel bad for the fans, but I feel
worse for the players, because
they're the ones that have to put
their hearts into something that the
rest of us refuse to believe in. When
the personal-foul flags started com
ing out in the fourth quarter Satur
day, 1 knew where that frustration
was coming from.
So give us something to support,
Ted. We've given Cal the Axe for
three years now. Give it to someone
else fora change.
