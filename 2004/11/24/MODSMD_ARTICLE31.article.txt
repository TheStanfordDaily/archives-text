## Cal sucks, but they're doing something right with that team 
### 
1 spent a good chunk of Saturday morning
walking with a friend up Durant Avenue in
Berkeley to get to Big Game. More specif
ically, 1 was walking up to Tightwad Hill, the
Fallujah of anti-Stanford sentiment, where the

prevailing mood was one ot
gleeful certitude. Cal fans
knew from the outset that
there was no way Stanford
could keep up with the
Bears, giving them plenty of
time to come up with new
and creative ways (read:
throwing beer cans) to ex
press their joy. Meanwhile, 1
don't even know what that
feels like, having never been
present fora Big Game win.

Those crying over the fact that the Cardinal
have emerged with the same 4-7 record as in
2003 usually bring up the fact that they lost so
many close games. This isn't the same team,
we've heard. We've been ingrained with the
belief that the difference between this year and
last year is immense. And, to some extent, it is.
The Cardinal lost heartbreakers to very
good USC and Arizona State teams and were
competitive in almost all their games â€” the
exception, of course, being Saturday's 41-6
punishing at the hands of the Bears, the worst
Big Game loss since 1930. This also came when
Cal played its ugliest game of the year. I shud
der to think what would have happened if the
Bears had come out firing on all cylinders.
But of course, we're not even going to ac
knowledge it. We're going to ignore the fact
that our football team hasn't beaten a team
with a winning record in the last three years,
and the fact that we prepared for the rout ev
eryone knew was coming with a combination
of the botched entertainment abortion that is
Gaieties, and an Axe rally without a bonfire,
due to school regulations mandating that no
fire be larger than three feet high. Cal is right;
Stanford does, on a few very important levels,
suck.
But hey, at least we can validate ourselves
with our self-important and devilishly witty
"Accepted / Rejected" cheers, right?
