# Special fees groups must provide outreach plans
## 
### NICK PARKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The discussion at last night's
meeting of the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate focused on a bill that
would force student groups request
ing ASSU special fees to put their
plans for outreach into writing.
In addition, senators voted unan
imously to make sophomore Troy
Steinmetz the new ASSU Elections
Commissioner.
The proposed outreach bill
would require any student group re
questing special fees from the ASSU
to provide the Senate with a written
outline detailing its outreach plans.
These plans would include the meth
ods used to advertise the groups'
events and recruit new members,
such as e-mail lists and fliers.
While some senators believed the
proposed bill was redundant be
cause student groups requesting spe

cial fees are already asked about out
reach plans in their interviews with
the ASSU, others felt the hill would
provide additional incentive for
groups to reach out to students.
"Basically this bill simply tries to
get people thinking a little harder
about outreach." said Senate Chair
Chris Lin. a senior.
One of the co-authors of the bill.
Senate Appropriations Chair Dan
Stringer, a junior, defended its pur
pose.
"The point of outreach is to veri
fy that there is a solid plan in place to
make sure that students are aware of
the group," Stringer said.
When asked what the bill would
accomplish. Stringer explained that
it would urge student groups to pub
licize themselves more than they
currently do.

tions committee supporting this plan
will encourage groups to advertise
their events more," he said.
The other co-author of the hill.
Senate Administration and Rules
Chair Chris Nguyen, a sophomore,
informed the Senate of the repercus
sions a student group would face if it
failed to comply with its outreach
plan.
"If a group applies for special fees
another year, the Senate will look
back and make sure the group stuck
to their outreach plan the previous
year when considering whether or
not to grant fees to that group."
Nguyen said.

The Senate tabled the hill and
will vote on it at next week's meet
ing.
After the Senate approved him as
Elections Commissioner, Steinmetz
told The Daily that he would create
an elections reform committee,
which would attempt to fix the prob
lems surrounding last year's ASSU
elections.
"The elections reform commit
tee's job is to uphold the credibility
of the elections," Steinmetz said.
"Given the problems with last year's
elections, we're obviously going to
have to tinker with a few things."
"We're going to reform some of

the existing problems in the elec
tions process, communicate those
changes, get people involved in the
elections, and make sure the elec
tions run smoothly," Steinmetz con
tinued.
He went on to say that the elec
tions reform committee would
spend the time from now until this
year's elections "making sure that
everything is set and that the elec
tions run smoothly."
The Graduate Student Council
must approve Steinmetz at its meet
ing next week before his appoint
ment to the position is official.
