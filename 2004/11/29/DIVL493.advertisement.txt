Under One Sky
by Margo Davis
Wednesday, December 1, 2004 • 6:30 PM
Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
Margo Davis spent almost 40 years creating the body of work for Under One Sky. During this time she traveled to
every inhabited continent and photographed people from all walks of life. Each photograph in this series reveals
Davis' extraordinary talent in connecting with her subjects as well as the technical expertise and finely tuned
clarity which years of experience brings to her work. Margo Davis studied with such seminal California
photographers as Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham, and Ruth Bernhard and her work continues on in their
classic California tradition of black and white photography. A genuine warmth of spirit permeates each of Margo
Davis' photographs, accentuated by the rich tonalities and high level of craftsmanship evident in the printing.
Above all, Under One Sky brings a welcome visual message of peace and unity to a time heavily laden with images
of international turmoil and unrest. The accompanying book contains 60 masterfully printed photographs from
the series and an introductory essay by local art historian and photographic scholar Greta Mitchell.

"Hilton Obenzinger is an American original. His lost histories are acts of legerdemain and cunning - mixing truth
and imagination in ways rarely seen before." - Paul Auster. A young boy wakes one morning to discover he is
sinking into the earth despite the new sneakers his parents promised would save him. A young woman begins
reviewing films before they are made. A postal worker named Gary fulfills his occupational cliche and attacks
Danny DcVito. A father writes letters to his wayward and far-flung sons. An archeologist finds evidence, perhaps,
of the permanence of time as well as earth. A detective accepts a case requiring him to connect Patty Hearst to her
other self. Though the story in A*HOLE is in continual flux, Obenzinger skillfully braids the multiple narrative
threads into a novel which is much larger than its physical size, lyrically beautiful, and absorbing through and
through. Hilton Obenzinger has created an experimental fiction readers will experience as much as read, in which
he swirls together around the vortex created by the pull of his central hole. Graduating from Columbia in 1969,
he has taught on the Yurok Indian Reservation, operated a community printing press in San Francisco's Mission
District, co-edited a publication devoted to Middle East peace, worked as a commercial writer and instructional
designer. He received his doctorate in the Modern Thought and literature Program at Stanford University in 1997
and currently teaches writing and American literature at Stanford and San Francisco State University.
