Stanford Law Review Needs A
Good Fact Checker
In the November 2004 issue of the Stan/on/I.aw Review,
UCLA law professor Richard 11. Sander argues that affirma
tive action hurts black law students more than it helps them.
Professor Sander's position is that affirmative action pushes
young blacks up into highly selective law schools where they
are likely to fail.
This charge that black students are tailing
at the nation's elite law schools is totally false.
As a prime example, the black student graduation rate at
Stanford Law School, one of the most selective law schools in
the nation, is 97.7 percent. Last year, former dean Kathleen
Sullivan informed JBHE that the one black student who did not
complete the degree program in recent years because of a fam
ily emergency is now back in school. "Our record is, in fact,
pretty much perfect," said Dean Sullivan.
Note, too, that less than a year ago JBHR identified nine very
high ranking law schools Columbia University, Cornell
University, Georgetown University, Northwestern University,
the University of Michigan, the University of Minnesota, the
University of Texas, the University of Virginia, and Washington
University where the black student graduation rate was close
to 100 percent.
Instead of drawing irresponsible and highly damaging conclu
sions about the law school performance of black students,
Professor Sander should check the record.
