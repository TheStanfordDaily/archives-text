# 2004: The Year in News
## Plans underway for new law dorm 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Construction of the $ 100-
million, 600-occupant Munger
Graduate Residences is expect
ed to begin next summer. The
project is being funded by an
unprecedented donation of
$43.5 million from Charles T.
Munger, a prominent lawyer
and businessman whose wife,
Nancy, is a Stanford alumna and
former member of the Board of
Trustees.
The two-year project, which
will occupy six acres of Univer
sity land, will displace buildings
on Salvatierra Walk, potentially
relocating them across from
Bechtel International Center,
and will temporarily create a
giant hole in the ground where
the buildings are currently lo
cated.
The primary buildings tar
geted for relocation are Rogers
House — home of the Bridge
counseling center and other stu
dent activities — and Owen
House, which is currently occu
pied by administrative facilities.
The campus bike store will be
rebuilt elsewhere.
Due to their historic nature,
Rogers and Owen will be
moved to another campus loca
tion rather than destroyed. The

move, and the project's larger
impact on campus life, has some
students and University em
ployees concerned.
"For us to grow as a Univer
sity, we have to provide the
housing," said Chris Christof
ferson, associate vice provost
for facilities. He noted that ac
cording to Stanford's General
Use Plan with Santa Clara
County, the construction of new
academic space must be accom
panied by new housing.
"This is something that the
county wants," he said. "They
don't want students commuting
to campus."
Christofferson estimated
that the University provides
housing for 65 percent of its
graduate students and said that
•the Munger residences will
move Stanford toward its goal
of housing 80 percent.
"At this point, the plans are
preliminary," cautioned Gor
don Earle, vice president for
public affairs. He acknowl
edged that one likely solution

would be relocating houses to near
the Bechtel International Center.
"If the houses are moved across
from Bechtel. we'll try to create a
feeling similar to what exists today at
Salvatierra Walk.
Earle emphasized that the Uni
versity has been working to address
the concerns of community mem
bers who could be impacted.
"Over the last two weeks, we've
been very aggressive about contact
ing everyone affected," he said.
"We've talked to homeowners, resi
dent fellows, resident advisors, any
one living and working in the imme
diate area."
I he Career Development Center
is located on Salvatierra Walk, but is

not expected to move. CDC Direc
tor Lance Choy said he has met with
administrators to discuss a wide
range of issues related to the project,
but he acknowledged that he still
had many concerns.
" The details aren't fully out yet.
but we're wondering how that's
going to impact parking." he said.
"We have employers who come to
recruit here and they need to know
how accessible they're going to be
|when there is construction]."
Choy noted that the Student Dis
ability Resource Center is located
below the CDC. and "there are peo
ple who arc vision-impaired and
they're wondering how the con
struction will affect all that."

Some unhappy with plans
for super-sized law dorm

The new buildings will eliminate
150 existing parking spaces, but, ac
cording to Christofferson, the first
structures built will be underground
parking garages with capacity for
750 cars.
To address traffic concerns.
Campus Drive near Mayfield will
also be expanded from two to four
lanes.

chairman of Berkshire Hathaway
