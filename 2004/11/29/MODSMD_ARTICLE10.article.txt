## Stanford apologizes after Band mocks polygamy at BYU game 
### DAVID HERBERT DESK EDITOR 
Stanlord Athletic Director Ted Leland publicly
apologized and the Stanford Band agreed to impose
sanctions on itself after it performed a halftime show
that mocked Mormonism at a home football game
against Brigham Young University on Sept. 11.
Spokespeople for both the Athletic Department
and the Stanford Band refused to say what the sanc
tions were, though The Daily has learned that they in
clude— and may be limited to — a formal apology
and a one-game suspension for Band announcer Mark
Ruben, a recent Stanford graduate.
The halftime show, whose script was approved by
the Athletic Department, featured several jabs at the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which
sponsors BYU.
Most controversial was a swipe at polygamy in
which the Band's assistant manager, senior Tom Hen
nessy, pretended to marry all five Dollies, who
donned wedding veils for the skit. Ruben spoke
through the public address system about the sacred
bond "between a man and a woman ... and a woman
... and a woman ... and a woman ... and a woman."
The joke was not lost on Brigham Young fans, and
the visiting contingent unleashed a hail of boos.
Two days after the game, Stanford Athletic Direc
tor Ted Leland issued a public apology, explaining in
a written statement, "We are committed to being good
hosts to our opponents who visit Stanford, and any
thing that doesn't reflect this is regrettable."
On Sept. 14. the Band issued its own letter of apol
ogy as well.

Because the Band is known for satirical and some
times controversial field shows, it is required to have
its programs approved by the Athletic Department
before it performs them.
Assistant Director for Marketing Bob Carruesco
said he had reviewed the script prior to the game, but
he said that several jokes were unclear and that the
more offensive jokes caught him off-guard when the
Band performed them
"We were surprised by a couple things," he said.
Carruesco said the Athletic Department didn't feel
the need to impose any punishments on the Band be
cause "they felt they were capable of self-sanction
ing."
Band manager Stella Cousins declined to discuss
the nature of the sanctions, saying that secrecy was
part of the agreement between the Band and the Ath
letic Department.
Junior Chris Holt, a spokesman for the Band,
agreed with Carruesco that parts of the script were
open to interpretation.
"There was a slight ambiguity about a line where
the narrator was supposed to stutter and said "and a
woman, and a woman and a woman'" he said.
However, Holt also noted that the script clearly
read. "Tom marries Dollies."
In Provo, Utah, the incident has largely been for
gotten and was "no big deal," said BYU Football
Media Relations Director Jeff Reynolds.
"Stanford University handled it appropriately," he
said. "The athletics department was completely pro
fessional."
This stary originally appealed in The Caily cn Sqpt. 22.
