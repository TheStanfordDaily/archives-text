# Computer glitch causes headaches as 150 students lose their P.O. Boxes
## 
### GERRY SHIH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Leaning against the counter,
sophomore Preeya Jayakar impa
tiently listened to a Stanford post of
fice employee while twiddling quar
ters with her fingers. She had waited
25 minutes in line, only to be told
now that her P.O. Box had been re
assigned for the second time in two
weeks. She needed yet another new
key, and that would be found in Old
Union.
With a scowl on her face, Jayakar
stomped out of a packed post office
that reeked of frustration.
She wasn't the only one with a
P.O. Box problem, and she wasn't
the only one frustrated.
According to University Regis
trar Roger Printup, about 900 re
turning students were affected by a
glitch in the University computer
system over the summer. The bug
prevented students from renewing
their old P.O. Boxes at the end of last
year. To compound the problem, a
separate computer problem as
signed many returning students to
different boxes and assigned their
old. supposedly unrenewed and
empty boxes to incoming freshmen.
As a result, about 150 returning stu
dents have now had their boxes per
manently reassigned, causing
headaches for those affected.
"We've been trying to get the
mailboxes of returning students
back to them." said Eduardo
Morales, manager of the P.O. Box
rental office. "Incoming freshmen
will have their boxes taken away, but
we understand how important it is
for students who have been here for
three or four years to keep their

boxes, and we're doing everything
we can."
Despite a postal regulation that
prohibits reassignments of P.O.
Boxes, the post office allowed 750 of
the 900 students originally affected
to reclaim their old boxes, according
to Printup. But on Sept. 28, the post
office decided to halt the reassign
ment of mailboxes.
That left 150 students stuck with a
new mailing address. To complicate
the issue, many students have not
been able to retrieve their mail for
weeks, as the post office is holding
some mail in the midst of the chaos.
Many of the 750 students — the
lucky majority — affected by the
mix-up, like junior Allison McCarty,
were only minimally inconve
nienced.
"They changed my lock, so 1 went
down to Old Union and just ex
changed my key," said McCarty.
"They let me keep the same P.O.
Box, so really it was about as much
trouble for them as it was for me."
Other students weren't as fortu
nate. Senior Wenfei Xie is one of the
150 who now has to deal with a per
manent address change, and for her
it will take more than an extra walk
to Old Union to straighten things
out.
Addressing information for cred
it card billings, magazine subscrip
tions, tuition checks and more will
all have to be changed, Xie said.
Plus, she has not received some ex
pected time-sensitive mail for two
weeks.
According to Printup, his office is
working to prevent future mix-ups.
"Everyone here at the Registrar's
Office is dreadfully sorry, and obvi
ously we wish this had not hap

pened," Printup said. "But as for the
future, we will look at the computer
program like it's never been looked
at before and test it like it's never
been tested before."
But for all the trouble many stu
dents have gone through, the apolo
gies and promises made on behalf of
the University are scant consolation.
"1 am disappointed and frustrat
ed," Xie said. At this pointrshe says,
she can only wait and hope.
"It would be nice just to have my
mail."
