# Labor meeting ends with march
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Where is Hennessy?" chanted
students, workers, faculty and com
munity members as they walked out
of last night's standing-room-only
town hall meeting on Stanford's
workplace policies. Upset that Uni
versity President John Hennessy did
not attend the meeting, student ac
tivists led the meeting attendees to
Hennessy's house to voice their con
cerns about improving worker's
rights on campus.
The University organized the
town hall meeting for the public to
give feedback and ask questions
about the Presidential Advisory
Committee's Report on Workplace
Policies, issued this past June.
Hennessy commissioned the
Committee to write the report last
year after students went on a week
long hunger strike to improve labor
conditions for workers on campus.
The committee was charged with
studying temporary and subcon
tracted workers, living wage policies,
employee education opportunities
and unionization procedures.
Meeting attendants held up signs
that read "Nice first step Stanford,
keep on moving" while the Presi
dential Advisory Committee pre
sented its report.
Although relatively satisfied with
the report and its recommendations,
members of the student activist
group Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion expressed concern that the Uni
versity might not act on the commit
tee's findings. They read a statement
asking for the recommendations to
be expanded into a code of conduct
and implemented immediately.
More than 10 student groups
have signed the statement, including
the Asian American Student Associ
ation. the Black Student Union and
the Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice.
"Where is President Hennessy?"
was the first question raised after the
committee presented a summary of
the Report.
"He signed off in good faith to
commission this study after our
hunger strike, and he will ultimately
make the decisions about workplace
policies," said senior Molly Gold
berg, a member of the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition. "So why
isn't he here to listen to our view
points and hear our statement?"

After about an hour-and-a-half
of discussion, Goldberg stated that
the meeting was not productive
without the presence of members of
the University administration. Com
mittee members indicated that they
could not answer questions about
how the University would imple
ment their recommendations.
"I cannot speak for President
Hennessy," said committee co-chair
Economics Prof. John Pencavel.
"But I would be very surprised if he
does not address these issues."
Goldberg then asked Pencavel to
give Hennessy a phone call on the
spot, but Pencavel denied the re
quest, stating that the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition had not
asked for Hennessy's presence when
the group initially planned the meet
ing. At that point, Goldberg made
the decision to march to Hennessy's
house, and all but a handful of peo
ple followed her lead.
"It is these students taking actions
like this that got all these people in a
room together," said Zev Kvitky, an
operations engineer at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center and pres
ident of United Stanford Workers.
He also served on the Presidential
Advisory Committee. "The Univer
sity did not start this study out of
good will; they did it because these
students fasted fora week," he said
as he made his way out the door.
During the meeting, Kvitky
praised the report's recommenda
tions, but also emphasized the limi

tations. The Presidential Advisory
Committee had to work within the
University's existing budget and did
not have access to information about
the University's endowment, he
said.
The report recommends that the
University enforce its parity rule
that temporary workers get paid the
same amount as regular workers
when they do the same jobs. Howev
er, it did not recommend that tem
porary workers receive the same
benefits, like health care, that regu
lar workers receive.
Although the committee did not
unanimously agree on the questions
of parity and a living wage, it did
make firm recommendations on
three other fronts.
First, it suggested that the Uni
versity adopt a clear grievance pro
cedure for temporary and subcon
tracted workers to voice their con
cerns about the workplace.
The committee also recommend
ed a pilot program to analyze what
skills workers need to advance their
careers and what skills workers actu
ally have.
The final recommendation of the
committee was that the University
comply with the intent of the law
rather than the letter of the law when
workers are considering unioniza
tion.
