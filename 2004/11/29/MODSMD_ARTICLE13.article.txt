# RIAA slaps students with lawsuits
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY DESK EDITOR 
The Recording Industry Association of America an
nounced yesterday that it has filed 762 lawsuits against il
legal file sharers around the nation. Thirty-two of them
are members of networks at 26 different universities, in
cluding Stanford.
Unrelated to the actions taken by the music industry,
the University has cracked down on file swapping.
Under Stanford's computer usage policy, several stu
dents have had their SUNet IDs disabled for sharing files
on the school's computer network.
The loss of a SUNet ID can severely hinder a stu
dent's ability to fulfill his or her academic requirements -
such as registering for classes and enrolling in Course-
Work — and using Webmail. The purpose of this proce
dure is to protect the University from liability for copy
right infringement violations.
Yesterday's filing is the second made against a Stan
ford network user. Earlier in 2004, another network user
was alleged to have unlawfully shared or downloaded 11
songs; the individual settled out of court by paying a fine.
The University does not publicly release the names of
those who are sued.

When the RIAA discovered that someone had been
illegally sharing files on the Internet, it notified Stanford
of its intention to file a lawsuit. Between the time when
that complaint was made a few weeks ago and yesterday,
when the lawsuit was filed, Stanford took action of its
own.
"Even before we received any subpoena from the
RIAA, the Legal Office decided that the best way to
handle it was to try to identify the Stanford user as quick
ly as we could, and to give that user appropriate notice,"
said Senior University Counsel Lauren Schoenthaler.
Litigation is one method, under the 1998 Digital Mil
lennium Copyright Act, used by copyright owners to
fight piracy.
Another important tactic is to enforce the Safe Har
bor Provisions of the DMCA, which requires that Stan
ford either terminate copyright infringers from its net
work or be held responsible for files that are illegally
shrred on the network. Often, both options are used in
concert - one targets the network provider and one tar
gets the individual user.

Ihe fuLL-layth versicn of this stcuy appealed in The Caily
