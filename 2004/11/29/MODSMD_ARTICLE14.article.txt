# Wisdom of the stacks: Library vandalism conveys timeless truths
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There are two types of people at Stanford: those
who respect University property and those who willful
ly deface it.
The handiwork of the latter can be found at Green
Library, where graffiti-covered desktops and carrels
distract bored students, luring them to make their
mark.
After conducting an entirely non-scientific hiero
glyphic survey, the following inscriptions seemed to
best represent the student body:
The almost painfully earnest girl
"To this Desk,
Thank you for 4 years of loyalty. May you help future
generations of students the way you helped me. Thank
you and keep it real!
—EMSFATM, Class of 2003"
Two Californians and a New Yorker
"How does one try to prove the existence or non-exis
tence of God w/o human restrictions and prejudices?"

—"One cannot prove' nor disprove God's existence.
But I would suggest that if you have to look around for
something, then it's lost from you. The question then
becomes should you believe or should you not, and if
you have no motivating reason to believe, then you can
quit believing without theory to be proven to you one
way or another."
—"You guys have obviously been to one too many
C.I.V. lectures."
The recently fired outreach director of Stanford
Bridge
"Sometimes I wonder how much the world would
change if I were not in it."
—"NOT MUCH"
The tough hut tender frat guy who never
met a cliche he didn't like
"HELP SAVE ME!"
—"Shit, 1 can't even save myself. So how can I save
vou? Sink or swim dude."

Four guys in the front row of Econ 50 who hitch at
each other while diligently taking notes on graph
paper
"Why do you worship the work ethic?"
—"Why do you?"
—"$ — Have you got an alternative?"
—"Marx did."
—"No he didn't his economic analysis was fundamen
tally flawed, as he admitted."
A roommate who only knows one lyric of the song,
hut compensates by repeating it over and over again
"You better shape up 'cause 1 need a man ... And my
heart is set on you ..."
The kid in your IHUM section
who likes big words
"The key to being a good academic is finding new and
creative generalizations/ characterizations about vari
ous political, social or economic forces. Then you can
write long books about it and be CITED BY OTHERS.

Comments?"
—"What?"
Frustration, the hard line, then aeceptanec
"I hate chem!"
—"Chem hates you."
—"I know."
The whole goddamn sehool
"I need to get laid."
