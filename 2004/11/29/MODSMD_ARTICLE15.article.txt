## Univ. examines grad education 
### JENNY ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The newly formed Commission
on Graduate Education (CGE) is
charged with addressing specific
concerns raised by graduate stu
dents and faculty members, such as
examining immigration laws that af
fect student demographics. Howev
er, the commission's primary chal
lenge will be to maintain a focus on
big-picture issues amidst the great
diversity of graduate programs.
"We have the opportunity to
broaden the graduate curriculum in
a very careful and thoughtful man
ner." said Dean of Research Arthur
Bienenstock, a commission mem
ber. "I believe our graduate students
will take advantage of the opportu
nities that result."
The commission is comprised of
the dean of research, a former chair
of the University Board of Trustees,
graduate students, a staff member,
and faculty representatives from the
seven graduate schools. Charles
Holloway, professor emeritus at the
Graduate School of Business, will
serve as chair. The commission
meets biweekly and plans to create
topic-specific subcommittees.

The commission's work will cul
minate in a report of key findings
and recommendations for the Uni
versity President by June 1,2005.
According to Association Vice
President of Strategic Planning
Roberta Katz, "The commission's
work will include gathering a body
of information about Stanford's ex
isting graduate programs, the ex
pected career paths of the graduate
students, and the graduate experi
ence in general at Stanford. Once
that information is gathered, the
commission will offer recommenda
tions that would allow current pro
grams to change and evolve."
Many faculty members who will
be involved in the commission's
work have cited the success of the
Commission on Undergraduate Ed
ucation (CUE) as a model.
"()ur hope is that the commission
will be at least as successful with re
spect to graduate education as the
CUE: work was with respect to un
dergraduate education." Katz said.
Members of the CGE and others
have already recognized areas of im
provement for graduate education.
Graduate Student Council Chair
Moriah Thomason, who is the sole
graduate student on the commission,

said that she would focus her efforts
on expanding and restructuring edu
cational programs to better suit the
wide range of graduate student
needs.
"Changes should be considerate
of not only excellence in academic
enterprise, but also the quality of life
for graduate students while they are
here," she said. "Students will thrive
when they are happy, healthy and
enriched in their day to day lives.
Stanford has an opportunity in this
commission to address scholarship
and life, both in and outside of the
classroom."
CGE Co-C hair Mark I lorowitz, a
professor at the School of Engineer
ing, said the University needs more
interdisciplinary classroom opportu
nities and research efforts along the
lines of the BioX program and the
Institute for the Environment.
"One unique feature of Stanford
is that it has top departments in all
areas that are co-located on a single
campus." Horowitz said. "Thus we
should he able to leverage the diver
sity of excellence to improve all
graduate programs."
