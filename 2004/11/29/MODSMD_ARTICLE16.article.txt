# ASSU posts names of special-fees refund applicants on its Web site
## 
### SARAH LUSTBADER DESK EDITOR 
For the first time, the ASSU has
posted online the names of students
requesting refunds on their special
fees. This decision has made public
the names and SUID numbers of in
dividuals who have joined the ever
growing ranks of those who choose
to withhold at least some of their
money from student groups and or
ganizations.
The decision to make these lists
available to the Stanford community
has been called into question be
cause some claim it violates the pri
vacy of the students as well as the
student groups.
The ASSII has always distributed
this information to the financial
managers of student groups, accord
ing to then-ASSU Vice President
Joey Natoli, a junior at the time. He
said that the information was made
available online this year for the sake
of convenience and efficiency.
Natoli claimed that student groups
are not obligated to provide services

to students who request refunds.
While these lists have never been
as easily accessible to the public as
they are now, they have never been
confidential, Natoli added.
"We are constitutionally mandat
ed to release any data that is not pro
prietary," he said. "By law. (the data
is | not protected by privacy rights."
Then-CEO of Stanford Student
Enterprises Kyle Alisharan stressed
that the ASSU did not intend to
deter students from requesting re
funds by making the information
readily available.
Then-ASSU President Nadiya
Figueroa.a senior, said that she would
rather the names be kept private.
"It's problematic either way because
students forward the information,
even by word-of-mouth." she said.
The real issue, according to Al
isharan. is eliminating free riders -
students who vote for special fees in
the spring and then ask for refunds.
"People are requesting refunds
from groups they work for,"he said.
"The refund system for the ASSU
lives and dies on the honor code."

Still, many students feel uncom
fortable with the new policy.
"They could accomplish the same
task without publishing it online and
violating privacy," said then-fresh
man Ali Batouli.
Then-Junior Gabriel Martinez
also preferred the old method of dis
tributing names to the new one.
"It seems rational for lists to be
sent out to the groups, but not for
public consumption." Martinez said.
"That's extortion."
Another concern has been the in
tegrity of the student groups, espe
cially those with a high refund rate.
"It's humiliating that Women
speak received so little funding,"
said then-junior Alicia Dantzker.
"It's sad."
Figueroa noted, however, that
these groups could potentially use
the refund lists as an opportunity to
educate the student body about what
they contribute.
