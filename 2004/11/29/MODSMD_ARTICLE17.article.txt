### HELEN KIM STAFF WRITER 
The Board of Trustees increased
tuition, room and board fees yester
day for the 2004-2005 academic year
by a combined 4.5 percent from the
current year's undergraduate rates.
This increase consists of a 4.5 per
cent raise in tuition from this year's
rate of $28,564 to $2 1 >,847; a 6.1 per
cent increase in the undergraduate
room rate from $4,726 to $5.012; and
a 3.2 percent increase in board from
$4,347 to $4,488.
Chair of the Board of Trustees
Isaac Stein told the Stanford Report
that in recent years the net tuition
has increased less than the pub
lished tuition figure.
"In other words, we are increasing
financial aid faster than we are increas
ing tuition so that we're making sure
we do not impair the ability of families
to receive the necessary financial aid to
attend Stanford," he said.
Stanford collects only 60 percent
of undergraduate education costs
from tuition. Moreover. 46 percent
of undergraduates receive need
based financial aid.
Although tuition for doctoral
candidates who have completed all
requirements except the disserta
tion has increased by about 50 per
cent to $10,000 for four quarters, the
Report said that the new rate is still
lower than figures at similarly
ranked universities.
Part-time graduate tuition in
creased by 4.5 percent from $ 18.6(H)
to $19,440.
Tuition for the Schwl of Engi
neering and the School of Law also
increased by 4.5 percent, whereas tu
ition rose by 4.6 percent for the
Sch(x>l of Medicine and 4.9 percent
for the Graduate School of Business.
