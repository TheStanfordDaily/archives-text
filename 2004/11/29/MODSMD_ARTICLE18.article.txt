# Univ. suspends Tri Delt sorority until June 2005
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
At the recommendation of the
Organizational Conduct Board
(OCB), Dean of Students Greg
Boardman has placed the Delta
Delta Delta (Tri Delt) sorority on
alcohol suspension through June
2005 for violating University policy
and California state law for under
age alcohol consumption and haz
ing.
The charges stem from a Big Sis
ter / Little Sister pledge event held
on May 7. At the event, four fresh
man football players hosted a
"power hour," during which four
sorority pledges drank a shot of beer
every minute for an hour, according
to the police report regarding the in
cident. Five sorority members pur
chased the alcohol.
"Given the nature and magni
tude of these violations, I did give se
rious consideration to suspending
the charter of Delta Delta Delta for
at least one year," Boardman said.
"But after factoring in the sorority's
overall positive history at Stanford,
its forthright and cooperative assis
tance in the OCB process and its
commitment to its action steps, I de
cided not to revoke Delta Delta
Delta's charter this time."
Alcohol suspension precludes
the presence of alcohol in the soror
ity house, including individual
rooms. Additionally, alcohol will be
banned from any chapter events -
specifically new member events and
pre-initiation - and at any sorority
sanctioned activity, held at the
house or elsewhere. The sorority
will be unable to co-sponsor any
events with alcohol present, like the
Intersorority Council Formal or par
ties with fraternities.
Tri Delt's hearing with the OCB -
which handles violations committed
by student groups - was held on Feb.
10. In its report to Boardman, the
board recognized the sorority's
"willingness to take ownership of

the events of spring quarter 2003
and the diligence of their work to ad
dress the shortcomings of the chap
ter's new member education pro
gram."
When the OCB listed the sorori
ty's violations, it brought special at
tention to the fact that alcohol was
supplied with ihe intention to permit
abuse of alcohol. In addition, the
sorority members initiated "an
event entirely focused on alcohol,
which had the potential to. and in
fact did, cause bodily harm."
One of the OCB's sanction rec
ommendations was that Tri Delt's
2004 pledge class be reduced in size.
Boardman instead placed Tri Delt's
new member recruitment program
on a two-year probation through
June 2005.
"Specifically, this means that if
there is another infraction of Uni
versity policy that involves new
member education, the chapter will
be in violation of probation,"
Boardman said. "In such a case, the
()( B would immediately review the
case and would consider suspension
or termination of the charter, de
pending on the facts."
The sorority will also be required
to complete 750 total hours of com
munity service by Dec. 10. The ()CB
recommended that the hours be ful
filled at the Women's Community
Center and / or Health Promotion
Services at Vaden Student Health
Center on projects related to alcohol
and women's issues.
Tri Delt is being held responsible
for the spring quarter incidents
under a principle of collective re
sponsibility. Because Greek organi
zations are the only groups on cam
pus that are allowed to subjectively
choose their members, the Universi
ty holds them to a higher level of ac
countability for their actions.
