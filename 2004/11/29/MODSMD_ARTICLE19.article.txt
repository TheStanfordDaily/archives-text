# Much-revised ASSU diversity bill passes
## 
### GERRY SHIH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Tuesday, Nov. 2, the ASSU
I Indergraduate Senate passed a bill
"to strengthen diversity and free
speech" by a unanimous vote of 11 -0-
4. Initially proposed to the Senate on
Oct. 19 by sophomore Senator Omar
Shakir. the bill had stirred controver
sy within the Senate and was revised
twice before finally passing on Tues
day.
Shakir. also the Senate advocacy
chair, said he was motivated by the
one-year anniversary of the public
controversy between MEC'hA, a
Chicano / Latino organization on
campus, and the on-campus student
publication, the Stanford Review.
A year ago. the Review published
a series of articles about MFXTiA.
comparing it to the Ku Klux Klanand
calling it"a racist organization that
advocates revolution and segrega
tion." In April. MEC'hA failed to re
ceive special-fees funding - a result
that many, including the Review, at
tribute to the published articles.
The core of the new bill is a sec
tion resolving that the Senate "com
j mits to strongly and quickly support
ing all student groups by providing a
forum for open discussion of contro
versial issues as they arise and high
lighting views that the Senate finds
mischaracterized or underrepresent
ed."
The hill that was initially pro
posed criticized the Review and
guaranteed the ASSU's support for
Stanfiird's ethnic groups when under
attack. It drew mixed reactions from
the Senate, as some senators were
concerned that the legislation would
attack the Review and stifle free
speech on campus.
Since then, the bill has seen
marked changes in its approach and
tone. Sophomore Senator Anita
Mukherjee opposed the original bill
but voted for the final version.
"When ()mar brought up the bill,
there were concerns that the ASSU
would have to pick sides when stu
dent groups were in conflict,"
Mukherjee said. "What we ended up
with was an affirmation of what we
are committed to doing: providing a
forum if there are disagreements."
Shakir admitted that he was
"emotional" when he authored the
original hill, but said he is actually
more pleased with the final draft,
which does not attack or refer to the
Review specifically and does not
guarantee unconditional ASSU sup
port for groups under attack.
"We took the bill out of the
MEC'hA / Review context, and none
of the changes Ux>k away from the
heart of the bill," Shakir said. "We're
trying to set general guidelines for
how the ASSU should act in case an
other conflict arises."

There remain senators dissatis
fied and concerned with the bill, in
cluding sophomore Chris Nguyen,
who abstained during the vote.
"It's certainly an improvement
over the original version, but it still
makes the Senate take sides when
there are two conflicting student
groups." Nguyen said. "For example,
if Stanford Students for Life and Stan
ford Students for Choice come into
conflict, how do we pick which side is
mischaracteri/.ed' or underrepre
sented?"
"Honestly, we may be opening a
can of worms."
Senior Stephen Cohen, editor
emeritus and current staffer of the
Review, said he feels that the bill was
simply a direct response to
MEChA's losing funding. Cohen
said that he believes the bill is a direct
reference to the Review's past publi
cations and cited a section that re
quires ASSU action when there are
"calculated, deliberate attacks on
vulnerable student groups aimed at
silencing campus discourse."
"I personally find such legislation
distasteful and a waste of the student
body's time. Let us not forget, the stu
dent body voted against funding
MEChA." he said. "Our investiga
tive journalism regarding MEChA
was not an attack, but rather an at
tempt to promote student discourse.
But it seems the senate is only inter
ested in promoting discourse that fits
into the narrow confines of political
correctness."
Shakir maintained that that par
ticular section of the bill was in no
way referring to the Review.
"That statement reflects a more
general fear among student groups of
what may happen to them," Shakir
said. "While the Senate did feel the
Review's characterization of
MEChA was unfair, we absolutely
support their right to investigative
journalism and 112 reedom of speech."
Senate Chair Chris Lin. a senior,
was one of the four who abstained
during the vote, and remains wary of
Senate partiality in student group
conflicts. However, he expressed his
support for the idea in the bill that the
Senate should bring groups together
for constructive dialogue during
times of disagreement.
"In my opinion, the Senate should
not be taking sides in student group
conflicts and I firmly believe in hav
ing a very diverse set of viewpoints
expressed in publications and pro
gramming," Lin said. "We should
serve to encourage open dialogue be
tween student groups if disagree
ments do arise and we may start to
ensure that platforms are available
for civil discussion."

mischaracterized or underrepresent
ed."
The hill that was initially pro
posed criticized the Review and
guaranteed the ASSU's support for
Stanfiird's ethnic groups when under
attack. It drew mixed reactions from
the Senate, as some senators were
concerned that the legislation would
attack the Review and stifle free
speech on campus.
Since then, the bill has seen
marked changes in its approach and
tone. Sophomore Senator Anita
Mukherjee opposed the original bill
but voted for the final version.
"When ()mar brought up the bill,
there were concerns that the ASSU
would have to pick sides when stu
dent groups were in conflict,"
Mukherjee said. "What we ended up
with was an affirmation of what we
are committed to doing: providing a
forum if there are disagreements."
Shakir admitted that he was
"emotional" when he authored the
original hill, but said he is actually
more pleased with the final draft,
which does not attack or refer to the
Review specifically and does not
guarantee unconditional ASSU sup
port for groups under attack.
"We took the bill out of the
MEC'hA / Review context, and none
of the changes Ux>k away from the
heart of the bill," Shakir said. "We're
trying to set general guidelines for
how the ASSU should act in case an
other conflict arises."

There remain senators dissatis
fied and concerned with the bill, in
cluding sophomore Chris Nguyen,
who abstained during the vote.
"It's certainly an improvement
over the original version, but it still
makes the Senate take sides when
there are two conflicting student
groups." Nguyen said. "For example,
if Stanford Students for Life and Stan
ford Students for Choice come into
conflict, how do we pick which side is
mischaracteri/.ed' or underrepre
sented?"
"Honestly, we may be opening a
can of worms."
Senior Stephen Cohen, editor
emeritus and current staffer of the
Review, said he feels that the bill was
simply a direct response to
MEChA's losing funding. Cohen
said that he believes the bill is a direct
reference to the Review's past publi
cations and cited a section that re
quires ASSU action when there are
"calculated, deliberate attacks on
vulnerable student groups aimed at
silencing campus discourse."
"I personally find such legislation
distasteful and a waste of the student
body's time. Let us not forget, the stu
dent body voted against funding
MEChA." he said. "Our investiga
tive journalism regarding MEChA
was not an attack, but rather an at
tempt to promote student discourse.
But it seems the senate is only inter
ested in promoting discourse that fits
into the narrow confines of political
correctness."
Shakir maintained that that par
ticular section of the bill was in no
way referring to the Review.
"That statement reflects a more
general fear among student groups of
what may happen to them," Shakir
said. "While the Senate did feel the
Review's characterization of
MEChA was unfair, we absolutely
support their right to investigative
journalism and 112 reedom of speech."
Senate Chair Chris Lin. a senior,
was one of the four who abstained
during the vote, and remains wary of
Senate partiality in student group
conflicts. However, he expressed his
support for the idea in the bill that the
Senate should bring groups together
for constructive dialogue during
times of disagreement.
"In my opinion, the Senate should
not be taking sides in student group
conflicts and I firmly believe in hav
ing a very diverse set of viewpoints
expressed in publications and pro
gramming," Lin said. "We should
serve to encourage open dialogue be
tween student groups if disagree
ments do arise and we may start to
ensure that platforms are available
for civil discussion."

On Tuesday, Nov. 2, the ASSU
I Indergraduate Senate passed a bill
"to strengthen diversity and free
speech" by a unanimous vote of 11 -0-
4. Initially proposed to the Senate on
Oct. 19 by sophomore Senator Omar
Shakir. the bill had stirred controver
sy within the Senate and was revised
twice before finally passing on Tues
day.
Shakir. also the Senate advocacy
chair, said he was motivated by the
one-year anniversary of the public
controversy between MEC'hA, a
Chicano / Latino organization on
campus, and the on-campus student
publication, the Stanford Review.
A year ago. the Review published
a series of articles about MFXTiA.
comparing it to the Ku Klux Klanand
calling it"a racist organization that
advocates revolution and segrega
tion." In April. MEC'hA failed to re
ceive special-fees funding - a result
that many, including the Review, at
tribute to the published articles.
The core of the new bill is a sec
tion resolving that the Senate "com
j mits to strongly and quickly support
ing all student groups by providing a
forum for open discussion of contro
versial issues as they arise and high
lighting views that the Senate finds
mischaracterized or underrepresent
ed."
