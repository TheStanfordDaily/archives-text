WASHINGTON, D.C. â€” Declar
ing President George W. Bush the
victor in the election against Sen.
John Kerry, White House Chief of
Staff Andrew Card announced early
this morning he was confident that
the president had won Ohio's elec

the festivities for the evening, tried

lead. Even though there were
120.000 provisional votes that had to
be counted, Gillespie said, a large
portion would be discarded.
Still, the crowd of Bush support
ers remained confident and excited
throughout the evening.
Many in the crowd were 20-some
thing political junkies who showed
up to cheer on Bush's campaign for
four more years in office and to rub
elbows with the staffs of the White
House, the RNC and Bush / Cheney
'04 campaign.
"It is only fitting that our final
stop to victory is here in the Ronald
Reagan Building," said Senate Ma
jority Leader Bill Frist.
The stage was draped with a giant
