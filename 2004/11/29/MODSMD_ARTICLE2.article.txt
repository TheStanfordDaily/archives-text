### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
WASHINGTON, D.C. — Declar
ing President George W. Bush the
victor in the election against Sen.
John Kerry, White House Chief of
Staff Andrew Card announced early
this morning he was confident that
the president had won Ohio's elec
toral votes.
Bush left 4.000 of his supporters
hanging in anticipation last night
when he opted not to appear at the
Republican National Committee's
"2004 Victory Celebration" at the
Ronald Reagan Building and Inter
national Trade Center. Most televi
sion networks' projections left Bush
short of the necessary 270 electoral
votes. Some people, including Sen.
Kerry, believe that provisional bal
lots and a few remaining districts still
uncounted in Ohio leave the swing
state too close to call.
As late as 3 a.m.. Republican Na
tional Committee Chairman Ed
Gillespie, who was also chairman of
the festivities for the evening, tried
to keep the crowd's energy up, ex

plaining that the remaining votes to
be counted in Ohio were not likely to
totally erase Bush's 123,000 vote
lead. Even though there were
120.000 provisional votes that had to
be counted, Gillespie said, a large
portion would be discarded.
Still, the crowd of Bush support
ers remained confident and excited
throughout the evening.
Many in the crowd were 20-some
thing political junkies who showed
up to cheer on Bush's campaign for
four more years in office and to rub
elbows with the staffs of the White
House, the RNC and Bush / Cheney
'04 campaign.
"It is only fitting that our final
stop to victory is here in the Ronald
Reagan Building," said Senate Ma
jority Leader Bill Frist.
The stage was draped with a giant

American flag and featured a blue
backdrop with white stars that illu
minated the arched ceiling of the
building's modern interior. Against
this setting, tiers of cheering Bush
supporters waved red and blue
cylindrical balloons declaring
"GOP Victory."
Frist praised Bush's handling of
a number of issues, including the
Sept. 11 attacks. "We didn't run
away - we turned and faced our
enemy," he said
Frist also said the president had
a plan to restore economic growth
and noted the tax cuts Bush enacted
all four years in office.
After even point he made. Frist
repeated the refrain that "President
Bush has not wavered, and we will

win," and the audience chanted
"we will win" along with him.
Julia Tierney, a second year
graduate student at the Johns Hop
kins School of Advanced Interna
tional Studies, said she is taking
more of an interest in the presiden
tial election this year than ever be
fore.
"The world is in such an interest
ing place," she said. 'We're at a
turning point in American history.
This election will be a mandate for
more of what | Bush | is doing or for
something di fie rent."
As Bush received more and more
votes throughout the evening, the
crowd of supporters continued to
cheer jubilantly.

At that time. Bush was still hov

the stage, wielding an American
Hag and a cigar, and proclaimed,
"From 246 to 270 — that ain't far."

New Mexico precincts had given 52
percent of their votes to Bush, peo
ple were cheering through the halls
while multi-colored spotlights
