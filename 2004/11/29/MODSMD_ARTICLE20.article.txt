# Mtn. Lion killed in Palo Alto
## 
### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
A mountain lion was slain early
yesterday afternoon in a residential
Palo Alto neighborhood after two
sightings of the lion earlier that day.
The lion, an adult male cat weighing
about 108 pounds, was killed by one
shot from a rifle gun.
However, it is not certain that
this mountain lion is the same one
that has been sighted in the Stanford
foothills over the past few weeks,
said Detective Kara Apple of the
Palo Alto Police Department.
"There is no way to tell unless
there are eyewitnesses that can talk
about distinct markings, so at this
point we can't say if it's the same
mountain lion that attacked the
horse or has been seen in the lower
foothills," Apple said. "Even our
naturalist can not positively connect
them at this time."
She also said that the possibility
that there are more mountain lions in
the foothills could not be ruled out.
"The mountain lion got to the
neighborhood through our creek
system," Apple said. "It's alarming
that they're in our foothills, and
even more alarming that they found
their way into the neighborhoods."
According to a press release
from the PAPD. the decision to im
mediately dispatch the mountain
lion was made after consulting the
California Department of Fish and
Game, Morgan Hill Police Depart
ment. and taking into consideration
the neighborhood and the fact that
two nearby elementary schools
would dismiss students within the
hour.
The mountain lion was first spot
ted yesterday at 4:45 am in the 500
block of Coleridge. The second
sighting was at Cedar and Parkinson
at 5:40 a.m.
With assistance from Stanford
Department of Public Safety,
Mountain View Police, East Palo
Alto Police. Menlo Park Police and
CHP fixed wing Pilots, Palo Alto
police officers conducted an imme
diate search of the area.
At approximately 12:10 p.m. gar
deners working at 941 Newell Street
saw the mountain lion run from the
rear yard over a fence. Police offi
cers then tightened their perimeter
patrol units around the 900 block of
Newell Road and proceeded to
search yard-to-yard.
At approximately 1:06 p.m., the
mountain lion was spotted in a tree
in front of 1525 Walnut Drive near a
perimeter post. It was then that the
lion was immediately dispatched.
