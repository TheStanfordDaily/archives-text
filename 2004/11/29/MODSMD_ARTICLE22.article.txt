# Zelikow discusses 9/11, terrorism
## 
### JOE SEXTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Philip Zelikow, the executive
director of the 9/11 Commission,
emphasized the failures of pre-
Sept. 11 anti-terrorism measures
and the many weaknesses that re
main at a talk yesterday afternoon
at Kresge Auditorium.
His remarks drew heavily on
the findings and recommenda
tions of the 9/11 Commission Re
port. which he co-authored.
Zelikow, who was invited to
campus by the Stanford Institute
for International Studies and the
World Affairs Council of North
ern California, also spoke about
the reforms that needed to be en
acted to more fully secure the
United States.
"We found that none of the
countermeasures made by the
United States in the years preced
ing 9/11 did anything to even
delay the attacks," Zelikow said.
"We had a national security state
that was designed to win the Cold
War. We had done so, but we were
left incapable of facing challenges
like the ones we faced on Sept.
11."
Zelikow claimed that the at
tacks were a result of an unimagi
native and poorly run intelligence
community.
"History doesn't repeat itself in
Xerox copies, so you have to look
deeper," Zelikow said. "The way
things are with the intelligence
community, we are not capable of
implementing a management
strategy to counter terrorism. We
have a government that has not
yet entered the 21st century when
it comes to management."
At times, Zelikow was inter
rupted by protesters who loudly

voiced their opposition to him and
to President George W. Bush's ad
ministration.
One audience member blew a
referee's whistle and accused the
U.S. government of perpetrating
the attacks. Another called Ze
likow a "scurrilous liar." while an
other claimed that Stanford was
"complicit in the 9/11 cover-up."
Event organizers removed the
protesters, and Zelikow coolly re
sponded by saying to the audi
ence, "Welcome to my world."
The message of the protesters,
who are associated with an organi
zation called the Northern Cali
fornia 9/11 Truth Alliance, did
not seem to resonate well with the
audience.
"I thought [the protesters]
were disruptive, not effective and
annoying," said senior Shecna
Chestnut. "I don't think that the
outbursts were constructive in get
ting their message across, not did I
think their message was very clear
in the first place."
Zelikow used the protesters'
diatribes as a transition into of fer
ing personal reflections about his
experience as an embattled politi
cal figure at the helm of a commis
sion investigating an emotionally
charged event.
"I became an outlet |for the
anger of people who suffered on
9/11)." Zelikow said. "I was often
held responsible for all of the
things that went wrong.
"The attacks came from both
sides. I was also attacked from the
right by [a conservative columnist |
who claimed I hijacked the com
mission to attack the Bush admin
istration," he added.
He concluded the talk by com
menting on the goals of the com
mission report and his satisfaction

with the American public's re
sponse.
"From the beginning, I wanted
the report to be a book and I want
ed it to be in every bookstore in
America," Zelikow said. "We also
wanted to make sure that we were
not writing down to people."
Even several months after its
initial release, the 9/11 Commis
sion Report ranks 30th on USA
Today's best-seller list.
Zelikow said he was elated that
the commission was able to pro
duce a product that has been wide
ly read without having to compro
mise on the sophistication of the
text.
"[The success of the book]
shows that you can write up to
people."

sion investigating an emotionally
charged event.
"I became an outlet |for the
anger of people who suffered on
9/11)." Zelikow said. "I was often
held responsible for all of the
things that went wrong.
"The attacks came from both
sides. I was also attacked from the
right by [a conservative columnist |
who claimed I hijacked the com
mission to attack the Bush admin
istration," he added.
He concluded the talk by com
menting on the goals of the com
mission report and his satisfaction

with the American public's re
sponse.
"From the beginning, I wanted
the report to be a book and I want
ed it to be in every bookstore in
America," Zelikow said. "We also
wanted to make sure that we were
not writing down to people."
Even several months after its
initial release, the 9/11 Commis
sion Report ranks 30th on USA
Today's best-seller list.
Zelikow said he was elated that
the commission was able to pro
duce a product that has been wide
ly read without having to compro
mise on the sophistication of the
text.
"[The success of the book]
shows that you can write up to
people."
