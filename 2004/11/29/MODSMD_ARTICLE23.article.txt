# Reno talks crime and punishment
## 
### SHAMALA GALLAGHER 
"One of the proudest moments
in my career was when a man
stopped me in a downtown building
and said, 'Ms. Reno, I want to thank
you for arresting me,"' former U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno said
in her keynote speech at the Stan
ford Law Review's "Punishment
and Its Purposes" Symposium on
Friday.
"I told him that I didn't arrest
him," she said. "He said, i know.
But you got me into drug court. 1 got
my family and job hack, and I'll
never lose them again.' That's what
you're in public service for, to make
the hard decisions and to be pre
pared to be wrong."
As she stood before an audience
so large that the Law School had to
bring in extra chairs to the class
room, Reno outlined the impor
tance of creating sentences that
would help offenders become con
structive members of society rather
than rendering them unable to func
tion. In order to do that, she believes
that doing research about the effects
of punishment is the correct course
of action.
Reno said that the biggest prob
lem with our system of punishment
today is that politicians use rhetoric
about sentencing that is purely po
litical and meant to convince the
public that justice will be served.
"We will never leave the politics
of crime and sentencing behind until
we do our level best to successfully
identify the best research and devel
op crime and sentencing policy
based on solid research," Reno said.
"I think these are the issues to study:

How can punishment be most effec
tive? How can punishment do the
least harm? How can punishment
enable a person to come out of the
punishment period with his self-re
spect intact? How can we return him
to the community with the ability to
function as an independent individ
ual?"
Reno explained that research by
psychologists and criminologists
shows that when people have been
in prison fora certain amount of
time, they lose their ability to make
decisions in society and function
like other members of the commu
nity.
Reno said that it was her position
that prosecutors and judges should
figure out what the safe amount of
time to put a certain person in
prison is and then only sentence the
offender to that amount of time.
Reno stressed the essentiality of
research into preventative measures.
"What we have [recently]
learned about psychology staggers
the imagination," she said. "We un
derstand so much about what can be
done."
However, Reno said that there
has not been enough done with this
information with regard to both
drugs and mental illness.
"We can do far more if we work
together and. with the experts, find
out what works and what doesn't
work," she said.
Reno talked about the need for
an organized system of competent
people working together to perform
research, construct solutions and
implement them well. She suggest
ed hiring fewer people in the law en
forcement system but offering them

more money, thus creating a reason
for more qualified people to apply.
"I have spent over 25 years in
public prosecution, and trying to fig
ure out the tragic, mean, evil, funny,
laughing, remarkable human race is
one of the great challenges that any
public servant can have," concluded
Reno to loud applause. "But what I
ask of all of you is don't get caught
up in the numbers.
"Remember that these are all
people - flesh and blood, hopes and
fears, failures and successes - who
deserve a chance to make a differ
ence. And we can provide it if we
come together and use the best sci
ence, the best common sense, the
best cooperation, to try to achieve
our goals."
