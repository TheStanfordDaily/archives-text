### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Editor's note: On Thesday, Nov. 9,
Chang was found dead in bei~ car
along 17 in Lee Gatos. The
official cause of her dsath has not
bean released, but irbestlcptors cm -
elided that Chang, vho was 36, died
cf a self-inflicted gjrdxt.
Chinese-American historian Iris
Chang emphasized the connection
between remembering genocide and
preventing it at a lecture last night to
a packed audience in History Cor
ner.
Recalling her work on the best
selling book "Rape of Nanking," she
described looking over photos of the
1937 massacre and being "haunted"
by the idea that it might be forgot
ten.
Chang recounted her experience
researching and writing about the
war crimes committed in China. Her
grandparents fled from the Nanking
as the violence was beginning, and
Chang called the Nanking massacre
"part of my childhood." At the time
she began her research, the events
were unacknowledged in Japan and
little-known to the rest of the world.
Still, today, many aspects of her
book are controversial, and she is
challenged by conspiracy theorists in
Japan who deny Japanese massacres
in China.
Chang recounted how one of the
book's detractors "suggests that I
am a secret agent for the People's
Republic of China ... I've always
wanted to know: what was a secret
agent doing in Champaign-Urbana,
Illinois, for the first 20 vears of her
life?"
For her research, Chang recount

ed combing through books, inter
viewing survivors and searching gov
ernment archives for information
about what happened. She ultimate
ly amassed thousands of pages of
raw material in several languages.
In her book, Chang placed the
death toll in the Nanking massacre
at 300,000, a number greater than
the civilian casualty count of World
War II in England, France and Bel
gium combined, she said.
"I bring up these crimes to re
mind us of the potential for evil that
lives in us all," Chang said. "The Pa
cific War was not some tragic flaw
but an indication of a universal con
dition of human nature."
Chang also described her new
book, "The Chinese in America,"
which traces the history of Chinese
communities in the United States up
to the present day.
"All of my books are linked to
China in some way," she said. "But
more significantly, they are all stud
ies in power. My books illuminate
the struggle of people against op
pressive power."
Chang went on to speak about
the tendency of countries to move
towards dictatorship in times of eco
nomic crisis. Dictatorships then turn
minority groups into scapegoats for
the country's problems, setting the
stage for genocide.
She explained how just like the
tragedy in Nanking, the oppression
of the Chinese in the United States
began with an economic crisis. She
said that the relative freedom and
equal status of the Chinese ended
after the stock market crash of 1870.
"Suddenly, society saw a giant
conspiracy to undercut the Ameri
can working man." Chang said.
"Whites began to organize political

ly against the Chinese."
She described the ensuing strug
gle for equality, recounting how Chi
nese railroad workers organized
"the largest ethnic strike in the coun
try," and related how lawsuits
brought by Chinese Americans laid
the foundations for modern-day
civil-rights protections.
Chang called her latest book, "my
love letter to America, and a cau
tionary patriotic message to the
country of my birth."
When asked how she was able to
work for long periods of time on
graphic and emotionally wrenching
material, Chang said, "I work with
an ache in my heart, but 1 do believe
in the power of one person to make
a difference."
