### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
The 2004 Commencement cere
mony held at Stanford Stadium
marked the start of a new path for
many graduates who were encour
aged to help others by Commence
ment speaker O'Connor.
University President John Hen
nessy opened the ceremonies by
welcoming the estimated 25.(XM) on
hand. Hcnnessy then introduced
O'Connor. Stanford alumna of 1950
and Stanford Law alumna of 1952.
O'Connor first delivered a
speech to Stanford graduates in
1982. one year after becoming the
first woman to hold the office of
Supreme Court Justice.
In her speech O'Connor, de
scribed her own struggles after col
lege and in the career world - includ
ing those dealing with sexism - to en
courage the crowd to learn the

lessons life slips in.
"I came to realize almost imme
diately what a wonderful path I had
taken," said O'Connor of finally en
tering the public sector. "At every
step of the way, I felt the thrill of
doing something right fora reason
that was good. It was the thrill of
building bridges."
Recalling the words and praising
the actions of the late President
Ronald Reagan, who appointed her
into the Supreme Court, the Stan
ford alumna urged the Class of 2004
to fulfill their right to "dream heroic
dreams".
The theme of "building bridges"
ran strongly throughout the speech.
Mentioned in the address were the
struggles of those who fought to end
segregation in schools, such as
Brown v. Board of Education, as
well as others who fought racism
throughout the 20th century.
O'Connor told the graduates that

while "Triumphs over injustice - like
those spearheaded hv Ronald Rea
gan and those that resulted from the
efforts of the young attorneys in
Brown â€” can seem inevitable if you
know how the story ends," these
fights can only help solve the prob
lems of America.
She asked them to consider a life
working for the public good.
"I don't know what the future
holds, but I know who holds the fu
ture," O'Connor concluded. "It is
you. Commit yourselves today, as
you embark on your new life as a
Stanford graduate, to being a bridge
builder.
"We need you, and those who
cross the bridges you build will
thank you."
