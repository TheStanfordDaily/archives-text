ment that he intends to focus on. in
cluding fostering stronger academic
ties between the Law School and the
University at large.
Kramer said that many students
now choose to go after two degrees,
one in law and one in some other
specialty, and he described the chal
lenge of catering to changing student
needs.
"Students want to know that when

they get to law school they will have
choices," he said.
He explained that law is becom
ing more specialized and that many
students do not goon to practice law.
"The education we are offering re
mains partial and incomplete,"
Kramer said.
Kramer also suggested that the
Law School could better capitalize
on the opportunities that its small
size affords.
"We need to make better use of
the time we get with students," he
said.
With this challenge in mind,
Kramer stated the importance of
preserving the small community of
the Law School. He proposed that
instead of trying to accomplish meet
ing the full breadth of these goals on
its own. the Law School should seek
to leverage the strength of the larger
university.
