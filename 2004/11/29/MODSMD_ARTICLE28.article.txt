# Ex-provost named Secretary of State
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY DESK EDITOR 
President George W. Bush made
public yesterday his choice of Na
tional Security Advisor and former
Stanford Provost Condoleezza Rice
to succeed Colin Powell as secretary
of state.
Rice rose to the nation's most vis
ible diplomatic post just five-and-a
half years after resigning as Stan
ford's provost in 1999, a post she
held for six years. She is currently on
leave from her professorship in the
political science department and her
senior fellowship at the Hoover In
stitution.
In his announcement. Bush called
her "a recognized expert in interna
tional affairs, a distinguished teacher
and academic leader and a public
servant with years of White House
experience."
Faculty who worked alongside
Rice at Stanford said they were not
surprised by her nomination, but
they had varying expectations of
how she will lead the State Depart
ment in the coming years.
Coit Blacker, director of the Stan
ford Institute for International Stud

ies, said that Rice has had to keep
her political identity "somewhat pri
vate" because of her role as national
security advisor.
"The general view outside is that
she's quite conservative, maybe even
a member of the neo-conservative
wing." he said in an interview with
The Daily. "For the first time, she's
going to be in a high-visibility posi
tion. and people are going to expect
that she will have her own views. She
won't disappoint."
Blacker said he does not see
Rice's views as strictly neo-conserva
tive. but rather as a blend between
neo-conservatism and more tradi
tional Republican views.
Prior to Rice's nomination, there
had been talk in the media that Rice
hoped to succeed Donald Rumsfeld
as secretary of defense.
"By virtue of her background and
training, she would be a more natur
al choice for defense than state."
Blacker said.
Simon Jackman, associate profes
sor of political science, said that "re
placing a loyalist like Rumsfeld
would imply that the military cam
paigns in Iraq and Afghanistan
weren't going well, and that's not the

party line."
Many media outlets reported that
Rice had wanted to return to acade
mic life, but according to Assoc.
Prof, of Political Science Michael
McFaul, Rice is too valuable to Bush
for him to let her get away.
"Condi has become the presi
dent's most trusted advisor on for
eign policy." he wrote in an e-mail.
"Consequently, he would have been
a fool to let her go back to Stanford
at this critical moment."
Rice now faces the challenge of re
placing Powell, who has won the
trust of many people within the State
Department. According to Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State Randall
Shriver, who teaches a course this
quarter at the Stanford in Washing
ton program. Rice has "big shoes to
fill."
University President John Hen
nessy also expressed high hopes for
Rice in her new position. In a written
statement to The Daily, Hennessy
said. "Condoleezza Rice served
Stanford with distinction as a scholar
and provost."
"Her intellect and strategic vision
were of tremendous value to the
University during her tenure here,"

he added. "I have no doubt that Pro
fessor Rice will be a great asset to
our nation as it faces serious chal
lenges in the international arena."
