### BRENDAN MARTEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The University has announced that, as of
this September, Dean of Admission and Fi
nancial Aid Robin Mamlet will be working a
reduced number of hours while still perform
ing professional duties. She plans to step down
from her position altogether by June I of next
year.
"After considerable thought during the last
few months ... I've made the decision to have
this be my last year at Stanford," Mamlet said
to The Stanford Report. "This will mean I'll
have been at Stanford for five years, and at this
time, my desire is to be more focused on my
family, especially my children, during this key
time in their development.
"The provost has graciously agreed that I
may begin to spend more time with my family
right away," she added. "The quality and com
mitment of the current staff in admission, fi
nancial aid and visitor information services
makes this decision easier."
Mamlet presided over several significant
changes in undergraduate admission policies,
including the notable shift from Stanford's
prior binding early decision setup to it's cur
rent non-binding, single-choice early action
system.
"I think that this certainly may enhance our
ability to enroll a diverse class," Mamlet said
regarding the change in a prior Nov. 7,2002 ar
ticle. "It certainly will not hinder it. Early ac
tion gives students on financial aid more flexi
bility - they can compare financial aid pack
ages."

Indeed, Stanford's undergraduate popula
tion witnessed unprecedented diversity gains
within its entering classes during Mamlet's
tenure. As reported in an April 3, 2(M)2 Daily
article, the University announced that - for the
first time in its history - more than half of its ad
mitted class were students from minority
groups.
"The composition of students she's brought
about during her term at Stanford couldn't be
a more exciting, diverse and talented group of
individuals, at least in my opinion," said Tom
Hanada. a rising senior. "The University has
increasingly become a more and more vibrant
place to learn and grow."
Mamlet has been praised during her term by
students and administrators alike. University
officials had nothing but kind words for the
outgoing dean.
"We are very sorry to lose Robin and she
will be extremely difficult to replace," said
Provost John Etchemendy to The Stanford
Report. "Nonetheless. 1 respect her decision
and am grateful for the guidance she will pro
vide during this transitional year."
According to University President John
Hennessy, Mamlet has been a strong asset to
the University during her years of service.
"Robin's tenure has been marked by suc
cession of stellar freshman classes and signifi
cant improvements in our financial aid pro
gram." Hennessy said. "Her dedication to
Stanford has been unparalleled."
