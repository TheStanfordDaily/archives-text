# Vote settles controversial election
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) voted on May
26 to certify the results of the ASSU special executive
election. This completes the certification process for
President-elect Chioke Borgelt-Mose and Vice Presi
dent-elect Kory Vargas Caro, whose victory was certi
fied by the Undergraduate Senate on Monday.
"Both Kory and 1 are thrilled that we can actually
start work." said Borgelt-Mose, a sophomore.
Before the vote. Elections Commissioner Ellie Mar
tin, a junior, recommended that the Council certify the
special-election results. Echoing her comments from
Monday's meeting, Martin noted that she had recom

mended that the Senate certify the previous executive
election, "but that's just not going to happen."
Martin also pointed out that failing to certify the spe
cial election could jeopardize the ASSU, as the Consti
tutional Council currently lacks the quorum necessary
to make decisions. She added that a further delay in cer
tification could hurt the ASSU's reputation.
"Just on a personal level. 1 encourage you to certify/'
Martin said. "If you don't, there's a good chance that we
won't have an executive slate until next year."
Some GSC members expressed concern about the spe
cial election's four percent turnout among graduate stu
dents.
"We should note that we are troubled by the low
turnout," said GSC member Surya Singh, a doctoral stu
dent in mechanical engineering. "The Elections Com
mission should not feel that a four percent turnout from
our constituency makes fora fair election. We don't
want people to think that this is acceptable."
Seven GSC members voted to certify the election,
two voted against it and one abstained.
"It was a procedural vote," said GSC member and
education doctoral student Luke Miller, who voted
against certification. "It was not a vote against the in
coming slate, nor was it a vote for the slate that won the
first election. My understanding is that the reason given
for not certifying the original election was not valid ac
cording to the Constitutional Council."
