Stanford Medical School Dean Dr. Phil
Pizzo was the first person named to the state
committee responsible for disbursing the $3
billion stem-cell research fund established by
Proposition 71.
State Controller Steve Westly last Friday
appointed Pizzo to the 29-mcmber Indepen
dent Oversight Committee, which will help
govern the Institute for Regenerative Medi
cine, the new California agency created by
Prop. 71 that is comparable to a state version
of the National Institute of Health.
In a press release, Westly said he selected
Pizzo because of his reputation as "a world
recognized leader" in the field. "I know that he
will help ensure that Californians' investment
in stem-cell research will be spent wisely on
the science with the highest likelihood of pro
ducing cures for diseases," Westly said.
Pizzo said in the same release that he was
honored by the appointment and enthusiastic
about the work ahead.
"The Institute for Regenerative Medicine

will bring new funds to a field of research that
has shown the potential to change the way we
understand and treat disease," he said.
He also said he was encouraged by the
strong margin of public support for the initia
tive, which passed with 59 percent of the vote.
"Passage of the proposition is a clear affirma
tion that the citizens of California value this
area of scientific investigation," Pizzo said. "I
look forward to serving in this important en
deavor."
Medical experts predict that the research
money will be a boon to universities like Stan
ford. CalTcch and the five University of Cali
fornia medical schools that have already de
veloped reputable stem-cell research pro
grams.
University President John Hennessy said
the initiative would further bolster the status
of Stanford's medical program - joking that
the University would soon be able to recruit all
of I larvard's top faculty - at a private donor re
ception last night.
