# State senate bill keeps Cordell on PA council
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The California Senate narrowly ap
proved a bill on Monday that would
allow Vice Provost for Campus Rela
tions LaDoris Cordell to sit on the
Palo Alto city council without dis
rupting business between Stanford
and the city.
In order to become law, the bill
must now be passed by the Assembly
and signed by the governor.
Section 1090 of the government
code has inhibited business negotia
tions between Stanford and Palo Alto
since Cordell took her seat Jan. 1 be
cause it forbids city councils from ne
gotiating contracts with a corporation
for which a council member works.
Stanford does not fall under the ex
emption to the law made for nonprof
it organizations, as was originally
thought, since the University is set up
as a trust.
The bill, introduced earlier this
month by state Sen. Byron Sher, al
ters that exemption so that it includes
trusts that operate as nonprofits, such
as Stanford.

Palo Alto Mayor Bern Beecham,
along with others representing Stan
lord and Palo Alto, attended hearings
on the hill held by the state Senate's
Local Government Committee two
weeks ago.
The bill narrowly passed with two
thirds, or 28. of the vote, receiving
only one more vote than necessary.
According to Beecham. the bill will
now be sent to the Rules Committee
of the State Assembly. From there,
Beecham expects it to go to the Local
Government Committee.
Until the situation can be resolved,
the city council has simply opted to
hold off on negotiating any contracts
with Stanford.
Even though there are many ongo
ing contractual negotiations between
the city and Stanford, dealing with
everything from the Stanford Shop
ping Center to Marguerite bus sched
ules, none was so pressing that it
could not be put on hold for at least
the first quarter of this fiscal year.
