# Stanford nabs two top CSRE profs from Harvard
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has hired African and African American
studies professors from Harvard, a move designed to
establish Stanford's Center for Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity as the national leader in the
field.
Professors Lawrence Bobo and Marcyliena Mor
gan. who are married, will arrive in January and work
in the sociology and communication departments, re
spectively. Bobo will also take the reigns of the
CCSRE in the fall of 2005.
"Stanford sociology is positioned to become the
most intellectually exciting unit in the discipline
today," Bobo said.
Bobo, who was recently elected to the National
Academy of Sciences, is best known for his research
on racial attitudes and relations, social psychology,
public opinion and political behavior.
Morgan is the founder and director of the Hip Hop
Archive, a collection of song lyrics that she will bring
to Stanford.
Her research has focused on language, culture and
identity, and sociolinguistics, particularly within the
African and African American communities. She will
join Stanford as an associate professor in communi
cation.
"These are crowning appointments," said Claude
Steele, a psychology professor and current director of
the CCSRE. "We are developing perhaps the
strongest center for the comparative study of race and
ethnicity, in the nation."
"We are very fortunate to recruit Professors Bobo
and Morgan." said in Sharon Long, the Dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences, in a press release.
"Their work addresses centrally important questions
about race, identity and equality in our society."
The appointments add clout to an already promi
nent academic program on campus, Steele said.
"CCSRE has both a strong undergraduate major
and a research institute (Research Institute for the
Comparative Study of Race and Ethnicity) that has
over ICK) faculty in affiliation."
Long said, in an interview, the open, interdiscipli
nary structure of CCSRE was highly influential in re
cruiting Bobo and Morgan.
"We were able to attract Larry and Marcy because
at Harvard they were cornered over in
African American studies," she said. "Stanford
provides a better context and home for their work. I
think [CCSRE] will become a model of how to break
through disciplinary boundaries and strengthen the
cluster to make the whole more than the sum of the
parts," she added.
Several Stanford faculty have already expressed
excitement at the news. History professor
Clayborne Carson, who is also the director of the
King Papers Project, called the appointments "a
major step forward for the CCSRE and for Stanford."
However, he added that the University has room
for improvement. "I remain disappointed that the
history department still has no full-time person in the
African American field," Carson said.
Students are also eagerly awaiting Bobo's arrival.
Before he transferred from Harvard two years ago,
Stanford NAACP president Chris Cowan, a senior,
was enrolled in Bobo's sociology seminar, "Race and
Crime."
"We dealt with so many issues surrounding dis
parities in crimes and punishments by race." he said.
"The class was a great experience."
Harvard, historically the preeminent institution for
African and Atrican American scholarship, has re
cently lost several renowned professors in the field
since university president Lawrence H. Summers
took the helm three years ago.
Other high-profile departures include Cornel West
and Kwame Anthony Appiah. who both decamped
for Princeton two years ago.
