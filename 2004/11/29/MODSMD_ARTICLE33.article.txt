# Cornel West says 'democratic experiment' is waning
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Princeton Prof. Cornel West gave
an impassioned talk last night to a
crowded Memorial Auditorium on
the state of democracy in America. It
came hard on the heels of the first
presidential debate, which was
broadcast live in the auditorium just
before his speech began.
West wove commentary about
historical philosophers like Socrates,
Hegel, Dante and Melville into a
contemporary political message.
West mixed humorous and seri
ous comments in his references to
the presidential debate.
"Maybe I'll just keep my distance
from the debate tonight — in the in
terest of high quality," he quipped,
drawing laughter and applause from
the crowd.
West spoke about Socrates and
the tradition of Socratic debate,
holding up the Dialogues as a model
for public discourse.

"I didn't see the [presidential] de
bate myself, but my hunch is that it
fell short of Socratic questioning,"
he said.
"1 can imagine what happens
when a democracy begins to lose the
art of dialogue. Media salesmanship,
more and more, moves to the center,
with packaged entities, spinsters and
pollsters."
Without explicitly mentioned
President George W. Bush or his
policies. West's discussed the cur
rent political situation in the United
States.
"Our democratic experiment is
waning, weakening," he said. "The
Socratic tradition, so indispensable,
is waning."
West talked about the still-fresh
shock of the Sept. 11 attacks but
warned against letting outrage de
generate into extremism.
"You can't sustain a democratic
project by reducing public discourse
about one of its most explosive is
sues to revenge and demonizing the

Other."
"We're going to sustain our dis
course at the level of justice," West
said, making reference to King as
well as Mamie Till Mobley. whose
son was lynched by racists in 1955.
West invoked Mobley as a model of
bravery and forbearance for sustain
ing a high level of intellectual in
tegrity in the face of tremendous suf
fering and personal loss.
West also criticized what he per
ceives as shallow American opti
mism surrounding the war on terror,
and he warned against the "constitu
tion of the American empire
abroad."
West invoked the historical plight
of African Americans and Native
Americans and urged the audience
to remember the injustice and impe
rialism at the roots of the well-inten
tioned "great American democratic
experiment."
"These realities are denied,
avoided, evaded by a mainstream
American civilization that believes

that it's always on the right track, ex
emplifying morality at its highest
level," West said. "This is a Disney
World sensibility, of not having to
deal with the darkness and the un
derside of the democratic experi
ment. American terrorism is quite
relevant these days in the 'war
against terrorism.'"
In his concluding remarks. West
advocated "'a blues sensibility," call
ing for and end to American naivete,
challenging the country to embrace
difficult challenges.
"As the American democratic ex
periment has grown old, the chal
lenge is for that experiment to really
grow up," he said, as he received a
standing ovation from the crowd.
The event was sponsored by Stan
ford's Aurora Forum, which invites
various speakers to campus to dis
cuss democratic ideals.
