## No concession from Kerry 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
BOSTON. Mass. — Uncertainty
about the presidential vote in Ohio
prevented Sen. John Kerry from at
tending his own party.
More than 10,000 supporters
streamed into Boston's Copley
Square last night fora public rally and
party sponsored by the city for Kerry.
But Kerry did not make it to
Copley Square as planned. Instead,
he sent his running mate. Sen John
Edwards, to address the thousands
of patient supporters who remained
at 2:30 a.m. EST. Edwards told the
crowd that he and Kerry were far
from conceding anything.
"It's been a long night, but we've
waited four years for this victory.
We can wait one more night." he
said, suggesting that the election re

suits, hinging on Ohio, would not he
finalized for at least another day.
"John Kerry and I made a
promise to the American people
that in this election every vote
would count and every vote would
be counted. Tonight we are keeping
our word and we will light for every
vote." Edwards said.
"You deserve no less," Edwards
added, echoing the sentiment of
Bon Jovi, who had ignited the
crowd hours earlier with a rousing
rendition of Bruce Springsteen's
"No Surrender."
Hundreds lined the street hours
before the festivities officially
began at 8 p.m. The party was a star
studded event that included perfor
mances by Bon Jovi. James Taylor.
Sheryl Crow, Carole King and the
Black Eyed Peas. Partygoers also
watched live news coverage on

jumbo screens as networks project
ed Election Day results into the
wee hours of the night.
There was a marked shift in en
ergy among initially jubilant sup
porters after President George W.
Bush was projected to win Florida
relatively early in the night, around
II p.m. However, hopes remained
high through the live performances,
which wound down by midnight,
around the same time Kerry was
scheduled to appear. The crowd
waited anxiously for the senator,
withstanding drizzling rain and a
temperature that had dropped to
the mid-40s.
Ohio was, as many analysts pre
dicted. the state that caused the
most nail-biting among Kerry sup
porters at Copley Square.
When one network projected
around midnight that Ohio would
fall for Bush, the crowd was palpa
bly upset, and party organizers
quickly switched the station to
CNN, which maintained that the
state was still too close to call.
The crowd began thinning after
1.a.m.., as Bostonians ran to catch
the Metro before stations closed;
those who remained shouted
"Kerry. Kerry. Kerry!"
However, the subdued tone did
not prevail all night. Loud cheers
erupted across the square when
Kerry was projected to take hotly
contested states like Pennsylvania.
New Hampshire and Minnesota,
which were called for Kerry by
CNN well after 2 a.m.
