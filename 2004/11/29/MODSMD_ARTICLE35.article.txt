LAS VEGAS. Nev. - Staying up
late, meeting new people and tak
ing risks are all standard practice
for college students in Las Vegas.
For 125 Stanford students, how
ever. there was nothing pre
dictable about their trip to Sin
City last Friday, where they went
door-to-door in a last-minute
push to increase voter turnout in
the swing state.
Having arrived in Las Vegas
late Friday night, students began
canvassing residential areas of the
city early Saturday morning. The
trip was funded by the political
advocacy group America Coming
Together, or ACT. which sup
ports progressive candidates, in
cluding Sen. John Kerry.
ACT has helped register
100,000 new voters in Las Vegas
alone in the run-up to the elec
tion. Stanford volunteers on Sat
urday visited those voters to re
mind them about the election.
After dividing the city into blocks,
ACT leaders sent trained can
vassers like sophomore Johanna
Sophie Santos Bassetti to visit
specific homes on each block.
Bassetti said she was "feeling a
little scared" before embarking
on her assignment, but after suc
cessfully reaching a potential
voter, she was more energized
than anxious.
"It's stupid to be scared be
cause if you're really scared, then

you probably shouldn't be doing
this." she said.
Many residents were not home
at the time of the visits: several
others had already voted Yet
most residents Bassetti met were
friendly, she said, even though
they had been visited numerous
times b\ previous AC T outreach
efforts or b\ other political advo
cates.
Bv dinnertime Saturday, most
ACT volunteers had completed
their first day's task - each
knocked on over 50 doors, en
couraging residents to vote for
progressive candidates and telling
them where their respective
polling places were.
Some volunteers, however,
were less successful than Bassetti.
Jessica Carilli, a second-year
graduate student, didn't have ver\
much luck on her first day.
"It was harder than I thought it
would be because so many people
were mean," she said. "No one I
talked to was like. 'Because you
said that, now I'm going to go
vote.'"
The difficulty of reaching peo
ple at home also posed a problem.
"Out of 80 people. I 'd say less
than 20 were there." Carilli said.
However, in her opinion, the ef
fort was worth it."I think it's
worthwhile. At least people know
we care." she added.
The Stanford ( ollege Republi
cans opted out of a similar Neva
da campaign trip to focus on the
close State Assembly race be

tween Republican Steve Poizner
and Democrat Ira Ruskin instead.
"We think we can do a lot more
at home right now," said senior
C'app Culver, vice president of
Stanford College Republicans. "I
know a lot of other College Re
publicans are in Vegas, but we're
just working really hard on the
Poizner campaign right now," he
added.
A recent Zogby poll gave Pres
ident George W. Bush a modest
four point lead in Nevada, a state
he won in 2000. Some pollsters
have questioned the accuracy of
nationwide polls like Zogby for
discounting the impact of newly
registered and young voters, since
these polls tend to focus on "like
ly voters" who have a record of
voting and are reachable by land
line telephone.
Voter turnout, especially
among those between the ages of
18 and 2M. many of whom only
have cellular phones, is expected
to skyrocket this year. Pollsters
project a total turnout topping 120
million, a sizeable increase over
the 105 million Americans that
voted in 2000.
Democrats hope that getting
first-time voters to the booth will
be the deciding factor in this elec
tion. Campaign volunteers aren't
taking an\ chances.

cans opted out of a similar Neva
da campaign trip to focus on the
close State Assembly race be

tween Republican Steve Poizner
and Democrat Ira Ruskin instead.
"We think we can do a lot more
at home right now," said senior
C'app Culver, vice president of
Stanford College Republicans. "I
know a lot of other College Re
publicans are in Vegas, but we're
just working really hard on the
Poizner campaign right now," he
added.
A recent Zogby poll gave Pres
ident George W. Bush a modest
four point lead in Nevada, a state
he won in 2000. Some pollsters
have questioned the accuracy of
nationwide polls like Zogby for
discounting the impact of newly
registered and young voters, since
these polls tend to focus on "like
ly voters" who have a record of
voting and are reachable by land
line telephone.
Voter turnout, especially
among those between the ages of
18 and 2M. many of whom only
have cellular phones, is expected
to skyrocket this year. Pollsters
project a total turnout topping 120
million, a sizeable increase over
the 105 million Americans that
voted in 2000.
Democrats hope that getting
first-time voters to the booth will
be the deciding factor in this elec
tion. Campaign volunteers aren't
taking an\ chances.
