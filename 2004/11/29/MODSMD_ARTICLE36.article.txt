## 
### NICK PARKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate meeting on Tuesday, Oct.
12. Assoc. Dean of Students and
Office of Student Activities Direc
tor Naney Howe announced a
change in the policy that previously
barred the Stanford Democrats
from using While Plaza as a staging
area for their phone-banking event
last Sunday.
The campus political group had
planned to call registered, undecid
ed voters in swing states, mainly
Ohio, in support of Democratic
presidential candidate Senator
John Kerry.
The University claimed that fed
eral non-profit regulations did not
allow partisan political groups to
use campus facilities. As a result,
the Democrats were forced to carry
out their "Kerrv Power Hour" <>fl

campus.
The change in policy came after
a threat issued by graduate student
Kai Stinchcombe. president of the
Stanford Democrats, who said he
would sue the University unless it
changed its policy controlling parti
san political activity on campus.
Howe said that recent objections
to Stanford's policy caused the Uni
versity to reconsider and subse
quently change its policy on the
issue. Howe then notified the
ASSU of'the amendment.
"White Plaza has always been a
great student support center of free
speech and freedom of expres
sion." she siiid to the senate. "Htm
ever, revisiting guidelines is ;i good
thing to do
"We are currently in the process
of modifying the White Plaza
guidelines so that all students can
easily understand the rules," Howe
continued "We want to allow all

political groups on campus to ex
press themselves."
Howe said that the old White
Plaza regulations were confusing in
their wording and were routinely
misinterpreted by students. She
added that the new modifications
should clear up the uncertainty.
"We want students to continue
to pass out fliers and set up tables..
in White Plaza, which many peo
ple see as the center of campus
life," Ilowe commented. "We don't
feel that some students should be
banned from White Plaza simply
because their views are not shared
by everyone."
In response to the change,
Stinchconibe said he was "thrilled."
