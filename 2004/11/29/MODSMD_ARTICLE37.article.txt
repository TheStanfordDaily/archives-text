### SAMANTHA FLOAM, SARAH RIZK BEA SANFORD 
Hours after Sen. John Kerry con
ceded defeat in his bid for the presi
dency, many students around campus
were still reeling from the Democrat's
loss to President (ieorge W. Bush.
Emotions among Kerry supporters
ranged from shock and dismay to
frustration and anger, while support
ers of Bush were jubilant at the
prospect of four more years in the
White House.
"The country showed that they be
lieve that the president has provided
good leadership over the last four
years," said junior Bob Sensenbren
ner, president of the Stanford College
Republicans. "It's America who won
on Election night and today."
At dining halls across campus last
night, the election was the topic of
conversation; below are some of the
scenes from dinner tables around
Stanford last night.
Wilbur Marketplace
The prevalent mood in Wilbur Din
ing last niiiht was one of frustration
and dejection. While Democratic ten
dencies were evident. Republicans
appeared notably quiet or absent all
together.
"I'm very disappointed about the
outcome of the election," said fresh
man Francisco Luongo, "I think peo
ple will realize their mistake in four
years."
While still upset, some students
hoped that Bush might alter his tone
in his next term.
"I'm clearly very sad about the out
come of the election, but I'm opti
mistic about the next four years be
cause it can't get much worse," said
junior Andrew Ardinger. "He's ei
ther going to become thoughtful and
centrist, or he's going to kill us all.

Something is going to change."
Many students said that they ex
pected more from the American peo
ple. and hoped that in the future citi
zens would research the issues in
more depth before heading to the vot
ing booth. One international student
urged Americans to examine interna
tional relations more closely.
Although Republicans were scarce,
those found were optimistic about the
future of the country.
"1 am thrilled about the results of
the election and believe the nation
will move forward with Republican
majorities in the House and Senate,"
said freshman Erin Howe.
Democrats and Republicans alike,
however, seemed to agree that the
election had made strong impressions
011 everyone involved.
"I've never seen an election affect
people in such a drastic way," said
freshman Momchil Filev.

Florence Moore Dining I lall
Students at Florence Moore Din
ing Hafl at dinner last night were
somber and stunned as they contem
plated Tuesday's election results.
While there were a handful of satis
fied or apathetic individuals, most
students were generally upset with
the outcome of the presidential race.
Freshman Selena Simmons-Duffin,
a member of the Stanford Democrats,
said she worked hard this quarter reg
istering students to vole.
"I was shocked," she said. "I can
not believe the opportunity to get
Bush out of office has come and
gone."
Some students, like freshman Doug
Wilson, were more optimistic about
the results.
"I think that 1 am not as shell
shocked as most liberal people," he
said. "I don't believe that John Kerry

was the solution anyway. There are a
lot deeper-seated problems that
aren't going to change with just one
politician and just one vote."
Freshman Deonna Hodges said she
was happy just to know that the elec
tion was definitive.
"I am kind of at peace because we
finally know the president of our
country," she said.
Some conservative students, how
ever. felt uncomfortable expressing
their views.
"I am happy with the results, but 1
feel that I have to hold my feelings
back because of the predominantly
liberal views of the school," said
freshman Michael Bury.

Toyon Fating Clubs
Anger and disappointment were
the prevailing emotions last night at
the Toyon Eating Clubs as students
sat down for their first post-election
dinners.
Junior Josh Mendoza said he was
upset at apathy among students.
"1 thought it was sad, because we
go to this liberal school, but [the elec
tion had] the same turnout for college
age voters as in 2000," he said.
Fifth-year co-terminal student
Emily Nahas agreed.
"1 feel wronged," she said. "I was
almost in tears last night, but no one
else seemed to care."
Sophomore Alejandro De Los An
geles criticized Kerry's campaign, ar
guing that it fell shoi t of expectations.
"I was upset." he said. "Kerry had
a chance to be president, but he didn't
capitalize on it."
