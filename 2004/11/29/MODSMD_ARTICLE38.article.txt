### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Californians voted yesterday to
support $3 billion for embryonic stem
cell research over the next 10 years.
Despite touching on hot-button ethi
cal issues and drawing criticism for its
high price tag. Proposition 71 passed
with a healthy 20 percent margin.
The measure could bring tens of
millions of research dollars to Stan
ford and drew strong support from
School of Medicine faculty. Advo
cates pointed to possible cures for ju
venile diabetes, heart disease, Parkin
son's and spinal cord injury. In addi
tion. with President George VV.
Bush's likely reelection, federal fund
ing for stem-cell research is expected
to continue to be low.
Opponents eitcd concerns that
those in charge of distributing the

money might also he on the receiving
end or have other conflicts of interest.
These skeptics also criticized the
measure for creating a $6 billion debt
for the state.
Prop. 71 has had a solid lead in re
cent polls. Still. Dr. Irving Weissman,
director of Stanford's new Institute
for Cancer / Stem Cell Biology and
Medicine, said that he was "always
pessimistic until the last minute."
According to Weissman. a few key
factors led to the proposition's suc
cess: framing the issue as a medical
one, not philosophical oi religious;
the support ol major disease societies;
and a well-organized campaign.
"When Arnold Schwarzenegger
came out in favor of it. 1 think that pret
ty much settled it in," Weissman said.
The state now has 40 days to estab
lish the infrastructure for its Institute
of Regenerative Medicine, which will

supervise the distribution of funds.
Weissman said that he would be push
ing to ensure that those reviewing the
grants would be scientists from out
side the state without any financial
ties to companies that might receive
funding.
"That's the only way to do it to le
gitimately gain the respect of those
providing the funding," he said,
adding that he was optimistic that his
concerns would be addressed. " The
only way it wouldn't happen is if there
were political appointments by those
who are not the leadership that
brought the proposition forward."
Representatives from anti-Prop. 71
campaigns could not be reached for
comment.
