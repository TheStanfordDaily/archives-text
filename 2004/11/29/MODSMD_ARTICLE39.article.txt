### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
Susan Moller Okin, a well-known
feminist thinker and Ethics in Soci
ety professor, died on March 3 at age
57 in her home in Lincoln, Mass. Al
though the cause of death was not re
leased, her ex-husband. Boh Okin.
said that possibilities of suicide and
foul play have been eliminated.
After her arrival at Stanford in
1990, Okin worked to examine the

suppression of the female voice in
Western political thought. Attacking
gender issues from the perspective of
political philosophy, she researched
and published papers evaluating the
role and participation of women in
political arenas. In this spirit she
published three books including
"Women in Western Political
Thought."
"Susan Okin really did revolu
tionize the field of political theory in
that she made it impossible for polit

ical theorists not to ask questions
about justice, gender and the fami
ly," said Robert Reich, an assistant
professor of political science. "She
began from the simple position that
men and women were equals and
that in a just world there would be no
such thing as gender."
According to Okin. women's work
in the domestic sphere largely made
men's accomplishments in the public
sphere possible. She was interested
in how political thought was relevant
to issues of the home and family, es
pecially ideas of law and justice. She
made the case that historical philos
ophy needs to be revisited to reflect
the large influence women had on
the evolution of society.
"Most philosophers treated the
family as a black box and paid little at
tention to the relationships between
individuals within the family," said
Debra Satz, an associate professor of
philosophy. "Okin held that this per
spective was incompatible with the
ideals of liberalism, which views all
human beings as free and equal indi

viduals. She held that relations within
the family were the linchpin of gender
inequality in society."
At the time of her death Okin was
working as a visiting professor at
Harvard University on a one-year
fellowship. She had become interest
ed in looking at evolutionary biology
through a feminist lens.
Okin received many academic
awards during her life, including the
Allan V. Cox Medal for Faculty Ex
cellence in Fostering Undergraduate
Research.
Born in Auckland. New Zealand
in 1946. Okin earned her bachelor's
degree from the University of Auck
land. a master's in philosophy from
Oxford and a doctorate from Har
vard. She served as the director of
the Ethics in Society program from
1993 to 19%.
Okin is survived by her daughter,
son and two sisters.
