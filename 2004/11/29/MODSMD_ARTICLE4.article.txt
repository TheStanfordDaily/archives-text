In his remarks to the approxi
mately 80 community members in

"making the dream possible." He

other project that Arrillaga is finan
cially supporting — the develop
ment of a new recreational athletic
center located on the old Encina
Gym site. The gym's clay roof tiles
were also used to roof the graduate
center.
Arrillaga urged students to re
spect and preserve the new struc
ture.
"Please take care of the build
ing... keep it really special," he said.
He advised students to "think of
|the center| as your own living room,
something that is special in your
heart, because this building is in
mine."

Vice Provost for Student Affairs
Gene Awakuni praised the build
ing's swift development after con
struction started last January. "This
came out of the ground at warp
speed, by University standards," he
said. "To have this built in a year is
unbelievable."
Shirley Everett, associate vice
provost for Residential and Dining
Enterprises, compared the new
building's multi-functionality to
"one-stop shopping . . . it's all right
here," she said.
The center fills a physical need
for Stanford's 7,600-strong graduate
student population. It is expected to

serve as a general hub for student
life with its ample social, academic
and recreational facilities, including
a pub, television room, meeting
space and children's play area.
Roger Stanley, the Graduate Stu
dent Council Deputy Chair and a
second-year student at the Graduate
School of Business, said the center
was worth the wait.
"It's so wonderful to finally see it
come to pass," he said. "This is years
in the making."
