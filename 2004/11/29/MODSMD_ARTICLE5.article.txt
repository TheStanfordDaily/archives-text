## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Mohamed Elßaradei. director general of the Unit
ed Nation's International Atomic Energy Agency, de
livered the annual Drell Lecture yesterday about the
present and future of non-proliferation and arms con
trol.
"According to the newly re-elected President Bush,
nuclear proliferation represents the greatest threat to
international security," Elßaradei said. "Most world
leaders agree on this point, but a fundamental differ
ence of opinion remains on how to deal with the prob
lem."
Elßaradei said that the world has an obligation to
agree on "benchmarks" for non-proliferation and dis
armament. *
"We must make reliance on nuclear weapons obso
lete." he said. "We have to look at nuclear weapons the
same way we look at genocide or slavery - as taboo.
He emphasized the importance of bringing world
wide attention back to nuclear non-proliferation and
forming a plan to achievenuclear disarmament.
"Progress must be made on all fronts — political, sci
entific. and societal," he said. "Collective security is the
starting point. The politicians have an obligation to
form a mechanism for preventive diplomacy, while sci
entists have a responsibility to form an intensive effort
to develop tools for nuclear non-proliferation."
Elßaradei stressed the importance of non-violent,
diplomatic methods throughout his speech. However,
he said that collective preeminent military actions are
necessary in the case of great danger and terrorism. In

all cases, according to Elßaradei, action must be taken
when dealing with nuclear weapons and international

Elßaradei cited North* Korea as
an example of the danger of a lack
of decisive interventions by the se
curity council.
"North Korea was allowed to
withdraw from the international
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
and amass a large supply of nuclear
weapons," he said.
"We have to break down on such
action, and make the treaty apply
equally to all. If you continue to de
velop nuclear weapons, then the in
ternational community will take
measures to make sure you are not
posing a danger to others."
A question-and-answer session
with the audience followed the
speech. One student asked if Elßa
radei had any advice for Bush con

cerning Iran and North Korea.
"We want neither Iran nor North
Korea to have nuclear weapons, nor
any other country, for that matter,"
he answered.
"There is no magic solution to
any crisis, but we need to use incen
tives. provide aid. and assure securi
ty and integration into the interna
tional community."
He also commented on the
lAEA's current relationship with
the United States government con
cerning U.S. insistence on keeping
nuclear weapons.
"We have good cooperation with
the Bush administration." he said.
