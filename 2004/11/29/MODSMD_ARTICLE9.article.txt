## Leading up to ASSU executive election, controversies and lawsuits 
### 
On March 5,2(X)4, the ASSU an
nounced a list of three slates of can
didates running for president and
vice president of the organization:
then-juniors Ajani Husbands and
Alysssa Schwartz; then-senior
Mikey lee and then-junior Dylan
Mefford; and then-senior Charlie
Stockman and then-junior Matthew
Henick.
Then how did Chioke Borgelt-
Mose and Kory Vargas become the
top undergraduate student-elected
officers, you wonder. Read below for
excerpts from Daily stories that ran
between April and May of this year
to find out.
Allegations of campaign violations
fly as election gets underway
l he ASSII presidential election
has stirred up controversy, as the
ASSU Elections Commission now
claims that numerous people have
violated campaign rules since voting
began at midnight on April 6. Al
though the campaign practice code
stipulates that campaigning must
end at the start of voting, several
mass e-mails have been sent endors
ing certain candidates and disparag
ing others.
At I a.m. on April 7. the Senior
( lass presidents sent an e-mail to the
entire senior class endorsing the
Lee-Mefford slate. At 1:18 a.m. on
the same day.the Junior Class presi
dents sent an e-mail to the entire ju
nior class also endorsing the Lee-
Mefford slate.
Shortly after these e-mails were
sent, the ASSU Elections Commis
sion requested that the Junior and
Senior ( lass presidents send another
statement to their class lists instruct
ing them to disregard their previous
endorsement e-mails.
The commission's e-mail reads, in
part, "No students or student groups
can send e-mails out to lists with en
dorsements ol specific candidates

because such students as the Class
presidents who have access to such a
large e-mail list could sway the elec
tion and create an unfair bias."
Less than an hour after their ini
tial e-mail, the Junior Class presi
dents forwarded the commission's
statement to the junior class along
with an apology that claimed they
were unaware that their e-mail vio
lated the campaign practice code.
However, ASSU Assistant Elec
tions Commissioner Alida Garcia, a
junior, claimed that the Senior Class
presidents were more reluctant to
send out an e-mail retracting their
statement because they felt it did not
violate the election rules. They final
ly sent a retraction at 5:37 p.m.

Rodriguez implicated in infraction
Early last night, 11,74b Stanford e
mail addresses received an anony
mous e-mail entitled "The Ugly Side
of the ASSU Election." Sent from a
Yahoo! account with the name
"Stanford TRULY educated voter,"
the e-mail criticized another e-mail
sent to the Diaspora list in support of
the Husbands-Schwartz slate.
Editors in chief of The Chaparral.
Lan Spiro and Steven Yelderman,
both seniors, and current vice presi
dential candidate Matthew Henick,
a junior, uncovered the identity of
the sender of the e-mail.
"The reason why we started in
vestigating the origins of the e-mail
was because we were offended that
the Chappie slate was not mentioned
at all." Henick said.
Although some thought that the
e-mail was affiliated with the candi
dates running for the presidential
election, the actual sender was for
mer ASSU Vice President Nick Ro
driguez, a senior.

Henick, Spiro and Yelderman
traced the IP address to a computer
on the second floor of Meyer and
found the text file with a list of over
II,(XX) email addresses. Though it
appeared the person who had used
the computer had attempted to hide
his actions, the three were able to
find an electronic trail leading to
Nick Rodriguez's dorm room com
puter.
They immediately informed the
ASSU Elections Commission and
Director of Student Activities Nanci
I lowe of their findings.
Although Rodriguez did not con
fess in person immediately, he called
The Daily and then Howe to confess
his sole responsibility for the e-mail.
Rodriguez emphasized that the e
mail was not affiliated with any of
the candidates and that it was written
of his own volition.

Lee-Mefford win; Senate and GSC
to discuss certification of vote in
light of campaign conduct
Though the computer-tallied re
sults of last week's ASSU elections
were announced on Friday evening
at the Coffee House, it could take
several weeks to sort out a messy ex
ecutive race.
The tally showed a clear victory
for the slate of senior Mikey Lee and
junior Dylan Mefford. who bested
junior Ajani Husbands and sopho
more Alyssa Schwartz by over 300
votes. I lowever, the results still need
to be certified by the Undergraduate
Senate and the Graduate Student
Council (GSC), where they could
meet substantial resistance. In par
ticular, ASSU officers will be look
ing into whether a series of illegal e
mails sent to students on behalf of
the Lee-Mefford campaign influ

enced the outcome.
Elections Commissioner Ellie
Martin, a junior, said that certain in
dividuals on the commission might
bring several cases before the Uni
versity to determine whether any re
lated actions violated Stanford Fun
damental Standard. Martin said she
was especially concerned about the
e-mail sent anonymously by former
ASSU Vice President Nick Ro
driguez, a senior. Rodriguez sent the
message - titled "The Ugly Side of
the ASSU" - to 11.746 Stanford e
mail addresses.

Undergraduate Senate again
refuses to certify election
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
voted last night to not certify last
month's executive election fora sec
ond time, this time alleging that e
mails sent to the Class of 2004 group
list endorsing the Lee / Mefford tick
et represented an abuse of power by
senior Mikey Lee, who at the time
was a Senior Class president. With
last week's special-election results
still secret and junior Dylan Mefford
contemplating filing a new suit with
the Constitutional Council, the Sen
ate's decision throws into serious
doubt who will assume executive re
sponsibilities for the ASSU next
year.
The final vote was four in favor of
certification, ten opposed and one
abstaining. The senators opposed to
certification met after the meeting to
draft an official opinion.
'"We found that an abuse of power
led to an avoidable and influential
deviation," the statement read. "In
this case, a candidate actively sought
the endorsement of the Senior Class
presiding body with the intent that
they use their Senior Class president

status to endorse that candidate's
slate to an unsolicited body with in
voluntary membership."

Council approves Lee / Mefford
rejection
The ASSU Constitutional Coun
cil drafted a ruling late last night stat
ing that the Undergraduate Senate's
second refusal to certify last month's
executive election was not unconsti
tutional. as a suit brought by senior
Mikey Lee argued. The decision, the
Council clarified, stemmed largely
from the wording of the suit, and not
necessarily from any shortcomings in
its merits.
Next year's ASSU president and
vice president are still undecided,
however, as the Council must final
ize its decision, the special-election
results must be certified and even
more suits may yet be pending.
Tn the second Constitutional
Council case in two weeks, the Lee
camp argued that the Senate's rea
son for not certifying last month's ex
ecutive election — that the Senior
Class presidents' endorsement of the
Lee/Mefford ticket was an abuse of
power — was unconstitutional be
cause it continued to center around
the issue of freedom of speech and
because "abuse of power" was not
clearly restricted in the ASSU by
laws.

Chiokc-Kory win special election
Sophomores C'hioke Borgelt-
Mose and Kory Vargas Caro are the
winners of the special executive elec
tion, the ASSU Elections Commis
sion announced vesterdav at noon at

the Coffee House.
The final tally had Chioke/Kory
finishing ahead of senior Charlie
Stockman and junior Matthew
Henick of the Chappie slate with
1247 votes to their 805.
"I'm very excited," Borgelt-Mose
said after the election results were
released. "Like everyone else, we're
ready to move on forward from the
drama of last month."
With Chioke/Kory the favorites
going into the contest, the biggest
upset came in the battle for second
place, as the Chappie slate edged out
senior Mikey Lee and sophomore
Alyssa Schwartz with 805 votes to
their 661 in the third elimination
round of the instant runoff voting.
Lee and junior Dylan Mefford
won the first executive election last
month, but the Undergraduate Sen
ate twice refused to certify the re
sults, arguing that e-mails Lee sent to
the Class of 2004 list represented a
violation of the Campaign Practice
Code and an "abuse of power." Mef
ford brought a suit to the ASSU
Constitutional Council, claiming
that the Senate's refusal to certify
the results was unconstitutional be
cause it infringed on free speech
rights.
Mefford won that case, but a suit
brought by Lee after the Senate de
clined to validate the election a sec
ond time was defeated last Sunday,
opening the door for the release of
the special election results.
