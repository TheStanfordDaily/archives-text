# 2004: The Year in Sports
## TEEVENS ERA OVER 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After three years, 10 wins and 23 losses,
head football coach Buddy Teevens was fired
Monday by the University with two years re
maining on his contract. It was a firing that no
one in the program seemed to be particularly
happy about.

Athletic Director Ted Leland said that "my
concern is, what didn't I do, what didn't Stan
ford do, to support a good person like Buddy
Teevens."
Teevens said, 'it's a win-loss business, and I
did not win enough ballgames."
Linebacker Kevin Schimmelman said that
"it's very hard ... [Teevens] put us in the posi
tion to win the games."
The next step for Stanford, Leland said, is to
hire a new head coach. He promised speed as
well as secrecy.
"I probably have a list of 20 names in my of
fice, and. quite frankly, they're the usual sus
pects," Leland said. "The people we will be
looking at have jobs and their own football
family, and we will be invading that, so I want
to be as quiet as possible."
Stanford's next head coach, Leland said,
will be an offensive-minded one. The Cardinal
scored just 19.8 points per game under
Teevens, while allowing 28.3. Stanford was 2-9
in 2002 and 4-7 in 2003 and this year.
The Cardinal actually scored more points
(242) than it allowed (233) this year, as five of
its seven losses were by a touchdown or less
â€” a consolation that Teevens knows doesn't
mean much to fans, boosters and University
officials.
"They really don't care," Teevens said.
"The bottom line is, you win or lose."
Leland is a close friend of Teevens", and
when he submitted his proposal to fire Teevens
to Provost John Etchemendy on Sunday morn
ing, and had it approved, he couldn't help but
think of Tyrone Willingham, whose seven
steelv years at Stanford's helm didn't leave

Teevens with a very malleable program.
"We talked about avoiding a lost group of
athletes [when Teevens was hired) and we
couldn't do it," Leland said. "There was a
group of athletes that played for Tyrone that
couldn't play for Buddy."
Leland thinks it will be different this time
around, and so do the players.
"That's the biggest difference between now
and three years ago," said nose tackle Ba
batunde Oshinowo. who was recruited by Will
ingham but has only played for Teevens.
"When Coach Willingham left, there was a lot
of discord. Through the offseason program we
had [before this season], we definitely built a
strong team concept."
"I really do believe the culture changed,"
Teevens said. "There were things that had to
be built and developed."
Teevens met with his players at 2 p.m. Mon
day, one hour before his termination was offi
cially announced.
"I told the players to rally around and put
winning at Stanford first," Teevens said. "I'm
not a vindictive person and I want what's best.
.. we'd love to see them win a Rose Bowl."
There is no set deadline for hiring a head
coach. Leland said, but Teevens' full staff of as
sistant coaches has been retained so far and
will continue to work on recruiting. Six recruits
are scheduled to visit campus this weekend.
Leland said that the new coach will earn a
"good" but not "exorbitant" salary. Teevens is
believed to be owed approximately $800,000
