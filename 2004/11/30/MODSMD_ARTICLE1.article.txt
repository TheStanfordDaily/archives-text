# 2004: The Year in Sports
## TEEVENS ERA OVER 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After three years, 10 wins and 23 losses,
head football coach Buddy Teevens was fired
Monday by the University with two years re
maining on his contract. It was a firing that no
one in the program seemed to be particularly
happy about.

Athletic Director Ted Leland said that "my
concern is, what didn't I do, what didn't Stan
ford do, to support a good person like Buddy
Teevens."
Teevens said, 'it's a win-loss business, and I
did not win enough ballgames."
Linebacker Kevin Schimmelman said that
"it's very hard ... [Teevens] put us in the posi
tion to win the games."
The next step for Stanford, Leland said, is to
hire a new head coach. He promised speed as
well as secrecy.
"I probably have a list of 20 names in my of
fice, and. quite frankly, they're the usual sus
pects," Leland said. "The people we will be
looking at have jobs and their own football
family, and we will be invading that, so I want
to be as quiet as possible."
Stanford's next head coach, Leland said,
will be an offensive-minded one. The Cardinal
scored just 19.8 points per game under
Teevens, while allowing 28.3. Stanford was 2-9
in 2002 and 4-7 in 2003 and this year.
The Cardinal actually scored more points
(242) than it allowed (233) this year, as five of
its seven losses were by a touchdown or less
— a consolation that Teevens knows doesn't
mean much to fans, boosters and University
officials.
"They really don't care," Teevens said.
"The bottom line is, you win or lose."
Leland is a close friend of Teevens", and
when he submitted his proposal to fire Teevens
to Provost John Etchemendy on Sunday morn
ing, and had it approved, he couldn't help but
think of Tyrone Willingham, whose seven
steelv years at Stanford's helm didn't leave

Teevens with a very malleable program.
"We talked about avoiding a lost group of
athletes [when Teevens was hired) and we
couldn't do it," Leland said. "There was a
group of athletes that played for Tyrone that
couldn't play for Buddy."
Leland thinks it will be different this time
around, and so do the players.
"That's the biggest difference between now
and three years ago," said nose tackle Ba
batunde Oshinowo. who was recruited by Will
ingham but has only played for Teevens.
"When Coach Willingham left, there was a lot
of discord. Through the offseason program we
had [before this season], we definitely built a
strong team concept."
"I really do believe the culture changed,"
Teevens said. "There were things that had to
be built and developed."
Teevens met with his players at 2 p.m. Mon
day, one hour before his termination was offi
cially announced.
"I told the players to rally around and put
winning at Stanford first," Teevens said. "I'm
not a vindictive person and I want what's best.
.. we'd love to see them win a Rose Bowl."
There is no set deadline for hiring a head
coach. Leland said, but Teevens' full staff of as
sistant coaches has been retained so far and
will continue to work on recruiting. Six recruits
are scheduled to visit campus this weekend.
Leland said that the new coach will earn a
"good" but not "exorbitant" salary. Teevens is
believed to be owed approximately $800,000

yesterday after three years on the Farm.
for the two years remaining on his
guaranteed contract.
Despite Stanford's struggles over
the past three seasons, Leland was
adamant that hiring Teevens was not
a mistake.
"Buddy came in with a great pedi
gree, incredible work habits and
shared values, and he gave it his best
shot," he said. "Things just didn't
work out, but in my opinion we chose
the right guy three years ago, and
we'll do the best can to choose the
right guy this time."
Leland also said that the Cardi
nal's performance in Big Game and
the drive to renovate Stanford Stadi
um were not factors in his decision.
"I was much more concerned with
the direction of the program than
with wins and losses," Leland said.
"For me. it was much more the way
(we lost]."
Monday, the University decided
that Teevens was not the right coach
for the Cardinal. But perhaps, as dur
ing his tenure at Tulane, he was the
right recruiter, the right rebuilder.

The players that he recruited went
7-4 under Tommy Bowden in IWB
and 12-0 as Liberty Bowl champions
in 19W.
Stanford's squad this year was sim
ilarly young, with just 11 seniors on
the team, including just one offensive
starter, and once again, Teevens will
have to see if someone else can get the
best out of the players he recruited.
"It's a little bit of deja vu." he ad
mitted. "We had tremendous youth,
and that's because of the unique
ness of Stanford, it's not a quick-fix
with junior-college kids ... I do be
lieve I improved the quality of the
program."
"We have the youngest football
team that we've had in a long time,"
Leland said. "We have a lot more vet
eran. quality players |returningj that
we had after Tyrone."
Teevens hasn't had time to think
about his own future, but he says he
isn't one to stay idle for long.
"I had a wonderful time here at
Stanford," he said. "It's a very, very
special place, and I do believe Stan
ford can have great football success."

hire a new head coach. He promised speed as
well as secrecy.
"I probably have a list of 20 names in my of
fice, and. quite frankly, they're the usual sus
pects," Leland said. "The people we will be
looking at have jobs and their own football
family, and we will be invading that, so I want
to be as quiet as possible."
Stanford's next head coach, Leland said,
will be an offensive-minded one. The Cardinal
scored just 19.8 points per game under
Teevens, while allowing 28.3. Stanford was 2-9
in 2002 and 4-7 in 2003 and this year.
The Cardinal actually scored more points
(242) than it allowed (233) this year, as five of
its seven losses were by a touchdown or less
— a consolation that Teevens knows doesn't
mean much to fans, boosters and University
officials.
"They really don't care," Teevens said.
"The bottom line is, you win or lose."
Leland is a close friend of Teevens", and
when he submitted his proposal to fire Teevens
to Provost John Etchemendy on Sunday morn
ing, and had it approved, he couldn't help but
think of Tyrone Willingham, whose seven
steelv years at Stanford's helm didn't leave

Teevens with a very malleable program.
"We talked about avoiding a lost group of
athletes [when Teevens was hired) and we
couldn't do it," Leland said. "There was a
group of athletes that played for Tyrone that
couldn't play for Buddy."
Leland thinks it will be different this time
around, and so do the players.
"That's the biggest difference between now
and three years ago," said nose tackle Ba
batunde Oshinowo. who was recruited by Will
ingham but has only played for Teevens.
"When Coach Willingham left, there was a lot
of discord. Through the offseason program we
had [before this season], we definitely built a
strong team concept."
"I really do believe the culture changed,"
Teevens said. "There were things that had to
be built and developed."
Teevens met with his players at 2 p.m. Mon
day, one hour before his termination was offi
cially announced.
"I told the players to rally around and put
winning at Stanford first," Teevens said. "I'm
not a vindictive person and I want what's best.
.. we'd love to see them win a Rose Bowl."
There is no set deadline for hiring a head
coach. Leland said, but Teevens' full staff of as
sistant coaches has been retained so far and
will continue to work on recruiting. Six recruits
are scheduled to visit campus this weekend.
Leland said that the new coach will earn a
"good" but not "exorbitant" salary. Teevens is
believed to be owed approximately $800,000


Head football coach Buddy Teevens was let go
yesterday after three years on the Farm.
for the two years remaining on his
guaranteed contract.
Despite Stanford's struggles over
the past three seasons, Leland was
adamant that hiring Teevens was not
a mistake.
"Buddy came in with a great pedi
gree, incredible work habits and
shared values, and he gave it his best
shot," he said. "Things just didn't
work out, but in my opinion we chose
the right guy three years ago, and
we'll do the best can to choose the
right guy this time."
Leland also said that the Cardi
nal's performance in Big Game and
the drive to renovate Stanford Stadi
um were not factors in his decision.
"I was much more concerned with
the direction of the program than
with wins and losses," Leland said.
"For me. it was much more the way
(we lost]."
Monday, the University decided
that Teevens was not the right coach

right recruiter, the right rebuilder.

The players that he recruited went
7-4 under Tommy Bowden in IWB

Stanford's squad this year was sim
ilarly young, with just 11 seniors on
the team, including just one offensive
starter, and once again, Teevens will
have to see if someone else can get the
best out of the players he recruited.

team that we've had in a long time,"
Leland said. "We have a lot more vet

isn't one to stay idle for long.
"I had a wonderful time here at
Stanford," he said. "It's a very, very
special place, and I do believe Stan

The Cardinal's 4-7 season was characterized by a series of dramatic come
backs and missed opportunities.
After three years, 10 wins and 23 losses,
head football coach Buddy Teevens was fired
Monday by the University with two years re
maining on his contract. It was a firing that no
one in the program seemed to be particularly
happy about.

Athletic Director Ted Leland said that "my
concern is, what didn't I do, what didn't Stan
ford do, to support a good person like Buddy
Teevens."
Teevens said, 'it's a win-loss business, and I
did not win enough ballgames."
Linebacker Kevin Schimmelman said that
"it's very hard ... [Teevens] put us in the posi
tion to win the games."
The next step for Stanford, Leland said, is to
