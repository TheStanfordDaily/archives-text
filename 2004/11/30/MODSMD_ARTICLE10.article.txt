Though the Auburn women's
swimming and diving squad left
College Station, Texas, last week
with its third national title in hand,
Stanford senior Tara Kirk left the
NCAA Championships just as
content as any of the Tigers.
Kirk returned to the Farm with
NCAA Swimmer of the Year hon
ors — making her the fourth Car
dinal woman to win the award —
along with her 10th and 11th
NCAA titles. She completed her
college career with a perfect 35-0
mark in the 100-yard breaststroke.
She was a part of a solid Cardinal
team that finished the meet in fifth
place — one spot above its 2003
finish.
Oh yeah, and she broke a world
record.
Kirk's 1:04.79 finish in the 100
breast — which was her fourth
consecutive national title in the
event — smashed the world record
set in 2003 by Leisel Jones of Aus
tralia (1:05.09) and was the perfect
cap to Kirk's illustrious Stanford
career.
"I don't think I could have had
a better ending [to my college ca
reer]," said Kirk, a possible 2004
Olympian. "This is one more thing
that I can say I've accomplished
that's really satisfying."
Kirk's world record was easily
the highlight of the Champi
onships for the Cardinal, but the
team showed depth and strength
in many events that led to its
fifth-place finish, just behind sec
ond-place Georgia, Arizona and
Florida.
Stanford kicked off competi
tion on March 18 with a second
place finish in a hard-fought 400
medley relay race.
Kirk and her younger sister,
sophomore Dana Kirk, teamed
up with juniors Lacey Boutwell
and Tami Ransom to clock in at
3:58.00, less than two seconds be
hind the winning team from
Georgia.
Boutwell touched at a personal
best 25.23 in the 50 freestyle fora
seventh place finish in the event,
making her Stanford's top scoring

individual swimmer on the first
day.
Junior diver Ashlee Rosenthal
finished in seventh in the 1-meter
springboard with a final score of
287.15, improving on her eighth
place finish at the 2003 NCAAs.
Alison Brennan of South Car
olina took top honors in the 1-
meter, racking up 307.20 points in
the finals.
Spectators got quite a show on
Friday, as they not only witnessed
Kirk's 100 meter shocker, but saw
California senior Natalie Coughlin
capture her fourth consecutive win
in both the 100 butterfly and 100
backstroke.
Coughlin and Kirk are two of
only four swimmers in history to
win the same event four straight
years at NCAAs.
Dana Kirk finished in second
behind Coughlin in the 100 fly with
a time of 57.16, a personal best for
the sophomore.
The Cardinal, which entered
the day in fifth place, had another
successful medley relay race on the
second day, hitting the wall in time
fora third-place finish. The Kirk
sisters combined with senior
Megan Baumgartner and junior
Sarah Jones on the effort.
Stanford did not compete in the
final rounds for half of the day's
events, which pushed the Cardinal
down a slot in the team standings
to sixth going into the third day.
The elder Kirk raced to victory
in the 200 breast for the 19th
straight time, clocking in at 2:20.70,
an American record.
Boutwell also added key points
to the team's total, touching the
wall at 54.49 in the 100 free, good
enough for third place.
Dana Kirk had another person
al best in her second fly race, the
200-meter, ending in fourth place
with a time of 2:06.54.
Freshman Lauren Costella won
the consolation final of the 1500
free to add points to the Cardinal
score and sophomore diver Sara
Bowling earned 413.60 points and
a seventh-place finish for her per
formance on the platform.
Kaitlin Sandeno of Southern
California garnered the highest in
dividual point total in the meet
with 57. with Coughlin just behind
at 56.
Auburn swimmers Kirsty
Coventry and Margaret Hoelzer
each managed 54 to tie for third.
The NCAA meet completes the
season for the Cardinal, which
held a No. 5 ranking heading into
the competition.
Stanford ended the year with a
5-2 dual meet record.
