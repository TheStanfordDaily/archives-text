The Cardinal rolled into Berkeley Satur
day seeking a tremendous upset. But they
never found the end /one and lost their com
posure in the second half.
By the time the dust settled on the over
cast, windy afternoon matchup. No. 4 Cali
fornia stood on the strong side of a 41-6
score.
Stanford ended the season with its fifth
consecutive loss, while the Bears earned
their fifth straight victory. It was by far the
Cardinal's worst loss of the season — as well
as their worst Big Game loss since they were
defeated 41-0 all the way hack in 1930.
" Phis one certainly was embarrassing,"
head coach Buddy Teevens said.
There were few positive words spoken by
Stanford after the game, and understandably
so. After playing 30 minutes of inspired de
fense against the Pacific-10 Conference's
top-ranked offense, the Cardinal self-de
structed in the second half, allowing four
touchdowns and committing several blatant
ly intentional personal fouls. Meanwhile, the
Stanford offense managed just 180 yards of
offense in 58 plays against the Pac-lO's sec
ond-ranked defense.
Despite Saturday's loss — which, it
should be remembered, did come at the
hands of one of the nation's best teams — it's
clear that Stanford is a better team this year
than last. But it will nonetheless finish with
the same record (4-7, 2-6 Pac-10) as that
squad.
"1 guess to everyone else, we are the same
team [as last year]," receiver Evan Moore
said. "The way things were going at the end is
just disgusting. Four-and-seven is not gonna
cut it, especially at a university like this that
can get the very best athletes."
Cal (9-1, 7-i), of course, is most certainly

not the same team it was last year.
Barring a catastrophic upset at the hands
of Southern Miss, the Golden Bears are a
lock for the Rose Bowl — which sent three
officials to watch Big Game — and could still
move up to the national championship game
if two of Oklahoma, Auburn and Southern
California should falter.
Aaron Rodgers was a very quiet 11-of-14
passing for 120 yards and a touchdown, but
Pac-10 rushing leader J.J. Arrington ran 27
times for 169 yards and a touchdown, Mar
shawn Lynch had 122 yards on just nine
carries plus a trick-play touchdown pass,
and Geoff Mac Arthur had a game-high five
catches for 47 yards.
"Arlington and Lynch are very, very tal
ented players and Rodgers plays well within
the system," Teevens said. "They're smart
with the football, they're balanced, they're
consistent, they play well as a group."
Arrington broke Chuck Muncie's single
season rushing record of 1.460 yards. Geoff
Mac Arthur broke Dameane Douglas'career
record of 195 receptions and Cal set a school
record for average attendance while going
unbeaten at Memorial Stadium for the first
time since 1950. Arrington also extended his
school-record streak of 10 consecutive 100-
yard games.
While Cal was shattering age-old records,
Stanford was struggling against familiar
problems.
The Cardinal gained just 24 yards on 30
carries, including minus-10 yards on 12 sec
ond-half rushes. The predictable passing
game (another deep out, anyone?) failed to
fool Cal's defenders, who deflected 10 of the
26 passes T.C Ostrander threw.
Ostrander, starting again for the injured
Trent Edwards, connected on 8-of-26 throws
for 148 yards, while taking six sacks. No re
ceiver had more than two catches.
"They brought a variety of blitzes, it was
plenty loud out there, it was hard to commu
nicate and they were mixing up their cover
ages," Ostrander said. "[But) we did not ex

ecute as well as we should have."
It was a sloppy game all around, and the
Pac-10 officiating crew didn't help matters.
In total. Stanford was penalized 14 times for
126 yards, while Cal was flagged 12 times for
102 yards.
"The refs were being overly sensitive,"
said linebacker David Bergeron, one of 11
seniors who played his final game for Stan
ford. "They started calling stuff that happens
in every Pac-10 game every weekend for 15-
yard flags."
Penalties hurt the Cardinal on Cal's first
drive of the second half. Holding just a 10-3
lead. Cal drove 71 yards fora field goal, 30
yards of which came thanks to Stanford per
sonal fouls.
"We're far more disciplined than those
[penalties] showed," Teevens said. "Emo
tions certainly took over on both sides of the
game with the personal fouls."
Stanford's next drive stalled on its own
42-yard line, and Cal responded quickly, as
Lynch slipped a tackle in the backfield, cut
up the left sideline, slipped another tackle
and won a footrace to the right corner of the
end zone to put Cal up 20-3 late in the third
quarter.
The Cardinal came back with a 10-play.
52-yard drive ending in a 44-yard Michael
Sgroi field goal, his second in two tries. But
Cal would need only seven rushes (and nary
a pass play) to go 87 yards and take a 27-6
lead with 12:53 remaining in the final period.
"They started running the zone play and
cutting it back to a gap we didn't have cov
ered." Bergeron said. "Schematically, they
did a great job."
Later in the fourth, Reggie Robertson
had a five-yard touchdown run and Burt
Toler caught Lynch's 20-yard pass for the
final Cal score.
Cal scored first in the game, as Tim Mixon
returned a punt 51 yards and Rodgers con
nected with Robert Jordan on a 29-yard
touchdown 6:45 into the game. Tom Schnei
der and Sgroi traded field goals to complete

the first-half scoring.
With the season over, Teevens now must
turn his efforts toward recruiting, while Ath
letic Director Ted Leland will review the
performance of the team and its coaches, as
he does after each sport's season concludes.
Alston endorsed Teevens. saying that
"Coach Teevens has been nothing but great
to me. He's one of the nicest people I've ever
met. I'd like to see him back, but I know
that's not my place to comment."
Said Teevens, signed through 2006: "I'm
under contract. I expect to [and] I want to [be
retained]."

For everyone involved, though, it was a
painful end to what seemed such a promising
season when the Cardinal was 4-2 overall
and 2-1 in Conference following a win at
Washington State
But, after a series of narrow, frustrating
losses, the year came to an end in Berkeley
with a blowout.
"People wanna act like. oh. it's okay, you
guys were a little bit closer this year, but
that's not a winning attitude," Moore said, 'i
hope that's not a consolation to everyone
that we were close, because that's not good
enough."
