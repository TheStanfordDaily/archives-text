Cardinal plow through BYU in 37-10 victory
STANFORD - Less than 12 minutes into Sat
urday's game, the Stanford football team found
itself facing a 10-0 deficit against Brigham
Young, having yielded 123 yards while rushing
for minus-38 yards and managing just one pass
completion during its first three possessions.
Head coach Buddy Teevens and the Cardi
nal had definitely been there before. Where
they went next, though, was unknown territory.
After the Matt Payne field goal that put the
Cougars up 10-0 late, junior cornerback T.J.
Rushing responded with an impressive, 99-yard
kickoff return fora touchdown. The Cardinal
would score six more times while holding
Brigham Young scoreless for the final 47 min
utes, propelling Stanford to a 37-10 victory and
a 2-0 record.
"I was never worried when they were up 10-
0," Teevens said. "I knew we had things we
were capable of doing."
Quarterback Trent Edwards threw for 297
yards and three touchdowns, tailback J.R.
Lemon racked up 97 yards of total offense and
kicker Michael Sgroi connected on three field
goals. The offensive stars of the day, though,
were the receivers.
Tight end Alex Smith had six catches for 87
yards, including a second-quarter touchdown
that put Stanford up, 14-10. Making that TD
possible was an incredible 76-yard reception by
Mark Bradford, who caught a short pass in the
flat and eluded three different packs of Cougars
before finally being dragged out of bounds.
"We knew they were pretty poor tacklers,"
Edwards said. "If you could get them to miss
once..."
'i think he grew up a little bit today,"
Teevens said of his signalcaller, who set career
highs for passing yards, touchdowns and pass
attempts. "He executed well and showed some
toughness."

Stanford nearly upends defending national
champion Trojans
Oh. the things that could've been.
The Stanford football team took a stunning.
28-17 halftime lead against top-ranked South
ern California Saturday at Stanford Stadium
but came up tantalizingly short in the end. los
ing to the defending national champions, 31 -28.
It was an impressive evening, all in all. for
the Cardinal, who entered the game a 22-point
underdog and fell behind 10-0 in the first quar
ter. But the tears in the eyes of the Stanford
players and the head coach's steely gaze
showed that the Cardinal were not content with
a moral victory.
"I want them to be real disappointed with

the loss," head coach Buddy Teevens said. "We
had an opportunity to beat a real good football
team, and we lost."
Nonetheless, the Cardinal pushed the Tro
jans (4-0, 1-0 Pacific-10 Conference) all over the
football field for the last 20 minutes of the first
half, outscoring them 28-7 over that stretch. The
Cardinal (2-1,0-1) outclassed the most-respect
ed team in the nation, running up the score
thanks to smarts, skill and determination.
"We played really well fora quarter-and-a
half," said quarterback Trent Edwards, who
completed 20-of-26 passes before the break.
"But a football game isn't a quarter-and-a-half
long."

Cardinal overcome missteps to top
Washington, 27-13 at home.
It wasn't always pretty, but the Cardinal did
exactly what they were supposed to do Satur
day at Stanford Stadium.
The Cardinal came into Saturday's game at
Stanford Stadium favored to win by two touch
downs. and they did exactly that, defeating
Washington, 27-13.
Junior tailback J.R. Lemon rushed fora ca
reer-high 162 yards and three touchdowns, in
cluding a 58-yard scoring run in the first quar
ter, and the special teams blocked two punts,
one of which Nick Sanchez returned for Stan
ford's final touchdown.
The big plays helped offset a mistake-filled
day for the Cardinal. Trent Edwards threw
three interceptions. Lemon lost a fumble,
Michael Sgroi missed an extra point and the
team committed eight penalties totaling 77
yards.
"This was the ugliest game I think I've ever
seen, and unfortunately 1 coached in it," head
coach Buddy Teevens said. "I told the guys to
take some satisfaction in the fact that we played
poorly and still came out on top."
The win was critical for the Cardinal (3-1. 1-
1 Pacific-10 Conference), who could hardly af
ford to drop a home game to the Pac-10's lone
win less team.

Little mistakes destroy Cardinal against
Notre Dame
SOUTH BEND. Ind. — As they have in ever>'
one of their games this season, the Cardinal
held a halftime lead here Saturday.
For the second time in three weeks, though,
they gave that lead away, falling to Notre
Dame, 23-15.
"Anytime you're going into halftime with the
other team's head between their legs, you've
gotta beat them." defensive end Julian Jenkins
said. "It's like having the mouse in the trap and
letting him out fora little bit and he escapes."
The Fighting Irish (4-2) outscored the Car
dinal (3-2) in the second half. 20-9. despite out

gaining Stanford by just three yards. Stanford
made little mistakes along the way — a dropped
pass here, a penalty there — before eventually
being toppled thanks to a big mistake: a fum
bled punt that led to Notre Dame's go-ahead
touchdown with 12 minutes remaining in the
fourth quarter.
Of course, a 6-3 halftime deficit isn't exactly
an insurmountable obstacle fora veteran team
playing in front of 80,795 enthusiastic fans. But
for Stanford, that was the point — it didn't have
to be just 6-3.
On its first drive. Stanford marched to the
Irish 9-yard line, but ended up settling fora 27-
yard Michael Sgroi field goal. On its next drive.
Stanford drove 75 yards in just 2:26, but
couldn't push it in from first-and-goal on the
Irish 7-yard line, settling fora 20-yard field
goal.
"The difference [in the game] may have
been that we didn't put the ball in the end zone
in the first half," said receiver Evan Moore. "In
stead of 6-0 it could've been 14-0."
Moore, the first receiver for whom quarter
back Trent Edwards looks, caught five passes
for 72 yards but couldn't get open in the red
zone against double coverage. No other Cardi
nal receiver could, either, as the Cardinal were
held without a passing touchdown for the sec
ond straight week.
Still, a halftime lead is a halftime lead and
Stanford began the second half with a lot of
confidence.
"We had the game in our hands," Edwards
said, "and we weren't able to put it away."

Bruins blank Stanford 21-0 in L.A.
LOS ANGELES — Stanford has played
tremendous defense all season long, and Satur
day's game was no exception. The Cardinal
held the powerful UCLA offense to its second
lowest point total of the season, allowing just
two scores in 14 offensive drives.
Unfortunately for Stanford — and its wan
ing bowl hopes — the Cardinal offense would
n't reach the red zone until the end of the fourth
quarter. It managed just four drives of 30 or
more yards, with each such drive ending in an
interception or a turnover on downs.
The end result was a 21-0 loss for the Cardi
nal (4-4, 2-3 Pacific-10 Conference), which lost
by more than a touchdown for the first time all
year, and an inspiring shutout for the Bruins (5-
3,3-2). their first in the Pac-10 since 1987.
The worst part of it was.the Bruins dared
Stanford to attack their biggest weakness.
UCLA entered the game allowing 227.3 rush
ing yards per game, but throughout the game,
they dropped five men back in pass coverage.
"They dared us to run the ball, and we could
n't." Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens said.
In the passing game, they had extra guys in
coverage."
Stanford managed just 83 rushing yards on 33
carries, which made it a long afternoon for quar
terback Trent Edwards and his wide receivers.
