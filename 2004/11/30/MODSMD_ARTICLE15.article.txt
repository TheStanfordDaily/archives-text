NORMAN, Okla. — The magical
run is over. The Nicole Powell era is
over. The Stanford women's basket
ball team's up-and-down season has
come to a heart-breaking close at the
hands of Tennessee, a team which the
Cardinal just can't seem to close out.
The top overall seed in the
NCAA Women's Basketball Tour
nament, Tennessee extended its
dominance over the sixth-seeded
Stanford women, defeating the Car
dinal, 62-60, to advance to yet an
other Final Four appearance — and
it took yet another controversial call
to do it.
After defeating Baylor in the
Sweet Sixteen on free throws with
0.2 seconds on the clock, the Lady
Vols seemed to get away with an of
fensive foul that put junior guard
Kelley Suminski on the ground with
under a minute left, setting the stage
fora Tasha Butts three, putting
Tennessee in the lead.
Senior forward Nicole Powell,
however, was able to answer back

with an off-balance, one-handed
runner in the lane to tie the ball
game with 44 seconds remaining on
the clock.
Stanford came up with the de
fensive stop it needed, but the re
bound was swatted off the hands of
senior center Chelsea Trotter, giv
ing Tennessee another opportunity
to take the lead.
Butts caught an inbounds pass
and worked one-on-one against
Powell, wrapping around the taller,
slower Powell fora layup from the
left block to put Tennessee up by
two with 1.7 seconds remaining.
On the final play. Powell caught
a perfect baseball pass from junior
forward T'Nae Thiel and was able
to get off a final shot. The shot was
on line, but hit the front of the rim.
There was contact with two Lady
Vols on the shot, but no foul was
called.
"Nothing was going to be
called," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "But I don't
think it boils down to that one play.
Even with 1.7 seconds, we had a
good shot."
The game was possibly most
heart-breaking for Powell. Powell
played an amazing two halves, fin
ishing with 31 points, 10 rebounds
and two blocks on 14-of-24 shooting
from the field.
"That's what was missing - a
win," Powell said. "We played real
ly tough, but they made the plays
that count."
