When Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer. who has coached 766
NCAA basketball games, opens a
press conference by saying, "That
was a really strange game," there
must have been some pretty weird
stuff going on.
The No. 12 Stanford women's
basketball team (24-6) shot just
31.6 percent and was outrebound
ed, 44-32, but still managed to
overcome a 16-point deficit to No.
2 seed Arizona (24-8) to take home
the Pac-10 Tournament title, 51-46,
and the automatic NCAA Tourna
ment bid that goes with it.
Despite playing from behind for
nearly the entire game, the sea
soned Cardinal squad was able to
weather a red-hot start from the
Wildcats and convert when it came
down to crunch time.
"What helps with experience is
that you know you're never out of
it, " said junior guard Kelley Sumin
ski. "We're worried about the out
come of the game, but we knew
we'd come around. Basically, we
just had to step up and start playing
the way we played all season."
