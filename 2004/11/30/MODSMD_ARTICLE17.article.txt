SEATTLE. Wash. — A little over two weeks ago, in
the same city that the top-seeded Cardinal lost its first
game of the season to Washington. then-No. 1 Stanford
(30-2) racked up its second and final loss of the year, a 70-
67 upset by eighth-seeded, unranked Alabama in the sec
ond round of the NCAA Tournament.
More importantly and perhaps most devastatingly for
Stanford fans, for the second time in three weeks, a Stan
ford fairy tale ended in Seattle.
And, in reality, it had all the makings of a fairy tale —
all the drama and intrigue and seemingly ironic story
lines — an almost-perfect season with the potential to
make a return trip to San Antonio for the Final Four.
But it didn't end that way. Instead, the Cardinal failed to
advance past the round of 32 for the third consecutive year.
This particular ending — during this particular season
finale — stung a bit more than the sites and sounds of U
dub fans rushing the courts at Hec Edmundson Pavilion,
the first blemish on a season that had been, up until that
point, blemish-free.
"It's very difficult to gain some perspective from this
game when we are hurting so badly, and to try to put into
perspective what we've accomplished this year," said
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery as he struggled
to find his words. "I can't really help them through that."
"I'm angry," junior swingman Josh Childress added.
"I'm angry and disappointed."
After an even opening period in which the Cardinal
found itself up by two at the half, 39-37, Stanford clawed
its way to a 13-point second half lead with eight minutes
left to play, holding the Crimson Tide to l-of-17 shooting
for the opening 12 minutes of the period.
And then the unthinkable happened — the tide
turned — and Stanford went cold.
Alabama scored 16 consecutive points over the next 4
1 / 2 minutes to take the lead, 56-53, and Childress picked
up his fifth foul and was forced to watch the remaining
three minutes from the bench. Childress finished with 12
points and seven boards in what might be his final game
in a Stanford uniform.
The Cardinal came within one-point of the Crimson
Tide when sophomore forward Matt Haryasz converted
a fastbreak layup just under the two-minute mark, bring
ing the score to 58-57 in favor of Alabama.
"We were down but I never thought it had slipped
away," Childress said. "They hit their free throws, which
was unfortunate for us, but I [never] felt like it slipped
away."
But Stanford never took the lead as the Cardinal
missed three attempts from the field during a critical 40-
second stretch in which the Tide converted six free throws
to extend its lead to seven with 46 seconds left to play.
Senior shooting guard Matt Lottich hit a pair of 3-point
ers with less than 30 seconds remaining and senior forward
Justin Davis converted a putback to bring the Cardinal
back within three points with 7.2 seconds on the clock.
Then. Alabama guard Earnest Shelton missed a pair
of free throws on the other end with 5.6 seconds left on
the clock, allowing the Cardinal one more chance to tie.

to pull off another last second miracle.
Stanford forward Nick Robinson pushed the hall up
court and found sophomore shooting guard Dan Grun
feld on the wing.
But Grunleld's shot came up just short as he fell to the
ground in disappointment.
"I thought it had a chance," said a disappointed Grun
feld. "At that point you're hoping a little hit. When I let
it go it was in the vicinity."
And when it was all over — when the dust had settled,
after various Alabama players pumped their fists in the
air in celebration, cheering along with their fans, after
the Key Arena crowd was emptied and silent — after all
of that, Stanford was left to reminisce, once again, about
a run that ended prematurely in Seattle, about its season,
the streak, "the second round jinx," how far they had
come and all that team chemistry and camaraderie that
had sustained this team for so long.
After all that reminiscing, the Cardinal will be forced
to try to pick up the pieces, to confront the reality of the
situation and. perhaps most importantly, convince itself
that there are dreams left to chase, that maybe, just
maybe, that this loss is just another page, another twist,
in the eventual fairy tale — that there are still "happy
endings" left to achieve.


Stanford guard Chris Hernandez and the No. 1 Cardinal
shocked the nation with their loss to unranked Alabama.

After all that reminiscing, the Cardinal will be forced

endings" left to achieve.


Stanford guard Chris Hernandez and the No. 1 Cardinal
shocked the nation with their loss to unranked Alabama.

SEATTLE. Wash. — A little over two weeks ago, in
the same city that the top-seeded Cardinal lost its first
game of the season to Washington. then-No. 1 Stanford
(30-2) racked up its second and final loss of the year, a 70-
67 upset by eighth-seeded, unranked Alabama in the sec
ond round of the NCAA Tournament.
More importantly and perhaps most devastatingly for
Stanford fans, for the second time in three weeks, a Stan
ford fairy tale ended in Seattle.
And, in reality, it had all the makings of a fairy tale —
all the drama and intrigue and seemingly ironic story
lines — an almost-perfect season with the potential to
make a return trip to San Antonio for the Final Four.
But it didn't end that way. Instead, the Cardinal failed to
advance past the round of 32 for the third consecutive year.
This particular ending — during this particular season
finale — stung a bit more than the sites and sounds of U
dub fans rushing the courts at Hec Edmundson Pavilion,
the first blemish on a season that had been, up until that
point, blemish-free.
"It's very difficult to gain some perspective from this
game when we are hurting so badly, and to try to put into
perspective what we've accomplished this year," said
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery as he struggled
to find his words. "I can't really help them through that."
"I'm angry," junior swingman Josh Childress added.
"I'm angry and disappointed."
After an even opening period in which the Cardinal
found itself up by two at the half, 39-37, Stanford clawed
its way to a 13-point second half lead with eight minutes
left to play, holding the Crimson Tide to l-of-17 shooting
for the opening 12 minutes of the period.
And then the unthinkable happened — the tide
turned — and Stanford went cold.
Alabama scored 16 consecutive points over the next 4
1 / 2 minutes to take the lead, 56-53, and Childress picked
up his fifth foul and was forced to watch the remaining
three minutes from the bench. Childress finished with 12
points and seven boards in what might be his final game
in a Stanford uniform.
The Cardinal came within one-point of the Crimson
Tide when sophomore forward Matt Haryasz converted
a fastbreak layup just under the two-minute mark, bring
ing the score to 58-57 in favor of Alabama.
"We were down but I never thought it had slipped
away," Childress said. "They hit their free throws, which
was unfortunate for us, but I [never] felt like it slipped
away."
But Stanford never took the lead as the Cardinal
missed three attempts from the field during a critical 40-
second stretch in which the Tide converted six free throws
to extend its lead to seven with 46 seconds left to play.
Senior shooting guard Matt Lottich hit a pair of 3-point
ers with less than 30 seconds remaining and senior forward
Justin Davis converted a putback to bring the Cardinal
back within three points with 7.2 seconds on the clock.
Then. Alabama guard Earnest Shelton missed a pair
of free throws on the other end with 5.6 seconds left on
the clock, allowing the Cardinal one more chance to tie.

to pull off another last second miracle.
Stanford forward Nick Robinson pushed the hall up
court and found sophomore shooting guard Dan Grun
feld on the wing.
But Grunleld's shot came up just short as he fell to the
ground in disappointment.
"I thought it had a chance," said a disappointed Grun
feld. "At that point you're hoping a little hit. When I let
it go it was in the vicinity."
And when it was all over — when the dust had settled,
after various Alabama players pumped their fists in the
air in celebration, cheering along with their fans, after
the Key Arena crowd was emptied and silent — after all
of that, Stanford was left to reminisce, once again, about
a run that ended prematurely in Seattle, about its season,
the streak, "the second round jinx," how far they had
come and all that team chemistry and camaraderie that
had sustained this team for so long.
After all that reminiscing, the Cardinal will be forced
to try to pick up the pieces, to confront the reality of the
situation and. perhaps most importantly, convince itself
that there are dreams left to chase, that maybe, just
maybe, that this loss is just another page, another twist,
in the eventual fairy tale — that there are still "happy
endings" left to achieve.
