NORMAN. Okla. —When the
Stanford women's basketball team
(29-6) received its draw from the
NCAA Selection Committee,
things looked bleak.
A No. 6 seed in the Midwest,
where the Cardinal would be
lumped behind overall No. 1 seed
Tennessee, red-hot Oklahoma —
many pundits' dark horse pick to
reach the Final Four — and SEC
Tournament Champ Vanderbilt.
Stanford, however, played with
a huge chip on its shoulder and used
the Selection Committee's snub to
advance to the Elite Eight yester
day, defeating Vanderbilt in the

Sweet Sixteen, 57-55, on a three
pointer by junior Kelley Suminski
with 0.3 seconds on the clock.
The Cardinal jumped out to a
nine-point halftime lead behind the
brilliant first half play of Nicole
Powell. Powell, who had a double
double within 12 minutes of tipoff.
orchestrated the Stanford offense
to perfection.
Stanford broke down the Com
modores' patented matchup zone
defense with ease in the first 20
minutes, shooting an astounding
61.9 percent from the field in the
first half, including 6-for-10 from
long range.
Powell finished the first half
with 14 points, 11 rebounds and six
assists, but what may have been
more important than the All-
American's stellar play was the
ability of her teammates to step up.
In the first half, junior forward
T'Nae Thiel and junior guard Seb
nem Kimyacioglu chipped in with
six points apiece, while Suminski
had four.
In the second half, however, it
seemed as though an entirely dif
ferent team took the floor. The
Cardinal shot just 26.9 percent
from the floor in the second half on
7-of-26 shooting.
Powell, who was 5-of-8 from the
field in the opening half, did not
convert a single field goal in the
second half, going 0-of-8.
Additionally, the crowd turned
on the Cardinal squad — which
had knocked* out hometown Okla
homa in the second round — and
on Powell in particular. After Pow
ell fouled freshman Dee Davis on a
breakaway and Davis did not im
mediately get up, the crowd began
to boo Powell on every touch.
"In the second half it was just
tough to get open shots," Powell
said. " I had a couple of good looks
I didn't knock down and frankly. I
made some awful turnovers. But
it's a team game."
Vanderbilt capitalized on the
Stanford's cold shooting - and fast.
Within two minutes of the start of
the second half, the Commodores
cut the Cardinal's lead to just three
points, and with 16:24 remaining.
Vandermilt tied the ballgame on a
Jenni Benningfield layup.
"Vanderbilt was playing a lot

more aggressively in the second
half," said senior center Chelsea
Trotter, who chipped in three
points and two assists. "We had our
was in the first half, but they really
stepped it up a notch in the second
half. The intensity level skyrocket
ed and fora while they were dictat
ing the pace of the game."
Despite its poor second-half
shooting performance. Stanford
managed to stay in the game with
its defense.
The Cardinal held Vanderbilt
to 41.5 percent shooting on the
game and limited Benningfield.
the Commodores' All-America
candidate to 11 points on 4-of-13
shooting.
Stanford also won the rebound
ing battle, 33-28. which proved key,
as it was able to limit Vanderbilt's
second chance opportunities.
Despite the Cardinal's outstand
ing defense and rebounding, the
Commodores were able to build a
55-52 lead with just 2:37 on the
clock.
And after 2:06 of scoreless ball
by both teams, Powell was able to
work herself to the line, drawing a
foul on Hillary Hagcr.
Powell coolly sank both free
throws and the Commodores got
the ball back with 43.1 seconds to

Stanford, however, employed its
outstanding defense once again and
forced a 30-second shot clock viola
tion to regain possession with 11.2
seconds on the clock, setting the
stage for Suminski's heroics.
Predictably, it was Powell who
took the ball up the court for the
Cardinal.
And predictably, Powell drove
to the hoop, attempting to get by
her defender with a spin move.
Instead, she drew a tough dou
ble team, but rather than force the
shot, she wisely found a wide-open
Suminski just behind the 3-point
arc. who drained the game-winner.
"We were looking for Nicole to
get the last shot," said Suminski. "1

slide behind her in case someone
went to [double-team], and they
did. She made a great pass and I
don't really know what happened
after that."

Stanford got some last-second hero
ics in its key Sweet 16 victory.

NORMAN. Okla. —When the
Stanford women's basketball team
(29-6) received its draw from the
NCAA Selection Committee,
things looked bleak.
A No. 6 seed in the Midwest,
where the Cardinal would be
lumped behind overall No. 1 seed
Tennessee, red-hot Oklahoma —
many pundits' dark horse pick to
reach the Final Four — and SEC
Tournament Champ Vanderbilt.
Stanford, however, played with
a huge chip on its shoulder and used
the Selection Committee's snub to
advance to the Elite Eight yester
day, defeating Vanderbilt in the

Sweet Sixteen, 57-55, on a three
pointer by junior Kelley Suminski
with 0.3 seconds on the clock.
The Cardinal jumped out to a
nine-point halftime lead behind the
brilliant first half play of Nicole
Powell. Powell, who had a double
double within 12 minutes of tipoff.
orchestrated the Stanford offense
to perfection.
Stanford broke down the Com
modores' patented matchup zone
defense with ease in the first 20
minutes, shooting an astounding
61.9 percent from the field in the
first half, including 6-for-10 from
long range.
Powell finished the first half
with 14 points, 11 rebounds and six
assists, but what may have been
more important than the All-
American's stellar play was the
ability of her teammates to step up.
In the first half, junior forward
T'Nae Thiel and junior guard Seb
nem Kimyacioglu chipped in with
six points apiece, while Suminski
had four.
In the second half, however, it
seemed as though an entirely dif
ferent team took the floor. The
Cardinal shot just 26.9 percent
from the floor in the second half on
7-of-26 shooting.
Powell, who was 5-of-8 from the
field in the opening half, did not
convert a single field goal in the
second half, going 0-of-8.
Additionally, the crowd turned
on the Cardinal squad — which
had knocked* out hometown Okla
homa in the second round — and
on Powell in particular. After Pow
ell fouled freshman Dee Davis on a
breakaway and Davis did not im
mediately get up, the crowd began
to boo Powell on every touch.
"In the second half it was just
tough to get open shots," Powell
said. " I had a couple of good looks
I didn't knock down and frankly. I
made some awful turnovers. But
it's a team game."
Vanderbilt capitalized on the
Stanford's cold shooting - and fast.
Within two minutes of the start of
the second half, the Commodores
cut the Cardinal's lead to just three
points, and with 16:24 remaining.
Vandermilt tied the ballgame on a
Jenni Benningfield layup.
"Vanderbilt was playing a lot

more aggressively in the second
half," said senior center Chelsea
Trotter, who chipped in three
points and two assists. "We had our
was in the first half, but they really
stepped it up a notch in the second
half. The intensity level skyrocket
ed and fora while they were dictat
ing the pace of the game."
Despite its poor second-half
shooting performance. Stanford
managed to stay in the game with
its defense.
The Cardinal held Vanderbilt
to 41.5 percent shooting on the
game and limited Benningfield.
the Commodores' All-America
candidate to 11 points on 4-of-13
shooting.
Stanford also won the rebound
ing battle, 33-28. which proved key,
as it was able to limit Vanderbilt's
second chance opportunities.
Despite the Cardinal's outstand
ing defense and rebounding, the
Commodores were able to build a
55-52 lead with just 2:37 on the
clock.
And after 2:06 of scoreless ball
by both teams, Powell was able to
work herself to the line, drawing a
foul on Hillary Hagcr.
Powell coolly sank both free
throws and the Commodores got
the ball back with 43.1 seconds to
g°
Stanford, however, employed its
outstanding defense once again and
forced a 30-second shot clock viola
tion to regain possession with 11.2
seconds on the clock, setting the
stage for Suminski's heroics.
Predictably, it was Powell who
took the ball up the court for the
Cardinal.
And predictably, Powell drove
to the hoop, attempting to get by
her defender with a spin move.
Instead, she drew a tough dou
ble team, but rather than force the
shot, she wisely found a wide-open
Suminski just behind the 3-point
arc. who drained the game-winner.
"We were looking for Nicole to
get the last shot," said Suminski. "1
saw her penetrating and I went to
slide behind her in case someone
went to [double-team], and they
did. She made a great pass and I
don't really know what happened
after that."
