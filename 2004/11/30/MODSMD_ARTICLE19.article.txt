## Powell paves the way for Card 
### EMILY KUEHLER SENIOR STAFF WRIER 
This story originally appeared in The Daily on Feb. l l ),2004.
In conversations about the nation's best women's col
lege basketball player, you often hear the names of
Diana Taurasi and Alana Beard. But that conversation is
simply unfinished without mention of Stanford senior
forward Nicole Powell.
Maybe it's the "East-Coast media.bias." Maybe it's
Stanford's recent lack of success in the NCAA Tourna
ment. Maybe it's because the Cardinal doesn't have the
ESPN headquarters in its backyard, but it just doesn't
seem like Powell gets the respect she deserves.
The forward - well, that's not completely accurate
because the fo-foot-2 Powell is versatile enough to play
all five positions on the court â€” has entirely rewritten
the Stanford record books. She ranks in the top 10 in
seven different categories and is currently second be
hind Val Whiting in total rebounds and fourth in total
points.
Had it not been fora bulging disc that kept her out of
nine games last season and a sprained ankle that kept her
out of action for three games this season, she would prob
ably be Stanford's all-time leader in both categories.
Powell's list of honors and accomplishments is almost
endless. She is a two-time Ail-American, the 2002 Pacif
ic* 10 Conference Player of the Year and the only player
in Pac-10 history to have recorded multiple triple-dou
bles (she has six to her name). She has played for several
U.S. junior national teams (most recently in this sum
mer's Pan-Am Games), has been named a Wade Trophy
and Naismith Award finalist and it just goes on from
there.
Powell has seemingly done it all.
However, like that conversation that includes only
Beard and Taurasi, Powell's Cardinal career is unfin
ished thus far. She has yet to play on a team that has ad
vanced deep into the NCAA Tournament and, with her
time at Stanford winding down, making that March Mad
ness run is at the top of her list of priorities.
"It would be disappointing not to do well." Powell
said. "(A championship] was one of the reasons I came
here. I just don't know how I'll feel when it's all over if we
don't do well."
And while the NCAA Tournament is certainly one of
Powell's biggest concerns, even more pressing are this
weekend's games against Southern California and
UCLA because the Pac-10 race has turned into a much

tighter contest than any preseason pollster could have
imagined.
So close, in fact, that the Cardinal will he battling it
out lor first place with the Trojans tonight.
With the conference crown still up for grabs. Powell
has not even had a chance to think about leaving her
mark in her last two games at Maples Pavilion.
"[Saturday] will be a special day. but to be honest I
haven't really thought about it." she said. "Maybe it will
set in when I play. But 11his weekend's! games are really
