Not one for superstition, the top
ranked Stanford women's tennis team
(29-0) had no qualms about capturing
its 13th NCAA Team Championship
with a 4-1 victory over No. 8 UCLA
(19-8) yesterday.
No. 23 junior Erin Burdette (25-4)
brought fans to their feet at Dan Mag
ill Tennis Complex as she sealed suc
cess for Stanford with an overhead
smash against the Bruins' Feriel Es
seghir (14-14).
Burdette won the decisive No. 3
singles match in straight sets, pulling
out the first set win in a tiebreaker and
coming to a resounding finish in the
second. 7-6 (5), 6-3.
"It's a fairy-tale ending to come
home and play in front of family and
friends," said Burdette in a press re
lease. "1 didn't play my best today, but
I was able to pull through and get it
done."
Stanford head coach Lele Forood
provided more insight into the crucial
victory.
"[Esseghir's] a tough player when
she's against the wall in a match."
Forood said. "Erin was up 5-2, 40-15

in the second set. hut (Esseghir] stuck
it out to force another game. She picks
her moments to he particularly good."
Stanford defeated UCLA three
times in the regular season, including
a stellar 6-1 win in the quarterfinals of
National Team Indoors in February.
"When you play a team for the
fourth time in a year, everybody has so
much information about each other
that this final didn't have a lot of the
problems that [it normally would]
when faced with a newer opponent,"
Forood said. "But we knew UCLA
wasn't exactly going to cave, either.
They have a lot of good players and
they're really solid despite our
(match] scores against them."
Fresh off a 4-0 shutout of fifth
seeded Clemson in the semifinals and
with nothing to lose. No. 9 seed
UCLA gave Stanford a run for its
money on every court, starting with a
nail-biting showdown in doubles.
"It was very scary for about 15 min
utes, as the No. 1 and No. 3 doubles
teams were down really far and No. 2
doubles was on par with their oppo
nents," freshman Theresa Logar said.

Bamikow and Burdette claimed
the doubles point for the Cardinal
with an 8-6 win.
"We had Erin serving to finish,
which is exactly where we wanted
to be," Forood said. "We went into
the locker room all charged up. It's
real nice to have that momentum
and a 1-0 lead going into the sin
gles."
At No. 2 doubles, sophomores
Alice Barnes and Amber Liu were
the first off the courts with an un
precedented 8-3 defeat of No. 43
Jackie Carleton and Esseghir (13-
8).
During the regular season,
Barnes and Liu (24-4) had strug
gled at No. 2 against UCLA, drop
ping the decision all three times.

But on Sunday, the Cardinal
pounced on every ball, getting ex
actly the shots it needed to manage
a huge win.
In singles. No. 10 Barnes went 3-
0 during the week to be named the
NCAA tournament's Most Out
standing Player.
"Alice was basically doing her
thing and outmatching all of her op
ponents," Forood said.
In semifinal action, Barnes
helped the Cardinal sweep third
seeded Vanderbilt, topping No. 61
Kelly Schmandt in straight sets at
No. 2 singles, 6-2, 6-2. Against the
Commodores, her characteristic
sliced backhand and finesse game
were key in her game-winning
match.
Barnes enjoyed similar results in
the quarterfinals against Duke, the

seventh seed. The 5-foot-9 Cam
bridge, U.K., native made quick
work of No. 112 Jennifer Zika, al
lowing her only three games in a 6-
1,6-2 conquest.
Barnes is one of four regional
automatic qualifiers into the
NCAA Individual Championships.
She enters the next phase of
NCAAs with an impressive 37-6
record.
Hand in hand with her more ex
perienced teammates — Barnikow,
Burdette and Liu — Logar received
a berth into the individual competi
tion after just one season of colle
giate play. And what a season it's
been — the No. 40 freshman went
undefeated in the regular season,
only to top off her fifth-flight singles
successes with five straight-set wins
at NCAAs.
