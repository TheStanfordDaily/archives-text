Not one for superstition, the top
ranked Stanford women's tennis team
(29-0) had no qualms about capturing
its 13th NCAA Team Championship
with a 4-1 victory over No. 8 UCLA
(19-8) yesterday.
No. 23 junior Erin Burdette (25-4)
brought fans to their feet at Dan Mag
ill Tennis Complex as she sealed suc
cess for Stanford with an overhead
smash against the Bruins' Feriel Es
seghir (14-14).
Burdette won the decisive No. 3
singles match in straight sets, pulling
out the first set win in a tiebreaker and
coming to a resounding finish in the
second. 7-6 (5), 6-3.
"It's a fairy-tale ending to come
home and play in front of family and
friends," said Burdette in a press re
lease. "1 didn't play my best today, but
I was able to pull through and get it
done."
Stanford head coach Lele Forood
provided more insight into the crucial
victory.
"[Esseghir's] a tough player when
she's against the wall in a match."
Forood said. "Erin was up 5-2, 40-15

in the second set. hut (Esseghir] stuck
it out to force another game. She picks
her moments to he particularly good."
Stanford defeated UCLA three
times in the regular season, including
a stellar 6-1 win in the quarterfinals of
National Team Indoors in February.
"When you play a team for the
fourth time in a year, everybody has so
much information about each other
that this final didn't have a lot of the
problems that [it normally would]
when faced with a newer opponent,"
Forood said. "But we knew UCLA
wasn't exactly going to cave, either.
They have a lot of good players and
they're really solid despite our
(match] scores against them."
Fresh off a 4-0 shutout of fifth
seeded Clemson in the semifinals and
with nothing to lose. No. 9 seed
UCLA gave Stanford a run for its
money on every court, starting with a
nail-biting showdown in doubles.
"It was very scary for about 15 min
utes, as the No. 1 and No. 3 doubles
teams were down really far and No. 2
doubles was on par with their oppo
nents," freshman Theresa Logar said.
Heading the doubles lineup, the
top-ranked duo of senior Lauren
Barnikow and Burdette battled back
from a 5-3 deficit against Daniela
