# Infielder Ash carries on the legacy his father began as a Cal Golden Bear

From the moment his father
held him for the first time. Jonny
Ash was supposed to play baseball.
Wil Ash, a self-proclaimed part
time accountant and full-time base
ball coach, picked up his newborn
son on September 11. 19K2, and
said, "You'll be a shortstop, a sec
ond baseman, go to law school or
medical school, and after that you
can make up your own mind."
Growing up in Oakland, Calif.,
Stanford's soft-spoken senior third
baseman — a converted middle in
fieldcr — was also supposed to go
to school at California.
After all, his prescient father,
who used a tennis racquet to teach
right-handed Jonny to swing left
handed at the Castro Valley courts
when he was three, and coached
him until high school, was a catcher
for the Bears from 1 c >7l -73.
"I was always at the Cal alumni
games with my dad and worked out
on the field a lot when 1 was in high
school." Ash said. "I guess from
birth I was supposed to go to Cal.
My dad says if you'd prick me I'd
still bleed Bear blue."
Hut Ash ultimately chose to
wear Cardinal red.
Ash earned All-State honors as
a shortstop and led his team to
back-to-back league champi
onships at Bishop O'Dowd High
School, where he batted an as
tounding .598 during his senior sea

son. In hindsight, the impetus for
his decision to cross the Bay and by
pass the familiarity of Berkeley and
his father's legacy at C'al is clear.
"I'm a competitor and 1 love
being the best." Ash said. "I love
winning and when it's all said and
done, Stanford's better academi
cally and it has a better baseball
program as far as I'm concerned."
Still, the choice was a difficult
one.
"It was harder on Jonny [than on
me|," said his father, who batted
.228 and hit four home runs during

his career at Cal. "He wanted logo
to Cal because I went to Cal I told
him. That was then, this is now.'"
"He was very supportive of my
decision to go to Stanford because
he knew that it was what I wanted."
Ash said. "I le wanted me to be my
own person, my own individual and
seek my own path."

as one of Stanford's toughest outs

this, his final season on the Farm,
Ash's path at Stanford has not al
ways been smooth.
Used primarily as a designated
hitter. Ash started 25 games and hit
.327 as a freshman, but vying for
time in the field behind senior
standout Chris O'Riordan the fol
lowing year. Ash was used exclu
sively as a pinch-hitter and saw
only 24 at-bats.
"It was a blessing in disguise,"
his father said." It made him a man.
It just wasn't his time and it chal
lenged him even harder."
Ash leaned heavily on his dad
that season, as he has throughout his
career and life, for matters that
stretch beyond the game of baseball.
"In terms of being there for me,
he's been my coach, my spiritual
advisor, my mentor and my psy
chologist," said Ash of Wil, whose
own father died when he was 13.
" He's really probably the only per
son who can get inside my head and
get me ready to play the game.
Whether I'm sitting on the bench
waiting fora chance to play or out
there everyday, he knows how to
keep me going."
Evidencing the tough skin that
comes with being the quintessen
tial coach's son, and no ill effects
from a season spent predominantly

Ash owns .500 average
in games against Cal

on the bench. Ash made the most
of his opportunity to play everyday
last year.
Making the transition to third
base, he batted .314 in 47 starts and
hit one of the most memorable
home runs in Stanford history — a
two-run blast off Cal State-Fuller
ton's flame-throwing closer, Chad
Cordero, to propel the Cardinal to
a 7-5 comeback victory over the Ti
tans and a spot in the Champi
onship Series.
Incidentally, the home run was
the first of Ash's career. His sec
ond came two days later.
Offseason hours in the weight
room have paid off at the plate this
season, as Ash has already set new
career highs for home runs (four)
and runs scored (40) and is on pace
to shatter his previous bests in
nearly every other major offensive
category. Ash is second on the
team with a .383 average, boasts
the best strikeout-to-at-bat ratio of
any Cardinal regular and is a large
reason Stanford is off to one of its
best starts in school history.
"He's just so consistent and I
know what I'm going to get from
him," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "I have a lot of re
spect for him because he really did
have such a tough sophomore

year."
As he takes the field for the first
game of his last series against Cal
tonight, it is unlikely that any re
grets about choosing Stanford will
creep into Ash's mind.
The Cardinal is 9-0 against the
Bears in games that he has started.
Mere coincidence? Not when you
consider Ash's impressive .500 av
erage (19-for-38) in those games,
including eight straight multiple
hit games against the Bears. Ash
tallied seven hits to go along with
six runs in a three-game sweep at
Berkeley in late February.
"There's a little something extra
inside me when I go out and play
against Cal," Ash said.
And a little extra special to
watch for his father, who doesn't
hesitate when asked whether he or
his son is the better player.
"No question he is," he said. "I
didn't work as hard. He has far sur
passed his old man. and I'm very
proud of that. I've had more highs
coaching Jonny than I ever had as a
player."
Once upon a time, Jonny Ash
was supposed to go to Cal. Four
years after the fact, it's clear: He is
right where he is supposed to be,
helping Stanford win games, and
no small thanks to his dad.

the first of Ash's career. His sec
ond came two days later.
Offseason hours in the weight
room have paid off at the plate this
season, as Ash has already set new
career highs for home runs (four)
and runs scored (40) and is on pace
to shatter his previous bests in
nearly every other major offensive
category. Ash is second on the
team with a .383 average, boasts
the best strikeout-to-at-bat ratio of
any Cardinal regular and is a large
reason Stanford is off to one of its
best starts in school history.
"He's just so consistent and I
know what I'm going to get from
him," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "I have a lot of re
spect for him because he really did
have such a tough sophomore

year."
As he takes the field for the first
game of his last series against Cal
tonight, it is unlikely that any re
grets about choosing Stanford will
creep into Ash's mind.
The Cardinal is 9-0 against the
Bears in games that he has started.
Mere coincidence? Not when you
consider Ash's impressive .500 av
erage (19-for-38) in those games,
including eight straight multiple
hit games against the Bears. Ash
tallied seven hits to go along with
six runs in a three-game sweep at
Berkeley in late February.
"There's a little something extra
inside me when I go out and play
against Cal," Ash said.
And a little extra special to
watch for his father, who doesn't
hesitate when asked whether he or
his son is the better player.
"No question he is," he said. "I
didn't work as hard. He has far sur
passed his old man. and I'm very
proud of that. I've had more highs
coaching Jonny than I ever had as a
player."
Once upon a time, Jonny Ash
was supposed to go to Cal. Four
years after the fact, it's clear: He is
right where he is supposed to be,
helping Stanford win games, and
no small thanks to his dad.
I'his story originally appeared in
The Daily on Apr. 16, 2004.
From the moment his father
held him for the first time. Jonny
Ash was supposed to play baseball.
Wil Ash, a self-proclaimed part
time accountant and full-time base
ball coach, picked up his newborn
son on September 11. 19K2, and
said, "You'll be a shortstop, a sec
ond baseman, go to law school or
medical school, and after that you
can make up your own mind."
Growing up in Oakland, Calif.,
Stanford's soft-spoken senior third
baseman — a converted middle in
fieldcr — was also supposed to go
to school at California.
After all, his prescient father,
who used a tennis racquet to teach
right-handed Jonny to swing left
handed at the Castro Valley courts
when he was three, and coached
him until high school, was a catcher
for the Bears from 1 c >7l -73.
"I was always at the Cal alumni
games with my dad and worked out
on the field a lot when 1 was in high
school." Ash said. "I guess from
birth I was supposed to go to Cal.
My dad says if you'd prick me I'd
still bleed Bear blue."
Hut Ash ultimately chose to
wear Cardinal red.
Ash earned All-State honors as
a shortstop and led his team to
back-to-back league champi
onships at Bishop O'Dowd High
School, where he batted an as
tounding .598 during his senior sea

son. In hindsight, the impetus for
his decision to cross the Bay and by
pass the familiarity of Berkeley and
his father's legacy at C'al is clear.
"I'm a competitor and 1 love
being the best." Ash said. "I love
winning and when it's all said and
done, Stanford's better academi
cally and it has a better baseball
program as far as I'm concerned."
Still, the choice was a difficult
one.
"It was harder on Jonny [than on
me|," said his father, who batted
.228 and hit four home runs during

his career at Cal. "He wanted logo
to Cal because I went to Cal I told
him. That was then, this is now.'"
"He was very supportive of my
decision to go to Stanford because
he knew that it was what I wanted."
Ash said. "I le wanted me to be my
own person, my own individual and
seek my own path."

as one of Stanford's toughest outs

Ash's path at Stanford has not al

Used primarily as a designated
hitter. Ash started 25 games and hit
.327 as a freshman, but vying for
time in the field behind senior
standout Chris O'Riordan the fol

only 24 at-bats.

his father said." It made him a man.
It just wasn't his time and it chal

Ash leaned heavily on his dad
that season, as he has throughout his
career and life, for matters that
stretch beyond the game of baseball.
"In terms of being there for me,
he's been my coach, my spiritual
advisor, my mentor and my psy
chologist," said Ash of Wil, whose
own father died when he was 13.
" He's really probably the only per
son who can get inside my head and
get me ready to play the game.
Whether I'm sitting on the bench
waiting fora chance to play or out
there everyday, he knows how to
keep me going."

of his opportunity to play everyday
last year.

base, he batted .314 in 47 starts and

home runs in Stanford history — a
two-run blast off Cal State-Fuller

Cordero, to propel the Cardinal to
a 7-5 comeback victory over the Ti
