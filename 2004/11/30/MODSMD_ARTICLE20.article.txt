From the moment his father
held him for the first time. Jonny
Ash was supposed to play baseball.
Wil Ash, a self-proclaimed part
time accountant and full-time base
ball coach, picked up his newborn
son on September 11. 19K2, and
said, "You'll be a shortstop, a sec
ond baseman, go to law school or
medical school, and after that you
can make up your own mind."
Growing up in Oakland, Calif.,
Stanford's soft-spoken senior third
baseman — a converted middle in
fieldcr — was also supposed to go
to school at California.
After all, his prescient father,
who used a tennis racquet to teach
right-handed Jonny to swing left
handed at the Castro Valley courts
when he was three, and coached
him until high school, was a catcher
for the Bears from 1 c >7l -73.
"I was always at the Cal alumni
games with my dad and worked out
on the field a lot when 1 was in high
school." Ash said. "I guess from
birth I was supposed to go to Cal.
My dad says if you'd prick me I'd
still bleed Bear blue."
Hut Ash ultimately chose to
wear Cardinal red.
Ash earned All-State honors as
a shortstop and led his team to
back-to-back league champi
onships at Bishop O'Dowd High
School, where he batted an as
tounding .598 during his senior sea

son. In hindsight, the impetus for
his decision to cross the Bay and by
pass the familiarity of Berkeley and
his father's legacy at C'al is clear.
"I'm a competitor and 1 love
being the best." Ash said. "I love
winning and when it's all said and
done, Stanford's better academi
cally and it has a better baseball
program as far as I'm concerned."
Still, the choice was a difficult
one.
"It was harder on Jonny [than on
me|," said his father, who batted
.228 and hit four home runs during

his career at Cal. "He wanted logo
to Cal because I went to Cal I told
him. That was then, this is now.'"
"He was very supportive of my
decision to go to Stanford because
he knew that it was what I wanted."
Ash said. "I le wanted me to be my
own person, my own individual and
seek my own path."
While he has established himself
as one of Stanford's toughest outs
and a bona fide everyday starter in
