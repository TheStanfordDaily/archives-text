# 'Lightning D' dominates diamond
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This story originally appeared in
The Daily on Apr. 16.2004.
It's hard to believe that in
2000, a righthander wearing the
number 12 was stepping into the
circle in Cardinal red for the first
time. A true freshman out of San
Diego, Calif.. Dana Sorensen was
thrown into her role on the Stan
ford Softball squad a bit by chance
— injuries on the pitching staff
eventually landed her 211 2 / 3 in
nings of playing time over the
course of the year.
Maybe a lesser competitor
would have faltered under the

pressure.
But for four years now, the
number 12 has become synony
mous with words like "power",
"strikeout" and "victory" —
hence Sorensen "s nickname:
"Lightning D."
Now in her fifth year on the
Farm and her fourth on the field,
Sorensen has developed from the
highly-touted high school hurler
that Stanford head coach John
Rittman said he was lucky to sign
into an ace that will top the pro
gram's record books for years to
come.
"We knew we had a blue chip
pitcher [when we signed
Sorensen)," Rittman said. "She's
been an integral part of the pitch

ing staff since the beginning."
Sorensen was throwing light
ning bolts from day one with the
Cardinal, and anyone who thought
she couldn't duplicate her shocking
freshman season — which fea
tured a 22-9 record, lf>4 strikeouts
and a 1.06 ERA — was silenced by
the season that followed.
As a sophomore, Sorensen led
the Cardinal to its first-ever Col
lege World Scries appearance
that year, starting three of the
four games in Oklahoma City.
She demolished Stanford's single
season strikeouts record - the old
record of 186 was set just two
years before Sorensen racked up
-295. The righty also set new records
for single-season ERA (0.64) and
victories in a season (27) despite
suffering hack injuries that kept her
from playing for three weeks.
Unfortunately for Sorensen. the
injury problems didn't stop after
that season.
She suffered an ACL tear in her
junior year that forced her to red
shirt the season.
"Everyone makes fun of me be
cause 1 did it skateboarding, not on
the field." Sorensen said good-na
turedly about her freak run-in with
a longboard.
The injury, which unluckily af
fected Sorensen's push-off leg, re
quired two surgeries and substantial
rehabilitation and caused her to
wonder if she could rebound from
the setback.
" I was out for six to eight months
and that really makes you question.
Are you going to be the same pitch
er?'" Sorensen said. "I couldn't
even walk for four weeks. [Coming
back| took a lot of patience and
time."
Sorensen's determination paid
off in the end and 2003 was an even
more pleasant surprise than 2001
had been for Stanford fans.
The single-season strikeout
record than she had set her sopho
more year toppled once again as she
slapped 332 strikeouts into the
record books.
"She's just inspiring," said senior

Hurler drafted by
MLB-aftliated league

Jessica Allister. who has been
catching Sorensen for four years.
"She's out there every day working
hard."
By the end of last season,
Sorensen had rocketed into Stan
ford's number one spot for career
ERA (0.93), career victories (71)
and career strikeouts (796. a good
distance from former Cardinal
Becky Blevins' 595 mark.)
This season, Sorensen has put
her five pitches to work in 164 in
nings, 68 innings more than any
other pitcher on the Cardinal staff.
She attributes her current 19-5
record in part to the experience that
she and Allister have as a pitcher
catcher duo.
"We know each other so well —
there are no surprises," Sorensen
said. "She knows the way I pitch
and helps me set up batters, and it's
really a comfort."
Allister added that setting up
batters when Sorensen is pitching is
a simple task for her: "She has the
upper-hand. [Batters] know what to
expect from her, they've seen the
scouting reports, but she can still
overpower them."
With her I,oooth career strikeout
and 18 complete games already on
the scorebooks this season.
Sorensen is focused on getting the
Stanford squad back to the College
World Series.
"[Sorensen] is one of the most
competitive people I know." Allis-

ter said. "There's nothing she wants
to do more than win, and that pro
jects onto the team."
The kind of leadership that
Sorensen has provided will be
missed next season, when the ASA
Player of the Year candidate is at
the University of North Carolina
pursuing a graduate degree in
sports administration.
"I'm going to climb the ranks of
collegiate sports on the administra
tion side of things." Sorensen said.
Of course. Stanford won't be the
last place that she steps into a
pitcher's circle.
Sorensen and Allister have both
been drafted to the New England
Riptide, one of the six teams gear
ing up for the inaugural three
month season of the National Pro
Fastpitch league. Other pro softball
leagues have formed and folded
over the years, but hopes for the
NPF are high, as it is affiliated with
Major League Baseball.
As these new prospects draw
nearer, Sorensen hopes that the
four years that her number 12
graced the circle at Stanford will re
mind her teammates that the
game's value will always be in the
sheer joy of competing.
"This is the game, play it for what
it's worth." she said. "It's been so
fun to be here for five years, on the
field or not."

Righthander Dana Sorensen's success in the circle can be partially credited to her strong relationship with Stanford

Righthander Dana Sorensen's success in the circle can be partially credited to her strong relationship with Stanford
catcher Jessica Allister. The duo has been setting up hitters together for four years on the Farm.
This story originally appeared in
The Daily on Apr. 16.2004.
It's hard to believe that in
2000, a righthander wearing the
number 12 was stepping into the
circle in Cardinal red for the first
time. A true freshman out of San
Diego, Calif.. Dana Sorensen was
thrown into her role on the Stan
ford Softball squad a bit by chance
— injuries on the pitching staff
eventually landed her 211 2 / 3 in
nings of playing time over the
course of the year.
Maybe a lesser competitor
would have faltered under the

pressure.
But for four years now, the
number 12 has become synony
mous with words like "power",
"strikeout" and "victory" —
hence Sorensen "s nickname:
"Lightning D."
Now in her fifth year on the
Farm and her fourth on the field,
Sorensen has developed from the
highly-touted high school hurler
that Stanford head coach John
Rittman said he was lucky to sign
into an ace that will top the pro
gram's record books for years to
come.
"We knew we had a blue chip
pitcher [when we signed
Sorensen)," Rittman said. "She's
been an integral part of the pitch

ing staff since the beginning."
Sorensen was throwing light
ning bolts from day one with the
Cardinal, and anyone who thought
she couldn't duplicate her shocking
freshman season — which fea
tured a 22-9 record, lf>4 strikeouts
and a 1.06 ERA — was silenced by
the season that followed.
As a sophomore, Sorensen led
the Cardinal to its first-ever Col
lege World Scries appearance
that year, starting three of the
four games in Oklahoma City.
She demolished Stanford's single
season strikeouts record - the old
record of 186 was set just two
years before Sorensen racked up
-295. The righty also set new records
for single-season ERA (0.64) and
victories in a season (27) despite
suffering hack injuries that kept her
from playing for three weeks.
Unfortunately for Sorensen. the
injury problems didn't stop after
that season.
She suffered an ACL tear in her
junior year that forced her to red
shirt the season.
"Everyone makes fun of me be
cause 1 did it skateboarding, not on
the field." Sorensen said good-na
turedly about her freak run-in with
a longboard.
The injury, which unluckily af
fected Sorensen's push-off leg, re
quired two surgeries and substantial
rehabilitation and caused her to
wonder if she could rebound from
the setback.
" I was out for six to eight months
and that really makes you question.
Are you going to be the same pitch
er?'" Sorensen said. "I couldn't
even walk for four weeks. [Coming
back| took a lot of patience and
time."
Sorensen's determination paid
off in the end and 2003 was an even
more pleasant surprise than 2001
had been for Stanford fans.
The single-season strikeout
record than she had set her sopho
more year toppled once again as she
slapped 332 strikeouts into the
record books.
"She's just inspiring," said senior

Hurler drafted by
MLB-aftliated league

Jessica Allister. who has been
catching Sorensen for four years.
"She's out there every day working
hard."
By the end of last season,
Sorensen had rocketed into Stan
ford's number one spot for career
ERA (0.93), career victories (71)
and career strikeouts (796. a good
distance from former Cardinal
Becky Blevins' 595 mark.)
This season, Sorensen has put
her five pitches to work in 164 in
nings, 68 innings more than any
other pitcher on the Cardinal staff.
She attributes her current 19-5
record in part to the experience that
she and Allister have as a pitcher
catcher duo.
"We know each other so well —
there are no surprises," Sorensen
said. "She knows the way I pitch
and helps me set up batters, and it's
really a comfort."
Allister added that setting up
batters when Sorensen is pitching is
a simple task for her: "She has the
upper-hand. [Batters] know what to
expect from her, they've seen the
scouting reports, but she can still
overpower them."
With her I,oooth career strikeout
and 18 complete games already on
the scorebooks this season.
Sorensen is focused on getting the
Stanford squad back to the College
World Series.
"[Sorensen] is one of the most
competitive people I know." Allis-

ter said. "There's nothing she wants
to do more than win, and that pro
jects onto the team."
The kind of leadership that
Sorensen has provided will be
missed next season, when the ASA
Player of the Year candidate is at
the University of North Carolina
pursuing a graduate degree in
sports administration.
"I'm going to climb the ranks of
collegiate sports on the administra
tion side of things." Sorensen said.
Of course. Stanford won't be the
last place that she steps into a
pitcher's circle.
Sorensen and Allister have both
been drafted to the New England
Riptide, one of the six teams gear
ing up for the inaugural three
month season of the National Pro
Fastpitch league. Other pro softball
leagues have formed and folded
over the years, but hopes for the
NPF are high, as it is affiliated with
Major League Baseball.
As these new prospects draw
nearer, Sorensen hopes that the
four years that her number 12
graced the circle at Stanford will re
mind her teammates that the
game's value will always be in the
sheer joy of competing.
"This is the game, play it for what
it's worth." she said. "It's been so
fun to be here for five years, on the
field or not."
