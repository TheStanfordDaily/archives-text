It's hard to believe that in
2000, a righthander wearing the
number 12 was stepping into the
circle in Cardinal red for the first
time. A true freshman out of San
Diego, Calif.. Dana Sorensen was
thrown into her role on the Stan

Now in her fifth year on the
Farm and her fourth on the field,
Sorensen has developed from the

the season that followed.
As a sophomore, Sorensen led
the Cardinal to its first-ever Col

that year, starting three of the
four games in Oklahoma City.
She demolished Stanford's single
season strikeouts record - the old
record of 186 was set just two
years before Sorensen racked up
