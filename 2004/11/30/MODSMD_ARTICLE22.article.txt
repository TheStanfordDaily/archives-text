Junior placekicker Michael
Sgroi knows what it's like to be
frustrated.
Alter a promising freshman
season in which he made 5-of-ft
field goal attempts in the Cardi
nal's wins. Sgroi played last year
with a broken vertebrae. His accu
racy and distance suffered, the
punter had to handle kickoffs. and
it hurt every time Sgroi tried to do
his job on the field.
"When you're having trouble
walking, it's no fun out there trying
to kick." he said.
Still, he went out there and tried
to do what he could. But he con
nected on just 7-of-13 attempts,
with a long of just 38 yards. When
the Cardinal went for it on fourth
downs in field goal territory, he
knew the fans were looking his
way.
He also knew there was nothing

he could do but wait it out.
"It's a bone," he said of his in
jury. "You just have to let it heal."
This summer. Sgroi's spine was
finally back to normal. He felt
healthy and he couldn't wait to
show the college football world
what he could really do.
It was clear from the beginning
that something had changed. All
season long, he's shown excellent
hang time and distance on his kick
offs. with 14 of 34 going for touch
backs. Last weekend at Washing
ton State, four of his six kickoffs
weren't even returnable, sailing
out of the end zone on the fly.
"It must be something to do
with the cold weather," joked the
Michigan native.
But kickoffs are one thing, and
field goals are another. And as far
as kicking from placement goes,
Sgroi's season got off to a frustrat
ing start. He missed a 42-yarder
against San Jose State, then missed
a 49-yarder and a 22-yarder in the
first half against Brighani Young.
Few would have guessed then
where Sgroi would be now - third

in the Pac-10 in both scoring (7.5
points per game) and field-goal ac
curacy (75 percent).
But Sgroi. who earned first
team All-State honors as a senior
in high school, knew he was a bet
ter kicker than what his early-sea
son woes showed. So did his team
mates and coaches, who came up
to him on the sidelines and re
minded him of what he had been
doing in practice and what he
could do the next time he took the
field.
"Once 1 got the mental part
back again, it came around," Sgroi
said. "When you feel good and
your team is confident in you. it
gives you confidence in yourself."
It didn't take long for Sgroi to
get a chance to redeem himself. He
would get three more attempts
later in the BYl) game, and he
would make them all. connecting
from 19, and 41 yards. He
wouldn't get to attempt another
field goal until four weeks later,
but in the Cardinal's last two

Stanford kicker Michael Sgroi overcame injury — and the frustration that accompanied it — to become a key
component of the Cardinal offense.
