Senior Lauren Barnikow (31-4)
has gone undefeated in singles dual
match play two years in a row and has
not dropped a match since January.
For the last three years,
Barnikow has been named to the
ITA Ail-American doubles team,
an elite honor granted for being
high-seeded or reaching the Round
of 16 in NCAA Championship
competition.
For the last two years, the Car
dinal's No. 4 singles player has also
made the ITA Ail-American sin
gles team.
And. let's be honest, how many
of us skipped high-school P.E. to
play international-caliber tennis in
Brazil?
Based on Barnikow's seasoned
host of achievements alone, it's no
surprise that such a confident and
collected player comes along only
once in a very rare while. Underly
ing her uncommon success story,
however, is a kid-tested, mother
approved moral that endears us all.
even if the rest of us had to endure
the likes of beginning basketball
and phys. ed.
As Barnikow finishes her fourth
and final year on the top-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team, she
can fondly recall the days when her
youthful competitors were less
than kind to her at "Hot Shots"
tennis club near her hometown of

Woodbridge. N.J.
"I remember getting beaten re
ally badly in the first tournaments I
played when I was 12 or 13,"
Barnikow said. "That's when I
began to get really motivated to im
prove myself and win."
Barnikow added with a grin,
"My mother and 1 still mention
those girls from |Hot Shots). She
used to tell me, 'They're just jeal
ous because they can tell you're
good and they see you working re
ally hard to beat them.' "
Without a doubt, home is where
the heart is for Barnikow, who is
currently ranked 50th in the nation.
From the earliest days in her ca
reer. her parents came out in full
support, making countless drives
statewide to find coaching on limit
ed indoor court time.
"Tennis was always fun for me
and my parents didn't place a lot of
pressure on me," Barnikow said.
"They just told me two things:
Have a good attitude and always
hustle."
A turning point in Barnikow's
career came after she clinched her
first national title at the USTA
Girls' 16 National Championship
in 1997. Ending the juniors season
ranked No. 5, Barnikow had begun
flying to Atlanta. Ga., for more se
rious coaching — not to mention
joining the national team, which
travels worldwide for competition.
Barnikow rounded out her run
in the junior circuit with a No. 2
ranking in the Girls' 18 division. In
their continued support, her family
temporarily relocated to Tampa,
Fla.. where she flourished at the In
ternational Tennis Academy.
111 collegiate matches later.
Barnikow has seen it all. Since her
freshman year, she has been part of
perpetually top-ranked doubles
teams in the nation, competing in

2001 with Lauren Kalvaria and cur
rently with Erin Burdette. a junior.
"Winning NCAAs my freshman
year represents the pinnacle of col
lege tennis to me," Barnikow said.
"We went undefeated that year
and I would love to do that again
this year."
Perhaps Barnikow's playing
doubles with Burdette was destiny.
The duo competed together in the
junior circuit, winning the 2000
Easter Bowl — the junior version of
a Grand Slam tournament — as well
as a $10,000 professional satellite.
The defending Pacific-10 Dou
bles Team of the Year has bright
prospects for the 2004 NCAAs.
boasting a 27-2 record and an ITA
Northwest Championship title.
"As an aggressive baseliner. I've
learned to play the big points and
finish things off," Barnikow said. "I
think this year I also learned to
play smart and win even when I'm
not playing my best tennis."
Though her collegiate tennis ca
reer is nearing its end. Barnikow
has been nominated for an NCAA
postgraduate scholarship, proving
that her hard work both on and off
the courts will stay with her for
years to come. The international
relations major will be considered
nationally for one of 29 available
awards.
For the time being. Barnikow
will make the most of every mo
ment leading up to the NCAA
Championships, which are just
three weeks away. When asked
how she feels about playing No. 4
in the singles lineup after moving
up to No. 2 last year. Barnikow
truly bleeds Cardinal red.
"I don't care what number I'm
playing, as long as I'm helping the
team win." she said. "If our team
can get another ring, it makes it all
worth it."

Brazil?
Based on Barnikow's seasoned
host of achievements alone, it's no
surprise that such a confident and
collected player comes along only
once in a very rare while. Underly
ing her uncommon success story,
however, is a kid-tested, mother
approved moral that endears us all.
even if the rest of us had to endure
the likes of beginning basketball
and phys. ed.
As Barnikow finishes her fourth
and final year on the top-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team, she
can fondly recall the days when her
youthful competitors were less
than kind to her at "Hot Shots"
tennis club near her hometown of

Woodbridge. N.J.
"I remember getting beaten re
ally badly in the first tournaments I
played when I was 12 or 13,"
Barnikow said. "That's when I
began to get really motivated to im
prove myself and win."
Barnikow added with a grin,
"My mother and 1 still mention
those girls from |Hot Shots). She
used to tell me, 'They're just jeal
ous because they can tell you're
good and they see you working re
ally hard to beat them.' "
Without a doubt, home is where
the heart is for Barnikow, who is
currently ranked 50th in the nation.
From the earliest days in her ca
reer. her parents came out in full
support, making countless drives
statewide to find coaching on limit
ed indoor court time.
"Tennis was always fun for me
and my parents didn't place a lot of
pressure on me," Barnikow said.
"They just told me two things:
Have a good attitude and always
hustle."
A turning point in Barnikow's
career came after she clinched her
first national title at the USTA
Girls' 16 National Championship
in 1997. Ending the juniors season
ranked No. 5, Barnikow had begun
flying to Atlanta. Ga., for more se
rious coaching — not to mention
joining the national team, which
travels worldwide for competition.
Barnikow rounded out her run
in the junior circuit with a No. 2
ranking in the Girls' 18 division. In
their continued support, her family
temporarily relocated to Tampa,
Fla.. where she flourished at the In
ternational Tennis Academy.
111 collegiate matches later.
Barnikow has seen it all. Since her
freshman year, she has been part of
perpetually top-ranked doubles
teams in the nation, competing in

2001 with Lauren Kalvaria and cur
rently with Erin Burdette. a junior.
"Winning NCAAs my freshman
year represents the pinnacle of col
lege tennis to me," Barnikow said.
"We went undefeated that year
and I would love to do that again
this year."
Perhaps Barnikow's playing
doubles with Burdette was destiny.
The duo competed together in the
junior circuit, winning the 2000
Easter Bowl — the junior version of
a Grand Slam tournament — as well
as a $10,000 professional satellite.
The defending Pacific-10 Dou
bles Team of the Year has bright
prospects for the 2004 NCAAs.
boasting a 27-2 record and an ITA
Northwest Championship title.
"As an aggressive baseliner. I've
learned to play the big points and
finish things off," Barnikow said. "I
think this year I also learned to
play smart and win even when I'm
not playing my best tennis."
Though her collegiate tennis ca
reer is nearing its end. Barnikow
has been nominated for an NCAA
postgraduate scholarship, proving
that her hard work both on and off
the courts will stay with her for
years to come. The international
relations major will be considered
nationally for one of 29 available
awards.
For the time being. Barnikow
will make the most of every mo
ment leading up to the NCAA
Championships, which are just
three weeks away. When asked
how she feels about playing No. 4
in the singles lineup after moving
up to No. 2 last year. Barnikow
truly bleeds Cardinal red.
"I don't care what number I'm
playing, as long as I'm helping the
team win." she said. "If our team
can get another ring, it makes it all
worth it."
