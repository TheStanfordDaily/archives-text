16th minute of play on a cross from team
mate Shari Summers.
Less than three minutes later, senior
forward Martha West scored the Cardi
nal's second and final goal of the evening
to give her team a 2-0 lead.The play began
when the Mustang defense failed to clear
the ball away from its own net following a
Cardinal corner kick. West converted the
Mustang miscue into a Cardinal goal by
intercepting a poor pass and firing the ball
into the back of the net.
"The entire season the key thing for us
has been to score a goal, because defen
sively we're very organized and we have a
great goalkeeper in Nicole Barnhart,"
Ratcliffe said. "So when we get a goal
early in the game, 1 think, confidence
wise, it really helps us a tremendous
amount."
Before the Cardinal-Mustang match
up, Santa Clara and California went head
to-head in their first-round game. The
Broncos went into halftime down by a
goal, but rallied back in the second half to
grab a 2-1 victory.
This set up the Cardinal and Broncos
as the teams to square off in the second
round game held on Sunday afternoon.
The intensity was high, as was to be ex
pected, and the two teams combined for
24 fouls through over 100 minutes of play.
Despite coming out strong against Cal
Poly, the Cardinal struggled against a
strong Bronco defense. They collected
just two shots in the opening half and
spent much of their time playing defense
in their own zone.
The second half followed in similar
fashion, with the Broncos out-shooting the
Cardinal 7-2. However, the defense re
mained tough, keeping the Broncos score
less through regulation play. Barnhart col
lected three saves in the first 90 minutes
and nabbed one more in overtime.

The Stanford women's soccer team's
season came to an end yesterday, as the
No. 25 Cardinal (13-6-3, 4-3-2-Pacific-10
Conference) were knocked out of the
College Cup tournament in the second
round by No. 4 Santa Clara (16-4-2,6-1-0-
West Coast Conference).
The Cardinal and Broncos battled it
out at Buck Shaw Stadium through two
overtimes until forward Tina Estrada
scored to give the Broncos the 1 -0 victory.
The Cardinal had advanced to the
second round after defeating Cal Poly
(11-2-6,5-1 -3-Big West Conference) 2-0
on Friday.
The second-round loss is especially
frustrating for the Cardinal given that the
Broncos handed them an early exit from
the NCAA tournament last year as well. In
that contest, the Cardinal were downed 1-
0 in the first round at Buck Shaw Stadium.
"Santa Clara is a huge rival in the Bay
Area for us," said head coach Paul Rat
cliffe. "We always want to beat them, and
it's tough to lose at the same place."
Coming into tournament play, there
were still lingering concerns about how
well the Cardinal offense would stack up
against the competition.
Despite having a strong defensive unit
to keep games close, the Cardinal had
been plagued many times throughout the
regular season by their inability to put the
ball in the net.
Thankfully, scoring goals was not
much of a problem for the Cardinal on
Friday afternoon against Cal Poly, as they
jumped out to an early 2-0 lead and never
looked back. Freshman forward Lizzy
George put her team on the board in the

After one scoreless overtime session,
the Broncos finally found their break.
Estrada scored the game-winner just 55
seconds into the second overtime on a
pass from teammate Megan Kakadelas.
The game-winner sent the Cardinal home
and has the Broncos advancing to the
third round, where they will take on top
ranked North Carolina.

While the season ends on a sour note
and without a national title, the Cardinal
remain pleased with their success this
year.
"I think it was a very respectable sea
son." Ratcliffe said. "I can't wait for next
season because I think we're going to
keep getting better and better every
year."
