The full-length version of this story originally

Coming into January of this year. Cardinal
head coach Don Shaw was realistic about the
potential performance of the Stanford men's
volleyball team.
"My expectations weren't very high, to tell
you the truth."he said.
And with good reason. Stanford (9-18, 6-
16 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) lost
several key players to graduation last year, in
cluding two-time All-American Curt Toppel,
who recorded 333 kills in the 2003 season, and
Billy Strickland, who played in all 109 games
of that season.
It was a change in the roster from which
Shaw was not sure the Cardinal would imme
diately recover.
"Just looking at the talent level and how
much we lost — we were devastated by grad
uation," Shaw said. "That really took a lot out
of the team."
When those seniors graduated, over 1,000
kills on the season graduated with them.
And in the face of this challenge, Stan
ford confronted another —the strength of
its conference.
The MPSF boasts perennial volleyball
powerhouses such as Hawaii and Pepperdine,
both teams that returned harder-hitting,
more experienced squads to maintain top-five
rankings throughout the season.
It was due to the skill of Stanford's oppo
nents, not a lack of skill on the Cardinal's part,
that Shaw was apprehensive about the 2004
season.
"I thought the possibility really existed
that we would have a hard time winning any
matches in the conference," he said.
But that possibility never came to be. The
Cardinal surprised everyone by posting wins
against strong MPSF teams, including
UCLA. UC-Santa Barbara and UC-Irvine, as
well as lower-ranked UC-San Diego and
Southern California.
"We pulled off four wins against teams
that were ranked ahead of us," Shaw said. "I
can't be real disappointed with that kind of a
finish."

Stanford started its season with two con
secutive upsets in matches against UCLA and
UC-Irvine, often championed as the highlight
reel of the season.
Stanford defeated then-No. 2 UCLA in a
five game match on Jan. 16 before beating
then-No. 9 Irvine the following night.
"Obviously, we had a great start," said ju
nior setter Kevin Hansen. "It was awesome
opening up the season with two key wins
against UCI and UCLA at home."
A win over UCLA was particularly sweet
for Shaw, since the Bruins maintained a high
ranking throughout the regular season, finish
ing at the No. 3 spot. Its ongoing success sug
gests that the Cardinal win was not simply the
result of good timing.
Wins like these might not seem to match
up with the Cardinal's poor statistical record,
particularly on the road.
Stanford posted only two wins away from
home this season. Hansen and Shaw chalk
much of it up to a tough conference, choosing
to focus on the nature of their competitors
rather than the numbers.
"The MPSF is an extremely competitive
conference and I am pleased that our guys al
ways played hard no matter what the score
board said," Hansen said.
Hansen was the only returning player
with much in-game experience and his pres
ence in the setter role was key to this sea
son's success.
Junior middle blocker Craig Buell also
stepped up this season. He and sophomore
Chris Ahlfeldt maintained the position of
middle blocker throughout the season,
though neither of them had much playing ex
perience from the previous year.lt was an ac
complishment that impressed Shaw.
"What a tremendous job those guys did,
just being able to play every night," he said.
Also playing every night in a new position
was junior outside hitter David Vogel, who
played defense last season before heading up
Stanford's attack this year.
"Vogel had been a libero and he was going
to have to become our number one outside
hitter," Shaw said.
He did just that, leading the team with 264
kills this season and maintaining his defensive
skills as well — Vogel tallied a total of 156
digs.

Despite the team's lack of collegiate experience, the Cardinal men's volley
ball team put together a respectable 2004 campaign, holding its own in one
of the toughest conferences in the nation.
