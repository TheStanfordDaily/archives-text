LONG ISLAND, N. Y. â€” Like the rest of
the student body, the Stanford men's
swim team had its weeklong hiatus from
school last week. However, instead of
tropical getaways, snowy mountains, and

crazy parties, the team had a spring break
filled with exciting swimming. The break
marked the coming of the NCAA Swim
ming and Diving Championships, which
were held on Long Island last Thursday,
Friday and Saturday.
With its No. 2 national ranking and an
undefeated record, the Cardinal brought
high hopes into the three-day battle. But
in the end, the top-ranked Auburn Tigers
came away with the 2004 championship.
Stanford finished second, ahead of rival
Texas in what turned out to be one of the
fastest NCAA meets in recent history.
The first day of competition was the
toughest for the Cardinal, featuring a se

ries of events that played to the strengths
of the Tigers. In the 200-meter freestyle
relay, the Stanford relay team of Ben
Wildman-Tobriner, Peter Marshall, An
drew Schnell and Bobby O'Bryan took
second place while setting an American
record in the event.
The 100-meter backstroke was one of
the highlights of the meet, featuring two
time defending champion Marshall, se
nior Markus Rogan and Texas star Aaron
Peirsol. In one of the most exciting races
of the meet, Marshall defended his crown,
with his winning time of 50.32 setting a
new world record. Rogan finished second
ahead of Peirsol.

Although the Cardinal performed well.
Auburn's strength and the lost relay were
too much for the team to overcome, and
their deficit increased to nearly 20() points.
2004 was a bittersweet year for the
Cardinal. Although swimmers performed
well individually, the lack of a team cham
pionship left some of the team members
feeling disappointed. Additionally, the
swimming careers of Stanford stars
Michael Bruce and Bobby O'Bryan came
to a close.
However, the future is bright for the
team, as the swimmers begin to prepare
for the Olympic Trials in July and their
chance at Olympic glory.
