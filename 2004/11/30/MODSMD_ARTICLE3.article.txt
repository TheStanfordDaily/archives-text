## 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The full-length version of this story originall
appeared in The Daily on Mar. 30.2004.
The stakes were higher and the stage
grander, but for Stanford junior Matt Gen
try, the outcome was plenty familiar.
With a late reversal. Gentry defeated
Ohio's Jake Percival 4-2 in the 157-pound
final at the NCAA Wrestling Champi
onships in St. Louis 10 days ago to cap an un
defeated season and become the first nation
al champion in Stanford wrestling history.
"It's a great experience, quite an honor,"
Gentry said. "Stanford athletics is an amaz
ing program, and I feel grateful to be able to
wrestle for them."
Stanford head coach Steve Buddie, who
placed fourth at NCAAs as a junior in 1990
before taking the reins at his alma mater

three years ago, is equally grateful to have
Gentry as the cornerstone of a much-im
proved program.
"When your program turns a corner,
you just know there is no turning back,
Buddie said. "This was that defining mo
ment for our program."
Gentry's magical run. coupled with the
performance of four other Stanford NCAA
qualifiers, catapulted the Cardinal into a
top-2() finish for just the third time in school
history. The strong performance at NCA As
capped a year in which the Cardinal won 10
dual meets and went 6-2 in the Pacific-10
Conference during the regular season, just
one year after stumbling to a 3-12 record.
Still, Stanford knows there's a lot more
work to be done.
" The great thing about our program this
year is that we aren't a team that settles for
less than greatness," Buddie said.
"No one settles fora pat on the
back ... The team wants more and
will do whatever it takes to break
into the top 10."
Gentry finished the season 42-0,
bringing his career win total to 109,
which ties Buddie for the most all
time in Stanford history. As Gentry
took to the mat in the final bout be
fore thousands of jubilant fans and
several of his teammates, Buddie
watched intently and confidently
from the side.
"Objectively, it was a close and
exciting match, but I just wasn't
that nervous," Buddie said. "This
was his year, from beginning to end,
and I just knew that no one was
going to take that from him."
In the end, no one did take the
title from Gentry, but several tried.
As the second seed in the 157-
pound bracket. Gentry became the
first Stanford grappler to even ad
vance to an NCAA title bout with
four wins over the first two days of
competition, including a thrilling 6-
4 sudden-victory over Michigan's
Ryan Berlin, the defending nation-

Metzler kicks in
strong performance

al champion, in the semifinal bout.
Percival, who Gentry defeated
13-10 decision in an exhibition
match at the NWCA All-Star Clas
sic in early February, entered the
final bout with an unblemished 38-
0 record and was coming off a semi
final victory over top-seeded and
previously-unbeaten Alex
Tirapelle of Illinois.
But with 30 seconds left in the
match and Percival working on a
minute of riding time. Gentry
turned a 2-2 tie into a 4-2 lead with
a reversal and held on for the win to
end Percival's perfect season while
keeping his own intact.
"1 came into the match with a lot of
momentum," Gentry said. "Watch
ing the tape of the match, 1 was really
surprised at how relaxed I looked, but
1 stayed focused and calm."
Stanford senior Brad Metzler,
who Buddie said is not expected to
return for his final season of eligi
bility, placed ninth at 141 pounds
with a 3-2 record, including a 10-0
major decision victory over IJNC-
Greensboro's Kevin Artis.
"(Brad's) been an anchor for this

program for four years, and it will
be extremely hard to see him
leave," Buddie said.
Fellow senior Paul Gross saw his
collegiate career come to a close as
well, but not before he registered a
couple more wins, including a pin of
lowa's Trent Goodale.
In the aftermath of the greatest
achievement in Stanford wrestling
history. Gentry will turn his atten
tion to defending his title. For his
teammates, some of whom were al
ready in the weight room lifting the
next day, the attention turns to
putting in the work that could make
them the Cardinal's next national
champions in the near future.
"The greatest thing that I be
lieve comes from something like
this is the familiarity element."
Buddie said. "Everyone on our
team sees Matt train, they see he is
a vulnerable athlete just like any
one else. They see his strengths, his
training pattern, his weaknesses,
his work ethic, basically, his hu
manity. And they know now that
they can accomplish this kind of
goal as well."


Now that Matt Gentry has earned Stanford's first-ever national wrestling title, coach Steve Buddie believes that
others on the team could achieve the same feat.

onships in St. Louis 10 days ago to cap an un
defeated season and become the first nation
al champion in Stanford wrestling history.
"It's a great experience, quite an honor,"
Gentry said. "Stanford athletics is an amaz
ing program, and I feel grateful to be able to
wrestle for them."
Stanford head coach Steve Buddie, who
placed fourth at NCAAs as a junior in 1990
before taking the reins at his alma mater

three years ago, is equally grateful to have
Gentry as the cornerstone of a much-im
proved program.
"When your program turns a corner,
you just know there is no turning back,
Buddie said. "This was that defining mo
ment for our program."
Gentry's magical run. coupled with the
performance of four other Stanford NCAA
qualifiers, catapulted the Cardinal into a
top-2() finish for just the third time in school
history. The strong performance at NCA As
capped a year in which the Cardinal won 10
dual meets and went 6-2 in the Pacific-10
Conference during the regular season, just
one year after stumbling to a 3-12 record.
Still, Stanford knows there's a lot more
work to be done.
" The great thing about our program this
year is that we aren't a team that settles for
less than greatness," Buddie said.
"No one settles fora pat on the
back ... The team wants more and
will do whatever it takes to break
into the top 10."
Gentry finished the season 42-0,
bringing his career win total to 109,
which ties Buddie for the most all
time in Stanford history. As Gentry
took to the mat in the final bout be
fore thousands of jubilant fans and
several of his teammates, Buddie
watched intently and confidently
from the side.
"Objectively, it was a close and
exciting match, but I just wasn't
that nervous," Buddie said. "This
was his year, from beginning to end,
and I just knew that no one was
going to take that from him."
In the end, no one did take the
title from Gentry, but several tried.
As the second seed in the 157-
pound bracket. Gentry became the
first Stanford grappler to even ad
vance to an NCAA title bout with
four wins over the first two days of
competition, including a thrilling 6-
4 sudden-victory over Michigan's
Ryan Berlin, the defending nation-

Metzler kicks in
strong performance

al champion, in the semifinal bout.
Percival, who Gentry defeated
13-10 decision in an exhibition
match at the NWCA All-Star Clas
sic in early February, entered the
final bout with an unblemished 38-
0 record and was coming off a semi
final victory over top-seeded and
previously-unbeaten Alex
Tirapelle of Illinois.
But with 30 seconds left in the
match and Percival working on a
minute of riding time. Gentry
turned a 2-2 tie into a 4-2 lead with
a reversal and held on for the win to
end Percival's perfect season while
keeping his own intact.
"1 came into the match with a lot of
momentum," Gentry said. "Watch
ing the tape of the match, 1 was really
surprised at how relaxed I looked, but
1 stayed focused and calm."
Stanford senior Brad Metzler,
who Buddie said is not expected to
return for his final season of eligi
bility, placed ninth at 141 pounds
with a 3-2 record, including a 10-0
major decision victory over IJNC-
Greensboro's Kevin Artis.
"(Brad's) been an anchor for this

program for four years, and it will
be extremely hard to see him
leave," Buddie said.
Fellow senior Paul Gross saw his
collegiate career come to a close as
well, but not before he registered a
couple more wins, including a pin of
lowa's Trent Goodale.
In the aftermath of the greatest
achievement in Stanford wrestling
history. Gentry will turn his atten
tion to defending his title. For his
teammates, some of whom were al
ready in the weight room lifting the
next day, the attention turns to
putting in the work that could make
them the Cardinal's next national
champions in the near future.
"The greatest thing that I be
lieve comes from something like
this is the familiarity element."
Buddie said. "Everyone on our
team sees Matt train, they see he is
a vulnerable athlete just like any
one else. They see his strengths, his
training pattern, his weaknesses,
his work ethic, basically, his hu
manity. And they know now that
they can accomplish this kind of
goal as well."


Now that Matt Gentry has earned Stanford's first-ever national wrestling title, coach Steve Buddie believes that
others on the team could achieve the same feat.
