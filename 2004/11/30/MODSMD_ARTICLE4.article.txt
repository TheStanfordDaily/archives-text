They rushed the court at Maples
Pavilion on Saturday.
Hands waving, feet stomping,
girls crying, the Sixth Man Club
jumped up and down on those boun
cy floors like it never had before, like
it never would again.
In reality, that post-game rush on
those particular bouncy floors, after
junior forward Nick Robinson hit a
32-foot game winner over Arizona's
Andre Iguodala, might just have
been the Sixth Man Club's last
bounce (the floors are being re
placed this spring as a part of the
Maples renovation).
But nobody's talking about that
right now.
For the moment, they're already
calling this one a classic. Already ...
already marking it down in the histo
ry books as one of the most enter
taining and intriguing collegiate
games of all time.
And, really, it was all of that, every
gut-wrenching, heart-pounding, hair
pulling bit of No. 2 Stanford's (20-0,
11-0 Pacific-10 Conference) 80-77 win
over No. 12 Arizona (14-6,6-5) on Sat
urday lived up to that billing.
From the opening 20 minutes,
when Stanford rushed to a 13-point
lead off 56.5 percent shooting from
the field to the closing seconds of
that first half when Arizona guard
Salim Stoudamire hit a running
three-pointer to close the Wildcat
deficit to nine points.
And the drama continued into the
second period as well, from the seven
minute, 14-0 Arizona run that culmi
nated with a Channing Frye slam dunk
that gave the Wildcats a 72-67 lead to
the final breathtaking minute, when
Stanford overcame a four-point deficit
to beat Arizona at the buzzer on
Robinson's desperation shot.
"I'm starting to think this group
might be something special," Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery said.
"That was just an unbelievable game."
But this unbelievable?
This special?
It was clear from the get-go that
this was Stanford's game to lose — the
streak on the line, the No. 2 national
ranking, undefeated St. Joesph's team
already having recorded its 20th win,
Arizona protecting its four-year win
ning streak at Maples Pavilion despite
its struggles as of late.
It couldn't have been more back
and-forth.
The Cardinal clearly dominated
the opening minutes, rushing to a 14-
4 lead, a run which included a two
minute period where Stanford
guards Chris Hernandez and Matt
Lottich took turns knocking down
shot after shot.
Hernandez hit a three-pointer off
the dribble. Then Lottich came off a
screen to hit a three. Next he hit an

off-balance baseline pull-up jumper,
which was followed closely by a Her
nandez steal and a coast-to-coast
fastbreak layup over 6-foot-11 Frye.
The second half, on the other
hand, was the complete opposite.
Still reeling from Stoudamire's last
second three-pointer, which closed
Arizona's halftime deficit to nine,
the Wildcats quickly closed the gap.
Arizona got hot.
Stoudamire spun around twice
and converted a one-handed floater
over Lottich, scoring the third and
fourth points in a 14-0 Wildcat run
that was accentuated by a cold Stan
ford shooting spell.
"[Arizona] shot 60 percent in the
second half," Montgomery said. "We
couldn't guard them. We couldn't
run our offense. Every time we made
a mistake they capitalized."
But all of that only made the
game's final play seem more amaz
ing, more unexpected, more indica
tive of the seeming tenacity of this
Stanford team.
"Our guys might have been fear
ful of losing, but at some point, they
couldn't be afraid to lose and just
tried to do what it [takes] to win,"
Montgomery said.
With 44 seconds left on the clock,
Arizona forward Hassan Adams put
Childress on the line. Childress
missed the first and hit the second,
bringing Stanford within three
points, 77-74.
Next, Lottich stole the ball from
Arizona's freshman point guard,
Mustafa Shakur, and Hernandez
found Childress floating around the
perimeter fora wide-open three
pointer, which Childress nailed.
Tie game.
After a timeout, Arizona in
bounded the ball and Stoudamire
dribbled it up court, guarded closely
by Lottich. While trying to utilize a
high screen from Frye, Stoudamire
found himself surprised by a Stan
ford triple team — which Iguodala
inadvertently initiated by running
his man, Nick Robinson, directly
into the play.
The ball came loose and found its
way to Robinson, who rushed to
ward the basket as the final seconds
ticked off the clock and hit a running
32-footer to win the game.
"When 1 let it go. it felt good,"
Robinson said.
And like Robinson's game-win
ning three-pointer at the buzzer, this
team, this win was quite the longshot
— overcoming the absence of both
senior forward Justin Davis and
sophomore forward Matt Haryasz,
both out with injuries, coming back
from a five-point deficit with less
than three minutes left to play.
Stoudamire led all scorers with 24
points off 9-of-14 shooting from the
field. Hernandez contributed 20
points and five assists to the Cardinal
effort, while Childress added 18
points and 10 boards. Junior center
Rob Little finished with 16 points
and six rebounds in 30 minutes of
play.

ning streak at Maples Pavilion despite
its struggles as of late.
It couldn't have been more back
and-forth.
The Cardinal clearly dominated
the opening minutes, rushing to a 14-
4 lead, a run which included a two
minute period where Stanford
guards Chris Hernandez and Matt
Lottich took turns knocking down
shot after shot.
Hernandez hit a three-pointer off
the dribble. Then Lottich came off a
screen to hit a three. Next he hit an

off-balance baseline pull-up jumper,
which was followed closely by a Her
nandez steal and a coast-to-coast
fastbreak layup over 6-foot-11 Frye.
The second half, on the other
hand, was the complete opposite.
Still reeling from Stoudamire's last
second three-pointer, which closed
Arizona's halftime deficit to nine,
the Wildcats quickly closed the gap.
Arizona got hot.
Stoudamire spun around twice
and converted a one-handed floater
over Lottich, scoring the third and
fourth points in a 14-0 Wildcat run
that was accentuated by a cold Stan
ford shooting spell.
"[Arizona] shot 60 percent in the
second half," Montgomery said. "We
couldn't guard them. We couldn't
run our offense. Every time we made
a mistake they capitalized."
But all of that only made the
game's final play seem more amaz
ing, more unexpected, more indica
tive of the seeming tenacity of this
Stanford team.
"Our guys might have been fear
ful of losing, but at some point, they
couldn't be afraid to lose and just
tried to do what it [takes] to win,"
Montgomery said.
With 44 seconds left on the clock,
Arizona forward Hassan Adams put
Childress on the line. Childress
missed the first and hit the second,
bringing Stanford within three
points, 77-74.
Next, Lottich stole the ball from
Arizona's freshman point guard,
Mustafa Shakur, and Hernandez
found Childress floating around the
perimeter fora wide-open three
pointer, which Childress nailed.
Tie game.
After a timeout, Arizona in
bounded the ball and Stoudamire
dribbled it up court, guarded closely
by Lottich. While trying to utilize a
high screen from Frye, Stoudamire
found himself surprised by a Stan
ford triple team — which Iguodala
inadvertently initiated by running
his man, Nick Robinson, directly
into the play.
The ball came loose and found its
way to Robinson, who rushed to
ward the basket as the final seconds
ticked off the clock and hit a running
32-footer to win the game.
"When 1 let it go. it felt good,"
Robinson said.
And like Robinson's game-win
ning three-pointer at the buzzer, this
team, this win was quite the longshot
— overcoming the absence of both
senior forward Justin Davis and
sophomore forward Matt Haryasz,
both out with injuries, coming back
from a five-point deficit with less
than three minutes left to play.
Stoudamire led all scorers with 24
points off 9-of-14 shooting from the
field. Hernandez contributed 20
points and five assists to the Cardinal
effort, while Childress added 18
points and 10 boards. Junior center
Rob Little finished with 16 points
and six rebounds in 30 minutes of
play.

They rushed the court at Maples
Pavilion on Saturday.
Hands waving, feet stomping,
girls crying, the Sixth Man Club
jumped up and down on those boun
cy floors like it never had before, like
it never would again.
In reality, that post-game rush on
those particular bouncy floors, after
junior forward Nick Robinson hit a
32-foot game winner over Arizona's
Andre Iguodala, might just have
been the Sixth Man Club's last
bounce (the floors are being re
placed this spring as a part of the
Maples renovation).
But nobody's talking about that
right now.
For the moment, they're already
calling this one a classic. Already ...
already marking it down in the histo
ry books as one of the most enter
taining and intriguing collegiate
games of all time.
And, really, it was all of that, every
gut-wrenching, heart-pounding, hair
pulling bit of No. 2 Stanford's (20-0,
11-0 Pacific-10 Conference) 80-77 win
over No. 12 Arizona (14-6,6-5) on Sat
urday lived up to that billing.
From the opening 20 minutes,
when Stanford rushed to a 13-point
lead off 56.5 percent shooting from
the field to the closing seconds of
that first half when Arizona guard
Salim Stoudamire hit a running
three-pointer to close the Wildcat
deficit to nine points.
And the drama continued into the
second period as well, from the seven
minute, 14-0 Arizona run that culmi
nated with a Channing Frye slam dunk
that gave the Wildcats a 72-67 lead to
the final breathtaking minute, when
Stanford overcame a four-point deficit
to beat Arizona at the buzzer on
Robinson's desperation shot.
"I'm starting to think this group
might be something special," Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery said.
"That was just an unbelievable game."
But this unbelievable?
This special?
It was clear from the get-go that
this was Stanford's game to lose — the
streak on the line, the No. 2 national
ranking, undefeated St. Joesph's team
already having recorded its 20th win,
Arizona protecting its four-year win
ning streak at Maples Pavilion despite
its struggles as of late.
