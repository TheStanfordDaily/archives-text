At the beginning of this season,
the No. 6 Cardinal Softball team (43-
16. 13-8 Pacific-10 Conference) set a
lofty goal for itself: to make the Col
lege World Series.
To make the CWS — an eight
team, double-elimination tourna
ment held in Oklahoma City — a
team must win one of the eight eight
team NCAA Regionals held around
the nation, a daunting task.
In fact, the Cardinal have made
the CWS only once in the history of

the program, during the 2001 season.
This was the same season in which
Stanford, with an 11-10 Pac-10
record, achieved its best conference
win-loss record since the switch to the
current 21-game schedule.
However, the Cardinal are look
ing more and more like a team of des
tiny after besting their 2001 Pac-10
mark by going 13-8 in conference and
finishing in a tie for second place in
the Pac-10. Their second-place con
ference finish marks the best perfor
mance in the Pac-10 by a Stanford
Softball team in the 10-year history of
the program.
This year, the Cardinal has earned
victories over top-ranked Arizona
