At the beginning of this season,
the No. 6 Cardinal Softball team (43-
16. 13-8 Pacific-10 Conference) set a
lofty goal for itself: to make the Col
lege World Series.
To make the CWS — an eight
team, double-elimination tourna
ment held in Oklahoma City — a
team must win one of the eight eight
team NCAA Regionals held around
the nation, a daunting task.
In fact, the Cardinal have made
the CWS only once in the history of

the program, during the 2001 season.
This was the same season in which
Stanford, with an 11-10 Pac-10
record, achieved its best conference
win-loss record since the switch to the
current 21-game schedule.
However, the Cardinal are look
ing more and more like a team of des
tiny after besting their 2001 Pac-10
mark by going 13-8 in conference and
finishing in a tie for second place in
the Pac-10. Their second-place con
ference finish marks the best perfor
mance in the Pac-10 by a Stanford
Softball team in the 10-year history of
the program.
This year, the Cardinal has earned
victories over top-ranked Arizona

Stanford made its second CWS appearance in 2004.
(53-4), No. 2 California (46-11) and No.
4 UCLA (39-9) on top of 10 more vic
tories against other Top-25 opponents.
The Cardinal held their own in nearly
every game of a brutal conference
schedule and came on especially strong
during the last third of its season.
For all of these accomplishments, the
Cardinal were rewarded with a No. 7
overall seed and the top seed in their own
NCAA Regional at Boyd and Jill Smith
Family Stadium on May 20-23. While
Regional play at Smith Family Stadium
will kick off tomorrow afternoon, the
Cardinals first game will be on Thursday
evening, matchup against eighth-seeded
and unranked Utah (23-31).
Cardinal fall to Bruins at CWS

After losing its first game at the
Women's College World Series, 8-2, to
No. 2 UCLA on Thursday, the Cardinal
softball team looked like it might be
headed toward a quick exit from Okla
homa City this past weekend. If this had
been the case, the Cardinal would still
have posted the second-best season in
school history.
Thursday predictions of the Cardi
nal's demise proved to be premature,
however, as Stanford battled back on
Saturday to post two straight wins
against the No. 6 and No. 1 seeds, re
spectively, before falling in a national
semifinal rematch against UCLA.
