## Liu defends singles title

Last week, the top-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team (35-0)
bested UCLA in the NCAA Cham
pionship Finals, 4-1, to clinch a
record 13th NCAA title.
On Saturday, the Cardinal's No. 1
singles player, sophomore Amber
Liu, successfully defended her
NCAA singles title against Fresno
State freshman Jelena Pandzic, 6-4,
0-6, 6-3. A player of Liu's caliber
hasn't been seen since former Cardi
nal Laura Granville won the 2000
title as a freshman and repeated the
feat in 2001.
May Madness is over, and Stan
ford has capped off a perfect regular
season with an equally flawless run
at NCAAs — begging the question,
how did Stanford make it all look so
easy?
Sophomore Alice Barnes, who
was named Most Outstanding Player
after going 3-0 in straight-set wins at
the Athens, Ga., competition,
swears by her Prince racket that it
wasn't always easy.
"I think NCAAs were quite a bit
different than last year because
there was more pressure and we
were expected to win. especially
after Florida lost," Barnes said. "In
addition, there was more pressure on
the sophomore players because the
other returning members of the
team had at least one NCAA title to
their names. Amber and I didn't
want to be going 0-2 when Stanford
players are usually 2-2 at that point."
The Cambridge, U.K., native

brings to light the curious road to vic
tory taken by the second-seeded
Cardinal. While the first two rounds
of play involved rolling over unseed
ed not-even-hopefuls such as Quin
nipiac, the final proved — to the anx
ious delight of family and fans —
that it wouldn't be NCAAs without a
healthy dose of upsets, even between
conference foes that met three times
earlier this year.
At No. 2 doubles, Barnes and Liu
teamed up in a decisive dispatch of
No. 43 Jackie Carleton and Feriel
Esseghir, 8-3. The overpowering

success on court two marked the first
time the Cardinal had clinched No. 2
doubles over the ninth-seeded Bru
ins.
"Amber never seriously played
doubles before college, and for her
to learn a whole new style of tennis in
just two years and play as well as she
did is pretty impressive," Barnes
said.
The crafty Cardinal duo closed
out their season with an imposing 23-
3 record, more than making up for
the first three mishaps against
UCLA.
