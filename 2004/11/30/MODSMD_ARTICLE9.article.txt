On a weekend that saw torna
dos sweep through Oklahoma, a
couple of Cardinal men's tennis
players caused a storm of their own
at the NCAA Championships.
After playing the best doubles
teams in the country through five

grueling rounds, the seventh-seed
ed tandem of sophomore K.C.
Corkery and junior Sam Warburg
captured the 2004 NCAA doubles
championship in Tulsa. Okla., on
Monday.
The Stanford dream team
began their road to victory on
Thursday when they outplayed un
seeded David Goulet and Michael
Kogan of Tulane, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4, in
the round of 32.
It took less effort to take out
Arizona's Roger Matalonga and

Colin O'Grady on Friday, 7-5,6-3.
"First of all, it was really hot out
here, which I know can take its toll
on anybody, especially with us hav
ing long matches in the morning
with our singles," Warburg said.
"The heat was our first opponent.
These guys served real well and it
was hard for us to get a break."
Corkery / Warburg are the 14th
Stanford men's doubles team to
capture an NCAA championship,
giving head coach Dick Gould a
fantastic farewell present.
