Former Vermont Gov. Howard
Dean gave an animated, hour-long
speech to about 1,700 students at an
ASSU Speakers Bureau event at
Memorial Auditorium Monday
night, where he talked about the fu
ture of the Democratic Party, moral
values, globalization, public service
and that scream.
Greeted by a standing ovation.
Dean, who ran for the Democratic
nomination for the presidency, began
his remarks by posing the question,
"Where do we go from here?" He
said Democrats should be optimistic
about the road ahead.
"I understand that there was a
great funk that fell over the Stanford
campus, except for the people at the
Hoover Institute, the week after the
election." he said in a dig at the con
servative reputation of Stanford's
think tank.
"History is on our side, and we will
prevail," Dean said, adding that any
policy "based on ideology, not facts"
will inevitably "end up in the trash
can of history."
While Dean praised Democratic
presidential nominee John Kerry for
running a clean campaign, he criti
cized the Democrats for mimicking
the Republican Party.
"We don't need two Republican

Parties in this country," Dean said.
"Truman once said, if you run a Re
publican against a Democrat who
acts like a Republican, the real Re
publican wins ever)' time."'
Dean urged the Democratic Party
leadership to present "an opposition
model, a real difference" to the Re
publican platform. "If you ever want
to win again, then stand for some
thing. stand for what you believe in."
he said.
Democrats are "bad at messag
ing" their moral values, which Dean
said are rooted in"a sense of obliga-

tion to each other." He advocated speak
ing about charged issues on Democratic
terms.
"Instead of lighting about gay mar
riage, what we ought to be lighting about
is that every single American has the
same rights as every other American," he
said. "We don't have to debate on their
terms, let's debate them on our terms."
Dean also talked about the impact of
globalization on the world community.
"Globalization is neither good nor
bad, it's how you do it."he said. "All
we've done is globalized the rights of cor
porations."
"The role of government in a capital
ist society is to make sure we don't have
12-year-olds working 12-hour days in cot
ton mills, either in this country or in
Malaysia where they're putting together
Nike shoes," Dean said.
"Let's globalize worker protections
and environmental protections and level
the playing field," he added.
Dean also said that young people have
a unique stake in the future of the world

due to new information and communica
tion technologies like the Internet.
"Yours is the first generation in
America to see the whole world as your
community."
Dean and his former campaign man
ager Joe Trippi have been credited with
revolutionizing political campaigns by
using the Internet as a powerful tool for
fundraising and organizing supports.
"You really do have the power," Dean
said. "But you get a 'D' for voting - it's the
bare minimum for your democracy to
thrive."
Dean encouraged the audience to
make change happen by running for of
fice, even if it's just within their commu
nities. "You can't win if you don't run."
he said.
In one of the many humorous mo
ments of the night. Dean poked fun at his
impassioned campaign speech after the
lowa primaries almost a year ;igo. which
was replayed by the news media count
less times.
"First of all, let me just get this out of

the way: YEEAWW!" Dean yelled, incit
ing a thunderous wave of applause and
laughter. "Was that so terrifying?" he
asked.
Senior Josh Meltzer. director of the
ASSIJ Speakers Bureau, said they invit
ed Dean because of his dynamic speaking
style and his willingness to discuss rele
vant political issues, particularly in light
of last month's election.
"One of the major factors is that he's a
politician who speaks to the issues under
graduate and graduate students really
care about," Meltzer said. "He appeals to
a wide range of people on campus, and at
a time when people are especially inter
ested in politics."
Meltzer said that Dean's hour-long
speech, followed by a 20-minute question
and answer session with the audience, ex
ceeded the Speakers Bureau's expecta
tions.
"Dean planned to speak for 20 min
utes â€” he said it was the longest speech
of that nature that he's given."
