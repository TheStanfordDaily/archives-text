# Mountain lion cub spotted near Dish
## 
### BEA SANFORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Another mountain lion has been spotted
in the foothills. The cat, a young cub, was
seen on Nov. 12 near the Stanford Avenue
gate to the Dish. While police have posted
signs warning hikers of the sighting, those
walking in the foothills seem undeterred.
Seniors Brendan O'Connor and Douglas
Wilson said they are unafraid to walk
around the Dish as they normally do, de
spite the warning.
"I know some people say it's just a myth,
but I'm sure it's true," Wilson said. "But
still, some mountain lion is not going to at
tack, especially during the day."
However, Lt. Bob Beacom of the Palo
Alto Police Department said that the possi
bility of a direct encounter with a mountain
lion poses a threat, even if it occurs infre
quently.
• There are different types of interac
tions." Beacom said. "You have sightings
and then you have interactions. It's not a
usual thing to have interactions, and there is
a lot of danger there.... Santa Clara County
is considered an area heavily populated by
mountain lions, so there's always that dan
ger."
Despite the significant number of cats,
most people using the foothills do not ex
pect to see any mountain lions.
The signs posted at the entrances to the
Dish caution against hiking after dusk or be
fore dawn because cougars tend to do their
hunting at night. Although the Dish closes
for the night. Stanford students often climb
over the fence for late-night excursions.
"I have friends who come in at night and
jump the fence, and I'm kind of tempted to
do that," Wilson said. "The mountain lion is
not a deterrent at all — if anything, I'm

more worried about getting in trouble
with campus police."
A junior who asked to remain anony
mous said that he entered the Dish at
night with some friends over the week
end. He said that he knew there had
been a mountain lion sighting, but that it
did not stop him.
"We're aware that mountain lions
are pretty unpredictable," he said.
"Since we were in a group, though, I
wasn't scared. Some of us have had a lot
of back-country experience."
The junior expressed his desire to see
a mountain lion without being harmed.
"Either they jump on you and you're
done, or you don't gei to see them at
all," he said. "There's no happy middle
ground."
Local resident Shannon Smith, who
snuck into the Dish at night when she
was young, said she was not scared of the
mountain lion and that such warnings
are quite common in this area.
A similar series of sightings occurred
at Stanford last May when two horses
were found bearing the marks of a
cougar attack.

The sightings culminated in the police
shooting and killing a mountain lion after it
turned up in a Palo Alto residential area.
"We had our fair share of people who
were upset," Lt. Beacom said when asked
about the community's response to the
killing. "We expected that. No one wanted
to shoot the animal."
He added. "There was nowhere for the
animal to go and it was far from its natural
habitat. Mountain lions don't usually come
into highly populated areas."
Beacom said that if a similar situation
arose now. the police department would re
spond in the same way.

"We've done a lot of research and we
have a policy in place," he said. "Our num
ber-one concern is the safety of people. If we
deem an animal an imminent threat, and if
we have to take it out, and we have no other
option, then we will."
The presence of cougars has become
more apparent over the past few years, Bea
com added.
"Over the last year we've seen a lot of it,
not only in Palo Alto, but in other places in
the county, so it's beginning to be an issue.
There seem to be more cats than there used
to be just based on the sightings. The num
ber of sightings has gone way up."

turned up in a Palo Alto residential area.
"We had our fair share of people who
were upset," Lt. Beacom said when asked
about the community's response to the
killing. "We expected that. No one wanted
to shoot the animal."
He added. "There was nowhere for the
animal to go and it was far from its natural
habitat. Mountain lions don't usually come
into highly populated areas."
Beacom said that if a similar situation
arose now. the police department would re
spond in the same way.

"We've done a lot of research and we
have a policy in place," he said. "Our num
ber-one concern is the safety of people. If we
deem an animal an imminent threat, and if
we have to take it out, and we have no other
option, then we will."
The presence of cougars has become
more apparent over the past few years, Bea
com added.
"Over the last year we've seen a lot of it,
not only in Palo Alto, but in other places in
the county, so it's beginning to be an issue.
There seem to be more cats than there used
to be just based on the sightings. The num
ber of sightings has gone way up."
