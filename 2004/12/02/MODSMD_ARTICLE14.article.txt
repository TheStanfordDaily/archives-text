## 
### MARINA LIEBAN 
On Tuesday, the British Consulate Gener
al in San Francisco announced that current
Stanford seniors Sheena Chestnut and Ross
Perlin, co-terminal student Clara Shih, and
recent graduates Tarun Chhabra and Joe
Shapiro have been selected for the 2005 Mar
shall Scholarship.
Started in 1953. the Marshall Scholarship
provides American students the chance to
pursue their academic interests at a British
university of their choice. Funded by the
British government, the scholarships were
created as a sign of gratitude for the United
States' atd in rebuilding fcurope after World
War 11. The Marshall Scholarship covers all
university expenses, as well as living expens
es. book grants, thesis and research grants
and travel costs to and from the United States
for two to three academic years.
Each year, approximately 40 students are
selected for the award based on academic ex
cellence. commitment to public service and
leadership potential in their respective fields.
The five Stanford students selected this year
represent a variety of academic interests,
ranging from comparative studies of ancient
philosophers to applications of technology in
developing countries. Below are short bi
ographies of each of this year's Marshall
Scholars from Stanford.
Sheena Chestnut
A political science major working on her
honors thesis in international security stud
ies. Sheena became interested in the Mar
shall Scholarship after studying at Oxford
during her junior year and working at Lon
don's International Institute for Strategic
Studies last summer.
"I had talked to some people who were in
Oxford's M.Phil [the British equivalent of an

M.A.j program in International Relations,
and it seemed like the best way to get a
stronger background in the field," Chestnut
said. "Eventually I'd like to have a joint ca
reer in academia and government, and the
Marshall was a great step toward doing that."
Chestnut began the long application
process over the summer, researching British
institutions and drafting her personal state
ment. After returning to Stanford in the fall,
she successfully completed the on-campus
screening process and then submitted her ap
plication to the regional review committee. A
month later. Chestnut was selected for an in
terview at the office of the British Consulate-
General in vSan Francisco.
"Unlike some of the horror stories I'd
heard from previous applicants, my Marshall
interview was fairly pleasant," she said. "The
panel was friendly, and although their ques
tions were difficult, they were reasonably
straightforward."
Chestnut said that although she left the in
terview with a good feeling, she was still sur
prised to receive a phone call the next day in
forming her she had been selected.
" The woman who called asked about re
imbursing me for driving and parking expens
es and then at the end of the conversation
said, 'Oh and by the way, congratulations,
you've been selected!"' Chestnut said. "It
took me a minute to realize what she'd said
since I figured if I'd been selected she would
have started with that."
Besides majoring in Political Science and
writing her thesis, Sheena is also minoring in
creative writing and tutors at Hope House, a
rehabilitation center for women coming out of
the California criminal system. The Spokane,
WA native will pursue an M.Phil in Interna
tional Relations at the University of Oxford
next fall.

Ross Perlin
A double major in classics and East Asian
studies, Perlin cited his academic interests as
the primary reason he pursued the Marshall
Scholarship.
"1 think it (Marshall Scholarship] will give
me a fantastic opportunity to delve deeper
into the academic passions I've developed at
Stanford," he said. "England remains a great
place to work on ancient Greek philosophy
and has superb resources for studying East
Asian history and philosophy."
Perlin, originally from Amaganset, NY,
believes his proposed study of the compari
son between ancient Greek and Chinese
philosophies on abstract thought is what
helped him stand out in the competitive ap
plicant pool.
"What I want to work on is looking at how
Chinese and Greek philosophers articulated
abstract thought and what that says about the
two ancient societies and the development of
abstract thought in human societies in gener
al," Perlin said. "This kind of comparative
work is just beginning in formal academic set
tings, but I think it will make an important
contribution to East-West understanding."
Perlin is currently the president of the
Forum for American/Chinese Exchange at
Stanford (FACES), which brings together
qualified students from American and Chi
nese universities for delegations on U.S.-
China relations. He plans to use the first year
of his Marshall Scholarship to get an M.Phil
in Classics at the University of Cambridge
and tentatively plans to spend his second year
earning an M.A. in either Chinese or Sinolo
gy at the School of Oriental and African
Studies at the University of London.
Clara Shih
A double major in economics and com-

puter science and currently co-terming in
computer science, Shih said she was stunned
to learn of her selection as a Marshall scholar.
"The first person I called was my mom,
but she wasn't there, so I had to leave her a
message, which was disappointing," Shih
said. "The second person I called was my
brother. Then I told my Camp Amelia team."
Camp Amelia is the East Palo Alto-based
international non-profit organization Shih
founded that provides open-source educa
tional software for students and teachers.
Like all open-source programs. Camp
Amelia's software is part of the public do
main, which means that anyone can down
load. use and add new features to the soft
ware as long as it is returned to the public do
main.
"I volunteered in a lot of tech mentoring
programs in EPA, but I was never quite satis
fied," Shih said. The other volunteers and I
had our hearts in the right place but we were
CS students. PoliSci students, not teachers.
There was some value to what we were doing
but what if we could increase the invest
ment?"
Camp Amelia provides tutors and educa
tors "great teaching material" for their stu
dents. Shih said. Camp Amelia also operates
free summer and after-school technology pro
grams for underprivileged students at 12 loca
tions throughout the world.
Shih founded the organization two years
ago in part because she said she believes in
the tremendous potential of applying tech
nology to solve social problems. In doing so,
she said, the biggest challenge is education.
"You can't advance in other areas until
you have an educated and literate group,"
she said, adding that Camp Amelia fuses her
interests her in social work and computer sci
ence.
Born in Hong Kong and raised in a suburb

outside of Chicago, Shih plans to read fora
M.Sc in Economics for Development at the
University of Oxford.
Tarun Chhabra
Originally from Shreveport, La., Chhabra
graduated from Stanford, Phi Beta Kappa,
with dual degrees in Slavic Languages and
Literature and International Relations, as
well as interdisciplinary honors from Stan
ford's Center for International Security and
Cooperation. In his time at Stanford,
Chhabra directed the service fellowship pro
grams of Stanford in Government, worked
on the Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project
and interned at the U.S. Department of State
and the Center for Strategic and Internation
al Studies. Me currently works as a Research
Officer for the United Nations Secretary-
General's High Level Panel on Threats,
Challenges and Change. Chhabra plans to
study international relations at the Universi
ty of Oxford.
Joe Shapiro
Shapiro graduated Phi Beta Kappa from
Stanford in 2003 with distinctions in Eco
nomics and honors in Ethics in Society. His
honors thesis focused on the ethics of legaliz
ing kidney sales and was based on interviews
with kidney sellers in South Indian slums.
After graduating, Shapiro worked with the
World Bank and Mexico's Secretariat of Pub
lic Education to evaluate an education pro
gram for underprivileged Mexican youth.
Raised in Oregon, Shapiro now lives in
Washington D.C., where he works as Junior
Professional Associate for the World Bank.
He plans to pursue on M.Phil in Develop
ment Studies at the University of Oxford next
fall.
