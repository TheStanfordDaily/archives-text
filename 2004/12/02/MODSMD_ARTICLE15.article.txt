# Police change racial data system
## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO 
For the past four years, Palo Alto police officers
have recorded the race of every individual who is
stopped, including both pedestrians and vehicular pas
sengers. Officers record the racial data on a card and
later submit it to the Palo Alto Police Department for
analysis.
According to Palo Alto Police Chief Lynne John
son. the purpose of the Demographic Data Collection
system is to ensure that police are colorblind.
"There was some perception on the part of a few
people in the community that maybe some of our offi
cers were stopping people based ton their ethnicity," she
said.
Starting next year, however, Palo Alto police will
toss out the old data collection cards and begin elec
tronically recording racial data on only the drivers of
stopped vehicles.
The main reason for this switch is that the numbers
from the old system weren't accurate. Johnson ex
plained.
"First of all. because we're collecting (the informa
tion] manually and collating it manually, it's not accu
rate," she said. "We have the officers fill out the cards
for any contact that there's not a citation issued or a re
port made, and many times they have to go from call to
call and they don't have time to fill out the cards, so we
know the numbers aren't accurate."
The system is complicated further by the fact that
police officers do not ask contacts for their race and
sometimes ended up guessing, said Stanford Police
Chief Laura Wilson, who added that Stanford Police
currently use a similar system for collecting racial data.
"Asking a person about his or her race, ethnicity or
national origin will sometimes increase a person's level
of apprehension and / or cause a person who has been

stopped to feel as though they were a
"victim' of racial profiling," Wilson
said. "So. rather than escalate an al
ready potentially tense situation, of
ficers will make assumptions about a
person's race, ethnicity or national
origin."
As a result of these inaccuracies,
however, Johnson said she believed
that the system needed to be

changed.
"This is a serious issue and we
want to deal with the issue, but it
didn't make sense to deal with it and
put out data that is not accurate that
could cause people to have erro
neous perceptions," she said.
That in the last fiscal quarter, 451
searches were conducted and "21.7
percent of those searches were done

on Hispanics" is one example of data
that could he misconstrued, Johnson
said.
"But then we start to look at rea
sons why," she said. "There are many
Hispanics who are stopped and don't
have driver's licenses and then the
policy is that we tow the car and we're
required to do a search of the vehicle
before we tow the car. It's important
to not just look at the numbers, and
that's why we do some analysis."
Wilson said students should not
worry too much about the revised
policy in Palo Alto.
"I do not believe that Palo Alto
Police Department's decision will
impact the Stanford community."

however, argued that changes to the
Palo Alto Police Department could
affect minority students.
"What about all the people who
are walking?" he said. "(The change
to only profile drivers] might give
more power to the police to pull over
someone who is walking and know
that they won't be held accountable
for racial profiling. It might affect the
Stanford community in that when
minority students go out to the Palo
Alto area, they might get targeted."
Johnson disagreed.
"I do not believe that we have any
officer on our department who con
sciously stops people just because of
their ethnicity or skin color," she said.
