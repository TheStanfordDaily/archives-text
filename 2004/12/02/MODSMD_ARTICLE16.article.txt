## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Alter 24 years on the U.S. mainland. Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Gene Awakuni
will return home in the spring. Awakuni. who
graduated from the University of Hawaii's
main Manoa campus, recently accepted the
post of chancellor at the University of Hawaii-
West O'ahu campus. He will begin his three
year term on March 1,2005.
During his three-year term at Stanford,
Awakuni spearheaded various efforts to in
crease and improve student activities space.
This included overseeing the first floor reno
vation of Tresidder Memorial Union and plan
ning the complete renovation of Old Union
into a true student union, a project set to begin
construction in approximately IS months.
"I've tried to establish a close working rela
tionship with the students and have tried to
reach out to all student groups," Awakuni said
in an interview with The Daily. "When I first
arrived at Stanford, I noticed a bit of tension
between students and the administration, hut
now I feel that this has changed quite a lot. 1
hope that the administration continues to
strengthen its relationship with the student
body, especially in finding ways to provide
more resources and funds to student groups."
Throughout his time at Stanford, Awakuni
was respected by both students and fellow ad
ministrators. Associate Dean of Students and
Director of Student Activities Nanci Howe
has worked closely with Awakuni on a number
of projects. She praised the work he accom
plished in a reasonably short period of time.
"Vice Provost Awakuni should receive a
lot of credit for the work he has done in terms
of securing more space for students," she said.
"One of his greatest legacies is the student ac
tivities-space use plan, which is the first time
the University has come up with a comprehen
sive plan to tackle the issue of student space."

Howe also noted Awakuni's support for
ASSU's Absolute Fun program, designed to
encourage alcohol-free student events and ac
tivities across campus. He also helped to cre
ate the James Lyon intern program, designed
to give a student with previous background
and experience in student leadership the op
portunity to work closely with the vice
provost.
Senior Joey Natoli, former ASSU Vice
President and current James Lyons Intern to
the Vice Provost of Student Affairs, has inter
acted with Awakuni for over two years and de
veloped a close working relationship with him.
"Vice Provost Awakuni fully believed in
empowering students and the student voice,"
Natoli said. "Almost as important, he told stu
dents the truth. Throughout my term in the
ASSU, Vice Provost Awakuni would explain
the difficulties the University was facing, and
explain ways to more efficiently accomplish
projects."
Senior Michael Ortiz, who worked as a stu
dent aide in the Office of the Vice Provost for
Student Affairs, also lauded Awakuni's
progress in improving Stanford's housing,
food services and student activity space.
"I came to see Student Affairs as a symbol
of Vice Provost Awakuni's commitment to
providing quality education and services to the
Stanford community," he said. "Vice Provost
Awakuni built an innovative and compassion
ate staff, fostered a positive and accepting
work environment, and demonstrated a clear
dedication to Stanford students."
According to Awakuni, this close relation
ship with students is one of the hallmarks of his
Stanford career.
"I'm really struck by how incredibly talent
ed and down-to-earth the students are here,"
he said. "I've especially come to notice this
more berng a Resident Fellow in Lantana. The
students are brilliant, doing 50.1)00 things at
once, but still remain carina and considerate. I

will remember the students with a great deal of
fondness."
"I was proud to learn Vice Provost Awaku
ni was named Chancellor of the University of
Hawaii-West O'ahu," Ortiz said. "I have al
ways admired Vice Provost Awakuni's acade
mic and intellectual abilities, his determina
tion to achieve the highest goals, and his sense
of humor. I cannot think of anyone, as dedi
cated as him, who would be more deserving of
this appointment."
