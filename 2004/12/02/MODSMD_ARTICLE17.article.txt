### XIN XIE 
Stanford is one of four testing sites
fora clinical trial of a new smallpox vac
cine from biopharmaceutical company
Vax Gen Inc., though it is unclear
whether the University will profit from
the trial.
Stanford was chosen, company offi
cials said, because of its track record of
groundbreaking research and reputabil
ity.
"The study seeks to evaluate the effi
cacy of LCl6mB (the new vaccine] in
terms of its safety and ability to induce
an immune response," said Kasseni Yip,
associate director of communications
for Vax Gen. "Our objective is to help
the government obtain an emergency
stockpile of attenuated smallpox vac
cine and to license the vaccine for com
mercial sales. We are pleased to be
working with an institution of Stanford's
caliber," Yip added.
According to Marc Gurwith. who is
head of medical affairs at Vax Gen, the
company chose Stanford because of the
quality and experience of its researchers
at the medical school.
"We chose Stanford because many
researchers at the medical school have
experience working with vaccines, espe
cially the smallpox vaccine," he said.
"Stanford's role in the clinical trials con
sists of testing the vaccine on healthy
volunteers and conducting some addi
tional lab research." Gurwith added.
Vax Gen CEO and President Lance
Gordon echoed this sentiment.
"We are very pleased to be working
with Stanford, a very reputable organi
zation." he said. "I worked at Stanford in
the 1960s and am pleased to see our in
volvement with them."
The other three testing sites are the

University of Kentucky School of Medi
cine. Saint Louis University Health Sci
ences Center and Vanderbilt University
Medical Center.
Whether Stanford is profiting from
the clinical trials is unclear.
"We are still working on the contract,
so at this point there's nothing 1 can dis
close about the study," said Assoc. Pro
fessor of Pediatrics Cornelia Dekker,
who is involved in the trial.
According to Ruthann Richter, di
rector of media relations at the School of
Medicine, the decision to collaborate
with Vax Gen was not financially driven.
"As far as Stanford profiting from the
trial, we don't get profits from any clini
cal trials we do here," she said.
Yip disputed this, however, saying
that the University would profit from
the trials.
"Like any other contract, there is an
agreement," she said.
Gordon declined to comment
whether Stanford would profit, but ex
plained how payments are determined.
"Stanford provides us with a budget
that includes overhead and other costs,
and we negotiate with them to deter
mine our costs," he said. "Our costs in
clude those of investigation, study nurs
es, clinic time, clinics and payments to
test subjects."
The vaccine has already been li
censed for use in Japan and forms the
backbone of that country's national
smallpox vaccine stockpile, according to
Yip. Vax Gen's vaccine differs from the
one currently used in the United States
in that "it has been cultured from vac
cinia virus that has been attenuated, or
modified, with the goal of reducing side
effects," she said.
"We are working to make the vaccine
available in the United States," Yip said.
