# Hillel sends students to Israel for free in winter
## 
### ADAM WIDMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
About 30 Stanford students are
preparing to embark on an all-ex
pense-paid 10-day trip to Israel dur
ing winter break.
Because the trip is free, it marks
a rare opportunity for Jewish stu
dents to visit a place of unique cul
tural and religious importance
without the financial burdens usu
ally associated with overseas trav
el. Also, because the focus of the
trip is not religion, participants are
able to choose how they want to
experience Israel.
"For some people Israel is a very
religious experience, and for others
it is a cultural experience," said
sophomore Joel Englander. a partic
ipant in the upcoming trip. "For me,
Israel is a great opportunity to con
nect to the history of the Jewish peo
ple and Jewish culture."
The Stanford trip to Israel will
most likely tour a large part of the
country and contain stops in big
cities like Jerusalem and Tel Aviv
and popular tourist attractions like
the Dead Sea.
The program is run through Stan
ford's Hillel organization and the in
ternational birthright israel pro
gram, a non-profit group that spon
sors and pays for Israeli travel pro
grams for young Jewish adults who
have never before been to Israel
with their peers. The program is sup
ported by donations from Jewish
communities, foundations and indi
vidual philanthropists.
According to Tali Golan, the Se
nior Jewish Campus Service Corps
Fellow for Stanford Hillel, the
birthright israel trip can introduce
students to a variety of new cultural
experiences and can teach students
about the meaning of Israel histori
cally and in the modern world.
"Students experience contempo
rary Israeli culture and get a taste for
what it feels like to live in Israel
where Jewish people form a majori
ty, whereas Jews are a minority in
everv other countrv." Golan said.

"Many students want to participate
in the trip because they want to feel
more connected to their roots, want
to learn more about the conflict in
the Middle East, to meet family that
they have never met before who live
in Israel or to connect to their reli
gion in the place where it historically
started."
Past birthright israel participants
say the atmosphere created by the
peer group nature of the program
boosts their ability to comprehend
and enjoy what they learn on the trip.
"I benefited by going on the trip
with my peers because 1 was able to
share my experiences and discuss
them with others in the same posi
tion as myself," said senior Avi
Yotam, who participated in a
birthright israel trip last June. "This
discussion made the experience
even more real by allowing and even
occasionally forcing me to reflect on
what the country was and how great
a time I was having."
While the birthright israel trip has
tremendous advantages and benefits
for participating students, violence
resulting from the longstanding con
flict between Israelis and Palestini
ans makes security a serious issue.
I lowever. Golan said that the excep
tional security measures taken by
birthright israel and the unique op
portunity the program presents to
Jewish students has calmed fears for
most participants.
"Birthright israel takes extremely
high security measures, and this
makes students feel much more se
cure." she said. "Also. Jewish stu
dents are realizing that the future is
unpredictable, and while we all hope
that there will be peace soon, they
understand that this is an opportuni
ty they should not pass even given
the difficult times."
Yet for many of the students trav
eling to Israel this winter, security
concerns and expectations seem
small when compared to a simple de
sire.
"I always wanted to travel to Is
rael. and ii's free," said sophomore
Jessica Harris.
