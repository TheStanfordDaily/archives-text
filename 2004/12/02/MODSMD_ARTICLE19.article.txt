# Study breaks aim to ease Dead Week stress
## 
### NILA BALA 
Pastries flew through the air and landed on stu
dents' feet as a University-sponsored pie-eating
contest turned into a food-fight frenzy in under 10
seconds Tuesday night.
The event, sponsored by Stern Dining, Cyber
Cafe and the ASSU, was just one of the zany
study breaks planned by campus groups in an at
tempt to de-stress students during Dead Week.
Other efforts include the popular "Secret
Snowflake," a freshman dorm activity in which
students rate themselves from a scale of one
(tame) to five (wild) and perform tasks assigned
to them by their unknown partner all week long.
"All freshmen dorms do Secret Snowflake on
Monday. Tuesday and Wednesday," said JT Bat
son. a resident assistant at Cedro. "It's a lot of fun
and everyone seems to have a good time. I really
think it makes a big difference for the kids."
Many dorms organize theme nights ranging
from "Summer in Winter," complete with beach
volleyball and s'mores, to "Cafe Night," featur
ing student performances.
"The RAs buy us lots of food, which is awe
some," said Diane Cheng, a freshman in West
Lagunita, adding that RAs put a lot of effort into
making study breaks work. "Study breaks are a
really big de-stresser because they are both
ridiculous and entertaining. I'm excited about
Cafe Night."
Some students, however, believe that study
breaks are a mixed blessing and in some ways de
tract from studying.
"This week is almost too much of a distrac
tion." said Larkin freshman Jessi Reel. "I think

and plan all afternoon for Secret Snowflake and
the study breaks. A 10-minute study break is
good, but it's hard to make sure the studying part
is before the study break part."
Dorms have found other creative, and some
what less complicated, ways to relax students.
Dean of Freshmen / Sophomore College John
Bravman has found the activities of this week to
be immensely helpful to students.
"There is always a pizza night one of the days
with all 150 kids in my house." he said. "Monday
night was swing dance night and karaoke is [to
morrow], Each night of the week we do some
thing to de-stress the kids."
Spartacus Locus, a freshman in FroSoCo who
also attended the pie-eating contest, agreed that
FroSoCo's study breaks are successful.
"They serve as a distraction that keeps people
from doing work." he said. "FroSoCo's study
breaks are evidently really tame compared to
other dorms, and it fits into the mode of FroSoCo
anyway. I like their study breaks better because 1
actually get work done."
Melissa Luu-Van. a RAin Larkin, said that
she believes study breaks are important and cre
ate lasting memories.
"Study breaks like Secret Snowflake make stu
dents do crazy things they might otherwise never
do. 1 still remember study breaks from my fresh
man and sophomore year. Our study breaks at
Larkin have been pretty memorable, things that
the students will look back on and remember."
The ASSU. Stanford Dining and the Office of
the Vice Provost for Student Affairs are sponsor
ing a "Primal Snack" on Sunday, where free
Krispy Kreme donuts and milk will be given out.
