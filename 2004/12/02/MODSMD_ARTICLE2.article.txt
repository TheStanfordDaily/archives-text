# Complaints spur Munger revision
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has released a new site plan for the
controversial Munger Graduate Residences,
adding a fourth building and reducing the length
and height of others. The revised plans emerged
from concerns over the imposing size of the build
ings originally proposed.
"This new plan is a collaborative effort be
tween the community, the donor and Stanford."
said Vice President for Public Affairs Gordon
Earle. "There was a lot of outreach; we listened
carefully and made adjustments based on what we
heard."
The new plan displaces two more buildings
from Salvatierra Walk — Serra House and Mira
posa House — in addition to three houses that
were already being relocated under the previous
design.
I'he site plan has been approved by donor
Charles T. Munger and will be presented to the
Board of Trustees fora vote on Dec. 13. Associate
Vice Provost for Facilities Chris Christofferson
noted that the plan still includes 600 beds, as stip
ulated by the University's agreement with
Munger.
"We're spreading the project out and making it
less dense." he said. "And we've improved the cir
culation through the buildings."
The new site design does not affect the pro
posed 750-car underground parking garage or
plans to widen Campus Drive from two to four
lanes between Alvarado Row and Mayfield Ave.
Among other effects, widening the road will re
duce the sidewalk and lawn of cooperative house
Chi Theta Chi.
According to University Provost John
Etchemendy, plans to widen Campus Drive have

been on the agenda for over 20 years and are not
directly linked to the Munger project.
"The planned widening was included in the
original plans for the Pearce Mitchell housing pro
ject decades ago," Etchemendy said. "We decided
to schedule the widening at the same time as the
Munger project so that we would minimize the
construction disruption on that part of campus."
Some community members complained that
the plans still fail to address their major concerns.
"This is totally inadequate and in fact worse
than the previous design," said co-terminal stu
dent Emily L.eslie, a house manager at Chi Theta
Chi. "These structures are an extravagant and to
tally inefficient use of space, water and energy.
They provide individual bathrooms for every bed
and much more space and facilities such as wash
ers and dryers than needed, and require pointless
relocation of two additional historic buildings in
the new revision."
The graduate dorms will cost over $ 100 million,
funded in part by a $43.5 million gift from Munger,
who is the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway
and a partner at the Munger. Tolles and Olson law
firm. His wife. Nancy, is a Stanford alumna and
former member of the Board of Trustees.
After University officials announced the plans
in September, many community members criti
cized the project for its large size and its potential
impact on the Stanford campus.
Concerned students, faculty, staff and residents
gathered on Tuesday fora "think in" to spread
awareness of the project and to protest the current
design. Red and black balloons floated above the
Stern Hall and Nathan Abbott parking lots, repre
senting the project's layout and height. Communi
ty members stood at the intersection of Campus
Drive and Alvarado Row handing out fliers and

relocation of two more houses to make way
