Stanford's newest museum, the
Matthias K. Rath Museum of Destruction
and Resurrection, opened to the public in
October. Its collection includes a shrine
dedicated to its namesake, European car
diologist and political activist Matthias K.
Rath, ancient Obsidian tools and a Shaman
rug pinned to the ceiling.
But to get to the exhibits, you may have
to walk through piles of books and clothes
on the floor.
The museum is located in the third floor
of cooperative house Kairos, in a room still
occupied by seniors Nick Casey, karan
Mahajan and Ross Perlin. The three are
the museum's founders and curators.
The items on display were collected by
the three students over the summer while
Casey was in Micronesia, part of the Pacif
ic Islands, Mahajan was in India and Ross
was in Central Asia. China, Russia and
Turkey.
The purpose of the museum is to
"evoke wonder, to sustain it and to pro
mote it," Perlin said. The museum also
promotes the practice of futurology, and
the curators attempt to "add multiple lay
ers to all of the exhibits."
Interactive exhibits also abound. In the
"echo corridor," people can stand on an
"X" marked by tape and hear the sounds of
their claps return to them.
As far as the curators know, "residential
museumology began here." Casey said.
Thev are unaware of anv other residential

museums cither on campus or at other
schools, hut they hope that a residential
museum may eventually become more of
an art form.
Other students residing in Kairos great
ly support the museum. They have started,
and for the most part joined, the group on
TheFacebook.com entitled "Friends of the
Matthias K. Rath Museum of Destruction
and Resurrection."
The museum receives its most visitors
on Fridays, with about 10 to 20 viewers.
The curators also claim that it is a popular
destination for dates.
"People always want to share in the
past, but more than anything, people want
to share in the future," Mahajan said,
adding that he and his two roommates f>ive
about five tours a day on weekdays.
The museum is open 24 hours a day.and
Perlin said that if the door is ajar, then visi
tors are welcome. The space can accom
modate 12 to 20 people at a time. Tours can
be arranged by e-mailing one of the cura
tors.
Mahajan pointed out that visitors to the
museum have included poet Heather
Mcllugh. a visiting poet at Stanford who is
teaching a course called "The Occasions of
Poetry." and Bissera Pentcheva, a Bulgari
an Byzantine scholar who is teaching the
course "Byzantine Art and Architecture"
at Stanford this quarter.
Perlin and Casey are planning on teach
ing a one-unit course this winter entitled
"House of Wonders."
