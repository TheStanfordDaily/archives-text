## Playing it straight Bears? What about the Goose? 
### 
Turkey Day. There's so much to
give thanks for, it's hard to know
where to begin. We'd definitely like
to give thanks for ail the great re
sponses we received to last week's
column ("Go Bears!"). You have all
provided us with so much entertain
ing material that we just don't know
where to start or end.
Apparently, last week's article cre
ated quite a maelstrom at Berkeley,
circulating aggressively through the
CalMail system and apparently even
making it onto a number of alumni e
mail lists. We didn't believe it at first,
but the proof is in the pudding. It all
started with our bold statement:
"Berkeley is pretty much unequivo-

cally better than
Stanford." We're
sorry to admit it,
but we don't real
ly think that's
true.
Berkeley's
got us beat in
some categories,
hut we hold the
trump card in
others. Ulti
mately, one isn't
better than the
other, and we
think there's no

point in getting worked up about it.
They're different. Different is good.
Let's all celebrate.
We received garbage loads of e
mails from Berkeley students ex
tolling the virtues of the superior
Berkeley experience, good ol' Blues
reminiscing about foolhardy Big
Game plays from the days of yore,
and chill dudes high off late-night
bong rips giving us 'wassups,'
'LOLs,' and invitations to discuss
Chomsky over some good curry.
The only Stanford people who
read our column (and cared enough
to comment) apparently saw it on
their Berkeley friends' AIM profiles
or received it through the alumni
grapevine. Actually, one dude from
our eating club apparently saw a
paper copy, and he threatened to
punch Mark's head. Seems our col
umn of words made mincemeat of his
emotions. Holler!
Anyway, what was the final score
in this e-mail competition? Another
rousing rout. Berkeley 150. Stanford
15 (all of whom were freshmen and
alumni).
Back to the data, or pudding, if
you will. It implies a few things. 1)
Nobody at Stanford reads The Daily,
or if they do, they just don't email us.
2) Stanfurd(?) doesn't really care
about the rivalry all that much. 3)
Berkeley really does. We will dive
deeper into the implications of these
inferences, but first we just want to
share with you some of the responses
we got.
"You ROCK!"... And roll.
"Your points are salient with nary
a mark of nescience." ... Sorry, we
already took the GRE.
"If you can't appreciate Stanford
for what it is. go to your 'real world'
(so you're telling me the pot-reeking,
shroom-infested Berkeley campus is
closer to reality?) What crack are
you on?" ... Only Escobar's finest.
"I am madly and deeply in love
with you and your tender words." ...
Next, please.
"Now I realize that Cal is much
more of a fun. interesting, young col
lege student's place and I'm starting
to be glad I'm here once again." ...
Glad we could help.
"You guys clearly aren't putting
in enough quality time at the Dutch
Goose." ... Very good point, we
love the Goose!
We even got a girl to consider
transferring to Stanford from Berke
ley! But that's a long story for anoth
er day.
Seriously though, the onslaught of
responses revealed something far
more disturbing than the Dollies'
outfits at Big Game. There seems to
be a very genuine disdain for Stan
ford students from our friends across
the bay. Just chill out. people! We
don't hate you. we love you.
But there also seems to be a pre
tentious undertone amongst some
(but not all) of our colleagues here
on the Farm that perpetuates this
contempt. You should also chill out.
people! Going to Stanford doesn't
make you better than anybody. We
hope last week's article was the first
step in healing the ills between both
fine institutions. Go Crimson!

Secretly wish you went to Harvard
so you could feel comfortable with
your elitism? E-mail Mark at mc
slee@stanford and Evan an
etana@stanford.edu. They've got a
wicked old bov's network.

where to begin. We'd definitely like
to give thanks for ail the great re
sponses we received to last week's
column ("Go Bears!"). You have all
provided us with so much entertain
ing material that we just don't know
where to start or end.
Apparently, last week's article cre
ated quite a maelstrom at Berkeley,
circulating aggressively through the
CalMail system and apparently even
making it onto a number of alumni e
mail lists. We didn't believe it at first,
but the proof is in the pudding. It all
started with our bold statement:
"Berkeley is pretty much unequivo-

cally better than
Stanford." We're
sorry to admit it,
but we don't real
ly think that's
true.
Berkeley's
got us beat in
some categories,
hut we hold the
trump card in
others. Ulti
mately, one isn't
better than the
other, and we
think there's no

point in getting worked up about it.
They're different. Different is good.
Let's all celebrate.
We received garbage loads of e
mails from Berkeley students ex
tolling the virtues of the superior
Berkeley experience, good ol' Blues
reminiscing about foolhardy Big
Game plays from the days of yore,
and chill dudes high off late-night
bong rips giving us 'wassups,'
'LOLs,' and invitations to discuss
Chomsky over some good curry.
The only Stanford people who
read our column (and cared enough
to comment) apparently saw it on
their Berkeley friends' AIM profiles
or received it through the alumni
grapevine. Actually, one dude from
our eating club apparently saw a
paper copy, and he threatened to
punch Mark's head. Seems our col
umn of words made mincemeat of his
emotions. Holler!
Anyway, what was the final score
in this e-mail competition? Another
rousing rout. Berkeley 150. Stanford
15 (all of whom were freshmen and
alumni).
Back to the data, or pudding, if
you will. It implies a few things. 1)
Nobody at Stanford reads The Daily,
or if they do, they just don't email us.
2) Stanfurd(?) doesn't really care
about the rivalry all that much. 3)
Berkeley really does. We will dive
deeper into the implications of these
inferences, but first we just want to
share with you some of the responses
we got.
"You ROCK!"... And roll.
"Your points are salient with nary
a mark of nescience." ... Sorry, we
already took the GRE.
"If you can't appreciate Stanford
for what it is. go to your 'real world'
(so you're telling me the pot-reeking,
shroom-infested Berkeley campus is
closer to reality?) What crack are
you on?" ... Only Escobar's finest.
"I am madly and deeply in love
with you and your tender words." ...
Next, please.
"Now I realize that Cal is much
more of a fun. interesting, young col
lege student's place and I'm starting
to be glad I'm here once again." ...
Glad we could help.
"You guys clearly aren't putting
in enough quality time at the Dutch
Goose." ... Very good point, we
love the Goose!
We even got a girl to consider
transferring to Stanford from Berke
ley! But that's a long story for anoth
er day.
Seriously though, the onslaught of
responses revealed something far
more disturbing than the Dollies'
outfits at Big Game. There seems to
be a very genuine disdain for Stan
ford students from our friends across
the bay. Just chill out. people! We
don't hate you. we love you.
But there also seems to be a pre
tentious undertone amongst some
(but not all) of our colleagues here
on the Farm that perpetuates this
contempt. You should also chill out.
people! Going to Stanford doesn't
make you better than anybody. We
hope last week's article was the first
step in healing the ills between both
fine institutions. Go Crimson!

Secretly wish you went to Harvard
so you could feel comfortable with
your elitism? E-mail Mark at mc
slee@stanford and Evan an
etana@stanford.edu. They've got a
wicked old bov's network.
