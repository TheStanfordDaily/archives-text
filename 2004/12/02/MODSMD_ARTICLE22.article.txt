# What's in vogue for Dead Week...
## The 						Stanford Sweatshirt 
### SARAH LUSTBADER DESK EDITOR 
In many ways, Dead Week is an apt description of the seven days preceding the end-quarter examination period. Parties are few and far between, the dating scene is even more piti
-1 ill than it is during the typical unromantic week at Stanford, exercise falls by the wayside and some students even find their spirits a little crushed.
One aspect of campus lite, however, stands alone in its refusal to lose its vibrancy and vitality during this week of drudgery: fashion. Stanford students are even more creative, imagi
native and cutting-edge this week than maybe at any other moment during the year. What follows is a random cross-section of students strutting their stuff around school Tuesday:

Name: Tim Caflisch
Yean Freshman
Major: Undeclared
Daily: So Tim, who are you wearing this af
ternoon?
Tim: Um. I'm wearing a hoodie and some
pants.
Daily: How did you pick out your outfit
today?
Tim: Sweats are pretty comfortable.
Daily: Did you purchase this outfit specifi
cally to wear during Dead Week?
Tim: No. well, the pants were given to me.
The hoodie was given to me, too. So no.
Daily: What's your favorite thing about
Dead Week?
Tim: It just seems like another week to me.

Name: Cathy Bao Nguyen
Year: Senior
Major: Urban Studies
Daily: What is your name?
Cathy: Cathy.
Daily: What is your quest?
Cathy: Right now? To graduate on time.
Dailv: What is vour favorite color?
Cathy: Red.
Daily: Tell me a little bit about your outfit
today, Cathy.
Cathy: I'm wearing my Stanford sweatshirt
that I've had for five years with a rip in the
pocket, a thermal underneath, tube socks and
some jeans that look pretty bad in the butt.
Daily: How did you choose this particular
outfit this morning?
Cathy: It's what I fell asleep in last night and
when I woke up I just put on a bra, threw my
hair in a ponytail and went out.

Name: Rachel Dauford
Year: Freshman
Major: Undeclared
Daily: How is your first Dead Week going?
Rachel: It's not too bad, I didn't take too
many units so 1 don't have too
many finals.
Daily: How's I-Hum?
Rachel: It's I-Hum.
Daily: What's your favorite breakfast cereal?
Rachel: I like Raisin Bran.
Daily: Nice choice. I like Raisin Bran, too.
One last question: Does Branner
suck?
Rachel: Yeah, I'm pretty sure it does.

Name: Victor Marsh, Alexis Franklin
Year: Seniors
Major: IK, Political Science
Daily: Do you have a name for your outfit
today?
Victor: This is my "ready to roll" gear. It's for
late-study-and-early-morning-studv-with-a
five-hour-nap-in-between days.
Alexis: Sweats are pretty much a staple for me,
because it doesn't matter
what you have on underneath. Nobody knows!
I look like I match, right? But
I could be wearing some green thing under this
and you'd have no idea.
Daily: That's true. Did you get any cool mail
today?
Alexis: Urn, they're changing the trustees on
my bond. That's kind of cool.
Daily: In some cultures. So, what do you two
enjoy most about Dead Week ?
Alexis: The lonely nights when I'm sitting on
my floor, rocking myself back
and forth, weeping softly.
Dailv: And we're done.
