# Stanford students volunteer to help the homeless

You don't have to travel to a big city fora reality check — it
only takes a 10-minute drive to some of Stanford's neighboring
communities, or even a walk down University Avenue. During
the holiday season many people volunteer in soup kitchens,
collect goods for toy and food drives. But for many Stanford
students, helping those in need is a year-round priority.
Recognizing the disparity between the Bay Area's affluent
residents and the low-income and homeless population, indi
viduals and student groups take it upon themselves to try to al
leviate problems such as hunger and lack of affordable hous
ing for the residents in surrounding communities.
Last Friday, in conjunction with the end of the holy month
of Ramadan, first-year graduate student Marwaan Cliaar and
other Muslim students on campus organized an event to do
nate nonperishable food items to East Palo Alto residents.
One of the purposes of fasting during Ramadan is to feel the
hunger of those in need. Combining this experience with char
ity. one of the five pillars of Islam, Chaar felt that he needed to
do something about the disparity between East Palo Alto and
Palt) Alto.
"What I hoped to accomplish was to help people gain
awareness of the large number of people in the area who
are in need of help and, in particular, address the problem
of hunger," Chaar said.
Chaar solicited donations from campus organizations like
the Muslim Student Awareness Network, the Islamic Society
of Stanford University and Outreach to Asian Immigrant Stu
dents. The groups provided either monetary or food contribu
tions. Chaar and other students raised over $700. On Nov. 19.
Chaar and 10 other students dropped off the nonperishable
foods at the Urban Ministry in Palo Alto. The Urban Ministry
distributed the donated items to the poor and homeless in East
Palo Alto.
Chaar is not alone in his efforts to provide food for com
munities in need. Several fraternities and sororities on cam
pus. such as Kappa Kappa Gamma and Theta Delta Chi, de
liver breakfast foods such as pancakes, eggs and potatoes to a
local homeless shelter in Menlo Park twice a month.
"I think people who participate get a glimpse of life off
campus and hopefully have fun at the same time," said se
nior Kian Eftekhari of Theta Delta Chi.
The Stanford Project on Hunger, also known as SPOON, is
also involved in providing food to less fortunate communities
surrounding Stanford. At the end of each week, SPOON vol
unteers collect unused food from dining halls, the Faculty
Club and other eateries and events on campus. These foods
are then donated to the Urban Ministry, which in turn serves
the food to those in need of assistance.
"SPOON's main mission — to salvage unused dining hall
food and make sure it feeds people in need — really appealed
to me and allowed me to be a part of reducing food waste,"

said junior Rohit Sharda, co-director of SPOON.
While SPOON's main goal is to eliminate waste, it also pro
motes direct student involvement in the community. Through
the Breakfast Cook program, teams of five to 10 students cook
and serve breakfast to the hungry and homeless at the Urban
Ministry every Monday morning.
"I think that volunteers obtain a sense of fulfillment and
pride in being able to reduce food waste on campus, as well as
humility and understanding," Sharda said.
The Urban Ministry is an organization that provides assis
tance for low-income residents and the homeless in the Mid-
Peninsula area.
"Urban Ministry has a very long history of support from the
Stanford Community," said Brooke Scharnke, director of
Urban Ministry. "Various campus groups purchase, cook and
serve hot breakfasts at our drop-in center each morning dur
ing the school year. At the end of each term, we receive hun
dreds of pounds of food from the dining halls."
Scharnke also said that Stanford students assist with her or
ganization's annual spring clothing drive and provides indis
pensable volunteers and interns to assist them throughout the
year.
Hunger is only one of the problems afflicting East Palo
Alto. Data from Plugged In. an organization that educates
people on technology usage, shows that East Palo Alto's aver
age income is only $13,774 per capita. Despite the communi
ty's proximity to Stanford and Silicon Valley, Plugged In says
East Palo Alto lacks a local high school and many of its resi
dents are struggling economically.
According to Plugged In, housing is one of the core prob
lems afflicting the community. The technological boom led to
an increase in rent. Many low-income residents live in over
crowded buildings and are struggling with severe housing cost
burdens. The average rent now requires a job paying at least
$25 an hour.
Recognizing this problem, the Stanford chapter of Habitat
for Humanity tries to help by fundraising and organizing vol
unteer house builds for those who cannot afford a home.
"I think people truly enjoy participating in Habitat for Hu
manity just for the sake of helping out in their community,"
said junior Claire Schmidt, president of the Stanford chapter
of Habitat for Humanity.
Stanford Habitat organizes builds two to four times per
quarter in nearby communities such as Redwood City. Habi
tat also organizes an annual fundraiser in the fall called the
Home Run Race, which raises about $15,000 for Bay Area
Habitat chapters.
Many students on campus acknowledge the importance of
using the resources and opportunities available at Stanford to
help the surrounding communities.
"I'd much rather have my special fees go to organizations
helping the community than to organizations that benefit only
a limited number of people," said junior Andres Odio.

ing breakfast foods.
