## Editorials Buddy's exit gives team a fresh start 
### 
Alter three years of coaching the Stanford
football team, Buddy Teevens has been
fired. Athletics Director Ted Leland dis
missed Teevens on Monday, saying it was
a difficult decision but that the program was in need
of new direction and leadership.
Hopes were high for Teevens when he was hired to
lead Cardinal football after the loss of Coach Tyrone
Willingham to Notre Dame in 2002. However,
Teevens has now finished his tenure at Stanford with
a dismal 10-23 record in three straight losing seasons.
Worse, the team has appeared to regress as each sea
son has gone on, always starting well but ending the
year with a string of embarrassing blowout losses.
Letting Teevens go was the only sensible option
it will allow Leland to choose another coach to
give the football team a fresh start.
Not only will this move restore the faith of the play
ers on the football team, but it will also renew hope
among students, alumni and fans disheartened by the
team's poor performance in recent years.
Teevens acknowledged that he did not meet expec
tations on the field: "Unfortunately, it's a win-loss
business and 1 didn't win enough ballgames. The atti-

tude I have is I do believe I improved the quality of the
program."
Most people typically define the quality of a team
by the number of games it can win, and in this respect,
Teevens did not succeed. Notably, it has been three
Big Games since Teevens took over the team, and
three years that Stanford has come home without the
coveted Axe. The humiliating third Big Game loss sev
eral weeks ago was likely the final straw.
Although being fired is generally a painful and
sometimes bitter experience, Teevens has handled the
decision with characteristic grace, opting to be present
at the press conference announcing his dismissal. He
said of the University: "I had a wonderful time here at
Stanford. It's a very, very special place, and I do be
lieve Stanford can have great football success."
Many have noted the upbeat spirit that Teevens
brought to the football program. While this was not
enough to make the Cardinal successful, players will
likely remember and appreciate his positive attitude.
Teevens might have helped the team develop during
the past three years, but the prospects for "great football
success" are much greater now that the team is receiv
ing a much-needed change in leadership.
