# Avoid credit card debt as rates rise
## 
### 
Corporate hanks aggressively market their
credit cards to students. Lately, however,
these companies have been increasing the
interest rates and late fees that are charged
when applicable. To stay out of credit card debt,
students should watch their spending this holiday
season.
According to The New York Times and PBS,
credit card companies are changing the terms of their
accounts to historically high rates. This hits students
hard, because as first time credit users, they are more
likely to not pay their bill on time. With final exams
approaching, it would he easy for students to miss the
due date, but there is good reason to make sure this
doesn't happen.
Credit card companies attract customers with
promises of a 0 percent annual percentage rate. How
ever, students must be careful to read the fine print.
In most of these deals, the 0 percent interest rate is
short-lived and often raised to 16 percent or higher
after a period of several months.
After a IW6 Supreme Court decision, credit card

regulations were loosened. Today, credit card com
panies can charge students a late fee of up to $39,
which may rise even further.
To avoid egregious interest rates and late fees, stu
dent must stay out of credit card debt. Phis entails ap
propriate planning for the holiday season. To make
personal finance management easier, some banks
offer online bill payment.
Debit cards are also a popular means of avoiding
debt. Unlike credit cards, which let you pay later,
debit cards pay the bill right away by subtracting the
amount from a checking account. They are essential
ly an electronic form of cash.
Anyone who is in a lot of credit card debt should
pay it off as soon as possible to avoid astronomical in
terest payments. If that is impossible, students can
take out lower interest rate loans through a commer
cial bank to lower the monthly payments.
There are a lot of ways to stay out of debt, but ul
timately the burden falls on the individual.
As the holidays approach, students would be well
served to spend within their means.
