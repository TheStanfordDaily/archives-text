## Stanford's traditions merit more respect 
### PATRICK HOLSBERRY 
This is in response to Mark Slee
and Evan Tana's column ("Go
Bears," Nov. 22):
UC Berkeley is better because
their students live in the real
world? Ballyhoo, indeed. Stop the
malarkey. What are ballyhoo and
malarkey?
Tana and Slee are full of more
rubbish than the streets of Berkeley.
Let's start with the bold / ludi
crous statement that Berkeley is
"unequivocally better" than Stan
ford because its students are "living
in the real world." Forcing students
to scrounge for off-campus housing
because there aren't any adequate
facilities for the majority of the stu
dents who desire on-campus hous
ing does not make Berkeley better.
Is living in an off-campus apart
ment that is a car / bus commute
away and dealing with annoying
landlords a worthwhile "real world
experience" to have in college? It
can wait — we'll have the rest of
our lives to deal with it.
Let's continue with the compar
ison of institutions. Much less rig
orous education? How many Stan
ford students read that statement
and think of their most recent late
night problem set or paper session,
weekend study group, or that peri
od of days / weeks where you and
the Green Library receptionist got
to be on a first-name basis?
Continuing with reference to
our milk-and-cookies meetings
with our UACs. .. These aren't
coddling affairs, but students re
ceiving expert assistance for tough,
future-impacting decisions one
can't expect a naive 18-year-old to
make alone.
We have the tremendous free
dom to explore different classes
and areas before choosing a major.
At Berkeley, no one cares about
you — you are forced to choose
your major in high school, and
you're pretty much stuck with it.
Maybe by less rigorous the

columnists mean working in an en
vironment without having to worry
about your lab experiments being
sabotaged, or an environment
where your professors and their
teaching assistants aren't as inacces
sible as University President John
Hennessy when you want to talk
labor rights for university workers.
If so, then 1 will concede that we
have a less rigorous institution, and
one that I'll take any day.
With regard to the surroundings of
the farm, I will concede that Universi
ty Ave. is not the ideal place to hang
out or get a nice-priced meal, and it
docs not compare to the wonderful
variety of delicious hole-in-the-wall
restaurants and great little shops lit
tering the surrounding streets of the
Berkeley campus. However, I don't
know about you. but shopping didn't
make it to my list of top criteria fora
choosing a University.
Responding to Slee and Tana's
disparaging of the bust dot-com va
grants of Palo Alto and praising
the homeless crack addicts of
Berkeley, I must concede yet
again. If I've lamented once, I've
lamented a thousand times the lack
of crack addicts wandering in
White Plaza. It's also too bad we
don't have any child pornogra
phers in the CoHo. Or dare I wish
for...a meth lab in place of the
TresEx?
That would surely push Stan
ford over the edge in terms of legit
imacy. and likely boost us up from
the No. 5 ranking in the U.S. News
& World and Report to at least No.
2. Berkeley's streets do certainly
reek of something, but I'm not sure
it's legitimacy.
Walking back with friends from
the Big Game about six blocks to
the car. it felt like walking through
the Kappa Alpha lounge the morn
ing after a party, with pizza boxes,
beer cans and trash everywhere.
Except instead of being confined
to a couple lounge areas or hallways,
this extended for multiple blocks on
the public sidewalks and streets.

Cameron Mathews expressed our
collective disgust best by exclaiming
loudly to anyone who could hear,
"Hey Berkeley, this is what you do
with your trash," as he threw away
his Coke into one of many ignored
garbage cans.
This wasn't the real world, it
was a pig sty. To answer the age
old rhetorical question, "does a
Bear crap in the woods?" Well,
they certainly don't use a public
toilet.
Finally, the columnists' "good"
point: Gaieties. Show up on the eve
of the Big Game performance of the
student-run and -produced show
where hundreds of our students put
in countless hours to craft an adven
turous tale of the fight against good
and evil complete with hearty
laughs along the way.
Or just be somewhere in the
vicinity of Memorial Auditorium
when President Hennessy yells at
the top of his lungs, "Not on my
watch," and you'll hear an over
whelming exclamation from the
sold-out venue.
Now it is true that Berkeley
doesn't have Gaieties or a student
production to generate school spir
it, but the reason is simple: Their
students don't have enough enthu
siasm about their school to initiate
such an intense undertaking.
All their students can muster is
a projection of a bear on their clock
tower in the week previous to the
game. So while Gaieties may not
win any Tony awards, it is a testa
ment to the people and students
who do realize what an amazing
place Stanford is and will put their
life on hold for months in order to
express that feeling and pass it on
to new students.
So while Slee and Tana may not
realize what Stanford has to offer
now or what it lacks, it really is ir
relevant because there are plenty
of people who do.
