# Irrational Exuberance
## Inequality? What inequality? 
### 
I am an Anne Frank idealist. 1 not
only believe the glass is hall full,
but that it will be completely full
soon. The world is a good place.
People are generally good. Things are
getting better. 1 see the world as one of
steady inexorable improvement.
David Brooks calls it Paradise Lane.
On almost every measure — income,
science, culture, health, technology,
medicine — things are improving, at
least as far as the broad trends go.
However, there is one measure that

killjoys always
bring up hoping to
shatter my rose
colored glasses: In
equality appears to
be rising.
Although mod
ern times have
seen dramatic de
creases in inequali
ty since the dark
feudal days of the
Middle Ages, many

commentators have noticed that the
1970s saw a reversal of the trend and in
equality appears to be increasing, both
within the United States and between
countries of the world.
I always recognized this as a prob
lem, though not as bad as some make it
out to be. After all, a rising tide raises all
boats and all that. Who cares if inequal
ity increases so long as we're all better
off. However, it was a definite problem
nevertheless — a blemish on my best of
all possible worlds.
But is it a problem after all? If you
look at the world, country by country,
inequality between the developed and
developing world does seem to be in
creasing, but that's because in that case
China is only counted once. If you con
sider the overall inequality among all
the people of the world, the incredible
increase in wealth of the 30 percent of
world population that lives in China
and India — as evidenced by the 4(X)
million cell-phone owners in China
alone — means in fact that world in
equality has shrunk dramatically.
That still leaves the United States,
where measured inequality between
individuals is still increasing. However,
if you dig deeper, you find that a great
deal of the inequality is not perpetual,
but temporary. People who are poor
early in life are wealthy later. Half of
those in the bottom-income quintile
move to a higher quintile every 10
years.
Many if not most of the impover
ished are recent immigrants who are far
better off monetarily than they were
before, and whose children will be bet
ter still. In fact, the recent increase of in

equality over the past 30 years in the
United States coincides exactly with a
dramatic increase in the rate of immi
gration. A large portion of those in
poverty in the United States are recent
immigrants who have come for oppor
tunities unthinkable in their country of
origin.
If you reexamine the data of income
inequality for those born in the United
States, you find the trend of lowered in
equality has remained unchanged, and
that inequality has indeed fallen since
the 1070s. What's more, the currently
impoverished immigrants will un
doubtedly catch up, as their predeces
sors have done for hundreds of years.
However, the picture is in fact rosier
still. Why is it that even though many are
loathe to use money to evaluate welfare
in other circumstances, they are so quick
to use it when condemning inequality?
Why not lix)k at other measures?
If for instance, instead of money,
one uses life expectancy, inequality in
the United States has gone down quite
dramatically.
Alternatively, what about leisure?
Economist Dora Costa finds that work
ers at the highest-income decile work
eight more hours a week than workers
in the lowest — one full work day. In
come inequality estimates neglect this
additional leisure time.
Furthermore, economists use
money out of convenience, but why not
some other measure of welfare?
Economists tend to believe that welfare
is some convex function of money,
meaning that someone with 10 times as
much money as he had before is not
quite 10 times as happy.
For example, consider two coun
tries with two people each. In the first,
one person makes $3,(XX) a year, the
other makes $30,(XX). In the second,
one makes $30,(XX), and the other
makes $300.(XX). Though inequality in
dollar terms is the same, in terms of wel
fare, inequality is lower in the second.
This is because the difference be
tween $3,(XX) and $30,000 could be the
difference between starvation and rela
tive comfort. The difference between
$3(),(XX) and $3(X).(XX) is only a differ
ence in luxury.
Thus. even as inequality increases in
dollar terms, it is quite possible that so
long as society is getting richer, inequal
ity could well be going down.
As we recount the vast number of
things in the world to be thankful for, I
am happy to place this statistic of the
rising equality as one more.
