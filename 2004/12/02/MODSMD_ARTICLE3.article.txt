# Law school affirmative action debated
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Even before its official publica
tion in the Stanford Law Review
later this month, a study criticizing
affirmative action is creating a flurry
of controversy.
In the article, UCLA law profes
sor Richard H. Sander focuses
specifically on African American
law students, using statistical evi
dence to argue that racial prefer
ences in admissions hurt these stu
dents more than they help them.
Sander asserts that affirmative
action results in the admittance of
black students to schools where they
would normally not be accepted.
According to Sanders, these stu
dents are sometimes unable to coni-
Sander's critics extol affirmative action's virtues

pete, lowering their chances of passing the
bar and ultimately becoming lawyers.
"The article is exploring mismatch theory
— the idea that in fairly competitive envi
ronments it can be more of a disadvantage to
be at an elite school where one's credentials
are way below average," said Sander, who is
white and has supported civil rights pro
grams and other liberal causes throughout
his career.
Sander's colleagues from across the coun
try, though, are questioning both the
methodology and conclusions of his re
search.
Richard Lempert, a professor of law and
sociology at the University of Michigan, is a

proponent of affirmative action and critical
of Sander's findings. Lempert is co-author
ing a rebuttal to Sander's study that will be
published in the May issue of the Stanford
Law Review. That issue of the Law Review
will also include two other responses to
Sander's study as well as a reply by Sander.
"The quality of education for blacks and
whites both in its own terms and as prepara
tion for the world beyond the ivy tower has
improved thanks to affirmative action,"
Lempert said in an e-mail to The Daily. "Ul
timately in an unequal society, so-called neu
tral criteria reproduce the society's inequali
ties. Affirmative action is a small step aimed
at countering this. It is only a small step - if it

were a big step we would see far less inequal
ity today than we do."
The Law Review and student groups also
expect to hold a forum with Sander and oth
ers with opposing viewpoints at the Law
School this spring.
Prof. Mark G Kelman, vice dean of the
Law School, said articles published in the
Law Review do not represent the views of ei
ther the Law School or the Law Review.
"We remain completely committed as an
institution to affirmative action with respect
to hiring and admissions," Kelman said. "For
the last 30 years it's been an active concern to
ensure the diversity of our student body. We
always think we could do better in ensuring

more thorough rep
resentation of people
from a variety of his
torically segregated
groups, but we cer
tainly feel proud to
have attracted stu
dents who have
made significant con
tributions to the legal
community and the
more general com
munity."
In his study.
Sander presents data
showing that the me
dian black student
starting law school in
1991 received first
year grades compa
rable to a white stu
dent at the seventh or
eighth percentile.
Additionally, he
shows that only 45
percent of black law
students in the na
tional sample com
pleted law school
and passed the baron
their first attempt.
Sander attributes
these discouraging
statistics to the acad
emic disadvantage
that black students
find themselves in as
a result of racial pref
erences. His study
says that in the ab
sence of preferential
admissions, the num
ber of black law stu

dents passing the bar would increase from 45
to 74 percent. It claims that race-blind poli
cies would lead students to attend less rigor
ous schools, increasing their chances of suc
cess and thereby increasing the number of
black lawyers.
Sander noted, though, that the goal of his
article was not to prescribe solutions such as
eliminating affirmative action, but to simply
stimulate discussion of the issue.
"There's kind of been a code of silence
about what has been going on. and this study
is trying to provide hard evidence and analy
sis of the mismatch effect," he said. "I don't
see it as just a black and white choice as abol
ishing affirmative action, but a question of
how can we fix the system to keep the bene
fits but reduce the costs."
In contrast to Sander's results, Lempert
said abolishing affirmative action policies
would result in the number of black lawyers
decreasing by 25 to 35 percent.
One sharp critique of Sander's study that
Lempert gives is that some African Ameri
can students might be discouraged from ap
plying to law school if affirmative action
were abolished, or that they may not be fa
miliar with the lower tier law schools to
which they would be accepted without affir
mative action.
"For example, it assumes that a black
graduate of Stanford who wanted to go to
Stanford Law School but has also applied to
Davis would apply to and attend Cooley Law
School in Michigan if that were the only
school that would admit him," Lempert said.
"Most Stanford students, white or black,
probably don't even know there is a law
school called 'Cooley."'
Sander countered that in the absence of
affirmative action, more black law students
svould have success at lower tier law schools,
encouraging more prospective students to
apply.
Regardless ol student reactions to the
elimination of racial preferences. Kelman is
concerned that prospective minority appli
cants to the Law School will misinterpret the
study as being representative of Stanford's
position on affirmative action.
"I worry to some degree that our outreach
efforts will be hurt by what strikes me as a
misperception that's hard to correct for peo
ple outside the academic world," he said.
"Even though there's no identification be
tween our practices and what pieces are pub
lished in our Law Review, not all students
thinking about applying will realize that."
Another critique of Sander's study is that

it does not take into account the non-acade
mic effects of attending a good law school,
such as networking.
Sander's data shows that black students at
most law schools face a 50 percent chance of
falling to the very bottom of their class,
though at top tier law schools, low grades had
less effect on black students' success rates
with respect to graduating, passing the bar
and finding a job.
However, Sander said this does not prove
that such results outweigh the costs of affir
mative action.
"In the job market, we have really good
data of what happens to people two or three
years out of law school, and it's quite clear
that grades are more important than prestige
for employers in the first few years." he said.
"Contacts and connections play a role but
I don't think they're determinative."
Kelman said he thinks affirmative action at
Stanford has increased the representation of
African Americans in the legal profession
and in powerful positions in the legal com
munity.
Lempert agreed, adding that Sander's re
search ignores the fact that "the history of af
firmative action is by and large a success
story.
"We have many thousands, by now prob
ably tens of thousands, of successful black
and Hispanic attorneys, who would not have
graduated from the schools they did without
affirmative action."
Sander, however, argued that affirmative ac
tion is no longer as necessary to ensure rep
resentation of African Americans in the
legal profession. He said that this is evident
through the fact that the credentials gap be
tween blacks and whites has narrowed dra
matically in the past few decades. The num
ber of blacks with above average LSAT
scores and undergraduate CiPAs has roughly
quadrupled in the past 25 years, according to
Sander.
"Racial preferences are no longer a life
line to a legal education," he said.
Sander said he plans to conduct similar stud
ies to examine the effect of racial preferences
on Latino and Asian law students. Sander
stressed, however, that his research is not in
tended to be partisan or political in nature.
"I've been very active in civil rights in
southern California and generally I'm left
leaning on those issues." he said. "1 don't see
this as something proving that opponents of
affirmative action were right all along -1 see
this as a complicated issue that ought to be
addressed."

ably tens of thousands, of successful black
and Hispanic attorneys, who would not have
graduated from the schools they did without
affirmative action."
Sander, however, argued that affirmative ac
tion is no longer as necessary to ensure rep
resentation of African Americans in the
legal profession. He said that this is evident
through the fact that the credentials gap be
tween blacks and whites has narrowed dra
matically in the past few decades. The num
ber of blacks with above average LSAT
scores and undergraduate CiPAs has roughly
quadrupled in the past 25 years, according to
Sander.
"Racial preferences are no longer a life
line to a legal education," he said.
Sander said he plans to conduct similar stud

on Latino and Asian law students. Sander
stressed, however, that his research is not in
tended to be partisan or political in nature.
"I've been very active in civil rights in
southern California and generally I'm left

affirmative action were right all along -1 see

Even before its official publica
tion in the Stanford Law Review
later this month, a study criticizing
affirmative action is creating a flurry
of controversy.
In the article, UCLA law profes
sor Richard H. Sander focuses
specifically on African American
law students, using statistical evi
dence to argue that racial prefer
ences in admissions hurt these stu
dents more than they help them.
Sander asserts that affirmative
action results in the admittance of
black students to schools where they
would normally not be accepted.
According to Sanders, these stu
dents are sometimes unable to coni-
Sander's critics extol affirmative action's virtues

pete, lowering their chances of passing the
bar and ultimately becoming lawyers.
"The article is exploring mismatch theory
— the idea that in fairly competitive envi
ronments it can be more of a disadvantage to
be at an elite school where one's credentials
are way below average," said Sander, who is
white and has supported civil rights pro
grams and other liberal causes throughout
his career.
Sander's colleagues from across the coun
try, though, are questioning both the
methodology and conclusions of his re
search.
Richard Lempert, a professor of law and
sociology at the University of Michigan, is a

proponent of affirmative action and critical
of Sander's findings. Lempert is co-author
ing a rebuttal to Sander's study that will be
published in the May issue of the Stanford
Law Review. That issue of the Law Review
will also include two other responses to
Sander's study as well as a reply by Sander.
"The quality of education for blacks and
whites both in its own terms and as prepara
tion for the world beyond the ivy tower has
improved thanks to affirmative action,"
Lempert said in an e-mail to The Daily. "Ul
timately in an unequal society, so-called neu
tral criteria reproduce the society's inequali
ties. Affirmative action is a small step aimed
at countering this. It is only a small step - if it

were a big step we would see far less inequal
ity today than we do."
The Law Review and student groups also
expect to hold a forum with Sander and oth
ers with opposing viewpoints at the Law
School this spring.
Prof. Mark G Kelman, vice dean of the
Law School, said articles published in the
Law Review do not represent the views of ei
ther the Law School or the Law Review.
"We remain completely committed as an
institution to affirmative action with respect
to hiring and admissions," Kelman said. "For
the last 30 years it's been an active concern to
ensure the diversity of our student body. We
always think we could do better in ensuring

more thorough rep
resentation of people
from a variety of his
torically segregated
groups, but we cer
tainly feel proud to
have attracted stu
dents who have
made significant con
tributions to the legal
community and the
more general com
munity."
In his study.
Sander presents data
showing that the me
dian black student
starting law school in
1991 received first
year grades compa
rable to a white stu
dent at the seventh or
eighth percentile.
Additionally, he
shows that only 45
percent of black law
students in the na
tional sample com
pleted law school
and passed the baron
their first attempt.
Sander attributes
these discouraging
statistics to the acad
emic disadvantage
that black students
find themselves in as
a result of racial pref
erences. His study
says that in the ab
sence of preferential
admissions, the num
ber of black law stu

dents passing the bar would increase from 45
to 74 percent. It claims that race-blind poli
cies would lead students to attend less rigor
ous schools, increasing their chances of suc
cess and thereby increasing the number of
black lawyers.
Sander noted, though, that the goal of his
article was not to prescribe solutions such as
eliminating affirmative action, but to simply
stimulate discussion of the issue.
"There's kind of been a code of silence
about what has been going on. and this study
is trying to provide hard evidence and analy
sis of the mismatch effect," he said. "I don't
see it as just a black and white choice as abol
ishing affirmative action, but a question of
how can we fix the system to keep the bene
fits but reduce the costs."
In contrast to Sander's results, Lempert
said abolishing affirmative action policies
would result in the number of black lawyers
decreasing by 25 to 35 percent.
One sharp critique of Sander's study that
Lempert gives is that some African Ameri
can students might be discouraged from ap
plying to law school if affirmative action
were abolished, or that they may not be fa
miliar with the lower tier law schools to
which they would be accepted without affir
mative action.
"For example, it assumes that a black
graduate of Stanford who wanted to go to
Stanford Law School but has also applied to
Davis would apply to and attend Cooley Law
School in Michigan if that were the only
school that would admit him," Lempert said.
"Most Stanford students, white or black,
probably don't even know there is a law
school called 'Cooley."'
Sander countered that in the absence of
affirmative action, more black law students
svould have success at lower tier law schools,
encouraging more prospective students to
apply.
Regardless ol student reactions to the
elimination of racial preferences. Kelman is
concerned that prospective minority appli
cants to the Law School will misinterpret the
study as being representative of Stanford's
position on affirmative action.
"I worry to some degree that our outreach
efforts will be hurt by what strikes me as a
misperception that's hard to correct for peo
ple outside the academic world," he said.
"Even though there's no identification be
tween our practices and what pieces are pub
lished in our Law Review, not all students
thinking about applying will realize that."
Another critique of Sander's study is that

it does not take into account the non-acade
mic effects of attending a good law school,
such as networking.
Sander's data shows that black students at
most law schools face a 50 percent chance of
falling to the very bottom of their class,
though at top tier law schools, low grades had
less effect on black students' success rates
with respect to graduating, passing the bar
and finding a job.
However, Sander said this does not prove
that such results outweigh the costs of affir
mative action.
"In the job market, we have really good
data of what happens to people two or three
years out of law school, and it's quite clear
that grades are more important than prestige
for employers in the first few years." he said.
"Contacts and connections play a role but
I don't think they're determinative."
Kelman said he thinks affirmative action at
Stanford has increased the representation of
African Americans in the legal profession
and in powerful positions in the legal com
munity.
Lempert agreed, adding that Sander's re
search ignores the fact that "the history of af
firmative action is by and large a success
story.
"We have many thousands, by now prob
ably tens of thousands, of successful black
and Hispanic attorneys, who would not have
graduated from the schools they did without
affirmative action."

such as networking.
Sander's data shows that black students at
most law schools face a 50 percent chance of
falling to the very bottom of their class,
though at top tier law schools, low grades had
less effect on black students' success rates
with respect to graduating, passing the bar
and finding a job.
However, Sander said this does not prove
that such results outweigh the costs of affir
mative action.
"In the job market, we have really good
data of what happens to people two or three
years out of law school, and it's quite clear
that grades are more important than prestige
for employers in the first few years." he said.
"Contacts and connections play a role but
I don't think they're determinative."
Kelman said he thinks affirmative action at
Stanford has increased the representation of
African Americans in the legal profession
and in powerful positions in the legal com
munity.
Lempert agreed, adding that Sander's re
search ignores the fact that "the history of af
firmative action is by and large a success
story.
"We have many thousands, by now prob
ably tens of thousands, of successful black
and Hispanic attorneys, who would not have
graduated from the schools they did without
affirmative action."
Sander, however, argued that affirmative ac
tion is no longer as necessary to ensure rep
resentation of African Americans in the
legal profession. He said that this is evident
through the fact that the credentials gap be
tween blacks and whites has narrowed dra
matically in the past few decades. The num
ber of blacks with above average LSAT
scores and undergraduate CiPAs has roughly
quadrupled in the past 25 years, according to
Sander.
"Racial preferences are no longer a life
line to a legal education," he said.
Sander said he plans to conduct similar stud
ies to examine the effect of racial preferences
on Latino and Asian law students. Sander
stressed, however, that his research is not in
tended to be partisan or political in nature.
"I've been very active in civil rights in
southern California and generally I'm left
leaning on those issues." he said. "1 don't see
this as something proving that opponents of
affirmative action were right all along -1 see
this as a complicated issue that ought to be
addressed."
