Lack of Competitive Cheer
funding points to larger problem
The Athletic Department s re
fusal to fund Competitive Cheer
("Cheer team deserves funding,"
Nov. 23) is just a symptom of the
Department s entirely unsatisfacto
ry approach to non-varsity sports.
While the new fitness complex
being built over the old Encima
Gym is a rare, if long overdue, ex
ception, the Athletic Department
consistently fails to serve the aver
age student (and, arguably, faculty
and staff as well).
Club teams receive virtually no
help from the Athletic Department.
They are not provided enough ac
cess to facilities and other resources,
and the financial burden is forced
almost entirely onto the student
body through nearly prohibitively

high fees for members of some
teams, and the single largest special
fee on the ASSU ballot each year.
The department still won't allow
clubs in sports for which varsity
teams exist, denying countless Stan
ford students a chance for any sort
of intercollegiate competition un
less they are among the best players
in the country.
The department also presides
over one of the worst intramural
programs in the nation. Sure, too
many dorms don't take their IM
commitments seriously enough. But
ask any alumnus from 25 or more
years ago about what I Ms were like
ihen and how they were run.and it's
clear that a lack of leadership at the
top has allowed the program to
reach its current state.
And finally, the department's
gross lack of support for the stu

dents and groups that support its
NCAA athletes from the stands is
inexcusable. The Band, Competi
tive Cheer, Axe Command others
receive embarrassingly little sup
port from the Department. Again,
almost all of the funding has to
come from the students themselves
or from ASSU fees paid by all. And
the department still charges stu
dents exorbitantly high ticket prices
for most sports compared to other
schools.
All those Director's Cups in Ar
rillaga may say a lot about the suc
cess of our varsity sports teams.
That just makes it all the more re
grettable that the Athletic Depart
ment is such a failure for the Uni
versity as a whole.
