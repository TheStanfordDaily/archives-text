# Smoke and Mirrors Aside
## An incentive to give back 
### 
From 2002 to 2003, the num
ber of Americans living in
poverty had increased by 1.3
million to an total of 35.9 mil
lion. That's a lot of people — about
12.5 percent of the population. And as
always seems to be the case, the rich
are getting richer and the poor are
getting poorer.
But what makes this more utterly
devastating is just how rich the rich
are getting. Some people aren't just
getting a big slice of the pie; they're
getting several servings.
On Sept. 17, Forbes released a re
port stating that the number of bil
lionaires in America had risen to an
all-time high of 313, representing a 19
percent increase since 2003. And the
400 richest Americans were worth a
whopping net total of $1 trillion-plus.
To put that in perspective, China, 1.2

billion people
strong, had a 2003
GDP of $1.41 tril
lion.
And to what
good use is all that
money going? My
guess is that it's
just sitting
around, collecting
interest as un
earned income

does.
Economists ask how can we in
centivize the poor to be productive
beings in society and rid us of the
guilt associated with knowing we
could do more.
Although the resulting field of
scholarship is undeniably important,
one must wonder why economists
haven't asked another central ques
tion: How can we make rich people
quit being such farts?
Or, how can we incentivize self-in
terested rich people to invest more
money in public goods that deliver re
turns to society, maximize profit —
er, I mean utility — and not only re
plenish but deepen America's human
capital wells?
When 400 people are collectively
worth more than a trillion dollars, they
are no longer just men but unearthed
compendiums of financial and human
capital begging to be exploited.
Instead of exclusively studying the
poor as pawns to be meddled with,
economists should pursue a new field
of research that examines the psychol
ogy of the rich and devises ways to in
duce them to spread the wealth a little.
Surely methods can be developed
to compel the wealthy to invest in low
income neighborhoods and pour their
talents and skills into educating and
uplifting underprivileged Americans.
If troubled sections of town, for ex
ample, received contributions where
returns on property taxes were other
wise lacking, then perhaps many low
income areas would be more on par
with suburbia.
These investments to infrastruc
ture and capital can improve wealth
for society as a whole while giving a
confidence boost to residents other
wise doomed to working minimum
wage jobs and waking up to the sight
of run-down buildings.
Imagine if economists developed
incentives to get business profession
als to teach free workshops open to all
residents about how to create small
businesses. From using accounting
sheets to understanding company
shipping routes, these professionals
could teach the vital skills necessary to
get businesses up and running.
Unleashing the creative potential
of professionals and liquefying
human capital across income strata
would turn promise into progress and
help rejuvenate communities. Resi
dents could actually believe and hope,
and would actually have role models
for once.
Or imagine if several professionals
adopted a community in their spare
time and became fully accountable
for its outcome. Nearby university
students could even help as interns,
becoming attractive candidates for
firms in the business world. It could be
a sort of corporate Teach for Ameri
ca, where interns and professionals
could bring to the professional world
the intimate knowledge they'd gained
from witnessing hardship up close and
confronting challenges unexplored in
textbooks.
The point is that economists
should cease to look so seriously
through the high-powered lens of self
interest that says the wealthy cannot
be bothered, the rich are not bad
people, and having amassed so much
wealth, they should be viewed more
as a source of capital desperately in
need of utilization by the poor.
As President Franklin D. Roo
sevelt once said. "We have always
known that heedless self-interest was
bad morals; we now know it is bad
economics."

billion people
strong, had a 2003
GDP of $1.41 tril
lion.
And to what
good use is all that
money going? My
guess is that it's
just sitting
around, collecting
interest as un
earned income

does.
Economists ask how can we in
centivize the poor to be productive
beings in society and rid us of the
guilt associated with knowing we
could do more.
Although the resulting field of
scholarship is undeniably important,
one must wonder why economists
haven't asked another central ques
tion: How can we make rich people
quit being such farts?
Or, how can we incentivize self-in
terested rich people to invest more
money in public goods that deliver re
turns to society, maximize profit —
er, I mean utility — and not only re
plenish but deepen America's human
capital wells?
When 400 people are collectively
worth more than a trillion dollars, they
are no longer just men but unearthed
compendiums of financial and human
capital begging to be exploited.
Instead of exclusively studying the
poor as pawns to be meddled with,
economists should pursue a new field
of research that examines the psychol
ogy of the rich and devises ways to in
duce them to spread the wealth a little.
Surely methods can be developed
to compel the wealthy to invest in low
income neighborhoods and pour their
talents and skills into educating and
uplifting underprivileged Americans.
If troubled sections of town, for ex
ample, received contributions where
returns on property taxes were other
wise lacking, then perhaps many low
income areas would be more on par
with suburbia.
These investments to infrastruc
ture and capital can improve wealth
for society as a whole while giving a
confidence boost to residents other
wise doomed to working minimum
wage jobs and waking up to the sight
of run-down buildings.
Imagine if economists developed
incentives to get business profession
als to teach free workshops open to all
residents about how to create small
businesses. From using accounting
sheets to understanding company
shipping routes, these professionals
could teach the vital skills necessary to
get businesses up and running.
Unleashing the creative potential
of professionals and liquefying
human capital across income strata
would turn promise into progress and
help rejuvenate communities. Resi
dents could actually believe and hope,
and would actually have role models
for once.
Or imagine if several professionals
adopted a community in their spare
time and became fully accountable
for its outcome. Nearby university
students could even help as interns,
becoming attractive candidates for
firms in the business world. It could be
a sort of corporate Teach for Ameri
ca, where interns and professionals
could bring to the professional world
the intimate knowledge they'd gained
from witnessing hardship up close and
confronting challenges unexplored in
textbooks.
The point is that economists
should cease to look so seriously
through the high-powered lens of self
interest that says the wealthy cannot
be bothered, the rich are not bad
people, and having amassed so much
wealth, they should be viewed more
as a source of capital desperately in
need of utilization by the poor.
As President Franklin D. Roo
sevelt once said. "We have always
known that heedless self-interest was
bad morals; we now know it is bad
economics."
