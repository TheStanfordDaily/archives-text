## Thank you, Leland and Jane Stanford 
### JOHN JETT 
I spent the Thanksgiving holiday
visiting family in rural California. I
couldn't find the place on a map for
you, but I'm pretty much certain that
it's about as far from Stanford as you
can travel and still be in the Golden
State. Still, even though 1 traveled
hundreds of miles, I couldn't quite
leave Stanford behind.
You see, while 1 tried my best just to
forget class and gorge myself on turkey
and pie, my cousin, a senior in high
school, spent the break toiling away on
her Stanford application. She wants
desperately to come to the Farm next
year.
Unfortunately for me, as a current
Stanford student, I am expected to
know the magical solutions to ques
tions like, "What has been your most
important extracurricular activity
while in high school?" When I plead ig
norance, saying that the answer de
pends on her, she is frustrated — even
angry.
To hear my cousin tell it, 1 might as
well be withholding information vital
to national security. If she had her way,
I think I would find myself with a one
way ticket to Camp X-Ray to await fur
ther questioning.
She is stressed. We all can remem
ber the feeling. She's up against stiff
competition, and she knows it.
During my visit, I met a few of my

cousin's friends, also Stanford appli
cants. She introduced me to an out
standing water polo player with a gift
for computer programming. And I got
to know a budding actress who spends
her vacations building homes for the
underprivileged in developing nations.
There are thousands of other equal
ly talented students around the coun
try polishing their essays while you
read this column. The vast majority
will never be students at the Farm. Ad
mission to Stanford is simply that diffi
cult — and not a little bit arbitrary.
No SAT score, no accomplishment,
no magical "X-Factor" guarantees ad
mission. At least anecdotally, every
reader knows of some superior candi
date who failed to win admission to
Stanford. And while you might tell
yourself that you, just you. are some
how special, chances are that your ap
plication was just one person's whim
away from being in the rejection pile.
Personally, I think that I won ad
mission through: A) a clerical error in
my favor: B) the good graces of a Joan
Jett fan on the admit committee; C) a
happy coincidence involving all my ap
plication's reviewers having a good
hair day and a traffic-free drive to work
that morning.
Regardless of how 1 snuck past
Stanford's gatekeepers, I feel lucky to
be here. I spent my freshman and
sophomore years at an East Coast
school before transferring to the Farm.

With that frame of reference to guide
me, I can assure readers that Stanford
has a good thing going.
Still. I often run into classmates who
have an axe to grind with Stanford.
Housing this, gym equipment that.
Being human, I have a few little gripes,
too. Nothing's perfect on this earth. All I
ask is that people keep perspective while
criticizing Stanford. No matter how bad
something here is, it could be worse,
much worse. And don't let a little bad
obscure 8,000-plus acres of good.
Back in the day, when you opened
that long-awaited envelope and found
out that Stanford loved you, you prob
ably reciprocated. In the meantime,
academic stress, hangovers, sleepless
nights and mounting student loan debt
might have sapped your zeal and left
you a little jaded. But even if it's been a
few years since you received your ad
mission letter, try to think back to that
moment you heard the good news. Re
member how happy you were?
Be that happy today, tomorrow and
the next day. Be that happy every day
you are on the Farm. Now in the wake
of Thanksgiving, when presumably
you practiced the art of giving thanks,
be thankful you are at Stanford and for
all the wonderful opportunities you
have here.
