# Brown and Out
## Punish employers, not immigrants 
### 
Although I know it's so passe
to write about Iraq, 1 decid
ed to do it this week any
way. I was reading newspa
per this week during Thanksgiving
break and I came across an article that
really disturbed me: The growing
trend of children left quasi-orphaned
because one or both of their parents
have been deported.
In the best cases, the parents find a
way to stay in the country that has glad
ly been accepting their labor for what
can sometimes be decades. In the worst
cases, the children affected lose their
parents, become depressed and at
tempt suicide.
I gave thanks during the break that
both of my parents are in the United
States and that this would never hap
pen to me. But it made me angry.
Why is it fair to continue to accept
and encourage people to come to this
country without the proper paperwork
(rarely is the employer of undocument
ed workers penalized as severely as the
workers he or she knowingly hired) and
then boot them out as soon as the op
portunity presents itself?
I know this is a heated debate and
will certainly not be resolved in this col
umn. but that brought me to think
about another place where non-citizens
were willing to sacrifice so much —
their lives — in order to work their way
into this society: the military.
According to some estimates, there
are 60,000 immigrants in the U.S. mili
tary, 2 percent of the total personnel on
active duty. Half of them are non-citi
zens. The largest of this group is from,
you guessed it, Mexico.
Those darn Mexicans. They just

keep coming even though no one real
ly wants them — except for President
George W. Bush.
The president signed an order in
July allowing all active-duty immi
grants. in all branches of the military,
with green cards serving since Sept. 11,
2001, to apply for an expedited U.S. cit
izenship. These

types of requests,
as you may imag
ine, have soared
since July.
There are over
37.000 of these
"green-card sol
diers," and the
number is growing,
thanks to Bush's
order. According
to The Los Ange-

les Times, at least half of the first 10 Cal
ifornians killed in Iraq were not citi
zens. Fancy that.
So there are people defending
American freedom... who aren't even
American?
Talk about patriotism. I guess the
craziest part for me is that it's not
the first time this has happened to
Mexican-American soldiers. During
World War 11. Mexicans and Mexi
can-Americans were the most deco
rated ethnic group in the United
States. And who could forget that, in
Vietnam, it was Latinos and blacks
that disproportionately lost their
lives on the front lines?
It frustrates me on a personal level
to know that human beings are only
wanted if they are useful in some way
— be it giving their bodies for manual
labor, their health for low-wage work.

or their lives for the elite's war.
I know that if I had come to this
country out of necessity, lived here
for years and made a life here, and
then one day someone told me that I
had to go hack to a place that was no
longer my home, but thanks for all
the hard work, I would be angry, sad
and heartbroken.
The issue at hand, for me at least,
isn't really a legal one. If the United
States really wanted to stop illegal im
migration, it would punish the people
who employ undocumented workers.
People won't come if they can't find
work.
There are people who come here to
work in deplorable conditions — the
Associated Press conducted a study
earlier this year that found that Latino
immigrants and Mexican immigrants in
particular had higher on-the-job death
rates than anyone else. People at Stan
ford treat their dogs better than some
people treat these immigrants. Dogs
aren't human beings.
The issue is — yes I'm bringing it up
again — racism. Plain and simple.
You can't separate human beings
from the work their bodies do. You
can't separate human beings from the
jobs they do. You can't ask for some
one to do work and not want them to
exist at the same lime. The whole thing
is just a bunch of nonsense.
If you want the work, then you have
to tolerate the person. If you don't want
the work, well then, no one should have
a problem.
