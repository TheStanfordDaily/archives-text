## Democratic hopes for 2005 
### 
-2005 has great potential. The
opportunities for our country
and its leaders to show com
passion and global leader
ship abound.
I hope that the Western world
stops the genocide in Sudan. Yes, it
is a genocide, and no, we have not
done anything about it. Visits by
Former Secretary of State Colin
Powell and U.N. President Kofi
Annan are nice, but they have not
stopped the killing. No matter how
many front-page articles or head
line news stories there are, the
killing continues to this day.
In 1994, the world watched as the
Hutu systematically extinguished
800,000 Tutsi in Rwanda, and the
world said "never again."
In 1984 the famine in Ethiopia
killed one million people as the
world watched. The song "Do They
Know It's Christmas" was recorded
that year to draw attention to the
humanitarian crisis.
Just last week while shopping, I
heard the same song in a mall,
remixed and re-released to draw at
tention to the genocide in Sudan.
Never again?
I hope fora lasting resolution to
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For
the first time in almost the entire
history of the conflict, the Palestini
ans will have new leadership. This is
an opportunity that the two sides
must seize.
The Palestinian people have a
chance to break the cycle of vio
lence and elect leadership that has
the ability to both crack down on
renegade extremists and negotiate
in good faith with Israel.
And the "big four," Russia, the
European Union, the United Na
tions and the United States, must
pressure the sides to get the job
done. In 2000, at Camp David, the
sides were tantalizingly close to a
permanent resolution. The circum
stances surrounding next year offer
the possibility that a comprehensive
agreement can be reached.
I hope that President George W.

Bush will roll out of bed and decide
to be a uniter. I hope that he will
abandon the social wedge issues
that have been tearing society
apart. What is his incentive to fur-

ther the Federal
Marriage
Amendment?
Who wins when
potential lines of
stem cells die in
embryo banks?
I hope that the
president will
phone Rep.
Nancy Pelosi and
Sen. Harry Reid,

the Democratic
leaders on Capitol Hill, and ask how
the two parties can better work to
gether. The excessive partisanship
that has dogged our political system
intensely for the last 10 years has
turned people off to what once was
the world's model political process.
Who really wonders why people
in this country don't vote?
I hope that the next secretary of
Health and Human Services calls a
press conference on his or her first
day on the job to declare that the
healthcare system in the world's
wealthiest nation is in a state of cri
sis. It is.
Why do about 45 million people
not have any health care? Why is
ours the only county in the world
that treats people's health as a busi
ness and not a societal obligation?
Perhaps some of these hopes will
come true; perhaps none of them.
But if our goals are not set high, if
we do not seek real change in this
nation and this world, if we are con
tent to stay the course, there is no
doubt in my mind that our children
will be born into a world far bleaker
than that which we have enjoyed.
I, for one, do not want this to
come to pass.
