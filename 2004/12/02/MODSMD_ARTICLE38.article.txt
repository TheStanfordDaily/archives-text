# Sketch: Tales of Graduate Life
## 'Tis the season to be jolly 
### 
As the quarter stumbles
gently to a close — or
rushes headlong to a
spectacular climax, de
pending on your point of view — I
find it's time to turn one's mind to
things other than school.
More precisely, Christmas is
here.
There's nothing quite like Yule
tide to bring out the best in people.
Personally, nothing gives me greater
delight than strolling through the
streets of Palo Alto as winter en
croaches on our sunny climes.
The delicate twinkle of lights en
twining the branches of University
Avenue's trees sets off the concrete
and stucco just so.
And shopping is always more
pleasant when one's path through
the store is impeded by hoards of
children clawing at their parents for
the latest "must-have" toys.
A particular joy for me is season
al advertising. I've always found
that it warms the soul to see the
happy, happy people frolicking on
my television set, selflessly showing
me the best way to dispose of my in
come.
I reserve a special place in my
heart for those pretty young things
who dedicate themselves to encour
aging me to improve my wardrobe,
henceforth know as "Gap people."
They are, of course, named for
their übiquitous presence in Gap
commercials. They smile as they
whirl and twirl to hip (but non
threatening) music; their garments
and their joy inextricably linked in
the minds of the consumer.
Each Gap person is a beaming
specimen of good health and good
cheer. Each a perfectly formed
being on the cusp between youth
and true adulthood. Each a re
minder that we are perhaps not the
aspirational pinnacle we might seek
to be.
I have a small confession to
make. I've always wanted to be a
Gap person. Life would be a great
deal less taxing if one's days consist
ed of playful antics with each smile
returned by another one of the
beautiful people.
Plus, if you are going to belong to
a clique, it's surely best to be in one
where everybody has perfect skin.
Although I spent my last winter
break here at Stanford — comfort
ed each night by high-spirited young
folk trying to sell me clothes — this

year I have decided to do without
the reassurance of American TV
commercials, and instead try and
survive Christmas in London.
At first I was going to write
"home" instead of "London," but
these days I am a little uncertain of
what and where home is.
It seems that life as a grad student
not only produces uncertainties
about one's value as a cog in the ma-

chinery or
mankind — it
also leads one to
question where
one resides.
I've always had
trouble separating
the places I've
lived from the
places that I've
called home. Each
time you start

somewnere rresn,
there are contradictory temptations
to hold back and to dive in.
This is not such a pressing prob
lem during undergraduate life,
where time at university seems like a
four-year-long summer camp — al
beit one with drugs, sex, alcohol and
differential equations.
Grad school, however, is a rather
different prospect. It's difficult to
continue to claim a place 6,000 miles
away as home when you visit it once
a year on holiday and bring back
souvenirs on your return (you just
can't get cricket balls in America).
Not only that, but going "home"
is a constant reminder of who you
are and what you're doing while
your friends from high school have
been busy with their real jobs and
real lives.
At least here 1 can reassure my
self with the thought that even if
continued education is a poor deci
sion, all my acquaintances have
made the same one. There's always
comfort in knowing your peers are
just as foolish as you are.
It's oft-quoted that "home is
where you hang your hat," though
with hats in two continents it's diffi
cult to use that as a distinguishing
criterion, except by resigning one
self to having two homes to miss
over the winter break.
Still, at least there's Christmas to
look forward to.

Full of good will and Yuletide cheer?
