## More than one way to read the Qu'ran 
### AHMED SULTAN 
Zachary Haldeman'sop-ed 'Rad
ical Islamists should be considered
Muslims t(x>" (Nov. 24) manifests a
significant misunderstanding of the
nature of religion and civilization.
I start by saying that I completely
agree with him that "radical Is
lamists" are Muslims. Asserting that
they should not be considered Mus
lims is wrong and, surprisingly, for
this same reason, Haldeman's piece
is wrong.
To understand Islam, one should
pay attention to the nature of the
Qu'ran. The Qu'ran cannot be ap
proached with an either-or reduc
tionist mentality. If this methodolo
gy is valid, then every possible idea
can be justified and rationalized
using the Qu'ran or any other reli
gious text, from violence to absolute
pacifism.
The same Qu'ran that reads,
"Whoever then acts aggressively
against you. inflict injury on him ac
cording to the injury he has inflicted
on you" (2:1 ), also reads, "Good
ness and evil are not the same. So
repel evil with goodness, then the
one who had enmity between you
becomes a trusted and dear friend"
(41:34). This may seem like a con
tradiction if the either-or approach
is utilized. However, a "both-and"
dialectic approach would attempt to
transcend, reconcile and find pro
found truth in both verses.
The Qu'ran is basically delineat
ing a number of different strategies,
the validity of which are contingent
on the situational and contextual
factors. A Muslim, according to the
Islamic teachings, should do her or
his best to understand the context,
investigate the issue diligently and

exhaustively, and then formulate a
judgment that she or he thinks is the
best given the circumstances on the
ground.
While doing this exercise, Mus
lims differ on what weight should be
given to the different guiding princi
ples relevant to a particular context.
This leads to an inherent diversity
within the Islamic faith. This diversi
ty is also related to the fact that the
Qu ran, in addition to its self-evi
dent definitive layer of meaning, has
several speculative layers that are
open to a process of interpretation
to be undertaken in conformity to
the definitives and the rules of the
Arabic language.
It must be mentioned that a Mus
lim may become selective and simply
ignore some indispensable principles
while working out what she or he
should do in a given situation. Apart
from self-indulgence, the sociopoliti
cal context plays an important role in
inducing this selectivity. A Muslim
living where she or he finds Islam
constantly reviled and the Qu'ran
persistently misquoted may respond
apologetically by declaring Islam as
an "obviously" pacifist religion, ig
noring anything in the Qu'ran and the
Prophetic traditions testifying to the
contrary. A Muslim witnessing his
wife being raped and his children
slaughtered will very likely discard
the well-established Islamic rules of
engagement.
The conditions are not a valid
justification, but Muslims are hu
mans after all, and humans — all
humans — succumb to their over
whelming context. (Interestingly,
the context was correctly and con
vincingly evoked in the U.S. media
to understand the Abu Gharib
prison abuses. When it comes to

why some Muslims go to extremes,
there is no context, only a culture of
evil and fanaticism.)
All civilizations comprise a spec
trum of interpretations and commu
nities of meaning. Haldeman says,
"But moderate Muslims conve
niently evade the word of God in
order to live coherently in Western
civilization, which is an affront to
the Qu'ran in every way."
What Qu'ran or Islam is he talk
ing about? And. more importantly,
what Western civilization is he talk
ing about? Just a quick glance at
Western philosophy reveals the
huge diversity within Western
thought and practice. Of course, one
can construct a "West" and then in
vent an image of the Muslim other
as the exact antithesis of "the West."
But these constructed imageries tell
us much more about their inventor
than about any objective reality.
Haldeman concludes by saying,
"The problem is Islam and religion
itself." It is undeniable that religion
has been used to justify many hor
rors. But did the Nazis and the Stal
inists kill millions upon millions of
innocent people in the name of reli
gion? For the Nazis, it seems that
science has said it once and for all
that there are übermenschen whose
rights are unquestionable and un
termenschen who are innately back
ward and, thus, deserve nothing but
eradication. For the Stalinists, di
alectical materialism was the faith.
Humans have repeatedly shown
that they can use anything to justify
their deeds. The assertion that reli
gion is to blame per se cannot with
stand scrutiny.

living where she or he finds Islam
constantly reviled and the Qu'ran
persistently misquoted may respond
apologetically by declaring Islam as
an "obviously" pacifist religion, ig

contrary. A Muslim witnessing his

slaughtered will very likely discard
the well-established Islamic rules of
engagement.

humans — succumb to their over

the context was correctly and con

prison abuses. When it comes to

why some Muslims go to extremes,
there is no context, only a culture of

What Qu'ran or Islam is he talk

what Western civilization is he talk

Western philosophy reveals the

"The problem is Islam and religion
itself." It is undeniable that religion
has been used to justify many hor

innocent people in the name of reli
gion? For the Nazis, it seems that
science has said it once and for all
that there are übermenschen whose
rights are unquestionable and un
termenschen who are innately back

eradication. For the Stalinists, di
alectical materialism was the faith.
Humans have repeatedly shown
that they can use anything to justify
their deeds. The assertion that reli

Zachary Haldeman'sop-ed 'Rad
ical Islamists should be considered
Muslims t(x>" (Nov. 24) manifests a
significant misunderstanding of the
nature of religion and civilization.
I start by saying that I completely
agree with him that "radical Is
lamists" are Muslims. Asserting that
they should not be considered Mus
lims is wrong and, surprisingly, for
this same reason, Haldeman's piece
is wrong.
To understand Islam, one should
pay attention to the nature of the
Qu'ran. The Qu'ran cannot be ap
proached with an either-or reduc
tionist mentality. If this methodolo
gy is valid, then every possible idea
can be justified and rationalized
using the Qu'ran or any other reli
gious text, from violence to absolute
pacifism.
The same Qu'ran that reads,
"Whoever then acts aggressively
against you. inflict injury on him ac
cording to the injury he has inflicted
on you" (2:1 ), also reads, "Good
ness and evil are not the same. So
repel evil with goodness, then the
one who had enmity between you
becomes a trusted and dear friend"
(41:34). This may seem like a con
tradiction if the either-or approach
is utilized. However, a "both-and"
dialectic approach would attempt to
transcend, reconcile and find pro
found truth in both verses.
The Qu'ran is basically delineat
ing a number of different strategies,
the validity of which are contingent
on the situational and contextual
factors. A Muslim, according to the
Islamic teachings, should do her or
his best to understand the context,
investigate the issue diligently and

exhaustively, and then formulate a
judgment that she or he thinks is the
best given the circumstances on the
ground.
While doing this exercise, Mus
lims differ on what weight should be
given to the different guiding princi
ples relevant to a particular context.
This leads to an inherent diversity
within the Islamic faith. This diversi
ty is also related to the fact that the
Qu ran, in addition to its self-evi
dent definitive layer of meaning, has
several speculative layers that are
open to a process of interpretation
to be undertaken in conformity to
the definitives and the rules of the
Arabic language.
It must be mentioned that a Mus
lim may become selective and simply
ignore some indispensable principles
while working out what she or he
should do in a given situation. Apart
from self-indulgence, the sociopoliti
cal context plays an important role in
inducing this selectivity. A Muslim
living where she or he finds Islam
constantly reviled and the Qu'ran
persistently misquoted may respond
apologetically by declaring Islam as
an "obviously" pacifist religion, ig
noring anything in the Qu'ran and the
Prophetic traditions testifying to the
contrary. A Muslim witnessing his
wife being raped and his children
slaughtered will very likely discard
