# Op-Ed
## 'Islamophobia' spreading in the world 
### RANIA ELTOM IBRAHIM AL-MOJEL 
The op-ed by Zachary Halde
man's ("Radical Islamists should be
considered Muslims too," Nov. 24)
illuminates the growing trend of "Is
lamophobia" in the United States,
and — alarmingly — at Stanford
University and other elite institutes
of higher learning. The unfortunate
silent acceptance of this trend is dis
turbing and warrants our attention.
Muslim students are becoming in
creasingly uncomfortable and ostra
cized through their experiences on
campus, and it is unacceptable to
allow for such intolerant behavior to
grow in our communities.
Islamophobic rhetoric generally
includes attacks on the Qu'ran and
exploits language barriers by misus
ing Arabic word translations to in
duce fear. By emphasizing the claim
that Islam is incompatible with mod
ern times instates the ideology that
the problems of today are caused by
Islam.
Any ideology taken out of context
can falsely be represented as the
cause of conflict, and Islamophobes
capitalize on this fact to support their
allegations.
The response of the community to
this exploitation of fact, or lack
thereof, is what Islamophobia thrives
upon. Thus, communities are often
inundated with perpetual anti-lslam
ic propaganda and readily accept
such accusations as fact.
Consequently, Islamophobia
fuels misdirected attacks, whether

verbal or physical, based on a misun
derstanding of fundamental beliefs.
This unfortunate trend has be
come an international concern.
United Nations secretary-general
Kofi Annan has initialed a seminar
to address this issue titled "Con
fronting Islamophobia: Education
for Tolerance and Understanding"
(http://www.un.org/News/Press/doc
s/2004/hr479B.doc.htm). This reem
phasizes the urgency to address this
arising mentality.
In our effort to set the stage for
constructive dialogue, we invite all
concerned community members to
a Stanford town hall meeting on Is
lamophobia. This meeting will take
place at the beginning of winter
quarter — please stay tuned for
more information about the details

of this event.
Our aim here is create a forum of
open discussion, away from rhetoric
that induces misunderstanding and
hatred. We accept and embrace this
responsibility to reach out and allow
students the chance to express and
voice their concerns in an open dia
logue with the representatives of the
Stanford Muslim community.
Any form of discrimination ne
cessitates a response from our com
munity, and it is our responsibility to
uphold the high standards of toler
ance and understanding we pride
ourselves on.

Rania Eltom is president of the
Muslim Student Awareness Net
work. Ibrahim Al-Mojel is president
of the Islamic Society at Stanford.
