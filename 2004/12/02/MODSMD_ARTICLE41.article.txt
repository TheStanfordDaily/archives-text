## Women's basketball sneaks by Texas Tech 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Steamrolling overmatched oppo
nents from the Big Sky and Sun Belt
conferences certainly makes the post
game tape review session more fun,
hut eventually elite teams must stand
up to challenges from the best and de
fend the number in front of their
name. On Sunday, No. 5 Stanford did
just that, defeating No. 11 Texas Tech
61-58 in a contest that came down to a
battle fora loose ball with two ticks
left on the clock and a one-point Car
dinal lead.
Cardinal fans had good reason for
confidence early in the afternoon.
Facing a talented Texas Tech squad,
Stanford came flying out of the gate,
scoring the first 12 points of the game
seemingly before the Lady Raiders
had time to react. With less than six
minutes remaining in the first half, a
lay-up by sophomore Kristen Newlin
stretched the Stanford advantage to
27-12.
Those viewers who strayed from

the Fox Sports Network in search of
NFL action, however, underestimat
ed the skill and resolve of the Cardi
nal's opponent. Raiders head coach
Marsha Sharp hasn't compiled a win
ning percentage of .761 over 22 sea
sons with teams that roll over and play
dead.
By halftime, the lead was 10. Two
minutes into the second half, the lead
was four. With 12 minutes left in the
game, a three-pointer by Tech stand
out junior Erin Grant gave the visitors
their first lead.
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer, for one, wasn't a bit sur
prised by the Lady Raiders' resilience.
"Watching the tape, I just thought.
"This is an awesome team,"' Van-
Derveer said. "We jumped on them
early, but they made some adjust
ments and started playing tougher.
They're a great team."
Those final 12 minutes were a test.
A test for an undefeated Cardinal
team facing its first ranked opponent
of the season and an opponent that
had won the previous two head-to

head contests, including a 55-46 upset
last year in Lubbock. Tex.
A test for the Lady Raiders, who
were looking for the ultimate regular
season prize: a road win against a Top
-10 team.
Ultimately, it was Stanford that
came up big (literally) in crunch time.
The Cardinal relentlessly fed the
ball inside to the post, where senior
T'Nae Thiel and junior Brooke
Smith had their way with Tech in the
paint. When guards Kelley Suminski
and Candice Wiggins took the ball,
they too attacked the hoop, Convert
ing lay-ups or drawing fouls from the
defense.
In total, Stanford shot just l-of-4
from beyond the three-point arc.
"We knew [Texas Tech center
Cisti Greenwalt] played behind a lot
in the post," Smith said. "She's a good
shot blocker, but we thought we could
get the ball inside more easily against
her."
Yet, the more the Cardinal pound
ed the ball inside, the more the Lady
Raiders coolly knocked down mid

range jumpers. Grant led the way for
Texas Tech, along with fellow guard
Chelsey Dabbs.
Dabbs played every minute of
what was essentially a heavyweight
slugfest, posting 12 points and
adding a pair of blocks. Grant, for
her part, seemed to take over the
game during stretches of the second
half, stealing the ball on the defen
sive end of the court and converting
open looks into points on the same
possession. She finished with a team
high 18 points.
"I think [Grant] is an Ail-Ameri
can point guard," VanDerveer said.
"She totally controls the game with
her ball-handling ability. She was an
extremely tough match-up for us,
and not only that, but she's a great
kid."
Nonetheless, there was simply too
much Smith and Thiel down the
stretch.
Thiel scored just eight points but
pulled down a game-high eight re-

Senior Kelley Suminski drives to the basket in a game against USC
last year. The Cardinal jumped out to an early lead Texas
Tech Sunday but defeated the Lady Raiders by just three points.
Smith scores career-high 22
points in win over Raiders

bounds and added two steals. Her second
steal was the clincher, as she pounced on a
loose hall with seconds remaining in the
game and knockcd down a pair of free
throws to put a Cardinal victory on ice.
Smith showed the ability that has had
VanDerveer excited since her transfer
from Duke last fall, scoring a career-high
22 points while shooting 11-17 from the

field.
At times, she looked unstoppable,
scoring almost at will against a Texas
Tech defense that refused to double
team her.
"They weren't fronting Brooke, and
she was one-on-one," VanDerveer said.
"She can score one-on-one against any
body. It was like a hot knife through but

ter in there."
After their tough victory, the Cardinal
will now have more than a week to pre
pare for their next contest.
On Dec. 10, Stanford will celebrate the
end of finals week with its first home game
at newly renovated Maples Pavilion
against Pepperdine at 7 p.m.

On Dec. 10, Stanford will celebrate the
end of finals week with its first home game
at newly renovated Maples Pavilion
against Pepperdine at 7 p.m.
Steamrolling overmatched oppo
nents from the Big Sky and Sun Belt
conferences certainly makes the post
game tape review session more fun,
hut eventually elite teams must stand
up to challenges from the best and de
fend the number in front of their
name. On Sunday, No. 5 Stanford did
just that, defeating No. 11 Texas Tech
61-58 in a contest that came down to a
battle fora loose ball with two ticks
left on the clock and a one-point Car
dinal lead.
Cardinal fans had good reason for
confidence early in the afternoon.
Facing a talented Texas Tech squad,
Stanford came flying out of the gate,
scoring the first 12 points of the game
seemingly before the Lady Raiders
had time to react. With less than six
minutes remaining in the first half, a
lay-up by sophomore Kristen Newlin
stretched the Stanford advantage to
27-12.
Those viewers who strayed from

the Fox Sports Network in search of
NFL action, however, underestimat
ed the skill and resolve of the Cardi
nal's opponent. Raiders head coach
Marsha Sharp hasn't compiled a win
ning percentage of .761 over 22 sea
sons with teams that roll over and play
dead.
By halftime, the lead was 10. Two
minutes into the second half, the lead
was four. With 12 minutes left in the
game, a three-pointer by Tech stand
out junior Erin Grant gave the visitors
their first lead.
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer, for one, wasn't a bit sur
prised by the Lady Raiders' resilience.
"Watching the tape, I just thought.
"This is an awesome team,"' Van-
Derveer said. "We jumped on them
early, but they made some adjust
ments and started playing tougher.
They're a great team."
Those final 12 minutes were a test.
A test for an undefeated Cardinal
team facing its first ranked opponent
of the season and an opponent that
had won the previous two head-to

head contests, including a 55-46 upset
last year in Lubbock. Tex.
A test for the Lady Raiders, who
were looking for the ultimate regular
season prize: a road win against a Top
-10 team.
Ultimately, it was Stanford that
came up big (literally) in crunch time.
The Cardinal relentlessly fed the
ball inside to the post, where senior
T'Nae Thiel and junior Brooke
Smith had their way with Tech in the
paint. When guards Kelley Suminski
and Candice Wiggins took the ball,
they too attacked the hoop, Convert
ing lay-ups or drawing fouls from the
defense.
In total, Stanford shot just l-of-4
from beyond the three-point arc.
"We knew [Texas Tech center
Cisti Greenwalt] played behind a lot
in the post," Smith said. "She's a good
shot blocker, but we thought we could
get the ball inside more easily against
her."
Yet, the more the Cardinal pound
ed the ball inside, the more the Lady
Raiders coolly knocked down mid

range jumpers. Grant led the way for
Texas Tech, along with fellow guard
Chelsey Dabbs.
Dabbs played every minute of
what was essentially a heavyweight
slugfest, posting 12 points and
adding a pair of blocks. Grant, for
her part, seemed to take over the
game during stretches of the second
half, stealing the ball on the defen
sive end of the court and converting
open looks into points on the same
possession. She finished with a team
high 18 points.
"I think [Grant] is an Ail-Ameri
can point guard," VanDerveer said.
"She totally controls the game with
her ball-handling ability. She was an
extremely tough match-up for us,
and not only that, but she's a great
kid."
Nonetheless, there was simply too
much Smith and Thiel down the
stretch.
Thiel scored just eight points but
pulled down a game-high eight re-

Senior Kelley Suminski drives to the basket in a game against USC
last year. The Cardinal jumped out to an early lead Texas
Tech Sunday but defeated the Lady Raiders by just three points.
Smith scores career-high 22
points in win over Raiders

bounds and added two steals. Her second
steal was the clincher, as she pounced on a
loose hall with seconds remaining in the
game and knockcd down a pair of free
throws to put a Cardinal victory on ice.
Smith showed the ability that has had
VanDerveer excited since her transfer
from Duke last fall, scoring a career-high
22 points while shooting 11-17 from the

field.
At times, she looked unstoppable,
scoring almost at will against a Texas
Tech defense that refused to double
team her.
"They weren't fronting Brooke, and
she was one-on-one," VanDerveer said.
"She can score one-on-one against any
body. It was like a hot knife through but

ter in there."
