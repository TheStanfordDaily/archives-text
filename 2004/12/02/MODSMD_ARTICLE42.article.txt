# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## A 						farewell to Coach Teevens, Spencer's buddy 
### 
I wrote. That's all 1 did for one entire af
ternoon over Thanksgiving Break. I
could tell the direction the tide was turn
ing, and wanted to put my little raft of
dissent in before the flood was on.
In between bites of turkey, I wrote a col
umn advocating for Buddy Teevens to remain
for one more season.
Don't shoot me.
So when 1 woke up Monday morning only
to see the Sports page of the Chronicle plas
tered with a farewell to Buddy, I was disap
pointed, not only because Teevens would be
leaving, but because I wasted half a day on a

column that would he utter
ly pointless to run. Howev
er, a pointless column has
never stopped me before,
and why start now?
So in my attempt to enter
the utterly pointless colum
nist hall of fame, I offer this,
my farewell to Mr. Teevens,
derived in large part from a
tryptophan-altered writing
session.

Dear Stanford Students:
1 hope you're happy. I do. I really do. I
hope you're happy to see Buddy Teevens, a
good man given the unfortunate task of com
pletely turning around a program decimated
when Tyrone Willingham left, struggling
through mediocrity, only to be fired in the
end. Don't agree with me? Then you haven't
looked closely enough at the state of Stanford
Football, and need to answer some questions.
1. Why was TE Alex Smith extra-special
this year? Aside from being a tip top tight end,
he was the only offensive senior starter. That's
it. One offensive senior starter. One. As in,
"Gee, that's a whole lot of returning starters
next year."
2. Why is Cal so much better than us this
year? A number of reasons. One, Coach Ted
ford is paid more than double the salary given
to Buddy Teevens. Two, running back JJ Ar
rington and top NFL quarterback prospect
Aaron Rodgers. the dominant one-two punch
of the Golden Bears, aren't remembered
fondly by their freshman writing teachers...
because they were never freshmen at UC-
Berkeley. They were both junior college
transfers, something that isn't possible to do in
the academic environment at Stanford. Three,
because we are still growing. Four out of our
starting five offensive linemen are sopho
mores. Our quarterback and star wideout are
sophomores. Give them all two years in the
weight room, and then get back to me.
Or as I wrote over the weekend: "So when
you have Bill Walsh in love with Trent Ed
wards, an offensive line that is only getting
stronger, and wide receivers that have serious
potential, it would be an absolute crime to
steal that away from the rightful head coach. If
we fire Buddy now, the success that the team
will have next year will undeservedly go to the
new coach, which is so plagiaristic it should be
an honor code violation.
The fact is, we owe next season to Buddy.
The team is certainly on the right track, with
loads of potential, a quarterback with an NFL
future and a coach liked by his players.
Word to that.
However, students, what really bothers me
about the state of the football team isn't its po
tential, direction or attitude. It's the dedica
tion.
My fellow students, you know what both
ered me the most about this most recent sea
son? It happened the Thursday night before


Spencer Porter
Buddy shouldn't
bear all the blame

Big Game. I was at senior pub night, having
a glorious time, still reveling in the exciting
atmosphere created by the Pre-Game rally
after Gaieties. I was chatting with friends,
talking up the game, and generally having a
good time — until I looked down to the end
of the bar, and I saw two Stanford football
players there.
Now, I have absolutely no evidence that
they were drinking alcohol. For all I know,
they had Gatorade in those glasses, hydrat
ing for the game. However, it sends the
exact wrong message to the student body
when we see our football players in bars 36
hours before the biggest game of the sea
son. This wasn't an isolated incident either,
as many students have told me.
So what's the answer to this? Do we
need a militaristic coach to instill fear into

our players so that they prepare themselves
for big games? Does an athletic scholarship,
a long tradition of success, and personal
pride not necessarily motivate our athletes?
Some students have long blamed Buddy
for our team's problems. And to some ex
tent, they may be right. However, I hope he
is remembered for building the foundation
of a strong program, and not necessarily for
the record he accrued.
So in the end, I guess I am advocating for
change, but I'm just not entirely sure a
coaching switch was it.

Spencer Porter is a senior who swears that
he wasn't that guy who hit on you at Pub
Night. E-mail him just to double-check at
porters@stanford.edu.

fondly by their freshman writing teachers...
because they were never freshmen at UC-
Berkeley. They were both junior college
transfers, something that isn't possible to do in
the academic environment at Stanford. Three,
because we are still growing. Four out of our
starting five offensive linemen are sopho
mores. Our quarterback and star wideout are
sophomores. Give them all two years in the
weight room, and then get back to me.
Or as I wrote over the weekend: "So when
you have Bill Walsh in love with Trent Ed
wards, an offensive line that is only getting
stronger, and wide receivers that have serious
potential, it would be an absolute crime to
steal that away from the rightful head coach. If
we fire Buddy now, the success that the team
will have next year will undeservedly go to the
new coach, which is so plagiaristic it should be
an honor code violation.
The fact is, we owe next season to Buddy.
The team is certainly on the right track, with
loads of potential, a quarterback with an NFL
future and a coach liked by his players.
Word to that.
However, students, what really bothers me
about the state of the football team isn't its po
tential, direction or attitude. It's the dedica
tion.
My fellow students, you know what both
ered me the most about this most recent sea
son? It happened the Thursday night before

Buddy shouldn't
bear all the blame

Big Game. I was at senior pub night, having
a glorious time, still reveling in the exciting
atmosphere created by the Pre-Game rally
after Gaieties. I was chatting with friends,
talking up the game, and generally having a
good time — until I looked down to the end
of the bar, and I saw two Stanford football
players there.
Now, I have absolutely no evidence that
they were drinking alcohol. For all I know,
they had Gatorade in those glasses, hydrat
ing for the game. However, it sends the
exact wrong message to the student body
when we see our football players in bars 36
hours before the biggest game of the sea
son. This wasn't an isolated incident either,
as many students have told me.
So what's the answer to this? Do we
need a militaristic coach to instill fear into

our players so that they prepare themselves
for big games? Does an athletic scholarship,
a long tradition of success, and personal
pride not necessarily motivate our athletes?
Some students have long blamed Buddy
for our team's problems. And to some ex
tent, they may be right. However, I hope he
is remembered for building the foundation
of a strong program, and not necessarily for
the record he accrued.
So in the end, I guess I am advocating for
change, but I'm just not entirely sure a
coaching switch was it.

I wrote. That's all 1 did for one entire af
ternoon over Thanksgiving Break. I
could tell the direction the tide was turn
ing, and wanted to put my little raft of
dissent in before the flood was on.
In between bites of turkey, I wrote a col
umn advocating for Buddy Teevens to remain
for one more season.
Don't shoot me.
So when 1 woke up Monday morning only
to see the Sports page of the Chronicle plas
tered with a farewell to Buddy, I was disap
pointed, not only because Teevens would be
leaving, but because I wasted half a day on a

column that would he utter
ly pointless to run. Howev
er, a pointless column has
never stopped me before,
and why start now?
So in my attempt to enter
the utterly pointless colum
nist hall of fame, I offer this,
my farewell to Mr. Teevens,
derived in large part from a
tryptophan-altered writing
session.

Dear Stanford Students:
1 hope you're happy. I do. I really do. I
hope you're happy to see Buddy Teevens, a
good man given the unfortunate task of com
pletely turning around a program decimated
when Tyrone Willingham left, struggling
through mediocrity, only to be fired in the
end. Don't agree with me? Then you haven't
looked closely enough at the state of Stanford
Football, and need to answer some questions.
1. Why was TE Alex Smith extra-special
this year? Aside from being a tip top tight end,
he was the only offensive senior starter. That's
it. One offensive senior starter. One. As in,
"Gee, that's a whole lot of returning starters
next year."
2. Why is Cal so much better than us this
year? A number of reasons. One, Coach Ted
ford is paid more than double the salary given
to Buddy Teevens. Two, running back JJ Ar
rington and top NFL quarterback prospect
Aaron Rodgers. the dominant one-two punch
of the Golden Bears, aren't remembered
fondly by their freshman writing teachers...
