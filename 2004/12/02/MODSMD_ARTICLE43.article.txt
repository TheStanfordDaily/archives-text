## Azevedo scores game-winning goal; Cardinal earn fourth straight shot at NCAA title 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
You couldn't grab a drink, you couldn't run to the bath
room, you couldn't turn your head away fora minute. If
you did you would miss Tony Azevedo's fist pump after
another goal, or another one of UCLA's defensive stops.
If you were a spectator at the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration Tournament final, chances are you were glued to
your seat for the entire match.
It wasn't until there were a little over three minutes
left in the tilt that Azevedo, senior driver and two-time
Olympian, locked a 7-6 win for the second-ranked Car
dinal with his third goal of the night.
But even then, the game was far from over. Neither
defense was willing to play in the shadow of another, and
No. 1 UCLA and Stanford battled it out until the final
seconds of the game, each squad vying for an automatic
berth to the NCAA Tournament.
Finally, as the clock ran out in the fourth period, the
Bruins' senior Albert Garcia, who led his team with two
goals Sunday night, had one last chance to tie the game.
But Garcia's pass sailed wide of his target, and with no
time left, Stanford escaped with a victory.
"This last tournament we've been playing well togeth
er." junior driver Thomas Hopkins said, adding that play
ing together was a problem the squad faced throughout
this season. "We timed it just right."
The fact that the Cardinal and Bruins were the top
teams in the nation made the game's tension palpable. The
two teams had spent the season building up a mini-rivalry.
Stanford narrowly defeated the Bruins 8-7 early in the
year, thanks to a last-minute goal, before UCLA stunned
then-No. 1 Stanford in double overtime two weeks later.
Then, when the Cardinal visited Los Angeles in
search of a win. the Bruins again stumped Stanford in a
7-4 victory.
The Cardinal had that match ingrained in their minds
and had vowed not to let something like it happen again,
motivating Stanford to stay in there all four periods.
Sunday's match simply continued the teams' trend of
closely played matches.
Garcia started the Bruin offense with a goal on
UCLA's first possession. A minute later, Azevedo fired
in a shot from seven meters to pull even. Stanford took
the lead for the first time when senior driver Greg
Crum's shot managed to fall behind UCLA's goalkeep
er Joe Axelgrad.
But with 1:45 left in the first period and with a man

up advantage, Garcia scored again to end the first in a 2-
2 tie.
The second quarter was just as back-and-forth with
each team scoring twice. Crum's backhand was countered
with a goal from inside courtesy of UCLA's Josh Hewko.
Junior driver Peter Varellas scored cross-cage with 15 sec
onds to go in the half, but with two seconds the Bruin's an
swered with a goal of their own.
The Cardinal squad was unfazed.
"I love close games," Hopkins said.
There were plenty of good defensive stops on both
sides of the pool, but the defenses certainly stepped up in
the second half.
Brett Ormsby opened the half with a goal followed by
Azevedo's floater. Things got heated between the two
teams, leading to the exclusions of Azevedo, Ormsby and
another Bruin. With a rare five-on-four offense, sopho
more driver Tyler Drake's side shot gave Stanford a 6-5
lead.
The clock read one second left.
Stanford's defense then let only one more goal get by
on a power play in the fourth period. Not only did junior
goalkeeper Chad Taylor play well when it came down to
the clutch (recording four of his eight saves in the final
period), but the field stepped up its defense as well, pro
viding plenty of knocked-down balls, swat-aways and
steals.
The team acknowledged the roles of head coach John
Vargas and assistant coach Brian Kreutzkamp in the Car
dinal's well-executed defensive plan.
"One of the things that doesn't get press is the coach's
(role]," Taylor said, adding that they are essential in "help
ing us work out the details."
Stanford was assured an NCAA Tournament appear
ance with its 8-5 win over No. 3 USC Saturday. The Cardi
nal knew all they had to do was get into the MPSF final
game to score a spot in the NCAAs.
While this game was close in the first period, 2-1, Stan
ford slowly opened up a lead. Taylor recorded six saves,
and Azevedo led Stanford with four goals.
Because of their 23-3 season, and because they were
ranked No. 1 most of the season, the Bruins were awarded
the at-large berth to the NCAAs.
One last UCLA-Stanford matchup looks to be in the
works, so fans attending the Stanford-hosted NCAA
Championships are advised: grab a bite prior to the game,
take your bathroom break before you take your seat, and
try not to blink.

teams in the nation made the game's tension palpable. The
two teams had spent the season building up a mini-rivalry.
Stanford narrowly defeated the Bruins 8-7 early in the
year, thanks to a last-minute goal, before UCLA stunned
then-No. 1 Stanford in double overtime two weeks later.
Then, when the Cardinal visited Los Angeles in
search of a win. the Bruins again stumped Stanford in a
7-4 victory.
The Cardinal had that match ingrained in their minds
and had vowed not to let something like it happen again,
motivating Stanford to stay in there all four periods.
Sunday's match simply continued the teams' trend of
closely played matches.
Garcia started the Bruin offense with a goal on
UCLA's first possession. A minute later, Azevedo fired
in a shot from seven meters to pull even. Stanford took
the lead for the first time when senior driver Greg
Crum's shot managed to fall behind UCLA's goalkeep
er Joe Axelgrad.
But with 1:45 left in the first period and with a man

up advantage, Garcia scored again to end the first in a 2-
2 tie.
The second quarter was just as back-and-forth with
each team scoring twice. Crum's backhand was countered
with a goal from inside courtesy of UCLA's Josh Hewko.
Junior driver Peter Varellas scored cross-cage with 15 sec
onds to go in the half, but with two seconds the Bruin's an
swered with a goal of their own.
The Cardinal squad was unfazed.
"I love close games," Hopkins said.
There were plenty of good defensive stops on both
sides of the pool, but the defenses certainly stepped up in
the second half.
Brett Ormsby opened the half with a goal followed by
Azevedo's floater. Things got heated between the two
teams, leading to the exclusions of Azevedo, Ormsby and
another Bruin. With a rare five-on-four offense, sopho
more driver Tyler Drake's side shot gave Stanford a 6-5
lead.
The clock read one second left.
Stanford's defense then let only one more goal get by
on a power play in the fourth period. Not only did junior
goalkeeper Chad Taylor play well when it came down to
the clutch (recording four of his eight saves in the final
period), but the field stepped up its defense as well, pro
viding plenty of knocked-down balls, swat-aways and
steals.
The team acknowledged the roles of head coach John
Vargas and assistant coach Brian Kreutzkamp in the Car
dinal's well-executed defensive plan.
"One of the things that doesn't get press is the coach's
(role]," Taylor said, adding that they are essential in "help
ing us work out the details."
Stanford was assured an NCAA Tournament appear
ance with its 8-5 win over No. 3 USC Saturday. The Cardi
nal knew all they had to do was get into the MPSF final
game to score a spot in the NCAAs.
While this game was close in the first period, 2-1, Stan
ford slowly opened up a lead. Taylor recorded six saves,
and Azevedo led Stanford with four goals.
Because of their 23-3 season, and because they were
ranked No. 1 most of the season, the Bruins were awarded
the at-large berth to the NCAAs.
One last UCLA-Stanford matchup looks to be in the
works, so fans attending the Stanford-hosted NCAA
Championships are advised: grab a bite prior to the game,
take your bathroom break before you take your seat, and
try not to blink.

last Saturday . Stanford held the Bruins to two goals in the second half of Sunday's 7-6 nail-biter.
You couldn't grab a drink, you couldn't run to the bath
room, you couldn't turn your head away fora minute. If
you did you would miss Tony Azevedo's fist pump after
another goal, or another one of UCLA's defensive stops.
If you were a spectator at the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration Tournament final, chances are you were glued to
your seat for the entire match.
It wasn't until there were a little over three minutes
left in the tilt that Azevedo, senior driver and two-time
Olympian, locked a 7-6 win for the second-ranked Car
dinal with his third goal of the night.
But even then, the game was far from over. Neither
defense was willing to play in the shadow of another, and
No. 1 UCLA and Stanford battled it out until the final
seconds of the game, each squad vying for an automatic
berth to the NCAA Tournament.
Finally, as the clock ran out in the fourth period, the
Bruins' senior Albert Garcia, who led his team with two
goals Sunday night, had one last chance to tie the game.
But Garcia's pass sailed wide of his target, and with no
time left, Stanford escaped with a victory.
"This last tournament we've been playing well togeth
er." junior driver Thomas Hopkins said, adding that play
ing together was a problem the squad faced throughout
this season. "We timed it just right."
