# Volleyball gets unexpectedly low seed in NCAA Tourney
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS STAFF WRITER 
The road to Long Beach for the Cardinal
was set this Sunday, and it's not quite the route
the team expected.
Stanford (24-6, 15-3 Pacific-10 Confer
ence), which finished the regular season with
the No. 6 ranking according to the AVCA
Poll, was given the 11 th seed overall. The Car
dinal will travel to their subregional matches
in Tallahassee. Fla., where they will take on
unranked Jacksonville (15-13, 8-2 Atlantic
Sun Conference) on Friday afternoon at 2
p.m.
If the Cardinal can get by Jacksonville,
they will play the winner of No. 13 Florida and
host-school Florida A&M, who play on Satur
day afternoon at 4 p.m. Florida was last year's
national runner-up, and Florida A&M is the
only team to beat top-seeded Nebraska this
season.
Stanford was a bit surprised at the seeding
the team was given by the national selection
committee. As a team that won its last nine
matches, including two victories over higher
ranked opponents (then-No. 1 Washington
and then-No. 4 USC), the Cardinal feel as
though they made a convincing case to be a
top 10 team.
"For the past few years, we've had a lot
more favorable seed," senior libero Leahi
Hall said. "With the last nine matches, many
of us assumed we'd be ranked higher."
Part of the reason for the seemingly low
ranking Stanford received could be explained
by the selection committee's lack of respect
for the Pac-10 Conference. Although three of
the top seven teams heading in to the tourna
ment were from the Pac-10, Washington re
ceived the conference's highest seed at No. 7.
USC received the eighth seed, even after los
ing a five-game match to conference bottom
dweller Washington State in its last regular
season match and finishing behind the Cardi
nal in third place in the conference.
"Obviously the selection committee
doesn't feel the Pac-10 is as powerful as it been
in the past," Hall said. "The committee has
their own criteria. At times they are more un
traditional than the AVCA poll, and I guess
they felt the Pac-10 in general was not as
