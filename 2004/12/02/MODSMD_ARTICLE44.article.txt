# Volleyball gets unexpectedly low seed in NCAA Tourney
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS STAFF WRITER 
The road to Long Beach for the Cardinal
was set this Sunday, and it's not quite the route
the team expected.
Stanford (24-6, 15-3 Pacific-10 Confer
ence), which finished the regular season with
the No. 6 ranking according to the AVCA
Poll, was given the 11 th seed overall. The Car
dinal will travel to their subregional matches
in Tallahassee. Fla., where they will take on
unranked Jacksonville (15-13, 8-2 Atlantic
Sun Conference) on Friday afternoon at 2
p.m.
If the Cardinal can get by Jacksonville,
they will play the winner of No. 13 Florida and
host-school Florida A&M, who play on Satur
day afternoon at 4 p.m. Florida was last year's
national runner-up, and Florida A&M is the
only team to beat top-seeded Nebraska this
season.
Stanford was a bit surprised at the seeding
the team was given by the national selection
committee. As a team that won its last nine
matches, including two victories over higher
ranked opponents (then-No. 1 Washington
and then-No. 4 USC), the Cardinal feel as
though they made a convincing case to be a
top 10 team.
"For the past few years, we've had a lot
more favorable seed," senior libero Leahi
Hall said. "With the last nine matches, many
of us assumed we'd be ranked higher."
Part of the reason for the seemingly low
ranking Stanford received could be explained
by the selection committee's lack of respect
for the Pac-10 Conference. Although three of
the top seven teams heading in to the tourna
ment were from the Pac-10, Washington re
ceived the conference's highest seed at No. 7.
USC received the eighth seed, even after los
ing a five-game match to conference bottom
dweller Washington State in its last regular
season match and finishing behind the Cardi
nal in third place in the conference.
"Obviously the selection committee
doesn't feel the Pac-10 is as powerful as it been
in the past," Hall said. "The committee has
their own criteria. At times they are more un
traditional than the AVCA poll, and I guess
they felt the Pac-10 in general was not as

J where we are, we're going to have to

! One possible explanation for the
; committee's apparent oversight may

Despite the distance, the Cardinal
could potentially have a relatively

less difficult road to the Final Four
than if they had been placed in a dif
ferent region closer to home.
"We certainly have the advan
tage of having Texas as the highest
seeded potential opponent in our re
gional." senior KZSU radio analyst
Brad Burton commented. "Facing
Washington or Minnesota (who are
hosting) on their home court would
have made the possibility of an ap
pearance in the Final Four much less
likely. The way things stand, and
with our recent hot streak, 1 don't
think we can lose."
Stanford, if it gets out of its Flori
da subregional, will travel to the
University of Wisconsin-Green Bay
for regional action.
"I've been through enough that I
take things as they come," Dunning
said. "Actually, the harder route
would have been playing a team like
Washington or Minnesota at home.

If you look at the regional statistics,
around 95 percent win at home."
"The bottom line is that no one is
going to just give you respect," Dun
ning continued. "You have to go out
there and earn it.and this team is
going to do just that."
Regardless, the Cardinal will
head into the tournament with some
hardware in tow. Five members of
the squad received all-conference
honors yesterday. Freshmen setter
Bryn Kehoe and middle blocker
Franci Girard were named to the
All-Freshman team. Senior opposite
Jenn Hucke received an honorable
mention nod for the All-Conference
squad.

more favorable seed," senior libero Leahi
Hall said. "With the last nine matches, many
of us assumed we'd be ranked higher."
Part of the reason for the seemingly low
ranking Stanford received could be explained
by the selection committee's lack of respect
for the Pac-10 Conference. Although three of
the top seven teams heading in to the tourna
ment were from the Pac-10, Washington re
ceived the conference's highest seed at No. 7.
USC received the eighth seed, even after los
ing a five-game match to conference bottom
dweller Washington State in its last regular
season match and finishing behind the Cardi
nal in third place in the conference.
"Obviously the selection committee
doesn't feel the Pac-10 is as powerful as it been
in the past," Hall said. "The committee has
their own criteria. At times they are more un
traditional than the AVCA poll, and I guess
they felt the Pac-10 in general was not as

Despite the distance, the Cardinal
could potentially have a relatively

than if they had been placed in a dif

"We certainly have the advan

Brad Burton commented. "Facing
Washington or Minnesota (who are
hosting) on their home court would
have made the possibility of an ap

"I've been through enough that I

said. "Actually, the harder route
would have been playing a team like
Washington or Minnesota at home.

If you look at the regional statistics,
around 95 percent win at home."
"The bottom line is that no one is
going to just give you respect," Dun

The road to Long Beach for the Cardinal
was set this Sunday, and it's not quite the route
the team expected.
Stanford (24-6, 15-3 Pacific-10 Confer
ence), which finished the regular season with
the No. 6 ranking according to the AVCA
Poll, was given the 11 th seed overall. The Car
dinal will travel to their subregional matches
in Tallahassee. Fla., where they will take on
unranked Jacksonville (15-13, 8-2 Atlantic
Sun Conference) on Friday afternoon at 2
p.m.
If the Cardinal can get by Jacksonville,
they will play the winner of No. 13 Florida and
host-school Florida A&M, who play on Satur
day afternoon at 4 p.m. Florida was last year's
national runner-up, and Florida A&M is the
only team to beat top-seeded Nebraska this
season.
Stanford was a bit surprised at the seeding
the team was given by the national selection
committee. As a team that won its last nine
matches, including two victories over higher
ranked opponents (then-No. 1 Washington
and then-No. 4 USC), the Cardinal feel as
though they made a convincing case to be a
top 10 team.
"For the past few years, we've had a lot
more favorable seed," senior libero Leahi
Hall said. "With the last nine matches, many
of us assumed we'd be ranked higher."
