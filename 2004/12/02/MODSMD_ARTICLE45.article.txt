# Broncos expose Card's weaknesses
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Santa Clara and Stanford are only sepa
rated by a 20-minute drive down Highway
101, hut the schools were not close on the
basketball court on Sunday. One team was
more physical, more athletic and more ac
tive. It played solid defense and dominated
the paint.
Unfortunately, that team was not Stan
ford, which lost to Santa Clara, 86-76. The
Cardinal (2-3) did not play particularly
poorly, but they did not play particularly
well, either. The Broncos built up a second
half lead that the Cardinal could not cut
into as the teams traded baskets in the wan

ing minutes. Stanford could not control the
defensive boards, and the Broncos capital
ized, scoring 18 second-chance points in the
second half alone.
Santa Clara power forward Travis
Niesen gave Stanford's big men fits, scoring
31 and pulling down 11 rebounds, five of
them on the offensive glass.
Stanford junior power forward Matt
Haryasz fouled out trying to guard him, and
center Rob Little spent much of the second
half on the bench after picking up his fourth
foul. Niesen capitalized, making 13-of-15
foul shots.
"The Carolina kids couldn't figure him
out, and neither could our group," said
head coach Trent Johnson, referring to
Santa Clara's 77-66 victory over North Car
olina a week ago, a game in which Niesen
scored 26 points.
After building a five-point lead early in
the second half, Stanford fell behind 52-45
during a sloppy 17-5 Santa Clara run. In
that span, the Cardinal committed two
fouls and a goal-tend on the defensive end
and blew three lay-ups on the offensive
side.
Junior Dan Grunfeld ended the scoring
drought with a lay-in with 9:34 remaining
and kept the Cardinal'schances alive, pour
ing in eight points in the next four minutes.
Grunfeld kept the game close, scoring a ca
reer-high 26 points, most of them on drives
to the basket. His lay-up with 5:34 left cut
the Stanford deficit to four, but a 12-3 Santa
Clara run all but sealed the victory.
The Broncos put the icing on the cake
with an acrobatic alley-oop from senior
Doron Perkins to junior Tristan Parham in
the half-court set with 1:40 left. It ran the
lead to 79-67 and brought the home crowd
to its feet.
Stanford was plagued by poor shooting
and listless defense. The team shot only 31
percent in the first half, and players not
named Grunfeld made only four baskets.
But Santa Clara did not do much better and
the half ended in Stanford's favor, 29-28.
"People (like me) have to hit their shots
and we have to take higher-result shots,"
junior point guard Chris Hernandez said.

He finished with eight assists and just two
turnovers, but made only three of his 10 at
tempts from the field. "If we can play solid
defense and hit our open shots, we'll be
okay."
Stanford was not able to do either in the
second half. The Broncos pounded the ball
inside and it paid off: they shot 62 percent
from the floor and attempted 27 free
throws in the second period alone, while
Stanford shot only 43 percent.
"Santa Clara was the aggressor tonight,"
Johnson said. "Our lack of toughness and
our inability to be aggressive is a concern."
The Cardinal showed a flash of that ag
gressiveness in the beginning of the second
half. They played tough defense and got the
ball inside. Stanford opened the scoring
with a pass by Hernandez to a cutting
Haryasz.
On the next play, senior guard Nick
Robinson stole the ball and raced across
the court for an uncontested dunk. Hernan
dez got the ball inside fora Rob Little lay
up, and Little returned the favor, passing to
Hernandez, who sank an open three-point
er. But after another Little lay-up, the Car
dinal stopped working the ball inside and
stopped making the easy shots.
Grunfeld said that the team can t afford
to let up when it has a lead.
"We can't expect to win just because of
the name on our chest," he said. "After last
year we're used to being hunted, but now
we have to be the hunter. We have to play
every game like it's our last."
The Santa Clara game will be the Cardi
nal's last fora while. The team will have two
weeks to regroup before traveling to Michi
gan State. There is work to be done on
shooting, rebounding and defense; in a
word, everything.
Grunfeld tried to get to the core of the
team's woes.
"There is no magical equation for win
ning except heart and toughness," he said.
The Cardinal learned that from their neigh
bors to the South. If the team can play
tough for 40 minutes, maybe everything
else — like hard-nosed defense, rebound
ing and easy shots — will follow


Santa Clara had senior forward Nick
Robinson and the Cardinal squad looking
for answers in the Broncos 86-76 win.
