ford women travel to San
Francisco fora game against
USF on Dec. 12. The Cardinal
will then fly to Missouri fora
game against Miz/ou on the
18th.
However, the date that
every Cardinal player has cir
cled on her calendar is Dec.
21. Stanford travels to Ten
nessee to take on the No. 1
Vols in the biggest matchup of
the season so far. There's
nothing the Cardinal would
like more than to put a big fat
"W" under each of their
Christmas trees.
The Lady Vols have
looked vulnerable so far this
season, having lost to then-
No. 4 Texas by a score of 74-
59. Tennessee also barely
managed to escape with a win
against unheralded Temple,
eking out a 52-48 win on the
shoulders of guard Shanna
Zolman.
The Lady Vols are led by
their trio of prolific scorers —
Zolman, senior forward Brit
tany Jackson and junior guard
Shyra Ely. Together, the trio
average over 30 points a game
in Tennessee's balanced of
fense.
The Cardinal lost an over
time thriller to Tennessee in
their matchup last year, and
the sting of losing such a close
game is still fresh. The Lady
Vols came back from double-

Five games into the season, the Cardi
nal women's basketball team finds itself at
5-0. fresh off an impressive win over No. 12
Texas Tech. .Stanford has chewed up and
spit out each of its opponents, prompting
the casual fan to wonder. "Can this team
go even further than last year's elite eight
team?" Well, the real question is, "Can
dice team go farther?" and the answer is a
resounding yes.
Thanks to the consistently clutch play
of freshman sensation Candice Wiggins,
the Cardinal extended their season-open
ing winning streak to five games with a 61-
58 win over Texas Tech. Wiggins scored
the go-ahead basket with 1:34 left to play,
and the Cardinal held on to win with a
steal and two converted free throws from
senior T'Nae Thiel.
Junior Brooke Smith led the Cardinal
offensive attack with 22 points, with senior
guard Kelly Suniinski adding 13 and Wig
gins dropping in 11. Wiggins is averaging
15.4 points per game in her freshman sea
son thus far.
The win over Texas Tech followed a
successful trip to the frozen tundras of
Alaska where the Cardinal defeated East
ern Washington and Louisiana-Lafayette
to win the Great Alaska Shootout. Stan
ford was hardly challenged in either game,
winning by margins of 41 and 20 points.
The Cardinal have a brief hiatus before
their next game on Dec. 10 at home
against Pepperdine. The Stanford women
will play the first-ever game in the newly
renovated Maples Pavilion.
The Waves come to Maples with a 1-3
record after losing their last game against
Montana. 6-foot-3 senior center Jennifer
Lacy has been a potent offensive weapon
for Pepperdine so far this season, pouring in
26 points in the losing effort against Mon
tana. Thiel, at 6-foot-1, and Smith, at 6-foot -
3, should be well equipped to stop Lacy.
After the Pepperdine game, the Stan

digit deficits to force overtime and eventu
ally prevail 70-66. Zolman and Ely were
instrumental in the win last year and will
look to repeat the feat this year.
Stanford will round out its Christmas
break schedule and the 2004 calendar year
with its first conference games against
Oregon and Oregon State.

Stanford guard Kelly Suminski will
head into the holiday stretch of games
with another accolade to her name. Sum
inski was nominated for the 2(X)4-05 Bay
erAdvantage Senior CLASS Award. She
is only the 25th player in Stanford history
to score over 1 (XXJ points in her career and

to win the Great Alaska Shootout. Stan
ford was hardly challenged in either game,
winning by margins of 41 and 20 points.
The Cardinal have a brief hiatus before
their next game on Dec. 10 at home
against Pepperdine. The Stanford women
will play the first-ever game in the newly
renovated Maples Pavilion.
The Waves come to Maples with a 1-3
record after losing their last game against
Montana. 6-foot-3 senior center Jennifer
Lacy has been a potent offensive weapon
for Pepperdine so far this season, pouring in
26 points in the losing effort against Mon
tana. Thiel, at 6-foot-1, and Smith, at 6-foot -
3, should be well equipped to stop Lacy.
After the Pepperdine game, the Stan

digit deficits to force overtime and eventu
ally prevail 70-66. Zolman and Ely were
instrumental in the win last year and will
look to repeat the feat this year.
Stanford will round out its Christmas
break schedule and the 2004 calendar year

Oregon and Oregon State.

Stanford guard Kelly Suminski will
head into the holiday stretch of games
with another accolade to her name. Sum
inski was nominated for the 2(X)4-05 Bay
erAdvantage Senior CLASS Award. She
is only the 25th player in Stanford history
to score over 1 (XXJ points in her career and
