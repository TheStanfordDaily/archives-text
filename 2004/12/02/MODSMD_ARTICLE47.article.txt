# Stanford slated for seven games over winter break
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After five grueling and revealing games
to open the season, the tests continue for
the Stanford men's basketball team. But for
the next 10 days, they are strictly of the
paper-and-pencil variety.
The Cardinal (2-3) will enjoy their
longest break of the season for final exams
before returning to the court fora national
ly televised Dec. 11 matchup with No. 11
Michigan State at the Palace at Auburn
Hills. While the season is young, Stanford
heads into the break with a sense of urgen
cy.
"We have to play every game like it's our
last," junior guard Dan Grunfeld said.
"This isn't like an NBA season; it's only 30
games. We have to get up for everything.
Every game counts; every one counts to
wards the final goal."
As the Cardinal gear up for the Pacific
-10 Conference season, here's a look at three
areas for improvement over the course of
the rest of the non-conference schedule:
Rebounding:
Stanford dominated the boards by an av
erage margin of six rebounds per game last
season but has been out-rebounded in four
of five games this season, including all three
of its losses. With as much stock as head
coach Trent Johnson puts into rebounding
and defense, expect the Cardinal to im
prove in both departments as they continue
to get used to playing alongside each other.
Better rebounding and defense will create
more opportunities in transition, which is
one of the hallmarks of the aggressive style
of play Johnson would like to make the sta
ple of his team.
"Our main concerns are playing D' and
rebounding," said junior point guard Chris
Hernandez. "We have to come out and
practice hard. We have to be relentless in
rebounding. We have to be tough all the
way around. We can't afford to relax."
Perimeter Shooting:
Johnson has made it very clear that his
team will first and foremost look to score in
side, where it will continue to lean heavily
on big men Rob Little and Matt Haryasz.
The pair has played well on the offensive
end, with Little and Haryasz averaging 10.6
and 11.4 points per game, respectively.
Both have been forced to work hard for
their points, however, often after multiple
put-back attempts, and cannot be expected
to carry the team by bumping and grinding
for 30-plus minutes a game every night.
There has been no perimeter game to
complement the post players' inside domi
nance, which has created problems late in
games with Little and Haryasz in foul trou
ble or hounded inside. Hernandez is the
team's biggest three-point threat, and even
when his long-range numbers this season
(8-for-25) begin to creep back up toward
last season's 46 percent mark, the Cardinal
still need someone else to start hitting out
side shots.
Even the ability to shoot mid-range
jumpers with some consistency would take
some of the load off Stanford's big men. To
that end, versatile senior Nick Robinson,
who is shooting just .256 from the field,
must shake his early-season slump.
Bcnch Scoring:
Last season, only Hernandez (30.6) and
Matt Lottich (30.3) averaged over 30 min
utes per game. So far this season, Hernan
dez (37.2), Robinson (35.6), Grunfeld
(34.6) and Haryasz (30.8) all fall into that
category. Redshirt freshman Tim Morris
has played well and averaged 15 minutes off
the bench, while Stanford's other key re
serves— junior point guard Jason Haas,
sophomore guard Fred Washington and
true freshmen Taj Finger and Peter Prowitt
— are all averaging less than 10 minutes per
game. Only five games into the season,

Johnson has yet to find a consistent rota
tion. As Finger and Prowitt continue to de
velop, they could each see more minutes, as
could Washington, who looked good in the
exhibition game but has been limited due to
Stanford's surplus of shooting guards and
the strong play of Grunfeld (team-best 19.4
points per game). The return of two-sport
athletes Evan Moore and Mark Bradford
will help.
Stanford's Winter Break Schedule:
Dec. 11 at Michigan State, 1 p.m.: In addi
tion to the No. 11 Spartans, Stanford must
also contend with the Izzone, Michigan
State's student-section, whose name pays
homage to head coach Tom Izzo. More than
3XHX) seats were added to the Izzone this
season, which was limited to 950 members
last season. During player introductions,
Stanford can expect to be greeted by shouts
of "Who cares!" from the Izzone, while stu
dents pretend to read the newspaper.
Dec. 13 at Denver, 6 p.m.: Stanford will
make a stop in Denver on its way back from
East Lansing to take on the Pioneers for the
first time since 1973. Bench play could be
particularly important in the thin air of the
Mile High City.
Dec. 18 vs. UC-Davis, 7 p.m.: Want to see
an instant replay of that sick Rob Little
dunk? Well, now you can. The Cardinal
play their first game in the renovated
Maples Pavilion, which includes a score
board hung above center court and a new
lower seating bowl.
Dec. 22 vs. Dartmouth. 7 p.m.: After enter
taining Harvard last season, Stanford wel
comes another Ivy League foe to Maples.
The Big Green should not pose much more
of a threat than the Crimson, which fell to
the Cardinal 100-59.
Dec. 23 vs. Montana. 7 p.m.: Stanford will
look to avenge the 70-68 home loss to the
Grizzlies that it suffered two years ago.
Dec. 31 at Washington State, 5 p.m.: The
Cardinal kick off their Pacific-10 Confer
ence season with a trip to Pullman, where
Dick Bennett's defensive-minded Cougars
are hungry for another crack at Stanford
after last year's near upset.
Jan. 2 at Washington, 12:30 p.m.: New Year,

Defense and rebounding top junior point
guard Chris Hernandez's list of concerns
this season.
After five grueling and revealing games
to open the season, the tests continue for
the Stanford men's basketball team. But for
the next 10 days, they are strictly of the
paper-and-pencil variety.
The Cardinal (2-3) will enjoy their
longest break of the season for final exams
before returning to the court fora national
ly televised Dec. 11 matchup with No. 11
Michigan State at the Palace at Auburn
Hills. While the season is young, Stanford
heads into the break with a sense of urgen
cy.
"We have to play every game like it's our
last," junior guard Dan Grunfeld said.
"This isn't like an NBA season; it's only 30
games. We have to get up for everything.
Every game counts; every one counts to
wards the final goal."
As the Cardinal gear up for the Pacific
-10 Conference season, here's a look at three
areas for improvement over the course of
the rest of the non-conference schedule:
Rebounding:
Stanford dominated the boards by an av
erage margin of six rebounds per game last
season but has been out-rebounded in four
of five games this season, including all three
of its losses. With as much stock as head
coach Trent Johnson puts into rebounding
and defense, expect the Cardinal to im
prove in both departments as they continue
to get used to playing alongside each other.
Better rebounding and defense will create
more opportunities in transition, which is
one of the hallmarks of the aggressive style
of play Johnson would like to make the sta
ple of his team.
"Our main concerns are playing D' and
rebounding," said junior point guard Chris
Hernandez. "We have to come out and
practice hard. We have to be relentless in
rebounding. We have to be tough all the
way around. We can't afford to relax."
Perimeter Shooting:
Johnson has made it very clear that his
team will first and foremost look to score in
side, where it will continue to lean heavily
on big men Rob Little and Matt Haryasz.
The pair has played well on the offensive
end, with Little and Haryasz averaging 10.6
and 11.4 points per game, respectively.
Both have been forced to work hard for
their points, however, often after multiple
put-back attempts, and cannot be expected
to carry the team by bumping and grinding
for 30-plus minutes a game every night.
There has been no perimeter game to
complement the post players' inside domi
nance, which has created problems late in
games with Little and Haryasz in foul trou
ble or hounded inside. Hernandez is the
team's biggest three-point threat, and even
when his long-range numbers this season
(8-for-25) begin to creep back up toward
last season's 46 percent mark, the Cardinal
still need someone else to start hitting out
side shots.
Even the ability to shoot mid-range
jumpers with some consistency would take
some of the load off Stanford's big men. To
that end, versatile senior Nick Robinson,
who is shooting just .256 from the field,
must shake his early-season slump.
Bcnch Scoring:
Last season, only Hernandez (30.6) and
Matt Lottich (30.3) averaged over 30 min
utes per game. So far this season, Hernan
dez (37.2), Robinson (35.6), Grunfeld
(34.6) and Haryasz (30.8) all fall into that
category. Redshirt freshman Tim Morris
has played well and averaged 15 minutes off
the bench, while Stanford's other key re
serves— junior point guard Jason Haas,
sophomore guard Fred Washington and
true freshmen Taj Finger and Peter Prowitt
— are all averaging less than 10 minutes per
game. Only five games into the season,

Johnson has yet to find a consistent rota
tion. As Finger and Prowitt continue to de
velop, they could each see more minutes, as
could Washington, who looked good in the
exhibition game but has been limited due to
Stanford's surplus of shooting guards and
the strong play of Grunfeld (team-best 19.4
points per game). The return of two-sport
athletes Evan Moore and Mark Bradford
will help.
Stanford's Winter Break Schedule:
Dec. 11 at Michigan State, 1 p.m.: In addi
tion to the No. 11 Spartans, Stanford must
also contend with the Izzone, Michigan
State's student-section, whose name pays
homage to head coach Tom Izzo. More than
3XHX) seats were added to the Izzone this
season, which was limited to 950 members
last season. During player introductions,
Stanford can expect to be greeted by shouts
of "Who cares!" from the Izzone, while stu
dents pretend to read the newspaper.
Dec. 13 at Denver, 6 p.m.: Stanford will
make a stop in Denver on its way back from
East Lansing to take on the Pioneers for the
first time since 1973. Bench play could be
particularly important in the thin air of the
Mile High City.
Dec. 18 vs. UC-Davis, 7 p.m.: Want to see
an instant replay of that sick Rob Little
dunk? Well, now you can. The Cardinal
play their first game in the renovated
Maples Pavilion, which includes a score
board hung above center court and a new
lower seating bowl.
Dec. 22 vs. Dartmouth. 7 p.m.: After enter
taining Harvard last season, Stanford wel
comes another Ivy League foe to Maples.
The Big Green should not pose much more
of a threat than the Crimson, which fell to
the Cardinal 100-59.
Dec. 23 vs. Montana. 7 p.m.: Stanford will
look to avenge the 70-68 home loss to the
Grizzlies that it suffered two years ago.
Dec. 31 at Washington State, 5 p.m.: The
Cardinal kick off their Pacific-10 Confer
ence season with a trip to Pullman, where
Dick Bennett's defensive-minded Cougars
are hungry for another crack at Stanford
after last year's near upset.
