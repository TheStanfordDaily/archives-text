# MPSF rematch may decide NCAA title
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Two weeks ago, the Stanford men's
water polo squad (22-4) refused to look too
far ahead. The Cardinal were focused on
their next opponent, though the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation tournament was
just around the corner.
Yes, Stanford's ultimate goal was to
reach the NCAAs, but throughout the sea
son the team repeated the oft-heard quote:
"One game at a time."
Well, Cardinal, you can look as far
ahead as you want now — you're in the
NCAAs and you're only two wins away
from the national title.
Of course, Stanford's path to its third
NCAA Championship in four years will be
challenging, if short. While Stanford ex
pects to defeat Loyola Marymount (20-10)
— representing weaker programs from
outside the MPSF conference — it also ex
pects to see season rival, the No. 1 UCLA
Bruins, at the end of the road.
"Barring any extreme upsets, we'll see
them in the finals," said junior goalkeeper
Chad Taylor. "We're both heads above
[Princeton and LMU]."
Top-seeded Stanford will face fourth
seeded Loyola Marymount for the first
time this season; the teams' previous
matchup was cancelled when LMU pulled
out. While LMU is making its third appear
ance in the national tournament in four
years, the Lions have yet to make it to the
final game.
The Lions, after waiting a week once
they wrapped up the Western Water Polo
Association league title, are led by junior
Endre Rex-Kiss. Kiss was named Player of
the Year for his conference this season.
If the Stanford defense plays as staunch
ly as it did on Sunday in its win against No.
1 UCLA, its offense will have an easier
time against LMU's goalkeeper lan Elliot.
Elliot has a 6.971 goals-against average
going in to face the MPSF's top-scoring
team.
Stanford earned a spot in the tourna
ment with a win over Southern California
last Saturday, but after defeating UCLA 7-
6 in the conference tournament final, the
Cardinal took the top seed. According to
junior driver Thomas Hopkins, things are
finally coming together.
"I think we're peaking right now which
is perfect," Hopkins said after Stanford
won the MPSF title Sunday night. "Hope

fully we can carry it throughout the week.
We have the rest of the week to rest."
The squad is playing at home for the sec
ond week in a row, as Stanford hosts the
NCAA tournament for the second consec
utive time at Avery Aquatic Center. Stan
ford looks to remain undefeated in its
home pool this season.
Senior driver Tony Azevedo continues
to lead the team with 71 goals. Azevedo, a
three-time Player of the Year, and four
other seniors will be playing their final
games with the Stanford squad this week
end.
If UCLA defeats No. 3 seed Princeton,
the Cardinal and Bruins will face each
other for the fifth time this season. The se
ries is currently split, 2-2, but Stanford
holds the overall lead, 69 wins to UCLA's
55.
The Bruins are led by Athens Olympian
Brett Ormsby, who is second behind
Azevedo in goals scored in the conference
with 67. UCLA also holds the second-high
est scoring average in the MPSF behind

Stanford.
While Stanford only wrapped up an
NCAA appearance last weekend, the na
tional tournament has been on its mind for
a while. Head coach John Vargas has led
the team to three straight NCAA finals,
winning in 2001 and 2002. Last year howev
er, Stanford was ousted by USC in a 9-7
double-overtime thriller. After the game,
Hopkins remembered seeing it unfold and
recalled, "it was surreal."
That memory is plenty motivation for
Stanford this year.
"Another thing that's really up there on
my mind is losing [NCAAs] last year
against SC in overtime," said senior driver
Greg Crum earlier this year, commenting
on what he remembered most from his ca
reer at Stanford. "That game sticks out in
mind and I don't want it to happen again."
Stanford will take to the pool to pursue
its year-long goal to return to the NCAA
Championship. Sunday's fight for the na
tional title is set to begin at 2 p.m.
