# Wrestlers take down S.F. State, 35-14
## Stanford notches four consecutive pins against Division II team as warm-up for regular season 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After dropping the first two weight
classes in major decisions, the Stanford
wrestling team (1-1,0-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) put on a clinic with four consecutive
pins against Division II opponent San Fran
cisco State (0-1) last Tuesday night.
Once Stanford had taken the command
ing 24-8 lead in the meet, it would not look
hack. The Cardinal coasted to a 35-14 vic
tory, earning their first dual meet win in rel
atively easy fashion.
"Anytime the team wins, it feels good,"
said head coach Steve Buddie. "We really
do stress using these meets as 'practice
matches' for the postseason, but because
we also very much stress our sport as a team
sport, it's encouraging to see the whole
team wrestling well from top to bottom. So,
for morale sake, it was important."
The visiting Gators took control early in

the dual meet as they shot out to a 8-0 lead
with major decision wins coming from
Donald Lockettat 141 lbs. (16-6 over junior
Chris Hayworth) and Pacifico Garcia at 149
lbs. (13-5 over junior Zack Hensley).
San Francisco State's lead would be
short-lived, however, as last year's NCAA
champion, 157-pound senior Matt Gentry
stepped onto the mat.
The Gators 157-pound Jaime Alvarez
fought valiantly early on, taking a 3-2 lead
in the match with an early escape and then
a takedown.
However, Gentry would not end his
consecutive win-streak on this night, es
pecially not at home. The defending
champion stormed back to pin Alvarez in
4:43.
Once Stanford broke through with a
pin, its wrestlers would not lose another
match.
The Cardinal continued to tighten their
grip on the match with three more consecu
tive pins. These pins were earned by fresh
man Scott Loescher at 165 lbs. in 2:22, ju
nior I mad Kharbush at 174 lbs. in 2:44 and
junior Mark Egesdal at 184 lbs. in 2:14.
The most impressive thing about this
streak in the match is that all of Stanford's
pins, except for Gentry's, came in the first
period of the match.
After less than 15 minutes of wrestling
the Cardinal held a significant 24-8 lead,
and the dual meet's momentum had

switched heavily in the home team's
favor.
"Anytime you get four pins in a dual
meet, there is reason to be excited," Bud
die said. "SF State has always had a qual
ity program, and for us to get four — in a
row, nonetheless — is terrific. Overall, I
was very pleased with the way the team
wrestled, especially given our minimal re
covery time following the weekend's
tournament."
Even with the massive lead, Stanford
was still relentless in its tenacity.
The Cardinal's 197-pound sophomore
lan Bork won an 8-2 decision over Chris
Bostick. Stanford 285-pound junior Shawn
Ritzenthaler dominated in a 15-2 major de
cision over Jonathon Vargas.
The Cardinal led the Gators 31-8 at this
point, and the dual meet had already been
decided.
Stanford decided to rest 125-pound se
nior Nathan Peterson so that he did not
have to put stress on a nagging sore knee.
The forfeit at 125 put the score at 31-14.
"We have been getting banged up a bit,
[with] a lot of knee and joint injuries in the
early going, but nothing that will sideline
anyone for an extended period of time,"
Buddie said.
The match closed out with Rafael
Chavez showcasing his athleticism and ag
gressive wrestling. The true freshman and
former three-time high school state cham
pion of Wyoming cruised to a 15-4 major
decision over Mikhail Higa. Chavez gave
up four escapes only to record six take
downs, including an impressive throw of his
opponent onto the mat.
"We've got some very talented young
guys in our lineup," Buddie said. "True
frosh Rafael Chavez and redshirt frosh
Josh Zupancic and Scott Loescher are off
to outstanding starts to their rookie sea
sons. They will be fun to watch for four
years."
The Stanford wrestling team will get
some time off before its next open tourna
ment, the Tournament of Champions in
Reno, Nev. on Dec. 19th.
Stanford finished the so-called first
"mini-season" at 1-1 in dual meets with two
open tournaments.
The regular season hits full stride in mid-
December. However, Stanford will not
wrestle at home again until February.
This break will give the Cardinal time
to prepare and rest nagging soreness and
minor injuries. Stanford hopes to be at full
strength when it travels past Lake Tahoe
for the next opportunity to wrestle.
"While dead and finals week are never
great for training, it is a great opportunity
for our athletes to catch up on ciasswork,
focus more on academics, while at the same
time heal their bodies," Buddie said. "We
certainly continue training during this aca
demically rigorous time, but the gap allows
us more options in the way we train while at
the same time giving the team a bit of a
break physically."

up four escapes only to record six take
downs, including an impressive throw of his
opponent onto the mat.
"We've got some very talented young
guys in our lineup," Buddie said. "True
frosh Rafael Chavez and redshirt frosh
Josh Zupancic and Scott Loescher are off
to outstanding starts to their rookie sea
sons. They will be fun to watch for four
years."
The Stanford wrestling team will get
some time off before its next open tourna
ment, the Tournament of Champions in
Reno, Nev. on Dec. 19th.
Stanford finished the so-called first
"mini-season" at 1-1 in dual meets with two
open tournaments.
The regular season hits full stride in mid-
December. However, Stanford will not
wrestle at home again until February.
This break will give the Cardinal time
to prepare and rest nagging soreness and
minor injuries. Stanford hopes to be at full
strength when it travels past Lake Tahoe
for the next opportunity to wrestle.
"While dead and finals week are never
great for training, it is a great opportunity
for our athletes to catch up on ciasswork,
focus more on academics, while at the same
time heal their bodies," Buddie said. "We
certainly continue training during this aca
demically rigorous time, but the gap allows
us more options in the way we train while at
the same time giving the team a bit of a
break physically."

Senior Matt Gentry continued his win streak in Stanford's victory over S.F. State. The
Cardinal's performance impressed head coach Steve Buddie.
After dropping the first two weight
classes in major decisions, the Stanford
wrestling team (1-1,0-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) put on a clinic with four consecutive
pins against Division II opponent San Fran
cisco State (0-1) last Tuesday night.
Once Stanford had taken the command
ing 24-8 lead in the meet, it would not look
hack. The Cardinal coasted to a 35-14 vic
tory, earning their first dual meet win in rel
atively easy fashion.
"Anytime the team wins, it feels good,"
said head coach Steve Buddie. "We really
do stress using these meets as 'practice
matches' for the postseason, but because
we also very much stress our sport as a team
sport, it's encouraging to see the whole
team wrestling well from top to bottom. So,
for morale sake, it was important."
The visiting Gators took control early in

the dual meet as they shot out to a 8-0 lead
with major decision wins coming from
Donald Lockettat 141 lbs. (16-6 over junior
Chris Hayworth) and Pacifico Garcia at 149
lbs. (13-5 over junior Zack Hensley).
San Francisco State's lead would be
short-lived, however, as last year's NCAA
champion, 157-pound senior Matt Gentry
stepped onto the mat.
The Gators 157-pound Jaime Alvarez
fought valiantly early on, taking a 3-2 lead
in the match with an early escape and then
a takedown.
However, Gentry would not end his
consecutive win-streak on this night, es
pecially not at home. The defending
champion stormed back to pin Alvarez in
4:43.
Once Stanford broke through with a
pin, its wrestlers would not lose another
match.
The Cardinal continued to tighten their
grip on the match with three more consecu
tive pins. These pins were earned by fresh
man Scott Loescher at 165 lbs. in 2:22, ju
nior I mad Kharbush at 174 lbs. in 2:44 and
junior Mark Egesdal at 184 lbs. in 2:14.
The most impressive thing about this
streak in the match is that all of Stanford's
pins, except for Gentry's, came in the first
period of the match.
After less than 15 minutes of wrestling
the Cardinal held a significant 24-8 lead,
and the dual meet's momentum had

switched heavily in the home team's
favor.
"Anytime you get four pins in a dual
meet, there is reason to be excited," Bud
die said. "SF State has always had a qual
ity program, and for us to get four — in a
row, nonetheless — is terrific. Overall, I
was very pleased with the way the team
wrestled, especially given our minimal re
covery time following the weekend's
tournament."
Even with the massive lead, Stanford
was still relentless in its tenacity.
The Cardinal's 197-pound sophomore
lan Bork won an 8-2 decision over Chris
Bostick. Stanford 285-pound junior Shawn
Ritzenthaler dominated in a 15-2 major de
cision over Jonathon Vargas.
The Cardinal led the Gators 31-8 at this
point, and the dual meet had already been
decided.
Stanford decided to rest 125-pound se
nior Nathan Peterson so that he did not
have to put stress on a nagging sore knee.
The forfeit at 125 put the score at 31-14.
"We have been getting banged up a bit,
[with] a lot of knee and joint injuries in the
early going, but nothing that will sideline
anyone for an extended period of time,"
Buddie said.
The match closed out with Rafael
Chavez showcasing his athleticism and ag
gressive wrestling. The true freshman and
former three-time high school state cham
pion of Wyoming cruised to a 15-4 major
decision over Mikhail Higa. Chavez gave
up four escapes only to record six take
downs, including an impressive throw of his
opponent onto the mat.
