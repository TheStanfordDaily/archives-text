# We can do better than this: Bring on the playoffs

### 
Hey, congratulations. Auburn
Tigers! After spending a year
plowing undefeated through
one of the most difficult confer
ences in the nation, you'll be rewarded with
a trip to beautiful New Orleans, where
you'll crush an unlucky opponent to win ...
nothing. Your shiny 11-0 record is impres
sive, but thanks for play-

ing, and please accept
this lovely Sugar Bowl
berth as a parting gift!
Nobody likes the
BCS. No one. After last
year's abomination,
where a one-loss USC
team was denied the right
to play in the title game in
favor of Oklahoma, it be
came even clearer that it

is a flawed way to deter
mine a national college football champion.
The solution to this has been stated early
and often, but only the support of an unher
alded genius like myself could bring it to
life: a playoff.
The new playoff system would be simple;
it would include the six major-conference
champions (Pac-10, Big Ten, Big XII, Big
East, ACC, SEC) and two other at-large
teams that could not come from any of these
conferences. This generates two great
ideas: First, if you play in a major confer
ence and can't end up on top, you don't de
serve to be in the playoff. This alone is great
because it maximizes conference play and
makes non-conference games into a sort of
"preseason." Thus, you'd get more USC-
Auburn non-conference games, because
teams would be willing to challenge them
selves early without risking a loss that
would — under the current system — exile
them from the ranks of the undefeated and
thus eliminate them from the title race.
Second, it also keeps the incentive for
good teams in smaller leagues to play
tough non-conference games in an effort
to boost their rankings to get into the elite
eight. This way, there's an outlet for the
little guy to get in that still keeps the onus
on the major-conference schools to win in
the regular season.
What's ludicrous, based on this premise,
is that some of the primary supporters of the
current system are the bowl sponsors. In the
event that a playoff actually came into exis
tence, the lesser bowls wouldn't disappear
any more than they already have. Instead of
being an utterly meaningless game between
Alabama and Minnesota, the Gaylord Ho
tels Music City Bowl would get to be an
early-round playoff between, say, Okla
homa and Utah. If Colin V. Reed, CEO of
Gaylord Hotels, can't figure out that the
new system would rake in WAY more
money in television advertising from that
matchup, then perhaps he doesn't deserve
to have his company name attached to the
traditionally prestigious Music City Bowl.
Here's a harsh wake-up call, Colin: the
only reason people tend to watch the lesser
bowl games is because the only TV alterna
tive that week is "Home Alone." The In
sight Bowl, for example, has absolutely no
relevance to anyone except the surrounding
markets of the schools directly involved, as

it will probably include two 8-3 teams, the
victor of which can claim to be the third
best team in its conference.
The major bowls could rotate through
the playoff system, with the title game
switching between the Rose. Sugar, Orange,
and Fiesta, just as it does now. The lesser
bowls wouldn't get completely left out ei
ther; even the ones that weren't rotated into
the playoff in the year in question would still
get second-place teams from the big confer
ences playing against one another.
Though the idea of a similar playoff has
bounced around fora while now, the argu
ment that "if it's not broken, why fix it?"
still comes up. This makes me want to im
pale myself with a spear, because the only
thing more broken than the BCS is Terrell
Owens' sense of class. Some teams simply
don't have the ability to get a tough non
conference schedule every year, so they
wind up undefeated but nobody cares. This
year's Utah team will join the ranks of past
teams like Tulane, who ended up without a
loss but got exiled to the Liberty Bowl.
Under a playoff system, the Utes would get
a shot at the title.
The BCS also discriminates against one
loss teams from major conferences, purely
based on the assumption that an undefeat
ed team from a-major conference is always
better than a one-loss team from another
major conference. Let's say Big Ten champ
Michigan has one loss. Don't they have a
case that they could beat an Oklahoma or a
USC team on any given Saturday?
The schools also tend to argue that a
playoff system would include more games
and would thus interfere with the players'
finals schedules. First of all, these games
would be played primarily over what is al
ready Christmas vacation for most universi
ties. Also, since we all know that the highest
priority for major-college football players is
their classes, no Division I school that tradi
tionally competes for the national champi
onship would ever prioritize football over
academics anyway. (Right now the Ohio
State Buckeye is sitting as still as possible
and hoping nobody notices.)
Furthermore, why don't we ask the play
ers about that? I'd be willing to bet that
every football player in America would be
willing to work his finals schedule around
two more games if it meant a shot at win
ning an undisputed national title.
What boggles my mind is that the exact
same playoff system, to some degree, al
ready exists in the form of the men's bas
ketball NCAA Tournament. Some basket
ball teams have to take three extra weeks
away from school, while the football playoff
would require only two extra weeks—and
for only two teams. Imagine the top two
basketball teams being selected by a com
puter process and then playing each other,
making virtually every other game point
less. Ridiculous, right? Yes, it is. So some
one fix this problem before I have to come
down there to Overland Park and crack
some skulls.
