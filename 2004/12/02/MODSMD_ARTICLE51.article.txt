# Why burn bridges? Hire back Tyrone
## 
### CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON 
Bang-hang.
Just hours from deadline, word came across the wires
that Notre Dame football coach Tyrone Willingham. for
merly of Stanford, had been fired. Meanwhile, word
came out yesterday that Stanford's own coach Buddy
Teevens had also been fired.
This sets up a remarkable opportunity.
Stanford needs a coach who can win. Tyrone Willing
ham needs a job. In the name of continuity, Stanford needs
a proven recruiter who knows his way around the Pac-10
Conference and the Bay Area community. Someone who
will get people excited and, critically, into the stadium.
The Cardinal need someone to continue the tradition of
class, pride, and success that marks all of Stanford athletics.
Despite Tyrone Willingham's struggles at Notre Dame,
the Double Clutch feels he still is the right man for Stan
ford football.
Notwithstanding his 21-15 Fighting Irish record, he
probably got a raw deal from Notre Dame. The 30-point
losses to Southern California were particularly horrify
ing, but let's not forget that USC is bar none the best pro
gram in college football, with the talent and schemes to
beat anybody.
Offensive coordinator Bill Diedrick is one of the top
offensive minds in college football. That he could not
build a consistently successful offense says enough about
the challenges of Notre Dame's schedule and recruiting.
Tradition casts such a shadow in South Bend that for
mer coach Lou Holtz — a legend in his own right —
stepped down in and later took the reins at peren
nial doormat South Carolina.
Holtz's replacement. Bob Davie, drew an age-dis
crimination lawsuit related to his termination of an assis
tant. As far as his record goes, let's just say that any for
mer coach working for ESPN probably didn't make the
decision to quit on his own.
In short. Notre Dame may arguably be the toughest
college job in the country.
But let not all of that distract us from the issue at
hand.
The question of bringing Tyrone Willingham back to
Stanford is obviously on any fan's mind. As it should be.
Willmuham's last three Cardinal teams won 22 games.

with a Pac-10 championship and a second-place finish,
and went to the school's first Rose Bowl in 26 years. They
produced all-conference quarterback Todd Husak,
Biletnikoff award-winning receiver Troy Walters, and
defensive tackle Willie Howard's Trench Dog defense.
They led the conference in rushing in 2001 with the one
two punch of Kerry Carter and Brian Allen.
And Willingham won all seven of his Big Games.
Counterarguments? There is little precedent of a coach
serving two tenures at the same school. And some will say
the program needs to look to the future, not the past.
But if the coach and the school are still a good fit, his
time away shouldn't be seen as a negative. Willingham
could be a stable element for the next decade and possi
bly finish his career on the Farm.
If Stanford is going to capitalize on this opportunity,
it needs to push aggressively.
Athletic director Ted Leland may well be pissed (for
lack of a better term) about Willingham's sudden depar
ture for Notre Dame in January of 2(X)2, and he is no
doubt recovering from the pain of firing his good friend.
But no one is getting any younger, least of all the players
and recruits, and the situation needs to be resolved
quickly — ideally, before the New Year.
More importantly, a Pac-10 rival — the University of
Washington — has been in the market fora coach for
more than a month. Their boosters are hungry fora big
name hire who will turn the tide of scandal, and they will
pony up dollars for him, anxious fora return to the tradi
tion of winning. (Diedrick himself was hired to Stanford
from UW.)
It's unlikely Willingham would be seen as the right
choice for, say, the Florida job. But to bring his staff back
to the West Coast, to a first-rate facility like Husky Sta
dium, might be something he takes a good look at.
It's only appropriate that Stanford employ one of the
best-known positive faces in college football. It's only ap
propriate that one of college football's class guys work for
one of the classiest athletic departments in the country.

Willingham. tell the man who needs to hear it. Send e
