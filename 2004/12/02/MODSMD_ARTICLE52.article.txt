# Game on! Time warp magic: tonight we're gonna rollerblade like it's 1993
## 
### 
So I was looking on theface
book the other day, and 1
made a startling discovery:
only 21 people list
rollerhlading as one of their inter
ests. Realizing my possible error, I

re-entered the
search term as
"roller blading"
and "inline skat
ing." End result?
Three additional
people share my
love for
rollerhlading, and
1 don't even know
how much any of
those people actu-

ally love rollerblading.
Now I'm not one to critique the
social norms of Stanford students.
After all. I indulge in my fair share of
SportsClix. and afterhours Nintendo
playing. But — I implore all Stan
ford students to step away from their
Huffy s. Razor Scooters and other
inferior forms of transportation
(The Segway Human Transporter?
HA) and to give rollerblading a
chance.
At this point, I think there arc
two rational responses for any read
ers of my column. If you are of the
female persuasion, my admission
that I enjoy rollerblading has most
likely led you to the false realization
that I am "safe". What's the hardest
part about rollerblading? Telling
your Dad you're gay.
Next, if you're a male reader of
my column, you possibly made the
decision that since I'm no longer
going to write about sports, you will
no longer read my column. Good
choice.
No. this article will not argue that
rollerblading is a sport. Even if
ESPN does prominently feature the
Yasutoko brothers, rollerblades are
a form of transportation and only
convert into sports equipment when

used during street hockey. All that
this article argues is that rollerhlad
ing is an underutilized means to trav
el around campus, which should be
embraced by people of all types (not
just huge dorks, like myself). I think
it's a sad social commentary about
the Stanford student body when the
number of people Razor Scootering
grossly outnumbers the number of
rollerbladers.
Even attempts by friends, cohorts
and associates have failed to take me
out of my 1993-1994 time warp. 1
once lost a bet when I claimed that
ball-room dancing was an Olympic
Sport. End result: I was required to
give up rollerhlading for an entire
quarter. Of course, that's like asking
post-"my childhood destiny is to be
come an NFL superstar, and my
Dad's going to do anything possible
to live vicariously through my
dreams" Todd Marinovich to step
away from the bong. It's just not
going to happen.
Back during my fifth and sixth
grade era, rollerhlading was a social
ly acceptable form of entertainment.
I remember my first pair of blades —
I had a pair of Rollerblade Tarmac,
rollerblades that were marketed as
street-oriented, aggressive in-line
skates. The Tarmacs had a grind
plate, rockered wheels, and of
course 1 removed the brake in order
to satisfy my cool quotient. The only
problem was that I had no idea how
to perform any "grinds," "stalls" or
other "tricks."
Luckily, not actually knowing
how to properly ure my aggressive
rollerblades for their true street pur
pose didn't stop me from loving
rollerhlading. or the world would
have one less rollerblader. And that,
my friends, would be a travesty on
par with Stuart Scott's recent "Poet
ry Slam" segment on Sports Center.
Enter Bill Walton: "That was hor
rrrrrrrrrrrrrrible."

And if you look at Bay Area
sports at the time, there's a reason
why it makes sense to remain in that
1993-1994 rollerblade time warp.
Prime example: the Warriors, and
eurrent coach Mike Montgomery,
who claimed that the Warriors first
victory "feels like we won the na
tional championship ... there was a
huge elephant in the living room and
it was getting bigger and bigger."
I've attempted to decipher what
Coach Montgomery means by this
statement. First off, Monty never
won an NCAA title at Stanford, so
I'm not sure what basis he has for
this claim. Second, this claim comes
on the heels of a Warriors victory
against the expansion Charlotte
Bobcats, a team predicted to win no
more than 20 games this year.
So if beating the Bobcats elicits
such a response from Monty, imag
ine what a win against the Indiana
Pacers (mark your calendars, Dec.
4th in Oakland) would feel like? Or
actually making the playoffs? I
would only imagine that Monty
would be incapable to process such
feelings. So let's all give a big thank
you to Chris Mullin for assembling
a playoff bound team like he
claimed.
Not!
Warriors aside, this column was
about rollerblading. So, go play
some street hockey. Yell "Game
Off!" And please rollerblade to
class. I'm begging you. Of course,
from numerous interviews with
Stanford students who don't
rollerblade. I found two overriding
themes: either their moms wouldn't
let them because it was too danger
ous, or the individuals don't have
enough balance. Typical Stanford.

If you think this article is totally sweet

on the heels of a Warriors victory
against the expansion Charlotte
Bobcats, a team predicted to win no
more than 20 games this year.
So if beating the Bobcats elicits
such a response from Monty, imag
ine what a win against the Indiana
Pacers (mark your calendars, Dec.
4th in Oakland) would feel like? Or
actually making the playoffs? I
would only imagine that Monty
would be incapable to process such
feelings. So let's all give a big thank
you to Chris Mullin for assembling
a playoff bound team like he
claimed.
Not!
Warriors aside, this column was
about rollerblading. So, go play
some street hockey. Yell "Game
Off!" And please rollerblade to
class. I'm begging you. Of course,
from numerous interviews with
Stanford students who don't
rollerblade. I found two overriding
themes: either their moms wouldn't
let them because it was too danger
ous, or the individuals don't have
enough balance. Typical Stanford.

So I was looking on theface
book the other day, and 1
made a startling discovery:
only 21 people list
rollerhlading as one of their inter
ests. Realizing my possible error, I

re-entered the
search term as
"roller blading"
and "inline skat
ing." End result?
Three additional
people share my
love for
rollerhlading, and
1 don't even know
how much any of
those people actu-

ally love rollerblading.
Now I'm not one to critique the
social norms of Stanford students.
After all. I indulge in my fair share of
SportsClix. and afterhours Nintendo
playing. But — I implore all Stan
ford students to step away from their
Huffy s. Razor Scooters and other
inferior forms of transportation
(The Segway Human Transporter?
HA) and to give rollerblading a
chance.
At this point, I think there arc
two rational responses for any read
ers of my column. If you are of the
female persuasion, my admission
that I enjoy rollerblading has most
likely led you to the false realization
that I am "safe". What's the hardest
part about rollerblading? Telling
your Dad you're gay.
Next, if you're a male reader of
my column, you possibly made the
decision that since I'm no longer
going to write about sports, you will
no longer read my column. Good
choice.
No. this article will not argue that
rollerblading is a sport. Even if
ESPN does prominently feature the
Yasutoko brothers, rollerblades are
a form of transportation and only
convert into sports equipment when

used during street hockey. All that
this article argues is that rollerhlad
ing is an underutilized means to trav
el around campus, which should be
embraced by people of all types (not
just huge dorks, like myself). I think
it's a sad social commentary about
the Stanford student body when the
number of people Razor Scootering
grossly outnumbers the number of
rollerbladers.
Even attempts by friends, cohorts
and associates have failed to take me
out of my 1993-1994 time warp. 1
once lost a bet when I claimed that
ball-room dancing was an Olympic
Sport. End result: I was required to
give up rollerhlading for an entire
quarter. Of course, that's like asking
post-"my childhood destiny is to be
come an NFL superstar, and my
Dad's going to do anything possible
to live vicariously through my
dreams" Todd Marinovich to step
away from the bong. It's just not
going to happen.
Back during my fifth and sixth
grade era, rollerhlading was a social
ly acceptable form of entertainment.
I remember my first pair of blades —
I had a pair of Rollerblade Tarmac,
rollerblades that were marketed as
street-oriented, aggressive in-line
skates. The Tarmacs had a grind
plate, rockered wheels, and of
course 1 removed the brake in order
to satisfy my cool quotient. The only
problem was that I had no idea how
to perform any "grinds," "stalls" or
other "tricks."
Luckily, not actually knowing
how to properly ure my aggressive
rollerblades for their true street pur
pose didn't stop me from loving
rollerhlading. or the world would
have one less rollerblader. And that,
my friends, would be a travesty on
par with Stuart Scott's recent "Poet
ry Slam" segment on Sports Center.
Enter Bill Walton: "That was hor
rrrrrrrrrrrrrrible."

And if you look at Bay Area
sports at the time, there's a reason
why it makes sense to remain in that
1993-1994 rollerblade time warp.
Prime example: the Warriors, and
eurrent coach Mike Montgomery,
who claimed that the Warriors first
victory "feels like we won the na
tional championship ... there was a
huge elephant in the living room and
it was getting bigger and bigger."
I've attempted to decipher what
Coach Montgomery means by this
statement. First off, Monty never
won an NCAA title at Stanford, so
I'm not sure what basis he has for
this claim. Second, this claim comes
on the heels of a Warriors victory
against the expansion Charlotte
Bobcats, a team predicted to win no
more than 20 games this year.
