# Card sweep Arizona schools
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team has been playing its best
volleyball of the season heading
into the NCAA Tournament. The
team showed no signs of slowing in
last weekend's trip to Arizona.
The Cardinal scorched their way
through the desert, not dropping a
single game en route to a sweep of
Arizona State (10-17, 5-13 Pacific
-10 Conference) on Friday and Ari
zona (18-10, 10-8) on Saturday.
Stanford (24-6. 15-3) finished its
regular season with a nine-match
winning streak.
The Cardinal's 8-1 surge during
the second half of conference play
won them second place in the Pac
-10, right behind No. 3 Washington
and ahead of No. 6 Southern Cali
fornia, who fell to third when the
Women of Troy were upset by
Washington State on Saturday
night.
Arizona State, which ranks in
the lower half of the Pac-10. proved
to be little competition for the Car
dinal. The Sun Devils never scored
more than 24 points in a single
game, losing to Stanford 30-16. 30-
24,30-20.
By far the most exciting and
memorable moment of the night
occurred when senior outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani put down her
eighth kill of the match in the mid
dle of the second game. While the
kill itself wasn't anything extraordi
nary, it propelled Nnamani into
first place on the all-time Pac-10 ca
reer kills list. By the end of the
night, her career kill count sat at

2,263. In addition, Nnamani broke
her own single-season record for
kills by a Stanford player.
Sophomore outside hitter Kris
ten Richards also continued to
dominate on the offensive and de
fensive sides of the ball, notching a
double-double with 12 kills and 12
digs.
The Cardinal outblocked the
Sun Devils 10-4, led by freshman
middle blocker Franci Girard. who
had four solo blocks in addition to
eight kills. The blocking and dig
ging held Arizona State to a .056
hitting percentage on the night.
Arizona was a bit more compet
itive than Arizona State, but the
Cardinal turned up their level of
play and showed an enormous de
gree of tenacity down the stretch.

After taking game one handily, 30-
16, the Cardinal had to overcome
sizable late leads to take games two
and three from the Wildcats.
In game two, the Cardinal rallied
from a five-point deficit at 22-17
and again from a three-point Wild
cat lead at 28-25 to force overtime
and eventually take the game, 33-
31. Game three was even more im
pressive, as Stanford, trailing 27-20.
scored 10 unanswered points to
take the game and match.
Senior opposite Jenn Hucke had
an all-around impressive game,
chipping in 12 kills, eight digs, and
four blocks.
Stanford, as it has done in nearly
every match this year, outblocked
the opponent, doubling up on Ari
zona, 11-5.
