# Basketball, Buddy, BCS: Jordi will talk about whatever he wants
## 
### 
I bundled up last Friday and braved the masses of
psychotic post-Thanksgiving shoppers, pushing
my way past hyperactive children and their anx
ious mothers, burly tailgaters and cane-wielding
grannies, to claim my ticket for next Saturday's Stan
ford / Michigan State basketball game at the Palace of
Auburn Hills.

It will be a tough contest against a
team that has scored over 100 points
in all of its wins this season. The Spar
tans are coming off a 50-point thrash
ing of Nicholls State and will whet
their appetites with Duke before we
come to town.
I was at Santa Clara on Sunday
night with a loud bloc of Sixth Man
enthusiasts for Stanford's final tune
up before final exams and the voy
ace east. The 10-point loss was not

the confidence booster any of us
were looking for, but it did provide some insight into
the team.
First: We can't win if we shoot 37 percent from the
field. It seemed like the Broncos wrapped our hoop in
Saran wrap, because nothing was falling except for free
throws. Stanford will need to shoot better to beat
tougher opponents.
Second: The team showed an alarming lack of fe
rocity on defense. Santa Clara got too many open looks
at the basket and way too many uncontested three
point shots.
Third: Our frontcourt is thin, and we miss the pres
ence of Justin Davis and Joe Kirchofer. If you think it
was painful to watch the pretty-boy Aryan surfer
Travis Niesen pour in 31 points and single-handedly
keep us from mounting a comeback, just wait until we
have to contain MSU's 6-11,255 lb. center, Paul Davis.
Fourth: Dan Grunfeld has successfully made the time
honored off-season transition from reserve shooting
guard to indispensable team leader. Following in the
footsteps of Matt Lottich. who became The Man when
Casey left. Dan is now the offensive go-to guy. Just look
at his numbers: 8-11 from the field, 9-9 from the line.
Fifth: Trent Johnson has yet to convince me that the
team trusts his system. I think he is an excellent bas
ketball coach, but I think the players still need time to
adjust to his style, and it will be awhile before we see
results. I especially would have liked to see him call a
timeout during Santa Clara's 12-3 second half run to
try and stop its momentum. It was eerily reminiscent of
Steve Fisher letting the Fab Five play themselves into
countless defeats in the early nineties.
Beware: Random subject change. That's right, it's
my column. I can do whatever I want. (Biter's rets:
Almost anything.)
So speaking of coaches. Buddy Teevens is no longer
with us at Stanford. There have been many loud voic

es calling for his removal for some time now. Anyone
who has watched the team's decline since the depar
ture of Tyrone Willingham will agree that it was neces
sary to close this chapter of Stanford football.
From all reports I've read, Teevens is a very nice
man. The football program has been scandal-free dur
ing a stretch where incidents at Colorado, Ohio State
and elsewhere have thrown a harsh light on the high
stakes reality of college football. He should be com
mended for developing fine student athletes and up
standing young men.
His job, however, was to win football games.
Teevens was 10-23 in his tenure at Stanford, only
marginally better than his 10-45 record during his stint
at Tulane from 1992-1996.
Quick trivia break: In his eight years as a Division I
head coach, what is Teevens' record in the final three
games of a season?
0-24.
Oh and twenty-four.
Not once in his career as a top-level coach has
Buddy been able to win at the end of the season. This
type of streak is not the result of unimaginative play
calling, poor execution, clock mismanagement, or
tough opposition. It's a direct reflection of Teevens'
failure to motivate his team. Every year that he has
been at the helm, his players have lost the will to win as
November rolled around. Great programs turn up the
intensity for the home stretch. Hopefully things will
change with new leadership in place.
How long can we expect to wait?
If it's any comfort, two years after Teevens was fired
from Tulane, new coach Tommy Bowden led the same
group of Green Wave players to a 12-0 record. I don't
know if we will see that dramatic a turnaround on the
Farm — it all depends on who replaces Buddy.
Since we're on the subject of college football, can
someone please explain to me how a mediocre team like
Pitta —a team that needed overtime to beat tiny Furman
College, lost to Connecticut and barely escaped Temple
— can be headed to the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl? I know
that the Big East gets an automatic BCS bid, but with
Virginia Tech and Miami gone to the ACC the confer
ence has become a cesspool of mediocrity. Four teams
finished with identically average 4-2 records. Pitt just
happens to hold the tiebreak advantage.
The worst part is that national powerhouses like Cal
and Texas will likely not play in one of the four BCS
bowls. The logjam of undefeated mid-majors and top
Div. I programs has overloaded the at-large bid sys
tem, and the big losers are teams that deserve to play in
the national spotlight. It doesn't seem fair that the sys
tem in place to simulate a post-season tournament will
leave so many top teams out of the mix
