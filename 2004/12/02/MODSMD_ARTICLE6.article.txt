# Cardinal Care insufficient in graduate student health coverage
## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The University-offered Cardinal
Care insurance plan is inadequate
because it does not offer dental or vi
sion coverage, according to the
Graduate Health Care Task Force, a
student group founded in 2(K) 1 to ex
amine the most cost-effective health
care options for graduate students.
Dr. Ira Friedman, director of the
Vaden Health Center, said that
Stanford does not include full dental
or vision insurance coverage in Car
dinal Care, but he added that he be
lieves the increase in price would
outweigh the benefits of adding
these options.
"We have been advocating for
Stanford to offer dental and vision
plans, even if there is a marginal in
crease in costs," Ray Rivera, educa
tion Ph.D. student and co-founder of
the task force. Members of the task
force also sav they are concerned

about how rising healthcare costs
could impact Stanford students.
According to a 2(K)3 survey of
1.167 graduate students that the task
force published in June of this year,
students would be willing to pay
more for Cardinal Care if it had a
dental and vision option. Approxi
mately one-third of the students sur
veyed said that they would be willing
to pay an increase of $50 or more for
Cardinal Care if it included a dental
plan, while another third said they
would be willing to pay an increase
of$15.
"Cardinal Care does not include
specific dental or vision insurance
coverage for dental fillings or treat
ments or eyeglasses, lenses, frames
or contacts," Friedman said. "These
expensive coverages tend to be be
yond students' budgets and when all
is said and done, don't give a lot of
benefits for the price."

However, according to Friedman,
Stanford does offer some limited dental
and vision insurance coverage.
"Cardinal Care includes coverage for
injuries to natural teeth," he said. "There
is an optional general dental discount
plan that can be purchased by a student
for $4K per year. Cardinal Care also in
cludes one vision examination yearly, by
referral from Vaden, with an authorized
provider."
Rivera said that many students are
not aware of these options. The survey
showed that 61 percent of students have
not had a vision checkup in the past year
and that 17 percent have not had a dental
checkup in the past two years.
"This is a large problem since it is gen
erally recommended to get checkups
every six months," said medical student
Lisa Wong, a co-founder of the task

force.
According to the task force, a lack of
adequate dental and vision care is not the
only problem facing Stanford students'
health care needs.
"Health care costs are increasing at
double digit rates for every one in the
United States," Rivera said. "Although
Stanford has been able to control health
care rates better than other universities,
we still have to look hard about what
benefits we want and how much we are
willing to pay for them."
Friedman said the cost of Cardinal
Care increased by 19 percent for the
2004-2005 academic year; whereas the
previous year there was a 17 percent in
crease in costs.
The task force has been meeting with
senior administration officials, including
University President John Hennessy, and

the Vaden Insurance Advisory Commit
tee to find a way to give students the best
benefits for the least amount of money. It
is currently working on figuring out vari
ous ways to rework Cardinal Care and the
exact costs and benefits of each solution.
"We look at a cost versus benefits
analysis to figure out which of our rec
ommendations are feasible for the Uni
versity and for students," said Maria
Elena Gonzales, sociology PhD student
and Task Force member.
One of the major problems in acquir
ing good health care, according to task
force members, is Stanford's geographic
location.
"We are in one of the most expensive
places to get health care and there are not
a lot of health care vendors in the area,"
Rivera said
Friedman agreed that Stanford's ex

pensive location is a problem when it
comes to health care costs.
"Some of the biggest cost drivers
these days are insurance fees paid to hos
pitals for inpatient and outpatient care,"
he said. "We live in an area where these
are very expensive."
Both Friedman and the Task Force
agree that health care costs are rising na
tionwide and Stanford has to work to
keep costs within reach for students.
"Cardinal Care has very comprehen
sive benefits, but soon we may not be
able to afford all of the benefits students
currently enjoy," Friedman said. "Stu
dents and administrators need to work
together to clarify which benefits are
most desired, and how much students
and the University each are willing and
able to contribute."

"Health care costs are increasing at
double digit rates for every one in the
United States," Rivera said. "Although
Stanford has been able to control health
care rates better than other universities,
we still have to look hard about what
benefits we want and how much we are
willing to pay for them."
Friedman said the cost of Cardinal
Care increased by 19 percent for the
2004-2005 academic year; whereas the
previous year there was a 17 percent in
crease in costs.
The task force has been meeting with
senior administration officials, including
University President John Hennessy, and

the Vaden Insurance Advisory Commit
tee to find a way to give students the best
benefits for the least amount of money. It
is currently working on figuring out vari
ous ways to rework Cardinal Care and the
exact costs and benefits of each solution.
"We look at a cost versus benefits
analysis to figure out which of our rec
ommendations are feasible for the Uni
versity and for students," said Maria
Elena Gonzales, sociology PhD student
and Task Force member.
One of the major problems in acquir
ing good health care, according to task
force members, is Stanford's geographic
location.
"We are in one of the most expensive
places to get health care and there are not
a lot of health care vendors in the area,"
Rivera said
Friedman agreed that Stanford's ex

pensive location is a problem when it
comes to health care costs.
"Some of the biggest cost drivers
these days are insurance fees paid to hos
pitals for inpatient and outpatient care,"
he said. "We live in an area where these
are very expensive."
Both Friedman and the Task Force
agree that health care costs are rising na
tionwide and Stanford has to work to
keep costs within reach for students.
"Cardinal Care has very comprehen
sive benefits, but soon we may not be
able to afford all of the benefits students
currently enjoy," Friedman said. "Stu
dents and administrators need to work
together to clarify which benefits are
most desired, and how much students
and the University each are willing and
able to contribute."

The University-offered Cardinal
Care insurance plan is inadequate
because it does not offer dental or vi
sion coverage, according to the
Graduate Health Care Task Force, a
student group founded in 2(K) 1 to ex
amine the most cost-effective health
care options for graduate students.
Dr. Ira Friedman, director of the
Vaden Health Center, said that
Stanford does not include full dental
or vision insurance coverage in Car
dinal Care, but he added that he be
lieves the increase in price would
outweigh the benefits of adding
these options.
"We have been advocating for
Stanford to offer dental and vision
plans, even if there is a marginal in
crease in costs," Ray Rivera, educa
tion Ph.D. student and co-founder of
the task force. Members of the task
force also sav they are concerned

about how rising healthcare costs
could impact Stanford students.
According to a 2(K)3 survey of
1.167 graduate students that the task
force published in June of this year,
students would be willing to pay
more for Cardinal Care if it had a
dental and vision option. Approxi
mately one-third of the students sur
veyed said that they would be willing
to pay an increase of $50 or more for
Cardinal Care if it included a dental
plan, while another third said they
would be willing to pay an increase
of$15.
"Cardinal Care does not include
specific dental or vision insurance
coverage for dental fillings or treat
ments or eyeglasses, lenses, frames
or contacts," Friedman said. "These
expensive coverages tend to be be
yond students' budgets and when all
is said and done, don't give a lot of
benefits for the price."

Grad students bemoan 19 percent jump in Cardinal Care costs

However, according to Friedman,
Stanford does offer some limited dental
and vision insurance coverage.
"Cardinal Care includes coverage for
injuries to natural teeth," he said. "There
is an optional general dental discount
plan that can be purchased by a student
for $4K per year. Cardinal Care also in
cludes one vision examination yearly, by
referral from Vaden, with an authorized
provider."
Rivera said that many students are
not aware of these options. The survey
showed that 61 percent of students have
not had a vision checkup in the past year
and that 17 percent have not had a dental
checkup in the past two years.
"This is a large problem since it is gen
erally recommended to get checkups
every six months," said medical student
Lisa Wong, a co-founder of the task

force.
According to the task force, a lack of
adequate dental and vision care is not the
only problem facing Stanford students'
health care needs.
"Health care costs are increasing at
double digit rates for every one in the
United States," Rivera said. "Although
Stanford has been able to control health
care rates better than other universities,
we still have to look hard about what
benefits we want and how much we are
willing to pay for them."
