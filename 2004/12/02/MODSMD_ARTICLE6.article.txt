# Cardinal Care insufficient in graduate student health coverage

The University-offered Cardinal
Care insurance plan is inadequate
because it does not offer dental or vi
sion coverage, according to the
Graduate Health Care Task Force, a
student group founded in 2(K) 1 to ex
amine the most cost-effective health
care options for graduate students.
Dr. Ira Friedman, director of the
Vaden Health Center, said that
Stanford does not include full dental
or vision insurance coverage in Car
dinal Care, but he added that he be
lieves the increase in price would
outweigh the benefits of adding
these options.
"We have been advocating for
Stanford to offer dental and vision
plans, even if there is a marginal in
crease in costs," Ray Rivera, educa
tion Ph.D. student and co-founder of
the task force. Members of the task
force also sav they are concerned

about how rising healthcare costs
could impact Stanford students.
According to a 2(K)3 survey of
1.167 graduate students that the task
force published in June of this year,
students would be willing to pay
more for Cardinal Care if it had a
dental and vision option. Approxi
mately one-third of the students sur
veyed said that they would be willing
to pay an increase of $50 or more for
Cardinal Care if it included a dental
plan, while another third said they
would be willing to pay an increase
of$15.
"Cardinal Care does not include
specific dental or vision insurance
coverage for dental fillings or treat
ments or eyeglasses, lenses, frames
or contacts," Friedman said. "These
expensive coverages tend to be be
yond students' budgets and when all
is said and done, don't give a lot of
benefits for the price."
