Federal Pell Grant recipients
may soon be sent into a pell-mell.
Congress passed a bill on Nov. 20
that will increase Pell Grant funding
by approximately $458 million to
$12.4 billion, which will not meet the
growing demand for the program.
According to the financial aid offi

additional aid in the event that a stu

Grants. As a result, the American
Council on Education estimates that
90.000 low-income college students
will lose their grants in the 2005-06
school year. Over 1 million others
will face Pell Grant reductions.
Students still eligible for the full

Pell Grant will not see an increase in
their aid despite rising tuition costs,
adding to the dissatisfaction with the
new spending hill.
"It's disappointing that the maxi
mum wasn't increased," wrote
Karen Cooper, the Associate Dean
and Director of Financial Aid, in an
e-mail to The Daily. "What is of
even greater concern is that the U.S.
Department of Education has been
given the ability to make changes to
the needs analysis formula used to
determine eligibility for Pell Grant
and other federal aid like the
Stafford Loan. These changes that
are being proposed would have the
effect of increasing expected parent
contributions, which would decrease
eligibility for need-based aid."
Daniel Kaufman, a spokesman
for the National Education Associa

less valuable to recipients than in
decades past.
"Even those students who contin
