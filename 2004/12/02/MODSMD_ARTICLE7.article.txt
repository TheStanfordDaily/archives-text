# Pell Grants subject to new reductions
## 
### JENNY ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Federal Pell Grant recipients
may soon be sent into a pell-mell.
Congress passed a bill on Nov. 20
that will increase Pell Grant funding
by approximately $458 million to
$12.4 billion, which will not meet the
growing demand for the program.
According to the financial aid offi
cer. however, Stanford can provide
additional aid in the event that a stu
dent's Pell Grant is reduced or elim
inated.
According to a Nov. 23 press re
lease from the California Student
Public Interest Research Group
(CALPIRG), the spending bill will
force the Department of Education
to change the formula used to calcu
late student eligibility for Pell
Grants. As a result, the American
Council on Education estimates that
90.000 low-income college students
will lose their grants in the 2005-06
school year. Over 1 million others
will face Pell Grant reductions.
Students still eligible for the full

Pell Grant will not see an increase in
their aid despite rising tuition costs,
adding to the dissatisfaction with the
new spending hill.
"It's disappointing that the maxi
mum wasn't increased," wrote
Karen Cooper, the Associate Dean
and Director of Financial Aid, in an
e-mail to The Daily. "What is of
even greater concern is that the U.S.
Department of Education has been
given the ability to make changes to
the needs analysis formula used to
determine eligibility for Pell Grant
and other federal aid like the
Stafford Loan. These changes that
are being proposed would have the
effect of increasing expected parent
contributions, which would decrease
eligibility for need-based aid."
Daniel Kaufman, a spokesman
for the National Education Associa
tion, agreed, adding that the award is
less valuable to recipients than in
decades past.
"Even those students who contin
ue to receive the maximum Pell
Cuts unlikely to affect
Stanford students

Grant award of $4,050 are worse and worse off
because consistently rising tuition and other costs
are eroding the value of these awards," he said.
"Decades ago. Fell Grants and other federal
grant aid used to cover most or all of the cost of a
four-year college education, but now they only
cover a portion."
Four consecutive years of tuition increases at
public universities in California is creating an ad
ditional burden for families, complain students
and educators.
"Students and their families at colleges and
universities across the country are already strug
gling to pay skyrocketing tuition costs and soar
ing fees just as financial aid resources are declin
ing," Kaufman said. "Now this unfortunate
change by the Bush administration and Congress
will make it even harder for those of modest
means to pay for school, which will force students
to take out more loans, work longer hours, take
off semesters, or even drop out of school entire
ly"
Meanwhile, Stanford students' financial aid
packages are unlikely to be affected by changes to
the Pell Grant.
"Students at Stanford are in part sheltered
from these proposed changes because of our poli
cies," Cooper said. "If Fell Grant funds, for ex
ample, aren't available to help meet the need of a
particular student, we will make up the difference
with institutional funds. Unfortunately, reduced
federal funds for individual students could poten
tially have a negative impact on our institutional
scholarship budget and we could potentially see
an increase in the self-help expectation for all stu
dents. I don't think that is likely at this point. We
also use a different formula, called Institutional
Methodology, to calculate the expected parent

contributions our students see on their award let
ters."
Kaufman agreed that students from wealthier
schools would he less affected by the recent
changes.
"Students who go to private colleges and uni
versities with large endowments like Stanford
will generally be better off than those who attend
public institutions who depend on state and fed
eral aid," he said. "When you also take into ac
count that private foundations have less scholar
ship money available and more and more stu
dents from lower-income families are attending
college, this change to the Fell Grant formula is
worsening a 'perfect storm' of college costs."
Senior Dayna Mu-iz, who received a Pell
Grant for the 2004-05 school year, agreed.
"1 think that this change in the Pell Grant
funding scheme will greatly hurt students, partic
ularly those at smaller schools and state schools,
given that those schools have smaller endow
ments and resources to compensate for lost fed
eral aid," she said.
The Pell Grant program is the United States
largest source of federal financial aid for college
students. According to The Student Guide pro
vided by the U.S. Department of Education, Fed
eral Pell Grants are financial aid awards for un
dergraduates who have not yet received a bache
lor or graduate degree. Graduate students at
tending a post-baccalaureate teacher certificate
program may also be eligible. Based on financial
need calculated using a student's Expected Fam
ily Contribution, cost of university attendance,
length of time attending, and part-time or full
time enrollment status, students may be eligible
for up to $4,050 for both the 2004-2005 and 2005-
2006 academic vears.

"It's disappointing that the maxi
mum wasn't increased," wrote
Karen Cooper, the Associate Dean
and Director of Financial Aid, in an
e-mail to The Daily. "What is of
even greater concern is that the U.S.
Department of Education has been
given the ability to make changes to
the needs analysis formula used to
determine eligibility for Pell Grant
and other federal aid like the
Stafford Loan. These changes that
are being proposed would have the
effect of increasing expected parent
contributions, which would decrease
eligibility for need-based aid."
Daniel Kaufman, a spokesman
for the National Education Associa
tion, agreed, adding that the award is
less valuable to recipients than in
decades past.
"Even those students who contin

Grant award of $4,050 are worse and worse off
because consistently rising tuition and other costs
are eroding the value of these awards," he said.
"Decades ago. Fell Grants and other federal
grant aid used to cover most or all of the cost of a
four-year college education, but now they only
cover a portion."
Four consecutive years of tuition increases at
public universities in California is creating an ad
ditional burden for families, complain students
and educators.
"Students and their families at colleges and
universities across the country are already strug
gling to pay skyrocketing tuition costs and soar
ing fees just as financial aid resources are declin
ing," Kaufman said. "Now this unfortunate
change by the Bush administration and Congress
will make it even harder for those of modest
means to pay for school, which will force students
to take out more loans, work longer hours, take
off semesters, or even drop out of school entire
ly"
Meanwhile, Stanford students' financial aid
packages are unlikely to be affected by changes to
the Pell Grant.
"Students at Stanford are in part sheltered
from these proposed changes because of our poli
cies," Cooper said. "If Fell Grant funds, for ex
ample, aren't available to help meet the need of a
particular student, we will make up the difference
with institutional funds. Unfortunately, reduced
federal funds for individual students could poten
tially have a negative impact on our institutional
scholarship budget and we could potentially see
an increase in the self-help expectation for all stu
dents. I don't think that is likely at this point. We
also use a different formula, called Institutional
Methodology, to calculate the expected parent

contributions our students see on their award let
ters."
Kaufman agreed that students from wealthier
schools would he less affected by the recent
changes.
"Students who go to private colleges and uni
versities with large endowments like Stanford
will generally be better off than those who attend
public institutions who depend on state and fed
eral aid," he said. "When you also take into ac
count that private foundations have less scholar
ship money available and more and more stu
dents from lower-income families are attending
college, this change to the Fell Grant formula is
worsening a 'perfect storm' of college costs."
Senior Dayna Mu-iz, who received a Pell
Grant for the 2004-05 school year, agreed.
"1 think that this change in the Pell Grant
funding scheme will greatly hurt students, partic
ularly those at smaller schools and state schools,
given that those schools have smaller endow
ments and resources to compensate for lost fed
eral aid," she said.
The Pell Grant program is the United States
largest source of federal financial aid for college
students. According to The Student Guide pro
vided by the U.S. Department of Education, Fed
eral Pell Grants are financial aid awards for un
dergraduates who have not yet received a bache
lor or graduate degree. Graduate students at
tending a post-baccalaureate teacher certificate
program may also be eligible. Based on financial
need calculated using a student's Expected Fam
ily Contribution, cost of university attendance,
length of time attending, and part-time or full
time enrollment status, students may be eligible
for up to $4,050 for both the 2004-2005 and 2005-
2006 academic vears.
Federal Pell Grant recipients
may soon be sent into a pell-mell.
Congress passed a bill on Nov. 20
that will increase Pell Grant funding
by approximately $458 million to
$12.4 billion, which will not meet the
growing demand for the program.
According to the financial aid offi
cer. however, Stanford can provide
additional aid in the event that a stu
dent's Pell Grant is reduced or elim
inated.
According to a Nov. 23 press re
lease from the California Student
Public Interest Research Group
(CALPIRG), the spending bill will
force the Department of Education
to change the formula used to calcu
late student eligibility for Pell
Grants. As a result, the American
Council on Education estimates that
90.000 low-income college students
will lose their grants in the 2005-06
school year. Over 1 million others
will face Pell Grant reductions.
Students still eligible for the full

Pell Grant will not see an increase in
their aid despite rising tuition costs,
adding to the dissatisfaction with the
new spending hill.
