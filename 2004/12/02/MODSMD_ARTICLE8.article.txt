# Inspectors come knocking at dorms
## 
### NICK PARKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When senior Albert Chan
found out last summer that Stu
dent Housing Services had fined
him more than $70 fora scribbled
math problem on the wall of his
Columbae dorm room, he
thought it was an error.
"1 thought for sure it was a
mistake," he said. "1 had no idea 1
would have to pay so much fora
little writing on my wall."
Every year. Housing Services
inspects dorm rooms over winter,
spring and summer breaks, fining
students for damages and infrac
tions of housing rules.
If a student is found to have
candles, lighters, or halogen
lamps in his room — all consid
ered fire hazards by Housing Ser
vices— he or she is fined $100

per item upon discovery and $100
per item per day until it is re
moved.
Many students feel the pun
ishments imposed by Housing
Services do not fit the crimes.
"I think [the fines] are exces
sive," Chan said. "Some of them
are too big for such small offens
es."
Manager of Undergraduate
Housing Operations Imogen
Hinds, who oversees the housing
inspection process, defended the
pricey fines.
"Fines that are put in place for
specific health and life-safety vio
lations, for instance having can
dles, are done in consultation
with the campus Fire Marshall's
office," she said. "The amount of
the fine has purposely been set at
Damaged carpets, walls
top causes for fines

a high rate to demonstrate that
this infraction of policy is a seri
ous life-safety issue and to make
it a deterrent."
Hinds added that money col
lected from fire hazard viola
tions goes toward specific Hous
ing Services programs.
"Fines that are collected are
used toward helping Student
Housing provide programming
to further educate residents on
issues of life-safety," she said.
Student Housing also in
spects rooms for damage to fur
niture during inspections. A
damaged desk brings a $530
fine, while a broken room win
dow costs students $280. The
fines for carpet stains vary be
tween $50 and $100, depending
on the size of the spot and the
severity of the damage.
Hinds said that Student
Housing hands out relatively

few fines for prohibited items
like candles and halogen lamps,
adding that damages to room
walls, carpeting and furniture
are more common. Student
Housing does not profit from
fines resulting from room dam
age, she added, explaining that
all of that money is used to re
pair or replace broken and dam
aged items.
According to Hinds, Hous
ing Services inspects all under
graduate rooms over winter,
spring and summer breaks, but
some students speculate other
wise.
Seniors Josh Seifert and
Schuyler Ullman discovered
this first-hand last year, when
Housing Services failed to
search their room in Granada
over winter break.
The two roommates placed
individually wrapped sugar

cookies on a chair in their room
with a note asking the Housing
Services inspector who would
search their room to take the
cookies as a gift and wishing
him or her a happy holiday sea
son.
"[The cookies] couldn't be
missed, and the chair would
have had to have been moved
out of the way for any sort of in
spection," Seifert said. "Well,
let me tell you, Schuyler and I
were shocked to discover that
they (the cookies and note)
hadn't been touched after three
weeks of break."
"We also found no paper
work to notify us of inspection,"
he added. "So to keep our feel
ings from being hurt at having
our gift soundly rejected, we
concluded that no inspection
had taken place."
