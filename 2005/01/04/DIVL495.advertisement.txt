"Originally, scientists' research methodologies were
theory and experiment," said ICME Director Parviz
Mom, the Franklin P. and Caroline M. Johnson
Professor in the School of Engineering. "Computing
now forms the third leg of a stool for scientific discov
ery and prediction and for studying the performance
and behavior of physical systems"
Jim Plummer, the Frederick Emmons Terman Dean
of the School of Engineering, said the use
of computers to model, simulate, design and
synthesize is key to most engineered systems today.
"From airplanes to semiconductor chips to new drugs,
engineers today create these products by designing
them using computer tools," he said. "ICME is aimed
at providing a world-class education for all of our
engineering students in these important fields. It is
also aimed at helping us build research programs
aimed at solving some of the grand-challenge prob
lems of our day."
"It is heartening to see the development of such a
magnet for intellectual talent that is aligned with
problems of national interest," wrote Dimitri F.
Kusnezov, director of the Office of Advanced
Simulation and Computing at the U.S. Department
of Energy, in a letter congratulating Stanford on the
new institute.
