Interested in learning about social justice movements that occurred throughout the 20th Century, and current NGO efforts to effect pos
itive social change? Would you like to explore what inspired Martin Luther King, Jr., Cesar Chavez, Rosa Parks, Gandhi, and others
engaged in activism rooted in spiritual and religious commitments? Using case studies of these and other nonviolent agents for social
change, this service-learning course will consider the religious and spiritual underpinnings of nonviolence, the streams that fed major
nonviolent activists, and the philosophers and theologians who influenced them. Through films and texts, the course will address how
individuals and communities can be effective in bringing about social change, and how to stay buoyant over time while engaged in social
transformation. Offered by the Deans for Religious Life, the class includes student placement in Bay Area organizations engaged in non
violent social justice work. Limited Enrollment. Films: Students are expected to watch about one film/week.
