The Psychology of
Dominant Group Identity
and the Experience of Privilege
INSTRUCTOR: BRIAN LOWERY
TUESDAYS, 2:1 5-4:3OPM
Bldg. 60-6 IF
This course explores how members of dominant groups experience their group
identity. In particular we will examine how the experience of the self as a domi
nant group member (e.g. male or White) motivates choices and behaviors that
may perpetuate social inequality, even in the absence of negative stereotypes or
prejudice against less powerful groups. This course is intended for advanced
undergraduate and graduate students interested in the psychological experience
of social privilege and its sociological antecedents and consequences.
