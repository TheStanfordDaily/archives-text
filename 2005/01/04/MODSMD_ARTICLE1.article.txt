## Volleyball wins tourney 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At the beginning of Stan
ford's volleyball season, even
the players and coaches did not
think a championship was in the
cards. With a freshman setter,
two young and largely untried
middle blockers, and a star re
turning from an eight-month ab
sence, the term "rebuilding
year" was heard more than
once.
But the Cardinal silenced
their early critics with a strong
run late in the season. After a
Halloween loss to California left
Stanford with a less-than-stellar
15-6 record, the team suddenly
stopped losing, putting together
a 15-match winning streak that
culminated in Stanford's record
sixth national championship on
Dec. 18. Over the course of that
streak, the Cardinal dropped
only seven games, recording 11
sweeps.
Senior outside hitter Ogonna
Nnamani. returning to the Farm
after significant playing time in
the Athens Olympics, had a stel
lar season and was amply re
warded. She was named Ameri
can Volleyball Coaches Associ
ation co-Player of the Year,
sharing the top honor fora col
legiate volleyball player with
Stacey Gordon of Ohio State.
Nnamani was also honored as

NCAA Tournament Most Out
standing Player, Green Bay Re
gional Most Outstanding Play
er, Pacific-10 Conference Player
of the Year, AVCA All-Ameri
can, NCAA Today's Top VIII
Award Recipient, ESPN the
Magazine's Academic All-
American of the Year, four
time Pac-10 Player of the Week,
Sports Imports/AVCA Nation
al Player of the Week and
CVU.com National Player of
the Week.
With Nnamani at the helm,
the Cardinal rolled through the
second half of Pac-10 play, in
cluding an unexpected sweep of
USC and a miraculous come
from-behind victory over then
undefeated Washington. De
spite a disappointing eleventh
seed. No. 6 Stanford entered the
NCAA tournament with great
momentum.
After a 3-0 sweep of the Jack
sonville Dolphins and a hard
fought 3-2 victory over the
Florida Gators, Stanford head
ed to Green Bay, Wisconsin for
regional play. With a pair of 3-0
victories over Texas and Wis
consin, the Cardinal earned a
spot in Long Beach for the Final
Four, alongside defending
champions USC, familiar foe
Washington, and Big 10 power
house Minnesota.
