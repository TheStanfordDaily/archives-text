## Volleyball wins tourney 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At the beginning of Stan
ford's volleyball season, even
the players and coaches did not
think a championship was in the
cards. With a freshman setter,
two young and largely untried
middle blockers, and a star re
turning from an eight-month ab
sence, the term "rebuilding
year" was heard more than
once.
But the Cardinal silenced
their early critics with a strong
run late in the season. After a
Halloween loss to California left
Stanford with a less-than-stellar
15-6 record, the team suddenly
stopped losing, putting together
a 15-match winning streak that
culminated in Stanford's record
sixth national championship on
Dec. 18. Over the course of that
streak, the Cardinal dropped
only seven games, recording 11
sweeps.
Senior outside hitter Ogonna
Nnamani. returning to the Farm
after significant playing time in
the Athens Olympics, had a stel
lar season and was amply re
warded. She was named Ameri
can Volleyball Coaches Associ
ation co-Player of the Year,
sharing the top honor fora col
legiate volleyball player with
Stacey Gordon of Ohio State.
Nnamani was also honored as

NCAA Tournament Most Out
standing Player, Green Bay Re
gional Most Outstanding Play
er, Pacific-10 Conference Player
of the Year, AVCA All-Ameri
can, NCAA Today's Top VIII
Award Recipient, ESPN the
Magazine's Academic All-
American of the Year, four
time Pac-10 Player of the Week,
Sports Imports/AVCA Nation
al Player of the Week and
CVU.com National Player of
the Week.
With Nnamani at the helm,
the Cardinal rolled through the
second half of Pac-10 play, in
cluding an unexpected sweep of
USC and a miraculous come
from-behind victory over then
undefeated Washington. De
spite a disappointing eleventh
seed. No. 6 Stanford entered the
NCAA tournament with great
momentum.
After a 3-0 sweep of the Jack
sonville Dolphins and a hard
fought 3-2 victory over the
Florida Gators, Stanford head
ed to Green Bay, Wisconsin for
regional play. With a pair of 3-0
victories over Texas and Wis
consin, the Cardinal earned a
spot in Long Beach for the Final
Four, alongside defending
champions USC, familiar foe
Washington, and Big 10 power
house Minnesota.

Senior Ogonna Nnamani throws it down against Cal. Nnamani
led the Cardinal to a 3-0 victory over Minnesota last month.
Though Washington had re
ceived the conference's highest
seeding at seventh, three teams
from the Pac-10 reached the Final
Four in what had been called a
"down year" on the West Coast.
Nnamani outdid herself in
Green Bay. swatting 28 kills against
Texas and 27 against Wisconsin,
while averaging almost 10 kills per
game, well above her season aver
age.
In Long Beach, she continued to
lead the way with 33 kills as Stan
ford advanced to the national
championship match with a 3-1 vic
tory over Washington, the Cardi
nal's second win over the Huskies
this season and only Washington's
third loss overall.
Minnesota also posted a 3-1 victory,
overpowering a surprisingly slug
gish USC team to set up the final
match-up.
It was clear early on that the
Golden Gophers would be no
match fora determined and ener
getic Stanford squad. The Cardinal
had not lost in a month and a half
and were not going to allow that
streak to end in the most important
match of the season.
Helped by some of Nnamani's
best hitting of the season and sever
al strong supporting performances,
the Cardinal became national
champions with a 30-23, 30-27, 30-
21 sweep of Minnesota.
Nnamani made only two hitting
errors in the match, the first of
which did not come until the middle
of game two. Only one tip into the
net and another tip that was
blocked marred a 29-kill perfor
mance. Hitting at a .562 clip, she
added four digs and a powerful

block.
Nol at all surprisingly, Nnamani
was named Most Outstanding Flay
er of the Tournament. Joining her
on the All-Tournament team were
fellow senior Jennifer Hucke (nine
kills, four assists, three digs, two
blocks), sophomore outside hitter
Kristin Richards (eight kills, 11
digs, three blocks), and freshman
setter Bryn Kehoe (48 assists, 10
digs, one ace, two blocks).
Kehoe became the first fresh
man setter in NCAA history to lead
her team to a national champi
onship.
The rest of the lineup also had
strong performances as sophomore
middle blocker Lizzie Suiter posted
six kills and five blocks and fresh
man middle Franci Ciirard had five
kills and a block. Libero Courtney
Schultz had 14 digs to lead the team.
Minnesota had several offensive
contributors, with four players tal
lying at least nine kills. Setter Lind
say Taatjes had five blocks and mid
dle Jessy Jones had four, hut the
Golden Gophers could not stop
Nnamani.
Libero Paula Gentil was tena
cious on defense with 15 digs, but
went out with a neck injury early in
the third game. With her on the
bench, Minnesota was even more
powerless against Stanford's big
hitting.
What started out as a weak year
for Stanford ended with record-set
ting performances in every area.
Nnamani obliterated her own sin
gle-season kills record on the Farm,
finishing with 823, a Pac-10 record
and the seventh-highest total in
NCAA history. With 2,450 kills,she
also broke the Stanford and Pac-10

Card team sets several
season records

career records. Her 145 kills and 15
solo blocks in the postseason are
both NCAA records.
Kristin Richards broke the sin
gle-season digs record on the Farm
with 502. Lizzie Suiter's 198 total
blocks put her second in Stanford
history and sixth in the Pac-10 in a
season. Hryn Kehoe's 1.637 assists
were good fora Stanford record as
well.
The national championship
match marked the end of the colle
giate careers of three Cardinal play
ers: Nnamani. Hucke, and defen
sive specialist Leahi Hall.
Hucke had the best season of her
career as the opposite hitter. She
finished third on the team in kills
with 34X to go along with assists,
278 digs, and 109 blocks.
Hall, hampered by injury for
much of the first half of the season,
played a key role in tight games for
the Cardinal, coming off the bench
to contribute 10 aces and 116 digs.
Though it will be hard to replace
the graduating players, the rest of
the squad will return, joined by red
shirt Candice Wiggins, who is cur
rently starring for the women's bas
ketball team.
Stanford also brings in one of the
best recruiting classes in the coun
try next fall, including top recruit
Cynthia Barboza, who will bring ex
perience from her leadership at
Long Beach Wilson High School
and her role as first alternate on the
Olympic squad last summer.
While it would be hard to repli
cate this amazing turnaround sea
son and against-the-odds champi
onship. next year's Cardinal volley
ball team will be ready to defend its
title.
