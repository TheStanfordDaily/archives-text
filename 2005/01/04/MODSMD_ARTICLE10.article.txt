On Jan. 4,1939, The Daily ran a story
about three Stanford students who
participated in a debate with three
convicts from San Quentin prison.
Below the story:
"Above the choppy, slate-grey
waters of San Franciscoi's north bay
looms the massive stone hulk of San
Quentin prison. Like a medieval
French chateau its corniced walls
dominate the tidelands, stand in
sharp outline against the rolling,
green Sausalito hills.
Each year the heavy menacing
gates swing on friendly hinges to
admit three Stanford debaters and
Varsity Coach Leland Chapin.
Last month so traveled Sherman
Mellinkoff, Stan Anderson, and Sid
ney Terry, representing the yearfs
squad. Proposing an Anglo-Ameri
can peace pact to outlaw war, the
Farm trio, before an audience of 500
trusties, was pitted against three of
San Quentims best arguers.
Out in the grim, sunny reception
room, while prisoners talked across
guarded tables with sad-eyed rela
tives,. Dr. H. A. Shuder, prison di
rector of education, greeted the
Stanfordites, invited them in.
Stepping through a heavily
barred gate, the men found them
selves in a carefully landscaped
courtyard, crossed by low fences and
neatly swept paths. Loosely formed
lines of men passed quickly in single
file.
In the glass-enclosed office of Di
rector Shuder, the Farm men shook
hands with the courteous, miid-man
nered San Quentin convicts, who
were to meet them on the platform.
Lines of curious prisoners barely

paused to 'ogle' football-player An
derson, as San Quentin newspaper
editor later expressed it.
Upstairs in the low-ceilinged
room one debater after another
stood before the public address mi
crophone, defined the question,
pleaded its merits or condemned its
vices.
Now and then, a good-humored
stir moved the attentive audience as
they heard a convincing argument
or, perhaps, a joke about prison life.
Earnestly, with thorough prepara
tion and brilliantly turned points, the
San Quentin team met Stanfordfs
case, through the debate was non
decision.
Swarming the platform to query
an issue or offer congratulations, the
friendly audience praised Debater
Mellinicoffs closing rebuttal. One
wry prisoner cracked, 'Say, kid,
studying law?' 'No,' replied
Mellinkoff. 'Well, if you ever hang
out your shingle,' the convict added,
'let me know and I'll be around.'"
On Jan. 4,1988, The Daily ran a story
about the closure of Roble Hall after
it was determined at the dorm would
not withstand "certain kinds of seis
mic activity" because its walls were
made of hollow tile clay, not rein
forced concrete. The University de
cided, on the last day of finals during
fall quarter, to close the dorm for at
least a year and relocate nearly 300
residents. The students were notified
in writing via mail over the two-week
winter break. The students were
moved to reconfigured study rooms,
guest rooms and already-occupied
dorm rooms.
