# SOCIAL INNOVATION
## New ideas for social change 
### LIJA MCHUGH ADAM STONE 
The Innovation section in The Daily usually
focuses on technological innovations at Stanford.
This makes sense: Stanford is a leader in develop
ing new technologies. From new medicines to new
search engines, the technological innovations com
ing out of Stanford will change the way we live.
But Stanford contributes to more than just
technological innovation — and its innovations in
other fields often get overlooked. Researchers,
students and alumni are also developing social
innovations: innovative ideas aimed at improving
our society. These social innovators aim to end
cycles of poverty, improve healthcare accession
serve natural resources — and the list continues.
Social innovation begins with ideas, but things
don't just end there. The best social innovators
turn their ideas into organizations aimed at social
change. Somewhere between traditional nonprof
it and for-profit models, these organizations strive
to be sustainable and measure success by calcu
lating their social bang for the buck. The people
behind these organizations, who hold others'
needs and rights as a priority in order fora better
future, are what we deem "social entrepreneurs."
This column is our way of bringing these peo
ple and their ideas to you. Each week, we will
interview leading social innovators, allowing
them to share their thoughts and experiences
with the Stanford community. Some will be from
campus, some from the Bay Area and some from
farther away. The column is a way of connecting
their ideas and organizations with you.
Social innovation is. of course, not a panacea.
It requires lots of money from generous philan
thropists, and its focus on measurable results
diverts its energy away from less tangible social
goals, such as social justice.
"Charity is not justice," Princeton Prof. Cornel
West reminded a Stanford audience last October.
Smaller organizations with limited aims need to
work together on a national scale to accomplish
larger changes in our society.
However, even taken individually, these
socially innovative organizations are improving
people's lives and communities around the
world. As these organizations grow, so will their
goals and their impact.
This is an important new movement. It is
prompting intelligent and entrepreneurial people
to address social issues that others had written off
as either unsolvable or not their concern. These
people are not just aiming to make a difference,
but aiming to make a big difference.
Elliott Brown, Class of '97, founder and direc
tor of Springboard Forward, has developed a
model for helping what our society considers the
"working poor" through career development, and
now locally competes with Manpower, the world's
largest staffing firm. Laura Scher, co-founder and
CEO of Working Assets, has formed a hybrid
business model where a portion of profits from
credit card and telecommunication services is
donated to progressive causes. Additionally, she is
a lecturer in the Social Innovation course series
through the Stanford Public Policy Program.
While this column is mainly about socially
innovative ideas and organizations, it's also about
showing why cynicism and apathy are mistaken.
In our news media, and even in our classes,
we learn much more about the problems facing
our society than efforts to solve them. We spend
more time studying the roots of injustices, than
the roots of efforts to end them. Apathy and cyn
icism are the result.
The less we know about solving social problems,
the more likely we are to say. when faced with
problems. "That's just the way the world works."
People feeling apathy and cynicism are not unrea
sonable. they're just uninformed. But apathy and
cynicism do have real and negative consequences.
It's a prevalent attitude, but it's not everywhere.
Social entrepreneurs remind us that the world is
better now because of the efforts of their like
minded motivated peers and themselves, and that
the future could be better if we take action now.
Stanford and its surrounding areas are full of
bright, motivated people. This much is clear. But
how this talent will be used is up in the air. We hope
this column will help inspire and inform people at
Stanford about how their talents can be used, not
just to pursue profit, but to make the world a bet
ter place — a much better place — as well.
