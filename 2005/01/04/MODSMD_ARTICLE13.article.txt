# Profit, patents and progress
## Science Commons aims to balance ownership and accessibility of scientific data 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
On Saturday, Creative Commons, a nonprofit
dedicated to offering flexible copyrights for cre
ative works, launched Science Commons,
designed to ease the sharing of scientific
research and datasets.
Stanford Law Prof. Lawrence Lessig, who now
serves as the current chairman of the Board of
Directors of Creative Commons, and a group of
Internet law and intellectual property experts
launched the nonprofit in 2002 to provide
authors of creative works a way to share their
efforts online while still protecting their intellec
tual property. Having created licenses for Web
sites, photos, music, films, works of literature and
scholarly works, the organization is now ready to
tackle the tricky arena of scientific intellectual
property.
Science Commons will help authors publish
work online with licenses based on the Creative

Commons copyright licenses, allowing
researchers to publish in multiple journals,
post up their work on their own Web site
and share raw datasets.
Science Commons comes at a time where
scientific copyrights are in great demand. In
the realm of scientific research, professors,
students and researchers at research univer
sities such as Stanford depend on the arti
cles published in research journals to keep
up with new findings, explore new ideas and
build upon the work of their colleagues.
But the world of research is also one
fraught with pride and stinginess.
After years and millions of dollars
poured into research, companies are eager
to patent results for profitable uses. A com
pany such as Eli Lilly, for example, is

JOSEPH BERGEN / The Stanford Daily

assured that if it spends large amounts of capital
on research fora new drug, it will retain the
rights to the formula of that drug for at least 17
years.
"Patents are a key part of encouraging inno
vation, especially when you're dealing with
human health and drug discovery," explained
John Wilhanks, executive director of Science
Commons. "The risk is enormous and the time to
market is long— 10 years or more from an idea.
And the growth of patents on gene sequences
and protein functions is very real, and has
spurred much investment in the area."
Yet patents and copyrights can also hinder
innovation, making it difficult for other
researchers to access articles and utilize data.
Genomics and patenting
New genomic research has complicated
patenting even further. In the past, researchers
were able to patent inventions or copyright arti
cles. but they were not able to copyright the data
that the work rested on. New discoveries in
genetics have evolved faster than copyright laws,
and industry pressures threaten to change patent
laws, allowing individuals or companies to name
gene sequences as their intellectual property.
This is already happening abroad: According
to the Science Commons Web site, the European

Union has created a "database right," granting
intellectual property to facts.
Experts believe that such patent agreements
will only make researching more difficult and
time consuming.
"The hard part about patenting the individ
ual actors in genomics and proteomics [the
study of proteins] is that the interesting ques
tions can involve tens upon tens of genes and
proteins — and you can add to the time and
risk of discovery the cost of hiring some really
expensive lawyers to negotiate 50 contracts
with 50 institutions before you even get start
ed," Wilbanks said.
Legal fights and denied accessibility can
impede innovation — a problem that the people
at Science Commons hope to alleviate.
"We believe we can lower transaction costs,
and encourage innovation, by creating a set of
solutions that make it easy to share knowledge
and date," Wilbanks added. "One of the key roles
I see for Science Commons is as a neutral field

innovation, making it difficult for

and utilize data... Science
Commons will work to resolve legal
problems, increasing the amount of
information available to
scientists worldwide

for the holders of intellectual property to meet
and discuss requirements for sharing — where a
journal can come in and say 'Here is what we
need a machine-readable policy to look like' or
an archive can come in and say "Here's the con
cerns we have about derivative or commercial
works.' "
Solving the Serials crisis'
One of the areas where Science Commons
can make an important contribution to univer
sities such as Stanford is in decreasing the cost
and increasing the accessibility of scientific
articles. Many top-notch journal subscriptions
cost university libraries staggering amounts,
which has created what is known as the "seri
als crisis."
According to a report published by the
Committee on Libraries, journal subscription
costs have increased nearly 50 percent in the past
few years. Publishers often create packages of
journals, selling a distinguished journal along
with several lesser-known journals, in order to
increase profits. Some publishers even charge
higher copyright rates for articles they believe
will be published in course readers in order to
further increase revenues.
According to Michael Keller, Stanford
University Librarian, many librarians in research

institutions "have unwittingly exacer
bated the serials crisis by subscribing
to the 'big deals' and succumbed to
the blandishments of a number of
for-profit publishers, sacrificing judg
ment, quality and relevance to their
desire to play some sort of numbers
game, getting more access to articles
of lesser quality and relevance."
To avoid such problems, Stanford
libraries have taken action. In
February of last year, the Faculty
Senate discussed dropping subscrip
tions to serials with disproportionate
ly expensive costs and denying sup
port to journals with exploitative
pricing schemes in an effort to ease
library budget strains.
Open Access: A solution?
Yet Science Commons offers an
alternative to completely dropping
journals, offering researchers an
opportunity to publish Open Access
material, which has more flexible
copyrights, and is often free and
available online.
"I'd expect our involvement in
this area to mirror our work else
where/'Wilbanks explained. "When a

group in the community — be
they an Open Access journal
or a major publisher, needs to
share a document — we want
to make sure there's a Science
Commons license that lets
them share."

Currently, Creative
Commons offers 11 different types of
licenses, including licenses such as
the Attribution license, which allows
people other than the authors to
"copy, distribute, display, and per
form your copyrighted work — and
derivative works based upon it —
but only if they give [the author]
credit," according to the Web site.
The other licenses grant permuta-

tions of this type of copyright.
Open Access publishing is already starting to*
gain a foothold. Stanford is a leader in Open
Access material: High Wire Press, an enterprise
unit of the Stanford University Libraries and
Academic Information Resources, offers over
800,000 free full-text articles, along with other
articles that require subscriptions to the journals.
"[This] is the largest number of free articles,
in scientific publishing, I believe, and all of
them are from highly respected, frequently
cited, high impact journals, not from bottom
feeding publishers," said Keller, the publisher
and founder of High Wire Press. Using models
such as the High Wire Press, Keller said,
researchers can access back issues for free
while still allowing private publishers to pub
lish journals and encourage innovation.
While High Wire Press does not use Creative
Commons licenses, some organizations are using
the tools creating by the nonprofit to increase
the accessibility of scientific articles while pro
tecting their copyrighted content. A large gov
ernment research organization — the
National Institute of Health — has decided to
use a Creative Commons copyright license. A
recent mandate dictates that all research pub
lished using NIH grants must be made avail
able online — free of charge —in PubMed
Central, NlH's biomedical research deposito
ry six months after the researcher publishes
the data.
Not everyone is in agreement with the
NlH's recent move, and Open Access has
become a hot topic in the world of scientific
publishing, as evidenced by a lengthy debate
in the distinguished journal "Nature."
Although Keller supports the Creative
Commons licenses, he said he is critical of the
mandate set by the NIH, arguing that the gov
ernment should not interfere with scientific
publishing.
"The [NIH] proposal, if implemented as cur
rently composed, might have adverse effects on
the progress of science, on clinical care, and on
the very programs the NIH supports," wrote
Keller to NIH Director Elias A. Zerhouni in a
letter dated Nov. 15 of last year.
"Whether or not the Open Access movement
is successful should not be important to the U.S.
government, including the NIH. And the NIH
should not undertake publishing operations in
competition to the existing marketplace," Keller
added.
Looking ahead
Copyright, patent and Open Access debates
will certainly continue to rage across scientific
circle; the issues are far from being resolved. For
many, Science Commons offers a solution that
may end up ameliorating the cost and accessibil
ity problems that are currently plaguing research
institutions.
"In general, I think that the Creative
Commons licenses are excellent and useful,"
Keller said. "For the Creative Commons to
become an influential and credible player in the
arena of publishing scientific information, they
will need time, patience, luck and money.
