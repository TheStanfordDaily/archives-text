## Editorial Tsunami victims need our help 
### 
The death toll from the record earthquake off
Southeast Asia and the subsequent tsuna
mi-driven storms has climbed to nearly
155,000, with tens of thousands still missing.
The devastation from this natural disaster continues
as residents of the affected countries, particularly in
Indonesia, struggle for food and medical supplies.
So far, the U.S. government has pledged $350 mil
lion in tsunami aid. second only to Japan's $S(X) mil
lion offer. And yesterday, President George W. Bush
called on former Presidents George lI.W. Bush and
Bill Clinton to launch a joint effort to raise money
through private donations. These efforts reflect a
meaningful — albeit still insufficient — effort on the
p.irt of the United States to provide aid to those in
need as a result of the disaster. Additionally, it will
likely help improve the nation's tarnished image in the
eyes of the global community.
But while short-term aid is definitely necessary to
immediately provide for the victims' current food
and medical needs, efforts to secure longer-term aid
must be undertaken as soon as possible, for the dev

sadly, not all Stanford community members were able to
stay out of harm's way.
Laura Wales of the Graduate School of Business
was badly injured, and another GSB student, James
Hsu, is still missing. Several GSB students are in
Thailand helping with the relief effort and searching
for Hsu. With the support of Hsu's sister Peggy, the
GSB is raising money fora relief effort "In Honor of
James Hsu." The money raised from this will be do
nated to the American Red Cross.
The GSB community's effort to aid the tsunami
victims in their time of need should serve as an in
spiration to the rest of the University community.
We strongly encourage everyone to find a way to
contribute the tsunami relief effort, whether it be
through the GSB fund or to other organizations that
are helping the Southeast region in its recovery. That
the storms did not occur in our backyard should not
excuse each of us from a responsibility to try and
lessen the immense burdens carried by the many vic
tims of of this horrible tragedy.
