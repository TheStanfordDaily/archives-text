## Remembering genocide, ignoring genocide 
### KAI STINCHCOMBE 
The U.S. and several allies are
pushing fora special Holocaust
memorial session of the IJ.N. on
Jan. 24. three days before the 60th
anniversary of Auschwitz's libera
tion by Soviet troops in 11>45.l l >45. But as
members of the international com
munity honor the I lolocaust's mem
ory, they arc ignoring its lesson.
A round of hollow, hypocritical
never-againning this January would
be par for the course in our dysfunc
tional international system. In this
scenario, the I Jnited States reminds
its European allies that they didn't
mind U.S. military power so much
when America saved Europe from
fascism, and says international ter
rorism is the new global menace.
France talks about international law
and soft power, making excuses for
never doing anything helpful for the
world. Everyone goes home patting
themselves on the back.
The scenario is gross, but much
more so while genocide is literally
ongoing in the Darfur region of
western Sudan. Though it would
trivialize the Holocaust to com
pare it to anything going on in the
world today, the best way to
memorialize its victims is through
the sort of self-critical moral re
flection that could have prevented
the slaughter of 12 million Jews.
Slavs, Poles. Roma, handicapped
people, and gays and lesbians 60
years ago. As the Holocaust taught
us. genocide is a threat to our col
lective humanity, and always re
quires action.
Sudan is not going to stop the
genocide on its own. Flush with oil
revenues and eagerly armed by
greedy weapons dealers and sce-no
evil politicians, the government is
intent on driving its black minority

off their land. The only hope for
Darfur is a U.N. Security Council
resolution establishing a no-fly zone
over Southern and Western Sudan,
beefing up the African Union force
already there with more interna
tional troops, and establishing a
mandatory and enforceable arms
embargo on Sudan.
As U.N. peacekeeping opera
tions go, it would be a relatively
straightforward mission. A number
of countries could contribute to on
the-ground forces, and militias on
horseback are not difficult targets
for modern militaries. With western
financial and logistical support, the
African Union could provide most
of the troops.
Enforcement of the no-fly zone
would be key to protecting the
peacekeepers and disrupting heli
copter and gunship attacks and
"barrel bombs," loads of shrapnel
dropped from transport planes.
Though some modernization has
been paid for by oil revenues,
Sudan's air forces arc in disrepair
and lack serious combat capabili
ties. It would take U.S. or other
Western air power, but losses could
be avoided. In order to avoid exces
sive patrolling, enforcement of the
no-fly /one by retaliation against
aircrÂ«ft on the ground would have
to be authorized by the U.N.
Yet with P5 Security Council
members deeply invested in Su
danese oil and arms sales, there has
been little response so far. Britain
and the I Jnited States would have to
push hard to get such a resolution
through the Security Council. After
messing up so badly in Iraq. Bush is
not an ideal messenger to call for in
ternational intervention. But this
time, he has justice on his side, and
may be able to use the occasion of
Holocaust memorials to shame F.u

rope into taking action.
What can we do to help? Step
one is convincing Bush. It's very
easy to write a letter to the White
I louse. And I think Bush might ac
tually listen. Politically, it's a no
brainer: Liberals love stopping
genocide, evangelicals love it when
Bush saves lives in Africa, neo-im
perialists love using the military,
capitalists would love stability in
oil-rich parts of Sudan, intellectu
als love working with the U.N.,
and Black activists would be
happy to see Africa on the agenda
for once. Bush envisions himself
as a transformative, visionary
president, answerable to God and
history, and this would fit well
within that framework.
For the resolution to actually
pass the U.N., step two is making
Darfur a moral issue that the inter
national community can't say no to.
If it's Bush the cowboy unilateralist
proposing yet another intervention,
it would be very easy for the France
and Russia to dismiss. Congress has
already passed a unanimous resolu
tion on Darfur, but another one,
strongly and vociferously backed by
key Democrats, would strengthen
Bush's hand internationally.
The key phrase in Holocaust
memorials is "never again." Unfor
tunately, up to and including the
Rwanda genocide, the international
community has struck out. Kosovo
was the first time we did the right
thing. Let's make sure the world
knows it was a change of heart,
rather than a change of skin color,
that got us involved.
It's time to take action in Darfur.
