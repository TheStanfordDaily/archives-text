# Sketch: Tales of a Grad Student
## Wanted: Rich American bride 
### 
Can offer English accent
and extensive (well actu
ally not that extensive)
knowledge of obscure
branches of theoretical physics.
Before I continue I should point
out a couple of things to any INS
officials reading this. First of all,
you may want to consider a higher
circulation paper — as much as I
love The Daily, its reporting on il
legal border crossings is a little less
than comprehensive.
Also, and more importantly for
my visa status, 1 not really looking
fora rich American bride. It's just a

joke. There's no
need to deport
me. Honest.
Now, on to
business. I sup
pose, however,
that the edge
has been taken
off by the previ
ous paragraph,
but run with me.
I have several

ambitions — or rather dreams — in
life. And it's always seemed to me
that America is the best place to
start living them.
Like most good dreams (and the
best nightmares) mine revolve
around money, sex . . . and an
American passport (once again,
INS folks — just kidding).
Frankly, since the Second World
War British nationality hasn't car
ried the same cachet it used to.
More about that in a bit.
Obscure — and considerably
less than practical — physics does
not provide the underpinnings of a
high-paid career. Actually, this not
just a physics problem. In fact,
large numbers of graduate stu
dents will be resigning themselves
to lives of poverty.
Of course when I say poverty,
what I mean is that it's unlikely
that many of us will be able to live
in the manner that we wish we
were accustomed to.
However, like all good prob
lems. the solution simply involves
marriage. That way the child will
have a real mommy and a daddy,
and society won't shun them.
As well as legitimizing children,
marriage also has the potential to
fix the low cash-flow situation.
After all. what is love for if not to
provide boundless affection and
the odd dollar or two?
The trick with love and mar
riage is to understand both what
your priorities should be and how
to best market yourself.
A career in academia is poorly

remunerated and, what's more,
fringe benefits aren't up to scratch
either — not a field filled with
tropical getaways and beautiful
people.
Accordingly, to fill what's miss
ing from your life, you should be
hunting for your future spouse
amongst the rich and the famous.
Find yourself a wealthy bride or
husband or box turtle, make sure
that they can supply you with the
social capital you're missing and
find the registry office.
Now. I know what you're all
thinking: How am I going to attract
a rich box turtle? The situation is,
however, not as dire as one might
assume at first glance.
A graduate student is not such a
bad catch. Think about what you
can offer your bright and shiny po
tential spouse: Discourse on hid
den corners of murky areas of in
tellectual endeavours, extensive
experience wasting time on dubi
ous Web sites, suspect personal
hygiene ...
Well, maybe the personal hy
giene routine is not such a clever
approach, and anyway it only real
ly applies to electrical engineers
(that was also a joke — no hate
mail please).
In reality, of course, bagging a
sugar mommy (or daddy) will take
a little more than detailed descrip
tions of last night's fascinating rev
elations on peasant dynamics in
12th-century Burma.
Actually, you may need to make
a couple of sacrifices in the pursuit
of wealth, happiness and the
American passport. After all, nei
ther men nor women should be
judged on looks, personality, sense
of humour and sexual prowess
alone.
If you can manage grab yourself
your own personal goldmine, just
imagine the splendours life could
offer. Instead of ramen, think
caviar; instead of Jan Sport, think
Louis Vuitton.
And, best of all, those of us
from foreign countries can look
forward not just to doing a Demi
and Woody, but also glancing over
at the sparkling new green card sit
ting on the dresser while we're at
it.

Nov would once again like to reas
sure the INS that he's perfectly
happy with England. However, if
there are any rich fitties out there,
please get in touch (he'll even ex
plain what a fittie is) at
navins@stanford. edu.

Can offer English accent
and extensive (well actu
ally not that extensive)
knowledge of obscure
branches of theoretical physics.
Before I continue I should point
out a couple of things to any INS
officials reading this. First of all,
you may want to consider a higher
circulation paper — as much as I
love The Daily, its reporting on il
legal border crossings is a little less
than comprehensive.
Also, and more importantly for
my visa status, 1 not really looking
fora rich American bride. It's just a

joke. There's no
need to deport
me. Honest.
Now, on to
business. I sup
pose, however,
that the edge
has been taken
off by the previ
ous paragraph,
but run with me.
I have several

ambitions — or rather dreams — in
life. And it's always seemed to me
that America is the best place to
start living them.
Like most good dreams (and the
best nightmares) mine revolve
around money, sex . . . and an
American passport (once again,
INS folks — just kidding).
Frankly, since the Second World
War British nationality hasn't car
ried the same cachet it used to.
More about that in a bit.
Obscure — and considerably
less than practical — physics does
not provide the underpinnings of a
high-paid career. Actually, this not
just a physics problem. In fact,
large numbers of graduate stu
dents will be resigning themselves
to lives of poverty.
Of course when I say poverty,
what I mean is that it's unlikely
that many of us will be able to live
in the manner that we wish we
were accustomed to.
However, like all good prob
lems. the solution simply involves
marriage. That way the child will
have a real mommy and a daddy,
and society won't shun them.
As well as legitimizing children,
marriage also has the potential to
fix the low cash-flow situation.
After all. what is love for if not to
provide boundless affection and
the odd dollar or two?
The trick with love and mar
riage is to understand both what
your priorities should be and how
to best market yourself.
A career in academia is poorly

remunerated and, what's more,
fringe benefits aren't up to scratch
either — not a field filled with
tropical getaways and beautiful
people.
Accordingly, to fill what's miss
ing from your life, you should be
hunting for your future spouse
amongst the rich and the famous.
Find yourself a wealthy bride or
husband or box turtle, make sure
that they can supply you with the
social capital you're missing and
find the registry office.
Now. I know what you're all
thinking: How am I going to attract
a rich box turtle? The situation is,
however, not as dire as one might
assume at first glance.
A graduate student is not such a
bad catch. Think about what you
can offer your bright and shiny po
tential spouse: Discourse on hid
den corners of murky areas of in
tellectual endeavours, extensive
experience wasting time on dubi
ous Web sites, suspect personal
hygiene ...
Well, maybe the personal hy
giene routine is not such a clever
approach, and anyway it only real
ly applies to electrical engineers
(that was also a joke — no hate
mail please).
In reality, of course, bagging a
sugar mommy (or daddy) will take
a little more than detailed descrip
tions of last night's fascinating rev
elations on peasant dynamics in
12th-century Burma.
Actually, you may need to make
a couple of sacrifices in the pursuit
of wealth, happiness and the
American passport. After all, nei
ther men nor women should be
judged on looks, personality, sense
of humour and sexual prowess
alone.
If you can manage grab yourself
your own personal goldmine, just
imagine the splendours life could
offer. Instead of ramen, think
caviar; instead of Jan Sport, think
Louis Vuitton.
And, best of all, those of us
from foreign countries can look
forward not just to doing a Demi
and Woody, but also glancing over
at the sparkling new green card sit
ting on the dresser while we're at
it.

Nov would once again like to reas
sure the INS that he's perfectly
happy with England. However, if
there are any rich fitties out there,
please get in touch (he'll even ex
plain what a fittie is) at
navins@stanford. edu.
