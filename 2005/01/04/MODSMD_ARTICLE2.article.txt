### CYNTHIA H.CHO MANAGING EDITOR 
Six Graduate School of Business
students have spearheaded a cam
paign to raise $50,000 in honor of a
classmate who is still missing from
the Dec. 26 tsunamis created by a
magnitude 9.0 earthquake in the In
dian Ocean. Twenty-five year old
James Hsu, a second-year student at
the Business School, is one of thou
sands of Americans reported miss
ing.
Secretary of State Colin L. Pow
ell said in a New York Times article
published today that 15 Americans
have been confirmed dead as of
yesterday and another 4,000 to
5,000 remain officially missing.
The death toll is 150,000 and rising.

Hsu — a Merced native who
graduated with a degree in political
science from the University of Cal
ifornia, Berkeley — was vacation
ing on Thailand's Koh Phi Phi is
land with four other Business
School students. They were among
about two dozen students who
were participating in a Business
School study trip program that
ended on Dec. 22.
Another Business School stu
dent, Laura Wales, was injured and
treated in a hospital in Bangkok.
The Associated Press reported last
Friday that she had hoped to return
to California this week. Courtney
Payne, director of the Business
School's Student Life Office, said
that the other students are expect
ed to return today, for the first day

of classes.
"One of the difficult things
when something like this happens
so far away is finding what can be
done from here," Payne said.
"There is so little that people can
do."
Dean of Students Greg Board
man seemed to agree.
"We don't have the resources to
be there and be involved as we
would be in a student emergency
on campus," he said. "We are in
volved in keeping track of what's
going on and assisting the family
and his friends here."
But classmates of Hsu and
Wales have not let that difficulty
stop them. In an e-mail sent out to
