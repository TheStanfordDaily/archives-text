# Students honor missing classmate
## 
### CYNTHIA H.CHO MANAGING EDITOR 
Six Graduate School of Business
students have spearheaded a cam
paign to raise $50,000 in honor of a
classmate who is still missing from
the Dec. 26 tsunamis created by a
magnitude 9.0 earthquake in the In
dian Ocean. Twenty-five year old
James Hsu, a second-year student at
the Business School, is one of thou
sands of Americans reported miss
ing.
Secretary of State Colin L. Pow
ell said in a New York Times article
published today that 15 Americans
have been confirmed dead as of
yesterday and another 4,000 to
5,000 remain officially missing.
The death toll is 150,000 and rising.

Hsu — a Merced native who
graduated with a degree in political
science from the University of Cal
ifornia, Berkeley — was vacation
ing on Thailand's Koh Phi Phi is
land with four other Business
School students. They were among
about two dozen students who
were participating in a Business
School study trip program that
ended on Dec. 22.
Another Business School stu
dent, Laura Wales, was injured and
treated in a hospital in Bangkok.
The Associated Press reported last
Friday that she had hoped to return
to California this week. Courtney
Payne, director of the Business
School's Student Life Office, said
that the other students are expect
ed to return today, for the first day

of classes.
"One of the difficult things
when something like this happens
so far away is finding what can be
done from here," Payne said.
"There is so little that people can
do."
Dean of Students Greg Board
man seemed to agree.
"We don't have the resources to
be there and be involved as we
would be in a student emergency
on campus," he said. "We are in
volved in keeping track of what's
going on and assisting the family
and his friends here."
But classmates of Hsu and
Wales have not let that difficulty
stop them. In an e-mail sent out to

all Business School students last
Friday and obtained by The Daily,
the six students who set up the
fundraising campaign in Hsu's
honor wrote, "The recent tsunamis
that have devastated South Asia
have also had a tremendous impact
upon our GSB community . . . Our
goal is to help afflicted communi
ties in South Asia as a GSB com
munity — students, faculty, alumni
and administrators. The target we
have set for the student body is
$50,000 (roughly $70 per student),
which we expect to multiply with
contributions from corporate
donors."
The six Business School stu
dents who started the fundraising
campaign selected the Red Cross
as the beneficiary of the donations.
They explained their decision in
the same e-mail: "While there are
many relief organizations in South
Asia, we chose the Red Cross be
cause it has the largest presence in
the afflicted areas and provides the
most comprehensive array of ser
vices, both immediate and long
term."
Also in the e-mail were instruc
tions on how to donate online, by
telephone or by mail "In Honor of

James Hsu." (The Red Cross gives
all donors the option of making a
contribution "In Honor Of" some
one).
Students were also encouraged
to gather donations from private
individuals and corporations. The
students leading this fundraising
campaign are planning to ask cor
porations to match the student
gifts.
Boardman said that fundraising
efforts are of utmost importance
because "that's where the need is."
"Money is needed for daily
needs," he said.
Robert Joss, dean of the Gradu
ate School of Business, could not
be reached by The Daily because
he is in Australia. He said in an ar
ticle published on Dec. 29 in the
Stanford Report that Stanford is
"doing everything possible to sup
port the search" for Hsu.
"In this disaster of such im
mense proportion, we are over
whelmingly concerned for James
and his family," Joss said in the
same story.
"Students are trying to think
globally by acting globally," Payne
said, adding that helping the vic
tims of the disaster isn't just a GSB

Tsunami victim's class
mates to raise $50,000

effort but a University-wide effort.
[A story about an undergraduate
fundraising campaign will be in
The Daily later this week.]
On Thursday at noon, there will
be a vigil of prayer and remem
brance for those affected by the
tsunamis at Memorial Church.
"It's a time for us to come to
gether as a community, regardless
of our academic discipline or our
position within the University. So
it's an important community-af
firming time," said Rev. Scotty
McLennan, Dean for Religious
Life. McLennan's office is organiz
ing the vigil.
"It's a momentous event that af
fects our community from the glob
al environment. In this case there's
a second reason. We have lost, at
least at the moment, one of our
business students, and we know of
other students who were injured in
the tsunamis," McLennan added.
