Daily The Year in Sports'
coverage incomplete
There was something missing from
"The Year in Sports." That something
is Samantha Magee. There is not one
mention of this Stanford junior, and in
my opinion, Sam deserves to he on the
front page.
Why? Because she is an Olympian.
And not only just an Olympian but
the youngest member of the women's
national rowing team, a silver-medal
winner and a world-record holder.
It's interesting that in the "12
Months of Cardinal Sports" under
August. Sam is not mentioned at all.
while a graduated senior. Markus
Rogan. and Tara Kirk were both
highlighted.
Don't get me wrong. 1 am not trying
to downplay any of the amazing ac

complishments of the other Stanford
athletes. I would just like some school
recognition of this amazing athlete and
person. Of course Sam would never
write a letter like this. She is too hum
ble. In fact, it's rare for Sam to even
speak of her Olympic accomplish
ments. So, I think it's time that some
one finally does.

Cal holds pre-Big Game festivities
I read a response to a recent Daily
column ("Stanford's traditions merit
more respect," Dec. 2) about Cal.
There is. of course, a lot that's debate
able in there, but about one thing:
"Now it is true that Berkeley doesn't
have Gaieties or a student production

to generate school spirit, but the reason
is simple: Their students don't have
enough enthusiasm about their school
to initiate such an intense undertaking.
All their students can muster is a
projection of a bear on their clock tower
in the week previous to the game."
You're dead wrong. For one, let's
start with the Big Game Bonfire, which
fills the Greek Theatre with a crowd
witnessing a 60-foot-high bonfire and
performances by every Cal spirit
group. This requires weeks of planning,
more than 500 man-hours of prepara
tion the day of the event alone, and the
cooperation of the football team, the
band, the dance team and numerous
campus personalities.
But that's only the beginning. The
bear on the side of the Campanile is a
new addition — there are rallies all
week, a "Laugh Your Axe Off' comedy
event. Big Game titration in the chem
istry classes and fraternity house deco
rating. And that's just the start. You can
belittle Cal all you want (though don't
expect us to take it lying down), but
check your facts before you say some
thing as blatantly untrue as "they don't
do anything Big Game Week".

Museum not actually a museum

I find myself perplexed at recent
coverage ("Museum opens in Kairos
dorm room," Dec. 2) of a certain so
called Matthias K. Rath Museum of
Destruction and Resurrection, which is
in fact simply Kairos Room 301, an or
dinary one-room triple inhabited by
these three students who style them
selves "curators".
Is it news to describe how three
students choose to decorate and
market their own room? Even sup
posing that what they actually had
created was rather extraordinary (it
isn't), what is the idea of the whole
enterprise?
1 had a chance to see the supposed
"house of wonders" myself recently,
at the invitation of a friend who lives
in the dorm and was preternaturally
upbeat about the idea.
"It's very pre-F.nlightenment, al

most anti-Enlightenment" my friend
said to me, echoing the curators. Why
is that something to be proud of? Our
great nation, which American men
and women are dying for, was found
ed on Enlightenment principles. Who
are we to mock the age that gave us
democracy and science?
Though I have written this letter to
question the ideology of the enterprise,
I also question its aesthetics and its
truthfulness. I personally could not tell
what exhibits were fake and which
were real — why would the curators
want to create this confusion and mock
our very senses?
I think the supposed museum
(whose founder, this Dr. Rath, appears
to be some bizarre local charlatan) is
suspect, nor is it worthwhile news to re
port to our fine community.
