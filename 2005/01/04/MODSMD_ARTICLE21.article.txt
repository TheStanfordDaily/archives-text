Daily The Year in Sports'
coverage incomplete
There was something missing from
"The Year in Sports." That something
is Samantha Magee. There is not one
mention of this Stanford junior, and in
my opinion, Sam deserves to he on the
front page.
Why? Because she is an Olympian.
And not only just an Olympian but
the youngest member of the women's
national rowing team, a silver-medal
winner and a world-record holder.
It's interesting that in the "12
Months of Cardinal Sports" under
August. Sam is not mentioned at all.
while a graduated senior. Markus
Rogan. and Tara Kirk were both
highlighted.
Don't get me wrong. 1 am not trying
to downplay any of the amazing ac

complishments of the other Stanford
athletes. I would just like some school
recognition of this amazing athlete and
person. Of course Sam would never
write a letter like this. She is too hum
ble. In fact, it's rare for Sam to even
speak of her Olympic accomplish
ments. So, I think it's time that some
one finally does.

"Now it is true that Berkeley doesn't
have Gaieties or a student production

to generate school spirit, but the reason
is simple: Their students don't have
enough enthusiasm about their school
to initiate such an intense undertaking.
All their students can muster is a
projection of a bear on their clock tower
in the week previous to the game."
You're dead wrong. For one, let's
start with the Big Game Bonfire, which
fills the Greek Theatre with a crowd
witnessing a 60-foot-high bonfire and
performances by every Cal spirit
group. This requires weeks of planning,
more than 500 man-hours of prepara
tion the day of the event alone, and the
cooperation of the football team, the
band, the dance team and numerous
campus personalities.
But that's only the beginning. The
bear on the side of the Campanile is a
