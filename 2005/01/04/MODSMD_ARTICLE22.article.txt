# Smoke and Mirrors Aside ...
## We're not doing enough to assist 
### 
Certain photographs over
the last 50 years have
shaken America's na
tional conscience and
challenged the way we view our
selves. From Vietnam to Birming
ham to the Abu Ghraib prison,
these images have sparked water
shed moments in American histo
ry. many with more lasting conse
quences than others. Let's hope
that the tsunami-produced images
of death and destruction we've
seen over the last week will join
that collection.
With more than 155,000 dead
in the last count, the tsunamis in
Asia serve undoubtedly as the sin
gle most tragic event in our life
times. In the midst of this tragedy,
a national discussion has finally
begun on whether the United
States, with its stumbling initial
contributions, does enough to aid
those in need around the world.
The New York Times noted
last week that most Americans
believe that 24 percent of Ameri
ca's national budget goes to help
ing poor people in other coun
tries. The actual figure is less than
a quarter of one percent, or about
.13 percent of our gross domestic
product. The Norwegians, on the
other hand, donate about .92 per
cent of their GDP, well above the
.7 percent that the United Nations
urges as a minimum contribution
for all wealthy nations.
Secretary of State Colin Powell
and President George W. Bush
have continually contended, how
ever, that the United States is the
most generous nation in the world,
both in public and private dona
tions. So who should we believe?
Well first, let's recognize that
some people's minds are already
decided. Some on the left will
view this controversy as an oppor
tunity to berate America for its al
legedly hypocritical nature and
fragile moral backbone. Some on
the right will treat the discussion
as a chance to add more fuel to the
fire against the United Nations
for its supposedly jealous and vin
dictive crybaby attitude.
Though it's easier to believe
that America's soul is either pos
sessed by the devil or divined by
God, an honest look at how much
America helps the poor reveals
that we're more in a state of pur
gatory and descending at a steady

pace. Let's take a look at some
numbers.
First, it's true that the United
States gives more foreign aid
than any other country. But
sorry, politically-motivated aid
to Israel, Egypt, and Pakistan
should not count. If you isolate
development aid, you'll find that
America gave $16.2 billion in
2003. That sounds like a lot, but
much of that money is distribut
ed to "strategically important"
regions where the U.S. has spe
cial "security interests."
For example, almost $4 billion
of the president's requested $8.8
billion budget for the U.S. Agency
for International Development
(USAID) this year will be spent on

programs tied
with strategic in
terests — help
ing former Soviet
states, bolstering
our anti-drug ef
forts, and touch
ing on hotspots
here and there.
Whereas the Eu
ropean Union,
on the other
hand, gave $37.1

billion for development aid in a
less skewed fashion.
U.S. officials would contend
that private donations in America
are enormous. Americans donat
ed a generous $5 billion to foreign
charities through private and cor
porate contributions. But even
though Americans earn more and
are taxed less, they do not con
tribute more than if the govern
ment just yanked the money from
them in the first place.
The United States is right,
however, when it says that much
of the onus should be placed on
developing countries that don't
embrace democratic reform or
weed out corruption. Greedy
rulers often do siphon aid to their
own private bank accounts, but
this should not be a reason for
America to walk away.
Visit any developing country
and you'll see young children with
no homes and no chance, whose
very innocence presents a strong
argument against inaction. To be
lieve that our country cannot get
to these children is to reject the
American spirit that rebuilt Eu
rope under the Marshall Plan.

landed a man on the moon by way
of President John F. Kennedy's
call to service, and persevered
over the Soviet Union to make
the case that political freedom
and economic security were not
mutually exclusive values.
If the sky really is the limit,
then no country is more qualified
and competent to do it than the
United States. And with 97 per
cent of the world's new popula
tion being born in the developing
world, the time to act is now.
Money alone being distributed as
it is today cannot solve the
world's battles against poverty,
famine, war and lost hope. What it
takes is leadership and a new ap
proach to uplifting others, free of
short-sighted political calcula
tions and cognizant of our interre
latedness as human beings.
In sum, the case that defends
America's aid record is weak, no
matter how you look at it. The
New York Times reported that
aid for victims in last year's earth
quake in Iran has scantly been de
livered by the United States. And
just before Christmas, President
Bush eliminated $100 million of
contributions to global food aid
programs from his 2005 budget
request. As a result. Save the
Children, Catholic Relief Ser
vices and other international
charities will have to eliminate
programs and rescind on con
tracts with governments and
grassroots agencies that help alle
viate poverty and suffering
worldwide.
Americans should look to the
tsunamis as an opportunity to give
and to re-evaluate their own
standing in the world. President
Bush took a step in the right di
rection by announcing yesterday
that his father and former Presi
dent Bill Clinton would raise
money for tsunami victims. But he
must go further by leading the
world into a new era of thinking.
And if we demand more action
from our lawmakers, then the vic
tims of the tsunamis will not have
died in vain.

Certain photographs over
the last 50 years have
shaken America's na
tional conscience and
challenged the way we view our
selves. From Vietnam to Birming
ham to the Abu Ghraib prison,
these images have sparked water
shed moments in American histo
ry. many with more lasting conse
quences than others. Let's hope
that the tsunami-produced images
of death and destruction we've
seen over the last week will join
that collection.
With more than 155,000 dead
in the last count, the tsunamis in
Asia serve undoubtedly as the sin
gle most tragic event in our life
times. In the midst of this tragedy,
a national discussion has finally
begun on whether the United
States, with its stumbling initial
contributions, does enough to aid
those in need around the world.
The New York Times noted
last week that most Americans
believe that 24 percent of Ameri
ca's national budget goes to help
ing poor people in other coun
tries. The actual figure is less than
a quarter of one percent, or about
.13 percent of our gross domestic
product. The Norwegians, on the
other hand, donate about .92 per
cent of their GDP, well above the
.7 percent that the United Nations
urges as a minimum contribution
for all wealthy nations.
Secretary of State Colin Powell
and President George W. Bush
have continually contended, how
ever, that the United States is the
most generous nation in the world,
both in public and private dona
tions. So who should we believe?
Well first, let's recognize that
some people's minds are already
decided. Some on the left will
view this controversy as an oppor
tunity to berate America for its al
legedly hypocritical nature and
fragile moral backbone. Some on
the right will treat the discussion
as a chance to add more fuel to the
fire against the United Nations
for its supposedly jealous and vin
dictive crybaby attitude.
Though it's easier to believe
that America's soul is either pos
sessed by the devil or divined by
God, an honest look at how much
America helps the poor reveals
that we're more in a state of pur
gatory and descending at a steady

pace. Let's take a look at some
numbers.
First, it's true that the United
States gives more foreign aid
than any other country. But
sorry, politically-motivated aid
to Israel, Egypt, and Pakistan
should not count. If you isolate
development aid, you'll find that
America gave $16.2 billion in
2003. That sounds like a lot, but
much of that money is distribut
ed to "strategically important"
regions where the U.S. has spe
cial "security interests."
For example, almost $4 billion
of the president's requested $8.8
billion budget for the U.S. Agency
for International Development
(USAID) this year will be spent on

programs tied
with strategic in
terests — help
ing former Soviet
states, bolstering
our anti-drug ef
forts, and touch
ing on hotspots
here and there.
Whereas the Eu
ropean Union,
on the other
hand, gave $37.1

billion for development aid in a
less skewed fashion.
U.S. officials would contend
that private donations in America
are enormous. Americans donat
ed a generous $5 billion to foreign
charities through private and cor
porate contributions. But even
though Americans earn more and
are taxed less, they do not con
tribute more than if the govern
ment just yanked the money from
them in the first place.
The United States is right,
however, when it says that much
of the onus should be placed on
developing countries that don't
embrace democratic reform or
weed out corruption. Greedy
rulers often do siphon aid to their
own private bank accounts, but
this should not be a reason for
America to walk away.
Visit any developing country
and you'll see young children with
no homes and no chance, whose
very innocence presents a strong
argument against inaction. To be
lieve that our country cannot get
to these children is to reject the
American spirit that rebuilt Eu
rope under the Marshall Plan.

landed a man on the moon by way
of President John F. Kennedy's
call to service, and persevered
over the Soviet Union to make
the case that political freedom
and economic security were not
mutually exclusive values.
If the sky really is the limit,
then no country is more qualified
and competent to do it than the
United States. And with 97 per
cent of the world's new popula
tion being born in the developing
world, the time to act is now.
Money alone being distributed as
it is today cannot solve the
world's battles against poverty,
famine, war and lost hope. What it
takes is leadership and a new ap
proach to uplifting others, free of
short-sighted political calcula
tions and cognizant of our interre
latedness as human beings.
In sum, the case that defends
America's aid record is weak, no
matter how you look at it. The
New York Times reported that
aid for victims in last year's earth
quake in Iran has scantly been de
livered by the United States. And
just before Christmas, President
Bush eliminated $100 million of
contributions to global food aid
programs from his 2005 budget
request. As a result. Save the
Children, Catholic Relief Ser
vices and other international
charities will have to eliminate
programs and rescind on con
tracts with governments and
grassroots agencies that help alle
viate poverty and suffering
worldwide.
Americans should look to the
tsunamis as an opportunity to give
and to re-evaluate their own
standing in the world. President
Bush took a step in the right di
rection by announcing yesterday
that his father and former Presi
dent Bill Clinton would raise
money for tsunami victims. But he
must go further by leading the
world into a new era of thinking.
And if we demand more action
from our lawmakers, then the vic
tims of the tsunamis will not have
died in vain.
