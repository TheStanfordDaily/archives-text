## Let's take a bow to fiscal conservatism 
### BILL WHALEN 
As the curtain rises on his sec
ond term. President George W.
Bush doesn't lack for opportunities
to secure an enduring legacy. In ad
dition to prosecuting the war on
terrorism, the president has indi
cated that he wants to reform So
cial Security, simplify the nation's
tax code, and institute health sav
ings accounts — all noble yet
formidable challenges.
Here's one additional item for
that legacy portfolio: a bow to fiscal
conservatism by restoring presi
dential line-item veto authority.
In June 1998. only two years
after a Republican Congress and a
Democratic president agreed that
line-item vetoing was a necessary
means to curb Washington s spend
ing appetite, the Supreme Court
struck down the president's ability
to remove individual projects from
congressionally approved legisla
tion. Instead, the president can sign
or veto spending and tax bills only
in their entirety.
Not surprisingly. Congress has
taken full advantage of the situa
tion. According to the budgetary
watchdog Citizens Against Gov
ernment Waste, Congress this past
year approved more than 10,600
"pork" items totaling nearly $23
billion —a 13 percent increase

over the previous year — at a time
when the federal deficit surpassed
$422 billion and the national debt
topped $7.5 trillion.
With Washington drowning in a
sea of red ink, the timing is right to
restore line-item authority. The
only question is how to proceed.
Here are three options:
1) Constitutional amendment:
Separate bills currently before the
House and Senate would restore
line-item authority by amending
the Constitution. Although the ap
proval process is steeper (a two
thirds-vote in both chambers of
Congress, plus 38 states' approval),
it improves the chances of a new
law surviving an all-but-certain
constitutional challenge by line
item opponents.
2) Impoundment: Up to 1974,
presidents enjoyed a power known
as impoundment: If a president
didn't think an appropriation was
appropriate, he didn't spend the
earmarked money. But amid Wa
tergate and its various intragovern
mental power struggles. Congress
restricted impoundment. Three
decades later. Congress should
right that wrong and give the presi
dent the ability not to spend money
allocated by Congress if that spend
ing is deemed unnecessary.
3) Enhanced rescission: The
president does have one option, for

he can rescind "pork" items and
send an entire spending bill back to
Congress for reconsideration.
However, Congress holds the
trump card: If it doesn't act, the
president's rescission is automati
cally rejected. A simple remedy for
this would be "enhanced rescis
sion" authority whereby Congress
would be forced to vote on the
president's request within 45 to 60
days, thus forcing members to go
on the record as for or against fiscal
excess.
Will these reforms dramatically
reverse the rising deficit tide?
Probably not. In the 18 months that
he enjoyed line-item veto authori
ty, President Clinton targeted only
82 programs, 38 of which were re
stored by Congress for an overall
savings of a mere $2 billion — a
drop in the federal bucket.
Nevertheless, it would send a
positive message to a cynical pub
lic: If Washington can't halt run
away spending, at least it is willing
to hand over the reins to the presi
dent and let him try to slow down
the horses.

president's rescission is automati
cally rejected. A simple remedy for
this would be "enhanced rescis
sion" authority whereby Congress
would be forced to vote on the
president's request within 45 to 60
days, thus forcing members to go
on the record as for or against fiscal
excess.
Will these reforms dramatically
reverse the rising deficit tide?
Probably not. In the 18 months that
he enjoyed line-item veto authori
ty, President Clinton targeted only
82 programs, 38 of which were re
stored by Congress for an overall
savings of a mere $2 billion — a
drop in the federal bucket.
Nevertheless, it would send a
positive message to a cynical pub
lic: If Washington can't halt run
away spending, at least it is willing
to hand over the reins to the presi
dent and let him try to slow down
the horses.
