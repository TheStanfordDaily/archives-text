## What about the battle against AIDS? 
### LAURA E. HIGGINS 
By the time you finish reading
this sentence. 50 people will have
died of AIDS and 85 will be newly
infected with HIV. These numbers
are astounding, yet Dec. 1 —
World AIDS Day — seemed to
quietly slip by. Given that HIV /
AIDS is the deadliest disease of
our time, shouldn't more attention
be focused on fighting this global
pandemic?
More than 22 million people
worldwide have lost their lives to
AIDS, and at least 42 million are
currently living with HIV / AIDS.
Nine out of every 10 of those living
with the infection are adults in
their productive and reproductive
prime. The hardest-hit countries
are in sub-Saharan Africa, where
the epidemic has reversed decades
of progress in combating mortality
and has compromised the living
conditions of future generations.
In Botswana, for example, one in
every three adults is HIV positive.
Life expectancy in Botswana
reached 65 years in 1995, accord
ing to the United Nations, but it
has recently dropped to 40 years as
a direct result of AIDS. Further
more, population projections
show that there will be a severe
deficit of working-age people by
2025.
The spread of HIV / AIDS is not
isolated to Africa. The illness has
established deep roots in the most
populous countries of the world.
Approximately one million people
are currently infected with HIV in
China and six million in India.
The destructive effects of the

epidemic have imposed a heavy
burden not only on families and
communities but also on the
economies of the world. HIV /
AIDS threatens the livelihoods of
workers and those who depend on
them. In doing so, it also weakens
national economies. Through ill
ness and death, the pandemic has
reduced the skill and experience of
the labor force. This loss in human
capital threatens the capacity of
economies to produce and deliver
goods and services on a sustainable
basis.
According to a recent report by
the International Labour Organi
zation, the global workforce has
lost 28 million people of working
age since the emergence of HIV /
AIDS. Moreover, the United Na
tions estimates that, in many of the
highly affected countries, the im
pact of the disease on economic
growth has led to annual reductions
of two to four percentage points in
gross domestic product per year.
The effects of the virus go well
beyond gross domestic product and
economic performance to include
the long-term impacts on welfare
and development. The well-being
of future generations is jeopardized
as children are orphaned or forced
to leave school to work or care for
sick family members. This cycle not
only threatens posterity but in the
end, the ability to tackle the AIDS
dilemma.
Recent figures show that HIV /
AIDS is outpacing actions to arrest
it. Because the epidemic is at dif
ferent stages across the world, no
single action is appropriate for all
settings. Nevertheless, the direct

and indirect costs of inaction are far
greater than the costs of treatment.
Senegal serves as an example of
a country where aggressive action
in the battle against AIDS has paid
off. The prevalence rate of HIV in
fections among adults in Senegal
has been kept at between 1.77 and
1.74 percent — this compares to
rates of between 20 percent and 30
percent in other African countries.
The reasons for this success lie in
Senegal's early response to the
disease.
Instead of denying the reality of
the danger of HIV / AIDS, Sene
gal's government took energetic
measures to prevent the spread of
the infection through preventive
action, care of AIDS patients, and
the mobilization of people at all
levels, including teachers, soldiers,
women, religious leaders and non
governmental organizations. Fur
thermore, Senegal's long experi
ence with democracy and its free
dom of the press made it possible to
openly discuss and easily spread
the word about the dangers of the
epidemic.
Although there is still no cure
for HIV / AIDS, the course of the
disease can be altered by individu
als, communities and nations re
sponding to the threat by encourag
ing effective prevention initiatives
and by finding new ways to fight the
pandemic.
