# Holt's Harangue
## Help! The invasion of the iPod people 
### CHRIS HOLT 
So I finally broke down and got
an iPod. My life is now complete; I
have officially become as lazy as ev
eryone else. We can't manage to
save the rainforest, cure SARS or
come up with a better alternative to
fossil fuel, but dammit, scientists
have insured we can listen to
"Toxic" anywhere, anytime and
with a really cute interface.
The iPod craze is so widespread
that society has created a certain
etiquette around the iPod. You
don't bug people while they are lis
tening to their iPod. I'm not just
talking social taboo here, but a
matter of life or death. IPod listen
ers are in their own little iWorld.
While in this world, they are dan
gerously oblivious to the happen
ings around them.
Here's a math problem for you:
If four people listening to their
iPods were riding towards the in
tersection of death just after 11 a.m.
classes let out, how long would it
take the ambulance to get there?
So in a way, listening to your
iPod is like being in the Matrix. The
iPod users believe they can defy re
ality while listening to their iPod.
Instead of defying gravity, they
defy social conventions by doing
the air-guitar in the middle of a
Great Aunt Betty's funeral.
And similar to the Matrix, if you
try to pull these people out of their
fantasy world, the results could be
disastrous. In their iWorld. they be
lieve they are actually gifted with
rhythm. When they come out of the
iWorld, they are as vulnerable, ex
posed and revolting as Keanu
Reeves in "Much Ado About
Nothing."
Aside from the awkwardness

that the iPod creates, there is the
cute factor I have to overcome. The
iPod — let's face it — is adorable. I
feel like I could put it in a diaper
and write highly inappropriate
jokes about putting it in a blender.
Technology wasn't meant to be
this cute. Look at the other techni
cal innovations that have come to
high acclaim: the toaster (not hug
able, terrible in bath); the Xbox
(looks like an alien toaster); the
atomic bomb (can only be hugged
by nuclear arms); and of course, the
Segway (the only ride where you
are guaranteed to not pick up
women).
That's why the iPod phe
nomenon is so troubling: Just what
are those people at Apple up to? It
seems James Cameron and the Wa
chowski brothers were wrong. The
machines will not take over the
world with evil-looking, armor
plated monstrosities — they will
take over with adorable mp3 play
ers and computers that come in the
color "tangerine."
We'll be so distracted going
"coochy coochy coo" to the iPod
that we overlook how it pick pock
ets us and steals our social security
numbers. The damn little thing al
ready knows my darkest secret:
that I somehow actually like that
stupid Maroon 5 song. With that in
formation, it's that much closer to
world domination.
I can imagine the next time I
open up iTunes there will be on
that easily-readable interface a
cutely typed blackmail note. It'll
say something like "Surrender to
the machines or I'll post your 'Enya
Mix' play list to every punk forum
on the Web."
I'd take a bat to it already but it's
got me beat in that department as

well. The damn thing is so break
able, so innocent looking — it
would be like killing a new born
chick. While that usually isn't a
problem, this one would cost me
$300 dollars.
Not convinced of the threat of
the iPods? Well then look at how
much influence they have on some
of the most brilliant minds in the
country. That's right: They have al
ready taken hold of the fashion in
dustry — iPod covers, iPod socks,
iPod cozies, iPod cheese graters
and iPod bikinis are already on the
market. Paul Frank, Gap and
BMW already have iPod merchan
dise. I wouldn't be surprised if
there were an iPod magazine in the
works, or if some celebrity like
Pink came to an award's show with
an iPod covering each of her huge
breasts. Thanks in a large part to
the accessorizing of the iPod and its
promotion by Bono, the iPod has
become a bit of a sex symbol. But
that just makes me hate it more —
I don't want anything that is going
to get more women then I am.
Surely, if there is ever a time for
Microsoft to launch a less powerful
and infinitely more bug-filled prod
uct to compete with the iPod, this
would be the time. It may crash
every three minutes, be less cute
and pretty much suck, but I see it as
less of a personal threat than any
thing by Apple. Microsoft prod
ucts, thankfully, are too bug-ridden
to ever actually stage a revolution.
So Bill Gates, please get cracking,
because I think my iPod just made
a pass at my girlfriend.

tersection of death just after 11 a.m.
classes let out, how long would it
take the ambulance to get there?
So in a way, listening to your
iPod is like being in the Matrix. The
iPod users believe they can defy re
ality while listening to their iPod.
Instead of defying gravity, they
defy social conventions by doing
the air-guitar in the middle of a
Great Aunt Betty's funeral.
And similar to the Matrix, if you
try to pull these people out of their
fantasy world, the results could be
disastrous. In their iWorld. they be
lieve they are actually gifted with
rhythm. When they come out of the
iWorld, they are as vulnerable, ex
posed and revolting as Keanu
Reeves in "Much Ado About
Nothing."
Aside from the awkwardness

that the iPod creates, there is the
cute factor I have to overcome. The
iPod — let's face it — is adorable. I
feel like I could put it in a diaper
and write highly inappropriate
jokes about putting it in a blender.
Technology wasn't meant to be
this cute. Look at the other techni
cal innovations that have come to
high acclaim: the toaster (not hug
able, terrible in bath); the Xbox
(looks like an alien toaster); the
atomic bomb (can only be hugged
by nuclear arms); and of course, the
Segway (the only ride where you
are guaranteed to not pick up
women).
That's why the iPod phe
nomenon is so troubling: Just what
are those people at Apple up to? It
seems James Cameron and the Wa
chowski brothers were wrong. The
machines will not take over the
world with evil-looking, armor
plated monstrosities — they will
take over with adorable mp3 play
ers and computers that come in the
color "tangerine."
We'll be so distracted going
"coochy coochy coo" to the iPod
that we overlook how it pick pock
ets us and steals our social security
numbers. The damn little thing al
ready knows my darkest secret:
that I somehow actually like that
stupid Maroon 5 song. With that in
formation, it's that much closer to
world domination.
I can imagine the next time I
open up iTunes there will be on
that easily-readable interface a
cutely typed blackmail note. It'll
say something like "Surrender to
the machines or I'll post your 'Enya
Mix' play list to every punk forum
on the Web."
I'd take a bat to it already but it's
got me beat in that department as

well. The damn thing is so break
able, so innocent looking — it
would be like killing a new born
chick. While that usually isn't a
problem, this one would cost me
$300 dollars.
Not convinced of the threat of
the iPods? Well then look at how
much influence they have on some
of the most brilliant minds in the
country. That's right: They have al
ready taken hold of the fashion in
dustry — iPod covers, iPod socks,
iPod cozies, iPod cheese graters
and iPod bikinis are already on the
market. Paul Frank, Gap and
BMW already have iPod merchan
dise. I wouldn't be surprised if
there were an iPod magazine in the
works, or if some celebrity like
Pink came to an award's show with
an iPod covering each of her huge
breasts. Thanks in a large part to
the accessorizing of the iPod and its
promotion by Bono, the iPod has
become a bit of a sex symbol. But
that just makes me hate it more —
I don't want anything that is going
to get more women then I am.
Surely, if there is ever a time for
Microsoft to launch a less powerful
and infinitely more bug-filled prod
uct to compete with the iPod, this
would be the time. It may crash
every three minutes, be less cute
and pretty much suck, but I see it as
less of a personal threat than any
thing by Apple. Microsoft prod
ucts, thankfully, are too bug-ridden
to ever actually stage a revolution.
So Bill Gates, please get cracking,
because I think my iPod just made
a pass at my girlfriend.

So I finally broke down and got
an iPod. My life is now complete; I
have officially become as lazy as ev
eryone else. We can't manage to
save the rainforest, cure SARS or
come up with a better alternative to
fossil fuel, but dammit, scientists
have insured we can listen to
"Toxic" anywhere, anytime and
with a really cute interface.
The iPod craze is so widespread
that society has created a certain
etiquette around the iPod. You
don't bug people while they are lis
tening to their iPod. I'm not just
talking social taboo here, but a
matter of life or death. IPod listen
ers are in their own little iWorld.
While in this world, they are dan
gerously oblivious to the happen
ings around them.
Here's a math problem for you:
