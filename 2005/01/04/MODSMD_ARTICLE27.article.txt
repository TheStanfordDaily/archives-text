## Former Panthers coach Harris will replace Teevens 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After making the difficult but necessary decision to fire
Buddy Teevens on Nov. 29, Stanford Athletics Director Dr.
Ted Leland knew exactly what he wanted in the Cardinal's
next head football coach — experience.
Enter Walt Harris, who was hired Dec. 13 and officially
began his tenure at Stanford yesterday.
"Other than Bill Walsh, Walt is the most experienced and
successful head football coach that Stanford has hired since
Pop Warner in 1924," Leland said. "He has done a fantastic
job at the University of Pittsburgh for the past eight years,
turning their program into one of the nation's perennial bowl
contenders. He is a man of high integrity and character, and
we welcome him into the Stanford community."
Harris, 58, is a South San Francisco native who, in his eight
seasons with Pittsburgh, took the No. 19 Panthers to a Bowl
Championship Series game this year. He grew up in the shad
ow of Stanford's unique football program, and the bespecta
cled man with a creative mind has shown throughout his ca
reer that he can recruit talented players under circumstances

that are somewhat less than ideal. He has a 63-67 lifetime
record, including a 39-23 mark over his past six seasons, and
he says he's ready for the unique challenge that Stanford of
fers.
"It's a huge responsibility to be the head football coach at
such a tremendous academic institution," Harris said. "Our
job as coaches is to do the whole thing. It's not just about ath
letics and winning championships, but molding the whole stu
dent-athlete.
"There's not one person I talked to that can't sing the
praises of this university, and I'm honored to be a part of that.
I couldn't be more thrilled to represent Stanford University
like so many great coaches have in the past."
Harris comes with his own band of praise-singers, includ
ing Jon Gruden, who has won a Super Bowl as coach of the
NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers and got his start when Harris
hired him as a graduate assistant at Tennessee.
"I consider Walt Harris as good a coach as there is in
America," Gruden said. "His track record with quarterbacks,
receivers and offensive football teams is unprecedented, and
his winning percentage at Pitt speaks for itself. Walt is a class
act and Stanford should be proud to have him."

Harris, who is under contract for the next five years, in
herits a workable if not wonderful situation. Stanford went
just 10-23 over the past three seasons, but the players worked
hard under Teevens, a strong recruiter who left behind a tal
ented roster. Nonetheless, Harris isn't going to take it easy
this winter.
"Don't be a college coach if you don't like to recruit," Har
ris said. "To me, recruiting is what it's all about. A coach is a
teacher, and I take pride in the teaching aspects of the job. I
look forward to those opportunities."
Of course, college coaching can be a capricious, circum
stantial calling. Harris' Panthers lost to Utah in the Jan. 1 Fi
esta Bowl, 35-7, thanks to the high-powered offense of Mike
Sanford — the same man who directed Teevens' offense dur
ing the Cardinal's miserable two-win 2002 season. Sanford,
thanks to his success in Salt Lake City, was hired as UNLV's
new coach on Dec. 6, just two years after the Cardinal scored
only 20.5 points per game under his guidance. Success in one
place may not guarantee it in another, particularly for coach
es with limited experience in tough situations.
