## Former Panthers coach Harris will replace Teevens 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After making the difficult but necessary decision to fire
Buddy Teevens on Nov. 29, Stanford Athletics Director Dr.
Ted Leland knew exactly what he wanted in the Cardinal's
next head football coach — experience.
Enter Walt Harris, who was hired Dec. 13 and officially
began his tenure at Stanford yesterday.
"Other than Bill Walsh, Walt is the most experienced and
successful head football coach that Stanford has hired since
Pop Warner in 1924," Leland said. "He has done a fantastic
job at the University of Pittsburgh for the past eight years,
turning their program into one of the nation's perennial bowl
contenders. He is a man of high integrity and character, and
we welcome him into the Stanford community."
Harris, 58, is a South San Francisco native who, in his eight
seasons with Pittsburgh, took the No. 19 Panthers to a Bowl
Championship Series game this year. He grew up in the shad
ow of Stanford's unique football program, and the bespecta
cled man with a creative mind has shown throughout his ca
reer that he can recruit talented players under circumstances

that are somewhat less than ideal. He has a 63-67 lifetime
record, including a 39-23 mark over his past six seasons, and
he says he's ready for the unique challenge that Stanford of
fers.
"It's a huge responsibility to be the head football coach at
such a tremendous academic institution," Harris said. "Our
job as coaches is to do the whole thing. It's not just about ath
letics and winning championships, but molding the whole stu
dent-athlete.
"There's not one person I talked to that can't sing the
praises of this university, and I'm honored to be a part of that.
I couldn't be more thrilled to represent Stanford University
like so many great coaches have in the past."
Harris comes with his own band of praise-singers, includ
ing Jon Gruden, who has won a Super Bowl as coach of the
NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers and got his start when Harris
hired him as a graduate assistant at Tennessee.
"I consider Walt Harris as good a coach as there is in
America," Gruden said. "His track record with quarterbacks,
receivers and offensive football teams is unprecedented, and
his winning percentage at Pitt speaks for itself. Walt is a class
act and Stanford should be proud to have him."

Harris, who is under contract for the next five years, in
herits a workable if not wonderful situation. Stanford went
just 10-23 over the past three seasons, but the players worked
hard under Teevens, a strong recruiter who left behind a tal
ented roster. Nonetheless, Harris isn't going to take it easy
this winter.
"Don't be a college coach if you don't like to recruit," Har
ris said. "To me, recruiting is what it's all about. A coach is a
teacher, and I take pride in the teaching aspects of the job. I
look forward to those opportunities."
Of course, college coaching can be a capricious, circum
stantial calling. Harris' Panthers lost to Utah in the Jan. 1 Fi
esta Bowl, 35-7, thanks to the high-powered offense of Mike
Sanford — the same man who directed Teevens' offense dur
ing the Cardinal's miserable two-win 2002 season. Sanford,
thanks to his success in Salt Lake City, was hired as UNLV's
new coach on Dec. 6, just two years after the Cardinal scored
only 20.5 points per game under his guidance. Success in one
place may not guarantee it in another, particularly for coach
es with limited experience in tough situations.

Walt Harris was named the new head
coach of the Stanford football team on
Dec. 13.
That's precisely why Leland felt it necessary to go
with Harris, who has proven year after year that he
can find a way to score points and win ballgames. Of
course, those coaches can be hard to come by fora
school like Stanford, which has the most stringent aca
demic requirements in the academically indifferent
world of Division l-A football.
But. despite winning the Big East Conference and
leading Pitt to a BCS berth — only eight teams win ;i
BCS berth every year — Harris was on the way out in
Pittsburgh. Though he had much success with the pro
gram. the school refused to offer him a contract ex
tension. His salary at Pitt was $ft(M),(XX), and his pay on
the Farm is believed to be comparable.
As he did with Teevens, Leland has a common
background with Harris and has hired him before.
When Leland was athletic director at Pacific in 1989,
he hired I larris — who earned his bachelor'sand mas
ter's degrees there — to coach the now-defunct pro
gram. After coaching the Tigers 1989-91, Harris was
the quarterbacks coach for the New York Jets 1992-
94. quarterbacks coach at Ohio State 1995-96 and then
served at Pitt 1997-2(K)4. Harris was 47-21-4 as Ten-

nessee's offensive coordinator 1983-1988 and began
his coaching career at South San Francisco's HI
Camino High School (his alma mater) in 1970. He's
also served as an assistant coach for California, Air
Force, Michigan and Illinois.
In other words, Harris has been involved with big
name program after big-name program. And Stanford
believes that Harris' track record — and his ability —
are ironclad.
"I consider Walt to have one of the brightest minds
in football," said Walsh, now a special assistant to Ice
land. "He brings experience, expertise and a level of
success that demonstrate his executive skills. He has
great energy, intensity and a history of winning."
Walsh isn't the only one to vouch for Harris' abili
ty. Harris was named American Football Coaches As
sociation Region I Coach of the Year in 2(X)2.
Harris beat out gifted Southern California offen
sive coordinator Norm Chow for the Stanford job. in
large part because Chow, 58, hasn't been a head coach
since coaching Waialua High School 1970-72.
"I felt we had ;i great candidate pool," Leland said.
"But, 1 felt it was time for us to get an experienced

head coach, one that has had success."
Harris has control over the hiring of his own staff,
but Leland "strongly" recommended that defensive
coordinator A.J. Christoff and special-teams coach
Tom Quinn be retained. Christoff led the Cardinal de
fense to a No. 3 ranking in the Pacific-10 Conference
this year, while Quinn's special teams shined. produc
ing two first-team All-Pac-10 performers.
"1 think I speak on behalf of the team in saying that
there is a lot of support for the current assistant coach
es by the players," Leland said. "I think Walt will take
that into consideration, but it is his staff to assemble."
As for Harris, the Stanford job offers him more
than just another line on his long resume — it gives
him the chance to build a program in his way, near his
hometown.
"It is a homecoming for me, being from South San
Francisco," Harris said. "It's been a long road with
highs and lows, but I've had the honor of coaching a
lot of great football players. It's been all part of the
process, and I'm thankful to be back here coaching at
such a great institution, and I plan to do the job the
best way I know how."
