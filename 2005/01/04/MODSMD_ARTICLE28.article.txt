# Men drop championship to UCLA
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
If seemed as if the championship matchup
between No. 2 Stanford and top-ranked
UCLA could go on forever without either
team pulling away.
But after a regulation and an overtime
battle, the clock ran down too fast for the
Cardinal to score just once more. And so the
NCAA trophy belongs to the Bruins.
When a shot from UCLA's Josh Hewko
bounced off the top bar, teammate Logan
Powell was there for one more play.
"We had three players ejected and I was
the next guy in line to play," Powell said. "I
was in the right place at the right time."
With 13 seconds left in overtime play,
Powell's shot got tipped, touched a couple
hands and ultimately managed to go in.
A stunned Cardinal team had to watch its
opponent celebrate a national championship
at Stanford's home pool for the second year
in a row.
One night after defeating Loyola Mary
mount, Stanford faced UCLA for the fifth time
this season.
With the season series split, and a crowd of
3,044 on hand, the NCAA final was the perfect
stage for one last match.
Stanford took the lead in the first period,
3-2, but by the end of the half the Bruins had
come back to post a 4-5 goal advantage. Their
one-goal lead held up through the end of the
third.
While there was plenty back- and-forth ac
tion the first three periods, the match really
heated up in the fourth.
UCLA's 2(X)4 Olympian Brett Ormsby
opened up the final quarter with a goal but ju
nior driver Peter Varellas pulled the Cardinal
within one.
Azevedo finally posted his first and only
goal of the night to tie the game at 7-7, but
regulation time ran out before either team
could notch a game-winner.
As the players lined up for overtime, the
Cardinal urged the boisterous crowd to make
noise.
With the support of the spectators, the
Stanford squad took advantage of the ab
sence of three Bruin players who had fouled
out — Jacobs, Chris Pulido and Albert Gar
cia, who scored twice in the match. A shot by
Hopkins skipped in for the lead.
Ormsby, however, followed up with his
second goal and the match was tied again.
With 1:54 in the second period of over
time, Hopkins passed across the pool to
Varellas, who shot the ball cross-cage for his
third goal.
The Bruins answered less than a minute
later to tie it up again at 9-9.

The Bruins' game plan seemed to be to
double or triple-team Azevedo. But even
when left alone though, the three-time Player
of the Year struggled with his shots.
"The ball wouldn't go in the goal today."
Azevedo said. "A lot of my shots weren't
going where I wanted them to go."
"Congratulations to UCLA," said Stan
ford head coach John Vargas. "UCLA did a
very nice job. Clearly UCLA's focus was to
stop Tony.
"Where we tried to post up, there were
two or three players on him. UCLA is talent
ed. They threw a lot of guys at us. We tried to

control the tempo of the game and take away
their counterattack."
Bruins goalkeeper Joseph Axelrad was
tremendous in preventing the Cardinal of
fense from stringing together a couple goals.
Yet even with eight saves in the game, the se
nior credited his teammates with being able to
hold Azevedo to one goal.
"Part of UCLA water polo is placing a
huge premium on defense," said Axelrad.
"Stanford played fantastic offense, but our
defense was up to the challenge. I can't give
enough credit to our guys."
He was particularly impressed by the Bru

ins' performance against the Cardinal's star
player.
"We played fantastic defense against
Tony [Azevedo]," he said.
Going into overtime, the Bruins felt they
had the advantage. Axelrad called it "more
gas in the tank."
Whatever it was, UCLA's depth got to
Stanford in the final seconds of the game.
"That was one of the most courageous ef
forts I have ever coached, and maybe even
seen as a sports fan," said UCLA head coach
Adam Krikorian about his team. "Our guys

are in incredible physical condition. I worked
them extremely hard for two years. It is a testa
ment to their courage today."
Azevedo and Hopkins, who led the league
in scoring, earned First-Team All-American
honors. Azevedo, Crum, Hopkins and Varellas
were also named to the NCAA All-Tourna
ment men's team.
Despite the loss, Vargas was pleased by his
team's effort and the legacy of his accom
plished senior class.
"I was proud of our guys and how they
played all season," Vargas said. "They played
with a lot of heart. Our seniors have had an un
believable career at Stanford, and I'm proud to
be a part of their careers."
The Stanford squad is already looking to
make another run fora championship next sea
son, but it will have to do it without five seniors,
including Azevedo.
How far the team can go without Azevedo,
who signed a record-making contract with
Italy, is likely to be the question on many minds
this off-season.

team's effort and the legacy of his accom
plished senior class.
"I was proud of our guys and how they
played all season," Vargas said. "They played
with a lot of heart. Our seniors have had an un
believable career at Stanford, and I'm proud to
be a part of their careers."
The Stanford squad is already looking to
make another run fora championship next sea
son, but it will have to do it without five seniors,
including Azevedo.
How far the team can go without Azevedo,
who signed a record-making contract with
Italy, is likely to be the question on many minds
this off-season.
If seemed as if the championship matchup
between No. 2 Stanford and top-ranked
UCLA could go on forever without either
team pulling away.
But after a regulation and an overtime
battle, the clock ran down too fast for the
Cardinal to score just once more. And so the
NCAA trophy belongs to the Bruins.
When a shot from UCLA's Josh Hewko
bounced off the top bar, teammate Logan
Powell was there for one more play.
"We had three players ejected and I was
the next guy in line to play," Powell said. "I
was in the right place at the right time."
With 13 seconds left in overtime play,
Powell's shot got tipped, touched a couple
hands and ultimately managed to go in.
A stunned Cardinal team had to watch its
opponent celebrate a national championship
at Stanford's home pool for the second year
in a row.
One night after defeating Loyola Mary
mount, Stanford faced UCLA for the fifth time
this season.
With the season series split, and a crowd of
3,044 on hand, the NCAA final was the perfect
stage for one last match.
Stanford took the lead in the first period,
3-2, but by the end of the half the Bruins had
come back to post a 4-5 goal advantage. Their
one-goal lead held up through the end of the
third.
While there was plenty back- and-forth ac
tion the first three periods, the match really
heated up in the fourth.
UCLA's 2(X)4 Olympian Brett Ormsby
opened up the final quarter with a goal but ju
nior driver Peter Varellas pulled the Cardinal
within one.
Azevedo finally posted his first and only
goal of the night to tie the game at 7-7, but
regulation time ran out before either team
could notch a game-winner.
As the players lined up for overtime, the
Cardinal urged the boisterous crowd to make
noise.
With the support of the spectators, the
Stanford squad took advantage of the ab
sence of three Bruin players who had fouled
out — Jacobs, Chris Pulido and Albert Gar
cia, who scored twice in the match. A shot by
Hopkins skipped in for the lead.
Ormsby, however, followed up with his
second goal and the match was tied again.
With 1:54 in the second period of over
time, Hopkins passed across the pool to
Varellas, who shot the ball cross-cage for his
third goal.
The Bruins answered less than a minute
later to tie it up again at 9-9.

The Bruins' game plan seemed to be to
double or triple-team Azevedo. But even
when left alone though, the three-time Player
of the Year struggled with his shots.
"The ball wouldn't go in the goal today."
Azevedo said. "A lot of my shots weren't
going where I wanted them to go."
"Congratulations to UCLA," said Stan
ford head coach John Vargas. "UCLA did a
very nice job. Clearly UCLA's focus was to
stop Tony.
"Where we tried to post up, there were
two or three players on him. UCLA is talent
ed. They threw a lot of guys at us. We tried to

control the tempo of the game and take away
their counterattack."
Bruins goalkeeper Joseph Axelrad was
tremendous in preventing the Cardinal of
fense from stringing together a couple goals.
Yet even with eight saves in the game, the se
nior credited his teammates with being able to
hold Azevedo to one goal.
"Part of UCLA water polo is placing a
huge premium on defense," said Axelrad.
"Stanford played fantastic offense, but our
defense was up to the challenge. I can't give
enough credit to our guys."
He was particularly impressed by the Bru

ins' performance against the Cardinal's star
player.
"We played fantastic defense against
Tony [Azevedo]," he said.
Going into overtime, the Bruins felt they
had the advantage. Axelrad called it "more
gas in the tank."
Whatever it was, UCLA's depth got to
Stanford in the final seconds of the game.
"That was one of the most courageous ef
forts I have ever coached, and maybe even
seen as a sports fan," said UCLA head coach
Adam Krikorian about his team. "Our guys

are in incredible physical condition. I worked
them extremely hard for two years. It is a testa
ment to their courage today."
Azevedo and Hopkins, who led the league
in scoring, earned First-Team All-American
honors. Azevedo, Crum, Hopkins and Varellas
were also named to the NCAA All-Tourna
