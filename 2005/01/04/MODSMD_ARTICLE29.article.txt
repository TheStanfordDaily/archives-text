## Coach Walt may be the man with the plan for Card 
### 
Amidst the swirling blizzard of col
lege coaching changes that swept
through the nation while we were
away on winter break, Stanford
hired a new football guru to replace Buddy
Teevens.
It wasn't Norm Chow, (JSC's prolific offen
sive coordinator, who was at the top of many

Stanford fans' Christmas
wish lists. Chow, whose of
fensive genius has helped
lead the Trojans to two con
secutive national title game
appearances, interviewed
here but was not hired. In the
end, he was not courted for
other high-profile jobs and
will likely remain on the
USC sideline next year.
Instead of Chow, Stan
ford got Walt Harris.

Who is Walt Harris? His name doesn't have
the instant recognition that accompanies other
names bounded about in the flurry of hirings
and firings over the past month. He doesn't get
accolades like Chow, whose proteges have
won two of the last three Heisman Trophies.
He is not a media darling like Tyrone Will
ingham, who will make his return to the Pac-10
in 2005 with Washington. He doesn't shine in
the bright lights like Nick Saban, who will
coach on Sundays next year from his new resi
dence in South Beach.
And yet, Harris might be just the right man
to turn around the woeful Stanford program.
I know about Walt Harris. I moved to Pitts
burgh two years before he took over as head
coach of the Panthers and saved a storied pro
gram. I saw him transform a squad mired in
mediocrity into bowl game regulars and Big
East champions.
Before Walt Harris, the Pitt Panthers
would cakewalk through the patsies in
September only to be exposed by Miami, Syra
cuse and the Big East big boys in the second
half of the season. (Sound familiar?)
Before Walt Harris, Pitt hadn't produced
an NFL-caliber quarterback since Dan Marino
headlined an all-star cast from 1979-1982.
(John Elway, anyone?)
Before Walt Harris, Panther fans were
forced to sit through an agonizing decade-long
bowl drought. And current players weren't
