## Coach Walt may be the man with the plan for Card 
### 
Amidst the swirling blizzard of col
lege coaching changes that swept
through the nation while we were
away on winter break, Stanford
hired a new football guru to replace Buddy
Teevens.
It wasn't Norm Chow, (JSC's prolific offen
sive coordinator, who was at the top of many

Stanford fans' Christmas
wish lists. Chow, whose of
fensive genius has helped
lead the Trojans to two con
secutive national title game
appearances, interviewed
here but was not hired. In the
end, he was not courted for
other high-profile jobs and
will likely remain on the
USC sideline next year.
Instead of Chow, Stan
ford got Walt Harris.

Who is Walt Harris? His name doesn't have
the instant recognition that accompanies other
names bounded about in the flurry of hirings
and firings over the past month. He doesn't get
accolades like Chow, whose proteges have
won two of the last three Heisman Trophies.
He is not a media darling like Tyrone Will
ingham, who will make his return to the Pac-10
in 2005 with Washington. He doesn't shine in
the bright lights like Nick Saban, who will
coach on Sundays next year from his new resi
dence in South Beach.
And yet, Harris might be just the right man
to turn around the woeful Stanford program.
I know about Walt Harris. I moved to Pitts
burgh two years before he took over as head
coach of the Panthers and saved a storied pro
gram. I saw him transform a squad mired in
mediocrity into bowl game regulars and Big
East champions.
Before Walt Harris, the Pitt Panthers
would cakewalk through the patsies in
September only to be exposed by Miami, Syra
cuse and the Big East big boys in the second
half of the season. (Sound familiar?)
Before Walt Harris, Pitt hadn't produced
an NFL-caliber quarterback since Dan Marino
headlined an all-star cast from 1979-1982.
(John Elway, anyone?)
Before Walt Harris, Panther fans were
forced to sit through an agonizing decade-long
bowl drought. And current players weren't

even alive the last time the team
hoisted a conference championship
trophy. (Thankfully we're not there
yet!)
Pittsburgh is not Stanford, and
Big East football is not Pac-10 foot
ball, but I think Walt Harris will suc
ceed on the farm. Here's why:
One of the hallmarks of Harris'
Panther teams was a fearsome and
dominating ground game that con
trolled the football and crushed op
ponents. This offense thrived on a
strong, well-coached offensive line
that was tough enough to win the
battle of the trenches.
Look no farther than USC and
Cal to see how a team with a strong
running game will have its way
against the weak defenses of Pac-10
rivals.
Harris' Pitt teams also knew how
to play finesse. West Coast style
football. Skill players blossomed
under Harris, who seems to have a
real gift in developing talented ath

letes. Pitt players have won the Bilet
nikoff Award for the nation's top re
ceiver twice since 2000 (Antonio
Bryant and Larry Fitzgerald).
Stanford has no dearth of athletes
just waiting fora coach to tap their
potential.
And since Stanford will always be
a quarterback's school, Harris' expe
rience as a quarterback coach will
help lure strong-armed recruits to
the farm. In his career he has men
tored 14 NFL signal-callers. Under
Harris' tutelage, Pitt's Rod Ruther
ford and Tyler Palko became top
tier college quarterbacks. Trent Ed
wards has more raw talent than ei
ther of those two, and I have no
doubt that he will benefit from his
new coach's experience.
Harris also cares about his play
ers' education. Last year the Pan
thers graduated 15 of 19 seniors, and
they have led the Big East in all-aca
demic team nominations the past
four years. This shows that Harris

Harris a good fit for QBs
and Stanford academics

should be able to win under Stan
ford's strict academic requirements.
(A recent study found that of all the
2004 bowl-bound teams, Pittsburgh
ranked last with a 31 percent player
graduation rate. However, the data
comes from the four years prior to
Harris' arrival.)
There are still questions that re
main unanswered and causes for
concern. Pitt looked downright mis
erable in its Fiesta Bowl fiasco
against Utah last week. And Stan
ford has huge gaps to fill, both in tal
ent and confidence, if it hopes to
compete immediately.
Hiring Harris is no guarantee of
success, but it is one giant step in the
right direction.
