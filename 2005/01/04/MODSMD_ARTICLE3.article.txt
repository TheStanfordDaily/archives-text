### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With $994 million raised as of Nov. 30,
the five-year Campaign for Undergraduate
Education is expected to reach its $1 billion
goal almost a year ahead of schedule. Even
so, University officials will continue to ac
tively promote the campaign until its Dec.
31, 2005 end date.
"CUE has been an enormous success,
but we'll never be done supporting under
graduate education," said John Bravman,
the vice provost for undergraduate educa
tion. "Those needs are perpetual."
The vice president of development,
John Ford, echoed Bravman's assessment
of the campaign.
"In our more optimistic moments, we
had anticipated meeting the goal early, but
we always said we would keep going be
cause there would always be areas that
were not fully funded," Ford said.
"But you can imagine how thrilled we
are to have accomplished what we have a
year early," he added.
Ford also said there were strategic rea
sons for continuing the campaign.
"Our plan was always to have five full

public years of the campaign so that every
class could experience a reunion during
CUE. The 'Os' and '5s 1 needed the cam
paign to run from 2000-2005 to have that
experience," he said.
The $1 billion campaign has four major
components. Three hundred million dol
lars is tunneled to each of three programs:
endowed scholarships, the Stanford En
dowment for Undergraduate Education
and undergraduate programs across the
University. The remaining $100 million is
earmarked for the Stanford Fund. The
Stanford Fund funds the majority of non
endowment programs for undergraduates
at Stanford.
Over 80 percent of the total money
raised will be added to the endowment.
Non-endowment programs funded by
CUE include the Overseas Studies Pro
gram, Honors College, and freshman and
sophomore seminars.
Bravman emphasized the impact of
CUE's non-endowment or expendable
funding, which supports academic pro
grams and financial aid.
"We wanted to raise enough in expend-
