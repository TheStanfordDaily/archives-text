# CUE nears $1 billion mark one year early

### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With $994 million raised as of Nov. 30,
the five-year Campaign for Undergraduate
Education is expected to reach its $1 billion
goal almost a year ahead of schedule. Even
so, University officials will continue to ac
tively promote the campaign until its Dec.
31, 2005 end date.
"CUE has been an enormous success,
but we'll never be done supporting under
graduate education," said John Bravman,
the vice provost for undergraduate educa
tion. "Those needs are perpetual."
The vice president of development,
John Ford, echoed Bravman's assessment
of the campaign.
"In our more optimistic moments, we
had anticipated meeting the goal early, but
we always said we would keep going be
cause there would always be areas that
were not fully funded," Ford said.
"But you can imagine how thrilled we
are to have accomplished what we have a
year early," he added.
Ford also said there were strategic rea
sons for continuing the campaign.
"Our plan was always to have five full

public years of the campaign so that every
class could experience a reunion during
CUE. The 'Os' and '5s 1 needed the cam
paign to run from 2000-2005 to have that
experience," he said.
The $1 billion campaign has four major
components. Three hundred million dol
lars is tunneled to each of three programs:
endowed scholarships, the Stanford En
dowment for Undergraduate Education
and undergraduate programs across the
University. The remaining $100 million is
earmarked for the Stanford Fund. The
Stanford Fund funds the majority of non
endowment programs for undergraduates
at Stanford.
Over 80 percent of the total money
raised will be added to the endowment.
Non-endowment programs funded by
CUE include the Overseas Studies Pro
gram, Honors College, and freshman and
sophomore seminars.
Bravman emphasized the impact of
CUE's non-endowment or expendable
funding, which supports academic pro
grams and financial aid.
"We wanted to raise enough in expend-

able funding to make sure that our
undergraduate programs would
never run out of money. In particu
lar, the freshman and sophomore
seminars program will never end
for financial reasons," he said.
"Undergraduate financial aid is
another major piece of the cam
paign," Bravman continued.
"Stanford has need-blind ad
missions and a commitment to
meeting the needs of its students.
That takes $70 to $90 million a
year; only one third of that comes
from endowment payout. The rest
has to he raised every year."
Ford praised Stanford's acade
mic faculty for skillfully crafting
CUE years before its inception.
"At the core, really good acade
mic decisions were responsible for
CUE's success," he said.
"I give all the credit to the acad

eniic leaders — the presidents,
provosts, deans and faculty — who
figured out in the '90s what
changes needed to be made to
strengthen Stanford's academic
programs," Ford added.
The idea for the campaign origi
nated in 1993 under the leadership
of then-president Gerhard Casper,
who appointed a Commission on
Undergraduate Education to re
view the undergraduate experi
ence at Stanford.
The commission concluded that
"the most important aim of under
graduate education is to involve
students in the search for knowl
edge, where teaching and learning,
instruction and research, and the
communication and discovery of
knowledge are combined in a sin
gle enterprise."
After years of planning. CUE

The following May, the Hewlett
Foundation donated $400 million
for undergraduate education at
Stanford, $100 million of which
went to the Campaign.
CUE contributed to a huge
fundraising effort for Stanford last
year. Giving topped $524 million in
2003-04, the second-highest in
Stanford's history and close to an 8
percent increase over the previous
year.
Ford said the University is al
ready gearing up for another major
fundraising campaign after CUE is
finished that will extend to gradu
ate education as well,
"Our next big effort is going to
involve the entire university, not
just undergraduate education," he
said.
