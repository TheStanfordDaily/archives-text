While most Stanford students headed
home for the holidays, the No. 5 Stanford
women's basketball team hit the road.
Playing five away and one home con
test over the break, the Cardinal went 4-2.
The team dropped its first two contests of
the season, a heartbreaker to No. 8 Ten
nessee in Knoxville and an upset loss in
Eugene, Ore. to Pacific-10 Conference
rival Oregon.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal received
more than coal in their stockings this hol
iday season. In Stanford's four wins, its av
erage margin of victory was 29 points. The
Cardinal's defense continued to suffocate
its weaker opponents, as it held both Ore
gon State and Washington State to under
50 points.
Stanford continued its excellent play
just across the bay with an 80-51 victory
over the University of San Francisco at

War Memorial Gym. The Cardinal domi
nated an outmanned San Francisco squad
with excellent guard play.
Freshman sensation Candice Wiggins
led all scorers with 22 points, while senior
Kelley Suminski contributed 15 points on
5-7 shooting from the field. At the defen
sive end of the court, Stanford forced San
Francisco into 21 turnovers, led by Wig
gins's four steals.
On Dec. 18, Stanford traveled to
Columbia, Mo. to take on the Lady Tigers
of Missouri. Despite an excellent effort
from the young Missouri team, Stanford's
perimeter shooting was too much to han
dle, and the Cardinal cruised to a 71-55
victory that wasn't as close as the score.
The Lady Tigers stayed within striking
distance in the first half, thanks in part to
a sloppy Stanford offense that committed
19 turnovers on the night. But the Cardi
nal took control in the second half. Stan-
