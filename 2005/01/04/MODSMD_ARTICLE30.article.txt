## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While most Stanford students headed
home for the holidays, the No. 5 Stanford
women's basketball team hit the road.
Playing five away and one home con
test over the break, the Cardinal went 4-2.
The team dropped its first two contests of
the season, a heartbreaker to No. 8 Ten
nessee in Knoxville and an upset loss in
Eugene, Ore. to Pacific-10 Conference
rival Oregon.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal received
more than coal in their stockings this hol
iday season. In Stanford's four wins, its av
erage margin of victory was 29 points. The
Cardinal's defense continued to suffocate
its weaker opponents, as it held both Ore
gon State and Washington State to under
50 points.
Stanford continued its excellent play
just across the bay with an 80-51 victory
over the University of San Francisco at

War Memorial Gym. The Cardinal domi
nated an outmanned San Francisco squad
with excellent guard play.
Freshman sensation Candice Wiggins
led all scorers with 22 points, while senior
Kelley Suminski contributed 15 points on
5-7 shooting from the field. At the defen
sive end of the court, Stanford forced San
Francisco into 21 turnovers, led by Wig
gins's four steals.
On Dec. 18, Stanford traveled to
Columbia, Mo. to take on the Lady Tigers
of Missouri. Despite an excellent effort
from the young Missouri team, Stanford's
perimeter shooting was too much to han
dle, and the Cardinal cruised to a 71-55
victory that wasn't as close as the score.
The Lady Tigers stayed within striking
distance in the first half, thanks in part to
a sloppy Stanford offense that committed
19 turnovers on the night. But the Cardi
nal took control in the second half. Stan-

ford dominated both inside and on
the perimeter, pushing its 29-21
halftimc advantage to 60-31 with 10
minutes remaining in the game.
Four Stanford players scored in
double digits, led by junior Brooke
Smith's 16 points. Suminski chipped
in 13 and spread the wealth to her
teammates with four assists.
With two wins secured, the Cardi
nal headed to Knoxville, Tenn. on
Dec. 21. hoping fora rare victory
over the Volunteers. Unfortunately,
coach Pat Summit's troops held off
yet another talented Stanford team,
70-67. in what has become an annual
torment for Cardinal faithful.
In a game that was a statistical
deadlock, Stanford battled back
from an 11-point deficit to tie the
game at 67 on a Suminski three
pointer with eight seconds left on
the clock.
Summit was about to call a time
out to set up a final shot but stopped
when she saw guard Shanna Zol
man racing up the court to launch a
desperation shot from long range.
Zolman's shot hit its mark with just
two seconds left, dealing Stanford
its first loss of the season.
"It was a great game." Stanford

head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"Honestly, 1 think you saw an
NCAA Tournament game. This is
what it is like in the tournament."
On Dec. 27, the Cardinal
bounced back for their first Pac-1()
game of the season, a 83-45 trounc
ing of Oregon State in Corvallis,
Ore. The game also marked the be
ginning of Susan King Borchardt's
season. The fifth-year senior played
five minutes and was 1 -of-2 from the
field after a stress reaction in her
foot sidelined her in the preseason.
Senior forward Sebnem Kimya
cioglu. who notched 10 assists to go
along with 10 points, dominated the
Beavers. It was the first double-dou
ble of the season fora Stanford play
er and the first of her career.
After its impressive performance
against the Beavers, Stanford stum
bled just two days later against Ore
gon, falling 62-58 to a Duck team
that refused to give in to the Cardi
nal's stingy defense.
Oregon turned the ball over just
eight times, the fewest of any Stan
ford opponent this year. Mean
while, the Cardinal struggled
through a brutal shooting night in
which thev were l-of-9 from beyond

Beavers and Cougars

the arc in the first half. Overall,
Stanford shot less than 34 percent
from the field.
Though the Cardinal took a 29-
22 lead into the locker room at half
time, Oregon charged back in the
second half, taking the lead with five
minutes left. The Ducks never
looked back.
Sunday, Stanford got to cele
brate the new year at home with a
dominating 72-39 victory over
Washington State. Stanford contin
ued its win streak against the
Cougars, who have never beaten the
Cardinal in the 39 meetings between
the two teams. Smith led the way
with 19 points, and Wiggins added
12 in a game that was over by half
time.
"I thought we did a good job de
fensively." Washington State coach
Sherri Murrell said. "But they are so
darn good. It's like a garden hose.
Once you think you've stopped one
leak, out pops another one."
Stanford will try to throw some
water on the Washington Huskies
when they visit Maples today. Next
weekend, the Cardinal will travel to
the desert to do battle with No. 25
Arizona and No. 23 Arizona State.

what it is like in the tournament."
On Dec. 27, the Cardinal
bounced back for their first Pac-1()
game of the season, a 83-45 trounc
ing of Oregon State in Corvallis,
Ore. The game also marked the be
ginning of Susan King Borchardt's
season. The fifth-year senior played
five minutes and was 1 -of-2 from the
field after a stress reaction in her
foot sidelined her in the preseason.
Senior forward Sebnem Kimya
cioglu. who notched 10 assists to go
along with 10 points, dominated the
Beavers. It was the first double-dou
ble of the season fora Stanford play
er and the first of her career.
After its impressive performance
against the Beavers, Stanford stum
bled just two days later against Ore
gon, falling 62-58 to a Duck team
that refused to give in to the Cardi
nal's stingy defense.
Oregon turned the ball over just
eight times, the fewest of any Stan
ford opponent this year. Mean
while, the Cardinal struggled
through a brutal shooting night in
which thev were l-of-9 from beyond

the arc in the first half. Overall,
Stanford shot less than 34 percent
from the field.
Though the Cardinal took a 29-
22 lead into the locker room at half
time, Oregon charged back in the
second half, taking the lead with five
minutes left. The Ducks never
looked back.
Sunday, Stanford got to cele
brate the new year at home with a
dominating 72-39 victory over
Washington State. Stanford contin
ued its win streak against the
Cougars, who have never beaten the
Cardinal in the 39 meetings between
the two teams. Smith led the way
with 19 points, and Wiggins added
12 in a game that was over by half
time.
"I thought we did a good job de
fensively." Washington State coach
Sherri Murrell said. "But they are so
darn good. It's like a garden hose.
Once you think you've stopped one
leak, out pops another one."
Stanford will try to throw some
water on the Washington Huskies
when they visit Maples today. Next
weekend, the Cardinal will travel to
the desert to do battle with No. 25
Arizona and No. 23 Arizona State.
While most Stanford students headed
home for the holidays, the No. 5 Stanford
women's basketball team hit the road.
Playing five away and one home con
test over the break, the Cardinal went 4-2.
The team dropped its first two contests of
the season, a heartbreaker to No. 8 Ten
nessee in Knoxville and an upset loss in
Eugene, Ore. to Pacific-10 Conference
rival Oregon.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal received
more than coal in their stockings this hol
iday season. In Stanford's four wins, its av
erage margin of victory was 29 points. The
Cardinal's defense continued to suffocate
its weaker opponents, as it held both Ore
gon State and Washington State to under
50 points.
Stanford continued its excellent play
just across the bay with an 80-51 victory
over the University of San Francisco at

War Memorial Gym. The Cardinal domi
nated an outmanned San Francisco squad
with excellent guard play.
Freshman sensation Candice Wiggins
led all scorers with 22 points, while senior
Kelley Suminski contributed 15 points on
5-7 shooting from the field. At the defen
sive end of the court, Stanford forced San
Francisco into 21 turnovers, led by Wig
gins's four steals.
On Dec. 18, Stanford traveled to
Columbia, Mo. to take on the Lady Tigers
of Missouri. Despite an excellent effort
from the young Missouri team, Stanford's
perimeter shooting was too much to han
dle, and the Cardinal cruised to a 71-55
victory that wasn't as close as the score.
The Lady Tigers stayed within striking
distance in the first half, thanks in part to
a sloppy Stanford offense that committed
19 turnovers on the night. But the Cardi
nal took control in the second half. Stan-

Four Stanford players scored in
double digits, led by junior Brooke
Smith's 16 points. Suminski chipped
in 13 and spread the wealth to her
teammates with four assists.
With two wins secured, the Cardi
nal headed to Knoxville, Tenn. on
Dec. 21. hoping fora rare victory
over the Volunteers. Unfortunately,
coach Pat Summit's troops held off
yet another talented Stanford team,
70-67. in what has become an annual
torment for Cardinal faithful.
In a game that was a statistical
deadlock, Stanford battled back
from an 11-point deficit to tie the
game at 67 on a Suminski three
pointer with eight seconds left on
the clock.
Summit was about to call a time
out to set up a final shot but stopped
when she saw guard Shanna Zol
man racing up the court to launch a
desperation shot from long range.
Zolman's shot hit its mark with just
two seconds left, dealing Stanford
its first loss of the season.
