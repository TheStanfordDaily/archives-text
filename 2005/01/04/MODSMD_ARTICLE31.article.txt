# Gentry notches 57th straight win, leads team
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal wrestlers (1-1,0-1 Pacific-10
Conference) trained and competed for most
of the vacation. The team hit the mat in two
open tournaments against many elite
wrestling teams, and senior Matt Gentry led
the way in both.
Holiday highlights for the team included
two tournament championships for Gentry,
who continues to add to his Stanford record
consecutive win streak (57), further cement
ing his place as one of the nation's premier
wrestlers.
Stanford sent 10 wrestlers to Reno. Nev.
on Dec. 18 for the Tournament of Champi
ons and placed eighth as a team out of a field
of 18 teams. The field included many future
opponents — Arizona State, UC-Davis and
Oregon among others.
Oklahoma State won top honors at the
tournament with a high combined score of
163.50. The Cardinal squad consisted of se

nior Nathan Peterson at 125 lbs., juniors Luis
Vendrell and Chris Hayworth at 141, 149-
pound freshman Josh Zupancic, 157-
pounder Gentry, 165-pound freshman Scott
Loescher, 165-pound sophomore Brian
Perry, 174-pound junior Imad Kharbush,
184-pound junior Ryan Hagen. 197 sopho
more lan Bork, and 287-pound junior Shawn
Ritzenhaler.
The star of the tournament was the
NCAA defending champion, Gentry, who
coasted through his first four matches only to
be locked in an epic battle with Arizona
State's Brian Stith. After regulation ended in
a 1-1 tie. Gentry was able to garner his 54th
straight win by riding Stith in the first half of
the tiebreaker and then recording an escape
for the 2-1 win. Gentry will see Stith again on
Feb. 5 when the Sun Devils travel to the
Farm fora dual meet. The rematch promis
es to be an exciting one.
Stanford had two other place-winners, as
Loescher and Peterson took fifth and sixth, re
spectively. Loescher earned an impressive 5-2
mark with two pins and two minor decisions.
One of Loescher's losses came against Brody
Barrios from Cal Poly in an 8-3 decision. Loesch
er will get an opportunity for redemption as Cal
Poly comes to Stanford on Feb. 9. Peterson's
route to sixth place included two decisions and a
major decision.
Unfortunately the team was not able to avoid
injuries entirely, as Kharbush broke his nose in
the tournament and had to withdraw, though the
injury is not seen as serious. Also, Vendrell in
jured his knee forcing him to leave competition.
The Cardinal traveled with a team of six
wrestlers to Evanston, 111. on Dec. 30 for the Mid
lands Tournament. The team consisted of 125-
pound sophomore Tanner Gardner, who wres
tled unattached, 149-pound Ray Blake, Gentry,
Hayworth, Hagen and Loescher. Stanford

notched a 16th place finish out of 50 teams with
26 points. Illinois defended its title from last
years with 130.5 points in one of the tournaments
well known for the stiff competition it provides
for the top club and collegiate wrestlers.
All Cardinal wrestlers except for Gentry lost
their first match. Blake and Loescher were able
to each record one win, while Tanner Gardner
went 2-2 in the double-elimination tournament.
Gentry continued his dominance as he took
the title at 157. He went 6-0 over the two days,
which included five decisions and a 16-0 techni
cal fall in a rematch against San Francisco State's
Jaime Alvarez.
The toughest test for Gentry was a familiar
foe, Jeremiah Jarvis, a UC-Davis graduate
wrestling for the Dave Schultz Wrestling Club.
Gentry squeaked out his third straight win
against Jarvis in a razor thin 9-8 decision in the
quarterfinals.

After winning the close call. Gentry earned
the title with an 8-1 win against Alex Tirapelle of
Illinois in the finals.
Gentry's efforts over the season and in the
tournament were rewarded as the Stanford
wrestler added two more trophies to his ever-ex
panding list. He won the Dan Gable Outstanding
Wrestler award for winning in the most challeng
ing weight-class. Gentry was also awarded the Art
Kraft Champion of Champions award given for
sportsmanship and contribution to the sport.
Things will not get any easier for the Cardinal
as Stanford will travel to Texas this Saturday for
the Lone Star Duals against powerhouse Michi
gan, Harvard and Air Force. The past tourna
ments have given invaluable experience to the
team, but the impact of the dings and injuries of
the past couple weeks will be tested as Stanford's
dual season is hits full stride.

also took home the Dan Gable Outstanding Wrestler award.
