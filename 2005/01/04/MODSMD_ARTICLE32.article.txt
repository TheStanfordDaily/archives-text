# Stanford basketball wins four, drops three over holidays
## Cardinal start Pac-10 season with back-to-back losses 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
In a weekend that was indicative of its inconsistent
season so far, the men's basketball team took a step
backward and a small step forward in Washington. The
Cardinal came out of the trip perhaps with a better
team identity, but with two losses in the Pacific-10 Con
ference as well.
Stanford hung tough in a 76-73 loss to No. 13 Wash
ington on Sunday, two days after a 60-51 setback at
Washington State. The Cardinal (6-6, 0-2 Pac-10)
mounted a comeback and had a chance to tie in the
final seconds, but Nick Robinson's three-point attempt
fell short, allowing the Huskies (12-1.2-0 Pac-10) toes
cape with a victory. Stanford, the two-time defending
conference champion, had not lost its first two Pac-10
games since the IWO-91 season.
The Cardinal were able to hold explosive Washing
ton guard Nate Robinson to 10 points, but the Huskies
got a career-high 17 points from forward Mike Jensen,
and guard Tre Simmons also scored 17. Junior guards
Chris Hernandez and Dan Grunfeld led Stanford with
15 points apiece.
The Cardinal used a smaller lineup to match Wash
ington's speed, benching senior center Rob Little and
starting redshirt freshman Tim Morris, a shooting
guard. Stanford was out-rebounded, 35-29, by a small

er Washington State team on Friday, but oddly enough,
the lineup switch actually seemed to help Stanford on
the glass. The Cardinal out-rebounded the Huskies,
and a more energetic Little came off the bench to pull
down 10 boards.
It looked as if the Cardinal were about to be buried
when they fell behind by 11 points midway through the
second half, but they fought back with a 16-2 run before
the Huskies took the lead for good.
That run — along with the emergence of Morris,
who scored a total of 21 points in the two games —
might be the silver lining the team takes from an other
wise forgettable weekend.
"We had a really good feeling from this game," Lit
tle said. "It felt like it was the first time we played as a
team, sharing the ball."
Stanford scored only 15 points in a sluggish first half
against Washington State before the Cougars (6-5, 1-1
Pac-10) pulled away with some clutch three-point shoot
ing down the stretch. Washington State center Jeff
Varem scored all 18 of his points in the second half and
grabbed 12 rebounds in the game, while holding Little
scoreless. Dan Grunfeld led Stanford with 18 points.
The Cardinal's lack of offensive aggressiveness is
still a concern. The team shot only nine free throws in
both games; Washington and Washington State com
bined to shoot 49.
"A lot of things happened out there that were
very, very frustrating for me," head coach Trent
Johnson said after the Washington game. "They
were able to get to the rim and the free-throw line;
we just were not."


Senior Chris Hernandez led the Cardinal with 15
points in the loss to Washington.
