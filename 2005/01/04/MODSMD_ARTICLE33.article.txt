### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Dec. 11: Michigan Stale 78, Stanford 53
For 10 minutes at the Palace of Auburn Hills, Stanford
played the aggressive type of basketball head coach Trent
Johnson has preached throughout his coaching career. But
for the next 30, the No. 20 Spartans were the aggressors as
Stanford dropped its third straight. The Cardinal led 13-6
after converting five Michigan State turnovers into 11
points, but the Spartans rebounded from a 2-for-13 start
from the field with an 18-4 run to take a nine-point lead into
halftime. Haryasz led the Cardinal with 12 points, while
Grunfeld was held to just six points on 2-for-8 shooting.
Dec. 13: Stanford 56, Denver 52
Known more for their hockey than their hoops, the Pi
oneers gave the Cardinal all they could handle in the
Mile High City, clawing their way back from a 23-9 deficit
to take a one-point lead with just over two minutes to
play. Rodney Billups, the younger brother of Detroit Pis
tons point guard Chauncey Billups, led the Pioners with
18 points. He had a chance to make it an even 20 and give
Denver the lead back, but Little blocked his layup at
tempt with 25 seconds to play to help seal the Stanford
win. Grunfeld had 13 points and 10 rebounds for the Car
dinal.
Dec. 18: Stanford 72, UC-Davis 62
Ten months and $30 million later, the Cardinal made
their debut in their new digs the same way they said good
bye to the old Maples Pavilion: with a win. The Cardinal
won their 16th straight at home, the longest active streak in
the Pac-10. behind a season-best 63 percent shooting per
formance. Grunfeld led Stanford with 18 points, and Mor
ris chipped in a career-high 13 points.
Dec. 22: Stanford 71, Dartmouth 54
The Cardinal won their third straight and improved to
24-8 against the Ivy League. Hernandez helped stretch a
nine-point halftime lead to 15 early in the second half with
two three-pointers and Dartmouth would not threaten
again. Hernandez finished with 14 points, while Grunfeld
finished with 15.
Dec. 23: Stanford 84, Montana 66
The Cardinal avenged a home loss to the Grizzlies they
suffered two years ago with one of their most dominating
performances of the season. Grunfeld led the offensive on
slaught with 18 points, while Morris and Haryasz chipped
in 11 points apiece. The Cardinal nailed a season-high eight
three-pointers, including three consecutive treys in the first
half, to take their first double-digit lead into halftime all
season, 49-36.
