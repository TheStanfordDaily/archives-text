### CHARLES NGUYEN THE GUARDIAN (U. CALIFORNIA-SAN DIEGO 
(U-WIRE) LA JOLLA, Calif.
— University of California stu
dents are paying alarmingly high
tuition fees for their university ed
ucation. according to a new study
conducted by a retired University
of California-Berkeley physics
professor.
While the UC Regents' 2005-06
budget report states that students
in the state's top public university
pay for just 30 percent of their edu
cation's cost, the report by profes
sor emeritus Charles Schwartz
titled "Student Fees: Approaching
the Limit" — states that under
graduates are paying percent of
the costs associated with their at
tendance at a UC campus.
"If you were to ask me what sig
nal I can imagine most clearly des
ignates the transition from public
to private status, I would say |it's)
when undergraduate student fees
cross the line of paying for more
than KM) percent of the actual cost
of their education at the institu
tion." Schwartz states in the report.
"The calculation reported in this
paper says that we at UC are ap
proaching the limit right now. Fac
ulty and administrators had better
face up to that fact."
Calculations provided in
Schwartz's report, released in No
vember 2004, are higher than offi
cial UC numbers because they con

sider fewer programs and services
funded by the university.
"My report focuses on under
graduate education, as separated
from graduate education and fac
ulty research," said Schwartz, who
successfully sued the UC Board of
Regents to gain access to data on
employee pensions and has often
been critical of the regents. "My
number is so much less than official
UC statements because they bun
dle all those other missions togeth
er — which gives a very misleading
picture."
However, UC Office of the
President spokeswoman Ravi
Poorsina criticized Schwartz's
numbers, saying that calculating
the cost of attendance for one stu
dent was not possible with the data
available.
"[Schwartz] has come up with
another calculation that's based on
a lot of assumptions," Poorsina
told the Daily Bruin. "He assumes
a lot of data because he doesn't
have access to a lot of it."
The importance of UC faculty
research has created a rift of un
derstanding between faculty and
public minds, Schwartz stated in
liis report. While faculty members
have been most valued for their re
search activities, the public is most
concerned about the undergradu
ate education provided to stu
dents. However, state budget
problems have resulted in legisla
tive cuts to university budgets,
which forced UC universities to

raise student fees in hopes of re
covering lost revenue, Schwartz
stated.
"Research and teaching are
both important functions — which
a public research university per
forms for the public good," he said.
"The state used to pay for all of
that. Now some cost is being shift
ed to undergraduate students — to
pay for their own education. But
they should not be required to pay
also for the other public functions
that UC provides."
The issue of student fees is
growing more urgent because of
impending hikes, Schwartz said.
When the 8-percent fee raise ap
proved by the regents for next year
is taken into account, the burden
on undergraduates will be at or
above 100 percent of what their ed
ucation actually costs, Schwartz
said. "I think that is uncon
scionable," Schwartz said. "At
least UC should be honest and say
where their money goes — that
means, accept my calculation or
provide their own."
Poorsina said the university
could not provide an exact esti
mate of per-student costs.
Schwartz's analysis was based on
economic logic and official UC
data provided in university publi
cations, he said.
"I have asked UC officials to
meet with me if they disbelieve any
part of my work. I'm still waiting
fora response," Schwartz said.

budget report states that students
in the state's top public university
pay for just 30 percent of their edu
cation's cost, the report by profes
sor emeritus Charles Schwartz
titled "Student Fees: Approaching
the Limit" — states that under
graduates are paying percent of
the costs associated with their at
tendance at a UC campus.
"If you were to ask me what sig
nal I can imagine most clearly des
ignates the transition from public
to private status, I would say |it's)
when undergraduate student fees
cross the line of paying for more
than KM) percent of the actual cost
of their education at the institu
tion." Schwartz states in the report.
"The calculation reported in this
paper says that we at UC are ap
proaching the limit right now. Fac
ulty and administrators had better
face up to that fact."
Calculations provided in
Schwartz's report, released in No
vember 2004, are higher than offi
cial UC numbers because they con

sider fewer programs and services
funded by the university.
"My report focuses on under
graduate education, as separated
from graduate education and fac
ulty research," said Schwartz, who
successfully sued the UC Board of
Regents to gain access to data on
employee pensions and has often
been critical of the regents. "My
number is so much less than official
UC statements because they bun
dle all those other missions togeth
er — which gives a very misleading
picture."
However, UC Office of the
President spokeswoman Ravi
Poorsina criticized Schwartz's
numbers, saying that calculating
the cost of attendance for one stu
dent was not possible with the data
available.
"[Schwartz] has come up with
another calculation that's based on
a lot of assumptions," Poorsina
told the Daily Bruin. "He assumes
a lot of data because he doesn't
have access to a lot of it."
The importance of UC faculty
research has created a rift of un
derstanding between faculty and
public minds, Schwartz stated in
liis report. While faculty members
have been most valued for their re
search activities, the public is most
concerned about the undergradu
ate education provided to stu
dents. However, state budget
problems have resulted in legisla
tive cuts to university budgets,
which forced UC universities to

raise student fees in hopes of re
covering lost revenue, Schwartz
stated.
"Research and teaching are
both important functions — which
a public research university per
forms for the public good," he said.
"The state used to pay for all of
that. Now some cost is being shift
ed to undergraduate students — to
pay for their own education. But
they should not be required to pay
also for the other public functions
that UC provides."
The issue of student fees is
growing more urgent because of
impending hikes, Schwartz said.
When the 8-percent fee raise ap
proved by the regents for next year
is taken into account, the burden
on undergraduates will be at or
above 100 percent of what their ed
ucation actually costs, Schwartz
said. "I think that is uncon
scionable," Schwartz said. "At
least UC should be honest and say
where their money goes — that
means, accept my calculation or
provide their own."
Poorsina said the university
could not provide an exact esti
mate of per-student costs.
Schwartz's analysis was based on
economic logic and official UC
data provided in university publi
cations, he said.
"I have asked UC officials to
meet with me if they disbelieve any
part of my work. I'm still waiting
fora response," Schwartz said.
