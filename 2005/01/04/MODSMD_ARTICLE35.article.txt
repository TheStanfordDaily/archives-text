# Pomona College football coaches living, partying in equipment room

### JAY ANTENEN THE STUDENT LIFE (POMONA COLLEGE 
(U-WIRE) CLAREMONT,
Calif. — An assistant Pomona-
Pitzer football coach inhabited the
equipment room of the Rains Ath
letic Center for at least the past se
mester and hosted frequent parties
there, The Student Life has learned.
Greg Baker, the former offensive
line coach for the Sagehens and the
former equipment manager for the
Rains Center, apparently used the
room as his permanent residence
during the past football season.
Daniel Wire, an assistant football
coach, also slept in the room from
time to time, students said. Baker
could not be reached for comment
and Wire declined to comment.
Students familiar with the living
arrangement said Baker kept a
couch, air mattress, Xbox, television,
refrigerator and microwave in the
room. Christmas lights were strung
across the ceiling. The students
stressed that they viewed Baker in a
positive light and did not have a
problem with him living in the room.
One student, who had seen the
room, said it appeared the room was
set up for long-term occupancy.
"It was pretty strange, to say the
least," he said.
The Student Life spoke to numer
ous students who had seen the living
arrangement in a corner of the
equipment room. Additional stu
dents confirmed that parties had
taken place there over the course of
the past semester. Assistant football
coaches fraternized with students
and members of the football team at
some of the parties, students who at
tended the parties allege. All the stu
dents interviewed by The Student
Life asked not to be identified out of
fear of retaliation.
In a posting to thefacebook.com
"We Miss Coach Baker" webpage,
junior football player Matthew
Toma described the parties held in
the equipment room as "a level of

debauchery never to be seen at
Pomona again."
A student close to the Physical
Education Department, who did not
attend the parties, said she saw large
piles of beer cans in the equipment
room on multiple occasions.
The Director of Physical Education
at Pomona, Charles Katsiaficas, said
Monday that he did not know that
Baker had been living in the equip
ment room.
"I'm willing to bet that there have
been times when coaches have had
late nights and early mornings and
have possibly slept in their offices
before. 1 know many coaches across
the country that have likely done
that at one time or another, but this
is different from living there," said
Katsiaficas, after learning about
Baker's living arrangement.
Roger Caron, the football coach,
declined to be interviewed, but said
Baker's position as assistant coach
was not relevant to the fact that he
was living in the equipment room.
"I really have nothing to add to this
discussion," he said in a statement.
Dean of Students Ann Quinley said
she did not know Baker was living in
the equipment room, although she
said she had heard that a coach had
occasionally slept there.
Quinley noted that she was unsure if
Pomona had an official policy bar
ring faculty from living in campus fa
cilities.
Katsiaficas said it might be under
standable fora staff member to live
on campus temporarily if he or she
was in between places or moving, but
long-term occupancy was not per
mitted.
"It certainly would not be normal
policy," said Katsiaficas.
The equipment room, located be
hind the front desk of the Rains Cen
ter. is used to store uniforms and
other sporting goods for varsity
teams, intramurals and Physical Ed
ucation activities. The room is sup
posed to be accessed infrequently.
"That is a storage area that we keep
locked unless the equipment manag

er needs to go back to get specific
equipment out when a season
starts," said Katsiaficas.
The week of Nov. 21. a Student Life
photographer requested permission
from Rains Center student employ
ees to enter the equipment room on
five different occasions. In each case,
she was told the room was locked.
On the morning of Nov. 24, a Rains
Center student employee told the
photographer she could not enter
the equipment room because the
coaches were sleeping.
Students who knew Baker described
him as a funny, quirky man whom
many student-athletes respected.
'•Personally, he has taught me more
about life than any teacher or course,
and 1 know that there are many play
ers who will express similar senti
ments," said Paul Nesvig, a football
player, in a statement. "There are
countless former and current players
that hold coach Baker's friendship in
the highest regard."
"1 can think of only a few people I re
spect more in this world than coach
Baker," said Toma in a statement to
The Student Life.
The student close to the Physical Ed
ucation Department said part of the
problem that might have con
tributed to Baker's unusual living
arrangement was that assistant
coaches are paid a meager $1,500
stipend a season.
"It's tough to recruit and scout and
have it be a part-time job." said a stu
dent. "It's a new extreme, though, to
live in the equipment room."
She wondered if Pomona should
perhaps provide Baker with assis
tance in finding more suitable hous
ing. Katsiaficas said assistant coach
es are supposed to be volunteers and
seek employment elsewhere to sup
port themselves. Baker was a full
time employee of the college. In
early November. Baker accepted a
job at Aims Community College in
Colorado. He left for Colorado a few
weeks ago. Wire now manages the
equipment room.
