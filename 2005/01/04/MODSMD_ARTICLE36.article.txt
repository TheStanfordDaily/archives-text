### LISA MAK THE GUARDIAN (U. CALIFORNIA-SAN DIEGO 
(U-WIRE) LA JOLLA, Calif. —
University of California-San Diego
received a grade of "B-" for its to
bacco-free policies, while seven
other colleges in the area earned fail
ing grades, according to a new "re
port card" released by the American
Lung Association of San Diego and
Imperial Counties. The first-of-its
kind evaluation judged the extent to
which 13 local college campuses dis
couraged student tobacco use. The
study was conducted in partnership
with the Tobacco-Free Communi
ties Coalition, with partial funding
from the California Department of
Health Services.
"Institutions of higher learning
are excellent targets for big-tobacco
donations and funded research,"
ALA health educator Susanna Con
cha-Garcia stated in an e-mail. Point
Loma Nazarene University and San
Diego State University received
grades of "A+" and "A-," respec
tively, for their tobacco-free policies,
while University of San Diego and
Palomar Community College both
received a "B." California State Uni
versity-San Marcos received a "D."
The other remaining colleges, in
cluding San Diego City College,
Cuyamaca Community College,
Mesa College and National Univer
sity, received failing grades.
The final grades are based on al
most five years of study, which in
cluded communications with univer
sity administrators and student
groups, as well as an evaluation on
more than two dozen grading crite
ria.
"We applaud the institutions with
high grades and we are hearing from
some other campuses that they will
move forward quickly to establish
policies that will improve the health

of tens of thousands of students,"
said regional ALA Vice President
for Government Relations Debra
Kelley in a Dec. 3 announcement.
UCSD received a perfect score
for campus enforcement of smoking
rules and regulations but lost points
fora lack of protection of communi
ty members and a lack of reduction
of second-hand smoke exposure.
For example, outdoor dining patios
on campus do not have smoke-free
areas, and parking lots are not
smoke-free, according to the report
card. The campus also lost points for
accepting research funding from to
bacco companies and for failing to
prohibit the sale of tobacco products
on campus.
"The UCSD [General Store] co
op still sells tobacco on campus,"
Concha-Garcia stated. "There are
large incentives to sell cigarettes,
such as the high profit margin made
on tobacco sales, the tobacco compa
nies' reimbursement for in-store dis
plays and reimbursements of the
store for lost or stolen tobacco mer
chandise."
Campus spokesman Barry Jago
da said the university acknowledges
the importance of the ALA's study.
"UCSD does a good job of dis
couraging smoking, but there's al
ways room for improvement, and
some of the issues in the American
Lung Association's report may de
serve further study," Jagoda said.
Smoking went up on university cam
puses nationwide from 22.3 percent
of students in 1993 to 28.5 percent in
1998, a rate higher than that of all
adults, according to ALA. Citing
concerns about increased tobacco
usage among the young adult popu
lation, the ALA received funding in
2001 to develop the report card. In
March 2004, the ALA sent letters
notifying colleges of the grading cri
teria and forecasting their scores.
The schools were then given a

chance to verify and update their
data and to modify or adopt new to
bacco-free policies. The final grades
were announced in November.
Representatives from some of the
"failing" college campuses, however,
have cited errors in the ALA's report.
"We were not awarded points in ten
areas that we clearly have a practice
[or] procedure in place to reduce the
exposure to tobacco or to encourage
the cessation of the use of tobacco,"
San Diego City College Director of
Administrative Services Carol Dex
heimer stated in an e-mail. "I think
the reporting errors occurred because
the 'reporter' did not contact a repre
sentative of City College ... I don't
know how or who came up with the
inaccurate information that resulted
in the reported 'F.'"
Concha-Garcia, however, de
fended the ALA's reporting proce
dures.
"This is the first report card of its
kind, rating the college and universi
ty campuses in San Diego County,"
she stated. "The report card was set
up to analyze the policy and college
characteristics unique to each set
ting. What happened is that campus
administrators who communicated
with the ALA early on fared better
than those who waited until the fall."
A new report card for the same 13
colleges will be issued in May. In the
mean time, the ALA will assist
schools in improving their smoking
policies, the organization said.
"All the campuses that received
'F' grades have let us know that they
are serious about improving their
grades by furnishing complete infor
mation and working with us to un
derstand how colleges can be a to
bacco-resistant environment," re
gional ALA spokesman Ross Porter
stated in an e-mail. "The real mean
ing of these grades is to promote
awareness of this kind, so we think
we are on the right track."

other colleges in the area earned fail
ing grades, according to a new "re
port card" released by the American
Lung Association of San Diego and
Imperial Counties. The first-of-its
kind evaluation judged the extent to
which 13 local college campuses dis
couraged student tobacco use. The
study was conducted in partnership
with the Tobacco-Free Communi
ties Coalition, with partial funding
from the California Department of
Health Services.
"Institutions of higher learning
are excellent targets for big-tobacco
donations and funded research,"
ALA health educator Susanna Con
cha-Garcia stated in an e-mail. Point
Loma Nazarene University and San
Diego State University received
grades of "A+" and "A-," respec
tively, for their tobacco-free policies,
while University of San Diego and
Palomar Community College both
received a "B." California State Uni
versity-San Marcos received a "D."
The other remaining colleges, in
cluding San Diego City College,
Cuyamaca Community College,
Mesa College and National Univer
sity, received failing grades.
The final grades are based on al
most five years of study, which in
cluded communications with univer
sity administrators and student
groups, as well as an evaluation on
more than two dozen grading crite
ria.
"We applaud the institutions with
high grades and we are hearing from
some other campuses that they will
move forward quickly to establish
policies that will improve the health

of tens of thousands of students,"
said regional ALA Vice President
for Government Relations Debra
Kelley in a Dec. 3 announcement.
UCSD received a perfect score
for campus enforcement of smoking
rules and regulations but lost points
fora lack of protection of communi
ty members and a lack of reduction
of second-hand smoke exposure.
For example, outdoor dining patios
on campus do not have smoke-free
areas, and parking lots are not
smoke-free, according to the report
card. The campus also lost points for
accepting research funding from to
bacco companies and for failing to
prohibit the sale of tobacco products
on campus.
"The UCSD [General Store] co
op still sells tobacco on campus,"
Concha-Garcia stated. "There are
large incentives to sell cigarettes,
such as the high profit margin made
on tobacco sales, the tobacco compa
nies' reimbursement for in-store dis
plays and reimbursements of the
store for lost or stolen tobacco mer
chandise."
Campus spokesman Barry Jago
da said the university acknowledges
the importance of the ALA's study.
"UCSD does a good job of dis
couraging smoking, but there's al
ways room for improvement, and
some of the issues in the American
Lung Association's report may de
serve further study," Jagoda said.
Smoking went up on university cam
puses nationwide from 22.3 percent
of students in 1993 to 28.5 percent in
1998, a rate higher than that of all
adults, according to ALA. Citing
concerns about increased tobacco
usage among the young adult popu
lation, the ALA received funding in
2001 to develop the report card. In
March 2004, the ALA sent letters
notifying colleges of the grading cri
teria and forecasting their scores.
The schools were then given a

chance to verify and update their
data and to modify or adopt new to
bacco-free policies. The final grades
were announced in November.
Representatives from some of the
"failing" college campuses, however,
have cited errors in the ALA's report.
"We were not awarded points in ten
areas that we clearly have a practice
[or] procedure in place to reduce the
exposure to tobacco or to encourage
the cessation of the use of tobacco,"
San Diego City College Director of
Administrative Services Carol Dex
heimer stated in an e-mail. "I think
the reporting errors occurred because
the 'reporter' did not contact a repre
sentative of City College ... I don't
know how or who came up with the
inaccurate information that resulted
in the reported 'F.'"
Concha-Garcia, however, de
fended the ALA's reporting proce
dures.
"This is the first report card of its
kind, rating the college and universi
ty campuses in San Diego County,"
she stated. "The report card was set
up to analyze the policy and college
characteristics unique to each set
ting. What happened is that campus
administrators who communicated
with the ALA early on fared better
than those who waited until the fall."
A new report card for the same 13
colleges will be issued in May. In the
mean time, the ALA will assist
schools in improving their smoking
policies, the organization said.
"All the campuses that received
'F' grades have let us know that they
are serious about improving their
grades by furnishing complete infor
mation and working with us to un
derstand how colleges can be a to
bacco-resistant environment," re
gional ALA spokesman Ross Porter
stated in an e-mail. "The real mean
ing of these grades is to promote
awareness of this kind, so we think
we are on the right track."
