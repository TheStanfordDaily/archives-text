# Government mulls student database

### AMY IFURUNG THE GUARDIAN (U. CALIFORNIA-SAN DIEGO 
(U-WIRE) LA JOLLA, Calif. —
The University of California has ex
pressed student-privacy apprehen
sions over the federal government's
new plan to collect and maintain de
tailed information on college stu
dents across the nation.
The proposal recommends the
creation of a detailed database of en
rollment records for all college stu
dents, including such information as
individual names and social security
numbers.
"The university definitely has
concerns in relation to invasions of
privacy," said Brigitte Donner, com
munications coordinator at the Uni
versity of California's federal gov
ernment relations office in Washing
ton, D.C. "There's still a lot of un
certainty regarding exactly what
data will be collected."
Current government records only
contain information on individuals
receiving federal financial aid — and
lack all identifiable information, like
names. Higher education institu
tions also disclose general informa
tion about enrollment, financial aid
and graduation rates. In addition to
the university, several higher-educa
tion groups have also voiced con
cerns over the proposed new data
base.
Those opposed to the proposal
include the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universi
ties, and the United States Student

Association, the largest and oldest
student coalition in the nation.
"This proposal would take away
the little bit of protection that stu
dents currently have," USSA Leg
islative Director Jasmine L. Harris
said, referring to a current federal
law that protects student education
al records. Under the Family Educa
tional Rights and Privacy Act,
schools may disclose information on
students without consent only under
specific conditions — when it is re
quested in accordance with a judicial
order or subpoena, for example.
The new proposal would launch
across-the-board data collection that
can currently only occur in certain
circumstances on a student-by-stu
dent basis. The new proposal will
allow the National Center for Edu
cation Statistics at the Department
of Education to receive information
on students regardless of consent.
"Students don't have the ability
to opt out of this," Harris said. "They
have no choice in the matter, and
that's a cause for concern." Howev
er, supporters of the database say it
would correct a procedural flaw in
the department's existing system for
gathering statistics: Students who
transfer schools are recorded both as
dropouts from their old campuses
and as new enrollments at their sec
ond colleges.
Proponents of the proposal,
which include several higher-educa
tion lobbying groups, said that more
detailed information is needed to
hold colleges and universities ac
countable for student achievement.

"The limitations of existing data sys
tems prevent institutions from fully
examining the progress of their stu
dents through the higher education
system," stated Edward M. Elmen
dorf, the American Association of
State Colleges and Universities' vice
president of government and policy
analysis, in a letter to members of the
House of Representatives. "Current
accountability systems fail to cap
ture the full measure of student
progress and success on our campus
es."
In addition to the AASCU, the
American Council of Education and
the State Higher Education Execu
tive Officers Association both ex
pressed support for the plan, which
was first reported by the Chronicle
of Higher Education.
The new data collection method
would "improve accountability for
student success, enhance consumer
information available to prospective
students and other stakeholders and
enable a more robust evaluation of
federal student financial aid pro
grams," Elmendorf stated.
Calls and e-mails to a Depart
ment of Education spokesman seek
ing comment were not returned. The
proposal is only in the discussion
stage, and the new database would
require approval from Congress.
If a formal proposal is made, and
in turn approved, NCES will conduct
a trial of the system with 1,500 col
leges during the 2006-07 school year.
Based on the results of the trial run.

dents across the nation.
The proposal recommends the
creation of a detailed database of en
rollment records for all college stu
dents, including such information as
individual names and social security
numbers.
"The university definitely has
concerns in relation to invasions of
privacy," said Brigitte Donner, com
munications coordinator at the Uni
versity of California's federal gov
ernment relations office in Washing
ton, D.C. "There's still a lot of un
certainty regarding exactly what
data will be collected."
Current government records only
contain information on individuals
receiving federal financial aid — and
lack all identifiable information, like
names. Higher education institu
tions also disclose general informa
tion about enrollment, financial aid
and graduation rates. In addition to
the university, several higher-educa
tion groups have also voiced con
cerns over the proposed new data
base.
Those opposed to the proposal
include the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universi
ties, and the United States Student

Association, the largest and oldest
student coalition in the nation.
"This proposal would take away
the little bit of protection that stu
dents currently have," USSA Leg
islative Director Jasmine L. Harris
said, referring to a current federal
law that protects student education
al records. Under the Family Educa
tional Rights and Privacy Act,
schools may disclose information on
students without consent only under
specific conditions — when it is re
quested in accordance with a judicial
order or subpoena, for example.
The new proposal would launch
across-the-board data collection that
can currently only occur in certain
circumstances on a student-by-stu
dent basis. The new proposal will
allow the National Center for Edu
cation Statistics at the Department
of Education to receive information
on students regardless of consent.
"Students don't have the ability
to opt out of this," Harris said. "They
have no choice in the matter, and
that's a cause for concern." Howev
er, supporters of the database say it
would correct a procedural flaw in
the department's existing system for
gathering statistics: Students who
transfer schools are recorded both as
dropouts from their old campuses
and as new enrollments at their sec
ond colleges.
Proponents of the proposal,
which include several higher-educa
tion lobbying groups, said that more
detailed information is needed to
hold colleges and universities ac
countable for student achievement.

"The limitations of existing data sys
tems prevent institutions from fully
examining the progress of their stu
dents through the higher education
system," stated Edward M. Elmen
dorf, the American Association of
State Colleges and Universities' vice
president of government and policy
analysis, in a letter to members of the
House of Representatives. "Current
accountability systems fail to cap
ture the full measure of student
progress and success on our campus
es."
In addition to the AASCU, the
American Council of Education and
the State Higher Education Execu
tive Officers Association both ex
pressed support for the plan, which
was first reported by the Chronicle
of Higher Education.
The new data collection method
would "improve accountability for
student success, enhance consumer
information available to prospective
students and other stakeholders and
enable a more robust evaluation of
federal student financial aid pro
grams," Elmendorf stated.
Calls and e-mails to a Depart
ment of Education spokesman seek
ing comment were not returned. The
proposal is only in the discussion
stage, and the new database would
require approval from Congress.
If a formal proposal is made, and
in turn approved, NCES will conduct
a trial of the system with 1,500 col
leges during the 2006-07 school year.
Based on the results of the trial run.
the system wothen spread national
ly.
