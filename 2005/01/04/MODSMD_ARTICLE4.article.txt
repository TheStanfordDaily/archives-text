# Profs, TAs struggle to combat plagiarism

### SARAH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
At campuses across the world,
administrators are using anti-pla
giarism software to combat the in
crease in plagiarism that accompa
nied the rise of the Internet, a trend
that has carried over into Stanford.
Instructors in the computer sci
ence department frequently scan
students' assignments with the
software program Measure of Soft
ware Similarity (MOSS). The Of
fice of Judicial Affairs also uses
plagiarism-scanning software to
verify claims and identify sources
in plagiarism allegations.
Using these kinds of software is
not the only precaution Stanford
faculty take against plagiarism,
however, as most professors try to
discourage reuse of papers by com
ing up with different essay topics
each year and restricting sources.
"There is an extensive training

program at the beginning of the
year that brings together past
teaching fellows and people from
the Judicial Affairs Office to talk
about plagiarism," said Roland
Hsu, acting director of the Intro
duction to Humanities program.
"Professors are advised to come up
with different essay questions each
year."
In the I-Hum program, teaching
fellows also compare essays and
grade together.
"If someone thinks there is a
problem, they circulated it among
the other TFs and check it against
files of past papers." Hsu said.
"We've thought about [using pla
giarism scanning software]. Some
TFs use it, but mostly as a second
step."

Among the tools used by instructors to combat plagiarism is the
computer program Turnltln, which discovers lifted phrases in papers.
