# Profs, TAs struggle to combat plagiarism
## 
### SARAH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
At campuses across the world,
administrators are using anti-pla
giarism software to combat the in
crease in plagiarism that accompa
nied the rise of the Internet, a trend
that has carried over into Stanford.
Instructors in the computer sci
ence department frequently scan
students' assignments with the
software program Measure of Soft
ware Similarity (MOSS). The Of
fice of Judicial Affairs also uses
plagiarism-scanning software to
verify claims and identify sources
in plagiarism allegations.
Using these kinds of software is
not the only precaution Stanford
faculty take against plagiarism,
however, as most professors try to
discourage reuse of papers by com
ing up with different essay topics
each year and restricting sources.
"There is an extensive training

program at the beginning of the
year that brings together past
teaching fellows and people from
the Judicial Affairs Office to talk
about plagiarism," said Roland
Hsu, acting director of the Intro
duction to Humanities program.
"Professors are advised to come up
with different essay questions each
year."
In the I-Hum program, teaching
fellows also compare essays and
grade together.
"If someone thinks there is a
problem, they circulated it among
the other TFs and check it against
files of past papers." Hsu said.
"We've thought about [using pla
giarism scanning software]. Some
TFs use it, but mostly as a second
step."

incidents of plagiarism in his class

es. In one case, a student turned in
a paper with a Website URL print
ed out on the bottom of the page.
"What I tell students is that the
reason that cheating is really bad is
because it makes me wonder if
everyone is cheating," Rutten said.
"If 1 get a paper that is really, real
ly good. I wonder. It's not just that
it screws up the grading system, it
also poisons student-teacher rela
tionships."
Rutten also thinks that students
don't realize how easy it is fora
professor to identify a plagiarized
paper.
"I think students underestimate
how easy it is to catch plagiarism."
Rutten said. "If you read a bunch
of papers from the same class, you
learn a lot about the sources. If you
see the same phrase but it is not at
tributed. you know it's not the stu
dent's work."
Rutten said that he often identi
fies plagiarism when the writing
style is too advanced fora college
level student or when the paper fo
cuses on topics not discussed in
class.
While Stanford does not have a
University-wide anti-plagiarism
program in place, individual pro
fessors are allowed to use anti-pla
giarism software if they inform the
students beforehand.
"I would guess that [the reason
Stanford does not use anti-plagia
rism software] is because it doesn't
really fit with the Honor Code,"
said Judicial Advisor Laurette
Beeson.
The Judicial Affairs Office does
use a type of this software called

Turnltln to find evidence for pla
giarism once a professor suspects
it. Still, the software is not always
necessary and Beeson said that
professors frequently just search a
phrase on Google and find the
source.
"I would guess that 1 to 5 per
cent of the freshmen plagiarize,"
said junior Jay Pandit, who is the
Head Peer Academic Advisor in
Junipero, an all-freshman dorm.
"In the higher classes, it would
probably be lower."
Last year, there were 16 cases of
plagiarized essays brought to the
attention of the Judicial Affairs Of
fice, out of which 12 students were
found responsible. Of the other
four cases, two were withdrawn,
and two are pending due to the stu
dents' absence from campus.
In the computer science depart
ment, there were 26 cases brought
to the University's attention last
year, out of which 16 students were
found responsible. In nine of the
cases, the student's code was found
to be the source, not the plagia
rized copy.
Most offenses result in a one
quarter suspension and penalty of
40 hours of community service. Ex
pulsions are rare. Beeson said.
"In the last four years, we've
had four expulsions," she said.
"You're not going to get expelled
for plagiarizing one paper."
There has been only one case in
the past five-and-a-half years in
which a student admitted to hiring
another student to write for them.
However, this case came to the at
tention of the University because

the code was actually plagiarized
from a third person.
"I would imagine that this par
ticular type of plagiarism might be
more difficult to detect," Beeson
said, adding that professors might
be able to catch this type of con
tracted plagiarism in an essay for
mat if the writing style differed
greatly from previous papers.
Another type of plagiarism that
is difficult to catch is dual submis
sion â€” when students turn in a sin
gle paper to two different classes.
Beeson noted that this is sometime
caught when professors casually
converse about student essays.
At Northwestern University
this semester, school officials are
conducting a trial run of a service
called Safe Assignment. This is not
the first anti-plagiarism software
the university has tried, but be
cause it is incorporated into their
online course system, it has been
more popular with professors.
"I've been surprised at the num
ber of faculty who were immedi
ately interested in it," said Brian
Nielson, the manager for Learning
Support Systems at Northwestern.
However, students were surpris
ingly quiet about the new technolo
gy. According to Nielson, the only
students who have approached him
about the topic were reporters
from The Daily Northwestern.
So far, there are 16 classes on
campus that are using it, but the
university has not made any data
available yet. Nielson pointed out
the difficulty of discovering how
much plagiarism is really happen
ing, noting that an increase in alle-

Instructors employ high- and low-tech
means to root out plagiarizing students

gations may not say anything about
the actual number of cases.
"There have never been good
tests on the frequency of plagia
rism," Nielson said. "But [using the
software] is likely to be a deterrent.
And if an instructor ever has a sus
picion about it, they can test it pret
ty quickly."
According to Northwestern's
associate provost, Stephen Fisher,
the differences in how his school
and Stanford pursue plagiarism
"are just two different approach
es."
"There are certainly people who
think that all students are trustwor
thy," he said. "The other stance is
that students as a group can't be
trusted and faculty need to be ever
vigilant against cheating."
Stanford's Honor Code discour
ages professors from "taking un
usual and unreasonable precau
tions to prevent . . . dishonesty."
Because of this, "most cases just
fall into people's lap," Beeson said.
Still, many students feel that the
Honor Code rightfully grants them
trust.
"I think it's wonderful that they
put so much confidence and faith in
us," said freshman Francie
Neukom. "It makes me want to up
hold their trust even more."
Other students concurred.
"I think it's an interesting policy
because it relies more on trust and
integrity than on disciplinary ac
tions," said freshman Micah
Naimark. "Although it makes it
easier to cheat, it reminds people
of their individual responsibility."

"There is an extensive training

"Professors are advised to come up

In the I-Hum program, teaching

es. In one case, a student turned in
a paper with a Website URL print
ed out on the bottom of the page.
"What I tell students is that the
reason that cheating is really bad is
because it makes me wonder if
everyone is cheating," Rutten said.
"If 1 get a paper that is really, real
ly good. I wonder. It's not just that
it screws up the grading system, it
also poisons student-teacher rela
tionships."
Rutten also thinks that students
don't realize how easy it is fora
professor to identify a plagiarized
paper.
"I think students underestimate
how easy it is to catch plagiarism."
Rutten said. "If you read a bunch
of papers from the same class, you
learn a lot about the sources. If you
see the same phrase but it is not at
tributed. you know it's not the stu
dent's work."
Rutten said that he often identi
fies plagiarism when the writing
style is too advanced fora college
level student or when the paper fo
cuses on topics not discussed in
class.
While Stanford does not have a
University-wide anti-plagiarism
program in place, individual pro
fessors are allowed to use anti-pla
giarism software if they inform the
students beforehand.
"I would guess that [the reason
Stanford does not use anti-plagia
rism software] is because it doesn't
really fit with the Honor Code,"
said Judicial Advisor Laurette
Beeson.
The Judicial Affairs Office does
use a type of this software called

Turnltln to find evidence for pla
giarism once a professor suspects
it. Still, the software is not always
necessary and Beeson said that
professors frequently just search a
phrase on Google and find the
source.
"I would guess that 1 to 5 per
cent of the freshmen plagiarize,"
said junior Jay Pandit, who is the
Head Peer Academic Advisor in
Junipero, an all-freshman dorm.
"In the higher classes, it would
probably be lower."
Last year, there were 16 cases of
plagiarized essays brought to the
attention of the Judicial Affairs Of
fice, out of which 12 students were
found responsible. Of the other
four cases, two were withdrawn,
and two are pending due to the stu
dents' absence from campus.
In the computer science depart
ment, there were 26 cases brought
to the University's attention last
year, out of which 16 students were
found responsible. In nine of the
cases, the student's code was found
to be the source, not the plagia
rized copy.
Most offenses result in a one
quarter suspension and penalty of
40 hours of community service. Ex
pulsions are rare. Beeson said.
"In the last four years, we've
had four expulsions," she said.
"You're not going to get expelled
for plagiarizing one paper."
There has been only one case in
the past five-and-a-half years in
which a student admitted to hiring
another student to write for them.
However, this case came to the at
tention of the University because

the code was actually plagiarized
from a third person.
"I would imagine that this par
ticular type of plagiarism might be
more difficult to detect," Beeson
said, adding that professors might
be able to catch this type of con
tracted plagiarism in an essay for
mat if the writing style differed
greatly from previous papers.
Another type of plagiarism that
is difficult to catch is dual submis
sion â€” when students turn in a sin
gle paper to two different classes.
Beeson noted that this is sometime
caught when professors casually
converse about student essays.
At Northwestern University
this semester, school officials are
conducting a trial run of a service
called Safe Assignment. This is not
the first anti-plagiarism software
the university has tried, but be
cause it is incorporated into their
online course system, it has been
more popular with professors.
"I've been surprised at the num
ber of faculty who were immedi
ately interested in it," said Brian
Nielson, the manager for Learning
Support Systems at Northwestern.
However, students were surpris
ingly quiet about the new technolo
gy. According to Nielson, the only
students who have approached him
about the topic were reporters
from The Daily Northwestern.
So far, there are 16 classes on
campus that are using it, but the
university has not made any data
available yet. Nielson pointed out
the difficulty of discovering how
much plagiarism is really happen
ing, noting that an increase in alle-

"There have never been good
tests on the frequency of plagia
rism," Nielson said. "But [using the
software] is likely to be a deterrent.
And if an instructor ever has a sus
picion about it, they can test it pret
ty quickly."
According to Northwestern's
associate provost, Stephen Fisher,
the differences in how his school
and Stanford pursue plagiarism
"are just two different approach
es."
"There are certainly people who
think that all students are trustwor
thy," he said. "The other stance is
that students as a group can't be
trusted and faculty need to be ever
vigilant against cheating."
Stanford's Honor Code discour
ages professors from "taking un
usual and unreasonable precau
tions to prevent . . . dishonesty."
Because of this, "most cases just
fall into people's lap," Beeson said.
Still, many students feel that the
Honor Code rightfully grants them
trust.
"I think it's wonderful that they
put so much confidence and faith in
us," said freshman Francie
Neukom. "It makes me want to up
hold their trust even more."
Other students concurred.
"I think it's an interesting policy
because it relies more on trust and
integrity than on disciplinary ac
tions," said freshman Micah
Naimark. "Although it makes it
easier to cheat, it reminds people
of their individual responsibility."
At campuses across the world,
administrators are using anti-pla
giarism software to combat the in

that has carried over into Stanford.

students' assignments with the

Political science lecturer An
drew Rutten has dealt with several
incidents of plagiarism in his class

Among the tools used by instructors to combat plagiarism is the
computer program Turnltln, which discovers lifted phrases in papers.
es. In one case, a student turned in
a paper with a Website URL print
ed out on the bottom of the page.
"What I tell students is that the
reason that cheating is really bad is
because it makes me wonder if
everyone is cheating," Rutten said.
"If 1 get a paper that is really, real
ly good. I wonder. It's not just that
it screws up the grading system, it
also poisons student-teacher rela
tionships."
Rutten also thinks that students
don't realize how easy it is fora
professor to identify a plagiarized
paper.
"I think students underestimate
how easy it is to catch plagiarism."
Rutten said. "If you read a bunch
of papers from the same class, you
learn a lot about the sources. If you
see the same phrase but it is not at
tributed. you know it's not the stu
dent's work."
Rutten said that he often identi
fies plagiarism when the writing
style is too advanced fora college
level student or when the paper fo
cuses on topics not discussed in
class.
While Stanford does not have a
University-wide anti-plagiarism
program in place, individual pro
fessors are allowed to use anti-pla
giarism software if they inform the
students beforehand.
"I would guess that [the reason
Stanford does not use anti-plagia
rism software] is because it doesn't
really fit with the Honor Code,"
said Judicial Advisor Laurette
Beeson.
The Judicial Affairs Office does
use a type of this software called

Turnltln to find evidence for pla
giarism once a professor suspects
it. Still, the software is not always
necessary and Beeson said that
professors frequently just search a
phrase on Google and find the
source.
"I would guess that 1 to 5 per
cent of the freshmen plagiarize,"
said junior Jay Pandit, who is the
Head Peer Academic Advisor in
Junipero, an all-freshman dorm.
"In the higher classes, it would
probably be lower."
Last year, there were 16 cases of
plagiarized essays brought to the
attention of the Judicial Affairs Of
fice, out of which 12 students were
found responsible. Of the other
four cases, two were withdrawn,
and two are pending due to the stu
dents' absence from campus.
In the computer science depart
ment, there were 26 cases brought
to the University's attention last
year, out of which 16 students were
found responsible. In nine of the
cases, the student's code was found
to be the source, not the plagia
rized copy.
Most offenses result in a one
quarter suspension and penalty of
40 hours of community service. Ex
pulsions are rare. Beeson said.
"In the last four years, we've
had four expulsions," she said.
"You're not going to get expelled
for plagiarizing one paper."
There has been only one case in
the past five-and-a-half years in
which a student admitted to hiring
another student to write for them.
However, this case came to the at
tention of the University because

the code was actually plagiarized
from a third person.
"I would imagine that this par
ticular type of plagiarism might be
more difficult to detect," Beeson
said, adding that professors might
be able to catch this type of con
tracted plagiarism in an essay for
mat if the writing style differed
greatly from previous papers.
Another type of plagiarism that
is difficult to catch is dual submis
sion â€” when students turn in a sin
gle paper to two different classes.
Beeson noted that this is sometime
caught when professors casually
converse about student essays.
At Northwestern University
this semester, school officials are
conducting a trial run of a service
called Safe Assignment. This is not
the first anti-plagiarism software
the university has tried, but be
cause it is incorporated into their
online course system, it has been
more popular with professors.
"I've been surprised at the num
ber of faculty who were immedi
ately interested in it," said Brian
Nielson, the manager for Learning
Support Systems at Northwestern.
However, students were surpris
ingly quiet about the new technolo
gy. According to Nielson, the only
students who have approached him
about the topic were reporters
from The Daily Northwestern.
So far, there are 16 classes on
campus that are using it, but the
university has not made any data
available yet. Nielson pointed out
the difficulty of discovering how
much plagiarism is really happen
ing, noting that an increase in alle-

Instructors employ high- and low-tech
means to root out plagiarizing students

gations may not say anything about
the actual number of cases.
"There have never been good
tests on the frequency of plagia
rism," Nielson said. "But [using the
software] is likely to be a deterrent.
And if an instructor ever has a sus
picion about it, they can test it pret
ty quickly."
According to Northwestern's
associate provost, Stephen Fisher,
the differences in how his school
and Stanford pursue plagiarism
"are just two different approach
es."
"There are certainly people who
think that all students are trustwor
thy," he said. "The other stance is
that students as a group can't be
trusted and faculty need to be ever
vigilant against cheating."
Stanford's Honor Code discour
ages professors from "taking un
usual and unreasonable precau
tions to prevent . . . dishonesty."
Because of this, "most cases just
fall into people's lap," Beeson said.
Still, many students feel that the
Honor Code rightfully grants them
trust.
"I think it's wonderful that they
put so much confidence and faith in
us," said freshman Francie
Neukom. "It makes me want to up
hold their trust even more."
Other students concurred.
"I think it's an interesting policy
because it relies more on trust and
integrity than on disciplinary ac
tions," said freshman Micah
Naimark. "Although it makes it
easier to cheat, it reminds people
of their individual responsibility."
