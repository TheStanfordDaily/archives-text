# Univ. to create public fields for city in return for development rights
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
The Palo Alto City Council
announced plans Dec. 14 to turn
six acres of Stanford-owned land
into recreational soccer fields for
the city in exchange for allowing
the University to develop unused
portions of the Stanford Re
search Park.
The deal, one-and-a-half years
in the making, is the most com
prehensive and complex bargain
ever struck between Stanford
and the city of Palo Alto, said
Larry Horton, director of gov
ernment and community affairs
for the University.
The land, which is located on
the corner of Page Mill Road and

El Camino Real — also known
as the Mayfield parcel — will be
leased to the city for $1 per year
for the next 51 years. Stanford
will pay for the construction of
the fields at an estimated cost of
$2.5 million. Local soccer
leagues should be able to use the
fields by the fall.
"The city was in desperate
need of recreational space, and
soccer is very popular," Horton
said.
Palo Alto conducted a survey
to decide what kind of space the
residents of the city would want,
according to Keith Schneider, a
real estate associate at the Stan


Stanford Management Company
Stanford will create public soccer fields on its land in exchange
for development rights from Palo Alto for another parcel.
