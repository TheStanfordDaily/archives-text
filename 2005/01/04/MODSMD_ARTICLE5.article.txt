# Univ. to create public fields for city in return for development rights
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
The Palo Alto City Council
announced plans Dec. 14 to turn
six acres of Stanford-owned land
into recreational soccer fields for
the city in exchange for allowing
the University to develop unused
portions of the Stanford Re
search Park.
The deal, one-and-a-half years
in the making, is the most com
prehensive and complex bargain
ever struck between Stanford
and the city of Palo Alto, said
Larry Horton, director of gov
ernment and community affairs
for the University.
The land, which is located on
the corner of Page Mill Road and

El Camino Real — also known
as the Mayfield parcel — will be
leased to the city for $1 per year
for the next 51 years. Stanford
will pay for the construction of
the fields at an estimated cost of
$2.5 million. Local soccer
leagues should be able to use the
fields by the fall.
"The city was in desperate
need of recreational space, and
soccer is very popular," Horton
said.
Palo Alto conducted a survey
to decide what kind of space the
residents of the city would want,

real estate associate at the Stan

ford Management Company. The
land was originally set aside four
years ago to be the site of the Jew
ish Community Center, but the
deal fell through.
According to the agreement,
Stanford will also build 250 hous
ing units — 50 to 70 of which will
be set aside as affordable housing
— around the intersection of El
Camino Real and California Av
enue and around the intersection
of California Avenue and Hanover
Street.
Housing will not be developed
until the current leases expire for
the businesses located in the two
areas. The project is predicted to
start in 2013 and be completed by
2020.
In addition to helping Palo Alto
balance housing with employment
opportunities, Horton said the
housing will alleviate traffic.
"There will actually be signifi
cant traffic benefits, because we're
going to be tearing down commer
cial space and replacing it with res
idences," he said.
In exchange for the recreation
fields and the housing, Stanford
will be allowed to develop 300,000
square feet of the Stanford Re
search Park into usable office and
research space. Previously, the
University wasn't permitted to

build in this area due to traffic and
noise concerns.
Horton said these problems will
be mitigated by plans to add traffic
signals at Arastradero and
Hillview Avenues, as well as
Arastradero and Deer Creek
Road.
The University does not yet
have plans for the development of
the research park, and Horton said
that construction won't begin any
time soon.
"Part of the agreement is that we
do things for the city immediately,
but we probably won't get the ben
efits for 10 or 15 years," he said.
"The negotiations on the deal took
so long because we had to make
sure both sides got what they were
bargaining for."
Stanford officials have met with
key members of the athletic de
partment. city planners, and archi
tects in preparation for building
the soccer fields. And while the
University offered to pay for nat
ural grass fields, the city has decid
ed to pitch in for artificial turf.
The agreement will be up for of
ficial approval in March after it is
reviewed at two Planning and
Transportation Commission meet
ings. Construction will begin 90
days after the vote if the plan is ap
proved.
