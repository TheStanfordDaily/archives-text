# Moscow program to re-open next fall after restructuring
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a year-long closure, Stanford's Over
seas Studies Program is set to re-open its
Moscow program during autumn quarter of
the 2005-2006 school year. High overhead
costs plagued the previous Moscow program,
so OSP temporarily closed the site in order to
evaluate, re-structure and develop cost man
agement.
The revamped program will have a new lo
cation. lower costs and a limited capacity.
Outreach and Student Relations Manager
for OSP Shannon Marimon said that the tem
porary closure was primarily due to financial
reasons.
"The way the Moscow program was struc
tured was at a higher cost than what was eco
nomically feasible," she said. "We were look
ing fora model that was more cost-effective
and flexible that at the same time provided stu
dents with a belter overall program than what
was offered in previous years."
According to OSP Director Amos Nur, the
previous Moscow program had the same costs
as a year-long enterprise rather than as a quar
ter-by-quarter system
"The overhead costs became too much, so
the need for restructuring the program be
came more and more imminent," Nur said.
"We had always planned on re-opening the
program, so it was only a matter of time before
that happened."
Along with economic adjustments, several
other changes have been implemented to the
Moscow program, including an added lan
guage requirement and a limited capacity of 15
to 20 students for the first quarter.
All students interested in the Moscow pro
gram would be required to take at least one
year of college-level Russian, but an exception
will be made for the autumn quarter 2005 stu
dents.
Autumn-quarter students without lan
guage background will be required to enroll in

a spring quarter Russian "survival skills'
course, followed by enrollment in a three
week Beginning Intensive Russian course of
fered in Moscow prior to the beginning of au
tumn quarter.
The limit for the number of students who
can attend the Moscow program is smaller
than for most other overseas programs. Nur
said the number was chosen for the "experi
mental first quarter" to gauge student interest
and that it can be adjusted in the future.
"There has been lots of variation of student

JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily

interest in the Moscow program in the past, so
we wanted to choose a benchmark number,
and then based on demand raise the capacity
levels," Nur said. "Currently, the program is
only being offered in autumn quarter of every
year, but if demand warrants the change, we
may add more quarters to the list of offerings
for the Moscow program."
The program will also get a new home at
the Academy of the National Economy in

students with more direct access to
campus facilities such as libraries

"We wanted to increase inter
actions among Stanford and Russ

to perhaps forge better language
partnerships between them," Ma
rimon said. "Hopefully, we will see
this program become much more
popular among students each
vear."
