# Michael Moore campus crawl spurs FEC filing, U. Florida to respond
## 
### MEGAN SEERY INDEPENDENT FLORIDA ALLIGATOR (U. FLORIDA 
(U-WIRE) GAINESVILLE, Fla. -
University of Florida administrators
soon will respond to a Federal Elec
tion Commission case sparked alter
the school paid $50,000 for filmmaker
Michael Moore to speak during a
heated election season.
Arizona attorney David Hardy,
co-author of New York Times best
seller "Michael Moore Is a Big Fat
Stupid White Man." filed a complaint
with the commission over alleged
election laws violations committed by
several universities, including UF.
"Universities can bring anyone to
speak on politics generally," Hardy
said. "The question is if the money
was used as an expenditure to influ
ence a general election."
The university violated the Feder
al Election Campaign Act of be
cause it did not report his speech as a

contribution to then-Democratic
nominee John Kerry, he said.
"Moore was giving a very obvious
pro-Kerry speech." Hardy, a Liber
tarian, said. "Unless it's totally unco
ordinated with the campaign, it
counts under campaign finance rules
because it's a contribution in-kind."
Local political organizations paid
for Moore's speeches on several col
lege campuses, he added.
But at UF, no outside organiza
tions ponied up for Moore's speech,
making Student Government's
speakers bureau the sole sponsor. Ac
cent Chairman David Buchalter said.
The bureau consulted university
lawyers prior to the event to verify its le
gality and also invited Republican New
York Gov. George Pataki to provide a
contrasting perspective, he said.
Pataki, who spoke at UF six days
before the election, endorsed Presi
dent Bush in his speech.
"He endorsed Bush because he
was here as part of the other side,"

Buchalter said, noting neither Moore
nor Pataki gave stump speeches. "He
was simply providing his point of
view."
Hardy said it's not a matter of
who's speaking hut of what they're
speaking about.
"If Pataki or anyone else gave a
very specific support-for-Bush speech,
I think that would be worth reporting
(to the FEC), too," Hardy said.
UF General Counsel Pam
Bernard said the university's re
sponse, which she hopes to file within
two weeks, will detail the variety of
speakers who have come to campus in
an attempt to show UF is not trying to
push a particular viewpoint.
If the FEC finds UF violated elec
tion laws, the university will dispute
the ruling, Bernard said.
"I think the University of Florida
would not be alone in taking issue
with that finding," she said. "If the
university cannot have controversial
speakers, where can we have them?"
