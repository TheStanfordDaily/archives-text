# Former U. Oregon track coach files suit for sexual discrimination
## 
### KARA HANSEN OREGON DAILY EMERALD (U. OREGON 
(U-WIRF.) EUGENE, Ore. - For
mer University of Oregon
women's track and field coach
Sally Harmon followed through
with her October threat to file a
lawsuit against the University, al
leging the athletic department sex
ually discriminated against her
when she was terminated last year.
In the lawsuit filed Dec. 20 in
Lane County Circuit Court. Har
mon seeks more than $1.1 million
from the University, Athletic Di
rector Bill Moos, track and field
head coach Martin Smith and the
state board of higher education.
Harmon, a University graduate
and a women's throws events as
sistant for 18 years, was fired in
spring 2003 after the athletic de
partment consolidated the men's
and women's track programs.
Olympic hammer thrower
Lance Deal, a volunteer men's
throws coach since 2002. was hired
to coach the combined program
despite having "no paid Division I
coaching experience" and limited
volunteer coaching experience,

the lawsuit states.
The lawsuit claims Harmon has
lost wages and benefits amounting
to $122,160. Harmon also seeks
compensation for other damages,
such as emotional distress, sleep
lessness, depression, anxiety and
shame and humiliation, and puni
tive damages from Moos and
Smith in an amount to be deter
mined at trial.
University officials were not
available for comment as of Thurs
day, but University General
Counsel Melinda Grier said in a
previous interview that the athlet
ic department's hiring decision
was probably acceptable.
"The reason you choose one
person over another is you select
the one you believe is most quali
fied based on what your criteria
are," said Grier. who was respond
ing to Harmon's decision in Octo
ber to file a lawsuit. "That's what
happened here."
Harmon's attorney, Suzanne
Chanti, was not available for com
ment.
The lawsuit alleges the Univer
sity, Moos and Smith "engaged in
a pattern and practice of discrimi
nating against women student ath

letes and employees within the
athletic department, including dis
criminating in pay and benefits,"
and asserts the gender inequity is
long-standing.
In July 2(XX), Harmon refused
to sign her annual contract after
learning a new men's assistant
coach was being paid $50,000
while she earned $35,724, accord
ing to the lawsuit. She later re
ceived a raise to help rectify the
problem, but in an October inter
view Harmon said she still earned
less than the new male coach.
I n addition to the upwards of $ I
million sought for emotional dis
tress and the $122,000 lost in earn
ings in benefits, the suit requests
that Harmon be hired into the
combined track program or be
paid an amount to be determined
at trial.
But the lawsuit is about values,
not money, Harmon said in Octo
ber.
"(The lawsuit is) not going to
rectify the damage done to me,"
she said. "But walking away from
this and not making a statement of
what's been done, and that it's
wrong, would be a slap in the
face."
