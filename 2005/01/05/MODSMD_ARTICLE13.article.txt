## Op-Ed 'Cultural literacy' a myth in Stanford OSPs 
### CHRISTOPHER VAUGHAN 
In the late-iy7os, at high noon of
the 17-year military rule in Chile,
the Pinochet government under
took a massive "eradication" pro
gram that uprooted tens of thou
sands of squatter families from
across the capital of Santiago and
relocated them to uninhabited
tracts of the city's periphery.
For six years, the eradications col
lectively punished the city's poor:
They were cleansed from upper-class
neighborhoods, segregated to the
hinterlands, and left to build their
own homes, hospitals and schools.
Some very brave individuals have
begun to patch the wounds, but the
scars remain and are well-known.
Yet there is one place where the
eradications should be well-known,
and aren't. It is at Stanford-in-San
tiago (SIS), the only Overseas Stud
ies Program in Latin America. I
studied there from September to
December 2(X)3 and never learned
that I inhabited the very districts
airbrushed by the eradications; and
more generally, that the comforts of
foreign study stand largely on the
shoulders of the poor and indige
nous of Santiago.
A decent education must first
present the unknown, and next
weigh it against the known. Tension,
debate, "teaching the conflicts" —
however termed, these are the ne
cessities of a vital education, and
they are nowhere to be found at the
"Stanford-in" centers. Cloistered
and unchallenging, the OSP's "Stan
ford-in" centers are failing in their
educational mission.
To begin, it must be said that the
road abroad is paved with good in
tentions. I lere is how OSP Director
Amos Nur opens this year's out
reach brochure: "Whatever path
you choose, you will be immeasur
ably enriched by time spent in an
other country. Achieving cultural
literacy in another society, gaining a

substantive understanding of anoth
er perspective on the world, will in
turn deepen an understanding of
yourself, your own society and your
education goals."
These worthwhile ambitions are,
at SIS at least, largely unrealized.
Some students became proficient in
Spanish, immersed themselves in
Chilean social circles, and felt, after
10 weeks, personally galvanized.
They, however, are the outliers.
"Cultural literacy" and "substan
tive" new perspectives do not await
the bulk of "Stanford-in" students.
If cultural literacy were mea
sured solely in travel miles, then SIS
could only be deemed a success.
Frequent weekend trips did bond
SIS students, even i! they spawned a
cliquishness that alienated other
students. Traveling may have pro
vided us with the tourist's "perspec
tive" into the country, but it primar
ily hardened the boundaries be
tween Stanford students and
Chileans.
Remaining free time quickened
the cultural immersion, but only
slightly. In Santiago, the draw of nu
merous computers, free telephone
use, all of our class sessions, and
other Stanford students kept many
of us in the center up to its closing
hour.
To be sure, few students had
computers in their guest homes on
which to type class assignments, and
almost all students had much online
work to do related to their imminent
return to the home campus. Yet
what becomes of "cultural litera
cy"? With the OSP, the "Stanford
bubble" simply floats abroad.
What's more, SIS was a largely
English-speaking bubble. After the
Spanish-taught classes, students
usually reverted to English. We all
improved our Spanish while in
Chile, but for most of us, not to a sat
isfactory degree. The few SIS efforts
to counteract this linguistic isolation
— namely, meet-ups with Chilean

"language partners" —were, by SIS
adminstrators' own admission,
failures.
This linguistic isolation can only
be worse in other "Stanford-in" cen
ters. After all, the Santiago appli
cant pool emerges from the half of
the Stanford studentry that satisfies
its language requirement with Span
ish. Santiago is the only center (ex
cept Australia and Oxford) whose
classes are unvaryingly taught in the
native language. Berlin, Florence,
and Paris all offer English-taught
classes. In Kyoto, according to out
reach materials, education is strictly
in English. The newest center, in
Beijing?: "Primarily English."
No fair study of the OSP can
overlook homestays, which mitigat
ed the social and linguistic isolation
for most of us in Santiago. For me,
though, even the pull of a delightful
host family was only as strong as
that of my Stanford comrades.
In 10 weeks, we went to museums,
theaters, gyms and clubs — and vir
tually always with each other. In
deed, I spent more social time with
Stanford students in Santiago than I
do in the average quarter back home.
I'm tempted to suggest that Stanford
run its freshman orientation in Santi
ago — and scared to think that I
might be taken seriously.
Conversations with other OSP
alums suggest that what I have said
of SIS could fairly characterize any
of the other seven "Stanford-in"
centers. If a quarter in Santiago
glosses over the military-era eradi
cations, then what goes unseen in
Paris? What remains unknown in
Berlin? What of Beijing cannot be
translated to English? In a 10-week
OSP blow-by, you'd never know.
One final question, then: Is that re
ally an education?
