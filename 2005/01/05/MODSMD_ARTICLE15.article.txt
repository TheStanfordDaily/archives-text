## Why the world hates America...not freedom, but greed 
### PEER LANDA 
No matter where in this world
people come from, we all seem to
look after ourselves — whether it's
our family, our heritage or country
— we naturally protect and nurse
what's closest to our heart.
However, when we get too
much into the self-nursing, the na
tionalism, the egoism and greed,
that's when we lose our perspective
on the world and its people — and
that's when they, the other people,
take notice.
Opposed to what some propa
ganda outlets in this country want
us to believe, it's not our "free
dom" the world hates about us. Not
at all. People admire and envy free
dom. What they hate is our
pompous arrogance; our belief that
we are better and worth more than
other people — and yes, those
people are seeing this.
It's a bit ironic that this tsunami
catastrophe should occur on
Christmas — the very same day we

supposedly should be generous
and less greedy.
Even though this disaster has so
far claimed 155,000 lives, the U.S.
Government has only contributed
a fraction of the amount they've
spent on the Iraqi invasion. In rela
tion to gross wealth among each re
lief contributor, we again find the
aid amount from the United States
at the bottom.
And it doesn't help much that
our government tries to spin this
simple fact, as this again only
broadcasts their blatant arrogance
for the entire world. Yes, people in
the world do acknowledge this.
They also acknowledge that there
were less than 3,000 people killed
on Sept. 11, 2001, but three years
later approximately 100,000 peo
ple have died in the Iraqi invasion.
Are the Americans so much better
and worth so much more than
other people?
History teaches us that people
who embark on war have always
perceived themselves as superior

— killing is what those who grow
too arrogant do. History also
shows that every empire of its time
believed it would exist forever —
as do we. That's what happens
when we grow too arrogant — we
think of ourselves as indestructible
in our conquest.
Recent history also shows how
efficient propaganda can be used
in massaging the criteria of what
information should be brought to
the people, and what should be left
invisible.
An example of the latter is this
invisible world catastrophe that
goes on every day, before and after
this tsunami occurred, a catastro
phe called hunger. As the news /
media indulge in Peterson's mur
der and Jackson's pedophilia,
every day 24,000 children silently
starve to death.
Although this disturbing catas
trophe is currently obscured by our
media, it's naive to think it's kept
invisible for the rest of the world.
This is also a reason why the world

hates us — the most opulent nation
in history.
Certainly, something must be
done before the world mobilizes
and turns completely against us.
But when staggering statistics
along with the many international
pleas are constantly ignored by our
government, there is certainly no
reason to expect that the general
public can muster an undertaking
of this magnitude.
Although voluntarism is cute,
it's not very effective when it
comes to altering the course of
how we deal with the world. For
this we have to call on our elected
representatives.
However, a first step for us all
might be to (at least) recognize
that world starvation exists and is
an abnormal occurrence solely cre
ated by man, not by nature — and
hence can only be rectified by man.

on Sept. 11, 2001, but three years
later approximately 100,000 peo
ple have died in the Iraqi invasion.
Are the Americans so much better
and worth so much more than
other people?
History teaches us that people
who embark on war have always
perceived themselves as superior

— killing is what those who grow
too arrogant do. History also
shows that every empire of its time
believed it would exist forever —
as do we. That's what happens
when we grow too arrogant — we
think of ourselves as indestructible
in our conquest.
Recent history also shows how
efficient propaganda can be used
in massaging the criteria of what
information should be brought to
the people, and what should be left
invisible.
An example of the latter is this
invisible world catastrophe that
goes on every day, before and after
this tsunami occurred, a catastro
phe called hunger. As the news /
media indulge in Peterson's mur
der and Jackson's pedophilia,
every day 24,000 children silently
starve to death.
Although this disturbing catas
trophe is currently obscured by our
media, it's naive to think it's kept
invisible for the rest of the world.
This is also a reason why the world

hates us — the most opulent nation
in history.
Certainly, something must be
done before the world mobilizes
and turns completely against us.
But when staggering statistics
along with the many international
pleas are constantly ignored by our
government, there is certainly no
reason to expect that the general
public can muster an undertaking
of this magnitude.
Although voluntarism is cute,
it's not very effective when it
comes to altering the course of
how we deal with the world. For
this we have to call on our elected
representatives.
However, a first step for us all
might be to (at least) recognize
that world starvation exists and is
an abnormal occurrence solely cre
ated by man, not by nature — and
hence can only be rectified by man.
