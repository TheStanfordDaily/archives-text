## Continuing the holiday spirit by giving to those in need 
### 
By now, we all know about
the natural disaster that
has killed untold thou
sands in South-East Asia,
and while the tragedy remains fresh
in our collective consciousness, it
seems useful to reflect on how lucky
we are to he here and how most of
our problems pale in comparison to
those impacted by this catastrophe.
The same

tragedy could
never happen
here on such a
grand scale.
After a tsuna
mi that killed 165
people in Hawaii
in 1946, the pa
cific rim coun
tries installed
and maintain a
warning system

that would give people on land as
much as two hours notice of an in
coming tsunami.
Is there one for the Indian
Ocean? No. Was the threat of a
tsunami any less severe there? No.
While natural disasters can
strike anywhere, we in the devel
oped world are far better equipped
to handle them. We have the
money and the resources, hut they
do not.
OK so after the warning system
sounds, what's next? In all likeli
hood, some degree of panic ensues,
the roadways out of town get
jammed, and most people are still
stuck close to where they live.
But unlike many of the houses
that lie close to the water in under
developed countries, ours are not
made of bamboo and reeds with
thatched roofs.
Forget the fact that in a tsunami,
these houses are toast — imagine
living in one every day. Imagine no
indoor plumbing and going to the
bathroom in the same place that
you get your water. Imagine not
being able to heat your home in
winter and cool it in summer. And
we complain when our rooms here
are too warm?
So the wave hits the shore, and

certainly some houses crumble and
some people die, hut not entire
communities. The McDonald's
would prohahly stay open, and we'd
still be able to turn on the lights in
our homes.
We'd still be able to drink the
water that came out of the tap and
not have even more die on account
of a lack of potable water. We
wouldn't have to beg for relief from
other countries, who then respond
by donating what amounts to a frac
tion of a fraction of a percent of
their wealth.
We are helping. There has al
ready been more than a billion dol
lars raised by the entire world, but
such numbers can be deceiving. On
a per capita basis, the United States
is giving a mere dollar and some
cents per citizen while other coun
tries are giving more than $10 per
citizen.
One such country is Kuwait. The
Kuwaitis are currently giving $10
million, which equals $10.53 per cit
izen of their 950,000. And they are
worried that they are not giving
enough.
Kuwaitis realize that the world is
more connected than it may seem.
They realize that the people in
these affected countries make many
of the clothes we wear and the tech
nological products that we use.
For whatever reason we give —
guilt, shame, empathy, sympathy —
the important part is that we do
give. If you decide to take back that
new sweater, buy one on sale and
give the difference to bring potable
water to orphans in Sri Lanka, fine.
The important part is that we re
alize how lucky we are and give
back some of the wealth that these
people are not fortunate enough to
have.
Joseph Stalin once said that one
death was a tragedy, while a million
deaths is a statistic. Let's prove him
wrong.
