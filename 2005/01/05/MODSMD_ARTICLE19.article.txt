Tax cuts to blame for deficit
Bill Whalen's letter ("Let's take a
bow to fiscal conservatism," Jan. 4) ar
gues for restoring presidential line
item veto authority as a partial, largely
symbolic way to reduce the federal
deficit and the national debt.
Whalen claims the line-item veto
would curb Congressional "pork"
spending (on the order of $23 billion in
2(XM). but he ignores the elephant in
the fiscal room: Bush's tax cuts, mostly
for the wealthy, which will reduce fed
eral tax income by about 1.35 trillion
dollars over 10 years. A more balanced
tax policy, rather than a further expan
sion (if executive power, should be con
sidered in any serious search for ways
to help us awaken from our federal fis
cal nightmare.
