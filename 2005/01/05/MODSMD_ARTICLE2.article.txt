of 50. don't bother trying out.
The University will be the main
hub for the 2009 Senior Olympics,
the largest sporting event in the
world for seniors. The 15-day event
will feature 18 different sports and
will take place largely on campus. It
is expected to draw nearly 15.000
athletes and more than 35.000 spec
tators to the San Francisco Bay
Area.
"There are 18 medal sports," said
Phil Godfrey, viee president of the
National Senior games Association.
"Each one of them will be the largest
senior tournament in 2009. In sever
al of the sports, there will be over
1,000 athletes competing."
Godfrey said that sports like
swimming and track and field are ex
pected to have the highest participa
tion. but the athletes will also com
pete at archery and horseshoes.
Hosting the event should be prof
itable both to Stanford and to the
surrounding communities; the
NSGA estimates that the Senior
Olympics will have a positive eco
nomic impact of over $35 million.
With 15 of the 18 events on campus,
Stanford hopes fora financial boost.
However, some University adminis
trators also see it as a publicity op
portunity.
"It will bring Stanford national
recognition." said Stanford's Associ
ate Athletic Director Ray Purpur.
"It also brings another segment of
the population to Stanford-one
that otherwise might not come."
The Bay Area was chosen to host
the 2009 Senior Olympics through a
selection process in which several
cities presented bids to the NSGA.
The bid for the Bay Area was sub
mitted primarily due to the efforts of
the Bay Area Sports Organizing
Committee and of Stanford. After
collecting bids, the NSGA narrowed

down the choices to the Bay Area
and Houston. Texas. The NSGA
chose the Bay Area on the basis of
the facilities at Stanford and the ac
tive California lifestyle.

and California's affinity for active
healthy lifestyles makes this partner
