## The 						kids are bleeding out for attention 
### JOSH BASHARA THE GATEWAY 
(U-WIRE) OMAHA, Neb. —
This column was originally written
last spring. I wrote it shortly after a
sudden surge of Omaha-area close
calls dealing with school violence,
and for one reason or another, the
column never saw print. Unfortu
nately, though, the issue is still just is
relevant today as it was nine months
ago.
A local high school student was
disciplined after school officials
discovered a "hit list" the student
had written. The list included the
names of fellow high school stu
dents and teachers the young man
allegedly claimed he wanted to
kill.
The list came to the attention of
school officials when a student who
saw the list reported it, fearing the
student might harm his classmates.
Up until now, I've always shied
away from addressing the issue of
school violence in Manic Digres
sion. Ever since that spring day in
April of 1999, when Dylan Klebold
and Eric Harris walked into
Columbine High School and mur
dered 13 people, it's been a subject
that hits just a little too close to
home.
However, in light of recent local
events and the subject matter being
injected into the mainstream via
films like "Elephant" and "Bowling
for Columbine," I've decided to
pitch in my two cents, for whatever
it's worth.
You see, I'm sympathetic. Not
just to the victims of Columbine, but
to the shooters as well. I'm sympa
thetic to the entire damned incident.
I don't take an ounce of pride in
admitting that I had violent fan
tasies involving my classmates back
in junior high and high school, but I
did. Regardless of the morality of
such daydreams, they crept their
way into my mind on an almost daily
basis.
Not unlike millions of others, I
had it pretty rough in school. Grow
ing up fat, dorky and unpopular
should come with a manual on how

not to end up slicing your wrists
open by the time you're 18, but un
fortunately that's not a luxury many
kids get. Most of the time, they have
to settle fora childhood of pain and
rejection.
It's impossible to relate to this
condition unless you've gone
through it yourself. If not, don't
even try. The same goes for school
faculty, parents and even mental
health professionals. The best that
you can hope to do is understand
the cause and effect of this phe
nomenon, analyze those parameters
into a paradigm and then produce a
solution.
I realize that most people under
estimate the severity of school-re
lated adolescent trauma. I'm quite
sure we all did, especially before the
Columbine shootings. But to those
who might be thinking that school is
"rough for everybody" or that "kids
are cruel and you've just got to suck
it up," let me assure you that the tor
ture that can be inflicted upon chil
dren by their peers is an anguish
that would drive most of us to the
breaking point, let alone pre
pubescent kids.
Although I harbor no pleasure
for daydreaming about killing my
tormenting classmates, it's not
something I'm ashamed of, either.
My imagination was the only outlet
I had to vent my frustrations. I could
act things out in my head so that —
if even for an hour — it took the
edge off. I imagine it's the same for
countless other teens.
But in the case of Klebold and
Harris, their imagination wasn't
enough to quench their vindictive
ness. Somehow, their fantasies
ended up bleeding out into the real
world and costa dozen kids and a
teacher their lives.
However visceral their endgame,
it's not my belief that the measure of
their torment necessarily had a di
rect relationship with their decision
to murder their classmates. In other
words, the response doesn't match
the affliction. If it did. one can only
imagine that they were tormented
to such an extent that they had no
other option to take the action they

did — which, of course, we know
can't be true.
So what was the key, then?
What's the magic variable that de
termines whether or not an impres
sionable young kid — hungering for
acceptance, more than anything —
steps over the line and actually com
mits murder?
. The answer isn't as elusive at it
may seem. Other than severe men
tal psychosis (which I truly don't
believe was the case in Columbine,
based on court documents and
other information that has been
released), it all boils down to the
manner in which the child is
raised.
1 can easily — and validly — use
myself as an example. Although I
frequently entertained these violent
thoughts, I never truly possessed the
ability to make them a reality. 1 was
raised by loving parents, surround
ed by caring relatives and nurtured
by diligent role models.
The matter isn't necessarily one
of intelligence; reports of the
Columbine incident indicated that
both shooters — while perhaps so
cially inept — possessed above-av
erage intellects.
It's about love and attention,
kindness and empathy. Not just
from adults, but childhood peers as
well. It's about educating teachers
and school officials not to look the
other way when 13-year-old Billy
gets called a "faggot" during passing
period. It's about taking responsi
bility for the world that we let our
children live in.
What if Klebold and Harris
would have learned the value of a
human life when they were growing
up? What if a teacher had noticed
one of them being bullied in class,
instead of noticing the rebellious
clothing they were wearing?
What if a classmate, just like
the one here in Omaha at the local
high school, gave a little extra
thought to a comment made in
passing? Maybe if those things had
happened, there wouldn't be two
dozen parents in Columbine who
had to bury their children five
years ago this spring.
