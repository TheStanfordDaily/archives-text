## Bradford, Moore gone; Morris ineligible 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Off to an 0-2 start in Pacific-10 Conference play
and with the Arizona schools coming to town this
week, the Stanford men's basketball team was dealt
a couple of off-the-court blows Tuesday.
Two weeks after fellow two-sport teammate
Mark Bradford announced he was leaving the bas
ketball team to concentrate solely on football,
sophomore big man on the hardwood and receiver
on the gridiron Evan Moore made the same decision.
More surprisingly redshirt freshman guard Tim
Morris was declared academically ineligible for
winter quarter by the NCAA.
An NCAA rule designed to raise graduation
rates and prevent student athletes from skipping
classes during the season requires that students
pass at least six units toward their degree every aca
demic quarter in order to compete in the following
quarter.
Morris, who was enrolled in the intensive 10-
unit Human Biology core last quarter, did not pass
the necessary units.
"Although I doubt cases like mine are the in
tended target of this particular NCAA legislation, I
take full responsibility for having put myself in this
situation," said Morris in a press release. "I apolo
gize to mv teammates and coaches. I will do every

thing within my power to contribute to this year's
effort."
Morris will be allowed to practice with the team
this quarter and did so yesterday. Stanford, which is
down to just nine scholarship players, appealed the
decision with the NCAA, and a hearing is sched
uled for Jan. 18.
"He will be missed," said head coach Trent
Johnson. "He started to play extremely well in the
rotation. The unfortunate thing about this rule is
that it could create incentives for players to take
easy classes rather than challenging themselves."
"Tim's incredibly smart and works hard," said
teammate Carlton Weatherby, who took the
Human Biology core last year. "They try to weed
you out in that class. He was going across one of
Stanford's toughest majors, and I know there are
several non-athletes who get weeded out every
quarter."
Weatherby indicated that the news came as a
shock to everyone.
While players have access to academic advisers,
Weatherby said that given the weight of the final
exam in the Human Biology core, Morris may not
have thought he was in danger of failing heading
into the final.
The announcement came two days after Morris
made his first career start in a narrow loss at Wash
ington.

He had 12 points against the Huskies and was av
eraging 7.4 points per game.
Morris indicated that he will not let the NCAA's
decision change his goal of becoming a doctor.
"I came to Stanford because it offers the best
combination of academics and basketball in the
world," Morris said. "I intend to take on both areas
full-speed ahead."
Moore, the Cardinal's second leading receiver
with 39 catches for 616 yards and six touchdowns, ap
peared in four games for the Cardinal basketball
team this season.
"I support Evan whole-heartedly," Johnson
said. "Evan has an extremely bright future in foot
ball, and I think with the coaching change it was a
good decision. I'm very happy for him."
Bradford, who appeared in two games this sea
son, left the team after scoring two points in four
minutes in Stanford's 84-66 win over Montana on
Dec. 23.
The receiving duo could use the extra time to be
come familiar with new football head coach Walt
Harris.
With Morris, Moore and Bradford out, sopho
more guard Fred Washington, junior point guard
Jason Haas and freshmen Taj Finger and Peter
Prowitt will see more playing time, and Johnson is
confident the entire team will step up.
