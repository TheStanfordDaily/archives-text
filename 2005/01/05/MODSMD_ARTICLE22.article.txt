Alexander the Great was a celebrated
war hero who conquered countries be
fore he ever said goodbye to his teen
years. So who's going to tell Candice
Wiggins she can't be a freshman leader
for the No. 8 Cardinal and conquer the
basketball court?
Wiggins helped the Stanford women's
basketball team (11-2, 3-1 Pac-10) pull
away from the Washington Huskies (6-8,
2-2). The Cardinal boasted a well-bal
anced offense that methodically stayed in
front of the Huskies, eventually winning
74-61.
Both teams started the game slowly,
struggling on the offensive ends of the
floor. Stanford made only one of its first
nine field goal attempts and was 5-for-17

midway through the first, half. The
Huskies were no better, starting 6-of-15
and then making only one of their next
nine shots.
The teams traded blows occasionally,
as the Huskies countered Stanford's
strong inside trio of T'Nae Thiel. Kristen
Newlin and Brooke Smith with accurate
outside shooting. The Huskies played
tough man-to-man defense that forced
the Cardinal into off-balance shots.
But Stanford ended the half with a 13-
8 run fora 33-29 lead at the break.
Wiggins came out of the locker room
with a purpose, sparking the Cardinal
with 12 second-half points. In one se
quence, Wiggins pulled down a rebound,
ran the length of the court to drain a short
jumper, came back on the defensive end
to come up with a steal and take it coast
to coast to draw the foul. Wiggins was 9-

for-9 from the free-throw line, scoring 15
points, pulling down several rebounds,
and adding three assists and two steals.
She is the early-season favorite to win
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year honors.
The young Huskies, with no seniors,
could find no answers for the Cardinal's
strong inside game. Newlin added 14
points, a season-high 11 rebounds and
two blocks, and Smith had 12 points, 10
rebounds and two blocks.
The Cardinal improved to 32-2 on
their home court dating back to the 2002-
03 season. Stanford beat Washington for
the third straight time and for the sixth
time in seven games.
The Huskies never seemed to be able
to establish any dominant game inside
the paint against the 6-foot-3 Smith.
Kristen O'Neill, who missed last season
with a knee injury, led the Husky attack

from the outside with four 3-pointers and
finished with 16 points, six rebounds and
three assists for Washington, which shot
31.5 percent, was out-rebounded 56-44
and committed 18 turnovers. Guard Jill
Bell added 11 points.
Smith, a talented transfer center from
Duke, made an impact on both ends for
Stanford in the second half, going hard to
the glass and sparking the offense with
her quick passes. She scored back-to
back baskets to give the Cardinal an
eight-point lead. Senior guard Kelley
Suminski followed with a lay-in, and
Newlin's next basket gave Stanford a 12-
point lead, 49-37.
At one point in the first half, Newlin
scored six straight points in one spurt, but
