# Card set to defend two-year Rose Bowl Regatta title
## 
### STEPHEN DORSEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the spring season just around the corner,
the Cardinal sailing team competed strongly in
last weekend's Sugar Bowl. Stanford has the
ability to perform even greater in the upcoming
Rose Bowl — not at a football stadium, but at a
regatta.
Stanford finished a narrow second in the
Sugar Bowl when it traveled to the Southern
Yacht Club in New Orleans. This weekend's
Rose Bowl will be held at Long Beach in Los An
geles. Calif.
The Cardinal initially tied for first with Dart
mouth at the Sugar Bowl, but after losing the
tiebreaker, they finished second.
The sailing team, which had a slow start during
the first six races on Saturday, regrouped
overnight and had a strong finish on Sunday to
force the tiebreaker. Unlike team competition,
the co-ed regatta did not have a sudden death to
break a tie in points; instead the winner was de
termined by which team placed higher in previ
ous races.
The regatta, hosted by Tulane University, was
an enjoyable event as the sailors were greeted on

Saturday with ideal winds ranging from 12-15
knots and beautiful weather reaching 70 degrees.
Eddie Conrad and senior Ali Salatti sailed for Di
vision A, while Jeff Allen teamed with senior
Lucy Horton for Division B.
"We're happy to do so well, and having a na
tive of New Orleans — Eddie Conrad — sailing
with us was helpful," Sallati said. "We are a
strong team, and we need to execute what we
have learned at the regattas."
The No. 9 co-ed team will have to sail well this
weekend at the Rose Bowl in order to defend its
title. The Cardinal have won the Rose Bowl the
past two years. Although the Bowl is considered
a fall regatta, it marks the beginning of the spring
season for Stanford.
The Rose Bowl is the most popular West
Coast regatta, bringing the most East Coast
schools to compete.
"We have had a strong fall season, and we want
to continue our good performance into the spring
season." said assistant coach Amy Gross-Kehoe.
"We want to defend our title this weekend."

Despite a sharp turnaround on Sunday and a first-place tie in points,
Stanford finished second to Dartmouth at the Sugar Bowl regatta. The
No. 9 co-ed team next travels to Southern California for the Rose Bowl,
a regatta that draws much East Coast competition.

Emery Wager and Becca Levin will sail in Divi
sion B.
"We are confident going into this regatta
because we have been working hard all sea
son," Levin said. "This is an important regatta,
and it will be good practice."
After the Rose Bowl, the Stanford Sailing
team will not compete in another intersectional
event until February. The Cardinal will use this
time to workout and to have chalk talks covering
the team's strategies.
The Cardinal expect a good showing at the
three-season ending National Championships in
June with strong races in women, team racing
and sleet racing divisions.
