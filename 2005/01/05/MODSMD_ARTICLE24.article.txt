""Dodgeball is a sport of violence, exclu
sion, and degradation."
— Seven-time ADAA All-Star Patches
O'Houlihan
Early on, life divides us into two categories:
the hunters and the hunted. While social
norms have organized us into a suit-and-tie
army of middle managers, the raw animalistic
urge to hit someone in the face with a red
Olympia playball still lurks beneath.

There are precious few
outlets for these underlying
feelings, and they only grow
scarcer as we get older. Col
lege is usually your last
chance to play a competitive
sport on a regular basis, un
less you're Josh Childress or
you call recreation league
softball "competitive."
When I came to Stanford,

I vastly outjumped my own talent in any par
ticular sport. I played baseball in high school,
but the only chance I would have of walking
on to the team here would be if all members of
SAE came down with Natty Ice-induced
aneurysms in the same week. My innate need
to beat people was going hungry, and I, des
perate, resorted to punching babies and berat
ing elderly women to get my fix.
Intramural sports weren't helping either;
I was robbed of a softball title last year by in
competent umpiring, and I'm not good
enough at any other sport to organize a dom
inant team. As a junior, the possibility of
graduating without an "Intramural Champi
ons" shirt was becoming frighteningly real to
me.
And then Zeus spoke in IM Commissioner
Jay Jackson's ear and told him to introduce in
tramural dodgeball this fall. For those of you
unfamiliar with the competitive wet dream
that is Stanford dodgeball, consult the IM
website or the movie Dodgeball, which ade
quately sums up the rules. I vowed to my
teammates — mostly former members of the
disgraced softball team from the year before
— that we would emerge victorious.
And thus, Dan Blatnik and the Electrical
Engineering Grad All-Stars were born. We
were an unstoppable juggernaut, from our
name (carefully conceived to lull opponents
into a false sense of security) to our stacked
lineup of former high school baseball players.
At this point, if the saga of Stanford dodgeball
were a movie, there would be an elaborate
Rocky-style montage showing our completion
of an undefeated regular season.
Every Saturday night, we looked forward
to pounding hapless opponents into oblivion.
While other people were out drinking, we
were pummeling freshman dorms and icing
our arms ... then drinking.
This was all, of course, just buildup to the
real deal: the one-day, 16-team playoff tour
nament culled from the original field of 49
teams. After blowing through the first two
rounds and defeating 680 in the semifinals in a
grueling game that could be called "hotly con
tested" in the same way that the St. Louis Car
dinals could claim they were the second-best
team in baseball last year, we waited for our
opponent in the finals.
On the other side of Ford Center, the Jort
Warriors were facing Notorious B. A.L.L.Z. in
an overtime shootout. If you don't know what
Jorts are, I'll pause here to let you look it up,
dry-heave at the thought of ten hairy, muscu
lar grad students wearing them while playing
dodgeball, and then resume reading. The
match itself was complemented by about 100
people crowding the sidelines with enough
Coors Light to get Sam Cassell laid.
