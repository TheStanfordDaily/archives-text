# Freshman standout leaves UPenn basketball squad
## 
### JEFF GREENWALD DAILY PENNSYLVANIA (U. PENN 
U-WIRE— Heading into a New Year's Eve showdown
against Big-5 rival Villanova, the Penn men's basketball
team seemed to be setting its rotation for Ivy League play,
which begins in four weeks
That rotation took a big hit when freshman Michael
Kach informed Penn coach Fran Dunphy that he was leav
ing the team. .
Kach was the only Quakers freshman to provide any
significant impact so far this season. In six games for
Penn, the Carmel, N.Y., native was averaging 13.2 min
utes, 3.7 points and one rebound per contest. He had be
come the first guard off the bench in the Quakers' three
guard system.
Kach told Dunphy during the finals period that he no
longer had the same fire or overwhelming passion to play
the game. The freshman did not want to let his teammates
down by not putting his entire heart into the team, so he
opted to leave the program.
"I respected [his decision] and we will support it in any
way we can," Dunphy said.
"I don't know if I agree with his decision," the coach

added.
Kach appeared as though he would provide a nice com
plement to Penn's hand of sophomores: Ibby Jaaber, Ryan
Pettinella, Mark Zoller and Steve Danley. However his
departure quickly nixed any possibility that the five could
play together during the next two and a half seasons.
Kach was receiving a large amount of playing time for
a freshman and it seemed unlikely to his coach that his sit
uation on the court would have led to his departure.
"He was playing a significant role with the team so the
only thing I can think is more of a personal issue than a
basketball issue," Dunphy said.
Dunphy expects to replace Kach's minutes with a mix
ture of freshmen David Whitehurst and junior Friedrich
Ebede but noted that Ebede will see most of the minutes
left in the wake of Kach's departure. Penn's coach also
said senior Eric Heil may see additional playing time. The
trio has only logged a total of 81 minutes through seven
games; Kach alone had 79.
The Quakers hope that Ebede can provide the same
spark off the bench and respite for starters that Kach
and Zoller have so far. Dunphy pointed to Ebede's per
formance during the Quakers' last game against Tem
ple, in which Kach did not play, as evidence that Ebede
can step in and play well. In that game, Ebede hit a

clutch 3-pointer, grabbed an important rebound and
wowed the crowd with a dunk during the first half of the
Owls' 52-51 victory.
Although Dunphy expressed confidence in Ebede, he
said the junior must continue to improve.
"He needs to improve on the consistency of his play,
and if he could bring better defense and more rebounding
that would be great as well." Dunphy said.
Kach could not be reached for comment, but his depar
ture from the team appears permanent for now.
Dunphy left the door open fora return.
"It's disappointing that we won't have Mike, but it is
what it is and we'll move on," Dunphy said. "He's a mem
ber of our family ... if things change we can certainly sit
down and discuss the issues and decide whatever would be
best for Mike."
The team has had several weeks to prepare for the
remainder of the season — Penn has not played a game
in 23 days — and has also had time to integrate new
players into the regular rotation in place of Kach. Dun
phy believes the bigger issue will be shaking off the rust
from the long layoff, not playing without Kach.
The Red and Blue will play its next three games on the
road as the Quakers follow up their trip to Villanova with
engagements at San Francisco and at Illinois-Chicago.

Although Dunphy expressed confidence in Ebede, he
said the junior must continue to improve.
"He needs to improve on the consistency of his play,
and if he could bring better defense and more rebounding
that would be great as well." Dunphy said.
Kach could not be reached for comment, but his depar
ture from the team appears permanent for now.
Dunphy left the door open fora return.
"It's disappointing that we won't have Mike, but it is
what it is and we'll move on," Dunphy said. "He's a mem
ber of our family ... if things change we can certainly sit
down and discuss the issues and decide whatever would be
best for Mike."
The team has had several weeks to prepare for the
remainder of the season — Penn has not played a game
in 23 days — and has also had time to integrate new
players into the regular rotation in place of Kach. Dun
phy believes the bigger issue will be shaking off the rust
from the long layoff, not playing without Kach.
The Red and Blue will play its next three games on the
road as the Quakers follow up their trip to Villanova with
engagements at San Francisco and at Illinois-Chicago.
