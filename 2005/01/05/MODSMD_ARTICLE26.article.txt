# Golden Bears fall in Holiday Bowl despite efforts of overlooked star
## 
### RORY BRUNNER U-WIRE 
U-WIRE — For the 12th time in 12
games this season, California senior
running back J.J. Arrington went
over the 100-yard mark at the Dec.
30 Holiday Bowl.
But, once again, his efforts will go
largely overlooked on the national
radar as the Texas Tech Red Raiders
hung 45 on the BCS-snubbed No. 4
Bears in the 45-31 final.
"I think I 'm the best running back
in the nation," Arrington said. "I
don't get no love from anybody. [I'm
the] first back ever in the Pac-10 with
2,000 yards without winning the
Heisman.
"I'm snubbed by everybody."
With All-Pac-10 receiver and
school receptions leader Geoff
McArthur out with a broken leg for
Cal's bowl game against Texas Tech
— having sustained the injury in the
regular season finale against South
ern Miss — the Bears had no choice

but to saddle up on Arrington and
see how far he could ride.
Arrington did his part, running 21
times for 173 yards — a 6.9 yards
per-carry average — and a touch
down on the game. He was over 100
yards at halftime, breaking a Pac-10
record by rushing for triple digits in
12 games, topping Marcus Allen's
11-game streak set in 1981. He hit
the 2,000-yard mark for rushing
yards in a season, joining Allen and
O.J. Simpson as the only Pac-10
backs to ever do so.
But that would not offset a pass
ing attack mainly MIA and an off
day for Cal quarterback Aaron
Rodgers. Rodgers was just 9-of-20
for 87 yards and a pick in the first half
as Tech held a 24-14 lead at the
break.
Forced to pass more in the second
half after looking at a 38-14 deficit,
Rodgers threw fora touchdown and
ran one in himself to make it a re
spectable 45-31, though the final put a
damper on Cal's BCS statement and

another superb day by Arlington.
"He ran great; he runs great every
week," said Cal coach Jeff Tedford.
"You talk about a guy that doesn't
miss practice. Ever. Not one play has
J.J. missed in practice all year. He's
durable, he provides a tremendous
spark for us, continually and he
played great again tonight."
Whereas the 5-foot-11, 210-
pound Arrington hopes NFL teams
don't overlook his stats and talent in
the upcoming draft, Cal's 2005 run
may depend on Arrington's junior
teammate Rodgers and his plans for
next season.
At the post-game press confer
ence, Rodgers said frankly, "No
comment."
On the field after the game, he went
into a little more detail about leaving
the program after such a defeat.
"It's frustrating. 1 feel like I have
a lot left to prove. I'm going to think
about it the next couple days, talk
about it with my family and then
make a decision."
