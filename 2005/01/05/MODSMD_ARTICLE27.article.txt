### BRIAN SMITH OREGON DAILY EMERALD (U. OF OREGON 
U-WIRE — I hate bowl games.
That's right, I hate 'em.
Well, aspects of them at least.
At the same time, I do still love
them.
I love the fact that I can watch
the No. 1 and 2 ranked offenses in
the nation (Louisville and Boise
State), which don't disappoint and
end up slugging it out 44-40.
I love the fact that the next
Michael Vick was on display in the
Rose Bowl.
1 love the fact that teams really
can win on the final play of the
game. Hey LSU, way to play great
prevent defense.
But there is nothing that annoys
me more than the influence that
corporations now have on college
football and their disheartening, if
not maddening, presence.
By the end of the first quarter of
the Rose Bowl, I was reciting the
new Motorola commercial for their
slim phone.
I wasn't even through my first
plate of food before I had seen three
Tostitos chip commercials (which
made the food I was eating seem in
ferior, because it didn't inspire me
to make construction noises while
eating to bond with my family).
First Quarter Tally:
Tostitos Count: 3
Cingular/Nokia Count: 2
Ford Count: 1
Plates of Food: 1
Annoyed, ves. Disheartened?

Getting there.
It's pretty easy to get to that
point when you have to get through
the following: Home Depot Solu
tions to the Game. First down and
ten brought to you by AOL. Stadi
um refreshments by Coke. Dr. Pep
per Halftime Show. Cingular
Pregame Show. Chevrolet Player of
the Game. Aerial view brought to
you by the Goodyear Blimp. The
Aflac Trivia Question.
The Air that Players Breathe
brought to you by Aquafina (The
Best Tasting Air Ever. Period.)
Mascots appearing thanks to the
generous donation by Foot Locker.
The American flag brought to you
by Liberty Insurance.
A1 Michael's words brought to
you by Radio Shack.
Stop it!
The horrible thing is, only about
45 percent of the stadium / field /
players are covered by logos.
There are so many more possi
bilities.
Soon the yardage markers will
look like NASCAR cars and the
goal posts will be provided courtesy
of Time Warner.
Furthermore, the network will
be subject to removal if it does not
air more than five CNN commer
cials in an hour.
Maybe instead of referees just
participating in beer commercials,
they will be forced to wear uniforms
with Coors Light emblazoned
across their chest.
In addition, there will be match
ing beer helmets.
Standard equipment, you under

stand.
Soon, penalties will sound like
this: "Holding on the offense, num
ber 68,10 yards from the spot of the
foul, second down. Play beer!"
Coaches will be forced to drink
Pepsi or Coke during the game.
Games will be stretched to six
hours so all products can get their
just time.
And I will not be watching any of
it because I will be out trying to buy
everything that is on television, be
cause that is what Americans do.
Yar! (When I get frustrated, I re
vert to pirate-isms. Sorry.)
Hey Motorola, I get it, your
phone is thin!
Hey Ford, I get it, you're re
defining the class of sedan / SUV /
big-ass, unneeded vehicle — again!
Hey Tostitos, I get it, you can use
the chip as a bowl!
I get it, but I don't want to get
your product!
Why must you beat me over the
head with it?
I sat there and watched both the
Rose Bowl presented by Citißank
and the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.
About seven hours of football (give
or take).
Plus an hour and a half of com
mercials (give or take.)
Final Tally (give or take):
Tostitos Count: 12
Cingular Count: 15
Plates of Food Count: 4
Beers Drank: 0
Beers I Wish I Had Drank By
Then: 26
