# Google to put library online
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A year and a half after Stan
ford University Libraries ac
quired new machinery to digitize
library and Stanford University
Press materials, Stanford is part
nering with Google Inc. in its
quest to make more literary re
sources available online.
Google announced on Dec. 14
that along with Stanford, the com
pany would be partnering with

Harvard University, the Universi
ty of Michigan, the University of
Oxford and The New York Public
Library to digitize parts of their li
brary collections in an expansion
of the Google Print program. The
program allows Internet users to
search the texts of books and
other offline materials through a
regular Google search.
Stanford has been digitizing
texts for years, but partnering with
Google will ease the technical and
financial constraints that limited

previous efforts, according to
Michael A. Keller, Stanford Uni
versity librarian and publisher of
both the Stanford University
Press and the High Wire Press,
Stanford's online co-publishing
service for scholarly journals.
"We expect that students will
use the on-line resources to their
maximum potential." Keller said.
"Making the contents of articles
and books available for indexing
will make more information and
knowledge more available more of
the time for Stanford and other
communities," Keller said.
There is no set number of books
that will be digitized, though Stan
ford's agreement with Google cov
ers all University libraries, and the
number could be upwards of two
million volumes in the first phase,
according to Keller.
"There is no set time either,
though the agreement is of a fixed
length, a number of years," Keller
said.
The Google Print program allows
users to search the entire body of
materials no longer under copy
right-materials that were published
prior to 1923 â€” and also displays
parts of books that are still copy
righted.
Stanford will send its collections
to Google's scanning facilities,
where the books can be scanned and
the text converted for indexing
without slicing the binding or harm
ing the books in any other way.
"Google's mission is to organize
the world's information, and we're
excited to be working with libraries
to help make this mission a reality,"
Google co-founder and Stanford
alum Larry Page said in a Dec. 14
press release.
Keller said that probably thou
sands of volumes at a time will be
digitized, and that the books will be
unavailable for about a week on av
erage per volume during the
process.
Keller said he first talked with
Page about the idea of partnering
Stanford with Google to digitize

Stanford's libraries at a meeting
about four years ago.
"We got started with them by in
volving High Wire publishers in a
backset conversion project about a
year ago," Keller said. "Intense dis
cussions on this project began in
Sept. 2004."
There are many other digitization
projects underway at Stanford,
Keller noted.
"None of them approach the
Google one in scale, but almost all
of them are significant with regard
to ultimately making more and
more information and knowledge
accessible via the Web," he said.
In the spring of 2003, Stanford
University Libraries acquired the
Digitizing Line robot, which al-

Two million volumes to
be included in first phase

lowed the University to safely digi
tize its own collections.
In addition, Stanford helped de
velop Stanford Grokker, an online
tool collects search results from
search engines like Google or
Yahoo. Socrates, Stanford's online
catalog and other relevant databases,
and then groups them visually in an
interactive map so users can easily
explore and research various topics.
Keller said making materials
available online will not make li
braries obsolete.
"It is better not to think of li
braries as buildings, but as aggrega
tions of data, information, and
knowledge - some in physical form,
some in digital form, some in both,"
he said.
