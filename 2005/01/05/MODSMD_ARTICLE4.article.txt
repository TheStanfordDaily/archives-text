# Sleep loss tied to weight gain

Could those I-HUM all-nighters be responsible for
the freshman fifteen? Although researchers are not
positive, a recent study from the School of Medicine
suggests that sleep deprivation can contribute to weight
gain.
Along with a number of similar studies, the Stanford
research suggested a bridge between lack of sleep and
the treatment of obesity. So for those just trying to shed
a few extra pounds, some old-fashioned shut-eye
should not be overlooked as an alternative to fad diets.
Published last month, the research looked at the
sleeping habits of more than a thousand people. An
array of evidence was taken into account, but it is the
levels of two hormones that regulate appetite - ghrelin
and leptin - which led scientists to link lack of sleep
with a higher likelihood of obesity.
Ghrelin triggers appetite in humans and was found
at higher levels in those who regularly under-slept.
Going from eight to five hours of sleep per night corre
sponded to a substantial increase in ghrelin.
Leptin lets the body know when it is full and should
stop eating, and it was found at much lower levels in
sleep-deprived individuals. That same shift from eight to
five hours of nightly sleep corresponded to a drop in lep
tin â€” presumably producing a weaker signal when it tells
the body to close that box of Krispy Kreme donoughts.
Stanford researchers also discovered that the Body
Mass Index - a standard measure of weight - was near
ly four percent higher in people who slept only five
hours per night. Subjects who got 7.7 hours had the best
weight profiles.
And as many students know, more late nights can
