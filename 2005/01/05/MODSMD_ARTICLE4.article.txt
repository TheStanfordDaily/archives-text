# Sleep loss tied to weight gain

### SIMON SHUSTER 
Could those I-HUM all-nighters be responsible for
the freshman fifteen? Although researchers are not
positive, a recent study from the School of Medicine
suggests that sleep deprivation can contribute to weight
gain.
Along with a number of similar studies, the Stanford
research suggested a bridge between lack of sleep and
the treatment of obesity. So for those just trying to shed
a few extra pounds, some old-fashioned shut-eye
should not be overlooked as an alternative to fad diets.
Published last month, the research looked at the
sleeping habits of more than a thousand people. An
array of evidence was taken into account, but it is the
levels of two hormones that regulate appetite - ghrelin
and leptin - which led scientists to link lack of sleep
with a higher likelihood of obesity.
Ghrelin triggers appetite in humans and was found
at higher levels in those who regularly under-slept.
Going from eight to five hours of sleep per night corre
sponded to a substantial increase in ghrelin.
Leptin lets the body know when it is full and should
stop eating, and it was found at much lower levels in
sleep-deprived individuals. That same shift from eight to
five hours of nightly sleep corresponded to a drop in lep
tin â€” presumably producing a weaker signal when it tells
the body to close that box of Krispy Kreme donoughts.
Stanford researchers also discovered that the Body
Mass Index - a standard measure of weight - was near
ly four percent higher in people who slept only five
hours per night. Subjects who got 7.7 hours had the best
weight profiles.
And as many students know, more late nights can


Stanford researchers have found that people who
get 7.7 hours of sleep have the best weight profiles
also lead to more late-night snack
ing.
Dr. Ling Lin, one of the study's
co-authors, admitted that there was
no way to control what the subjects
were eating during those extra hours
spent awake.
"My son is in college, and when
he is staying up, everyone is ordering
pizza around him." Lin said. "So of
course the students are going to gain
weight."
But the Stanford research was not
alone in its findings. Diane Austin,
the project's biostatistician, noted
that the results were in line with a
number of other recent studies. For
example, a similar study conducted
at the University of Chicago showed
the same connection between losing
sleep and gaining weight, and it did

so with a small, tightly controlled
sample of college-age men.
"There is more research going on,
and it needs to happen, but the re
cent findings are compelling enough
that people should think about their
[sleep] schedules when they try to
lose weight," Austin said.
With nearly 70 percent of Amer
icans overweight or obese, according
to the North American Association
for the Study of Obesity, these find
ings could lead to a new direction for
weight research.
"Altering sleep duration may
prove to be an important adjunct to
preventing and treating obesity," the
Stanford study reported.
Moreover, a statistic put out by
NYU's Sleep Disorders Center last
March claims that 90 percent of col-

lege students suffer from sleep de
privation. And whether myth or not,
the infamous freshman fifteen con
cerns many college students. Could
more sleep be the solution?
"1 do worry about the freshman
fifteen" said one Stanford female,
who asked not to be named because
she did not want her peers to think
that she was concerned about her
weight. "And I guess this [research]
will help get me out of those 4 a.m.
hallway conversations and into bed,"
she added.
The study was published in the
Public Library of Science and was
spearheaded by Assoc. Prof, of Psy
chiatry and Behavioral Sciences Em
manuel Mignot, along with his col
leagues at Stanford and the Univer
sity of Wisconsin-Madison.
