On Jan. 5,1959, The Daily ran a story
about Stanford's decision to buy land
to establish what has become Sierra
Camp, a summer camp for Universi
ty alumni. Below is the story.
"Stanford has purchased Fallen
Leaf Lodge, a former boys' camp
five miles from the southern end of
Lake Tahoe, fora summer alumni
camp, according to the Stanford
Camp Association.
The resort, to be known as Stan
ford Sierra Club, will be operated
by the Stanford Camp Association.
It includes 52 one- to four-room
cabins and a few hotel-type rooms
and is situated on Fallen Leaf
Lake.
The lodge may also be devel
oped as a ski lodge for winter use in
future years, said Wallace Cath
cart. president of the Stanford
Camp Association.
The camp was purchased from
Mrs. Harriet Price Craven and Mrs.
Frances Price Street, both Stanford
graduates, for $150,000. and it has
been unofficially associated with
Stanford for several years.
'Fallen Leaf Lake, in the summer,
is an old and worthy Stanford tradi
tion and the University is grateful
that the efforts of the Camp Associ
ation will preserve it for alumni and
their families,' said President J. E.
Wallace Sterling."

On Jan. 5,1982, The Daily ran a story
about storms that caused San Fran
cisquito Creek to swell, threatening
possible evacuation of residents.
Some policemen blamed the creek's
height on the University's water poli
cies. Below is an excerpt.
"Officials of the University Dept.
of Facilities and Services decided to
open the floodgates to Searsville
Lake at approximately 4:30 p.m. yes
terday because the lake was 'over
flowing over the top of the gate,' ac
cording to Jason Mavis, director of
Facilities and Services. The water
wasn't flowing out fast enough to
prevent the lake from overflowing a
county road.'
Responding to charges that the de
cision top open the gates swelled the
creek. Mavis said, 'With this kind of
rain (opening the Searsvill Lake
gates) may have increased the flow on
the San Francisquito, but there would
have been very little difference.
The water from the lake will fill
Lake Laguinta, which will remain
full through the spring.
On campus, University police
used flares and saw horses to narrow
Palm Drive to a single lane. Water
blocked sections of Galvez Avenue
and smaller streets.
At least a dozen University work
ers were on duty to react to problems
created by the storm, according to
Mavis.
