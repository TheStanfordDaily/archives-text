# New Council to hear Mefford election appeal
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Constitutional Council, which recent
ly filled four of its five seats with new members, will
hold a hearing Monday regarding a case brought by
senior Dylan Mefford last May.
The suit challenges the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate's decision not to certify the results of the
spring ASSU executive election, which was won by
vice-presidential candidate Mefford and his running
mate, fifth-year student and then-presidential can
didate Mikey Lee.
The controversy centered on a campaign e-mail
that Lee, at the time a senior class president, sent to
the Class of 2004 mailing list. The Senate argued
that Lee's e-mail was an abuse of power and ruled to
hold a special election, of which the winners were
current president Chioke Borgelt-Mose and vice
president Kory Vargas Caro, both juniors.
Mefford described his suit as an argument based
on free-speech rights.
"Endorsements and e-mail are forms of free
speech recognized by the University," he said. "The
ASSU Constitution has the same protections of free
speech as U.S. Constitution."
Mefford emphasized that his continued involve
ment in the case did not stem from a desire for per
sonal gain. He and Senate Chair Chris Lin. a senior,
both said that a Mefford victory would not affect the
current leadership of the ASSU.
"The basic point of the case is just to raise aware
ness of the need for reform of the ASSU election
and certification processes and of the campaign
practice code," Mefford said. "If anyone did break
the rules, they could never have been applied with
out being unconstitutional. We need to address the
often-difficult question of how you go about regu
lating campaigns without infringing on free-speech
rights."
The ASSU recently appointed a new elections
commissioner, sophomore Troy Steinmetz, who will
chair an elections reform committee.
"The committee is going to look at aspects of
elections brought up in the case and other things
such as campaign financing and advertising," Lin
said. "My position at this point is to wait for the
Council's decision. I'll give them whatever informa-
tion they need and really go with it
from there in terms of reforms and
implementation of the next elec
tion."
The Council ruled on two earlier
suits related to the election last
spring — one filed by Mefford and
another by Lee — but a decision on
the most recent case was stalled
when three Council members re
signed, leaving the Council without
the necessary quorum to reach deci
sions until the appointment of new
members.
"We expect the hearing to be or

derly and smooth sailing," said first
year Graduate School of Business
student Patrick Crosetto, the new
Council chair. "We're all going to
have an open mind."
Crosetto also noted that interest
ed parties can file amicus curae
("friend of the court") briefs, due
Sunday.
"We'd like to hear from anyone
who feels like they have an opinion
based on constitutionality and based
on the ASSU Constitution," he said.
According to Lin. the relatively
inexperienced makeup of the Coun-

Case is third brought by
losing Lee/Mefford slate

cil should not be a problem.
"1 think that the most important
thing for Council members is a de
sire to put in their time to study
these somewhat legalistic argu
ments and really be fair and objec
tive," he said. "1 have confidence
that the Council members are deter
mined to be as fair as possible."
The Council will meet at 5:30 p.m.
in Room 290 of the Law School to
discuss procedural issues. The dis
cussion of Mefford's suit will begin
at 6 p.m. and the hearing is open to

such as campaign financing and advertising," Lin
said. "My position at this point is to wait for the
Council's decision. I'll give them whatever informa-
tion they need and really go with it
from there in terms of reforms and
implementation of the next elec
tion."
The Council ruled on two earlier
suits related to the election last
spring — one filed by Mefford and
another by Lee — but a decision on
the most recent case was stalled
when three Council members re
signed, leaving the Council without
the necessary quorum to reach deci
sions until the appointment of new
members.
"We expect the hearing to be or

derly and smooth sailing," said first
year Graduate School of Business
student Patrick Crosetto, the new
Council chair. "We're all going to
have an open mind."
Crosetto also noted that interest
ed parties can file amicus curae
("friend of the court") briefs, due
Sunday.
"We'd like to hear from anyone
who feels like they have an opinion
based on constitutionality and based
on the ASSU Constitution," he said.
According to Lin. the relatively
inexperienced makeup of the Coun-

Case is third brought by
losing Lee/Mefford slate

cil should not be a problem.
"1 think that the most important
thing for Council members is a de
sire to put in their time to study
these somewhat legalistic argu
ments and really be fair and objec
tive," he said. "1 have confidence
that the Council members are deter
mined to be as fair as possible."
The Council will meet at 5:30 p.m.
in Room 290 of the Law School to
discuss procedural issues. The dis
cussion of Mefford's suit will begin
at 6 p.m. and the hearing is open to
all students.
