# New Council to hear Mefford election appeal
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Constitutional Council, which recent
ly filled four of its five seats with new members, will
hold a hearing Monday regarding a case brought by
senior Dylan Mefford last May.
The suit challenges the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate's decision not to certify the results of the
spring ASSU executive election, which was won by
vice-presidential candidate Mefford and his running
mate, fifth-year student and then-presidential can
didate Mikey Lee.
The controversy centered on a campaign e-mail
that Lee, at the time a senior class president, sent to
the Class of 2004 mailing list. The Senate argued
that Lee's e-mail was an abuse of power and ruled to
hold a special election, of which the winners were
current president Chioke Borgelt-Mose and vice
president Kory Vargas Caro, both juniors.
Mefford described his suit as an argument based
on free-speech rights.
"Endorsements and e-mail are forms of free
speech recognized by the University," he said. "The
ASSU Constitution has the same protections of free
speech as U.S. Constitution."
Mefford emphasized that his continued involve

current leadership of the ASSU.
"The basic point of the case is just to raise aware
ness of the need for reform of the ASSU election
and certification processes and of the campaign
practice code," Mefford said. "If anyone did break
the rules, they could never have been applied with
out being unconstitutional. We need to address the
often-difficult question of how you go about regu

rights."
The ASSU recently appointed a new elections
commissioner, sophomore Troy Steinmetz, who will
chair an elections reform committee.
"The committee is going to look at aspects of
elections brought up in the case and other things
such as campaign financing and advertising," Lin
said. "My position at this point is to wait for the
Council's decision. I'll give them whatever informa-
