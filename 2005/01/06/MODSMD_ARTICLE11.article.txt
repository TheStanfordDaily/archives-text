On Jan. 6,1978, The Daily ran a story
about the University s changing rela
tionship with the federal government.
Below is an excerpt:
'"The days of wine and roses are
over concerning the relationship be
tween higher education and govern
ment,' said Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for public affairs, at yester
day afternoon's Faculty Senate
meeting.
"There has been a dramatic
change in the issues since the 1950s
and 19605, according to Rosenzweig.
Increasingly, universities are no
longer primary beneficiaries of gov
ernment legislation, but one of many
disaffected parties.
• "Higher education has lost its
preferred position with the govern
ment, said Rosenzweig.
"During 1977 the University has
had to compromise with the govern
ment on several items of legislation,
including whether the Department
of Energy should have a highly
placed office of research and
whether the Medical School should
be required to admit foreign stu
dents.
"Further, mandatory retirement
legislation and a restructuring of so
cial security taxes have strongly af
fected the University.
"Issues that the University is ex
pected to tangle with the upcoming
year include DNA research regula
tion, biomedical research, indirect
cost "fates, creation of a Department
of Education in the cabinet, privacy
legislation and tax reform, Rosen
zweig said.
"The University must closely
watch all legislation, because Stan
ford interests are often at stake, ac
cording to Rosenzweig. 'If you're

not at the table when a deal is made,
you're very likely to find yourself
under the table after the deal is
made,' said Rosenzweig."
On Jan. 6,1998, The Daily ran a story
about a break-in at Bob, one of the
most popular Row Houses, during
winter break. Below is an excerpt:
"Students returning to their
rooms in Bob have an unpleasant
task to add to the usual beginning of
the quarter errands — doing inven
tories of their belongings and filing
police reports on items that are now
missing.
"Over the break, intruders broke
in to the house, kicked in the doors
of 15 rooms and looted them. Resi
dents are still unsure of how much
was taken by the thieves, who most
ly passed over large possessions in
favor of small, expensive electronic
items.
"According to a letter from Facil
ities Supervisor Sharon Bruce, the
crime was discovered shortly after
midnight on Dec. 29, after which po
lice and housing staff inspected the
house and filed a report. Room
doors were replaced before students
returned to school.
Three laptop computers, a com
puter scanner, calculators, cameras
and a violin were among the stolen
items. Bob residents estimated that
16 to 20 students, most of whom
lived on the third floor, had belong
ings taken.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said a lock on one of the
outer doors had been dismantled in a
way that would have required spe
cial tools and that 'we are possibly
talking about someone who has
some locksmith knowledge.'"
