There was the Thanksgiving turkey. A
piece of that pumpkin pie. Mug after mug
of hot cocoa just smelled too good to ig
nore. Not to mention those holiday
brownies, chocolates, cookies and pie.

You made a New Year's resolution, re
member? You promised to lose weight.
And not for your ex, not to please your
mom or fit into that old prom dress, you
promised yourself.
Let's face it. It's time to beat that fresh
man 15. It's time to get rid of the sweats
and shimmy into something a little more
flattering. After all. that's the only way you
can have an extra-large slice of that pecan
pie at your Aunt Betty's next year totally
guilt free, right?
But as with every well-intentioned
resolution, its hard to surrender vices in
the face of 20 units of biochem. It's im
possible make time for the Tresidder
treadmills when you have problem sets
galore. So here it is, your quintessential
guide to losing those holiday pounds
without even trying, or at least feeling
like you're trying. What more could you
want? Let's get to it — Stanford style.
1.) Take a break from your bike. Bik
ing may be the quickest, most efficient
way to get to class after tumbling out of
bed with just 10 minutes to get dressed,
but a two-minute bike ride won't work
those abs. According to fitness experts, a
10-minute walk can help burn approxi
mately 50 calories. And hey, if you think
about it, running late might only force you
to power walk.
1 2.) Sign up for an athletic or dance
class. These one-unit courses are im
mensely popular among Stanford stu

dents, so it shouldn't be too hard to co
erce a friend into joining you. Take kick
boxing and let out that pent-up frustra
tion. To think, you can tone your glutes
and imagine pummeling that cute hookup
who never called you back. Try social
dance and learn to waltz. Take a stab at
weight training. According to freshman
Kendall Olsen, "I took weight training
last quarter and I'm still doing it. I've
seen results."
3.) Join your dorm's intramural sports
team. Not only might you meet people
you've never even seen before, but you can
choose from a plethora of activities — bas
ketball, volleyball, even dodgeball. These
sports are a fun way to get fit, and there's
nothing like bitter rivalry to strengthen
bonds with dorm mates.
4.) Visit the Arrillaga Family Sports
Center. Equipped with an extensive weight
training area, leg machines, stationary
bikes and elliptical machines, Arrillaga is
the place to visit for those who are ready to
commit to a fitness program. Plus, where
else will you see your attractive peers flex
ing outside of a drunken frat party?
5.) Burn some of that Christmas
money. Take the Marguerite to Stanford
Shopping Center and walk around the
shops. Spend a few hours on Saturday or
Sunday scoping out the scene, buying
yourself some goodies and getting some
fun-filled exercise. If you're really ambi
tious, bike there. You'll hardly realize
the distance you walk, and there's noth
ing to reward an exercise session like a
spree at Banana Republic.
If these suggestions really don't help
you, see a nutritionist at Vaden Student
Health Clinic. They are always happy to
talk to students about maintaining healthy
habits and will help you to find the best
regimen for you schedule.
