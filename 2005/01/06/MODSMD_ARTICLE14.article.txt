Feeling stressed already? Feel like
you'll never be able to relax again? Slug
gish? Pressing that snooze button one too
many times?
Yoga or pilates might just be answer
you've been looking for. Both yoga and
pilates have become popular trends over
the past decade because of their natural
mind-body approach to exercise.
Since both forms of exercise utilize
your mind, you are engaged throughout
the entire routine. Those who have given
both a try have discovered that the exer
cises help them steer clear of boredom, in
crease focus and effectively strengthen
their muscles.
But what's the difference? Are pilates
and yoga interchangeable? Walking
down the video aisles in a variety of
stores, you'll see a multitude of work-out
videos devoted to yoga and pilates, com
bining both disciplines into one work-out
routine.
Yoga is an Eastern-based approach to
exercise and conditioning, focusing on
overall health. From its Hindu philosoph
ical origins, yoga involves body, mind and
spirit, and encourages humans to seek
balance in the way we live our lives.
The differences between pilates and
yoga surpass physical movement. They
have different birth places, philosophies,
and of course objectives.
From the physical perspective, it em
phasizes the strengthening of all muscle
groups in order to ensure both physical
and psychological balance. A yoga rou
tine involves stationary positions while
working with breathing, emotions and
flexibility. Only blocks, bands and blan
kets are used during yoga exercises.
Though it appears to have evolved into a
new fad, yoga was developed thousands
of years ago in India.
Pilates, in contrast, was created in the
1920s by Joseph Pilates, who developed
the discipline to help World War I sol
diers recover from injuries. In the 19905,

pilates appealed to dancers because the
exercises helped them maintain lean and
long muscles.
Pilates is a Western-based approach
that concentrates specifically on building
the strength of the body's core muscle
group, which includes the hips, back and
abdominal area.
During a pilates routine, toning mus
cles is emphasized over improving flexibil
ity. In pilates, motion is significant in
strengthening the core muscles, and a nor
mal routine may involve a series of exer
cises using machines.
Junior Sarah Carroll has attempted
both yoga and pilates.
"I took yoga in my hometown, and 1 felt
it was more relaxing and peaceful than pi
lates," she said.
During the academic quarter and
around final examination week especially,
yoga may be useful for reducing stress.
However, Carroll said she also enjoyed
taking the pilates class at Stanford be
cause of its more rigorous strength-build
ing exercises.
"The pilates class involved a lot of
strengthening and lengthening work on
my abs, and some flexibility motions,"
she said.
Freshman Karen Nga took the pilates
class at Stanford last autumn quarter
and discovered the versatility of objects
used for pilates.

"In the class, I learned that you have to
do pilates frequently and consistently,"
Nga said. "I learned that 1 could buy sim
ple, inexpensive things that could be used
for pilates, such as a foam cylinder used to
stretch out hamstrings and work on back
problems."
Experienced in yoga, freshman Sommer
Panage said, "I began yoga classes for flex
ibility and to mainly help me in my breath
ing techniques because I had a problem
breathing during hardcore exercising. Now
I really love yoga."
In contrast, freshman Nana Wilberforce
chose to take pilates classes to fit her spe
cific needs.
"I like pilates better than yoga because
it builds and strengthens my abs," she said.
Though these students have discovered
the differences between the two disci
plines, there are a few similarities between
yoga and pilates that warrant their joint
usage in work-out videos. Both increase
flexibility, for example. Yoga and pilates
both focus on mind and body concentration
and enhance posture. They are also consid
ered "low-impact" types of exercise, unlike
running or cycling.
Whichever fitness approach you choose,
yoga and pilates are both engaging meth
ods of keeping your bodies healthy. Pick
up a copy of a yoga and pilates video with
friends and start working on your New
Year's resolution to stay fit.
