## Don't let birth control myths fool you — Get the facts on the pill 
### LAUREN GONG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
With so many birth control
myths floating around campus and
such a wide variety of brands to
choose from — not to mention all
the side effects to sift through —
it's no wonder that the average
Stanford woman makes a blind de
cision based on the advice of the
advice of one doctor.
I was recently at Vaden Health
Center when I mentioned to my
doctor that a significant number of
my sexually active friends from
back home are not taking birth
control and instead relying on the
withdrawal method. It surprised
her that they were using such an in
effective method of birth control

when oral contraceptives are so
readily accessible at student health
centers and local organizations
like Planned Parenthood just a
short drive away.
So it got me thinking: Why are
girls so hesitant to take birth con
trol, especially today when the pill
is being prescribed fora variety of
ailments including acne, irregular
menstrual cycle and unnatural hair
growth? You'd think, if anything,
more young girls would be taking
it. There is the common rumor
that the pill causes weight gain,
which has been it's greatest stig
ma, but I just assumed that was
offset by the ability of estrogen to
up one's bra size.
To clear up some of the confu
sion. I decided to go over the pam

phlet supplied by Vaden to first
time birth control users with my
doctor, and she was able to dispel
some of the more common myths
that leave many confused.
Extreme weight gain: This is a
MYTH. Increased estrogen levels
could produce fluctuation within a
couple pounds but any more
weight gain is attributed to a
change in lifestyle.
Increased appetite: This is a
MYTH. Increased hormone levels
should not cause an increase in ap
petite especially with the new low
dosage birth control pills.
Mood changes: This is TRUE.
Birth control pills can cause slight
mood changes and have been known
to bring about depression in people
with a history of mental instability.

Carcinogenic: This is a MYTH.
Birth control pills are not known to
cause cancer, according to current
medical literature.
The doctor at Vaden was a big
advocate for the pill. She insisted
that while there are some minor
risks, including breast tenderness,
slight nausea and mood changes,
the benefits of being on the pill, es
pecially if one is sexually active, far
outweigh the risks of using a more
unreliable method.
So how do you tell the differ
ence between the many types on
the market?
A couple common differences
are monophasic versus triphasic,
high-dose versus low-dose, and di
uretic versus nondiuretic.
Monophasic means that there is

a single dose of estrogen given in
each pill for every phase of your
cycle. Triphasic means there are
three different dosages of estrogen
— three types of pills — that you
take during your cycle.
When you see "Lo" in front of
the brand name it means there is a
lower dosage of estrogen. Current
ly even regular-level birth control
pills have significantly lower
dosages of estrogen and proges
terone than when oral contracep
tives were first introduced. The
lower the dosage, the fewer side ef
fects one is likely to experience.
Lastly, some pills contain a di
uretic which has the added benefit
of clearing up skin and reducing
unsightly hair growth but also puts
one at risk of dehydration. Accord

ing to Vaden physicians, however,
the low levels of diuretic in some
birth control pills have an insignif
icant effect on patients.
Each type of oral contracep
tive has slightly different benefits
and side effects depending on
how the varying chemical makeup
interacts with an individual pa
tient's body. Some have com
pletely different chemical compo
sitions, which makes it extremely
important that anyone consider
ing using the pill to prevent preg
nancy talk to her physician about
which pill is just right.
