(U-WIRII) CORVALLIS, Ore. —
Monroe Avenue's Tarn Tip restau
rant, usually a popular lunch spot
with the Oregon State University
crowd, was abnormally busy Tues
day. The family-run Thai restaurant
held a special fundraising lunch from
11 a.m. to 4 p.m. to aid tsunami relief
efforts in Thailand, and the local
community came out in droves to
offer its support.
Shortly after I p.m., the line of
customers waiting patiently for one
of the Tarn lip's 16 tables that filled
the restaurant's small reception area
and spilled onto the sidewalk and
into the crisp winter air.
Christina Woo. a graduate student in
business, heard about the fund-rais
er from a Thai student in the MBA
program.
"I thought it was a good cause,"
she said. "No one in the world in a
long time has seen such a huge n
atural disaster. Everyone should do
what they can."
Woo mentioned that the MBA As
sociation is collecting donations for
disaster relief, which will be sent to
several different countries.
April Fisher and Linda Bricker
came to the restaurant together from
the Department of Foreign Lan
guages.
"We came specifically to support
the relief effort — and have lunch."
said Bricker, the department's office
manager.
"I want to support Tarn Tip for
doing this, and I love Thai food,"
Fisher said. "But I would have done
it at any rate."
Fisher, a Spanish professor, is re
quiring her students to do a public
service project this term, and en
couraging them to do something re
lated to the tsunami disaster.
"It will take the entire world to
respond to this," Fisher said. "With
any luck, it will open people's eyes to
the need to look out for one anoth
er."

Alter hearing the place was
packed, Josanna Clark hurried over
to Tarn Tip to save a spot in line for
a group of friends meeting her from
off campus. After 20 minutes, the
bioengineering/biochemistry and
biophysics major was still waiting pa
tiently for both a table and her
friends.
"It's a tragedy with something
like that — it only happens every 200
years," Clark said of the tsunami.
"Two hundred years is a long
time for humanity to remember
something."
Inside the restaurant, hostesses,
servers, cooks and dishwashers — all
volunteers — bustled about fo ac
commodate the onslaught of cus
tomers.
The scene was much calmer at
4:30 p.m., as six last tables of diners
lingered over their meals and staff
members had a few moments to
catch their breath and tally up the
day's proceeds.
"It is very overwhelming today,
very successful today," said Tarn Tip
Manager Nok Srisomburana. "We
are very tired but very happy."
She estimated the restaurant had
five to six times more business than
on a normal day, but all of the food
on the menu was still prepared fresh
to order.
Twenty volunteers manned the
restaurant for the event, including
members of Srisomburana's family,
who own and operate Tarn Tip. and
members of the local Thai communi
ty and OSI J's Thai Student Associa
tion. Many of the volunteers ran
back and forth to attend classes on
campus.
Thai Student Association Presi
dent Chalermpol Plengsaard
worked in the kitchen, helping with
the dishes.
"I'm very glad it [went] very
well," he said.
TSA members organized the
fundraiser over the past week and
publicized the event with fliers all
over campus and announcements on
e-mail listservs.
The only minor mishap involved

the day's special grilled barbecue
chicken.
"One time we cooked too much
food and the ventilator stopped
working, and there was smoke com
ing out," said TSA member
Pornrat Wattanakasiwich, who
spent the day working in the kitchen.
The engineering graduate stu
dent noticed the smoke smell from
the barbecue chicken even out in the
restaurant, but no one panicked, and
the smoke alarms were not trig
gered, she said.
At the end of the fundraiser, all of
the restaurant's lunch proceeds, in
cluding tips, and the extra donations
collected in a special box tallied to
$4,819.75.
The full amount will go to Thai
land's relief fund and the King of
Thailand's foundation. Patreeda
Pattaradon, a recent OSU graduate
in civil engineering, will carry the
funds with her when she returns to
Thailand next week.
The event organizers plan to
make a big sign to hang on Tarn
Tip's door to thank the community
for its support and display the
amount of money raised.
"We want to thank all the people
who come to join us today," Srisom
burana said.
Tarn Tip plans to leave the dona
tion box out to continue to raise
money for other relief organizations,
and the TSA plans to hold more
fundraisers, as well.
"There also may be some activity
to donate to the Red Cross, a bake
sale or something on campus," Wat
tanakasiwich said.
"I think all together we can do
things and give (the tsunami victims)
our support." Srisomburana said.
"Everyone in the community can
help."
After an exhausting but elating
day. Tarn Tip was still open for nor
mal dinner hours, and the staff set
about preparing.
"1 hope we have enough food."
Srisomburana said.

Happy birthday Anthony Ha, you sexy beast.
