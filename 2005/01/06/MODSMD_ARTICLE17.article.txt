Swihart receives $1,500 a semester
from the federal government. As a
theater major who has constant re
hearsals, she doesn't have time fora
job and relies on that money to help
pay for groceries, rent and "just liv
ing."
More than 15 percent of UF stu
dents receive Pell grants and are in
the same situation as Swihart. All
are in jeopardy of losing some of
that money next Fall because of
changes to be made in the federal
aid program.
"It's not the tuition that's going
to be a problem. It's the living," said
Swihart, who also is a Florida Bright
Futures Scholarship recipient. "It's
already really hard to do this."
Federal Pell grants will be scaled
back due to an update of a formula
used in the Free Application for
Federal Student Aid.
About 8,000 UF students, and
more than 5 million students nation
wide, depend on the award for col
lege expenses.
The New York Times reported
on Dec. 23 that about 1.3 million stu

dents nationwide could receive less
money, and about 90,000 could lose
the grant altogether, according to
two analyses of the change.
State and institutional aid also
may be in danger, as some students
could look too rich under the
changes.
"Certainly students that are bor
derline on Pell grant, if they go from
eligible to ineligible, could be nega
tively impacted." said Karen Fooks,
UF's director of financial aid ser
vices.
Some of these recipients might
have to live with less Pell grant
money, she said, but she hopes most
will fill in the gaps with other grants
and loans.
However, Fooks stressed the im
pact on each individual is hard to de
termine, as every student's award is
reassessed each year.
In fact, most students probably
won't notice the difference, she said.
"The reality is a student's eligibil
ity goes up and down every year
based on the family's ability to pay,"
Fooks said.
Full-time students receive $400
to $4,050 annually based on an esti
mation of how much money their
families can afford to invest in col
lege. After Congress passed a
spending bill that did not renew the
formula used for that estimation, the

U.S. Education Department an
nounced Dec. 23 it will change the
calculation.
The current formula is based on
1988 tax data. When updated, it will
use 2002 information.
The change is expected to save
the government $300 million during
the 2005-06 academic year, accord
ing to The New York Times.
Supporters of the change argue
the saved money will help pay off
the Pell grant's $4 billion deficit and
eventually will give more money to
poor students who need more than
$4,050 to pay for their education.
However. Swihart said she thinks
the cut will not help current stu
dents.
"I understand their perspective
outside the realm of being in col
lege," Swihart said. "But for stu
dents who come from lower income
levels, trying to put themselves
through college is difficult."
The update is overdue, Fooks
said, but compounding the years of
error at once will be a much bigger
hit to students' wallets than it would
have been if the changes had been
made every year.
"The problem is the government
has never put enough money in
need-based financial aid," she said.

eligible to ineligible, could be nega
tively impacted." said Karen Fooks,
UF's director of financial aid ser
vices.
Some of these recipients might
have to live with less Pell grant
money, she said, but she hopes most
will fill in the gaps with other grants
and loans.
However, Fooks stressed the im
pact on each individual is hard to de
termine, as every student's award is
reassessed each year.
In fact, most students probably
won't notice the difference, she said.
"The reality is a student's eligibil
ity goes up and down every year
based on the family's ability to pay,"
Fooks said.
Full-time students receive $400
to $4,050 annually based on an esti
mation of how much money their
families can afford to invest in col
lege. After Congress passed a
spending bill that did not renew the
formula used for that estimation, the

U.S. Education Department an
nounced Dec. 23 it will change the
calculation.
The current formula is based on
1988 tax data. When updated, it will
use 2002 information.
The change is expected to save
the government $300 million during
the 2005-06 academic year, accord
ing to The New York Times.
Supporters of the change argue
the saved money will help pay off
the Pell grant's $4 billion deficit and
eventually will give more money to
poor students who need more than
$4,050 to pay for their education.
However. Swihart said she thinks
the cut will not help current stu
dents.
"I understand their perspective
outside the realm of being in col
lege," Swihart said. "But for stu
dents who come from lower income
levels, trying to put themselves
through college is difficult."
The update is overdue, Fooks
said, but compounding the years of
error at once will be a much bigger
hit to students' wallets than it would
have been if the changes had been
made every year.
"The problem is the government
has never put enough money in
need-based financial aid," she said.
