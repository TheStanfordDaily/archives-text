## Editorial Improved Moscow program reopens 
### 
Stanford's overseas program in Moscow will re
open for autumn quarter next school year for
a limited number of students after a year-long
closure. The program was closed due to cost
concerns last year, when the OSP said itt needed to
evaluate and restructure the program's inefficient
cost structure.
We commend the OSP for taking time to reevalu
ate and adjust the financial model for the Stanford in
Moscow program. The program has now successfully
eliminated the high overhead debts of the old pro
gram and will open a new location with lower costs
and a limited capacity.
By reoffering the program in Russia, the Overseas
Studies Program lives up to its mission statement: to
offer students the opportunity to experience different
cultures. Although Stanford currently has programs
in areas such as England, Italy, Germany and France,
Western Europe is not nearly as distinctive from the
United States as Russia.
Russia, especially when it was a part of the
U.S.S R., has helped shape the modern political and
economic history of the world. In fact, the world is still

dealing with the aftermath of the U.S.S.R.'s breakup,
and a quarter in Moscow can offer a unique perspec

Ukraine and other Eastern European countries.
In addition to the country's political importance in
the global scheme, Russia has a great deal to offer cul
turally since it is home of some of the world's greatest
writers and artists.
Part of the reason the program was cancelled in the
past was due to the costs of high supply of available
spot met by low demand from students. However, the
OSP is also playing it safe with the Moscow program
by lowering the number of students accepted into the
program when it reopens, but with the flexibility to in
crease the number of spots in the future if student de
mand merits it.
Although it is unfortunate the program had to
close in the first place, the OSP has taken the lost time
to revamp Stanford in Moscow into a leaner, more ef
ficient program. This is a benefit to the OSP. but it is
an even greater benefit for students, who now again
have the alluring option of Moscow when making the
decision to go abroad.
