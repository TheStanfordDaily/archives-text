# Drafter expresses optimism about Iraqi constitution
## 
### JOE SEXTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Feisal Istrabadi. a chief architect oflraq's interim con
stitution. was optimistic about the groundwork the docu
ment will lay in a speech in Encina Hall last night, but
recognized that Iraq is still far from being a viable
democracy.
Istrabadi, Iraq's deputy permanent representative to
the United Nations, was invited to speak by the Stanford
Institute for International Studies. His remarks drew
heavily on Iraq's history, and he emphasized that a criti
cal understanding of that country's troubled past is nec
essary when discussing Iraq's future.
Istrabadi said it is unfair to assume that Iraq cannot be
unified because of its diverse and disparate background.
"You have a history of Iraq as one nation," he said.
"Even if Iraq had been an artificial construct, which I
don't believe it was, since 1925 we have had 80 years to
work with it."
He also stressed that while the Iraqi population is re
ligiously and ethnically diverse, citizens of all back
grounds have increasingly intermingled over the years.
"We have a highly intermarried population between
Kurds and Arabs, Persians and Turkomans. Shiites and
Sunnis," he said.
Although religious and ethnic groups such as Shiites
and Kurds have been persecuted in the country. Istraba-

di said that it was the ruling regime
that created those divisions.
"Always when these events oc
curred, it was the central govern
ment in Baghdad asserting its au
thority over areas that they saw as
being a threat to security," he said.
"Iraq has no history of ethnic vio
lence."
Istrabadi added that ensuring
that equitable treatment of all eth
nic groups, especially the Kurds, was
of paramount importance to the
drafters of the constitution.
"We wanted to make it clear that
the Kurdish experience in Iraq
would not be unique," he said. "We
were setting the foundation to en
sure that Iraq did not dissolve into
two federated states."
Istrabadi added, however, that
the role of religion in Iraq's future
was a contentious issue during the
drafting of the constitution.
"Fairly early, we came to an
agreement with the Islamic party,
saying that Islam would be the offi
cial religion of the state,"he said,
adding that he hoped "the interim
document would respect the Islamic
identity of the majority of the peo
ple of Iraq."
Controversy arose when conser
vative Islamic leaders objected to
the idea that Iraq's laws would not
draw exclusively from Islam, forcing
both sides to compromise.
"What we agreed was that no one
could pass legislation contrary to the
universally accepted tenets of Islam,
nor the principles of democracy, nor
the Bill of Rights secured in Chapter

Two (of the constitution]."
The final agreement, he said, was
a victory for moderates, who have
gained leeway in passing future leg
islation because there are few "uni
versally accepted" tenets of Islam.
And while Istrabadi said he was
pleased with both the interim consti
tution and the Bill of Rights, he re
mained realistic about the magni
tude of the task ahead for the inter
im Iraqi government.
"I don't think words on a page
are going to do it,"he said. "Either
the rights take hold now or this will
be a building block to getting us
there."
He said some of the measures
taken thus far by the interim gov
ernment and coalition forces have
curbed his optimism. He took ex
ception specifically to the decision
to dissolve the conscript army and
the police force after the fall of' Sa
ddam. arguing that this measure has
severely undermined the security of
the region.
Istrabadi said that he has been
disappointed by some of his Ameri
can colleagues who fail to put Iraq's
problems in proper perspective.
"An American general ex
plained to me once that Iraq would
need a 40,000-man standing army,"
he said. "I asked how he arrived at
that answer, and he said that since
Iraq is one tenth the size of the U.S.,
Iraq should have one tenth the size
of [the U.S.'s| army. I said 'General,
our neighbors are not Canada and
Mexico."'
Many audience members appre-

Istrabadi: Constitution is
groundwork for democracy

ciated Istrabadi's candor and
thoughtfulness.
"As an Iraqi-American, I know
he is a very credible man," said
sophomore Omar Shakir. "He is
proud that a process is in place for
Iraq to become democratic. He is
optimistic but still realistic. He is the
kind of person that I would like to
see lead the country."
Shakir was surprised, however,
that Istrabadi did not mention
specifically — nor was he asked
about — international criticisms of
the handling of the Iraq War.
Hoover Senior Fellow Larry Dia
mond, who recently returned from
Iraq, where he served as an advisor
to the coalition, hosted the event.
He explained that Istrabadi's new
role as an official representative of
the Iraqi government forced him to
be cautious with his choice of words.
"He has to be circumspect in
what he says now," he said. "I know
that he was part of a large group of
Iraqis that favored an invasion to
topple Saddam. I know that many
Iraqis who favored the invasion are
appalled as to how Americans mis
managed the occupation."
Despite declining global opinion
of the Iraq War and the American
occupation, Istrabadi remains fo
cused on his task. The ratification of
the interim constitution was a victo
ry for him, but said he still takes a
practical view of the drafters' ac
complishment.
"it's a constitution and not a
guarantee that things will work out."
