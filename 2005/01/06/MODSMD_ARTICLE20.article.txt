## Congress should investigate elections 
### KAI STINCHCOMBE 
I think Bush won Ohio in this
year's 2(X)4 election. I would even
say I'm pretty sure. But given our
country's current electoral system,
it's impossible for anyone to say
he's positive.
First, there are allegations of
plain old voter fraud. Precincts in
swing states across the country
counted more votes than registered
voters; voters described getting pre
punched ballots or seeing machines
where the "default" choice was
Bush.
In the most egregious potential
fraud example in Ohio, Warren
County officials cited an unnamed
"security threat" and closed the
doors on the press for several
hours. It's impossible to guess what
went on in the vote-count head
quarters, but studies have suggest
ed that Warren County awarded
around 40.000 more votes to Bush
than should have been statistically
expected.
Many potential-fraud problems
revolve around new technologies.
Electronic voting machines and tab
ulating computers for optical-scan
votes are vulnerable to hacking, and
counts from these machines could
be inaccurate. Finally, the hard exit
poll data have not yet been re
leased. but statistical analyses based
on what was released have suggest
ed likelihoods of less than one in a
million of the divergence we saw in
this election.
Some of the stuff in the blogs and
press is clearly based on statistical
errors, but other stuff is credible.
When official counts differed from
exit polls in Ukraine, State Depart
ment officials declared the election
fraudulent, but in the United States,
the administration says we should
ignore the exit polls.
Second, verification was improp
erly done. Recounts of paper bal
lots in Ohio were delayed until after
the results were officially certified,
rather than getting an early start.
When the law required manual re
counts in randomly selected
precincts, the vast majority of coun
ties did not select the recounted
precincts randomly. This suggests

that either they were picking
precincts where they knew there
were no errors to get through the
process easily, or that they avoided
recounting votes thai they may have
known were fraudulent.
In Fairfield County, recount re
sults that didn't match initial tallies
were "suspended" and begun again
from scratch. Press-access rules
were once again violated: In Sum
mit County, observers were allowed
to supervise recounting but from 20
feet away.
Third, a more subtle campaign
systematically depressed Demo
cratic turnout. Machines were
moved from Democratic to Repub
lican precincts, so sometimes voters
had access to fewer machines than
they had used to vote in the pri
maries. In my old heavily Demo
cratic precinct at Colorado College
in Colorado Springs, lines lasted up
to 10 hours, while lines in the rest of
the heavily Republican El Paso
County were under a half-hour.
This seems to have been the case at
colleges and universities across the
country.
Meanwhile, voters were encour
aged to use provisional ballots that
were not counted rather than find
the right place to cast their votes,
and different technologies and
breakdown rates in different areas
meant that poor and black votes
were less likely to count than those
cast by affluent whites. In the the
Bush v. Gore case in 2000. the
Supreme Court required states to
count all votes in the same way, a
sensible recommendation that has
yet to be implemented.
All this is just in Ohio.
Our Constitution is based on the
principle that only a distrusted gov
ernment is trustworthy. Concen
trated power must be checked by
counterpoised authorities, the press
and the citizens. While there is no
hard evidence of conspiracy or
fraud in this year's election, there is
also no evidence of no conspiracy or
fraud existing.
The election process could have
been designed to produce that sort
of evidence, but it wasn't. Open
source voting machines are more
transparent, and voter-verifiable

paper trails, like ATM receipts,
would mean electronic hackers
couldn't steal an election.
Press-access laws, such as those
violated in Ohio, are likewise in
place to ensure that officials are ac
countable to the public.
Finally, independent investiga
tions after elections by apolitical au
thorities would deter cheating and
inspire public confidence in the re
sults. More broadly, steps such as
vote-by-mail, same-day voter regis
tration and generous laws about
people who vote in the wrong
precinct would all demonstrate offi
cials' commitment to make every
vote count, regardless of whether it
favors their candidate or not.
Today, Congress will meet to ac
cept or challenge the electoral vote
results submitted by the states. It
would require the vote of one sena
tor in addition to the House repre
sentatives who have already
pledged to contest the results. It's
possible that our own Sen. Barbara
Boxer will lead the charge to open
an investigation.
As we all learned early in life, it's
not (just) about whether you win or
lose, but how you play the game. I
wanted Kerry to win, but the elec
tion isn't just about that. Elections
must ensure that everyone gets a
fair chance to express their opinion,
and that the public is confident in
the reported results.
There is almost zero chance, in
my estimation, that Bush's election
victory over Kerry was a result of
fraud. But that doesn't mean we
shouldn't investigate. It will inspire
public confidence if no fraud oc
curred; if fraud did occur, we should
punish those involved even if they
didn't ultimately affect the outcome
of the election.
An investigation would be a good
step toward future elections that
produce positive, verifiable evi
dence of the honesty of government
officials. That's the American way.
