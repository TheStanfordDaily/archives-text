# Brown and Out
## These bootstraps were made for pulling 
### 
I remember the first time I
heard the expression "Pull
yourself up by your boot
straps." I was a kid, and so I in
terpreted the expression literally
and actually spent a considerable
amount of time imagining how one
would go about pulling themselves
vertically using their shoes.
It didn't make any sense to me.
Fortunately, I eventually fig
ured out it wasn't a literal image,
but even now that 1 understand its
meaning, it doesn't make any sense
to me. It's a very convenient way of

blaming people
for not taking
"full advantage"
of the opportu
nities in this so
ciety, while si
multaneously
cleansing the
consciences of
everyone else.
A nation
built entirely by
"self-made"

women and men is a very romantic
national identity. However, it's
just not reality.
Unfortunately, there's always
someone, somewhere along the
way that gives these people a
break. And let's not forget that the
founders of this country were all
rich white guys.
If you have been reading this
column, then you know that I
would not be at Stanford if it were
not for the help I received from the
sacrifices of my grandparents and
parents.
If I had been born into a family
where I had to dedicate my time
after school to working instead of
to studying, what are the chances I
would be here? Not very likely.
But even if I had managed to
study and work and get here by
myself, whoever it was in the ad

mission office who decided to
admit me to Stanford University
also helped me. My point in all this
is I didn't get here alone.
Another objection I have to the
bootstraps and "self-made" idea is,
well, being able to have a boot in
the first place.
As you may or may not have no
ticed here at Stanford, some peo
ple have more opportunities just
because they were born into the
right family. Although it's conve
nient to believe that those with cer
tain advantages and privileges are
on the same playing field as others
not so fortunate, this is not a very
realistic conclusion.
Some people will have to work
harder at those boots than others.
Using me as an example, I may
have gotten this far, but finding a
good job after graduation has
proved to be a daunting task —
something I know you know is not
the case for many others who at
tend this institution. It's not that I
hate rich people, but perhaps if I
had been born into a family with
"connections" I would not have
this kind of trouble.
The point I am trying to make is
that while it may be a nice idea to
claim some can take care of them
selves while others lack that capac
ity, it's just not factual. Societies
don't work that way. A society is,
after all, the sum of social relation
ships among humans.
What would happen if we, as a
nation, accepted the fact that peo
ple can only achieve with the help
of others?
1 don't know the answer, but it's
worth thinking about.
