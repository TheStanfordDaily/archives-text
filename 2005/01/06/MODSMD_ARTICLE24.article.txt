It's up to students to make the
most of their time abroad
I was surprised to read Christo
pher Vaughan's editorial regarding
the Stanford Overseas Studies pro
grams. I participated in the Stan
ford-in-Oxford Program winter
quarter of my junior year and had a
fantastic experience.
I take issue with Vaughan's
terming of the OSP programs as
"unchallenging." My 6-unit tutorial
on African health care, undertaken
while studying abroad at Oxford,
was one of the most academically
challenging experiences of my time

at Stanford.
Furthermore, I would argue that
perhaps Vaughan would have bene
fited from taking a more proactive
approach to engaging with the
Chilean culture. It is not the respon
sibility of the "Stanford-in" pro
grams to hand-hold their students
and walk them through obtaining
cultural competency. Many stu
dents choose to study abroad to es
cape the so-called "Stanford bub
ble." Living in a new country gives
one this opportunity, but simply
getting on a plane does not provide
the pin-prick of escape.
Stanford OSP provides students

with unparalleled resources to ex
perience life and education in a for
eign country. However, it is the re
sponsibility of the students to make
local friends, immerse themselves in
a new culture and drag themselves
away from the "numerous comput
ers" and "free phone calls" of the
Stanford Centers. Many students
have successfully accomplished this,
myself included, and count their
time abroad as one of the most chal
lenging, rewarding and memorable
points of their Stanford career.
