## Men's volleyball confident in 2005 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With shaved heads, the men's volleyball
team burst onto the court for its first game of
the season Tuesday evening.
Some fans in the crowd surmised that the
guys were simply sporting the typical post
winter-break haircuts. In actuality, it was a
sign of the team's solidarity.
An initiation process?
"No, not at all," said senior middle block
er Craig Buell. "We just got some clippers
and shaved some heads. We spend a lot of
time together outside of volleyball, which
shows what good friends we are. That was
one of our strengths last year, and it's defi
nitely going to be one of our strengths this
year."
Head coach Don Shaw agreed.
"Our strengths right now are kind of in
tangible." Shaw said. "They're our work
ethic and our team chemistry. What we're
going to have to find out is where we're real
ly strong on the court."
Eleven of last season's 12 players have re
turned, making the 2005 Cardinal a cohesive
unit. Last season, however, Stanford strug
gled, finishing with an overall record of 9-18.
"We want to improve on last year," Shaw

said. "We just barely missed out on the play
offs, but we didn't have any experience
going at all, except for Kevin Hansen. Hope
fully with a year of experience, and some
new guys as well, we're going to improve on
last year and we're going to make the play
offs."
That experience, along with the evident
sense of team unity, seemed to propel the
team through the first two games of the
home opener on Tuesday against Cal Poly.
The Cardinal came out strong and never lost
the lead, more than doubling the Mustangs'
score to win both games.
However, the third game confirmed
Shaw's assessment that the team has "a lot of
room for improvement." After a lineup
change orchestrated to give junior setter
Jeremy Jacobs more game time, Stanford al
lowed Cal Poly to gain the lead more than
once before the Cardinal fought back to win
by five points to close out the match.
"Our consistency could be a little better,"
Buell said. "We kind of lost our focus a lit
tle."
