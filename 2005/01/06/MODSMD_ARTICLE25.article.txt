## Men's volleyball confident in 2005 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With shaved heads, the men's volleyball
team burst onto the court for its first game of
the season Tuesday evening.
Some fans in the crowd surmised that the
guys were simply sporting the typical post
winter-break haircuts. In actuality, it was a
sign of the team's solidarity.
An initiation process?
"No, not at all," said senior middle block
er Craig Buell. "We just got some clippers
and shaved some heads. We spend a lot of
time together outside of volleyball, which
shows what good friends we are. That was
one of our strengths last year, and it's defi
nitely going to be one of our strengths this
year."
Head coach Don Shaw agreed.
"Our strengths right now are kind of in
tangible." Shaw said. "They're our work
ethic and our team chemistry. What we're
going to have to find out is where we're real
ly strong on the court."
Eleven of last season's 12 players have re
turned, making the 2005 Cardinal a cohesive
unit. Last season, however, Stanford strug
gled, finishing with an overall record of 9-18.
"We want to improve on last year," Shaw

said. "We just barely missed out on the play
offs, but we didn't have any experience
going at all, except for Kevin Hansen. Hope
fully with a year of experience, and some
new guys as well, we're going to improve on
last year and we're going to make the play
offs."
That experience, along with the evident
sense of team unity, seemed to propel the
team through the first two games of the
home opener on Tuesday against Cal Poly.
The Cardinal came out strong and never lost
the lead, more than doubling the Mustangs'
score to win both games.
However, the third game confirmed
Shaw's assessment that the team has "a lot of
room for improvement." After a lineup
change orchestrated to give junior setter
Jeremy Jacobs more game time, Stanford al
lowed Cal Poly to gain the lead more than
once before the Cardinal fought back to win
by five points to close out the match.
"Our consistency could be a little better,"
Buell said. "We kind of lost our focus a lit
tle."

team will need to work on its consistency
this season, particularly since 22 of its
matches will be within the conference.
"This weekend we're going to play
three very, very tough MPSF matches in
Santa Barbara," Shaw said. "It's nice to
have a match under our belts before we
head down there."
The match against Cal Poly was a
non-conference contest, but it helped
the team ease into the season. With a
women's basketball game on campus at
the same time that evening, the crowd
at Burnham Pavilion was small, and
tickets were not even checked at the
doors.
"I feel that as a Stanford men's vol
leyball player, we don't get much recog
nition, which is good and bad at the same
time," Buell said. "There's no publicity
or fame to worry about... but it's tough
sometimes, because we do spend a lot of
time practicing."
Practices started in October, which
helped build the players' experience and
teamwork. But along with experience,
Shaw is hoping to add to the team's
strengths with the identification of a go

to guy. One such player is senior setter
Kevin Hansen, who was named an All-
American last season and is starting out
this season with 3,804 career assists, plac
ing him fourth overall in Stanford men's
volleyball history.
"Kevin is our key guy," Shaw said.
"Our three seniors, those are the guys
that we count on to secure a lot of the
plays, hut it's going to be a question of
who's going to step up and be another
guy. It could be Ben Reddy; it could be a
number of guys.
"We're just hoping that we continue
to improve, and then somewhere along
the line, some guy just explodes onto the
scene and really helps us go up to anoth
er level."
Junior Jeremy Jacobs, the backup
setter, is one player the team will be
looking to in the future. Jacobs, who
recorded 151 digs as the primary libero
last season, is "improving every day" ac
cording to Shaw.
One of the three seniors who anchor
the team is middle blocker Buell, who
posted a .625 hitting percentage in Tues
day's match. Supporting him in that po-

sition is junior Chris Ahlfeldt, who led
the team in games played last season.
Senior David Vogel, who led the
team last season with 289 kills, is expect
ed to he a strong presence again this sea
son at the outside hitter position. Back
ups at that position are juniors William
Clayton and Reddy, the latter of whom
recorded 215 kills last season.
Junior Nick Manov returns this sea
son to anchor the opposite hitter posi
tion. Freshman Matt Ceran is expected
to also see some playing time at this po
sition. In his Stanford career debut on
Tuesday, Ceran notched five kills in five
attempts.
The libero this season will be sopho
more Brian Lindberg, who split time at
the position last season. Freshmen Brian
Skinner and Jesse Meredith will be prac
ticing libero.
All the players are optimistic about
their potential for improvement this sea
son.
"We're good this year," Buell said.
"We're incredible. It'll be a lot of fun.
We'll be much better than we were last
year."

Santa Barbara," Shaw said. "It's nice to
have a match under our belts before we
head down there."
The match against Cal Poly was a
non-conference contest, but it helped
the team ease into the season. With a
women's basketball game on campus at
the same time that evening, the crowd
at Burnham Pavilion was small, and
tickets were not even checked at the
doors.
"I feel that as a Stanford men's vol
leyball player, we don't get much recog
nition, which is good and bad at the same
time," Buell said. "There's no publicity
or fame to worry about... but it's tough
sometimes, because we do spend a lot of
time practicing."
Practices started in October, which
helped build the players' experience and
teamwork. But along with experience,
Shaw is hoping to add to the team's
strengths with the identification of a go

to guy. One such player is senior setter
Kevin Hansen, who was named an All-
American last season and is starting out
this season with 3,804 career assists, plac
ing him fourth overall in Stanford men's
volleyball history.
"Kevin is our key guy," Shaw said.
"Our three seniors, those are the guys
that we count on to secure a lot of the
plays, hut it's going to be a question of
who's going to step up and be another
guy. It could be Ben Reddy; it could be a
number of guys.
"We're just hoping that we continue
to improve, and then somewhere along
the line, some guy just explodes onto the
scene and really helps us go up to anoth
er level."
Junior Jeremy Jacobs, the backup
setter, is one player the team will be
looking to in the future. Jacobs, who
recorded 151 digs as the primary libero
last season, is "improving every day" ac
cording to Shaw.
One of the three seniors who anchor
the team is middle blocker Buell, who
posted a .625 hitting percentage in Tues
day's match. Supporting him in that po-

sition is junior Chris Ahlfeldt, who led
the team in games played last season.
Senior David Vogel, who led the
team last season with 289 kills, is expect
ed to he a strong presence again this sea
son at the outside hitter position. Back
ups at that position are juniors William
Clayton and Reddy, the latter of whom
recorded 215 kills last season.
Junior Nick Manov returns this sea
son to anchor the opposite hitter posi
tion. Freshman Matt Ceran is expected
to also see some playing time at this po
sition. In his Stanford career debut on
Tuesday, Ceran notched five kills in five
attempts.
The libero this season will be sopho
more Brian Lindberg, who split time at
the position last season. Freshmen Brian
Skinner and Jesse Meredith will be prac
ticing libero.
All the players are optimistic about
their potential for improvement this sea
son.
"We're good this year," Buell said.
"We're incredible. It'll be a lot of fun.
We'll be much better than we were last
year."
With shaved heads, the men's volleyball
team burst onto the court for its first game of
the season Tuesday evening.
Some fans in the crowd surmised that the
guys were simply sporting the typical post
winter-break haircuts. In actuality, it was a
sign of the team's solidarity.
An initiation process?
"No, not at all," said senior middle block
er Craig Buell. "We just got some clippers
and shaved some heads. We spend a lot of
time together outside of volleyball, which
shows what good friends we are. That was
one of our strengths last year, and it's defi
nitely going to be one of our strengths this
year."
Head coach Don Shaw agreed.
"Our strengths right now are kind of in
tangible." Shaw said. "They're our work
ethic and our team chemistry. What we're
going to have to find out is where we're real
ly strong on the court."
Eleven of last season's 12 players have re
turned, making the 2005 Cardinal a cohesive
unit. Last season, however, Stanford strug
gled, finishing with an overall record of 9-18.
"We want to improve on last year," Shaw

said. "We just barely missed out on the play
offs, but we didn't have any experience
going at all, except for Kevin Hansen. Hope
fully with a year of experience, and some
new guys as well, we're going to improve on
last year and we're going to make the play
offs."
That experience, along with the evident
sense of team unity, seemed to propel the
team through the first two games of the
home opener on Tuesday against Cal Poly.
The Cardinal came out strong and never lost
the lead, more than doubling the Mustangs'
score to win both games.
However, the third game confirmed
Shaw's assessment that the team has "a lot of
room for improvement." After a lineup
change orchestrated to give junior setter
Jeremy Jacobs more game time, Stanford al
lowed Cal Poly to gain the lead more than
once before the Cardinal fought back to win
by five points to close out the match.
"Our consistency could be a little better,"
Buell said. "We kind of lost our focus a lit
tle."
