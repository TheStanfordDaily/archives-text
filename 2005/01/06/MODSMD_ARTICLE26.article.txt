# The 						Double Clutch
## USC makes OU, football pundits look plain silly 
### 
In a shameless show of excellence, on
Tuesday night the top-ranked USC Tro
jans made liars out of an entire nation's
sports media.
The Orange Bowl against No. 2 Oklahoma
was billed as the most balanced matchup in re
cent history. The most talent ever on the field
at one time. Two Heisman trophy winners and
two other finalists in the game.
Commentators and columnists were so ex
cited about this Monster Matchup that they
were afraid to make predictions.

Speculation ran that it
would be decided by a criti
cal turnover or fluky play.
People expected an instant
classic along the lines of
Miami-Ohio State (2003)
or Penn State-Alabama
(1979).
What no one expected
was what actually hap
pened — Southern Califor
nia jumping out to leads of
28-7, 38-10, and the final

margin, 55-19. (And to think Stanford came
within a couple of plays of beating this team!)
OU scored first, but went limp until scoring
a pitiful touchdown on USC's backups in the
waning minutes.
USC's Heisman quarterback Matt Leinart
threw for five touchdowns and seemingly
could do no wrong, shredding OU's secondary
from all directions. Trojan tailback LenDale
White was supposedly nursing a sore ankle. It
didn't show, as he ran for 121 yards on only 15
carries, including two second-effort touch
downs.
Reggie "President" Bush made a defender
whiff on the first play from scrimmage, and
from that point, he was in the Sooners' heads.
The dominating performance, which
locked up back-to-back USC national titles,
was unlike anything seen since No. 2 Florida's
52-20 Sugar Bowl shellacking of top-ranked
Florida State in 1997.
Moreover, in another chapter of an ongo
ing story, USC bailed out the Bowl Champi
onship Series.
The college football system designed to
produce a No. 1 versus No. 2 title game and an
undisputed champion has been dogged by
controversy since its inception in 1998.
Year after year, people griped that the
wrong team had wound up in the big game.
This year was no exception. Three teams
from top-flight conferences (USC, OU and
Auburn) ended up undefeated going into the
bowl season, along with two smaller-confer
ence teams.
There was even an alleged, if unfalsifiable,
vote-selling scandal, of which Rose Bowl
bound Texas was the beneficiary. In a related
story, for the third time in four seasons the
Rose Bowl was doomed to a game other than
its traditional Big Ten-Pac 10 matchup.
But this year, with remaining undefeateds
Utah and Auburn nipping at their heels, the
Trojans left absolutely no doubt as to who was
the best team in college football. In a sport
where you need to be great fora whole season
to win the championship, USC went one fur
ther — the Trojans were all but bulletproof.
I was actually going to write a column
about my opposition to a Division I-A playoff,
but it shouldn't take more than a couple of
sentences to describe the ludicrousness of
seeding an eight- or 16-team tournament
when by the end of November only two or at
most three teams can reasonably be consid


Christopher
Anderson
ered national champion material. Besides, the
myriad bowls afford mid-level teams the chance
to play a fun, competitive matchup and go home,
rather than the guaranteed butt-kicking they
would face at the hands of the high-seeded teams.
But even with the Pac-10's proudest moment on
display, Southern Cal still managed to stab a sister
institution in the back — in fact, visiting an almost
unspeakable offense upon our fair university.
In a shocking display of disrespect, the Trojan
band indulged in playing the band-arranged ver
sion of Free's "All Right Now" (which reportedly
signifies a forced turnover) several times during
the Orange Bowl, clearly audible on national tele
vision.
For those unaware, "All Right Now" was first
arranged by the Stanford Band ("LSJUMB") and
debuted at the 1972 Rose Bowl. It has become, as
they say, "the signature song of the LSJUMB."
And I'll be damned if the USC band is going to

TVojan Band not
'All Right Now'

play our song on national TV without hearing
from us.
The Trojan Band is already the most annoying
gang of troubadours in collegiate sports, even
worse than fair-weather Cal fans. They litter ath
letic contests with the nonstop playing of not one
but two obnoxious fight songs. (One of them is
"Tribute To Troy," otherwise known as "DAAH
da da da da DA DA daah").
Now they have the audacity to appropriate a
song from the Stanford Band, the clearest expla
nation being they simply poached it from us in one
of the two schools' many meetings.
Would the Notre Dame band dare play Michi
gan's "Hail to the Victors?" I think not.
In the ongoing war with the Trojans, we need
all the ammunition we can get.

or Penn State-Alabama
(1979).
What no one expected
was what actually hap
pened — Southern Califor
nia jumping out to leads of
28-7, 38-10, and the final

margin, 55-19. (And to think Stanford came
within a couple of plays of beating this team!)
OU scored first, but went limp until scoring
a pitiful touchdown on USC's backups in the
waning minutes.
USC's Heisman quarterback Matt Leinart
threw for five touchdowns and seemingly
could do no wrong, shredding OU's secondary
from all directions. Trojan tailback LenDale
White was supposedly nursing a sore ankle. It
didn't show, as he ran for 121 yards on only 15
carries, including two second-effort touch
downs.
Reggie "President" Bush made a defender
whiff on the first play from scrimmage, and
from that point, he was in the Sooners' heads.
The dominating performance, which
locked up back-to-back USC national titles,
was unlike anything seen since No. 2 Florida's
52-20 Sugar Bowl shellacking of top-ranked
Florida State in 1997.
Moreover, in another chapter of an ongo
ing story, USC bailed out the Bowl Champi
onship Series.
The college football system designed to
produce a No. 1 versus No. 2 title game and an
undisputed champion has been dogged by
controversy since its inception in 1998.
Year after year, people griped that the
wrong team had wound up in the big game.
This year was no exception. Three teams
from top-flight conferences (USC, OU and
Auburn) ended up undefeated going into the
bowl season, along with two smaller-confer
ence teams.
There was even an alleged, if unfalsifiable,
vote-selling scandal, of which Rose Bowl
bound Texas was the beneficiary. In a related
story, for the third time in four seasons the
Rose Bowl was doomed to a game other than
its traditional Big Ten-Pac 10 matchup.
But this year, with remaining undefeateds
Utah and Auburn nipping at their heels, the
Trojans left absolutely no doubt as to who was
the best team in college football. In a sport
where you need to be great fora whole season
to win the championship, USC went one fur
ther — the Trojans were all but bulletproof.
I was actually going to write a column
about my opposition to a Division I-A playoff,
but it shouldn't take more than a couple of
sentences to describe the ludicrousness of
seeding an eight- or 16-team tournament
when by the end of November only two or at
most three teams can reasonably be consid

ered national champion material. Besides, the
myriad bowls afford mid-level teams the chance
to play a fun, competitive matchup and go home,
rather than the guaranteed butt-kicking they
would face at the hands of the high-seeded teams.
But even with the Pac-10's proudest moment on
display, Southern Cal still managed to stab a sister
institution in the back — in fact, visiting an almost
unspeakable offense upon our fair university.
In a shocking display of disrespect, the Trojan
band indulged in playing the band-arranged ver
sion of Free's "All Right Now" (which reportedly
signifies a forced turnover) several times during
the Orange Bowl, clearly audible on national tele
vision.
For those unaware, "All Right Now" was first
arranged by the Stanford Band ("LSJUMB") and
debuted at the 1972 Rose Bowl. It has become, as
they say, "the signature song of the LSJUMB."
And I'll be damned if the USC band is going to

TVojan Band not
'All Right Now'

play our song on national TV without hearing
from us.
The Trojan Band is already the most annoying
gang of troubadours in collegiate sports, even
worse than fair-weather Cal fans. They litter ath
letic contests with the nonstop playing of not one
but two obnoxious fight songs. (One of them is
"Tribute To Troy," otherwise known as "DAAH
da da da da DA DA daah").
Now they have the audacity to appropriate a
song from the Stanford Band, the clearest expla
nation being they simply poached it from us in one
of the two schools' many meetings.
Would the Notre Dame band dare play Michi
gan's "Hail to the Victors?" I think not.
In the ongoing war with the Trojans, we need
all the ammunition we can get.

In a shameless show of excellence, on
Tuesday night the top-ranked USC Tro
jans made liars out of an entire nation's
sports media.
The Orange Bowl against No. 2 Oklahoma
was billed as the most balanced matchup in re
cent history. The most talent ever on the field
at one time. Two Heisman trophy winners and
two other finalists in the game.
Commentators and columnists were so ex
cited about this Monster Matchup that they
were afraid to make predictions.

Speculation ran that it
would be decided by a criti
cal turnover or fluky play.
