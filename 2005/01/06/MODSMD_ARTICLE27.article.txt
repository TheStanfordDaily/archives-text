# Men's swimming set for first true test of season
## 
### SAMUEL CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the general student body of
Stanford celebrated the New Year and
the last week of winter break in sepa
rate areas throughout the world, the
Cardinal men's swim team could be
found all together in one place, twice a
day. That place was in the long course
pools of the Avery Aquatic Center,
where daily practices occurred once in
the morning and once in the after
noon, starting December 27th.
In what is traditionally dubbed
"Christmas Training," the team un
derwent grueling workouts in prepara
tion for the upcoming dual-meet sea
son, which commences with the first
swimming event of the new year on
Friday, when the No. 5 Cardinal (1-0)
host the No. 9 Michigan Wolverines on
the Farm at 1 p.m.
"We spent six days in the rain ham
mering ourselves into great shape," se

nior Gary Marshall said. "While it was
a shorter period than most years, we
all made good progress."
One of the five seniors on this
year's Cardinal swim team, Marshall
predicts this dual-meet season will be a
remarkably successful one. The dual
meet season marks the first step to
ward what the Cardinal hopes is a na
tional championship and No. 1 rank
ing, a feat that last year's team came
within one spot of securing.
Stanford's showdown with Michi
gan will be the first mid-season test
against a top-tier team. Like the Car
dinal, the Wolverines are a national
powerhouse that competes for the na
tional title each year.
"We have been training non-stop
for four months and the team is ready
to be let loose," Marshall said. "Every
one is very excited to test themselves
against some of the nation's best swim-
mers, beginning this weekend."
The air of confidence is sweeping throughout
the team, as sophomore Hongzhe Sun echoed
the same feeling of optimism.
"It's going to be a challenge this year, but I
think the team is ready to go out and swim fast
this season," Sun said.
The challenge that Sun is talking about is the
number of swimmers competing for the Cardi
nal this season. This year's squad is one of the
smallest teams, thus giving all the athletes less
room for error.
In year's past, the dual meet between Stan
ford and Michigan has been closely fought and
has produced strong performances by individu
al swimmers. Stanford has come out on top in
the last two years, prevailing 215.5-191.5 in
2004 and 148.5-89.5 in 2003. with the most re
cent win coming on a two-day short-course
meet.
A streaking Michigan team, which is coming

off a dual-meet upset over top-ranked USC on
Jan. 4, is led by to two All-American juniors in
Peter Vanderkaay and Chris DeJong, who are
used to dominating opponents in their respec
tive stroke specialties of freestyle and back
stroke. Vanderkaay competed and won gold
representing the United States on the distance
swimming relay at the 2004 Olympics.
The Wolverine already owns NCAA qualify
ing times in the 200- and 500-yard freestyle
events and a consideration time in the 100.
As Stanford encounters the Wolverines in its
home water on the Farm, Marshall summed up
the sentiment of the Stanford swimmers, confi
dently saying, "1 don't expect to lose."
Stanford will have one more dual meet,
against Pacific at home, before heading into
Pac-10 competition against Arizona State and
Arizona in Arizona, a home date with USC and
the Big Swim against Cal at Berkeley to con
clude the regular season.
