# Card shoot for first Pac-10 win
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
The men's basketball team can either
climb out of the hole it has dug itself in the
Pacific-10 Conference or dig it deeper
when it hosts Arizona State tonight at
Maples Pavilion. A defeat would tag the
Cardinal (6-6.0-2 Pac-10) with their third
loss in the conference, making it very dif
ficult fora team already in the cellar to
win a third-straight Pac-10 championship,
especially with No. 13 Arizona looming
on Saturday.
A matchup that in recent years has
been a gimme — Stanford has won 13
straight against Arizona State —is no
sure thing this time around. The Sun Dev
ils (11-2,0-1 Pac-10), the dregs of the con
ference a year ago, have already topped
last season's record of 10-17. After being
picked to finish at the bottom of the Pac
-10 once again, they have been the surprise
of the conference. Rob Evans' squad has
not been tested often, however, having
played only one ranked opponent — Ari
zona, to whom the Sun Devils lost. 97-79,
on Sunday.
Junior post Ike Diogu is the team's
driving force. He tops the Pac-10 in points,
rebounds and blocks per game. He will try
to add to a streak of four straight 20-point
performances tonight.
"Ike is the best 4-man in the country,"
Stanford head coach Trent Johnson said.
"I think what's really special is the charac
ter of the kid — humble, unassuming,
playing hard, not out there talking. We've
got to do everything we can to try to con
tain him, double-down if we can. He's a
handful."
The Cardinal held Diogu to 14 points
and eight rebounds in Stanford's 81-51
victory at Maples last season, but the team
will have a tough time repeating that feat.
Senior Rob Little and junior Matt
Haryasz will likely share the duty of cov
ering Diogu.
"We've done well against him in the
past, but that doesn't mean we will Thurs
day," Little said.
The main difference this year is the Sun
Devils' improved supporting cast, which
has capitalized on opportunities when
teams double down on Diogu.

Sophomore forward Serge Angounou
has averaged 8.6 points and 6.7 rebounds
per game.
Senior guard Steve Moore and sopho
more guard Kevin Kruger have provided
a strong outside threat to complement
Diogu's inside game. Moore, a junior col
lege transfer, is averaging 12.7 points per
game and is shooting 38 percent from be
yond the arc, while Kruger shoots at a 46
percent clip from long range.
Stanford will try to build on the last 10
minutes of the Washington game, a span
in which the Cardinal went on a 16-2 run
and briefly took the lead before falling,
76-73. The starters showed they still had
some gas left down the stretch, despite av
eraging 30 minutes a game as a unit due to
a lack of depth off the bench.
That problem will only grow with the
loss of redshirt freshman Tim Morris, who
was declared academically ineligible for
winter quarter by the NCAA. The an
nouncement came two days after Morris
received his first start.
Senior Nick Robinson will likely see
less time at the power forward position,
forcing freshmen Taj Finger and Peter
Prowitt into bigger roles. The front line
will be thinner with Robinson at guard
and without sophomore Evan Moore,
who left the team to focus on football.
Johnson said that the team's style of
play — working the ball inside and then
out — will not change with the losses of
Morris and Moore.
"We are who we are, and we're going
to have to continue to work with a sense of
urgency," he said. "We're not changing
anything."
Urgency is what the Cardinal seem to
have lacked on offense. Stanford has strug
gled to get to the free throw line of late and
shot only five free throws against Washing
ton, none of them in the second half.
"My stance is if you play harder and
smarter, things will take care of them
selves," Johnson said. "We don't worry
about the officiating. Washington beat us
because they were better that day."
For the first time this season, Stanford
will play a home game with the benefit of a
full Sixth Man Club. Its influence may come
into play tonight: Arizona State will be play
ing only its third road game of the year.

Prowitt into bigger roles. The front line
will be thinner with Robinson at guard
and without sophomore Evan Moore,
who left the team to focus on football.
Johnson said that the team's style of
play — working the ball inside and then
out — will not change with the losses of
Morris and Moore.
"We are who we are, and we're going
to have to continue to work with a sense of
urgency," he said. "We're not changing
anything."
Urgency is what the Cardinal seem to
have lacked on offense. Stanford has strug
gled to get to the free throw line of late and
shot only five free throws against Washing
ton, none of them in the second half.
"My stance is if you play harder and
smarter, things will take care of them
selves," Johnson said. "We don't worry
about the officiating. Washington beat us
because they were better that day."
For the first time this season, Stanford
will play a home game with the benefit of a
full Sixth Man Club. Its influence may come
into play tonight: Arizona State will be play
ing only its third road game of the year.

Junior point guard Chris Hernandez and the Cardinal hope to turn heads
tonight when they host ASU at the new Maples Pavilion.
The men's basketball team can either
climb out of the hole it has dug itself in the
Pacific-10 Conference or dig it deeper
when it hosts Arizona State tonight at
Maples Pavilion. A defeat would tag the
Cardinal (6-6.0-2 Pac-10) with their third
loss in the conference, making it very dif
ficult fora team already in the cellar to
win a third-straight Pac-10 championship,
especially with No. 13 Arizona looming
on Saturday.
A matchup that in recent years has
been a gimme — Stanford has won 13
straight against Arizona State —is no
sure thing this time around. The Sun Dev
ils (11-2,0-1 Pac-10), the dregs of the con
ference a year ago, have already topped
last season's record of 10-17. After being
picked to finish at the bottom of the Pac
-10 once again, they have been the surprise
of the conference. Rob Evans' squad has
not been tested often, however, having
played only one ranked opponent — Ari
zona, to whom the Sun Devils lost. 97-79,
on Sunday.
Junior post Ike Diogu is the team's
driving force. He tops the Pac-10 in points,
rebounds and blocks per game. He will try
to add to a streak of four straight 20-point
performances tonight.
"Ike is the best 4-man in the country,"
Stanford head coach Trent Johnson said.
"I think what's really special is the charac
ter of the kid — humble, unassuming,
playing hard, not out there talking. We've
got to do everything we can to try to con
tain him, double-down if we can. He's a
handful."
The Cardinal held Diogu to 14 points
and eight rebounds in Stanford's 81-51
victory at Maples last season, but the team
will have a tough time repeating that feat.
Senior Rob Little and junior Matt
Haryasz will likely share the duty of cov
ering Diogu.
"We've done well against him in the
past, but that doesn't mean we will Thurs
day," Little said.
The main difference this year is the Sun
Devils' improved supporting cast, which
has capitalized on opportunities when
teams double down on Diogu.

Sophomore forward Serge Angounou
has averaged 8.6 points and 6.7 rebounds
per game.
Senior guard Steve Moore and sopho
more guard Kevin Kruger have provided
a strong outside threat to complement
Diogu's inside game. Moore, a junior col
lege transfer, is averaging 12.7 points per
game and is shooting 38 percent from be
yond the arc, while Kruger shoots at a 46
percent clip from long range.
Stanford will try to build on the last 10
minutes of the Washington game, a span
in which the Cardinal went on a 16-2 run
and briefly took the lead before falling,
76-73. The starters showed they still had
some gas left down the stretch, despite av
eraging 30 minutes a game as a unit due to
a lack of depth off the bench.
That problem will only grow with the
loss of redshirt freshman Tim Morris, who
was declared academically ineligible for
winter quarter by the NCAA. The an
nouncement came two days after Morris
received his first start.
Senior Nick Robinson will likely see
less time at the power forward position,
forcing freshmen Taj Finger and Peter
Prowitt into bigger roles. The front line
will be thinner with Robinson at guard
and without sophomore Evan Moore,
who left the team to focus on football.
