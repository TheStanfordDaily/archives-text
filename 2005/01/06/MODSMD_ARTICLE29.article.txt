# Dangerous Diogu leads Sun Devils
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Pacific-10 Conference teams from
Tucson to Pullman are quivering in the
face of the same challenge that the late
democratic presidential candidate Adlai
Stevenson once did: defeating Ike.
It's perfectly fitting that teams prepar
ing to take on Arizona State's All-Ameri
can candidate Ike Diogu often take a page
from the original "Ike's" administration
by pursuing a containment policy. As in,
you can't stop the 6-foot-8, 255-pound
Diogu. you can only hope to contain him.
Such will he the case tonight, when
Stanford hosts the Sun Devils at Maples
Pavilion, with both teams looking for their
first Pac-10 victories of the season.
While Diogu's legend, carved out over
two-and-a-half seasons in Tempe, is grad
ually stretching across the college basket
ball landscape, he's been well known and
respected in these parts since he stepped
onto the floor as a freshman.
Just ask Stanford head coach Trent
Johnson, who calls Diogu the best 4-man
in the country. Johnson's assessment is

not solely based on watching the big man
on tape, as he has coached against Diogu
once before.
In December 2002. Johnson's Nevada
Wolf Pack traveled to Tempe, where
Diogu was already making waves in the
desert less than 10 games into his colle
giate career.
"When I saw him as a freshman, the
first thing that I said after the game was,
'He won't be around very long."' Johnson
said.
In 36 minutes of work that night, Diogu
scored 25 points and pulled down nine re
bounds to lead Arizona State to a 76-63
win.
"I wish he was gone now," Johnson
said. "You were really impressed with his
maturity at the time.
"He has got to lead the country in
three-point plays," Johnson continued.
"That's the thing that really concerns me.
If he gets the ball really deep, he's so
strong, he can go left shoulder he can go
right shoulder, you can put a hand on him
and a body on him. and he's got the ball
above his shoulders and it's going in and
he's going to the free throw line."

"He's really good at getting to the free
throw line, and that's a problem," added
senior center Rob Little, who is coming
off one of his best games of the season and
will carry a lot of the defensive burden
tonight. "He gets people in foul trouble,
which could really hurt us."
Johnson and Little's concerns over
Diogu's ability to get to the free throw line
are well founded. Diogu has 56 tradition
al three-point plays in his career and is
shooting at an 87 percent clip from the line
this season.
To put his knack for getting to the
charity stripe in perspective, not only does
he lead the nation in free throws attempt
ed (140), but his 122 free throws made are
more than all but one player in the nation
has attempted. Still not impressed? Com
bined, Stanford's starting five has made
only five more free throws than Diogu.
Despite being constantly double- and
triple-teamed, Diogu is averaging 22.8
points and 10.3 rebounds per game this
season.
"It's always been a good battle, we've
