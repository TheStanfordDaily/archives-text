### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The five-year Campaign for Undergraduate Educa
tion has reached its $ 1 billion dollar goal. University offi
cials announced yesterday. Scheduled to run until Dec.
31, 2005, CUE hit the billion-dollar mark during winter
break. The exact total has not yet been released to The
Daily.
In an earlier interview regarding University cam
paigns, Vice President of Development John Ford said
that last December "was the busiest month of our year."
He also emphasized the need to continue promoting
CUE, even though the goal was surpassed almost one
year early, because of the perpetual need to fund under
graduate education at Stanford.
Launched in late 20(H). CUE is dedicated to support
ing undergraduate programs and scholarships. Over 80
percent of CUE donations go toward building the en
dowment. Programs funded by CUE include the Over
seas Studies Program, Honors College, and freshman
and sophomore seminars.
CUE gained momentum early when, in May of 2001,
the Hewlett Foundation donated $100 million. Since
then. Stanford alumni have given hundreds of millions to
CUE, which was heavily promoted by the University
during undergraduate class reunions.
