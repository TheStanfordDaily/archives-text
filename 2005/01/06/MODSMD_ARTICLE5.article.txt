# Students band together to fundraise for relief effort
## 
### CYNTHIA H. CHO MANAGING EDITOR 
Members of the newly formed Stan
ford United Relief Effort — a coalition
of more than 10 student organizations
— will meet tonight to discuss plans for
a University-wide relief effort to assist
victims of the tsunamis that hit South
Asia last month. On tonight's agenda is
the selection of the charity or charities
to which the organization will donate
funds raised from the student body.
The meeting, which will take place
at 8:45 p.m. in Tresidder Union's Cy
press Lounge, is open to all students.
In the days immediately following
the Dec. 26 tsunamis. Pi Beta Phi Presi
dent Mira Rapp-Hooper. a junior,
talked to fellow Pi Phi members about
how her group could help the victims.
"We all agreed that we wanted our
organization to take part in the relief ef
forts." she said. "And the more we

talked about it. we decided that the ef
forts should encompass all students
groups that had interest."
Rapp-Hooper's instincts proved
correct. Around the same time that she
was brainstorming ways in which her
sorority could be involved in a large
scale initiative, Srihari Yamanoor was
doing the same.
Yamanoor, a fourth-year graduate
student in mechanical engineering, met
with fellow members of the Stanford
India Association soon after the
tsunamis struck South Asia. Among
the countries most affected are India
and Sri Lanka, as well as Indonesia,
Maldives and Thailand.
They contacted other organizations,
such as Sanskriti and the American Red
Cross Club at Stanford University, to
coordinate their efforts because they
felt that the "best thing to do would be
to team up with other organizations,"
Yamanoor said.

Stanford's Red Cross Club was in
volved in larger relief efforts and its
members hoped to be active on cam
pus.
"Ever since [Dec. 26], we have
worked with the Palo Alto American
Red Cross chapter," said junior Mark
Liao, president of the organization.
"On campus, we faced the unique chal
lenge of there being at least three other
groups who had formed their coalitions
to do fundraising. None of us were com
municating."

A vigil of prayer and remembrance
for those affected by the Dec. 26
tsunamis will be held at Memorial
Church today at noon. The event is
open to the public. For more infor
mation, contact the Office for Re
ligious Life.
