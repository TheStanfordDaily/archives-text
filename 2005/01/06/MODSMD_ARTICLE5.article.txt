# Students band together to fundraise for relief effort
## 
### CYNTHIA H. CHO MANAGING EDITOR 
Members of the newly formed Stan
ford United Relief Effort — a coalition
of more than 10 student organizations
— will meet tonight to discuss plans for
a University-wide relief effort to assist
victims of the tsunamis that hit South
Asia last month. On tonight's agenda is
the selection of the charity or charities
to which the organization will donate
funds raised from the student body.
The meeting, which will take place
at 8:45 p.m. in Tresidder Union's Cy
press Lounge, is open to all students.
In the days immediately following
the Dec. 26 tsunamis. Pi Beta Phi Presi
dent Mira Rapp-Hooper. a junior,
talked to fellow Pi Phi members about
how her group could help the victims.
"We all agreed that we wanted our
organization to take part in the relief ef
forts." she said. "And the more we

talked about it. we decided that the ef
forts should encompass all students
groups that had interest."
Rapp-Hooper's instincts proved
correct. Around the same time that she
was brainstorming ways in which her
sorority could be involved in a large
scale initiative, Srihari Yamanoor was
doing the same.
Yamanoor, a fourth-year graduate
student in mechanical engineering, met
with fellow members of the Stanford
India Association soon after the
tsunamis struck South Asia. Among
the countries most affected are India
and Sri Lanka, as well as Indonesia,
Maldives and Thailand.
They contacted other organizations,
such as Sanskriti and the American Red
Cross Club at Stanford University, to
coordinate their efforts because they
felt that the "best thing to do would be
to team up with other organizations,"
Yamanoor said.

Stanford's Red Cross Club was in
volved in larger relief efforts and its
members hoped to be active on cam
pus.
"Ever since [Dec. 26], we have
worked with the Palo Alto American
Red Cross chapter," said junior Mark
Liao, president of the organization.
"On campus, we faced the unique chal
lenge of there being at least three other
groups who had formed their coalitions
to do fundraising. None of us were com
municating."

A vigil of prayer and remembrance
for those affected by the Dec. 26
tsunamis will be held at Memorial
Church today at noon. The event is
open to the public. For more infor
mation, contact the Office for Re
ligious Life.

Stanford's Red Cross Club is not
holding its own fundraising events.
"Because [SURE| is such an im
portant effort, we've decided to wait
before doing any fundraising our
selves. We don't want tocompete with
SURE, wc want to work with SURE,"
Liao said.
Rapp-Hooper, Yamanoor and
Liao were among 35 students who met
Tuesday night. Though there was talk
that night of setting a goal of $50,000
over the next four weeks, the target
may change — to raise more money
if faculty and staff take part.
Rapp-Hooper said that she e
mailed University President John
Hennessy to ask fora University do
nation.
"He said that he couldn't submit
University funds to the project be

cause funds are pre-budgeted," Rapp-
Hooper said. "But he said he and his
office would communicate with facul
ty and staff to contribute. He said that
in the event that this coalition [SURE]
is organized, he would make a consid
erable donation. I hope a lot of others
will follow suit."
The Daily was not able to reach
Hennessy before press time.
Though established to aid victims
of the South Asian tsunamis, SURE
has been created to exist long after
those efforts are finished. Yamanoor
and Rapp-Hooper pointed out that
the name of the group is not specific to
the tsunami relief efforts.
"The name 'SURE' was picked be
cause we would keep it operational
after efforts to South Asia are done,"
Rapp-Hooper said, adding that it

Coalition looks to raise
$50,000 in four weeks

would be a "community outlet" for
fundraising.
At one of three meetings that took
place on Tuesday, Yamanoor and
those he worked with invited Emeri
tus Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy to talk to the students because
Abernety has worked with many in
ternational non-governmental organi
zations. Suzanne Abel, director of ex
ternal relations of the Haas Center for
Public Service, also attended.
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
is also participating. Sophomore Luz
Erendira Reyes is one of two senators
who will remain involved with SURE.
"We will be the point people if they
want to do something with the ASSU
and have questions," Reyes said.
