# Facebook unveils school-specific advertisements
## 
### JESSICA ZHANG 
Thcfaccbook.com. the online directo
ry popular at colleges across the country
including Stanford, has undergone a
minor facelift. In addition to pictures, per
sonal profiles and messages on the "wall,"
students can now post announcements or
ads.
Implemented in the beginning of De
cember, the left hand column of several
pages now contain paid advertisements

specific to each school. It costs $14 a day
to place an ad.
"We want to keep the site as ground
ed in individual school communities as
possible," explained Chris Hughes, "press
guy" and co-founder of
Thefacebook.com. "We don't particular
ly love banner ads and we hate pop-ups.
so we were trying to come up with a legit
imate alternative that people would actu
ally appreciate seeing."
Some Stanford students who frequent

ly use Thefacebook.com say that they
have not found the announcements to be
a nuisance.
"Facebook has to make money some
how. and I don't really notice the ads. so I
don't mind them," said freshmen Sheva
Diagne.
Others concur.
"I notice them but I don't really pay at
tention to them. I see that they're there,
but it doesn't really make a difference to
me. It doesn't hinder my Facebook expe

rience at all," said freshman Megan
Hansen.
Prices of announcements, depending
on the population at a particular school,
vary between $10 to $15 per day. Ads are
in rotation with others for that particular
day. For $14 day. Stanford students, stu
dent-run groups, and even local business
es can post ads that can be viewed by near
ly 40,000 pain <>t eyes.
This coverage, claims Hughes, is more
than sufficient.
"[This method of advertising]
seems pretty effective. Anyone who
buys an announcement for one day
can pretty much guarantee that
about 65 percent of their student
body will see it, which is amazing
publicity," Hughes said.
Stanford students have been
quick to utilize this service, although
according to Hughes, "usage has
been a little below average at Stan
ford" compared to other universi
ties. "Examples of groups that have
bought ads at Stanford include
birthday shout-outs, advertisements
fora Modest Mouse concert, and
free iPods," Hughes said.
At other universities, the use of
the ad space has been more diverse.
"Political groups have used them, as
have candidates for student elec
tions," Hughes said. Additional ex
amples of how others have used this
novel service include concert adver
tisements as well as advertisements,
for dances and other social events.
