# 'Lit Room' Web site shows off student work
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Lit Room, a new
Web site featuring Stanford stu
dents' fiction and poetry, debuts
today and will be updated every
Monday with new work.
"I feel like students try so hard in
workshop, and then at the end of the
quarter, their writing just ends up in
a desk drawer," said fiction lecturer
Tom Kealey, who spearheaded the
project and is the faculty advisor.
"I'd say most of the creative writing
faculty feels that the work produced
in workshop is absolutely publish
able."
Anyone who has taken at least
one creative writing class is eligible
to submit his or her work, which is
selected and posted weekly by a
committee of student editors.
"Students have a lot of ideas on
the writing process and each other's
writing," Kealey said. "We're really
trying to build a creative writing
community and connect students
and faculty."
Senior Nicholai Lidow, the au
thor of "Facing the Brightness," the
first story to be posted on the site,
said he was happy to find a venue for
his writing.
"I was kind of hesitant at first, but
Tom was very encouraging, and now
I feel better about it," Lidow said.
In addition to Lidow's story,
which he describes as a fictional ac
count of his experiences in Sri Lanka
over the summer, the Web site also

showcases sophomore Lauren Cald
well's poem "Geometry: A Year in
the City."
"Who doesn't want exposure and
praise?" said Adam Johnson, also a
fiction lecturer in the Creative Writ
ing Program, when asked why stu
dents should submit work to the site.
"The faculty is really interested in
reading what students produce.
That's the reward, being around in
spired young people."
Kealey said he hopes the Web
site will prove as popular as the Four
Minute Reading Series, another pro
ject initiated last year that allows stu
dents in all departments to read their
poems and fiction to a live audience.
"I think the Lit Room will work
wonderfully hand-in-hand with Four
Minute," Johnson said.
The idea for the Reading Series
originated from Kealey's own expe
rience as an undergraduate writer
frustrated with the lack of venues
where students could read work.
"Almost all the opportunities I
had to read were off campus," he
said. "1 was terrified, of course, but
in the end it really did feel good. It
made me feel like a real writer."
Kealey said his main goal with
new programming is to connect writ
ing students and faculty members
who do not already know each other,
and to celebrate the creative work
produced by students.

sponsors the Stanford Lit Room,
and the next deadline for submis
sions is Jan. 28.
