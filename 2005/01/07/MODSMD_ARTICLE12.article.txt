# Touching Tongues
## High school ex-boyfriend? What high school ex-boy friend? 
### 
After the host who replaced Dick
Clark post-stroke counted backward
from 10, and the crystal ball dropped
on Times Square, even socially dys
functional Stanford kids could man
age to score some tonsil-hockey.
But what about that special guy or
gal you left back on the Farm? Have
you called? Has she? Did you have
"the talk" before you were leaving on
a jet plane? We think not.
While Stanford students may be
exceedingly eloquent when discussing

the air-speed
velocity of
an unladen
swallow
(African, not
European),
their inter
personal
skills leave
something to
be desired
(that some
thing being
words spo
ken to any
one other
than a TA or
your stuffed

armadillo, Ernesto). All this lack of
communication begs the question:
With three weeks and 12 states divid
ing you from your special someone,
how will your semblance of a pre
break relationship fair?
In the safe confines of your white
washed cinder-block cell, you never
had to define your flirtations (read:
hours of 1M conversation) with your
chemistry study buddy. But that awk
ward moment after you hug or con
genially shake hands goodbye before
break says it all.
Your high school friends will ask
whether you're attached or swingin'
single and you won't know what that
goodbye touch meant. Should you
call her your girlfriend, or will her
commitment-phobic super hearing
catch it from thousands of miles away
and send her screaming back to her
"really chill" CS 106X study buddy?
And how about keeping in touch?
There are those who have phone sex
three times a day, and those who talk
about nothing more than local weath
er patterns three times all break.
If the thought of frittering away
200 of your precious anytime minutes
away chatting with someone you can't
possibly take to bone town in the near
future gives you a frowny-face, maybe
a breakup is just what you need to
turn that frown upside down.
Then there's the question of fideli
ty. Did you subscribe to the Hos in
Different Area Codes Rule? Your
columnists and Ludacris agree that if
your girlfriend is not a local call, it's
fair to play ball. Besides, it's almost a
requirement that you spend at least
one night "reminiscing about high
school" with your ex, especially if you
only broke up to avoid being one of
the lame-ass freshmen in a long dis
tance relationship.
Lastly, you must evaluate whether
you fit in the "absence makes the
heart grow fonder" or "out of sight,
out of mind" camp.
If it's the first, you may want to
remove those key numbers from your
phone book. A few beers and some
spare time will loosen those dialing
fingers right up and may even lead to
the slip of the L-word. There's just no
way to recover.
On the other hand, if you have
completely forgotten about the exis
tence of anyone outside 'of
Hometown, U.S. A., you may want to
knock a few back and rid yourself of
the excess baggage via Stanford
Webmail.
Now that you've returned to said
Farm, you might want to take a few
minutes away from shopping for
classes to practice your innocent face
in the mirror. Try saying "High school
ex-boyfriend? What high school ex
boyfriend?" convincingly three times
in front of the mirror before you ven
ture into post-break contact. If all else
fails, hit low and run.

whether you're attached or swingin'
single and you won't know what that
goodbye touch meant. Should you
call her your girlfriend, or will her
commitment-phobic super hearing
catch it from thousands of miles away
and send her screaming back to her
"really chill" CS 106X study buddy?
And how about keeping in touch?
There are those who have phone sex
three times a day, and those who talk
about nothing more than local weath
er patterns three times all break.
If the thought of frittering away
200 of your precious anytime minutes
away chatting with someone you can't
possibly take to bone town in the near
future gives you a frowny-face, maybe
a breakup is just what you need to
turn that frown upside down.
Then there's the question of fideli
ty. Did you subscribe to the Hos in
Different Area Codes Rule? Your
columnists and Ludacris agree that if
your girlfriend is not a local call, it's
fair to play ball. Besides, it's almost a
requirement that you spend at least
one night "reminiscing about high
school" with your ex, especially if you
only broke up to avoid being one of
the lame-ass freshmen in a long dis
tance relationship.
Lastly, you must evaluate whether
you fit in the "absence makes the
heart grow fonder" or "out of sight,
out of mind" camp.
If it's the first, you may want to
remove those key numbers from your
phone book. A few beers and some
spare time will loosen those dialing
fingers right up and may even lead to
the slip of the L-word. There's just no
way to recover.
On the other hand, if you have
completely forgotten about the exis
tence of anyone outside 'of
Hometown, U.S. A., you may want to
knock a few back and rid yourself of
the excess baggage via Stanford
Webmail.
Now that you've returned to said
Farm, you might want to take a few
minutes away from shopping for
classes to practice your innocent face
in the mirror. Try saying "High school
ex-boyfriend? What high school ex
boyfriend?" convincingly three times
in front of the mirror before you ven
ture into post-break contact. If all else
fails, hit low and run.
