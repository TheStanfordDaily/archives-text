# A 						dramatic librarian: Green's Santa speaks
## 
### NOAH WEISS 
Even without the white fur-lined red
suit, he resembles Santa Claus — thanks to
his bulbous stomach, wavy white hair
reaching down to his broad shoulders and
frizzy white beard that could go inch-for
inch with ZZ Top's.
You may know him as the voice that
brightens your Dead Week when he
announces that the loan desk is closed and
that Green Library is "now a study hall"
and directs you to "please conduct your
selves accordingly."
The man behind the beard and voice is
R.T. Carr.
Growing up at San Quentin Prison,
where his father worked, Carr would come
to Stanford athletic games with his godfa
ther, who worked as an usher.
"I always wanted to go here," he said.
"But I never had the grades."
Carr found his way to Stanford two
decades ago with a job as the portal moni
tor at Green Library. For his first five years,
he not only helped students scan in their ID
cards while entering and checked their
backpacks when leaving, he also asked
them what movie they were renting and
wished them good night.
"There was one little girl who, every
night, was the third-to-last one out." he
said. "On her last day, she broke down cry
ing and said, "You were the only one
besides my mommy who ever said good
night to me."'
A self-described "film buff" who has
seen over 3,000 documentaries from the
library's collection, Carr acted as the resi
dent Siskel and Ebert. He helped the many
students who used the library's movie col
lection and free rentals find the perfect
film. Three of his favorites are "Citizen
Kane," "Lawrence of Arabia" and

"Mystery of Picasso."
Alter working at the front desk, Carr
moved on to making PA announcements,
which he has been doing for the last 15
years. That's where his B.A. in drama
comes in handy.
His training is evident in the dips and

rises in intonation and dry humor of his
announcements. During an interview with
this reporter, he acted out movie scenes
and used body language — for example,
using his hands to emphasize periods at the
end of sentences.

The announcements he makes at Meyer
Library have a "stream of consciousness
slash-soap opera-slash-seasonal feel," he
said. At Green he tries to "keep it fresh"
and "add oblique humor."
One of his favorite lines is: "If you leave
your laptop, it might not be there when you

get back."
Every day before work, Carr sits outside
the library and plays his guitar. His classic
Christmas melodies, as well as an adapta
tion of Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is
Your Land" into an ode to Leland Stanford

titled "This Land is His Land," have earned
him a loyal fan base.
"One lady asks me every three weeks
fora song to make her cry," he said.
"Golden Vanity," he said, works every
time.
He even has a CD at the Stanford
Bookstore, "Christmas 2005," which is
filled with his favorite Christmas songs and
his readings of Dickens' "A Christmas
Carol."
The songs he chose to include, he noted,
are all over a century old and no longer
subject to copyright laws. The cover of the
album is, not surprisingly, a close-up of Carr
with his billowing beard and a red Santa
hat
Since 1965, Carr has played Santa at var
ious stores and events, and he has created
his own unique character.
"My version [of Santa] is a modern guy,"
he said. "He follows the toy market."
Because he has always been a volun
teer Santa — never a store employee —
he says he can tell kids where to get the
best prices.
"I'm pretty real," he said, differentiating
himself from more commercial Santas.
"[Meeting me] is not like going to the
mall."
For decades. Carr has volunteered dur
ing the holiday season at local organiza
tions, including Stanford basketball games.
The Athletic Department usually provides
him with gifts to give to kids. One year he
gave away 500 basketballs.
There is even an auction where people
bid to sit next to him during the game to
work as Santa's helper elves giving out
gifts.
"Kids mob me whether in uniform or
not," he said. "'l'm on a break right now,' I
tell them."

Carr found his way to Stanford two
decades ago with a job as the portal moni
tor at Green Library. For his first five years,
he not only helped students scan in their ID
cards while entering and checked their
backpacks when leaving, he also asked
them what movie they were renting and
wished them good night.
"There was one little girl who, every
night, was the third-to-last one out." he
said. "On her last day, she broke down cry
ing and said, "You were the only one
besides my mommy who ever said good
night to me."'
A self-described "film buff" who has
seen over 3,000 documentaries from the
library's collection, Carr acted as the resi
dent Siskel and Ebert. He helped the many
students who used the library's movie col
lection and free rentals find the perfect
film. Three of his favorites are "Citizen
Kane," "Lawrence of Arabia" and

"Mystery of Picasso."
Alter working at the front desk, Carr
moved on to making PA announcements,
which he has been doing for the last 15
years. That's where his B.A. in drama
comes in handy.
His training is evident in the dips and

rises in intonation and dry humor of his
announcements. During an interview with
this reporter, he acted out movie scenes
and used body language — for example,
using his hands to emphasize periods at the
end of sentences.

The announcements he makes at Meyer
Library have a "stream of consciousness
slash-soap opera-slash-seasonal feel," he
said. At Green he tries to "keep it fresh"
and "add oblique humor."
One of his favorite lines is: "If you leave
your laptop, it might not be there when you

get back."
Every day before work, Carr sits outside
the library and plays his guitar. His classic
Christmas melodies, as well as an adapta
tion of Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is
Your Land" into an ode to Leland Stanford

titled "This Land is His Land," have earned
him a loyal fan base.
"One lady asks me every three weeks
fora song to make her cry," he said.
"Golden Vanity," he said, works every
time.
He even has a CD at the Stanford
Bookstore, "Christmas 2005," which is
filled with his favorite Christmas songs and
his readings of Dickens' "A Christmas
Carol."
The songs he chose to include, he noted,
are all over a century old and no longer
subject to copyright laws. The cover of the
album is, not surprisingly, a close-up of Carr
with his billowing beard and a red Santa
hat
Since 1965, Carr has played Santa at var
ious stores and events, and he has created
his own unique character.
"My version [of Santa] is a modern guy,"
he said. "He follows the toy market."
Because he has always been a volun
teer Santa — never a store employee —
he says he can tell kids where to get the
best prices.
"I'm pretty real," he said, differentiating
himself from more commercial Santas.
"[Meeting me] is not like going to the
mall."
For decades. Carr has volunteered dur
ing the holiday season at local organiza
tions, including Stanford basketball games.
The Athletic Department usually provides
him with gifts to give to kids. One year he
gave away 500 basketballs.
There is even an auction where people
bid to sit next to him during the game to
work as Santa's helper elves giving out
gifts.
"Kids mob me whether in uniform or
not," he said. "'l'm on a break right now,' I
tell them."

Even without the white fur-lined red
suit, he resembles Santa Claus — thanks to
his bulbous stomach, wavy white hair
reaching down to his broad shoulders and
frizzy white beard that could go inch-for
inch with ZZ Top's.
You may know him as the voice that
brightens your Dead Week when he
announces that the loan desk is closed and
that Green Library is "now a study hall"
and directs you to "please conduct your
selves accordingly."
The man behind the beard and voice is
R.T. Carr.
Growing up at San Quentin Prison,
where his father worked, Carr would come
to Stanford athletic games with his godfa
ther, who worked as an usher.
"I always wanted to go here," he said.
"But I never had the grades."
