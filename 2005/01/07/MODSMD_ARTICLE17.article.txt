## Students must take initiative abroad 
### MICHELLE KELLER 
I am writing in response to
Christopher Vaughan's op-ed re
garding Stanford's Overseas Studies
Programs (" 'Cultural literacy' a
myth in Stanford OSPs," Jan. 5).
Other students have written in this
paper about the limitations of Stan
ford study abroad programs, mainly
that they are simply Stanford bub
bles centered in another city.
Yet this is not a problem specific
to Stanford OSPs.
Having studied abroad both
through Stanford in Australia and
through a non-Stanford-sponsored
program in Vienna, and as the Head
Student Advisor for the Overseas
Studies Program, 1 have had the op
portunity to interact with many stu
dents who have gone abroad.
Through my personal experiences
and in speaking with others, 1 am
certainly cognizant of the fact that
when students from any university
— any country — travel abroad,
they are likely to cluster together in
order to deal with the culture shock
and the novelty of living and study
ing in another country.
But there is a difference between
students who never leave the bubble
and stay in their comfort zone and
those who dare to step outside and
achieve the cultural literacy that
Vaughan so desired to achieve —
this difference is called personal ini
tiative.
Students who reap the most from
their study-abroad experience are
those who pull themselves away
from the Internet and take a mo
ment from their IM conversations to
explore the city in which they are sit

uated. They are the ones who visit
museums outside of their classes,
read the local newspapers and inter
act with locals other than their OSP
assigned language partners. Vaugh
an complains that he was not ex
posed to the cultural history of the
region in which he stayed, hut I am
hard-pressed to understand how he
can criticize OSP if he himself ad
mits that he and other students
spent much of their time on the
phone and on the Internet.
To be fair, it is important to be re
alistic before students set to go
abroad. You certainly cannot expect
to understand everything about a
culture when you only spend 10
weeks in another country. Imagine
if you came from another country
and spent 10 weeks in San Francis
co. Would you really expect to learn
the entire city's history, let alone the
complete history of the United
States?
Additionally, some students re
turn to Stanford disappointed that
they did not achieve fluency in a lan
guage after a quarter abroad. Per
haps this is due to the fact that many
OSP classes are indeed taught in En
glish. There is a reason, however,
why OSP programs are primarily
English-based: Most students head
ing abroad do not have the time dur
ing their term at Stanford to achieve
a level of proficiency high enough to
enable them to take classes in the
local language. This is especially
true of technical classes. Rather
than setting high language require
ments, OSP has decided to grant
students with limited language ca
pabilities the opportunity to study
abroad.

If you are nearly fluent in another
language and wish to take classes at
a local university, perhaps Stan
ford's OSP programs are not for
you, as they are not for everyone. In
such a case, I would encourage you
to go to the Bechtel International
Center and look fora program that
would better suit your interests.
There are certainly advantages and
disadvantages to studying abroad
with or without Stanford that every
student should consider before she
or he heads abroad.
Which brings me back to my orig
inal point: 1 don't believe Stanford
should take responsibility for every
aspect of a study-abroad experi
ence. The staff at OSP have created
a series of programs that offer ex
traordinary opportunities for Stan
ford students, such as internships in
high-profile firms and the chance to
take courses with world-renowned
professors. But personal initiative
and motivation will have a large in
fluence in the outcome of every
student's personal study abroad
experience.
At Stanford, students make an ef
fort to engage in many activities out
side of classes: They take part in re
search projects, join clubs, play
sports, explore outside interests. I
have faith that Stanford students
can take this same enthusiasm to de
velop outside of their classes when
they study abroad and take charge
of their own education.
