## Explaining economics to strangers on a plane 
### 
I do not want to be Alan
Greenspan. I just wanted to
state that for the record. And
no, I don't have any hot stock
tips either.
Whenever I'm on an airplane
talking to the stranger next to me,
the question invariably comes up,
"What do you do?" I always answer:
"I'm working on my doctorate in
economics."
Every single time, one of two
questions always is asked: "What
stocks should I buy?" or "So you
want to be Alan Greenspan?"

The answer I
always give is I
have no idea what
stocks to buy
economists typi
cally assume it is
impossible to pre
dict the stock
market — and
no, I think
Greenspan's job
is boring.
Though at

times I am impressed by the
amount of economics that has be
come common knowledge in soci
ety — Keynesian ideas are used
commonly by politicians — that,
however, seems to be the extent of
people's knowledge. Keynes died
over 60 years ago. Not only has
macroeconomics come a long way
since Keynes, but economics as a
whole has expanded considerably.
People might be vaguely aware
of topics such as supply and demand
and government regulation, but
they are completely unaware of the
developments of especially the past
few decades, where economic think
ing has invaded the realms of poli
tics. sociology, anthropology, phi
losophy, linguistics, psychology and
even literature. There are economic
theories of language, love, persua
sion. morality, bias, family, discrim
ination, leadership and more.
1 am deeply grateful to the film
"A Beautiful Mind" primarily be
cause it gives me something to point
to after people ask me about Alan
Greenspan. Take the scene where
poor crazy John Nash — perhaps
one of the most influential thinkers
for the economics profession in the
20th century — uses poorly de
scribed economic theory to hit on
girls. This is far closer to the re
search I am interested in.

My current research is about
apologies. The most daunting part
of getting a doctoral degree is that
you have to become the world's ex
pert in some area, however small, of
human knowledge. An easy way of
accomplishing this is to pick a topic
no one else has thought to attempt.
The economics of apologies fits the
bill, either because I am so creative
and clever to come up with it or be
cause no one else has been crazy
enough to think it worth studying.
Yet apologies are important for
economists to think about. Broadly,
apologies help maintain relation
ships, and relationships are crucial
even in modern market economies.
We tend to think of modern markets
as impersonal abstract entities
though in fact relationships are crit
ical. whether it is the alumni contact
that got you the new job, the recom
mendation you got fora plumber or
the old roommate that helps cement
a business deal.
In particular, we see apologies all
the time — whether in day-to-day
interactions, politicians apologizing
to their constituents (or not, as the
case may be), drug companies and
recalls, CEOs and corporate scan
dals or governments for past crimes.
Many of these scenarios have im
portant economic consequences.
A good illustration of many im
portant ideas in the study of apolo
gies can be seen in an experiment
run by psychologists Fiona Lee and
Stanford's Lara Tiedens concerning
Clinton and the Monica Lewinsky
affair. Lee and Tiedens constructed
two video tapes using footage of for
mer president Clinton. In one. Clin
ton appeared angry about the whole
affair, and in the other, he sounded
apologetic.
They then showed the tapes to
two groups of people. Those who
saw angry Clinton disliked Clinton
more, and complained about Clin
ton's lack of apology.
Those who saw sorry Clinton
said they liked the president more.
However, both groups were then
asked questions about respect for
the president, his leadership abili
ties and, most importantly, would
they vote for him again. In all those
questions, the angry Clinton did
better.
We characterize people by multi
