### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Committee on Black Per
forming Arts, also known as CBPA,
will produce tomorrow "The Wed
ding Project," a theatrical perfor
mance exploring African-American
social practices and the concept of
weddings. The play is meant to convey
the importance of community build
ing. CBPA is a University interdisci
plinary program that supports "the
presence of Black art forms at Stan
ford," according to its Web site.
The event is presented in collabo
ration with the Stanford Drama De
partment. the Dance Division, the
East Palo Alto Senior Center and chil
dren from the community.
Kim Fowler, program and devel
opment coordinator of CBPA, said
that the idea for"The Wedding Pro
ject" came from a two-quarter se
quence of classes taught by Aleta
Hayes, the production's director and
one of its dance performers. The first
of the two classes, "Black Social
Dance into the 21st Century." took
place last spring.
"This class worked around the
concept that social dance and social
life are a continuum." Hayes said.
"People always say that social dance is
shaped by its society, but the process
works in reverse as well. Social dances
can influence society's movements,
postures, gestures, and fashion."
The follow-up class, a black social
dance workshop offered last quarter,
put these notions into action.
"We wanted to create a perfor
mance that engaged the community,"
Hayes said. "I got the initial idea for
The Wedding Project' after attending
a Jewish Orthodox Wedding. I real
ized that a wedding is an event that has
implications for creating community.
Ever>' ritual in a wedding is designed
to say 'yes' to community and 'yes' to
the people getting married."
According to Hayes, students in
the class took a trip to the East Palo
Alto Senior Center to interview the
senior citizens about their wedding ex
periences.
"The program will feature bridal
suites.' vignettes written by the stu
dents. which are based on the stories
from the seniors." she said. "We then add move
ment and gestures to the vignettes."
"The Wedding Project" will also feature a re
creation of a Tom Thumb Wedding, a tradition
that was once popular within African-American
communities.
"During Tom Thumb weddings, children
would re-create a wedding in order to raise
money for the church," Fowler said. "In our per
formance, we will have a group of children from
the community recreating a wedding."
it will be a really unique experience to go
into a place on campus that a lot of us are famil
iar with and see that that space is totally different
from anything we've experienced before," she
added.

Class uses dance to
interpret culture

"The Wedding Project" is part of a three-year
program called Resident Dialogues, which
brings artists to campus to work with the students
and the community.
"This program, which is funded by the Ford
Foundation, has given an opportunity for dia
logue between different communities, such as
the University and the surrounding areas," she
said.
The production includes four interactive
events, a performance by Talisman, a live DJ and
a line dance led by the Stanford Soul Line
Dancers, which will encourage audience partici
pation. It starts at 5 p.m. tomorrow in Roble
Gym.
