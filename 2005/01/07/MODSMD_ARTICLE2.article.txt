The Committee on Black Per
forming Arts, also known as CBPA,
will produce tomorrow "The Wed
ding Project," a theatrical perfor
mance exploring African-American
social practices and the concept of
weddings. The play is meant to convey
the importance of community build
ing. CBPA is a University interdisci
plinary program that supports "the
presence of Black art forms at Stan
ford," according to its Web site.
The event is presented in collabo
ration with the Stanford Drama De
partment. the Dance Division, the
East Palo Alto Senior Center and chil
dren from the community.
Kim Fowler, program and devel
opment coordinator of CBPA, said
that the idea for"The Wedding Pro
ject" came from a two-quarter se
quence of classes taught by Aleta
Hayes, the production's director and
one of its dance performers. The first
of the two classes, "Black Social
Dance into the 21st Century." took
place last spring.
"This class worked around the
concept that social dance and social
life are a continuum." Hayes said.
"People always say that social dance is
shaped by its society, but the process
works in reverse as well. Social dances
can influence society's movements,
postures, gestures, and fashion."
The follow-up class, a black social
dance workshop offered last quarter,
put these notions into action.
"We wanted to create a perfor
mance that engaged the community,"
Hayes said. "I got the initial idea for
The Wedding Project' after attending
a Jewish Orthodox Wedding. I real
ized that a wedding is an event that has
implications for creating community.
Ever>' ritual in a wedding is designed
to say 'yes' to community and 'yes' to
the people getting married."
According to Hayes, students in
the class took a trip to the East Palo
Alto Senior Center to interview the
senior citizens about their wedding ex
periences.
"The program will feature bridal
suites.' vignettes written by the stu
dents. which are based on the stories
