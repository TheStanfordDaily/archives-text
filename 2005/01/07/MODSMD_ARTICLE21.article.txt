Students responsible for
immersing themselves
I would like to echo Sarah Barth
elow's comments about Stanford's
overseas study program ("It's up to
students to make the most of their
time abroad," Jan. 5).
Although my experience with
the Stanford program in Tours,
France, is a bit more dated, my ex
perience was similar to hers. There
were students like me who spent as
little time with the other Stanford
students as possible and as much
time making friends with students at
the local university, exploring the
city during the week and traveling
to other parts of France and / or Eu
rope on the weekends.

Then there were other students
who chose to hang out together,
speak English most of the time and
spend more time in the bubble of
the Stanford villa.
1 am confident that the latter
group got far less out of their expe
rience than I did out of mine.
Stanford overseas campuses are
really no different from the main
campus in Palo Alto — what you
get out of it depends on what you
put into it.

USC should not play
Stanford's fight song

I wholeheartedly agree with
columnist Christopher Anderson's
assessment that the USC marching
hand's performance of "All Right
Now" at the Orange Bowl was a
"shocking display of disrespect" to
ward Stanford. ("USC Makes OU.
football pundits look plain silly,"
Jan. 6).
As a former Stanford undergrad
who is currently enrolled in gradu
ate degree programs at both Stan
ford and USC, 1 was appalled when
I heard the Trojan band playing
"All Right Now" at the Orange
Bowl. I was also enraged when the
Trojan Band played "All Right
Now'" inside Stanford Stadium this
season.
I can't believe that a school in

our own athletic conference would
pirate one of our proudest tradi
tions by playing "All Right Now" on
a regular basis. If the USC Band
continues to disrespect Stanford in
this fashion, then they should be
banned from Stanford Stadium
until they stop. I would also encour
age the Stanford Band to make
some sort of protest the next time
we play USC.

Birth control pill is dangerous
If "Health Beat" columnist Lau
ren Gong wants to be a reporter, she

must learn to have more than one
source before she writes a story,
preferably a source who doesn't
profit from the drug in question
("Don't let birth control myths fool
you," Jan. 6),
She's young and isn't 41 like me
and hasn't seen what the pill has
done to her friends over long peri
ods of time from preventing them
from having children to giving them
breast cancer.
I have one question for her. If
HRT has been proven to cause
breast cancer and heart disease, etc..
how can the pill be safe when it's the
same ingredients as HRT, only five
times stronger? Oh. and did she re
search that the pill absolutely must
be taken at the exact same time

every day to boast it's 99 percent
success rate, otherwise it drops
lower than a condom?
Wong should consider the health
and safety of her fellow women
when reporting on such a serious
subject as this — she made it look as
if the pill is as safe as a vitamin.

Cabinet appointment outrageous
I don't care what Alberto Gon
zales promises to do in the future:
The policies of torture he legally
justified in the past make him
scathingly unqualified for Attorney
General.
It is outrageous to me that we
could seriously consider him as a
candidate, and 1 am still appalled
by our ongoing torture of prisoners
in Cuba and in Iraq. It outrages me
that Bush would nominate such a
man, and 1 am angry that Ameri
cans would think nothing of it.
That's right, folks. Gouge out
your eyes. Our country is such a
freak show.
