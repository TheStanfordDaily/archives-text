## Diogu hurts depleted squad 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's basketball team
played Arizona State (12-2, 1-1 Pacific
-10 Conference) tough at Maples Pavil
ion last night, but in the end, it was just
too much Ike.
The Sun Devils' junior forward
scored 28 points to go with 15 rebounds
and led Arizona State to a 81-69 victory
over Stanford (6-7,0-3).
"We wanted to limit Ike, but we
didn't do a great job of that," senior for
ward Nick Robinson said. Stanford head
coach Trent Johnson likened Diogu to a
pro player.
Stanford, already undermanned after
losing Evan Moore to the football team
and Tim Morris to academic probation
in the same week, was also without ju
nior point guard Chris Hernandez, who
missed the game due to back spasms.
Jason Haas started in Hernandez's place
and ran the point well, recording five as
sists and only one turnover.
"I love to get a chance to play well
and try to win, but it hurts to have Chris
out," Haas said.
Junior guard Dan Grunfeld carried
most of the offensive load and scored 24
points. He sank a three-pointer to beat
the buzzer at the end of the first half,
bringing Stanford within eight, but the
Sun Devils quickly built the lead up to 13
and did not let it sink below double-dig
its after that point.
Stanford was unable to muster any
significant second-half runs with Diogu
in the paint. He scored 16 of his points in
the second period and was sent to the
line 11 times. The Cardinal big men
slowed him down, but they could not
stop him.
The Sun Devils went almost exclu
sively to Diogu early on. He scored 12 of
their first 16 points, all but two of which
came on jumpers.
The Cardinal had an opportunity to
take control of the game when Diogu
picked up his second personal foul with
9:16 remaining. He sat out the rest of the
first half, but the Sun Devils switched
gears and went to their outside game.
They got two key three pointers from se
nior point guard Steve Moore and an

other from guard Kevin Kruger. Ari
zona State took a 39-31 lead into half
time.
Stanford moved the ball well and
made an effort to drive to the basket in
the first half. The team played more ag
gressively on offense than they have re
cently. The Cardinal pulled down 20 of
fensive rebounds, six of which belonged

to junior forward Matt Haryasz.
After shooting no more than five free
throws in their last two games, the team
shot 17 last night.
But they had trouble making close
range attempts, and shot only 39.1 per
cent from the field.

Junior guard Dan Grunfeld led the Cardinal with 24 points last night. With the
loss, Stanford remains in the Pac-10 cellar.
"We got good shots, we just didn't finish," Johnson
said. "The ball didn't go down for us. The bottom line for
us was that we got the ball in guys' hands where they
could score, and they didn't score."
Grunfeld was the exception to the rule. On one par
ticularly creative play, he took a pass from Haas and
slipped along the baseline to put in an off-balance layup.
Sophomore Fred Washington made two acrobatic run
ners and played well in Morris's absence.
Stanford drove less in the second half, settling for
jumpers as the Sun Devils' lead grew. With only eight
players dressed for the game — some of whom, like
Haas, played far more minutes than they usually do —
fatigue may have been a factor.
"Our guys played with a lot of effort," Johnson said,
but added that "when you lose your two most explosive
players [Hernandez and Morris], that hurts you."
The Cardinal had trouble finding players to guard
Diogu.
Senior Rob Little picked up three fouls guarding him.
and freshman Peter Prowitt notched four.
The team was also hurt by the strong play of Moore,
who scored l l ) points. Stanford allowed the Sun Devils to
shoot 52.7 percent from the field.
"We have to shore up our defense, especially in tran
sition," Johnson said. "We had way too many break
downs, both mentally and physically, and I think that had
something to do with a lack of stamina." Johnson de
scribed the team's defense as "mediocre at best."
It didn't help that Hernandez, one of the team's best
defenders, was out of commission. He will likely be a
game-time decision against Arizona tomorrow.
