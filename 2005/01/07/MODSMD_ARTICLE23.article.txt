# Sixth Man out in full force; 'Zona awaits
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With Stanford's first three home games
at the renovated Maples Pavilion falling
during winter break, last night marked the
first chance for many Sixth Man Club mem
bers to cheer on the Cardinal in their new
digs.
Despite Stanford's mediocre start to the
season, a healthy contingent of red-clad stu
dents lined up outside Maples for the Cardi
nal's first Pacific-10 Conference home game
of the season.
At the front of the line, which stretched
toward the end of the Avery Aquatic Cen
ter by the time the gates opened at 6 p.m..
stood junior Melissa Luu-Van.
Luu-Van headed over to Maples shortly
after lunch to secure her spot at the head of
the line, and other groups of Stanford bas
ketball's most die-hard fans trickled in be
hind her over the next few hours.
"I'm a little disappointed with the
turnout compared to last year, but 1 under
stand that people are really busy and people
feel like they can't miss class," said Luu-
Van. Domino's pizza in hand. When the
gates finally opened, she headed fora spot
in the front row at the center of Maples' no
longer-bouncy floor.
Stanford's slow start to the season didn't
keep fellow junior Tracy Hadnott from
showing up early either.
"We're not fair-weather fans," said Had
nott, who arrived at 3 p.m. "I bet it will help
the guys to have the home support."
The Sixth Man Club, which was intro
duced as the best student section in the na
tion as part of player introductions, got
plenty of face time on Maples' new video
board hung over center court. Several stu
dents locked lips for all to see on the big
screen as part of a "Kiss Cam" feature dur-
ing the second half.
"The students were excited to
open the new arena in what was the
first real home game of the year in
our minds," said senior Graham
Gilmer, a member of the Sixth
Man Committee. "The atmosphere
was pretty good tonight and we just
have to hope fora better outcome
on Saturday."
After the game, several students
said that the tiered platforms in
stalled in place of the wooden
bleachers will take some getting
used to. Looking up at the center
court scoreboard instead of looking
to the corners of Maples will also
take some adjusting.
Up next: Arizona
Stanford will look to avoid falling
to 0-4 in the Pac-1() when it hosts
Arizona on Saturday at noon.
The Wildcats defeated Cal 87-67
last night at Haas Pavilion to extend
their winning streak to nine games.
Stanford swept the series last season,
including a dramatic 80Â»-77 win on
Nick Robinson's 35-foot buzzer
beating heave at Maples Pavilion.
Both of Arizona's losses this sea
son have come to ACC opponents.
Virginia downed the Wildcats 78-60
in Charlottesville on Nov. 21, and
Lute Olson's squad dropped a hard-

Prowitt puts in career
performance for Card

fought 63-60 decision against Wake
Forest in the Preseason NIT. final
five days later.
Shooting guard Salim
Stoudamire leads three Wildcats av
eraging in double figures; with 14.8
points per game. The senior was sus
pended from the team for one week
earlier this season after he moped at
the end of a win over Utah in which
he was held scoreless.
The Wildcats were held to their
lowest scoring output of the season
in the only game Stoudamire missed
during the suspension, a 48-43 win at
Marquette, but he has remained out
of Olson's doghouse and been
steady since his return to the lineup.
With Stoudamire anchoring Ari
zona's strong perimeter game, se
nior center Channing Frye provides
steady production inside. The All-
American candidate scored a game
high 20 points against Cal and is av
eraging 13.5 and 8.3 rebounds per
game. Junior swingman Hassan
Adams, one of the most electrifying
players in the nation, is averaging
11.5 points per game.
"Arizona's going to push the
ball," said Arizona State head coach
Rob Evans, whose team lost 97-79 to
the Wildcats in their Pac-10 opener.
"They get a lot of transition baskets
and they try to catch you on your
heels. They're a pretty good defen-

sive ballclub this season, and they're
going to try to get out in transition by
using pressure."
Forget last season's Instant Clas
sic; Saturday's game could be an in
stant blowout if Stanford doesn't
shore up its transition defense
against the Wildcats.
"Arizona's a great basketball
team." Robinson said. "It's going to
take a lot of hard work and great de
fense to beat them.
Reserve Prowitt impresses
After playing just four total min
utes in the Cardinal's first two Pac
-10 games, freshman Peter Prowitt
played 13 last night and responded
with one of the best performances of
his career. Facing the unenviable
task of going against Arizona State's
Ail-American candidate Ike Diogu,
the Arlington. Va., native held his
own on the defensive end and also
chipped in six points, including a
pretty jump-hook in the lane, on 2-
for-4 shooting.
"I was very pleased to see him
play as well as he did," said Johnson,
who will look more to both Prowitt
and fellow freshman Taj Finger to
spell Rob Little and Matt Haryasz
off the bench in the wake of Evan
Moore's decision to concentrate
solelv on football.
