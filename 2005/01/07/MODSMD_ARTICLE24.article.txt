# No. 8 STANFORD vs. No. 24 ARIZONA STATE
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
While certainly not as impressive as the Stan
ford women's basketball 32-2 home record over
the last three years. Arizona State's recent suc
cess at its Wells Fargo Arena could boost the
Sun Devils confidence and make a Stanford
road victory tough to get.
No. 24 Arizona State (11-2, 3-1 Pacific-10
Conference) looks to extend its 10-game home
win streak as it plays host to the No. 8 Cardinal
(11-2,3-1) tonight.
The Sun Devils' have won 23 of their last 25
home games as well, including a win against
UConn, but if Stanford's freshman star Candice
Wiggins and junior center Brooke Smith contin

ue playing hot, the Cardinal offense could get
past the Devils' touted defense.
Arizona State leads the conference not only
in scoring defense (49.9 points per game), but in
rebounding defense and three-point defense as
well.
Wiggins, a Pac-10 Freshman of the Year fa
vorite, leads Stanford in scoring with 15.3 points
per game. Brooke is second with 12.8.
Helping out on the Devils' side is junior for
ward Kristen Kovesdy, an offensive threat with
a Pac-10-leading 64.8 shooting percent from the
field. YoVanna Rosenthal is second on the team
with a 57.1 field goal percentage.
Stanford heads into tonight's 6:30 p.m.
matchup coming off a sweep of Washington and
Washington State last weekend.
