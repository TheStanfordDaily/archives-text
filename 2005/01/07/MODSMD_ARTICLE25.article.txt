# Injuries affect dual roster
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a series of disappointing results in
the last two open tournaments, the Stanford
wrestling team (1-1, 0-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) knows that it is time to perform up to its
expectations.
This new motivation to succeed has begun
to manifest itself in practice, and the Cardinal
hope the added work will pay dividends on
the mats against No. 5 Michigan. Harvard and
Air Force this Saturday during the Lone Star
Duals in Grand Prairie. Tex.
The task, however, is getting tougher as in
juries mount.
"Honestly, we aren't where I thought we d
be in terms of performance and results." said
head coach Steve Buddie. "I feel like we
should have placed more wrestlers in all of
our tournaments so far, and we should be 2-0
in dual meets. But what 1 have been extreme
ly pleased with is that our team feels the same
way. and they're doing everything that needs
to be done to get to where we should be. This
is the hardest-working group I've had the
privilege of coaching."
Training has been so intense recently that
it is starting to generate optimism on the

Farm. The coaching staff gladly highlights this
past week in the gym and sees it as a possible
indicator of future success.
"This has been the best week of practice in
my seven years at Stanford," Buddie said.
"Our team is just starting to click, and 1 think
this bodes well for us this weekend. We've
only had two dual meets so far. so just
wrestling again as a team will be exciting.
There is no magic formula in terms of prepar
ing strategically for the weekend. Our team
seems very ready for this competition."
If the team has started to gel. it's happen
ing at the right time as Stanford faces three
tough opponents. Each team provides a
unique measuring stick for different sections
of the program, such as recruiting, condition
ing and depth.
"Harvard and Stanford compete for the
same recruits each year, so we're very much
looking forward to that matchup," Buddie
said. "They have a few very talented athletes,
but I like the way we match up with them. Air
Force will always be incredibly well-condi
tioned. but I again like our head-to-head
matchups with them."
However, the most daunting task will be
against national force Michigan,
and Stanford knows it must exe
cute.
"Michigan is in the running fora
national title and is tough from top
to bottom," Buddie said. "Their
style is typical Big 10 wrestling:
takedowns, takedowns, takedowns.
As always, we stress that it doesn't
matter who is standing in front of
you. Good technique that is done
well and done hard will work on just
about anyone."
Injuries and substitutions could
play a major role at the duals. Stan
lord has suffered a rash of lingering
injuries, but none have been deter
mined as season-ending yet.
"I will be wearing a face mask,
which could obstruct my vision a
little," said junior 174-pounder
I mad Kharbush, who broke his
nose in December. "We're also

awaits in Lone Star

going without (sophomore] Im
pounder lan Bork, who hyper-ex
tended his elbow, and we have a
new starter in 133 pounder
|sophoniore| Juston Johnson."
The most significant absence
could be that of senior captain 157-
pound Matt Gentry. The defending
NCAA champion and current the
mat.com athlete of the week, has
been sick and will not wrestle in
Texas, according to Kharbush.
This puts his 57-match consecutive
win-streak on hold.
Gentry will be replaced with ju
nior Ray Blake.
Even with the bumps and bruis
es to key wrestlers, though, the
Cardinal are still confident.
"Our team is solid and deep."
said Kharbush. "Blake at 157 is no
slouch, and we're confident in all
the people stepping in. Our depth

keeps learning curves high and is
what makes both meets and prac
tices intense. We are comfortable
with our lineup."
One thing that could he in Stan
ford's favor is that the meet is at a
neutral venue where all teams must
travel long distances. The Cardinal
do not have another home meet
until Feb. 4 against Fresno State.
"It helps a lot because traveling
takes a toll on your wrestling," said
Kharbush. "It doesn't really matter
whether it's an hour or across the
country, if you're not on your home
mat you feel a bit sluggish. The neu
tral site can level the playing field."
The Cardinal are determined to
reach their expectations even with
the adversity and injuries they have
suffered, and this Saturday in
Texas provides a perfect opportu
nity for the team to prove itself.
