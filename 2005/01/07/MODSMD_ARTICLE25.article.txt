# Injuries affect dual roster

### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a series of disappointing results in
the last two open tournaments, the Stanford
wrestling team (1-1, 0-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) knows that it is time to perform up to its
expectations.
This new motivation to succeed has begun
to manifest itself in practice, and the Cardinal
hope the added work will pay dividends on
the mats against No. 5 Michigan. Harvard and
Air Force this Saturday during the Lone Star
Duals in Grand Prairie. Tex.
The task, however, is getting tougher as in
juries mount.
"Honestly, we aren't where I thought we d
be in terms of performance and results." said
head coach Steve Buddie. "I feel like we
should have placed more wrestlers in all of
our tournaments so far, and we should be 2-0
in dual meets. But what 1 have been extreme

way. and they're doing everything that needs
to be done to get to where we should be. This
is the hardest-working group I've had the
privilege of coaching."
Training has been so intense recently that
it is starting to generate optimism on the

Farm. The coaching staff gladly highlights this
past week in the gym and sees it as a possible
indicator of future success.
"This has been the best week of practice in
my seven years at Stanford," Buddie said.
"Our team is just starting to click, and 1 think
this bodes well for us this weekend. We've
only had two dual meets so far. so just
wrestling again as a team will be exciting.
There is no magic formula in terms of prepar
ing strategically for the weekend. Our team
seems very ready for this competition."
If the team has started to gel. it's happen
ing at the right time as Stanford faces three
tough opponents. Each team provides a
unique measuring stick for different sections
of the program, such as recruiting, condition
ing and depth.
"Harvard and Stanford compete for the
same recruits each year, so we're very much
looking forward to that matchup," Buddie
said. "They have a few very talented athletes,
but I like the way we match up with them. Air
Force will always be incredibly well-condi
tioned. but I again like our head-to-head
matchups with them."
However, the most daunting task will be
