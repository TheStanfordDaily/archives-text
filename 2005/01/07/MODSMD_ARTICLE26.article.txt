# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## Spencer counts down the top 10 sports moments of last year 
### 
I live in the past. It's just who I am. Fright
ened that I will never accomplish anything re
motely successful in my future, I look to my
past for self-confidence. 1 go to my high
school's basketball games, wear my old varsity
gear and berate my local paper. Hell, my
RSVP for my 25th Stanford Reunion is al-

ready in the mail.
I know, it's sad.
So before I turn my mind
to the new year, I need to take
time to reflect on the year
that brought us such quotes as
"I'm hunting for little Mexi
can girls" (Karl Malone to
Kobe Bryant's wife); "We're
all idiots here. We all have
fun. We all hug, kiss, grab.

whatever," (David Ortiz); and "We have a lot
of stars, just no one you've ever heard of."
(Terry Donahue, recently fired GM of the
49ers).
So here you go. 1 needed some time to re
flect on the top ten sports moments of 2004,
and this is what 1 came up with.
No. 10: New England Patriots
How many stats could you use here? The
win streak, the two Super Bowls, the Janet
Jackson breast... all extraordinary ... except
the breast. That was weird. However, watching
the face of a French "JANET!" fan change
from a look of jubilation to disgust was as sat
isfying as yelling "YOU'LL NEVER BE
THIN!" to Campus Drive joggers. In other
news. I am comfortable with the reality of my
eternal stay in hell.
But the Pats. Truly an extraordinary team
with no weaknesses. When you can go 14-2
with a wide receiver as your nickel back,
you've got a dynasty on your hands.
No. 9: Lance Armstrong / Livestrong
Even with a steroid cloud hanging over him.
Lance shrugged off the pressure to win his
sixth straight Tour De France. Couple this
with one of the top 10 sports commercials in
history (acoustic guitar, everyone chasing him,
you know, you cried when you saw it) and a
yellow wristband craze that I enjoyed, hated,
then enjoyed again, and this man has had a
banner year. Livestrong.
No. 8: Barry Bonds
In 2004. it became clear that you cannot say>
the name Barry Bonds without saying
"steroids" in the same sentence. Years from
now, we will look back at this moment as the-,
catalyst for change. No longer will the"I didn't
know what I was eating / using / sniffing / huff
ing" defense be allowed. For Barry Bonds to
not eat the post-game spread for fear of the
specific ingredients, to not sit in a clubhouse
chair for the delicate health of his back and to
take on a very specific workout program, it is a,
downright lie for him to say that he didn't
know what he was taking. If you believe that,!,
then you'd believe that Sammy Sosa forgot he
was using a corked bat.
No. 7: Ron Artest
I went to a Warriors/Nuggets game over the
break, and before tip-off, Calbert Cheaney
went to midcourt to thank all the fans for at-,
tending the game, wishing us all a pleasant hoi-
