# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## Spencer counts down the top 10 sports moments of last year 
### 
I live in the past. It's just who I am. Fright
ened that I will never accomplish anything re
motely successful in my future, I look to my
past for self-confidence. 1 go to my high
school's basketball games, wear my old varsity
gear and berate my local paper. Hell, my
RSVP for my 25th Stanford Reunion is al-

ready in the mail.
I know, it's sad.
So before I turn my mind
to the new year, I need to take
time to reflect on the year
that brought us such quotes as
"I'm hunting for little Mexi
can girls" (Karl Malone to
Kobe Bryant's wife); "We're
all idiots here. We all have
fun. We all hug, kiss, grab.

whatever," (David Ortiz); and "We have a lot
of stars, just no one you've ever heard of."
(Terry Donahue, recently fired GM of the
49ers).
So here you go. 1 needed some time to re
flect on the top ten sports moments of 2004,
and this is what 1 came up with.
No. 10: New England Patriots
How many stats could you use here? The
win streak, the two Super Bowls, the Janet
Jackson breast... all extraordinary ... except
the breast. That was weird. However, watching
the face of a French "JANET!" fan change
from a look of jubilation to disgust was as sat
isfying as yelling "YOU'LL NEVER BE
THIN!" to Campus Drive joggers. In other
news. I am comfortable with the reality of my
eternal stay in hell.
But the Pats. Truly an extraordinary team
with no weaknesses. When you can go 14-2
with a wide receiver as your nickel back,
you've got a dynasty on your hands.
No. 9: Lance Armstrong / Livestrong
Even with a steroid cloud hanging over him.
Lance shrugged off the pressure to win his
sixth straight Tour De France. Couple this
with one of the top 10 sports commercials in
history (acoustic guitar, everyone chasing him,
you know, you cried when you saw it) and a
yellow wristband craze that I enjoyed, hated,
then enjoyed again, and this man has had a
banner year. Livestrong.
No. 8: Barry Bonds
In 2004. it became clear that you cannot say>
the name Barry Bonds without saying
"steroids" in the same sentence. Years from
now, we will look back at this moment as the-,
catalyst for change. No longer will the"I didn't
know what I was eating / using / sniffing / huff
ing" defense be allowed. For Barry Bonds to
not eat the post-game spread for fear of the
specific ingredients, to not sit in a clubhouse
chair for the delicate health of his back and to
take on a very specific workout program, it is a,
downright lie for him to say that he didn't
know what he was taking. If you believe that,!,
then you'd believe that Sammy Sosa forgot he
was using a corked bat.
No. 7: Ron Artest
I went to a Warriors/Nuggets game over the
break, and before tip-off, Calbert Cheaney
went to midcourt to thank all the fans for at-,
tending the game, wishing us all a pleasant hoi-


Spencer Porter
iday season and New Year. He received a standing
ovation for the gesture, apparently a new NBA tactic
for making games a more family-friendly environment
after the worst brawl in at least 10 years. Basketball is
the new "American" sport, but it could be headed for
disaster if the league can t figure out a solution for the
Ron Artests amongst us.
No. 6: llalo 2 Debuts
There was a void in my life. It is now filled. 1 had no
idea how much I needed Southerners yelling at me to
use the rocket launcher to lock on to the Warthog so
that the blue team won't steal our flag, but with the
highly addictive Halo 2 arid XBOX Live. I can yell
"Get er done!" with the best of them.
In a slight demerit, my accented friends never cease
to use colorful language to explain my dimwitted ac
tions, saying in a variety of ways that I perform homo
sexual actions on a regular basis. This I could do without.
No. 5: Utah Football
Mid-majors baby. If you can go undefeated and still
have yokels not respecting you, it's time to eliminate
the yokels from the equation. This year there are three
national champions. Football games aren't decided on
votes. The rankings shouldn't be either.
No. 4: "Cool Story, Hansel"
"Thanks Olaf!" My Zoolander-inspired Kappa Sig
Intramural Football team lost in the semifinals, but my
quarterbacking skills and teammates' brilliant plays

Sometimes brain tops
brawn: Check No. 2

on all sides of the ball carried us to the best KE finish
in recent memory. 1 call our 46-0 defeat of Med School
students my greatest athletic achievement. My girl
friend calls it sad.
No 3: Stanford Basketball
Slightly edging my 1M football glory, the fantastic
season, ending with a disappointing loss to Alabama,
was a highlight for all Stanford students last year.
Comprising an undefeated streak, being No. 1 fora
while and the Arizona finish (not to mention Wash
ington State) —it was all fantastic. Not as fantastic
were the premature departures of Josh Childress and
Mike Montgomery.
No. 2: ken Jennings
What a glorious man. Seriously, this guy is incredi
ble. A likeable guy who went in to computer science
not because he liked it but because he knew he had to
support his family, this Mormon wonder reeled off
Jeopardy! victory after victory, amassing more than
$2.5 million after 74 wins. Look at the stats — he ques
tioned correctly 92 percent of the answers attempted
and had H7 percent of his games clinched before Final
Jeopardy!. Love that man.
No. 1: The Boston Red Sox

isfying as yelling "YOU'LL NEVER BE
THIN!" to Campus Drive joggers. In other
news. I am comfortable with the reality of my
eternal stay in hell.
But the Pats. Truly an extraordinary team
with no weaknesses. When you can go 14-2
with a wide receiver as your nickel back,
you've got a dynasty on your hands.
No. 9: Lance Armstrong / Livestrong
Even with a steroid cloud hanging over him.
Lance shrugged off the pressure to win his
sixth straight Tour De France. Couple this
with one of the top 10 sports commercials in
history (acoustic guitar, everyone chasing him,
you know, you cried when you saw it) and a
yellow wristband craze that I enjoyed, hated,
then enjoyed again, and this man has had a
banner year. Livestrong.
No. 8: Barry Bonds
In 2004. it became clear that you cannot say>
the name Barry Bonds without saying
"steroids" in the same sentence. Years from
now, we will look back at this moment as the-,
catalyst for change. No longer will the"I didn't
know what I was eating / using / sniffing / huff
ing" defense be allowed. For Barry Bonds to
not eat the post-game spread for fear of the
specific ingredients, to not sit in a clubhouse
chair for the delicate health of his back and to
take on a very specific workout program, it is a,
downright lie for him to say that he didn't
know what he was taking. If you believe that,!,
then you'd believe that Sammy Sosa forgot he
was using a corked bat.
No. 7: Ron Artest
I went to a Warriors/Nuggets game over the
break, and before tip-off, Calbert Cheaney
went to midcourt to thank all the fans for at-,
tending the game, wishing us all a pleasant hoi-


Spencer Porter
iday season and New Year. He received a standing
ovation for the gesture, apparently a new NBA tactic
for making games a more family-friendly environment
after the worst brawl in at least 10 years. Basketball is
the new "American" sport, but it could be headed for
disaster if the league can t figure out a solution for the
Ron Artests amongst us.
No. 6: llalo 2 Debuts
There was a void in my life. It is now filled. 1 had no
idea how much I needed Southerners yelling at me to
use the rocket launcher to lock on to the Warthog so
that the blue team won't steal our flag, but with the
highly addictive Halo 2 arid XBOX Live. I can yell
"Get er done!" with the best of them.
In a slight demerit, my accented friends never cease
to use colorful language to explain my dimwitted ac
tions, saying in a variety of ways that I perform homo
sexual actions on a regular basis. This I could do without.
No. 5: Utah Football
Mid-majors baby. If you can go undefeated and still
have yokels not respecting you, it's time to eliminate
the yokels from the equation. This year there are three
national champions. Football games aren't decided on
votes. The rankings shouldn't be either.
No. 4: "Cool Story, Hansel"
"Thanks Olaf!" My Zoolander-inspired Kappa Sig
Intramural Football team lost in the semifinals, but my
quarterbacking skills and teammates' brilliant plays

Sometimes brain tops
brawn: Check No. 2

on all sides of the ball carried us to the best KE finish
in recent memory. 1 call our 46-0 defeat of Med School
students my greatest athletic achievement. My girl
friend calls it sad.
No 3: Stanford Basketball
Slightly edging my 1M football glory, the fantastic
season, ending with a disappointing loss to Alabama,
was a highlight for all Stanford students last year.
Comprising an undefeated streak, being No. 1 fora
while and the Arizona finish (not to mention Wash
ington State) —it was all fantastic. Not as fantastic
were the premature departures of Josh Childress and
Mike Montgomery.
No. 2: ken Jennings
What a glorious man. Seriously, this guy is incredi
ble. A likeable guy who went in to computer science
not because he liked it but because he knew he had to
support his family, this Mormon wonder reeled off
Jeopardy! victory after victory, amassing more than
$2.5 million after 74 wins. Look at the stats — he ques
tioned correctly 92 percent of the answers attempted
and had H7 percent of his games clinched before Final
Jeopardy!. Love that man.
No. 1: The Boston Red Sox
Believe.

Spencer Porter, a senior, is his own favorite sports mo
ment. E-mail him at porters@stanford.edu.
I live in the past. It's just who I am. Fright
ened that I will never accomplish anything re
motely successful in my future, I look to my
past for self-confidence. 1 go to my high
school's basketball games, wear my old varsity
gear and berate my local paper. Hell, my
RSVP for my 25th Stanford Reunion is al-

ready in the mail.
I know, it's sad.
So before I turn my mind
to the new year, I need to take
time to reflect on the year
that brought us such quotes as
"I'm hunting for little Mexi
can girls" (Karl Malone to
Kobe Bryant's wife); "We're
all idiots here. We all have
fun. We all hug, kiss, grab.

whatever," (David Ortiz); and "We have a lot
of stars, just no one you've ever heard of."
(Terry Donahue, recently fired GM of the
49ers).
So here you go. 1 needed some time to re
flect on the top ten sports moments of 2004,
and this is what 1 came up with.
No. 10: New England Patriots
How many stats could you use here? The
win streak, the two Super Bowls, the Janet
Jackson breast... all extraordinary ... except
the breast. That was weird. However, watching
the face of a French "JANET!" fan change
from a look of jubilation to disgust was as sat
isfying as yelling "YOU'LL NEVER BE
THIN!" to Campus Drive joggers. In other
news. I am comfortable with the reality of my
