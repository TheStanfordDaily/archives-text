# Dartmouth welcomes Teevens a second time
## 
### 
They say you can't go home again,
but former Stanford football coach
Buddy Teevens has proven that old
adage wrong. Teevens was introduced
Wednesday afternoon as the new head
coach at his alma mater. Dartmouth
College, where he was the head of the
football program from 1987-92.
The announcement came five weeks
after the Dartmouth athletic department
fired head coach John Lyons, who spent
13 years at the helm of the Big Green
program as Teevens' successor. Lyons
led Dartmouth to two Ivy League
Championships and one undefeated sea
son. but his 16-53 record since 1998 sheds
some light on the reason for his release.
Lyons was 60-68-1 overall as the Big
Green head coach, and 1-9 in his final
season with the team.
Teevens' familiarity with the Dart
mouth football program and the col
lege's community seems to be one of
the key factors in the athletic depart
ment's hiring decision.
In addition to his Big Green coach

ing experience — which includes two
league titles and a 26-22-2 record —
Teevens was a two-sport athlete dur
ing his time Dartmouth. His father,
brother and sister also all attended the
college and participated in the varsity
sports program.
"Everyone says that timing in life is
everything," Dartmouth Athletic Di
rector Josie Harper said in a press re
lease. "The time is perfect for Buddy to
return to Hanover to combine two of
his passions — his expertise and knowl
edge in the game of football and his love
for Dartmouth College."
Big Green football players, alumni
and administrators have all expressed
approval at re-hiring of the well-liked,
universally respected Teevens.
None of the remarks made at
Wednesday's press conference indicated
concern about the 10-23 record that
Teevens compiled in the past three years
at Stanford, or his 60-99-2 overall record
in 15 years as a head football coach.
