In a statement prepared late

"After traveling to Thailand to
search for James, it is clear to us that
he has passed away. He was outgo
ing and introspective, athletic and
intelligent, bold and sensitive. We
are comforted by the wonderful
memories that he left us and the
hundreds if not thousands of lives
that he touched.
"We have been told over and
over that he had a gift for business.

a gift for sports, a gift for so many
things, but to us James was a gift,
our greatest gift. And for that we
consider ourselves very lucky."
Hsu, a Merced, Calif, native,
graduated from UC-Berkeley with
a degree in political science. He was
a second-year MBA student at
Stanford and an active member of
several GSB student groups, serv
ing as the co-financial officer of the
Stanford Business School Student
Association.
His family also urged the public to
remember the magnitude of the
tsunamis' destruction.
"As we mourn him, it is vital to
consider the scope of the tragedy
that took him from us," the family's
statement said. "Our hearts and
prayers are with the families and
friends throughout the world who
have lost loved ones in the tsunami.
We hope that James' life will spur
all of us to take action and to con
tribute to the effort to help those

who have survived, not just in the
immediate aftermath, but also
throughout the long, long road to
recovery."
Six of Hsu's Business School
classmates launched a $50,000 Red
Cross campaign in his honor shortly
after the Dec. 26 tsunamis struck
Koh Phi Phi, the island where he
and four other GSB students were
vacationing after meeting business
leaders in Singapore and Thailand
on a school study trip.
A vigil for all the victims of the
tsunami was held at Memorial
