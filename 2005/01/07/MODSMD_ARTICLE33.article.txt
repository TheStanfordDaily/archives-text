Top Five (Times Two)
Hottest Daily Staffers
(in no particular order)
1) Brendan Selby — He's been de
scribed as a "frat bo/' — a tribute to
his swimmer's physique, chiseled
good looks and surgically-attached
backwards Cubs hat. The brains
under that cap are nothing to sneeze
at either: This stud briefly declared
honors in the humanities major in
order to take an upper-level class
about the obscure French philoso
pher Montaigne. Sacre bleu!
2) Sarah Lustbader — This native
New Yorker's jaw dropping looks are
surpassed only by her biting social
commentary, frat boy liver and ample,
uh, brains. Those in the know can find
her slumming in Alphabet City's finest
dive bars. A, B, C, DD!
3) David Herbert — The shaggy hair,
a closet full of Brooks Brothers polo
shirts, his left-wing extremism, a pen
chant for Corona and a love of squash.
He is a sea of contradictions. One thing
can't be disputed, however—he is
one devilishly handsome fellow. Some
call him "thin." This author prefers "cut
from marble." Take your pick.
4) Mia Ashton — This blond bomb
shell may hail from North Carolina,
but don't let her Red-State, private
school pedigree fool you. Mia will shut
you out in Beirut, finish your beers for
you and still look sizzling in high heels
and a miniskirt.
5) Will Oremus— If power is an
aphrodisiac, Will is sitting pretty. As
the editor-in-chief of The Daily, he
commands the respect of a staff of
over 50 editors and writers, all the
while exuding an irresistible Midwest
ern charm. His six-foot frame,
sparkling blue eyes and boyish smile
don't hurt either. Look for him getting
ripped on the beach with honorable
mention Eric Eldon.

6) Jennie Kim — Words cannot ade
quately describe this vixen, but let me
attempt it. No offense to other Daily
staffers, but Jennie is a flower that
grew out of a pot of dirt. Her smile
melts glaciers. Her laugh makes an
gels cry with joy. She was not bom;
she emerged from a seashell to the
ringing of silver trumpets. Eat it, Helen.
7) Anthony Ha — Anthony defies
expectations both in and out of his
clothes. Poorly dressed and
groomed, he actually made a small
fortune selling videos from the Stan
ford Police Department evidence
room, including Exotic Erotic footage
and the infamous Crothers Memorial
sex tapes. His small frame also belies
the powerful thrusting ability of his
thighs and buttocks. Plus, he can be
checked into the overhead compart
ment on most flights.
B)Tam Vo — Mau mau! There's no
cure for yellow fever, but Tam may be
the next best thing. She's a tight little
package with an adorable bob haircut
and awesome taste in music. Play
your cards right and she may give you
one of her amazing massages. Sorry,
no happy ending.
9) Jules the Penguin — Perennial
candidate for editor-in-chief, Jules is a
hardened veteran of newsroom. He's
soft and cuddly, but also a tireless ad
vocate for the poor, downtrodden and
Mikey Lee. He can also boast that
he's slept with both Will Oremus and
Brendan Marten. Downside? He also
slept with Ramin.
10) Camille Ricketts — Camille re
cently returned from DC" with jet
black hair, red, white and blue braces
and a libido in overdrive. Since she
was placed in Terra upon her return,
Camille can usually be found prowl
ing around campus moving in on un
suspecting freshmen and the elderly.
God bless America!

Top Five Most Intriguingly
Bad Movies
1) The Passion of the Christ
As a former altar boy, longtime
Catholic student and a great scholar of
the Good Book (I brought my Picture
Bible to church every Sunday — Old
Testament Trivia match, anytime, any
where), I could spend an entire five
episode PBS miniseries on the severe
wrong-headedness of Mel Gibson's
bloody, vindictive,loveless vision of
Jesus Christ (who mostly resembles an
extra from "Dawn ofthe Dead") and the
rank stupidity of the film's simplistic por
trayal of the Pharisees (and all those
howling Hebrew crowds). But instead, I
am instead going to praise Mr. Gibson for
making the most disturbingly violent
movie of all time and selling it as a family
movie. Now, whenever a Christian-Coali
tion media watchdog like Jerry Falwell
complains about all the violence in Holly
wood, yuppie liberals like me can recall
about the 10-minute "Scourging" scene,
where Jesus's skin is torn off by whips.
And then we'll laugh, and laugh ...
2) Finding Neverland
The worst sort of bad movie: the Oscar
bait. Johnny Depp (devoid of the comic
zest he showed off in "Pirates of the
Caribbean") is a blandly bland playwright
who plays make-believe with angelic kids
and falls in chaste love with Kate Winslet
(missing the lively wit she showed off in
"Eternal Sunshine ..."). Oh, and he writes
"Peter Pan," though the movie explains
away the more intriguing aspects of the
writing process with lame inner-child pop
psychology. "Spider-Man 2" covered the
same territory with more wit and less cute
ness than this reprehensible muck.
3) The Village
"The Village" possesses such an ele
gant sense of pacing and such keen visual
wit that I almost left the theater wishing it
was a better movie. "But then," I realized, "I
wouldn't have laughed so much." Like any
good camp classic, "The Village" takes it

self utterly seriously: The actors deliver the
bad dialogue with such hushed wonder
and do such a good job of being frightened
by the forest monsters (who look like Por
cupine Muppets) that the film reveals itself
as the (unintentional) comedy hit of the
summer. The final twist belongs on a VHI
Awesomely Bad list, in the no. 1 spot.
4) Ocean's 12
One imagines George Clooney going to
every member of the cast and selling them
on it: Hey guys, remember how much fun
we had with the first one? Well, let's do the
same thing, except this time, we won't
even bother with the acting thing! AND
WE'LL GO TO EUROPE! Yet what this
charmless sequel to the jazzyily cool
"Ocean's 11" lacks in coherent plotting,
depth of character and genuine excite
ment, it makes up for in pure bizarro-Hol
lywood spectacle. Rare is it fora movie
to feature more than a couple of big
stars; rarer still does a movie boasting
several Hollywood gods and goddesses
look and feel like a low-budget French
Film from the mid-60s. Yet from its jittery
hand-held camera to its neo-grunge
color scheme to its meta-metaphysical
third act twist, the movie comes off
likethe feverish Hollywood dream of a
first-year film student.
5) Team America: World Police
The second film from the "South Park"
team, a goof on American superpatriot jin
goism, terrorism and Jerry Bruckheimer
flicks, was easily the most disappointing
movie of the political year. A few funny bits
(especially the Team America theme song,
with such lyrics as "America — FUCK
YEAH!") couldn't quite disguise the film's
perpetual dullness. Roughly half the movie
is predicated on the idea that watching
wooden marionettes do people things is
funny (example: "Look at that puppet walk!
Look at that puppet drink!"); the other half
makes a vague stab at satire. Unfortunate
ly, a single panel of "Doonesbury" has
more wit than this political doodle. So much
promise, so little follow-through.
