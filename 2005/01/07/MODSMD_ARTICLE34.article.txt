## THE 						LIFE AQUATIC with STEVE ZISSOU A 						swashbucklin' good time OR I'd rather walk the plank 
### CHRIS CHAN INTERMISSION DEEP SEA DIVER CHRIS CHAN INTERMISSION DEEP SEA DIVER 
You know that part in movie commercials when the voiceover goes "The critics are unanimous"? "The life Aquatic with Steve Zis
sou," starring Bill Murray as an over-the-hill filmmaking oceanographer, is most definitely not one of those movies. Checking in at a
mediocre 47 percent on rottentomatoes.com (the lowest rating of all four Wes Anderson films), the critics are confounded. Some love it
like their firstborn child, while others trash it like those AOL 9.0 Optimized CDs (Who the hell uses those things anyway?).
Anyway, if the folks who do this fora living come to a consensus, then I better play it safe and write two reviews. I'll leave it to you to
figure out which category you fall into.'..

"Charming" is the word that best characterizes "The Life
Aquatic with Steve Zissou." Although there isn't one particular
element that wows, eveiy thing put together, from the intricate and
vivid sets to the eccentric and colorful characters, makes Wes An
derson's fourth film a thoroughly enjoyable adventure.
When I say adventure. 1 don't mean a let's-find-secret-trea
sure-from-a-map-hidden-on-the-back-of-the-Declaration-of-ln-
dependetice adventure. I mean a filmmaking adventure; Ander
son's work constantly explores new territory.
The humor, even quirkier than that of "Rushniore" or "The
Royal Tenenbaums," pervades every scene. Anderson has a
knack for making blood-gushing violence absolutely hilarious.
When an unpaid intern on Zissou's ship gets his shoulder hacked
by a ragtag band of Filipino pirates (no joke), I laughed so hard
that milk squirted out my nose (had 1 been drinking milk). More
importantly, the humor in this movie is not only found in particu
lar events, but also in the general atmosphere Anderson creates.
How is the presence of a three-legged dog funny? I have no idea,
but somehow Anderson makes it so (and I'm probably going to
hell for laughing at the plight of an animal less fortunate than I).
The well-crafted characters each add to the uniqueness of Life
Aquatic. Willem Dafoe's turn as insecure, effeminate German
sailor Klaus Daimler reminds us that the French people don't have
a monopoly on easily maligned European nationalities. Jeff Gold
blum's portrayal of a wealthy closet homosexual makes me wish
he were the sixth cast member of "Oueer Eye For The Straight
Guy." Throw in the solid performances by Owen Wilson, Cate
Blanchett. Angelica Huston and Bill Murray, and you have an
amazing ensemble cast, all of whom know how to liven the show
without stealing it.
Although "Life Aquatic" in its entirety is not terribly coherent,
the individual scenes are so amusing and joyful to experience that

you'll never find your
self checking your
watch for the time or
dozing off during
painfully slow scenes
(as I did during "Clos
er"). One can only
hope that Anderson
will continue reaching
new depihs in future
films.

"Meandering" is the word that best characterizes "The Life
Aquatic with Steve Zissou." Although the promotional poster (a
shot of the entire cast in a yellow submarine staring intently at some
thing in the distance) implies some sort of goal or final destination,
you soon realize that the movie itself is headed nowhere.,
This realization doesn't occur immediately. Anderson initially
fools you into believing that "Life Aquatic" is about a Melville-ish
quest for revenge (Zissou vows to hunt the elusive jaguar shark that
ate his partner Esteban). As the movie "progresses," however, it is
sidetracked by so many irrelevant subplots that it loses any sense of
direction.
"Life Aquatic" has the ingredients ot typical movies you've seen

before: A father tries to
forge a relationship
with his son. a washed
out celebrity attempts
to find meaning in his
life and a love triangle
threatens a team's sta
bility. But just when
you expect Anderson

to do something unconventional
with these hackneyed plots (as he
brilliantly does in his previous films)
— he falls completely short. Two
painstaking hours pass and you real
ize that Disney has financed Ander
son with an ungodly 50 million to
commit the filmmaking equivalent of
masturbation.
Although "Life Aquatic" has its
moments, the film as a whole has the
excitement of a PBS documentary.
One can only hope that this movie
was a fluke and that his next works
will demonstrate the originality and
character of "Rushmore," "The
Royal Tenenbaums" or "Bottle
Rocket." But hey, regardless of
which side you fall on, I hope you find
this joke funny:
Q: Did you hear about the latest pi
rate movie?
A: It's rated Rrrrrrrrrr.
No, seriously. For language, some
drug use, violence and partial nudity.

Top Five Best And Worst of
Stanford Men's Fashion
1) Best: The Popped Collar
It just... 100k5... really good. One
cannot help it. Admit defeat.
Worst: The Popped Collar
Why? Who came up with this stupid
idea in the first place? It's a plague, but
like any good plague, it cannot be
avoided.
2) Best: A unique hairstyle
Expressing yourself is what life's all
about. That is unless you have some
really smelly dreads. Then, please, be
conventional.
Worst: The faux hawk
Be man enough for the real thing.
Your hairdo is an affront to everything
punk rock stands for. I hope Henry
Rollins strangles you.
3) Best: Thrift store clothes
One) you'll look interesting and "out
there" Two) you'll have enough money
left to eat like a king, and even when
you get fat, you can still buy more thrift
clothes.
Worst: Wearing five or more layers
It is not healthy to wear four t-shirts.
Your skin will start to fester from the lack
of oxygen. And you'll look like an idiot.
4) Best: Vintage Stanford gear
Get a unique piece of collegiate wear
after you are out of internal organs to
sell in order to buy from the Stanford
Store.
Worst: Sporting an overpriced Stan
ford hoodie on campus
We all know you go to Stanford. Take
it off and find a more interesting identity.
5) Best: Geeky free giveaway T-shirt
Geek chic is all the rage in the twen
ty-first century. Self-confidence doesn't
need a brand name.
Worst: The Von Dutch virus
You deserve to be hit by a truck if you
wear these hats.

masturbation.
Although "Life Aquatic" has its
moments, the film as a whole has the
excitement of a PBS documentary.
One can only hope that this movie
was a fluke and that his next works
will demonstrate the originality and
character of "Rushmore," "The
Royal Tenenbaums" or "Bottle
Rocket." But hey, regardless of
which side you fall on, I hope you find
this joke funny:
Q: Did you hear about the latest pi
rate movie?
A: It's rated Rrrrrrrrrr.
No, seriously. For language, some

Top Five Best And Worst of
Stanford Men's Fashion
1) Best: The Popped Collar
It just... 100k5... really good. One
cannot help it. Admit defeat.
Worst: The Popped Collar
Why? Who came up with this stupid
idea in the first place? It's a plague, but
like any good plague, it cannot be
avoided.
2) Best: A unique hairstyle
Expressing yourself is what life's all
about. That is unless you have some
really smelly dreads. Then, please, be
conventional.
Worst: The faux hawk
Be man enough for the real thing.
Your hairdo is an affront to everything
punk rock stands for. I hope Henry
Rollins strangles you.
3) Best: Thrift store clothes
One) you'll look interesting and "out
there" Two) you'll have enough money
left to eat like a king, and even when
you get fat, you can still buy more thrift
clothes.
Worst: Wearing five or more layers
It is not healthy to wear four t-shirts.
Your skin will start to fester from the lack
of oxygen. And you'll look like an idiot.
4) Best: Vintage Stanford gear
Get a unique piece of collegiate wear
after you are out of internal organs to
sell in order to buy from the Stanford
Store.
Worst: Sporting an overpriced Stan
ford hoodie on campus
We all know you go to Stanford. Take
it off and find a more interesting identity.
5) Best: Geeky free giveaway T-shirt
Geek chic is all the rage in the twen
ty-first century. Self-confidence doesn't
need a brand name.
Worst: The Von Dutch virus
You deserve to be hit by a truck if you
wear these hats.

You know that part in movie commercials when the voiceover goes "The critics are unanimous"? "The life Aquatic with Steve Zis
sou," starring Bill Murray as an over-the-hill filmmaking oceanographer, is most definitely not one of those movies. Checking in at a
mediocre 47 percent on rottentomatoes.com (the lowest rating of all four Wes Anderson films), the critics are confounded. Some love it
like their firstborn child, while others trash it like those AOL 9.0 Optimized CDs (Who the hell uses those things anyway?).
Anyway, if the folks who do this fora living come to a consensus, then I better play it safe and write two reviews. I'll leave it to you to
figure out which category you fall into.'..

"Charming" is the word that best characterizes "The Life
Aquatic with Steve Zissou." Although there isn't one particular
element that wows, eveiy thing put together, from the intricate and
vivid sets to the eccentric and colorful characters, makes Wes An
derson's fourth film a thoroughly enjoyable adventure.
When I say adventure. 1 don't mean a let's-find-secret-trea
sure-from-a-map-hidden-on-the-back-of-the-Declaration-of-ln-
dependetice adventure. I mean a filmmaking adventure; Ander
son's work constantly explores new territory.
The humor, even quirkier than that of "Rushniore" or "The
Royal Tenenbaums," pervades every scene. Anderson has a
knack for making blood-gushing violence absolutely hilarious.
When an unpaid intern on Zissou's ship gets his shoulder hacked
by a ragtag band of Filipino pirates (no joke), I laughed so hard
that milk squirted out my nose (had 1 been drinking milk). More
importantly, the humor in this movie is not only found in particu
lar events, but also in the general atmosphere Anderson creates.
How is the presence of a three-legged dog funny? I have no idea,
but somehow Anderson makes it so (and I'm probably going to
hell for laughing at the plight of an animal less fortunate than I).
The well-crafted characters each add to the uniqueness of Life
Aquatic. Willem Dafoe's turn as insecure, effeminate German
sailor Klaus Daimler reminds us that the French people don't have
a monopoly on easily maligned European nationalities. Jeff Gold
blum's portrayal of a wealthy closet homosexual makes me wish
he were the sixth cast member of "Oueer Eye For The Straight
Guy." Throw in the solid performances by Owen Wilson, Cate
Blanchett. Angelica Huston and Bill Murray, and you have an
amazing ensemble cast, all of whom know how to liven the show
without stealing it.
Although "Life Aquatic" in its entirety is not terribly coherent,
the individual scenes are so amusing and joyful to experience that

you'll never find your
self checking your
watch for the time or
dozing off during
painfully slow scenes
(as I did during "Clos
er"). One can only
hope that Anderson
will continue reaching
new depihs in future
films.

"Meandering" is the word that best characterizes "The Life
Aquatic with Steve Zissou." Although the promotional poster (a
shot of the entire cast in a yellow submarine staring intently at some
thing in the distance) implies some sort of goal or final destination,
you soon realize that the movie itself is headed nowhere.,
This realization doesn't occur immediately. Anderson initially
fools you into believing that "Life Aquatic" is about a Melville-ish
quest for revenge (Zissou vows to hunt the elusive jaguar shark that
ate his partner Esteban). As the movie "progresses," however, it is
sidetracked by so many irrelevant subplots that it loses any sense of
direction.
"Life Aquatic" has the ingredients ot typical movies you've seen

before: A father tries to
forge a relationship
with his son. a washed
out celebrity attempts
to find meaning in his
life and a love triangle
threatens a team's sta
bility. But just when
