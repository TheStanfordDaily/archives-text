## 
### 
Top Five of Dance
1) Movin' Out
The Broadway hit musical choreographed
by Twyla Tharp and danced to the songs of
Billy Joel. Great music and upbeat dancing
make this Vietnam War-era story of love and
friendship one not to miss. I can safely place it
at no. 1 after seeing it in New York, San Diego,
San Francisco and Sacramento.
2) Robert Moses Kin
One of the Bay Area community's most in
fluential companies; utilizes dance as a way to
unify people across race, class, culture and
gender. The company tours nationally and col
laborates with other performing arts groups
such as Youth Speaks poetry group. Robert
Moses is also a Stanford faculty member.
3) Laurel Keen and Brett Conway
Dancers with Alonzo King's LINES Ballet,
they performed the best duet of 2004. Closing
King's ballet, "Who Dressed You Like a For
eigner?" Keen and Conway were enchantingly
Top Five Fashion Trends that Cause our
Eyes to Twitch Uncontrollably
1) F'Ugg-lies
Maybe you went the cheap route and bought
| Emus or other knockoffs, but they all make us want
to gouge our eyes out. Someone once described
wearing Uggs as "swaddling yourfeet in the remains
of the softest teddy bears" — that's just sick. The
Uggs and miniskirt combo was bad enough This
winter, please restrain yourself from tucking your
leans into these hideous excuses for shoes.
2) Velour Tracksuits
Why won't this trend from 2003 just die al
ready? Just because "Juicy" is stamped on your
ass doesn't mean looking like a roll of '70s-era
carpet is attractive. Sure, Summer and Julie
Cooper were seen in them on the first season of
"The 0.C," but look at all the middle schoolers
and suburban soccer moms wearing them —
even your grandma powerwalks at the mall in
one of these getups.
•
3) "The Skirt"
Infamous enough to get its own name, übiqui
tous enough to make you look like everyone else.

serene and honest in a dance that portrayed
the dynamic relationship ot nature and human
ity. They left the audience breathless.
4) Mark Morris
Musical genius of modem dance. Morris'
company presented his inventive, witty and
complex but harmonious choreography at UC-
Berkeley. Also this year, San Francisco Ballet
premiered his successful full-length ballet,
"Sylvia."
5) Suzanne Farrell
A dance educator and a legendary balleri
na during the 19605, 70s and '80s, Farrell
continues the legacy of the greatest choreog
rapher of the 20th Century, George Balan
chine. By restaging ballets for her own com
pany, The Suzanne Farrell Ballet, and by pro
fessing her knowledge to students at Florida
State University, The John F. Kennedy Cen
ter for the Performing Arts and across the
world, Farrell is ensuring a beautiful future for
ballet.
EMILY HITE

You know the one I'm talk
ing about — plain, striped
or patterned, ruffled, wide
waistband, stretchy, usu
ally made from cheap cot
ton and lycra, with an ex
tremely short skirt. Now
available in preppier mate
rials like tweed and cor
duroy at Abersnobbie and
Bitch.
4) Paris Hilton
Technically not an item
of clothing, but she's been
worn by quite a few men,
as seen in the infamous
sex tapes. "Stupid Spoiled
Whore" (as seen on a re
cent episode of South
Park) wouldn't be a bad

name for her upcoming fashion line, since she
makes J. Lo look like a nun.
5) Von Dutch
I don't think I have to justify myself here.

Top Five Electronic Toys
I)TheiPod Family
(http://www.apple.com/lpod/ — Starting at
$249.99)
The no. 1 most-wanted electronic gadget for
two years in a row, the iPod just continues to
create an extreme amount of demand with its
extremely easy to use interface, stylish design,
huge amount of storage space and now ex
tended battery life and a beautiful color screen
with the iPod Photo. Plus, you know those
white headphones are just damn cool.
2) Nintendo DS
(http://www.nintendo.com/systemsds —
$149.99)
Nintendo's newest foray into the portable gam
ing market brings two innovative features to the
handheld world: a dual screen setup allowing
gaming never before dreamed of, and a touch
screen fora crazy gaming experience. A built-in
mic, wireless networking with other DSs, and

the ability to play older Game Boy Advance games makes this
one a winner.
3) Bose Companion 3 Multimedia Speaker System
(http://www.bose.com — $249.00)
If you're looking for a set of small speakers that deliver
amazing sound with a sub that packs amazing power for its
size, then look no further then this Bose computer speaker set.
These are definitely the best speakers you can buy for a rela
tively cheap price. Prepare to be wowed, whether you're lis
tening to the latest rap crap or engrossed in the newest com
puter game.
4) Roomba (http://www.irobot.com/consumer/ — Starting at
$149.99)
For the student who just can't get up to vacuum those five
square feet of floor space, Roomba is a robotic vacuum cleaner
that'll run around and clean it all up for you. Throw it on your hung
over roommate and watch the dirt magically disappear. Just don't
expect it to take out all those beer bottles though.
5) X-Box Live (http://www.xbox.com — $69.99 for Starter kit
and a year subscription)
Not the newest kid on the block, but Live really took off this
year with great games such as Guilty Gear and, of course, Halo
2. If you're looking for a great way to find some competition on
line, check out this little piece of software. It doesn't hurt that it
also includes a headset for some trash-talking.

Top Five Movie Moments of 2004
1) Joel's last memory being wiped in "Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind" — So maybe there's enough mo
ments in the movie to fill this entire list, but the killer
comes near the end, as Joel's final (and earliest) memo
ry of Clementine in a deserted beach house literally
comes crashing down around them. "Meet me in Mon
tauk," Clementine whispers into his ear just before dis
appearing into a haze. I'm so there.
2) The battle of bamboo in "House of Flying Daggers" —
In a deliriously beautiful film overstuffed with visuals, the
biggest stunner is a sequence set in a bamboo forest,
with an army of limber soldiers leaping across tree trunks
while a hailstorm of bamboo spears soar through the air.
As "Hero" also showed us, director Zhang Yimou is a lim
itless fountain of breathtaking moments.
3) The opening scene of "Closer" — It's a tough year
when this sequence has to settle for third. Two gorgeous
people (Jude Law and Natalie Portman) cross paths in a
crowd, ogling each other in slo-mo; lay on that aching
Damien Rice track and you've got an audience in pud
dles beneath their seats, completely unprepared for the
startling mayhem about to follow.
4) The highway chase scene in "Love Me if You Dare" —
Jilted lover Julien goes barreling down a highway at top
speed, joyously alive now that he and his one true love
are playing their deadly game again. As he hurtles to
ward certain death he rattles off all the beautiful things in
life that pale in comparison, and in so doing forces us to
take stock in all things beautiful too.
5) Harry summons the patronus light in "Harry Potter and
the Prisoner of Azkaban" — I'll freely admit that I haven't
read the books, but for me this movie franchise and its
story arcs are unfolding at perfect pace. When Harry
summons the spirit of his dead father to ward off those
swarming dementors and John Williams's celestial
music kicks in, I cry like a baby. A very quiet, happy baby.
Honorable mentions) Large listening to The Shins on
Sam's headphones in "Garden State"; the use of "Rain
drops Keep Fallin' on my Head" in "Spider-man 2"; the
end credit sequence of "The Life Aquatic" set to Bowie's
"Queen Bitch"; Howard Hughes filming his war epic from
a plane in"The Aviator"; that psycho twist midway;
through "The Village"; The Bride's training sequence
with Pai Mei in "Kill Bill 2."

Top Five Films of 2004
I)" Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind"
Far and away this year's most
thought-provoking and heartwrenching
film, proving screenwriter Charlie Kauf
mann has a soul in addition to that gift
for the madcap. Spot-on performances
by the gorgeous leads (even Kirsten
Dunst is appealing) and Michel
Gondry's game direction make it pure
perfection.
2)" Napoleon Dynamite" and
"Primer"

I know, I
know, it's

cheating to put down two here, but these Sun
dance favorites both owe their success to
stunning originality and fantastic word of
mouth. One is a screwball comedy set in
Idaho, the other is a sly mindtrap of low-tech
sci-fi. Together they prove that the spirit of
indie filmmaking is alive and kicking.
3)" Love Me if You Dare"
This surreal French romanctic dramedy

rubbed more than one critic the wrong way with its shameless romanti
cism and blatant overuse of the song "La Vie En Rose," but I don't care.
It's pure love heroin. Think "Amelie" on steroids.

4)"The Incredibles"
Pixar's finest movie to date capi
talizes on that whole superhero phe
nomenon but somehow manages to
mix in complex themes of family and
individuality with ingenious action se
quences and gorgeous character
designs. The smartest fun to be had
all year.
5) "Spider-man 2"
I feel a little ashamed putting two
superhero movies on this list, but
being underwhelmed by the first in
stallment it was such a relief to see
director Sam Raimi finally show
some whimsy. At last, a comic book
movie that flows and throbs like

you'd expect a comic book to, from the boldly stylized New York envi
ronments to the zippy fight scenes to that irresistibly mopey romance.

fop Five Reasons I Was thankful
To Be Out of the Country
for the Last Three Months
1) Missed the Guess? print ads with Paris Hilton, whose lazy right
■eye either disgusts me or gets me hot, I'm not really sure which.
2) Didn't leam about the Jay-Z / Linkin Park collaboration until De
cember, when yuletide cheer made the traumatic knowledge
slightly more bearable.
3) Got out of watching the season premiere of "The 0.C." with my
12-year-old sister, who said she found the narrative a little "below
her level."
4) Nonstop news coverage of G.W.'s reelection was slightly less
nauseous in Spanish.
5) No chance of getting sucker-punched by an irate Detroit Pis
tons player in Santiago, Chile.

Top Five Reasons It Was Tragic To Be Out of the Country
for the Last Three Months
1) Missed the Guess? print ads with Paris Hilton, whose lazy right
ieye either disgusts me or gets me hot, I'm not really sure which.
2) Scott Peterson's murder conviction didn't have the profound
impact on my life it would have had had I been in the United
States.
3) The record-setting plummet of the American greenback light
ened my checking account at unprecedented speed, but talking
to friends in London and the Euro zone brought solace.
4) Wasn't around to fight the Munger dorm proposal. Why do
grad students get a new dorm when undergrads returning from
abroad are stuck in Crothers?
5) Had to watch Jon Stewart's "Crossfire" appearance on the net,
which didn't properly capture Tucker Carlson's fuming bow tie.

Top Five of Dance
1) Movin' Out
The Broadway hit musical choreographed
by Twyla Tharp and danced to the songs of
Billy Joel. Great music and upbeat dancing
make this Vietnam War-era story of love and
friendship one not to miss. I can safely place it
at no. 1 after seeing it in New York, San Diego,
San Francisco and Sacramento.
2) Robert Moses Kin
One of the Bay Area community's most in
fluential companies; utilizes dance as a way to
unify people across race, class, culture and
gender. The company tours nationally and col
laborates with other performing arts groups
such as Youth Speaks poetry group. Robert
Moses is also a Stanford faculty member.

Top Five Fashion Trends that Cause our
Eyes to Twitch Uncontrollably
1) F'Ugg-lies
Maybe you went the cheap route and bought
| Emus or other knockoffs, but they all make us want
to gouge our eyes out. Someone once described
wearing Uggs as "swaddling yourfeet in the remains
of the softest teddy bears" — that's just sick. The
Uggs and miniskirt combo was bad enough This
winter, please restrain yourself from tucking your
leans into these hideous excuses for shoes.
2) Velour Tracksuits
Why won't this trend from 2003 just die al
ready? Just because "Juicy" is stamped on your
ass doesn't mean looking like a roll of '70s-era
carpet is attractive. Sure, Summer and Julie
Cooper were seen in them on the first season of
"The 0.C," but look at all the middle schoolers
and suburban soccer moms wearing them —
even your grandma powerwalks at the mall in
one of these getups.

3) "The Skirt"
Infamous enough to get its own name, übiqui
tous enough to make you look like everyone else.

serene and honest in a dance that portrayed
the dynamic relationship ot nature and human
ity. They left the audience breathless.
4) Mark Morris
Musical genius of modem dance. Morris'
company presented his inventive, witty and
complex but harmonious choreography at UC-
Berkeley. Also this year, San Francisco Ballet
premiered his successful full-length ballet,
"Sylvia."
5) Suzanne Farrell
A dance educator and a legendary balleri
na during the 19605, 70s and '80s, Farrell
continues the legacy of the greatest choreog
rapher of the 20th Century, George Balan
chine. By restaging ballets for her own com
pany, The Suzanne Farrell Ballet, and by pro
fessing her knowledge to students at Florida
State University, The John F. Kennedy Cen
ter for the Performing Arts and across the
world, Farrell is ensuring a beautiful future for
ballet.

Top Five Electronic Toys
I)TheiPod Family
(http://www.apple.com/lpod/ — Starting at
$249.99)
The no. 1 most-wanted electronic gadget for
two years in a row, the iPod just continues to
create an extreme amount of demand with its
extremely easy to use interface, stylish design,
huge amount of storage space and now ex
tended battery life and a beautiful color screen
with the iPod Photo. Plus, you know those
white headphones are just damn cool.
2) Nintendo DS
(http://www.nintendo.com/systemsds —
$149.99)
Nintendo's newest foray into the portable gam
ing market brings two innovative features to the
handheld world: a dual screen setup allowing
gaming never before dreamed of, and a touch
screen fora crazy gaming experience. A built-in
mic, wireless networking with other DSs, and

the ability to play older Game Boy Advance games makes this
one a winner.
3) Bose Companion 3 Multimedia Speaker System
(http://www.bose.com — $249.00)
If you're looking for a set of small speakers that deliver
amazing sound with a sub that packs amazing power for its
size, then look no further then this Bose computer speaker set.
These are definitely the best speakers you can buy for a rela
tively cheap price. Prepare to be wowed, whether you're lis
tening to the latest rap crap or engrossed in the newest com
puter game.
4) Roomba (http://www.irobot.com/consumer/ — Starting at
$149.99)
For the student who just can't get up to vacuum those five
square feet of floor space, Roomba is a robotic vacuum cleaner
that'll run around and clean it all up for you. Throw it on your hung
over roommate and watch the dirt magically disappear. Just don't
expect it to take out all those beer bottles though.
5) X-Box Live (http://www.xbox.com — $69.99 for Starter kit
and a year subscription)
Not the newest kid on the block, but Live really took off this
year with great games such as Guilty Gear and, of course, Halo
2. If you're looking for a great way to find some competition on
line, check out this little piece of software. It doesn't hurt that it
also includes a headset for some trash-talking.

Top Five Movie Moments of 2004
1) Joel's last memory being wiped in "Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind" — So maybe there's enough mo
ments in the movie to fill this entire list, but the killer
comes near the end, as Joel's final (and earliest) memo
ry of Clementine in a deserted beach house literally
comes crashing down around them. "Meet me in Mon
tauk," Clementine whispers into his ear just before dis
appearing into a haze. I'm so there.
2) The battle of bamboo in "House of Flying Daggers" —
In a deliriously beautiful film overstuffed with visuals, the
biggest stunner is a sequence set in a bamboo forest,
with an army of limber soldiers leaping across tree trunks
while a hailstorm of bamboo spears soar through the air.
As "Hero" also showed us, director Zhang Yimou is a lim
itless fountain of breathtaking moments.
3) The opening scene of "Closer" — It's a tough year
when this sequence has to settle for third. Two gorgeous
people (Jude Law and Natalie Portman) cross paths in a
crowd, ogling each other in slo-mo; lay on that aching
Damien Rice track and you've got an audience in pud
dles beneath their seats, completely unprepared for the
startling mayhem about to follow.
4) The highway chase scene in "Love Me if You Dare" —
Jilted lover Julien goes barreling down a highway at top
speed, joyously alive now that he and his one true love
are playing their deadly game again. As he hurtles to
ward certain death he rattles off all the beautiful things in
life that pale in comparison, and in so doing forces us to
take stock in all things beautiful too.
5) Harry summons the patronus light in "Harry Potter and
the Prisoner of Azkaban" — I'll freely admit that I haven't
read the books, but for me this movie franchise and its
story arcs are unfolding at perfect pace. When Harry
summons the spirit of his dead father to ward off those
swarming dementors and John Williams's celestial
music kicks in, I cry like a baby. A very quiet, happy baby.
Honorable mentions) Large listening to The Shins on
Sam's headphones in "Garden State"; the use of "Rain
drops Keep Fallin' on my Head" in "Spider-man 2"; the
end credit sequence of "The Life Aquatic" set to Bowie's
"Queen Bitch"; Howard Hughes filming his war epic from
a plane in"The Aviator"; that psycho twist midway;
through "The Village"; The Bride's training sequence
with Pai Mei in "Kill Bill 2."

Top Five Films of 2004
I)" Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind"
Far and away this year's most
thought-provoking and heartwrenching
film, proving screenwriter Charlie Kauf
mann has a soul in addition to that gift
for the madcap. Spot-on performances
by the gorgeous leads (even Kirsten
Dunst is appealing) and Michel
Gondry's game direction make it pure
perfection.
2)" Napoleon Dynamite" and
"Primer"

I know, I
know, it's

cheating to put down two here, but these Sun
dance favorites both owe their success to
stunning originality and fantastic word of
mouth. One is a screwball comedy set in
Idaho, the other is a sly mindtrap of low-tech
sci-fi. Together they prove that the spirit of
indie filmmaking is alive and kicking.
3)" Love Me if You Dare"
This surreal French romanctic dramedy

rubbed more than one critic the wrong way with its shameless romanti
cism and blatant overuse of the song "La Vie En Rose," but I don't care.
It's pure love heroin. Think "Amelie" on steroids.

4)"The Incredibles"
Pixar's finest movie to date capi
talizes on that whole superhero phe
nomenon but somehow manages to
mix in complex themes of family and
individuality with ingenious action se
quences and gorgeous character
designs. The smartest fun to be had
all year.
5) "Spider-man 2"
I feel a little ashamed putting two
superhero movies on this list, but
being underwhelmed by the first in
stallment it was such a relief to see
director Sam Raimi finally show
some whimsy. At last, a comic book
movie that flows and throbs like

you'd expect a comic book to, from the boldly stylized New York envi
ronments to the zippy fight scenes to that irresistibly mopey romance.

fop Five Reasons I Was thankful
To Be Out of the Country
for the Last Three Months
1) Missed the Guess? print ads with Paris Hilton, whose lazy right
■eye either disgusts me or gets me hot, I'm not really sure which.
2) Didn't leam about the Jay-Z / Linkin Park collaboration until De
cember, when yuletide cheer made the traumatic knowledge
slightly more bearable.
3) Got out of watching the season premiere of "The 0.C." with my
12-year-old sister, who said she found the narrative a little "below
her level."
4) Nonstop news coverage of G.W.'s reelection was slightly less
nauseous in Spanish.
5) No chance of getting sucker-punched by an irate Detroit Pis
tons player in Santiago, Chile.

Top Five Reasons It Was Tragic To Be Out of the Country
for the Last Three Months
1) Missed the Guess? print ads with Paris Hilton, whose lazy right

2) Scott Peterson's murder conviction didn't have the profound
impact on my life it would have had had I been in the United
States.
3) The record-setting plummet of the American greenback light
ened my checking account at unprecedented speed, but talking
to friends in London and the Euro zone brought solace.
4) Wasn't around to fight the Munger dorm proposal. Why do
grad students get a new dorm when undergrads returning from
abroad are stuck in Crothers?
5) Had to watch Jon Stewart's "Crossfire" appearance on the net,
which didn't properly capture Tucker Carlson's fuming bow tie.

cism and blatant overuse of the song "La Vie En Rose," but I don't care.
It's pure love heroin. Think "Amelie" on steroids.

4)"The Incredibles"
Pixar's finest movie to date capi
talizes on that whole superhero phe
nomenon but somehow manages to
mix in complex themes of family and
individuality with ingenious action se
quences and gorgeous character
designs. The smartest fun to be had
all year.
5) "Spider-man 2"
I feel a little ashamed putting two
superhero movies on this list, but
being underwhelmed by the first in
stallment it was such a relief to see
director Sam Raimi finally show
some whimsy. At last, a comic book
movie that flows and throbs like

you'd expect a comic book to, from the boldly stylized New York envi
ronments to the zippy fight scenes to that irresistibly mopey romance.

fop Five Reasons I Was thankful
To Be Out of the Country
for the Last Three Months
1) Missed the Guess? print ads with Paris Hilton, whose lazy right
■eye either disgusts me or gets me hot, I'm not really sure which.
2) Didn't leam about the Jay-Z / Linkin Park collaboration until De
cember, when yuletide cheer made the traumatic knowledge
slightly more bearable.
3) Got out of watching the season premiere of "The 0.C." with my
12-year-old sister, who said she found the narrative a little "below
her level."
4) Nonstop news coverage of G.W.'s reelection was slightly less
nauseous in Spanish.
5) No chance of getting sucker-punched by an irate Detroit Pis
tons player in Santiago, Chile.

Top Five Reasons It Was Tragic To Be Out of the Country
for the Last Three Months
1) Missed the Guess? print ads with Paris Hilton, whose lazy right
ieye either disgusts me or gets me hot, I'm not really sure which.
2) Scott Peterson's murder conviction didn't have the profound
impact on my life it would have had had I been in the United
States.
3) The record-setting plummet of the American greenback light
ened my checking account at unprecedented speed, but talking
to friends in London and the Euro zone brought solace.
4) Wasn't around to fight the Munger dorm proposal. Why do
grad students get a new dorm when undergrads returning from
abroad are stuck in Crothers?
5) Had to watch Jon Stewart's "Crossfire" appearance on the net,
which didn't properly capture Tucker Carlson's fuming bow tie.

Top Five of Dance
1) Movin' Out
The Broadway hit musical choreographed
by Twyla Tharp and danced to the songs of
Billy Joel. Great music and upbeat dancing
make this Vietnam War-era story of love and
friendship one not to miss. I can safely place it
at no. 1 after seeing it in New York, San Diego,
San Francisco and Sacramento.
2) Robert Moses Kin
One of the Bay Area community's most in

unify people across race, class, culture and

laborates with other performing arts groups
such as Youth Speaks poetry group. Robert
Moses is also a Stanford faculty member.

Top Five Fashion Trends that Cause our
Eyes to Twitch Uncontrollably
1) F'Ugg-lies
Maybe you went the cheap route and bought
| Emus or other knockoffs, but they all make us want
to gouge our eyes out. Someone once described
wearing Uggs as "swaddling yourfeet in the remains
of the softest teddy bears" — that's just sick. The
Uggs and miniskirt combo was bad enough This
winter, please restrain yourself from tucking your
leans into these hideous excuses for shoes.
2) Velour Tracksuits
Why won't this trend from 2003 just die al
ready? Just because "Juicy" is stamped on your
ass doesn't mean looking like a roll of '70s-era
carpet is attractive. Sure, Summer and Julie
Cooper were seen in them on the first season of
"The 0.C," but look at all the middle schoolers
and suburban soccer moms wearing them —
even your grandma powerwalks at the mall in
one of these getups.
•
3) "The Skirt"
Infamous enough to get its own name, übiqui
tous enough to make you look like everyone else.

serene and honest in a dance that portrayed
the dynamic relationship ot nature and human
ity. They left the audience breathless.
4) Mark Morris
Musical genius of modem dance. Morris'
company presented his inventive, witty and
complex but harmonious choreography at UC-
Berkeley. Also this year, San Francisco Ballet
premiered his successful full-length ballet,
"Sylvia."
5) Suzanne Farrell
A dance educator and a legendary balleri
na during the 19605, 70s and '80s, Farrell
continues the legacy of the greatest choreog
rapher of the 20th Century, George Balan
chine. By restaging ballets for her own com
pany, The Suzanne Farrell Ballet, and by pro
fessing her knowledge to students at Florida
State University, The John F. Kennedy Cen
ter for the Performing Arts and across the
world, Farrell is ensuring a beautiful future for
ballet.

Top Five Electronic Toys
I)TheiPod Family
(http://www.apple.com/lpod/ — Starting at
$249.99)
The no. 1 most-wanted electronic gadget for
two years in a row, the iPod just continues to
create an extreme amount of demand with its
extremely easy to use interface, stylish design,
huge amount of storage space and now ex
tended battery life and a beautiful color screen
with the iPod Photo. Plus, you know those
white headphones are just damn cool.
2) Nintendo DS
(http://www.nintendo.com/systemsds —
$149.99)
Nintendo's newest foray into the portable gam
ing market brings two innovative features to the
handheld world: a dual screen setup allowing
gaming never before dreamed of, and a touch
screen fora crazy gaming experience. A built-in
mic, wireless networking with other DSs, and

the ability to play older Game Boy Advance games makes this
one a winner.
3) Bose Companion 3 Multimedia Speaker System
(http://www.bose.com — $249.00)
If you're looking for a set of small speakers that deliver
amazing sound with a sub that packs amazing power for its
size, then look no further then this Bose computer speaker set.
These are definitely the best speakers you can buy for a rela
tively cheap price. Prepare to be wowed, whether you're lis
tening to the latest rap crap or engrossed in the newest com
puter game.
4) Roomba (http://www.irobot.com/consumer/ — Starting at
$149.99)
For the student who just can't get up to vacuum those five
square feet of floor space, Roomba is a robotic vacuum cleaner
that'll run around and clean it all up for you. Throw it on your hung
over roommate and watch the dirt magically disappear. Just don't
expect it to take out all those beer bottles though.
5) X-Box Live (http://www.xbox.com — $69.99 for Starter kit
and a year subscription)
Not the newest kid on the block, but Live really took off this
year with great games such as Guilty Gear and, of course, Halo
2. If you're looking for a great way to find some competition on
line, check out this little piece of software. It doesn't hurt that it
also includes a headset for some trash-talking.
ERIC FORD

Top Five Movie Moments of 2004
1) Joel's last memory being wiped in "Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind" — So maybe there's enough mo
ments in the movie to fill this entire list, but the killer
comes near the end, as Joel's final (and earliest) memo
ry of Clementine in a deserted beach house literally
comes crashing down around them. "Meet me in Mon
tauk," Clementine whispers into his ear just before dis
appearing into a haze. I'm so there.
2) The battle of bamboo in "House of Flying Daggers" —
In a deliriously beautiful film overstuffed with visuals, the
biggest stunner is a sequence set in a bamboo forest,
with an army of limber soldiers leaping across tree trunks
while a hailstorm of bamboo spears soar through the air.
As "Hero" also showed us, director Zhang Yimou is a lim
itless fountain of breathtaking moments.
3) The opening scene of "Closer" — It's a tough year
when this sequence has to settle for third. Two gorgeous
people (Jude Law and Natalie Portman) cross paths in a
crowd, ogling each other in slo-mo; lay on that aching
Damien Rice track and you've got an audience in pud
dles beneath their seats, completely unprepared for the
startling mayhem about to follow.
4) The highway chase scene in "Love Me if You Dare" —
Jilted lover Julien goes barreling down a highway at top
speed, joyously alive now that he and his one true love
are playing their deadly game again. As he hurtles to
ward certain death he rattles off all the beautiful things in
life that pale in comparison, and in so doing forces us to
take stock in all things beautiful too.
5) Harry summons the patronus light in "Harry Potter and
the Prisoner of Azkaban" — I'll freely admit that I haven't
read the books, but for me this movie franchise and its
story arcs are unfolding at perfect pace. When Harry
summons the spirit of his dead father to ward off those
swarming dementors and John Williams's celestial
music kicks in, I cry like a baby. A very quiet, happy baby.
Honorable mentions) Large listening to The Shins on
Sam's headphones in "Garden State"; the use of "Rain
drops Keep Fallin' on my Head" in "Spider-man 2"; the
end credit sequence of "The Life Aquatic" set to Bowie's
"Queen Bitch"; Howard Hughes filming his war epic from
a plane in"The Aviator"; that psycho twist midway;
through "The Village"; The Bride's training sequence
with Pai Mei in "Kill Bill 2."

Top Five Films of 2004
I)" Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind"
Far and away this year's most
thought-provoking and heartwrenching
film, proving screenwriter Charlie Kauf
mann has a soul in addition to that gift
for the madcap. Spot-on performances
by the gorgeous leads (even Kirsten
Dunst is appealing) and Michel
Gondry's game direction make it pure
perfection.
2)" Napoleon Dynamite" and
"Primer"

I know, I
know, it's

cheating to put down two here, but these Sun
dance favorites both owe their success to
stunning originality and fantastic word of
mouth. One is a screwball comedy set in
Idaho, the other is a sly mindtrap of low-tech
sci-fi. Together they prove that the spirit of
indie filmmaking is alive and kicking.
3)" Love Me if You Dare"
This surreal French romanctic dramedy

rubbed more than one critic the wrong way with its shameless romanti
cism and blatant overuse of the song "La Vie En Rose," but I don't care.
It's pure love heroin. Think "Amelie" on steroids.

4)"The Incredibles"
Pixar's finest movie to date capi
talizes on that whole superhero phe
nomenon but somehow manages to
mix in complex themes of family and
individuality with ingenious action se
quences and gorgeous character
designs. The smartest fun to be had
all year.
5) "Spider-man 2"
I feel a little ashamed putting two
superhero movies on this list, but
being underwhelmed by the first in
stallment it was such a relief to see
director Sam Raimi finally show
some whimsy. At last, a comic book
movie that flows and throbs like

you'd expect a comic book to, from the boldly stylized New York envi

Top Five Movie Moments of 2004
1) Joel's last memory being wiped in "Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind" — So maybe there's enough mo
ments in the movie to fill this entire list, but the killer
comes near the end, as Joel's final (and earliest) memo
ry of Clementine in a deserted beach house literally
comes crashing down around them. "Meet me in Mon
tauk," Clementine whispers into his ear just before dis
appearing into a haze. I'm so there.
2) The battle of bamboo in "House of Flying Daggers" —
In a deliriously beautiful film overstuffed with visuals, the
biggest stunner is a sequence set in a bamboo forest,
with an army of limber soldiers leaping across tree trunks
while a hailstorm of bamboo spears soar through the air.
As "Hero" also showed us, director Zhang Yimou is a lim
itless fountain of breathtaking moments.
3) The opening scene of "Closer" — It's a tough year
when this sequence has to settle for third. Two gorgeous
people (Jude Law and Natalie Portman) cross paths in a
crowd, ogling each other in slo-mo; lay on that aching
Damien Rice track and you've got an audience in pud
dles beneath their seats, completely unprepared for the
startling mayhem about to follow.
4) The highway chase scene in "Love Me if You Dare" —
Jilted lover Julien goes barreling down a highway at top
speed, joyously alive now that he and his one true love
are playing their deadly game again. As he hurtles to
ward certain death he rattles off all the beautiful things in
life that pale in comparison, and in so doing forces us to
take stock in all things beautiful too.
5) Harry summons the patronus light in "Harry Potter and
the Prisoner of Azkaban" — I'll freely admit that I haven't
read the books, but for me this movie franchise and its
story arcs are unfolding at perfect pace. When Harry
summons the spirit of his dead father to ward off those
swarming dementors and John Williams's celestial
music kicks in, I cry like a baby. A very quiet, happy baby.
Honorable mentions) Large listening to The Shins on
Sam's headphones in "Garden State"; the use of "Rain
drops Keep Fallin' on my Head" in "Spider-man 2"; the
end credit sequence of "The Life Aquatic" set to Bowie's
"Queen Bitch"; Howard Hughes filming his war epic from
a plane in"The Aviator"; that psycho twist midway;
through "The Village"; The Bride's training sequence
with Pai Mei in "Kill Bill 2."

Top Five Films of 2004
I)" Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind"
Far and away this year's most
thought-provoking and heartwrenching
film, proving screenwriter Charlie Kauf
mann has a soul in addition to that gift
for the madcap. Spot-on performances
by the gorgeous leads (even Kirsten
Dunst is appealing) and Michel
Gondry's game direction make it pure
perfection.
2)" Napoleon Dynamite" and
"Primer"

I know, I
know, it's

cheating to put down two here, but these Sun
dance favorites both owe their success to
stunning originality and fantastic word of
mouth. One is a screwball comedy set in
Idaho, the other is a sly mindtrap of low-tech
sci-fi. Together they prove that the spirit of
indie filmmaking is alive and kicking.
3)" Love Me if You Dare"
This surreal French romanctic dramedy

rubbed more than one critic the wrong way with its shameless romanti
cism and blatant overuse of the song "La Vie En Rose," but I don't care.
It's pure love heroin. Think "Amelie" on steroids.

4)"The Incredibles"
Pixar's finest movie to date capi
talizes on that whole superhero phe
nomenon but somehow manages to
mix in complex themes of family and
individuality with ingenious action se
quences and gorgeous character
designs. The smartest fun to be had
all year.
5) "Spider-man 2"
I feel a little ashamed putting two
superhero movies on this list, but
being underwhelmed by the first in
stallment it was such a relief to see
director Sam Raimi finally show
some whimsy. At last, a comic book
movie that flows and throbs like

you'd expect a comic book to, from the boldly stylized New York envi
ronments to the zippy fight scenes to that irresistibly mopey romance.

fop Five Reasons I Was thankful
To Be Out of the Country
for the Last Three Months
1) Missed the Guess? print ads with Paris Hilton, whose lazy right
■eye either disgusts me or gets me hot, I'm not really sure which.
2) Didn't leam about the Jay-Z / Linkin Park collaboration until De
cember, when yuletide cheer made the traumatic knowledge
slightly more bearable.
3) Got out of watching the season premiere of "The 0.C." with my
12-year-old sister, who said she found the narrative a little "below
her level."
4) Nonstop news coverage of G.W.'s reelection was slightly less
nauseous in Spanish.
5) No chance of getting sucker-punched by an irate Detroit Pis
tons player in Santiago, Chile.

Top Five Reasons It Was Tragic To Be Out of the Country
for the Last Three Months
1) Missed the Guess? print ads with Paris Hilton, whose lazy right
ieye either disgusts me or gets me hot, I'm not really sure which.
2) Scott Peterson's murder conviction didn't have the profound
impact on my life it would have had had I been in the United
States.
3) The record-setting plummet of the American greenback light
ened my checking account at unprecedented speed, but talking
to friends in London and the Euro zone brought solace.
4) Wasn't around to fight the Munger dorm proposal. Why do
grad students get a new dorm when undergrads returning from
abroad are stuck in Crothers?
5) Had to watch Jon Stewart's "Crossfire" appearance on the net,
which didn't properly capture Tucker Carlson's fuming bow tie.

Top Five of Dance
1) Movin' Out
The Broadway hit musical choreographed
by Twyla Tharp and danced to the songs of
Billy Joel. Great music and upbeat dancing

friendship one not to miss. I can safely place it
at no. 1 after seeing it in New York, San Diego,

Top Five Fashion Trends that Cause our
Eyes to Twitch Uncontrollably
1) F'Ugg-lies
Maybe you went the cheap route and bought
| Emus or other knockoffs, but they all make us want
to gouge our eyes out. Someone once described
wearing Uggs as "swaddling yourfeet in the remains
of the softest teddy bears" — that's just sick. The
Uggs and miniskirt combo was bad enough This
winter, please restrain yourself from tucking your
leans into these hideous excuses for shoes.
2) Velour Tracksuits
Why won't this trend from 2003 just die al
ready? Just because "Juicy" is stamped on your
ass doesn't mean looking like a roll of '70s-era
carpet is attractive. Sure, Summer and Julie
Cooper were seen in them on the first season of
"The 0.C," but look at all the middle schoolers
and suburban soccer moms wearing them —
even your grandma powerwalks at the mall in
one of these getups.

3) "The Skirt"
Infamous enough to get its own name, übiqui
tous enough to make you look like everyone else.

serene and honest in a dance that portrayed
the dynamic relationship ot nature and human
ity. They left the audience breathless.
4) Mark Morris
Musical genius of modem dance. Morris'
company presented his inventive, witty and
complex but harmonious choreography at UC-
Berkeley. Also this year, San Francisco Ballet
premiered his successful full-length ballet,
"Sylvia."
5) Suzanne Farrell
A dance educator and a legendary balleri
na during the 19605, 70s and '80s, Farrell
continues the legacy of the greatest choreog
rapher of the 20th Century, George Balan
chine. By restaging ballets for her own com
pany, The Suzanne Farrell Ballet, and by pro
fessing her knowledge to students at Florida
State University, The John F. Kennedy Cen
ter for the Performing Arts and across the
world, Farrell is ensuring a beautiful future for
ballet.

4) Paris Hilton
Technically not an item
of clothing, but she's been
worn by quite a few men,
as seen in the infamous
sex tapes. "Stupid Spoiled

Top Five Electronic Toys
I)TheiPod Family
(http://www.apple.com/lpod/ — Starting at
$249.99)
The no. 1 most-wanted electronic gadget for
two years in a row, the iPod just continues to
create an extreme amount of demand with its

huge amount of storage space and now ex
tended battery life and a beautiful color screen

white headphones are just damn cool.
2) Nintendo DS
(http://www.nintendo.com/systemsds —
$149.99)
Nintendo's newest foray into the portable gam
ing market brings two innovative features to the
handheld world: a dual screen setup allowing
gaming never before dreamed of, and a touch
screen fora crazy gaming experience. A built-in
mic, wireless networking with other DSs, and

the ability to play older Game Boy Advance games makes this
one a winner.
3) Bose Companion 3 Multimedia Speaker System
(http://www.bose.com — $249.00)
If you're looking for a set of small speakers that deliver
amazing sound with a sub that packs amazing power for its

EMILY HITE

You know the one I'm talk
ing about — plain, striped

waistband, stretchy, usu
ally made from cheap cot
ton and lycra, with an ex
tremely short skirt. Now
available in preppier mate
rials like tweed and cor
duroy at Abersnobbie and
Bitch.
4) Paris Hilton
Technically not an item
of clothing, but she's been
worn by quite a few men,
as seen in the infamous
sex tapes. "Stupid Spoiled
Whore" (as seen on a re
cent episode of South
Park) wouldn't be a bad

name for her upcoming fashion line, since she
makes J. Lo look like a nun.
5) Von Dutch

Top Five Electronic Toys
I)TheiPod Family
(http://www.apple.com/lpod/ — Starting at
$249.99)
The no. 1 most-wanted electronic gadget for
two years in a row, the iPod just continues to
create an extreme amount of demand with its
extremely easy to use interface, stylish design,
huge amount of storage space and now ex
tended battery life and a beautiful color screen
with the iPod Photo. Plus, you know those
white headphones are just damn cool.
2) Nintendo DS
(http://www.nintendo.com/systemsds —
$149.99)
Nintendo's newest foray into the portable gam
ing market brings two innovative features to the
handheld world: a dual screen setup allowing
gaming never before dreamed of, and a touch
screen fora crazy gaming experience. A built-in
mic, wireless networking with other DSs, and

the ability to play older Game Boy Advance games makes this
one a winner.
3) Bose Companion 3 Multimedia Speaker System
(http://www.bose.com — $249.00)
If you're looking for a set of small speakers that deliver
amazing sound with a sub that packs amazing power for its
size, then look no further then this Bose computer speaker set.
These are definitely the best speakers you can buy for a rela
tively cheap price. Prepare to be wowed, whether you're lis
tening to the latest rap crap or engrossed in the newest com
puter game.
4) Roomba (http://www.irobot.com/consumer/ — Starting at
$149.99)
For the student who just can't get up to vacuum those five
square feet of floor space, Roomba is a robotic vacuum cleaner
that'll run around and clean it all up for you. Throw it on your hung
over roommate and watch the dirt magically disappear. Just don't
expect it to take out all those beer bottles though.
5) X-Box Live (http://www.xbox.com — $69.99 for Starter kit
and a year subscription)
Not the newest kid on the block, but Live really took off this
year with great games such as Guilty Gear and, of course, Halo
2. If you're looking for a great way to find some competition on
line, check out this little piece of software. It doesn't hurt that it
also includes a headset for some trash-talking.

Top Five Movie Moments of 2004
1) Joel's last memory being wiped in "Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind" — So maybe there's enough mo
ments in the movie to fill this entire list, but the killer
comes near the end, as Joel's final (and earliest) memo
ry of Clementine in a deserted beach house literally
comes crashing down around them. "Meet me in Mon
tauk," Clementine whispers into his ear just before dis
appearing into a haze. I'm so there.
2) The battle of bamboo in "House of Flying Daggers" —
In a deliriously beautiful film overstuffed with visuals, the
biggest stunner is a sequence set in a bamboo forest,
with an army of limber soldiers leaping across tree trunks
while a hailstorm of bamboo spears soar through the air.
As "Hero" also showed us, director Zhang Yimou is a lim
itless fountain of breathtaking moments.
3) The opening scene of "Closer" — It's a tough year
when this sequence has to settle for third. Two gorgeous
people (Jude Law and Natalie Portman) cross paths in a
crowd, ogling each other in slo-mo; lay on that aching
Damien Rice track and you've got an audience in pud
dles beneath their seats, completely unprepared for the
startling mayhem about to follow.
4) The highway chase scene in "Love Me if You Dare" —
Jilted lover Julien goes barreling down a highway at top
speed, joyously alive now that he and his one true love
are playing their deadly game again. As he hurtles to
ward certain death he rattles off all the beautiful things in
life that pale in comparison, and in so doing forces us to
take stock in all things beautiful too.
5) Harry summons the patronus light in "Harry Potter and
the Prisoner of Azkaban" — I'll freely admit that I haven't
read the books, but for me this movie franchise and its
story arcs are unfolding at perfect pace. When Harry
summons the spirit of his dead father to ward off those
swarming dementors and John Williams's celestial
music kicks in, I cry like a baby. A very quiet, happy baby.
Honorable mentions) Large listening to The Shins on
Sam's headphones in "Garden State"; the use of "Rain
drops Keep Fallin' on my Head" in "Spider-man 2"; the
end credit sequence of "The Life Aquatic" set to Bowie's
"Queen Bitch"; Howard Hughes filming his war epic from
a plane in"The Aviator"; that psycho twist midway;
through "The Village"; The Bride's training sequence
with Pai Mei in "Kill Bill 2."
CHRIS LEE

Top Five Films of 2004
I)" Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind"
Far and away this year's most
thought-provoking and heartwrenching
film, proving screenwriter Charlie Kauf
mann has a soul in addition to that gift
for the madcap. Spot-on performances
by the gorgeous leads (even Kirsten
Dunst is appealing) and Michel
Gondry's game direction make it pure
perfection.
2)" Napoleon Dynamite" and
"Primer"

I know, I
know, it's

cheating to put down two here, but these Sun
dance favorites both owe their success to
stunning originality and fantastic word of
mouth. One is a screwball comedy set in
Idaho, the other is a sly mindtrap of low-tech
sci-fi. Together they prove that the spirit of
indie filmmaking is alive and kicking.
3)" Love Me if You Dare"
This surreal French romanctic dramedy

rubbed more than one critic the wrong way with its shameless romanti
cism and blatant overuse of the song "La Vie En Rose," but I don't care.
It's pure love heroin. Think "Amelie" on steroids.

4)"The Incredibles"
Pixar's finest movie to date capi
talizes on that whole superhero phe
nomenon but somehow manages to
mix in complex themes of family and
individuality with ingenious action se
quences and gorgeous character
designs. The smartest fun to be had
all year.
5) "Spider-man 2"
I feel a little ashamed putting two
superhero movies on this list, but
being underwhelmed by the first in
stallment it was such a relief to see
director Sam Raimi finally show
some whimsy. At last, a comic book
movie that flows and throbs like

you'd expect a comic book to, from the boldly stylized New York envi
ronments to the zippy fight scenes to that irresistibly mopey romance.

fop Five Reasons I Was thankful
To Be Out of the Country
for the Last Three Months
1) Missed the Guess? print ads with Paris Hilton, whose lazy right
■eye either disgusts me or gets me hot, I'm not really sure which.
2) Didn't leam about the Jay-Z / Linkin Park collaboration until De
cember, when yuletide cheer made the traumatic knowledge
slightly more bearable.
3) Got out of watching the season premiere of "The 0.C." with my
12-year-old sister, who said she found the narrative a little "below
her level."
4) Nonstop news coverage of G.W.'s reelection was slightly less
nauseous in Spanish.
5) No chance of getting sucker-punched by an irate Detroit Pis
tons player in Santiago, Chile.

Top Five Reasons It Was Tragic To Be Out of the Country
for the Last Three Months
1) Missed the Guess? print ads with Paris Hilton, whose lazy right
ieye either disgusts me or gets me hot, I'm not really sure which.
2) Scott Peterson's murder conviction didn't have the profound
impact on my life it would have had had I been in the United
States.
3) The record-setting plummet of the American greenback light
ened my checking account at unprecedented speed, but talking
to friends in London and the Euro zone brought solace.
4) Wasn't around to fight the Munger dorm proposal. Why do
grad students get a new dorm when undergrads returning from
abroad are stuck in Crothers?
5) Had to watch Jon Stewart's "Crossfire" appearance on the net,
which didn't properly capture Tucker Carlson's fuming bow tie.

Top Five of Dance
1) Movin' Out
The Broadway hit musical choreographed
by Twyla Tharp and danced to the songs of
Billy Joel. Great music and upbeat dancing

at no. 1 after seeing it in New York, San Diego,

Top Five Fashion Trends that Cause our
Eyes to Twitch Uncontrollably
1) F'Ugg-lies
Maybe you went the cheap route and bought
| Emus or other knockoffs, but they all make us want
to gouge our eyes out. Someone once described
wearing Uggs as "swaddling yourfeet in the remains
of the softest teddy bears" — that's just sick. The
Uggs and miniskirt combo was bad enough This
winter, please restrain yourself from tucking your
leans into these hideous excuses for shoes.
2) Velour Tracksuits
Why won't this trend from 2003 just die al
ready? Just because "Juicy" is stamped on your
ass doesn't mean looking like a roll of '70s-era
carpet is attractive. Sure, Summer and Julie
Cooper were seen in them on the first season of
"The 0.C," but look at all the middle schoolers
and suburban soccer moms wearing them —
even your grandma powerwalks at the mall in
one of these getups.

3) "The Skirt"
Infamous enough to get its own name, übiqui
tous enough to make you look like everyone else.

serene and honest in a dance that portrayed
the dynamic relationship ot nature and human
ity. They left the audience breathless.
4) Mark Morris
Musical genius of modem dance. Morris'
company presented his inventive, witty and
complex but harmonious choreography at UC-
Berkeley. Also this year, San Francisco Ballet
premiered his successful full-length ballet,
"Sylvia."
5) Suzanne Farrell
A dance educator and a legendary balleri
na during the 19605, 70s and '80s, Farrell
continues the legacy of the greatest choreog
rapher of the 20th Century, George Balan
chine. By restaging ballets for her own com
