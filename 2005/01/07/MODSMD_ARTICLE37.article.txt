## Murder on the Sea of Love 
### KATHERINE LI INTERMISSION EPICURE 
If you have ever thought of taking
your date to dinner and then the the-
for those are you who are ultra
classy), rest assured that there is now
an even more chic option that com
bines hoth: Mystery dining that in
volves a murder.
As I was ushered into a room at the
Benjamin Franklin Hotel in San

Mateo, I knew at once that this would
not be a typical dinner. Instead of the

soft candlelight and large black stage I
was expecting, there were several large
round tables stationed themselves
throughout the brightly lit room. I
found myself seated at a circular table
with seven women, all old enough to be
my mom, and one misplaced young
ster whose boyish looks made him look
five instead of 13. Immediately, a man
with a tall chefs hat and white apron
came cheerfully bounding up to the

table and introduced himself as "Chef
Fredo." I Ie would be taking care of the

food during our last night aboard our
fictitious cruise ship, the S.S. Amore. I
eyed him suspiciously. Was he the real
chef? Was he going to bring our food?
Could I ask him if the salad to be
served contained nuts? Fora moment,
reality and fantasy confounded them
selves within my reason and I was quite
sure I was a passenger having dinner
on a cruise.
The performance began as the
seven-person cast began to boom
out scripted lines. Throughout the
night, the actors encouraged the
diners to tell a joke, sing or, as the
boy from our table did, disjoin his
elbow, winning an award 1 might
add. Between audience members'
raunchy jokes and song perfor
mances, drama unfolded and entrees
were served.
The three-course meal from
Mediterranean Astaria Restaurant in
downtown San Mateo began with a
leafy salad, sparse in ingredients,
dressed in tangy citrus vinaigrette
and crumbled Gorgonzola. Waiters
in black drifted seamlessly in and out
of the room replenishing water and
bread. It was followed by a delicious
ly tender and juicy braised chicken
cacciatore bathed in tomato and
white wine sauce. With a mere touch
of the fork, the chicken meat fell off

the bone. While the mystery came to
a climax as one of the cruise ship
members was found dead, the food
ended on a low note as the dessert
was served. The tiramisu lacked
moisture and seemed to me like a
cover-up to serve cake.
At the end of the night, each table
of eight received a sheet of clues and
questions to be turned in fora possi
ble prize at the end. I had brought
paper and pen intending to jot down
notes for the article, but ended up
using them doing detective work a la
Sherlock Holmes with many others.
The night ended perfectly as our
table won the coveted prize —
brunches at restaurant Astoria in
downtown San Mateo.
Despite its superiority over the del
icacies offered by Stanford dining, 1
would rate the food second to the in
teractive performance, which kept
my attention and provided many
laughs throughout the night. The
founder of Gibson House Mystery
Performers is John Gibson, who
began the troupe seven years ago. He
is a talented actor himself and as
sures me that interactive theater is "a
whole lot harder" than stage acting
— "Here, we must hold our talent
and be able to remove the fourth wall
that stage actors build." Under his di

rection, his mystery dinners have
grown in popularity the Bay Area,
taking over four different locations.
Mystery dinner theater patrons
consist of mostly middle-aged and el
derly couples. At other locations,
table size range from two to eight per
sons per table. For the $65 surcharge
that includes food, performance, tip
and tax, John Gibson's mystery per
formance dinners are well worth a
visit.
One warning, though — if you are
truly considering trying out a mystery
dinner to impress your date by taking
her / him to one of these, you should
think twice. Much time is spent inter
acting with the actors, and he I she
might just go home with one of them,
not you. Also, the whole dinner lasts
for about three hours, with the
dessert being served at 9:30 p.m.,
which apparently tired out my neigh
bor as she snored through the actor
introductions and award ceremony. I
was just happy that our table won the
grand prize.

as a kid and want to relive it through
