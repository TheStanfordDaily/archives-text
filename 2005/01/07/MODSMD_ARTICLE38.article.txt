### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
2005—A long time coming...
Ever played that game where you look around
and mentally point out who has and hasn't done
IT (and how recently)? Definitely a favorite past
time for Roxy since childhood, but there is only
one place where you can really know for sure:
Planned Parenthood. The name that was snick
ered in high school hallways or whispered in girls'
bathrooms is now a legit place to go, cause Roxy
is here to tell you SEX IS IN. It was sooo the 90s.
sooo 2004, and it will be involved in the best times
of 2005.

Forget the polaroids of you in spandex with
hot pink scrunchies clumping your massive flu
orescent T-shirt like a roadkill's tail or your
Kurt Cobain flannel or L.A. Lakers jersey that
you wore every day fora week, feeling oh-so
cool. Remember instead all the instances
when Jimmy's hand made it past the Grateful
Dead logo of your t-shirt and under the train
ing bra. Remember when that cute counselor
at an upstate New York summer camp fulfilled
all your fantasies with just one ziiiiiiip — and
down came the tattered jeans (and up, your
manhood).
Now, remember you know better. No more
random acts of kind ass.
Here comes the plug for Planned Parenthood.

Let's not kid ourselves. Latex isn't the sexiest of
additions to a steamy sesh, the fumbling, the assis
tance in rolling it down, the funny smell some
times (flavored or not)... but let's not have kids
ourselves either.
Just imagine sitting in a lobby of sexually ac
tive people. Mentally point at the 16-year-old
schoolgirl coming straight home from school
with her backpack and red and black plaid uni
form, at the 30-something hoochie mama mak
ing night plans even though it clearly says "No
Cell Phones Allowed," at the pair of 20-some
things cut straight from a Gap ad holding
hands, and at the rest just like you. Roxy's close
friend, a charmer of sorts, makes good use of
his trips in several respects. Health status for

the next three months, check. Date status for
the next three nights, check. (As with the fre
quenters of this fine establishments you
KNOW you can have a good time)... or you
can find yourself whispering to the receptionist
you're worried about some funny itching, burn
ing, odor coming from down there... well you
get the drift.
So as part of this New Year and the new you, for
get the stigma and remember to grab the free con
doms (glow in the dark are overrated) and the free
lube (I recommend the mint — it's zesty!). Also,
watch out for the groupie love, the Kobe victims, the
strange old men wandering the dorms, the "easy A"
classes that lie, and the good sex that's dirty with the
bad people who ain't clean.
