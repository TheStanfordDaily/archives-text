### SCOTT HOWARD INTERMISSION MUSIC CRITIC 
20)Thc Dissociativcs: self-titled
In a year filled with bizarre musi
cal surprises (William Shatner did a
collaboration with King Crimson?),
none was more shocking than the
debut LP by The Dissociatives. Would
you have believed me five years ago if
1 told you that the lead singer of the
"90s teenage grunge trio Silverchair
would release an absolutely fantastic
electronic pop side project? Well it's
true. The Dissociatives create gorgeous
melodies in complex ways, resulting in
an album that's as compulsively lis
tenable on the 80th spin as it was on
the first. It's like the Beach Boys pro
duced by Stereolab... in space.

19) (Jwen Stefani: Love Angel Music
Baby
The Clinton-era nostalgia contin
ues with Gwen Stefani, who crafted
the most controversial album of the
year for people who treat their music
like a religion. Unlike most pieces of
art that inspire contentious debate,
however, "Love Angel Music Baby's"
critics weren't angered by its subject
matter, but by the lack thereof. Appar
ently, a lot of people were counting on
the singer of No Doubt's solo album
to be the next "Blood On The
Tracks." It settles for being the party
record of the year for people without
sticks up their asses, and rubs elbows
with everyone from Bernard Sumner
to Pharrell.

18) Gogol Bordello vs. Tamir
Muskat: J.U.F.
Ukrainian wildman Eugene Hiitz
has been playing his own energetic
brand of klezmer punk rock ever
since he left his homeland after the
Chernobyl meltdown. But with
"J.U.F. (Jewish Ukrainishe Freund
schaft)," he sought to create some
thing different, specifically (in his
words from the liner notes) "Arabic
dUb-sextura, the soundtrack fora
Balkan train robbery, gypsy-disco
punk for the after party." It ends up
as a testament to the joys of living in a
multicultural society, backing Hiitz's
raucous storytelling with mariachi
bands, West Indian percussionists
and Israeli rappers.

17) Pi Harvey: Uh Huh Her
For her seventh consecutive mas
terpiece, the great Polly Jean Har
vey turned her back on the main
stream success that 2000s "Stories
From The City, Stories From The
Sea" skirted and recorded its polar
opposite. "Uh Huh Her" is every
thing "Stories" wasn't: slow, mourn
ful, unpolished. It's like if Bruce
Springsteen followed the bombastic
crowd-pleaser "Born In The USA"
with the stark, skeletal "Nebraska."
But the record's slow-burning inten
sity packs a significant punch, and it
includes two of her most stunning
songs yet, "You Come Through"
and"The Desperate Kingdom Of
Love."

16) Mos Dcf: The New Danger
Is the half-a-decade-in-the
making "The New Danger" flaw
less? Far from it. But you're
bound to make some missteps
when you try to combine revolu
tionary politics with the history of
American black music. This is the
kind of fascinating, challenging
record that critics love to call "un
focused." Fuck that. This moody,
rough-edged gem shifts and sub
verts the idea of hip hop so many
times that it makes Mos Def's
beloved solo debut "Black On
Both Sides" feel like escapist fluff.
He used to be content to sit back
and kick knowledge; now he's
mad as hell, and he's not gonna
take it anymore.

15) The Arcade Fire: Funeral
The leap that The Arcade Fire
took from their debut seven song
EP to "Funeral," their first LP, is a
perfect example of how art is made
in the details. While the songs that
comprise this quasi-concept album
are all pretty great to begin with,
it's the small touches — the gentle
accordion in "Neighborhood 2
(Laika)," the gorgeous melody
plinked out on a xylophone in
"Haiti," the furious drum pro
gramming in "Neighborhood 3
(Power Out)" — that send them
over the top into genius territory.
It's a far cry from the generic indie
folk they were playing just a year
ago.

14) Grand National: Kicking The
National Habit
Speaking of gorgeous melodies
plinked out on unconventional in
struments, Grand National banged
the crap out of bells, pianos, steel
drums and whatever else it took to
become the most original new band
of 2004. Though nothing else on
"Kicking The National Habit" can
top its flat-out brilliant opening
track, the Caribbean Britpop hoe
down "Cherry Tree," it's a diverse
collection of tunes that runs the
gamut from Simon & Garfunkel
homages (the head-swaying
"Leaves") to would-be radio hits fea
turing Dixieland jazz horn sections
(just try to get "Playing In The Dis
tance" out of your head).

13) Hjork: Medulla
If you don't get Bjork by now,
you might as well give up. With
"Medulla," the most misunderstood
record of the year, she even lost the
critical fan base that has lavished her
with praise throughout her solo ca
reer. I'm astounded by the number of
people who couldn't see the forest for
the trees here; sure, it's all voices, but
it's Bjork's return to the avant garde
pop that fans of "Post" have been
missing for years! Though I loved
"Homogenic" and "Vespertine," I
secretly wanted something I could
sing along to in the car, and "Who Is
It"and "Triumph Of A Heart" are
more bubblegum than "Big Time
Sensuality."

12) Morrissey: You Are The Quarry
"You Are The Quarry" is the best
record Morrissey's ever recorded on
his own, and the best record he's been
involved with since The Smiths' "The
Queen Is Dead" way back in 1986.
While his previous solo albums were
packed with rockabilly filler, "Quar
ry" effortlessly glides between politi
cal rants, seductive trip hop and oper
atic glam rock without offering up a
single throwaway track. And don't
worry, he hasn't cheered up, as evi
denced by the exquisite self pity of
"The World Is Full Of Crashing
Bores" and "How Could Anybody
Possibly Know How I Feel?"

11) Fran/ Ferdinand: self-titled &
The Killers: Hot Fuss
For some reason, mainstream
rock radio decided to stop playing
phonetically-named hacks like
Trapt and Staind long enough to
work Franz Ferdinand's "Take
Me Out" and The Killers' "Some
body Told Me" into the mix of the
seven songs that they play on an
endless loop. And though they
played them so many times that
nobody ever wants to hear either
one ever again, the albums are
still great. I can't believe that
Franz Ferdinand's record compa
ny hasn't turned "Auf Achse"
into a top 10 single, and The
Killers' 80s revivalism hits a high
point on the best guilty pleasure
Duran Duran never recorded,
"On Top."










KM The Faint: Wet From Birth
How could The Faint follow
"Danse Macabre," the modern classic
that transformed them from Saddle
Creek odd-men-out to veritable un
derground superstars? With a little bit
of everything. On "Wet From Birth,"
The Faint tries out arena rock ("Symp
tom Finger"), dub ("Phone Call"),
Tool-like metal symphonies ("Birth"),
chamber music ("Southern Belles In
I-ondon Sing"), tightly-wound glam
punk ("Drop Kick The Funks") and
even their own "Pesonal Jesus"
("Erection"). It all works like a charm,
but they throw in some awesome
tracks for the dance floor, just for good
measure.

9) Interpol: Antics
Go ahead, keep calling Interpol a
hunch of Joy Division knockoffs. Your
petty name-calling won't stop me from
thinking they're one of the best bands
around. "Antics" isn't as instantly ac
cessible as "Turn On The Bright
I .ights," but it reveals itself as a tighter,
more consistent and overall better
record after a couple of spins, mostly
because it dodges indie rock cliches by
finding inspiration in early W)s AM
radio; "Rvil" and "C'mere" would
sound right at home on a K-Tel compi
lation. Lead singer Paul Banks is trying
to be Ronnie Spector, not lan Curtis.

8) Friend (He: l)J Kicks
Friend oye lives the double life of a
superhero without the alter ego. By
day he crafts lovely muted samba as
one half of Kings Of Convenience, and
by night he is an international DJ who
smgs live over his turntables. The two
bodies of work couldn't be more dif

ferent (except that they're both really
pretty), hut oye makes them overlap
in thrilling ways. With this innovative
record, he has created a DJ mix set for
people who normally wouldn't be
caught dead buying a DJ mix set by re
taining the gentle melodies of his
acoustic day job while he's moonlight
ing at the club.

7) !!!: louden Up Now
A lot of people felt!!! didn't live
up to the hype that their wildly pop
ular single "Me And Giuliani
Down By The Scho'olyard" gener
ated because "Louden Up Now"
wasn't an 80 minute long version of
that song. It was colder, less organ
ic and more overtly political. In
other words, they changed up their
style so they would remain fresh
and stand out from the hundreds of
Rapture-wannabe discopunk
bands that came out this year. Why
is that a bad idea? This is essential
listening for news junkies who love
to shake it like a salt shaker (i.e.:
me).

6) Xiu Xin: Fabulous Muscles
Xiu Xiu lias always been Jamie
Stewart's own intensely private con
fessional. but I can't help but feel
like he recorded "Fabulous Mus
cles" just for me. It's like he asked
me to fill out a survey of my favorite
(incomparable vocals / lyrics, Asian
instrumentation, New Order influ
ence) and least favorite (endless
acoustic drones, shock for shock's
sake) things about his band, then
turned around and made "Scott's
Own Personal Xiu Xiu Album."
Best of all. each and every track dis
plays Stewart's greatest gift: He can
make beauty emerge from chaos like
no one else.
5) Twilight Singers: She I mes You
I'm not a musician, but I bet writing
a new song is less difficult than making
someone else's song sound like your
own. especially if it's someone else's re
ally good song. Leave it to Greg Dulli,
America's pre-eminent white soul man,
to make a covers album that sounds like

a bunch of his original material, a feat
made all the more impressive by ap
plying a unifying style to classic tunes
from Fleetwood Mac, Marvin Gaye.
Bjork and John Coltrane. He also has
the uncanny ability to make serious,
weighty material feel as light as a
summer breeze.

4) IVladvillain: !Vladvillainy & IMF
l)oom:!Y1IY1.. Food?
If you don't know anything about
underground hip hop, chances are
the names MF Doom and Madlib
mean absolutely nothing to you. If
you do know about underground hip
hop, you probably realize that their
collaboration as Madvillain this year
was like the comic book geek equiva
lent of Spider-Man and the X-Men
forming some kind of superhero
guild, and "Madvillainy" ending up
so great is like if James Cameron
bought the movie rights and cast
Bruce Campbell in the lead. "MM ...
Food?" is just as hot, especially since
it's a concept album about eating
food by the best MC in the world
today.

3) Blonde Redhead: Misery Is A
Butterfly
The repulsive hipsters over at
Free Williamsburg, who are only en
thusiastic about their own perpetual
ennui, closed their disaffected, self
congratulatory "Best Of" list by ask
ing, "What record from 2004 will our
kids be listening to?" My answer:
Blonde Redhead's "Misery Is A
Butterfly." Some music is perfect for
the moment in which it was made
and feels dated as the years go by,
while some remains timeless be
cause its message and execution
never goes stale. The ravishing
chamber pop that fills this record
unquestionably belongs in the latter
category.

2) Annie: Anniemul
Every far-fetched, Rupert Mur
doch-slandering conspiracy theory
about corporations determined to
keep the populace stupid by filling the
airwaves with Jessica Simpson and
Hillary Duff was proven this year by
the simple fact that Annie is not cur
rently the biggest pop star in the
world. Granted, you can only get
"Anniemal" in Norway right now. but
that's no excuse. Every song on this
album is a pitch-perfect evocation of
pure pop brilliance. You'll think it's
great the first time you hear it, and by
the 596 th you'll think it's the best
thing you've ever heard in your life.

1) The Fiery Furnaces: Blueberry Boa!
Rolling Stone has been fighting a
losing war against people with
good music taste for decades, but
in 2004 we saw the Battle Of The
Bulge moment that finally sent
Jann Wenner and his forces of
darkness packing — they gave
The Fiery Furnaces' "Blueberry
Boat" two stars, thereby losing
any minuscule thread of credibili
ty they had managed to cling to
after they put Jennifer Love He
witt on their cover a few years
back.
Christian Hoard, who wrote the
review and probably also hates
puppies and freedom, said that the
opening track, "Quay Cur," "ca
reens from gurgling electronica to
cracked folky ballad while
Eleanor [Friedberger, FF's lead
singer) tries to rewrite "Finnegans
Wake.' "
That's pretty accurate, actually,
but it only goes to show that one
man's garbage is another man's
gold. Fm sure other people have
thought of combining the sound of
"White Light / White Heat"-era
Velvet Underground with Meat
Loaf's schizo rock orchestrations,
but no one ever put it on wax be
fore now. "Blueberry Boat" is one
of the most inventive records Fve
ever heard. It's arty and episodic
and strange, but above all, it's ex
tremely fun to listen to.
