### SCOTT HOWARD INTERMISSION MUSIC CRITIC 
20)Thc Dissociativcs: self-titled
In a year filled with bizarre musi
cal surprises (William Shatner did a
collaboration with King Crimson?),
none was more shocking than the
debut LP by The Dissociatives. Would
you have believed me five years ago if
1 told you that the lead singer of the
"90s teenage grunge trio Silverchair
would release an absolutely fantastic
electronic pop side project? Well it's
true. The Dissociatives create gorgeous
melodies in complex ways, resulting in
an album that's as compulsively lis
tenable on the 80th spin as it was on
the first. It's like the Beach Boys pro
duced by Stereolab... in space.

19) (Jwen Stefani: Love Angel Music
Baby
The Clinton-era nostalgia contin
ues with Gwen Stefani, who crafted
the most controversial album of the
year for people who treat their music
like a religion. Unlike most pieces of
art that inspire contentious debate,
however, "Love Angel Music Baby's"
critics weren't angered by its subject
matter, but by the lack thereof. Appar
ently, a lot of people were counting on
the singer of No Doubt's solo album
to be the next "Blood On The
Tracks." It settles for being the party
record of the year for people without
sticks up their asses, and rubs elbows
with everyone from Bernard Sumner
to Pharrell.

18) Gogol Bordello vs. Tamir
Muskat: J.U.F.
Ukrainian wildman Eugene Hiitz
has been playing his own energetic
brand of klezmer punk rock ever
since he left his homeland after the
Chernobyl meltdown. But with
"J.U.F. (Jewish Ukrainishe Freund
schaft)," he sought to create some
thing different, specifically (in his
words from the liner notes) "Arabic
dUb-sextura, the soundtrack fora
Balkan train robbery, gypsy-disco
punk for the after party." It ends up
as a testament to the joys of living in a
multicultural society, backing Hiitz's
raucous storytelling with mariachi
bands, West Indian percussionists
and Israeli rappers.

17) Pi Harvey: Uh Huh Her
For her seventh consecutive mas
terpiece, the great Polly Jean Har
vey turned her back on the main
stream success that 2000s "Stories
From The City, Stories From The
Sea" skirted and recorded its polar
opposite. "Uh Huh Her" is every
thing "Stories" wasn't: slow, mourn
ful, unpolished. It's like if Bruce
Springsteen followed the bombastic
crowd-pleaser "Born In The USA"
with the stark, skeletal "Nebraska."
But the record's slow-burning inten
sity packs a significant punch, and it
includes two of her most stunning
songs yet, "You Come Through"
and"The Desperate Kingdom Of
Love."

16) Mos Dcf: The New Danger
Is the half-a-decade-in-the
making "The New Danger" flaw
less? Far from it. But you're
bound to make some missteps
when you try to combine revolu
tionary politics with the history of
American black music. This is the
kind of fascinating, challenging
record that critics love to call "un
focused." Fuck that. This moody,
rough-edged gem shifts and sub
verts the idea of hip hop so many
times that it makes Mos Def's
beloved solo debut "Black On
Both Sides" feel like escapist fluff.
He used to be content to sit back
and kick knowledge; now he's
mad as hell, and he's not gonna
take it anymore.

15) The Arcade Fire: Funeral
The leap that The Arcade Fire
took from their debut seven song
EP to "Funeral," their first LP, is a
perfect example of how art is made
in the details. While the songs that
comprise this quasi-concept album
are all pretty great to begin with,
it's the small touches — the gentle
accordion in "Neighborhood 2
(Laika)," the gorgeous melody
plinked out on a xylophone in
"Haiti," the furious drum pro
gramming in "Neighborhood 3
(Power Out)" — that send them
over the top into genius territory.
It's a far cry from the generic indie
folk they were playing just a year
ago.

14) Grand National: Kicking The
National Habit
Speaking of gorgeous melodies
plinked out on unconventional in
struments, Grand National banged
the crap out of bells, pianos, steel
drums and whatever else it took to
become the most original new band
of 2004. Though nothing else on
"Kicking The National Habit" can
top its flat-out brilliant opening
track, the Caribbean Britpop hoe
down "Cherry Tree," it's a diverse
collection of tunes that runs the
gamut from Simon & Garfunkel
homages (the head-swaying
"Leaves") to would-be radio hits fea
turing Dixieland jazz horn sections
(just try to get "Playing In The Dis
tance" out of your head).

13) Hjork: Medulla
If you don't get Bjork by now,
you might as well give up. With
"Medulla," the most misunderstood
record of the year, she even lost the
critical fan base that has lavished her
with praise throughout her solo ca
reer. I'm astounded by the number of
people who couldn't see the forest for
the trees here; sure, it's all voices, but
it's Bjork's return to the avant garde
pop that fans of "Post" have been
missing for years! Though I loved
"Homogenic" and "Vespertine," I
secretly wanted something I could
sing along to in the car, and "Who Is
It"and "Triumph Of A Heart" are
more bubblegum than "Big Time
Sensuality."

12) Morrissey: You Are The Quarry
"You Are The Quarry" is the best
record Morrissey's ever recorded on
his own, and the best record he's been
involved with since The Smiths' "The
Queen Is Dead" way back in 1986.
While his previous solo albums were
packed with rockabilly filler, "Quar
ry" effortlessly glides between politi
cal rants, seductive trip hop and oper
atic glam rock without offering up a
single throwaway track. And don't
worry, he hasn't cheered up, as evi
denced by the exquisite self pity of
"The World Is Full Of Crashing
Bores" and "How Could Anybody
Possibly Know How I Feel?"

11) Fran/ Ferdinand: self-titled &
The Killers: Hot Fuss
For some reason, mainstream
rock radio decided to stop playing
phonetically-named hacks like
Trapt and Staind long enough to
work Franz Ferdinand's "Take
Me Out" and The Killers' "Some
body Told Me" into the mix of the
seven songs that they play on an
endless loop. And though they
played them so many times that
nobody ever wants to hear either
one ever again, the albums are
still great. I can't believe that
Franz Ferdinand's record compa
ny hasn't turned "Auf Achse"
into a top 10 single, and The
Killers' 80s revivalism hits a high
point on the best guilty pleasure
Duran Duran never recorded,
"On Top."
