## 
### BONNIE SWIFT 
Members of the Stanford com
munity came together yesterday in
a candlelight vigil in remembrance
of the victims of the recent
tsunamis that struck South Asia. In
addition to remembering Graduate
School of Business student James
Hsu, people also mourned the loss
es of friends and family and the

150,000 who have died in that re
gion since the Dec. 26 disaster. The
event was sponsored the Office of
Religious Life.
Many at the vigil emphasized
the opportunity to display compas
sion and offer help to those suffer
ing.
Lori Elder, a Business School
student, compared the unexpected
death of her friend, Hsu, to the

story of Leland Stanford, Jr.
"From the darkness of loss there
is an opportunity to create some
thing positive, something greater
than ourselves," she said.
A number of Business School
students have organized to raise
$50,000 in honor of their missing
friend. All of it will be donated as
relief funds to victims of the
tsunamis in South Asia.

"Grieving takes time and is
painful," Elder said. "But following
a tragedy such as this is an opportu
nity to hand together in a spirit of
generosity."
University President John Hen
nessy also challenged attendees to
provide for those in need.
"Committing to help the living is
the best way to honor the dead," he
said.
Hennessy has donated $5,000 of
his own money to the relief effort.
He encouraged others to respond to
the needs of others by giving to orga
nizations that are helping people in
the affected countries.
People of all religious back
grounds were encouraged to attend
the ceremony. At the end of the vigil.
Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann
said that rituals are a way to mark
times of celebration and loss, men
tioning that a similar vigil took place
in Memorial Church after the atroc
ities of September 11,2001.
Jack Hubbard of the Stanford
News Service said that the purpose
of a ceremony is to enable a commu
nity to share in grief and pain, so that

Relief efforts
emphasized

its members may endure as individu
als in the face of loss.
"That's what these guys do,"
Hubbard said. "That's the service
that the Office for Religious Life
provides for the Stanford communi
ty."
In the program for the vigil, the
audience was encouraged to send
money to the American Red Cross
designated for the "South Asia Re
lief Effort." Stanford United Relief
Effort, an umbrella group at Stan
ford comprised of eight to 10 student
groups, will collect funds for both
the short term and the long term re
lief efforts in South Asia.
The Haas Center for Public Ser
vice, the Office of Student Affairs
and the ASSU are all cooperating
with the group.
