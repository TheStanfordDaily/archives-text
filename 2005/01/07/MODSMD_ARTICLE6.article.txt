# Class-shopping receives scrutiny

"It's typically American. It's
competitive and gives the choice to
the consumer," said Religious Stud
ies Prof. Michael Zimmermann.
commenting on the shopping system
for classes at Stanford.
During the first two weeks of
every quarter, shopping takes on a
whole new meaning for Stanford stu
dents— one that has nothing to do
with merchandise. Instead of trying
on outfits, students try out multiple
classes before deciding on a final
schedule, sometimes as many as six
to eight in a given day.
Stanford's shopping system is rel
atively unusual among universities,
and both students and faculty have
strong responses regarding this op
portunity. According to junior Vi
neet Bhagwat. a head peer academic
coordinator at Larkin. students

mainly fall into two groups.
"Some students overdo the shop
ping process and shop too many
classes and are too indecisive to pick
three or four, whereas some students
don't shop at all and decide at the be
ginning," Bhagwat said. "Overall,
having a glimpse of the first two lec
tures and the professor is benefi
cial."
On the whole, students say they
enjoy the freedom to shop classes,
but admittedly find the experience
somewhat stressful.
"Shopping techie classes can
leave you kind of behind." said
freshman Chris Hain. "I'm in Math
53 and we've had a few lectures. I'm
already lost, and I've actually attend
ed class. I couldn't imagine jumping
in now."
"I like shopping, but on the first
day of class I went to six hours of
class, which left me really tired."

added freshman Lisa Hisaw.
For faculty, students coming into
class near the end of the shopping
period is a distressing trend.
"It's terrible," said Psychology
Prof. Ewart Thomas, who teaches
more than 350 students in Introduc
tion to Statistics. "In this course,
when students miss the three to four
beginning lectures, they are at a de
cided disadvantage. This is a subject
that's cumulative, and after missing
lectures students are in catch-up
mode for the rest of the quarter."
University Registrar Roger Print
up says the problem is particularly
pronounced because Stanford is on a
quarter system.
"There's a shifting cast of people
in and out of a course," he said.
"Sometimes students expect faculty
will keep on repeating material dur-
ing the first two weeks, but with the quar
ter system being only ten weeks, every
week and class day is important. There is
no way faculty can give students private
tutorials after two weeks of class."
Faculty members also find that the
shopping system often unjustly leaves
them with only one chance to make an
impression on the student.
"It makes professors more like sell
ers," Zimmermann said. "We shouldn't
have to sell our course on the first class.
The shopping period is basically a good
idea, but needs to be shortened to one
week."

Profs see flaws
in system

In many ways, students feel similarly,
and many shop only briefly and rarely.
Many students plan ahead — sometimes
for an entire academic year or their en
tire undergraduate careers.
Printup finds that these concerns are
making students use Axess earlier,
which he says is a pleasing change from
years past.
"Most students are enrolling before
the quarter starts," Printup said. "This
shows that students are thinking more
about classes. In reality, most students
are settled by the first week of class and
they should be."
