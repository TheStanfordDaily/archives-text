# Students turn to Web to avoid Bookstore prices
## 
### ANNY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Financial Aid Office esti
mates that Stanford students will
pay approximately $1,215 for
textbooks and other class sup
plies this academic year.
The first place on campus
most students visit to purchase
books for the quarter is the
Bookstore. But some students,
dissatisfied with high prices at
the Stanford Bookstore, have
been looking recently to the
small but growing number of
peer-to-peer textbook exchange
networks.
According to Cliff Ewert, vice
president of public and campus
relations of Follett, the company
that runs the Bookstore, the
store strives to be the place stu
dents go for all their books and
other scholastic items.
"I usually buy my textbooks
from the bookstore or online
from amazon.com or half.com,"
sophomore Shaw Yean Lim said.

"You can get better deals online
compared to the Bookstore,
sometimes even at less than half
the price for used books."
The Bookstore also buys back
used books fora percentage of
the purchase price. According to
Ewert. books that will be needed
for the next quarter are pur
chased at 50 percent of the pur
chase price, while others are gen
erally bought back for 10 to 30
percent of the purchase price
and sent to a used-book whole
saler. However, several students
say they are not happy with these
buy-back policies.
"I wouldn't sell my books
back to the campus store,"
sophomore Danny Deasis said.
"They wanted to give me $40 fo£
a textbook 1 paid $100 for. The
only time I touched the book was
to take the plastic off."
Deasis is currently looking to
sell this book to another student
by word of mouth.

Last year, the ASSU launched a program to buy back
select books at the end of a quarter and then sell them back
to students at the beginning of the next quarter. This pro
gram, according to former ASSU Vice President senior
Joey Natoli, was (iiscontinued after considering the risks,
costs and time investment involved.
Several budding entrepreneurs, however, have launched
Web sites that connect students looking to buy and sell their
textbooks for better prices. There are currently three free
book exchange sites that target the Stanford community.
ComeGetUsed.com
ComeGetUsed.com was founded by UC-Berkeley grad
uate Tim Lan. Class of 2003, who conceived of the idea dur
ing his freshman year.
"I was surprised by the high cost of textbooks and the
lack of a medium for students to buy and sell textbooks to
each other easily," Lan said.'i saw a lot of fliers and forum
posts for selling textbooks, but these were hardly the most
effective means for such a purpose."
After registering with an e-mail address, students can
immediately post their books for sale or search for texts by
title, author, ISBN number or course name. Buyers can then
contact the sellers through the site, ask questions and set up a
transaction.
"They can decide on their own how to buy or sell the
textbooks once thev contact each other," Lan said. "Some

of the mediums I have heard are money, treating to a meal,
trading books for books and so on."
Initially launched in February 2002 at Berkeley, it quick
ly gained popularity and was opened to other interested
schools the following year. Currently, the site serves stu
dents at eight schools, including 7,426 registered users at
Berkeley and 229 users at Stanford.
The Web site has over 43,000 books listed at the
moment, totaling over $1.4 million in inventory value and
has seen over $727,000 change hands, Lan said.
Stanford sophomore Arran Blattel joined the Web site
this past fall after he heard about it through e-mails. Since
then, he has posted some of his books on the Web site
because of his dissatisfaction with the Bookstore's buy
back program, he said, and he encourages other Stanford
students to join.
"I figured there was nothing to lose by joining," Blattel said.
"The bigger its membership gets, the more useful it will be."
Textopedia.com
Textopedia.com is a similar book exchange Web site that
was designed exclusively for the Stanford community. It was
launched last month by Stanford junior Vinay Mahagaokar.
As with comegetused.com, users just need to register with a
Stanford e-mail address, then wili be able to post books and
search for texts by author, title, ISBN number and class.
"It has a very simple and clean interface, allowing stu
dents to spend as little time as possible on the site to post
or find the books they need," Mahagaokar said.
He noted that the Web site includes a message system
for students to communicate about a posting. Additionally,
it has a feedback system, allowing students to rate their
experience in dealing with other students with whom they
have exchanged books.
Mahagoakar started the project about a year ago after

finding himself frustrated with the Bookstore and the has
sles of ordering books online.
"I got sick of paying high prices A the Bookstore, and
I could not afford to wait a week to get my books in the
mail," he said. "I realized that if we had an online system
like Textopedia, 1 would easily be able to buy used books at
the cheapest prices."
There are currently over 500 books posted on the site
and about 500 registered users.
"As long as people are having good experiences, I expect
the site will spread," Mahagaokar predicted. "Within a few
quarters, I believe Textopedia will be Stanford students'
first place to go to when buying books, because you get the
best prices and you can get your books immediately."
ScrewßookPrices.com
Just this past Wednesday, ScrewßookPrices.com opened
to the Stanford community. President and founder of the
site Dominic Son visited Stanford on Wednesday to pro
mote the site outside of the bookstore.
"It all started with a pizza I couldn't afford because of
book prices," Son explained. "I feel like the domain name
does something, it invokes an emotion in all of us."
The site was launched last May and serves 26 California
universities and colleges, including Stanford. There are
almost 2,000 registered users, and over 3,700 books have
been posted since this past fall. As with the other sites, after
a simple registration and confirmation process, students are
welcome to post and search for books.
"The more books get added to Stanford's database, the
better ScrewßookPrices.com will work," Son said. "That is
dependant on the students. We find that when students set
their own prices, and fellow students buy from that student,
it creates a win-win situation for both the buver and seller."

"As long as people are having good experiences, I expect
the site will spread," Mahagaokar predicted. "Within a few
quarters, I believe Textopedia will be Stanford students'
first place to go to when buying books, because you get the
best prices and you can get your books immediately."
ScrewßookPrices.com
Just this past Wednesday, ScrewßookPrices.com opened
to the Stanford community. President and founder of the
site Dominic Son visited Stanford on Wednesday to pro
mote the site outside of the bookstore.
"It all started with a pizza I couldn't afford because of
book prices," Son explained. "I feel like the domain name
does something, it invokes an emotion in all of us."
The site was launched last May and serves 26 California
universities and colleges, including Stanford. There are
almost 2,000 registered users, and over 3,700 books have
been posted since this past fall. As with the other sites, after
a simple registration and confirmation process, students are
welcome to post and search for books.
"The more books get added to Stanford's database, the
better ScrewßookPrices.com will work," Son said. "That is
dependant on the students. We find that when students set
their own prices, and fellow students buy from that student,
it creates a win-win situation for both the buver and seller."
The Financial Aid Office esti
mates that Stanford students will
pay approximately $1,215 for
textbooks and other class sup
plies this academic year.
The first place on campus
most students visit to purchase
books for the quarter is the
Bookstore. But some students,
dissatisfied with high prices at
the Stanford Bookstore, have
been looking recently to the
small but growing number of
peer-to-peer textbook exchange
networks.
According to Cliff Ewert, vice
president of public and campus
relations of Follett, the company
that runs the Bookstore, the
store strives to be the place stu
dents go for all their books and
other scholastic items.
"I usually buy my textbooks
from the bookstore or online
from amazon.com or half.com,"
sophomore Shaw Yean Lim said.

"You can get better deals online
compared to the Bookstore,
sometimes even at less than half
the price for used books."
The Bookstore also buys back
used books fora percentage of
the purchase price. According to
Ewert. books that will be needed
for the next quarter are pur
chased at 50 percent of the pur
chase price, while others are gen
erally bought back for 10 to 30
percent of the purchase price
and sent to a used-book whole
saler. However, several students
say they are not happy with these
buy-back policies.
"I wouldn't sell my books
back to the campus store,"
sophomore Danny Deasis said.
"They wanted to give me $40 fo£
a textbook 1 paid $100 for. The
only time I touched the book was
to take the plastic off."
Deasis is currently looking to
sell this book to another student
by word of mouth.

Last year, the ASSU launched a program to buy back
select books at the end of a quarter and then sell them back
to students at the beginning of the next quarter. This pro
gram, according to former ASSU Vice President senior
Joey Natoli, was (iiscontinued after considering the risks,
costs and time investment involved.
Several budding entrepreneurs, however, have launched
Web sites that connect students looking to buy and sell their
textbooks for better prices. There are currently three free
book exchange sites that target the Stanford community.
ComeGetUsed.com
ComeGetUsed.com was founded by UC-Berkeley grad
uate Tim Lan. Class of 2003, who conceived of the idea dur
ing his freshman year.
"I was surprised by the high cost of textbooks and the
lack of a medium for students to buy and sell textbooks to
each other easily," Lan said.'i saw a lot of fliers and forum
posts for selling textbooks, but these were hardly the most
effective means for such a purpose."
After registering with an e-mail address, students can
immediately post their books for sale or search for texts by
title, author, ISBN number or course name. Buyers can then
contact the sellers through the site, ask questions and set up a
transaction.
"They can decide on their own how to buy or sell the
textbooks once thev contact each other," Lan said. "Some

of the mediums I have heard are money, treating to a meal,
trading books for books and so on."
Initially launched in February 2002 at Berkeley, it quick
ly gained popularity and was opened to other interested
schools the following year. Currently, the site serves stu
dents at eight schools, including 7,426 registered users at
Berkeley and 229 users at Stanford.
The Web site has over 43,000 books listed at the
moment, totaling over $1.4 million in inventory value and
has seen over $727,000 change hands, Lan said.
Stanford sophomore Arran Blattel joined the Web site
this past fall after he heard about it through e-mails. Since
then, he has posted some of his books on the Web site
because of his dissatisfaction with the Bookstore's buy
back program, he said, and he encourages other Stanford
students to join.
"I figured there was nothing to lose by joining," Blattel said.
"The bigger its membership gets, the more useful it will be."
Textopedia.com
Textopedia.com is a similar book exchange Web site that
was designed exclusively for the Stanford community. It was
launched last month by Stanford junior Vinay Mahagaokar.
As with comegetused.com, users just need to register with a
Stanford e-mail address, then wili be able to post books and
search for texts by author, title, ISBN number and class.
"It has a very simple and clean interface, allowing stu
dents to spend as little time as possible on the site to post
or find the books they need," Mahagaokar said.
He noted that the Web site includes a message system
for students to communicate about a posting. Additionally,
it has a feedback system, allowing students to rate their
experience in dealing with other students with whom they
have exchanged books.
Mahagoakar started the project about a year ago after

finding himself frustrated with the Bookstore and the has
sles of ordering books online.
"I got sick of paying high prices A the Bookstore, and
I could not afford to wait a week to get my books in the
mail," he said. "I realized that if we had an online system
like Textopedia, 1 would easily be able to buy used books at
the cheapest prices."
There are currently over 500 books posted on the site
and about 500 registered users.
"As long as people are having good experiences, I expect
the site will spread," Mahagaokar predicted. "Within a few
