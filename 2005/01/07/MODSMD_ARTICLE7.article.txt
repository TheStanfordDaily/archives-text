# Students turn to Web to avoid Bookstore prices

### ANNY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Financial Aid Office esti
mates that Stanford students will
pay approximately $1,215 for
textbooks and other class sup
plies this academic year.
The first place on campus
most students visit to purchase
books for the quarter is the
Bookstore. But some students,
dissatisfied with high prices at
the Stanford Bookstore, have
been looking recently to the
small but growing number of
peer-to-peer textbook exchange
networks.
According to Cliff Ewert, vice
president of public and campus
relations of Follett, the company
that runs the Bookstore, the
store strives to be the place stu
dents go for all their books and
other scholastic items.
"I usually buy my textbooks
from the bookstore or online
from amazon.com or half.com,"
sophomore Shaw Yean Lim said.

"You can get better deals online
compared to the Bookstore,
sometimes even at less than half
the price for used books."
The Bookstore also buys back
used books fora percentage of
the purchase price. According to
Ewert. books that will be needed
for the next quarter are pur
chased at 50 percent of the pur
chase price, while others are gen
erally bought back for 10 to 30
percent of the purchase price
and sent to a used-book whole
saler. However, several students
say they are not happy with these
buy-back policies.
"I wouldn't sell my books
back to the campus store,"
sophomore Danny Deasis said.
"They wanted to give me $40 foÂ£
a textbook 1 paid $100 for. The
only time I touched the book was
to take the plastic off."
Deasis is currently looking to
sell this book to another student
by word of mouth.
