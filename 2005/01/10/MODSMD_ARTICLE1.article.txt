# Number of early applicants rises again
## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Office of Undergraduate Admission
announced last month that 867 high school se
niors have been offered admission into the
Class of 2009. The students, who applied
through Stanford's early action admission pro
gram. were chosen from an applicant pool of
over 4,330.
Applications rose from around 4,100 last
year, an increase of almost 6 percent. This
year's numbers reflected yet another increase
in early applications at Stanford, a trend
brought about by Stanford's change from bind
ing early decision to the non-binding single
choice early action two years ago.
Compared to the number of applications in
2002, the last year of the early decision pro
gram. there were almost 2,000 more this year.
This year's increase was substantially less
than last year's spike of 62 percent. However,
Yale University, which also switched from
early decision to single-choice early action two
years, saw a three percent drop in early applica
tions this year.
Stanford admitted almost 20 percent of early
applicants this year, a slight increase from the
19.5 percent admitted early last year. In the
final year of Stanford's early decision program,
24 percent of applicants were admitted.
Still, early applicants are admitted at a high

er rate than those who apply during the regular
admission period.
Director of Admission Anne Marie Por
ras told The New York Times that she ex
pects 15,000 more applicants during regular
review, and that around 13 percent will be
admitted.
Last year, Stanford admitted 12.6 percent of
applicants into the class of 2008. Early action
students comprised nearly one-third of total ad
mission offers made.
In a press release released in December,
Porras said that this year's numbers validate the
switch to single-choice early action.
"It is clear that these students have em
braced this non-binding, first-choice option as
an opportunity to conduct thorough and
thoughtful college searches," she said in a press
release. "Our admitted students are confident
that Stanford is the right fit for them intellectu
ally and personally, and their applications show
they have the curiosity and readiness to thrive
here."
Under the terms of single-choice early ac
tion, applicants may only apply to Stanford dur
ing the early admission period. Students may
apply to other universities during the regular
admission period and have until May 1 to con
firm their enrollment if admitted.
Students who applied under Stanford's reg
ular review admission period will find out if
they are offered admission in April.
