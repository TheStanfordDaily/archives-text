# Playing it Straight
## New Year, Old Talk 
### 
/ "W "W" T"hat's up, dude? How
• % / was your break?" You
%/ answer with the rou-
T ▼ tine "Not much, dude,
just rested" response. Here we go again
There's nothing like coming back to
campus. It makes you realize how de
pendent we all are on small talk, the
generally useless drivel that melts away
social awkwardness. We casually ex
change our pleasantries like Chi Theta
Chi residents exchange chlamydia.
Once in a while, you'll hear a pretty
good response that is not as cookie-cut
ter and trite as the old tricks you use. So
you save it and use it later — like the
bad gift that you're pawning off on the
in-laws next year.

Everyone
"makes small
talk." Even
this phrase
points to its in
herent artifi
cial nature.
You make it.
You listen to
it. Then we all
go our sepa
rate ways.
Don't get us
wrong; small
talk isn't bad.
In fact, it's
good. It lubri
cates. It's an

agreement that we all buy into some
how or another, a sort of Rousseau
esque social contract that only works if
we all agree to "make" it.
In this week's column of banter, we
venture to explore a world without
small talk. We hope that our controlled
and imaginative experimental scenar
ios — a holiday party and a senior pub
night — show that it takes two to do the
small-talk tango.
The holiday party is always a fun
time, especially if you're not the host
but an observer of the wonderfully
painful dynamics that only family,
friends and alcohol can bring to the sit
uation.
Aside from all the eggnog, mistletoe
and hideous holiday attire, these festiv
ities can be (and often are) explosive
catalysts that open the fissures of child
hood jealousy, marriage strife and the
post-college falling out. What keeps it
all together? Small talk.
Imagine you're talking to your
friend's uncle, let's call him Mr. Dinkle,
whojust flew in from Buffalo, NY. He's
making small talk. You're not.
"Hey there, sport! Great to see you
again. Now where are you off at school
again? Stanford, was it?" Mr. Dinkle
pleasantly inquires. You respond with a
quick nod.
"Great place. Great program.
What's your major?" A natural and to
tally suitable follow-up question.
"Uh, it's called Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity."
"Good show! And what exactly does
that mean?"
"Well, basically it's where you learn
how to explain to middle-aged assholes
what your major is all about."
End of conversation.
Not abundantly different in nature
from your classic holiday shebang is the
college equivalent of your elementary
school field trips to the (heavy) petting
zoo — Senior Pub Night.
Admittedly, the crowd is slightly
thinner and more fashionable, and the
background music is more Jay-Z than
Kenny G. But there remains the same
potentially awkward dynamic and so
cial cure-all, small talk.
Now you're perusing the dance floor,
Pabst Blue in hand, when a guy you
vaguely remember from a freshman
year seminar chest bumps you.
"What up. dude? How are you!
Damn, it's loud in here. Rockin'! How
long have you been here?"
"Too long. I was good until I showed
up here. My best friend dragged me
out. Just was not in the mood. You?"
"Do you know Dellen? Over there.
She's pretty hot."
"Don't know her. but you don't have
a Pro Fro's chance at Pi Phi. Take it
easy, bro!" End of conversation.
Next time you find yourself ques
tioning the sincerity of your small talk,
just remember that it doesn't really
matter. They don't care either.

friends and alcohol can bring to the sit
uation.
Aside from all the eggnog, mistletoe
and hideous holiday attire, these festiv
ities can be (and often are) explosive
catalysts that open the fissures of child
hood jealousy, marriage strife and the
post-college falling out. What keeps it
all together? Small talk.
Imagine you're talking to your
friend's uncle, let's call him Mr. Dinkle,
whojust flew in from Buffalo, NY. He's
making small talk. You're not.
"Hey there, sport! Great to see you
again. Now where are you off at school
again? Stanford, was it?" Mr. Dinkle
pleasantly inquires. You respond with a
quick nod.
"Great place. Great program.
What's your major?" A natural and to
tally suitable follow-up question.
"Uh, it's called Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity."
"Good show! And what exactly does
that mean?"
"Well, basically it's where you learn
how to explain to middle-aged assholes
what your major is all about."
End of conversation.
Not abundantly different in nature
from your classic holiday shebang is the
college equivalent of your elementary
school field trips to the (heavy) petting
zoo — Senior Pub Night.
Admittedly, the crowd is slightly
thinner and more fashionable, and the
background music is more Jay-Z than
Kenny G. But there remains the same
potentially awkward dynamic and so
cial cure-all, small talk.
Now you're perusing the dance floor,
Pabst Blue in hand, when a guy you
vaguely remember from a freshman
year seminar chest bumps you.
"What up. dude? How are you!
Damn, it's loud in here. Rockin'! How
long have you been here?"
"Too long. I was good until I showed
up here. My best friend dragged me
out. Just was not in the mood. You?"
"Do you know Dellen? Over there.
She's pretty hot."
"Don't know her. but you don't have
a Pro Fro's chance at Pi Phi. Take it
easy, bro!" End of conversation.
Next time you find yourself ques
tioning the sincerity of your small talk,
just remember that it doesn't really
matter. They don't care either.

T ▼ tine "Not much, dude,
just rested" response. Here we go again
There's nothing like coming back to
campus. It makes you realize how de
pendent we all are on small talk, the
generally useless drivel that melts away
social awkwardness. We casually ex
change our pleasantries like Chi Theta
Chi residents exchange chlamydia.
Once in a while, you'll hear a pretty
good response that is not as cookie-cut
ter and trite as the old tricks you use. So
you save it and use it later — like the
bad gift that you're pawning off on the
in-laws next year.

Everyone
"makes small
talk." Even
this phrase
points to its in
herent artifi
cial nature.
You make it.
You listen to
it. Then we all
go our sepa
rate ways.
Don't get us
wrong; small
talk isn't bad.
In fact, it's
good. It lubri
cates. It's an

agreement that we all buy into some
how or another, a sort of Rousseau
esque social contract that only works if
we all agree to "make" it.
In this week's column of banter, we
venture to explore a world without
small talk. We hope that our controlled
and imaginative experimental scenar
ios — a holiday party and a senior pub
night — show that it takes two to do the
small-talk tango.
The holiday party is always a fun
time, especially if you're not the host
but an observer of the wonderfully
painful dynamics that only family,
friends and alcohol can bring to the sit
uation.
