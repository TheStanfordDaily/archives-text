# Inphanyte...
## Student-produced label grows 
### COURTNEY WEAVER 
Forget about camping out for the next American Idol au
ditions. For your chance at musical stardom, look no further
than to seniors Frederick Alexander and Jonathan Jones, the
founders of Stanford's first record label, Inphanyte.
Inphanyte, whose name stems from Alexander and Jones'
life philosophy regarding the infinity of faith and the merits
of infinite hard work, got its start when the two students were
working together for Stanford University Recording Group
Entertainers their sophomore year. Alexander and Jones
said they saw a need fora record label that would expose stu
dents to various aspects of the music industry, such as distri
bution and advertising.
"There are so many facets of the music industry," Alexan
der said. "Music is not just about notes."
Interning at Universal Records the summer after his
sophomore year introduced Jones to the record-producing
industry. There, he developed a relationship with producer
Russell Gatewood, who mentored Jones and Alexander.
The two students then set about drafting applications for
positions on the label and circulated them electronically
around campus the following fall. They received dozens of
responses. They accepted a team of roughly 35 to 40 students
and divided them into three main divisions: distribution and
advertisement, management and production.
Inphanyte's management spent the winter quarter of the
2003-2004 academic year putting together a hip-hop compi
lation featuring Stanford artists such as seniors Ron Ragin
and Jidenna Mobisson and junior Jim Chitty. They spent an
average of 15 hours per week writing song lyrics, deciding the
album theme and creating a design for the album cover. They
also helped coordinate collaborations between the different
artists.
Though a non-profit organization, Inphanyte was able to
use recording studios on the Stanford campus and financed
the distribution of the free CDs through a grant from the
ASSU.
"Without [the ASSU] it would never have been possible,"
Alexander said. "They're the reason the project existed."
Alexander pointed out that the non-profit aspect of the
label is a fundamental principle of its existence.
"The intended purpose was not to profit but to get the
CDs out into the hands of A&R [Record labels' scouting
groups]," he said. "We're using what the University gave us
as a launch pad for the artists."
Inphanyte, in that respect, has been relatively successful
so far. The label has put Alexander, an artist himself, in con
tact with one A&R group. Though this may not result in an
actual record contract, Alexander said it bodes well for rela
tionships with other A&R groups in the future.
"It's all about bridging, because building a relationship
with'one A&R is not always the end deal," Alexander
said.
With Inphanyte's second year well under way, the team
is already at work putting together this year's compilation.

"Students will be very pleased [with the second album]
and continue to be astonished at the level of talent that's here
on campus," Alexander said.
Though the music will still be in the R&B / Hip-Hop
genre, the management has once again chosen artists "with a
diverse background of music," Alexander said.
One change the management plans to implement is to
allow the artists to decide if they want to collaborate with one
another.
"That's what it's all about," he said. "It's about giving [the
artists] the opportunity to do what they want."
This includes the possibility of letting individuals record
their own compilations, which Alexander said might occur in
the future.
"If the artist is motivated enough, we're more than will
ing to get the name out there and give them a helping hand,"
he said. "1 wouldn't be surprised if three or four years from

now I turn on the TV and see some Stanford alumni who
were part of Inphanyte."
For now, though, Alexander and Jones have other aspects of
their lives to worry about outside of the label. Both graduate this
June and are aspiring MBA students, yet neither plans to quit
his involvement with Inphanyte.
Alexander also said he hopes to spread Inphanyte to col
leges across the country.
"I don't know any other group that's like this and doing
what we're doing and at this level," he said.
Alexander hopes that the label will be able to fulfill its
founding principle in other communities as well.
"The purpose of Inphanyte was to make Stanford a more
artistic presence in [the local] community," he said. "There's
a lot of talent in the [Stanford community), and Jonathan and
I wanted to channel that talent."

his involvement with Inphanyte.
Alexander also said he hopes to spread Inphanyte to col
leges across the country.
"I don't know any other group that's like this and doing
what we're doing and at this level," he said.
Alexander hopes that the label will be able to fulfill its
founding principle in other communities as well.
"The purpose of Inphanyte was to make Stanford a more
artistic presence in [the local] community," he said. "There's
a lot of talent in the [Stanford community), and Jonathan and
I wanted to channel that talent."

Inphanvte founders, seniors Frederick Alexander, left, and Jonathan Jones, produced the first record under the student-run label
in 2003-2004. After the two graduate, management of the label will be passed down.
Forget about camping out for the next American Idol au
ditions. For your chance at musical stardom, look no further
than to seniors Frederick Alexander and Jonathan Jones, the
founders of Stanford's first record label, Inphanyte.
Inphanyte, whose name stems from Alexander and Jones'
life philosophy regarding the infinity of faith and the merits
of infinite hard work, got its start when the two students were
working together for Stanford University Recording Group
Entertainers their sophomore year. Alexander and Jones
said they saw a need fora record label that would expose stu
dents to various aspects of the music industry, such as distri
bution and advertising.
"There are so many facets of the music industry," Alexan
der said. "Music is not just about notes."
Interning at Universal Records the summer after his
sophomore year introduced Jones to the record-producing
industry. There, he developed a relationship with producer
Russell Gatewood, who mentored Jones and Alexander.
The two students then set about drafting applications for
positions on the label and circulated them electronically
around campus the following fall. They received dozens of
responses. They accepted a team of roughly 35 to 40 students
and divided them into three main divisions: distribution and
advertisement, management and production.
Inphanyte's management spent the winter quarter of the
2003-2004 academic year putting together a hip-hop compi
lation featuring Stanford artists such as seniors Ron Ragin
and Jidenna Mobisson and junior Jim Chitty. They spent an
average of 15 hours per week writing song lyrics, deciding the
album theme and creating a design for the album cover. They
also helped coordinate collaborations between the different
artists.
Though a non-profit organization, Inphanyte was able to
use recording studios on the Stanford campus and financed
the distribution of the free CDs through a grant from the
ASSU.
"Without [the ASSU] it would never have been possible,"
Alexander said. "They're the reason the project existed."
Alexander pointed out that the non-profit aspect of the
label is a fundamental principle of its existence.
"The intended purpose was not to profit but to get the
CDs out into the hands of A&R [Record labels' scouting
groups]," he said. "We're using what the University gave us
as a launch pad for the artists."
Inphanyte, in that respect, has been relatively successful
so far. The label has put Alexander, an artist himself, in con
tact with one A&R group. Though this may not result in an
actual record contract, Alexander said it bodes well for rela
tionships with other A&R groups in the future.
"It's all about bridging, because building a relationship
with'one A&R is not always the end deal," Alexander
said.
With Inphanyte's second year well under way, the team
is already at work putting together this year's compilation.

"Students will be very pleased [with the second album]
and continue to be astonished at the level of talent that's here
on campus," Alexander said.
Though the music will still be in the R&B / Hip-Hop
genre, the management has once again chosen artists "with a
diverse background of music," Alexander said.
One change the management plans to implement is to
allow the artists to decide if they want to collaborate with one
another.
"That's what it's all about," he said. "It's about giving [the
artists] the opportunity to do what they want."
This includes the possibility of letting individuals record
their own compilations, which Alexander said might occur in
the future.
"If the artist is motivated enough, we're more than will
ing to get the name out there and give them a helping hand,"
he said. "1 wouldn't be surprised if three or four years from

now I turn on the TV and see some Stanford alumni who
were part of Inphanyte."
For now, though, Alexander and Jones have other aspects of
their lives to worry about outside of the label. Both graduate this
June and are aspiring MBA students, yet neither plans to quit
his involvement with Inphanyte.
Alexander also said he hopes to spread Inphanyte to col
leges across the country.
