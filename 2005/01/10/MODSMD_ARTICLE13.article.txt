# New URP guidelines for research grants

Senior Sarala Nagala was studying out
sourced call centers in India during the sum
mer and wanted to get to know the workers
better. So she went to one of their weddings.
She used her summer in India to learn about
the native culture and language while getting
to know call center workers.
Nagala. majoring in public policy, is one of
many Stanford students who receive grants
from the Undergraduate Research Pro
grams' Office to conduct independent re
search during their time at Stanford. Many of
the research projects involve travel away
from Stanford. â€¢
The URP offers grants and scholarships
up to $5,000 for students to conduct research
in various areas of academic interest through
out the year. These include Quarterly Grants,
Major Grants, Chappell Lougee Scholar
ships, Angel Grants and Conference Travel
Grants. Grant funding may support small
projects or preliminary research that may re
sult in a larger project that often culminates
in an honors thesis. The funding also covers
travel costs for students to present research at
scholarly conferences.
The Undergraduate Research Programs'
office recently developed new guidelines and
requirements for students conducting re
search off-campus. The level and quality of
pre-field preparation is now a more signifi
cant factor in the assessment of proposals and
applications, according to the URP Web site.
Renee Courey, associate director for stu
dent services at thq Undergraduate Research
Program's office, emphasized that the new
requirements are designed to help students
and that students should actively consult
their faculty advisers or the URP in preparing
their applications.
"Every student's requirements will be
different depending on the project, experi
ence and advice of the research sponsor."
Courey said. "There's almost always a way
to work things out. and students should
come talk to us as they're preparing their
applications."
Grant recipients are required to take at
least one 1-2 unit course on fieldwork issues
or general research methodologies. All stu

dents traveling off campus must also take a
1-2 unit class on general cultural, safety and
ethical issues. Students can also demon
strate preparedness by showing that they
have worked closely with a faculty member
over a period of time and be exempt from

the courses.
Students will also be required to attend
the URP's annual Pre-field Conference on
April 2, which will help students organize
their research design and provide them with

contacts in their areas of study.
Nagala said that she thinks the increased
emphasis on pre-field training will play a crit
ical role helping students to have a successful
research project.
"Small tips like obtaining a letter from the

President's Office certifying that I was from
Stanford or printing business cards with the
Stanford name were invaluable tips that I
never would have learned without a pre-field
course," Nagala said.

Senior Justin Sabet-Peyman, who is cur
rently working on research on emerging mar
kets, said he believes that the new require
ments will better prepare students for their
fieldwork.
"At the end of the day. I think that new re
quirements will benefit the students and their
projects," Sabet-Peyman said. "Fieldwork is
challenging on many levels, and it is helpful
to be able to anticipate some of the potential
pitfalls before it's too late."
Sabet-Peyman collected data by conduct
ing phone and in-person interviews. For the
first part of his project, he investigated East
ern Europe technology parks in Brno, Czech
Republic and Krakow, Poland. For the sec
ond part, he looked at the relationship be
tween economic development and freedom
in the Persian Gulf Region by doing a case
study of Dubai, where he traveled over win
ter break.
Senior Brigitte Zimmerman spent five
weeks in Malawi this past summer examining
the health care of orphans. Although she
took several classes prior to her trip that
helped her with statistical and background
knowledge, Zimmerman did not receive
training in field research methodology,
specifically in interviewing.
"While abroad 1 learned that field re
search in a foreign country and culture has a
unique set of challenges that I wasn't always
prepared to address," said Zimmerman. "1
came to believe I could have been more ef
fective if I had had some training in how best
to approach cultural differences and racial
and language barriers when conducting re
search abroad."
Both Sabet-Peyman and Zimmerman
agree that research has been an important
part of their Stanford experience and urge all
students to take advantage of the resources
available to them.
"Never again will we have such vast re
sources at our disposal to whimsically explore
something that we find interesting or intrigu
ing," Zimmerman said.
A list of appropriate pre-field training
courses offered winter and spring quarters,
as well as information about the applica
tion process, can be found on the IIRP's
Web site.
