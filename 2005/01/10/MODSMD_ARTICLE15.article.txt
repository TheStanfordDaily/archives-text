## Editorial PWR 2 course load must be balanced 
### 
Last year, the University
mandated that incoming
students take two quar
ters of classes from the
Program in Writing and
Rhetoric: PWR 1 as a freshman,
and PWR 2 as a freshman or
sophomore. Because PWR 1 is an
older program and has had more
time to work out any problems,
there are few inconsistencies be
tween classes.
However, the amount of work
that students have to do in PWR 2
differs greatly from class to class.
This variation is unfair to students.
Ideally, students should choose
a PWR 2 course on the basis of in
terest. However, because some
classes are easier than others, stu
dents often use difficulty as their
main criterion.
Because some students are
more focused on their grades than
on the skills that PWR can offer,
the inconsistency between classes
detracts from the goals of PWR 2:
to teach students to understand
and present arguments in multi
media.

Students in easy courses do
not acquire adequate skills,
while students in overly difficult
courses feel that their workload
is unfair. Neither situation is sat
isfactory: Students often either
learn too little and get a good
grade, or learn a lot, but receive
a bad grade. Clearly, equity is
not only in students' best inter
est, but also in the department's
best interest.
The easiest way to make PWR
2 courses equitable is to make
course workloads similar. Cur
rently, PWR 2 teachers are given
guidelines for three major pro
jects. However, teachers are not
required to follow these guide
lines.
As a result, projects in each
class take different amounts of
time to complete. For example,
one teacher might assign an audio
essay — a challenging, time-inten
sive task — while another teacher
might assign a collage.
PWR teachers also assign dif
ferent amounts of nightly home
work. The current system of

guidelines does not account for
this.
Regulation of coursework
would not be difficult. To make
course workloads more compara
ble, teachers should be required to
estimate the amount of time that
each homework assignment and
project for their class will take.
The Program in Writing in
Rhetoric should then ensure that
the workload for each class is
equal and equivalent to four units
of work.
Secondly, mid-quarter surveys
should be a required part of all
PWR 2 courses. Surveys could
give both the teacher and the de
partment feedback about course
difficulty and could be used as an
other tool to normalize the
amount of work given in PWR 2
classes.
Although the PWR 2 program
offers a wide variety of courses, it
must work to make classes equally
difficult. Until it does, the pro
gram will continue to lose credibil
ity among students searching for
the path of least resistance.
