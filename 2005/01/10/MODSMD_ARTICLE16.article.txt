# Student Pet Peeves
## Hey smartypants, give it a rest 
### YAMANDA WRIGHT 
You are among the best and the
brightest; remember that. The stu
dents here are so dazzling in fact,
that Residential Education sug
gests just living with them is more
valuable than taking a class, pre
sumably by some form of intellec
tual osmosis.
The next time your roommate
leaves his wet towel on your bed, be
sure to thank him kindly for the un
dergraduate experience. By virtue
of that damp spot on your mattress
he will inspire your first best-selling
novel, become your best man and
play chess with you at the city park
into your old age.
And in keeping with the work
hard, play-hard dogma that seems to
saturate university culture and insist
on the importance of your peers,
Stanford does something terrible to
them in the classroom.
The very same students who
party with you on the weekends be
come on Monday morning the most
annoying, condescending classmates
that a $4(),(HK) tuition can buy. A few

short hours and a dining hall break
fast is all it takes to transform the
best friend or cool girl at the CoHo
into a blubbering, arrogant intellec
tual-type.
No life-changing, captivating
course is complete without the
proverbial handful of know-it-alls
and think-they-know-it-alls, as if
with each acceptance letter came a
post office slip for smarty pants on
special order.
Generally, I've found that they
fall into three general categories:
The first kind of student is your
run-of-the-mill upperclassman. She
is enrolled in a lower-level introduc
tory course because she was too busy
fulfilling pre-med requirements to
shop a major freshman year.
Rather than interjecting with
wise comments every now and
then and working on her honors
thesis under the table like other se
niors, she exhales impatiently and
puts up her index finger to inter
rupt like it's her job. She thinks it
her duty to drop some knowledge
on the masses.
Second, there is the infamous

overachiever who is annoying not
because he is always more than pre
pared, but because his studiousness
overcasts everyone else's desperate
attempts to pretend like they did the
reading. He is the first to correct
your fudged statistics and "faulty
logic" when all you want to do is go
to lunch.
Last, there are the talkers. For
every meaningful comment there
are 20 minutes of participation
grade answers to fill the time. And at
the end of the class you are left
thinking that if a picture is worth a
thousand words, then you wish they
would just take a picture of B.S. and
save the rest of their classmates the
time and frustration.
Take a long, hard look at your
section / seminar behavior and de
termine whether you fall into one of
these categories. If your answer is
yes, it would behoove you to rethink
your intellectual wardrobe. You are
not allowed to irritate me.
