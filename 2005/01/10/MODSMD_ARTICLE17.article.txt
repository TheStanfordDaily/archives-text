# The 						Big Picture
## Critics too quick to attack U.S. aid 
### WILL NELSON 
Hours after the tsunamis struck
in Asia two weeks ago, a second
tsunami broke in the news media.
This media tsunami consisted of un
fair reports criticizing America's
contributions to the disaster relief
efforts as "miserly."
Secretary of State Colin Powell
consistently responded to such criti
cisms by saying the United States
would reevaluate contribution levels
as more information became avail
able and as the situation evolved.
Even now, with the U.S. govern
ment's pledge of direct support
standing at $350 million, Powell in
sists America will contribute much
more if necessary.
Many media reports seemed to
discount this perfectly reasonable
position. News stories often directly
linked the escalation of American
relief pledges with criticism from the
media and U.N. emergency relief co
ordinator Jan Egcland. rather than
attributing it to the government's
changing evaluation of needs.
We can never know what the
Bush administration would have
done had media criticism of Ameri
ca's contribution not been quite so
intense. But we can be pretty sure
that media reports lead many news
watchers to believe the administra
tion would have done absolutely

nothing.
No one doubts that Americans,
both as a nation and as individual
private citizens, should be very
generous in contributing to tsuna
mi relief efforts. With 156,000 esti
mated deaths so far, the scale of
the tragedy demands massive fi
nancial contributions from all
wealthy nations.
If the mind-blowing statistics are
not enough to compel generous re
sponses, the many media accounts of
victims' ordeals surely are.
Crushing water pressure tore an
infant son from the strongest grasp
his father could muster. Two sisters
watched as a wave ripped their terri
fied husbands from them forever.
There were no second chances for
these victims.
Others had second chances, but
relief organizations sadly failed
them. The New York Times recently
ran a heart-rending story in which a
doctor watched helplessly as a
woman died from blood loss after a
leg amputation. Transfusion of a few
pints of blood could have saved her,
but none was available.
No one — the U.N., the World
Bank, or the United States — was
there to give her the blood she need
ed. A crate full of $100 bills dropped
next to her table would have been
worthless to her unless it also con
tained a few pints of transfusable

blood.
That is why it was ludicrous for
critics like Jan Egeland to label the
United States "stingy" just hours
after the tragedy struck. Funding
pledges would have done little good
in those early days of intense media
criticism. Time-critical resources
like transport helicopters and rescue
equipment were needed at that time,
and 1 surely hope the United States
delivered such capabilities as fast as
it could.
But critics like The New York
Times editorial page were alarmed
that the United States had not rec
ognized the urgency of pledging
money, as if a dollar pledged in
Washington on Tuesday equaled a
pint of blood delivered in Banda
Aceh on Wednesday.
Powell said from the beginning
of this crisis that America would
constantly reassess funding needs
and make additional contributions
as necessary. So far in this tragedy,
his word has been good, and I hope
this continues. Americans can be
proud of our nation's generous
contributions of money, person
nel, expertise and other resources
to the victims of this historic
tragedy.
