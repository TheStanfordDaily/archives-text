# Smoke and Mirrors Aside...
## Jon Stewart, defender of responsible journalism 
### 
Probably nobody expected
that Jon Stewart's persis
tent bashing of the black
and-white, you-versus-me
news talk show establishment would
have resulted in anything more than
some celebration and cheers. But
last week Tucker Carlson's greatest
nightmare came true when
Jonathan Klein, the new president
of CNN, fired the bow-tied fixture
and cancelled the 23-year-running
show, "Crossfire."
For readers who are learning this
for the first time, I am not making

this up. Immedi
ately when I
heard, I thought
the cancella
tion's timing was
merely a coinci
dence.
But judging
from Klein's
comments, the
move was trig
gered in large
part by the outcry

following Stewart's appearance.
Klein told the Associated Press he
was "firmly in the Jon Stewart
camp"and agreed "wholeheartedly
with [the] overall premise" that the
show was — as Stewart would say —
"hurting America."
The entrance of ratings-obsessed
entertainment executives into the
news industry spells disaster, and
that should he obvious to conserva
tive and liberal observers alike.
Klein should be applauded for
standing up to the incendiary and
listless talk-show culture that has
encroached on ground otherwise
trod by fresh and meaningful news
reporting.
His stance will hopefully resolve
the identity crisis that developed at
CNN as Fox News began becoming
known as its more popular competi
tor. Klein's decision not to compete
with Fox tit-for-tat should relieve
Americans who might have other
wise feared that CNN would join
Fox's race to the bottom.
It is dangerous to fuse opinion
into news reporting and frame every
issue as if there are two equally vi
able sides. Angry activists on the
right have been highly effective in

convincing news agencies that they
have ingrained leftist biases that can
only be balanced by lending more
exposure to conservative opinions,
as ill-informed and incongruent
with the facts as they may be.
Although it feels good to believe
there are two sides, it is the re
porter's duty to dig deep to find the
truth. Democracy depends on a
media that is judicious and seeks the
truth, not insipid and snide general
izations and talking points.
This became more apparent to
me last quarter when a column 1
wrote about what Democrats need
ed to do to win back power was post
ed on a conservative web site called
Free Republic. I was sent a link to
the forum, and was amazed at how
many insults, names and racial slurs
were posted in response. It's hard to
imagine that this was what partici
pants in the Federalist debates envi
sioned when they thought of civil so
ciety and healthy dialogue and de
bate.
Echo chambers like these, where
audiences only seek to reinforce
their own worldviews and achieve
some sense of intellectual and moral
superiority, exist on both sides of
the political spectrum, and are cov
eted by mainstream audiences more
than ever.
But though we live in the age of
the blog, 1 doubt this trend will in
crease at the rate that it has. 1 expect
that most people who are drawn to
alarmist and schizophrenic commen
tators and pundits either snap out of
it at some point or just become com
pletely obsessed with weighing in on
every issue and become mean and
unhappy in the process.
In the meantime, it's really re
freshing to know that CNN is taking
the noble step of re-assessing its
mission and measuring its contribu
tion to society. To think that Jon
Stewart might have been the cre
ative force behind this new shift in
thinking makes the case that some
times fake news is better than bad
news.
