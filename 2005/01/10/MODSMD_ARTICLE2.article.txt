With the new Harold and Libby Zit'f Center set to
open tonight, members of the Jewish community are
getting ready to party like it's 5765 (the year on the
Jewish calendar that corresponds to 2005).
Students and community members will formally
celebrate the opening at tonight's "Matzo Ball"
party, which begins at 8 p.m. at the center.
According to junior Carla Fenves, president of the
Jewish Leadership Council, the "Matzo Ball" will in
clude food and refreshments, a performance by the
Israeli rock band Moshav and an inflatable "bounce
house."
"We hope that a lot of people show up to this
event, since it is open to the general public," said
sophomore Joel Englander, outreach director for the
Jewish Leadership Council. "We expect people to
show up in the hundreds, and we have even invited
many community leaders to witness this opening."
The new Ziff center will provide a gathering place
for various Jewish groups on campus, but it will also
be available to non-Jewish students.
"We have already begun having events in the
house, from Shabbat services to club meetings to win
ter quarter classes," explained Fenves.
In addition, Fenves said, the Ziff Center will house
all of the activities run through Hillel at Stanford.
Hillel serves many Jewish student organizations
including the Jewish Women's Collective, Stanford
Israel Alliance, Israeli Dancing, Jewish Business Stu
dents Association and Camp Kesem.
"Hillel has social events, classes, lectures, religious
services, dinners and holiday celebrations," Fenves
said.
According to Englander, the center will also host
several freshman programs for the Jewish communi
ty at Hillel, including "J-sib," a mentoring program.
Student leaders say the Ziff Center will also serve
the interests of the non-Jewish community.
"The center allows any student group to reserve
the center for their meetings, said sophomore Lyuba
Wolf. Israel Education and Cultural Chair of the Jew
ish Leadership Council. "There is a link on our Web
site for students to make reservations."
