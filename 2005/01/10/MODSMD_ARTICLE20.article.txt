Stanford ripped off 'All Right
Now 7 before USC did
One of The Daily's columnists,
Christopher Anderson, had an arti
cle picked up by the U-Wire on
Thursday that needs to be corrected
from a Cal fan and alum ("USC
makes OU. football pundits look
plain silly," Jan. 6). While I agree
that USC has ripped Stanford off by
taking over "All Right Now." Stan
ford really can't complain.
After all, it's not Stanford's song.
It's a cover song. There's a big dif
ference. In reality USC is just rip
ping off what Stanford had already
ripped off.
I recommend Anderson redi
rects his frustration: try writing an
open letter in The Daily to the band
requesting that they commission a
Stanford Fight Song. Who knows.

maybe Stanford already has one.
(Us Golden Bears wouldn't
know though; if you do we've never
heard it and wouldn't recognize it if
we did.)
And if Stanford is "above" that
and laughs at the idea of an actual
fight song. I suggest taking a sec
ond look at a brilliant article by
two of your colleagues (Mark Slee
and Evan Tana) published in The
Daily back on Nov. 22. At least
someone on your campus is calling
for real spirit. That article, for
your archive search, is entitled
"Go Bears."
Regarding the "fairweather Cal
fans" that Anderson belittles, let
me just say that we're happy to have
them back. Make no mistake, Cal
does not shoot its wounded.
