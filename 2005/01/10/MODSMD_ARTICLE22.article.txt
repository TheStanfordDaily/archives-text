## Fade Into Bolivian Sir Ponson: a Giants hero or a giant loser? 
### 
Every good December holiday, be it
Christmas, Chanukah, Kwanzaa or
Chrismukah needs some type of vil
lain. Thus, in the grand tradition of
unification that has seen Seth Cohen single
handedly unite people of all types. I offer Bal
timore Orioles (and former San Francisco Gi
ants) pitcher, Aruba native. Knight and King
Hippo look-alike. Sir Sidney Ponson.
Foremost, Fd like to thank the Aruban
court system for having the chutzpah to jail Sir
Ponson for 11 days — days which included
Christmas and New Years. Granted, Ponson
wasn't held for his failures as a Major League
pitcher, and he remained in jail only because
Aruba doesn't offer bail. Still, this Christmas
season. I'm adding one more recipient to my
list of thank-you notes: the legal system in
Aruba

/\i uua.
After the Giants ac
quired Ponson for the
stretch run in 2003, Ponson
proceeded to "bolster" the
rotation and went an excel
lent 3-6. I could have
chalked his record down the
stretch to poor run support
had it not been for his
blowup in the playoffs
against the Marlins. After

Jason Schmidt pitched a brilliant complete
game shutout in Game One. Ponson failed to
hold a 4-1 lead and the best-of-five series
evened at a game apiece. The Giants would go
on to lose the series in 4 games, at which point
his team, realizing that Ponson's weight
should not correspond to the size of his con
tract, released him.
Anyway, as the Christmas story goes,
"ace" pitcher Sir Sidney Ponson was merrily
operating (while inebriated) a personal water
craft on Christmas Day in his native Aruba.
This part of the story has been confirmed by
all media sources involved with its coverage.
And yet, even the mere detail of Ponson oper
ating his own personal watercraft seems factu
ally incorrect to me — from his brief stint with
the Giants, Ponson was not exactly a very lithe
figure. ESPN lists Ponson as 6'l", 266 lbs, but
I'll simplify that equation: he's fat. Not good
fat, like David Wells or Kirby Puckett, but
bad, "I'm a pasty, beached whale operating a
personal watercraft which is unable to support
my hefty girth." fat.
According to police reports, while in the
water Ponson managed to anger his fellow
beachgoers by operating his personal water
craft recklessly. After exiting the water, Pon
son was confronted by a mob of people.
Events escalated, an altercation ensued, and
Ponson struck a man in the face.
Of course, the alleged victim of this punch
was a local judge named W. Noordhuize
(great name) who was hospitalized for minor
injuries.
Seeing as how Ponson is a national hero in
Aruba, I'm assuming that a) Ponson should
have had an entourage, and a member of this
entourage should have been the one to strike
the judge, and b) beachgoers would have rec
ognized who Ponson was and not wanted to
confront him.
Because, let's face it. there's no way Pon
son was knighted for his efforts as a baseball
player. He must have some other great skills
— like nunchuck skills, bowhunting skills or
computer-hacking skills.
From there, the story only gets better.
After Ponson attempted to flee (I'm really
hoping Ponson had some type of personal
landcraft. since I can't imagine this guy would


Neil Davis
he fleeing very fast on foot), he
turned himself in. With no hail possi
ble in the Aruban legal system, Pon
son spent Christmas locked in a jail
in a town named after Saint
Nicholas.
Questions need to be asked.
Questions such as: Why did Aruba
knight a career 69-80 pitcher who lost
the only playoff game he started?
Of the four Aruban-born players
(another question: why doesn't Mi
crosoft Word spell-check like the
word Aruban?), only one of the four

Jailed Aruba native
apologizes to the kids

was not knighted — Radhames
Dykhoff, a pitcher who pitched one
inning in his major league career.
Leave it to Aruba to knight a career
10-19 pitcher, a career .251 hitter,
and finally Sir Sidney Ponson.
Somehow Ponson is considered
an island hero, someone that little
kids look at as a role model.
Finally after spending 11 days in
the slammer. Sir Ponson was re
leased from jail and offered this
gem of a quote at the news confer
ence: "I would like to apologize to

everybody, but especially to the
young people of Aruba, who al
ways considered me their role
model."
Sidney Ponson, role model?
Here's hoping that the Aruban kids
soon discover someone better to
look up to.

Impressed by the Warriors' recent ac
quisition of Zarko Cabarkapa, Neil
thinks the Warriors are ready for their
first playoff run in 11 years. Tell Neil
how right he is at neihl@stanford eclu.

stretch run in 2003, Ponson
proceeded to "bolster" the
rotation and went an excel
lent 3-6. I could have
chalked his record down the
stretch to poor run support
had it not been for his
blowup in the playoffs
against the Marlins. After

Jason Schmidt pitched a brilliant complete
game shutout in Game One. Ponson failed to
hold a 4-1 lead and the best-of-five series
evened at a game apiece. The Giants would go
on to lose the series in 4 games, at which point
his team, realizing that Ponson's weight
should not correspond to the size of his con
tract, released him.
Anyway, as the Christmas story goes,
"ace" pitcher Sir Sidney Ponson was merrily
operating (while inebriated) a personal water
craft on Christmas Day in his native Aruba.
This part of the story has been confirmed by
all media sources involved with its coverage.
And yet, even the mere detail of Ponson oper
ating his own personal watercraft seems factu
ally incorrect to me — from his brief stint with
the Giants, Ponson was not exactly a very lithe
figure. ESPN lists Ponson as 6'l", 266 lbs, but
I'll simplify that equation: he's fat. Not good
fat, like David Wells or Kirby Puckett, but
bad, "I'm a pasty, beached whale operating a
personal watercraft which is unable to support
my hefty girth." fat.
According to police reports, while in the
water Ponson managed to anger his fellow
beachgoers by operating his personal water
craft recklessly. After exiting the water, Pon
son was confronted by a mob of people.
Events escalated, an altercation ensued, and
Ponson struck a man in the face.
Of course, the alleged victim of this punch
was a local judge named W. Noordhuize
(great name) who was hospitalized for minor
injuries.
Seeing as how Ponson is a national hero in
Aruba, I'm assuming that a) Ponson should
have had an entourage, and a member of this
entourage should have been the one to strike
the judge, and b) beachgoers would have rec
ognized who Ponson was and not wanted to
confront him.
Because, let's face it. there's no way Pon
son was knighted for his efforts as a baseball
player. He must have some other great skills
— like nunchuck skills, bowhunting skills or
computer-hacking skills.
From there, the story only gets better.
After Ponson attempted to flee (I'm really
hoping Ponson had some type of personal
landcraft. since I can't imagine this guy would

he fleeing very fast on foot), he
turned himself in. With no hail possi
ble in the Aruban legal system, Pon
son spent Christmas locked in a jail
in a town named after Saint
Nicholas.
Questions need to be asked.
Questions such as: Why did Aruba
knight a career 69-80 pitcher who lost
the only playoff game he started?
Of the four Aruban-born players
(another question: why doesn't Mi
crosoft Word spell-check like the
word Aruban?), only one of the four

was not knighted — Radhames
Dykhoff, a pitcher who pitched one
inning in his major league career.
Leave it to Aruba to knight a career
10-19 pitcher, a career .251 hitter,
and finally Sir Sidney Ponson.
Somehow Ponson is considered
an island hero, someone that little
kids look at as a role model.
Finally after spending 11 days in
the slammer. Sir Ponson was re
leased from jail and offered this
gem of a quote at the news confer
ence: "I would like to apologize to

everybody, but especially to the
young people of Aruba, who al
ways considered me their role
model."
Sidney Ponson, role model?
Here's hoping that the Aruban kids
soon discover someone better to
look up to.

Every good December holiday, be it
Christmas, Chanukah, Kwanzaa or

unification that has seen Seth Cohen single

timore Orioles (and former San Francisco Gi

Hippo look-alike. Sir Sidney Ponson.
Foremost, Fd like to thank the Aruban
court system for having the chutzpah to jail Sir
Ponson for 11 days — days which included
Christmas and New Years. Granted, Ponson
wasn't held for his failures as a Major League
pitcher, and he remained in jail only because
Aruba doesn't offer bail. Still, this Christmas
season. I'm adding one more recipient to my
list of thank-you notes: the legal system in
