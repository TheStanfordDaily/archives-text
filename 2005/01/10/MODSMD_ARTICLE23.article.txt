### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's volleyball team struggled at the 41st an
nual Santa Barbara Elephant Bar Invitational this past
weekend but still managed to finish fourth overall.
The tournament, which marked Stanford's first
competition in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
conference this season, was a challenging start to the
year for the No. 6 Cardinal.
"The thing about that type of a tournament [is that]
all the teams in that tournament are strong." head coach
Don Shaw said. "It's a good preview of what we're going
to see in conference play. We felt like we could have
won every match we played. I think it's good prepara
tion for the upcoming games this season."
The competition started off on a good note. In
their first match, against No. 3 Pacific, the Cardinal
pulled out an impressive victory in just three games.
With 18 kills in that match, junior Ben Reddy led the
team's offense.
Though it was a Stanford sweep, the second game
went to 33-31. Shaw credited the Cardinal victory
down the stretch to exceptional teamwork.
And since Pacific prevented Stanford from advanc
ing to the postseason in 2004, this shutout match was
particularly satisfying to the Cardinal athletes.
The win also placed Stanford in the winner's brack
et for the second round of the tournament, where it

faced No. 2 Cal State Northridge.
Despite another strong performance by Reddy,
with 17 kills and four service aces, the Cardinal was un
able to pull out a victory against Northridge. losing the
match 1-3. The Matadors would go on to finish second
overall.
"We played fairly well against Northridge but made
enough mistakes to beat ourselves," Shaw said.
Losing this second round match ended the Cardi
nal's hopes fora shot at the championship. However,
the team still earned a spot in the third-place match of
the final round, which was played the following day.
In the second day of the tournament, facing No. 5
Long Beach State in a match for the bronze medal.
Stanford came out strong, winning the first game 30-
25. Long Beach State came back to claim the next two
games by slim margins, at 31-29 and then 33-31.
"We had a chance to win those games, but we made
a couple of errors, whether it was service reception or
attacking." Shaw said. "We could have won that match
in three games if we had been able to go error-free, so
that was kind of disappointing,"
Nonetheless, Stanford responded by winning the
fourth game by the largest margin in the match, 30-23.
But even this tremendous comeback was not enough,
as the Cardinal fell 17-19 in the fifth game.
"We dominated game four and won it fairly easily;
then in game five (hey jumped out
to an early lead, and we spent most
of the game behind by a couple
points." Shaw said. "Toward the
very end, we tied the match, but we
couldn't quite make a play to take it
over the top and win."
Despite struggling to execute
such plays during the final match,
the team remains optimistic about
the season.
With both a better understand
ing of their weaknesses and the
sense that they can hold their own
in the conference, the Cardinal
emerged from the tournament
feeling prepared for the season
ahead.
"You're disappointed, but it's
encouraging to know that we're
staying right there with all these
other teams," Shaw said. "We
would have liked to win more
games, but we were right in the
middle of that.
"We got good performances out
of just about everybody."
The Cardinal's next match will
be Jan. 14 at home against South
ern California, a team that placed
seventh out of eight in the UCSB
tournament.
