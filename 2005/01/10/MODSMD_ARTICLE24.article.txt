## Little's work inside lifts Card offense 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
In their 87-76 win over No. 13 Arizona on Saturday,
the Cardinal found something they haven't seen very
often this season: open shots.
These were made available in part by senior center
Rob Little, whose presence on offense forced Arizona
defenders to guard the interior, opening up outside
shots for Stanford's perimeter players. Little, who
scored 16 points to go with a season-high 12 rebounds,
was a force inside, making short jumpers, hook shots
and lay-ups over Arizona center Channing Frye, no de
fensive slouch.
"Rob Little gave us post presence today," Stanford
head coach Trent Johnson said. "We had our game
working inside-out, which relieves the pressure on Chris
[Hernandez] and Danny |Grunfeld|. We were able to
get good shots, and we were able to score."
Little's presence helped the Cardinal to shoot 58 per
cent from the field and 60 percent from the three-point
line. Hernandez and Cirunfeld capitalized on the in
creased scoring opportunities, making a combined six of
eight shots from three-point range and 17 of 24 overall
from the field, combining to score 52 points. There was
not as much pressure on the duo to create shots, and the

offense flowed better than it has all season.
Stanford could have been in trouble when junior for
ward Matt Haryasz, the team's leading rebounder, sat
out the last 11 minutes of the first period with two fouls.
But Little carried the load in the post, scoring all of his
six first-half points after Haryasz had left the game.
The Cardinal built up a 16-point lead with eight min
utes to go in the second half, but Arizona engineered an
11-2 run that brought the score to 71-64 only three min
utes later. The Wildcats seemed poised to score after re
covering a Dan Grunfeld turnover, but Hernandez
swooped in and stole it back, passing to Little fora lay
in on the fast break. A minute later. Little tipped in a
Matt Haryasz miss to give Stanford an 11 -point lead and
ice the victory.
"There was a four- or five-point swing on that one
play," Hernandez said. "It only happens once or twice a
game. It hasn't been going in our favor the last couple of
games, but today it did."
Little's score turned the momentum back to Stanford
and defused a potentially devastating Arizona run. He
seemed to step up just when the team needed him. and
has played his best this season against the Cardinal's
toughest opponents. He scored a season-high 19 points

Stanford big man comes
through in the clutch

against Arizona State on Thursday.
He said that he tried to be more dy
namic against Arizona.
"Against Washington 1 came in
off the bench and tried to be really
active, and that helped today," he
said. "It's also a matter of being in
the right place at the right time. I was
focusing on rebounding, and that
helped me to be in the right place be
cause it meant 1 was moving my feet
and getting in position."
Little's performance came at the
right time fora squad that has been
desperate for some inside scoring.
His play relieved the pressure on
Grunfeld and Hernandez and im
pressed the Maples crowd, which
gave the big center a standing ova
tion when he fouled out in the last
minute of the second half.
Arizona head coach Lute Olson
said that Little did a good job of get
ting position on the blocks.
"Our guys let |him| catch the ball
down low," Olson said. "I told our
guys that, as tough as it sounds, we
can't let Rob catch the ball where we
let him catch the ball today."
The duty of guarding Little fell
mainly to Frye, who did his own
damage on the offensive end with 20
points and 13 rebounds.
"It's always fun playing Chan
ning," Little said. "1 have a lot of re
spect for his game, and I think he re
spects mine. At one point I told him
that I thought it was going to come
down to a one-point game, because
it's always close when these two
teams play. Hopefully, we can use
this as a stepping stone for the next
couple of games."
The Cardinal always get up to
play Arizona, a rivalry that Little
called the best on the West coast.
Hopefully, the team will be able to
bring that same intensity to the rest
of the Pacific-1 () schedule.
Maybe Little can build on the
Arizona game to become the inside
force the Cardinal have lacked all
season.
