## 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
To say the pre-game atmosphere Saturday at Maples
Pavilion was more subdued than when Arizona came to
town last year would be like saying Stanford's subse
quent 87-76 upset of the No. 13 Wildcats was big, or that
Chris Hernandez is a good leader. All are gross under
statements.
Dick Vitale was in Chapel Hill. Tiger Woods was in
Kapalua, and the Sixth Man Club had less to gawk at
without Elin Nordegren sitting courtside. not to mention
plenty of elbow room. It just didn't feel like Stanford-
Arizona. If not for the smattering of U of A fans in the
stands, one might have wondered if the AriZona Iced
Tea All-Stars, not the red-hot Wildcats, would emerge
from the visitors' tunnel.
One sentence from the Maples P.A. announcer
seemed to change all that, along with Stanford's fortune.
Junior Chris Hernandez, who was questionable for
the game after missing Thursday's loss to Arizona State
with back spasms, was introduced as the starter at point
guard, eliciting the first of many thunderous ovations
from the home crowd on a day that culminated in anoth
er jubilant celebration on the court.
Doctors cleared Hernandez to play an hour and a half
before tip-off, and he delivered a gutsy performance with
23 points and six steals in Stanford's third straight — and
most improbable — victory over Arizona (12-3,2-1 Pac
-10).
"That's Chris." said Stanford head coach Trent John
son, who had harbored some reservations about letting
his floor general play. "Heart, character; this team
doesn't lack on that."
Most importantly, Hernandez provided the leader
ship, intensity and swagger his team lacked against the
Sun Devils, as the Cardinal (7-7. 1-3 Pac-10) snapped a
three-game skid and avoided what would have been
their first 0-4 start in conference play since 1984.
"Chris Hernandez is as tough and competitive a play
er as you'll ever see in your lifetime," said Arizona head
coach Lute Olson, whose team lost for the first time since
Nov. 26. "There's no question who's in charge on the
court. He reminds me a great deal of [former Wildcat
and 1997 Final Four MVP] Miles Simon from the stand
point that he makes everybody better with his presence."
"It was good just to play and beat a team like this, and
hopefully it will be the beginning of a winning streak for
us," said Hernandez, who played all but three minutes.
the top of the key at
the 10-minute mark of the first half put Stanford ahead
22-19, and junior guard Dan Grunfeld made sure that
lead stood up with a career-high 29 points.
The Cardinal's leading scorer finished 10-of-12 from
the field and drilled all three of his attempts from beyond
the arc, as Stanford had its highest scoring output since
its season-opening 93-83 overtime win over USF.
"We set each other up more," Grunfeld said. "It
wasn't necessarily people going out and making great
one-on-one moves. We were moving the ball, looking for
the open man. and that helped."
So too did another good game from junior reserve
Jason Haas, who helped Hernandez handle Arizona's
pressure and finished with four points and five assists.
"Anytime a team shoots 58 percent from the field. 60
percent from three-point range and 77 percent from the
line, you're in trouble anyway you look at it," said Olson,
poring over the final box score. "They played as well as
they could play."
Arizona, on the other hand, did not. But averaging
over 90 points and forcing more than 20 turnovers per
game over their past five games, there was little reason
to believe the Wildcats wouldn't run and gun Stanford
off the floor.
But Stanford — led on the inside by senior forward
Rob Little's 16 point and 12 boards — got physical with
the Wildcats and turned the tables on Arizona in transi
tion. The Cardinal limited the Wildcats to just six fast
break points and scored 22 points off turnovers to Ari
zona's eight. Arizona shot just 38 percent from the field.
"We tried to dig in on defense and not give them any
thing easy," Grunfeld said. "Offensively, we executed.
but really defense is what won the
game for us."
After Stanford extended its three
point halftime lead to nine early in
the second half, senior center Cfian
ning Frye (20 points, 13 boards)
brought the Wildcats back to within
four with a put-back inside, momen
tarily silencing the Maples crowd.
Little responded with a three
point play to spark a 9-0 run which

put the Cardinal ahead 60-47 with
11:04 to play, and converted a lay-up
in transition off a key Hernandez
steal to extend the lead back to nine
with 4:37 to play.
"We need all the confidence we
can get; so we'll take a win however
we can get it." L.itlle said. "We're 7-
7; we have a long way to go. This is
not a big party for us."
In that respect, Saturday's win

didn't have the same feel as last
year's, when senior forward Nick
Robinson beat the buzzer to pre
serve Stanford's unblemished
record.
"This was more of a big confi
dence-builder," Hernandez said.
"Last year was more icing on the
cake for us. This had more impact on
our team."

game over their past five games, there was little reason
to believe the Wildcats wouldn't run and gun Stanford
off the floor.
But Stanford — led on the inside by senior forward
Rob Little's 16 point and 12 boards — got physical with
the Wildcats and turned the tables on Arizona in transi
tion. The Cardinal limited the Wildcats to just six fast
break points and scored 22 points off turnovers to Ari
zona's eight. Arizona shot just 38 percent from the field.
"We tried to dig in on defense and not give them any
thing easy," Grunfeld said. "Offensively, we executed.
but really defense is what won the
game for us."
After Stanford extended its three
point halftime lead to nine early in
the second half, senior center Cfian
ning Frye (20 points, 13 boards)
brought the Wildcats back to within
four with a put-back inside, momen
tarily silencing the Maples crowd.
Little responded with a three
point play to spark a 9-0 run which

Unexpected 'Zona win

put the Cardinal ahead 60-47 with
11:04 to play, and converted a lay-up
in transition off a key Hernandez
steal to extend the lead back to nine
with 4:37 to play.
"We need all the confidence we
can get; so we'll take a win however
we can get it." L.itlle said. "We're 7-
7; we have a long way to go. This is
not a big party for us."
In that respect, Saturday's win

didn't have the same feel as last
year's, when senior forward Nick
Robinson beat the buzzer to pre
serve Stanford's unblemished
record.
"This was more of a big confi
dence-builder," Hernandez said.
"Last year was more icing on the
cake for us. This had more impact on
our team."
To say the pre-game atmosphere Saturday at Maples
Pavilion was more subdued than when Arizona came to
town last year would be like saying Stanford's subse
quent 87-76 upset of the No. 13 Wildcats was big, or that
Chris Hernandez is a good leader. All are gross under
statements.
Dick Vitale was in Chapel Hill. Tiger Woods was in
Kapalua, and the Sixth Man Club had less to gawk at
without Elin Nordegren sitting courtside. not to mention
plenty of elbow room. It just didn't feel like Stanford-
Arizona. If not for the smattering of U of A fans in the
stands, one might have wondered if the AriZona Iced
Tea All-Stars, not the red-hot Wildcats, would emerge
from the visitors' tunnel.
One sentence from the Maples P.A. announcer
seemed to change all that, along with Stanford's fortune.
Junior Chris Hernandez, who was questionable for
the game after missing Thursday's loss to Arizona State
with back spasms, was introduced as the starter at point
guard, eliciting the first of many thunderous ovations
from the home crowd on a day that culminated in anoth
er jubilant celebration on the court.
Doctors cleared Hernandez to play an hour and a half
before tip-off, and he delivered a gutsy performance with
23 points and six steals in Stanford's third straight — and
most improbable — victory over Arizona (12-3,2-1 Pac
-10).
"That's Chris." said Stanford head coach Trent John
son, who had harbored some reservations about letting
his floor general play. "Heart, character; this team
doesn't lack on that."
Most importantly, Hernandez provided the leader
ship, intensity and swagger his team lacked against the
Sun Devils, as the Cardinal (7-7. 1-3 Pac-10) snapped a
three-game skid and avoided what would have been
their first 0-4 start in conference play since 1984.
"Chris Hernandez is as tough and competitive a play
er as you'll ever see in your lifetime," said Arizona head
coach Lute Olson, whose team lost for the first time since
Nov. 26. "There's no question who's in charge on the
court. He reminds me a great deal of [former Wildcat
and 1997 Final Four MVP] Miles Simon from the stand
point that he makes everybody better with his presence."
"It was good just to play and beat a team like this, and
hopefully it will be the beginning of a winning streak for
us," said Hernandez, who played all but three minutes.
the top of the key at
the 10-minute mark of the first half put Stanford ahead
22-19, and junior guard Dan Grunfeld made sure that
lead stood up with a career-high 29 points.
The Cardinal's leading scorer finished 10-of-12 from
the field and drilled all three of his attempts from beyond
the arc, as Stanford had its highest scoring output since
its season-opening 93-83 overtime win over USF.
"We set each other up more," Grunfeld said. "It
wasn't necessarily people going out and making great
one-on-one moves. We were moving the ball, looking for
the open man. and that helped."
So too did another good game from junior reserve
Jason Haas, who helped Hernandez handle Arizona's
pressure and finished with four points and five assists.
"Anytime a team shoots 58 percent from the field. 60
percent from three-point range and 77 percent from the
line, you're in trouble anyway you look at it," said Olson,
poring over the final box score. "They played as well as
they could play."
