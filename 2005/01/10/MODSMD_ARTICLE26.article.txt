### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
They say that revenge is a dish best served cold. Perhaps
that explains the cool, cloudy weather that followed the Car
dinal on their recent road trip to Arizona. After suffering con
secutive road losses to Arizona State and Arizona a season
ago. No. 8 Stanford (13-2 overall, 5-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
returned the favor with a two-game sweep last weekend.
Against Arizona, freshman Candice Wiggins and senior
Kelley Suminski led the way for Stanford with 28 and 20
points, respectively, keying an impressive 78-66 victory over
an excellent Wildcat team.
"This was a guard day," head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"Our guards — Candice. Kelley and Susan Borchardt —real-
ly stepped up big."
In Tucson. Ariz, the Cardinal faced one of the toughest
tasks in college basketball — beating Arizona at the McKale
Center. The Wildcats entered the game boasting a 34-game
home winning streak, the longest in the nation.
Two factors, one big and one small, have contributed to
Arizona's success this year. Diminutive senior guard Dee Dee
Wheeler leads the Pac-10 in scoring, with 19 points per gamef
and keys the Wildcat offense.

the "Gumby" cartoon, think Tro
jan Horse instead. Folk stands 6-
foot-5 and controls the paint like no
other player in the Pac-10.
The Cardinal quieted an excited
crowd early, shooting 6-of-l 1 from
the field while holding Arizona to
an abysmal 1 -of-13.
The Wildcats stormed hack on
the strength of their two stars.
Wheeler hit 4 of 6 from three-point
range, including a 27-foot bomb as
the shot clock expired. Polk added
10 points in the first period, but
more importantly, occupied Stan
ford's inside players, leading to 11
offensive rebounds for the Wild
cats in the first half.
The second half was a back-and
forth physical battle, and both
teams were in the bonus with seven
minutes remaining. However, the
Cardinal played one of their best
halves of basketball in the second.
Stanford won the war on the
boards and got timely outside
shooting from both Wiggins and
Borchardt.
"We were more aggressive |in the
second half]," Suminski said. "Our
posts had a tough assignment, but
they really passed and played well."
However, the Cardinal's free
throw shooting won the game.
Stanford shot an unbelievable
22-of-24 from the charity stripe in
the second half, sealing the victory
and a 4-1 conference record.
In Tempe, Ariz., Stanford
erased the memory of last year's
20-point loss to Arizona State with

a 68-57 victory over the No. 23 Sun
Devils (10-4, 2-2) in a noisy Wells
Fargo Arena. Freshman guard
Candice Wiggins led the way for
the Cardinal with a career-high 31
points. The 17-year-old also
showed that she knows how to
share, handing out six assists, also a
personal best.
However, Wiggins' biggest im
pact may have been on the defen
sive end of the court, where she
converted six steals into six last
break lavups.
"I definitely always depend on
my defense to create my offense."
Wiggins said. "1 know there's times
where I 'm not going to make every
shot. Offense might not be going
for me, but something 1 can control
is my defense."
Not only did Wiggins' steals put
12 points on the board for Stanford,
but they also swung momentum
away from a tough Arizona State
team that had already posted wins
against No. 14 Connecticut and No.
17 Georgia.
"It's exhausting." ASU's Emily
Westerberg said of Stanford's fast
breaks. "When you can't have long
offensive possessions, it definitely
takes the wind out of your sails a lit
tle bit."
All did not go the Cardinal's
way. however. In a game that was
physical from start to finish, the
Sun Devils outmuscled Stanford in
the first half fora 10-8 rebounding
advantage on the Cardinal's defen
sive glass.

Cardinal capitalize on
fast-break offense

Despite head coach Tara Van
Derveer's pre-game admonition to
"always know where [Kylanj
Loney is," ASU's senior guard got
three open looks from beyond the
arc in the first half, converting all of
them, as part of a 14-point night.
Yet Stanford re-grouped and
came out of the locker room quick
ly in the second half. The Cardinal
played more physically, led by se
nior T'Nae Thiel's game-high nine
boards, and with Stanford's tough
play inside came more fouls against
the Sun Devils.
Posts Brooke Smith and Kristen
Newlin limited ASU's talented
Kristen Kovesdy to just six points
inside.
"Our zone won the game defen
sively," Van Derveer said. "We re
ally had trouble matching up with
them."
Meanwhile, Loney's efforts to
pressure Wiggins led to a series of
hand-check fouls, and the ASU
star fouled out with two minutes
remaining.
Despite two second-half runs by
the Sun Devils, Stanford's defense
stood strong, allowing Loney just
one field goal after halftime.
"Our team really stood up to the
challenge," Van Derveer said. "I'm
proud of them."
The Cardinal now return to
Maples for some home cooking.
Stanford begins a stretch of four
home games with contests against
California (Jan. 13) and No. 13
Boston College (Jan. 15).
