# SICs aim to fill gaps in curriculum

This quarter, there are 11
courses taught by Stanford stu
dents — for Stanford students —
that cover topics otherwise not in
cluded in Stanford's curriculum.
"There are some very interest
ing and important subjects that
are simply not covered by faculty
interests, and there are students
who have a great deal of knowl
edge and expertise in those sub
jects." said senior Yogesh Raut,
co-leader and developer of the
Student Initiated Course "Psych
2351: Understanding Culture
Through Film."
Run by the ASSIJ, the Student
Initiated Course program allows
students to develop and teach a
course. Students interested in

teaching a class must find a faculty
sponsor and submit an application
with a detailed syllabus and lec
ture material to the SIC program.
If their application is approved,
students gain access to funding for
their class through the ASSU's
Special Fees program.
According to Raut, students
can gain "exceptional benefits"
from environments driven by peer
learning.
"Student Initiated Courses
offer a more personal and direct
relationship with both the instruc
tor and with other students than
large lecture classes," he said. "A
student initiated course can make
course material personal and easy
to relate to."
Another appealing aspect of
the SIC program is its ability to

benefit both students taking SIC
courses and SIC instructors, orga
nizers say.
"SICs are unique in that they
promote the idea of democratic
education," said junior Alyssa
Schwartz, one of two coordina
tors of the SIC program. "Stu
dents learn from one another as
much as they learn from the
teachers. In this case, the teachers
are themselves students, so every
one gets something out of the
course."
"These are topics that stu
dents are passionate about, but
there's no faculty available to
teach them," Schwartz said. "In
stead of organizing an indepen
dent study for students to teach

themselves, SIC gives them the op
portunity to share their passions
with other students."
Since the program's inception in
1999, approximately 10 SIC courses
have been taught each quarter, with
most filled to capacity. The SIC pro
gram does not restrict the number of
student courses that can be taught in
a given quarter.
To students like Raut, the success

Around 10 SICs
each quarter

of SIC is a natural extension of the
positive learning experience that re
sults from motivated students with a
strong interest in the topic of their
studies.
"A Student Initiated Course can
put a fresh spin on certain ideas, and
expose these ideas to students who
might never have thought about
them otherwise," he said.
