# Students abroad feel pinched by weak dollar
## 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
Modern platitudes remind us of
all the things money can't buy: love,
happiness, justice. Students who
traveled abroad last quarter know
that money, especially American
money, can't always buy the more
tangible things either, like pints at
the local pub or a train ticket to
Prague. At least not at favorable
prices.
With the American greenback
hitting record lows in the last quarter
of 2004, Stanford students overseas,
especially in Europe, felt the strange
sensation of losing money not
through rash purchases or poor sav
ings skills but through the over
whelming force of international eco

nomics.
"I knew that it was not a favor
able conversion rate," said Rachel
Torres, a junior who spent last quar
ter in Paris. "But I didn't realize how
unfavorable it was until 1 got my
bank statement."
When Torres and the other stu
dents left for Paris last September,
one Euro cost them around $1.24.
By Dec. 31, the cost was $ 1.39. A full
12 percent of their checking ac
counts had disappeared into the
macroeconomic ether.
For the Overseas Studies Pro
gram, which operates Stanford's
centers abroad, the financial pinch
was even more pronounced because
of the size of their foreign spending.
Their increased costs were at least
partially offset by extra funding from
the University.
"The University has provided us
with additional funding to counter
the loss in the value of the dollar
against our costs in foreign curren
cies," said John Mallet, OSP's fi
nance manager.
Students at most overseas cen
ters receive a monthly stipend to
help pay for lunch and transporta
tion costs. (The stipend is a partial
reimbursement from the students'
room and board fees.) The checks
are given in local currencies, one
way that OSF tries to blunt the im
pact of currency fluctuations for
students.
"We really don't want students
even considering our costs at a cen
ter in deciding on where to go," Mal
let said. "[Studying abroad) is not a
program only open or available to fi
nancially well-off students. With the
support of the University and gener
ous donations from alumni, we make
it all work."
Of course, OSP doesn't subsidize
discretionary spending. Going out to
clubs and bars, eating out and buying
clothes became all the more expen
sive as the dollar weakened.
"[The weak dollar) ended up
not having a huge effect on my
spending habits," said Anthony
Viola, a junior who cashed in his

dollars for euros to study in Italy.
"While 1 was there I just forgot that
a euro wasn't a dollar. When I
bought a jacket for 85 euros I
thought, well, this is like 85 dollars.
But it's more like $120. So what
happened was 1 spent a lot more
than 1 planned on spending, which
is equally bad, if not worse."
Costs varied greatly from country
to country, of course. Travelers to
Stanford's program in Santiago,
Chile, benefited from the lower cost
of-living in that country, compared
to that of European countries.
"Everything was so cheap in
Chile already," said Sarah Nash, a
junior. "I guess I just wasn't paying
that much attention."
Students in Australia also fared
a little better than their European
counterparts, both with the more
favorable exchange rate and with
the extra psychological comfort
that could be taken from paying
only 75 U.S. cents for an Australian
dollar. (At most other Stanford
centers, it cost more than one U.S.
dollar to buy one unit of the local
currency.)
Strong growth in the American
economy at the end of the year sta
bilized the dollar against most
main currencies, but deeply en
trenched structural problems, like
enormous trade and fiscal deficits,
have many economists worried

U.S. dollar could be 'just
as likely to go up as down'

about the future.
Nonetheless, an article on
Bloomberg.com predicted that the
dollar would reverse its three-year
long downward trajectory against
the euro and strengthen over the
coming year, citing an opinion poll of
53 currency experts around the
globe.
In addition, the Federal Reserve
is expected to continue raising inter
est rates at home, one way to keep
the dollar from falling.
Economics Prof. Ronald McKin
non, who has written several books
on the currency system, said he be
lieves it is impossible to make con
crete predictions about where the
dollar is going.
"Despite all the talk about the
dollar's past depreciation against
other currencies, as of tomorrow or a
year from now, it is just as likely to go
up as down," McKinnon told The
Daily in an e-mail.
Whether the dollar plummets or
stubbornly refuses to rise, there is lit
tle risk that students going abroad
will have to pay higher tuition or
room and board bills.
"OSP remains committed to
maintaining the same room and
board fees that Stanford campus
students pay," Mallet said. "The
University and OSP are shouldering
the bulk of the impact of the weak
dollar."
