# Students abroad feel pinched by weak dollar
## 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
Modern platitudes remind us of
all the things money can't buy: love,
happiness, justice. Students who
traveled abroad last quarter know
that money, especially American
money, can't always buy the more
tangible things either, like pints at
the local pub or a train ticket to
Prague. At least not at favorable
prices.
With the American greenback
hitting record lows in the last quarter
of 2004, Stanford students overseas,
especially in Europe, felt the strange
sensation of losing money not
through rash purchases or poor sav
ings skills but through the over
whelming force of international eco

nomics.
"I knew that it was not a favor
able conversion rate," said Rachel
Torres, a junior who spent last quar
ter in Paris. "But I didn't realize how
unfavorable it was until 1 got my
bank statement."
When Torres and the other stu
dents left for Paris last September,
one Euro cost them around $1.24.
By Dec. 31, the cost was $ 1.39. A full
12 percent of their checking ac
counts had disappeared into the
macroeconomic ether.
For the Overseas Studies Pro
gram, which operates Stanford's
centers abroad, the financial pinch
was even more pronounced because
of the size of their foreign spending.
