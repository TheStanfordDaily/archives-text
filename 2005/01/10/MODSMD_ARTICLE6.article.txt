creating a better system of care for
youth in Redwood City.

ultimate goal for the archive is to
strengthen support for young people
in the Redwood City area.
"The goal of the partnership was
to work together to create new
knowledge and practices related to
youth development," said Milbry
McLaughlin, a professor in the
School of Education who works
closely with the Gardner Center.
The Gardner Center was found
ed in 2000 with the mission of inte
grating community organizations
and agencies to better serve the
youth. The center works closely with
three communities: Oakland, Red
wood City, and the Mid-Coast Com
munity of San Mateo County.
The Gardner Center was one of
13 nonprofit organizations that re

ceived the Skoll Award for Innova
tion in Silicon Valley this year. The
size of the awards ranged from
$6(),(XM) to $340,000.
The Skoll Foundation aims to
advance long-term changes to ben
efit communities around the world
by supporting, connecting and cel
ebrating social entrepreneurs. I'he

Skoll, the lirst president of e√üay,
and the Skoll Award for Innova
tion in Silicon Valley is one of
three grants the Skoll Foundation
offers.
According to Terry Nagel. com
munications officer at the Skoll
Foundation, funds are aimed at sup
porting organizations that tackle
problems on a larger, long-term

basis. Thus, multi-year awards allow
organizations to spend more time
doing core work.
"We try to support grantees in
every way we can think of by giving
them the absolute maximum
amount of support," Nagel said. "In
addition to financial support, we in
vite them to get together in learning
communities and allow them to
apply for additional funding to sup
port their infrastructure."
Nagel said that the Skoll Foun
dation hopes to build a portfolio of
organizations serving the needs of
Silicon Valley.
"We're looking for people with
strong entrepreneurial ideas and ex
perience who are addressing the so
cial needs of a community instead of

said.
Hayin Kim, a second year Edu
cation Ph.D. candidate who con
ducts research with the Gardner
Center, believes that the Skoll
Award rightfully recognizes the in
novation and vision of the center.
"The Gardner Center is com
pletely unique in its ability to bridge
the practice and research gap that is
profound, especially in educational
research. By marrying the research
capacity of a major university, along
with community relationships and
youth development work, there ex
ists an important opportunity to
learn from work, and learn from re
search in tandem." she said.
