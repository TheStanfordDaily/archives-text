"How I Write" Winter Quarter 2004
Conversations
Co-Sponsored by Undergraduate Research Programs and the Stanford Writing Center
"How I Write" is a series of conversations with faculty and other advanced writers to explore the nuts
and bolts, pleasures and pains, of all types of writing. While content is always an issue, the conversa
tion will primarily focus on work styles, such as where, when, and how a writer composes, allowing us
to examine habits, idiosyncrasies, techniques, trade secrets, hidden anxieties, and delights. We will dis
cuss how a writer generates ideas, sustains large-scale projects, combines research with composition,
overcomes various impediments and blocks, and cultivates stylistic innovations. Writing communities
share experiences (even bad ones), so that all writers can learn and grow, and Stanford is an excep
tionally rich community for gaining such insights
Join Hilton Obenzinger, Associate Director for Honors Writing, Undergraduate Research Programs, in
a conversation on the techniques, quirks, and joys of advanced writers producing work in all fields and
