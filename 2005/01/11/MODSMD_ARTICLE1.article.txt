# Housing shortage reported
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Housing is really feeling the
squeeze this quarter. Campus dorms and
houses often get an influx of new residents
winter quarter as students return from
abroad, but this year Housing Assignment
Services has had to cope with an unusual
ly large number of returning students, as
well as fewer students leaving their resi
dences after the fall.
As a result, common areas have been
turned into bedrooms, normally unoccu
pied cottages have been opened for hous
ing, students have been assigned to guest
rooms and upperclassmen have moved
into graduate dorms.

"We had about 20 to 30 more students
than normal need housing this winter than
in previous winters, presumably because
more students were coming back from
overseas," said Director of Housing As
signment Services Todd Benson. "Al
though this may not sound like a lot. it is
significant, because the housing system is
generally full in winter. We also had about
20 to 30 fewer students than usual leave
housing at the end of fall. The result of
both these was to need to find extra spaces
in winter."
According to Benson, the University
added spaces to between 8 and 10 under
graduate residences, with no undergradu
ate residence increasing in size by more
than three students.

In Columbae, a cooperative house
where students change rooms every quar
ter and where this reporter lives, the addi
tion of two unexpected walk-ins forced the
house to hold a second rooming meeting
to find spots for them. .
"The decision was made sort of by fiat,
hut we dealt with it," said Columbae Res
ident Assistant Vince Dorie, a master's
student in biomedical informatics. "I do
think that the places that were most flexi
ble got the most screwed. Housing knows
that Columbae and Synergy switch rooms
every quarter, so they think it's easy to
cram two extra people in there."
Kairos is one cooperative house that

has been affected by University
housing crunches in the past, with its
pool room sometimes converted into
a residence.
"It was a possibility, and that wor
ried me somewhat, both because it
would be noisy and draft space for
new residents, and because it would
cut down on common space for the
rest of the house," said Kairos RA
Emily Navarrette, a senior.
However, Kairos' population
only grew from 32 to 33, an increase
accommodated by a room that had
been empty during the fall.
"The Row office really communi
cated honestly and thoroughly with
me during the whole process of the
possible uprates, and I was able to
keep our staff informed as well,"
Navarette said. "I'm thankful that
we didn't have to convert our com
mon space, but I understand that the

University was in a somewhat des
perate position."
Senior Katie Justus also had few
complaints about the University's
solutions. As a senior at the meeting
for female walk-ins — students not
assigned to housing through the reg
ular Draw — Justus had priority for
a single in the Crothers Hall. Now,
Justus says she does not regret her
decision to live in what is normally
all-graduate housing.
"It's totally awesome," she said.
"It's really close to everything, and I
have a huge single. None of my
neighbors come by to visit me, so I
actually get work done. My only
complaint is that I have to walk a
mile and a half to the laundry."

"When it got to me, there were a
few spots available but they all
sucked, so I decided to wait a few
days," Vaughn said. He spent two or
three days living in a local motel be

"The biggest problem is that
when people are abroad they don't
give you info, especially when you
come back mid-year," Vaughn said,

According to Benson, the University
added spaces to between 8 and 10 under
graduate residences, with no undergradu

than three students.

Kairos is one cooperative house that

has been affected by University
housing crunches in the past, with its
pool room sometimes converted into
a residence.
"It was a possibility, and that wor
ried me somewhat, both because it
would be noisy and draft space for
new residents, and because it would
cut down on common space for the
rest of the house," said Kairos RA
Emily Navarrette, a senior.
However, Kairos' population
only grew from 32 to 33, an increase
accommodated by a room that had
been empty during the fall.
"The Row office really communi
cated honestly and thoroughly with
me during the whole process of the
possible uprates, and I was able to
keep our staff informed as well,"
Navarette said. "I'm thankful that
we didn't have to convert our com
mon space, but I understand that the

University was in a somewhat des
perate position."
Senior Katie Justus also had few
complaints about the University's
solutions. As a senior at the meeting
for female walk-ins — students not
assigned to housing through the reg

a single in the Crothers Hall. Now,
Justus says she does not regret her
decision to live in what is normally
all-graduate housing.
"It's totally awesome," she said.
"It's really close to everything, and I
have a huge single. None of my
neighbors come by to visit me, so I
actually get work done. My only
complaint is that I have to walk a

ranked 68th out of the 69 students in

"When it got to me, there were a

sucked, so I decided to wait a few
days," Vaughn said. He spent two or
three days living in a local motel be

"The biggest problem is that

come back mid-year," Vaughn said,

Stanford Housing is really feeling the
squeeze this quarter. Campus dorms and
houses often get an influx of new residents
winter quarter as students return from
abroad, but this year Housing Assignment
Services has had to cope with an unusual
ly large number of returning students, as
well as fewer students leaving their resi
dences after the fall.
As a result, common areas have been
turned into bedrooms, normally unoccu
pied cottages have been opened for hous
ing, students have been assigned to guest
rooms and upperclassmen have moved
into graduate dorms.

"We had about 20 to 30 more students
than normal need housing this winter than
in previous winters, presumably because
more students were coming back from
overseas," said Director of Housing As
signment Services Todd Benson. "Al
though this may not sound like a lot. it is
significant, because the housing system is
generally full in winter. We also had about
20 to 30 fewer students than usual leave
housing at the end of fall. The result of
both these was to need to find extra spaces
in winter."
According to Benson, the University
added spaces to between 8 and 10 under
graduate residences, with no undergradu
ate residence increasing in size by more
than three students.
