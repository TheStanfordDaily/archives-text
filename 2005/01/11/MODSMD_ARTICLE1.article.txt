# Housing shortage reported
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Housing is really feeling the
squeeze this quarter. Campus dorms and
houses often get an influx of new residents
winter quarter as students return from
abroad, but this year Housing Assignment
Services has had to cope with an unusual
ly large number of returning students, as
well as fewer students leaving their resi
dences after the fall.
As a result, common areas have been
turned into bedrooms, normally unoccu
pied cottages have been opened for hous
ing, students have been assigned to guest
rooms and upperclassmen have moved
into graduate dorms.

"We had about 20 to 30 more students
than normal need housing this winter than
in previous winters, presumably because
more students were coming back from
overseas," said Director of Housing As
signment Services Todd Benson. "Al
though this may not sound like a lot. it is
significant, because the housing system is
generally full in winter. We also had about
20 to 30 fewer students than usual leave
housing at the end of fall. The result of
both these was to need to find extra spaces
in winter."
According to Benson, the University
added spaces to between 8 and 10 under
graduate residences, with no undergradu
ate residence increasing in size by more
than three students.

In Columbae, a cooperative house
where students change rooms every quar
ter and where this reporter lives, the addi
tion of two unexpected walk-ins forced the
house to hold a second rooming meeting
to find spots for them. .
"The decision was made sort of by fiat,
hut we dealt with it," said Columbae Res
ident Assistant Vince Dorie, a master's
student in biomedical informatics. "I do
think that the places that were most flexi
ble got the most screwed. Housing knows
that Columbae and Synergy switch rooms
every quarter, so they think it's easy to
cram two extra people in there."
