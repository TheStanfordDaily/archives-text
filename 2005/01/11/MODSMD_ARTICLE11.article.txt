On Jan. 11, 1978, The Daily ran a
story about the ASSU Council of
Presidents' campaign to get a student
representative on the Board of
Trustees. Below is an excerpt:
'"I think a student representative
on the Board of Trustees is very im
portant, and something every stu
dent should consider working for,'
said Steve Westly, ASSU Co-Presi
dent.
"Westly said the move would be a
strong sign that the University ac
cepts the capability and responsibili
ty of the student body. He noted that
many universities have student rep
resentatives on their boards of
trustees.
"'Currently,' he said, 'we do not
have any direct input into meetings
of the Board of trustees. We don't
want to be deciding policy,' he said,
'but we do feel we have the right to
input on the University' policy deci
sions.'
"Asked whether he had any spe
cific issues in mind, Westly said the
student representative on the board
would not lobby 'unless the student
body demonstrated one concerted
opinion in favor of action.' He indi
cated that the campaign to get a stu
dent on the board was aimed only at
increasing student say in university
policy.
"Westly said he felt the proposal
has a better chance now than in pre
vious years because of 'improved re
lations between the SSU and the
Board of Trustees."
On Jan. 11, 1989, The Daily ran a
story about an essay that then-Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
wrote (and also published as an ad

vertisement in The Daily) entitled
"Reflections on Racial Understand
ing." It was written in response to
racist incidents that took place at
Stanford and other college campuses
the previous spring. Below is an ex
cerpt:
"(Kennedy) begins his essay by
writing that several students urged
him to write a 'thoughtful paper'
about the impact of racist incidents,
such as the one in which two white
freshmen upset several house mem
bers by defacing a poster in Ujamaa
House, the black theme house.
"Kennedy probably had other in
centives as well. He has been quoted
as saying that 'the Ujamaa incident
gave rise to the need to put some of
[the President's office's| policies and
perspectives on paper.'
"Kennedy may have also felt a
certain urgency in writing his essay
because some students and adminis
trators have said Stanford's image
has taken a beating due to national
media attention on such racist events
as that in Ujamaa.
"So, while many outsiders could
be led to believe that the University
is 'an institute beset by racial inci
dents,' Kennedy writes that 'at Stan
ford... we should grit our teeth and
move ahead, without elaborate mor
tification.
"An important factor in starting,
and keeping alive, discussion about
the weighty subject of campus racial
interactions is the president's timing.
Because his piece appears during the
first week of winter quarter, last
quarter's upsetting incidents — like
the on-campus circulation of anti-
Semitic fliers, for example — are still
fresh in most student's memories.
