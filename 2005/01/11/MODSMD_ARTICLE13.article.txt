# SOCIAL INNOVATION
## Springboard forward: 'A job is just the beginning' 
### ADAM STONE LIJA MCHUGH 
This week, we interview Elliott Brown, Class of '89,
and founder of Springboard Forward, a non-profit career
development organization.
Springboard Forward provides skills development and
job coaching for low-wage workers. Based in Mountain
View, Springboard works with employers to provide their
low-wage employees with the skills and confidence to
advance their careers.
Elliott Brown won an Ashoka Fellowship in 2(XH, a
prestigious award for top social entrepreneurs and a
"Social Capitalist Award" in the Jan. 2005 issue of Fast
Company.
Adam Stone and Lija McHugh: Springboard Forward
takes a unique approach to helping the economically
disadvantaged. What is the idea behind its model?
Elliott Brown: If you look at the system of services and
opportunities available for people in low-income com
munities, it is obvious that this system is broken.
There are services to help people who are unem
ployed and poor to find jobs. But there are another 50
percent who are employed and poor, and there is almost
nothing available in terms of services and opportunities
for that group of people.
If you don't focus on what is next for these employ
ees, all you're doing is moving people from being unem
ployed and poor to working and poor. It creates a lack of
hope. Springboard aims to change that feeling of hope
lessness through skill development and job coaching.
AS & L.I: Springboard is hired by employers to work
with their employees. What does Springboard offer the
businesses it works with?
EB: When you translate the problem of hopelessness to
the business side, that lack of hope creates a workforce
that lacks engagement creating high turnover, low reten
tion, and poor customer service. If people don't want to
be there, it's going to show.
What we're trying to do is put the two together. We
help low-wage workers get that light bulb to go on that
says, "Wow, I can do a lot more than I thought I could
do." We then help them realize what it is that they real
ly want to do now that they realize that they can do
more. On the corporate side, companies are paying for
us to do this for their employees because they get a bet
ter workforce.
I was talking with someone a couple days ago, and he
said, "So you run a business of hope." I think that is the
core of what we're trying to do.
AS & IJ: You've mentioned before that particular class
es at Stanford has an large impact on the work you do
now. What were the most influential classes you took
while at Stanford?
EB: Two of the most influential classes I took were
taught by Prof. Albert Bandura in psychology. His theo
ry of "self-efficacv" just blew me away. He focuses on
how behavior gets reinforced by current experiences,
rather than just past experiences.
He also introduced me to Delancey Street, one of the
best examples of social entrepreneurship around.
Delancey Street used his theory of self-efficacy to create
a self-sustaining community for ex-convicts and recover
ing addicts. I heard about that when I was your age, and
I decided, that's what I want to do.
AS & IT: You've won several awards as a result of your
work. Why do you think the social entrepreneurship
movement has become so popular?
EB: What I think is exciting about the movement is that
people can come to it from two different sides. If your
goal in life is to make the world a better place, there is
no more exciting place to be than the social entrepre
neurship movement. The movement involves the bright
est people and the biggest ideas. Winning the Ashoka
Fellowship was a validation from the social entrepre
neurship side.
From the other side, there are people who mainly do
business, but also want to do more to make the world
better. Winning the Fast Company award was a valida
tion on the business side. It's business entrepreneurs that
read the magazine. They will say. "These people are
changing the world using the free-market system. I like
that, and I want to be a part of that. How can I help?"
AS & U: Students are often interested in getting
involved in non-profits but don't know how. How can
students help Springboard Forward?
EB: I think there a lot of ways. We need someone to
manage our Web site, and a lot of students now have that
capability. I think that the opportunity is there if people
have skills that they want to bring, as well as an interest
in watching the progress of an organization.
I am always open to talking to students and answering
questions. There is a lot of opportunity, and we have a lot
of stuff to do.

I decided, that's what I want to do.
AS & IT: You've won several awards as a result of your
work. Why do you think the social entrepreneurship
movement has become so popular?
EB: What I think is exciting about the movement is that
people can come to it from two different sides. If your
goal in life is to make the world a better place, there is
no more exciting place to be than the social entrepre
neurship movement. The movement involves the bright
est people and the biggest ideas. Winning the Ashoka
Fellowship was a validation from the social entrepre
neurship side.
From the other side, there are people who mainly do
business, but also want to do more to make the world
better. Winning the Fast Company award was a valida
tion on the business side. It's business entrepreneurs that
read the magazine. They will say. "These people are
changing the world using the free-market system. I like
that, and I want to be a part of that. How can I help?"
AS & U: Students are often interested in getting
involved in non-profits but don't know how. How can
students help Springboard Forward?
EB: I think there a lot of ways. We need someone to
manage our Web site, and a lot of students now have that
capability. I think that the opportunity is there if people
have skills that they want to bring, as well as an interest
in watching the progress of an organization.
I am always open to talking to students and answering
questions. There is a lot of opportunity, and we have a lot
of stuff to do.

This week, we interview Elliott Brown, Class of '89,
and founder of Springboard Forward, a non-profit career
development organization.
Springboard Forward provides skills development and
job coaching for low-wage workers. Based in Mountain
View, Springboard works with employers to provide their
low-wage employees with the skills and confidence to
advance their careers.
Elliott Brown won an Ashoka Fellowship in 2(XH, a
prestigious award for top social entrepreneurs and a
"Social Capitalist Award" in the Jan. 2005 issue of Fast
Company.
Adam Stone and Lija McHugh: Springboard Forward
takes a unique approach to helping the economically
disadvantaged. What is the idea behind its model?
Elliott Brown: If you look at the system of services and
opportunities available for people in low-income com
munities, it is obvious that this system is broken.
There are services to help people who are unem
ployed and poor to find jobs. But there are another 50
percent who are employed and poor, and there is almost
nothing available in terms of services and opportunities
for that group of people.
If you don't focus on what is next for these employ
ees, all you're doing is moving people from being unem
ployed and poor to working and poor. It creates a lack of
hope. Springboard aims to change that feeling of hope
lessness through skill development and job coaching.
AS & L.I: Springboard is hired by employers to work
with their employees. What does Springboard offer the
businesses it works with?
EB: When you translate the problem of hopelessness to
the business side, that lack of hope creates a workforce
that lacks engagement creating high turnover, low reten
tion, and poor customer service. If people don't want to
be there, it's going to show.
What we're trying to do is put the two together. We
help low-wage workers get that light bulb to go on that
says, "Wow, I can do a lot more than I thought I could
do." We then help them realize what it is that they real
ly want to do now that they realize that they can do
more. On the corporate side, companies are paying for
us to do this for their employees because they get a bet
ter workforce.
I was talking with someone a couple days ago, and he
said, "So you run a business of hope." I think that is the
core of what we're trying to do.
AS & IJ: You've mentioned before that particular class
es at Stanford has an large impact on the work you do
now. What were the most influential classes you took
while at Stanford?
EB: Two of the most influential classes I took were
taught by Prof. Albert Bandura in psychology. His theo
ry of "self-efficacv" just blew me away. He focuses on
how behavior gets reinforced by current experiences,
rather than just past experiences.
He also introduced me to Delancey Street, one of the
best examples of social entrepreneurship around.
Delancey Street used his theory of self-efficacy to create
a self-sustaining community for ex-convicts and recover
ing addicts. I heard about that when I was your age, and
I decided, that's what I want to do.
