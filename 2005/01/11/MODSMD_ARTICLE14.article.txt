# Gadgets even a fuzzy will love

Maybe you got a gift card from the grandparents, or maybe
you want to organize your pictures, songs and files and start
the new year on the right foot — whatever the reason, here
are four gadgets that anyone can appreciate.
— Michelle Keller

MP3 PLAYER: Apple iPon Photo
Tiie likely user: Always has a digi
tal camera on hand, whether it's on
her phone, her PDA or her boyfriend.
So hot? With a gorgeous color
screen — 220-by-176-pixel resolution
and 65,536 colors — the iPod photo is
pure eye candy. The storage capacity
is pretty kick-ass — 40 GB or 60 GB
— so you can store all of your slide
shows and listen to every song you
can possibly think of. You can also
plug it to a TV so that all your pals
can view your pictures.
Ok not? Heavier than the other
iPods (6.4 oz. compared to the slim
3.2 oz. iPod mini) and pricey. Is it
really worth it to plunk down $499
for the 40 GB or $599 for the 60 GB
just to be able to amuse (or bore)
your friends with the pictures from
your last 10 summer vacations?
PHONE: Nokia N-Gage Ql)
Gaming Phone
The likely user: When Grand Theft
Auto San Andreas was released, his
drawmates didn't see him for days.
So hot? You can play 3D high-reso
lution games — anywhere. And it is
much cooler than your Gameboy:
You can play multiplayer games
using the built-in Wireless capabili
ties, and the hot-swap MMC-card slot
makes it easy to swap games or
expand the memory. You can log on
to the N-Gage Web site to learn new
gaming tips. Plus, when you take a
break from your games, the phone
has the latest e-mail and messaging
capabilities.
Or not? The limited number of
games available is rather dismal for
the game addict — at least for now.

PDA: HP IPAQ r/1715
The likely user: The ultimate
obsessive-compulsive, he's got every
minute of his life scheduled, from
what he'll be doing in the next 20
minutes to what he'll be doing six
years from now.
So hot? This PDA uses a Windows
Mobile-based format, which makes it
easy to use and sync with the pro
grams you have come to know and
love (Outlook, Word, Excel and
Internet Explorer). You can also eas
ily expand the memory slot, making it
easy to store files, music and pictures.
Or not? The built-in MP3 player is a
cool idea, but you have to use
Windows Media Player — and the
memory is so small (32 MB) that you
can't hold more than six or seven
songs unless you purchase an extra
memory card.
MULTI-TOOL: Victorinox
SWISSMEMORY USB
The likely user: Likes to be pre
pared for anything — from camping
trips to last-minute student group
meetings to working on a plane while
jet-setting to her next interview.
So hot? It's still equipped with your
typical knife, scissors, screwdriver
and nail file, but it also includes a
flash memory drive — up to 512M8
—so you'll never be without your
files again. You can even detach the
memory stick from the knife so that
you can carry it on the plane — sans
the knives — and security won't give
you a hard time.
Or not? You'll look like a dork
when you compare it to your friends'
regular Swiss Army knives, but since
when did that ever bother you?
