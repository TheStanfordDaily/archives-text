# Is it a cockroach? A robot?
## Artificial intelligence takes a new form when Stanford researchers mix robotics with biology 
### JESSICA LIN 
When most people imagine artificial intelligence.
Star Wars robots and human-like figures come to
mind. But rather than staying in the box, Stanford
researchers in the Engineering Department are look
ing at other creatures to model in their artificial intel
ligence projects, specifically insects. These sprawl
robots, as they have been nicknamed, are manufac
tured using a novel technique, making them more
durable, which will increase the number of functions
they can provide once they are out on the field.
This sprawl project is led by Engineering Prof.
Mark Cutkosky. The Daily took an opportunity to
chat with this innovative robotics researcher to find
out more.
The Daily: Why are you designing robots that imitate
animals as opposed to humans?
Mark Cutkosky: There are some things that animals
can do much better than humans, like climb walls
and run very fast. The fastest cockroaches can run 53
body-lengths per second. Even the slower ones can
do about 15 body lengths per second. If you could
run at 55 body-lengths per second you'd be going

about 55 mph.
Also, for the amount of intelligence that we're
actually able to put into small robots, insects are a
much better target than mammals — let alone
humans — in terms of behaviors and learning.
TI): Where did the idea of hiomimetic robots origi
nate — and when did you get involved?
!MC: I think that robots have always, to some extent,
been inspired by animals or humans. That's part of
what the historical dream behind having robots is all
about. What is new is that we can start to build and
control them more as nature does. The days of "tin
men" robots are over.
We started 1999 and built our first bio-inspired
running hexapod in January 2000. Its name was
Sprawlita.
TI): How are hiomimetic robots — robots that take
their inspiration from nature — being used today?
MC: Already, some bio-inspired robots are starting to
make it into the field. One of our collaborators,
Martin Buehler — who was formerly at McGill
University and is now heading up a robotics group at

Boston Dynamics Inc. — has a version of another
hexapod [six-legged robot] called RHex that is being
evaluated by the military.
Tl): What Ls your favorite part of the robotics project?
MC: Learning about biology and putting that knowl
edge to work in real devices.
TI): What is the most challenging part of the project?
MC: Figuring out how to make something that comes
even tolerably close to capturing some of the sophis
tication that we see in biological structures.
TI): Who works on this project besides yourself and
what do they do?
MC: I have a team of about 10 people at Stanford. In
addition, we are collaborating with similar teams
from various universities, working with researchers in
biology and robotics departments.
We learn a great deal from the biologists about
how animals actually are built and work. We give [the
biologists], in return, simplified approximations that
we and they can test to see how well we understand
the principles. It is much, much easier to do experi
ments on a robot than on a live animal. The robot is
far more cooperative.
TI): Is it harder to design insect-like robots as
opposed to human-like robots?
MC: I think it's easier. Small animals are more spe
cialized than humans. Cockroaches, for example, only
do a few things really well: run fast, climb, hide, find
food, eat, reproduce. And our robots are only trying
excel at the first couple of those behaviors.
TI): How do you see these robots influencing the
technology of the future?
MC: There are many ways: Biomimetic engineering
has many applications. We have only recently
developed the necessary analysis and manufactur
ing methods to enable us to make biomimetic struc
tures — with multiple and varying materials prop
erties, embedded sensing and propulsion.
So while robots are a particularly exciting appli
cation, biomimetic design is also useful for pros
thetics. sports equipment, perhaps even compo
nents of tools and vehicles.



The robots in Prof. Mark Cutkosky's lab are designed to look and act like cockroaches. By mimicking insect
movements, these tiny robots can move quickly and cover extensive amounts of terrain in a short time
span. Researchers believe that they could be used to detect mines or as tiny environmental sensors.

their inspiration from nature — being used today?
MC: Already, some bio-inspired robots are starting to
make it into the field. One of our collaborators,
Martin Buehler — who was formerly at McGill
University and is now heading up a robotics group at

Boston Dynamics Inc. — has a version of another
hexapod [six-legged robot] called RHex that is being
evaluated by the military.
Tl): What Ls your favorite part of the robotics project?
MC: Learning about biology and putting that knowl
edge to work in real devices.
TI): What is the most challenging part of the project?
MC: Figuring out how to make something that comes
even tolerably close to capturing some of the sophis
tication that we see in biological structures.
TI): Who works on this project besides yourself and
what do they do?
MC: I have a team of about 10 people at Stanford. In
addition, we are collaborating with similar teams
from various universities, working with researchers in
biology and robotics departments.
We learn a great deal from the biologists about
how animals actually are built and work. We give [the
biologists], in return, simplified approximations that
we and they can test to see how well we understand
the principles. It is much, much easier to do experi
ments on a robot than on a live animal. The robot is
far more cooperative.
TI): Is it harder to design insect-like robots as
opposed to human-like robots?
MC: I think it's easier. Small animals are more spe
cialized than humans. Cockroaches, for example, only
do a few things really well: run fast, climb, hide, find
food, eat, reproduce. And our robots are only trying
excel at the first couple of those behaviors.
TI): How do you see these robots influencing the
technology of the future?
MC: There are many ways: Biomimetic engineering
has many applications. We have only recently
developed the necessary analysis and manufactur
ing methods to enable us to make biomimetic struc
tures — with multiple and varying materials prop
erties, embedded sensing and propulsion.
So while robots are a particularly exciting appli
cation, biomimetic design is also useful for pros
thetics. sports equipment, perhaps even compo
nents of tools and vehicles.



The robots in Prof. Mark Cutkosky's lab are designed to look and act like cockroaches. By mimicking insect
movements, these tiny robots can move quickly and cover extensive amounts of terrain in a short time
span. Researchers believe that they could be used to detect mines or as tiny environmental sensors.
When most people imagine artificial intelligence.
Star Wars robots and human-like figures come to
mind. But rather than staying in the box, Stanford
researchers in the Engineering Department are look
ing at other creatures to model in their artificial intel
ligence projects, specifically insects. These sprawl
robots, as they have been nicknamed, are manufac
tured using a novel technique, making them more
durable, which will increase the number of functions
they can provide once they are out on the field.
This sprawl project is led by Engineering Prof.
Mark Cutkosky. The Daily took an opportunity to
chat with this innovative robotics researcher to find
out more.
The Daily: Why are you designing robots that imitate
animals as opposed to humans?
Mark Cutkosky: There are some things that animals
can do much better than humans, like climb walls
and run very fast. The fastest cockroaches can run 53
body-lengths per second. Even the slower ones can
do about 15 body lengths per second. If you could
run at 55 body-lengths per second you'd be going

about 55 mph.
Also, for the amount of intelligence that we're
actually able to put into small robots, insects are a
much better target than mammals — let alone
humans — in terms of behaviors and learning.
TI): Where did the idea of hiomimetic robots origi
nate — and when did you get involved?
!MC: I think that robots have always, to some extent,
been inspired by animals or humans. That's part of
what the historical dream behind having robots is all
about. What is new is that we can start to build and
control them more as nature does. The days of "tin
men" robots are over.
We started 1999 and built our first bio-inspired
running hexapod in January 2000. Its name was
Sprawlita.
TI): How are hiomimetic robots — robots that take
their inspiration from nature — being used today?
MC: Already, some bio-inspired robots are starting to
make it into the field. One of our collaborators,
Martin Buehler — who was formerly at McGill
University and is now heading up a robotics group at
