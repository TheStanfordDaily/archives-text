## Editorial Reform class-shopping system 
### 
For students and faculty to be able to start
each quarter with energy and confidence
rather than exhaustion and indecision, the
academic shopping period that marks the
beginning of each quarter should undergo a few
simple adjustments.
In particular, class information such as the syl
labus, anticipated class size and past instructor /
course evaluations should be made available to stu
dents before the official start of every quarter.
Under the current system, students have two
weeks to "shop" for classes at the beginning of each
quarter before they must officially register their
courses with the Registrar's Office. In theory, this
benefits both students by affording them flexibility
in creating their schedules and teachers by provid
ing them with classes comprised of genuinely inter
ested individuals.
In practice, however, class shopping as it cur
rently operates unnecessarily wastes time and ener
gy in the first two weeks of what are already short
academic terms.
Students lose time sitting through entire intro
ductory lectures that might not interest them, when
the real purpose of going to the class is simply to get
a syllabus. Teachers, on the other hand, feel pres
sured to use the first class meeting to "sell" their
course to prospective students rather than to begin
teaching the actual material.
Ultimately, the first couple of weeks of classes
leave students overwhelmed by the seemingly infi
nite number of permutations on their academic
schedules. By week two, many feel drained by the

sheer number of hours they spend on classes that
they will eventually end up dropping.
This situation could be much improved if more
aspects of class shopping could be done online, be
fore the official start of classes each quarter.
All faculty could post copies of their class syllabi
with information about course readings, assign
ments and grading procedures — on a Web re
source such as Course Work or Axess so that stu
dents could look at detailed class information over
breaks before the start of classes.
In addition, the ASSIJ Course Guide, an online
handbook of student evaluations of specific classes
and instructors, could be regularly updated to in
clude recently added courses and teachers. Its en
tries are currently outdated by three or four years,
leaving students who are curious about a new class,
new teacher or the evolution of an old class without
any information.
While students would still be able to physically
attend classes during the shopping period of the
first two weeks of the quarter, those who checked
out classes ahead of time would be more prepared
to begin their quarter with a clearer picture of the
classes they are interested in.
These reforms for the current class shopping sys
tem could be achieved fairly easily, as the structures
needed to place syllabi or course evaluations on the
Web already exist. With a little organization and
funding, the shopping period at Stanford could con
ceivably find students excited and open-minded —
instead of stressed and overwhelmed — about the
start of a new quarter.
