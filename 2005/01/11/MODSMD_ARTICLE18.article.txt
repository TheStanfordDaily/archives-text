## Guide to making your own snow trip 
### CHRIS HOLT 
From what I've heard, a lot of
dorms did not hold their annual
snow trips this past weekend be
cause of — ironically — snow. The
administration decided that send
ing several dorms in cramped buses
through blizzard conditions might
be a liability. But somehow, ship
ping hundreds of horny college stu
dents to a two-room cabin with a
10-person capacity has never been
presumed hazardous.
Because I know my first snow
trip was an event to remember, I
thought I 'd help guide all you bro
ken-hearted freshmen through the
average snow trip. This will save
you the 4- to 12-hour drive and
allow you to simulate the events
right here on campus.
First, you need to find a hot tub.
Most of the action on a snow trip
does not actually happen on the
slopes, but in a 6-foot-wide hot tub
choked with chlorine, beer cans
and the 50 hairiest people in your
hall.
To simulate this snow trip pas
time on campus, sneak into an ath
letic facility and use the medical
tubs. While being chased out by a
disgruntled physical therapist, grab
a bag of ice. Toss this on the ground
and throw yourself into it.
This will simulate the feeling of
drunkenly falling out of the hot tub
and into the snow. As an added
bonus, the resulting head injury
will simulate what you do on the
slopes the next day when you try to

show off for that girl down the hall.
Now, all the PHEs want you to
know how altitude affects how
much you can drink, play, eat,
breathe and masturbate. You
should understand that the hot tub
also affects the level of alcohol you
can handle.
To simulate the feeling of drink
ing at altitude, you should go to the
highest place on campus. Climb ei
ther Hoover Tower or to the top of
the Psych Building. Once there,
you should drink. Afterward, fall
four stories. The resulting decrease
in your breathing rate will simulate
the conditions altitude has on the
body.
During snow trip, many people
choose to go skiing or snowboard
ing, and the rest stay in the cabin
and place bets on which of their
skiing kin will end up with which
injury.
To simulate this on campus, sit
around near the Quad or White
Plaza. Wait for the townie skate
boarders to show up, and quietly
place your bets on either the spiky
haired poser or the baggy-pants
wannabe biting it first.
To simulate the smell of a Tahoe
cabin after the skiers have gotten
back for the day, you would have to
get a moose to die in each one of
your ski socks, and then soak your
long underwear in a possum
smoothie. The resulting smell + 70
people + a small cabin = what is
commonly referred to as "altitude
sickness."
Go to the shower of your dorm

and hang up dirty ski socks on the
windows, on the ground, in the
stalls. This will simulate the smell
and decor of a Tahoe lodge make
out room.
Grab some random people from
the halls and go nuts. Tell them to
start spreading rumors about you,
which wilfbe perpetuated and em
bellished for the rest of the school
year. You'll be known as that
"guy" or "girl" who did that
"thing" on snow trip involving
"two other people," "the shower"
and possibly "the bus driver."
What you do on snow trip —
and the reputation you create —
marks you like a scarlet letter.
Make sure your letter involves
somebody hot.
Snow trip may sound like a two
day party with no redeeming edu
cational value, but this is untrue.
It's a great way to get to know your
dormmates, a great way to get off
campus and relax and a great way
to learn more about yourself.
Last year, for instance. I learned
that I can sleep underneath a pool
table with three other people while
two others make out on top of the
table and I am forced to muffle the
sounds with my own used de
ceased-moose-smelling ski socks.
Freshmen, you don't know what
you're missing.

breathe and masturbate. You
should understand that the hot tub
also affects the level of alcohol you
can handle.
To simulate the feeling of drink
ing at altitude, you should go to the
highest place on campus. Climb ei
ther Hoover Tower or to the top of
the Psych Building. Once there,
you should drink. Afterward, fall
four stories. The resulting decrease
in your breathing rate will simulate
the conditions altitude has on the
body.
During snow trip, many people
choose to go skiing or snowboard
ing, and the rest stay in the cabin
and place bets on which of their
skiing kin will end up with which
injury.
To simulate this on campus, sit
around near the Quad or White
Plaza. Wait for the townie skate
boarders to show up, and quietly
place your bets on either the spiky
haired poser or the baggy-pants
wannabe biting it first.
To simulate the smell of a Tahoe
cabin after the skiers have gotten
back for the day, you would have to
get a moose to die in each one of
your ski socks, and then soak your
long underwear in a possum
smoothie. The resulting smell + 70
people + a small cabin = what is
commonly referred to as "altitude
sickness."
Go to the shower of your dorm

and hang up dirty ski socks on the
windows, on the ground, in the
stalls. This will simulate the smell
and decor of a Tahoe lodge make
out room.
Grab some random people from
the halls and go nuts. Tell them to
start spreading rumors about you,
which wilfbe perpetuated and em
bellished for the rest of the school
year. You'll be known as that
"guy" or "girl" who did that
"thing" on snow trip involving
"two other people," "the shower"
and possibly "the bus driver."
What you do on snow trip —
and the reputation you create —
marks you like a scarlet letter.
Make sure your letter involves
somebody hot.
Snow trip may sound like a two
day party with no redeeming edu
cational value, but this is untrue.
It's a great way to get to know your
dormmates, a great way to get off
campus and relax and a great way
to learn more about yourself.
Last year, for instance. I learned
that I can sleep underneath a pool
table with three other people while
two others make out on top of the
table and I am forced to muffle the
sounds with my own used de
ceased-moose-smelling ski socks.
Freshmen, you don't know what
you're missing.

From what I've heard, a lot of
dorms did not hold their annual
snow trips this past weekend be
cause of — ironically — snow. The
administration decided that send
ing several dorms in cramped buses
through blizzard conditions might
be a liability. But somehow, ship
ping hundreds of horny college stu
dents to a two-room cabin with a
10-person capacity has never been
presumed hazardous.
Because I know my first snow
trip was an event to remember, I
thought I 'd help guide all you bro
ken-hearted freshmen through the
average snow trip. This will save
you the 4- to 12-hour drive and
allow you to simulate the events
right here on campus.
First, you need to find a hot tub.
Most of the action on a snow trip
does not actually happen on the
slopes, but in a 6-foot-wide hot tub
choked with chlorine, beer cans
and the 50 hairiest people in your
hall.
To simulate this snow trip pas
time on campus, sneak into an ath
letic facility and use the medical
tubs. While being chased out by a
disgruntled physical therapist, grab
a bag of ice. Toss this on the ground
and throw yourself into it.
This will simulate the feeling of
drunkenly falling out of the hot tub
and into the snow. As an added
bonus, the resulting head injury
will simulate what you do on the
slopes the next day when you try to

show off for that girl down the hall.
Now, all the PHEs want you to
know how altitude affects how
much you can drink, play, eat,
breathe and masturbate. You
should understand that the hot tub
also affects the level of alcohol you
can handle.
