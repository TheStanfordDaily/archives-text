## Honor MLK's memory by putting his principles into practice today 
### KAI STINCHCOMBE 
Next Monday, a broad spectrum
of Americans will honor Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. — broader than
that which ever honored him while
he was alive. At the time of his
death. King had taken controversial
stances in favor of striking workers
and against the war in Vietnam,
which alienated him from many
white Northern liberals. For the
first time. King had slipped off the
list of the top 10 most admired peo
ple in America.
Now that King is dead, it's much
easier to recast him as merely an op
ponent of legalized discrimination.

Those of us who are not segrega
tionists — most people on this cam
pus — can all pat ourselves on the
back and say we were on the right
side of history.
But that would be an injustice to
King's memory. It is better to re
member him by the things he would
fight for in today's world. Here are
four to start with:
Poverty wages: Since King's
death, the value of the minimum
wage has declined 36 percent from
$B.IS to $5.15 an hour and has de
creased even more relative to hous
ing prices. Poverty is increasing,
particularly among low-paid blacks,
even as corporate profits recover.

Meanwhile, the right to join a union
has been rolled back both in law and
by increasingly sophisticated anti
union campaigns.
As King said, "We must join the
war against poverty and believe in the
dignity of all work ... What makes [a
job) menial is that we don't pay folks
anything. Give somebody a job and
pay them some money so they can
live and educate their children and
buy a home and have the basic neces
sities of life. And no matter what the
job is. it takes on dignity."
King would have been con
cerned by the conclusions of the re
cent President's Advisory Commit
tee on Labor Practices' report at

Stanford: that we do not even mon
itor campus wages and so can't say
how many of our campus workers
live in poverty.
The Iraq war: King quoted a
Vietnamese Buddhist that "the
image of America will never again
be the image of revolution, freedom
and democracy, but the image of vi
olence and militarism." and he
called the U.S. government "the
greatest purveyor of violence in the
world today." King would argue
that the more we hunt enemies in
Iraq and ignore civilian casualties
that result from our actions, we will
turn sympathizers into enemies.
King would have favored arms

embargoes and an oil boycott
against the tyrant Hussein, but he
would have argued that only peace
ful uprising by the Iraqi people
could change the regime.
But King also objected to the ef
fect of the Vietnam war on Ameri
can society. As in his day, the Iraq
war is draining government re
sources from programs like Head
Start and No Child Left Behind, just
as they drained the war on poverty
in his time. Fortunately, blacks no
longer bear the disproportionate
burden of military service: Blacks
now enlist at the same rate as white
people; the disproportionately
black militarv is because blacks stav

in the military longer, perhaps be
cause they get a fairer shake there
than in civilian society. But it is nev
ertheless the case that military re
cruiters disproportionately target
poor people to pay the cost of our
nation's violent impulses.
Disenfranchisement of black
voters: It indicates a broader prob
lem with our failed crusade against
drugs that one in four black men are
incarcerated or under prison-sys
tem supervision. But more immedi
ately. barring former felons from
voting, like any purge of voters,
rapidly leads to opportunistic ma
black areas sounds like "playing the
race card." After the election, ev
eryone says the election's over, as
though the only point of voting
rights is to get your candidate elect
ed.
The "Patriot" Act: The founders
believed the only trustworthy gov
ernment was one divided against it
self and closely watched by its citi
zens. King learned this the hard way
as the target of an FBI smear cam
paign. The FBI wiretapped his
home, office, advisors and hotel
rooms when he traveled, investigat
ed his extramarital affairs, smeared
him as a homosexual, manipulated
funders of his organization, released
both real and fake documents to
friendly media sources, infiltrated
his organization, planted drugs on
supporters during "sneak and peek"
searches, and planted papers' on
trusted aides that made them appear
to be informants; creating a climate
of distrust within the organization.
The Patriot Act removes many of
the civil-society protections enacted
in the aftermath of the FBl's King
harassment campaign. It allows ex
ecutive branch officials to infiltrate

nipulation by politicians.
As with 1960s Jim Crow literacy
tests, Florida officials today applied
the test differently to blacks than
other demographic groups in order
to reduce black turnout. Felon-bar
ring would be less of a problem if it
didn't occur in the context of sys
tematic intimidation.
New ID checks at the polls and
new ties between prison records and
voting rights played right into the
fliers distributed in black neighbor
hoods saying that nobody with out
standing parking tickets could vote.
Lines were up to eight hours long
in black precincts in swing states, as
machines were mothballed and
moved to less-populated precincts.
Due to technology disparities,
machines in black areas were much
less likely to register countable
votes and were much more likely to
break down or malfunction. White
America has never paid enough at
tention to these issues. Before an
election nobody will stand up for the
rights of former felons; demanding
distribution of voting machines to

Injustice still abounds

political and religious organizations,
to operate secretly and without judi
cial review, and to keep searches se
cret from targets. It is not clear why
Congressional and court oversight
hampers counterterrorism, but it
does permits harassment of the sort
that King — and various contempo
rary peace groups — have experi
enced.
We honor King as an activist. It is
true that he changed the face of our
country, and we should celebrate
this achievement. But to truly honor
his visionary spirit we must look not
to the past, but to the future. King
dreamed that one day this nation
would rise up and live out the true
meaning of its creed. "We hold
these truths to be self-evident: that
all men are created equal." Until his
dream is realized, the best way to re
member King in death is to work to
ward the ideals he espoused in his
lifetime.
