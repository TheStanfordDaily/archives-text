Plenty of on-campus parties are
centered around kegs, funnels and
shot glasses, hut this was not the case
last night at Hillel at Stanford's
"Matzo Ball" party for the opening
of the Ziff Center. Hillel staff mem
bers and students hope that the Ziff
Center will become the nexus of the
Stanford Jewish community and a
place for students of all faiths to in
teract.
According to sophomore Sari
Bourne, social chair of the Jewish
Leadership Council, around 250 stu
dents flocked to the Ziff Center for
Jewish Campus Life, located on the
Row. to enjoy matzo ball soup, listen
to the Israeli Moshav Band, dance
and hang out with friends, both Jew
ish and non-Jewish.
"I made 150 matzo ball chicken

soups and they were quickly con
sumed." Bourne said.
Not even the pouring rain could
put a damper on the party.
"We were worried that the
turnout would be lower due to the
rain," said Adina Danzig, executive
director at Hillel.
According to Danzig, the bouncy
"jump house" could not be set up as
originally planned because of the
rain. But that did not keep students
from having a good time.
"I am thrilled that so many stu
dents in the community came and
celebrated tonight in spite of the
rain," Danzig said. "We have been
raising money for five years, and to
see so many people having a good
time is rewarding."
Others shared Danzig's excite

ment about the great turnout.
"It was ironic that as the party
started, it started pouring outside,"
Bourne said. "But it makes me so
happy that everything worked out.
Many people went inside and that
created a great bonding experience."
"There was a great turnout and a
lot of energy," said sophomore Carly
Posner. "1 look forward to the future
events at Hillel."
"The matzo balls were fluffy, the
soup was hot and the party exceeded
my wildest expectations," said fresh
man David Steinhardt.
Built in 1899, the house located
on the corner of Campus Drive and
Mayfield is a historic building in
tended fora single family. Although
sonic students thought that the site

should have been made into a resi
dence, Danzig explained that the
3,500 square-foot structure would
have been too small to house stu
dents.
"Since the house cannot funda
mentally be changed. I do not see
how it could have been made into a
residential hall," Danzig said, ex
plaining that the house had to be
preserved since it is a historic land
mark.
Many members in the Jewish
community hope that the success
will pave the way fora vibrant Jew
ish and campus community.
"The attendance tonight reflect
ed the excitement of the entire cam
pus about Hillel's opening," Danzig
said. "We hope this party sets the

"I am very happy that the Ziff
Center is finally the heart of the Jew
ish community," Steinhardt said. "I
really look forward to sharing my
faith with other members of the
wonderful Jewish community, and
to bond with many multifaceted peo
ple."
"It's a home for anyone to come
hang out," Bourne said.
"The party tonight was great for
the community, and someday, I hope
that there is a community center not
just for Jews, but for fhe entire Stan
ford community," said Jewish Stu
dent Life Coordinator David Rit
tberg.
