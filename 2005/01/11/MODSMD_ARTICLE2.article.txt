Plenty of on-campus parties are
centered around kegs, funnels and
shot glasses, hut this was not the case
last night at Hillel at Stanford's
"Matzo Ball" party for the opening
of the Ziff Center. Hillel staff mem
bers and students hope that the Ziff
Center will become the nexus of the
Stanford Jewish community and a
place for students of all faiths to in
teract.
According to sophomore Sari
Bourne, social chair of the Jewish
Leadership Council, around 250 stu
dents flocked to the Ziff Center for
Jewish Campus Life, located on the
Row. to enjoy matzo ball soup, listen
to the Israeli Moshav Band, dance
and hang out with friends, both Jew
ish and non-Jewish.
"I made 150 matzo ball chicken

soups and they were quickly con
sumed." Bourne said.
Not even the pouring rain could
put a damper on the party.
"We were worried that the
turnout would be lower due to the
rain," said Adina Danzig, executive
director at Hillel.
According to Danzig, the bouncy
"jump house" could not be set up as
originally planned because of the
rain. But that did not keep students
from having a good time.
"I am thrilled that so many stu
dents in the community came and
celebrated tonight in spite of the
rain," Danzig said. "We have been
raising money for five years, and to
see so many people having a good
time is rewarding."
