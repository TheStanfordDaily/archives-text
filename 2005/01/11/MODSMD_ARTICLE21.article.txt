# Sketch: Tales of Graduate Student Life
## It's called a sidewalk 
### 
We live in a fast-paced
world. I know this be
cause I've seen it on
TV. And read about it
in magazines.
Most of us have schedules so
packed, they would make an invest
ment banker quake. Coffee break
followed by tea break followed by
Jamba Juice followed by ... Well,
you get the idea.
I have no problems with this kind
of hectic life, especially when it
comes to everyday activity. The
more you pack into a day, the longer
you can sleep at night.
The problem, however, with run
ning to and fro with such vigor is
that you can often lose awareness of
your surroundings; everything
around you blurs together like a

special effect in a
bad movie. And
then you collide
with a hapless
pedestrian.
You see, as the
pressures and
tussles of higher
education
squeeze and jos
tle, you may be
forced into the
kind of risky be-

liavior that is usually only found on
the fringes of society. Like cycling.
The Farm is a big place. Appar
ently some journeys take so long
that one can spend up to 15 whole
minutes getting from residence to
department if restricted to travel
ling by foot.
Hence, the bike. At first glance,
the perfect solution to limited time
and lengthy distances. An elegant
device: two delicately balanced
wheels, an aerodynamic saddle, pre
cision mechanics. All poised to
work effortlessly together to get
from A to B.
And then the idiot cyclist gets
aboard.
Cyclists are the bane of campus
life (well not the exclusive bane —
there are other banes too, like un
dergraduates). Navigating the paths
that lead from one exciting class to
another on foot is fraught with diffi
culty, for any moment the two
wheeled terror may strike.
People on bikes don't seem to
understand that they're supposed to
look where they're going. And not
hit people. Or even nearly hit peo
ple, for that matter.
Actually, the tearing around on
campus paths is not my biggest
gripe. What I find most irritating is
when I'm ambling down Escondido
or Serra and I hear a squeak behind

rue; "Coming through, on your
right."
The aforementioned through
ways are commonly known as roads.
They have two parts: the bit in the
middle, which is for wheeled traffic,
and the sidewalk.
The interesting thing about the
sidewalk is that, as the name sug
gests, it's for walking (and possibly
siding). That is to say, take your bike
back where it belongs and stop dis
turbing my early-morning contem
plations.
Actually, as much as I encourage
cyclists to stick with the rest of the
vehicular traffic, the ones that do
that are also a hazard.
Apparently stop signs are op
tional if you're on two wheels.
What's more, if you run down one of
the tralfic-law-violating little fools,
you know who's going to get
blamed.
Even accepting the terrifying
danger and continuous irritation
that bicycles present, there are still
more problems.
For all its unadorned potential,
the bicycle is a particularly inelegant
mode of transport. Almost nobody
looks good on one — except for
maybe Gap people. Even Lance
Armstrong looks slightly ridiculous
in full cycling gear, and he's much
cooler than most of us could ever
hope to be.
And then there's the absurd at
tire. Cycle helmets are ungainly and
steeped in social stigma. Cycle clips
are ... well, if you're using cycle
clips, you're probably beyond help.
As for tucking your trousers into
your socks, well that's not the be
havior of the mentally stable.
Incidentally, I'm being a little un
fair focusing solely on cyclists. Much
of the above applies equally to other
personal-wheeled transport. Espe
cially to the riders of those little mo
torized scooters: You guys look re
ally odd. though I guess you get
bonus points for extreme laziness.
So there we have it. Cyclists are
dangerous, irritating and reckless,
and they look dreadful. And yet
people persist in threatening exis
tence. temper and good taste.
I only wish I could offer some
useful suggestions on how to deal
with the pedaling problem. Howev
er, I feel that all a poor pedestrian
can do is stick to the path less trav
elled and leap out of the way at the
sight of an approaching cycle gang.
