## Soto Tape Chronicles Road to the Super Bowl will go through the Steel City

The NIL playoffs have reached the Di
visional Championship round, and
it's time for football fans to show off
their prowess and divine next week
end's lucky winners.
In the NFC. the Birds will challenge the

Horns in a scries of contests
between rested runaway divi
sion winners and 8-8 Wild
Card survivors who just might
have found the winning touch
now that the regular season
has ended.
Against the Seahawks the
Rams showed glimpses of the
speed and aerial game that
gave them the nickname "the
Greatest Show on Turf" in
<u.i nnr\„ tl . w:i • j

the late 19905. The Vikings demolished their
eternal rivals at Lamheau Field, forcing
turnovers and a reexamination of the Brett
Havre mystique.
In the AFC the Big Three are still standing.
The biggest stories are the playoff debut of Of
fensive Rookie of the Year Ben Roethlisberg
er and the return of the chess match between
the world's greatest quarterback and the
world's greatest defensive mastermind.
So, without further ado, I bring you my
picks for the divisional playoff games. As a
warning: 1 am not known to predict anything
with much accuracy other than the hat game at
Stanford football games. Let's start with the
NFC:
St. Louis (+7) over ATLANTA
The Rams have beaten three playoff teams
in the last three weeks — the second-string
Eagles, the Jets in overtime to end the regular
season and make the playoffs, and the Sea
hawks on Saturday to advance to this round.
These victories will provide them with a much
needed momentum lift following a calamitous
losing streak that almost left them out of the
postseason, and an absurd feud between coach
Mike Martz and offensive tackle Kyle T'ui ley
that made them the laughingstock of the
league.
The Rams' defense withstood a late Seattle
push, stopping the home team at the five-yard
line on the final drive when Hasselbeck opted
not to run for the end/one even though it ap
peared that there was an open lane.
This week's opponent will be less forgiving.
Michael Vick will run roughshod over the
Rams if they give him the chance. The only
question is whether his team will show up to
support him. Vick is the most exciting player in
football, but his raw athleticism will be power
less to stop Torry Holt and Marshall Faulk.
It wouldn't surprise me if the Falcons ad
vance, but I'll take St. Louis plus I he points.
PHILADELPHIA (-9.5) over Minnesota
This is the most enigmatic game of the
weekend because both teams suffer from a
case of multiple-personality disorder. Will the
Vikings team that backed into the playoffs by
losing to humble Washington replace the dom
inating force that dismantled the Packers in
the cold? Will the T.0.-less Eagles fly to the
NFC title game, or will the rusty starters break
Philly's heart again?
After a month-long second-string experi
ment that produced losses to the Rams and
Bengals, who knows in what shape McNabb
and company will be. A team does not put to
gether a 13-3 record (13-1 until the last two
weeks) by chance, hut recent losses have put
the team on edge. Missing their top receiver
will only add to the pressure incurred by losing
three straight NFC championship games.
If the real Phillv shows up, nothing the
Vikings can do will save them. If the regular
season Vikings show up, it won't matter either

way. Philly will win, hut it will be
close.
PITTSBURGH (-9) over NY
Jets
The word on the street is that
Big Ben is healed and ready to put
his 25-game winning streak to the
test in the NFL playoffs. Having
watched the demolition joh the
hlack-and-gold backups put on
Buffalo to cap the season. I'm not
sure it really matters.
The Steelers beat the Jets in their
previous meeting 17-6. though Gang
Green led b-3 in the second half.
New York's hopes will ride on Curtis
Martin in his return to his home
town. but the top-ranked Steelers

Colts have something
to prove in Foxboro

defense will keep the ball out of the
end/one.
This is Pittsburgh's chance to
make a statement and remind New
England and Indy that the road to
the Super Bowl goes through the
Steel City.
Indianapolis (+2.5) over NEW
ENGLAND
If there is one game you should
stay home and watch instead of
going skiing, this is it.
Is this finally the year of Peyton's
revenge? The Patriots' vaunted sec
ondary that disrupted the Colts' of
fense in 2(M)3 is as deep as a kiddie
pool. Ty Law will not be present to
assault Marvin Harrison, and the

Colts have more receiving options
than they did last year.
However, this game will hinge on
New England's ability to run the
football, control the clock, and keep
Manning off the field. The noise and
cold in Foxboro (a balmy 31 degrees)
will aid the home team, and I predict
the game will be low scoring.
Can Manning continue the best
season by a quarterback ever? Can
he finally prove his playoff worth?
The game will be an instant classic,
and a late field goal will give Indy a
ticket to Pittsburgh.
