# Gymnasts start at No. 3
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When a team has no seniors, commen
tators usually say the team is "rebuilding."
Or they just wish the team better luck next
year.
Not so with this year's women's gym
nastics team.
After graduating five stellar athletes
and losing two would-be seniors to in
juries, the Cardinal are left without any se
nior leadership. Yet the coaches' presea
son poll has ranked Stanford third in the
nation — the team's highest preseason
ranking to date.
The ranking is likely due to the team's
third-place finish last year and its six-mem
ber freshman class that includes Tabitha
Yin and Elizabeth Tricase — internation
ally recognized gymnasts who competed in
the US Olympic trials this past summer.
Yin finished fourth and would have gone
to Athens had she not ruptured her
Achilles tendon just weeks before the
Games.
"For the coaches to give us a third-place
ranking with a whole new team of six
freshmen is unbelievably exciting." said
head coach Kristen Smyth, last year's Na
tional Coach of the Year. "1 think they rec
ognize the extremely high caliber of
Tabitha and Liz. It gives us confidence that
this year is not just a rebuilding year."
But Smyth is not too quick to get
wrapped up in the excitement of the third
place ranking.
"In terms of name recognition, interna
tional experience and skill level, this is the
best class our program has recruited," said
Smyth. "But only time will tell how far
they can go. I can't predict how the girls
will do until they put on a Stanford leotard
for the first time."
The new crop of freshmen will be led by
three juniors and two sophomores, making
a relatively small team of 11 members. The
already lean team will face the challenge of
coping with several injuries in the early
part of the season; in addition to Yin's in
jury, junior co-captain Jessica Louie is out
after spraining both ankles on the first day
of practice.
With Louie injured, junior co-captain
Natalie Foley will have to step up as the
team's leader. Foley led the team in the

Ail-Around last year and earned third
place in the nation on vault. She is strong
again this year with a new floor exercise
routine and a new full-twisting double lay
out dismount off the uneven bars.
"Nat has always been a leader in terms
of what she does on the floor of a meet and
how strong her work ethic is in the gym,"
Smyth said. "This year she has had to step
up to be a vocal leader."
The departure of last year's seniors has
not only left a hole in leadership on the
team, but also a new vulnerability on bal
ance beam. Firmly anchored by Lindsay
Wing, four-time Pac-10 champion on
beam. Stanford never drifted far from the
No. I ranking on beam last year. But with
three of their four best beam competitors
graduated, the team may wobble a bit be
fore hitting its stride again.
"It will be a whole new look for us on
beam this year." said Smyth.
Foley will step in to anchor the team,
and freshman Lauren Elmore will be the
starter, competing a unique roundoff
backhandspring layout. Junior Glyn
Sweets, sophomore Stacy Sprando, and
Tricase will round out the effort on beam.
And as soon as Yin is healthy, she will be
vying for the anchor spot as one of the na
tion's best athletes on the balance beam.
Along with their best ranking to date,
the Cardinal will face one of their most
challenging schedules yet. The Cardinal
will take on four of the five other teams
that finished in the top six at Nationals
last year — UCLA. Florida. Utah and
Alabama.
Mark your calendars for the home meet
against No. 1 UCLA in February and No.
4 Alabama in March. In a sport where ties
are more rare than perfect scores, Stan
ford tied Alabama for third place at Na
tionals last year and tied UCLA the last
time the Bruins came to the Farm.
The Cardinal will benefit from the fact
that these two meets are late in the season.
The freshmen will have garnered some ex
perience and the injured will have had
more time to heal. Smyth hopes that Yin
will be healthy enough to debut at the
UCLA meet.
Thanks to Yin, Tricase, and Foley, the
level of gymnastics at these meets will be a
step above the gymnastics that Stanford
fans have seen in the past, promises Smyth.

A peak into the practice gym confirms that
the tumbling on floor exercise will be high
er. the releases on uneven bars will be big

ger, and the skills on balance beam will be
more advanced.

Junior Glyn Sweets, one of only five upperclassmen, will shoulder high expectations for
the Stanford women's gymnastics team entering the 2005 campaign.
