# Wrestlers impressive at Lone Star Duals
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite being plagued with injuries, Stanford
wrestling (3-2,0-1 Pacific-10 Conference) pulled out two
impressive wins in three dual meets this Saturday at the
Lone Star Duals in Grand Prairie. Tex.
The Cardinal soundly beat Air Force 27-16 and then
staged an early comeback to earn an impressive 25-10 win
against Harvard. Only No. 5 Michigan proved to be too
much for the team, as the national-title-contending
Wolverines rolled to a 32-10 victory.
Overall. Stanford had a successful weekend in the face
of adversity.
"I think our fighting spirit was excellent," head coach
Steve Buddie said. "We came out expecting to win every
time we took the mat, and that is a great sign. Our condi
tioning was good, but we could still be sharper in our first
matches [because] we're a little slow out of the starting
gate sometimes."
The Cardinal were without starting wrestlers senior
Matt Gentry and sophomore lan Bork. both defending
NCAA champions in their respective 157-and 197-pound
weight classes. Gentry was sick, while Bork has a hyper
extended elbow. The team did not miss a step at 157
pounds, however.
Junior Ray Blake led the team with wins against all
three opponents, including an 11 -0 major decision against
Michigan's Charles Kalil. Blake was the only Stanford
wrestler to win all three of his matches, and he was also
the only wrestler to record a win against Michigan.

It's the individual performances that put the team
back on track," Buddie said. "This weekend was a great
step in getting us back on track. Our guys who have had
some weight issue's throughout the season looked great,
and those who had been healing injuries looked fine."
Other important performances came from juniors
Imad Kharbush at 174 pounds and Ryan Hagen at 184
pounds. Both wrestlers went 2-1 on the weekend and
pushed the team to the victories over the Crimson and
Falcons.
Kharbush made his first appearance on the mat since a
broken nose forced him to withdraw from the Tourna
ment of Champions in Reno on Dec. 19th in the midst of
a strong streak of matches. The protective mask that he
had to wear did not slow him down one bit. as he record
ed a 10-4 decision against Jacob Lillich of Air Force and
then destroyed Harvard's Jonathon Butler in a 13-0 major
decision. His strong rebound from the injury highlighted
his leadership on the team.
Air Force was the first of the three teams that Stanford
faced, and the Cardinal proved up to the task.
Paced by pins from 149-pound Josh Zupancic in 3:45
against Falcon Chris Niessen and 285-pound Shawn
Rit/enthaler in 6:45 against Kurt Skarstedt. Stanford out
wrestled the Falcons.
Stanford lost only three of the 10 weight classes,
though Air Force did record pins in all three of those vic
tories. keeping the match up in the air until Ritzenthaler's
pin.
The Cardinal's next opponent. Harvard, entered with
a certain degree of familiarity. Both universities compete

for the same recruits every year because they have simi
larly rigorous academic entrance standards.
Stanford's solid 25-10 victory seems to show that the
Cardinal have won the recruiting war against the East
Coast school. The victory was not assured at the start
though, as the Crimson shot out to an early 6-3 lead.
However, the Cardinal responded to the challenge and
reeled off a string of six wins that included four major
decisions.
The final task on Saturday was national force Michigan.
The Big Ten school recorded three major decisions
and one pin. which all but assured victory. The Cardinal
got most of their points from a forfeit at 125-pounds, as se
nior Nathan Peterson did not have to face a Wolverine.
Blake recorded a decision for Stanford and earned the
Cardinal's other points.
Michigan's dominance in eight of the 10 weight classes
showcased the depth of a true title contender. All in all. a
superior team dominated Stanford.
"While the score was 32-10. the dual was much closer
than that," Buddie said. "We had a handful of matches
that were very closely contested. If you had seen Michi
gan's bench after the dual, you would have thought they
had lost. Knowing that we are not too far behind a great
team like Michigan is very encouraging."
Stanford's next competition, the Menlo College Invi
tational, will take place on Sunday night at 7 p.m. in
Menlo Park, Calif.
The meet will be used to rest some key starters since
the tournament is small, while still providing mat time to
get experience.

"While the score was 32-10. the dual was much closer
than that," Buddie said. "We had a handful of matches
that were very closely contested. If you had seen Michi
gan's bench after the dual, you would have thought they
had lost. Knowing that we are not too far behind a great
team like Michigan is very encouraging."
Stanford's next competition, the Menlo College Invi
tational, will take place on Sunday night at 7 p.m. in
Menlo Park, Calif.
The meet will be used to rest some key starters since
the tournament is small, while still providing mat time to
get experience.
Despite being plagued with injuries, Stanford
wrestling (3-2,0-1 Pacific-10 Conference) pulled out two
impressive wins in three dual meets this Saturday at the
Lone Star Duals in Grand Prairie. Tex.
The Cardinal soundly beat Air Force 27-16 and then
staged an early comeback to earn an impressive 25-10 win
against Harvard. Only No. 5 Michigan proved to be too
much for the team, as the national-title-contending
Wolverines rolled to a 32-10 victory.
Overall. Stanford had a successful weekend in the face
of adversity.
"I think our fighting spirit was excellent," head coach
Steve Buddie said. "We came out expecting to win every
time we took the mat, and that is a great sign. Our condi
tioning was good, but we could still be sharper in our first
matches [because] we're a little slow out of the starting
gate sometimes."
The Cardinal were without starting wrestlers senior
Matt Gentry and sophomore lan Bork. both defending
NCAA champions in their respective 157-and 197-pound
weight classes. Gentry was sick, while Bork has a hyper
extended elbow. The team did not miss a step at 157
pounds, however.
Junior Ray Blake led the team with wins against all
three opponents, including an 11 -0 major decision against
Michigan's Charles Kalil. Blake was the only Stanford
wrestler to win all three of his matches, and he was also
the only wrestler to record a win against Michigan.

It's the individual performances that put the team
back on track," Buddie said. "This weekend was a great
step in getting us back on track. Our guys who have had
some weight issue's throughout the season looked great,
and those who had been healing injuries looked fine."
Other important performances came from juniors
Imad Kharbush at 174 pounds and Ryan Hagen at 184
pounds. Both wrestlers went 2-1 on the weekend and
pushed the team to the victories over the Crimson and
Falcons.
Kharbush made his first appearance on the mat since a
broken nose forced him to withdraw from the Tourna
ment of Champions in Reno on Dec. 19th in the midst of
a strong streak of matches. The protective mask that he
had to wear did not slow him down one bit. as he record
ed a 10-4 decision against Jacob Lillich of Air Force and
then destroyed Harvard's Jonathon Butler in a 13-0 major
decision. His strong rebound from the injury highlighted
his leadership on the team.
Air Force was the first of the three teams that Stanford
faced, and the Cardinal proved up to the task.
Paced by pins from 149-pound Josh Zupancic in 3:45
against Falcon Chris Niessen and 285-pound Shawn
Rit/enthaler in 6:45 against Kurt Skarstedt. Stanford out
wrestled the Falcons.
Stanford lost only three of the 10 weight classes,
though Air Force did record pins in all three of those vic
tories. keeping the match up in the air until Ritzenthaler's
pin.
The Cardinal's next opponent. Harvard, entered with
a certain degree of familiarity. Both universities compete

for the same recruits every year because they have simi
larly rigorous academic entrance standards.
Stanford's solid 25-10 victory seems to show that the
Cardinal have won the recruiting war against the East
Coast school. The victory was not assured at the start
though, as the Crimson shot out to an early 6-3 lead.
However, the Cardinal responded to the challenge and
reeled off a string of six wins that included four major
decisions.
The final task on Saturday was national force Michigan.
The Big Ten school recorded three major decisions
and one pin. which all but assured victory. The Cardinal
got most of their points from a forfeit at 125-pounds, as se
nior Nathan Peterson did not have to face a Wolverine.
Blake recorded a decision for Stanford and earned the
Cardinal's other points.
Michigan's dominance in eight of the 10 weight classes
showcased the depth of a true title contender. All in all. a
superior team dominated Stanford.
