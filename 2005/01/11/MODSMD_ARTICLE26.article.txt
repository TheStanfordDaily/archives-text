# No. 6 Cardinal swimmers kick off home campaign against Pacific
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alter a month of preseason meets and
another month of training, the No. 6
women's swimming and diving team is
ready to begin its pursuit of the school's
ninth national championship. After disap
pointing fifth- and sixth-place finishes in
the last two seasons, they hope to prove
themselves contenders on the national
scene.
As predicted at the beginning of the
season. Auburn and Georgia are at the top
of the national rankings. Right behind
them are Florida. Texas and Arizona, fol
lowed closely by Stanford and SMIJ.
A loss to Texas with a short-handed
squad is the only blemish on the Cardinal's
preseason record, which featured a com
manding victory over Hawaii and a first
place finish in a field of 20 teams at the
Speedo Cup.
The team considers its early success a
preview of the rest of the season.

"The preseason went really well," se
nior Kirsten Gilbert said. "Lots of people
swam incredibly fast for being so early in
the season I think that foreshadows good
things to come."
Head coach Richard Ouick is equally
positive about the team's progress. Even
after the loss to Texas, Quick had good
things to say about individual perfor
mances and the team's competitiveness.
The newest members of the team espe
cially have made an impression.
"We have freshmen that came in and
are looking way better than we expected,
way better than our coaches expected," se
nior Sarah Jones said. "The feeling as a
team has been one of the best that we've
had. so it's been looking really good. "
With a bit of ground to make up in the
national rankings, Stanford will look to
continue posting victories and NCAA
qualifying times over the course of Pacific
-10 Conference competition.
This weekend, the Cardinal will open
their home season with a non-conference

meet, hosting the unranked Pacific Tigers.
The Tigers lost their first three dual
meets, falling to Florida State, California
and Hawaii. They posted team wins at both
the Speedo Invitational in October and the
IJNLV Invitational in December. In
Hawaii last week, they earned four com
manding victories, defeating Arkansas,
Houston. New Hampshire, and Nebraska-
Omaha in head-to-head competition.
Pacific's top performers are Ziada Jar
dine. Jennifer Radecke. Lyndsey Mc-
Namee and Ja-Neil Bragg, who each won
four races in a day against Arkansas and
Houston. Jacqueline Moirao added two
race wins against New Hampshire and
Omaha-Nebraska.
In what promises to be one of the most
competitive match-ups of the meet. Stan
ford's freshman Olympian. Caroline
Bruce, will face Pacific's freshman star Jar
dine in the breaststroke.
Jardine. a seven-year veteran of the
South African national team, has been called
her country's best breaststrokcr and recent

ly placed 16th at the FIN A World Swimming
Championships in the 50-meter breast.
While winning meets such as this week
end's will help the Cardinal move up in the
rankings, it is individual times which will
be most important in determining success
at the end of the season.
Already in the preseason, many of the
Stanford swimmers have recorded nation
al qualifying times, and they hope to add
several more against Pacific and over the
course of the conference season.
In the three meets in December. Bruce
achieved "A" standard times in the 100-
meter breaststroke, 200-meter breast
stroke and 200-meter individual medley,
as well as "B" times in three more events.
Senior Lacey Boutwell and junior
Laura Davis each contributed three "B"
times, while junior Dana Kirk and sopho
more Desiree Stahley had two apiece.
Sophomores Morgan Hentzen and Lauren
Costella and freshmen Elizabeth Durot.

The Cardinal women's diving squad won't face
Pacific, but it will be in action in two weeks
against Arizona.
Brooke Bishop and Erica Liu each
posted one.
An "A" time provides an auto
matic qualification to the NCAA
Championship, while "B" times are
submitted for consideration when
determining the championship field.
Alongside the swimmers, the
diving squad has been training hard
since the end of the preseason.
The top pair, senior Ashlee
Rosenthal and sophomore Cassidy
Krug, look to build upon early suc
cesses. Senior Erin Lashnits, fresh
man Katie Lampe. junior Sara Bowl
ing and sophomore Brooke Sullivan
continue to improve and will work to
contribute good scores for the team.
The divers will have an extra
week to train before they begin
competing.
Pacific does not have divers on
its roster, so the Cardinal squad will
see its first action of the new year in
Arizona in two weeks.

meets, falling to Florida State, California
and Hawaii. They posted team wins at both
the Speedo Invitational in October and the
IJNLV Invitational in December. In
Hawaii last week, they earned four com
manding victories, defeating Arkansas,
Houston. New Hampshire, and Nebraska-
Omaha in head-to-head competition.
Pacific's top performers are Ziada Jar
dine. Jennifer Radecke. Lyndsey Mc-
Namee and Ja-Neil Bragg, who each won
four races in a day against Arkansas and
Houston. Jacqueline Moirao added two
race wins against New Hampshire and
Omaha-Nebraska.
In what promises to be one of the most
competitive match-ups of the meet. Stan
ford's freshman Olympian. Caroline
Bruce, will face Pacific's freshman star Jar
dine in the breaststroke.
Jardine. a seven-year veteran of the
South African national team, has been called
her country's best breaststrokcr and recent

ly placed 16th at the FIN A World Swimming
Championships in the 50-meter breast.
While winning meets such as this week
end's will help the Cardinal move up in the
rankings, it is individual times which will
be most important in determining success
at the end of the season.
Already in the preseason, many of the
Stanford swimmers have recorded nation
al qualifying times, and they hope to add
several more against Pacific and over the
course of the conference season.
In the three meets in December. Bruce
achieved "A" standard times in the 100-
meter breaststroke, 200-meter breast
stroke and 200-meter individual medley,
as well as "B" times in three more events.
Senior Lacey Boutwell and junior
Laura Davis each contributed three "B"
times, while junior Dana Kirk and sopho
more Desiree Stahley had two apiece.
Sophomores Morgan Hentzen and Lauren
Costella and freshmen Elizabeth Durot.

Pacific, but it will be in action in two weeks
against Arizona.
Brooke Bishop and Erica Liu each
posted one.
An "A" time provides an auto
matic qualification to the NCAA
Championship, while "B" times are
submitted for consideration when
determining the championship field.
Alongside the swimmers, the
diving squad has been training hard
since the end of the preseason.
The top pair, senior Ashlee
Rosenthal and sophomore Cassidy
Krug, look to build upon early suc
cesses. Senior Erin Lashnits, fresh
man Katie Lampe. junior Sara Bowl
ing and sophomore Brooke Sullivan
continue to improve and will work to
contribute good scores for the team.
The divers will have an extra
week to train before they begin
competing.
Pacific does not have divers on
its roster, so the Cardinal squad will
see its first action of the new year in
Arizona in two weeks.

Cardinal still sixth in
national rankings


PETER KRUTZIK/The Stanford Daily File
The Stanford women's swim team, having finished first in the preseason
Speedo Cup, will open their home season this weekend with a nonconfer
ence match against the Pacific Tigers.
Alter a month of preseason meets and
another month of training, the No. 6
women's swimming and diving team is
ready to begin its pursuit of the school's
ninth national championship. After disap
pointing fifth- and sixth-place finishes in
the last two seasons, they hope to prove
themselves contenders on the national
scene.
As predicted at the beginning of the
season. Auburn and Georgia are at the top
of the national rankings. Right behind
them are Florida. Texas and Arizona, fol
lowed closely by Stanford and SMIJ.
A loss to Texas with a short-handed
squad is the only blemish on the Cardinal's
preseason record, which featured a com
manding victory over Hawaii and a first
place finish in a field of 20 teams at the
Speedo Cup.
The team considers its early success a
preview of the rest of the season.

"The preseason went really well," se
nior Kirsten Gilbert said. "Lots of people
swam incredibly fast for being so early in
the season I think that foreshadows good
things to come."
Head coach Richard Ouick is equally
positive about the team's progress. Even
after the loss to Texas, Quick had good
things to say about individual perfor
mances and the team's competitiveness.
The newest members of the team espe
cially have made an impression.
"We have freshmen that came in and
are looking way better than we expected,
way better than our coaches expected," se
nior Sarah Jones said. "The feeling as a
team has been one of the best that we've
had. so it's been looking really good. "
With a bit of ground to make up in the
national rankings, Stanford will look to
continue posting victories and NCAA
qualifying times over the course of Pacific
-10 Conference competition.
