# Oregon knocks off feisty Beavers in Corvallis, 73-64
## 
### RAYMOND WICKS THE OSU DAILY BAROMETER (OREGON STATE U 
(LJ-WIRF:) CORVALLIS. Ore. -
The combination of Aaron Brooks
on top of his game and a valiant re
hounding effort hy Oregon proved
to he too much for the Oregon
State men's basketball team.
Late in the first half, before
9,087 fans, OSU dug itself a "Pit"
they would never climb out of at
McArthur Court as the Ducks went
on to win 73-64.
Brooks scored 15 of his game
high 24 points in the second half for
Oregon (10-2, 2-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference).
"Aaron Brooks kept us tiff-bal
ance defensively," said OSU head
coach Jay John. "We played zone
one time and he hit a 24-footer. He
had a really good game, he's a mar
quee player in this league."
OSU (10-4,2-1) looked to be hot
in the early going, with freshman
Sasa Cuic and junior Jason
Fontenet hitting from beyond the
arc.
That shooting soon vanished
when Cuic was forced to the bench
with early foul trouble and
Fontenet drew iron on his next
seven 3-point attempts.
Ultimately, Oregon State's in
ability to crash the boards was the
difference in the game. The
Beavers were out-rebounded 44-
20.
"Oregon did a good job re

bounding," John said. "It led to
more Oregon possessions. Oregon
is one of the bigger lineups in the
league and we have some work to
do, but it's not a main concern."
lan Crosswhite, who had 11
points and led the Ducks with nine
rebounds, said the team spent a lot
of the week working on rebound
ing. John certainly took notice of
UO's efforts.
"I thought, obviously, Oregon
whipped us on the glass," John said.
Because of their work on the
board, Oregon was able to get their
guards out and run the floor —
something the Ducks love to do.
"The offense flowed pretty good
because we got out and ran,"
Brooks said.
Of those 44 rebounds, the Ducks
were able to gather in 18 on the of
fensive end.
That led the Ducks to 17 second
chance-points. where the Beavers
only had four late in the second
half.
With three minutes left in the
first half, Fontenet hit a runner in
the lane to bring OSU within six,
32-26. That would be the closest the
Beavers would come the rest of the
night.
From that point on, Oregon
State went on an eight-minute field
goal drought, and it didn't have an
other bucket until J.S. Nash scored
at the 15:06 mark in the second half.
The game saw seven lead
changes and 11 ties in the first
frame until the Ducks broke it open

with a 10-2 run.
Junior Nick DeWitz had the hot
hand, scoring 10 points in the sec
ond half, trying to get the Beavers
back in the game. At one point, he
scored seven in a row and moments
later cashed in from three point
range.
But UO had Brooks on their
side.
When David Lucas, who led
OSU with 15 points, scored. Brooks
quickly answered.
If DeWitz would drain a 3. so
would Brooks.
"Aaron Brooks would answer
everything," John said.
It didn't help that the Beavers,
other than Lucas and DeWitz, shot
just 31 percent from the floor.
Part of it was Oregon's zone de
fense.
"Oregon played a lot more zone
than we expected," John said. "A
zone is a rhythm thing, you take a
look at how the other team handles
it and since it worked, they kept the
zone on."
Part of it was shot selection.
"Our team has a lot of size, and
we were able to force OSU to take
some bad shots," Oregon coach
Ernie Kent said. "If we can re
bound out of that zone, that could
be a very effective weapon for us."
As a team, OSU shot just 30 per
cent in the first half and ended the
night at 39 percent.
DeWitz and Fontenet each fin
ished with 13 points for Oregon
State.

"Aaron Brooks kept us tiff-bal
ance defensively," said OSU head
coach Jay John. "We played zone
one time and he hit a 24-footer. He
had a really good game, he's a mar
quee player in this league."
OSU (10-4,2-1) looked to be hot
in the early going, with freshman
Sasa Cuic and junior Jason
Fontenet hitting from beyond the
arc.
That shooting soon vanished
when Cuic was forced to the bench
with early foul trouble and
Fontenet drew iron on his next
seven 3-point attempts.
Ultimately, Oregon State's in
ability to crash the boards was the
difference in the game. The
Beavers were out-rebounded 44-
20.
"Oregon did a good job re

bounding," John said. "It led to
more Oregon possessions. Oregon
is one of the bigger lineups in the
league and we have some work to
do, but it's not a main concern."
lan Crosswhite, who had 11
points and led the Ducks with nine
rebounds, said the team spent a lot
of the week working on rebound
ing. John certainly took notice of
UO's efforts.
"I thought, obviously, Oregon
whipped us on the glass," John said.
Because of their work on the
board, Oregon was able to get their
guards out and run the floor —
something the Ducks love to do.
"The offense flowed pretty good
because we got out and ran,"
Brooks said.
Of those 44 rebounds, the Ducks
were able to gather in 18 on the of
fensive end.
That led the Ducks to 17 second
chance-points. where the Beavers
only had four late in the second
half.
With three minutes left in the
first half, Fontenet hit a runner in
the lane to bring OSU within six,
32-26. That would be the closest the
Beavers would come the rest of the
night.
From that point on, Oregon
State went on an eight-minute field
goal drought, and it didn't have an
other bucket until J.S. Nash scored
at the 15:06 mark in the second half.
The game saw seven lead
changes and 11 ties in the first
frame until the Ducks broke it open

with a 10-2 run.
Junior Nick DeWitz had the hot
hand, scoring 10 points in the sec
ond half, trying to get the Beavers
back in the game. At one point, he
scored seven in a row and moments
later cashed in from three point
range.
But UO had Brooks on their
side.
When David Lucas, who led
OSU with 15 points, scored. Brooks
quickly answered.
If DeWitz would drain a 3. so
would Brooks.
"Aaron Brooks would answer
everything," John said.
It didn't help that the Beavers,
other than Lucas and DeWitz, shot
just 31 percent from the floor.
Part of it was Oregon's zone de
fense.
"Oregon played a lot more zone
than we expected," John said. "A
zone is a rhythm thing, you take a
look at how the other team handles
it and since it worked, they kept the
zone on."
Part of it was shot selection.
"Our team has a lot of size, and
we were able to force OSU to take
some bad shots," Oregon coach
Ernie Kent said. "If we can re
bound out of that zone, that could
be a very effective weapon for us."
As a team, OSU shot just 30 per
cent in the first half and ended the
night at 39 percent.
DeWitz and Fontenet each fin
ished with 13 points for Oregon
State.
(LJ-WIRF:) CORVALLIS. Ore. -
The combination of Aaron Brooks
on top of his game and a valiant re
hounding effort hy Oregon proved
to he too much for the Oregon
State men's basketball team.

9,087 fans, OSU dug itself a "Pit"
they would never climb out of at
McArthur Court as the Ducks went
on to win 73-64.

high 24 points in the second half for
Oregon (10-2, 2-1 Pacific-10 Con
