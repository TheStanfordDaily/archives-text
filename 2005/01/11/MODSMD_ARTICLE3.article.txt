# New MLK Papers mark week of campus celebration
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was 20 years ago this month when History Prof.
Clayborne Carson got the phone call that would
change his life and the course of African American
scholarship at Stanford. In 1985, Coretta Scott King
asked Carson, "out of the blue," to lead the Martin
Luther King Jr. Papers Project, editing and publishing
all of Dr. King's significant oral and written work,
much of which had not been previously available to the
public.
Carson, a celebrated scholar of the Civil Rights
Movement, is the senior editor and director of the
King Papers Project, which is sponsored in association
with Stanford, the King estate and the University of
California Press. He will unveil the fifth of the project
ed 14-volume series of the collected King Papers, enti
tled "Threshold of a New Decade, January 1959 - De
cember 1960," at 6 p.m. tonight at the Stanford Book
store.
The fifth volume, which Carson edited with wife
Susan and associates Tenisha Armstrong Adrienne
Clay and Kieran Taylor, presents new and exciting ma
terial for King's followers.
Carson noted as especially important the documen
tation of King's 1959 trip to India and his involvement
in the sit-in protests and presidential election of 1960.
"The India trip was a major milestone in King's life
because he took the step from being just an African-


JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily
American leader to being a leader
on the world stage. You begin to see
him increasingly envisioning the
African-American struggle as part
of a world struggle." Carson said.
In addition, the student protest
ers of February 1460 "upped the
ante for King and challenged him to
be a stronger leader," he said. King
was arrested for his involvement in
the sit-ins, an event that, "according
to many historians, changed the
course of American history." Car
son said.
Democratic presidential candi
date John F. Kennedy's phone call
to the pregnant Coretta Scott King
while her husband was in jail "was
crucial in turning Black support to
wards him in a very tight election. If
that hadn't happened. Nixon proba
bly would have been elected, and
history would read very different
ly." Carson explained.
Tonight's event is the first in se
ries to take place this week to corn

memorate Civil Rights milestones,
including a 40th anniversary pho
tography retrospective of the Selma
March this Thursday at 6 p.m., fol
lowed hy a one-woman show at 7
p.m. hy playwright and actress

anniversary of the Montgomery
Bus Boycott.
Claudette Colvin. the teenager
who preceded Rosa Parks by refus
ing to give up her seat on a Mont
gomery bus six months earlier, will
be at Makeba's performance and
will be available for questions.
All events will take place on the
second floor of Tresidder and are
free and open to the public.
In conjunction with the Project,
Carson is aiming to raise at least $10
million in endowment money for
the Martin Luther King, Jr. Re
search Institute that will "continue
the work we've done, both in terms
of research and in education," Car
son said. Caron expects to build the

Institute within the next few years.
He also expressed hope for the
Institute to sponsor seminars at
Stanford "that will bring together
internationally prominent leaders
to discuss and deal with the world's
problems in the spirit of those like
Dr. King and Gandhi."
Carson will speak about the Re

Since Carson brought the King
Papers Project to Stanford, African
American studies have gained
prominence at the University, but
have never been a leading model of
scholarship for the nation.
Carson said that this could
change with Stanford's recent hir
ing of Harvard's noted African
American studies professors
Lawrence Bobo and Marcyliena
Morgan to the revamped Center for
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity.
"I'm really hoping that these ap
pointments signal a new direction of
giving greater importance to
African American studies at Stan
ford. I think we have great potential
to be very strong in that area, given
the right collective organization and
support," he said.

Since Carson brought the King
Papers Project to Stanford, African
American studies have gained
prominence at the University, but
have never been a leading model of
scholarship for the nation.
Carson said that this could
change with Stanford's recent hir
ing of Harvard's noted African
American studies professors
Lawrence Bobo and Marcyliena
Morgan to the revamped Center for
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity.
"I'm really hoping that these ap
pointments signal a new direction of
giving greater importance to
African American studies at Stan
ford. I think we have great potential
to be very strong in that area, given
the right collective organization and
support," he said.
It was 20 years ago this month when History Prof.
Clayborne Carson got the phone call that would
change his life and the course of African American
scholarship at Stanford. In 1985, Coretta Scott King
asked Carson, "out of the blue," to lead the Martin
Luther King Jr. Papers Project, editing and publishing
all of Dr. King's significant oral and written work,
much of which had not been previously available to the
public.
Carson, a celebrated scholar of the Civil Rights
Movement, is the senior editor and director of the
King Papers Project, which is sponsored in association
with Stanford, the King estate and the University of
California Press. He will unveil the fifth of the project
ed 14-volume series of the collected King Papers, enti
tled "Threshold of a New Decade, January 1959 - De
cember 1960," at 6 p.m. tonight at the Stanford Book
store.
The fifth volume, which Carson edited with wife
Susan and associates Tenisha Armstrong Adrienne
Clay and Kieran Taylor, presents new and exciting ma
terial for King's followers.
Carson noted as especially important the documen
tation of King's 1959 trip to India and his involvement
in the sit-in protests and presidential election of 1960.
"The India trip was a major milestone in King's life
because he took the step from being just an African-


JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily
American leader to being a leader
on the world stage. You begin to see
him increasingly envisioning the
African-American struggle as part
of a world struggle." Carson said.
In addition, the student protest
ers of February 1460 "upped the
ante for King and challenged him to
be a stronger leader," he said. King

the sit-ins, an event that, "according
