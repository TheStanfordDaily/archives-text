# Mefford wins Council case on third try
## 
### NICK PARKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Constitutional
Council ruled unanimously last
night that the Undergraduate Sen
ate acted unconstitutionally when
it refused to certify the results of
the first executive election last
spring.
The Council, which added four
new members in November, also
ruled that although the Senate was
wrong to overturn then-senior
Mikey Lee and then-junior Dylan
Mefford's victory, current ASSU
President Chioke Borgelt-Mose, a
junior, and Vice President Kory
Vargas Caro, a junior, should re
main in office because the special
election that brought them to
power was called in good faith.
Lee and Mefford won the origi
nal election by more than 300
votes, but the Senate chose not to
certify the results, deciding that the
slate's indirect use of the senior and
junior class mailing lists as endorse
ment tools may have unfairly al
tered the outcome of the voting.

This case — the third brought by
Lee or Mefford — argued against
that decision.
Mefford was out of town last
night, reportedly visiting his grand
parents, and unable to attend the
hearing. Senate Chair Chris Lin, a
senior, designated Senator Chris
Nguyen, who disagreed with the
Senate's decision to nullify last
year's elections, to stand in for the
absent appellant.
Nguyen, a sophomore, argued
on Mefford's behalf that the Con
stitution does not mention "abuse
of power" as a cause for not certify
ing an election.
"Nowhere in the Constitution,
nor the Campaign Practice Code, is
there a rule regarding abuse of
power," Nguyen said. "It is not
specifically legislated, so it is illogi
cal to use an abuse of power as a
reason not to certify an election."
Nguyen also argued that the
Constitution allows a non-certifica
tion of an election only through a
recall, and that both the Senate and
the Graduate Student Council
have to agree to nullify the elec

tion.
"Even if an abuse of power did
occur, that alone cannot justify not
certifying an election," Nguyen
said. "The only way to nullify an
election, according to the Constitu
tion, is for there to be a recall."

Senator Dan Stringer, a junior,
was the Senate's representative at
the hearing, and he argued that the
Senate was justified in its decision
not to certify the election because

viant behavior" that unfairly affect
ed the outcome of the election.
"While it does not explicitly state
in the Constitution that abuse of
power is grounds for nullification of
an election, the majority of the Sen
ate and 1 believe that abuse of power
is covered implicitly in the govern
ing documents of the ASSU," he
said.
"The Constitution is flexible, and
it was written to be that way,"
Stringer added.

After hearing Nguyen and
Stringer's arguments, the Council
ruled that the Senate did not have
the right to nullify the results of the
election because there is no mention
of abuse of power in the Constitu
tion.
In the Council's closing state
ments, newly elected Council Chair
Patrick Crosetto, a first-year stu
dent at the Graduate School of Busi
ness, recommended that the Senate
review the Constitution as a whole.

"I would encourage the Senate to
initiate reform and try to get this
done before the spring elections,"
Crosetto said. "The Constitution
with regards to elections procedures
needs an overhaul."
Councilmember Justin Liu, a
sophomore, agreed with Crosetto.
"I think the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate should rewrite the by
laws to clarify exactly what is legal
and what is not in an election cam
paign," he said.
