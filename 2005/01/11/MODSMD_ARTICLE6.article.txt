# Baccalaureate speaker: a Buddhist and a Jew
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Teacher, peace activist and au
thor Sylvia Boorstein will speak at
this year's Baccalaureate Multifaith
ceremony on Saturday, June 11.
Both a practicing Jew and a Bud
dhist teacher who meets with the
Dalai Lama on a regular basis,
Boorstein was chosen to be Bac
calaureate speaker by the Office of
Religious Life.
"Dr. Boorstein mines the best of
several religious traditions in mod
eling communication over conflict

and advocacy over anger." said
Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann.se
nior associate dean for religious life.
"She embodies the religious under
standing that the most enduring ac
tivism is deeply rooted in love of hu
manity."
Boorstein's interests include the
intersection between Eastern and
Western psychology, though she
was trained as a psychotherapist and
continues to write journal articles
and attend conferences.
She teaches at the Spirit Rock
Meditation Center, which she co
founded, in Woodacre, CA, and at

the Insight Meditation Society in
Barre. MA. Boorstein also served as
part of the original faculty of the In
stitute for Jewish Spirituality and
wrote four books, including "That's
Funny; You Don't Look Buddhist:
On Being a Faithful Jew and a Pas
sionate Buddhist."
"Sylvia Boorstein was chosen be
cause she is an impressive exemplar
of interfaith understanding and co
operation," said Rev. Scotty
McLennan, dean for religious life.
"In an era of religious misunder
standing and violence, she has been
an exemplary global citizen and ac

tivist for peace. I think she will de
liver a message to the seniors about
how to live as a global citizen in the
21st century."
According to McLennan, the
Baccalaureate speaker always
comes from a religious background,
because the event is by definition "a
sermon to the graduating class."
In choosing this year's speaker,
the Office of Religious Life received
input from students, members of the
30 Stanford Associated Religions
groups on campus, faculty, staff and
administrators, said McLennan.
"We do that now in a way that is
welcoming to the entire senior class,
whether a student is religious or not,
and no matter what their religious
background, if any, may be," he
said.
Baccalaureate will be followed
on June 12 by Commencement.
This year's Commencement speak
er will be Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple
Computer and Pixar Animation
Studios.
