# Cancelled ski trips could cost thousands
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER 
For many undergraduate residents,
dreams of sleds, skis and snowmen melt
ed away last Thursday, when severe
weather prompted Stanford's Risk Man
agement Department to cancel all ski
trips to the Lake Tahoe area scheduled
for that weekend.
Since most dorms had already secured
buses and cabins, they stand to lose thou
sands of dollars in rental costs.
Insurance and liability were not the
main factors in the decision, said Tina
Dobleman. director of the Risk Manage
ment Department.
"It was really just a safety issue," she
said. "The weather forecast was so seri
ous, so much snow, and they were antici
pating that the roads would be closed."
As of Friday morning, the National
Weather Service was predicting up to 10
feet of snowfall for the weekend, with
wind gusts approaching 100 mph at the
peaks of the Sierra Mountains. Despite
warnings about ice and poor visibility

from the California Highway Patrol, In
terstate 80 — which links Sacramento to
the Lake Tahoe area — was officially
open to traffic for most of the weekend.
Had the highways been closed for
longer, the cost of cabin rental would
most likely be returned. But because the
main highway only remained closed for
13 hours on Friday night, rental agree

ments did not guarantee a full refund.
Toyon had reserved five cabins in
South Lake Tahoe, with total costs ap
proaching $4,000, according to Toyon
resident Will McColl.
"We're still waiting to see if we'll get
refunded, but so far it looks like we're
going to have to bear the cost," said Kent
Casimir, a Toyon Eating Club Manager
and one of the organizers the ski trip.
Haus Mitteleuropa, a Row House,
also suffered a financial loss from the
weekend. House Manager Alex Pocek
said that the entire cost of the cabin was
lost, and that her dorm could not afford to
rent another cabin later in the quarter.
"Even for the houses who are trying to
reschedule, there aren't a lot of places
that have availability at this point," she
added.
Although Pocek said the decision was
"warranted," she expressed frustration
with the Risk Management Department,
and her dorm plans to seek some restitu
tion from the University.
"We're probably going to go through

the regular channels of Res Ed [the Of
fice of Residential Education], but I don't
see a plausible way for us to get reim
bursed," Pocek said.
Josh Schiller, the assistant director of
Res Ed, who is acting as a liaison between
the dorms and Risk Management, said
that not every dorm staff was disappoint
ed when he informed them of the cancel
lations.
"Some students indicated that they
were relieved that the decision had been
made for them, because they were not
comfortable with the weather condi
tions," he said.
In regard to compensation for rental
costs, Schiller said that Res Ed is cooper
ating with Risk Management "to deter
mine the amount of non-refundable
money that can be reimbursed to dorms."
In spite of Risk Management's deci
sion on Thursday, Pocek and others from
the Haus Mitt staff were planning to take
a smaller, private trip to Tahoe, in order


ANASTACIAJUNQUERIRA-DeGARCIA
The Stanford Daily
to get some use out of the rented
cabin, Pocek said. However, even
this private trip was impossible.
Pocek was told by Michelsen's
Vacation Rentals, the company that
rented cabins to dorms including
Haus Mitt, that Stanford was barred
from the house for the weekend.
"1 called Augie [Galvan, Assis
tant Director of Student Manage
ment on the Row] and asked if stu
dents still went up, if
they would be able to use the house.
He said that they could go up, but
they would not be able to stay at the
houses," Pocek said.
Schiller said the rental companies
"were informed that all of the Stan
ford groups would not be traveling
to Tahoe for snow trips that week
end."

All dorms
were barred

Ski trips are slated for most week
ends of winter quarter and with the
prospect of heavy snow through
February, the Risk Management
Department may again have to be
the bearer of bad news.
La Maison Francaise has a trip
scheduled for this weekend.
"We're just going to keep a close
eye on the weather," said senior
Evonne Johnson, a co-organizer of
that trip.
"The number one priority is resi
dent safety so if the weather is bad,
or roads close, there's nothing we
can do," Johnson said.
A total of six Row Houses had to
cancel their snow trips last weekend,
according to Galvan, but Residential
Education could not provide a cam
pus-wide list of the affected dorms.

to get some use out of the rented
cabin, Pocek said. However, even
this private trip was impossible.
Pocek was told by Michelsen's
Vacation Rentals, the company that
rented cabins to dorms including
Haus Mitt, that Stanford was barred
from the house for the weekend.
"1 called Augie [Galvan, Assis
tant Director of Student Manage
ment on the Row] and asked if stu
dents still went up, if
they would be able to use the house.
He said that they could go up, but
they would not be able to stay at the
houses," Pocek said.
Schiller said the rental companies
"were informed that all of the Stan
ford groups would not be traveling
to Tahoe for snow trips that week
end."

All dorms
were barred

Ski trips are slated for most week
ends of winter quarter and with the
prospect of heavy snow through
February, the Risk Management
Department may again have to be
the bearer of bad news.
La Maison Francaise has a trip
scheduled for this weekend.
"We're just going to keep a close
eye on the weather," said senior
Evonne Johnson, a co-organizer of
that trip.
"The number one priority is resi
dent safety so if the weather is bad,
or roads close, there's nothing we
can do," Johnson said.
A total of six Row Houses had to
cancel their snow trips last weekend,
according to Galvan, but Residential
Education could not provide a cam
pus-wide list of the affected dorms.
For many undergraduate residents,
dreams of sleds, skis and snowmen melt
ed away last Thursday, when severe
weather prompted Stanford's Risk Man
agement Department to cancel all ski
trips to the Lake Tahoe area scheduled
for that weekend.
Since most dorms had already secured
buses and cabins, they stand to lose thou
sands of dollars in rental costs.
Insurance and liability were not the
main factors in the decision, said Tina
Dobleman. director of the Risk Manage
ment Department.
"It was really just a safety issue," she
said. "The weather forecast was so seri
ous, so much snow, and they were antici
pating that the roads would be closed."
As of Friday morning, the National
Weather Service was predicting up to 10
feet of snowfall for the weekend, with
wind gusts approaching 100 mph at the
peaks of the Sierra Mountains. Despite
warnings about ice and poor visibility

from the California Highway Patrol, In
terstate 80 — which links Sacramento to
the Lake Tahoe area — was officially
open to traffic for most of the weekend.
Had the highways been closed for
longer, the cost of cabin rental would
most likely be returned. But because the
main highway only remained closed for
13 hours on Friday night, rental agree

ments did not guarantee a full refund.
Toyon had reserved five cabins in
South Lake Tahoe, with total costs ap
proaching $4,000, according to Toyon
resident Will McColl.
"We're still waiting to see if we'll get
refunded, but so far it looks like we're
going to have to bear the cost," said Kent
Casimir, a Toyon Eating Club Manager
and one of the organizers the ski trip.
Haus Mitteleuropa, a Row House,
also suffered a financial loss from the
weekend. House Manager Alex Pocek
said that the entire cost of the cabin was
lost, and that her dorm could not afford to
rent another cabin later in the quarter.
"Even for the houses who are trying to
reschedule, there aren't a lot of places
that have availability at this point," she
added.
Although Pocek said the decision was
"warranted," she expressed frustration
with the Risk Management Department,
and her dorm plans to seek some restitu
tion from the University.
"We're probably going to go through

the regular channels of Res Ed [the Of
fice of Residential Education], but I don't
see a plausible way for us to get reim
bursed," Pocek said.
Josh Schiller, the assistant director of
Res Ed, who is acting as a liaison between
the dorms and Risk Management, said
that not every dorm staff was disappoint
ed when he informed them of the cancel
lations.
"Some students indicated that they
were relieved that the decision had been
made for them, because they were not
comfortable with the weather condi
tions," he said.
In regard to compensation for rental
costs, Schiller said that Res Ed is cooper
ating with Risk Management "to deter
mine the amount of non-refundable
money that can be reimbursed to dorms."
In spite of Risk Management's deci
sion on Thursday, Pocek and others from
the Haus Mitt staff were planning to take
a smaller, private trip to Tahoe, in order
