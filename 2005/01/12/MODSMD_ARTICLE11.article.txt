# On this day in Stanford History...

On Jan. 12, 1959, The Daily ran a
story about a group of local church
women who asked for the closing of
nine liquor stores. Below is an ex
cerpt:
"Nine Palo Alto liquor establish
ments will be out of business in Sep
tember if the Council of United
Church Women has its way.
"The group, composed of repre
sentatives from 23 mid-Peninsula
churches, unanimously passed a res
olution Friday calling for no amend
ments or changes in an existing state
law which prohibits sale of liquor
within I 1/2 miles of the boundary of
any university.
"Stanford boundaries are slated
to move in September when new stu
dent housing units become occu
pied. To protect the nine establish
ments which are within what will be
the new 1 1/2-mile limit, State As
semblyman Clark Bradley and State
Senator Jack Thompson have pro
posed amending the present law.
"Stanford officials have indicated
no objection to the proposal. The
chief point of dispute thus far has
been whether to permanently freeze
the present limit, or to let the limit
move each time Stanford bound
aries move, but let established liquor
dispensaries remain in business.
"The UCW Council, however, is
the first group to proclaim is opposi
tion to even letting the existing es
tablishments remain."

On Jan. 12, The Daily ran a story
about unlisted phone numbers
being published in the directory.
Below is an excerpt:
"Approximately 300 students'
phone numbers were inadvertently
listed in the 1986-87 Stanford Stu
dent Directory despite the stu
dents' requests for privacy, accord
ing to University officials.
"Although the University made
a mistake in printing these phone
numbers, the resulting harm is
probably not enough to constitute a
legal invasion of privacy, as the
error is not 'a revelation of some as
pect of the person's inner being,'
according to Law Prof. Marc
Franklin.
"A combination of human negli
gence and computer error caused
the leak, said Jack Farrell, assistant
registrar.
"A total of 18,800 directories
were printed before the error was
noted, said senior John Fernandes,
who managed the publishing of the
directory. About 17,000 directories
were distributed to students, facul
ty and department offices.
"An additional 400 directories
were to go on sale at the Stanford
Bookstore, but instead were
bought back by the Registrar's Of
fice in an attempt to prevent any
further spread of the mistakenly
published information, Farrell
said."
