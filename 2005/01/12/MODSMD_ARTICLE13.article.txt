# Does this make me look fat?
## It's bad for guys; too 
### 
The other night, a female friend
of mine came home from a
date. Yes, a real date. A Stan
ford guy asked this Stanford
girl out on a date. They went out to din-

ner, ne
opened
doors for
her and
paid the
check.
Don't
worry, this
is not yet
another ar
ticle about
dating, or
the lack
thereof, at
Stanford.
What
shocked me
was not that

it happened (I mean, come on, it's a
date, it's not like the Card heat the
Wildcats), but her response to it.
Alter coming home from a seeming
ly great night, she said, "He's really
cute, funny and smart but I'm not going
to go out with him again. He's just too
nice."
Umm, excuse me, nice is a good
thing. A really good thing. Yet women
still get all riled up over the bad boy.
Okay, not all women, but enough for
movies about it, like "Grease," "Win a
Date with Tad Hamilton." "13 Going
on 30" (wow, I'm really embarrassed to
admit that I've seen "13 Going on 30")
and"The Breakfast Club" to be totally
cliche.
Another embarrassing admission is
that I'm one of those girls. I fight the
impulse, yet I, the liberal, usually anti
military pacifist, find Navy SEALs to
be the epitome of sexy'. There shouldn't
be anything hot about a guy knowing
how to kill a man 18 ways with his
pinkie, and yet there is.
Why? Because it's masculine. Men
are supposed to be powerful. They are
supposed to fight and dominate. They
are supposed to protect us, the fairer,
weaker sex. Perhaps these are all rem
nants from the days cavemen slugged it
out with wooden billy clubs then
dragged their conquests back to the
cave. 1 don't know. What matters is that
it is seen as unmasculine fora guy to be
nice, communicative, sensitive and gen
tle.
But those are all good traits. We
should be nurturing them in our
prospective mates, not refusing to go
out on second dates because of them.
This is where guys have it worse.
The sanctions imposed on men when
they break gender norms are harsher
than those imposed on women.
For example, when a little girl likes
to play sports, wrestle with the boys,
collect insects and hates pretty dresses,
she's a tomboy. She can still be popular,
well-liked and well-adjusted.
But when a little boy would prefer
playing with Barbies to playing kick
ball, he is likely to be ostracized. If he
hasn't learned to conform by high
school, he's lucky if he doesn't get the
crap beaten out of him.
When a girl wants to experiment
with her sexuality, she gets applauded.
Guys are the first to congratulate her.
Anil ask for pictures.
When a guy wants to experiment
with his sexuality, he'd better be careful
or, who knows, he might end up beaten
to death and left tied to a fence post.
No one blinks when a woman wears
pants, but everyone stares when a man
wears a skirt.
From my experience, men are a lot
more willing to date a strong, opinion
ated. powerful girl than women are to
date a soft-spoken, sensitive, emotion
ally accessible guy.
None of this is meant to suggest that
women don't face sanctions for break
ing gender roles. I think my past
columns have made it clear that I hard
ly think women have it easy. But nor do
men.
It used to be that only women felt
pressured to achieve bodies unachiev
able without the aid of starvation and
silicon. Now average men feel inade
quate because they can't rival the Hulk
in bicep measurement. And at least we
are allowed to cry about it.
The gap is closing. Gender roles are
increasingly becoming an equal oppor
tunity discriminator. And it hurts ev
eryone.

But those are all good traits. We
should be nurturing them in our

This is where guys have it worse.
The sanctions imposed on men when
they break gender norms are harsher
than those imposed on women.
For example, when a little girl likes
to play sports, wrestle with the boys,
collect insects and hates pretty dresses,
she's a tomboy. She can still be popular,
well-liked and well-adjusted.
But when a little boy would prefer
playing with Barbies to playing kick
ball, he is likely to be ostracized. If he
hasn't learned to conform by high
school, he's lucky if he doesn't get the
crap beaten out of him.
When a girl wants to experiment
with her sexuality, she gets applauded.
Guys are the first to congratulate her.

When a guy wants to experiment
with his sexuality, he'd better be careful
or, who knows, he might end up beaten
to death and left tied to a fence post.
No one blinks when a woman wears
pants, but everyone stares when a man
wears a skirt.
From my experience, men are a lot
more willing to date a strong, opinion
ated. powerful girl than women are to
date a soft-spoken, sensitive, emotion
ally accessible guy.
None of this is meant to suggest that
women don't face sanctions for break
ing gender roles. I think my past
columns have made it clear that I hard
ly think women have it easy. But nor do
men.
It used to be that only women felt
pressured to achieve bodies unachiev
able without the aid of starvation and
silicon. Now average men feel inade
quate because they can't rival the Hulk
in bicep measurement. And at least we
are allowed to cry about it.
The gap is closing. Gender roles are
increasingly becoming an equal oppor
tunity discriminator. And it hurts ev
eryone.

The other night, a female friend
of mine came home from a
date. Yes, a real date. A Stan
ford guy asked this Stanford
girl out on a date. They went out to din-

ner, ne
opened
doors for
her and
paid the
check.
Don't
worry, this
is not yet
another ar
ticle about
dating, or
the lack
thereof, at
Stanford.
What
shocked me
was not that

it happened (I mean, come on, it's a
date, it's not like the Card heat the
Wildcats), but her response to it.
Alter coming home from a seeming
ly great night, she said, "He's really
cute, funny and smart but I'm not going
to go out with him again. He's just too
nice."
Umm, excuse me, nice is a good
thing. A really good thing. Yet women
still get all riled up over the bad boy.
Okay, not all women, but enough for
movies about it, like "Grease," "Win a
Date with Tad Hamilton." "13 Going
on 30" (wow, I'm really embarrassed to
admit that I've seen "13 Going on 30")
and"The Breakfast Club" to be totally
cliche.
Another embarrassing admission is
that I'm one of those girls. I fight the
impulse, yet I, the liberal, usually anti
military pacifist, find Navy SEALs to
be the epitome of sexy'. There shouldn't
be anything hot about a guy knowing
how to kill a man 18 ways with his
pinkie, and yet there is.
Why? Because it's masculine. Men
are supposed to be powerful. They are
supposed to fight and dominate. They
are supposed to protect us, the fairer,
weaker sex. Perhaps these are all rem
nants from the days cavemen slugged it
out with wooden billy clubs then
dragged their conquests back to the
cave. 1 don't know. What matters is that
it is seen as unmasculine fora guy to be
nice, communicative, sensitive and gen
