# This class isn't afraid to ask the big question... Will it be Merlot or Cab?

### PAMELA SUD 
Just a few days ago, hundreds of
Stanford students waited for mid
night to strike with restless anticipa
tion. They were not waiting to un
cork the champagne and kiss their
significant others: they were eager,
rather, to learn about champagne,
with or without significant others.
The one-unit activity. Wine Tast
ing, which opened for registration at
11:59 pm last Wednesday, drew 450
applicants this quarter, all vying for
65 spots.
The odds were not in students'
favor.
"I had no idea that 450 people
were going to sign up. I thought I

was in pretty good
shape. Whoops!"
said senior Ken
Jung, who was shut
out of the class. "The
web server crashed
at about 12:01 am, so
I spent the better
part of an hour
monotonously hit
ting 'reload' and

hoping that 1 could get a signup in."
A select few fared better.
"I knew that when I turned 21 that
this was a class I wanted to take,"
said Kyle Bruck, a senior who is
eager to start his second quarter of
Wine Tasting this Thursday. "It has
been one of my favorite classes at
Stanford. It only gets around by
word of mouth."
Although Stanford is hardly
known for its outspoken wine en
thusiasts, the class has caused a sig
nificant stir among those interested
in wine and wine culture.
"My family has always been into
wine, so I was introduced at a pretty
young age," lung said. "For my 21st
birthday I went to Sonoma and went
wine tasting with my family. 1 was
hoping that I could take this class
just to develop my wine knowledge
more."
Instructor Sunaina Sinha, class of
2003, who founded the course as a
French House theme associate in
2001, is surprised at the success of
her own class.
"I'll never forget the first class,"
she said. "I was so nervous that no
one would show up! I arranged fora
speaker from Napa and I called ev
eryone I knew and begged them to
come. To my surprise, 55 came."
This is the ninth quarter that
Wine Tasting will be offered at Stan
ford.
The class meets every Thursday
night from 7 to 8 in the French

House lounge. Each week there is a
different speaker from the wine in
dustry, ranging from winery owners
and glass manufacturers to Sinha
herself.
"It's a great opportunity for the
speakers, because they get to speak
to a young and impressionable audi
ence, and they introduce wines that
are in the price range of students,"
Sinha said.
Each class, the students are of
fered five or six different types of
wine to taste. At the beginning of
the quarter each student is required
to pay a fee of $85 that covers the
cost of the wine in addition to a
weekend-long field trip to Napa
Valley.

"The great thing
about the class is that
it's very low-key,"
Bruck noted.
"There's no pre
sumption about it.
You bring your own
glass, they serve the
wine, and at the first
class they show you
how to smell it, taste

it and appreciate it."
Sinha herself comes from a rich
background of wine culture. Born
and raised in South Africa, she was
exposed to an area that is one of the
major wine producers of the world.
She even devotes one class to South
African wines, which are well
known throughout Europe but prac
tically unheard of in California.
"I want to make the wine world
more accessible to students," said
Sinha. who has received immense
positive feedback from her former
pupils. "Wine tasting and wine
knowledge is a valuable social skill.
It's a big part of human culture and
human society."
Beyond introductory information
on the wine industry itself, there was
also one session during fall quarter
that focused on champagnes and an
other on matching wine and
cheeses.
"If someone really wants to learn
something, (Sunaina] will make it
happen," Bruck said.
There is no other class out there at
Stanford that even remotely has to do
with wine tasting, according to Sinha.
Preference is given to French House
residents, and in the spring quarter
preference is also given to seniors.
Graduate students, who ordinarily
comprise about 15 percent of the
class, are welcome as well. The class
fills up on a first-come, first-served
basis. This quarter, the class was filled
after two-and-a-half minutes.

House lounge. Each week there is a
different speaker from the wine in
dustry, ranging from winery owners
and glass manufacturers to Sinha
herself.
"It's a great opportunity for the
speakers, because they get to speak
to a young and impressionable audi
ence, and they introduce wines that
are in the price range of students,"
Sinha said.
Each class, the students are of
fered five or six different types of
wine to taste. At the beginning of
the quarter each student is required
to pay a fee of $85 that covers the
cost of the wine in addition to a
weekend-long field trip to Napa
Valley.

"The great thing
about the class is that
it's very low-key,"
Bruck noted.
"There's no pre
sumption about it.
You bring your own
glass, they serve the
wine, and at the first
class they show you
how to smell it, taste

it and appreciate it."
Sinha herself comes from a rich
background of wine culture. Born
and raised in South Africa, she was
exposed to an area that is one of the
major wine producers of the world.
She even devotes one class to South
African wines, which are well
known throughout Europe but prac
tically unheard of in California.
"I want to make the wine world
more accessible to students," said
Sinha. who has received immense
positive feedback from her former
pupils. "Wine tasting and wine
knowledge is a valuable social skill.
It's a big part of human culture and
human society."
Beyond introductory information
on the wine industry itself, there was
also one session during fall quarter
that focused on champagnes and an
other on matching wine and
cheeses.
"If someone really wants to learn
something, (Sunaina] will make it
happen," Bruck said.
There is no other class out there at
Stanford that even remotely has to do
with wine tasting, according to Sinha.
Preference is given to French House
residents, and in the spring quarter
preference is also given to seniors.
Graduate students, who ordinarily
comprise about 15 percent of the
class, are welcome as well. The class
fills up on a first-come, first-served
basis. This quarter, the class was filled
after two-and-a-half minutes.

Students in the popular wine tasting class are learning to savor a good 2005 Charles Shaw Merlot.
Just a few days ago, hundreds of
Stanford students waited for mid
night to strike with restless anticipa
tion. They were not waiting to un
cork the champagne and kiss their
significant others: they were eager,
rather, to learn about champagne,
with or without significant others.
The one-unit activity. Wine Tast
ing, which opened for registration at
11:59 pm last Wednesday, drew 450
applicants this quarter, all vying for
65 spots.
The odds were not in students'
favor.
"I had no idea that 450 people
were going to sign up. I thought I

was in pretty good
shape. Whoops!"
said senior Ken
Jung, who was shut
out of the class. "The
web server crashed
at about 12:01 am, so
I spent the better
part of an hour
monotonously hit
ting 'reload' and

hoping that 1 could get a signup in."
A select few fared better.
"I knew that when I turned 21 that
this was a class I wanted to take,"
said Kyle Bruck, a senior who is
eager to start his second quarter of
Wine Tasting this Thursday. "It has
been one of my favorite classes at
Stanford. It only gets around by
word of mouth."
Although Stanford is hardly
known for its outspoken wine en
thusiasts, the class has caused a sig
nificant stir among those interested
in wine and wine culture.
"My family has always been into
wine, so I was introduced at a pretty
young age," lung said. "For my 21st
birthday I went to Sonoma and went
wine tasting with my family. 1 was
hoping that I could take this class
just to develop my wine knowledge
more."
Instructor Sunaina Sinha, class of
2003, who founded the course as a
French House theme associate in
2001, is surprised at the success of
her own class.
"I'll never forget the first class,"
she said. "I was so nervous that no
one would show up! I arranged fora
speaker from Napa and I called ev
eryone I knew and begged them to
come. To my surprise, 55 came."
This is the ninth quarter that
Wine Tasting will be offered at Stan
ford.
The class meets every Thursday
night from 7 to 8 in the French
