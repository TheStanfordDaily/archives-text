# 'Family Guy' creator dishes to crowd at OSU on new season, new series and movie
## 
### EVAN BROOKS THE LANTERN (OHIO STATE U 
Nearly 1,000 students sat captivated by
everything Seth McFarlene, creator of the
TV show "Family Guy," said during his
visit to Ohio State University Sunday night.
Throughout his lecture, those in atten
dance were privy to information regarding
the next season of "Family Guy" and its
lovable Griffin family in the city of Quahog.
After giving a short biography of him
self, McFarlene played a rough cut of an
episode for the upcoming "Family Guy"
season titled "North by North Quahog."
The episode displayed highlights that
are reminiscent of "Family Guy" humor.
Some gags to look for in this fourth season
episode are a spoof on "The Passion of the
Christ;" the Beyond section of Bed. Bath
and Beyond: Louis's love affair with Ker
mit the Frog; and Brian — the family's talk
ing dog — changing Stewie's dirty diaper.
"Does it smell like servitude?" Stewie
asks.
Other news McFarlene shared included
details on the highly anticipated "Family
Guy" movie, which will follow Stewie on
his quest to find his real father. The movie
is still in development and should not be ex
pected any time soon.
"We haven't had time to do anything
substantial yet," McFarlene said.
The animator from Connecticut also re
vealed news about the return of the Evil

Monkey that lives in Chris
Griffin's closet.

"We get very
u~ «u ♦ u

bizarre with the
Evil Monkey,"

he said. "Oh
yes, there's

lots more of
the Evil

Monkey."
Appar
ently the

Evil Mon
key will he
i u:

holding a
Hawaiian party

in Chris Griffin's

closet that will prevent

Chris from getting much
sleep. But there will still be
plenty of accusatory finger
pointings, McFarlene said.

Besides giving a glimpse
of upcoming show details,
McFarlene clarified many
existing facts.

One attendee asked
if Stewie was gay, or
does he just have some
birt/l "U n»;nrco Prolific

kind ot Keverse r reuuian
Oedipus Syndrome?" The

question was greeted by
laughter from the audience.
"We don't know if Stewie's gay," Mc-
Farlene said.

The creator also con
fessed his love for show

tunes, which helps
explain his use of
them in the show.

"I love a big,
giant orchestra
playing a bouncy
song," he said.

Perhaps one the
most pivotal answers

came when OSU's guest

was asked if the family
can under
- 4 - J

stand
Stewie,

the

youngest
child of the

family.
"Every writer in the [stu
dio] room has a different
take on that," McFar-

lene said after some
thought. "From
episode to episode
rnolli; ic r>r* r»/-**-»

there s really is no con
sistency."

The answer: No
one really knows. It's up to the individual.
On a slightly more serious side of the
questioning, McFarlene was asked about

the struggles he has with the Federal Com
munications Commission. He explained
that after the Janet Jackson incident during
last years Super Bowl half-time, dealing
with FCC has been difficult. He also said
one episode coming in the fourth season
will feature Peter's attempt to take on the
FCC.
In this episode, Peter will create a show
called "I Dare You to Crap Off That." The
show will have Peter taking dares from
callers who dare him to crap off different
places.
The audience prodded for more infor
mation on McFarlene's new show, "Amer
ican Dad," which is set to debut after this
year's Super Bowl. He said the show will
last for six weeks and will feature a right
wing conservative CIA agent at home with
his family and all the resulting gags therein.
"It's an exaggeration of the most dis
turbing of what's going on right now (polit
ically]," McFarlene said. He also said the
new show will be like a modern-day "All in
the Family."
Some audience members were interest
ed in the money that the show's creator was
making and if he needed any ideas for his
show.
McFarlene and his team of writers seem
to have a pool of comic genius, but the ani
mator assured the audience that if they had
any ideas they are welcome.
"Leave them in a suitcase outside the
mall," he said. "I'll pick them up."
