## Editorial Council gets it right, 8 months late 
### 
The ASSU Constitutional Council's decision
to rule in favor of senior Dylan Mefford's suit
earlier this week comes eight months too late
to have any real consequences, but the Coun
cil made the right decision based on principle and not
personal bias. Now that the constitutional issues sur
rounding this suit have been resolved. ASSU officials
should work to remedy existing shortcomings in its
elections protocol.
Although the decision was largely symbolic and
will leave current ASSU President Chioke Borgelt-
Mose and Vice-President Kory Vargas Caro in their
posts, it establishes a positive precedent for appropri
ate future ASSU Senate action and illustrates the
pressing need fora revision of the ASSU elections
guidelines.
Last year, the outgoing ASSU Undergraduate
Senate should not have rejected the results of the
original election, and held a special election after the
results from the original election were announced.
The grounds cited for rejecting the first election — vi
olation of an ambiguous Campaign Practice Code
section that is arguably unconstitutional — were not
enough to justify rejecting the victory of the Lee /
Mefford slate.
The Constitutional Council agreed with our posi
tion and declared the outgoing Senate's justification
for rejection unconstitutional. However, the incom
ing ASSU Undergraduate Senate proceeded to reject
the results based on the claim of "abuse of power," a
phrase which is not even mentioned in the ASSU
Constitution. Additionally, it is unclear how Lee or
Mefford's actions property constituted such an abuse.
Lee filed a second case contesting this decision,
but the suit was thrown out by the Council on techni
cal grounds.
Then, after the special elections were held and the
Chioke / Korv slate won, Mefford filed a third suit

with the Constitutional Council.
When the suit could not he heard until this school
year, it became clear Mefford's intention was to bring
about change within student government rather than
to reinstate himself as the rightful ASSU vice presi
dent-elect.
Mefford, although regrettably not present at his
own hearing, achieved the goal of bringing about se
rious change within the student government — that
is, if ASSU officials are willing to.
As it currently stands, the Campaign Practice
Code is arguably unconstitutional. And in general,
candidate behavior guidelines remain unclear. The
result of this suit should stimulate debate in the ASSU
Senate about their practices and the principles by
which they operate elections.
The ASSU should not allow personal biases to get
in the way of principle and politics. As loathe as the
ASSU Senate seemed to certify the Lee / Mefford
slate last year, they should not have allowed personal
biases or regret about the election out come to get in
the way of fairness and principle. Hopefully, this
year's senators and those in years to come will come
away from the election debacle saga with a clearer
and more principled view of how the ASSU Senate
should operate.
And more importantly, hopefully the suit decision
will serve as a starting point for serious reconsidera
tion of how ASSU elections take place. The Senate
needs to reconsider the CPE and to ensure it com
plies with constitutional provisions.
Moreover, the Senate must work to ensure that
candidates are fully informed of the manner in which
they are expected to conduct themselves during cam
paigns. Only then will the organization be able to
move forward from last spring's electoral debacle and
allow students to regain trust in student government.
