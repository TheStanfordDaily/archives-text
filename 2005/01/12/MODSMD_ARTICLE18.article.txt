## PWR 2 is developing with time 
### ANDREA LUNSFORD MARVIN DIOGENES 
We're writing in response to
Monday's editorial "I'WR 2 course
load must he balanced." We concur
with the editorial's point about the
importance of assigning an equi
table amount of work across all sec
tions of the course.
Indeed, as we've worked to devel
op PWR 2 over the last two years,
we've devoted much time and energy
in regularly scheduled program meet
ings and in a weeklong Summer Insti
tute last September to creating an as
signment sequence for all instructors
to draw from in crafting their courses.
Such a sequence is one way in which
we have tried to distribute work even
ly across all sections.
In addition, we have asked stu
dents in PWR 2 this year to answer
some key questions for us, in addi
tion to the regular course evalua
tion. We are currently analyzing
those student responses and will use
this analysis to bring greater coher
ence to PWR 2 courses.

While instructors must have
some latitude in designing assign
ments to fit the guidelines, it is in
correct to state that "teachers are
not required to follow these guide
lines." Most PWR instructors fol
low the guidelines closely, and we
work closely with any instructors
who wish to modify the guidelines.
Of course, implementing any new
course with goals as complex as those
of PWR 2 demands a period of exper
imentation, of testing different combi
nations of activities and assignments.
PWR 2 is no exception, and our goal is
to use this year of experimentation to
refine and perfect this course.
Perhaps what is most exciting
about PWR 2 is the variety of ways
the different sections provide stu
dents rich experiences with re
search. writing, and presentation
across a range of media. While PWR
1 grounds students in traditional
standards of print-based argument,
the PWR 2 curriculum provides op
portunities to work in a wider arena,
reflecting how writing and research
have been influenced and even re-

defined by media.
As we continue to implement
and improve PWR 2. we will be pay
ing close attention to the issues
raised by The Daily editorial. In
fact, most of the suggestions offered
are already largely in place in the
program. For instance, PWR in
structors routinely estimate how
much time assignments will take as
part of their course planning, and we
strongly encourage a mid-term eval
uation in every section. And as al
ways, the PWR door is open: We in
vite any students with questions or
concerns about the course to write
to PWR's Undergraduate Advisory
Board at pwradvisoryboard
@lists.stanford.edu or come by the
PWR office to meet with us.
