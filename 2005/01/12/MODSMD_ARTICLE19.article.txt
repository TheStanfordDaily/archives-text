# The
						Good Life
## Prudes, Puritans and porn virgins 
### JULIE PARK 
It's an unavoidable fact of college
life: Guys stash porn away on their
computer in secret files, and girls
stuff chocolate under their beds in
opaque Rubbermaid bins.
And "porn," said a friend, smil
ing ever so sweetly, "is like choco
late."
I disagree. I happen to like
chocolate.
Perhaps I am not the fairest judge.
For 20 years. I was a porn virgin.
Sometimes. I think I'm alone in the
way I've blocked out huge slices of the
pop-cultural pie from my conscious
ness. Other people think so, too.
Have you heard of "Smoke"? It's
an excellent game where you have to
guess what icon someone is thinking
of, but they can only describe the
icon in metaphors. So if the icon
were Mr. Rogers, and the question
were, "What kind of cookie would
he be if he were a cookie," you could

say he'd he chocolate chip. If he were
a drink, he might be milk. If Sean
Combs were clothing, an animal and
a holiday, he could be a panther in a
suit on New Year's Eve.
One time, when I was working at
nerd camp (a.k.a. (TY) and my
class was playing that game, some
one asked. Is it Jenna Jameson?"
and I said, "Who's that?"
Luckily, one of my adorable little
16-year-old students exclaimed, "If
you don't know who Jenna Jameson
is. you must live under a rock."
Okay, just because I don't know
the name of a porn star doesn't
mean I'm a soiled bug. Secondly,
Howard Stern and his like are bor
ing. Third, the rules of the game stip
ulate that you're supposed to choose
an icon, meaning someone whose
name appears in public, not in
downloaded Internet files and
teenage boys' closets.
Nevertheless, that kid's com
ment sent me straight back to senior

year of high school, when I took a
purity test during government class
(we had a teacher, somewhere) and
I scored higher than my devout fun
damentalist Christian missions
trips-groupie friend. "Do you live in
a cave?" asked a classmate. Kids are
nice, huh?
Whether it's under a rock or in a
cave, I no longer live there. Not ex
actly. No one really does once
they're in college and have been sex
iled or have heard stories of people
accidentally walking in on these, er,
inconveniences. Traces of general
sexual naivete remain throughout
campus mainly in the form of
prudes, Puritans and porn virgins.
You could recommend hooks by a
"Jenna Jameson" to them and they
wouldn't suspect a thing.
You may not know who they are.
But they do exist. It's not like
they're the ones with ribbons in
