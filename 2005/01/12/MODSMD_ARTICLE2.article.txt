# Fundraising goal: 100k for tsunami relief
## 
### BONNIE SWIFT 
Stanford Student Relief, a coalition of more than 20
student groups on campus, is rallying to raise $100,000
over the next month to send to countries affected by the
recent tsunamis in South Asia. Because time is such a crit
ical factor in the relief effort, members of the group have
been working around the clock to organize quickly.
The money raised by the group, also known as SSR,
will be sent to Save the Children, a leading nonprofit hu
manitarian relief and development organization.
SSR will use the next month to quickly raise funds for
immediate relief to areas affected by the disaster. After a
month the member groups will establish a new coalition
that will work toward long-term reconstruction efforts.
The specific plans for the fundraising effort are still
being worked out. but the group says it will be putting up
a Web site later this week.
In addition to building the Web site, the creation of the
relief group has involved establishing and filling leader
ship positions, coordinating fundraising events and creat
ing an accountable system of financing.
SSR is cooperating with many Stanford institutions.

The Stanford Track and Field team prepares fora practice yesterday on the wet track following a heavy rain.
including the Haas Center for Public
Service, the ASSU, the Alumni As
sociation and the Office of Student
Activities. Faith ka/.mi, assistant di
rector of student activities, is work
ing with SSR in setting up a trans
parent system of collecting funds.
"We are dedicated to assisting the
students in the success of their mis
sion to raise funds," she said. "While
making sure that it is kept as a stu
dent-initiated and student-led effort,
the OSA will provide as much inside
support as possible in order to help
further their cause."
SSR plans to raise funds through
a broad range of activities, including
tabling in White Plaza and soliciting
in residence halls. Other special
events and a Web site for online do
nations are also still in the planning
phases. SSR aims to capitalize on
each of its member group's strengths
and abilities while avoiding overlap.
Gabriel Brat, a first year medical
student and SSR co-chair, said that
the group wanted its efforts to support
a non-religious, nonpartisan, com
pletely independent organization.
"Save the Children aims to work

fair today

in the long term with children and
their families," Brat said, "The idea
gives strength, and touches all of us."
Save the Children is currently dis
tributing convoys of food, medical
supplies and basic amenities to areas
across Asia devastated by the tsuna
mi.
In the chaotic aftermath of the
tsunamis, there is an especially great
need to protect children, who are
vulnerable to trafficking and other
forms of exploitation. With this in
mind. Save the Children has sent
trained child protection officers to
the region to identify and aid unac
companied children.
"Helping children is helping a
whole generation of people," said
Srihari Yamanoor, a co-chair of SSR.
Members of SSR will have a
table at the Public Service Fair
today in White Plaza from 11 a.m. -
2 p.m. The group, formerly known
as Student United Relief Effort,
formed last week. It changed its
name because the old name, short
ened to SURE, was too similar to 5-
Sl IRE.
