# Fundraising goal: 100k for tsunami relief
## 
### BONNIE SWIFT 
Stanford Student Relief, a coalition of more than 20
student groups on campus, is rallying to raise $100,000
over the next month to send to countries affected by the
recent tsunamis in South Asia. Because time is such a crit
ical factor in the relief effort, members of the group have
been working around the clock to organize quickly.
The money raised by the group, also known as SSR,
will be sent to Save the Children, a leading nonprofit hu
manitarian relief and development organization.
SSR will use the next month to quickly raise funds for
immediate relief to areas affected by the disaster. After a
month the member groups will establish a new coalition
that will work toward long-term reconstruction efforts.
The specific plans for the fundraising effort are still
being worked out. but the group says it will be putting up
a Web site later this week.
In addition to building the Web site, the creation of the
relief group has involved establishing and filling leader
ship positions, coordinating fundraising events and creat
ing an accountable system of financing.
SSR is cooperating with many Stanford institutions.
