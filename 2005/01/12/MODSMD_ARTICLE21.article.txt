## CBS more accountable than U.S. government 
### 
On Monday, CBS News
fired four senior officials
in the wake of an indepen
dent report related to the
airing of a "60 Minutes" piece in
September about President George
W. Bush's Vietnam-era National
Ciuard service. This is a good, neces
sary and appropriate step in ensur
ing that the news the public receives
from unbiased news sources is just
that — fair and unbiased.
The sad part is that this adminis
tration cannot seem to take similar
steps to root out the causes of misin-

formation and
immorality.
In September,
CBS got a tip that
Bush had gotten
into the National
Guard only be
cause of preferen
tial treatment. To
start with, this was
not a new claim.
In his father's
1988 campaign.

Junior, then a consultant to the cam
paign, publicly defended his father's
running mate, Dan Quayle, from ac
cusations that he had received pref
erential treatment in joining the Na
tional Guard during Vietnam.
This brought media attention to
Junior's record and accusations that
he too had gained admittance to the
guard using undue family influence.
While there are probably only a
handful of people who definitively
know how the president came to
protect the Texas coast during Viet
nam — for the record, there was no
known attack on Texas by the Viet
namese during the 19705, or ever for
that matter — a look at the circum
stances surrounding junior's enlist
ment in the National Guard leaves
little doubt that somewhere, by
someone, strings were pulled.
Fact: The nationwide waiting list
for enlistment in the various Nation
al Guard units at the time was
1(X),(XX) people. Fact: There were
waiting lists for the Texas National
Guard. Fact: At the time Junior ap
plied for enlistment, his eventual
unit had its full complement of pi
lots, 27 on active duty and two in
training.
So the ambiguity surrounding ju
nior's entrance into the Texas Na
tional Guard is nothing new, and it is
true that CBS rushed the story to the
air, did not check its facts and did a
poor job of proving what I just did in

three paragraphs.
Fine.
To loosely paraphrase the Bible,
the Bush administration ought to
judge the acts that it has perpetrated
and overseen before judging the acts
of others.
Abu Ghraib:
Who got fired for this? A few
low- level privates and specialists are
currently on trial for torturing Iraqi
prisoners, but you mean to tell me
that's all?
Congress months ago, in closed
sessions, saw pictures and video
tapes of prisoners being tortured,
raped and in some instances killed
by the Army of the t United States of
America.
This is incomprehensible. Aren't
we fighting this war on terror so that
we can live in a world free from
senseless violence against defense
less individuals?
Weapons of mass destruction.
True, George Tenet did lose his
job for this one, but many months
after the fact. Not once has the Bush
administration admitted that it
based its claims to the American
people on documents it could not
authenticate. In reality, the parallels
to the CBS debacle resound.
Yellow cake from Africa? "We
know where the weapons are," Don
ald Rumsfeld assured us on Meet the
Press. "They're in the area around
Tikrit and Baghdad." Dick Cheney
went so far as to claim that Iraq had
restarted its nuclear program.
It's almost two years later and,
well, you know the story. No
weapons. No nuclear centrifuges.
No resignations.
But hey, Iraq's a big place, and
I'm sure they're still there some
where.
The Bush administration rushed
to the airways with their unauthenti
cated story as fast as CBS did. As a
result, more than a thousand Amer
icans have lost their lives.
What happened in the wake of
the CBS story? Well, Bush won re
election and four people lost their
jobs. You decide which is the larger
travesty.

Information concerning junior's ser
vice in the Texas National Guard was
gleaned from J.II. Hatfield's biogra
phy "Fortunate Son." For more infor
