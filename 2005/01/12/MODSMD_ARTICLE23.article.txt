Senate's choice in Council hearing
shows it hasn't learned its lesson
I find it very ironic that the Sen
ate would choose Dan Stringer to
argue the case against Mefford in
last night's ASSU Constitutional
Council hearing.
Wasn't Stringer the same person
who approved the BSU's illegal
funding of the Husbands / Schwartz
campaign last spring?
Didn't The Daily call Stringer
out on his hypocrisy on the allega
tions he and the Senate were using
when referring to "abuse of
power?"

Didn't The Daily call for him to
step down from his post as the Sen
ate's chair of monetary appropria
tions because of his illegal involve
ment?
If so, the fact that he even men
tions in yesterday's article- that Lee
and Mefford were "engaging in de
viant behavior" and arguing about
"abuse of power" again shows that
the Senate hasn't learned its lessons
and still has much more to do in the
way of fixing itself before this
spring's elections.
