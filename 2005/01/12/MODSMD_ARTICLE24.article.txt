## Rough weather, disqualifications keep Stanford sailors from Rose Bowl repeat 
### STEPHEN DORSEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Cardinal tailed to defend their two
year Rose Bowl title in this past weekend's
regatta. By the end of Saturday, the sailing
team had not only experienced heavy rain
and 10-16 mph winds, hut also a disap
pointing disqualification.
Despite the setbacks, Stanford recov
ered and finished third out of 24 teams in
the Southern California hosted Rose Bowl.
The team encountered issues from the
beginning of the first race when another
school protested a maneuver by Stanford's
Division B dinghy, made up of sophomores
Emery Wager and Becca Levin.
"While the race was going on, we knew
that there would be a good chance that we
would be protested," Levin said. "But we
tried to put it behind us and were able to
still finish fourth in that race."
The Cardinal's duo of Wager and Levin

was inching toward winning its division by
the end of Saturday, before it discovered
that a committee decided to disqualify it
from the initial race.
"When 1 heard of the news, it was a set
back for us and I was frustrated." Levin
said.
Miserable weather and an uncommon
disqualification put Stanford behind most
other teams, but head coach Jay Kehoe
motivated his team as it headed into the
second day of competition.
"Although I wished that we had started
hotter, 1 needed to boost their confidence
and [emphasize] the good things that we
had done thus far," Kehoe said.
With a fifth-place after the first day of
competition, Stanford charged back into
the second half of the regatta and failed to
win first, settling fora third-place finish.
"The team really showed up on Sunday,
and by the end of the weekend, the team
had sailed extreinelv well and flawlessly."

Kehoe said.
USC and IJC-Irvine finished first and
second, respectively, while top-ranked
Brown University placed 10th at the Rose
Bowl.
The Providence, R.I. school, along with
most of the other eastern schools, did not
have its strongest sailors at the event.
Stanford also sent seniors Peter Deming
and Lucy Horton, who sailed in Division A,
to the regatta.
Evan Brown replaced Horton in a few of
the races over the weekend.
The Cardinal, however, were still
pleased with their performance.
"This was the last official regatta of the
fall season, and despite not winning the
Rose Bowl title, we sailed consistently well
and look forward to the spring season," 1
Levin said.
The Cardinal will take a break for the
remainder of January and will return to the
waters in early February.
