# Season-best times fuel men
## 
### SAMUEL CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Six years; six head-to-head dual meets;
six Stanford victories.
These three numbers summarize the
dominance the Cardinal men's swim team
has experienced in what has become a
perennial mid-season match-up between
current No. 5 Stanford (2-0) and Pacific
(1-3) since the 1998-99 season.
Coming into this Northern California
series with such success, the Cardinal are
striving to raise all those sixes to sevens
when they play host to Pacific on Saturday
at the Avery Aquatic Center.
Coming into this event, the Cardinal
are a self-assured hunch. In its first meet
of the new year, Stanford dismantled a
strong, highly ranked Michigan team in
dominating fashion, a Wolverines team
that was coming off an inspiring win over
top-ranked Southern California. The Car
dinal will meet that same Trojan team at
home for their second-to-last dual meet of
the regular season.
In the competition against Michigan,
the Stanford A, Band C relay teams took
the top three spots in the opening 400-
yard relay event and never looked back,
cruising to a 136-102 win.
"Swimming so well against Michigan
was a huge boost in confidence for us,"
said junior Nick Wolfe, who finished sec
ond to senior teammate Gary Marshall in
a fast 200-yard breaststroke field. "Every
one was pretty tired from both winter
training and our strength routine, and 1
think some people were surprised at what
they could do."
Though fatigued, several Stanford
swimmers turned in season-best times at
the meet.
Those who set season bests included
Stanford's top freestyle sprinter, sopho
more Ben Wildman-Tobriner. who won
50-yard freestyle event; senior co-captain
Matt McDonald, winning the 200-yard
butterfly event; junior Tobias Oriwol.
who won the 200-yard individual medley
event; sophomore distance-specialist
Shaun Phillips in the 1000-yard freestyle;
and sophomore Kyle Ransom, who set
season-bests in both 50- and 100-yard
freestyle events.
This experience has led Wolfe to sug
gest that Stanford is able to step up in the
clutch and will be hard to beat in its up
coming meets.
"Coming into this meet [against Pacif
ic], we now know that we can perform well
while fatigued," Wolfe said. "Other teams
are really going to have to step it up if they
want to beat us."

Though not as bad as their record
would seem to show, the 1-3 Tigers will
need to deliver much stronger perfor
mances than their previous ones if they
wish to stay competitive on Saturday.
With three early dual-meet losses to
Florida State, California and Hawaii,
which left the team winless at year's end,
the Tigers drastically needed a boost.
They came out strong and got that boost
in their first dual meet of the season
against New Hampshire, where the meet
was completed with Pacific dominating in
every sense, winning 108-I^.
Now. Pacific will see if it can repeat its

succcss against a faster Stanford team.
If the recent past is any indication, the
Cardinal should not have too much trou
ble going 3-0 on the season and reaching
7-0 for the teams' series.
In dual meets over the past six years
between the two programs. Stanford has
won by an average margin of over 33
points. Its greatest margin of victory has
been 47.
This will be the final meet in a two
meet homestand for (he Cardinal, who set
off to meet No. 4 Arizona and Arizona
State on Jan. 21 and 22. respectively.
The Cardinal, however, plan to take

each meet at a time, swim hard at each
competition and work toward the ulti
mate goal of preparing fora great perfor
mance at the postseason Championship
events.
"Swimming against a team like UOP
can be a lot of fun since there is very little
pressure," said Wolfe, who has been a
part of dual-meet wins over Pacific on two
previous occasions.
With only a few thoughts focused on
the end result, the Cardinal plan on swim
ming strategically and swiftly in this up
coming meet against Pacific. The start of
the first event is set to be at 11 a.m.

With little pressure on their backs to defeat a 1-3 Tigers swim team, the Stanford men are looking to have a little fun on Saturday.
Not only are the Cardinal motivated by the six season-best times recorded earlier this month, but Stanford has the chance to rack up
its seventh win against Pacific in as many years.
