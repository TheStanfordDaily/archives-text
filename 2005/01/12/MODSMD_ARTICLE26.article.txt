# Right in the Babymaker
## Even with Philly, the NFC is irrelevant 
### 
After the fortuitous introduction of an eight
by-eight projection screen into my life, my ex
istence has been reduced to playoff football
and Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey '97. While
both these things are more than worthy of a
column, it's apparent that football takes
precedence for most readers. Therefore ...
Why is it that every playoff game is consid
ered a complete evaluation of

" V "'"K ,VIV w w.
a team's character? Granted,
the Vikings beat down the
Packers at Lambeau, but
Brett Favre had an uncharac
teristically bad game, and
Javon Walker injured him
self early.
Of course, the Vikings are
"for real," and"a Super Bowl
team," according to Sunday
night's Sports Center. Keep
in mind, this is a team that

backed into the playoffs after losing its last
game of the season to a brutal Washington
team, in a contest that Minnesota thought was
a must-win until the final minutes. At best, the
Vikings can be considered the third-best team
in the NFC, which is about as relevant as being
the best team in professional hockey right
now.
The prototypical response to the criticism
that the NFC has been receiving all year was,
up until the last few weeks, summed up by sen
tences that started "Yeah, but the Eagles ..."
When they kick off next Sunday, it'll have
been almost a month since Philadelphia won a
football game. The only difference in this
year's Eagles team is whether it sticks to the
formula of crapping all over itself in the NFC
championship game or shakes things up by
getting obliterated by the AFC champ in the
Super Bowl.
Meanwhile, the Falcons might be the worst
bye team in the history of the playoffs — and
they're lucky enough to face what might be
one of the most unstable postseason squads
ever in the Rams. I only wish both teams could
have lost in the Rams-Seahawks game Sun
day.
But hey, at least Seattle fans can console
themselves with the fact that they have Ro
gaine spokesman Matt "We want the ball,
we're gonna score" Hasselbeck at the helm,
who narrowly failed to redeem himself Satur
day for last year's playoff loss to Green Bay.
The Falcons will probably pull out a victory at


Dan
McCarthy
home next week against the Rams anyway, in what will
go down in NFL Films lore as the Least Relevant Playoff
Game Ever.
There are at least three teams remaining in the AFC
that would thrash any NFC' opponent on any given day.
not least of which is the Colts. As they proved Sunday
with their sequel to last year's embarrassing of the Bron
cos. the Colts can beat anyone — so long as it's a home
game in the first round.
I really hope the playoff albatross around Peyton
Manning's neck disappears this year after eight straight
losses to the Patriots at Foxboro, il only to keep the na
tional press — specifically, ESPN.com's Bill Simmons
from continuing to fellate Tom Brady. The Pats have
been flying under the radar since their loss to the Steel
ers, but their lurking presence, a la Chong Li in the im
mortal 'KOs movie Bloodsport, remains.
What pained me the most, though, was the Chargers'
meltdown at home on Saturday night. When placed in
context with what Bolts fans have gone through over the
past decade. I'm surprised rookie kicker Nate Kaeding is
still alive after missing a potentially game-winning field
goal in O F. I wouldn't be shocked if he just got shot walk
ing out of a gas station like Andres Escobar, the Colom
bian guy who scored an own goal in the 1994 World Cup.
Fora franchise desperate fora playoff win. this was an
other knife in the heart — this time from a Jets team that
picked a good day to play up to its potential.
The Chargers didn't help themselves, though, com-

Fact: If this were soccer,
Kaeding would be gone

mitting nine penalties for 75 yards, and to be fair, the
only reason they even made it to overtime was because
of a boneheaded roughing-the-passer penalty by Jets
linebacker Eric Barton.
Barton was probably the only person more relieved
after the game than Jets coach Herman Edwards, who,
while Kaeding was lining up his kick, was probably
hastily scribbling a reprise of his famous "You PLAY .
. .to WIN . .. the GAME!" self-defense speech to the
media last year. I think the only way he could top that,
in terms of intensity, would be to tear out a reporter's
heart and take a bite at the podium, something that
probably wouldn't have gone over well, even in New
York.
Still, that probably won't help the Jets next weekend
in Pittsburgh, where they'll face a Steelers team that is,
on paper, an unstoppable juggernaut. St) long as Ben
Roethlisberger doesn't come down with the rookie jit
ters that he's eluded all season, the Steelers will attend
the Super Bowl in Jacksonville, where Fox anchors will
take on the Herculean task of making Pittsburgh's NFC
opponent seem like a challenge before the game. In any
case, the game will be over by the second quarter, at
which time 1 can resume playing hockey.
And thus, the cycle of life continues.
Dan McCarthy, a junior, will be screaming "Where the hell
is my turbo?!" at the N64 for the next week. Try e-mailing
him anyway at dmcc23@stunford.edu.

After the fortuitous introduction of an eight
by-eight projection screen into my life, my ex
istence has been reduced to playoff football
and Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey '97. While
both these things are more than worthy of a
column, it's apparent that football takes
precedence for most readers. Therefore ...
Why is it that every playoff game is consid
ered a complete evaluation of

" V "'"K ,VIV w w.
a team's character? Granted,
the Vikings beat down the
Packers at Lambeau, but
Brett Favre had an uncharac
teristically bad game, and
Javon Walker injured him
self early.
Of course, the Vikings are
"for real," and"a Super Bowl
team," according to Sunday
night's Sports Center. Keep
in mind, this is a team that

backed into the playoffs after losing its last
game of the season to a brutal Washington
team, in a contest that Minnesota thought was
a must-win until the final minutes. At best, the
Vikings can be considered the third-best team
in the NFC, which is about as relevant as being
the best team in professional hockey right
now.
The prototypical response to the criticism
that the NFC has been receiving all year was,
up until the last few weeks, summed up by sen
tences that started "Yeah, but the Eagles ..."
When they kick off next Sunday, it'll have
been almost a month since Philadelphia won a
football game. The only difference in this
year's Eagles team is whether it sticks to the
formula of crapping all over itself in the NFC
championship game or shakes things up by
getting obliterated by the AFC champ in the
Super Bowl.
Meanwhile, the Falcons might be the worst
bye team in the history of the playoffs — and
they're lucky enough to face what might be
one of the most unstable postseason squads
ever in the Rams. I only wish both teams could
have lost in the Rams-Seahawks game Sun
day.
But hey, at least Seattle fans can console
themselves with the fact that they have Ro
gaine spokesman Matt "We want the ball,
we're gonna score" Hasselbeck at the helm,
who narrowly failed to redeem himself Satur
day for last year's playoff loss to Green Bay.
The Falcons will probably pull out a victory at


Dan
McCarthy
home next week against the Rams anyway, in what will
go down in NFL Films lore as the Least Relevant Playoff
Game Ever.
There are at least three teams remaining in the AFC
that would thrash any NFC' opponent on any given day.
not least of which is the Colts. As they proved Sunday
with their sequel to last year's embarrassing of the Bron
cos. the Colts can beat anyone — so long as it's a home
game in the first round.
I really hope the playoff albatross around Peyton
Manning's neck disappears this year after eight straight
losses to the Patriots at Foxboro, il only to keep the na
tional press — specifically, ESPN.com's Bill Simmons
from continuing to fellate Tom Brady. The Pats have
been flying under the radar since their loss to the Steel
ers, but their lurking presence, a la Chong Li in the im
mortal 'KOs movie Bloodsport, remains.
What pained me the most, though, was the Chargers'
meltdown at home on Saturday night. When placed in
context with what Bolts fans have gone through over the
past decade. I'm surprised rookie kicker Nate Kaeding is
still alive after missing a potentially game-winning field
goal in O F. I wouldn't be shocked if he just got shot walk
ing out of a gas station like Andres Escobar, the Colom
bian guy who scored an own goal in the 1994 World Cup.
Fora franchise desperate fora playoff win. this was an
other knife in the heart — this time from a Jets team that
picked a good day to play up to its potential.
The Chargers didn't help themselves, though, com-

Fact: If this were soccer,
Kaeding would be gone

mitting nine penalties for 75 yards, and to be fair, the
only reason they even made it to overtime was because
of a boneheaded roughing-the-passer penalty by Jets
linebacker Eric Barton.
Barton was probably the only person more relieved
after the game than Jets coach Herman Edwards, who,
while Kaeding was lining up his kick, was probably
hastily scribbling a reprise of his famous "You PLAY .
. .to WIN . .. the GAME!" self-defense speech to the
media last year. I think the only way he could top that,
in terms of intensity, would be to tear out a reporter's
heart and take a bite at the podium, something that
probably wouldn't have gone over well, even in New
York.
Still, that probably won't help the Jets next weekend
in Pittsburgh, where they'll face a Steelers team that is,
on paper, an unstoppable juggernaut. St) long as Ben
Roethlisberger doesn't come down with the rookie jit
ters that he's eluded all season, the Steelers will attend
the Super Bowl in Jacksonville, where Fox anchors will
take on the Herculean task of making Pittsburgh's NFC
opponent seem like a challenge before the game. In any
case, the game will be over by the second quarter, at
which time 1 can resume playing hockey.
