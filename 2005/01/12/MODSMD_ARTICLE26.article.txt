## Even with Philly, the NFC is irrelevant 
### 
After the fortuitous introduction of an eight
by-eight projection screen into my life, my ex
istence has been reduced to playoff football
and Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey '97. While
both these things are more than worthy of a
column, it's apparent that football takes
precedence for most readers. Therefore ...
Why is it that every playoff game is consid
ered a complete evaluation of

" V "'"K ,VIV w w.
a team's character? Granted,
the Vikings beat down the
Packers at Lambeau, but
Brett Favre had an uncharac
teristically bad game, and
Javon Walker injured him
self early.
Of course, the Vikings are
"for real," and"a Super Bowl
team," according to Sunday
night's Sports Center. Keep
in mind, this is a team that

backed into the playoffs after losing its last
game of the season to a brutal Washington
team, in a contest that Minnesota thought was
a must-win until the final minutes. At best, the
Vikings can be considered the third-best team
in the NFC, which is about as relevant as being
the best team in professional hockey right
now.
The prototypical response to the criticism
that the NFC has been receiving all year was,
up until the last few weeks, summed up by sen
tences that started "Yeah, but the Eagles ..."
When they kick off next Sunday, it'll have
been almost a month since Philadelphia won a
football game. The only difference in this
year's Eagles team is whether it sticks to the
formula of crapping all over itself in the NFC
championship game or shakes things up by
getting obliterated by the AFC champ in the
Super Bowl.
Meanwhile, the Falcons might be the worst
bye team in the history of the playoffs â€” and
they're lucky enough to face what might be
one of the most unstable postseason squads
ever in the Rams. I only wish both teams could
have lost in the Rams-Seahawks game Sun
day.
But hey, at least Seattle fans can console
themselves with the fact that they have Ro
gaine spokesman Matt "We want the ball,
we're gonna score" Hasselbeck at the helm,
who narrowly failed to redeem himself Satur
day for last year's playoff loss to Green Bay.
The Falcons will probably pull out a victory at
