# Card to compete in Menlo Park
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team (3-2,0-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) is getting used to
wrestling on the road, hut this weekend it
will finally get to stay in the Bay Area, if only
briefly, for the Menlo College Invitational.
The Cardinal last competed on their
home mats Nov. 23 in a 35-14 win against Di
vision 11 opponent San Francisco State.
Since then, they have traveled to dual meets
and open tournaments in Reno, Nev.,
Evanston, 111., and most recently Grand
Prairie, Tex. with mixed results.
"Traveling takes a toll on your wrestling,"
said junior 174-pound Imad Kharbush. "It
makes you a bit sluggish."
A tournament in nearby Menlo Park is a
welcome respite from the long travel, espe
cially as it gives the team a chance to

recharge and gear up for an extended road
trip in January.
The Cardinal will travel to lowa and Bak
ersfield, Calif., and make a three-stop swing
through Oregon, all before the end of the
month.
Stanford will not wrestle at home again
until Fresno State and Arizona State visit the
Farm on Feb. 4 and 5, respectively. Only
then will Stanford finally get a true break
from its massive road trip.
Spectators at the Menlo College Invita
tional will see quite a different line-up from
the wrestlers that the Cardinal sent to invita
tionals earlier this season. Unlike tourna
ments where Stanford sent only some of its
elite wrestlers, such as the Midlands Invita
tional. many of the Cardinal's top wrestlers
will sit out.
"The Menlo tournament is going to be
fairly small," said head coach Steve Buddie.

"It will he a chance for us to rest some of our
starters before our travel schedule gets a lit
tle hectic, while at the same time providing
us more matches which will get us the mat
time we need."
Finding the perfect balance between
gaining experience and getting rest may be
the most difficult part of the open tourna
ment. Stanford has unique interests in both
respects; the team has young talent that
needs the experience, but the Cardinal have
already seen wrestlers injured in open tour
naments this winter. Kharbush. who has
since returned to the mat. suffered a broken
nose in the Tournament of Champions in
Reno.
All indications so far are that the team
will err on the side of caution and give key
wrestlers time to recover from illness and in-
