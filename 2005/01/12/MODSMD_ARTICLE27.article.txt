# Card to compete in Menlo Park
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team (3-2,0-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) is getting used to
wrestling on the road, hut this weekend it
will finally get to stay in the Bay Area, if only
briefly, for the Menlo College Invitational.
The Cardinal last competed on their
home mats Nov. 23 in a 35-14 win against Di
vision 11 opponent San Francisco State.
Since then, they have traveled to dual meets
and open tournaments in Reno, Nev.,
Evanston, 111., and most recently Grand
Prairie, Tex. with mixed results.
"Traveling takes a toll on your wrestling,"
said junior 174-pound Imad Kharbush. "It
makes you a bit sluggish."
A tournament in nearby Menlo Park is a
welcome respite from the long travel, espe
cially as it gives the team a chance to

recharge and gear up for an extended road
trip in January.
The Cardinal will travel to lowa and Bak
ersfield, Calif., and make a three-stop swing
through Oregon, all before the end of the
month.
Stanford will not wrestle at home again
until Fresno State and Arizona State visit the
Farm on Feb. 4 and 5, respectively. Only
then will Stanford finally get a true break
from its massive road trip.
Spectators at the Menlo College Invita
tional will see quite a different line-up from
the wrestlers that the Cardinal sent to invita
tionals earlier this season. Unlike tourna
ments where Stanford sent only some of its
elite wrestlers, such as the Midlands Invita
tional. many of the Cardinal's top wrestlers
will sit out.
"The Menlo tournament is going to be
fairly small," said head coach Steve Buddie.

"It will he a chance for us to rest some of our
starters before our travel schedule gets a lit
tle hectic, while at the same time providing
us more matches which will get us the mat
time we need."
Finding the perfect balance between
gaining experience and getting rest may be
the most difficult part of the open tourna
ment. Stanford has unique interests in both
respects; the team has young talent that
needs the experience, but the Cardinal have
already seen wrestlers injured in open tour
naments this winter. Kharbush. who has
since returned to the mat. suffered a broken
nose in the Tournament of Champions in
Reno.
All indications so far are that the team
will err on the side of caution and give key
wrestlers time to recover from illness and in-

jury, even though Buddie and the
coaching staff have not yet released
the invitational's roster.
The return dates for senior cap
tain Matt Gentry and 197-pound
sophomore lan Bork are unknown
as yet. Gentry, an NCAA defend
ing champion at 157 pounds, was
sick this weekend and did not com
pete, while Bork is nursing a hyper
extended elbow.
Though the Cardinal would like
to have their star back, they are un
likely to rush him back — the stel
lar performance of junior Ray
Blake this past weekend highlight
ed Stanford's depth.
"It's always great having Matt in
the lineup, not only because of his
talent, but his leadership as well,"
Buddie said. "But we also have a

well as talented wrestlers like Ray
who are ready to step in and per
form."
Another possible adverse effect
of resting the team this week is the
loss of focus, determination and
momentum that the team has
gained recently. Buddie called last
week's practice sessions "the best"
he has seen in seven years. The ef
fects showed up in two important
wins this past weekend against
Harvard (0-4) and Air Force (0-3).
and in a great physical effort
against a tough No. 4 Michigan (5-
1) squad.
"We are not peaking yet," Bud
die said. "For us to come away with
the results we did for this time of
year is very encouraging. And. yes.

our practices did yield great results
.because I'm confident in saying we
wore down every team we wrestled
physically, even in the loss to
Michigan."
Losing its recent momentum
would be a huge detriment to Stan
ford, as one of its toughest tests of
the season looms next week when it
faces No. 3 lowa State (9-0) in
Ames, lowa.
In order to challenge the domi
nant Cyclones, Stanford will need
to be at full strength and will need
to have reached its full stride.
That is most likely where the
Menlo College Invitational fits into
the big picture of the season: it's
Stanford's stop back home to refu

that face them on the road ahead.

Losing its recent momentum
would be a huge detriment to Stan

the season looms next week when it
faces No. 3 lowa State (9-0) in
Ames, lowa.
In order to challenge the domi

to be at full strength and will need
to have reached its full stride.

Stanford's stop back home to refu

that face them on the road ahead.
The Stanford wrestling team (3-2,0-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) is getting used to
wrestling on the road, hut this weekend it
will finally get to stay in the Bay Area, if only
briefly, for the Menlo College Invitational.
The Cardinal last competed on their
home mats Nov. 23 in a 35-14 win against Di
vision 11 opponent San Francisco State.
Since then, they have traveled to dual meets
and open tournaments in Reno, Nev.,
Evanston, 111., and most recently Grand
Prairie, Tex. with mixed results.
"Traveling takes a toll on your wrestling,"
said junior 174-pound Imad Kharbush. "It
makes you a bit sluggish."
A tournament in nearby Menlo Park is a
welcome respite from the long travel, espe
cially as it gives the team a chance to

recharge and gear up for an extended road
trip in January.
The Cardinal will travel to lowa and Bak
ersfield, Calif., and make a three-stop swing
through Oregon, all before the end of the
month.
Stanford will not wrestle at home again
until Fresno State and Arizona State visit the
Farm on Feb. 4 and 5, respectively. Only
then will Stanford finally get a true break
from its massive road trip.
Spectators at the Menlo College Invita
tional will see quite a different line-up from
the wrestlers that the Cardinal sent to invita
tionals earlier this season. Unlike tourna
ments where Stanford sent only some of its
elite wrestlers, such as the Midlands Invita
tional. many of the Cardinal's top wrestlers
will sit out.
"The Menlo tournament is going to be
fairly small," said head coach Steve Buddie.

"It will he a chance for us to rest some of our
starters before our travel schedule gets a lit
tle hectic, while at the same time providing
us more matches which will get us the mat
time we need."
Finding the perfect balance between
gaining experience and getting rest may be
the most difficult part of the open tourna
ment. Stanford has unique interests in both
respects; the team has young talent that
needs the experience, but the Cardinal have
already seen wrestlers injured in open tour
naments this winter. Kharbush. who has
since returned to the mat. suffered a broken
nose in the Tournament of Champions in
Reno.
All indications so far are that the team
will err on the side of caution and give key
wrestlers time to recover from illness and in-
