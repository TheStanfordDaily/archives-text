(U-WIRE) —Oregon State Ath

up to provide life-saving relief as
sistance across South Asia, the area

earthquake, followed by a devas
tating tsunami that stretched over a
3,700-mile-wide path.
For every dollar contributed by
Beaver Nation, G.I. Joe's will
match the contribution up to
$20.()(X).
OSU student-athletes and G.I.

Asia.
More than % percent of gifts
given to NWMT go directly to the

agency and is the only West Coast
charity named to the Forbes Top
10 charitable organizations list.
"A disaster of this magnitude is
hard to imagine," said Soozi Red
key, vice president of Northwest
Medical Teams. "This is the worst
earthquake in 40 years, and the
deadly tsunami stretched across
the Indian Ocean. People who sur
vived have lost everything, and
their communities are in ruin."
"It will take billions of dollars
to rebuild medical clinics, sanita
tion, and restore water supplies.
Life-threatening diseases will be
widespread in the weeks to
come."
Northwest Medical Teams
sent its first team to Thailand on

Dec. 28. and recently sent teams
to Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Re
quests are pouring in for addi
tional help.
"Our volunteers will work in
local clinics and hospitals that have
been overwhelmed with people
who need medical care," Redkey
said.
"In the days ahead, we'll contin
ue to send volunteer teams and do
nated supplies to South Asian
countries, and I'm glad that our
volunteers are stepping up to help
out right away."
Donations from the general
public enable NWMT to send vol
unteers, medical supplies and sup
port for the efforts of local part
ners.
"We'll send as much life-saving
aid as possible," Redkey said. "We
have the volunteers, we have the
supplies ... we just need the funds
to set them to the field."
