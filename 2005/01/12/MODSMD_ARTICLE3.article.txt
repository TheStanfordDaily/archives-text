# Latest MLK volume unveiled
## 
### MIMA A. MOHAMMED 
Volume V of the fourteen-vol
ume Martin Luther King Jr. Papers
Project documents the famous civil
rights leader right after an extreme
ly difficult year that included inci
dents of police brutality and a near
fatal stab wound.
According to History Prof. Clay
borne Carson, the period between
January 1959 and December 1960
was one of transition for King. Car
son, the senior editor of the King Pa
pers Project, spoke at the unveiling
of the fifth volume.
Carson said that the new volume
covers King's life as he was emerg
ing from a stretch of time when he
experienced a "downturn in the
sense of momentum" and was "un
clear where he should go."
At that time, the younger wing of
the civil rights movement was start-

ing to engage in more radical
protests, like sit-ins and walk-outs,
but King did not initially know
whether he should condone their ac
tivities.
The latest volume also features
King's trip to India at a time when
his popularity was beginning to
grow on both the national and inter
national levels.
"1 didn't remember much about
documentary works," Carson re
called. It was his initial reaction
after receiving a phone call from
Coretta Scott King in 1985. She re
quested Carson to begin work on
the project that has now become the
Martin Luther King Papers Project.
Little knowledge on the subject
of documentary works did not stop
Carson and his students, who imme
diately headed to the library to find
guides to documentary editing.
Their mission was simple — to make

history out of the documents of the
past and honor the legacy of the civil
rights activist.
The book is entitled "Volume V:
Threshold of a New Decade January
1959 - December 1960" and it exam
ines the emergence of sit-in protests
that sparked the social struggles of the
1960s and the rise of King. It is part of
a series that features what Carson
calls "the most significant correspon
dence. sermons, speeches, published
writings, unpublished manuscripts of
one of America's best-known advo
cates for peace and justice."
The unveiling at the Bookstore
marked the end of months of work
that Carson described as "exhaust
ing but rewarding." To compile the
volume, several editors sifted
through hundreds of thousands of
documents relating to King. Only 2-
3 percent of those documents are
featured in Volume V.
Carson said "King understood
his need to identify with the stu
dents," as increasing student sit-ins
and riots were occurring. Before the
1960 presidential election. King was
arrested after his participation in a
sit-in. Consequently, then-presi
dential nominee John F. Kennedy
called Mrs. King to give his sympa
thies. a move which Carson says de
termined the winner of that presi
dential race.
The unveiling of this documen
tary work coincides with Martin
Luther King Jr. Day this coming
Monday.
However, Carson said he has
been "troubled by most King holi
day celebrations." He believes the
holiday has become increasingly as
sociated with sales and ski trips.
In contrast to these attitudes,
Carson said he believes that Martin
Luther King Jr. Day is "an unset
tling holiday, not a social holiday."
