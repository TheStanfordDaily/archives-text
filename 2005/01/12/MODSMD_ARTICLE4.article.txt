# James Hsu: great potential lost too soon
## 
### CASSIDY DELINE 
All Stanford students cope with rainy days, rush
ing to classes through the downpour or just choos
ing not to go at all. But few tackle the rainy day like
James Hsu did.
Hsu — who is presumed dead from the tsunamis
in South Asia — once started a business to "tackle
rainy days." He and his sister. Peggy, started a pro
ject design firm. Tray 6, to breathe new life into for
gotten products. Their first target: the umbrella.
But Hsu's successes spanned far beyond spiffy
rain gear.
As a student at the Graduate School of Business,
Hsu was actively involved in both the Entrepre
neurship Club and the Venture Capital Club. He
was also co-financial officer of the Stanford Busi
ness School Student Association.
Kevin Holmes. Hsu's best friend since age eight,
said Hsu wanted to get the most out of every minute
he spent at Stanford.
"This meant that we could spend very little time
together," Holmes said in an interview with The
Daily. "With some friendships this might have
caused distance, but with James and I.it was per
fectly fine. [It's) part of an understanding that came
from a lifetime of friendship."
It was not Hsu's academic or business prowess
that endeared him to his friends and family. In an e
mail statement, the Hsu family described him as
"outgoing and introspective, athletic and intelli
gent, bold and sensitive."
"The thing about James was that he wasn't one
of those people that are incredibly successful acad
emically, but lack certain social skills," said Ralf
Swenson. who was the principal of Hsu's high
school. "He had a sense of humor, friends from all
walks of campus and got along with everybody."
In 19%, Hsu graduated from Golden Valley
High School in his hometown Merced, Calif. Not
only was he the first valedictorian of the high
school's first graduating class, but he also accom
plished it in a scant three years because he started
taking high school classes in middle school. Swen
son commented on Hsu's extraordinary motivation
and the legacy he left at the school.
"What has been interesting since he graduated is
that I get these young people who come to see if
they can graduate in three years like James Hsu,"
Swenson said. "Everyone knows about what James
accomplished. He's the role model. When other
young, successful students came to talk to me the
name that came up was James."
In Merced. Hsu is also remem
bered as a determined player on the
Golden Valley tennis team. Coach
Cuyler 1 .egler said he knew Hsu as a
child and gave him tennis lessons for
nearly eight years. In an interview
with The Modesto Bee when Hsu
was first reported missing, Legler
said Hsu showed exemplary con
duct both on and off the court.
"James Hsu is one of the finest
gentlemen I've ever been around in
my life," Legler told The Bee. "He's
just a tremendous student and a
tremendous person. Even a better
person than a student, and I don't
think you could become a higher
student than he is."
After high school, Hsu studied
Political Science at the I 'niversity of
California, Berkeley. He graduated
in 2001 and jumped into the busi-

'Bold and
sensitive'

ness world, working at several com
panies before coming to Stanford
for his MBA. According to his re
sume, he worked with a start-up
music tech company, Kick.com, and
helped to raise $6.5 million from
Sony and Utah Ventures.
Since his graduation from Berke
ley, Hsu worked fora company that
specialized in touch-screen voting
machines, as well as for Sun Mi
crosystems and Yahoo. And then, of
course, there were the umbrellas.
Hsu is greatly missed bv those
that knew him, and his family is es
tablishing a memorial fund in his
honor. Details of where donations
should be directed will be printed in
The Daily when they are available.
A memorial service will be held at
Memorial Church at 6:30 p.m. on
Sunday, January 23.
