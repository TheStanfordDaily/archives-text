# ASSU debates sorority funds
## 
### NICK PARKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its first meeting of the New Year last night, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate scrutinized its policy of
not funding student groups for transportation costs in
light of a request from the Intersorority Council.
The ISC originally requested $4,900 from the Senate
to help pay for recruiting new members and for various
aspects of the annual winter formal, such as facilities
rental, security, refreshments and transportation.
However, the Senate's Appropriations committee,
which is headed by junior Dan Stringer, recommended
that the Senate allocate only $400 to the group because
it felt that the remaining requested money would "not
be expedient use of student funds."
In its budget request, the ISC requested $2,000 for
facilities rental costs, $1,500 for transportation to the
Sheraton Hotel, where the formal would be held, $ 1.000
for security and $400 for food.

But the Senate's Appropriations
committee originally approved only
the money for food, saying that ISC
should not receive further funding
due to "the potentially exclusive na
ture of the group."
The ISC was represented at the
meeting bv its president, senior Alex
Davies, and its vice president of fi
nance, senior Sarah Belton.
"We think there might be some
misunderstandings regarding ISC
and how inclusive it is," Davies said.
"Any woman who participates in
every day of recruitment is guaran
teed an invitation to the winter for
mal, and every woman who attends
all the recruitment events and the
winter formal is guaranteed a place
in a sorority if she wants it."
"ISC is actually very inclusive,"
she said. "It is open to any woman
who wants to pursue it."
Most senators spoke in favor of
funding the ISPs request for facili
ties rentals and security, but there
was disagreement over whether or
not the Council should receive
. money for transportation to the
event.

freshmen and thus would not have
cars; they would, therefore, have to
take the Marguerite, which the ISC
would have to fund.
Some senators argued that the
Senate has a policy of not funding
transportation costs for other groups
and should therefore not give money
to ISC for the Marguerite.
However, there were other sena
tors who believed that because the
ISC formal involves such a large per
centage of Stanford's undergraduate
population (10percent), it should re
ceive money for transportation.
Senator Ashley Matheus, a
sophomore and a member of the
Kappa Alpha Theta, said she
thought the Senate should fund
ISC's request for transportation
money.
"1 understand that we normally
don't fund transportation costs,"
added Matheus. "But those groups
tend to be relatively small and can
easily find other ways to fund their
costs, but because the ISC formal
affects so many students, I think
we need to fund their transporta
tion."
The Senate decided not to vote
on the issue; rather, they decided to
vote on the appropriation for ISC at
next week's meeting.
