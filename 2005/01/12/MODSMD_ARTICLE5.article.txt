# ASSU debates sorority funds
## 
### NICK PARKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its first meeting of the New Year last night, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate scrutinized its policy of
not funding student groups for transportation costs in
light of a request from the Intersorority Council.
The ISC originally requested $4,900 from the Senate
to help pay for recruiting new members and for various
aspects of the annual winter formal, such as facilities
rental, security, refreshments and transportation.
However, the Senate's Appropriations committee,
which is headed by junior Dan Stringer, recommended
that the Senate allocate only $400 to the group because
it felt that the remaining requested money would "not
be expedient use of student funds."
In its budget request, the ISC requested $2,000 for
facilities rental costs, $1,500 for transportation to the
Sheraton Hotel, where the formal would be held, $ 1.000
for security and $400 for food.
