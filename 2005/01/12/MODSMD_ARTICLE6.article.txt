# Stanford 2.0: Online courses draw top profs

### LAURA CARWILE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
You can do almost anything
today over the Internet. You can buy
your groceries, pay your mortgage,
and even find your soulmate. But
who knew you get a Stanford educa
tion as well?
The Alliance for Lifelong Learn
ing, or All Learn. started out in 2000 as
a non-profit effort by four institutions
— Stanford. Yale. Princeton, and Ox
ford — to offer non-credit online
courses to their alumni. In the past
four years, more than 10.000 people
have taken All Learn classes, but the

service has also changed in many
ways.
For example, enrollment in All-
Learn courses is no longer restricted
to alumni at the member schools but is
open to anyone who is willing to pay
tuition. Also, in 2001 Princeton
dropped out of the partnership, and
the service is currently searching for
other academic institutions to become
affiliates, according to its Web site.
For the courses that are Stanford
affiliated. Continuing Studies credit
is sometimes offered through the
University — fora higher tuition fee.
"The Alliance for Lifelong
Learning is a consortium that began

with Stanford, Yale, (Princeton) and
Oxford as an umbrella organization
for getting interesting and diverse
courses to a wide audience," said
Richard Martin, a professor at Stan
ford who runs a course on Homer's
Odyssey for All Learn.
Classes use books, CDs, message
boards, live chats, and other meth
ods of communicating information
across the computer. Classes repeat
every year and can range from %
minutes to 10 weeks, depending on
the depth and objective of the
course. There is also an online li
brary to assist students with what
All Learn calls "self-guided learn
ing."
For example, to take Martin's
nine-week course, clients pay a $250
tuition fee and then devote four to
six hours per week to reading as
signments, video lectures, online
discussion and live chat. For stu
dents to receive Continuing Studies
credit through Stanford, they must
pay $895 in tuition and complete a
final paper or exam.
While it may not provide the kind
of intimate teaching experience
found in teaching, say, a seminar on
campus, professors say teaching on
line also has its advantages.
English Prof. Hilton Obenzinger
has worked with All Learn. He said
that people who take the online
classes are able to add different and
often unusual perspectives to the
material because of their various
backgrounds.
" I n a class on Moby Dick 1 had one

student who was a sailor, and he pur
posely ended the course (and reading
the book) on Nantucket," Oben
zinger wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "It was a powerful nautical as
well as literary experience for him. "
Martin recalled that the course
materials for his class on the
Odyssey included a CD that fea
tured performances of the text by
professional actors and original
music composed just for the course
by Middle Eastern instrumentalists.
Martin and Obenzinger, along
with dozens of other faculty mem
bers, are involved in some way with
the courses that All Learn offers.
Some, like Martin, actually teach
the course to the online students,
while others, like Professor Ralph
Cohen, were the authors of only
the course material, while others
are employed to do the actual
teaching.
Martin compared the online
chats to teaching I HUM or another

large lecture course. However, the
process is not without its challenges.
Martin said that the process of set
ting a time for the chats could be a
inightmarei because one student
may live in Palo Alto and another in
Hong Kong or Athens.
Prof. Martin also confirmed that
All Learn is looking for other insti
tutions to take part. He said that
"there are plans to get on board a
number of other like-minded good
schools, and to market our courses
to their alumni."
Princeton also invested heavily
in All Learn when it was started in
September 2000. But in November
2001, only a month into the first
course offerings, it was reported
that the university had pulled out of
the alliance in order to pursue their
own interests.
As it stands, Stanford is a part
owner of All Learn, and Provost
Provost John Etchemendy also
services on AULearn's board of

Students can pay a larger tuition fee
to receive Continuing Studies credit

directors.
"John Etchemendy attends
meetings, he knows what we're
doing, but he isn't employed by All-
Learn," said All Learn representa
tive Dan Colman regarding
Etchemendy's relationship with 4'-
lLearn. "To a certain degree he rep
resents Stanford's interests there."
All Learn must also work with
the schools to decide which courses
to offer students and for how long.
"I work with people who head
up course development," Colman
said. "But I work with people in the
administration at Stanford. I try to
find professors there with whom 1
could develop interesting courses."
Despite the number of people
who have taken classes through the
service. Prof. Martin still sees the
who idea of online learning as a
work in progress.
"It's still very much evolving and
that's a lot of the excitement of All
learn," Martin said.

your groceries, pay your mortgage,
and even find your soulmate. But
who knew you get a Stanford educa
tion as well?
The Alliance for Lifelong Learn
ing, or All Learn. started out in 2000 as
a non-profit effort by four institutions
— Stanford. Yale. Princeton, and Ox
ford — to offer non-credit online
courses to their alumni. In the past
four years, more than 10.000 people
have taken All Learn classes, but the

service has also changed in many
ways.
For example, enrollment in All-
Learn courses is no longer restricted
to alumni at the member schools but is
open to anyone who is willing to pay
tuition. Also, in 2001 Princeton
dropped out of the partnership, and
the service is currently searching for
other academic institutions to become
affiliates, according to its Web site.
For the courses that are Stanford
affiliated. Continuing Studies credit
is sometimes offered through the
University — fora higher tuition fee.
"The Alliance for Lifelong
Learning is a consortium that began

with Stanford, Yale, (Princeton) and
Oxford as an umbrella organization
for getting interesting and diverse
courses to a wide audience," said
Richard Martin, a professor at Stan
ford who runs a course on Homer's
Odyssey for All Learn.
Classes use books, CDs, message
boards, live chats, and other meth
ods of communicating information
across the computer. Classes repeat
every year and can range from %
minutes to 10 weeks, depending on
the depth and objective of the
course. There is also an online li
brary to assist students with what
All Learn calls "self-guided learn
ing."
For example, to take Martin's
nine-week course, clients pay a $250
tuition fee and then devote four to
six hours per week to reading as
signments, video lectures, online
discussion and live chat. For stu
dents to receive Continuing Studies
credit through Stanford, they must
pay $895 in tuition and complete a
final paper or exam.
While it may not provide the kind
of intimate teaching experience
found in teaching, say, a seminar on
campus, professors say teaching on
line also has its advantages.
English Prof. Hilton Obenzinger
has worked with All Learn. He said
that people who take the online
classes are able to add different and
often unusual perspectives to the
material because of their various
backgrounds.
" I n a class on Moby Dick 1 had one

student who was a sailor, and he pur
posely ended the course (and reading
the book) on Nantucket," Oben
zinger wrote in an e-mail to The
Daily. "It was a powerful nautical as
well as literary experience for him. "
Martin recalled that the course
materials for his class on the
Odyssey included a CD that fea
tured performances of the text by
professional actors and original
music composed just for the course
by Middle Eastern instrumentalists.
Martin and Obenzinger, along
with dozens of other faculty mem
bers, are involved in some way with
the courses that All Learn offers.
Some, like Martin, actually teach
the course to the online students,
while others, like Professor Ralph
Cohen, were the authors of only
the course material, while others
are employed to do the actual
teaching.
Martin compared the online
chats to teaching I HUM or another

large lecture course. However, the
process is not without its challenges.
Martin said that the process of set
ting a time for the chats could be a
inightmarei because one student
may live in Palo Alto and another in
Hong Kong or Athens.
Prof. Martin also confirmed that
All Learn is looking for other insti
tutions to take part. He said that
"there are plans to get on board a
number of other like-minded good
schools, and to market our courses
to their alumni."
Princeton also invested heavily
in All Learn when it was started in
September 2000. But in November
2001, only a month into the first
course offerings, it was reported
that the university had pulled out of
the alliance in order to pursue their
own interests.
As it stands, Stanford is a part
owner of All Learn, and Provost
Provost John Etchemendy also
services on AULearn's board of

Students can pay a larger tuition fee
to receive Continuing Studies credit

directors.
"John Etchemendy attends
meetings, he knows what we're
doing, but he isn't employed by All-
Learn," said All Learn representa
tive Dan Colman regarding
Etchemendy's relationship with 4'-
lLearn. "To a certain degree he rep
resents Stanford's interests there."
All Learn must also work with
the schools to decide which courses
to offer students and for how long.
"I work with people who head
up course development," Colman
said. "But I work with people in the
administration at Stanford. I try to
find professors there with whom 1
could develop interesting courses."
Despite the number of people
who have taken classes through the
service. Prof. Martin still sees the
who idea of online learning as a
work in progress.
"It's still very much evolving and
that's a lot of the excitement of All
learn," Martin said.
