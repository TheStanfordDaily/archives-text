# Stanford Store goes mobile to increase revenue, visibility

Unless you habitually spend your
time on a stationary hike at Tresid
der Fitness Center or frequent the
bathroom after having too much
Jamba Juice, you probably do not
pass by the window of the Stanford
Store too often.
The Stanford Store, a student-run
merchandise store operated by Stan
ford Student Enterprises, commonly
known as SSE, is wedged between
Tresidder Fitness Center, the re
strooms and the Treehouse. Without
an external window for passersby to
see, the Stanford Store is not in a
prime retail location, argued SSE
Chief Executive Officer and ASSU
Financial Manager Justin Fishner-
Wolfson.
"And retail is all about location,"
he added.
For eight years, the Stanford
Store has struggled to attract shop
pers while the Stanford Bookstore
enjoys its central location on cam
pus. where tours end and students
flock to buy books.
"The location just drives me
nuts.' 1 said Fishner-Wolfson. "Give
me the same location as the Book
store and I'll do the same amount of
business."
So when he was hired as CEO of
SSE last spring, Fishner-Wolfson de
cided to think outside the box â€” lit
erally.
If visitors and students would not
come to back corner of Tresidder.
the Stanford Store would go to them.
At last June's Commencement, the
Stanford Store set up a mobile mer
chandising unit.
In September, the Stanford Store
set up tents in front of Branner.
Roble and Tresidder during Fresh

man Orientation.
In the coming months, these tents
will appear in well-trafficked loca
tions during Parents' Weekend and
Admit Weekend and at Graduate
School of Business events and some
athletic events.
The idea has paid off.
The Stanford Store's revenue
from July to December in 2004 was
up 42 percent from the same period
in 2003. Moreover, profitability dur
ing that period last year was up 557
percent from the year before. This is
particularly noteworthy considering
that 2003 was a record year in prof
itability for the store (Revenue is
total sales whereas profitability is
sales minus expenses).
Fishner-Wolfson reported the
percent change in revenue and prof
itability at the request of The Daily
but was reluctant to provide the ac
tual financial statements and dollar
amounts. The release of such infor
mation. Fishner-Wolfon said, could
hurt the ASSU's position when it is
in future funding negotiations with
the university administration.
The large percentage jump in
profitability compared to the in
crease in revenue is due to the struc
ture of the retail business, Fishner-
Wolfson said.
"Because retail has high fixed
costs, an increase in revenue creates
a significantly larger increase in
profitability," he said.
Fishner-Wolfson estimates that
50 percent of the Stanford Store's
revenue growth this year has been
due to its new mobile units. He at
tributes the additional 50 percent to
increased awareness about the Store
and to better work with Visitor Re
lations, whose tour guides now in
form visitors that the Stanford Store
