# Stanford Store goes mobile to increase revenue, visibility
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Unless you habitually spend your
time on a stationary hike at Tresid
der Fitness Center or frequent the
bathroom after having too much
Jamba Juice, you probably do not
pass by the window of the Stanford
Store too often.
The Stanford Store, a student-run
merchandise store operated by Stan
ford Student Enterprises, commonly
known as SSE, is wedged between
Tresidder Fitness Center, the re
strooms and the Treehouse. Without
an external window for passersby to
see, the Stanford Store is not in a
prime retail location, argued SSE
Chief Executive Officer and ASSU
Financial Manager Justin Fishner-
Wolfson.
"And retail is all about location,"
he added.
For eight years, the Stanford
Store has struggled to attract shop
pers while the Stanford Bookstore
enjoys its central location on cam
pus. where tours end and students
flock to buy books.
"The location just drives me
nuts.' 1 said Fishner-Wolfson. "Give
me the same location as the Book
store and I'll do the same amount of
business."
So when he was hired as CEO of
SSE last spring, Fishner-Wolfson de
cided to think outside the box — lit
erally.
If visitors and students would not
come to back corner of Tresidder.
the Stanford Store would go to them.
At last June's Commencement, the
Stanford Store set up a mobile mer
chandising unit.
In September, the Stanford Store
set up tents in front of Branner.
Roble and Tresidder during Fresh

man Orientation.
In the coming months, these tents
will appear in well-trafficked loca
tions during Parents' Weekend and
Admit Weekend and at Graduate
School of Business events and some
athletic events.
The idea has paid off.
The Stanford Store's revenue
from July to December in 2004 was
up 42 percent from the same period
in 2003. Moreover, profitability dur
ing that period last year was up 557
percent from the year before. This is
particularly noteworthy considering
that 2003 was a record year in prof
itability for the store (Revenue is
total sales whereas profitability is
sales minus expenses).
Fishner-Wolfson reported the
percent change in revenue and prof
itability at the request of The Daily
but was reluctant to provide the ac
tual financial statements and dollar
amounts. The release of such infor
mation. Fishner-Wolfon said, could
hurt the ASSU's position when it is
in future funding negotiations with
the university administration.
The large percentage jump in
profitability compared to the in
crease in revenue is due to the struc
ture of the retail business, Fishner-
Wolfson said.
"Because retail has high fixed
costs, an increase in revenue creates
a significantly larger increase in
profitability," he said.
Fishner-Wolfson estimates that
50 percent of the Stanford Store's
revenue growth this year has been
due to its new mobile units. He at
tributes the additional 50 percent to
increased awareness about the Store
and to better work with Visitor Re
lations, whose tour guides now in
form visitors that the Stanford Store
is an alternative to the Bookstore.
Stanford Store Director Patrick
Ward, a junior, also attributes a sig
nificant portion of the profitability
increase to better purchasing by his
four managers.
"We bought in bigger volume and
took advantage of price breaks when
they came while maintaining the
quality of our products," Ward said.
"For example, in November, Jans
port had a deal on sweatshirts, so we
rented extra storage space and
bought all of the sweatshirts that
we'd sell for the year."
Cutting costs is important, but
Ward said that the Stanford Store's
biggest challenge is increasing its
customer base. The mobile units
have done just that.
"Our mobile operations have al
lowed us to reach more people on
campus and increase awareness
about the Stanford Store, which
means more students and visitors
shop with us," Fishner-Wolfson said.
The units were not expensive to
create, and they do not require any
additional employees to the Stan
ford Store's current staff of 14 sales
persons, four managers and three in
terns. The Store only needed to buy
two tents, a few mobile credit card
stations and make some adjustments
to their inventory system. It was only
a slight scale up. Fishner-Wolfson
added, and the revenue return has
far outweighed the cost.
Students stand to benefit from an
increase in the Stanford Store's prof
its because, like all SSE profits, they
are funneled back to the ASSU. That
money is added to the ASSLJ's en
dowment. increasing the payout and
adding to the amount of money that
the ASSU redistributes to student
groups. About fifteen percent of the
current endowment consists of prof
its contributed by SSE, Fishner-
Wolfson estimated.
Fishner-Wolfson and Ward said
they hope to expand the use of the
mobile units to tap into the market
of professional school students. Cur
rently, the Stanford Store does not
carry merchandise with logos from
schools like the Business School be
cause there is not enough daily de
mand to move the inventory. With
mobile units stationed at profession
al school events, however, that prob
lem can be remedied.
Similarly, Fishner-Wolfson wants
the Stanford Store to have mobile
units at athletic events. This idea met
with some resistance, however, from
the Athletics Department, which has
a long-standing contract guarantee
ing the Stanford Bookstore to be the
sole merchandiser at sporting
events.
"Since 1983, the Athletic Depart
ment has contracted with the Book
store to do apparel sales at athletic
events," said Assistant Athletic Di
rector Carl Reed 11. "It will be okay
for SSE to sell if the Bookstore isn't
there, but the Bookstore will be at all
the home men's and women's bas
ketball games and most of the base

ball games."
It is possible, however, that the
Stanford Store will be able to sell at
athletic venues like gymnastics
meets, tennis matches and water
polo games that the Bookstore usu
ally does not attend.
Fishner-Wolfson wants the mo
bile units to grow in a controlled
fashion, a business practice that re
flects the theme of his tenure as chief
executive officer. In the past, SSE
has invested in several ventures that
did not stand the test of time — like
Flicks-to-Go, a lecture notes service
and a shuttle service.
"We used to start many different
businesses with varied success. It is
unfortunate when new ventures are
not successful because SSE's profits
go to support the ASSU: we have a
responsibility to spend our money
very thoughtfully," Fishner-Wolfson
said. "Right now, we want to get bet
ter in our core businesses. We will
get back to starting new enterprises,
but we will do it in a more controlled
manner."
Fishner-Wolfson was SSE's first ex
ternal hire, which he said made it
easier for him to challenge old ideas
and present new approaches. He
eliminated the SSE's linens program
that offered freshmen the opportu
nity to order bed sheets prior to ar
rival on campus — which he called
"a logistical nightmare" — in order
to focus on core businesses.
Increasing the Stanford Store's
profitability was a priority for Fishn
er-Wolfson when he came in as CEO
last spring. When he looked at the fi
nancial history of the store, he said.

Store hopes to market
wares to grad students

"Why are we not making more
money on this?"
Although Fishner-Wolfson has
increased the Stanford Store's prof
its over five-fold, some students are
still skeptical that the Stanford Store
is a worthwhile venture for the SSE
to support. Given the fact that loca
tion is so important in retail and that
the Store lacks a strong location, one
might wonder why SSE has chosen
to keep a retail business running in
that location. Two years ago, an
ASSU presidential candidate,
Michael Osofsky, wondered the
same thing.
"There are some really cool
things that could be put in the Stan
ford Store's place that could also be
student-run." Osofsky told the Daily
in an article from 2002. "In a space of
that size, we could easily fit a stu
dent-run arcade, music store or pizza
joint... I think they've done an awe
some job, but 1 also think that the
Stanford Store's space is underuti
lized given the space shortages at
Tresidder and the ability fora blos
soming student-run operation."
Fishner-Wolfson has expressed
interest in serving as SSE's GEO for
a second year. This spring, an SSE
selection committee will decide
whether or not Fishner-Wolfson will
serve another term. If he does, he
will be only the second of about nine
SSE chief executive officers to do so.
"I would be honored to serve
again next year," said Fishner-Wolf
son. "Even though this year has been
very successful, I see more work to
be done next year."
