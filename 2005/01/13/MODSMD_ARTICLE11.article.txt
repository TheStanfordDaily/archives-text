# On this day in Stanford History...

On Jan. 13, 19H7, The Daily ran a
story about a California appeals court
made a ruling in a case that involved
two Stanford professors. Below is an
excerpt:
"The California constitution gives
History Prof. Harold Kahn a right to
privacy that outweighs the right of a
former visiting professor to obtain
evidence fora lawsuit, a California
appeals court ruled today.
"In a $3.1 million lawsuit against
the University, former Visiting Prof.
Norman Davies alleged that Kahn
and 30 unnamed others made "false
and derogatory statements' about his
during a Jan. 16, 1986, meeting of the
History Department faculty. At that
meeting, the history faculty voted 12-
11 to deny Davies a permanent ap
pointment as a professor.
"Davies, as internationally
renowned specialist on Eastern Eu
ropean history, was a visiting profes
sor between Sept. 1, 1985, and Aug.
31.1986. He also served as director of
Stanford's summer program in
Krakow, Poland, and is tenured pro
fessor of history at the University of
London.
"After filing the suit on April 30,
1986, Davies sought a deposition
from Kahn. Kahn responded by fil
ing fora protective order to prevent
the taking of his deposition.
"The Sixth District Appellate
Court ruled that private testimony is
critical in the professorial appoint
ment process and therefore to 'the
fostering of academic excellence.'

On Jan. 13, 2000, The Daily ran a
story about a professorial talk that ad
dressed the "glass ceiling" that
women still faced in the workplace.
"Despite advances in breaking
the "glass ceiling' hindering women
m the workplace. Engineering Visit
ing Prof. Debra Meyerson said she
believes more subtle barriers remain
in the foundations of the business
world.
"Meyerson addressed this issue in
her article entitled 'A Modest Mani
festo for Shattering the Glass Ceil
ing' in this month's issue of the Har
vard Business Review.
"Meyerson's article, which she co
wrote with Joyce Fletcher of Sim
mons Graduate School of Manage
ment, contends that while incidents
of blatant discrimination against
women have become less common,
hidden gender biases, such as the em
phasis on individual achievement
and unstructured scheduling, are in
herent in workplace culture.
"'Not only are the biases difficult
to see, but there are also ideologies
that make it difficult for individuals
to see the patterns [of discrimina
tion!.' Meyerson said. 'We tend to at
tribute failure to individuals, and we
don't see the patterns.'
" The article notes that in the past;
organizations have attempted to deal
with discrimination in three ways: by
teaching women to fit into a male
oriented culture, by accommodating
the needs of women with special pro
grams and by tunneling women into
more 'appropriate' tasks."
