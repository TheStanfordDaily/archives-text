Bay Area children
of cancer patients
find support, fan at
student-led camp

On a bright, sunny day in mid-June, 95
children, ages 6 to 15, will arrive on the Stan
ford campus. They, along with their coun
selors, will bus to Cazadero, Calif. Here,
their one week at Camp Kesem will begin.
They all share an experience most kids
their age do not. Each has a parent who
suffers from cancer, is in remission from
cancer or has died of cancer.
Camp Kesem started the spring of 2000
when four Jewish Stanford students
found in separate studies that children in
the Bay Area who have seen a parent suf
fer from cancer typically lack the support
they truly need to cope with the situation.
Many of the young ones hardly know
what cancer is. They are often left under
the care of one parent — one who needs his
or her own support network — or they are
looked after by relatives, all the while won
dering where their mom or dad has gone.
The older ones are forced to mature far
faster than their peers. They might take
on the majority of household responsibil
ities, suddenly find themselves cooking
dinner for the family or driving their sib
lings to soccer practice. They often re
press their anger, depression and fear.
In 2001, the Stanford students decided
to act on their findings. They began Camp
Kesem as a Hillel social action project.
The camp opened with 37 campers and
24 counselors. The camp has expanded
since, and this year, 95 campers are ex
pected to join the Camp Kesem family.
Applications for camp go up in hospi
tals and oncologists' offices. The applica
tion itself is not extensive; it simply asks
for basic background information.
Campers are selected from the Bay Area
on a first-come, first-served. Because of
the financial burden families coping with
cancer typically experience. Camp Kesem
is free of charge for all its campers.
In order to raise enough money to sup
port the camp, the Kesem team works
year-round. They sponsor speaker events
at Stanford in hopes of bringing the mis
sion of Camp Kesem to a wider audience.
This summer, it is estimated that the ex
penses to run the camp will be $130,000.
Thus, the Camp Kesem team appeals to
individuals, corporations and foundations
during the year for contributions.
The children at Camp Kesem spend
one full week simply focusing on having
fun.
"The kids are not seen as kids of par
ents with cancer," said junior Ben Elberg
er. former camp counselor and education

coordinator. "It is a week for them to
enjoy just being kids."
While the emphasis is on the campers
themselves and not the situations they are
confronting. Community Outreach Coor
dinator William Woodward adds that one
of the camp's major functions is to act as a
support group.
"Cancer is not a very common occur
rence," he said. "When these kids come
and see that others are going through the
same experiences, they realize, 'Hey, it's
not just me.' "
The campers enjoy the activities avail
able in most summer camps. There are arts
and crafts and drama. There is also the
chance to explore nature, go swimming,
play various sports and take a chance at a
ropes course. Music — in the form of camp
songs belted by campers and counselors at
the top of their lungs — is prevalent be
fore, during and after meals.
Every evening, the kids and their coun
selors crowd around a camp fire and enjoy
talent shows and game shows. Every week
there is a memorial-like service during
which campers and counselors sit fora
moment and reflect on their experiences
and share their feelings.
Counselors are chosen through an ap
plication and interview process. In the
spring, they go through an extensive
training program that includes presenta
tions by oncologists and psychologists as
well as role-playing activities.
Campers are encouraged to keep in
touch after camp ends. They are all given
contact lists at the end of the week and
often speak with each other throughout the
year.
"I think IMing is very popular among
our kids," said Senior Coordinator So
phie Messer.
Structured events also reunite the
campers and their counselors.
According to Family Relations Coor
dinator Elissa Test, there are two re
unions a year for which campers are invit
ed back to the Stanford campus. Newslet
ters are sent out full of upcoming events,
memories and other support service in
formation. When a camper's birthday
comes along, cards and warm wishes are
always sent out.
The counselors agree that this social
network is one of the most valuable prod
ucts of the camp program. If the week ac
complishes just one thing, Elberger said,
he hopes it drives home the point that no
child is alone in dealing with the difficult
issues and questions they must confront
at home.
