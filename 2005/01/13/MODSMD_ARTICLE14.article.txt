# ALREADY STRESSED?
## Feel like winter quarter already has your head in a vice? Don't let stress-caused symptoms cramp your style 
### JESSICA LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's the morning before your first final of
the quarter. You stumble down the hall to
the bathroom, and there in the mirror, you
see it — a zit. And not just any zit, a zit of
third-eye proportions smack in the middle
of your forehead. How could this be? Yes-

terday your skin was crystal
clear and now you have to put
on a beanie before you can at
tack the biochem behemoth
that awaits you — the last
thing you needed.
This is not a rare experi
ence among Stanford stu
dents who might also find
more hair than usual coming
out in their hair brushes dur
ing periods of high stress.
Still, few realize that the mys
tery culprit is stress.
Excessive stress impacts the
body just as much as the mind,
if not more. It can appear in the
form of acne, mood-swings or
even hair loss.
"When I get stressed out I
find myself getting really
tired," said freshman Alia
Liberman. "I sleep worse and
my skin breaks out. My mood is
also much more susceptible to
change because 1 am really
tense all the time."
Laura McDonald, freshman,
also believes that stress affects
her body.
"When I am stressed, I find
that I eat more," McDonald
said. "I take comfort in food
— it makes me feel better
when 1 feel like things are
going badly."

One stressed student also named in
somnia on her list of symptoms.
"I don't sleep badly when I am stressed,
but 1 definitely sleep less because I feel
like I have to work more," McDonald
added. "I also feel more like talking to
people about my problems when I am
stressed, to help me deal."
Kate Bedford, a Peer Health Coordina
tor for Vaden Health Services, believes that
most stress is not a major health concern.
"It is important to really look at the terms
that you use," Bedford said. "The word
stressed can be used incorrectly. Stress is not
necessarily a bad thing. A championship
game can be stressful, but that doesn't mean
it is bad or good."

Bedford said there is a way to determine
the difference between unmanageable stress
and the "good" stress.
"Unmanaged stress can disrupt sleep and
make you feel tense or grumpy and affect
your concentration," Bedford said. "When
everything feels difficult and overwhelm
ing. that is a sign you are not managing your
stress well."

Bedford added. "Also, when students
are under stress they tend move their
focus from taking care of themselves to
their work. That can mean they don't
sleep enough, they don't eat as nutritious
foods and they don't take time to exercise
or have fun."
Kelly McGonigal, a health educator who
teaches stress reduction for the Stanford Pre
vention Research Center, said she believes
stress can cause numerous weight problems
such as the infamous "freshman 15."
"Stress influences weight in a number of
ways," McGonigal said. "Stress can in
crease our cravings for unhealthy food, es
pecially when stress is combined with
sleep deprivation."

Stress hormones actually encourage the
body to store fat, she added, which explains
why some people spontaneously gain
weight without changing their eating habits.
"If you try to deal with stress through ex
cessive exercise, you can actually increase
stress levels and exhaust your body's natural
resiliency," McGonigal said. "The best kind
of exercise to deal with stress and stress-re-

lated weight gain is anything
that you love doing, and that
creates a sense of flow or total
absorption."
She cited dancing, climbing,
running and yoga as common
examples.
"The most important aspect is
that you enjoy doing it, not how
many calories it burns," she said.
There are many different
ways of reducing unmanage
able stress. Bedford explained
that doing something "ex
treme" will not help the prob
lem. Rather, one must change
their lifestyle patterns to cope
with stress.
"You won't have any stress if
you drop out of school, but that
isn't what you want," Bedford
said. "What you want is to cope
well with the stress you have."
Getting enough sleep and eat
ing regularly are two of the most
important strategies for combat
ing the negative impacts of
stress, Bedford said.
"Reducing stress means fig
uring out your priorities and
that can be really hard on this
campus," she said, adding that
many Stanford students are
prone to overcommitting their
time, pushing themselves closer
to burnout.

"When midterms or finals roll around,
they find themselves under a lot of pres
sure," Bedford said. "It is hard to let go of
the need- to-do-everything mentality."
McGonigal believes that the key to re
ducing stress is a matter of changing one's
perception of life.
" Keep in mind the big picture — your goals,
dreams and values, and how your actions now
relate to them," she said. "Keep your focus on
the things that matter most to you."
She also warned students not to sacrifice
their current health and sanity to worry
about a hypothetical future.
"The best way to prepare to be happy in
the future," McGonigal said, "is to practice
being happy now."

It's the morning before your first final of
the quarter. You stumble down the hall to
the bathroom, and there in the mirror, you
see it — a zit. And not just any zit, a zit of
third-eye proportions smack in the middle
of your forehead. How could this be? Yes-

terday your skin was crystal
clear and now you have to put
on a beanie before you can at
tack the biochem behemoth
that awaits you — the last
thing you needed.
This is not a rare experi
ence among Stanford stu
dents who might also find
more hair than usual coming
out in their hair brushes dur
ing periods of high stress.
Still, few realize that the mys
tery culprit is stress.
Excessive stress impacts the
body just as much as the mind,
if not more. It can appear in the
form of acne, mood-swings or
even hair loss.
"When I get stressed out I
find myself getting really
tired," said freshman Alia
Liberman. "I sleep worse and
my skin breaks out. My mood is
also much more susceptible to
change because 1 am really
tense all the time."
Laura McDonald, freshman,
also believes that stress affects
her body.
"When I am stressed, I find
that I eat more," McDonald
said. "I take comfort in food
— it makes me feel better
when 1 feel like things are
going badly."

One stressed student also named in
somnia on her list of symptoms.
"I don't sleep badly when I am stressed,
but 1 definitely sleep less because I feel
like I have to work more," McDonald
added. "I also feel more like talking to
people about my problems when I am
stressed, to help me deal."
Kate Bedford, a Peer Health Coordina
tor for Vaden Health Services, believes that
most stress is not a major health concern.
"It is important to really look at the terms
that you use," Bedford said. "The word
stressed can be used incorrectly. Stress is not
necessarily a bad thing. A championship
game can be stressful, but that doesn't mean
it is bad or good."

Bedford said there is a way to determine
the difference between unmanageable stress
and the "good" stress.
"Unmanaged stress can disrupt sleep and
make you feel tense or grumpy and affect
your concentration," Bedford said. "When
everything feels difficult and overwhelm
ing. that is a sign you are not managing your
stress well."

Bedford added. "Also, when students
are under stress they tend move their
focus from taking care of themselves to
their work. That can mean they don't
sleep enough, they don't eat as nutritious
foods and they don't take time to exercise
or have fun."
Kelly McGonigal, a health educator who
teaches stress reduction for the Stanford Pre
vention Research Center, said she believes
stress can cause numerous weight problems
such as the infamous "freshman 15."
"Stress influences weight in a number of
ways," McGonigal said. "Stress can in
crease our cravings for unhealthy food, es
pecially when stress is combined with
sleep deprivation."

Stress hormones actually encourage the
body to store fat, she added, which explains
why some people spontaneously gain
weight without changing their eating habits.
"If you try to deal with stress through ex
cessive exercise, you can actually increase
stress levels and exhaust your body's natural
resiliency," McGonigal said. "The best kind
of exercise to deal with stress and stress-re-

lated weight gain is anything
that you love doing, and that
creates a sense of flow or total
absorption."
She cited dancing, climbing,
running and yoga as common
examples.
"The most important aspect is
that you enjoy doing it, not how
many calories it burns," she said.
There are many different
ways of reducing unmanage
able stress. Bedford explained
that doing something "ex
treme" will not help the prob
lem. Rather, one must change
their lifestyle patterns to cope
with stress.
"You won't have any stress if
you drop out of school, but that
isn't what you want," Bedford
said. "What you want is to cope
well with the stress you have."
Getting enough sleep and eat
ing regularly are two of the most
important strategies for combat
ing the negative impacts of
stress, Bedford said.
"Reducing stress means fig
uring out your priorities and
that can be really hard on this
campus," she said, adding that
many Stanford students are
prone to overcommitting their
time, pushing themselves closer
to burnout.

"When midterms or finals roll around,
they find themselves under a lot of pres
sure," Bedford said. "It is hard to let go of
the need- to-do-everything mentality."
McGonigal believes that the key to re
ducing stress is a matter of changing one's
perception of life.
" Keep in mind the big picture — your goals,
dreams and values, and how your actions now
relate to them," she said. "Keep your focus on
the things that matter most to you."
She also warned students not to sacrifice
their current health and sanity to worry
about a hypothetical future.
"The best way to prepare to be happy in
the future," McGonigal said, "is to practice
being happy now."
