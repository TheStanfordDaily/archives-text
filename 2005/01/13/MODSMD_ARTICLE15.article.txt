## Don't let anxiety disorder get you down — How to recognize the warning signs 
### LAUREN GONG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
You all know the feeling: Your
heart starts beating uncontrol
lably, you feel light-headed, your
breath quickens. These are all
normal symptoms of pressure-in
ducing situations. Whether it's
stage-fright or nervousness be
fore a hot date, we all recognize
the fluttering in our stomachs as a
sign of anxiety.
But when does stress go too far?
When does just a little worry turn
into a full-blown panic attack?
Taking it one step further, how can
you tell an uneasy feeling from an
actual disorder?
Anxiety can be defined as in
tense feelings of uneasiness, even
fear. Physical symptoms can in
clude restlessness, a lump in your
throat, fatigue, irritability, impa

tience and shortness of breath.
So just going off this list, who
hasn't suffered from a bout of anx
iety? Certainly not anyone at Stan
ford, where most students live life
on the edge of big tests, big games,
performances — not to menton
grad school and eventual careers.
But sometimes these symptoms
can become debilitating. Yes, anx
iety can sometimes be a motiva
tional force to excel, but if this feel
ing begins to paralyze you or inter
fere with your daily life, then there
may be a problem.
Physiologically, anxiety results
when your body releases hormones
designed to prepare you to react to
a threat. In other words, your
fight-or-flight instinct goes into hy
perdrive. When anxiety reaches
problematic levels, this hormonal
response can happen randomly
without causation and continue for

extended periods of time.
Excessive anxiety can be trig
gered by other medical conditions
as well. Factors such as an overac
tive thyroid gland, terminal illness,
built-up stress and heredity play a
major role in how individuals man
age anxiety. Some people's person
ality types are simply more prone
to anxiety than those of others.
Not surprisingly, counselors at
Vaden Health Center say that high
levels of anxiety are hardly rare
among Stanford students.
Whether it's the rampant per
fectionism, the crushing workload
or the super-competitive atmo
sphere (that means you, pre
meds) that instigates this problem,
the fact is that excessive anxiety is
not abnormal on campus. Luckily,
regular commiseration with your
stressed classmates might actually
help relieve more tension than

you might think.
According to the Vaden coun
selors, if one suffers from con
stant anxiety, he or she should
definitely see a doctor to find out
if they require treatment.
Scouring the internet, I found
that there are two main types of
medical treatments.
Anti-anxiety drugs called Ben
zodiazepines can successfully
eliminate the harmful effects of
stress. While they can help relieve
debilitating tension within an
hour, they are also highly addic
tive and habit-forming.
There are also many side effects
associated with this type of drug.
Anti-depressants such as Paxil,
Effexor and Prozac can also influ
ence one's brain chemistry to re
duce the occurrance of panic at
tacks and relieve stress.
In general, anti-depressants have

proven to be more affective, but
they also have their side affects and
are commonly used for more long
term therapy.
But drugs are definitely not the
only way to find relief — not by a
long shot.
Talk therapy and self-care have
also proven to be very effective.
Psychologists and counselors can
help one identify negative or dis
torted thoughts. They can also
coach people to develop better
coping skills, as well as healthier
eating and exercise habits.
Believe me, I'm not saying that
everyone with an anxious per
sonality should be treated for
anxiety disorder. Under most
circumstances, little to no action
will need to be taken. After all,
anxiety is a normal emotion. It
should only be a legitimate
worry if it starts to interfere with

day-to-day life.
Anxiety disorder affects millions
of Americans and is commonly dis
missed as plain eccentricity or art
aspect of one's personality. It can
be manifested in variety of forms
and can even be a precursor to de
pression and distorted body image
or play companion to obsessive
compulsive disorder.
I know a lot of people with very
anxious personalities, myself in
cluded. Only few see it as a prob
lem on a regular basis. Normal
worrying or stress should not be
identified as a disorder. However,
if you feel like the worry invades all
aspects of your life or impairs your
daily routines, then maybe you
should get it checked out.
