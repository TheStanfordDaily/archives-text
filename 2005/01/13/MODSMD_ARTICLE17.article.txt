## Editorial Include dental in health plan 
### 
Until recently, an Onsite Dental Care van
parked in the Vaden Health Center park
ing lot several days a week, providing low
cost dental care and oral X-rays. However,
this service has not been available for the past six
months. Because dental care is an important compo
nent of student health, Vaden and Cardinal Care
should bring back Onsite Dental Care. And in gener
al, more must be done to incorporate dental care into
Cardinal Care health plans offered to students.
Onsite Dental Care is an independently run ser
vice that operates four vans that serve various com
panies and college campuses throughout Northern
California. Each "mobile office" has dentists and
dental staff who offer a range of general and cosmet
ic dental services. The program uses the dental equip
ment to provide a full-service, high quality and —
most importantly — convenient service to students.
When Onsite Dental Care — fondly referred to as
the Dental Van — was available, its services were
very popular among students, post-docs and faculty.
It provided a convenient, low-cost option for routine
dental care, which is not covered by the Cardinal
Care health plan most students are enrolled in. The
disappearance of the Dental Van makes it very diffi
cult for students without cars to receive dental care.
Vaden and Cardinal Care should work together to
bring back the Dental Van, as it provides a valuable
and convenient service for students who may be too
busy to go off-campus to receive proper oral care.
During the academic year of 2002-2003, the Task
Force developed and administered a campus-wide
dental care survey to assess student interest, eco-

nomic preferences, previous experiences and will
ingness to pay for dental care; 1167 graduate stu
dents responded.
As a result of the survey, the University aggres
sively sought vendors for dental care and, with the
consultation of the Task Force, worked to develop a
comprehensive health care package that included
dental coverage.
However, nothing seems to have materialized
from these efforts, as dental care is still not offered in
a comprehensive health care package. It is time for
the University to heed the work of the Task Force
from two years ago and actually create this type of
medical coverage for students.
Although the Dental Van offers basic dental
care, it does not provide the more extensive dental
care that a dental insurance policy would cover.
These services include oral surgery, which is partic
ularly important for college students, as it is around
this age when wisdom teeth need to be extracted.
Student surveys show that most are willing to pay
for dental insurance, but purchased individually, den
tal insurance can be quite expensive. However, Car
dinal Care could obtain plans fora group of students
at lower rates and should work to meet these de
mands by at least offering the option of dental insur
ance within the comprehensive health care plan.
We encourage the Cardinal Care insurance group
not only to swiftly return the Dental Van, but to con
tinue discussions with insurance companies that pro
vide low-cost dental insurance plans for students.
Given dental insurance, students are more likely to
go to the dentist and maintain their oral health.
