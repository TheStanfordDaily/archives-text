## Ski trip cancellation warranted 
### 
Last weekend. Stanford's Risk Management
Department cancelled all ski trips to Tahoe
because of severe weather, dashing many
students' plans to hit the slopes before class
es started getting serious. Because many dorms pre
paid for rent and transportation, they will likely lose
thousands of dollars in nonrefundable expenses. In
spite of the side effects of the decision, the Risk Man
agement Department was right to put student safety
ahead of all other concerns, because the weather
posed a real danger to student well-being.
The conditions over the weekend were some of the
worst that California has experienced in recent histo
ry. The National Weather Service predicted 10 feet of
snow and wind gusts of up to 1 (K) m.p.h. at the start of
the weekend. Visibility was poor, and Interstate 80,
the freeway to Tahoe, was closed for 13 hours, al
though it was open for most of the weekend.
More important than the actual weather was the
uncertainty. At the start of the weekend, the Risk
Management Department did not know if the weath
er was going to improve or worsen over the course of
the next few days. They were also uncertain about the
level of expertise that student skiers had or the level
of judgment students would exercise on the slopes in
poor conditions.
In government, planners often assume the worst in
order to prevent anything catastrophic. This sort of
worst-case analysis is also fitting to the decision pro
cess that took place at the Risk Management Depart
ment. I lad Stanford allowed skiing over the weekend,
the best result would have been that students little fun

with the difficulty presented by the weather and the
worst consequence would have been a student injury
or death. Clearly, the downside far outweighed the
upside.
Some people might argue that the ultimate deci
sion to ski should belong to the individual and not the
institution. However, the University is responsible
for students' safety as well as their education.
Those people unhappy with the Risk Management
Department's ruling have already started with the ac
cusations that Stanford only cares about limiting its li
ability or wants to ruin the fun for students. The school
did limit its liability by canceling the trips, but student
safety and well-being probably had more of an impact
on its decision than did financial considerations.
Although dorms will likely lose money and stu
dents have missed a ski trip opportunity, the Risk
Management Department is not to blame for had
weather. In booking the lodging and transportation,
dorms were making a bet on the weather, although
they may not have realized this at the time.
Bad weather has interrupted ski trips before, and
it will probably do so again in the future. Instead of
blaming the administration, dorm staff should take
this as a lesson for next winter and negotiate clauses
that allow for reimbursements and rescheduling in
the case of bad weather.
As the snow settles after last weekend, many are
probably disappointed. Playing it safe — like wearing
a helmet while bicycling — is never a glamorous.
However, when the danger is great enough, it is some
times the wisest course of action.
