Singing for their supper
In an effort to increase the number of Stanford students who can sina
the school song, the Office of Freshmen and Transfer Students bribed
freshmen with pizza and ice cream to learn and perform "Hail Stan- 1
ford, Hail." Over 250 students participated from Cedro, Alondra,
Otero, Rinconada, Trancos, Junipero, Faisan, Adelfa and Eucalipto.
