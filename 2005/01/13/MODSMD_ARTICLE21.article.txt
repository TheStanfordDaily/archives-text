## They're talking about you 
### 
Some parts of human nature
can never be explained. I
think that perhaps one mys
tery is why we always assume
that when people are talking in
other languages — particularly in
public places — they are talking
about us.
I know we have all had this expe
rience— especially living in Cali
fornia — and probably all had a vis
ceral reaction when we have been
exposed to these inaccessible con-

versations.
Something,
somewhere in
side you tells you
that people are
"talking about
you."
I'm here to tell
you that is not al
ways the case.
Let me tell
you about an ex
perience I had as

house manager of EBF. A potential
resident came by with two friends,
and they were all speaking in Chi
nese. I did not understand anything
they were saying, fine, hut as time
went on and I gave them a tour of
the house, I had the distinct feeling
they were talking about me.
Later, as the resident was leaving
with his key, one of his friends re
peated something I had said in En
glish. and then they all laughed.
I was right in that case, but that's
just one of those experiences. And
yes, we all have that friend who
wowed and amazed her verbal at
tackers at some point by busting out
with some Spanish or whatever
when those around her made a
wrong assumption.
These, my friends, are isolated
incidents.
People who speak in their own
languages are almost never talking
about you. Honestly. American cul
ture is so individualistic that few
people take the time to look at
nonetheless talk about — the peo
ple around them.
Additionally. I have never heard
anyone complaining about people
whispering to each other in English
in public places to the extent that I
have heard complaints about people
speaking in other languages. To me,
the concept is the same information
that you are not privy to.
There are so many other reasons
for people to speak to each other in
their own languages, although peo
ple who can only speak one lan

guage may not understand why. In
my personal experience, I speak
Spanish often to my friends here at
Stanford fora variety of purposes.
Spanish is such a personal lan
guage, and for me it is always going
to be connected to my family —
people I love. Thus, I usually only
speak Spanish with close friends for
whom I have a lot of affection. This
works out splendidly, due to the fact
that Spanish has so many levels of
built-in familiarity that English sim
ply lacks.
Sometimes I have the urge to
speak Spanish with my close friends
who can't speak Spanish and feel
quite frustrated when I realize that
they won't understand me. There
are some things better said in other
languages, and not being able to
communicate in this way with my
friends frustrates me, although I
don't hold it against them.
And I will admit that, occasional
ly, I speak in hushed Spanish tones
with my friends to comment on what
is going on around us — including
other people. However, I do that
same exact thing in English with my
friends who don't speak Spanish,
and no one seems to have a problem
with that.
So what's the big deal?
History has shown us that hu
mans will always outwardly sub
scribe to tolerance but then turn
around and fear new things at the
first opportunity. 1 think we don't
like these unknown words because
it's a feeling of powerlessness that is
impossible to overcome in any other
way but to learn the unknown lan
guage.
I personally think that everyone
should learn as many languages in
their lives as possible, primarily be
cause it opens up your mind to so
many more ways of conceiving the
world. 1 know two and am on my
third, and it never ceases to amaze
me how different the world looks
through another language's words.
And finally, the main reason why
I think that we shouldn't fear these
unknown languages that dance
around us is quite frankly this: If I'm
going to talk about you, I'll do it in
any damn language 1 please and
there is nothing you can do to stop
me.
