National Guard served important
role during Cold War era
In his attempt to belittle Presi
dent George W. Bush's service at
the time of the Vietnam War. Nick
Fram has smeared the entire Air
National Guard.
By saying, "there was no known
attack on Texas by the Vietnamese
during the N7()s." he disregards the
important role the Air National
Guard played in deterring Soviet
air missions during the Cold War.
Remember, only six years before
Bush's enlistment, the Soviet
Union had stockpiled nuclear
weapons in Cuba.

Additionally, the F-102 plane
that Bush Hew was an extraordinar
ily dangerous aircraft, and its pilots
risked their lives with every flight.
According to http://aerospaceweb.
org. of the 875 F-102 As that entered
duty, 259 were lost, taking 70 pilots
with them.
I believe Frani owes the Air Na
tional Guard veterans an apology
for dismissing their dangerous ser
vice. and a thank-you for the pro
tection they provided during the
Cold War.
