# New drinking gadget sparks debate at CU

### JOSEPH THOMAS COLORADO DAILY UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO 
(U-WIRE) BOULDER. Colo. —
The future of a new controversial vapor
ized form of hard alcohol is still up in the
air, as doctors, legislators, and educators
weigh in on this new way to consume al
cohol.
Last week state Sen. Bob Hagedorn,
D-Aurora, introduced a bill that if
passed would create a statewide ban on
"alcohol without liquid" (AWOL) de
vices.
AWOL is marketed as new low-calo
rie, low-carbohydrate, glassless way to
drink hard alcohol. The manufacturer
even claims the device is the "ultimate
party tool." The company's claims in
clude reducing the effects of hangovers
and vomiting.
An oxygen generator and a hand
held vaporizer comprise the device. A
shot of hard alcohol is poured into the
vaporizer, which transforms the alcohol
into a mist. The alcoholic mist is then
mixed with the oxygen and then inhaled
by the user.
Many people from around the state
argue that there are too many risks asso
ciated with the device, and whether the
ultimate party tool has a place in Col
orado at all.
AWOL did not return the Colorado
Daily's phone calls by press time.
Opponents of AWOL argue that
with traditional forms of drinking, one
has at least a rudimentary formula to cal
culate how much alcohol is in their sys
tem. One can calculate how much alco
hol is in beer and wine, and most even
have some idea of the alcohol content of
mixed drinks, accordini> to opponents of
AWOL.
"What it does is it makes the inges
tion of alcohol into the system more effi
cient; it is a quicker way to get drunk,"
said Bob Maust. vice-chancellor of stu
dent affair's alcohol program at CU-
Boulder. "It is more dangerous, because
your body wouldn't be giving you the
feedback until it is too late."
Vaporized alcohol first made an ap
pearance in the United States in Aug.
2004, in New York City, and its users are
mostly concentrated on the East Coast.
"It is an incredibly dangerous way to
get alcohol into the system," said Hage
dorn. "The individual has no control
over how much alcohol they are putting
into their brain."
Binge drinkers will likely suffer criti
cal side effects more quickly than those
who binge-drink in traditional ways.
"The concern is that, if you get a very
high dose very quickly and is then
cleared from the system, the chance for
seizure is significantly increased," said
Ivor Douglas, M.D., Assistant Professor
of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medi
cine and Director of the Medical Inten
sive Care at Denver Health and Univer
sity of Colorado Health Sciences Center.
Health officials are not just worried
about the intake of liquor, but the intake
of toxins in spirits.
"When you buy spirit alcohol that is
not pure alcohol, it is a combination of
extracted alkaloids from other plants,"
said Douglas.
"Essentially what you are inhaling is
not just alcohol — it is potentially a very
noxious combination of bad stuff. A lot
of those other alkaloids are very potent
things that would go in your bowels and
not be absorbed, they would pass right
through. When you inhale them, you
have the opportunity to absorb that
other stuff as well," said Douglas.
Implications of the new method may
also impact drivers. Medical experts say
there is a chance that breathalyzers may
not be accurate when one uses AWOL.
to consume alcohol.
"What is going to happen is that peo
ple will take a hit of this, and are going to
feel really drunk after a small amount of
alcohol," said Douglas. "They will be
functionally intoxicated, but after a
breathalyzer test and you will be func
tionally below the legal limit because the
alcohol has gone right out of your lungs
and into your brain."
The product is so new that some fed
eral agencies are not even sure if they
have oversight over the product.
"As for the regulation issue," said
Kathleen K. Ouinn. director of media
relations for the Food and Drug Admin
istration, "depending on the marketing,
intended use, and product it may be
something that could fall under FDA
purview."
The Alcohol Tax and Trade Bureau
has already conducted its own internal
tests of AWOL to see if the product fell
under their jurisdiction.
"It is a delivery device, so it does not
fall under federal jurisdiction for alcohol
beverages, said Art Resnick, director
of media affairs for the Alcohol Tax and
Trade Bureau. "For it to fall under fed
eral jurisdiction the product would have
to act as a 'still.' If it is a device to make
distilled spirits then it would require li
censing and could only be used on cer
tain premises, we would have all kinds of
jurisdiction over the 'still."'
