## Sherwood Cup will provide stiff competition 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
The weather forecast for Thousand
Oaks, Calit., this weekend looks promising,
as do the Stanford men's tennis team's
chances in the Sherwood Cup, to be held
tomorrow through Monday.
Having not competed since November,
the No. 7 Cardinal hope their return to the
court brings better results than last year's
appearance in this tournament, when all six
singles players were dealt first-round loss
es.
The Cardinal will have to be on top of
their game, as many formidable opponents
will be returning to the tournament held
north of L.A. Among the teams competing
are top-ranked Baylor, No. 2 UCLA and
No. 8 USC.
All three teams handed Stanford losses
in last year's first round of singles action,
and Baylor ended last season with an im
pressive 24-match winning streak. In addi
tion. Baylor boasts last season's ITA Na
tional Player of the Year. Benedikt Dorsch,
as well as NCAA singles title-holder Ben
jamin Becker.

However, Baylor isn't the only team en
tering this weekend with NCAA Champi
ons. Senior Sam Warburg and junior KC
Corkery are the defending NCAA doubles
champions and look to better their record
and continue to gain more experience be
fore the dual match season begins Jan. 29 at
Berkeley.
Warburg is not only looking to make a
dent in the doubles draw but also in the sin
gles bracket. He began the fall season
ranked No. 2 in singles by the ITA. but he
feels as though he's equally ready for dou
bles. However, Warburg said that he will
not be able to tell for sure until he has eased
into the season with a few matches.
"When you haven't been (playing
matches and getting back into match
shape]," Warburg said, "you don't really
know [where you stand} until you can play
a couple matches and evaluate it from
there."
The senior captain is looking at this
weekend as a stepping stone for the rest of
the season.
"It's good to get our feet wet, because
we've got a big dual-match season coming
up," Warburg said.

Also ready to compete is Corkery, who
was No. 65 in the ITA rankings at the con
clusion of last year and No. 20 in this year's
pre-season poll. During the National In
door Championships held in the fall, the ju
nior was victorious in the consolation
bracket and also tallied a straight-set win at
the No. 1 singles spot in November against
Hawaii.
The Warburg-Corkery pairing is set,
but other pairings are less definite, as
head coach John Whitlinger is trying to
get a feel for which players have the most
on-court chemistry. Whitlinger will use
this weekend to experiment with various
combinations.
"The tournament at Sherwood is about
learning more in doubles about who can
play with one another, who complements
one another," Whitlinger said.
Freshman Phil Kao will most likely be
included in that lineup as he looks to be a
promising doubles player and has pro
duced notable results in his debut season.
Paired with Corkery in Hawaii at the top
doubles spot, the tandem won a decisive 8-
5 victory. Kao also advanced to the third
round of the Wilson / ITA Regional Cham

pionships, held in October.
Whitlinger noted Kao's success during
the fall.
"Sometimes freshman year is a transi
tional year with Stanford academics and
Stanford athletics but he handled it great,"
Whitlinger said. "I'm thrilled with his
progress, and he's going to [get] better and
better."
The younger members of the team are
not the only ones producing results. Senior
Phil Sheng was two for two in Hawaii, as he
won both his singles and doubles matches
played at the No. 2 spot, and also moved on
to the round of 16 in the Wilson / IT A Re
gional Championships.
This weekend's tournament will be es
pecially meaningful for Sheng, as he is orig
inally from Thousand Oaks and is looking
forward to the trip home.
"It'll be a lot of fun going back home," he
said. "A lot of family and friends are coming
to watch me. I grew up my whole life playing
there."

slight damper on practices since returning

this weekend with confidence.
"Last year the team did awful,
probably the worst tournament in
a long time," Sheng said. "We're
working twice as hard as we did
last year, so I think we'll have a

Sheng excited to
compete at home

good tournament."
Stanford's only other senior
agreed about the team's recent
efforts.
"As a team, I feel like we're in
a lot better shape than we've ever
been in," Warburg said. "In the

four years I've been here, this is
the hardest we've trained. We've
been working hard for five
months — lots of early mornings,
lots of tough workouts; this is the
time when we start seeing all the
payoffs."

are top-ranked Baylor, No. 2 UCLA and
No. 8 USC.
All three teams handed Stanford losses
in last year's first round of singles action,
and Baylor ended last season with an im
pressive 24-match winning streak. In addi
tion. Baylor boasts last season's ITA Na
tional Player of the Year. Benedikt Dorsch,
as well as NCAA singles title-holder Ben
jamin Becker.

However, Baylor isn't the only team en
tering this weekend with NCAA Champi
ons. Senior Sam Warburg and junior KC
Corkery are the defending NCAA doubles
champions and look to better their record
and continue to gain more experience be
fore the dual match season begins Jan. 29 at
Berkeley.
Warburg is not only looking to make a
dent in the doubles draw but also in the sin
gles bracket. He began the fall season
ranked No. 2 in singles by the ITA. but he
feels as though he's equally ready for dou
bles. However, Warburg said that he will
not be able to tell for sure until he has eased
into the season with a few matches.
"When you haven't been (playing
matches and getting back into match
shape]," Warburg said, "you don't really
know [where you stand} until you can play
a couple matches and evaluate it from
there."
The senior captain is looking at this
weekend as a stepping stone for the rest of
the season.
"It's good to get our feet wet, because
we've got a big dual-match season coming
up," Warburg said.

Also ready to compete is Corkery, who
was No. 65 in the ITA rankings at the con
clusion of last year and No. 20 in this year's
pre-season poll. During the National In
door Championships held in the fall, the ju
nior was victorious in the consolation
bracket and also tallied a straight-set win at
the No. 1 singles spot in November against
Hawaii.
The Warburg-Corkery pairing is set,
but other pairings are less definite, as
head coach John Whitlinger is trying to
get a feel for which players have the most
on-court chemistry. Whitlinger will use
this weekend to experiment with various
combinations.
"The tournament at Sherwood is about
learning more in doubles about who can
play with one another, who complements
one another," Whitlinger said.
Freshman Phil Kao will most likely be
included in that lineup as he looks to be a
promising doubles player and has pro
duced notable results in his debut season.
Paired with Corkery in Hawaii at the top
doubles spot, the tandem won a decisive 8-
5 victory. Kao also advanced to the third
round of the Wilson / ITA Regional Cham

pionships, held in October.
Whitlinger noted Kao's success during
the fall.
"Sometimes freshman year is a transi
tional year with Stanford academics and
Stanford athletics but he handled it great,"
Whitlinger said. "I'm thrilled with his
progress, and he's going to [get] better and
better."
The younger members of the team are
not the only ones producing results. Senior
Phil Sheng was two for two in Hawaii, as he
won both his singles and doubles matches
played at the No. 2 spot, and also moved on
to the round of 16 in the Wilson / IT A Re
gional Championships.
This weekend's tournament will be es
pecially meaningful for Sheng, as he is orig
inally from Thousand Oaks and is looking
forward to the trip home.
"It'll be a lot of fun going back home," he
said. "A lot of family and friends are coming
to watch me. I grew up my whole life playing
there."

from break, the team approaches
this weekend with confidence.
"Last year the team did awful,
probably the worst tournament in
a long time," Sheng said. "We're
working twice as hard as we did
last year, so I think we'll have a

Sheng excited to
compete at home

good tournament."
Stanford's only other senior
agreed about the team's recent
efforts.
"As a team, I feel like we're in
a lot better shape than we've ever
been in," Warburg said. "In the

four years I've been here, this is
the hardest we've trained. We've
been working hard for five
months — lots of early mornings,
lots of tough workouts; this is the
time when we start seeing all the
payoffs."
The weather forecast for Thousand
Oaks, Calit., this weekend looks promising,
as do the Stanford men's tennis team's
chances in the Sherwood Cup, to be held
tomorrow through Monday.
Having not competed since November,
the No. 7 Cardinal hope their return to the
court brings better results than last year's
appearance in this tournament, when all six
singles players were dealt first-round loss
es.
The Cardinal will have to be on top of
their game, as many formidable opponents
will be returning to the tournament held
