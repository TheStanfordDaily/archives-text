# The 						Double Clutch
## It wasn't alright then, and it's not all right now 
### 
It is a Kafka-esque experience to find that
you have gone from reporting the news
to makingthe news. 1 found myself in just
such a metamorphosis (ha!) last week.
The Double Clutch initiated controversy
with last week's 25 inches. After effusive
praise of USC football, the Trojan Band was
lambasted and accused of theft for their play
ing of 'All Right Now', which, as any Stanford
fan will attest, is "the signature song of the Le
land Stanford Junior University Marching
Band."
USC's band was then called "the most an
noying gang of troubadours in collegiate

sports."
Needless to say, every
one took the time to make
their opinions known.
LSJUMB member and for
mer drum majorette Lori
Karns dismissed it as envy.
"Their unceasing, mediocre
renditions of ARN only
confirm the fact that their
undersexed existence can
only be mitigated by a pa
thetic attempt to emulate the

success of others ... Cal may be our rivals, but
U$C is the enemy."
A letter to The Daily deemed it "piracy"
and called for the USC band to be barred from
Stanford Stadium.
Those e-mailers who were courteous
enough to sign their names (thanks to all one
third of you) were very gracious and polite,
took the time to use punctuation, and ex
pressed their opinions in a manner befitting of
educated students.
A clarification: I did not mean to imply that
USC had rolled out 'All Right Now' strictly
for the Orange Bowl. Many readers pointed
me to the fact that they've played the song for
a good long while. I simply noted that the al
leged pilfering should be all the more offen
sive given that it was the Pac-10 Conference's
finest moment of the year.
Of course, that begs the question: when did
USC start playing the song? One unsigned e
mailer said, and this quote is verbatim, "Dude,
SC has been playing 'All Right Now' for an f'n
century what are you talking about. What are
you a 10 year old?"
According to Dr. Wesley Chang, a USC
alumnus, the Trojan Marching Band began
playing the song in the 1972 season. (In fact,
the song itself dates back to only the 19705, so
I guess Mr. Dude needs to adjust his clock by
a few decades.)
1 had contended, per the LSJUMB Web
site, that we had debuted the song at the 1972
Rose Bowl. So, in Chang's words. "... the
Stanford band DID start playing the song be
fore the Trojan Marching Band, but by only
ONF game."
In other words, we played it first, and they
stole it.
The most common argument I read said
that Stanford itself had stolen the song, or that
we do not hold its copyright, or some legalese
like that. Well, from what I know, that's abso
lutely true. However, we are not alone. For
decades, Ohio State's band has taken The Mc-
Coys' 'Hang On Sloopv' as a quasi-official
song. And if some other Big Ten band were to
strike it up, they'd be pilloried out of the
Horseshoe and pelted with fruit.
(I'm not even going to get into the issue of
Script Ohio,' a formation which OSU took
from the Michigan Marching Band, who
themselves originated the on-field band.)

gig because everyone is afraid they'll launch

On one serious note, I am very surprised the Pac-10
allows the Trojan Hand to go into other schools' stadi
ums and turn them into a Tribute to Troy jukebox for
four hours.
Part of home-field advantage should be the right to
keep the opposing team's band from taking over the
airspace.
Then again, the conference lets the LSJUMB do all
the things that make them great, pushing (past) the
boundaries of decorum and good taste.
All the cross-college banter reminded me of a story
I once heard. A Stanford student found himself seated
between a Cal student and a US( student on a plane.
The Cal student said, "I'm going to get a Coke."

Have annoying
band, will travel

The Stanford student graciously offered to re
trieve it.and while he was gone, the Cal student spit
in his shoe. When he returned, the USC student said
he would also like a Coke. Again, while he was gone,
the man spit in his shoe.
Upon returning, the Stanford student said. "Why
must we always be divided by the colors we wear?
When are all of these petty games going to stop? All
the spitting in shoes and peeing in Cokes?"
The moral of the story is: Always get your own
drink.

According to Dr. Wesley Chang, a USC
alumnus, the Trojan Marching Band began
playing the song in the 1972 season. (In fact,
the song itself dates back to only the 19705, so
I guess Mr. Dude needs to adjust his clock by
a few decades.)
1 had contended, per the LSJUMB Web
site, that we had debuted the song at the 1972
Rose Bowl. So, in Chang's words. "... the
Stanford band DID start playing the song be
fore the Trojan Marching Band, but by only
ONF game."
In other words, we played it first, and they
stole it.
The most common argument I read said
that Stanford itself had stolen the song, or that
we do not hold its copyright, or some legalese
like that. Well, from what I know, that's abso
lutely true. However, we are not alone. For
decades, Ohio State's band has taken The Mc-
Coys' 'Hang On Sloopv' as a quasi-official
song. And if some other Big Ten band were to
strike it up, they'd be pilloried out of the
Horseshoe and pelted with fruit.
(I'm not even going to get into the issue of
Script Ohio,' a formation which OSU took
from the Michigan Marching Band, who
themselves originated the on-field band.)

On one serious note, I am very surprised the Pac-10
allows the Trojan Hand to go into other schools' stadi
ums and turn them into a Tribute to Troy jukebox for
four hours.
Part of home-field advantage should be the right to
keep the opposing team's band from taking over the
airspace.
Then again, the conference lets the LSJUMB do all
the things that make them great, pushing (past) the
boundaries of decorum and good taste.
All the cross-college banter reminded me of a story
I once heard. A Stanford student found himself seated
between a Cal student and a US( student on a plane.
The Cal student said, "I'm going to get a Coke."

Have annoying
band, will travel

The Stanford student graciously offered to re
trieve it.and while he was gone, the Cal student spit
in his shoe. When he returned, the USC student said
he would also like a Coke. Again, while he was gone,
the man spit in his shoe.
Upon returning, the Stanford student said. "Why
must we always be divided by the colors we wear?
When are all of these petty games going to stop? All
the spitting in shoes and peeing in Cokes?"
The moral of the story is: Always get your own
drink.

It is a Kafka-esque experience to find that
you have gone from reporting the news
to makingthe news. 1 found myself in just
such a metamorphosis (ha!) last week.
The Double Clutch initiated controversy
with last week's 25 inches. After effusive
praise of USC football, the Trojan Band was
lambasted and accused of theft for their play
ing of 'All Right Now', which, as any Stanford
fan will attest, is "the signature song of the Le
land Stanford Junior University Marching
Band."
USC's band was then called "the most an
noying gang of troubadours in collegiate

sports."
Needless to say, every
one took the time to make
their opinions known.
LSJUMB member and for
mer drum majorette Lori
Karns dismissed it as envy.
"Their unceasing, mediocre
renditions of ARN only
confirm the fact that their
undersexed existence can
only be mitigated by a pa
thetic attempt to emulate the

success of others ... Cal may be our rivals, but
U$C is the enemy."
A letter to The Daily deemed it "piracy"
and called for the USC band to be barred from
Stanford Stadium.
Those e-mailers who were courteous
enough to sign their names (thanks to all one
third of you) were very gracious and polite,
took the time to use punctuation, and ex
pressed their opinions in a manner befitting of
educated students.
A clarification: I did not mean to imply that
USC had rolled out 'All Right Now' strictly
for the Orange Bowl. Many readers pointed
me to the fact that they've played the song for
a good long while. I simply noted that the al
leged pilfering should be all the more offen
sive given that it was the Pac-10 Conference's
finest moment of the year.
Of course, that begs the question: when did
USC start playing the song? One unsigned e
mailer said, and this quote is verbatim, "Dude,
SC has been playing 'All Right Now' for an f'n
century what are you talking about. What are
you a 10 year old?"
