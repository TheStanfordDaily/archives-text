# After sweep, Card host Cal
## Smith making most of homecoming 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Brooke Smith, the wait was worth it.
After transferring to the Farm from Duke Universi
ty and sitting out a year in accordance with NCAA
rules, the 6-foot-3 center is back home, and more im
portantly, back on the court.
The San Anselmo, Calif, native spent four years
rewriting the record books at Marin Catholic High
School — she is still the career leader in points (1,760),
rebounds (1,479), blocked shots (464) and steals (410).
With a glowing high school career like Smith's, the
possibilities were endless, and she headed to Duke to
give those possibilities a try. In her rookie campaign.
Smith averages 3.4 points and 2.5 rebounds per game in
25 appearances for the Blue Devils.
But after one season at Duke, Smith decided to come
home.
"Overall, I made the right choice." Smith said. "I
love my teammates and I love playing in Maples."
She stayed upbeat in her comments about both Duke
and Stanford, recognizing that both had talented bas
ketball programs while also underscoring that Stanford
was the school for her.
"They're pretty similar schools in terms of aca
demics and basketball." Smith said. "They both have re
ally good basketball programs, both in the top 10."
Still, a homecoming is always a good thing.
"It's the Bay Area versus downtown North Carolina,
which was the biggest adjustment for me." Smith said.
"I'm originally from the Bay Area, so it was great to be
back."
Smith was the first player to transfer to Stanford
under head coach Tara VanDerveer's tenure, and
brought with her high hopes for the future.
Upon her arrival VanDerveer remarked, "We are ec
static to have Brooke join our program. She is an out
standing basketball player with a very bright future."

Smith's addition to the team has been integral in the
Cardinal's success this year, as the team has raced to a
13-2 start and a No. 6 ranking.
Smith has led the team in scoring on several occa
sions, including a 22-point effort against then-No. 12
Texas Tech to help secure a thrilling 61-58 win.
"Brooke has been a great addition to our team."
said assistant head coach Amy Tucker. "She gives us a
true post presence, she's a go-to block player with great
post moves. We're running a new offense this year, and
we're kind of running it around her."
Averaging more than 12 points and five rebounds a
game, Smith provides the Cardinal with one of the hard
est things to find: a quick center who can run the floor as
well as bang inside.
Aside from her contributions on the floor. Smith has
had no trouble fitting into the Cardinal basketball fam
ily.
"She's fit in absolutely seamlessly," Tucker said.
"She has a great personality, the kids really enjoy her.
and I think she's having a great time at home because
her mom and stepfather are able to come to all her
home games."
Having settled into her new home in sunny Palo
Alto, Smith is of the same mindset of every other Car
dinal women's basketball player. All personal goals are
set aside for the team goal of winning.
"I just want to do whatever I can to help my team
mates and be a good teammate," Smith said.
With a strong freshman as well as veteran core sur
rounding her. Smith knows that the outside expecta
tions are high.
"Our goal is to get to the Final Four, and work to
ward a National Championship," Smith said. "We're
working toward that everyday, and even though we're
still a ways away, we're improving everyday."
If the Cardinal's recent road sweep of the Arizona
schools was any indication, realizing that goal come
March is a very real possibility.

"Our goal is to get to the Final Four, and work to
ward a National Championship," Smith said. "We're
working toward that everyday, and even though we're
still a ways away, we're improving everyday."
If the Cardinal's recent road sweep of the Arizona
schools was any indication, realizing that goal come
March is a very real possibility.

For Brooke Smith, the wait was worth it.
After transferring to the Farm from Duke Universi
ty and sitting out a year in accordance with NCAA
rules, the 6-foot-3 center is back home, and more im
portantly, back on the court.
The San Anselmo, Calif, native spent four years
rewriting the record books at Marin Catholic High
School — she is still the career leader in points (1,760),
rebounds (1,479), blocked shots (464) and steals (410).
With a glowing high school career like Smith's, the
possibilities were endless, and she headed to Duke to
give those possibilities a try. In her rookie campaign.
Smith averages 3.4 points and 2.5 rebounds per game in
25 appearances for the Blue Devils.
But after one season at Duke, Smith decided to come
home.
"Overall, I made the right choice." Smith said. "I
love my teammates and I love playing in Maples."
She stayed upbeat in her comments about both Duke
and Stanford, recognizing that both had talented bas
ketball programs while also underscoring that Stanford
was the school for her.
"They're pretty similar schools in terms of aca
demics and basketball." Smith said. "They both have re
ally good basketball programs, both in the top 10."
Still, a homecoming is always a good thing.
"It's the Bay Area versus downtown North Carolina,
which was the biggest adjustment for me." Smith said.
"I'm originally from the Bay Area, so it was great to be
back."
Smith was the first player to transfer to Stanford
under head coach Tara VanDerveer's tenure, and
brought with her high hopes for the future.
Upon her arrival VanDerveer remarked, "We are ec
static to have Brooke join our program. She is an out
standing basketball player with a very bright future."

Smith's addition to the team has been integral in the
Cardinal's success this year, as the team has raced to a
13-2 start and a No. 6 ranking.
Smith has led the team in scoring on several occa
sions, including a 22-point effort against then-No. 12
Texas Tech to help secure a thrilling 61-58 win.
"Brooke has been a great addition to our team."
said assistant head coach Amy Tucker. "She gives us a
true post presence, she's a go-to block player with great
post moves. We're running a new offense this year, and
we're kind of running it around her."
Averaging more than 12 points and five rebounds a
game, Smith provides the Cardinal with one of the hard
est things to find: a quick center who can run the floor as
well as bang inside.
Aside from her contributions on the floor. Smith has
had no trouble fitting into the Cardinal basketball fam
ily.
"She's fit in absolutely seamlessly," Tucker said.
"She has a great personality, the kids really enjoy her.
and I think she's having a great time at home because
her mom and stepfather are able to come to all her
home games."
Having settled into her new home in sunny Palo
Alto, Smith is of the same mindset of every other Car
dinal women's basketball player. All personal goals are
set aside for the team goal of winning.
"I just want to do whatever I can to help my team
mates and be a good teammate," Smith said.
With a strong freshman as well as veteran core sur
rounding her. Smith knows that the outside expecta
tions are high.
"Our goal is to get to the Final Four, and work to
ward a National Championship," Smith said. "We're
working toward that everyday, and even though we're
still a ways away, we're improving everyday."
