# No. 6 Stanford looks to avoid letdown at home
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Trap Game n. a contest in which a
stronger team is unusually susceptible to
defeat by a weaker team, esp. when due to
emotional letdown from previous games
or looking ahead to stronger opponent in
a later game (see California at No. 6 Stan
ford today).

After an im
pressive desert
sweep of then-No.
24 Arizona State
and Arizona last
weekend, the Car
dinal women re
turn home and
welcome the
Golden Bears to
Maples Pavilion
for the latest in
what has been a
very lopsided se
ries.
For the past 10
years, Cal-Stan
ford has ceased to
be a rivalry in any
meaningful sense
of the word. Since
1994, a span of 24
games, the Bears
have claimed vic
tory just once, and
the Cardinal are
currently riding an
eight-game win
ning streak against

its neighbor across the bay.
Despite the history, however, today's
game presents a classic opportunity for an
upset.
Not only is Stanford coming off a phys
ically and mentally draining road trip to
Arizona, but it also has reason to look past
today's tilt with Cat to what will figures to
be a more demanding test against No. 14
Boston College on Saturday.
Nonetheless, assistant coach C'harmin
Smith insists it won't happen.
"The Stanford-Cal game is always
something that people are fired up
about," Smith said. "They'll come out and
give us their best effort, and they're a pret
ty good team, so we've got to be prepared
to play every night."
Given the Cardinal's recent perfor
mance, it's tough not to like their chances.
In Tempe, Ariz., the Stanford offense
became just the second on the year to
score more than 63 points against the Sun
Devils in a 68-57 victory. The Cardinal fol
lowed that up by snapping Arizona's na
tion-leading 34-game home winning
streak and hanging 78 points on the Wild
cats, the second-highest total they have
surrendered this year.
What has the Cardinal offense clicking
so well?
On a team full of talented upperclass
men, the biggest offensive constant has
been freshman sensation Candice Wiggins.
Wiggins leads the team in scoring with
17.2 points per game. At the offensive end
of the court, she has shown both the abili
ty to slash to the basket and the willing
ness to pull up and knock down the mid
range jump shot.
At the defensive end, she has started
Stanford's offensive possessions early
