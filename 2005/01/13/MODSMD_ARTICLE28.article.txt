# No. 6 Stanford looks to avoid letdown at home
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Trap Game n. a contest in which a
stronger team is unusually susceptible to
defeat by a weaker team, esp. when due to
emotional letdown from previous games
or looking ahead to stronger opponent in
a later game (see California at No. 6 Stan
ford today).

After an im
pressive desert
sweep of then-No.
24 Arizona State
and Arizona last
weekend, the Car
dinal women re
turn home and
welcome the
Golden Bears to
Maples Pavilion
for the latest in
what has been a
very lopsided se
ries.
For the past 10
years, Cal-Stan
ford has ceased to
be a rivalry in any
meaningful sense
of the word. Since
1994, a span of 24
games, the Bears
have claimed vic
tory just once, and
the Cardinal are
currently riding an
eight-game win
ning streak against

its neighbor across the bay.
Despite the history, however, today's
game presents a classic opportunity for an
upset.
Not only is Stanford coming off a phys
ically and mentally draining road trip to
Arizona, but it also has reason to look past
today's tilt with Cat to what will figures to
be a more demanding test against No. 14
Boston College on Saturday.
Nonetheless, assistant coach C'harmin
Smith insists it won't happen.
"The Stanford-Cal game is always
something that people are fired up
about," Smith said. "They'll come out and
give us their best effort, and they're a pret
ty good team, so we've got to be prepared
to play every night."
Given the Cardinal's recent perfor
mance, it's tough not to like their chances.
In Tempe, Ariz., the Stanford offense
became just the second on the year to
score more than 63 points against the Sun
Devils in a 68-57 victory. The Cardinal fol
lowed that up by snapping Arizona's na
tion-leading 34-game home winning
streak and hanging 78 points on the Wild
cats, the second-highest total they have
surrendered this year.
What has the Cardinal offense clicking
so well?
On a team full of talented upperclass
men, the biggest offensive constant has
been freshman sensation Candice Wiggins.
Wiggins leads the team in scoring with
17.2 points per game. At the offensive end
of the court, she has shown both the abili
ty to slash to the basket and the willing
ness to pull up and knock down the mid
range jump shot.
At the defensive end, she has started
Stanford's offensive possessions early

with tough defense that is producing
2.7 steals per game in conference
play.
Yet, Stanford's biggest advan
tage in tonight's game against Cal
may be depth. Wiggins, senior Kel
ley Suminski and junior Brooke
Smith are all scoring in double digits,
and VanDerveer's rotation includes
nine players averaging double-digit
minutes this season.
As a result, no player on this
year's Cardinal team is averaging
as many as 30 minutes per game, in
contrast to the previous campaign,
in which both Suminski and Nicole
Powell topped the 30-minute
mark.
What must Oski's troops do to
steal a victory at Maples?
The Golden Bears will look to
four-year starters Leigh Gregory
and Kristin Iwanaga for leadership.
With the departure of All-Pac-10
guard Nihan Anaz, Cal will need
Gregory and Iwanaga to step up and

Depth should make
Card tough to beat

fill the scoring void left behind on
the offensive end.
But scoring will he tough inside,
as Stanford's zone defense has been
extremely effective in shutting
down the conference's best post
players, including Arizona's
Shawntinice Polk (12 points) and
Arizona State's Kristin Kovesdy
(six points).
This will put pressure on Gregory
and Iwanaga, who both have the
ability to hit the outside shot, to take
advantage of any open looks that the
Cardinal afford them.
"They're shooting the [three
point shot] really well right now."
Smith said. "Gregory's their leading
scorer right now. and she's got some
nice [inside] moves too. so we're
going to have to get good play from
our post defenders.'
With Stanford on offense. Cal's
inside players will once again draw a
difficult matchup. In its triangle of
fense. the Cardinal will likely try to

get the ball to its towering trio of
Smith, senior T'Nae Thiel and
sophomore Kristen Newlin.
Against Washington, the group
combined for 35 points and 26 re
bounds, as both Smith and Newlin
recorded double-doubles.
"We always want to establish our
low-post game and get the ball in
side," Smith said. "But they like to
pressure the ball a lot. so it's going to
be a challenge for us to handle the
pressure, similar to what we did
against Arizona State."
Even if the Bears are up to the
task inside, they will still need to
find an answer for Stanford's
guards and Wiggins in particular,
something nobody in the Pac-10
has done yet.
Though the stage is set in theory
for an upset. VanDerveer's team
seems to be stocked with too much
talent and with veterans who will
make sure Stanford's Bay Area
dominance continues.

inside players will once again draw a
difficult matchup. In its triangle of
fense. the Cardinal will likely try to

get the ball to its towering trio of
Smith, senior T'Nae Thiel and
sophomore Kristen Newlin.
Against Washington, the group
combined for 35 points and 26 re
bounds, as both Smith and Newlin
recorded double-doubles.
"We always want to establish our
low-post game and get the ball in
side," Smith said. "But they like to
pressure the ball a lot. so it's going to
be a challenge for us to handle the
pressure, similar to what we did
against Arizona State."
Even if the Bears are up to the
task inside, they will still need to
find an answer for Stanford's
guards and Wiggins in particular,
something nobody in the Pac-10
has done yet.
Though the stage is set in theory
for an upset. VanDerveer's team
seems to be stocked with too much
talent and with veterans who will
make sure Stanford's Bay Area
dominance continues.
Trap Game n. a contest in which a
stronger team is unusually susceptible to
defeat by a weaker team, esp. when due to
emotional letdown from previous games
or looking ahead to stronger opponent in
a later game (see California at No. 6 Stan
ford today).

After an im
pressive desert
sweep of then-No.
24 Arizona State
and Arizona last
weekend, the Car
dinal women re
turn home and
welcome the
Golden Bears to
Maples Pavilion
for the latest in
what has been a
very lopsided se
ries.
For the past 10
years, Cal-Stan
ford has ceased to
be a rivalry in any
meaningful sense
of the word. Since
1994, a span of 24
games, the Bears
have claimed vic
tory just once, and
the Cardinal are
currently riding an
eight-game win
ning streak against

its neighbor across the bay.
Despite the history, however, today's
game presents a classic opportunity for an
upset.
Not only is Stanford coming off a phys
ically and mentally draining road trip to
Arizona, but it also has reason to look past
today's tilt with Cat to what will figures to
be a more demanding test against No. 14
Boston College on Saturday.
Nonetheless, assistant coach C'harmin
Smith insists it won't happen.
"The Stanford-Cal game is always
something that people are fired up
about," Smith said. "They'll come out and
give us their best effort, and they're a pret
ty good team, so we've got to be prepared
to play every night."
Given the Cardinal's recent perfor
mance, it's tough not to like their chances.
In Tempe, Ariz., the Stanford offense
became just the second on the year to
score more than 63 points against the Sun
Devils in a 68-57 victory. The Cardinal fol
lowed that up by snapping Arizona's na
tion-leading 34-game home winning
streak and hanging 78 points on the Wild
cats, the second-highest total they have
surrendered this year.
What has the Cardinal offense clicking
so well?
On a team full of talented upperclass
men, the biggest offensive constant has
been freshman sensation Candice Wiggins.
Wiggins leads the team in scoring with
17.2 points per game. At the offensive end
of the court, she has shown both the abili
ty to slash to the basket and the willing
ness to pull up and knock down the mid
range jump shot.
At the defensive end, she has started
Stanford's offensive possessions early

with tough defense that is producing
2.7 steals per game in conference
play.
Yet, Stanford's biggest advan
tage in tonight's game against Cal
may be depth. Wiggins, senior Kel
ley Suminski and junior Brooke
Smith are all scoring in double digits,
and VanDerveer's rotation includes
nine players averaging double-digit
minutes this season.
As a result, no player on this
year's Cardinal team is averaging
as many as 30 minutes per game, in
contrast to the previous campaign,
in which both Suminski and Nicole
Powell topped the 30-minute
mark.
What must Oski's troops do to
steal a victory at Maples?
The Golden Bears will look to
four-year starters Leigh Gregory
and Kristin Iwanaga for leadership.
With the departure of All-Pac-10
guard Nihan Anaz, Cal will need
Gregory and Iwanaga to step up and

Depth should make
Card tough to beat

fill the scoring void left behind on
the offensive end.
But scoring will he tough inside,
as Stanford's zone defense has been
extremely effective in shutting
down the conference's best post
players, including Arizona's
Shawntinice Polk (12 points) and
Arizona State's Kristin Kovesdy
(six points).
This will put pressure on Gregory
and Iwanaga, who both have the
ability to hit the outside shot, to take
advantage of any open looks that the
Cardinal afford them.
"They're shooting the [three
point shot] really well right now."
Smith said. "Gregory's their leading
scorer right now. and she's got some
nice [inside] moves too. so we're
going to have to get good play from
our post defenders.'
