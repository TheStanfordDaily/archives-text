# SLAC shut down by feds
## Dept. of Energy finds unsafe procedures at accelerator center 
### ERIK HOPE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, also known as SLAC, has
shut down its accelerators indefinite
ly after a Department of Energy
safety report that determined
SLAC's operating procedures are
unsafe. University President John
Hennessy announced yesterday that
he has appointed a panel to investi
gate the safety procedures at SLAC.
The report, released on Dec. 15,
criticized SLAC for disregarding
safety regulations in order to contin
ue producing scientific results.
According to the Department of
Energy report, SLAC's unsafe oper

ating procedures were directly re
sponsible fora fire that occurred on
Oct. 11.
"Unsafe conditions have become
a part of the everyday of doing busi
ness," said the report, according to
an article in Science Magazine. "It
appears that SLAC has consistently
placed operations ahead of safety."
Director of the Office of Commu
nication at SLAC Neil Calder said
that SLAC respects the work that
DOE did to prepare the report.
"The findings of the report are
what the investigation committee
found," Calder said. "We respect
that."
The Department of Energy's Of
fice of Environment, Safety and
Health initiated the investigation au
tomatically because of the fire,
which occurred when an electrician
tried to do maintenance work on a
480-volt power panel without shut
ting off power.

Changing circuits without first
shutting off power is known as "hot
work" and requires specific equip
ment and a license, neither of which
the technician or his supervisor had
obtained. The resulting explosion se
verely burned the technician, who
was hospitalized.
SLAC and the Department of
Energy launched the investigation
jointly immediately following the ac
cident, Calder said, adding that
SLAC also closed its accelerators on
its own immediately following the
accident. In addition to the immedi
ate closure, all SLAC staff had to
complete an extensive safety review.
"At SLAC and all DOE labs,
safety comes first," Calder said.
"Everybody's aim in this is to make
sure that SLAC is a safe place to
work."
SLAC's accelerators, including
its PEP-II collider and Ba√üar detec
tor, will be closed until at least mid-

February, when a joint committee of
Department of Energy and SLAC
personnel must submit a Corrective
Action Plan. That may or may not be
the last step before SLAC can begin
operating again.
Hennessy has also established a
committee of experts from within
and outside Stanford to review safe
ty procedures at SLAC. This "Blue
Ribbon Committee" will investigate
independently of the DOE and pro
pose its own reforms.
"At the moment it's impossible to
give a firm date for the switch-on of
the accelerator," Calder said.
David Simon, the electrician that
suffered second- and third-degree
burns during the fire, and his wife are
suing the center, charging that
SLAC scientists were negligent
when they asked him to make re
pairs on a live electrical panel.
