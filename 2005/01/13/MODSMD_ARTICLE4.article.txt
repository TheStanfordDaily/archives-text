# GSC debates tsunami relief
## 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The newly formed umbrella organization
Stanford Students for Relief, a coalition of
about 20 campus groups, kicked off its drive for
donations for the tsunami relief effort with an
appeal to the Graduate Student Council last
night at the GSC meeting. Although no imme
diate headway was made, SSR expressed opti
mism in its overall goal of pooling $10(),()00 to
donate to Save the Children.
After 30 seconds of silence to remember the
victims of the Indian Ocean tsunamis, the GSC
discussed the possibility of a donation to SSR,
although monetary amounts were not men
tioned and immediate opposition arose.
"It doesn't make sense to give money to a
specific group," said John Davis, the funding
committee chair. "I would have a moral and
ethical problem with that."
"Using student money fora group like
SSR] is not really the intention with which that
money is collected," GSC chair Moriah
Thomason said.
Medical student and SSR co-chair Gabriel
Brat stressed that the GSC, whether or not it
chooses to donate directly, should coordinate
its fundraising activities with SSR, whose over
arching purpose is to focus the philanthropic ef
forts of groups across campus.
"Instead of doing our own little thing, we use
the strength of the whole group," Brat said.

"We're coordinating everything so that we can
build a large pot of money that can then be do
nated to [Save the Children]."
Some GSC members were wary of getting
GSC funds mixed in with undergraduate events
and initiatives.
"We don't fund undergraduate events,"
Chair Moriah Thomason said. "There can be a
mix [between undergraduates and graduates],
but it needs to be heavily skewed towards grad
uates."
The GSC turned toward independent initia
tives and formed an internal sub-committee to
look at the possibility of graduate-focused
fundraising efforts.
"I don't think it's a problem," Brat said, ad
dressing the GSC's independent-minded ef
forts. "The goal is that everybody gets involved
however they see fit. In the end, we're all work
ing to try to improve the situation over there."
To that end, SRR has already planned sev
eral events to meet their $100,000 goal in the
next three weeks. Members will be tabling in
White Plaza everyday to solicit donations and
they'll also be approaching individual dorms
for funds.
A few specific activities are in the early plan
ning stages, including a dance at the Graduate
Community Center, where entrance fees will
go to Save the Children.
"I believe that we're going to meet (our
goal]," Brat said. "In fact, I think we'll surpass
it."
