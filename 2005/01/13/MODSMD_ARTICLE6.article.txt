### MEGAN WATKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Law School has received a gift of S3
million from the John M. Olin Foundation to fund
student and faculty research and seminars about
the intersection of economics and law.
According to A. Mitchell Polinsky, the direc
tor of Stanford's John M. Olin Program in Law
and Economics, the relationship between the Law
School and the foundation began in 1987 when
the University heard about money available to
develop new programs. Since then, Stanford has
received $8.3 million.
"In the mid-1980s, the foundation decided that
they wanted to influence public policy by provid
ing funding for research on economic analysis,"
he said in an interview with The Daily.
Polinsky also said in a press release that the re
lationship between the Stanford and the founda
tion has been mutually beneficial.
"The foundation's generosity to Stanford has.
furthered both the mission of the foundation to
establish the field of law and economics and the
academic goals of the school," he said. "Under
standing the relationship between law and eco
nomics helps lawyers and policymakers think
more clearly about the problems they work on. It
helps them avoid designing laws that are ineffi
cient and lower the welfare of society."
The program has brought 135 scholars to cam-

and faculty research grants.
In an interview with The Daily,

community has benefited from the

a University-wide program housed
in the Law School."
He added that over half of the

search come from outside the Law
School.
In the press release, James Piere
son. the executive director of the

was excitcd about Stanford's in
volvement.

program in law and economics,
which has also benefited greatly
from Mitch Polinsky's energetic and
thoughtful direction. Together they
