'How Teaching Sophomore
College Changed My Life"
When I agreed in 1998 to teach
a Sophomore College course on
US foreign policy, I expected the
class to have an impact on the
students. I hope that it has.
It certainly has had an impact
on me. The transformative effects
of Sophomore College will be the
focus of my remarks.
