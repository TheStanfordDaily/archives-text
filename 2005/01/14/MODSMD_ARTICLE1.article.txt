# 'Rage' Play Brings to Life Rosa Parks' Memory, Message
## 
### JESSICA ZHANG 
Three wooden chairs, seven scat
tered pairs of women's shoes and a
jar of coins served as the only props
to last evening's one-woman drama
"Rage Is Not a 1-Day Thing."
Awele Makeba — an award-win
ning actor, playwright, storyteller,
recording artist and educator — pre
sented her latest work to students,
researchers of the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Papers Project and commu
nity members at Tresidder Oak
Lounge last night.
Told primarily through the voice
of then-15-year-old Claudette
Colvin, a high school student who re
fused to give up her seat on a Mont
gomery public bus 274 days before
Rosa Parks became famous for the
same act, Makeba's drama also in
cluded the oral histories of 12 other
influential, yet little-known,
African-American female freedom
fighters during the Civil Rights
Movement.
Colvin was also present in the au
dience and answered questions fol
lowing the performance.
Makeba is not a stranger to Stan
ford's campus. Clayborne Carson,
professor of history and senior edi
tor of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Pa
pers Project, "has invited her to his

Introduction to the African Ameri
can Freedom Struggle class numer
ous times, and the students therein
always found her performance to be
as informative as it is moving," ac
cording to Stewart Walker, a re
search assistant at the King Papers
Project.
" This year marks the 50th an
niversary of the Montgomery bus
boycott, and we did not fora mo
ment doubt that we wanted to have
Awele's one-woman show headline
one of the evenings of the King holi
day schedule," Walker said.
"Additionally, the fact that Ms.
Claudette Colvin agreed to join us
for the evening sealed the deal," he
said. "We hope the audience at this
evening's performance comes away
with a profoundly altered vision of
the Montgomery bus boycott story
and a keener understanding that the
history we learn in school often
leaves out the rich and vital role
played by 'ordinary' and 'powerless'
people."
In his welcoming introduction,
Carson said, "Claudette Colvin
didn't get into history books, so it is
particularly important on the King
holiday to do something to recog
nize her."
