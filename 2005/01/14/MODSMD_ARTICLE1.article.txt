# 'Rage' Play Brings to Life Rosa Parks' Memory, Message
## 
### JESSICA ZHANG 
Three wooden chairs, seven scat
tered pairs of women's shoes and a
jar of coins served as the only props
to last evening's one-woman drama
"Rage Is Not a 1-Day Thing."
Awele Makeba — an award-win
ning actor, playwright, storyteller,
recording artist and educator — pre
sented her latest work to students,
researchers of the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Papers Project and commu
nity members at Tresidder Oak
Lounge last night.
Told primarily through the voice
of then-15-year-old Claudette
Colvin, a high school student who re
fused to give up her seat on a Mont
gomery public bus 274 days before
Rosa Parks became famous for the
same act, Makeba's drama also in
cluded the oral histories of 12 other
influential, yet little-known,
African-American female freedom
fighters during the Civil Rights
Movement.
Colvin was also present in the au
dience and answered questions fol
lowing the performance.
Makeba is not a stranger to Stan
ford's campus. Clayborne Carson,
professor of history and senior edi
tor of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Pa
pers Project, "has invited her to his

Introduction to the African Ameri
can Freedom Struggle class numer
ous times, and the students therein
always found her performance to be
as informative as it is moving," ac
cording to Stewart Walker, a re
search assistant at the King Papers
Project.
" This year marks the 50th an
niversary of the Montgomery bus
boycott, and we did not fora mo
ment doubt that we wanted to have
Awele's one-woman show headline
one of the evenings of the King holi
day schedule," Walker said.
"Additionally, the fact that Ms.
Claudette Colvin agreed to join us
for the evening sealed the deal," he
said. "We hope the audience at this
evening's performance comes away
with a profoundly altered vision of
the Montgomery bus boycott story
and a keener understanding that the
history we learn in school often
leaves out the rich and vital role
played by 'ordinary' and 'powerless'
people."
In his welcoming introduction,
Carson said, "Claudette Colvin
didn't get into history books, so it is
particularly important on the King
holiday to do something to recog
nize her."

The solo actress of "Rage Is Not a 1 Day Thing" depicts Rosa Parks.
Makeba's play unfolded as she re
told, in first-person narration, the ex
periences of 13 characters, including
Colvin, 18-year-old Mary Louise
Smith, who also refused to give up
her seat on a public bus, JoAnn
Robinson, president of the Women's
Political Council, and Rosa Parks,
NAACP youth council coordinator
and secretary.
Powerful rhetoric helped to de
velop the poignant themes of segre
gation and the characters' struggle
for justice.
"Stay black and die — segrega
tion kills black people," Makeba, as
Colvin, repeated throughout the
drama. Colvin's character, after
being threatened by the bus driver,
replied timidly, "It is my Constitu
tional right to sit here 1 . I refuse to be
treated like a second-class citizen."
After the incident, Colvin was os
tracized by classmates despite fur
ther attempts to organize others to
make a difference.
"1 don't want to be a bystander,"
»She said.
The drama also revealed the be
hind-the-scenes work of the Mont
gomery bus boycott. Fifty thousand
people boycotted buses while 500
people protested Parks' arrest out

side of the Montgomery courthouse.
Carpools were organized and dri
ving routes were planned with more
than 80 pick-up and drop-off stations
throughout Montgomery.
Following her one-woman
drama. Makeba spoke about what
inspired her to write this play.
"I read a book that contained the
oral histories of 15- to 18-year-olds
who lived during the Civil Rights
Movement," Makeba said. "I began
to use those stories about how peo
ple who faced adversity could have
drowned, but instead changed soci
ety and helped to be part of the
change in the world. Colvin's story,
in particular, was speaking to my
soul."
Colvin recounted the influence of
a high school teacher who chal
lenged her to think about what it
meant to be "American." Makeba, a
first grade teacher, concurred, ac
knowledging teachers as the
"change agents in the world."
Colvin fielded questions about
her refusal to give up her seat.
"It wasn't planned," she said. "It
was impulsive. Segregation doesn't
just happen one day. You deal with
segregation and Jim Crow laws
everyday. I felt the spirits of So-

Playwright inspired by
Civil Rights figures

journer Truth and Harriet Tubman,
and I was glued to the seat."
Having her experience narrated
by Makeba has affected Colvin
greatly.
"It helped me come out of this
shell and it gave me the recognition I
never got. When the story about me
came out in USA Today, I thought I
would get some response from the
black community. The organizations
looked for an icon and they thought
Rosa Parks would be their icon,"
Colvin said.
Many audience members said they
were touched by the performance.
"It made the experience much
more moving," said Chris Duffield, a
visiting scholar at the Stanford Med
ical School. "I felt so moved and she
made it so real for me — more than
it's ever been. I felt lucky to be here,"
Nia Taylor, a visiting student from
the University of Massachusetts, re
marked on Makeba's mode of ex
pression.
"It was engaging. It wasn't just
normal historical text. It was outgo
ing, very different."
"Younger people forget about the
Civil Rights Movement, but what we
gained, we gained through blood
and tears," Colvin said.
