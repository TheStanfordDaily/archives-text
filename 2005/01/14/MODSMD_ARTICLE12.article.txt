# Cho trounces Penguin for Daily EIC
## 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN PENGUIN SYMPATHIZER 
"It felt below zero, so I thought
that should have been a good sign,"
said Daily editor-in-chief candidate
Jules R. Penguin, who had just re
turned from doing the slip-n-slide on
the icy FloMo catwalk.
But the Antarctic temperatures
in the newspaper's office yesterday n
due to a mysteriously timed heating
system failure n were not enough to
propel Penguin to victory. He fell to
the shivering, parka-clad Managing
Editor of News Cynthia Cho, a se
nior, 46-3.
"I upped it by one vote over last
election," Penguin proudly noted.
"Given the 50 percent growth in my
vote total over the last vote and the
anticipated growth in my vote share
in future cycles, 1 should have had a
mandate by 2012."
Despite chattering teeth, Cho
managed to congratulate Penguin on
a spirited campaign.
"He really gave it his all," she said. "I
especially thought his decision to

abandon former campaign manager
Brendan Marten was a good move
on his part. I'm hoping we'll all be
able to work together to bring The
Daily to new heights of journalism
this volume."
Penguin hired on current Daily
Editor-in-Chief Will Oremus in Oc
tober after what was widely regard
ed as a weak campaign effort headed
by Marten last spring.
"Jhe problem last spring for Pen
guin was the morality card," said
Marten, managing editor of Special
Sections and a senior. "Given Pen
guin's sketchy escapades, Oremus
just played better with the values
voters. And that wasn't something
under my control."
Upon hearing the results, Cho at
first shrieked uncontrollably, shout
ing "Oh my God, oh my God."
She then retired to the News of
fice to renew her "networking" ef
forts, promptly shooting off e-mails
to recruiters from the Wall Street
Journal, Washington Post, Maxim
and The New York Times.
"1 just wanted to touch base,"

Cho said.
While most regarded the election
as problem-free, a few Daily staffers
were outraged, citing irregularities
encountered while at the voting
booth.
"I didn't even get to vote," said
Intermission Editor Tam Vo. a ju
nior and Penguin sympathizer. "I
never received the voting e-mail.
Are you trying to oppress me? I'm
getting The Chappie on this."
Former Daily staffer and senior
Mikev Lee, whose campaign victory
in last year's ASSU presidential
election was overturned by the Un
dergraduate Senate on accusations
of "abuse of power," offered his
thoughts on the election imbroglio.
"Cynthia might think her victory
is safe," Lee said, "but just wait until
the special election."
However, most staffers were en
thusiastic about Cho's success at the
polls.
"I can't wait to work under her
another volume," said News Editor
David Herbert, a sophomore. "I just
can't get enough."
