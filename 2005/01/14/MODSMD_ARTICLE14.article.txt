## Stanford kids are ugly 
### 
Erin broke her too-big
schnoz by smashing it into
the bulkhead of the pool.
Now she looks stupid. And
she feels pretty stupid, too.
Apparently we still have to write a
column. Here goes.
Newly demoted to the ranks of
the "ugly people," Erin felt herself
compelled to scan the campus
crowds for camaraderie on her first
class venture. What she found was
rather comforting: all you guys are
ugly, too. In fact, she felt fairly cer
tain that she was not the ugliest one
around. And the rest of you don't
even have multiple facial fractures.
You may be asking yourselves,
"Are our

columnists
really this
conceited /
delusion
al?" The
answer is
no. We're
not delu
sion a 1 ,
we're
RIGHT.
This is a
gripe that
we've got
ten from all

of you at
one time or another. We've heard
this complaint all over campus,
from both males and females. We're
just the only ones who have the tes
ticles to teli you that you're ugly to
your face.
Take heart. You are not nearly as
ugly as Harvard kids, and compared
to the ones at CalTech you're prom
queens. But still, you're pretty not
so-nice to look at.
To recap: Stanford kids are ugly.
Now let's talk about what we can
do to reduce the number of ugly
kids we have to date. The only rea
sonable options we've come up with
are Foothill, Santa Cruz, UC Davis,
Menlo College, Santa Clara...do
you understand yet that these are
all colleges OTHER than Stanford?
Good.
You may be one of those lucky
devils who held onto your high
school significant other in anticipa
tion of Stanford's ugliness. On any
other day, we'd call you something
appropriately disparaging. But
since Erin became ugly, we've come
to understand that you didn't stay
with your high school sweetheart
out of sheer terror and social inepti
tude, but rather an innate under
standing of the inverse relationship
between intelligence and beauty.
Or maybe you met a poor lost
Santa Clara chick at a frat party and
used the innate intelligence that
God granted you in exchange for
any physical appeal to befuddle her
into going home with you. Well
done, sir! Now all you have to do is
hold onto her until you graduate.
We've heard that the pickin's are
much less slim in the metropolitan
communities you'll likely be head
ing to after college.
While driving to see a long-dis
tance lover may at first seem a
deterrent, we urge you to reconsid
er. That UCLA chess team All Star
you met the other weekend is worth
the $5,834 you'll spend buying gas
to get to him. You could pretend it's
a tuition hike and try to get it from
your parents or the Financial Aid
Office. Or create a research project
on the effect of the chess team's
performance on your libido and hit
up the IJRP. We've heard they don't
read those grant proposals too
closely.
If none of this works, you can
look inside, since supposedly that's
what counts most.
Otherwise, since all of this is sup
posed to be in the eye of the
beholder, you could get LASIK sur
gery. But only from someone who's
not accredited by the National
Association of LASIK Eye Surgery
Accreditors. Or you can get it from
from someone who's drunk.

Have an ugly boy friend and a laser?
