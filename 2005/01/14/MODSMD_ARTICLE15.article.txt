# Social buzz: Ten bars reviewed
## 
### 
2. Blue Chalk
Cafe
Where: Across
from City Hall
in downtown
PA, a block
south of
University
Drive on
Ramona St.

Signature drink: The Blue Chalk
Lemonade, whose mixture of SoCo, blue
curacao, lemonade, sweet and sour, and
soda will get you ready for the evening.
Runs around $7.
Food: It's "eclectic," says Stacy Piza, who
organizes private parties at the CafE.
"Some Southwest, some pub food." Her
favorite? "I like the grilled chicken with
garlic mashed potatoes."

Atmosphere: The
only place in da
PA with two dis
tinct bars, bil
liards, shuffle
board and dining
area.
Why come? A DJ
spins every

Wednesday and i-riday, and live oands
play Thursday. (8.W.5.)
3. The Nuthouse
Where: On California Ave., in downtown
PA.
Signature drink: The Worston Apple,
made with Crown Royale, Apple Plucker
and sweet and sour. Costs you 5 bucks.
Food: The kitchen's been leased out to a
local taqueri'a, so the fare is mostly
Mexican, with an occasional hamburger
thrown in.
Atmosphere: "Crazy." Four pool tables,
foosball, pinball machines, 13 TVs and

arcade games litter the
peanut-strewn floor.
Why come? Probably
for the above-men
tioned craziness, and the
laid-back "Animal
House" atmosphere.
(8.W.5.)
4. The British Bankers
Club (BBC)

Where: 1090 El Camino, at the corner of
Santa Cruz Ave. in Menlo Park.
History: Serving spirits to the lower Bay
Area since 1976, the building formerly
housed a bank, then city hall, then a
police department and the jail and final
ly a library.
Signature drink: "Our martinis are really,
really good," says Ryan Bleyle, a manag
er at the BBC.Try the Belvedere martini,
if you don't mind forking $8.50.
Food: A change of ownership last August
brought a whole new menu, which focus
es now on California bistro cuisine and
includes steaks, salads and pasta. A din
ing area downstairs gets converted into a
nightclub later in the evening, but food's
always available upstairs.
Atmosphere: New management also
brought with it new carpet, paint, TVs
and furniture. As always, its high, tall ceil
ings give it an airy feel and dwarf the big
screen TVs that are available to watch
sporting events.
Why come? Wednesday is the hip 20-
something night, but it's also the only
night they charge a cover ($5). Karaoke
night on Thursday is getting increasingly
popular. Fridays and Saturdays features
house spinmeister DJ Lucky, who mixes
it up between hip-hop and 80's and other
genre, and Sunday night is acoustic night,
where local artists — often from

Stanford — play
from 9 p.m. to mid
night. (8.W.5.)
5. The Oasis Beer
Garden (aka the
Oasis)
Where: 241 El
Camino Real,
Menlo Park

Atmosphere: The Oasis has a casual inte
rior, with floors covered in peanut shells
and wooden surfaces full of carved ini
tials.
Why Come? Stanford students have
flocked to the Oasis for decades to get
good burgers, pizza, wings and pitchers
and to watch Cardinal athletics on T.V.
Although they serve pear cider and
Mike's Hard Lemonade, there is neither
wine nor hard liquor, so most people just
order beer.
Testimonials: "The Oasis has an old
town, college feel." said junior Vincent
Gonzales, 'it looks cool because people
carved their initials into the wooden
walls, and the food is really good — espe
cially the chicken tenders."
"The atmosphere is much more
homey and less swanky at Oasis, due in
large part to the dark wood tables," said
senior Lauren Kramer. "The beer selec-

tions are adequate,
although they stock
only the standard
beers." (Katie
Bearman)
6. Gordon Biersch
Where: 650 Emerson
Street, Palo Alto
Atmosphere: Gordon
Biersch has brewery
restaurants from
Hawaii to Florida.

While the Palo Alto location is dimly lit,
it still feels more like a restaurant than a
bar. The organization of space can
accommodate large groups of people.
Why Come? This place is a well-known
chain that has its own brewery and serves
a wide variety of beer. Unlike many bars,
it also serves full, quality meals.
Testimonials: "People don't really go
here just to drink," said senior Joey
Natoli.'Tt is a fun place fora decent din
ner and an extensive beer menu.

However, the food isn't college-student
wallet-friendly."
"Their original brews are good, but it
is really loud," said senior Hanna Asrat.
"It makes it hard to have conversations."
(K-B.)

7. La Bodeguita del
Medio
Where:
463 California Avenue,
Palo Alto
Atmosphere: La
Bodeguita del Medio
has a Cuban theme and
has three separate
areas: a bar, a restau
rant and a smoke-

room. It is slightly on the fancy and
expensive side, with dim lighting, original
Cuban artwork and lively music.
Why come? This restaurant has amazing
Cuban food with tropical influence, and a
diverse menu of cocktails, shots, wines
and beers. People rave about the mojito
(a drink made with Bacardi limon rum,
mint, sugar, citrus juice and soda) and the
Hemingway Cocktail (Bacardi limon
rum, maraschino liquor, citrus juice and
sugar, served in a martini glass with a
sugar-coated rim).
Testimonials: "The oyster shooters at La
Bodeguita are super spicy and my dream
come true," said co-term Visra Vichit-
Vadakan.
"If you are going for the Cuban cui
sine, it is less than stellar," said senior
Ellen Crisham. "However, the mojitos
are a perfect compliment to the cigar
smoking area in the back." (K. 8.)
8. The Dutch Goose:
Where:
3567 Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo Park
Atmosphere: This place has wooden
booths and floors, as well as an outdoor
area, giving it a rustic, casual feel. There
is also a pool table and a large room in
the back equipped with long picnic
tables, making it a great space for playing
drinking games. Unlike F&A and Nola's,
The Dutch Goose does not have live
music.
Why come: Visit this restaurant / bar if
you want to try specialty beers (Dutch
Goose does not serve mixed drinks),
drink in a non-smoking atmosphere... or

try their
famous deviled
eggs.
Testimonials:
"The one good
thing I would
say about it is
that the large

room in the back holds enough tables to
entertain rowdy kids just dying to play
beirut or flip-cup off campus," said Sage
Hyman, an Anthropological Sciences co
term. (K. 8.)
9. Fanny and Alexander's (F&A)
Where:
412 Emerson Avenue, downtown PA
Atmosphere: There are two bar rooms

inside and one out
side (during the
summer). Even if it
is crowded, it does
not usually take long
to get a drink.
Additionally, F&A
frequently hires live
bands.
Why go? F&A
serves a wide variety
of mixed drinks and

is often the bar of choice for Senior Pub
Night. If you want to start pre-gaming
ridiculously early, happy hour is from 4-
6:30 p.m. — beers for three dollars.
Testimonials: "F&A is arguably the best
bar in downtown Palo Alto," Natoli said.
"The size inside and out allows for danc
ing and mingling, and the bartenders
seem to know how to make every drink
possible."
"My friend said that F&A is her
favorite place to go for Senior Pub
Nights," said senior Amelia DeLaPaz.

(K. 8.)
10. Nola's
Where:
535 Ramona Street,
downtown PA
Atmosphere:
Nola's is described as
fun, lively and colorful,
with a
California / Creole /
Caribbean feel. There

are multiple rooms, as well as an outdoor
Catio, and sometimes Nola's hires live
ands. Nola's has been open for about six
years, and according to the manager, it
has always been full of Stanford people.
Why go? If you want to bar hop, Nola's
should be on your list, because it is near
many other downtown Palo Alto bars.
Many praise the food at the restaurant
that, like its atmosphere, mixes
California, Creole and Caribbean ele
ments. Try the famous New Orleans
Hurricane — a mixture of five rums,
pineapple, vanilla beans, sugar and fruit
juice.
Testimonials: "This is downtown Palo
Alto's most rigorous yuppie training
ground, but that isn't to say I haven't had
a few fun nights there," Hyman said.
"The cocktails are enormous and
extremely strong... especially the one
called Bug Juice or Hurricane Jim 0r... I
don't remember the exact names, which 1
guess is testament to their ferociousness.
Oh, but my favorite is the raspberry
mojito."
"Nolas is overrated," said senior
Derek Lobedan. "I mean they have the
whole Cajun thing down with all the
weird eclectic stuff decorating the walls,
but ultimately the place gets packed."

ing area downstairs gets converted into a
nightclub later in the evening, but food's
always available upstairs.
Atmosphere: New management also
brought with it new carpet, paint, TVs
and furniture. As always, its high, tall ceil
ings give it an airy feel and dwarf the big
screen TVs that are available to watch
sporting events.
Why come? Wednesday is the hip 20-
something night, but it's also the only
night they charge a cover ($5). Karaoke
night on Thursday is getting increasingly
popular. Fridays and Saturdays features
house spinmeister DJ Lucky, who mixes
it up between hip-hop and 80's and other
genre, and Sunday night is acoustic night,
where local artists — often from

Stanford — play
from 9 p.m. to mid
night. (8.W.5.)
5. The Oasis Beer
Garden (aka the
Oasis)
Where: 241 El
Camino Real,
Menlo Park

Atmosphere: The Oasis has a casual inte
rior, with floors covered in peanut shells
and wooden surfaces full of carved ini
tials.
Why Come? Stanford students have
flocked to the Oasis for decades to get
good burgers, pizza, wings and pitchers
and to watch Cardinal athletics on T.V.
Although they serve pear cider and
Mike's Hard Lemonade, there is neither
wine nor hard liquor, so most people just
order beer.
Testimonials: "The Oasis has an old
town, college feel." said junior Vincent
Gonzales, 'it looks cool because people
carved their initials into the wooden
walls, and the food is really good — espe
cially the chicken tenders."
"The atmosphere is much more
homey and less swanky at Oasis, due in
large part to the dark wood tables," said
senior Lauren Kramer. "The beer selec-

tions are adequate,
although they stock
only the standard
beers." (Katie
Bearman)
6. Gordon Biersch
Where: 650 Emerson
Street, Palo Alto
Atmosphere: Gordon
Biersch has brewery
restaurants from
Hawaii to Florida.

While the Palo Alto location is dimly lit,
it still feels more like a restaurant than a
bar. The organization of space can
accommodate large groups of people.
Why Come? This place is a well-known
chain that has its own brewery and serves
a wide variety of beer. Unlike many bars,
it also serves full, quality meals.
Testimonials: "People don't really go
here just to drink," said senior Joey
Natoli.'Tt is a fun place fora decent din
ner and an extensive beer menu.

However, the food isn't college-student
wallet-friendly."
"Their original brews are good, but it
is really loud," said senior Hanna Asrat.
"It makes it hard to have conversations."
(K-B.)

7. La Bodeguita del
Medio
Where:
463 California Avenue,
Palo Alto
Atmosphere: La
Bodeguita del Medio
has a Cuban theme and
has three separate
areas: a bar, a restau
rant and a smoke-

room. It is slightly on the fancy and
expensive side, with dim lighting, original
Cuban artwork and lively music.
Why come? This restaurant has amazing
Cuban food with tropical influence, and a
diverse menu of cocktails, shots, wines
and beers. People rave about the mojito
(a drink made with Bacardi limon rum,
mint, sugar, citrus juice and soda) and the
Hemingway Cocktail (Bacardi limon
rum, maraschino liquor, citrus juice and
sugar, served in a martini glass with a
sugar-coated rim).
Testimonials: "The oyster shooters at La
Bodeguita are super spicy and my dream
come true," said co-term Visra Vichit-
Vadakan.
"If you are going for the Cuban cui
sine, it is less than stellar," said senior
Ellen Crisham. "However, the mojitos
are a perfect compliment to the cigar
smoking area in the back." (K. 8.)
8. The Dutch Goose:
Where:
3567 Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo Park
Atmosphere: This place has wooden
booths and floors, as well as an outdoor
area, giving it a rustic, casual feel. There
is also a pool table and a large room in
the back equipped with long picnic
tables, making it a great space for playing
drinking games. Unlike F&A and Nola's,
The Dutch Goose does not have live
music.
Why come: Visit this restaurant / bar if
you want to try specialty beers (Dutch
Goose does not serve mixed drinks),
drink in a non-smoking atmosphere... or

try their
famous deviled
eggs.
Testimonials:
"The one good
thing I would
say about it is
that the large

room in the back holds enough tables to
entertain rowdy kids just dying to play
beirut or flip-cup off campus," said Sage
Hyman, an Anthropological Sciences co
term. (K. 8.)
9. Fanny and Alexander's (F&A)
Where:
412 Emerson Avenue, downtown PA
Atmosphere: There are two bar rooms

inside and one out
side (during the
summer). Even if it
is crowded, it does
not usually take long
to get a drink.
Additionally, F&A
frequently hires live
bands.
Why go? F&A
serves a wide variety
of mixed drinks and

is often the bar of choice for Senior Pub
Night. If you want to start pre-gaming
ridiculously early, happy hour is from 4-
6:30 p.m. — beers for three dollars.
Testimonials: "F&A is arguably the best
bar in downtown Palo Alto," Natoli said.
"The size inside and out allows for danc
ing and mingling, and the bartenders
seem to know how to make every drink
possible."
"My friend said that F&A is her
favorite place to go for Senior Pub
Nights," said senior Amelia DeLaPaz.

(K. 8.)
10. Nola's
Where:
535 Ramona Street,
downtown PA
Atmosphere:
Nola's is described as
fun, lively and colorful,
with a
California / Creole /
Caribbean feel. There

are multiple rooms, as well as an outdoor
Catio, and sometimes Nola's hires live
ands. Nola's has been open for about six
years, and according to the manager, it
has always been full of Stanford people.
Why go? If you want to bar hop, Nola's
should be on your list, because it is near
many other downtown Palo Alto bars.
Many praise the food at the restaurant
that, like its atmosphere, mixes
California, Creole and Caribbean ele
ments. Try the famous New Orleans
Hurricane — a mixture of five rums,
pineapple, vanilla beans, sugar and fruit
juice.
Testimonials: "This is downtown Palo
Alto's most rigorous yuppie training
ground, but that isn't to say I haven't had
a few fun nights there," Hyman said.
"The cocktails are enormous and
extremely strong... especially the one
called Bug Juice or Hurricane Jim 0r... I
don't remember the exact names, which 1
guess is testament to their ferociousness.
Oh, but my favorite is the raspberry
mojito."
"Nolas is overrated," said senior
Derek Lobedan. "I mean they have the
whole Cajun thing down with all the
weird eclectic stuff decorating the walls,
but ultimately the place gets packed."

chain that has its own brewery and serves
a wide variety of beer. Unlike many bars,
it also serves full, quality meals.
Testimonials: "People don't really go
here just to drink," said senior Joey
Natoli.'Tt is a fun place fora decent din
ner and an extensive beer menu.

However, the food isn't college-student
wallet-friendly."
"Their original brews are good, but it
is really loud," said senior Hanna Asrat.
"It makes it hard to have conversations."
(K-B.)

7. La Bodeguita del
Medio
Where:
463 California Avenue,
Palo Alto
Atmosphere: La
Bodeguita del Medio
has a Cuban theme and
has three separate
areas: a bar, a restau
rant and a smoke-

room. It is slightly on the fancy and
expensive side, with dim lighting, original
Cuban artwork and lively music.
Why come? This restaurant has amazing
Cuban food with tropical influence, and a
diverse menu of cocktails, shots, wines
and beers. People rave about the mojito
(a drink made with Bacardi limon rum,
mint, sugar, citrus juice and soda) and the
Hemingway Cocktail (Bacardi limon
rum, maraschino liquor, citrus juice and
sugar, served in a martini glass with a
sugar-coated rim).
Testimonials: "The oyster shooters at La
Bodeguita are super spicy and my dream
come true," said co-term Visra Vichit-
Vadakan.
"If you are going for the Cuban cui
sine, it is less than stellar," said senior
Ellen Crisham. "However, the mojitos
are a perfect compliment to the cigar
smoking area in the back." (K. 8.)
8. The Dutch Goose:
Where:
3567 Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo Park
Atmosphere: This place has wooden
booths and floors, as well as an outdoor
area, giving it a rustic, casual feel. There
is also a pool table and a large room in
the back equipped with long picnic
tables, making it a great space for playing
drinking games. Unlike F&A and Nola's,
The Dutch Goose does not have live
music.
Why come: Visit this restaurant / bar if
you want to try specialty beers (Dutch
Goose does not serve mixed drinks),
drink in a non-smoking atmosphere... or

try their
famous deviled
eggs.
Testimonials:
"The one good
thing I would
say about it is
that the large

room in the back holds enough tables to
entertain rowdy kids just dying to play
beirut or flip-cup off campus," said Sage
Hyman, an Anthropological Sciences co
term. (K. 8.)
9. Fanny and Alexander's (F&A)
Where:
412 Emerson Avenue, downtown PA
Atmosphere: There are two bar rooms

inside and one out
side (during the
summer). Even if it
is crowded, it does
not usually take long
to get a drink.
Additionally, F&A
frequently hires live
bands.
Why go? F&A
serves a wide variety
of mixed drinks and

is often the bar of choice for Senior Pub
Night. If you want to start pre-gaming
ridiculously early, happy hour is from 4-
6:30 p.m. — beers for three dollars.
Testimonials: "F&A is arguably the best
bar in downtown Palo Alto," Natoli said.
"The size inside and out allows for danc
ing and mingling, and the bartenders
seem to know how to make every drink
possible."
"My friend said that F&A is her
favorite place to go for Senior Pub
Nights," said senior Amelia DeLaPaz.

(K. 8.)
10. Nola's
Where:
535 Ramona Street,
downtown PA
Atmosphere:
Nola's is described as
fun, lively and colorful,
with a
California / Creole /
Caribbean feel. There

are multiple rooms, as well as an outdoor
Catio, and sometimes Nola's hires live
ands. Nola's has been open for about six
years, and according to the manager, it
has always been full of Stanford people.
Why go? If you want to bar hop, Nola's
should be on your list, because it is near
many other downtown Palo Alto bars.
Many praise the food at the restaurant
that, like its atmosphere, mixes
California, Creole and Caribbean ele
ments. Try the famous New Orleans
Hurricane — a mixture of five rums,
pineapple, vanilla beans, sugar and fruit
juice.
Testimonials: "This is downtown Palo
Alto's most rigorous yuppie training
ground, but that isn't to say I haven't had
a few fun nights there," Hyman said.
"The cocktails are enormous and
extremely strong... especially the one
called Bug Juice or Hurricane Jim 0r... I
don't remember the exact names, which 1
guess is testament to their ferociousness.
Oh, but my favorite is the raspberry
mojito."
"Nolas is overrated," said senior
Derek Lobedan. "I mean they have the
whole Cajun thing down with all the
weird eclectic stuff decorating the walls,
but ultimately the place gets packed."

2. Blue Chalk
Cafe
Where: Across
from City Hall
in downtown
PA, a block
south of
University
Drive on
Ramona St.

Signature drink: The Blue Chalk
Lemonade, whose mixture of SoCo, blue
curacao, lemonade, sweet and sour, and
soda will get you ready for the evening.
Runs around $7.
Food: It's "eclectic," says Stacy Piza, who
organizes private parties at the CafE.
"Some Southwest, some pub food." Her
favorite? "I like the grilled chicken with
garlic mashed potatoes."

Atmosphere: The
only place in da
PA with two dis
tinct bars, bil
liards, shuffle
board and dining
area.
Why come? A DJ
spins every

Wednesday and i-riday, and live oands
play Thursday. (8.W.5.)

PA.
Signature drink: The Worston Apple,
made with Crown Royale, Apple Plucker
and sweet and sour. Costs you 5 bucks.
Food: The kitchen's been leased out to a
local taqueri'a, so the fare is mostly
Mexican, with an occasional hamburger
thrown in.
Atmosphere: "Crazy." Four pool tables,
foosball, pinball machines, 13 TVs and

arcade games litter the
peanut-strewn floor.
Why come? Probably
for the above-men
tioned craziness, and the

House" atmosphere.
(8.W.5.)
4. The British Bankers
Club (BBC)

Where: 1090 El Camino, at the corner of
Santa Cruz Ave. in Menlo Park.

ly a library.
Signature drink: "Our martinis are really,
really good," says Ryan Bleyle, a manag
er at the BBC.Try the Belvedere martini,
if you don't mind forking $8.50.
Food: A change of ownership last August
brought a whole new menu, which focus
es now on California bistro cuisine and
includes steaks, salads and pasta. A din
ing area downstairs gets converted into a
nightclub later in the evening, but food's
always available upstairs.
Atmosphere: New management also
brought with it new carpet, paint, TVs
and furniture. As always, its high, tall ceil
ings give it an airy feel and dwarf the big
screen TVs that are available to watch
sporting events.
Why come? Wednesday is the hip 20-
something night, but it's also the only
night they charge a cover ($5). Karaoke
night on Thursday is getting increasingly
popular. Fridays and Saturdays features

rior, with floors covered in peanut shells
and wooden surfaces full of carved ini
tials.
Why Come? Stanford students have
flocked to the Oasis for decades to get
good burgers, pizza, wings and pitchers
and to watch Cardinal athletics on T.V.
Although they serve pear cider and
Mike's Hard Lemonade, there is neither
wine nor hard liquor, so most people just
order beer.
Testimonials: "The Oasis has an old
town, college feel." said junior Vincent
Gonzales, 'it looks cool because people
carved their initials into the wooden
walls, and the food is really good — espe
cially the chicken tenders."
"The atmosphere is much more
homey and less swanky at Oasis, due in
large part to the dark wood tables," said
senior Lauren Kramer. "The beer selec-

tions are adequate,
although they stock
only the standard
beers." (Katie
Bearman)
6. Gordon Biersch
Where: 650 Emerson
Street, Palo Alto
Atmosphere: Gordon
Biersch has brewery
restaurants from
Hawaii to Florida.

While the Palo Alto location is dimly lit,
it still feels more like a restaurant than a
bar. The organization of space can
accommodate large groups of people.
Why Come? This place is a well-known
chain that has its own brewery and serves
a wide variety of beer. Unlike many bars,
