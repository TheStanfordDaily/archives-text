## Op-Ed GSC clarifies its support of relief effort 
### DONNA WINSTON 
The Graduate Student Council
would like to clarify some issues that
were raised in the Daily article "GSC
debates tsunami relief printed yester
day.
First, the GSC is committed to the
success of the Stanford Student Relief
campaign. The recent tsunami has af
fected many at Stanford, and we be
lieve that all members of the Universi
ty should respond as a united commu
nity. The most effective means of
achieving this is for each individual or
entity to use the strengths of his or her
respective role to contribute to the re
lief effort.
To this end, the (JSC created an in
ternal subcommittee at the GSC' meet
ing on Jan. 12. Ibis action was not
meant to create an initiative indepen
dent of the SSR. but rather to use the
strength of the GSC — connecting to
graduate students — to develop ways
to successfully involve the graduate stu
dent community in supp< >rting the SSR.

Such an action is no different Irom
the Undergraduate Senate or Faculty
Senate developing a committee to cap
italize on their unique relationship
with the Stanford populations they
represent. The C JSC's subcommittee
will not act unilaterally and indepen
dent of the SSR. Proxy School of Engi
neering Representative Thomas Lee
will serve as an active liaison between
the committee and the SSR to ensure
coordination between the two groups.
Secondly, we would like to high
light points in the article where infor
mation was unintentionally either mis
construed or omitted. GSC Chajr Mo
riah Thomason's statement regarding
the purpose of GSC funds was misin
terpreted. GSC funds are collected
from students for the purpose of fund
ing events for graduate student groups.
(Jroups such as SSR are welcome
to apply for event funding, provided
that the events have significant gradu
ate involvement and groups adhere to
the (JSC' by-laws and funding commit
tee policies. Thus, Thomason's quote

was pari of a longer statement in which
she provided the SSR with guidelines
for what type of activities the GSC
could fiscally support.
Some striking omissions were the
many helpful suggestions various GSC
officers provided to SSR Co-Chair
Gabriel Brat. Among these were seek
ing matching funds from corporate
sponsors and reaching alumni for sup
port through the Stanford Magazine
and appearing at upcoming local alum
ni events.
The GSC hopes that this op-ed
serves to not only clarify its position in
regard to the SSR and the tsunami re
lief effort, hut to also alert all members
of the graduate student community
that we must be active in supporting a
cause that has impacted so many so
deeply.
