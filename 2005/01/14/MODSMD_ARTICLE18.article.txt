## Lessons learned from the tsunamis 
### RUSSELL HERMAN 
As the toll from the tsunami con
tinues to mount, it has become clear
that this catastrophe was also a po
litical turning point. No govern
ments may have fallen, but some
deeply held political myths and be
liefs have not been able to withstand
the force of the tidal wave that
changed the world.
First and foremost, the myth of
Islamic solidarity has been shat
tered. Even though most victims in
Indonesia, the most populous Islam
ic country on the face of the earth,
are Muslim, the support flowing
from Arab governments has been
pitifully small. The decades of
petrodollars and the years of high
gas prices have apparently not put
the oil-rich Middle East in a position
to afford to offer much help to Mus
lims in distress.
But as Islamic victims receive
support from the non-Islamic world,
tht already dubious claim that the
general opinion of Muslims in the
Middle East might be predisposed
to s rise up against the West becomes
simply untenable.
In the face of a real disaster, nei
ther the fundamentalists nor the
Baathists nor the anticolonialists
have done much at all. In contrast.

the energy of the Western relief ef
fort is likely to put a deep dent in the
anti-Western — and especially anti-
American — propaganda of the Is
lamicists.
Second, the generosity of the de
veloped world has been consider
able, especially from such regional
neighbors as Japan and Australia
but also from the United States and
Europe. The tendentious suggestion
that the United States was "stingy"
failed to note that the "old Euro
pean" powers initially proposed rel
atively low offers of aid as well. Only
as the real extent of the disaster be
came clear did these amounts grow
to many times their original si/e.
Moreover, the outpouring of sup
port has highlighted the importance
of private giving and therefore the
role of society beyond the state, just
as it has shed light on the marginal
standing of the United Nations.
The U.N. may still be able to find
a raison d'etre in aid coordination.
Although, after the debacle of the
Oil-for-Food program, to expect a
small dose of efficiency from a U.N.
operation requires a bold leap of
faith. The I J.N. was simply unable to
provide the leadership that came
from the representatives of demo
cratic nations — better unilateral
action than multilateral inaction.

Finally, because disaster relief is
not only about cash but also about a
logistic capacity to deliver aid to the
needy, a strategic military presence
is crucial. Good intentions are a
wonderful thing to have, but troops
on the ground get things done.
Although the Europeans have
promised generous amounts of aid,
they simply lack the naval capacity
to transport it to the region in a time
ly manner, and it is unlikely that
they will develop such a capacity in
the future.
The United States played a cen
tral role in the relief effort, thanks to
its fleet. It is difficult to imagine that
this operation will not counteract
some residual anti-Americanism in
the area. French President Jacques
Chirac complained that the United
States stole the limelight from a hy
pothetical multilateral effort he
might have preferred, but in the
meantime American aid has been
able to save lives in Indonesia be
cause U.S. forces were actually able
to get there.
