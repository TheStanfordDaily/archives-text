## Leftist counter-inauguration protests are counterproductive 
### WILL NELSON 
Thousands of angry protestors will
join the inaugural festivities next
week when President George W.
Bush is sworn in for his second term.
Their actions will once again demon
strate how the left's overzealous pas
sion for protest is counterproductive
and polarizing.
TTiere are plenty of valid reasons
for citizens to organize political
protests. Perhaps the best is to publi
cize some important injustice that
isn't widely recognized. If only other
citizens were aware of a particular

grievance, there would be a public
outcry, and authorities would have to
act.
This basic formula worked during
the l%()s civil rights marches. Rightly
proud of this major achievement.
American liberals have attempted to
reuse this tactic ever since.
But the key here is that protests
can only work when they connect with
a large persuadable public. If the pub
lic has heard the protestors' argu
ments before and dismissed them, the
protest is a waste of time.
The anti-war demonstrators along
the inaugural parade route are not

going to change anyone's ideas about
Bush or the war. Anyone remember
the campaign that ended just two
months ago? If that wasn't enough to
change people's opinions, how do the
protestors expect to do it by chanting
and carrying banners espousing ex
tremist views with which most Amer
icans clearly disagree?
If these protests are anything like
prior anti-war demonstrations, there
will be banners calling Bush a war
criminal, comparing him to Hitler and
demanding "No War for Oil!" in vio
lent lettering. There will be signs
equating war with terrorism and

shouts demanding an end to Ameri
can imperialism. Like most Ameri
cans, I find such banners and slogans
easy to dismiss.
But some of the protestors' con
cerns are legitimate. The war in Iraq is
not going well. Most Americans hope
for clear victory, but there are trou
bling signs that we may have to settle
fora less-than-stellar outcome. After
the Iraqi election at the end of the
month, Americans may need to make
some tough decisions about the war.
The anti-war protestors will do
nothing to help further this dialogue.
They inject way too much incendiary

anti-corporation, anti-American non
sense. Their actions serve not to make
people think twice about the war, but
to equate second thoughts about the
war with extreme leftist rhetoric.
If questioning the direction of the
war is tied to questioning the legitima
cy ol the war. the president, capitalism
and our nation, then most Americans
will end up questioning none of these.
By hitching some valid concerns
about the war to extremist rhetoric,
liberal protestors may actually harden
public opinion in support of the war.
Some on the left hold a different
perspective about the purpose of mass

protests. They use protests not to per
suade, but to threaten: "Continue
your evil ways, and we will block the
streets, disrupt your convention and
ridicule all you stand for."
This protest-as-threat strategy
marginalizes the left wing even more
than protest-as-persuasion. Voting
conspiracy theories aside, a majority of
Americans chose George W. Bush for
president and supported the war. A
group of protestors threatening public
order in such circumstances amounts
to a small group imposing its views in
