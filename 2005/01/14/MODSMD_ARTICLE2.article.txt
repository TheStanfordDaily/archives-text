# ASSU pushes for disclosure
## 
### JENNY ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the aftermath of corporate
scandals, the Stanford Coalition for
Investment Disclosure, also known
as SCID, decided that increasing the
University's investment disclosures
can improve accountability. SCID
sought and received support from
the ASSU Advocacy Committee last
night.
In an 8-1-0 vote, the ASSU
agreed to bring a bill to the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate next Tues
day asking for greater dialogue be
tween representatives of the Board
of Trustees and students, an interest
for student involvement in the
process and general support fora
movement toward greater invest
ment disclosure.
"I think that the advocacy com
mittee recognized the overwhelming
student concerns with the Universi
ty's investments," said sophomore
and SCID member Ryan Schwartz.
"I look forward to the Board of

Trustees opening up this desperately
needed dialogue."
According to SCID's presenta
tion, the Stanford endowment was
over $12.2 billion as of June 2004.
The University is not required to dis
close the details of its investments
because of its nonprofit status. Uni
versity administrators have been un
willing to disclose information be
cause of concern about opening up
the University to liability, the ex
pense of providing up-to-date lists
and the risk of profit loss.
"Over $12.2 billion is a lot of
money, and it is important that we as
students are aware of where the
money is going and have an open line
of communication with the Board of
Trustees about our concerns," said
sophomore Omar Shakir, the ASSU
advocacy committee chair.
"1 think the key consensus is that
we would like to see a greater
amount of student input in the in
vestment process and greater disclo
sure from the Board of Trustees that
our investments are being handled in

an ethical manner," said Senator
Russell Husen, a sophomore.
Senate Chair Chris Lin, a senior,
suggested that the Undergraduate
Senate remain open-minded about

ways to have ethical investment con
cerns addressed by the University.
