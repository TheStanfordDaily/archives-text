# ASSU pushes for disclosure
## 
### JENNY ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the aftermath of corporate
scandals, the Stanford Coalition for
Investment Disclosure, also known
as SCID, decided that increasing the
University's investment disclosures
can improve accountability. SCID
sought and received support from
the ASSU Advocacy Committee last
night.
In an 8-1-0 vote, the ASSU
agreed to bring a bill to the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate next Tues
day asking for greater dialogue be
tween representatives of the Board
of Trustees and students, an interest
for student involvement in the
process and general support fora
movement toward greater invest
ment disclosure.
"I think that the advocacy com
mittee recognized the overwhelming
student concerns with the Universi
ty's investments," said sophomore
and SCID member Ryan Schwartz.
"I look forward to the Board of

Trustees opening up this desperately
needed dialogue."
According to SCID's presenta
tion, the Stanford endowment was
over $12.2 billion as of June 2004.
The University is not required to dis
close the details of its investments
because of its nonprofit status. Uni
versity administrators have been un
willing to disclose information be
cause of concern about opening up
the University to liability, the ex
pense of providing up-to-date lists
and the risk of profit loss.
"Over $12.2 billion is a lot of
money, and it is important that we as
students are aware of where the
money is going and have an open line
of communication with the Board of
Trustees about our concerns," said
sophomore Omar Shakir, the ASSU
advocacy committee chair.
"1 think the key consensus is that
we would like to see a greater
amount of student input in the in
vestment process and greater disclo
sure from the Board of Trustees that
our investments are being handled in

an ethical manner," said Senator
Russell Husen, a sophomore.
Senate Chair Chris Lin, a senior,
suggested that the Undergraduate
Senate remain open-minded about

ways to have ethical investment con
cerns addressed by the University.

The ASSU Senate discusses a bill requesting that the Board of Trustees
make more of efforts to communicate endowment investments to students.
"At this time I am not ready to say that the student
body is in favor of investment disclosure," he said.
"Students want the endowment invested in a respon
sible manner, but there may be other ways of achiev
ing that goal besides full investment disclosure."
Anna Mumford, a co-terminal student in the
School of Education who serves as a student repre
sentative on the Advisory Panel on Investment Re
sponsibility, agreed.
"The Senate's endorsement calling for increased
disclosure of Stanford's endowment investments will
send a powerful message to Stanford that as students
and members of this University community, we care
about impacts our University is having on the larger
world through our investments," she said.
The APIR is an investigative panel composed of
students and faculty that reviews and researches alle
gations of substantial social injury by companies in
the endowment. Based on its findings, the APIR is
supposed to make recommendations to the Univer
sity president and to a sub-committee of the Board of
Trustees. The subcommittee then makes investment
policy recommendations to the Board of Trustees,
which oversees all issues of University governance.
The request for the bill is the result of concerns
regarding the current process of review for Universi
ty investments.
"Following the successful campaign to divest
from corporations supporting apartheid in South
Africa, Stanford set up the APIR, which reports to a
subcommittee of the Board of Trustees and ostensi
bly deals with claims that Stanford money is being in
vested in socially, environmentally or otherwise irre
sponsible companies," according to senior and SCID
member Kate Skolnick.
"There are two reasons that this process does not
work," she said. "First, the percentage of Stanford in
vestments that are not even transparent to the APIR

Senate asks Board to
divulge investments

is growing, so there is currently no process for re
viewing the responsibility of those investments. The
investments may be sound, but we have no way of
knowing without disclosure.
Secondly, we believe that the current committee
structure is relatively weak and allows concerned
community members little recourse in the event of
the discovery of an irresponsible investment."
Students supporting the bill view investment dis
closure as a tool for allowing students to be more in
volved with the university's fiscal policy.
"A bill would force the University to sit up and
listen to student concerns, and not just pay them lip
service," said senior Raphael Ginsburg, a member of
SCID. "If a disclosure policy is reached, it would
mean that students could act directly to investigate,
and possibly organize against, specific companies.
Disclosure would allow students to be proactive,
rather than reactive. It would allow new issues to be
raised that might not be on the radar of people craft
ing proxy voting guidelines or managing the endow
ment."
"I personally am not comfortable knowing that
my education may be funded in part by exploita
tion," Skolnick said. "It is also important to recog
nize that members of SCID are not challenging the
idea of investing our endowment to ensure the future
viability of the University. Rather, we are recogniz
ing that there are ways to ensure that continuity
through responsible investment with a greater level
of community oversight."
Those advocating for greater fiscal transparency
hope to pass bills similar to the one developed for the
Undergraduate Senate in the Graduate Student
Council and the Faculty Senate as well.
"SCID will continue to work with students, facul
ty and alumni to build a broad base of support for in
vestment disclosure," Ginsburg said.

rather than reactive. It would allow new issues to be
raised that might not be on the radar of people craft
ing proxy voting guidelines or managing the endow
ment."
"I personally am not comfortable knowing that
my education may be funded in part by exploita
tion," Skolnick said. "It is also important to recog
nize that members of SCID are not challenging the
idea of investing our endowment to ensure the future
viability of the University. Rather, we are recogniz
ing that there are ways to ensure that continuity
through responsible investment with a greater level
of community oversight."
Those advocating for greater fiscal transparency
hope to pass bills similar to the one developed for the
Undergraduate Senate in the Graduate Student
Council and the Faculty Senate as well.
"SCID will continue to work with students, facul
ty and alumni to build a broad base of support for in
vestment disclosure," Ginsburg said.
In the aftermath of corporate
scandals, the Stanford Coalition for
Investment Disclosure, also known
as SCID, decided that increasing the
University's investment disclosures
can improve accountability. SCID
sought and received support from
the ASSU Advocacy Committee last
night.
In an 8-1-0 vote, the ASSU
agreed to bring a bill to the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate next Tues
day asking for greater dialogue be
tween representatives of the Board
of Trustees and students, an interest
for student involvement in the
process and general support fora
movement toward greater invest
ment disclosure.
"I think that the advocacy com
mittee recognized the overwhelming
student concerns with the Universi
ty's investments," said sophomore
and SCID member Ryan Schwartz.
"I look forward to the Board of

Trustees opening up this desperately
needed dialogue."
According to SCID's presenta
tion, the Stanford endowment was
over $12.2 billion as of June 2004.
The University is not required to dis
close the details of its investments
because of its nonprofit status. Uni
versity administrators have been un
willing to disclose information be
cause of concern about opening up
the University to liability, the ex
pense of providing up-to-date lists
and the risk of profit loss.
"Over $12.2 billion is a lot of
money, and it is important that we as
students are aware of where the
money is going and have an open line
of communication with the Board of
Trustees about our concerns," said
sophomore Omar Shakir, the ASSU
advocacy committee chair.
"1 think the key consensus is that
we would like to see a greater
amount of student input in the in
vestment process and greater disclo
sure from the Board of Trustees that
our investments are being handled in

an ethical manner," said Senator
Russell Husen, a sophomore.
Senate Chair Chris Lin, a senior,
suggested that the Undergraduate
Senate remain open-minded about

ways to have ethical investment con
cerns addressed by the University.

The ASSU Senate discusses a bill requesting that the Board of Trustees
make more of efforts to communicate endowment investments to students.
"At this time I am not ready to say that the student
body is in favor of investment disclosure," he said.
"Students want the endowment invested in a respon
sible manner, but there may be other ways of achiev
ing that goal besides full investment disclosure."
Anna Mumford, a co-terminal student in the
School of Education who serves as a student repre
sentative on the Advisory Panel on Investment Re
sponsibility, agreed.
"The Senate's endorsement calling for increased
disclosure of Stanford's endowment investments will
send a powerful message to Stanford that as students
and members of this University community, we care
about impacts our University is having on the larger
world through our investments," she said.
The APIR is an investigative panel composed of
students and faculty that reviews and researches alle
gations of substantial social injury by companies in
the endowment. Based on its findings, the APIR is
supposed to make recommendations to the Univer
sity president and to a sub-committee of the Board of
Trustees. The subcommittee then makes investment
policy recommendations to the Board of Trustees,
which oversees all issues of University governance.
The request for the bill is the result of concerns
regarding the current process of review for Universi
ty investments.
"Following the successful campaign to divest
from corporations supporting apartheid in South
Africa, Stanford set up the APIR, which reports to a
subcommittee of the Board of Trustees and ostensi
bly deals with claims that Stanford money is being in
vested in socially, environmentally or otherwise irre
sponsible companies," according to senior and SCID
member Kate Skolnick.
"There are two reasons that this process does not
work," she said. "First, the percentage of Stanford in
vestments that are not even transparent to the APIR

Senate asks Board to
divulge investments

is growing, so there is currently no process for re
viewing the responsibility of those investments. The
investments may be sound, but we have no way of
knowing without disclosure.
Secondly, we believe that the current committee
structure is relatively weak and allows concerned
community members little recourse in the event of
the discovery of an irresponsible investment."
Students supporting the bill view investment dis
closure as a tool for allowing students to be more in
volved with the university's fiscal policy.
"A bill would force the University to sit up and
listen to student concerns, and not just pay them lip
service," said senior Raphael Ginsburg, a member of
SCID. "If a disclosure policy is reached, it would
mean that students could act directly to investigate,
and possibly organize against, specific companies.
Disclosure would allow students to be proactive,
rather than reactive. It would allow new issues to be
raised that might not be on the radar of people craft
