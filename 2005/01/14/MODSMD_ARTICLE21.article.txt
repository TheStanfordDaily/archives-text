# Irrational Exuberance
## The 						Superman myth 
### 
An occasionally remarked
upon recent trend in popu
lar culture is the resur
gence of the fantasy genre.
The immense popularity of Lord of the
Rings and Harry Potter attest to this.
Additionally, the new Star Wars
is more space-fantasy rather than sci
ence fiction, and the re-emergence of
the superhero genre in film is just
fantasy set in contemporary times.
Science fiction writer David Brin ex
amines Lord of the Rings and con-

nects the fantasy
genre with the ro
mantic era of the
century, a
time when a cer
tain pernicious
idea took hold
that continue to
capture our imag
ination today —
the idea of the su
perman.

Brin asks, why is
it that the heroes in Lord of the Rings
are super-powerful beings who are en
dowed by birth with power, while
Sauron's forces which represent sci
ence and industrialization are l(x>ked
upon as evil? The ring represents tech
nology: improvement of man or ore by
science rather than by noble birth. The
fellowship seeks to destroy it.
We see a similar trend in how
George Lucas ruined the Zen ethos of
the Jedi by introducing mitochlorians.
Rather than being morally disciplined
righteous warriors, we find that the
Jedi are a blue-blooded master race: a
eugenic triumph.
In the cultural phenomenon that is
Harry Potter, the hero is a whiney and
lucky kid who was born to greatness,
rather than the studious and hard
working Hermione.
At Pixar, the moral of the movie
"The Incredibles" is that achievement
based on invention and effort is evil,
while achievement on the basis of ge
netics is good. The one who deserves to
win the race is the one with the super
powered genes.
The pervasiveness of this idea is
partly because it is the curious conflu
ence of two important streams of west
ern thought: Marxism and capitalism.
The idea of superman is the meeting
point of Friedrich Nietzsche and Ayn
Rand.
Significantly, not only is super
man's influence pervasive, but it is also
pernicious. Psychologists have found
that the reason boys outperform girls
in mathematics is because boys at
tribute success in mathematics to hard
work, while girls attribute success to in
nate ability.

Thus, when boys get a low mark on
a test, they work harder, while girls
have a tendency to give up. While
there is no doubt that both effort and
innate ability are essential to success,
which you choose to focus on is of great
impact.
Twin studies have shown that ge
netics determine about half of the vari
ance in explaining intelligence. How
ever. this is a case where I willfully ig
nore the science. 1 refuse to believe
that the students of Stanford are some
how genetically superior,
1 instead cling to attribution the
ory from psychology, which argues
that people — Americans in partic
ular — tend to over-attribute out
comes to personal characteristics
rather than the situation. If we see
someone succeed, we tend to as
sume that she succeeded* because
she's smart, rather than that she suc
ceeded because her environment al
lowed her to obtain the tools neces
sary for success.
1 have said in earlier columns that 1
am a Marxist in the old sense. In one
way, most economists would agree
with me: Structure dominates agency.
The Randian heroes of capitalism are
not the ones that make market
economies work.
Instead, market economies work
because of their institutions: the
norms, values, rules and knowledge,
which create the proper incentive
structures and the proper environ
ment effectively letting individuals
organize in efficient ways. This sys
tem has led to unprecedented
widespread prosperity more fantas
tic than anything achieved by some
superhero.
Unfortunately, it is so much more
satisfying in movies to root for an indi
vidual rather than for the environ
ment. For this reason. Star Trek tends
to fall a bit flat.
The hero of Star Trek is not any one
person, but instead, the hero is the sys
tem: the rules, values, knowledge and
institutions that govern the Federation
and Starfleet. Star Trek is about the tri
umph of science in solving the prob
lems of mankind. Science fiction, done
right, bucks the Romantic fantasy
trend.
Forward-looking science has the
power to elevate all individuals. Back
ward-looking fantasy seeks to choose
our kings. The choice of which belief
system to follow is yours to make.

An occasionally remarked
upon recent trend in popu
lar culture is the resur
gence of the fantasy genre.
The immense popularity of Lord of the
Rings and Harry Potter attest to this.
Additionally, the new Star Wars
is more space-fantasy rather than sci
ence fiction, and the re-emergence of
the superhero genre in film is just
fantasy set in contemporary times.
Science fiction writer David Brin ex
amines Lord of the Rings and con-

nects the fantasy
genre with the ro
mantic era of the
century, a
time when a cer
tain pernicious
idea took hold
that continue to
capture our imag
ination today —
the idea of the su
perman.

Brin asks, why is
it that the heroes in Lord of the Rings
are super-powerful beings who are en
dowed by birth with power, while
Sauron's forces which represent sci
ence and industrialization are l(x>ked
upon as evil? The ring represents tech
nology: improvement of man or ore by
science rather than by noble birth. The
fellowship seeks to destroy it.
We see a similar trend in how
George Lucas ruined the Zen ethos of
the Jedi by introducing mitochlorians.
Rather than being morally disciplined
righteous warriors, we find that the
Jedi are a blue-blooded master race: a
eugenic triumph.
In the cultural phenomenon that is
Harry Potter, the hero is a whiney and
lucky kid who was born to greatness,
rather than the studious and hard
working Hermione.
At Pixar, the moral of the movie
"The Incredibles" is that achievement
based on invention and effort is evil,
while achievement on the basis of ge
netics is good. The one who deserves to
win the race is the one with the super
powered genes.
The pervasiveness of this idea is
partly because it is the curious conflu
ence of two important streams of west
ern thought: Marxism and capitalism.
The idea of superman is the meeting
point of Friedrich Nietzsche and Ayn
Rand.
Significantly, not only is super
man's influence pervasive, but it is also
pernicious. Psychologists have found
that the reason boys outperform girls
in mathematics is because boys at
tribute success in mathematics to hard
work, while girls attribute success to in
nate ability.

Thus, when boys get a low mark on
a test, they work harder, while girls
have a tendency to give up. While
there is no doubt that both effort and
innate ability are essential to success,
which you choose to focus on is of great
impact.
Twin studies have shown that ge
netics determine about half of the vari
ance in explaining intelligence. How
ever. this is a case where I willfully ig
nore the science. 1 refuse to believe
that the students of Stanford are some
how genetically superior,
1 instead cling to attribution the
ory from psychology, which argues
that people — Americans in partic
ular — tend to over-attribute out
comes to personal characteristics
rather than the situation. If we see
someone succeed, we tend to as
sume that she succeeded* because
she's smart, rather than that she suc
ceeded because her environment al
lowed her to obtain the tools neces
sary for success.
1 have said in earlier columns that 1
am a Marxist in the old sense. In one
way, most economists would agree
with me: Structure dominates agency.
The Randian heroes of capitalism are
not the ones that make market
economies work.
Instead, market economies work
because of their institutions: the
norms, values, rules and knowledge,
which create the proper incentive
structures and the proper environ
ment effectively letting individuals
organize in efficient ways. This sys
tem has led to unprecedented
widespread prosperity more fantas
tic than anything achieved by some
superhero.
Unfortunately, it is so much more
satisfying in movies to root for an indi
vidual rather than for the environ
ment. For this reason. Star Trek tends
to fall a bit flat.
The hero of Star Trek is not any one
person, but instead, the hero is the sys
tem: the rules, values, knowledge and
institutions that govern the Federation
and Starfleet. Star Trek is about the tri
umph of science in solving the prob
lems of mankind. Science fiction, done
right, bucks the Romantic fantasy
trend.
Forward-looking science has the
power to elevate all individuals. Back
ward-looking fantasy seeks to choose
our kings. The choice of which belief
system to follow is yours to make.
