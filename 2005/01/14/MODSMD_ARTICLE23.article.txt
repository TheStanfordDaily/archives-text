# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## This column will change the NBA, er, 'Tha League' 
### 
His name is Philip Champion, and he is
about to change the world.
But I bet you don't even know who he is.
You've probably seen him on TV once or
twice, seen him with a professor, seen him
with his friends. But you still don't know.
You still don't know his skills, his thoughts

or his handles. So while I
try to break your ankles
with a killer crossover of
my own prose, try to figure
out who Philip Champion is
before reading the next
sentence.
His name is Hot Sauce,
and he is about to change the
NBA.
The NBA, henceforth re-

ferred to as "Tha League" to
preserve my reputation on "tha streets," is
going through a period of prosperity unseen in
American sports since baseball in its golden
age. Tha League's finals consistently outdraw
the World Series, with basketball stars more
übiquitous than those in football or baseball.
However, there are black marks on the game,
ranging from the Artest brawl to U.S. Olympic
basketball to the Atlanta Hawks.
This is where Hot Sauce comes in.
Hot Sauce, the former marquee player for
the ANDI Mixtape Tour (he has since left
ANDI to promote his "Killer Crossover
Tour;" in an official press release from Hot
Sauce's camp, he claims the split was amicable
and that "there's no beef"), is exactly what
basketball needs. Let's put some streetball in
tha League. It's just about time.
Just look at the Atlanta Hawks. Can you
name more than two players on that team? Se
riously. name two players, and I'll even spot
you Josh Childress. The fact is, that team ranks
dead last in tha League in terms of attendance,
is a dismal 6-26 and clearly needs a point
guard: nobody can think that Tyronn Lue is a
long term solution.
My proposal? If your team isn't going to
win, if you are sinking salary cap into a road to
nowhere (i.e. Antoine Walker, who takes
more than five three-pointers a game and yet
shoots 32 percent from behind the arc and 51
percent from the line) and nobody shows up at
your games, at least give the people what they
want. Give them some entertainment, give
them some crossover dribbles, give them some
alley-oops.
Give them Hot Sauce.
Sign "50" while you're at it too. These two
ANDI bailers deserve some respect, so why
not give it to them in their own hometown?
Who wouldn't pay to see Hot Sizzle take the
floor, his jersey three sizes too big and shorts at
his ankles, only to cross up Shawn Bradley,
sending the white man flying into his owner's
arms and 50 into a two-handed alley-oop?
Wouldn't you like to see Hot Sauce pull "the
shuffle" on Leßron or "the hypnotizer" on T-
Mac, dribbling past only to stare them down
steps away, chucking the rock to the upper
deck in a fit of arrogance?
Don't look at me like that. I'm serious!
Damn serious! Everyone was laughing when
the Toronto Raptors signed "Skip to My Lou"
for six years at nearly 30 million, but look at
him now. Rafer Alston is averaging about
seven assists, 13 points and 1.5 steals per game.
Not bad fora guy who didn't play against any
defense all his life, as "ANDI" critics will tell
you.
But seriously, why hasn't this happened?
