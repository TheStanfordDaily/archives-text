# Schedule packed for spring season

### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
It's often said there's no rest for the weary.
Try telling that to the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis
team (1-0), whose first team win of the season against mea
ger Hawaii (0-1) last November was no indicator of more
grueling things to come. The Cardinal will see their time to
rest dwindle as two tournaments this weekend launch the
2005 season.
Starting today, eight Cardinal plunge into the last set of
individual tournaments before April's Pacific-10 Confer
ence Tournament. No. 12 Alice Barnes, No. 22 Erin Bur
dette. Kara Guzman and No. 82 Anne Yelsey will compete
among the three singles and two doubles flights at the Pac
-10 Indoor Tournament in Seattle, Wash.
No. 35 Theresa Logar. defending champion at Freeman
Invitational, will return to Las Vegas in search of a second
consecutive title. The sophomore is joined by No. 41 fresh
man Whitney Deason. freshman Lejla Hodzic and junior
Joanna Kao.
Stanford assistant coach Frankie Brennan won't let the
recent practice-hindering storms cloud his excitement over

Stanford women's tennis sends five nationally
ranked players to Washington and Nevada tour
naments today.
Freshmen talent fills
singles Held in 2005

the start of spring season and up
coming dual matches.
"Fall is a very dead time," Bren
nan said. "It's hard to get motivated
because who do you play for [be
sides) yourself? |Many] players are
not into the individual accolades,
otherwise they would have chosen
to go pro."
As for what happened in 2004,
the Cardinal don't plan to mull over
it. For junior Barnes, that means
disregarding her 5-4 record —
which might explain her stumble
from No. 7 in rankings —and the
disappointing second-round losses
in two competitions and instead re
instate the patience and persistence
of the performance that earned her
the 2004 MVP at NCAAs last May.
For Guzman, a senior who was
sidelined by a shoulder injury last
spring, that means returning to the
third flight at Pac-10 Indoors and
trying to make good on last year's
first-round loss to UCLA's Laura
Gordon.
A lot of players] really pushed
it to the max in terms of physical and
mental limitations right up through
nationals and came back this fall a
little more relaxed," Brennan said.
"|But | it will pick up again because
you start wanting to defend that
title."
The Pac-10 and Freeman tourna
ments also herald the start of a true
test of mettle for the freshman
crowd, whose commanding perfor-

mances last fall have already set a
good precedent.
"[Deason and Hodzicj will head
to Las Vegas to try to get some na
tional exposure to improve their
rankings," Brennan said.
Boasting a 7-1 record, Deason
plowed through the likes of Ore
gon's No. 31 Daria Panova and is
comfortably biding her time in the
midst of the nation's top 1 (K).
Deason already owns her first in
dividual title after claiming the
Thunderbird Invitational Crown
from teammate Hod/.ic.
Hodzic (8-2) finished in the top
four at the SMC invitational and
looked strong in the No. 5 singles
slot against Hawaii's Kimberly Cur
tis. Hodzic allowed Curtis just two
games in her straight-set victory.
Hodzic's power game (it never
hurts to be 5-foot-10 in the game)
will readily rival Logar's and Dea
son's shots, who were seeded sixth
and eighth at Freeman.
Kao is looking to improve on
last year's second-round loss to
third-seeded Aniela Mojzis of
North Carolina.
Meanwhile, Pac-10 in Seattle
brings its brand of formidable famil
iarity: it culls players from all nine
Pac-10 women's tennis schools, all
of which are ranked. No. 66 Wash
ington State might be considered
the straggler, offering a small roster
of only six women, none of whom
are ranked.

Nipping on the heels of No. 1
Stanford, however, are No. 4 UCLA,
No. 7 Southern California, No. 10
Washington and cross-hay rival Cal
ifornia. which stands at No. 17.
As the spring season kicks off,
look for Panova (1-4) to fiercely de
fend her title and expect no less
from runner-up Daniela Bercek of
UCLA (4-3).
Keep your eyes on the freshman
class as well. Of the three Pac-10
players ranked in the top ten, all
are first-year competitors. No. 3
Su/.i Babos (15-1), who bested
Barnes and Deason at the ITA
Northwest Championship, South
ern California's No. 6 Nicole Le
imbach (11-3) and No. 9 Riza Za
lameda of UCLA (10-3) will be out
in full force.
Finally, look out for the Cardi
nal, whose array of seasoned and
fledgling players all hope to make
2005 another hallmark year.
"The feeling on the team is very
positive and very upbeat; we're op
timistic that we're going to be very
strong." Brennan said. "[After indi
viduals] February is full of tough
home matches and Pac-10 matches
which aren't usually on the slate. It's
going to be exciting. We're ready to
