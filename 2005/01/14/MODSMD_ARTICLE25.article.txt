## Bears fall apart in Maples 'Hurricane' Stanford rolls over Cal defense, dismantles offense 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sometimes, two teams are simply in
different leagues. During No. 6 Stan
ford's 88-53 drubbing of California
Thursday night, the 35-point margin of
victory didn't begin to express the extent
of the Cardinal women's domination.
The Golden Bears were beaten so thor
oughly that the halftime show should
have been a PETA protest.
The Cardinal showed no ill effects
from a draining road trip through Ari
zona, jumping out to an early 24-6 lead
midway through the first half. On the con
trary, Stanford seemed to have all the en-

ergy, track
ing down
loose balls
and appear
ing to need

this game more than the Golden Bears.
"Little things build on each other,
and I think that's what you saw today,"
junior Brooke Smith said. "We kept
building on made baskets and good de
fensive plays, and that just keeps the en
ergy going and makes you play better."
Although Cal has consistently elevat
ed its game against Stanford in recent
contests, Oski's troops appeared to have
mailed this one in from the opening tip.
From the outset, it was clear that the
Bears were overmatched. On the defen
sive end, Cal simply lacked the big bod
ies to match up with the likes of junior
Brooke Smith, senior T'Nae Thiel and
sophomore Kristen Newlin.
All three could be found getting post
position deep in the paint almost without
effort. As a result, the Cardinal's triangle
offense generated easy lay-ups, seeming
ly on demand.
Smith led the Cardinal with 21 points
and also contributed four rebounds.
Most impressive was Smith's efficiency
from the field, where she shot 9-of-l 1 on
the night.
When the Bears collapsed down to
help in the post, Stanford coolly sent
the ball outside to its guards, where the
Cardinal knocked down a pair of
jumpers from beyond the arc in the
first half.
If it's any consolation to Cal fans, at
least its band sounded good.
As bad as things were at the defensive
end, they were much worse on offense.
Perhaps that's why the Bears appeared
so eager to get rid of the ball by throwing
passes to Cardinal defenders or dribbling
the ball out of bounds — each of which
occurred on more than one occasion.
Two numbers from the first half could
have summed up the story about Cal's
offense on the night: turnovers: 18,
points: 17.
Yet, in some cases, statistics are inca
pable of telling the entire tale. This is one
of those cases.
To say that the Bears turned the ball
over would be like saying that Cal won the
Big Game this year. The Bears' was not
an offense that was foiled or disrupted. It
was simply lost from start to finish.
In the absence of graduated guard
Nihan Anaz, every offensive possession
for Cal was an adventure in which the
team tried to find a "go-to" player who
could generate some points.
Entering the ballgame, that player
figured to be senior Leigh Gregory, who

was the team's leading scorer last year.
Gregory scored 14 points on the night
but committed four turnovers.
Recognizing an offense in trouble,
Tara VanDerveer's defense went for the
kill, pressuring the ball at every opportu
nity. Cardinal defenders jumped into
passing lanes, intercepted long, arcing
tosses and notched an impressive 14
steals on the night.
Freshman Candice Wiggins contin
ued her shutdown defense, collecting
five steals in just 16 minutes.
"They knew our offense better than we
knew our offense," Cal coach Caren
Horstmeyer said. "They executed our of
fense better than we executed our offense."
On a night when everything seemed
to go the Cardinal's way, it was only fit
ting that former Stanford football player
Luke Powell successfully knocked down
three shots from beyond the three-point
arc during a halftime promotion.
In the second half, VanDerveer made
liberal use of her bench. 13 players saw
playing time for the Cardinal, and 12

played double-digit minutes.
"We're trying to expand our rotation
a little bit," VanDerveer said. "It was
great for our team to have different peo
ple coming in and playing well."
Among the beneficiaries of the
blowout was redshirt sophomore Ezia
maka Okafor, who scored a season-high
14 points and collected five boards in just
16 minutes on the floor.
Fifth-year senior Susan Borchardt also
made her first start of the season after
coming back from a stress fracture in her
foot that sidelined her for the early part of
the season. She was the only member of
the Cardinal to play 20 minutes on the
night and responded with 10 points on 5-
of-7 shooting from the field.
Ultimately, Horstmeyer put it best
when she walked into the post-game
press conference and told the room, "I
think a hurricane hit Maples tonight."
Stanford will try to stretch its winning
streak to six games tomorrow at 2 p.m.
when No. 14 Boston College visits the
Farm.

16 minutes on the floor.
Fifth-year senior Susan Borchardt also
made her first start of the season after
coming back from a stress fracture in her
foot that sidelined her for the early part of
the season. She was the only member of
the Cardinal to play 20 minutes on the
night and responded with 10 points on 5-
of-7 shooting from the field.
Ultimately, Horstmeyer put it best
when she walked into the post-game
press conference and told the room, "I

Stanford will try to stretch its winning
streak to six games tomorrow at 2 p.m.

Farm.

Cardinal head coach Tara VanDer/eer used her bench freely last night. Among the
13 Stanford players that hit the hardwood floors was redshirt sophomore Eziamaka
Okafor, who scored 14 points in 16 minutes.
Sometimes, two teams are simply in
different leagues. During No. 6 Stan
ford's 88-53 drubbing of California
Thursday night, the 35-point margin of
victory didn't begin to express the extent
of the Cardinal women's domination.
The Golden Bears were beaten so thor
oughly that the halftime show should
have been a PETA protest.
The Cardinal showed no ill effects
from a draining road trip through Ari
zona, jumping out to an early 24-6 lead
midway through the first half. On the con
trary, Stanford seemed to have all the en-

ergy, track
ing down
loose balls
and appear
ing to need

this game more than the Golden Bears.
"Little things build on each other,
and I think that's what you saw today,"
junior Brooke Smith said. "We kept
building on made baskets and good de
fensive plays, and that just keeps the en
ergy going and makes you play better."
Although Cal has consistently elevat
ed its game against Stanford in recent
contests, Oski's troops appeared to have
mailed this one in from the opening tip.
From the outset, it was clear that the
Bears were overmatched. On the defen
sive end, Cal simply lacked the big bod
ies to match up with the likes of junior
Brooke Smith, senior T'Nae Thiel and
sophomore Kristen Newlin.
All three could be found getting post
position deep in the paint almost without
effort. As a result, the Cardinal's triangle
offense generated easy lay-ups, seeming
ly on demand.
Smith led the Cardinal with 21 points
and also contributed four rebounds.
Most impressive was Smith's efficiency
from the field, where she shot 9-of-l 1 on
the night.
When the Bears collapsed down to
help in the post, Stanford coolly sent
the ball outside to its guards, where the
Cardinal knocked down a pair of
jumpers from beyond the arc in the
first half.
If it's any consolation to Cal fans, at
least its band sounded good.
As bad as things were at the defensive
end, they were much worse on offense.
Perhaps that's why the Bears appeared
so eager to get rid of the ball by throwing
passes to Cardinal defenders or dribbling
the ball out of bounds — each of which
occurred on more than one occasion.
Two numbers from the first half could
have summed up the story about Cal's
offense on the night: turnovers: 18,
points: 17.
Yet, in some cases, statistics are inca
pable of telling the entire tale. This is one
of those cases.
To say that the Bears turned the ball
over would be like saying that Cal won the
Big Game this year. The Bears' was not
an offense that was foiled or disrupted. It
was simply lost from start to finish.
In the absence of graduated guard
Nihan Anaz, every offensive possession
for Cal was an adventure in which the
team tried to find a "go-to" player who
could generate some points.
Entering the ballgame, that player
figured to be senior Leigh Gregory, who

was the team's leading scorer last year.
Gregory scored 14 points on the night
but committed four turnovers.
Recognizing an offense in trouble,
Tara VanDerveer's defense went for the
kill, pressuring the ball at every opportu
nity. Cardinal defenders jumped into
passing lanes, intercepted long, arcing
tosses and notched an impressive 14
steals on the night.
Freshman Candice Wiggins contin
ued her shutdown defense, collecting
five steals in just 16 minutes.
"They knew our offense better than we
knew our offense," Cal coach Caren
Horstmeyer said. "They executed our of
fense better than we executed our offense."
On a night when everything seemed
to go the Cardinal's way, it was only fit
ting that former Stanford football player
Luke Powell successfully knocked down
three shots from beyond the three-point
arc during a halftime promotion.
In the second half, VanDerveer made
liberal use of her bench. 13 players saw
playing time for the Cardinal, and 12

played double-digit minutes.
"We're trying to expand our rotation
a little bit," VanDerveer said. "It was
great for our team to have different peo
ple coming in and playing well."
Among the beneficiaries of the
blowout was redshirt sophomore Ezia
maka Okafor, who scored a season-high
14 points and collected five boards in just
16 minutes on the floor.
