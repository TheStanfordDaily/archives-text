The stage is set for tomorrow's game.
No. 14 Boston College enters stage-left.
No. 6 Stanford enters stage-right; one of the
best of the east meets one of the best of the
west. And the Stanford senior women.

night, can look for
the big 101.
The No. 6 Stan
ford women's bas
ketball team (14-2,
6-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference) takes on
the BC Eagles (12-
1, 3-0 Big East) to
morrow afternoon
in a non-divisional
matchup at Maples.
The Eagles are hot
right now, having
won 11 straight
games, including
their last game
against Villanova. a
77-63 triumph.
Stanford is com
ing off an Arizona
sweep — in which
the Cardinal
women handily de
feated both Ari
zona and No. 24

Arizona State — and a home victory over
California.
All signs indicate that Saturday's
matchup will be a heavyweight bout be
tween two top-notch offenses, with Stan
ford holding only a slight advantage.
The Cardinal offense has been more
than effective so far this season. Three Car
dinal players are averaging double digits in
points, and 10 players are contributing
more than 10 minutes a game.
Through Jan. 10, Stanford was ranked in
the national top 10 in field goal defense (34
percent), scoring margin (+20.5 points) and
won-loss percentage ( 86.7 percent).
BC has a sharp offense led by Jessalyn
Deveny (18.3 ppg), Kathrin Ress (12.3
ppg) and Brooke Queenan (12.3 ppg).
Ress is coming off a dazzling showing
against Villanova, scoring a career-high
28 points.
Forward Aja Parham, also a potent of*
fensive threat, contributed a career-high 17
points in the game.
It's hard to pinpoint or predict just
where the Stanford attack will come from,
but freshman guard Candice Wiggins leads
the team in scoring with 17.2 ppg. She
recorded a career-best 31 points at ASU
and followed that game with a 28 point
showing at Arizona, earning her Pac-10
Player of the Week honors.
Wiggins also leads Stanford with 44
steals in her debut season. (Candice's late
father, Alan, also had a knack for steals —
in helping the 1984 San Diego Padres to the
World Series he set the club's single-season
record with 70 stolen bases.)
Also leading the Cardinal in the back
court is senior guard Kelly Suminski, a
preseason Wooden award candidate,
