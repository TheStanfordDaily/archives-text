After knocking off No. 13 Arizona last
Saturday, senior center Rob Little made it
clear that the upset wasn't the start of a "big

down in two meetings last year. Powe led
the Bears with 15.1 points and 9.5 rebounds
per game, becoming the first freshman to
lead the conference in rebounding in Pac
-10 history.
The Bears also lost second-leading scor

tion. To make matters worse, sophomort
guard Ayinde Übaka has missed the past 11
games with a fractured foot. Übaka, who
was averaging 7.7 points and four assists per
game before the injury, is expected to make
his return to the lineup Saturday.
