# Golden Bears hit by injuries, key player losses, but Cal overcomes
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After knocking off No. 13 Arizona last
Saturday, senior center Rob Little made it
clear that the upset wasn't the start of a "big
party" for the Cardinal, acknowledging
there was still plenty of work to be done. So
when Stanford (7-7, 1-3 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) returned to practice on Tuesday, it
was business as usual, with all eyes focused
on Saturday's game at California (8-6,1-3).
"After two days off. they were probably
as quiet in practice as they've ever been,"
head coach Trent Johnson said during his
weekly press conference. "1 don't put too
much emphasis on being emotionally up or
down. A good win against Arizona doesn't
mean anything unless we come out and play
well on Saturday."
Fora team whose lone true road win
came at Denver, playing well at hostile
Haas Pavilion will be no easy task. Desper
ately in need of a win. it could be equally
difficult for Cal to bounce back from home
losses to Arizona and Arizona State.

But if there's one thing both schools
have learned in the first half of the season,
it's how to respond to adversity on and off
the court.
Cal's Top Dog — reigning Pac-10
Freshman of the Year Leon Powe. not the
famous hot dog haven — underwent off
season knee surgery and is out for the sea
son. Though Stanford managed to slow him
down in two meetings last year. Powe led
the Bears with 15.1 points and 9.5 rebounds
per game, becoming the first freshman to
lead the conference in rebounding in Pac
-10 history.
The Bears also lost second-leading scor
er and rebounder Amit Tamir to gradua
tion. To make matters worse, sophomort
guard Ayinde Übaka has missed the past 11
games with a fractured foot. Übaka, who
was averaging 7.7 points and four assists per
game before the injury, is expected to make
his return to the lineup Saturday.
Junior walk-on Martin Smith has played
well in Übaka's absence, teaming with ju-

nior guard Richard Midgley to form
a productive backcourt. Smith
boasts a conference-best 2.71 assist
to-turnover ratio, while Midgley —
the Bears' only true perimeter
threat besides Übaka — leads Cal
with 15.3 points per game.
"Midgley is as good a guard as
there is in this league," Johnson
said. "With the injury to Powe, guys
have been forced to get better, and
they're starting to play better."
Still, Cal head coach Ben Braun
is looking forward to having Übaka
back on the court.
"He plays solid defense, he helps
us in our transition, pushing the ball,
handling the ball," Braun said. "He
was shooting the ball as well as any
body before he got hurt. He went
out at a really tough time because of
how well he was playing."
Stanford, whose own setbacks
have been well-documented, will
counter with guards Dan Grunfeld
and Chris Hernandez, who are aver
aging 18.1 and 13.7 points per game,
respectively. The duo will have its
hands full on both ends of the floor,
containing Cal's guards and putting
up points against the Pac-10's sec
ond best scoring defense.
Braun summed up the Cardi
nal's key to success in an obvious
but accurate manner.
"They are a team that has always
played well when they shoot the ball
well," Braun said.
While hardly a profound state
ment — you can't win if you don't
score — Johnson echoed the impor
tance of his team finishing scoring
opportunities.
"We hit open shots against Ari
zona," Johnson said. "It was no dif
ferent than when we played Ari
zona State, with the exception that
the ball went down."
Stanford will need another
strong shooting performance
against Cal, particularly from its
posts. Little and junior Matt
Haryasz will be working against
the talented but less-experienced
trio of junior Rod Benson, sopho
more Marquise Kately and fresh
man DeVon Hardin.
With Powe out, Benson has

made the most of his first starting
role, averaging 12.3 points per
game while shooting nearly 60 per
cent from the field.
C'al's relative inexperience —
there are no seniors on the roster —
has shone through in Pac-10 play, as
the Bears have held second-half leads
in all three of their conference losses.

In addition to getting shots to
fall, the Cardinal's success Saturday
and in the coming weeks could de
pend on one of the buzzwords John
son has talked about all season long:
intensity.
"After Arizona, I said, 'Guys,
this is the level of intensity we need
to somehow play at," Johnson said.

Juniors Chris Hernandez and Dan Grunfeld make up a guard tandem that
that, together, averages 31.8 points per game. The two will face an equal
ly potent Cal backcourt of Ayinde Uoaka and Richard Midgley.
