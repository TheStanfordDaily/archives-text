# Perusing PA's pint-sized pub scene

### KATIE BEARMAN BARRETT W. SHERIDAN 
Just turn 21? Palo Alto and the neigh
boring towns aren't exactly world-famous
for their nightspots, but as with the girly
pop of Britney and her ilk, you can find
some catchy riffs among all the sour notes.
The Daily has done all the work for you:
where to drink, when to do it, and why
you'll never win a round of Trivia Night at
the Rose and Crown."
The Rose and Crown Pub
Where: Just one block east of University
Drive, on Emerson.
Atmosphere: A cozy British pub with
wood-paneled walls and outdoor seating
with heating lanterns. On busy nights, it is
standing-room only. Antlers and a boar's
head on the wall give it that oh-so-British
feel.
Signature Drink: Gotta be that thick-head
ed Irish lager. Guinness. The Rose and
Crown has over 20 beers on tap, although
hard alcohol drinks are few and far be
tween.

Why come? Trivia Nights every Tuesday,
where teams of four slog through seven
rounds(of 10 questions each) of arcane fac
toids. Win a round, win a round of beers for
your team. Come out on top at the end,
earn you and your teammates fish-and
chip dinners.
Sample Questions from Trivia Night: How
many units of whole blood did the Stanford
Blood Bank pull in last year? Who, in the
Bible, was cast into the lion's den? In show
jumping, how many points are incurred
when the horse refuses to jump the fence?
Testimonials: "(Trivia Night] is the kind of
thing where wise-ass Stanford kids will be
disappointed," said Gabe "Papa" Rosen, a
co-terminal student. "The knowledge base
tends to favor those over 30. But, like Char
lie Brown kicking the football, we hold out
hope."
"That just might be the excuse for why
we're not winning," says Lisa Westmore
land, another co-termer. (8.W.5.)

offering Stanford students more of a Palo Alto nightlife
than most realize.
