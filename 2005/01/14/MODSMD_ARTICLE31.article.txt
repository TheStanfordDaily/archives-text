# Tomato shortage deprives UC-San Diego students of favorite meals

### SHANNON ELIOT THE GUARDTAN (U.CALIFORNIA-SAN DIEGO 
(U-WIRE) LA JOLLA. Calif. -
Restaurateurs and sandwich afi
cionados can rest easy as the worst
stage of a two-month national toma
to shortage has passed. Attributed
to unexpected and severe weather
conditions that damaged tomato
crops, the national shortage
prompted University of California-
San Diego dining halls and other
food businesses to serve the fruit
only upon request or eliminate it
from menus altogether.
Florida and California, which con
stitute the top two fresh tomato
producing states in the nation, both
suffered unusually harsh weather
conditions this fall, which resulted
in high prices.
In Florida, the state that pro

duces virtually all of the fresh-mar
ket, field-grown tomatoes in the
country during the winter, hurri
canes damaged 65 percent of the
state's usual crop, according to the
Florida Tomato Committee.
A severe storm hitting central
California on Oct. 19 and Oct. 20
also damaged a portion of the
state's fall tomato crop and tem
porarily suspended harvest. Just
one week later, a second storm de
scended on central and southern
portions of the state, affecting near
ly all of the remaining tomato yield.
Signs stating that tomatoes
would not he served unless request
ed appeared in some dining hall
windows.
California's tomatoes come primari
ly from Baja California in the sum
mer, and from other parts of Mexico
during the winter. However, there is
often a six-week gap between the two

crop cycles that Florida typically cov
ers. Because Florida's crop was de
stroyed by various storms, tomato
prices increased and UCSD chose to
forego buying its usual quantities, ac
cording to Housing and Dining Ser
vices Associate Director Brian Klip
pel.
"Florida is usually the interim
producer, but their entire first crop
was ruined," Klippel said. "We had
to wait for the second crops to come
in [before we could start serving
normal quantities]."
Because tomatoes are funda
mental to so many dishes prepared
in the dining halls, Klippel said din
ing facilities could not eliminate
them altogether in order to save
money. While certain types of pro
duce can be replaced, tomatoes had
no alternative.
" This happens with other produce
as well, such as melons. The cost is

offset because there's other food you
can choose from," Klippel said.
"However, there is no alternative for
tomatoes. We couldn't completely
eliminate them because they are es
sential to so many things. You can't
have lasagna or a BLT without toma
toes."
He estimated that Housing and
Dining Services normally pays any
where from $10 to $12 per case of
tomatoes, with prices always slight
ly higher in the winter. Dining facil
ities currently pay around $15 to $18
per case; by contrast, during the
peak in November, the produce
costed more than $60 per case.
"There were three things we
could have done," Klippel said.
"First, we could have simply taken
the tomatoes off the market. Sec
ond, we could raise prices. Or third,
we could try a combination (of buy
ing fewer tomatoes and not offering

as manyj, which is what we did."
Klippel said students and cus
tomers have been very supportive
during the shortage, and that he has
gotten no word of any complaints.
"We generally try to keep cus
tomers informed and ask for sup
port," Klippel said. "Many students
said they could live without [toma
toes], Those who wanted them got
them, while those who could go
without did so. We never want to
raise prices if we don't have to."
Students who were aware of the
shortage said they understood the
situation.
"I had no problem acquiring
tomatoes during the shortage. 1 got
them when I wanted them," said
Revelle junior David Parkinson. "I
didn't think it was that widespread
because I didn't see the effects."
Revelle junior Gillian Siddall
said she was also aware of the

change in policy.
"I was a bit bemused because I
didn't see the tomato shortage signs
in all the dining halls on campus; 1
only saw them in Cafe Ventanas,"
Siddall said.
The highest prices and greatest
shortage came in December, when
school was out of session, Klippel
said. After school resumed, tomato
prices fell significantly as a result of
stronger tomato shipments from
Florida and Mexico.
"We did not break even by re
ducing the amount we bought, but it
wasn't as bad as it could have been."
Klippel said.
Fresh-tomato wholesale prices
averaged 99 cents per pound in No
vember, 225 percent above prices
for the same period a year earlier,
and the highest level since January
1990. according to the National
Agricultural Statistics Service.

can choose from," Klippel said.
"However, there is no alternative for
tomatoes. We couldn't completely
eliminate them because they are es
sential to so many things. You can't
have lasagna or a BLT without toma
toes."
He estimated that Housing and
Dining Services normally pays any
where from $10 to $12 per case of
tomatoes, with prices always slight
ly higher in the winter. Dining facil
ities currently pay around $15 to $18
per case; by contrast, during the
peak in November, the produce
costed more than $60 per case.
"There were three things we
could have done," Klippel said.
"First, we could have simply taken
the tomatoes off the market. Sec
ond, we could raise prices. Or third,
we could try a combination (of buy
ing fewer tomatoes and not offering

as manyj, which is what we did."
Klippel said students and cus
tomers have been very supportive
during the shortage, and that he has
gotten no word of any complaints.
"We generally try to keep cus
tomers informed and ask for sup
port," Klippel said. "Many students
said they could live without [toma
toes], Those who wanted them got
them, while those who could go
without did so. We never want to
raise prices if we don't have to."
Students who were aware of the
shortage said they understood the
situation.
"I had no problem acquiring
tomatoes during the shortage. 1 got
them when I wanted them," said
Revelle junior David Parkinson. "I
didn't think it was that widespread
because I didn't see the effects."
Revelle junior Gillian Siddall
said she was also aware of the

change in policy.
"I was a bit bemused because I
didn't see the tomato shortage signs
in all the dining halls on campus; 1
only saw them in Cafe Ventanas,"
Siddall said.
The highest prices and greatest
shortage came in December, when
school was out of session, Klippel
said. After school resumed, tomato
prices fell significantly as a result of
stronger tomato shipments from
Florida and Mexico.
"We did not break even by re
ducing the amount we bought, but it
wasn't as bad as it could have been."
Klippel said.
Fresh-tomato wholesale prices
averaged 99 cents per pound in No
vember, 225 percent above prices
for the same period a year earlier,
and the highest level since January
1990. according to the National
Agricultural Statistics Service.
(U-WIRE) LA JOLLA. Calif. -
Restaurateurs and sandwich afi
cionados can rest easy as the worst
stage of a two-month national toma
to shortage has passed. Attributed
to unexpected and severe weather
conditions that damaged tomato
crops, the national shortage
prompted University of California-
San Diego dining halls and other
food businesses to serve the fruit
only upon request or eliminate it
from menus altogether.
Florida and California, which con
stitute the top two fresh tomato
producing states in the nation, both
suffered unusually harsh weather
conditions this fall, which resulted
in high prices.
In Florida, the state that pro

duces virtually all of the fresh-mar
ket, field-grown tomatoes in the
country during the winter, hurri
canes damaged 65 percent of the
state's usual crop, according to the
Florida Tomato Committee.
A severe storm hitting central
California on Oct. 19 and Oct. 20
also damaged a portion of the
state's fall tomato crop and tem
porarily suspended harvest. Just
one week later, a second storm de
scended on central and southern
portions of the state, affecting near
ly all of the remaining tomato yield.
Signs stating that tomatoes
would not he served unless request
ed appeared in some dining hall
windows.
California's tomatoes come primari
ly from Baja California in the sum
mer, and from other parts of Mexico
during the winter. However, there is
often a six-week gap between the two

crop cycles that Florida typically cov
ers. Because Florida's crop was de
stroyed by various storms, tomato
prices increased and UCSD chose to
forego buying its usual quantities, ac
cording to Housing and Dining Ser
vices Associate Director Brian Klip
pel.
"Florida is usually the interim
producer, but their entire first crop
was ruined," Klippel said. "We had
to wait for the second crops to come
in [before we could start serving
normal quantities]."
Because tomatoes are funda
mental to so many dishes prepared
in the dining halls, Klippel said din
ing facilities could not eliminate
them altogether in order to save
money. While certain types of pro
duce can be replaced, tomatoes had
no alternative.
