# Lindbergh flew to France, but we'd say he flew to Freedom'
## 
### KATIE BERK INTERMISSION LITERARY CRIFIC 
I was first drawn to this novel in the bookstore due
to the large signs proclaiming it a work of fiction. It
seemed unnecessary to me at first, but then again, I
guess a book with the title "The Plot Against America"
could easily be confused with the recent slew of
"Dude, Where's My Country?" follow-ups. Even after
reading the book, it would be easy to believe that it is
a historical novel. With a World War II setting, a narra
tor by the same name as the author and a cast of char
acters straight out of the history books, it is clear that

fiction label is needed.
Roth only alters one small historical detail: What if
the famous aviation hero Charles Lindbergh beat
Franklin Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential election?
Now your first reaction may be to think this would lead
to a better air force and probably not much else. But
then, like me, you probably didn't know there was a
dark side to Lindbergh.
Take this description of Hitler written in his person
al journal in 1936: "He is undoubtedly a great man, and
I believe he has done much for the German people."
Or his having received the Service Cross of the Ger
man Eagle, complete with an inscription of four
swastikas, from the German government in 1938, and
later refusing to return it in order not to give "an un
necessary insult" to the Nazi party. Lindbergh, it turns
out, is the perfect villain for this novel.
This story of what happens in America between the
elections in 1940 and the bombing of Pearl Harbor
under the presidency of a man whose platform was
"Vote for Lindbergh or Vote for War" is told convinc
ingly through the eyes of a seven-year-old Jewish boy
living in Newark, N.J. The book pulsates with the fear
of a family watching the existence they took for grant
ed disappear before their eyes.
There's Roth's 12-year-old brother who can't see
why his parents don't want him to participate in a gov
ernment program that sends Jewish boys from the
city to the country to learn to farm for the summer.
There's a 20-year-old cousin who runs away to Cana
da to join the army and a mother who, even in the face
of the collapse of her country, still makes sure her
sons wear clean underwear The cast of characters is
utterly believable and adds to the memoir feel of the
book.
With the exception of a drastic change of style at the
end, the book is a thought provoking, intense read that
dares to pose the question, "Why not here?" For some
reason, though, Roth felt the need to tie up all the
loose ends in one chapter. He hands the reader a con
venient ending that settles his own question with a
pompous "because this is America and things like the
Holocaust don't happen here" answer.
