# 10 REASONS TO START WORRYING
## 
### DREW PETERSON TAM VO INTERMISSION APOCALYPTOLOGISTS 
1) Raccoons found at Crothers: Animals have a sixth sense about natural
phenomena. Upon realizing that the end of the world is upon us, raccoons
sought refuge and a suitable mating location in graduate housing. Unfortu
nately, said raccoons also detected the traces of certain summer orgies that
took place in the building's basements and quickly evacuated before authori
ties could begin videotaping.
2) Government shuts down Stanford Linear Accelerator Center's ac
celerators: Citing unkosher safety procedures that led to a "fire," safety in
spectors discover that the PEP-II collider and Ba√üar detector actually used
to blend extremely large glow-in-the-dark margaritas for Thursday night
Happy Hour.
3) Weird weather sends undergrad to Vaden for frostbite: After having
his temperature taken, student was told, "Don't be a pussy. This is Northern
California, not Siberia."
4) All DVD's at Green Library checked out: Freshman swears he was
doing in-depth research on the social and historical impact of "the seminal
film classic, 'Deep Throat.'" Hipsters all over campus sink into depression
after not being able to borrow Wes Anderson films, "Donnie Darko" and
"Waking Life."
5) Students counter low grades next quarter by taking more units:
AXESS unable to process thousands of requests to add "Beginning Poker"
and "Intro to Intro to Computers." Mikey Lee takes the cake with twenty-one
units. Proposals for Student-Initiated courses surge, ranging from 'The Poli
tics and Aesthetics of Jenna Jameson" to "What Would Jesus Do?"
6) Hundreds of "$lO for 12 issues of Playboy" ads found... all thrown
in trash: Stanford Postal Service employees baffled by students' choice of
discarded mail.
7) Resident Assistant allegedly graduating with three majors and a
coterm masters in four years: University Registrar Roger Printup unable
to print up student's extensive transcript, claims lack of ink in his Hewlett
Packard deskjet.
8) Undergrads scheme way into "For Law Students Only" Law
School Library: Two sophomores and a fifth year senior shadowed Stan
ford Law Review editors and read "Bringing Down the House" (the story of
MIT dropouts who took Vegas for millions) for inspiration. The three even
tually bought Stanford Law t-shirts from the Stanford Bookstore to gain
credibility.
9) PWR writing teacher walks out of class, for rest of quarter: Overpaid
researchers are investigating the disappearance of disgruntled teacher. Stu
dents suggest their general apathy and inability to properly cite sources in
MLA format may have contributed. Before authorities could contain PWR,
the virus was able to replicate itself, creating PWR 2.
10) Power outage:... no one noticed.
