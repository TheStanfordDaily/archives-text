## Things you can do instead of watching a Joel Schumacher film... 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION LAYOUT EDITOR 

1) Count beans


2) Walk across shattered glass


3) Put two and two together. . .


4) Gouge your eyes out
with red-hot spoons


5) Sit.. . then cry.


6) Dress up like Batman and
reenact 'Batman & Robin'.
Guaranteed to be better
than the movie.
