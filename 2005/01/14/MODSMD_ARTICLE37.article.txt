### MERRITT BAER INTERMISSION THEATER CRITIC 
The mask. The rose. The chandelier...
Yes, it's all still intact and currently
playing at a theatre near you. Unfor
tunately, it's not necessarily playing
at a real theatre, but instead at a
movie theatre near you. The latest in
the string of up-and-coming musicals
turned movies, "Phantom of the
Opera," brings the world's most prof
itable musical to the silver screen.
However, there is little silver lining for
this heavy, dragging cloud of a
movie.
Andrew Lloyd Webber's spectacle

musical has grossed over $1 billion
onstage. It has toured the world and
paved the way for new splashy, spec
tacular productions (like "Wicked").
However, the same force that drove
the musical to wild success is driving
its sister film into the ground.
"Phantom" 's storyline isn't particu
larly strong: Disfigured, ugly guy likes
a pretty, young opera singer who he
takes on as his protege and then ran
domly kills a lot of people in the opera
company claiming that he owns the

opera house,
the sewers of
which he lives
in. To make up

for weakness in plot. Cameron Mack
intosh (the show's original producer,
and producer of Cats, Les Miz, Miss
Saigon, etc.) created a spectacle on
stage that no one had ever seen be
fore. A chandelier fell from the ceiling,
candles floated out of the stage, peo
ple maneuvered small boats around
a sea of fog. All very enticing ele
ments of the spectacle that, com
bined with Webber's memorable
score, have made "Phantom" the

show it is today.
However, the excitement of
seeing candles rise from out of a
stage and a falling chandelier
isn't particularly new ground for
the world of film. The spectacle
is no longer spectacle — in
stead it's a nice but altogether
too-familiar visual effect.
Joel Schumacher (of such il
lustrious cinematic kicks to the
groin such as "Phonebooth,"
"Batman Forever" and Batman
and Robin") has directed this
film with such a lack of talent and
vision that the entire film feels
like it needs reworking. Clocking
in at under three hours, the film
reminded me why most musi
cals have a much-needed inter
mission. Schumacher's film
dragged unnecessarily. Had he
cut it by about 30 minutes, he
might have saved his aestheti
cally-pleasing film.
Gerard Butler, a British stage
actor cast in the mask-hidden
title role, gives an almost laugh-

able performance. His acting is weak,
and he lacks the dominance required
of a real-life phantom. It's no surprise
that his voice isn't anywhere near
comparable to Michael Crawford
(who played the original Phantom on
stage). Emma Rossum as Christine
does a fine job with what she's been
given here. She is delicate and beau
tiful, both in her looks and her voice,
and had she been given better direc
tion, perhaps she would have done
some wonderful work. Patrick Wil

son, last seen on Broadway in 'The
Full Monty" and who recently re
ceived many nominations for his fine
work in HBO's "Angel's in America,"
fails to impress in such a simple role
as Raoul, the "other man" in the love
triangle of the story. Other than his
boyishly good looks, I questioned
why Christine would choose him in
the end.
Of course, many movie musicals
deal with the issue of finding a way to
make the singing look natural on film.
However, where Rob Marshall's hit
"Chicago" succeeded, Schumach
er's "Phantom" fails. Each scene
feels distant and separate from the
lush, romantic music Webber has
provided. You wonder when they're
going to play the soundtrack again,
asking the actors to lip-sync to their
own voices once more (other than
Minnie Driver, who borrowed the
voice of a Broadway veteran for her
operatic acrobatics).
In the end, the film, which hasn't
fared particularly well at the box of
fice in such a strong holiday season,
just never delivers. While the cos
tumes are gorgeous (a likely Oscar
win) and some of the visual effects
are appealing, they simply cannot
rescue the sinking film. After watch
ing "Phantom," I was intrigued
enough to go back to my CD of the
musical that I hadn't seen in over 10
years. As I replayed the famous
opening chords and closed my eyes,
the answer became clear: Onstage,
"The Phantom" is unbelievable. On
film it is also unbelievable — but only
in that I didn't believe it fora moment.
