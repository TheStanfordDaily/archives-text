## Good grub in San Francisco 
### RANDY MANO INTERMISSION ALUM 
Chapeau! (1408 Clement St., French
bistro, entrees: $14-19)

You won't find a better bargain than at Cha
peau! I have tried it more than once, but each
time I feel like it's a wholly new experience,
with the expert staff and sumptuous plates.
And yet, it is (like Firefly) nestled in a quiet

stretch of the
Richmond district
that screams easy
parking and laid
back demeanor. I
know Ids of others
mightwonder about
another wel-known
French brasserie
overlooking the
Bay. Yes, ifs won
derful, but if s not re
laxing—and thafs
the key to my opti
mal City dining
experience.

Naan 'N' Curry (three locations in SF —478 O'Farrell
St., 533 Jackson St., 642 Irving St., Indian-Pakistani,
entrees: $3-7)

A guilty and smelly plea
sure, Naan 'N' Curry
serves up very cheap and
tasty meals all across
town. As you might guess,
the bread is absolutely
breathtaking (especially
the garlic), while the cur
ries can be made as spicy
as your taste buds can
handle — and then some.
Be patient if you go during
busy times, as queues are
quite likely. You will be
hard-pressed to spend
more than $10 each, even
for the hardiest of eaters.

Manora's Thai Cuisine (1600 Folsom
St., Thai, entrees: $6-12)
Even though I find the idea of taking off
shoes and sitting on floor pillows endearing
at some other Thai locales in the City, the
outstanding food, along with decent enough
service and ambience, gives this South of
Market place the edge overall. Granted, the
originality of Thai dishes is usually lacking
wherever you go — pad thai or chicken
curry, anyone? — but here you can find suf
ficient edge and plenty of fresh ingredients to
share at your table.

Town Hall (342 Howard St., New American
cuisine, entrees: $18-27)

It's a recent add to my restaurant repertoire, but
this new restaurant, infusing elements of New Eng
land and the good ol' South, has a great concept.
The atmosphere is marvelously energetic but not

noisy; the space
between the ta
bles and the brick
interior are a
huge plus; and
don't get me
started on the
food. From appe
tizer to dessert,
ask for help if you
can't decide be
tween all the de
lectable options.
But take it from
me - and I've
tried my fair
share at various
meals — some
one at your table
must try the pork
chop encrusted
with peanuts and
tasso.

Firefly (4288 24th St., Electic cuisine, entrees: ($l4-19)
Yes, so vague that "eclectic" moniker that Firefly has been given. Yet this restaurant, much like its cuisine, refuses to give in to customary
tastes and conventions. Its prix-fixe menu is a bargain for the City, and its surroundings make you feel welcome and invited to stay fora while.
Try to get the pillow-happy corner tables fora truly cozy outing. I have always left in great spirits following the several times I have tried this
restaurant tucked among Noe Valley residences.



Nicer than Wilbur Dining. Smaller, 100. Does not include Mama Carole.


Ah, finally the Pakistani / Indian divide is
overcome by none other than good ole
fashioned Amerioan capitalism.




The food is appetizing. Weeds sprouting
out of the table isn't...



I definitely used to think that "Thai" \M3s pronounced "Thyh,'
and believe me, the misunderstandings wsre heteroerotic.

Even though I find the idea of taking off
shoes and sitting on floor pillows endearing
at some other Thai locales in the City, the
outstanding food, along with decent enough
service and ambience, gives this South of
Market place the edge overall. Granted, the
originality of Thai dishes is usually lacking
wherever you go — pad thai or chicken
curry, anyone? — but here you can find suf
ficient edge and plenty of fresh ingredients to
share at your table.

Town Hall (342 Howard St., New American
cuisine, entrees: $18-27)

It's a recent add to my restaurant repertoire, but
this new restaurant, infusing elements of New Eng
land and the good ol' South, has a great concept.
The atmosphere is marvelously energetic but not

noisy; the space
between the ta
bles and the brick
interior are a
huge plus; and
don't get me
started on the
food. From appe
tizer to dessert,
ask for help if you
can't decide be
tween all the de
lectable options.
But take it from
me - and I've
tried my fair
share at various
meals — some
one at your table
must try the pork
chop encrusted
with peanuts and
tasso.

Firefly (4288 24th St., Electic cuisine, entrees: ($l4-19)
Yes, so vague that "eclectic" moniker that Firefly has been given. Yet this restaurant, much like its cuisine, refuses to give in to customary
tastes and conventions. Its prix-fixe menu is a bargain for the City, and its surroundings make you feel welcome and invited to stay fora while.
Try to get the pillow-happy corner tables fora truly cozy outing. I have always left in great spirits following the several times I have tried this
restaurant tucked among Noe Valley residences.



Nicer than Wilbur Dining. Smaller, 100. Does not include Mama Carole.


Ah, finally the Pakistani / Indian divide is
overcome by none other than good ole
fashioned Amerioan capitalism.




The food is appetizing. Weeds sprouting
out of the table isn't...



I definitely used to think that "Thai" \M3s pronounced "Thyh,'
and believe me, the misunderstandings wsre heteroerotic.
