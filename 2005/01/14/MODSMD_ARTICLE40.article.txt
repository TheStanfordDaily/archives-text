## The 						Record Bin AN INSIDE LOOK AT WHAT YOU SHOULD BE LISTENING TO FROM THE VAULTS OF INTERMISSION NIRVANA 
### SAM TANZER INTERMISSION FLANNEL WEARER 
Last April, Kurt Cobain once again
made the cover of Spin magazine.
This time, it was fora special tribute
to mark the 10-year anniversary of
his death. Given Nirvana's long si
lence following "From the Muddy
Banks of the Wishkah" and then the
disappointing "Best of' release, it's
easy to forget why the group is still
making headlines.
But Nirvana was easily the most
influential band of the '90s, and
probably the most romanticized as
well. From the periphery of Ab
erdeen, Wash., Cobain brought to
the very center of the mainstream a
deafening roar of grunge and feed
back. By the time of his death, he
had become an icon fora genera
tion, and the mark he left on rock
music is far from gone.

After the release of "Muddy Banks," it was
only a matter of time before fans started clam
oring for access to the band's unreleased
recordings. Talk of a Nirvana box set began in
1994, and bassist Krist Novoselic started com
piling materials all the way back in 1998. But
legal disputes between Cobain's bandmates
and his widow kept the project on hold for
years.
A full decade after its conception, the col
lection is finally here — and it's packaged in
gaudy metallic silver. So grapple with the cel
lophane, open the box and step back 10
years. "With the Lights Out" is Nirvana's lat
est and possibly their final release, a box set
containing three CD's, a DVD, a beautiful full
color booklet and more than 50 unreleased

recordings. But it is hardly the band's defining
statement.
The recordings are of mixed quality — a jum
bled assortment of demo tracks, live shows
and solo acoustic performances. The three-CD
collection is a chronological auditory tour
through Nirvana's history. But for those who
can wade through the filler (and there is literal
ly hours of it), there are plenty of rewards.
Disc one contains songs from the band's
pre-fame era. Ten Cap Chew" shows us the
driving force behind the band's harder songs,
and despite the poor recording quality, "About
a Girl" reminds us that this isn't just your aver
age rock band.
Put on disc two and you'll find some of Nir
vana's big hits — the set in its entirety con
tains not one, not two, but three new versions

of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" —but some of
the band's lesser known songs have just as
much force behind them. "Aneurysm" is a
perfect example of Cobain's soft-loud-soft
songwriting, full of heavy drums and even
heavier distortion.
Finally, disc three boasts some of the later
songs, among them a demo of "Heart-Shaped
Box" and a solo acoustic performance of "Pen
nyroyal Tea." Some of the set's real highlights
are on this disc —a nine-minute jam on
"Serve the Sen/ants" invites us inside the
band's creative process; Cobain gives a heart
jerking vocal performance on the unknown
"Do Re Mi; and Sappy" (elsewhere titled
"Verse Chorus Verse") is one of the best
songs the band ever released.
Inevitably, the collection ends with a solo

performance of "All Apologies." This time,
the recording is rough and Cobain's guitar
is out of tune. But despite these shortcom
ings and the utter predictability of the end
ing, it works just as well as it did on "In
Utero" more than a decade ago.
At their best, the acoustic tracks
strip away the noise and give us ac
cess to the emotional core of Nir
vana's songs. Other times, Cobain's
halfhearted guitar playing and falter
ing voice simply remind us that we
were never meant to listen to these
recordings. Hearing his voice crack in
the barely-there solo version of "Rape
Me" is just painful, and not in a good
way.
The DVD is much more fun. It starts
with nine tracks recorded in a poorly-lit
room in Novoselic's mother's house.

For some reason, Cobain sings with his
face to a wall, and the recording quality is
terrible. But there's a real feeling of authen
ticity here. This is pre-fame Nirvana. This is
the birth of grunge. Besides the first-ever
performance of "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
and an unexpectedly touching rendition of
"Seasons in the Sun" (Cobain plays drums),
the DVD offers the simple voyeuristic plea
sure of looking in at the band before the
world knew they existed. And it's downright
enjoyable.
For anyone expecting unreleased gems or
a new hit single, "With the Lights Out" is sure to
disappoint. But if you've been waiting fora
more personal look at Nirvana and a glimpse
inside Cobain's creative process, then look no
further — "With the Lights Out" is well worth
the listen. As for the $50, that's up to you.


Some bonds just don't do "business casual." And I seriously doubt they showed up for work at 9 a.m.

lection is finally here — and it's packaged in
gaudy metallic silver. So grapple with the cel
lophane, open the box and step back 10
years. "With the Lights Out" is Nirvana's lat
est and possibly their final release, a box set
containing three CD's, a DVD, a beautiful full
color booklet and more than 50 unreleased

recordings. But it is hardly the band's defining
statement.
The recordings are of mixed quality — a jum
bled assortment of demo tracks, live shows
and solo acoustic performances. The three-CD
collection is a chronological auditory tour
through Nirvana's history. But for those who
can wade through the filler (and there is literal
ly hours of it), there are plenty of rewards.
Disc one contains songs from the band's
pre-fame era. Ten Cap Chew" shows us the
driving force behind the band's harder songs,
and despite the poor recording quality, "About
a Girl" reminds us that this isn't just your aver
age rock band.
Put on disc two and you'll find some of Nir
vana's big hits — the set in its entirety con
tains not one, not two, but three new versions

of "Smells Like Teen Spirit" —but some of
the band's lesser known songs have just as
much force behind them. "Aneurysm" is a
perfect example of Cobain's soft-loud-soft
songwriting, full of heavy drums and even
heavier distortion.
Finally, disc three boasts some of the later
songs, among them a demo of "Heart-Shaped
Box" and a solo acoustic performance of "Pen
nyroyal Tea." Some of the set's real highlights
are on this disc —a nine-minute jam on
"Serve the Sen/ants" invites us inside the
band's creative process; Cobain gives a heart
jerking vocal performance on the unknown
"Do Re Mi; and Sappy" (elsewhere titled
"Verse Chorus Verse") is one of the best
songs the band ever released.
Inevitably, the collection ends with a solo

performance of "All Apologies." This time,
the recording is rough and Cobain's guitar
is out of tune. But despite these shortcom
ings and the utter predictability of the end
ing, it works just as well as it did on "In
Utero" more than a decade ago.
At their best, the acoustic tracks
strip away the noise and give us ac
cess to the emotional core of Nir
vana's songs. Other times, Cobain's
halfhearted guitar playing and falter
ing voice simply remind us that we
were never meant to listen to these
recordings. Hearing his voice crack in
the barely-there solo version of "Rape
Me" is just painful, and not in a good
way.
The DVD is much more fun. It starts
with nine tracks recorded in a poorly-lit
room in Novoselic's mother's house.

For some reason, Cobain sings with his
face to a wall, and the recording quality is
terrible. But there's a real feeling of authen
ticity here. This is pre-fame Nirvana. This is
the birth of grunge. Besides the first-ever
performance of "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
and an unexpectedly touching rendition of
"Seasons in the Sun" (Cobain plays drums),
the DVD offers the simple voyeuristic plea
sure of looking in at the band before the
world knew they existed. And it's downright
enjoyable.
For anyone expecting unreleased gems or
a new hit single, "With the Lights Out" is sure to
disappoint. But if you've been waiting fora
more personal look at Nirvana and a glimpse
inside Cobain's creative process, then look no
further — "With the Lights Out" is well worth
the listen. As for the $50, that's up to you.


Some bonds just don't do "business casual." And I seriously doubt they showed up for work at 9 a.m.


Last April, Kurt Cobain once again
made the cover of Spin magazine.
This time, it was fora special tribute
to mark the 10-year anniversary of
his death. Given Nirvana's long si
lence following "From the Muddy
Banks of the Wishkah" and then the
disappointing "Best of' release, it's
easy to forget why the group is still
making headlines.
But Nirvana was easily the most
influential band of the '90s, and
probably the most romanticized as
well. From the periphery of Ab
erdeen, Wash., Cobain brought to
the very center of the mainstream a
deafening roar of grunge and feed
back. By the time of his death, he
had become an icon fora genera
tion, and the mark he left on rock
music is far from gone.

After the release of "Muddy Banks," it was
only a matter of time before fans started clam
oring for access to the band's unreleased
recordings. Talk of a Nirvana box set began in
1994, and bassist Krist Novoselic started com
piling materials all the way back in 1998. But
legal disputes between Cobain's bandmates
and his widow kept the project on hold for
years.
