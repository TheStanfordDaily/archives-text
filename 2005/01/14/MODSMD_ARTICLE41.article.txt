# ROXY SASS: YOUR NEWEST UAC ADVISOR
## You'll be declaring a major in no time (and by declaring, we mean moaning) 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
More important than decidina on a major is deciding on who
could give you a major orgasm. So before you can proceed to lying
on your left side witn one lea over his rignt shoulder, you need to
know who is worth these bodily contortions and who isn't. Roxy re
alizes it's up to her to provide trie Stanford students with a basic but
extremely effective how-to-know-who-to-screw guide, organized by
MAJOR (see also cross-listings under FUTURE EARNINGS EX
PECTANCY as well as UGLY but SMART and PERSONABLE).

The Humßio major
Luckily there is a plethora of
these socially conscious, sci
ence-based guys. And with the
same dedication they had put
forth in getting through the core,
they will put forth even more in
getting through your core —
while making sure everything is
okay along the way due to their
thorough ethics training. Be
lieve Roxy, those future doctors
know what to do with their
hands and mouths, steering
with expertise from soft spot to
softer spot with their HARD de-

termination. Plus, if you're not feeling well the
morning after from a hangover, they can fix
you right up ... and then press the issue gen
tly in making sure you're the big-O kind of
OoooK.

The CS
major
Just dont even
bother. Unless
your nipples
make perfect Is
and Os, and you
just want to be
lightly tapped
down there the
way he treats his
keyboard, his
glasses will be too
fogged up to be
able to pleasure
you properly. Un
fortunately, not

only of his own fault, chances
are the only pointers heU be
managing will be his own
humming hardware.

So there you have it. A quick rundown of some things to look for
at a party when you find a cute guy and in the awkward giddiness
following an introduction, ask, "So what's your major?" Like Roxy,
you need to not waste time on undergrads who may be sub-par, and
instead find the dearees that will heat up your bedroom with more
than just intellectual stimulation.

The Psych major
Steer clear of this one. They'll always want to
know what you're thinking and Roxy, like you,
doesn't want to talk. She wants to screw — no
discussion. Also, who wants your questions to al
ways be answered with another question, any
way? Example: You: "So .. .<giggle>... did you
have a good time last night?" Psych Major:
<contemplative pause> "Did YOU have a good
time last night?" Ugh. There went your self-es
teem. And sexual prowess.

The Econ major 1
There are two types you may come across: 1) The overachiever
nerd, and 2) The go-getter. The first will always put investment
banking before you and, being fast-paced, will rush through mun-

Dane activity (a.k.a. foreplay) to pump at you like a little jackrabbit before power napping for two hours
and getting back to his problem set.
The second, on the other hand, will be a true businessman — the kind of guy who will make sure
his supply will have you maximizing your utility and intersecting at all the pleasure points possible.
Sensitive to client demand and open to suggestions and new policies, this one's the best for trying out
all those fantasies the Humßio guy found immoral and the Psych guy attributed to issues from child
hood (MAJOR turn-off).

The Communication major

A sure bet. Chances are this
one's athletic (okay, let's say it, a
Stanford athlete), and though not
necessarily an intellectual, he will
pound you with the force of the
linebacker that he is on a Saturday
football field, 'till you'll be left hap
pily sore and 10 pounds lighter.
You were failing Pilates and Kick
boxing anyway.


"Want to leam something about your anatomy?"


"You touched my tra-b-la."


'Darling, I'm your prisoner of Icwe — you can be my
guard any day."



Who says Comm majors can't make money?


"Baby, fll take cane of those supply-demand
ajrves all night long, for maximum benefits."

There are two types you may come across: 1) The overachiever
nerd, and 2) The go-getter. The first will always put investment
banking before you and, being fast-paced, will rush through mun-

Dane activity (a.k.a. foreplay) to pump at you like a little jackrabbit before power napping for two hours
and getting back to his problem set.
The second, on the other hand, will be a true businessman — the kind of guy who will make sure
his supply will have you maximizing your utility and intersecting at all the pleasure points possible.
Sensitive to client demand and open to suggestions and new policies, this one's the best for trying out
all those fantasies the Humßio guy found immoral and the Psych guy attributed to issues from child
hood (MAJOR turn-off).

The Communication major

A sure bet. Chances are this
one's athletic (okay, let's say it, a
Stanford athlete), and though not
necessarily an intellectual, he will
pound you with the force of the
linebacker that he is on a Saturday
football field, 'till you'll be left hap
pily sore and 10 pounds lighter.
You were failing Pilates and Kick
boxing anyway.


"Want to leam something about your anatomy?"


"You touched my tra-b-la."


'Darling, I'm your prisoner of Icwe — you can be my
guard any day."



Who says Comm majors can't make money?


"Baby, fll take cane of those supply-demand
ajrves all night long, for maximum benefits."
More important than decidina on a major is deciding on who
could give you a major orgasm. So before you can proceed to lying
on your left side witn one lea over his rignt shoulder, you need to
know who is worth these bodily contortions and who isn't. Roxy re
alizes it's up to her to provide trie Stanford students with a basic but
extremely effective how-to-know-who-to-screw guide, organized by
MAJOR (see also cross-listings under FUTURE EARNINGS EX
PECTANCY as well as UGLY but SMART and PERSONABLE).

The Humßio major
Luckily there is a plethora of
these socially conscious, sci
ence-based guys. And with the
same dedication they had put
forth in getting through the core,
they will put forth even more in
getting through your core —
while making sure everything is
okay along the way due to their
thorough ethics training. Be
lieve Roxy, those future doctors
know what to do with their
hands and mouths, steering
with expertise from soft spot to
softer spot with their HARD de-

termination. Plus, if you're not feeling well the
morning after from a hangover, they can fix
you right up ... and then press the issue gen
tly in making sure you're the big-O kind of
OoooK.

The CS
major
Just dont even
bother. Unless
your nipples
make perfect Is
and Os, and you
just want to be
lightly tapped
down there the
way he treats his
keyboard, his
glasses will be too
fogged up to be
able to pleasure
you properly. Un
fortunately, not

only of his own fault, chances
are the only pointers heU be
managing will be his own
humming hardware.

So there you have it. A quick rundown of some things to look for
at a party when you find a cute guy and in the awkward giddiness
following an introduction, ask, "So what's your major?" Like Roxy,
you need to not waste time on undergrads who may be sub-par, and
instead find the dearees that will heat up your bedroom with more
than just intellectual stimulation.

The Psych major
Steer clear of this one. They'll always want to
know what you're thinking and Roxy, like you,
doesn't want to talk. She wants to screw — no
discussion. Also, who wants your questions to al
ways be answered with another question, any
way? Example: You: "So .. .<giggle>... did you
have a good time last night?" Psych Major:
<contemplative pause> "Did YOU have a good
time last night?" Ugh. There went your self-es
teem. And sexual prowess.
