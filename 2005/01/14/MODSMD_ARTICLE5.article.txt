# Stanford Hospital Adds 4D Image Machine for Heart Care
## 
### NILA BALA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"When this machine became
available, it was a no-brainer to
make the purchase," said Stanford
Hospital's Echo Lab Director, In
gela Schnittger, referring to the lab's
recent purchase of two new Philips
iF.33 echocardiography systems.
The cardiovascular echo ma
chines allow doctors to obtain clear
4D images of the heart. This means
doctors can view slices of the heart,
trace the blood flow through a whole
cardiac cycle, and utilize other pow
erful applications which formerly re

quired internal or surgical proce
dures.
In purchasing the first iE33 pro
duced in the world, Stanford Hospi
tal is simply continuing a long-stand
ing tradition of being on the cutting
edge.
"Stanford's echo lab has always
been in the forefront in seeking to
acquire state of the art technology,"
said Dr. Schnittger. "The lab has ex
isted for over 30 years — basically as
long as ultrasound technology has
been around. We have been working
with the industry since then, giving
them feedback and input to obtain
new technology."

The input that facilities like Stan
ford have given Philips has made the
new model more ergonomically
friendly. Dr. David Liang, a cardiol
ogist at the hospital, explained that
the previous model caused 10 to 20
percent of sonographers (who oper
ate the machine on a daily basis) to
experience stress-related injuries.
"The sonographers often have to
hold heavy probes still for long peri
ods of time," Liang said. "Philips has
responded and redesigned the inter
face so it is more flexible with in
creased mobility to solve that prob
lem."
In addition to improving the lives
of the sonographers, the new model
makes the hospital experience sig
nificantly faster and more efficient
for patients as well.
"The iE33s enable a faster proce
dure," said business manager for the
lab. Dr. Jerry Birk. "There's usually
a historical backlog of patients wait
ing fora diagnosis, but that's no
longer the case. Getting in is much
faster and the care once you're in is
better as well."
Dr. Liang added that not only can
the revolutionary machine diagnose
more patients faster, the new model
can assess the 10 percent of patients
who, because of hyperinflated lungs
or obesity, could not be diagnosed
conclusively with the old model.
"One of my patients was an over
weight, 400-pound man who experi
enced heart failure," he said. "The
doctors in Stockton couldn't figure
out what was wrong for two years. In
April of last year, a probe had to be

placed down his throat to detect that
a valve in his heart had been leaking.
The diagnosis could have been made
two years earlier, without the intru
sive procedure, if this Philips ma
chine had existed."
While the doctors remain opti
mistic about such potential applica
tions for the machine, there are tech
nical issues left to be resolved.
"We are having problems inte
grating the data, which is all trans
mitted through Ethernet," Dr. Liang
said. "The new machine has out
stripped the old machines and we ac
tually can't handle all the data it's
producing yet. Another problem un
derlying the new model is that it runs
on Windows and takes more time to
boot up."
Although the machines reduce
the hospital's overall patient over
load. not every patient will experi
ence the advantages of the new ma
chines immediately.
"Since we only have two. we have
to pick and choose when we use the
machine," Dr. Liang said. "Ulti

mately, however, we hope to have
this imaging ability for all our pa
tients."
All in all. the doctors are ex
tremely pleased with the iE33 and
are hopeful for its future.
"I'm pretty convinced the ma
chine will make a difference," said
Dr. Liang. "Exactly how much it'll
do remains to he seen."

Although the machines reduce

chines immediately.
"Since we only have two. we have
to pick and choose when we use the
machine," Dr. Liang said. "Ulti

mately, however, we hope to have
this imaging ability for all our pa
tients."
All in all. the doctors are ex
tremely pleased with the iE33 and
are hopeful for its future.
"I'm pretty convinced the ma
chine will make a difference," said
Dr. Liang. "Exactly how much it'll
do remains to he seen."

"When this machine became
available, it was a no-brainer to
make the purchase," said Stanford
Hospital's Echo Lab Director, In
gela Schnittger, referring to the lab's
recent purchase of two new Philips
iF.33 echocardiography systems.
The cardiovascular echo ma
chines allow doctors to obtain clear
4D images of the heart. This means
doctors can view slices of the heart,
trace the blood flow through a whole
cardiac cycle, and utilize other pow
erful applications which formerly re

quired internal or surgical proce
dures.
In purchasing the first iE33 pro
duced in the world, Stanford Hospi
tal is simply continuing a long-stand
ing tradition of being on the cutting
edge.
"Stanford's echo lab has always
been in the forefront in seeking to
acquire state of the art technology,"
said Dr. Schnittger. "The lab has ex
isted for over 30 years — basically as
long as ultrasound technology has
been around. We have been working
with the industry since then, giving
them feedback and input to obtain
new technology."

The input that facilities like Stan
ford have given Philips has made the
new model more ergonomically
friendly. Dr. David Liang, a cardiol
ogist at the hospital, explained that
the previous model caused 10 to 20
percent of sonographers (who oper
ate the machine on a daily basis) to
experience stress-related injuries.
"The sonographers often have to
hold heavy probes still for long peri
ods of time," Liang said. "Philips has
responded and redesigned the inter
face so it is more flexible with in
creased mobility to solve that prob
lem."
In addition to improving the lives
of the sonographers, the new model
makes the hospital experience sig
nificantly faster and more efficient
for patients as well.
"The iE33s enable a faster proce
dure," said business manager for the
lab. Dr. Jerry Birk. "There's usually
a historical backlog of patients wait
ing fora diagnosis, but that's no
longer the case. Getting in is much
faster and the care once you're in is
better as well."
Dr. Liang added that not only can
the revolutionary machine diagnose
more patients faster, the new model
can assess the 10 percent of patients
who, because of hyperinflated lungs
or obesity, could not be diagnosed
conclusively with the old model.
"One of my patients was an over
weight, 400-pound man who experi
enced heart failure," he said. "The
doctors in Stockton couldn't figure
out what was wrong for two years. In
April of last year, a probe had to be

placed down his throat to detect that
a valve in his heart had been leaking.
The diagnosis could have been made
two years earlier, without the intru
sive procedure, if this Philips ma
chine had existed."
While the doctors remain opti
mistic about such potential applica
tions for the machine, there are tech
nical issues left to be resolved.
"We are having problems inte
grating the data, which is all trans
mitted through Ethernet," Dr. Liang
said. "The new machine has out
stripped the old machines and we ac
tually can't handle all the data it's
producing yet. Another problem un
derlying the new model is that it runs
on Windows and takes more time to
boot up."
Although the machines reduce
the hospital's overall patient over
load. not every patient will experi
