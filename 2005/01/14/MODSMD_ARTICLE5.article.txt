"When this machine became
available, it was a no-brainer to
make the purchase," said Stanford
Hospital's Echo Lab Director, In
gela Schnittger, referring to the lab's
recent purchase of two new Philips
iF.33 echocardiography systems.
The cardiovascular echo ma
chines allow doctors to obtain clear
4D images of the heart. This means
doctors can view slices of the heart,
trace the blood flow through a whole
cardiac cycle, and utilize other pow
erful applications which formerly re

quired internal or surgical proce
dures.
In purchasing the first iE33 pro
duced in the world, Stanford Hospi
tal is simply continuing a long-stand
ing tradition of being on the cutting
edge.
"Stanford's echo lab has always
been in the forefront in seeking to
acquire state of the art technology,"
said Dr. Schnittger. "The lab has ex
isted for over 30 years â€” basically as
long as ultrasound technology has
been around. We have been working
with the industry since then, giving
them feedback and input to obtain
new technology."

The input that facilities like Stan
ford have given Philips has made the
new model more ergonomically
friendly. Dr. David Liang, a cardiol
ogist at the hospital, explained that
the previous model caused 10 to 20
percent of sonographers (who oper
ate the machine on a daily basis) to
experience stress-related injuries.
"The sonographers often have to
hold heavy probes still for long peri
ods of time," Liang said. "Philips has
responded and redesigned the inter
face so it is more flexible with in
