Madonna does it. Gwyneth
does it. Countless other celebrities
have touted the physical benefits
they receive from yoga or Pilates,
echoed by what seems like a na
tionwide obsession with two for
merly obscure forms of exercise.
More and more students at
Stanford can be seen around cam
pus with a yoga mat under one
arm. heading toward yoga and Pi
lates classes.
But on campus, yoga isn't just
practiced in the gym. It is also a
topic of study this quarter. The

often-ignored philosophical as
pect of yoga will be addressed in
"Ancient Indian Yoga-Philoso
phy and Practice," a new class
this quarter sponsored by the
Hindu Student Council.
Currently, yoga and Pilates
classes are offered by the Athlet
ic Department for one credit, at a
cost of $15 per quarter. However,
student interest and space con
straints have limited the classes to
lottery-only, with a system of pri

names.
Local alternatives include Stan
ford Aerobics and Yoga (SAY), a
program open to all members of the
Stanford community. SAY offers
several aerobic classes as well as
yoga for $50 per quarter or $120 per
year.
Nanci Conniff, who teaches both
yoga and Pilates at Stanford through
the Athletics Department, says that
the rise in student interest has been
exponential. She says the Athletic
Department was in the process of in
troducing one yoga class when she
came to teach five years ago. Now.
there are eight yoga sessions and five
Pilates sessions.
Space at Roble Gym is limited,
with instructors often taking more
students than they anticipated, but
Conniff foresees increased enroll
ment when the classes move to the
Arrillaga Family Recreation Center,
which opens next year.
Traditionally, yoga has included
both spiritual and physical compo
nents. Pilates, although based loose
ly on yoga, is mostly a physical exer
cise. Conniff believes most students
are attracted to yoga for both spiritu
al and physical reasons.
"Yoga is a great preventative for
a lot of chaos in society," she said.
"It's calming. Other students come

in wanting flexibility, and everything
else just happens. This is a PE pro
gram. hut yoga without a spiritual
side isn't yoga."
Freshman Meg Hahn agrees.
"I wanted the flexibility and bal
ance that I had lost during surgery
for scoliosis," she said. "I didn't take
yoga last quarter for the spiritual as
pect, but it was a nice benefit. I came
out of the class feeling refreshed — I
always felt better after yoga."
"Ancient Indian Yoga: Philoso
phy and Practice" is a new class con
sisting of one hour of theory and one
hour of actual practice. Graduate
student Somik Raha. the coordina
tor of the class for the Hindu Student
Council, says that the new class will
introduce advanced breathing tech
niques that will be used as a precur
sor to meditation.
"Breathing is effective in making
the body efficient," he said. "There's
a lot of science behind breathing.
Learning to breathe can help you
with everything from athletics to
emotional situations. It sounds like
magic, but it's not — the main object
is to be happy."
The class will be taught by ad
vanced practitioner Vinod Rao from
Yoga Bharati. an international yoga
group. Rao says that the main differ
ence between the new class and

Trendy exercises help
students reduce stress

other classes is its comprehensive
ness.
"It'scomplete," he said. "We em
phasize better control over mind and
body. By controlling your breathing,
you can control your mind, and the
focus you learn can apply in day-to
day activities such as school or
work."
Rao also says that the new class
will teach relaxation techniques,
which will help students learn how to
reduce stress in daily life and con
serve energy. In addition to practice,
he believes that the theory compo
nent will give students a better un
derstanding of yoga and the many
ways it can improve people's lives.
"Yoga helped me personally. I
originally learned yoga because I
was suffering from many ailments,
and it helped me so much that 1
wanted to go out and share it so it can
help others," he said.
"Ancient Indian Yoga-Philoso
phy and Practice" begins tomorrow
in Roble Parlor in Roble Hall at 4:00
p.m. Classes are free, but students
wishing to take the class for credit
must also enroll in a directed reading
on Hinduism and submit a paper on
their learning at the end of the quar

body. By controlling your breathing,
you can control your mind, and the
focus you learn can apply in day-to
day activities such as school or
work."
Rao also says that the new class
will teach relaxation techniques,
which will help students learn how to
reduce stress in daily life and con

he believes that the theory compo

derstanding of yoga and the many
ways it can improve people's lives.

Local alternatives include Stan
ford Aerobics and Yoga (SAY), a
program open to all members of the
Stanford community. SAY offers
several aerobic classes as well as
yoga for $50 per quarter or $120 per
year.
Nanci Conniff, who teaches both
yoga and Pilates at Stanford through
the Athletics Department, says that
the rise in student interest has been
exponential. She says the Athletic
Department was in the process of in
troducing one yoga class when she
came to teach five years ago. Now.
there are eight yoga sessions and five
Pilates sessions.
Space at Roble Gym is limited,
with instructors often taking more
students than they anticipated, but
Conniff foresees increased enroll
ment when the classes move to the
Arrillaga Family Recreation Center,
which opens next year.
Traditionally, yoga has included
both spiritual and physical compo
nents. Pilates, although based loose
ly on yoga, is mostly a physical exer
cise. Conniff believes most students
are attracted to yoga for both spiritu
al and physical reasons.
"Yoga is a great preventative for
a lot of chaos in society," she said.
"It's calming. Other students come

in wanting flexibility, and everything
else just happens. This is a PE pro
gram. hut yoga without a spiritual
side isn't yoga."
Freshman Meg Hahn agrees.
"I wanted the flexibility and bal
ance that I had lost during surgery
for scoliosis," she said. "I didn't take
yoga last quarter for the spiritual as
pect, but it was a nice benefit. I came
out of the class feeling refreshed — I
always felt better after yoga."
"Ancient Indian Yoga: Philoso
phy and Practice" is a new class con
sisting of one hour of theory and one
hour of actual practice. Graduate
student Somik Raha. the coordina
tor of the class for the Hindu Student
Council, says that the new class will
introduce advanced breathing tech
niques that will be used as a precur
sor to meditation.
"Breathing is effective in making
the body efficient," he said. "There's
a lot of science behind breathing.
Learning to breathe can help you
with everything from athletics to
emotional situations. It sounds like
magic, but it's not — the main object
is to be happy."
