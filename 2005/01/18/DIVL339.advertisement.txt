How do we make decisions good and
bad and why are some people so much
better at it than others? Thats the question
Malcolm Gladwell asks and answers in the
follow-up to his huge bestseller, The
Tipping Point. Utilizing case studies as
diverse as speed dating, pop music, and the
shooting of Amadou Diallo, Gladwell
reveals that what we think of as decisions
made in the blink of an eye are much more
complicated than assumed. Drawing on
cutting edge neuroscience and psychology,
he shows how the difference between good
decisionmaking and bad has nothing to do
with how much information we can process
quickly, but on the few particular details on
which we focus. Leaping boldly from
example to example, displaying all of the
brilliance that made The Tipping Point a
classic, Gladwell reveals how we can
become better decision makers in our
homes, our offices, and in everyday life. The
result is a book that is surprising and trans
forming. Never again will you think about
thinking the same way.
Malcolm Gladwell's last book, The Tipping
Point, was a New York Times bestseller.
From 1987 to 1996, Malcolm Gladwell was
a reporter for The Washington Post, first as
a science writer and then as New York City
bureau chief. Since 1996, he has been a staff
writer for The New Yorker magazine.

How do we make decisions good and
bad and why are some people so much
better at it than others? Thats the question
Malcolm Gladwell asks and answers in the
follow-up to his huge bestseller, The
Tipping Point. Utilizing case studies as
diverse as speed dating, pop music, and the
shooting of Amadou Diallo, Gladwell
reveals that what we think of as decisions
made in the blink of an eye are much more
complicated than assumed. Drawing on
cutting edge neuroscience and psychology,
he shows how the difference between good
decisionmaking and bad has nothing to do
with how much information we can process
quickly, but on the few particular details on
which we focus. Leaping boldly from
example to example, displaying all of the
brilliance that made The Tipping Point a
classic, Gladwell reveals how we can
become better decision makers in our
homes, our offices, and in everyday life. The
result is a book that is surprising and trans
forming. Never again will you think about
thinking the same way.
Malcolm Gladwell's last book, The Tipping
Point, was a New York Times bestseller.
From 1987 to 1996, Malcolm Gladwell was
a reporter for The Washington Post, first as
a science writer and then as New York City
bureau chief. Since 1996, he has been a staff
writer for The New Yorker magazine.
