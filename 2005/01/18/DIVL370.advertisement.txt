r you.
It isn't always clear to people at first that they're right for the
D. E. Shaw group. Like the poetry M.I .A. we hired to head an
automated block trading unit. ()r the woman who designs
solar-powered race cars; we hired her to help launch a new
venture in computational chemistry. They didn't think of
themselves as "financial types," and neither did we. We
thought of them as people with extraordinary talent.
The I). E. Shaw group is an investment and technology
development firm. Since 1988 we've grown into a number
of closely related entities with more than US $10 billion
in aggregate capital hy hiring smart people from a wide
range of backgrounds and letting them implement—and
manage—what they invent. A robotics guru. A nationally
ranked blackjack player. An operatic mezzo-soprano. And
a lot of people who are just exceptionally strong in CS, EE,
math, and finance.
The firm currently has openings in quantitative analysis, soft
ware development, information technology, computer archi
tecture, business development, computational chemistry,
accounting, finance, and trading. We're looking for creative
but pragmatic people: articulate, curious, and driven. Our
working environment is intense but surprisingly casual. We
provide unusual opportunities for growth. And we compensate
extraordinary people extraordinarily well.
The D. E. Shaw group will be attending the Spring
Computer Forum Wednesday, January 19, from 10:00
am to 4:00 pm in the lawn area between David
Packard Electrical Engineering Building and Gates
Computer Science Building. Please stop by our booth.
