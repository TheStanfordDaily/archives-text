# Date rape hoax circulates campus

Progesterex. It's a small steril
ization pill used in combination
with Rohypnol, a date-rape drug,
to rape and sterilize female vic
tims. at least according to messages
circulating in e-mails and on The
facebook.com. Whoever started
the resurgence of this urban legend
— which, according to Internet
truth miners and hoax reporters,
began in 1999 — must have mis
read the calendar, because it's not
April Ist quite yet.
"The story is false, and the facts
are incorrect," said Ralph Castro,
alcohol and drug educator at the
Vaden Student Health Center,
who noted that a similar e-mail was
circulated three years ago. "There
is no such drug as Progesterex."
He directed students to verify
for themselves at www.snopes.com.
Upon learning of the Prog
esterex e-mail from The Daily,
staff from the California Coalition
Against Sexual Assault (C'AL
CASA) researched the issue and
also confirmed that it is a hoax.
"I'm not certain why people cre
ate these e-mail hoaxes," said Don
novan Somera Yisrael, community
health specialist at Vaden. "Some
of my colleagues think that it is
done so that women are more
afraid of going out, men and dat
ing. It is clearly a problem because

some of the included information
concerning date rape and Rohyp
nol is true, but when people feel
that they have been deceived they
are more distrustful and may not
look for other information."
Several peer health educators,
also known as PHEs. distributed
the Progesterex e-mail to dorm
lists. Kate Bedford, peer health co
ordinator at Vaden. supported the
good intentions of the PHEs in
protecting student safety.
"|This e-mailj is a hoax, howev
er it is a hoax that plays on our
fears," Bedford said. "1 encourage
PHEs to be aware of risks students
face and to become well-acquaint
ed with www.snopes.com."
Many Stanford students, espe
cially females, said they have been
concerned by the e-mail.
"1 think that the general atti
tude of the e-mail is one that is
highly harmful and damaging to
women's sense of confidence and
safety, even though the e-mail it
self is purportedly intended to
'warn' or help' potential victims,"
said senior Susan Su, who serves as
the sexual assault program coordi
nator for Stanford Women's Com
munity Center and an officer of
the Stanford Women's Coalition.
"The key is that the e-mail,
short as it is, sends a much more
complex and mal-intentioned mes
sage than a protective warning for

college women. Its underlying
premise is that all women are po
tential victims and that all men are
potential violent criminals," Su
said.
Su dismissed this premise but
added that she worried the impact
of the hoax could perpetuate a
"self-fulfilling prophecy" about
genders and date-rape.
Intersorority Council President
Alex Davies, a senior, said she was
previously unaware of the hoax,
but that she was concerned about
its potential consequences.
"While I don't anticipate Prog
esterex becoming a huge issue on
campus once people realize it is a
hoax, it is yet another reminder
that women need to take every pre
caution to ensure their safety,"
Davies said.
Manv students have come to re

gard such stories with a skeptical
eye.
"I received the e-mail through
Thefacehook.com several times,
and I was suspicious it was a hoax,"
said freshman Danielle Wong.
"Regardless, people should be
aware that drugging drinks is a
pretty common occurrence, and we
should he cautious about accepting
drinks and food from others."
Robert Schaffer, a doctoral
student in electrical engineering,
said that the hoax was "very up
setting," but that its impact was
blunted by the fact that "there
are many scary stories that are
usually fake."
Nonetheless, Marybeth Carter,
the executive director of CAL
CASA, said that some benefit
could result from the Progesterex
e-mail.
"The positive aspect of this e
mail is that it provokes people to
think and talk about sexual vio
lence as a real factor in campus
life," she said.
Senior Lija McHugh, ISC vice
president and a member of Kappa
Alpha Theta, also acknowledged
that the hoax could have an unin
tended positive impact.
"I think this e-mail will affect
other women as it affected me,"
McHugh said. "It caused fear and
concern, which may or may not be
fully grounded in accurate infor
mation. but nonetheless it will rein
force safety policies and proce
dures and will hopefully remind
women to always look out for each
other and to be careful."
The hoax hits other campuses
Because schools are more con
nected than ever via e-mail and in
novations like Thefacebook.com,
the hoax has had a nationwide
resurgence.
Students at other universities
also received the warnings about
Progesterex, only to discover
through follow-up e-mails that the
story was untrue.
"I received the e-mail from
both people at USC and people at

Students at USC, Columbia
also received false warning

other universities," University of
California alumnus Jason Scott
said. "For all of the e-mails, I re
ceived a follow-up soon afterwards
when the sender has discovered
that the e-mail was a hoax. There
are a number of resources on the
internet that track hoaxes and
urban legends that travel around
as spam, and if I read something
that sounds that serious, but plau
sibly incorrect, I research it on
those sites."
"Everyone at USC was pretty
worked up about this message for
about a day or two earlier this
week," said USC sophomore Ash
ley Prosper. "But as news of it
being a hoax surfaced, it became
sort of a 'who's in the know" thing
where you were really on top of it
if you knew the story to be a hoax
and very out of the loop if you still
believed it."
"I think it's ridiculous that
someone would start an e-mail like
this," said USC sophomore Adri
enne Lemon. "Its sole purpose
seems to be to scare females. We
do have a lot more control over
what happens to us than the writ
ers of the message would have us
believe."
Similar e-mail warnings have
also been received at Columbia
University, according to "Go Ask
Alice!," the health question-and
answer Internet service produced
by a division of Health Services at
Columbia.
The professional health educa
tors at "Go Ask Alice!" had some
suggestions to offer the person who
started circulating the false infor
mation about Progesterex:
"This current situation certainly
seems like a hoax; its creator(s)
might be reading this, laughing,
and basking in his / her / their fif
teen minutes of Internet fame. If
so, there are some other things you
might try when you next find your
self with some time on your hands:
teach disadvantaged kids to read:
volunteer at a soup kitchen; raise
money for earthquake victims; or
just take a nap."
