Progesterex. It's a small steril
ization pill used in combination
with Rohypnol, a date-rape drug,
to rape and sterilize female vic
tims. at least according to messages
circulating in e-mails and on The
facebook.com. Whoever started
the resurgence of this urban legend
— which, according to Internet
truth miners and hoax reporters,
began in 1999 — must have mis
read the calendar, because it's not
April Ist quite yet.
"The story is false, and the facts
are incorrect," said Ralph Castro,
alcohol and drug educator at the
Vaden Student Health Center,
who noted that a similar e-mail was
circulated three years ago. "There
is no such drug as Progesterex."
He directed students to verify
for themselves at www.snopes.com.
Upon learning of the Prog
esterex e-mail from The Daily,
staff from the California Coalition
Against Sexual Assault (C'AL
CASA) researched the issue and
also confirmed that it is a hoax.
"I'm not certain why people cre
ate these e-mail hoaxes," said Don
novan Somera Yisrael, community
health specialist at Vaden. "Some
of my colleagues think that it is
done so that women are more
afraid of going out, men and dat
ing. It is clearly a problem because

some of the included information
concerning date rape and Rohyp
nol is true, but when people feel
that they have been deceived they
are more distrustful and may not
look for other information."
Several peer health educators,
also known as PHEs. distributed
the Progesterex e-mail to dorm
lists. Kate Bedford, peer health co
ordinator at Vaden. supported the
good intentions of the PHEs in
protecting student safety.
"|This e-mailj is a hoax, howev
er it is a hoax that plays on our
fears," Bedford said. "1 encourage
PHEs to be aware of risks students
face and to become well-acquaint
ed with www.snopes.com."
Many Stanford students, espe
cially females, said they have been
concerned by the e-mail.
"1 think that the general atti
tude of the e-mail is one that is
highly harmful and damaging to
women's sense of confidence and
safety, even though the e-mail it
self is purportedly intended to
'warn' or help' potential victims,"
said senior Susan Su, who serves as
the sexual assault program coordi
nator for Stanford Women's Com
munity Center and an officer of
the Stanford Women's Coalition.
"The key is that the e-mail,
short as it is, sends a much more
complex and mal-intentioned mes
sage than a protective warning for
