# Step into a WORLD where REALITY is not as it SEEMS
## Virtual reality lab at Stanford explores identity 
### SIMON SHUSTER 
Have you ever wondered when science
would catch up with Star Trek and final
ly let you travel to different worlds or
even assume a new identity, all before
you can say, "Beam me up, Scottie"?
Well, Stanford's Virtual Human
Interaction Lab, VHIL, may be one step
closer to realizing this sci-fi fantasy.
Founded and currently run by
Communication Prof. Jeremy Bailenson,
VHIL is transporting volunteers into vir
tual worlds, where they interact with one
another under the guises of various com
puter-generated personas, known as
avatars. By studying these interactions,
researchers are trying to understand how
virtual reality environments can influence
all kinds of social behaviors â€” from
stereotyping to confidence to feeling
empathy for others.
What makes this lab unique, said
Bailenson. is not only the quality of the
virtual simulation, but also its commit
ment to social science.
"We want to study what happens
when humans interact with other virtu
al humans," he said. "There are tons of
[ideas for] consumer products people
offer us that we don't do. We're social
scientists."
Yet even in the more restricted realm
of social science, the possible applications
of virtual reality technology seem limitless.
"Anything you can fathom, we can
do," Bailenson said. "[Your virtual rep
resentation] can look as much or as lit
tle like you as you want, and it can
behave as much or as little like you as
you want."
To illustrate, Bailenson described an
online virtual classroom, in which a stu
dent can render his avatar as "paying
attention, mimicking the teacher, while
actually being in the other room smok
ing a cigarette."
While this may sound like child's
play, the virtual worlds that have actual
ly been realized at VHIL may have
influential social applications.
"We're using [the simulations as a
way to desensitize people who have
social anxiety," Bailenson said. For
instance, someone fearful of public
speaking can be placed before a virtual
audience, which can either heckle or
encourage the speaker. In this way, a
common phobia can be overcome with
relative ease.
Practically any fear can be faced in a
virtual reality setting because the simu
lated experience mimics the real world
so convincingly. In my personal venture
in the virtual world (see box, right), the
graphics were real enough to cause ver
tigo. In some experiments, the visual
sensations have been almost too con
vincing, causing the subjects to react as if
they were truly in danger. For instance,
when subjects were asked to step into a
virtual pit, according to Bailenson, some
subjects fell to the floor or tried to grab
on to the ledge, and about one-third of
the volunteers refused to take the virtu
al leap altogether.
In other cases, Bailenson added,
"We've had people try to run away from
a virtual person that's running at them."
Deception and virtual reality
As with most groundbreaking tech

nologies, virtual reality can also serve ill
intentions.
"In a virtual world I could look like
someone completely different," said
sophomore Claire Clarenson, lab man
ager at VHIL.
According to Bailenson, technology
could be abused for the sake of manip
ulating or deceiving the public.
"Of course there are ethical questions,"
he said. "If you're a politician and you're
trying to petition a group of Latino voters.

you can make yourself look Latino. If
you're trying to petition Caucasians, you
can make yourself look Caucasian."
Still, this kind of deception is hardly
a new phenomenon, Bailenson added,
likening it to someone wearing make-up
to obscure his appearance.
"People that lift weights change their
muscles. These things happen all the
time, it's just a lot easier to make these
things effective when you're in an
online medium," he said.

Notions of personal identity can also
be obscured in the context of virtual
reality.
In designing an avatar, photographs
of an individual are "wrapped around"
a stock, a three-dimensional model of a
human head, explained Nick Yee. grad
uate student researcher at VHIL. In
addition to the photographs, a person's
characteristic facial gestures are record
ed and applied to the 3-D model.
"(The resulting virtual person] cap
tures about 95 percent of a person's
facial variance," said Bailenson, refer
ring to the accuracy of the simulations.
"But what happens if I take Nick 's
face, and then I throw your [facial] ges
tures on it. Who is that an avatar of? Is
that Nick or you?" Bailenson asked.
"It looks like Nick, but it's gesturing
like you. You get all these hybrid identi
ty questions that arise," he added.
Projects in the works
Nonetheless, Bailenson said that vir
tual reality technology promises to help
us answer questions about personal iden
tity that might be impossible to answer
using other methods.
On the project Web site, the question
is posed, "How much does an avatar
need to resemble (both visually and
behaviorally) its respective owner in
order for person-specific influences to
take effect?"
VHIL experiments hope to answer
this question by testing how much a per
son's appearance can change before oth
ers in the virtual setting no longer react to
him as the same person. In these ways,
Bailenson's lab can guide the social sci
ences toward a clearer definition of what
it means to be oneself.
Looking into the future of the proj
ect, Bailenson and his research team
also envision less abstract applications.
One virtual world at VHIL promises to
make police lineups more effective. Using
virtual reality, police departments may one
day be able to graph the photographs and
gestures of suspects onto a group of
avatars, instead of making live suspects
line up behind the glass.
TTiat way, a witness can enter a vir
tual world and inspect the suspect
avatars as closely as needed, all while
remaining completely anonymous.
"It can also help us parse out false
alarms," Bailenson said.
Presumably, a witness would not come
too close to the avatar of someone who
had assaulted him. By monitoring the
behavior of the witness in the virtual
world, police would be able to judge the
truthfulness of a witness's testimony.
Various experiments are also testing
the nature of empathy. The VHIL Web
site describes one world "designed to
demonstrate what it is like to walk a
mile in the shoes of another."
Researchers are hoping to study how
gender, status and race influence human
relationships.
One experiment, still in the first phas
es of development, hopes to foster
empathy across cultural and economic
divides. By placing people in a virtual
third-world environment, modeled on a
region of India, this virtual simulation
would allow us to experience the plight
of fellow human beings from halfway
around the world.
