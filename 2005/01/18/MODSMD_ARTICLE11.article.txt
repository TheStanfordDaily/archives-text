# Diving into a deep pit: My virtual world experience
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER 
Stepping into the lab, I encountered several computer stations manned by
student researchers. One of them helped me into the heavy virtual reality
headset, which had one computer screen for each of my eyes. Prof. Jeremy
Bailenson prepared me for the first world — "the Pit" — and with one click
he transported me to an unfamiliar environment and prompted me to look
down. A massive hole had opened up in the ground before me, and as I leaned
over to inspect it, my stomach tightened up with vertigo. At Bailenson's com
mand, I jumped in, and only landed after a second or two of freefall. Then
Bailenson cued me to look up, warning that some "friends" were about to
jump in after me. Suddenly, it began to rain "virtual people," and 1 instinctive
ly raised my arms to break the impact.
I knew it wasn't real, but I just couldn't help it.
Just as quickly, Bailenson pulled me out of the pit world, and "beamed me up"
into a fresh one. In an open field, I saw another avatar and was told to approach
him. The graphics of his face were incredibly lifelike.The motions of his lips, eyes
and eyebrows were natural, and his hair was styled into mullet. As I studied the
movements of his head, Bailenson informed me that this avatar was programmed
to mimic my own head movements — that, studies suggest, is why I found them
so fascinating. I had not realized I was such a narcissist.
I also experienced the public speaking simulation. At first, the audience of
seven avatars sat quietly and listened, shifting in their seats like restless students.
But as Bailenson hit the proper button, they began to heckle me, shouting "Come
on!" or "Boo!" right in my face. I can not imagine having to give a speech in front
of those characters, but I'm sure it would make for great practice.
I was amazed at myself for being taken in by these visual simulations. I
knew that I was wearing a headset and that the worlds in front of my eyes
were being created by a machine, but my mind simply could not help reacting
to such realistic environments as if they were the real thing.
