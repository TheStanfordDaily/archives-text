# Tech news you can use
## Think no one is spying on you? Think again. 
### ANETO OKONKWO 
During winter break, I received a call from a
friend about some critical computer issues she was
having at home. She was facing the same injustice
that millions of Internet users all over the world
endure everyday: Her home computer was devastat
ingly slow.
"I don't know what's wrong. How can 1 fix it?"
In response, I thought about several of the possi
ble causes of her distress: an old machine, too many
installed programs, viruses, and / or spyware. I too
had been affected and I immediately shared some of
my insights. Her main problem? Spyware.
The term "spyware" refers to any software that
secretly collects information about a user while he or
she navigates the Internet and sends the information
to an individual or company that uses it for market
ing or other, more malicious, purposes. For example,
spyware on your computer could tell the marketing
company what Web sites you visit, keystrokes for
your account information and passwords or could
even send screen shots.
Spyware has become one of the most critical secu
rity issues on the Internet, with 90 percent of com
puters infected, over 40,000 spyware variations
recorded to date; and a growth rate of 1.000 new
objects per month. We can all succumb to monster
spyware programs by downloading and installing
legitimate programs or visiting insecure or infected
Web sites. The spyware mostly exploits many of the
flaws in a user's Web browser or computer operating

system. Computers with many versions of spyware
generally experience lower performance and often
crash.
So now you're asking: "How can I track down all
these snoopers, speed up my computer and then fig
ure out who is to blame?"
Before you start to point your accusing finger at
the Stanford network, individual Web sites and soft
ware or hardware providers, understand that we are
all responsible for protecting ourselves from spyware
on an individual basis. Stanford's Information
Technology Services and Systems, known as ITSS,
helps students through the use of the Essential
Stanford Software suite (ESS. http://ess.stanford.edu),
which contains security software compatible with the
Stanford network — but you have to take action, too.
ESS recently offered Webroot's Spy Sweeper, a
program that detects and removes spyware on your
PC. Spy Sweeper scans your computer using a data
base of known spyware threats and reports its find
ings, disabling suspicious files or traces of spyware.
If you don't like Spy Sweeper or feel that you
need a second opinion, there are many other options
in the burgeoning anti-spyware industry. Pundits
rave about Spybot Search & Destroy
(http://www.spybot.info); and one of my picks is
Startup-Doctor, another great spyware destroyer
(http://www.topdownloads.net).
With Startup-Doctor, you can make your comput
er amazingly fast by removing or disabling the spy
ware that automatically starts with Windows. Major
corporations like AOL and Microsoft recently intro-

duced their own
anti-spyware prod
ucts, which could
present a major set
back to pesky hack
ers and marketers
everywhere.
The future looks
bright for the securi
ty concerns of
Internet users all
over the world. As
anger and aware
ness grow among

individuals and organizations, competition heightens
for better security products, and more government
legislation is being implemented to curtail detractors.
For example, in California, the recently enacted
Consumer Protection Against Computer Spyware
Act will punish companies or individuals with a $1,000
fine for installing software that takes control of anoth
er computer. •
Don't just give in to your frustratingly slow com
puter: Armed with this knowledge for Stanford and
beyond, next time something bad happens to your
computer or another electronic device, take the ini
tiative and do your part to secure our technological
future.

Spyware has become one of the most critical secu
rity issues on the Internet, with 90 percent of com
puters infected, over 40,000 spyware variations
recorded to date; and a growth rate of 1.000 new
objects per month. We can all succumb to monster
spyware programs by downloading and installing
legitimate programs or visiting insecure or infected
Web sites. The spyware mostly exploits many of the
flaws in a user's Web browser or computer operating

system. Computers with many versions of spyware
generally experience lower performance and often
crash.
So now you're asking: "How can I track down all
these snoopers, speed up my computer and then fig
ure out who is to blame?"
Before you start to point your accusing finger at
the Stanford network, individual Web sites and soft
ware or hardware providers, understand that we are
all responsible for protecting ourselves from spyware
on an individual basis. Stanford's Information
Technology Services and Systems, known as ITSS,
helps students through the use of the Essential
Stanford Software suite (ESS. http://ess.stanford.edu),
which contains security software compatible with the
Stanford network — but you have to take action, too.
ESS recently offered Webroot's Spy Sweeper, a
program that detects and removes spyware on your
PC. Spy Sweeper scans your computer using a data
base of known spyware threats and reports its find
ings, disabling suspicious files or traces of spyware.
If you don't like Spy Sweeper or feel that you
need a second opinion, there are many other options
in the burgeoning anti-spyware industry. Pundits
rave about Spybot Search & Destroy
(http://www.spybot.info); and one of my picks is
Startup-Doctor, another great spyware destroyer
(http://www.topdownloads.net).
With Startup-Doctor, you can make your comput
er amazingly fast by removing or disabling the spy
ware that automatically starts with Windows. Major
corporations like AOL and Microsoft recently intro-

duced their own
anti-spyware prod
ucts, which could
present a major set
back to pesky hack
ers and marketers
everywhere.
The future looks
bright for the securi
ty concerns of
Internet users all
over the world. As
anger and aware
ness grow among

individuals and organizations, competition heightens
for better security products, and more government
legislation is being implemented to curtail detractors.
For example, in California, the recently enacted
Consumer Protection Against Computer Spyware
Act will punish companies or individuals with a $1,000
fine for installing software that takes control of anoth
er computer. •
Don't just give in to your frustratingly slow com
puter: Armed with this knowledge for Stanford and
beyond, next time something bad happens to your
computer or another electronic device, take the ini
tiative and do your part to secure our technological
future.
