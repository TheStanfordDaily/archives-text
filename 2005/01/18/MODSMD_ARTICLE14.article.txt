## Editorial Weekend Late Night needed 
### 
Although Stanford Dining provides Late Night
service every Sunday through Thursday until
2 a.m., it does not provide on-campus dining
on Friday or Saturday night after the CoHo
closes at 8 p.m. The lack of Late Night dining options on
weekend evenings inconveniences students, and possibly
creates safety issues.
Because there are no on-campus alternatives, students
often opt to drive off-campus on weekend nights to places
like Jack-in-the-Box and Denny's. During these times
there is a greater chance of students driving under the in
fluence of alcohol, and an on-campus Stanford Dining al
ternative could eliminate need to drive in search of a
snack.
But also, the lack of Late Night campus dining on
weekend nights is a great inconvenience to many stu
dents — especially those that don't have access to a car.
Since a significant number of students stay up later than
usual on weekend nights, it seems there would be some
demand for such a service.
Stanford Dining attributes the lack of Late Night oper
ationstothe low traffic such programs received when open
in the past. Stem's C yber Cafe experimented with a week
end Late Night operation, but Stanford Dining said the
number of customers failed to cover its operation costs. As
a result, Stanford Dining reduced the Cyber Cafe's late
hours to only weekday nights.
It is understandable that dining operations wouldn't
want to stay open when they are losing money. However,
the way that Stanford Dining went about providing Late
Night on the weekends might have hurt its chances of

being successful.
For example, a brief trial period of one quarter did not
allow enough time for many students to learn about the
new opportunity to get weekend-night nourishment. Had
students had more time to find out about the Cyber Cafe's
extended hours, demand might have been higher.
Furthermore, location should be considered. Since the
Cyber Cafe is located at an undergraduate dining hall on
the east side of campus, it is an awkward and distant place
for the general student population to congregate late on a
Friday or Saturday night, after a party on the Row. The
CoHo could be a more appropriate place for Stanford
Dining to offer late-hour weekend dining, since it is locat
ed more centrally and is familiar to both undergraduates
and graduates.
Even if offering Late Night might not be as profitable
as would be desired, we believe Stanford Dining has an
obligation to provide a variety of flexible services to the
students it caters, especially since the University requires
most Stanford undergraduates to purchase meal plans.
Just as accommodations have been made for other stu
dents with special dinings needs or preferences, we feel
that it is not unreasonable for Stanford Dining to offer at
least one location that keeps operating during later hours
on Friday and Saturday to serve both those who cannot
make dinner by 8 p.m. and others who simply desire to
eat later in the evening.
Late Night dining represents an important facet of
college life. It is an opportunity for students to bond in a
safe, on-campus location. Students would be well-served
if such service were offered on the Stanford campus.
