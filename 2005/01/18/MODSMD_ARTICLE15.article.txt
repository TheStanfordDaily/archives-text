## Attacking the wrong tsunami myths 
### AHMED ASHRAF 
Russell Berman's "Lessons
learned from the tsunami" (Jan. 14)
betrays a daringly incomplete and
ignorant understanding of the
tsunami catastrophe and the Muslim
world. He maintains that the miser
liness of Muslim countries in helping
their religious counterparts affected
by the disaster "shatters the myth of
Islamic solidarity." Interestingly,
many other pervasive myths are still
left in place.
It is true that Islam as a religion
asks for unity among its followers.
Yet the "myth" of Islamic solidari
ty that Berman talks about has lit
tle to do with perceived "unity"
among Muslim countries, but
rather a skewed perspective that
views the Muslim world as indis
tinct and homogenous.
Berman reveals a fundamental
bias when he describes Muslims in
the affected areas as "Islamic vic
tims" as opposed to Indonesians,
Sri Lankans, Indians and Somalis.
Leaving aside the laughable termi
nology coming from a senior
Hoover fellow (I'm a Muslim, not
an "Islamic person," Mo
hammedan or Moslem), the re
mark tellingly reveals a polarizing
perspective that refuses to go away
— a "myth" in which Muslims have
no identity outside of their reli
gion.
Their culture is Islamic, their na
tionality is Islamic, their politics are
Islamic — in fact, just about every
thing to do with them stinks of
Islam, even though the Muslim
world is one of the most racially and
culturally diverse places in the
world. Muslim nations are expected
to rescue themselves in times of
catastrophe, not because of any reli
gious or moral duty, but because

they're all kind of full of the same
people anyway.
Alarmingly, other ugly stereo
types litter Berman's op-ed from
start to finish. For example, he in
sists that "even though most victims
in Indonesia, the most populous Is
lamic country on the face of the
earth, are Muslim, the support flow
ing from Arab governments has
been pitifully small."
Arab and Muslim appear to be
interchangeable terms in the
Hoover Institution, even though a
large majority of Muslims are not
Arab and not all Arabs are Muslim.
In addition, Arab countries are
summarily condemned as greedy
"oil-rich nations" wallowing in their
own "petrodollars" after decades of
high gas prices.
Most Arab countries, in fact, are
small, poor and lacking in the gush
ing oil fields that so many Ameri
cans think will solve all sorts of in
tractable problems, including the
Iraq quagmire. And oil prices have
only been high for limited time peri
od — a few years, not decades.
The Arab world, oil-rich nations
included, has a combined GDP
equivalent to that of Spain. Their re
lief contributions, as a proportion of
their wealth, outweigh that of the
United States or other developed
nations, however meager they ap
pear in dollar terms. Even poverty
ridden Mozambique ranks higher
up the list when adjusted for such
GDP considerations than most de
veloped countries, except maybe
the Scandinavian nations.
Moreover, a garish Hoover per
spective resonates throughout
Berman's political models. All Mus
lim countries seem to be lull of "fun
damentalists," "Baathists" and
"anti-colonialists" — what else
would you expect from such an op

pressive part of the world? Such
"anti-American" elements are actu
ally minorities in a wider political
spectrum. Let's not rule out those
pesky monarchies and puppet dicta
torships that do comply with Amer
ican interests, shall we?
In sublime contrast, however, the
"generosity" of the developed world
(read: Judaeo-Christian) enthralls
Berman. 1 have no intention of de
meaning the personal generosity of
individuals who have given to relief
organizations out of genuine com
passion. The response of their gov
ernments, however, has been less
that stellar.
What Berman conveniently fails
to mention is that a huge proportion
of initial government "pledges" fail
to materialize after the intense
media attention dies down. No fol
low-up system exists to make sure
promised are kept, and govern
ments, like competitive children,
often announce the big numbers
that they usually can't afford or
won't really commit to.
The ancient city of Bam, Iran,
for example, which suffered a mas
sive earthquake at this time last
year, is still waiting for hundreds of
millions of "promised" dollars,
most of which will probably never
materialize. Furthermore, pledges
of aid, however sizeable, pale in
comparison to the billions of dol
lars of debt that devastated nations
still have to pay back to these same
"generous" nations. The net trans
fer of income still flows back into
Western pockets.
These facts are more pressing
than any supposed "myths" Berman
has to demystify.
