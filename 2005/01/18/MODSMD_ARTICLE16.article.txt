## Public protest is an effective way of voicing minority perspectives 
### BRIAN COLWELL 
I was dismayed to read my col
league Will Nelson's emotive protes
tations against the upcoming protest
of President George W Bush's inau
guration ("Anti-war protests are an
ineffective and unconstructivc way of
making change," Jan. 14).
To his credit, F feel he has some im
portant points to make regarding the
use of innovative tactics and the im
portance of considering one's audi
ence when planning public demon
strations. Unfortunately, his critique
fails miserably on two separate
counts.
First is his professional failure to
acknowledge the fundamental socio

logical importance of protest to stimu
late public discussion and to prevent
the phenomenon of "group think"
from driving public policy.
Second, as a U.S. citizen, I take
issue with his general hostility and
condescension toward public protest
and personally feel he denigrates its
importance to our national history
and culture.
It is almost always the case that un
popular or previously unarticulated
opinions of a vocal minority are first
met with disparagement and.in the
case of Nelson s article, condescen
sion. Such negative responses are an
attempt to silence the minority and
are a backhanded recognition of the
power of their arguments to influence

others and challenge the status quo.
Persistent public protest under
mines the perception of group con
sensus, thus lowering the normative
pressure on others to conform to the
currently dominant perspective. In
this way, public protest produces the
opportunity — though not always
successful — for social change.
In Nelson's world, social problems
and injustices are corrected through a
general public outcry through the
mere awareness of grievances put for
ward by protesters.
In other words, once protesters
shine a light on the problem, the pub
lic reacts to correct "genuine" prob
lems and selectively ignores those
deemed "unimportant." Thus, Nel

son's maxim for protest groups is
that, "If the public has heard the
protestors' arguments before and
dismissed them, the protest is a waste
of time."
This is a caricature of protest activ
ity. that would embarrass most aspir
ing sociologists and is inconsistent
with the years of long struggle for civil
rights he offhandedly puts forth as an
example of his "basic formula."
Nelson's basic formula does not
just misrepresent left-wing protest ac
tivity. It is also a disservice to anti
abortion protesters whose hard won
successes over the past 30 years have,
until recently, been incremental and
subject to numerous fits and starts.
Where would the anti-slavery, civil

rights, labor or even anti-abortion
movements be if they had Nelson as a
consultant?
Yes, such protests are only effec
tive when they meet with a large per
suadable public. This is not such a
problem because, contrary to dime
store pundits, we are all potentially
persuadable. This is why opponents of
protesters' demands typically feel mo
tivated to respond.
If nobody is persuadable, then
why bother? Is it an accident that self
described conservative Nelson de
cides to critique left wing protest ac
tivity on the eve of Bush's inaugura
tion or is it driven by his concern that
such protests are trying to "upstage
the inauguration"?

Finally, speaking as a U.S. citizen. I
don't understand how peaceable pub
lic protest can hurt our country What
is the I Jnited States? It is a nation orig
inally built and routinely strength
ened through the willingness of its cit
izens to publicly dissent.
The First Amendment protects
the right of citizens to peaceably as
semble. however awkwardly or vio
lent the lettering on their placards,
so that a plurality of voices can shape
public policy — even when doing so
is unfashionable by contemporary
standards.

condescension toward public protest
and personally feel he denigrates its
importance to our national history
and culture.
It is almost always the case that un
popular or previously unarticulated
opinions of a vocal minority are first
met with disparagement and.in the
case of Nelson s article, condescen
sion. Such negative responses are an
attempt to silence the minority and
are a backhanded recognition of the
power of their arguments to influence

others and challenge the status quo.
Persistent public protest under
mines the perception of group con
sensus, thus lowering the normative
pressure on others to conform to the
currently dominant perspective. In
this way, public protest produces the
opportunity — though not always
successful — for social change.
In Nelson's world, social problems
and injustices are corrected through a
general public outcry through the
mere awareness of grievances put for
ward by protesters.
In other words, once protesters
shine a light on the problem, the pub
lic reacts to correct "genuine" prob
lems and selectively ignores those
deemed "unimportant." Thus, Nel

son's maxim for protest groups is
that, "If the public has heard the
protestors' arguments before and
dismissed them, the protest is a waste
of time."
This is a caricature of protest activ
ity. that would embarrass most aspir
ing sociologists and is inconsistent
with the years of long struggle for civil
rights he offhandedly puts forth as an
example of his "basic formula."
Nelson's basic formula does not
just misrepresent left-wing protest ac
tivity. It is also a disservice to anti
abortion protesters whose hard won
successes over the past 30 years have,
until recently, been incremental and
subject to numerous fits and starts.
Where would the anti-slavery, civil

rights, labor or even anti-abortion
movements be if they had Nelson as a
consultant?
Yes, such protests are only effec
tive when they meet with a large per
suadable public. This is not such a
problem because, contrary to dime
store pundits, we are all potentially
persuadable. This is why opponents of
protesters' demands typically feel mo
tivated to respond.
If nobody is persuadable, then
why bother? Is it an accident that self
described conservative Nelson de
cides to critique left wing protest ac
tivity on the eve of Bush's inaugura
tion or is it driven by his concern that
such protests are trying to "upstage
the inauguration"?

Finally, speaking as a U.S. citizen. I
don't understand how peaceable pub
lic protest can hurt our country What
is the I Jnited States? It is a nation orig
inally built and routinely strength
ened through the willingness of its cit
izens to publicly dissent.
The First Amendment protects
the right of citizens to peaceably as
semble. however awkwardly or vio
lent the lettering on their placards,
so that a plurality of voices can shape
public policy — even when doing so
is unfashionable by contemporary
standards.
