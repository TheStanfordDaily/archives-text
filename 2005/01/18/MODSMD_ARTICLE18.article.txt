# Sketch: Tales of Graduate Life
## New Years Resolutions: Shiny things, shiny bodies 
### 
It's resolution time: Those few
weeks immediately following
the start of the year where we
all pretend that our New
Year's vows are not just idle specu
lation.
It's always easy to see this in the
small changes around you. Venture
out early in the day during January
and you're likely to he mowed
down by one of the newly minted
runners careening around the
Campus Drive loop.
Hang out in a bar — which is ad
mittedly a rare occurrence in Palo
Alto — and notice how few people
wander outside for their customary
mid-drink tar fix.
And then there's my favourite

temporary surge
— the gym. At
tendance has
gotten high
enough that I can
now spend more
time queuing to
get in than 1 do
on the odd occa
sions where I
find myself out
side trendy bars

back home.
Before contin
uing, I must make a small confes
sion. I, too, have fallen victim to the
forces of self-improvement —
hence my newfound awareness of
what happens on early morning
campus roads and in the bowels of
Arrillaga. It won't last though.
Arrillaga is a very interesting
place. It gleams. As you take in the
broad vista on entrance, you can't
help but be dazzled by the polish
and shine within (the equipment's
quite nice-looking too).
As well as being repositories of
good health, gyms are also quite
depressing. They're depressing for
fairly obvious reasons in the real
world — stemming from the fact
that no matter who you are or
where you're at, everybody in the
place looks better than you.
College gyms are depressing for
a whole other set of reasons as well.
Those reasons largely revolve
around guilt.
No matter how much work you
have to do. you can always justify an
hour or two in the gym — plus an
hour or two to recover and an hour
or two to reward yourself and an
hour or two to worry about all the
hours or twos you've wasted ...
On the surface this may appear
to be a good thing. After all, it's
rare that we can find activities to

escape our obligations.
Dig a little deeper, though, and
you realize that all you've actually
done is replaced one source of self
reproach with another. Now in
stead of just feeling bad because
you're watching TV in place of
working, you can feel bad because
you're watching TV in place of
working out.
In a bid to expand my athletic ex
perience, I've been taking my time
getting through the complicated se
curity procedure at the door. In
doing so, I've had the lime to peruse
the list of student sign-ins. Specifi
cally, I've been comparing the ratio
of grads to undergrads.
Somewhat surprisingly, the frac
tions appear to be evenly balanced.
I would have thought that the quest
fora beautiful body would be
largely the domain of the younger
folk on campus. After all, with age
comes maturity and the realization
that we're all screwed anyway.
Actually, after asking around, I
think I might have the beginnings
of an explanation. I've written pre
viously on the encroachment of age
and the accompanying impending
sense of doom, and it seems as if
this may account for the exercise
fetish.
You see, faced with the undeni
able possibility that life in grad
school is the first step on a down
ward spiral, it's inevitable that
you're tempted to view the whole
experience as an opportunity to re
build in preparation for the rest of
your life.
Of course, these attempts to re
fine ourselves are all part of the
fantasy that we can rebuild our
lives and shape our rapidly drying
clay into something with poise and
purpose. Like most fantasies, this is
not one that often comes true.
So, the next time you're resting
between sets and your glances take
in the dulcet tones of the young lady
on the next station and the bur
nished biceps of the young man
across the floor, remember that
you're unlikely to have either.
Instead, put down the weights,
go and have a drink or 10 with a
friend or two and lament how you
never manage to keep your promis
es, even when they're to yourself.

Think the weekly exercise program
is going to make you a better per
son? E-mail Nav at navins@stan
ford.edu and convince him that
you re not deluding yourself.
