# Haas center finds new leadership
## Stanford Alum Appointed to New Associate Director Position 
### RONALD CHAN 
At the completion of a six
month nationwide search, the
Haas Center for Public Service is
welcoming its first associate di
rector to campus this winter.
The new position is part of a
broader change in the center's or
ganization that is designed to
more closely link public service to
academic life.
Srija Srinivasan, who graduat
ed from Stanford with a bache
lor's degree in Human Biology in
1990 and an MB A and Certificate
in Public Management from the
Graduate School of Business in
1995, assumed the position on
Jan. 5. In her role as the associate
director, Srinivasan will work
with other senior staff in oversee
ing the day-to-day operation, fi
nancial management and staff de
velopment of the Haas Center.
"We're delighted that she's
here." said Engineering Prof.
Leonard Ortolano, director of the
Haas Center. "We're confident
that she'll help us achieve our
goal of bringing the Haas Center
into the mainstream of teaching
and research of the University."
Srinivasan brings to the Haas
Center more than a decade of ex
perience in public service, in
cluding leadership roles in gov
ernment, nonprofit and philan
thropic organizations. While an
undergraduate student, she
served as the community service
representative for her dorm, a
residential advisor in Toyon Hall
and a peer academic advisor in

Human Biology.
Following her graduation.
Srinivasan received a John Gard
ner Public Service Fellowship and
spent her fellowship year at the
U.S. General Accounting Office
in Washington, D.C., specializing
in health care financing.
"1 had always wanted to pur
sue public service, and the fellow
ship was a tremendous first step
for me," Srinivasan said. "As a
John Gardner Fellow, I got to
know so many mentors and
friends who were willing to show
me how to become an effective
leader in public service."
Upon completing her fellow
ship in Washington D.C., Srini
vasan worked for the San Mateo
Health Services Agency for two
years before enrolling in the
MBA program at the Business
School, where she received the
Ernest C. Arbuckle Award in
recognition of her contribution to
the Business School community.
"I wanted to go to business
school to deepen my understand
ing of the business side of policy
making, especially health policy,"
she said. "For that reason, I also
chose to enter the GSB's Public
Management Program."
Srinivasan learned about this
newly-created position at the
Haas Center last year when she
was on maternity leave from the
Peninsula Community Founda
tion. where she served as a pro
gram officer directing more than
$9 million in grants to communi
ty-based organizations in the

Peninsula and Silicon Valley re
gion.
"A friend of mine at the
School of Education received an
e-mail saying that the Haas Cen
ter is looking fora new associate
director," Srinivasan explained.
"She told me about it and said,
'Hey Srija, that's you.' "
"I looked into the position, and
thought it would be a good fit for
me. too," Srinivasan said. "So I
applied in the summer, had a few
rounds of interviews with the
search committee and was offered
the job in December. I'm very ex
cited about this opportunity."
The new position, Ortolano
explained, was created as a re
sult of evolution in the center's
mission.

"When the Haas Center was
first founded, it served more or
less as a coordination center for
volunteers," said Ortolano. ' As
the Haas Center grew to further
its current mission of connecting
public service closely with Stan
ford's academic and research pro
grams, it became clear that a new
model of leadership is required."
Under the new model, the cen
ter is headed by a half-time, rotat
ing director and a full-time, per
manent associate director. A fac
ulty member assumes the director
position fora three-year term,
setting the overall policy for the
center, encouraging the integra
tion of public service into acade

and national level and spearhead

ever, is led by the associate direc

and human resources.

an associate director began in June

Stanford," Ortolano said. "She was
our unanimous choice."
At the completion of a six
month nationwide search, the
Haas Center for Public Service is
welcoming its first associate di
rector to campus this winter.
The new position is part of a
broader change in the center's or
ganization that is designed to
more closely link public service to
academic life.
Srija Srinivasan, who graduat
ed from Stanford with a bache
lor's degree in Human Biology in
1990 and an MB A and Certificate
in Public Management from the
Graduate School of Business in
1995, assumed the position on
Jan. 5. In her role as the associate
director, Srinivasan will work
with other senior staff in oversee
ing the day-to-day operation, fi
nancial management and staff de
velopment of the Haas Center.
"We're delighted that she's
here." said Engineering Prof.
Leonard Ortolano, director of the
Haas Center. "We're confident
that she'll help us achieve our
goal of bringing the Haas Center
into the mainstream of teaching
and research of the University."
Srinivasan brings to the Haas
Center more than a decade of ex
perience in public service, in
cluding leadership roles in gov
ernment, nonprofit and philan
thropic organizations. While an
undergraduate student, she
served as the community service
representative for her dorm, a
residential advisor in Toyon Hall
and a peer academic advisor in

Human Biology.
Following her graduation.
Srinivasan received a John Gard
ner Public Service Fellowship and
spent her fellowship year at the
U.S. General Accounting Office
in Washington, D.C., specializing
in health care financing.
"1 had always wanted to pur
sue public service, and the fellow
ship was a tremendous first step
for me," Srinivasan said. "As a
John Gardner Fellow, I got to
know so many mentors and
friends who were willing to show
me how to become an effective
leader in public service."
Upon completing her fellow
ship in Washington D.C., Srini
vasan worked for the San Mateo
Health Services Agency for two
years before enrolling in the
MBA program at the Business
School, where she received the
Ernest C. Arbuckle Award in
recognition of her contribution to
the Business School community.
"I wanted to go to business
school to deepen my understand
ing of the business side of policy
making, especially health policy,"
she said. "For that reason, I also
chose to enter the GSB's Public
Management Program."
Srinivasan learned about this
newly-created position at the
Haas Center last year when she
was on maternity leave from the
Peninsula Community Founda
tion. where she served as a pro
gram officer directing more than
$9 million in grants to communi
ty-based organizations in the

Peninsula and Silicon Valley re
gion.
"A friend of mine at the
School of Education received an
e-mail saying that the Haas Cen
ter is looking fora new associate
director," Srinivasan explained.
"She told me about it and said,
'Hey Srija, that's you.' "
"I looked into the position, and
thought it would be a good fit for
me. too," Srinivasan said. "So I
applied in the summer, had a few
rounds of interviews with the
search committee and was offered
the job in December. I'm very ex
cited about this opportunity."
The new position, Ortolano
explained, was created as a re
sult of evolution in the center's
mission.

"When the Haas Center was
first founded, it served more or
less as a coordination center for
volunteers," said Ortolano. ' As
the Haas Center grew to further
its current mission of connecting
public service closely with Stan
ford's academic and research pro
grams, it became clear that a new
model of leadership is required."
Under the new model, the cen
ter is headed by a half-time, rotat
ing director and a full-time, per
manent associate director. A fac
ulty member assumes the director
position fora three-year term,
setting the overall policy for the
center, encouraging the integra
tion of public service into acade
