## Men's basketball never trails in win over Cal 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
The men's basketball team expected to
walk into a bear's lair against California (8-
7,1-4 Pacific-10 Conference) at Haas Pavil
ion on Saturday. What they found looked
more like a cub's den.
The Cardinal (8-7, 2-3 Pac-10) dis

The team also
benefited from a subdued Berkeley crowd.
"Since I've been here, that was the
fewest students we've had fora Stanford
game," said Cal junior Rod Benson, a cen
ter who tallied 24 points and 11 rebounds.
"They jumped out to a big lead early and si
lenced our crowd."
The empty seats could be attributed to
the tact that classes at Cal did not begin
until today.
Stanford, coming off a big win against
Arizona last Saturday, played with poise
from the opening tip. which went to Chris
Hernandez. The junior point guard drib

bled to the top of the key, set up and sank a
three-pointer seven seconds into the game,
and the Cardinal never trailed after that.
"That set the tone for me for the rest of
the game," Hernandez said.
He led the team with 19 points and hit
five of seven from beyond the arc, including
several from NBA range.
The rest of the game went much like
the opening play. The Cardinal aban
doned the up-tempo style used against
Arizona and instead let the game come to
them, running their half-court set, creat
ing open shots, and calmly stepping up
and hitting them.
Stanford went on a 16-2 run late in the
first period and led 36-21 at halftime. The
margin never dropped below double digits
after that point.
Benson came out firing in the second
half, scoring his team's first 10 points to
bring Cal within 10. But he left the game to
take a breather, and when he returned two
minutes later the Cardinal had doubled
their lead with a 10-0 run. For the first nine
minutes of the period. Benson was the only
Bear to score until forward David Paris
made a lay-up.
Benson scored 18 second-half points,

but by then the game was well out of reach.
The Bears shot a paltry 31.9 percent
from the field — including only seven of
32 in the first half — and Stanford held
Cal's leading scorer, junior guard
Richard Midgley, to 13 points on 4-of-14
shooting.
"We were able to limit his touches and
challenge his shots," said Stanford guard
Dan Grunfeld, who scored 18 points to go
with eigh f rebounds on the heels of a career
high 29-point performance against Arizona.
"1 thought our guys in the post did a
great job of pushing them out, making them
take tough shots in the first half," Hernan
dez said.
The Cardinal neutralized the Golden
Bear guards — holding them to an anemic
6 of 35 from the floor — and forced Berke
ley to work the ball inside.
Each of the Cardinal post players was
limited by foul trouble. Junior forward
Matt Haryasz committed (our personals in
onl\ 11 minutes, forcing head coach Trent
Johnson to play senior Nick Robinson at
forward for most of the game. Robinson
was one of four Cardinal players in double
digits. with 11 points.
Freshman Peter Prowitt logged 12 min

utes at center and committed four fouls.
Little was the one mainstay in the post.
He played aggressively inside for the sec
ond game in a row, scoring 16 points and
pulling down 11 rebounds. He threaded the
defense with a nifty pass from the three
point line to Grunfeld for an uncontested
lay-up during the Cardinal's 10-0 run in the
second half.
But Little spent most of his time under
the basket, scoring his points on an array of
hook shots and a few put-backs.
Junior Jason Haas had another solid ef
fort off the bench, scoring eight points to go
with six assists. He manned the point for
most of the second half, with Hernandez
moving to the two-guard position.
About his team's defensive effort, John
son said, "It was a team deal. We were try
ing to rebound, get back on defense and not
let them get out on the break. They're
scary."
The Bears would have been scarier had
they been completely healthy. Sophomore
forward Leon Powe, a former Pac-10 fresh
man of the year, will sit out the entire sea
son following pre-season knee surgery.

rebounds in the win over Berkeley.
Sophomore Ayinde Übaka, who usu
ally starts at guard, came off the bench
against Stanford in his first game hack
since breaking his foot two months
ago. And Midgley played with a
sprained right shoulder.
Though both teams entered the
game with identical 1-3 Pac-10 records
— and both will travel to Los Angeles
to play USC and UCLA this weekend
— Stanford and Cal seem to be head
ed in opposite directions. The Bears'
loss was their third in a row. while
Stanford notched its second consecu
tive win. That can't be called a streak
(yet), but the Cardinal will have some
thing to build on next weekend as they
try to climb back into a Pac-10 race

32 in the first half — and Stanford held
Cal's leading scorer, junior guard
Richard Midgley, to 13 points on 4-of-14
shooting.
"We were able to limit his touches and
challenge his shots," said Stanford guard
Dan Grunfeld, who scored 18 points to go
with eigh f rebounds on the heels of a career
high 29-point performance against Arizona.
"1 thought our guys in the post did a
great job of pushing them out, making them
take tough shots in the first half," Hernan
dez said.
The Cardinal neutralized the Golden
Bear guards — holding them to an anemic
6 of 35 from the floor — and forced Berke
ley to work the ball inside.
Each of the Cardinal post players was
limited by foul trouble. Junior forward
Matt Haryasz committed (our personals in
onl\ 11 minutes, forcing head coach Trent
Johnson to play senior Nick Robinson at
forward for most of the game. Robinson
was one of four Cardinal players in double
digits. with 11 points.
Freshman Peter Prowitt logged 12 min

utes at center and committed four fouls.
Little was the one mainstay in the post.
He played aggressively inside for the sec
ond game in a row, scoring 16 points and
pulling down 11 rebounds. He threaded the
defense with a nifty pass from the three
point line to Grunfeld for an uncontested
lay-up during the Cardinal's 10-0 run in the
second half.
But Little spent most of his time under
the basket, scoring his points on an array of
hook shots and a few put-backs.
Junior Jason Haas had another solid ef
fort off the bench, scoring eight points to go
with six assists. He manned the point for
most of the second half, with Hernandez
moving to the two-guard position.
About his team's defensive effort, John
son said, "It was a team deal. We were try
ing to rebound, get back on defense and not
let them get out on the break. They're
scary."
The Bears would have been scarier had
they been completely healthy. Sophomore
forward Leon Powe, a former Pac-10 fresh
man of the year, will sit out the entire sea
son following pre-season knee surgery.

Junior Dan Grunfeld notched 18 points and eight
rebounds in the win over Berkeley.
Sophomore Ayinde Übaka, who usu

against Stanford in his first game hack

Though both teams entered the
game with identical 1-3 Pac-10 records
— and both will travel to Los Angeles
to play USC and UCLA this weekend
— Stanford and Cal seem to be head
ed in opposite directions. The Bears'
loss was their third in a row. while
Stanford notched its second consecu
tive win. That can't be called a streak
(yet), but the Cardinal will have some
thing to build on next weekend as they
try to climb back into a Pac-10 race
that suddenly seems within reach.
"There's a lot of parity in this
league," Little said when asked about
the Cardinal's chances in the confer

"I don't really pay much attention
to the standings, or to the race," John

good basketball. We're just worried
about getting better every day."

The team also
benefited from a subdued Berkeley crowd.
"Since I've been here, that was the
fewest students we've had fora Stanford
game," said Cal junior Rod Benson, a cen
ter who tallied 24 points and 11 rebounds.
"They jumped out to a big lead early and si
lenced our crowd."
The empty seats could be attributed to
the tact that classes at Cal did not begin
until today.
Stanford, coming off a big win against
Arizona last Saturday, played with poise
from the opening tip. which went to Chris
Hernandez. The junior point guard drib

bled to the top of the key, set up and sank a
three-pointer seven seconds into the game,
and the Cardinal never trailed after that.
"That set the tone for me for the rest of
the game," Hernandez said.
He led the team with 19 points and hit
five of seven from beyond the arc, including
several from NBA range.
The rest of the game went much like
the opening play. The Cardinal aban
doned the up-tempo style used against
Arizona and instead let the game come to
them, running their half-court set, creat
ing open shots, and calmly stepping up
and hitting them.
Stanford went on a 16-2 run late in the
first period and led 36-21 at halftime. The
margin never dropped below double digits
after that point.
Benson came out firing in the second
half, scoring his team's first 10 points to
bring Cal within 10. But he left the game to
take a breather, and when he returned two
minutes later the Cardinal had doubled
their lead with a 10-0 run. For the first nine
minutes of the period. Benson was the only
Bear to score until forward David Paris
made a lay-up.
Benson scored 18 second-half points,

but by then the game was well out of reach.
