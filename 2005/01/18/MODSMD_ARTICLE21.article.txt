opportu
nity to prove themselves against a
tough non-conference opponent.
Stanford shone, leading from
start to finish and ending the Ea
gles' 11-game win streak.
"This reminded me of an
NCAA Tournament game," head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I
think it's really critical for our
whole team to have this kind of
game, hut 1 think it's especially
valuable for our young players."
Much as they did Thursday
against California, the Cardinal
women came out of the locker
room on fire in the first half, tak
ing advantage of BC's man-to
man defense by getting the ball
into the post early and often.
With talented forward Kathrin
Ress in foul trouble early, the Ea
gles had no answer for the inside
tandem of junior Brooke Smith
and sophomore Kristen Newlin.
Newlin showed off an impres
sive shooting touch, as she es
chewed the power game in favor
of the mid-range jump shot,
shooting4-of-5 in the half. Newlin
finished with 10 points on the af
ternoon.
Smith, on the other hand, sim
ply dominated both ends of the
court for stretches of the first half.
On defense, she kept Ress and
forward Brooke Queenan under
wraps. The two combined for six
points in the first half, a game after
Ress burned Villanova for 28.
On offense, Smith scored 13

points in 13 minutes and was a
perfect 6-of-6 from the field in the
first half, consistently getting posi
tion deep in the paint. Smith also
grabbed seven boards en route to
a 41-21 Stanford lead at halftime.
When the Eagles tried to bring
help against Smith and Newlin,
Stanford's guards made them pay.
Even when freshman Candice
Wiggins uncharacteristically
found foul trouble and a seat on
the bench, senior Kelley Suminski
and fifth-year starter Susan King
Borchardt seamlessly bridged the
scoring gap.
Suminski shot 5-of-8 from the
field for the game, including 3-of
-5 shooting from beyond the three
point arc. In addition to her 15
points, Suminski ran the Cardi
nal's triangle offense to perfec
tion, handing out five assists, tying
her season high set two days earli
er against Cal.
Coming back from a stress re
action in her foot, Borchardt
played a season-high 27 minutes.
With Wiggins playing just six min
utes in the first half due to foul
trouble, Borchardt notched 11
points and three rebounds.
More important than her of
fensive contribution was her tena
cious defense. Despite not being
in full playing shape, Borchardt
collected three steals, converting
one into an easy lay-up after an in
bound pass. She also guarded
BC's dynamic Jessalyn Deveny.
"What surprised me was that in
the first half [Borchardt] asked fora
[substitution]." VanDerveer said.
"1 don't ever remember her asking
that. Susan is so competitive, and
it's great to have her back."
Despite being beaten soundly
for the first 20 minutes, the Eagles
came out of the locker room a dif
ferent team in the second half and
took it to the Cardinal at both
ends of the floor.
"We kind of knew we had to
just lay it out on the line and give

it everything we had," Ress said.
"We had nothing to lose coming
into that second half."
Deveny was a terror, shooting
5-of-7 from the field, including a
pair from beyond the arc and fin
ished with a game-high 26 points.
Ress, meanwhile, played bril
liantly with three fouls for most of
the second half, limiting Smith to
just four points on 2-of-b shooting.
After the Cardinal had given
themselves numerous second
chance opportunities by control
ling the glass before halftime,
Ress pulled down eight boards in
the second half while adding
seven points.
"They were more aggressive. I
didn't think we came out with the
intensity." VanDerveer said of
the Cardinal's second-half play. "1
have to really think about what to
do, and this is unfortunately not
the first time that it's happened."
Along with Queenan, Deveny
and Ress chipped away at the 20-
point Stanford lead, closing to
within seven with 2:18 remaining
on the clock.
However, the door slammed
shut on the Eagles' comeback
when the Cardinal reached the
bonus. Stanford was a perfect 10-
of-10 from the charity stripe in the
second half, running its record
against nationally ranked teams
to 3-1 this year.
Wiggins, the team's leading
scorer, managed only 13. But
Stanford saw four other players
score in double digits against a de
fense ranked 15th in the country
in points allowed.
"My teammates stepped up
completely," Wiggins said. "I'm
just very fortunate that everyone
else was able to come in and pick
it up."
Thursday the Cardinal will try
to take sole possession of the Pac
-10 lead as they welcome No. 19
UCLA to Maples Pavilion at 7 p.m.

tion deep in the paint. Smith also
grabbed seven boards en route to
a 41-21 Stanford lead at halftime.
When the Eagles tried to bring
help against Smith and Newlin,
Stanford's guards made them pay.
Even when freshman Candice
Wiggins uncharacteristically
found foul trouble and a seat on
the bench, senior Kelley Suminski
and fifth-year starter Susan King
Borchardt seamlessly bridged the
scoring gap.
Suminski shot 5-of-8 from the
field for the game, including 3-of
-5 shooting from beyond the three
point arc. In addition to her 15
points, Suminski ran the Cardi
nal's triangle offense to perfec
tion, handing out five assists, tying
her season high set two days earli
er against Cal.
Coming back from a stress re
action in her foot, Borchardt
played a season-high 27 minutes.
With Wiggins playing just six min
utes in the first half due to foul
trouble, Borchardt notched 11
points and three rebounds.
More important than her of
fensive contribution was her tena
cious defense. Despite not being
in full playing shape, Borchardt
collected three steals, converting
one into an easy lay-up after an in
bound pass. She also guarded
BC's dynamic Jessalyn Deveny.
"What surprised me was that in
the first half [Borchardt] asked fora
[substitution]." VanDerveer said.
"1 don't ever remember her asking
that. Susan is so competitive, and
it's great to have her back."
Despite being beaten soundly
for the first 20 minutes, the Eagles
came out of the locker room a dif
ferent team in the second half and
took it to the Cardinal at both
ends of the floor.
"We kind of knew we had to
just lay it out on the line and give

it everything we had," Ress said.
"We had nothing to lose coming
into that second half."
Deveny was a terror, shooting
5-of-7 from the field, including a
pair from beyond the arc and fin
ished with a game-high 26 points.
Ress, meanwhile, played bril
liantly with three fouls for most of
the second half, limiting Smith to
just four points on 2-of-b shooting.
After the Cardinal had given
themselves numerous second
chance opportunities by control
ling the glass before halftime,
Ress pulled down eight boards in
the second half while adding
seven points.
"They were more aggressive. I
didn't think we came out with the
intensity." VanDerveer said of
the Cardinal's second-half play. "1
have to really think about what to
do, and this is unfortunately not
the first time that it's happened."
Along with Queenan, Deveny
and Ress chipped away at the 20-
point Stanford lead, closing to
within seven with 2:18 remaining
on the clock.
However, the door slammed
shut on the Eagles' comeback
when the Cardinal reached the
bonus. Stanford was a perfect 10-
of-10 from the charity stripe in the
second half, running its record
against nationally ranked teams
to 3-1 this year.
Wiggins, the team's leading
scorer, managed only 13. But
Stanford saw four other players
score in double digits against a de
fense ranked 15th in the country
in points allowed.
"My teammates stepped up
completely," Wiggins said. "I'm
just very fortunate that everyone
else was able to come in and pick
it up."
Thursday the Cardinal will try
to take sole possession of the Pac
-10 lead as they welcome No. 19
UCLA to Maples Pavilion at 7 p.m.

Much as they did Thursday
against California, the Cardinal
women came out of the locker

into the post early and often.
With talented forward Kathrin
Ress in foul trouble early, the Ea
gles had no answer for the inside
tandem of junior Brooke Smith
and sophomore Kristen Newlin.
Newlin showed off an impres

of the mid-range jump shot,
shooting4-of-5 in the half. Newlin
finished with 10 points on the af

Smith, on the other hand, sim

On defense, she kept Ress and
forward Brooke Queenan under
