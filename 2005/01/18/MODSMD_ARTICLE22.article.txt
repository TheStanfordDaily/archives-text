Undefeated in an amazing 34 con
secutive dual meets dating hack to
November 1999, the Stanford men's
swimming and diving team was set on
making sure the streak would live on
through its meet on Saturday. And the
Cardinal

PACIFIC 107 on ( G
their re
cent ascension to the No. I ranking in
the College Swimming Coaches Asso
ciation of America (CSCAA) poll,
which was released on January 13th fol
lowing their dual meet win over Michi
gan.
The team succeeded in that task and
made sure of it early against Pacific, im
proving its record to 3-0. On a crisp Sat
urday morning, the Cardinal disman
tled the visiting Tigers 144-107 at the
Avery Aquatic Center.
The Cardinal swimmers saw no dif
ference between using the meet as a
fun, learning experience and pushing

themselves to swim their fastest.
"Concerning fun, most of us have
trained over half our lives to compete,
and therefore don't find anything more
fun than performing our absolute best
against the very best," said sophomore
Shaun Phillips.
Starting off the meet, the Cardinal
took the top two spots in the 200-yard
medley relay, with the top team con
sisting of senior co-captain Jayme
Cramer, junior Ricky Eddy and sopho
mores Ben Wildman-Tobriner and
Kyle Ransom.
Continuing into the individual
events, Stanford sophomore Andy
Grant and freshman Daniel Beal fin
ished first and second in the 1000-yard
freestyle event, clocking nine minutes
and 15.57 seconds and 9:34.81. respec
tively. Grant's first-place finish was
only the first of three individual wins he
would earn at the meet.
In the following event, the 200-yard
freestyle. Phillips led a Cardinal sweep
of the top three spots. After that, Stan
ford was already cruising with a 44-11
lead.
Grant posted his second and third
winning times of the day in the 50-
yard freestyle sprint and 200-yard
backstroke event, showing versatili
ty not present in many swimmers.
While he called his performances in
1000-yard and 50-yard freestyle
"times I've seen in practice," his win
in the 200-yard backstroke was a
"very pleasant surprise."
The performances of the sea

soned veterans on the Stanford
squad were bolstered by a strong
showing by several underclassmen.
"Although we've come to expect
powerful swims from our upper
classmen like captains Jayme
(Cramer] and Matt [McDonald), we
were really impressed by the fresh
man and sophomore classes and
how they were able to swim like se
niors," said Phillips. "These guys are
swimming with maturity and confi-

Freshmen, sophomores
'swim like seniors'

dence beyond their years, and it is
surprises of this sort that end up win
ning championship meets."
For this meet, Stanford swim
mers finished fastest to the wall in 15
of the 16 events, with Stanford's top
swimmer coming in second only in
the 4(X) individual medley event. In
that event. Pacific's Krzsztof Zoldac
took the top time, outdoing Stan
ford junior Tobias Oriwol 3:54.29 to
3:57.92.
Seven different Cardinal swim
mers took first in the eleven individ
ual events. Four Stanford swimmers
took first in more than one event:
Cramer, Grant, Phillips and Beal.
The Cardinal finished the meet on a
high note, topping the Pacific team in
the 200-yard freestyle relay race by
less than one second.
The Cardinal will have a target
on their backs as they enter their
first and only real road trip of the
dual-meet season when they face
Arizona State and Arizona back-to
back on Friday and Saturday.
Phillips said that his team's improve
ment will be essential for post-sea
son success.
"It takes depth to win Pac-lOs
and NCAAs, and I believe it is our
depth that is beginning to show in
these mid-season meets," he said.

made sure of it early against Pacific, im
proving its record to 3-0. On a crisp Sat
urday morning, the Cardinal disman
tled the visiting Tigers 144-107 at the
Avery Aquatic Center.
The Cardinal swimmers saw no dif
ference between using the meet as a
fun, learning experience and pushing

themselves to swim their fastest.
"Concerning fun, most of us have
trained over half our lives to compete,
and therefore don't find anything more
fun than performing our absolute best
against the very best," said sophomore
Shaun Phillips.
Starting off the meet, the Cardinal
took the top two spots in the 200-yard
medley relay, with the top team con
sisting of senior co-captain Jayme
Cramer, junior Ricky Eddy and sopho
mores Ben Wildman-Tobriner and
Kyle Ransom.
Continuing into the individual
events, Stanford sophomore Andy
Grant and freshman Daniel Beal fin
ished first and second in the 1000-yard
freestyle event, clocking nine minutes
and 15.57 seconds and 9:34.81. respec
tively. Grant's first-place finish was
only the first of three individual wins he
would earn at the meet.
In the following event, the 200-yard
freestyle. Phillips led a Cardinal sweep
of the top three spots. After that, Stan
ford was already cruising with a 44-11
lead.
Grant posted his second and third
winning times of the day in the 50-
yard freestyle sprint and 200-yard
backstroke event, showing versatili
ty not present in many swimmers.
While he called his performances in
1000-yard and 50-yard freestyle
"times I've seen in practice," his win
in the 200-yard backstroke was a
"very pleasant surprise."
The performances of the sea

soned veterans on the Stanford
squad were bolstered by a strong
showing by several underclassmen.
"Although we've come to expect
powerful swims from our upper
classmen like captains Jayme
(Cramer] and Matt [McDonald), we
were really impressed by the fresh
man and sophomore classes and
how they were able to swim like se
niors," said Phillips. "These guys are
swimming with maturity and confi-

Freshmen, sophomores
'swim like seniors'

dence beyond their years, and it is
surprises of this sort that end up win
ning championship meets."
For this meet, Stanford swim
mers finished fastest to the wall in 15
of the 16 events, with Stanford's top
swimmer coming in second only in
the 4(X) individual medley event. In
that event. Pacific's Krzsztof Zoldac
took the top time, outdoing Stan
ford junior Tobias Oriwol 3:54.29 to
3:57.92.
Seven different Cardinal swim
mers took first in the eleven individ
ual events. Four Stanford swimmers
took first in more than one event:
Cramer, Grant, Phillips and Beal.
The Cardinal finished the meet on a
high note, topping the Pacific team in
the 200-yard freestyle relay race by
less than one second.
The Cardinal will have a target
on their backs as they enter their
first and only real road trip of the
dual-meet season when they face
Arizona State and Arizona back-to
back on Friday and Saturday.
Phillips said that his team's improve
ment will be essential for post-sea
son success.
"It takes depth to win Pac-lOs
and NCAAs, and I believe it is our
depth that is beginning to show in
these mid-season meets," he said.
