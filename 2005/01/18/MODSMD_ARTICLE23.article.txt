# Volleyball spikes USC, falls to Pepperdine in four
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The weekend started out on a positive
note for the men's volleyball team, with
fifth-year senior Kevin Hansen joining just
three other players in the history of Stan
ford volleyball to record more than 4000
career assists.
Hansen's milestone came during Fri
day's match
STANFORD 3, against South
use 0 ern California.
which the No.
8 Cardinal (2-
3,1-1 Pacific-10 Conference) won 3-0.
"I wasn't really following it much, but
it's pretty cool to be up with the big names
at Stanford," Hansen said. "I focus on our
team performance rather than mine. I'd
much rather win a national championship
than be the number-one assist leader of all
time."
With sophomore Josh Schwarzapel and
junior Nick Manov, both outside hitters out

due to injuries, it had been "kind of a weird
week in practice," said head coach Don
Shaw. "With two guys suddenly out of ac
tion, we just tried to piece together some
practices and get a good workout in."
Schwarzapel developed back pains dur
ing the Santa Barbara tournament last
weekend, and Manov has a sore shoulder.
Shaw said he was doubtful that either play
er would be able to do much for at least an
other week.
Did that factor into the match at all?
"Well, it does in a way." Shaw said.
"That takes away from our depth, and
depth is always an issue, especially when we
look down the bench and we don't have as
many guys to choose from."
However, the team proved that it was
ready to take on USC. never relinquishing
the lead as it pressed to a 30-25 win in the
first game. In the second game, the Cardi
nal wavered, falling behind USC more than
once before finally holding off the Trojans

at 30-28.
"The difference between last
year and this year is that this year
we had the confidence to pull it
out," senior Craig Buell said. "Last
year we would have just caved in,
but this year we're confident."
The third game of the match was
also a struggle, but Stanford ulti
mately managed to handle I JSC's
relentless offense with a 30-25 vic
tory.
"We played well at times, and
we could have played better at
times," Buell said. "The way our
coaches put it, was that our intensi
ty wavered. Especially in game
three, we didn't finish the game
strong."
As expected against the No. 12
Trojans, the No. 8 Cardinal did
emerge victorious. However. Stan
ford coaches and players felt that
there was room for improvement.
"1 think if we had played at a
higher level ourselves, it might not
have been as tough a match," Shaw
said. "I think we got a little careless
in the third game. We missed some
serves —more in the third game
than we did in both the first and
second games — but that's just a
matter of focus and concentration.
You get a 2-0 lead, you relax a little
bit. But we can't afford to do that."

said that
the team
would have to play "much better"
than they had against LJSC if they
were to defeat the Waves.

And so thcv did in the first game
of the match on Saturday. Despite
trailing fora good part of the game,
the Cardinal tied it up twice, then
pulled ahead to win 30-28. The
team's excitement was infectious,
and the crowd kept the energy level
high, clapping along with the bench
before each serve.
In game two, the Cardinal once
again trailed the Waves early in the
game. They finally managed to get
up 22-20, but Pepperdine surged to
closed out the game at 24-30.
With the match tied at I-I. Stan
ford went into the third game with
evident determination. They
trailed closely the entire game, fi
nally pulling ahead 29-28. But the
Cardinal were unable to score the
game point, and Pepperdine capi
talized on the opportunity to defeat
Stanford 31-29.
"The first three games, we real
ly came out and played hard, we
were with them the whole time,"
Hansen said. "There were a couple
points here and there that we didn't
pull out. We had a swing in the third
game to win it. which could have
been the difference."
In the fourth game, the Waves
pulled ahead at the start, and Stan
ford trailed by about 10 points the
entire game. Pepperdine sealed the
match with a 30-20 victory.
"I'm not very happy with the
way we finished that fourth game."
Shaw said. "I don't know what hap
pened there, but we fell apart after
being so competitive for three
games, so that kind of leaves a bit
ter taste in my mouth."
The players shared similar
sentiments.

"That fourth game, we kind of
had a letdown there," Hansen said.
"They have a pretty strong attack;
they have tall guys who are coming
at you. and that sort of wears you
out by the fourth game. After that
third game, we had a little mental
breakdown and couldn't come
back. It's a game of momentum."
Pepperdine dominated statisti
cally, hitting .310 in the fourth
game while Stanford had a -.032.
The Waves also outblocked the
Cardinal by a 15-4 margin.
"We just don't have an answer
for guys who can hit the ball that
hard," Shaw said. "It's like playing
an international team. That block is
as big as you'll see anywhere in the
world. With a block that big. it's
going to wear on you, both physi
cally and psychologically. It forces
hitting errors that we would not
normally make."
Stanford is now 2-3 for the sea
son and 1-1 in conference play.
Having split the weekend with a
win on Friday and a loss on Satur
day, they remain composed and
ready for more competition.
"It's tough to lose to those guys;
I've never beaten them, and it's
been four years," Hansen said.
"But it's a long season, so you're
going to have losses here and there.
You just have to keep bouncing
back after those losses. Next week
we have a pretty big week and a
game Wednesday, so we just have
to forget about this."
The game Wednesday is at Long
Beach State, a team that beat them 3-
2 in the bronze medal match of the
Santa Barbara tournament on Jan. 8.

said that
the team
would have to play "much better"
than they had against LJSC if they
were to defeat the Waves.

And so thcv did in the first game
of the match on Saturday. Despite
trailing fora good part of the game,
the Cardinal tied it up twice, then
pulled ahead to win 30-28. The
team's excitement was infectious,
and the crowd kept the energy level
high, clapping along with the bench
before each serve.
In game two, the Cardinal once
again trailed the Waves early in the
game. They finally managed to get
up 22-20, but Pepperdine surged to
closed out the game at 24-30.
With the match tied at I-I. Stan
ford went into the third game with
evident determination. They
trailed closely the entire game, fi
nally pulling ahead 29-28. But the
Cardinal were unable to score the
game point, and Pepperdine capi
talized on the opportunity to defeat
Stanford 31-29.
"The first three games, we real
ly came out and played hard, we
were with them the whole time,"
Hansen said. "There were a couple
points here and there that we didn't
pull out. We had a swing in the third
game to win it. which could have
been the difference."
In the fourth game, the Waves
pulled ahead at the start, and Stan
ford trailed by about 10 points the
entire game. Pepperdine sealed the
match with a 30-20 victory.
"I'm not very happy with the
way we finished that fourth game."
Shaw said. "I don't know what hap
pened there, but we fell apart after
being so competitive for three
games, so that kind of leaves a bit
ter taste in my mouth."
The players shared similar
sentiments.

"That fourth game, we kind of
had a letdown there," Hansen said.
"They have a pretty strong attack;
they have tall guys who are coming
at you. and that sort of wears you
out by the fourth game. After that
third game, we had a little mental
breakdown and couldn't come
back. It's a game of momentum."
Pepperdine dominated statisti
cally, hitting .310 in the fourth
game while Stanford had a -.032.
The Waves also outblocked the
Cardinal by a 15-4 margin.
"We just don't have an answer
for guys who can hit the ball that
hard," Shaw said. "It's like playing
an international team. That block is
as big as you'll see anywhere in the
world. With a block that big. it's
going to wear on you, both physi
cally and psychologically. It forces
hitting errors that we would not
normally make."
Stanford is now 2-3 for the sea
son and 1-1 in conference play.
Having split the weekend with a
win on Friday and a loss on Satur
day, they remain composed and
ready for more competition.
"It's tough to lose to those guys;
I've never beaten them, and it's
been four years," Hansen said.
"But it's a long season, so you're
going to have losses here and there.
You just have to keep bouncing
back after those losses. Next week
we have a pretty big week and a
game Wednesday, so we just have
to forget about this."
The game Wednesday is at Long
Beach State, a team that beat them 3-
2 in the bronze medal match of the
Santa Barbara tournament on Jan. 8.
The weekend started out on a positive
note for the men's volleyball team, with
fifth-year senior Kevin Hansen joining just
three other players in the history of Stan
ford volleyball to record more than 4000
career assists.
Hansen's milestone came during Fri
day's match

which the No.
8 Cardinal (2-
3,1-1 Pacific-10 Conference) won 3-0.
"I wasn't really following it much, but
it's pretty cool to be up with the big names
at Stanford," Hansen said. "I focus on our
team performance rather than mine. I'd
much rather win a national championship
than be the number-one assist leader of all
time."
With sophomore Josh Schwarzapel and
junior Nick Manov, both outside hitters out

due to injuries, it had been "kind of a weird
week in practice," said head coach Don
Shaw. "With two guys suddenly out of ac
tion, we just tried to piece together some
practices and get a good workout in."
Schwarzapel developed back pains dur
ing the Santa Barbara tournament last
weekend, and Manov has a sore shoulder.
Shaw said he was doubtful that either play
er would be able to do much for at least an
other week.
Did that factor into the match at all?
"Well, it does in a way." Shaw said.
"That takes away from our depth, and
depth is always an issue, especially when we
look down the bench and we don't have as
many guys to choose from."

As expected against the No. 12
Trojans, the No. 8 Cardinal did
emerge victorious. However. Stan
ford coaches and players felt that
there was room for improvement.
"1 think if we had played at a

I've never beaten them, and it's
been four years," Hansen said.
"But it's a long season, so you're
going to have losses here and there.
You just have to keep bouncing
back after those losses. Next week
we have a pretty big week and a
game Wednesday, so we just have
to forget about this."
The game Wednesday is at Long
Beach State, a team that beat them 3-
2 in the bronze medal match of the
Santa Barbara tournament on Jan. 8.
