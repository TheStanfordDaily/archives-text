The weekend started out on a positive
note for the men's volleyball team, with
fifth-year senior Kevin Hansen joining just
three other players in the history of Stan
ford volleyball to record more than 4000
career assists.
Hansen's milestone came during Fri
day's match
STANFORD 3, against South
use 0 ern California.
which the No.
8 Cardinal (2-
3,1-1 Pacific-10 Conference) won 3-0.
"I wasn't really following it much, but
it's pretty cool to be up with the big names
at Stanford," Hansen said. "I focus on our
team performance rather than mine. I'd
much rather win a national championship
than be the number-one assist leader of all
time."
With sophomore Josh Schwarzapel and
junior Nick Manov, both outside hitters out

due to injuries, it had been "kind of a weird
week in practice," said head coach Don
Shaw. "With two guys suddenly out of ac
tion, we just tried to piece together some
practices and get a good workout in."
Schwarzapel developed back pains dur
ing the Santa Barbara tournament last
weekend, and Manov has a sore shoulder.
Shaw said he was doubtful that either play
er would be able to do much for at least an
other week.
Did that factor into the match at all?
"Well, it does in a way." Shaw said.
"That takes away from our depth, and
depth is always an issue, especially when we
look down the bench and we don't have as
many guys to choose from."
However, the team proved that it was
ready to take on USC. never relinquishing
the lead as it pressed to a 30-25 win in the
first game. In the second game, the Cardi
nal wavered, falling behind USC more than
once before finally holding off the Trojans
