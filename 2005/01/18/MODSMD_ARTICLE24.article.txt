## 
### MIA ASHTON DESK EDITOR 
The No. 6 Cardinal men's gym
nastics team (1-0, 1-0 Pacific-10

Conference) had two surprises
during its victory over California
on Saturday: an upset win and the
age of the gymnasts responsible
for it.

Led by freshmen Sho
Nakaniori and David Sender,
Stanford beat the No. 5 Berkeley
squad by a margin of 2.075 points.
Nakamori, who has won one all
around and seven individual event
titles in his four visits to Junior
Olympic Nationals, grabbed first
place finishes on the floor exer
cise, parallel bars and high bar,
with scores of 9.4,9.5 and 9.65, re
spectively.
Classmate Sender placed with
in the top three on all five of his
events, which included a second
on floor and third on horse, rings
and high bar. But the two-time
vault champion at the U.S. Cham
pionships was unsurprisingly most
impressive on that apparatus, nail
ing first place with a score of 9.5.
Sender's performance on rings
was part of a Cardinal top-three
sweep that also featured young
gymnasts. Sophomores Peter Der
man and Alex Schorsch. who tied
for first with a 9.65, rounded out
the leaderboard in that event.
Stanford will host the Cardinal
Open this Friday through Sunday
in Burnham Pavilion.
