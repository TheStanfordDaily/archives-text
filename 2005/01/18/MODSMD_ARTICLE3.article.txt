# Unlocked doors lead to weekend thefts
## 
### KATIE BEARMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As winter quarter rolls on and
freshmen become more accustomed
to dorm life, many grow less con
cerned with keeping their doors
locked.
But after a number of expensive
items were stolen at Alondra on
Friday, residents may want to re
consider their lax attitudes toward
security.
Sometime between 11 p.m. and 1
a.m., two laptop computers, an
undisclosed amount of cash and var
ious articles of clothing were stolen
from student rooms in the East Flo
rence Moore residence.
According to Sergeant Tim Han

rahanofthe Stanford Police Depart
ment. the rooms from which the
items were taken are particularly
vulnerable to theft because they are
near an exit that opens onto May
field Avenue. At the time of the rob
bery, the room doors and the door
leading outside were all propped
open.
"Stanford is a relatively safe
place, but these things do happen,"
Hanrahan said. "11 p.m. to 1 a.m. is
the primary party time and a com
mon time for such incidents to
occur."
"Even though it's important to
lock doors, people are starting to be
careless about it," said senior Renee
Hudson, a resident assistant in Loro,
another dorm in Flo Mo.

Staff members in Alondra filed a
police report and sent an e-mail to
the dorm list about the robbery, but
RA Brian Salomaki said that they
are not doing much else to attempt to
prevent future thefts.
"It happened, and there's not re
ally much else to say," Salomaki
said.
"I feel sorry for the students
whose stuff got stolen, but there's
nothing you can really do." added
freshman Donna Meng.
Hanrahan said that dorm thieves
can be very difficult to catch.
"It's hard, because there is very
little evidence left over," Hanrahan
said. "Because there is no forced
entry, there aren't finger prints or
anything. We don't catch people as

often as we'd like."
Hanrahan said, however, that
the Stanford Folice Department
arrested thieves and recovered
stolen property a few weeks ago.
He attributes the success in appre
hending these criminals to students
who reported suspicious activity to
Stanford officers.
"We're really dependent on stu
dents for these leads." Hanrahan
said.
In the meantime. Sergeant Han
rahan and the FloMo resident assis
tants advise Stanford students to use
common sense.
"Keep doors locked, especially
during party times, even though
it's inconvenient," Hanrahan
said.
