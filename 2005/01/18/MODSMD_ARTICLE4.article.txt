# 'Non-alcoholic' frats? Not at Stanford
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Can you imagine KA without
beer pong? SAE without bar nights?
Sigma Chi without jungle juice?
Such anomalies are commonplace at
colleges like Northwestern, one of
about 30 colleges nationwide that
has enacted a "no alcohol" policy
for most on-campus fraternities in
recent years. According to a Jan. 9
article in the New York Times Mag
azine. 11 national and international
fraternities also require most of
their chapter houses to be alcohol
free. regardless of university rules.
While there are no plans to enact
a dry fraternity policy at Stanford,
the trend brings attention to the role
of alcohol in Greek life and its social
impact on the student body.
"Basically, without alcohol, the
idea of an on-campus party would be
dead." said senior Adam Ballew,
president of SAE.
Senior Victor Lin, house manager
of Sigma Nu. agreed. "Honestly, to
have a good social presence on cam
pus. you need to have alcohol." he
said.
Ballew said fraternities host on
campus parties as a service to the stu
dent body.
"Throwing parties places a huge
liability on frats, but it's safer than

drinking with a lot of people you
don't know off-campus. You also
don't have to worry about the trans
portation issue."
Ralph Castro, the chair of Stan
ford's Alcohol Advisory Board
and an alcohol and drug educator
at the Vaden Student Health Cen
ter, said the University has effec
tive party-planning guidelines en
suring that fraternities serve alco
hol responsibly.
Castro indicated that he did not
feel it was necessary for Stanford to
move toward a "no alcohol" policy
for its fraternities.
"Our fraternities throw some of
the best, well-thought out and pre
pared parties on our campus," Cas
tro wrote in an e-mail.
"Our policies and procedures are
directed toward encouraging stu
dents to make responsible choices,"
he said. "As students make good
choices and respect our policies and
procedures, the University is able to
treat them as adults."
Senior Graham Gilmer, presi
dent of Sigma Chi. pointed out that
because many fraternity members
are of legal drinking age. the Univer
sity should not prohibit alcohol con
sumption in the houses.
"The decision for Stanford to
eliminate alcohol in freshman dorms
made sense because no freshmen are

of legal drinking age, but about half
our members are 21. so there's no
reason why they shouldn't be al
lowed to drink in their own homes,"
he said.
Not surprisingly. Northwestern's
"no alcohol" policy has forced some
fraternity leaders to re-think their
house's social function.
Alcohol is not allowed in 13 of 17
Northwestern fraternities, including
Phi Delta Theta and Sigma Chi. As a
result, Theo Michels, a junior and
president of Phi Delta Theta, said his
house doesn't throw large parties on
campus.
"Most of our social events are
date parties," Michels said. "We
don't tend to have large numbers of
people at the house that often."
"There really aren't that many
differences between us and the wet
houses [that serve alcohol),"
Michel said. "It can be tough during
rush though because the wet houses
attract more students, but that just
means we have to work a little
harder."
Sophomore Diego Berdakin.
president of Sigma Chi at North
western. said the alcohol-free policy
contributes to attracting a niche of
students to rush.
"We aren't for people who want
to go to the rowdiest, craziest house
on campus," he said. "Our house is

for people who want to become suc
cessful adults."
At Stanford, restricting fraterni
ties from serving alcohol would shift
the social burden to other houses
and dorms, which could have a nega
tive impact.
Michael Albanese. a senior and
president of Kappa Sigma, said an al
cohol-free policy could deter stu
dents from participating in Greek
life because "pledging would mean
giving up their rights to social events
including alcohol."
Jared Lister, a senior, said he
joined SAE "to take advantage of
the community service opportunities
the house provides, and then to
drink expensive beer and think
about myself." He said he wouldn't
have joined a dry fraternity.
Albanese said that "fraternities
have accountability policies that up
perclassmen dorms and row houses
don't."
For example. Sigma Nu's consti
tution "requires us to hold our broth
ers accountable to never use and
abuse alcohol." Lin said.
"To have Moonsplash and Sun
splash," two of the fraternity's an
nual parties, "we have to write na
tional headquarters for permis
sion to serve alcohol," he added.
Many other Sigma Nu chapters
are alcohol-free.
