# SOCIAL INNOVATION
## The 						power of new ideas 
### DAVID BORNSTEIN GUEST COLUMNIST 
A few nights ago, I made the mistake of turning on
the TV news. As promised, in 22 minutes I was "given
the world" — that is, a world dominated by partisan
politics, terrorism and war. I turned off the TV and
resolved to stay away.
It's not that I can't handle bad news. I turn to the
news hoping to gain a faithful rendering of the world.
The problem is that the version of the "world" that
gets beamed into my home is like a badly doctored
photograph: like an image of a forest in which almost
all the trees have been edited out.
The desolate landscape left behind, I'm left to
believe, is "reality." To me, this impoverished depiction
of the world — omitting vast stretches of human activ
ity — is worse than useless; it is deadening.
But there is a hidden world out there that is very
exciting. 1 have spent the past five years traveling
around the globe, getting a glimpse of this world
through the eyes of a hundred "social entrepre
neurs" who are successfully advancing large-scale
social changes in their societies. There is a great
deal that is powerful and "newsworthy" that we do
not hear about.
In India, for example, a child-protection network
called Child-like, founded by a social worker, has pro
vided emergency assistance to hundreds of thousands
of street children and spread to 55 cities. In South
Africa, an organization called Tateni Home Care
Services, founded by a nurse, has trained thousands
of unemployed youth as home-care attendants —
advancing a simple model for delivering compas
sionate care to people with HIV / AIDS and
orphaned children.
In the United States, a Washington, D.C.-based
organization called College Summit, founded by a for
mer divinity student, has helped thousands of low
income students enroll in college (with a 79 percent
retention rate) and is now working with the public
schools in several cities to rebuild their college guid
ance systems.
Each of these organizations was founded by an
independent citizen; each was built up largely over the
past eight years; and each represents a fundamentally
new approach — a new model — for solving a partic
ular social problem in a given context. In fact, judging
from the millions of new organizations founded in
recent years by citizens around the world seeking to
address social problems, there are vastly more social
entrepreneurs out there than terrorists, and their
impact is both wider and deeper. But we rarely hear
about their work. What I have seen following around
social entrepreneurs for five years, I don't think I
would have seen if I had watched the TV news or read
the newspapers every day for 50.
Social entrepreneurs serve the same functions vis
a-vis social change as business entrepreneurs do vis-a
vis economic change: TTiey seize opportunities, gather
resources, build organizations, overcome resistance —
and, through a multi-decade process of marketing and
continual adjustment, they change patterns in their
industries and open up new opportunities for others.
From a global perspective, the emergence of the
field of social entrepreneurship represents a funda
mental reorganization of society and therefore pres
ents widespread opportunities. What has happened is
that the sector of society concerned with "social
value" — a sector that for centuries has been dominat
ed by top-down, command-and-control thinking — is
beginning to resemble a bottom-up market economy,
comprised of many emerging, decentralized, flexible
institutions founded by entrepreneurs in response to
felt needs. The result is a kind of "organized chaos" —
like a global bazaar of self-motivated citizens connect
ing with one another, as well as with businesses and
governments, and working together to co-create
responsive and adaptive solutions.
This story has a personal relevance for everybody.
People across the world share similar desires: They
love to build things: they enjov working with inspiring
colleagues: they seek to use their talents in ways that
bring security and recognition; and they want to have
some fun and feel that their work is meaningful. Of
course, not everyone would want to be a social entre
preneur, just as not everyone wants to start a business.
But today almost everyone has the option to craft
a new career in this field. Because social entrepreuner
ship is growing so fast and in so many directions, the
opportunities are wide open for people with diverse
interests and skills So if you are the kind of person
who would like to align what you are good at, what
you enjoy doing and what you care about — and have
real a impact — this is news worth watching.
