Serious Games: Beyond Practice Theory
Dr. Sherry Ortner
Professor of Anthropology, Columbia University
Tuesday, January 25 at 3:30 pm.
Building 110, Room 111-0
The idea of serious games is an attempt to get beyond
practice theory in a variety of ways -- to build on its basic
insights, but at the same time to make it more cultural,
political, historical, and critical.

In the bathroom and beyond:
• Report dripping sinks and running toilets to your
Housing Supervisor or by calling 3-2281 for
academic buildings.
• Don't flush trash down the toilet.
• Minimize time spent in the shower.
• Fill the basin rather than leave the water running
while shaving.
• Take your car to a local carwash (they will capture
and re-use the water) instead of washing it yourself.
