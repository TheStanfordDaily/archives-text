"We know we want to be lawyers, hut we don't know
what type," said senior Kristen Jones, president of Stan
ford's Black Pre-Law Society. "The purpose of this series
of lectures is to bring clarity to the pre-law community at
Stanford."
Last night in El Centro Chicano, a dozen students
gathered to listen to civil rights attorney Charles Bonner
speak about his career.
Growing up in Alabama, Bonner decided at an early
age that the social system of the United States was unjust,
biased and discriminatory.
"Life is a constant struggle," he said. "Freedom is a
constant struggle. We as individuals have to be relevant
in that struggle."
At 16. Bonner became involved with the Student Non
violent Coordination Committee, which was on the front
lines of the fight for social change during the 19605.
When Bonner and his fellow organizers at SNCC were
bailed out of jail by civil rights lawyers, he was inspired by
the power of the attorneys to negotiate with people who
were otherwise unapproachable.
It wasn't until the 19705, after living briefly in Tanza
nia, that Bonner decided to return to the United States
and gain the skills he needed in order to "serve the peo
ple."
Bonner attended the New College School of Law in
San Francisco and soon thereafter established a private
practice. He said he vehemently opposed the idea that
one cannot help people and earn a salary at the same time.
He emphasized that civil rights lawyers are genuine en
trepreneurs and that the practice of civil rights law allows
the opportunity to fight for justice and make a living si
multaneously.
As a civil rights attorney, he has yet to fight a case per
taining to the Patriot Act, which he said has weakened
many of the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens. He com
mented that portions of the Patriot Act have already been
ruled unconstitutional, and he encouraged the attendees
to fight such "big. fascist pieces of legislation."
He said lawyers, as "guardians of the Constitution,"

have the job of defending the people's constitutional
rights."Everyone has been oppressed by someone at
some time," he said. "Even the English were once ruled
by the Romans. If we don't work for social freedom, then
somebody is going to take it away from us."
Bonner also emphasized that people who do not nec
essarily wish to practice as trial lawyers should still con
sider law school. It provides an excellent framework for

critical analysis, a skill that is useful in many professional
careers, he said.
The next speaker in the Black Pre-Law Society's
speaker series will be Maya Harris, who works with the
American Civil Liberties Union in the field of public in
terest. The event is scheduled to take place on Apr. 19.
