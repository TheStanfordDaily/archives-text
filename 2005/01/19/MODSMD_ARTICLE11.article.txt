# Does this make me look fat?
## Beauty and / or brains?

Okay, UCLA has hotter girls
than Stanford does. So do
USC, UCSD, UCSB. and vir
tually every other school of
lower academic ranking than Stanford.
I accepted this fact a while ago. I heard
"Stanford girls are ugly" often enough

to give me
no other
choice,
though why
Stanford
guys
thought this
appropriate
to say in my
presence is
another
question.
I've
never
thought
Stanford
women
were partic-

ularly unattractive. I look around my
classes and all I see is a group of tanned,
toned, highlighted blondes in flip-flops
and pajama pants. It's not that the raw
material we're working with is of inferior
quality compared to what all the
acronym-happy universities are working
with, it's that we don't package as well.
Through rigorous empirical data col
lection and analysis, I have concluded
that Stanford women just don't spend as
much time getting primped and coiffed
to go to class as women at other schools
do. We're not going to put on little skirts
and chance pulling a Sharon Stone in
Basic Instinct when biking to class or
wear cute mules to trek from Suites to
the Quad. You walk a mile in our shoes
and then you can criticize us for choos
ing flip-flops over heels.
But it isn't even the packaging that is
the problem. Sure, we don't wear
make-up or perfectly chosen outfits
with purses that match our accessories,
but the taut, nubile bodies would be
enough to make us attractive, even
without waking up a half hour earlier to
blow-dry our hair and put on a second
coat of mascara, if our personalities
were more enticing.
Stanford women aren't unattractive
because of their looks, but because of
their brains. Smart women are not at
tractive.
Why? Is it because we don't fawn
over you like the girls in high school
did? Does it make you feel like less of a
man when we are as capable, intelligent
and independent as you are? Is it be
cause we won't feel intellectually ful
filled by ironing your boxers and bak
ing cookies for the PTA meetings?
Maureen Dowd reported in the New
York Times last week on a British study
that "found that a high I.Q. hampers a
woman's chance to get married, while it is
a plus for men. The prospect for marriage
increased by 35 percent for guys for each
16-point increase in 1.Q.; for women,
there is a 40 percent drop for each 16-
point rise." The article goes on to report,
basically, the more successful a man is,
the more attractive women find him,
while the opposite is true for women.
I'm not going to argue that Stanford
women, based solely on physical ap
pearance, are as attractive on average
as women at less academically rigorous
universities, because I don't think it is
true. However, I don't think the differ
ence is as extreme as Stanford men
make it out to be.
I think Stanford women don't try as
hard to make ourselves as attractive to
the opposite (or same) sex as women at
other schools do. Perhaps that's be
cause we'd prefer rocking the MCAT
or finishing our thesis research to dis
tracting the anonymous guy in Econ 1
with our overflowing decolletage and
chandelier earrings. Perhaps it's be
cause we learned early that "smart"
and "sexy" are antonyms to most men.
Or perhaps it's because the guys who
find intelligence to be a turnoff aren't
worth our time.
The guys doing the most complain
ing about Stanford women being ugly
are the ones not getting any. They're
the ones that any self-respecting (read,
sober) girl would never touch — the
ones who feel that finding a woman
their equal makes them less of a man,
the ugly ones or the meatheads who tell
jokes like, "why is there a window
above the sink? So a woman can have
her own point of view."
Okay, I actually love that joke, but
the point stands. If the guys were get
ting any. they wouldn't have so much
time to tell jokes.

that I haven't heard, e-mail me at

much time getting primped and coiffed
to go to class as women at other schools
do. We're not going to put on little skirts
and chance pulling a Sharon Stone in
Basic Instinct when biking to class or
wear cute mules to trek from Suites to
the Quad. You walk a mile in our shoes
and then you can criticize us for choos
ing flip-flops over heels.
But it isn't even the packaging that is
the problem. Sure, we don't wear
make-up or perfectly chosen outfits
with purses that match our accessories,
but the taut, nubile bodies would be
enough to make us attractive, even
without waking up a half hour earlier to
blow-dry our hair and put on a second
coat of mascara, if our personalities
were more enticing.
Stanford women aren't unattractive
because of their looks, but because of
their brains. Smart women are not at
tractive.
Why? Is it because we don't fawn
over you like the girls in high school
did? Does it make you feel like less of a
man when we are as capable, intelligent
and independent as you are? Is it be
cause we won't feel intellectually ful
filled by ironing your boxers and bak
ing cookies for the PTA meetings?
Maureen Dowd reported in the New
York Times last week on a British study
that "found that a high I.Q. hampers a
woman's chance to get married, while it is
a plus for men. The prospect for marriage
increased by 35 percent for guys for each
16-point increase in 1.Q.; for women,
there is a 40 percent drop for each 16-
point rise." The article goes on to report,
basically, the more successful a man is,
the more attractive women find him,
while the opposite is true for women.
I'm not going to argue that Stanford
women, based solely on physical ap
pearance, are as attractive on average
as women at less academically rigorous
universities, because I don't think it is
true. However, I don't think the differ
ence is as extreme as Stanford men
make it out to be.
I think Stanford women don't try as
hard to make ourselves as attractive to
the opposite (or same) sex as women at
other schools do. Perhaps that's be
cause we'd prefer rocking the MCAT
or finishing our thesis research to dis
tracting the anonymous guy in Econ 1
with our overflowing decolletage and
chandelier earrings. Perhaps it's be
cause we learned early that "smart"
and "sexy" are antonyms to most men.
Or perhaps it's because the guys who
find intelligence to be a turnoff aren't
worth our time.
The guys doing the most complain
ing about Stanford women being ugly
are the ones not getting any. They're
the ones that any self-respecting (read,
sober) girl would never touch — the
ones who feel that finding a woman
their equal makes them less of a man,
the ugly ones or the meatheads who tell
jokes like, "why is there a window
above the sink? So a woman can have
her own point of view."
Okay, I actually love that joke, but
the point stands. If the guys were get
ting any. they wouldn't have so much
time to tell jokes.

that I haven't heard, e-mail me at

Okay, UCLA has hotter girls
than Stanford does. So do
USC, UCSD, UCSB. and vir
tually every other school of
lower academic ranking than Stanford.
I accepted this fact a while ago. I heard
"Stanford girls are ugly" often enough

to give me
no other
choice,
though why
Stanford
guys
thought this
appropriate
to say in my
presence is
another
question.
I've
never
thought
Stanford
women
were partic-

ularly unattractive. I look around my
classes and all I see is a group of tanned,
toned, highlighted blondes in flip-flops
and pajama pants. It's not that the raw
material we're working with is of inferior
quality compared to what all the
acronym-happy universities are working
with, it's that we don't package as well.
Through rigorous empirical data col
lection and analysis, I have concluded
that Stanford women just don't spend as
much time getting primped and coiffed
to go to class as women at other schools
do. We're not going to put on little skirts
and chance pulling a Sharon Stone in
Basic Instinct when biking to class or
wear cute mules to trek from Suites to
the Quad. You walk a mile in our shoes
and then you can criticize us for choos
ing flip-flops over heels.
