# The 						freshman 15:
## The 						journey to that perfect seminar size 
### EMMA VAUGHN 
By the first Monday of winter quarter, sophomore Becky
Landen had her entire academic schedule figured out. Her
course load was manageable; and it included a colloquium
that was perfect for multiple reasons — it counted toward her
major, could be used as a writing-in-the-major course and
could possibly bolster her Stanford-in-Washington applica
tion.
When she walked into the classroom 15 minutes early at 1
p.m. there were already 12 people sitting around the seminar
table. By the time the professor walked in at 1:12 p.m., there
were 35. As the class began, more people started to creep in
and once they were through glancing over the syllabus, there
were more than 40 individuals crammed into the space.
Landen had not attended any colloquia before and had
never quite understood the difference between them and
seminars, but she assumed that not all 40 students would be
returning the following week. The professor apparently
agreed and had them all introduce themselves before writing
a short application explaining why they were interested in the
subject.
As they went around the table. Landen found herself in a
classroom full of experienced students who had seemingly at
tended Stanford for the sole purpose of taking this course.
She didn't need to wait for the confirmation e-mail to know
that she hadn't made the cut.
Landen is only one of the many this quarter who have had
to deal with the burden of over-enrollment. Students in all
fields of study have found themselves cut from small seminars
and colloquia due to size constraints.
"Everyone is getting kicked out of classes!" said sopho
more Courtney Mohl. "It's just hard because you have a
whole schedule outlined in your mind, and then you have to
re-work everything."
So who is to blame for this shortage?
The Registrar's Office says its responsibility is to listen to
the departments and professors.
"Departments and faculty determine if they want a cap on
enrollment in a particular class." explained Susan Maher of
the Registrar's office "[We] put that information into Axess,
but we don't determine it."
However, not all professors agree on the right size or ap
proach to seminars and colloquia. Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga, who teaches the popular course, "The Politics of Race
and Ethnicity," said that cutting students was essential to the
seminar's success.
"It changes the identity of the class if you accept too many
students," he said. "There is a fundamentally different feeling
in the classroom."
Fraga, who usually receives 40 to 50 applicants for his sem
inars, caps the class at around 20.
"I believe that the ideal number is 15," he remarked.
"When you go up from there it's difficult for everyone to have
the same opportunity to participate. But if I stopped there, I
would have five more angry students."
Political Science Prof. James Fearon is subject to the same
pressures from students, but keeps his class slightly larger.
"I find it hard to have a productive discussion seminar with
more than 26 or 27 students," he said. "I'd rather get it down
to 19 or 20, but because I am going to "ruin so many peoples
lives' if I don't allow them into the class. I add five or six."
There are some circumstances where the actual material
and equipment limit the number of students. Biology Prof.
Robert Sapolsky said that the projects and assignments for
his seminar are designed for exactly 10 people who each pur
sue their own distinct project. This is especially tough consid
ering that he is often picking from a pool of 600.

Other professors have specific strengths they are looking
for in the applications and backgrounds of students. Sapolsky
usually selects his students by how well they did in his pre
requisite lecture course, while Fraga chooses on the basis of
interest.
"It is not previous background or exposure," Fraga ex
plained. "It's how they articulate their interest in the subject.
I look for some insight that I think will contribute significant
ly to the nature of the discussions."
There are some professors who do not cap the number of
students who enroll in their classes. International Relations
Lecturer Ciili Drori accepts everyone who shows up to her
seminars.
"There is a cost to doing it, but I think there is a benefit and
I decided to bear the cost," she said." What brings a lot of fla
vor to the discussion is having students from all majors."
Sociology Prof. Susan England, who is teaching the popu
lar class "Sex and Love in Modern Society" for the first time
this quarter, took the same approach, allowing 350 students to
take the course, which she had originally planned for 100 stu
dents.
"My department will have to scramble for TA's and it will
be more work," she said. "But because I am really interested
in hearing from a lot of students their views on this topic. I de
cided to take it on."
That is when finding space for the class becomes a serious
problem. Many professors who allow in the extra students find
themselves with 40 students in a room that comfortably fits 15.

"It's driving us crazy," Fearon said." From the faculty side,
the room is never right. What it leads to is I'm teaching five
miles away in a terrible room that's not right for the course."
What are the possible solutions to these issues of size and
space? One suggestion is to break a seminar into two parts —
have a professor teach the same class at two different times.
However, that complicates the issue of teaching credits. A
professor is required to teach a set number of courses each
year, and if he or she splits a seminar into two parts, most
would expect each part to count as a separate course, some
times leading to conflict with the department chairs.
"That would be like teaching two distinct seminars,"
Fearon said.
So if it is necessary to go through this cutting process, what
can students do to assure themselves a spot? Many professors
simply select on the basis of seniority, assuming that under
classmen can take the course when the class is offered again.
Sophomore Rachel Dyke, an International Relations
major, agrees with the policy.
"I feel like I could get a lot more out of [upper-division
classes] and they'd be more valuable to me when I'm a junior
or senior," she said. "By then I will really know how to han
dle the workload and I'll be more willing to participate."
Many professors feel that students should be required to
sign up on Axess the quarter before with the three or four
classes they are intending to take. This way, professors and
students have an idea as to the size of the course and can pre
pare accordingly.

So if it is necessary to go through this cutting process, what
can students do to assure themselves a spot? Many professors
simply select on the basis of seniority, assuming that under
classmen can take the course when the class is offered again.
Sophomore Rachel Dyke, an International Relations
major, agrees with the policy.
"I feel like I could get a lot more out of [upper-division
classes] and they'd be more valuable to me when I'm a junior
or senior," she said. "By then I will really know how to han
dle the workload and I'll be more willing to participate."
Many professors feel that students should be required to
sign up on Axess the quarter before with the three or four
classes they are intending to take. This way, professors and
students have an idea as to the size of the course and can pre
pare accordingly.


ANASTACIAJUNQUEIRA-DEGARCIA/The Stanford Daily
By the first Monday of winter quarter, sophomore Becky
Landen had her entire academic schedule figured out. Her
course load was manageable; and it included a colloquium
that was perfect for multiple reasons — it counted toward her
major, could be used as a writing-in-the-major course and
could possibly bolster her Stanford-in-Washington applica
tion.
When she walked into the classroom 15 minutes early at 1
p.m. there were already 12 people sitting around the seminar
table. By the time the professor walked in at 1:12 p.m., there
were 35. As the class began, more people started to creep in
and once they were through glancing over the syllabus, there
were more than 40 individuals crammed into the space.
Landen had not attended any colloquia before and had
never quite understood the difference between them and
seminars, but she assumed that not all 40 students would be
returning the following week. The professor apparently
agreed and had them all introduce themselves before writing
a short application explaining why they were interested in the
subject.
As they went around the table. Landen found herself in a
classroom full of experienced students who had seemingly at
tended Stanford for the sole purpose of taking this course.
She didn't need to wait for the confirmation e-mail to know
that she hadn't made the cut.
Landen is only one of the many this quarter who have had
to deal with the burden of over-enrollment. Students in all
fields of study have found themselves cut from small seminars
and colloquia due to size constraints.
"Everyone is getting kicked out of classes!" said sopho
more Courtney Mohl. "It's just hard because you have a
whole schedule outlined in your mind, and then you have to
re-work everything."
So who is to blame for this shortage?
The Registrar's Office says its responsibility is to listen to
the departments and professors.
"Departments and faculty determine if they want a cap on
enrollment in a particular class." explained Susan Maher of
the Registrar's office "[We] put that information into Axess,
but we don't determine it."
However, not all professors agree on the right size or ap
proach to seminars and colloquia. Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga, who teaches the popular course, "The Politics of Race
and Ethnicity," said that cutting students was essential to the
seminar's success.
"It changes the identity of the class if you accept too many
students," he said. "There is a fundamentally different feeling
in the classroom."
Fraga, who usually receives 40 to 50 applicants for his sem
inars, caps the class at around 20.
"I believe that the ideal number is 15," he remarked.
"When you go up from there it's difficult for everyone to have
the same opportunity to participate. But if I stopped there, I
would have five more angry students."
Political Science Prof. James Fearon is subject to the same
pressures from students, but keeps his class slightly larger.
"I find it hard to have a productive discussion seminar with
more than 26 or 27 students," he said. "I'd rather get it down
to 19 or 20, but because I am going to "ruin so many peoples
lives' if I don't allow them into the class. I add five or six."
There are some circumstances where the actual material
and equipment limit the number of students. Biology Prof.
Robert Sapolsky said that the projects and assignments for
his seminar are designed for exactly 10 people who each pur
sue their own distinct project. This is especially tough consid
ering that he is often picking from a pool of 600.

Other professors have specific strengths they are looking
for in the applications and backgrounds of students. Sapolsky
usually selects his students by how well they did in his pre
requisite lecture course, while Fraga chooses on the basis of
interest.
"It is not previous background or exposure," Fraga ex
plained. "It's how they articulate their interest in the subject.
I look for some insight that I think will contribute significant
ly to the nature of the discussions."
There are some professors who do not cap the number of
students who enroll in their classes. International Relations
Lecturer Ciili Drori accepts everyone who shows up to her
seminars.
"There is a cost to doing it, but I think there is a benefit and
I decided to bear the cost," she said." What brings a lot of fla
vor to the discussion is having students from all majors."
Sociology Prof. Susan England, who is teaching the popu
lar class "Sex and Love in Modern Society" for the first time
this quarter, took the same approach, allowing 350 students to
take the course, which she had originally planned for 100 stu
dents.
"My department will have to scramble for TA's and it will
be more work," she said. "But because I am really interested
in hearing from a lot of students their views on this topic. I de
cided to take it on."
That is when finding space for the class becomes a serious
problem. Many professors who allow in the extra students find
themselves with 40 students in a room that comfortably fits 15.

"It's driving us crazy," Fearon said." From the faculty side,
the room is never right. What it leads to is I'm teaching five
miles away in a terrible room that's not right for the course."
What are the possible solutions to these issues of size and
space? One suggestion is to break a seminar into two parts —
have a professor teach the same class at two different times.
However, that complicates the issue of teaching credits. A
professor is required to teach a set number of courses each
year, and if he or she splits a seminar into two parts, most
would expect each part to count as a separate course, some
times leading to conflict with the department chairs.
"That would be like teaching two distinct seminars,"
Fearon said.
