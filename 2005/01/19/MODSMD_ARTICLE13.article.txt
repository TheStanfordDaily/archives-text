Daily staff writer Barrett W. Sheridan had a chance to talk
to Seth yesterday.
BS: Your Web site bills you as a comedic hypnotist, but se-

nior Joey Na
toli. who's or
ganizing the
event this Fri
day, calls yoli
an "erotic"
hypnotist.
JS: Maybe he
was just turned
on by my stage
presence. My
objective is to
get people to
laugh, but
some wild stuff
tends to hap
pen on stage.
At the Stan
ford show last
year we had

guys thinking they were Chippendale dancers and it was
all I could do to keep them from stripping onstage and
jumping out in the audience. I had to hold them hack. I
had one guy auditioning for an adult film with a chair as a
partner. He was pretty talented.
BS: Does fruit become involved at any point?
JS: We had a segment with bananas and some lovely ladies
doing things with the bananas. 1 had to have the younger
children leave.
BS: Have you ever erotically hypnotized a girlfriend?
JS: Yeah, why not? Wouldn't you, if you could?
BS: Absolutely.
JS: It makes fora more interesting night.
BS: Do you get really good deals when you buy a car?
JS: Hypnosis can be applied to sales techniques and all
areas of human influence, so it's very useful when closing
deals, negotiating rates, romancing people. In just about
every business it comes down to your ability to use influ
ence and intuition.
BS: You were at Stanford last year fora performance. Did
you notice a greater than normal level of subconscious
sexual repression among Stanford students?
JS: No, but it always makes my job easier when there are
creative, intelligent, focused people onstage and in the au
dience. A lot of people have a misperception; they think it
takes weak-willed people to be hypnotized. It's the com
plete opposite. They have to be able to focus completely
on my instructions, and then use their creativity to inter
pret them well.

BS: So Stanford students are easier to hypnotize?
JS: I think you guys are maybe halfway hypnotized al
ready. You guys are in class all day and studying all night,
so it doesn't take that much extra effort to put you guys to
sleep. Being in a hypnotic state is very relaxing. One hour
of hypnosis sleep is equal to eight hours of real sleep.
BS: I never get selected to go on stage during hypnosis
shows, even though I always volunteer. Any tips?
JS: Stop pissing off the hypnotist.
BS: But I don't even get to the stage, I don't have a chance
to piss him off.
JS: At Stanford last year, there were about 400 people in
the audience, half of them trying to rush the stage, and 1
can only handle so many. A hypnotist is looking for gen
uine enthusiasm. I give hypnotic pretests, where everyone
in the audience gets to experience it. The key to being able
to be hypnotized is to want to be hypnotized. If people are
there just to try to prove they can't be hypnotized, they're
just working against themselves.
BS: You did some vampire voices for "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer." Could you use hypnotism to kill a vampire? Or
do you need a soul to be hypnotizable?
JS: What are they putting in the water up there that you'd
think of such a question ?
BS: What would happen if two hypnotists engaged in
hypno-battle?
JS: That'd be pretty cool. It'd be sort of like Gandalf and
Saruman. fighting in the tower. lt d be like that but with
more sleeping.
