## Editorial Prioritize Suites for upperclassmen 
### 
Due to a lack of singles and on-campus
apartment-style housing, living at Suites
should be reserved for juniors and seniors.
As Suites is isolated from the rest of cam
pus, it offers the perfect environment for upperclass
men. and at the same time, a less-than-ideal situation
for sophomores to live. In the past. Residential Edu

There is a scarcity of singles at Stanford compared
to the number of people that want them, which
makes Suites — which consists of suites of four, six
or eight singles — an especially desirable place to
live. In Suites, not only do students have their own
rooms, but they can enjoy the company of their draw
mates in their shared common area.
However, not all upperclassmen who want to
draw into Suites get the opportunity. The cutoff fora
six-person suite is around l,b()(). Juniors who draw

makes no distinction between students' class stand

dent could get good housing all years, but an unlucky
student might never live somewhere he or she wants
to — even senior year.
Changing the entire housing system to ensure that
all students get good housing for at least one of their
four years would be difficult, although ideal. Howev
er, making Suites upperclass-only housing would
give at least some extra weight to seniority to the
housing system, even if it would not be a perfect so
lution.
A living situation such as Suites, where students
tend to mainly hang out with their suitemates, is not
as suitable for sophomores, who are usually still
looking to make new friends. On the other hand, ju
niors and seniors who already have many established
relationships on campus don't mind the insularity.
In an ideal world, ResEd would have resources to
please everybody. However, because of housing
scarcity, ResEd should do the next best thing and
allow seniority to determine priority in Suites.
