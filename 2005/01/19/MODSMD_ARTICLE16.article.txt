## Silence not so golden for The Daily 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM 
Is The Daily doing its job as a stu
dent newspaper if it isn't pissing any
body off?
If the answer to this question is
"no," then The Daily's editors should
be shaking in their booties. The last
several weeks of coverage have left
my inbox desiccated and the Letters
to the Editor section more or less
nonexistent, suggesting either that
people have stopped reading The
Daily altogether or that readers do
not think that anything The Daily has
printed in the recent past has warrant
ed a response.
Running with the second (and
more likely) explanation, we come
back to our original question — Can a
student newspaper with a silent read
ership be fulfilling its intended role on
campus? My answer: yes and no.
It is in my opinion a harmful falla
cy that fora student newspaper to be
good, it has to incessantly ruffle the
feathers of the University and create a
procession of angered professors, ad
ministrators or whoever else stands in
the way of the newspaper (which the
oretically represents the student
body) and their cause.
At times as a Stanford student and
someone involved with The Daily, I
can remember when in the minds of
top editors the quality of the paper
was judged not by the issues it was
raising or the stories it was telling, but
rather by how many angry responses
the editors would receive. The logic?
If they're mad, that's because we're
writing things they don't want people
to know — and therefore we're doing
our job. The problem with this argu
ment is that misrepresentation, incor
rect reporting and unfair coverage can
also make people mad — but in those
cases, a newspaper is not doing its job.
This question reminds me of an e
mail 1 received in November, claiming
that these Readership Editor columns
seem to "say nothing more than, 'well.

we did this and that, but overall we're
fantastic.' " While this reader pointed
to specific aspects of The Daily's cov
erage that I had not written about and
he felt needed to be improved, the un
derlying argument of the e-mail is if
the Readership Editor isn't dropping
the hatchet and making the newspa
per staff mad, then she is not doing her
job.
1 disagreed. First, don't assume the
newspaper staff isn't mad . .. But
also, is the role of a critic to incessant
ly pick apart what the paper does?
Not necessarily — it's to consider the
good with the bad. Sometimes readers
have had concerns with the paper that
1 agreed with; other times I've thought
that the newspaper acted correctly.
Similarly, The Daily's role is not
necessarily to wait for any sign of con
troversy and then launch into attack
mode. An un-enraged readership
does not necessarily imply that a
newspaper is slacking on addressing
controversial issues or that it is not ad
equately working for the students (as
well as the faculty and administrators)
that it serves.
While an angered readership isn't
a necessary indicator of a successful
paper, an involved readership gener
ally is. The Daily should be concerned
that readers have not lately been suffi
ciently interested or inspired by its
stories (and I'm excluding columns
from this category) to write in re
sponse. The issue does not seem to be
one of gaping coverage — a quick
comparison with the Stanford News
Service shows that The Daily is at
least not dropping the ball on its cov
erage of University news. Rather,
some of the paper's most interesting
stories could be pushed to ask harder
questions — and give readers some
thing to respond to.
Some examples: The Daily ran a
story on the Winter Quarter housing
crunch that discussed adding rooms to
houses on campus and how students
returning to Stanford were dealing

with these changes — but didn't talk
about some of the issues this created
for students already in these houses.
With losses in lounge space, was each
resident still getting the amount of
total "per person" space specified by
the University, and how are the hous
es themselves coping with these
changes?
The Daily also recently ran a story
on Steve Jobs being named the 2005
Commencement Speaker, citing his
selection by a committee that the
paper did not mention was newly
formed. How and why was the speak
er selection process changed, and
what effect will that have on future
speaker choices?
Finally. The Daily has also recent
ly run an article about IJniversity
built soccer fields and future land use
rights — a topic that arouses more
passions (albeit not necessarily
among students) than almost any
other issue I ever dealt with as a re
porter for the paper.
Yet this contention is not entirely
visible in The Daily's article. What do
Palo Alto residents think, or members
of the Palo Alto City Council? Does
this have broader implications for the
University in terms of its future efforts
to expand? And for students who un
derstandably find this issue esoteric,
what does this mean for them?
These angles on stories aren't like
ly to get readers up in arms, but they
do pose larger questions that are rele
vant to readers and might just get
them to respond. Good story selec
tion is a start, but not always enough.
The Daily needs to figure out why
its readers have become mute, and the
sooner they do the better — respon
sive readers give me something to
write about.
