## A 						matter of life and death

By the time you're reading
this, he'll probably already
be dead. Barring some un
expected last minute
clemency by Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger or any successful
last minute judicial appeal, the
great state of California — home to
you and me and thirty-five million
others — will have the blood of
Donald Beardslee on its hands.
What better time to reopen the
death penalty argument and re
assess the value that our society
places on life.
The notions of deterrence and
retribution are the two most com
mon set forth by death penalty ad
vocates. Each fails upon closer in
spection.

Even most
death penalty
advocates will
concede that
there is little evi
dence that soci
eties without
death penalties
have higher mur
der rates than
those that do.
Take, for ex-

ample, the American South. The
South accounted for 86 percent of
all U.S. executions in 2(H)2 and has
accounted for 82 percent since
1976.
II deterrence were to be a valid
theory, one would expect the mur
der rate to have declined in the
South over these years.
Wrong.
In 2(H)2, the murder rate actually
increased by 2.1 percent, according
to the FBI. Contrast this with the
Northeast, which has accounted for
a mere 1 percent of all U.S. execu
tions since 1976 and saw its murder
rate drop by 4.8 percent in 2002. In
teresting ...
Okay, so deterrence is out. Re
tribution. even I will admit, is a lit
tle bit stickier.
Can I say with absolute certainty
that I would not want to kill some
body who has murdered someone
close to me? No. I'm not sure any
body can say that ex ante. Emotions
are unpredictable.
But do we want our emotions
guiding our criminal justice system?
Fine, we'll let all of our other laws
be based on reason and logic and
their consequences except the one
that deals with ending the lives of

others.
Scott Peterson should die be
cause it will make me feel better? I
think we can do better than that.
The problems inherent in the ad
ministration of the death penalty
should be enough to end the practice.
Between 1977 and 2000, the
state of Illinois overturned more
death penalty verdicts than it car
ried out. This was enough to con
vince the Republican governor,
George Ryan, to impose a morato
rium on the state's death penalty.
The proportions of black and
Hispanic defendants in death
penalty cases are greater than their
representation in the overall popu
lation. according to the Depart
ment of Justice.
Furthermore, the death penalty
is more likely to be sought in a case
against a black or Hispanic defen
dant than in a case against a white
defendant.
The Eighth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States
prohibits cruel and unusual punish
ment. At the time of the penning of
the Constitution, the death penalty
had been around since the begin
ning of memory and was taken for
granted.
But so had a lot of other stuff.
Take slavery, for example. The
founders never intended to abolish
slavery and even went so far as to
dehumanize slaves in the Constitu
tion by counting them as three
fifths of a person.
Society's mores have changed a
lot since the 18th century. Not only
is it illegal to hold slaves, but
women are considered equal to
men. everyone can vote and eight
year old children are protected
from working 80-hour weeks in tim
ber mills.
But the death penalty remains.
And because we no longer behead
people in town squares, we are
somehow supposed to feel better
about it.
We shouldn't. Our government
still kills its own citizens. And so
long as Texas is holding the reigns,
don't look for this to change any
time soon.

If you believe that the Constitution is
a living document and thut it should
he construed to prohibit the death
penalty in this day tn age, contact
