### NICK PARKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At the ASSU Undergraduate Senate meeting
last night, senators heard arguments for and against
a bill regarding investment disclosure of University
funds.
The Senate also voted against a bill that would
have changed the application process for the Stan
ford Student Enterprises chief executive officer /
ASSU financial manager position.
At last Thursday's ASSU Advocacy Committee
meeting, senators voted 8-1-0 in favor of drafting a
bill that would increase dialogue between the Uni
versity's Board of Trustees and students, thereby
supporting movement toward investment disclo
sure.
Last night, members from the Stanford Coalition
for Investment Disclosure, or SCID. talked to the
Senate about the benefits of disclosure. Senior Joey
Natoli, chair of Absolute Fun. defended the Univer
sity's policy of withholding the details of its invest
ments.
Stanford does not have to reveal the details of its
investments because it is a nonprofit institution. In
the past. University administrators have not dis
closed information because of liability concerns and
the risk of profit loss.
Seniors Naomi Ullian and Raphael Ginsburg,
who represented SCID at the meeting, told the sen
ators that students deserve to know how the Uni
versity spends its money. They alleged that Stanford
has a history of irresponsibility with its $12.2 billion
endowment.
"Only a few years ago, Stanford was supporting
slave labor in Burma, and of course, Stanford had
deep financial ties to the apartheid government in
South Africa," Ginsburg said.
"We need investment disclosure
and greater student involvement in
ethical oversight to make sure such
things aren't being done in our
name. Only when we know where
Stanford's money is going will we be
able to make sure it is not being mis
used."
The SC'II) representatives also
explained that members of the
Board of Trustees are the only peo
ple who have any clue what is hap
pening with the endowment. They
said there is a strong consensus
among students that the University
needs to move toward investment
disclosure.
In response, Natoli told the Sen
ate that while Stanford's overall en
dowment is the second largest in the
country, its per capita endowment is
fifth, the University has half of what
Harvard and Princeton have per stu
dent.
He noted that the University
could spend about $h4S,(XX) per stu
dent, while Harvard, which Natoli
called the "gold standard," could
