## President should lead by example in upcoming inauguration 
### PACO TORRES 
The cost of the galas for George
W. Bush's Friday inauguration is es
timated at around $40 million before
security costs. Yet. while the Presi
dent indulges himself in this extrav
agant celebration, there are millions
worldwide struggling to see the next
sunrise.
In South Asia, millions are with
out the basic necessities of life,
struggling to find food and shelter.
The tsunami of three weeks ago
wiped out entire regions of Indone
sia and Sri Lanka, killing more than
150,000 people. The potential out
break of disease looms over the en
tire region, threatening to kill an
amount greater than from the tsuna

mi alone.
For the cost of $40 million,
how many starving victims in
Asia could be fed and provided
with healthcare?
This is not to say that the inaugu
ration should be cancelled. It is an
undoubtedly proud national tradi
tion, celebrating the resiliency of the
Constitution and affirming that the
office of the presidency outlives its
occupants.
However, this president has
faced criticism from detractors, for
eign and domestic. Republican and
Democratic, regarding his response
to the Asian tsunamis. Many have
attacked his decision to wait three
days to speak publicly about the cri
sis. as well as his initial pledge of $35

million in federal aid — an amount
notably less than the budget for his
inauguration. The president missed
an opportunity to reaffirm Ameri
ca's role as a world leader by delay
ing his remarks and promising so
paltry an amount in aid.
Many around the world view this
president as an American king, a
commander-in-chief who arrogantly
thumbs his nose at the rest of the in
ternational community — an image
reinforced by his weak response to
the Asian crisis.
His impending inauguration,
however, provides the president
with another opportunity to gain in
ternational goodwill. He should can
cel all of the festivities surrounding
his inauguration, save for the swear

ing-in ceremony, and ask that the
donors funding the inaugural balls
instead donate the money to aid for
the Asian crisis.
What better way for this "king"
to reach out to a suspicious world
than to forgo his coronation?
It has been said that occupying
the office of president is all about
character. Indeed, this president was
re-elected in large part because of
voters' confidence in his "moral
fiber." If leading the world's remain
ing superpower is the ultimate test
of that character, then the person
occupying that office has the respon
sibility to lead the American people
and the world by example.
By canceling all of the extrava
gances that have become associated

with inaugurations, he demonstrates
the conviction that it is improper to
celebrate while so many worldwide
endure unimaginable suffering.
Such an act would not be unprece
dented; past presidents have elected
to scale back their inaugural cele
brations during times of war.
It remains to be seen if the cur
rent occupant of the Oval Office can
learn from their example and exhib
it the character required of the pres
idency.
