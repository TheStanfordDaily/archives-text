# Holt's Harangue
## Taking the class shopping system to the next level 
### CHRIS HOLT 
Last week's Daily editorial en
couraged reform of the shopping
system. The shopping system, if
you are unaware, allows students to
shop classes like they are stores in
an educational mall. Fuzzy classes,
therefore, would be the shoe stores
of this mall because women seem to
be naturally drawn to them.
Let's face it — the shopping sys
tem is integral to the Stanford ex
perience. The only thing worse
would be to not have these choices.
How many people have you heard
say, "Boy, I wish I had more re
quired courses to dictate my sched
ule," or, "Life would be simpler if 1
had I-Hum every quarter"?
But I'll admit, as great as the sys
tem is, it does have its flaws. The
Daily's editorial cites the major
problems with shopping classes:
Students feel burnt out after the
first two weeks of school, and Stan
ford students are generally over
worked as it is. Simply put, as smart
as we all are, we become like moths
to light bulbs when it comes to edu
cation — we don't know when we
are getting burned.
The other problem with the sys
tem is that teachers feel they have
to sell their class during the first
meetings, thus wasting students'
and the professor's time. The Daily
asserts that the best solution to the

problem is to give students a better
understanding of the class before
they take it — via the Internet. But
as you all know. The Daily giving
advice is like Prince Harry giving
out costume ideas.
So while I think The Daily is
onto something, I think it needs to
take the idea further. What if in
stead of just posting the syllabus
onto the Web site, they really did
try to sell their class to the students.
Literally. Hire some Web design
ers, post some links, put in a sound
track, really jazz it up.
"Shakespeare's Plays" could
offer "FREE $$$ NOW!!!" for the
10-millionth visitor of the site.
Econ 51 could try to lure students
by posting a link to a pirated copy
of "Star Wars Episode III." Chem
30 could have pictures of Playboy
bunnies — all former students of
the class.
But even spiffy Web sites might
not be enough. I mean, professors
are still selling the class, which is a
bad thing. You really can't sell an
education; an education is priceless
and should not be degraded to sim
ple monetary value (cough, 40k a
year).
So in addition to having the syl
labus. why not also have recorded
messages from the professors, or
perhaps lectures of past years?
Maybe have the Web sites contain
personal profiles, like on Theface

book.com. You could drive your
Math teacher nuts by poking him
constantly. Or you could frighten
him in class by referring to person
al information he may not want you
to know: "Hey prof, if I fail this
quiz, I'm going to cry like you did
during 'A Walk to Remember.' "
As good as this all seems, I have
an even better idea. Everyone
raves about the approachability of
Stanford professors, and I whole
heartedly agree. I think some of the
most rewarding educational expe
riences I've had are meals with my
professors. I didn't get to do that
until very late in the quarter,
though.
What if we had student-profes
sor dinners before classes started?
Have your professors wine and
dine you, so to speak. The profes
sors would get the opportunity to
talk frankly about the class, and if
you didn't like them, you could pre
tend to loudly break up with him /
her in the restaurant and embarrass
him thoroughly.
You might be even able to hag
gle a bit. Explain to them that, well,
class looks nice and all, but hey.
Prof, (fill in the blank) is offering
class later in the day and no home
work on the weekends. What can
you throw in?
You might be able to talk your
professor into an easy A, or maybe
talk him out of having a class at 9

a.m. Maybe if he throws in a really
hot TA, you'll agree to show up to
lecture every day.
Maybe my suggestions aren't
going to pan out. Most professors
won't haggle because they are
"busy" or have "ethics." So I guess
without reforms, the administra
tion might be forced to do some
thing drastic.
For instance, it might insist stu
dents register for classes online be
fore classes begin, and to determine
who gets into what class, have a
screwy priority / lottery system that
makes everybody unhappy. Then,
it could make it really hard to
change classes and nearly impossi
ble to get the required courses you
need for your major.
That way, professors could have
a lot of students in classes they
don't want, with the potential that
because of waitlists and overcrowd
ing, they cannot graduate on time
because they don't get the classes
they need for their major. Hey, it
works for Cal — it could work for
us, right?

Chris apologizes for making an
easy joke out of Ca/'s system, which
for all he knows, could work really
well Send complaints to cholt @
Stanford, edu.
