## Two title runs in Menlo 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team (3-2, 0-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) logged some valuable
mat time and earned a fourth-place finish this
past Sunday in the Menlo College Invitation
al. Nevertheless, the team also had one eye on
its upcoming road trip to lowa, where the
team will face Lock Haven University (3-2)
and national powerhouse No. 3 lowa State
(12-0). In preparation, many of the Cardinal's
starters sat out during the tournament.
"We wanted to get mat time, plain and
simple,'' said head coach Steve Buddie. "Any
time our guys can compete against new faces,
it is a competition worth attending. So. it was
great seeing many of our athletes on the mats
that don't get to compete week in and week
out. We also had two starters who wanted
more mat time, while 1 encouraged others to
prepare for the upcoming busy schedule."
Stanford had a total of 46 team points, to
finish behind Southern Oregon (69). Menlo
(59) and San Francisco State (47.5). The Car
dinal were led by title runs from freshman
Scott Loescher at 165-pounds and junior
Brennan Corbett at 174-pounds.

Loescher was one of the few Cardinal
starters to wrestle on Sunday. He cruised to
the title bout via a 19-6 major decision over
Muhammed Abdul-Qadir from Southwest
Oregon, an opponent injury forfeit and a 5-0
decision over Menlo's Junior Liberal.
Loescher closed out his first-place finish with
a narrow 5-4 decision against Jimmy Grow
chowsky of Southern Oregon in the finals.
"Loescher performed very well. Our ex
pectation for him has always been high," Bud
die said. "As a starter, he could have taken
the weekend off, but he had some things he
wanted to work on. so big props to him for
pushing himself and performing well."
The biggest highlight of the tournament
for the coaching staff was Corbett's 4-0 run.
His victories included a 16-0 technical fall vic
tory over Indianapolis' Bill Pippens and a se
ries of three close decisions, which culminat
ed in a 5-3 victory over Southern Oregon's
James Mannenbach for the top spot.
"Brennan comes immediately to mind [as a
standout performance]," Buddie said. "Bren
nan has been such a huge part of our team for
years now, but has been hampered by injuries.
