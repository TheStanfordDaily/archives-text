## Two title runs in Menlo 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team (3-2, 0-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) logged some valuable
mat time and earned a fourth-place finish this
past Sunday in the Menlo College Invitation
al. Nevertheless, the team also had one eye on
its upcoming road trip to lowa, where the
team will face Lock Haven University (3-2)
and national powerhouse No. 3 lowa State
(12-0). In preparation, many of the Cardinal's
starters sat out during the tournament.
"We wanted to get mat time, plain and
simple,'' said head coach Steve Buddie. "Any
time our guys can compete against new faces,
it is a competition worth attending. So. it was
great seeing many of our athletes on the mats
that don't get to compete week in and week
out. We also had two starters who wanted
more mat time, while 1 encouraged others to
prepare for the upcoming busy schedule."
Stanford had a total of 46 team points, to
finish behind Southern Oregon (69). Menlo
(59) and San Francisco State (47.5). The Car
dinal were led by title runs from freshman
Scott Loescher at 165-pounds and junior
Brennan Corbett at 174-pounds.

Loescher was one of the few Cardinal
starters to wrestle on Sunday. He cruised to
the title bout via a 19-6 major decision over
Muhammed Abdul-Qadir from Southwest
Oregon, an opponent injury forfeit and a 5-0
decision over Menlo's Junior Liberal.
Loescher closed out his first-place finish with
a narrow 5-4 decision against Jimmy Grow
chowsky of Southern Oregon in the finals.
"Loescher performed very well. Our ex
pectation for him has always been high," Bud
die said. "As a starter, he could have taken
the weekend off, but he had some things he
wanted to work on. so big props to him for
pushing himself and performing well."
The biggest highlight of the tournament
for the coaching staff was Corbett's 4-0 run.
His victories included a 16-0 technical fall vic
tory over Indianapolis' Bill Pippens and a se
ries of three close decisions, which culminat
ed in a 5-3 victory over Southern Oregon's
James Mannenbach for the top spot.
"Brennan comes immediately to mind [as a
standout performance]," Buddie said. "Bren
nan has been such a huge part of our team for
years now, but has been hampered by injuries.
It was great seeing him not only feel
good physically throughout the day,
but performing at a level he's always
been capable of. It was a big spark
for our team."
The Cardinal had four other
place-winners. Junior Ray Blake
took third in the 165-pound weight
class. Blake went 5-1 in the invita
tional and was able to avenge his
only loss to Menlo's Liberal by de
feating him the second time around
6-4 in the third-place match.
Junior Mark Egesdal went 2-1 in
the tournament and notched a sec
ond-place finish at 184. Egesdal
recorded two pins in his first two
matches against Ryan Lynch of
SUNY-Oneonta and Mike Croffut
of Southwest Oregon. Both pins
combined took less than three min
utes. Egesdal lost a 5-1 decision in
the finals to David O'Brian of

Southern Oregon.
"Egesdal also stepped up and
had a great tournament," Buddie
said. "He is also someone who has
been long overdue and deserved a
trip to the finals."
One of the most important stats
of the weekend, however, is the
lack of new injuries. The Cardinal
entered the weekend with the
hopes of gaining experience with
out the cost of losing a wrestler. As
of now, the coaching staff expects
the complete starting 10 to com
pete. Stanford will need all its guns
to play the role of giant-slayer
against the highly touted Cyclone
wrestlers, who are off to their best
start since the 1985-86 season.
"We always hit the road aiming
to wrestle our style." Buddie said.
"We believe in exciting wrestling,
always looking to score. If we stay

in that mindset, we could heat the
No. 3 team in the country."
"No one nationally thinks we
will be in the dual with lowa State,
hut I know our team can pull off the
upset," Buddie added. "I really
think we match up with them better
than many people may think."
In order to be up to the task, the
Cardinal have been looking to get
more pins so that they can rack up
more team points. There has also
been some concern about slow starts
that put the team in a significant hole.
After achieving moderate suc
cess this weekend, the Cardinal can
finally put the preparation of the
past couple weeks into practice in
the Midwest. Stanford has no
doubt been eyeing lowa State, and
now it is time for the team to take
its shot at proving itself against the
Cyclone colossus.

chowsky of Southern Oregon in the finals.
"Loescher performed very well. Our ex
pectation for him has always been high," Bud
die said. "As a starter, he could have taken
the weekend off, but he had some things he
wanted to work on. so big props to him for
pushing himself and performing well."
The biggest highlight of the tournament
for the coaching staff was Corbett's 4-0 run.
His victories included a 16-0 technical fall vic
tory over Indianapolis' Bill Pippens and a se
ries of three close decisions, which culminat
ed in a 5-3 victory over Southern Oregon's
James Mannenbach for the top spot.
"Brennan comes immediately to mind [as a
standout performance]," Buddie said. "Bren
nan has been such a huge part of our team for
years now, but has been hampered by injuries.
It was great seeing him not only feel
good physically throughout the day,
but performing at a level he's always
been capable of. It was a big spark
for our team."
The Cardinal had four other
place-winners. Junior Ray Blake
took third in the 165-pound weight
class. Blake went 5-1 in the invita
tional and was able to avenge his
only loss to Menlo's Liberal by de
feating him the second time around
6-4 in the third-place match.
Junior Mark Egesdal went 2-1 in
the tournament and notched a sec
ond-place finish at 184. Egesdal
recorded two pins in his first two
matches against Ryan Lynch of
SUNY-Oneonta and Mike Croffut
of Southwest Oregon. Both pins
combined took less than three min
utes. Egesdal lost a 5-1 decision in
the finals to David O'Brian of

Southern Oregon.
"Egesdal also stepped up and
had a great tournament," Buddie
said. "He is also someone who has
been long overdue and deserved a
trip to the finals."
One of the most important stats
of the weekend, however, is the
lack of new injuries. The Cardinal
entered the weekend with the
hopes of gaining experience with
out the cost of losing a wrestler. As
of now, the coaching staff expects
the complete starting 10 to com
pete. Stanford will need all its guns
to play the role of giant-slayer
against the highly touted Cyclone
wrestlers, who are off to their best
start since the 1985-86 season.
"We always hit the road aiming
to wrestle our style." Buddie said.
"We believe in exciting wrestling,
always looking to score. If we stay

in that mindset, we could heat the
No. 3 team in the country."
"No one nationally thinks we
will be in the dual with lowa State,
hut I know our team can pull off the
upset," Buddie added. "I really
think we match up with them better
than many people may think."
In order to be up to the task, the
Cardinal have been looking to get
more pins so that they can rack up
more team points. There has also
been some concern about slow starts
that put the team in a significant hole.
After achieving moderate suc
cess this weekend, the Cardinal can
finally put the preparation of the
past couple weeks into practice in
the Midwest. Stanford has no
doubt been eyeing lowa State, and
now it is time for the team to take
its shot at proving itself against the
Cyclone colossus.

Coaches look forward to
healthy starting roster
The Stanford wrestling team (3-2, 0-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) logged some valuable
mat time and earned a fourth-place finish this
past Sunday in the Menlo College Invitation
al. Nevertheless, the team also had one eye on
its upcoming road trip to lowa, where the
team will face Lock Haven University (3-2)
and national powerhouse No. 3 lowa State
(12-0). In preparation, many of the Cardinal's
starters sat out during the tournament.
"We wanted to get mat time, plain and
simple,'' said head coach Steve Buddie. "Any
time our guys can compete against new faces,
it is a competition worth attending. So. it was
great seeing many of our athletes on the mats
that don't get to compete week in and week
out. We also had two starters who wanted
more mat time, while 1 encouraged others to
prepare for the upcoming busy schedule."
Stanford had a total of 46 team points, to
finish behind Southern Oregon (69). Menlo
(59) and San Francisco State (47.5). The Car
dinal were led by title runs from freshman
Scott Loescher at 165-pounds and junior
Brennan Corbett at 174-pounds.

Loescher was one of the few Cardinal
starters to wrestle on Sunday. He cruised to
the title bout via a 19-6 major decision over
Muhammed Abdul-Qadir from Southwest
Oregon, an opponent injury forfeit and a 5-0
decision over Menlo's Junior Liberal.
