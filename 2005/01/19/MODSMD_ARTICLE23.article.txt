# Dual wins in singles, doubles for Burdette
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
From the expected chaos of sending eight
players to the Pacific-10 Conference Indoor
Championship and Freeman Memorial
tournaments this weekend, the No. 1 Stan
ford women's tennis team (1-0) emerged
tired, sore, and ecstatic about its singles and
doubles earnings in both events.
This weekend's results added two more
titles to the Cardinal's stunning record,
which now includes 13 NCAA and 17 Pac-10
league honors.
Those are two more reminders for the
rest of the tennis nation that Stanford's aim
to repeat its 2004 fairytale season is very real
indeed.
Last April's unexpected pairing of junior
Alice Barnes and senior Erin Burdette at
the Pac-10 Individual Championship has de
veloped into a thoughtful and effective tan
dem. one which turns long-shot victories
into a long-standing routine. The top-seed
ed duo survived tight 8-6 wins in the semifi

nals and finals, depriving Oregon's Domini
ka Dieskova and Daria Panova of the dou
bles title.
For No. 22 Burdette (9-2), whose perfor
mance at Pac-10 in Seattle garnered her first
singles title since 2001, the promising results
of this weekend hold special worth.
Backed by three straight-set wins, Bur
dette powered to the finish on Sunday, over
taking Washington's Dea Sumantri and her
home-court advantage in three sets, 6-3.2-6.
6-2.
Burdette, the fourth seed in the tourna
ment, faced an intense showdown at Lloyd
Nordstrom Tennis Center. No. 13 Sumantri
(13-4) was seeded third, and like Burdette
had clinched her first three matches in
straight sets.
With Burdette primed from her earlier
doubles victory and serving to go up 3-0,
what started as a seemingly simple win un
folded into a three-hour battle.

of a fight, Sumantri tightened up her
strokes and broke Burdette's serve
twice to stifle her in the second set.
In the final set, Burdette used
her 5'11" stature to her advantage,
covering the court exceptionally
well and firing baseline winner after
winner.
Dual singles and doubles victo
ries in Seattle are a rare feat, and
Burdette becomes the first player
since California's Amanda Augus
tus in 1998 to win so handily.
Going into the match, Stanford
assistant coach Frankie Brennan
hinted at the golden opportunity
awaiting the Atlanta. Ga., native.
"Erin has a pretty powerful
game, and that's what the Indoor
tournament is suited for," Brennan
said.
Turning to Freeman Memorial
action in Las Vegas, this year's re
sults ring true to those in 2(K)4. Free
man. which draws players from
noteworthy schools such as Florida
and Duke, presents an exciting and
novel challenge for many freshman
players.
Freshman Lejla Hodzic suffered
her first college tennis loss on Sun
day, dropping the final to Georgia's
No. lOShadisha Robinson, 6-3,6-4.
In semifinal action. Hodzic made

quick work of teammate and de
fending champion No. 35 Theresa
Logar, 6-2,6-4.
"I've never played a teammate
before, and Lejla played very, very
well in the course of the tourna
ment," Logar said. "When we went
out there, I had played [UCLA's
Daniela Bercek] for three-and-a
half hours and was pretty worn out.
She was able to capitalize on the fact
that I wasn't on top of my game."
Despite her loss in the final,
Hodzic maintained a powerful 11-1
record and a straight-set victory in
the quarterfinals over Cal's No. 3
Suzi Babos, 6-3,6-4.
"|ln our match) she built the
points very well and is becoming a
very strong player," Logar said
about her teammate.
In doubles. No. 41 Hodzic and
partner Whitney Deason (7-1), a
freshman, were defeated 8-4 by
UCLA's No. 5 Bercek and Riza Za
lameda.
Hodzic and Deason appeared
strong in the semifinals against
Florida's No. 3 Whitney Benik and
Lolita Frangulyan, posting an 8-5
win to put a dent in the freshman
Gators' 18-3 record.
Meanwhile, the No. 7 tandem of
Barnes and Burdette clinched their

second doubles title in three tourna
ment showings.
Other Cardinal players making
headlines after this weekend in
clude Joanna Kao, a junior, and
Anne Yelsey, a sophomore. Kao (6-
2) competed in the second singles
tier at Freeman, losing in the final to
Jessica Leitch of Arizona State, 6-0,
6-3.
Yelsey enjoyed similar results in
Pac-10's second flight of players, fin
ishing behind Oregon's Davina
Mendiburu after a 6-2,6-2 loss.
With so many Cardinal players
bringing their best game to the
courts, choosing the lineup for up
coming team matches is the next big
challenge. Amber Liu. a junior,
Barnes and Burdette are slated at
singles Nos. 1-3, but only time will
tell about the remaining three spots.
"It's going to be a pretty open
battle," Brennan said. "If you were
going to put it on paper, you would
say Theresa would probably be at
No. 4, Whitney would be No. 5, and
Anne would be No. 6. At the same
time, anything could happen."
The Cardinal host their first
games of the season next Thursday

strokes and broke Burdette's serve

In the final set, Burdette used
her 5'11" stature to her advantage,
covering the court exceptionally

Burdette becomes the first player
since California's Amanda Augus

Going into the match, Stanford
assistant coach Frankie Brennan
hinted at the golden opportunity
awaiting the Atlanta. Ga., native.
"Erin has a pretty powerful

Turning to Freeman Memorial
action in Las Vegas, this year's re
sults ring true to those in 2(K)4. Free

players.
Freshman Lejla Hodzic suffered
her first college tennis loss on Sun
day, dropping the final to Georgia's
No. lOShadisha Robinson, 6-3,6-4.
In semifinal action. Hodzic made

quick work of teammate and de
fending champion No. 35 Theresa
Logar, 6-2,6-4.
"I've never played a teammate
before, and Lejla played very, very
well in the course of the tourna
ment," Logar said. "When we went
out there, I had played [UCLA's
Daniela Bercek] for three-and-a
half hours and was pretty worn out.
She was able to capitalize on the fact
that I wasn't on top of my game."
Despite her loss in the final,
Hodzic maintained a powerful 11-1
record and a straight-set victory in
the quarterfinals over Cal's No. 3
Suzi Babos, 6-3,6-4.
"|ln our match) she built the
points very well and is becoming a
very strong player," Logar said
about her teammate.

partner Whitney Deason (7-1), a
freshman, were defeated 8-4 by

Jessica Leitch of Arizona State, 6-0,
6-3.
Yelsey enjoyed similar results in
Pac-10's second flight of players, fin
ishing behind Oregon's Davina
Mendiburu after a 6-2,6-2 loss.
With so many Cardinal players
bringing their best game to the
courts, choosing the lineup for up
coming team matches is the next big
challenge. Amber Liu. a junior,
Barnes and Burdette are slated at
singles Nos. 1-3, but only time will
tell about the remaining three spots.
"It's going to be a pretty open
battle," Brennan said. "If you were
going to put it on paper, you would
say Theresa would probably be at
No. 4, Whitney would be No. 5, and
Anne would be No. 6. At the same
time, anything could happen."
The Cardinal host their first
games of the season next Thursday
and Friday, against Davis and Cal

Teammates square off
in Freeman semifinal
From the expected chaos of sending eight
players to the Pacific-10 Conference Indoor
Championship and Freeman Memorial
tournaments this weekend, the No. 1 Stan
ford women's tennis team (1-0) emerged
tired, sore, and ecstatic about its singles and
doubles earnings in both events.
This weekend's results added two more
titles to the Cardinal's stunning record,
which now includes 13 NCAA and 17 Pac-10
league honors.
Those are two more reminders for the
