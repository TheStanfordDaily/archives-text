# Dual wins in singles, doubles for Burdette
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
From the expected chaos of sending eight
players to the Pacific-10 Conference Indoor
Championship and Freeman Memorial
tournaments this weekend, the No. 1 Stan
ford women's tennis team (1-0) emerged
tired, sore, and ecstatic about its singles and
doubles earnings in both events.
This weekend's results added two more
titles to the Cardinal's stunning record,
which now includes 13 NCAA and 17 Pac-10
league honors.
Those are two more reminders for the
rest of the tennis nation that Stanford's aim
to repeat its 2004 fairytale season is very real
indeed.
Last April's unexpected pairing of junior
Alice Barnes and senior Erin Burdette at
the Pac-10 Individual Championship has de
veloped into a thoughtful and effective tan
dem. one which turns long-shot victories
into a long-standing routine. The top-seed
ed duo survived tight 8-6 wins in the semifi

nals and finals, depriving Oregon's Domini
ka Dieskova and Daria Panova of the dou
bles title.
For No. 22 Burdette (9-2), whose perfor
mance at Pac-10 in Seattle garnered her first
singles title since 2001, the promising results
of this weekend hold special worth.
Backed by three straight-set wins, Bur
dette powered to the finish on Sunday, over
taking Washington's Dea Sumantri and her
home-court advantage in three sets, 6-3.2-6.
6-2.
Burdette, the fourth seed in the tourna
ment, faced an intense showdown at Lloyd
Nordstrom Tennis Center. No. 13 Sumantri
(13-4) was seeded third, and like Burdette
had clinched her first three matches in
straight sets.
With Burdette primed from her earlier
doubles victory and serving to go up 3-0,
what started as a seemingly simple win un
folded into a three-hour battle.
