# Outside hitter woes hit Card
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tonight, the men's volleyball team is
on the road, taking on the team that
knocked it out of a Santa Barbara Tourna
ment bronze medal eleven days ago. But
looking to get back at Long Beach State

(3-2.1-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion ) isn't consuming the minds of the Car
dinal: Improvement and injuries are.
And despite the fact that the No. 8
Cardinal (2-3, 1-1 MPSF) were swept by
Long Beach in their first meeting of the
season, the team remains optimistic
about this evening's match.

"We just need to play well," head
coach Don' Shaw said. "We played fairly
well in that [Santa Barbara] match; we
did a good job blocking and hitting. Now
that we know what to expect from them,
we're even better prepared."
However, the team is still plagued by
injuries. A back injury has kept sopho

more Josh Schwarzapel out and junior
Nick Manov's sore shoulder continues to
sideline him. The list of injuries grows with
the recent addition of junior Ben Reddy.
"Reddy hurt his knee in warm-ups be
fore the Pepperdine match and contin
ued to play and felt okay, but it got
swollen and sore over the weekend,"
Shaw said.
The loss of Reddy could play a signif
icant role tonight. He led the team in kills
in both matches this past weekend, with
13 kills against Southern California and
17 against Pepperdine.
Since Manov, Schwarzapel and
Reddy are all outside hitters, the team is
now left with senior David Vogel and
redshirt junior William Clayton as the
only experienced healthy players at that
position.
Other outside hitters are freshmen
Jesse Meredith, Brian Skinner and Matt
Wahl. Of these three, only Meredith
plays outside hitter as his primary posi
tion — Skinner and Wahl are middle
blockers. And while Skinner played in
the tournament match against Long
Beach State, Meredith and Wahl have
not seen playing time yet this season.
"We don't know what we're going to
do, but right now, we're not going to worry
about that," Shaw said. "Our outside hit
ters definitely need to play better, espe
cially better than they did against Pepper
dine, although the Long Beach block is not
quite as intimidating as Pepperdine's."
The Cardinal will have to put their re
cent loss to Pepperdine behind them and
try to come out strong against Long
Beach, a team with its share of star power.
"The setter for Long Beach, Tyler
Hildebrand, is a great player, a First-
Team Ail-American last year," Shaw
said. "But [Stanford senior Kevin]
Hansen is also a great player. They're
two of the best setters in the country."
Hillenbrand and the 49ers come into
the 7:30 p.m. start with a 3-1 win against
UC-Santa Barbara.
With three men out with injuries,
Stanford will have to be on top of its
game to beat a higher-ranked team that
has already beaten it once this season.
"The hard part about playing in this
conference is that you don't get any easy
matches," Shaw said.
