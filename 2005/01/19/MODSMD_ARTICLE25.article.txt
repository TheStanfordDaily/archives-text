## Leinart's call is sweet, but going pro takes guts 
### 
Before we all start to melt into puddles of
sentimental goo over Matt Leinart's decision
to remain at USC for his senior season, let's
evaluate the pros and cons. He went with his
heart instead of his wallet (I'm contractually
obligated to use that expression), but that's
not necessarily a good thing.

On its face, Leinart's
choice seems wonderful, and,
predictably, most journalists
are salivating over him as the
second coming of Christ in
terms of moral superiority.
Granted, the epidemic of ath
letes turning pro early has
taken a severe toll on inter
collegiate sports — particu
larly basketball — but this is

a far cry from Maurice Clarett's "I'm going to
forego any semblance of an education because
I know everything at age 18" decision. Still, by
staying a Trojan for another year, Leinart is
essentially wagering his NFL future against a
chance to be one of the greatest college ath
letes of all time.
Across the field from him in the Orange
Bowl was a guy who might have advised him
differently. Jason White of Oklahoma won
the Heisman in 2004 and then returned to the
Sooners for his senior year.
White's professional stock may have
dropped slightly after this season, in which he
threw for fewer yards and touchdowns. He'll
still earn enough after the draft to drive his
Bugatti through swimming pools full of belu
ga caviar for the rest of his days, but the possi
bility of injury over the course of this season
had to have been at least a minor concern. Not
only that. White had a greater incentive to
stay, because he didn't win a national champi
onship at the end of his junior year, while
Leinart did.
Of course, White had to return to Norman.
Okla., which in itself was a heroic feat of tol
erance. Leinart will be spending the next year
in the mini gated community that is USC, a
university inundated by enough attractive
women to turn Elton John straight. It's diffi
cult to imagine an existence with more upside
than Leinart's. Had he gone pro it's entirely
possible that he would have been drafted by
