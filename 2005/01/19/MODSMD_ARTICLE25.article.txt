## Leinart's call is sweet, but going pro takes guts 
### 
Before we all start to melt into puddles of
sentimental goo over Matt Leinart's decision
to remain at USC for his senior season, let's
evaluate the pros and cons. He went with his
heart instead of his wallet (I'm contractually
obligated to use that expression), but that's
not necessarily a good thing.

On its face, Leinart's
choice seems wonderful, and,
predictably, most journalists
are salivating over him as the
second coming of Christ in
terms of moral superiority.
Granted, the epidemic of ath
letes turning pro early has
taken a severe toll on inter
collegiate sports — particu
larly basketball — but this is

a far cry from Maurice Clarett's "I'm going to
forego any semblance of an education because
I know everything at age 18" decision. Still, by
staying a Trojan for another year, Leinart is
essentially wagering his NFL future against a
chance to be one of the greatest college ath
letes of all time.
Across the field from him in the Orange
Bowl was a guy who might have advised him
differently. Jason White of Oklahoma won
the Heisman in 2004 and then returned to the
Sooners for his senior year.
White's professional stock may have
dropped slightly after this season, in which he
threw for fewer yards and touchdowns. He'll
still earn enough after the draft to drive his
Bugatti through swimming pools full of belu
ga caviar for the rest of his days, but the possi
bility of injury over the course of this season
had to have been at least a minor concern. Not
only that. White had a greater incentive to
stay, because he didn't win a national champi
onship at the end of his junior year, while
Leinart did.
Of course, White had to return to Norman.
Okla., which in itself was a heroic feat of tol
erance. Leinart will be spending the next year
in the mini gated community that is USC, a
university inundated by enough attractive
women to turn Elton John straight. It's diffi
cult to imagine an existence with more upside
than Leinart's. Had he gone pro it's entirely
possible that he would have been drafted by


Dan McCarthy
the 49ers, an organization in such
disarray right now that Sri Lanka is
sending them disaster relief funds.
So there were compelling reasons
for Leinart to stay put. But on the
other side of the coin, Leinart could
have easily constructed a Scrooge
McDuck storehouse of gold dou
bloons and built an adjoining man
sion with all the money an NFL fran-,
chise would have given him.
Let's say he tears every ligament
in his knee this year in a freak acci
dent and never plays football again.
I sincerely doubt that the $950 a
month he's receiving as part of
USC's stipend is going into his re
tirement fund.
Also, Leinart's major is sociolo
gy. This means that if he gets hurt,
you could take the amount of money
he'd make with football, subtract the
money he'd make without football
and then stretch the remaining dol
lar bills end-to-end until they

reached the surface of the sun.
There is, however, the considerable
allure he would garner as a steer
masturbator, fry cook, junior high
school janitor, low-rent gigolo, or
whatever the hell else sociology ma
jors do.
In this particular situation. 1 think
it actually takes more guts to take
the money and run. Other athletes
don't necessarily have the over
whelming media pressure that
Leinart faced. It's easy for Joe Tail
back to ensure his future family's fi
nancial security without having Jay
Mariotti and Woody Paige bray at
each other about his personal value
system on any of the I-can-yell-loud
er-than-you shows that ESPN runs
in the afternoon.
It really makes me feel terrible
when I watch this, not only because I
realize that I share the same profes
sion with Mariotti, but because 1 re
alize the public stoning Leinart

would have received had he gone
pro.
The feel-good decision here
isn't necessarily the right one. It's
Leinart's call, but maybe we should
be more careful before praising
him for what is, in effect, rolling the
dice. When Leinart said that anoth
er year in college would "make me
happier than any amount of money
could make someone happy,"
doesn't that resonate as just a little
aw-shucks idealistic? We should all
be lucky enough to face Leinart's
decision, but most of us are lying if
we say he's acting responsibly or
magnanimously.
It's a tough call, and I hope he does
well, but if I were in his position?
Show me the monev.

At least Leinart won't
have to play for SF
