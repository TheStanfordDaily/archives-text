## 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its first outing of the new year, the No. 6
Stanford women's swimming team looked poised
and powerful, sweeping all hut one race in a com
manding non-conference victory over an un
ranked Pacific squad. With a final score of 159-
96, the Cardinal was on cruise control throughout
the meet.
Stanford's 13 race wins were spread among

STANFORD 159,
PACIFIC 96

eight swimmers, with
four multiple win
ners. Junior Laura
Davis led the way
with wins in the 200-

yard butterfly and 400-yard individual medley.
She also posted the fastest time in the 200-yard
hreaststroke, but because she swam it as an exhi
bition, the score did not count toward the team
total.
Freshmen Brooke Bishop and Elizabeth
Durot were dominant in their events, each
adding two wins on the day. Durot took the top
spot in both the 200- and 500-yard freestyle races,
while Bishop won the 100-yard freestyle and 100-
yard backstroke. Also checking in with two vic-

Tories was senior Lacey Boutwell, who won the
50-yard freestyle and 2()0-yard backstroke.
Two more freshmen, Caroline Bruce and
Katherine Bell, finished first in the 100-yard and
200-yard hreaststroke, respectively, to continue
what is fast becoming a tradition of excellence for
the newest additions to this team.
Rounding out individual victories for the Car
dinal were junior Dana Kirk in the 100-yard but
terfly and sophomore Desiree Stahley in the
thousand-yard freestyle.
The 200-yard medley relay team of senior
Amy Wagner, freshman Erica Liu, Kirk and
Boutwell finished comfortably ahead of Pacific's
top team. The Tigers performed better in the 200-
yard freestyle relay, where they saw their only
race win on the day, but only because the Stan
ford teams swam the race as an exhibition. The
Cardinal squad of Boutwell, Bishop, Bruce and
senior Sarah Jones touched the wall more than a
second ahead of Pacific's A team.
Stanford attributes its early success to the
combination of a deep and talented squad and
excellent team chemistry. As the Pacific-10 Con
ference and NCAA championships approach,
this could help the Cardinal to a strong finish.
"I think we have an amazing team this year,"

Davis said. "We're working better together than
any of the other years I've been here, and it's
been way more fun."'
Almost overshadowed by the dominant Stan
ford performances was Pacific's success; the
Tigers stayed close to the top in several races.
The squad collected second-place finishes in
seven races and was led by freshman Ja-Neil
Bragg in the 500-yard freestyle and the 400-yard
individual medley.
Not all of the standings reflect what happened
in the pool, however, since several races featured
faster times from Stanford athletes swimming
exhibitions.
The Cardinal times were good enough to win,
but not as fast as times earlier this season. No
swimmers achieved the NCAA "A" qualifying
standard times, though the "B" standard was
reached eight times. Davis, Durot, Bruce and
Kirk recorded "B" times in their six combined
wins. Bishop added one in the 100-yard back
stroke, and Liu reached the standard when she
finished second to Bruce in the 100-yard breast
stroke.

Among Stanford's multiple race winners was junior Laura Davis. Davis took the
200-yard butterfly and the 400-yard individual medley.
The team is still very positive about
its performance and what it means as
Pac-10 competition begins.
"I think 11he meet] showed that
we're in a pretty good position," said
sophomore Morgan Hentzen. whose ex
hibition time in the 500-yard freestyle
would have put her in second place.
"Everyone was pretty tired because we
had a tough week before, but I think it's
a good sign for the rest of the season."
While the Stanford swimmers should
be proud of their resounding victory
over the Tigers, they will face much
stiffer competition for the rest of the
season, beginning with a road trip to the
Arizona schools next weekend.
Against the tougher opponents
ahead, the Cardinal hope to continue im
proving. Now that the bulk of training is
over, the swimmers will shift focus from
conditioning to pure speed training.
"We had amazing Christmas train
ing, and we're all looking great," Davis
said. "We've done all of our training,
that's all behind us. We'll probably get
faster through the season because we're
doing more speed work."
Hentzen agreed: "We're working
hard, and everything's going good for
the end of the season. I think we're
doing really well."
