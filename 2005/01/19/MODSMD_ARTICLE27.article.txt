# UCLA shuts down Stanford in singles play
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Maybe the Bruins were more comfortable be
cause they were playing closer to home. Perhaps
rainy weather hadn't interfered with their post
break practices. Or maybe UCLA was just having a
better weekend for tennis. Whatever the reason, the
Bruins proved to be an obstacle for the Stanford
men's tennis team in the Sherwood Cup.
In addition to No. 7 Stanford and No. 2 UCLA,
top-ranked Baylor and No. 8 Southern California
were among the participants in the season's first
tournament, held at Thousand Oaks, Calif. The
Bears and Trojans were both slightly troublesome
for the Stanford men, but it was the Bruins who
handed the Cardinal four of their six first-round sin
gles losses.
Like last year, the Cardinal collected six first
round losses; However, Stanford's winning percent
age was better this year because senior Sam War
burg and junior Jon Wong tallied first-round wins.
" The results don't speak very well for us," War
burg said. "But for people who could see the draw,
our first matches were extremely difficult; [our team
was] playing the No. 1 and 2 guys from every school.
I think we ran into the tough players early in the
draw."
While their teammates struggled against UCLA.
Warburg and Wong both defeated Bruins in the first
round: Warburg, the tournament's top-seed, made
quick work of Jaysen Chung 6-1, 6-2. and Wong
ousted Jason Nguyen 7-6, 6-2.
Sophomores Eric McKean and James Wan.
freshman Phil Kao and senior Phil Sheng weren't as
lucky. UCLA's Luben Pampoulov and Benjamin
Kohlloeffel defeated McKean and Wan 6-4,7-6 and
6-3,6-0, in respective singles matches. Fellow Bruin,
Mathieu Dehaine, prevailed against Sheng, 6-3,6-4.
and Kao was deprived of a first-round victory by
UCLA's Philipp Gruendler 6-4.6-4.
San Diego State's Christian Groh came out on
top against freshman Lee Chang in Chang's first
Stanford match, and Baylor's Michal Kokta defeat
ed sophomore David Ryan in another Stanford
debut.
In second-round play, Wong made a straight-set
exit to USC's Johan Berg, a lefty with a big serve.
"He's a senior and has a lot more college experi
ence," Wong said. "I had a lot of trouble returning
serves, but the main [disparity was) experience."

Besides Wong, the only other Stanford player
still in the main draw for singles was Warburg. With
a win over Baylor's Greg Shearer, the senior cap
tain advanced to the quarterfinals, where he met
Gruendler.
In 2004. Warburg faced Gruendler in the first
round of the Sherwood Cup and suffered a three-set
loss. Although Warburg had a chance to serve out
the first set this time, the Bruin persisted and elimi
nated the tournament's top seed in two sets, beating
Warburg 7-5,6-3.
"I like to dictate the points and play aggressive
ly," Warburg said. "[Gruendler] doesn't give me any
pace to work with, and I just match up extremely
bad with him. He had an answer for everything I
tried."
Stanford advanced three of four pairs to the
quarterfinals and nabbed two victories over USC
and one over UCLA in the first round of doubles
action.
Teaming up were the only two Cardinal men to
post first-round singles victories: Warburg and
Wong posted wins in the initial two rounds of dou
bles. Despite never having played together before
(Warburg's usual partner, junior KC Corkery, did
not play due to injury), the Stanford duo cruised
through USC's Aaron Badart and Whit Liv
ingston 8-2 and then bested UCLA's Chris Lam
and Dehaine.
"Our communication was good," Wong said.
"We talked between points a lot and were on the
same page, but it's kind of hard when you haven't
played with [your partner] before."
Head coach John Whitlinger also commented on
the success of the new team. ,
"They did a great job in doubles fora team that
was put together at the last second," he said. "Jon
has done well in doubles and is one of those guys
that really will give it his all anywhere you put him."
After a close 8-6 win over USC in the first-round
of doubles, Kao and Wan were defeated in the next
round by Baylor's Kokta and Lars Poerschke, 8-4.
McKean and Sheng also marked a win followed
by a loss: They were narrowly defeated 9-8 by the
San Diego State / Baylor tandem of Markus Dick
hardt and Greg Shearer in the quarterfinals.
The mixed-school pairing of Dickhardt and
Shearer then defeated Warburg and Wong 8-4 in the
semifinals.
Despite the pair's loss. Warburg was pleased
with the chance to test out a different partner.

"1 play with KC all the time and we know each
other so well. Sometimes it's fun to play with anoth
er teammate," the senior said.
In the consolation singles draw, doubles partners
Kao and Wan both advanced to the finals fora Stan
ford showdown. Wan displayed his experience with
a straight-set win over Kao, giving up only one
game.
Whitlinger was pleased with Kao and Wan's ef
forts in the consolation draw.
"That always shows me a lot when you can lose a
first round match and then still win matches," he
said.
By weekend's end, the Cardinal realized it's
early in the season and the team still has time to gain
experience and confidence.
"Result-wise, it wasn't a great tournament for
us," Whitlinger said. "But it's the first tournament of
the year. We're building, getting better. The impor
tant thing was playing matches, and now our focus is
on January 29 when we play Berkeley."
