# Two Stanford seniors win Mitchell Scholarships
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A Stanford senior and a recent graduate will
head to Ireland next year fora year of post-grad
uate study. Senior Mike Solomon and Alex
Greninger, Class of 2004. were recipients of the
George J. Mitchell Scholarship, an annual award
given to approximately 12 college students
around the country who have distinguished
themselves both in and out of the classroom.
The scholarship, sponsored by the non-profit
U.S.-Ireland Alliance and named fora former
U.S. Senator involved in the Northern Ireland
peace process, covers both tuition and housing
and provides students with stipends for travel
and living expenses.
Solomon, who is majoring in both music and
public policy, plans to study musical composition
at the Queen's University in Belfast. Throughout
his Stanford career, Solomon, a composer since
the age of 11, has developed and explored his
craft, having been involved with the a cappella
group Fleet Street and the Ram's Head Theatri
cal Society.
Greninger, a double major in international re
lations and biological sciences, is no stranger to
academic success. He has previously been award
ed for his academic accomplishments, having
won a Firestone Medal for Excellence in Under
graduate Education for one of three honors the
ses he wrote. (He was unavailable for comment
at press time for this article, but a profile featur
ing him will run later this week.)
Greninger is currently in England, studying

epidemiology at Cambridge University on a
Churchill Scholarship, and next year plans to
study management science at the University Col
lege Dublin's Michael Smurfit School of Busi
ness.
"As a composer. I've found that the greatest
opportunities to write come outside the class
room/' Solomon said. "I'd say that Gaieties,
Fleet Street, Pinkertons [an opera), and my band
2ME9 are the four accomplishments I'm proud
est of. The musical world of all four activities is so
different that 'musicking' never gets old. which is
important, as my composition skills start to atro
phy if I don't have diverse and talented ensem
bles to write for."
In the future, Solomon said he hopes to take
his musical skills to a higher, professional level.
"My advisor tells his students that composi
tion is a 24 / 7 process, where your life experi
ences are fair game for material," he said. "I to
tally agree with this statement, and feel that a
change of scenery will aid my craft more than
pursuing grad school in the United States."
"I also look forward to composing on a more
intimate scale. Ireland tends to breed great
chamber composers, and most of my opportuni
ties here have been for larger ensembles."
Solomon cited his many on-campus musical
commitments as his fondest memories.
"Three that stick out are conducting Gaieties
on a Friday night, conducting the Stanford Hymn
at Fleet Street Spring Show, and playing an all
80s cover party @ 680," he said. "All of those gigs
had really fun rehearsal processes, great crowds,
and solid musical performances."
