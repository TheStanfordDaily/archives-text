# Cold weather on campus causes complications; catwalk closes
## 
### JESSICA FLORES 
At the beginning of each winter quarter, students
prepare to go on their dorm ski trips by digging up
fleeces, gloves, hats and even long johns in order to
brave the cold weather in Tahoe. But last week, even
those not heading north to the slopes had to rely on
such gear just to get to and from classes.
The unusually cold weather posed safety issues,
threatened the health of plants, and reduced partici
pation in outdoor activities.
Last week, the temperature reached a low of 36 de
grees, only 10 degrees higher than the record low of 26
degrees in 1963 and four degrees lower than the usual
low of roughly 40 degrees for this time of the year.
Last Thursday. Palonia RA Erik Goosens sent out
an e-mail to Florence Moore residents to beware of
the thin icy residue on the catwalk wood. The message
was written in response to the rising concerns over the
safety of the catwalk, making it appropriate to remind
students to take caution while walking between the

third floors of Flo Mo's dorms on the popular outdoor
wooden walkway.
More than just a convenient means of entering dif
ferent dorm buildings, the catwalk is often used as a
gathering place for Flo Mo residents. But on Thurs
day. according to Goosens, patches of ice were left on
the catwalk, making it potentially dangerous for stu
dents to do their regular catwalk socializing.
Freshman Mark Booney said that he and several
others stayed off the catwalk on Thursday because of
the unusual frost. Goosens reported that there was no
real need to close it off completely to students, though,
and no one slipped or suffered any injuries. The mere
warning and the icy weather, however, caused many to
stay inside that night.
The rain and cold also may have kept people away
from the outside campus tours. According to Jennifer
Bland. Stanford's visitor information coordinator,
fewer visitors requested campus tours. She added that
since it is early in the quarter, her office is not offering
all of its tours, like the golf tours or residential tours.

"Numbers were relatively low, but it's hard to say
it's abnormal for this time of year," Blanch said, not
ing that campus tours will resume operating fully this
week.
An additional weather-related concern regarded
its effects on campus gardens and plants. Synergy gar
dener Beth McGregor, a senior, noted that a few of the
herbs were wilting. The broccoli, lettuce and spinach,
however, were doing just fine in the rain.
"They actually quite like it," McGregor said, insist
ing that the cold does not hurt all plants. Each year.
Synergy plans ahead for the winter weather of January
and rotates out the summer and fall plants.
This week's weather is projected to be warmer than
that of last week, but a sunny Stanford may still be
weeks away. As students take a little extra caution dri
ving in the rain, defrosting their windows and layering
up. they remember that in comparison to some East
Coast schools, they really have nothing to complain
about.
