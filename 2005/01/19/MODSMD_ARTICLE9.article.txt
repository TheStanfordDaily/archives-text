Natoli explained to the Senate
that public investment disclosure
has, in the past, hurt institutions in
their returns on investments. He told
the Senate that the Ivy League aver
age for returns is IS percent (with
Harvard leading the way at 20 per
cent), hut that Stanford's returns last
year were only 16 percent.
"This particular proposal and
public investment disclosure in gen
eral will hurt Stanford in the long
run," Natoli said. "And it could pre
vent the University from getting the
maximum return on investment."
The Senate will draft a bill in sup
port of investment disclosure and
vote on it at next week's meeting.
After discussing investment dis
closure, the Senate voted on a bill
that would change a Constitutional
bylaw regarding the election process
for the SSE chief executive officer /
ASSU financial manager position
when the incumbent reapplies fora
second term.
Colby McGavin, who graduated
from Stanford in 2(XX) and is the cur

rent chair of the board of SSE, spoke
to the Senate in support of the pro
posed bylaw.
McGavin explained that the
change would eliminate conflicts of
interest and biases in the selection
process if the incumbent SSE chief
executive officer / ASSU financial
manager reapplies.
"The bylaw was created in an ef
fort to deal with second year appli
cants," said McGavin. who was the
SSE chief executive officer / ASSU
financial manager during the 2(XX)-
2(K) 1 academic year.
Citing ambiguity in the wording
of the bill and unfairness to appli
cants other than the incumbent offi
cer, senators voted against the pro
posed bill 3-10-2.
McGavin said he was disappoint
ed in the outcome.
"I think we could have put a little
more time into the bill to get it
passed," she said. "We probably
tried to pass it too quickly and conse
quently didn't give people enough
time to think about the alternatives."
