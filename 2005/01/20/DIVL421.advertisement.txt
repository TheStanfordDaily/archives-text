Democracy Afghan Style
This feature-length documentary is about nation building efforts in Afghanistan. The film tells
the larger story of a not-quite-ready-for-prime-time nation trying to create peace, stability, and
possibly democracy amidst the chaos of tribalism, a destroyed political culture, and the U.S.
war on terrorism.
