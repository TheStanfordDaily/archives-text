Are heroes born?
Or are they made?
Inside every child is a hidden strength,
an unknown ability, a hero waiting to be
discovered. In afterschool programs, kids get involved in al
kinds of activities - scholastic, athletic and creative. Activities
that help them realize they have the potential to do better
and reach further than they ever imagined. Because in the
end, that's what makes a hero. Let us know you want
afterschool programs in your area. Call 1-800-USA-LEARN.
