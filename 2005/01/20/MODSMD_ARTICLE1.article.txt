# UPSTART CARD HEAD SOUTH
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Coaches will tell you that basketball is a game
of streaks. The key, they say, is building your
own and limiting the other teams'.
The Cardinal began last season with a 25-
game winning streak, but this year's team has

had more of a seesaw bat
tle. Stanford suffered a
three-game losing streak
early in the year,
bounced back with four
straight wins over lesser
opponents, was left for
dead after three straight
Pacific-10 Conference
losses, but has sprung
back to life with wins
over rivals Arizona and
California.
But for all those
streaks, the Cardinal (8-
7, 2-3 Pac-10) are about
right back where they
started, record-wise. The
team will try continue its
current streak — and
balance its Pac-10 books
— when it faces UCLA
today.
Stanford has won the
last seven games at
Pauley Pavilion and four
in a row overall in the se
ries, but Ben Howland's

Bruins (10-4, 4-2 Pac-10) are much improved
from last year's 11-17 squad.
They enter the game having won four of their
last five. UCLA's lone loss during that streak was
a heartbreaking one. 76-73 to No. 13 Arizona in
Tucson last Saturday. Arizona guard Salim
Stoudamire hit the winning three-pointer with
2.5 seconds remaining in the game and scored 24
of his team's last 29 points. UCLA senior for
ward Dijon Thompson led his team with 27
points.
Head coach Trent Johnson said that he hasn't
observed a change in his team's confidence level,
but he does think the Cardinal are improving.
"We have cut down on our turnovers," John
son said. "We are still getting out-rebounded,
but we have been shooting at a better percentage

than our opponents."
The team has also been able to get to the free
throw line more often of late, an indication that
it is playing more aggressively.
Stanford will try to hold its own on the boards
against UCLA, which averages almost six more
rebounds per game than its opponents. Johnson
said that his team will have to make a collective
commitment to rebounding, instead of relying
on junior forward Matt Haryasz and senior cen
ter Rob Little to get the job done.
It will also be crucial for Haryasz — who
played only 11 minutes against Cal after collect
ing four personal fouls — to stay in the game.
The Bruins are strong inside, with two 7-foot
centers —Michael Fey and Ryan Hollins
along with Thompson, second in the Pac-10 with
18.4 points and 8.8 rebounds per game.
"Dijon Thompson is a pro," Johnson said,
adding that his versatility essentially gives the
Bruins four guards in their starting lineup. "I'm
sure that when Haryasz is guarding him. they will
try to bring him out to the perimeter. He can
score off the dribble and in the post."
Stanford will also have to contend with
UCLA's three promising freshmen — point
guard Jordan Farmar, off guard Arron Afflalo
and small forward Josh Shipp, all of whom start.
Though the trio may be inexperienced in Pac-10
play, Johnson said that they play older than they
are.
"I think experience is overrated," Johnson
said. "Kids are playing so much basketball now,
60, 70 games in a summer. It really becomes a
matter of how comfortable they are with the sys
tem." He added, "They are for real."
Not many people would dispute that state
ment. Farmar, a McDonald's Ail-American, is
second on the team in scoring with 13.8 points
per game and third in the Pac-10 with five assists
per contest. The group accounts for 43 percent
of the Bruins' scoring, and the Cardinal may go
to junior Jason Haas at the point, moving junior
Chris Hernandez to the two-guard position, to
counter their athleticism. Haas has stepped up
in Stanford's last three Pac-10 games, leading
the team with 16 assists and posting a four-to
one turnover ratio in those games.
Stanford will try to limit UCLA's up-tempo
style of play and force the Bruins into a half
court game.
"We don't want to get into a track meet,"
Johnson said, adding that if his team doesn't re

bound and play good transition defense, "it
could get ugly."
The Cardinal will take on struggling USC (9-
9, 1-5 Pac-10) on Saturday. The Trojans won
their first Pac-10 game, 98-94 over Arizona State,
last Saturday after dropping their first five deci
sions in league play.
Emerging freshman Nick Young — USC's
third-leading scorer and part of a core of talent
ed young players — led the team with 22 points
against Arizona State. Sophomore Lodrick
Stewart, the Trojans' leading scorer, added 19.
Freshman Gabriel Pruitt averages 10.8 points
per game and leads the team with 3.7 assists.
The Trojans have been a model of instability
this season, having already undergone three
coaching changes. Former head coach Henry
Bibby was replaced by Jim Saia on an interim
basis five games into the season. Rick Majerus
signed on to coach for next season last month,
but quit five days later. Last Friday, USC intro
duced Tim Floyd as Majerus' replacement. Saia
will finish out this season, with Floyd taking the
reins in April.
