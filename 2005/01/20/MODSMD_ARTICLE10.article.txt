# Getting naked for a good cause

### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Summertime in Maine, with the lobster fish
ers working the bays and inlets, can evoke a lot
of pastoral images in the traveler. For freshman
Andrew Burmon. most of those images involve
nudity.
It was the Maine lobster fishermen, after all,
that gave him the idea fora pinup calendar fea
turing 14 naked Larkin first-years.
"Every year the lobstermen make these fake
calendars of themselves all posing naked on their
lobster boats," said Burmon, a shaggy-haired
frosh from Weston, Mass. and sometime writer
for The Daily. "They can't make enough money,
ever, on lobster fishing, so they have to do some
thing. Also, they have way too much time on
their hands. They spend most of it drinking.
When they drink I suppose this is the result."
When an earthquake sent tsunamis crashing
across the Indian Ocean shoreline Dec. 26. killing
tens of thousands, Burmon and fellow Larkinites
Pam Geist and Joel Lewenstein. a Daily photog
rapher, had the idea of emulating the lobstermen
to raise money for the affected areas.
It took them two weeks to shoot and produce
the 12-month calendar, pach month featuring a
different Larkin coed (or two) baring almost
everything for the penetrating camera lens of
Burmon and Lewenstein. The black-and-white
calendar — produced by the on-campus FedEx I
Kinko's at cost because of its charitable aims —
starts selling next week for $10. half of which will
go to Save the Children by way of the umbrella
group Stanford Students for Relief.
They have already received orders for 70 cal
endars. and advertising efforts will continue with
a table in White Plaza next week and visits to
dorm meetings by semi-clad Larkinites.
The pictures, which never show the, ahem,
most personal parts, are meant to tease more
than arouse.
"Suggestive nudity," Lewenstein said as an

appropriate term for the style of
photography.
The theme, "A Day in the Life of
a Larkin Student," mixes naked
coeds with everyday scenarios and
settings in ways once imagined only
by pornographers and frat hoys.

all backdrops.
"We came up with a list of activ
ities that are everyday and how we
can make them slightly sexual,"
Geist said.
Dylan Keil, also known as Mr.
May, is reading a copy of The Daily
in Stern Dining, a tray over his lap
with apples and a banana sugges
tively situated on top. (The picture

was taken moments before dinner
started, Geist said, but Keil was un
fazed by the passersby.)
Miss February is Cori Marquis,
who donned librarian's glasses and
nothing else in the Stacks. The Time
Magazine featuring President

covers her pelvis.
Geist, who is Miss April, got wet
in the Stern showers for the sake of
the tsunami victims.
"Showering is always an every
day activity, so I think, 'Why not?'"
she said. "It wasn't so special the
next time around when there were
no lights and no cameras."
Lewenstein and Burmon
stripped down to become Messrs.

Calendar looks to evoke
laughter during sad time

August in what is perhaps the calen
dar's most risque photo. The duo,
who did most of the photography,
pose on a couch with cameras cover
ing their genitalia. Lewenstein's
camera, perhaps suggestively, sports
a large telephoto lens, while Bur
mon's has a much smaller 35mm.
The pair wrote the calendar's in
troduction, a juxtaposition of the
tragedy of the tsunamis and the
"laughter" elicited by naked coeds.
"We intend to make you laugh,"
they wrote. "We intend to make you
laugh in the face of overwhelming
tragedy. We intend to make you
laugh at an inappropriate time."
The calendar will be available in
White Plaza next week for 10 dollars.
