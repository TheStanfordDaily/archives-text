Summertime in Maine, with the lobster fish
ers working the bays and inlets, can evoke a lot
of pastoral images in the traveler. For freshman
Andrew Burmon. most of those images involve
nudity.
It was the Maine lobster fishermen, after all,
that gave him the idea fora pinup calendar fea
turing 14 naked Larkin first-years.
"Every year the lobstermen make these fake
calendars of themselves all posing naked on their
lobster boats," said Burmon, a shaggy-haired
frosh from Weston, Mass. and sometime writer
for The Daily. "They can't make enough money,
ever, on lobster fishing, so they have to do some
thing. Also, they have way too much time on
their hands. They spend most of it drinking.
When they drink I suppose this is the result."
When an earthquake sent tsunamis crashing
across the Indian Ocean shoreline Dec. 26. killing
tens of thousands, Burmon and fellow Larkinites
Pam Geist and Joel Lewenstein. a Daily photog
rapher, had the idea of emulating the lobstermen
to raise money for the affected areas.
It took them two weeks to shoot and produce
the 12-month calendar, pach month featuring a
different Larkin coed (or two) baring almost
everything for the penetrating camera lens of
Burmon and Lewenstein. The black-and-white
calendar — produced by the on-campus FedEx I
Kinko's at cost because of its charitable aims —
starts selling next week for $10. half of which will
go to Save the Children by way of the umbrella
group Stanford Students for Relief.
They have already received orders for 70 cal
endars. and advertising efforts will continue with
a table in White Plaza next week and visits to
dorm meetings by semi-clad Larkinites.
The pictures, which never show the, ahem,
most personal parts, are meant to tease more
than arouse.
"Suggestive nudity," Lewenstein said as an
