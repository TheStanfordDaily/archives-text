Put your money where you mouth is.
That is the goal of the first annual "Not
One Damn Dime Day" taking place today as
one of protests surrounding President George
W. Bush's inauguration and policy in Iraq. Or
ganizers are urging people to demonstrate
their opposition to the war in Iraq by partici
pating in a 24-hour national boycott of all con
sumer spending.
The e-mails circulating around campus are
urging students not to spend any money today:
"For 24 hours, please do what you can to shut
the retail economy down. The object is simple.
Remind the people in power that the war in
Iraq is immoral and illegal; that they are re
sponsible for starting it and that it is their re
sponsibility to stop it."
"Open your mouth by keeping your wallet
closed" is the theme of the event. The e-mail,
whose origin on campus could not be traced
by press time, tells readers: "Not one damn
dime for gasoline. Not one damn dime for ne
cessities or for impulse purchases. Not one
damn dime for religious donations."
Using money — or not using money — to
voice one's political viewpoint is becoming
popular for both liberals and conservatives.
Web sites like Buyblue.org, a California
based nonprofit organization, list companies
that contribute money to political conserva
tives and urge consumers to make their pur
chase elsewhere.
Organizers of today's boycott hope to re
mind politicians that they work for the people
of America, not for the "international corpo
rations and K Street lobbyists that funnel cash
into American politics." Not One Damn
Dime Day also wants politicians to advocate a
return strategy for the troops in Iraq.

"The politicians put the troops in
harm's way. Now 1,2(M) brave young
Americans and (some estimate)
1(M),(XH) Iraqis have died. The politi
cians owe our troops a plan — a way
to come home."
The hardest part of organizing a
day in which supporters "do noth
ing" is the difficulty in measuring its
effects.

"More than half of the voting
electorate supported George W.
Bush, and the potential expendi

Solorzano also questioned the De
mocrats' continued bitterness to
ward the clear majority-vote for
Bush.

it's only because they're pissed that
the entire country is swiftly becom
