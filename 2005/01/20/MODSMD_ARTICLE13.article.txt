On Jan. 20, 1953, The Daily ran a
story about sororities considering
block bidding during the rush
process. Below is an excerpt:
"Members of the Intersorority
Council are considering implement
ing an idea that would allow women
to join sororities in groups instead of
as individuals during the upcoming
spring rush.
"ISC President Suzanne Sch
enedel said each sorority is supposed
to vote on the idea at its next meet
ing. However, she said some sorori
ties had not yet had time to vote on
the matter.
"She said a change in the sorority
rush system that would adopt this
idea of block bidding is not yet
planned. Schendel said, 'It's some
thing we're considering for girls who
might like to all go into the same
sorority.'
"Schendel said the idea for block
bidding has come up with a concern
about how to get groups started. Be
cause women are more likely to join
the larger, more prestigious and es
tablished sororities, Schendel felt
that block bidding would help small
er sororities grow faster.
"if a bunch of girls all know that
they can join the same one, have
more of an influence on the group
and be with their friends, they may
join the same ones,' she added."
On Jan. 20, 1988, The Daily ran a
story about a proposed change to the
University's Area One requirement
that would include in the Western

Culture program tracks to read
works by women and people of color.
Below is an excerpt:
"A group of 25 humanities and
social science professors brought to
gether by English Prof. William
Chace has formulated and distrib
uted an alternative to proposed leg
islation by the Western Culture Task
Force to change the University's
Area One requirement.
"The group's alternative propos
al calls fora modification of the cur
rent Western Culture program that
would retain a core list of readings,
but would require the various tracks
to read works by women and per
sons of color.
"The alternative proposal also
calls for an amendment to the West
ern Culture requirement mandating
on confrontation of 'issues relating
to class, ethnicity, race, religion, gen
der and sexual orientation' and di
rects the Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies to re-examine the Uni
versity's non-Western Culture re
quirement.
'"Our proposal mandates, or re
quires, that the core list include
readings by women and persons of
color.' Chace said.
"Chace said his group's plan
would make 'de jure' something that
already exists 'de facto.' He said
many tracks already include read
ings from women and persons of
color, so his group's proposal is only
mandating what is already taking
place."
