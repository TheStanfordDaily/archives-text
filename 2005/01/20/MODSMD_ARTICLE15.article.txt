## Oral sex — Not as safe as you might think 
### LAUREN GONG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
After a wild Saturday night, it's not rare
that you hear, "Yeah, we hooked up...
sex? oh god n0... I would never do that. 1
just gave him head." Or. "So did you spit or
did you swallow?"
Milkshake, tea-bagging, lewinsky, fella
tio, giving head, blow-job, cunnilingus —
all common words for an increasingly com
mon practice: oral sex. Many girls and guys
on college campuses everywhere use oral
sex as a supposedly safer alternative to in
tercourse. But whether it is truly safer
when it comes to STDs or emotional at
tachment is debatable.
According to student volunteers at the
Sexual Health Peer Resource Center at
Vaden, there are many risks associated with
unprotected oral sex. Some STDs that are
passed on from oral sex include oral herpes,
chlamydia of the throat, yeast infection, gon
orrhea, syphilis, hepatitis A and E, HIV, and
in rare cases HPV. which can be transmitted
as blisters on the vocal cords.
Some of these STDs are more com
mon than others. According to Senior
Elise Hunter, co-director of the SHPRC,
the two most common STDs passed
through oral contact are Herpes I and 11,
and chlamydia.
A common misconception is that Her
pes I is restricted to the oral area and Her
pes 11 is restricted to the genital region. In
reality, the two can appear in either loca
tion. HI V is a fatal disease that can be trans
mitted through oral contact. The risk is in
creased if the person giving oral stimulation
has sores in his or her mouth.
In terms of STD risks, oral sex is about
as dangerous as sexual intercourse without
a condom. Heterosexual intercourse car
ries the risk of pregnancy, unlike any form
of oral sex alone. Of course, overall risk de
pends on the communication level be
tween partners, sexual histories, frequency
of contact and whether or not they are reg
ularly tested.
If one doesn't know the STD status
of his or her partner, the SHPRC sug
gests using protection when engaging in
any sexual activity.
To keep safe, there are many options.
The best way to prevent STDs is to use
protective barriers such as condoms or
dental dams, which are little squares of
latex that can be spread over genitals
during oral sex. Most barriers are made
of latex or polyurethene, and many fla
vored varieties are made specifically for

oral sex.
Also, never have sex during breakouts,
symptomatic of viruses such as HPV and
Herpes. You should also wait for curable
infections such as gonorrhea, chlamydia
and syphilis to clear up before you engage
in any sexual activity.
"It's so easy to carry a condom or den
tal dam, and theyle not as unsexy as peo
ple seem to think," said senior Sara
Weekly, co-instructor of the SHPRC sex
class. "You can make a condom sexy, so
try it. And one night is not worth warts on
your vocal cords or yeast infection dis
charge running down your throat."
Weekly also informed me that 25 per
cent of college students have an STD. And
for those of you who are thinking, "pshh,
these national statistics don't apply to a
place like Stanford," think again. The top
three STDs on the farm are. in order. HPV,
herpes and chlamydia.
STDs are the primary medical risk
when engaging in unprotected sex, but
there are other dangers to hook-ups
such as emotional attachment. A fair
number of people 1 have talked to de
fine a hook-up as "anything but inter
course." So why is oral any different?
Why are more emotions attached to one
bodily orifice than another?
Oral sex is still a sexual activity like
any other. There is still intimacy, pleasure
and emotion, not to mention the risks as
sociated with actual sex.
I guess what it comes down to is psy
chology: how people perceive what is sex
and what is not — often a very a person
al definition. Many students agree there
is a way to mentally detach yourself
when you feel you are not giving all of
yourself away.
"It's totally cool and healthy as long as
it's consensual and people make healthy,
protective decisions emotionally and
physically," Weekly said. "People can
make their own decisions about when and
with whom to do it.and whether or not
they'll consider it "real sex." "
So whatever stance one takes on this
subject, it's just good common sense to be
informed about exactly what he or she is
getting themself into. And if 1 can offer
one last piece of advice: Remember the
golden rule — always do unto others as
you would like others to do unto you.
