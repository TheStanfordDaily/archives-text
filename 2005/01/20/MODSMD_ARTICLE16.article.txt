# Dare to... DETOXIFY
## Detox diets raise serious health questions 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
Senior David Louk used to eat fast food
four to five times a week and snack through
out the day on sugar- and fat-laden foods
such as cookies and chips.
"My eating habits were pretty un
healthy." he admitted.
During the last week of summer, Louk
decided that his diet needed a major over
haul, and he chose the 10-day detox diet.
The program, which he found online, re
quired him to cut out all processed foods
and subsist only on organic fruits and veg
etables, smoothies with rice protein pow
der, brown rice and vitamin supplements.
Detoxification diets, or diets that aim to
rid the body of toxins, are fairly popular,
judging from the plethora of literature
available. The diets run the gamut, from
complete fasting to drinking fruit and veg
etable juices to adhering to a special vege
tarian diet such as Louk's. They can run
anywhere from two to 30 days.
But do they work? And, more impor
tantly. are they healthy?
Proponents of detox diets claim that
the cleansing regimen removes toxins
from the body, including pesticides, en
vironmental pollutants, food additives
and other chemicals. Most of these
chemicals are stored in a person's body
fat, which makes some doctors and natu
ral medicine experts question if a detox
diet can really aid in the removal of
these substances.
"Detox diets are very glamorous be
cause there is an idea that you can get rid
of these so-called toxins from you body,"
said Vivian Crisman. staff nutritionist at
the Vaden Student Health Center. "And
the word toxin is verv loaded. There ex

ists a premise that the body isn't good
enough at detoxifying and that people
need to try a special regimen, but that's
just not true."
If people regularly eat fruits and veg
etables — which are high in antioxidants
— they can fight the formation of free
radicals, biproducts of normal metabolic
processes that may be carcinogenic, ex
plained Crisman.
"But this is a very long-term approach,"
she said. "You have to eat whole grains,
fruits and vegetables and unprocessed
foods on a regular basis. You can't do this
with a short detox diet."
While Crisman doesn't believe that a
compact detox diet will do a young, healthy
person any harm, she is wary of students
who say they are on such a diet but may ac
tually be hiding an eating disorder.
"A person may claim to be on a detox
diet, but it may be masking something
else." Crisman said. "If someone asks why
they're not eating, they could always say
they are on a fast."
And while many people can lose signifi
cant weight on a detox diet, most of that
weight loss comes from simply shedding
pounds of water.
Yet there are some health professionals
who advocate regular detox diets. Chris
tine Rosche, a specialist in eating disor
ders, regularly recommends similar pro
grams to her clients.
"I think that everyone should do a detox
diet at least two times a year," Rosche said.
"But I don't advocate fasting or just jump
ing into a diet without preparing for it first."
Rosche's suggested regimen includes a
preparation period of several days during
which the dieter eats lighter and avoids car
bohydrates, fruits and red meat.
"For the first few days, I have mv clients

eat vegetables and light proteins," she said.
"After the preparation stage, you can only
have vegetable juices, vitamins and a special
supplement that adds protein to your diet."
Rosche also recommends lymphatic
massage.
"It helps flush the chemicals out of your
system." she added.
While experts may disagree on the use
fulness of a detox diet, it can potentially
jump start a healthy eating plan. For Louk,
it completely changed the way he ap
proaches food.
"I used to just pile food onto my tray in
the dining hall," he said. "Now 1 look at nu
trition labels, and I've taken a lot of un
healthy food out of my diet."
Louk has cut out red meat, eats more
fruits and vegetables, and does yoga reg
ularly. He's lost about 20 pounds since
the diet and has drastically altered his
eating habits.
"The diet was a real exercise in will
power," he said. "Believe me, by day four. I
was ready to quit. But I stuck with it, and I
feel much better. I don't know if it is a place
bo effect or something, but my body feels
better and my mind is clearer."
For many, starting a new eating plan and
dropping a few pounds is high up on the list
of New Year's resolutions, but Crisman
cautions students who try to change their
diets overnight.
"If someone is used to eating a low-fiber
diet that consists mostly of junk food, emp
ties their gut out fora few days through a
detox diet, and then changes to a radical
new life plan, they may experience some
gastrointestinal distress, she said. "In
stead, I would advise gradually introducing
high-fiber foods into the diet, increasing
fluid uptake and making healthy eating a
part of you lifestyle."

chemicals are stored in a person's body
fat, which makes some doctors and natu
ral medicine experts question if a detox
diet can really aid in the removal of
these substances.
"Detox diets are very glamorous be
cause there is an idea that you can get rid
of these so-called toxins from you body,"
said Vivian Crisman. staff nutritionist at
the Vaden Student Health Center. "And
the word toxin is verv loaded. There ex

ists a premise that the body isn't good
enough at detoxifying and that people
need to try a special regimen, but that's
just not true."
If people regularly eat fruits and veg
etables — which are high in antioxidants
— they can fight the formation of free
radicals, biproducts of normal metabolic
processes that may be carcinogenic, ex
plained Crisman.
"But this is a very long-term approach,"
she said. "You have to eat whole grains,
fruits and vegetables and unprocessed
foods on a regular basis. You can't do this
with a short detox diet."
While Crisman doesn't believe that a
compact detox diet will do a young, healthy
person any harm, she is wary of students
who say they are on such a diet but may ac
tually be hiding an eating disorder.
"A person may claim to be on a detox
diet, but it may be masking something
else." Crisman said. "If someone asks why
they're not eating, they could always say
they are on a fast."
And while many people can lose signifi
cant weight on a detox diet, most of that
weight loss comes from simply shedding
pounds of water.
Yet there are some health professionals
who advocate regular detox diets. Chris
tine Rosche, a specialist in eating disor
ders, regularly recommends similar pro
grams to her clients.
"I think that everyone should do a detox
diet at least two times a year," Rosche said.
"But I don't advocate fasting or just jump
ing into a diet without preparing for it first."
Rosche's suggested regimen includes a
preparation period of several days during
which the dieter eats lighter and avoids car
bohydrates, fruits and red meat.
"For the first few days, I have mv clients

eat vegetables and light proteins," she said.
"After the preparation stage, you can only
have vegetable juices, vitamins and a special
supplement that adds protein to your diet."
Rosche also recommends lymphatic
massage.
"It helps flush the chemicals out of your
system." she added.
While experts may disagree on the use
fulness of a detox diet, it can potentially
jump start a healthy eating plan. For Louk,
it completely changed the way he ap
proaches food.
"I used to just pile food onto my tray in
the dining hall," he said. "Now 1 look at nu
trition labels, and I've taken a lot of un
healthy food out of my diet."
Louk has cut out red meat, eats more
fruits and vegetables, and does yoga reg
ularly. He's lost about 20 pounds since
the diet and has drastically altered his
eating habits.
"The diet was a real exercise in will
power," he said. "Believe me, by day four. I
was ready to quit. But I stuck with it, and I
feel much better. I don't know if it is a place
bo effect or something, but my body feels
better and my mind is clearer."
For many, starting a new eating plan and
dropping a few pounds is high up on the list
of New Year's resolutions, but Crisman
cautions students who try to change their
diets overnight.
"If someone is used to eating a low-fiber
diet that consists mostly of junk food, emp
ties their gut out fora few days through a
detox diet, and then changes to a radical
new life plan, they may experience some
gastrointestinal distress, she said. "In
stead, I would advise gradually introducing
high-fiber foods into the diet, increasing
fluid uptake and making healthy eating a
part of you lifestyle."
Senior David Louk used to eat fast food
four to five times a week and snack through
out the day on sugar- and fat-laden foods
such as cookies and chips.
"My eating habits were pretty un
healthy." he admitted.
During the last week of summer, Louk
decided that his diet needed a major over
haul, and he chose the 10-day detox diet.
The program, which he found online, re
quired him to cut out all processed foods
and subsist only on organic fruits and veg
etables, smoothies with rice protein pow
der, brown rice and vitamin supplements.
Detoxification diets, or diets that aim to
rid the body of toxins, are fairly popular,
judging from the plethora of literature
available. The diets run the gamut, from
complete fasting to drinking fruit and veg
etable juices to adhering to a special vege
tarian diet such as Louk's. They can run
anywhere from two to 30 days.
But do they work? And, more impor
tantly. are they healthy?
Proponents of detox diets claim that
the cleansing regimen removes toxins
from the body, including pesticides, en
vironmental pollutants, food additives
and other chemicals. Most of these
chemicals are stored in a person's body
fat, which makes some doctors and natu
ral medicine experts question if a detox
