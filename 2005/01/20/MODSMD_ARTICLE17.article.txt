# Pomegranate juice: Miracle in a bottle?
## What are free radicals — and is getting rid of them worth $5 a pop? 
### JILLIAN WONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ever heard a beverage referred to as in
triguing? A super power? The newly popu
lar POM Wonderful brand of pomegranate
juice would have you believe its product is
all this and more.
According to the company's web site,
the juice contains "more antioxidant
power than any other drink." But what
does this mean? And more importantly, is
it true of the increasingly pricey
pomegranate juice, or is it nothing more
than a passing craze?
Squeezed from the reddish-purple
pomegranate fruit, the juice has been
advertised as a tasty defender against
disease, not to mention free radicals —
unstable oxygen molecules that can
damage cells and lead to a litany of
major health problems: Alzheimer's,
heart disease, rapid aging, high choles
terol and some cancers.
The human body is exposed to free
radicals, also known as oxidants, every
day. Cigarette smoke, for example, re
leases concentrated amounts of free rad
icals that are then inhaled. On top of ex
ternal sources, every cell in the body gen
erates tens of thousands of oxidants
every day.
A study conducted at UC-Davis found
that pomegranate juice contains nearly
three times as many antioxidants as other
top free-radical blockers, including blue
berry juice and red wine.
Pomegranates also contain tannins,
anthocvanins and polyphenols, which
fight disease, according to a study con
ducted at the Lipid Research Laboratory
in Haifa. Israel.
Freshman Soninier Panage not only en
joys the health benefits of pomegranate
juice, but also its taste.
"1 drank pomegranate juice knowing
that it contains vitamin C and potassium.

and that it helps to prevent cancer." she
said. "I personally really loved the sweet
taste of the juice, but 1 know that it's one
of those things where you might like it.
but the person next to you doesn't."

But POM doesn't have everyone run
ning to the supermarket. Many remain
skeptical of the juice's trendy image.
For one thing, the pomegranate's
popularity has turned it into quite the
delicacy. It's no mystery why the übiq
uitous advertisements never mention
the price. According to the POM Won
derful website, the average price fora
medium-sized bottle of the juice is $5,
pretty steep compared to $1 bottles of
Dasani water available in campus vend
ing machines.
Students looking to integrate
pomegranate juice into their diets without
making a dent in their spending money
might consider mixing the drink with tonic
water fora tangv cocktail or orange juice
fora breakfast boost.
But even though some advertise
ments brag that the beverage will fulfill
one's wildest antioxidant dreams, ex
perts say it is far from being a nutrition
al silver bullet.
Vaden nutritionist Vivian Crisman, for
one. doesn't buy into the all too recent
hype surrounding pomegranate juice.
"Yes, it is very high in antioxidants,
and thus being touted as having signifi
cant health benefits," she said. "But is it
a miracle drink? No, 1 don't view any
one food as a miracle food. It can be
part of a well-rounded diet, high in
fruits and vegetables."
Yet even if one wants to sport a cute
bottle of POM around campus, he or she
will have to find a ride to Safeway, since
the drink is not distributed on campus.
This does not mean, however, that
there aren't many ways to meet one's an
tioxidant quota during the day. Easily ac
cessible sources — including gingko bilo
ba. green tea, orange juice and vegetables
with distinct colors like tomatoes, broc
coli and corn — are all available in dorm
dining halls, and might go a little easier
on vour wallet.

For one thing, the pomegranate's
popularity has turned it into quite the
delicacy. It's no mystery why the übiq
uitous advertisements never mention
the price. According to the POM Won
derful website, the average price fora
medium-sized bottle of the juice is $5,
pretty steep compared to $1 bottles of
Dasani water available in campus vend
ing machines.
Students looking to integrate
pomegranate juice into their diets without
making a dent in their spending money
might consider mixing the drink with tonic
water fora tangv cocktail or orange juice
fora breakfast boost.
But even though some advertise
ments brag that the beverage will fulfill
one's wildest antioxidant dreams, ex
perts say it is far from being a nutrition
al silver bullet.
Vaden nutritionist Vivian Crisman, for
one. doesn't buy into the all too recent
hype surrounding pomegranate juice.
"Yes, it is very high in antioxidants,
and thus being touted as having signifi
cant health benefits," she said. "But is it
a miracle drink? No, 1 don't view any
one food as a miracle food. It can be
part of a well-rounded diet, high in
fruits and vegetables."
Yet even if one wants to sport a cute
bottle of POM around campus, he or she
will have to find a ride to Safeway, since
the drink is not distributed on campus.
This does not mean, however, that
there aren't many ways to meet one's an
tioxidant quota during the day. Easily ac
cessible sources — including gingko bilo
ba. green tea, orange juice and vegetables
with distinct colors like tomatoes, broc
coli and corn — are all available in dorm
dining halls, and might go a little easier
on vour wallet.
