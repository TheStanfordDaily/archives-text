## Editorial Grad students deserve tax break 
### 
The I Jnited States is known around the world
forits federal funding of education, the gov
ernment eould improve its support of high
er education by making graduate student
stipends tax-exempt. While Stanford already does a
great deal to support its graduate students, it should
help the GSC lobby for new legislation in Congress
that will financially help graduate students.
In 1986, Congress passed legislation that allowed
the federal government to tax the portion of graduate
students' stipends that covers room, board and other
living expenses. Before that, graduate student stipends
were fully tax-exempt if applied toward these sorts of
costs.
Recently there has been some legislation to reme
dy the situation. Last year. Rep. Phil English, a Penn
sylvanian Republican, introduced a bill that would
save most graduate students $1,000 to $2,000 a year.
The bill would treat room and board as <\ "qualified
educational expense," meaning that stipends applied
toward these costs would be tax-exempt. The Nation

The Graduate Student Council is leading an advo

meeting on this topic.
The University has already done a great deal to en
hance the on-campus living situation for its graduate
students, as it houses a higher percentage of its gradu
ate students than any other peer research institution.
Over the last six years alone, more than 700 new stu
dios have been built for graduate students.
Additionally, the University recently established
the Commission on Graduate Education to improve
graduate curricula and academic standards.
The University administration should actively sup
port the GSC in its effort to push this piece of legisla
tion through Congress. By doing so. Stanford will con
tinue to demonstrate nationally that it cares about ad
vancing the cause of graduate education.
