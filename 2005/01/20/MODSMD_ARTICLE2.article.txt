## Cardinal are 3-1 against ranked opponents this season 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you want to come into Maples Pavilion and
leave with a win against this year's No. 5 Stanford
women's basketball team (15-2,6-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference), you better have all your weapons primed
and ready. The No. 25 UCLA Lady Bruins (11-5,5-
2) come to Palo Alto tonight without their top gun.

Standout sophomore
guard Noelle Quinn under
went arthroscopic knee
surgery on her left knee
yesterday to repair carti
lage damage. She injured
her knee while driving to
make a basket in the lane in
the first half of a game
against Arizona on Sunday
in Pauley Pavilion. Quinn,
who is averaging 16.9 points
(4th in the Pac-10) and 7.1
rebounds (4th in the Pac
-10), is not expected to make
the trip out to the Bay
Area. The injury is expect
ed to keep her out 3-6
weeks.
"We will certainly miss
Noelle's presence in our
lineup," said UCLA head
coach Kathy Olivier. "She
is a large part of our team's
success both on and off the
court, and we wish her a
speedy recovery. This now
creates an opportunity for
several of our young play-

ers to step up and answer the challenge of keeping
us in the Pac-10 race."
UCLA will rely on freshman forward Lindsey
Pluimer (10.3 ppg) and junior guards Nikki Blue

(11.9 ppg) and Lisa Willis (14.6 ppg) to pick up the
scoring burden in the absence of Quinn.
After starting the season with five straight Pac-10
wins and optimism that could hardly be contained,
the Bruins have dropped their last two Pac-10 games
to Arizona and Arizona State. Willis scored 24
points in an 84-73 losing effort against Arizona on
Sunday. Blue's last-second shot in the lane did not
fall against visiting ASU, which snapped the Bruins'
10-game home-court winning streak with a 44-42
victory on Jan. 14.
While the Bruins are seemingly falling off of the
horse, the Cardinal are hot. They are looking for
their seventh straight win overall and 16th straight
home win. Stanford is coming off a 76-66 win over
No. 15 Boston College.
The Cardinal jumped out to an early lead against
the Eagles, carrying a 20-point lead into halftime.
Stanford almost gave the game back, but showed
poise and maturity in holding off the Eagles to get
the win.
"1 knew a 20-point lead wasn't going to be
enough," Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said. "1
don't know if I communicated that to the team very
well. We had our hands full. We have to do the right
thing or they make you pay."
The key to the matchup against the Bruins will be
to control the tempo and win the battle of guard
play. Although UCLA boasts a pair of talented
guards in Blue and Willis, the Cardinal have their
own formidable trio of guards in freshman Candice
Wiggins and seniors Kelley Suminski and Susan
King Borchardt.
Wiggins has been phenomenal all season long,
leading Stanford in scoring with 17.0 points per
game. Suminski has been a stalwart in the back
court. averaging 11.4 points per game and dishing
out 40 assists. Borchardt, who has come back
from foot surgery this season, has slowly worked
herself back into the mix, adding more minutes
and points with each game.
Even with the consistently solid play of
the Cardinal in mind, it wouldn't be wise to com
pletely discount the Bruins. UCLA has managed
a 2-1 record against ranked opponents, upsetting
then-N0.4 Texas and then-N0.14 Purdue earlier
this season.

The Cardinal have won the last 11 meetings be
tween the two schools, and the last time the Bruins
defeated Stanford at Maples was Jan. 16,1999.
One of the concerns that the Cardinal must har
bor going into tonight's game is UCLA's athleti
cism. Stanford will look to combat the Bruins ath
letic abilities with a strong, controlled game and
by jumping out to an early lead. The Cardinal have
done an excellent job of that so far this season,
owning the lead at halftime in every game this sea
son and out-scoring opponents by an average of
13.2 points in the first 20 minutes.
