# The 						Good Life
## Stanford's brand name isn't enough 
### JULIE PARK 
It w;is my freshman year at Stan
ford, and 1 was ready to milk the col
legiate brand name. Not by wearing a
red STANFORD sweatshirt — 1 was
hoping that the name would mean
something in my search fora summer
job.
Equipped with the Princeton Re
view's guide to internships, I flipped
through the pages, smacking Post-it
notes on every 10th page, noting in
ternships in advertising, magazines,
education and publishing. I thought,
maybe, with "Stanford" on my re
sume. I could land an internship.
The only thing I stood a chance for
was being an RA at (TY, nerd camp
for gifted kids — or not-so-gifted kids
like me whose parents made them
study for the eligibility test, which in
flated test scores.
I applied to work there, imagining
what a blast it would be to hang out
with the other RAs while the kids
were in class, getting paid to be at the
camp my parents used to have to pay
for me to be at.
But 1 couldn't get an interview
with (TY. presumably because I had
almost no experience working with
kids. With no plans for the summer, I
took the Marguerite to Stanford
Shopping Center, where I couldn't
get a job at the Gap or any other store
I wanted discounts at. (My applica
tion was stark white in the blanks for
"Job Experience.")
Hut eventually a manager at a
local upscale garden bench-tools
pots-plants store hired me after a five
minute interview, which should have
been a red flag. Summer was coming.

and I was going to work at the mall for
mv first job ever, living on campus
with other students who had real jobs.
I. like so many other retail "sales
associates" before me, derived no ful
fillment whatsoever from pitching
$ 1.2(H) teak benches to middle-aged,
Mercedes-steering, chai latte-sipping
couples with two-year-olds in deluxe
SUV-inspired strollers.
Confined not to an office but to a
few meager square feet of the artifi
cial enclave known as "mall," 1 was
now a slave to the corporate monster
that is retail.
My green apron said it all: I was a
second-class servant of these espres
so-machine-owning power pur
chasers. My job was to sell the teak
furniture because that's where the
real cha-ching comes from.
I began my first job ever by work
ing hard, meaning I was so bored 1
diligently wiped the glass vases in the
front window with Windex until they
sparkled, ready to be smeared with
fresh fingerprints. 1 thoroughly wa
tered all the orchids and weird flow
ers sprouting from lava rocks. 1 will
ingly ran up to the stuffy slock room
to check if there were any "slightly
pinker" faux-moss-accented terra
cotta pots for one customer.
And then began my fall from the
garden store. A natural introvert, I
couldn't quite get the hang of shout
ing a phony "Hello!" to every two
and four-legged creature that came
through the doors. I couldn't quite
understand why I wasn't allowed to
sit down fora five-hour shift when
there were chairs and benches scat
tered everywhere throughout the
store.

Forget formal job training. I
learned along the way by asking
"How do y0u...?" every 15 minutes.
And what was up with the employee
handbook? I conveniently found out
that one such handbook existed when
the assistant manager said to me, "oh,
didn't you know that... ? It's in the
handbook."
Oh. you mean the handbook that
the manager never mentioned and
never gave to me?
Why was I doing this job?
I didn't really know why, but it had
something to do with money and
learning how to survive, or something
like that. 1 had to find out eventually
what it's like to try to make a living,
even if it meant wasting part of my life
inhabiting a highly artificial, corpo
rate-controlled public space.
Like investment banking, retail is
the kind of job for which you need to
sell part of your soul to stay sane. Or
maybe you just need a lobotomy.
I learned a lot from my first job
ever. Almost all of the benches on
campus are from this store (don't
even think about stealing them, be
cause they're bolted to the ground).
Most of ail. I learned a simple lesson:
Don't make the same mistake in your
job search and hope an obvious lack
of relevant experience will be
buffered by "Stanford University" on
a resume. You just might end up as a
corporate slave.

real cha-ching comes from.
I began my first job ever by work
ing hard, meaning I was so bored 1
diligently wiped the glass vases in the
front window with Windex until they
sparkled, ready to be smeared with
fresh fingerprints. 1 thoroughly wa
tered all the orchids and weird flow
ers sprouting from lava rocks. 1 will
ingly ran up to the stuffy slock room
to check if there were any "slightly
pinker" faux-moss-accented terra
cotta pots for one customer.
And then began my fall from the
garden store. A natural introvert, I
couldn't quite get the hang of shout
ing a phony "Hello!" to every two
and four-legged creature that came
through the doors. I couldn't quite
understand why I wasn't allowed to
sit down fora five-hour shift when
there were chairs and benches scat
tered everywhere throughout the
store.

Forget formal job training. I
learned along the way by asking
"How do y0u...?" every 15 minutes.
And what was up with the employee
handbook? I conveniently found out
that one such handbook existed when
the assistant manager said to me, "oh,
didn't you know that... ? It's in the
handbook."
Oh. you mean the handbook that
the manager never mentioned and
never gave to me?
Why was I doing this job?
I didn't really know why, but it had
something to do with money and
learning how to survive, or something
like that. 1 had to find out eventually
what it's like to try to make a living,
even if it meant wasting part of my life
inhabiting a highly artificial, corpo
rate-controlled public space.
Like investment banking, retail is
the kind of job for which you need to
sell part of your soul to stay sane. Or
maybe you just need a lobotomy.
I learned a lot from my first job
ever. Almost all of the benches on
campus are from this store (don't
even think about stealing them, be
cause they're bolted to the ground).
Most of ail. I learned a simple lesson:
Don't make the same mistake in your
job search and hope an obvious lack
of relevant experience will be
buffered by "Stanford University" on
a resume. You just might end up as a
corporate slave.

It w;is my freshman year at Stan
ford, and 1 was ready to milk the col
legiate brand name. Not by wearing a
red STANFORD sweatshirt — 1 was
hoping that the name would mean
something in my search fora summer
job.
Equipped with the Princeton Re
view's guide to internships, I flipped
through the pages, smacking Post-it
notes on every 10th page, noting in
ternships in advertising, magazines,
education and publishing. I thought,
maybe, with "Stanford" on my re
sume. I could land an internship.
The only thing I stood a chance for
was being an RA at (TY, nerd camp
for gifted kids — or not-so-gifted kids
like me whose parents made them
study for the eligibility test, which in
flated test scores.
I applied to work there, imagining
what a blast it would be to hang out
with the other RAs while the kids
were in class, getting paid to be at the
camp my parents used to have to pay
for me to be at.
But 1 couldn't get an interview
with (TY. presumably because I had
almost no experience working with
kids. With no plans for the summer, I
took the Marguerite to Stanford
Shopping Center, where I couldn't
get a job at the Gap or any other store
I wanted discounts at. (My applica
tion was stark white in the blanks for
"Job Experience.")
Hut eventually a manager at a
local upscale garden bench-tools
pots-plants store hired me after a five
minute interview, which should have
been a red flag. Summer was coming.

and I was going to work at the mall for
mv first job ever, living on campus
with other students who had real jobs.
I. like so many other retail "sales
associates" before me, derived no ful
fillment whatsoever from pitching
$ 1.2(H) teak benches to middle-aged,
Mercedes-steering, chai latte-sipping
couples with two-year-olds in deluxe
SUV-inspired strollers.
Confined not to an office but to a
few meager square feet of the artifi
cial enclave known as "mall," 1 was
now a slave to the corporate monster
that is retail.
My green apron said it all: I was a
second-class servant of these espres
so-machine-owning power pur
chasers. My job was to sell the teak
furniture because that's where the
real cha-ching comes from.
