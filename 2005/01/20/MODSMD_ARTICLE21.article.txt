Protesters' efforts are not fruitless
Much to my chagrin, and despite
many of our best efforts, today is an
ominous one — the first of four
years' worth of ominous ones, in fact
— for America and for every other
nation this side of the meteor belt.
As today's inauguration has
grown near, many of my close
friends have devoted hours of their
lives preparing to speak out in
protest on the streets of Washington
D.C., San Francisco and throughout
the rest of the country. And I 've got
ten the chance to hear the question
from many well-intentioned people
on both ends of the political spec
trum. "Why protest? Do you think
you'll stop the election? It's already
decided."
Well, notwithstanding the possi
bility of the sudden confession of
electoral fraud that my roommate's
been holding out for. of course it's al
ready decided But protests have an
important audience nonetheless.
Those who speak out today will
show the Bush administration they
don't have the mandate they pre

tend to have.
They'll show international audi
ences that our president and his ac
tions don't speak for all of us.
They'll show politicians on the left
that we support their devotion to
progressive values. They'll show the
youth majority who turned out over
whelmingly in favor of Kerry to
never surrender what they believe
in.
This afternoon I'll he at the rally
in White Plaza from noon to 1 p.m.,
showing Stanford students and the
world that we're going to keep
Standing I Jp for Change. Even if the
election's already decided. I hope
you'll join me.

Leftist rhetoric keeps U.S. from
reaching its full potential
Brian Colwcll completely misses
the point of Will Nelson's reasoned
and realistic articlc.
Nowhere in his article does Nel
son say that the protesters should
not have the right, or be hindered at

all. in staging a peaceful demonstra
tion. However. Covvell is still "dis
mayed" "as an American" that Mr.
Colwell "denigrates ... our national
history and culture." This is the same
alarmist language used hv George
W. Bush during the campaign that
no doubt made Colwell ballistic.
Nelson is actually giving bal
anced. pragmatic advice that the
protesters, and all Democrats,
should heed if they ever want to gen
erate realistic change. The people
who will assemble against Bush
today hold no hopes of changing
people's minds or generating any
real discussion. By equating the
president to a reckless murderer and
by tying their protests to extreme
leftist rhetoric, the protesters are
clearly trying to vent frustration and
harden battle lines in our country.
Which is okay...
But as a supporter of Bush who
certainly does not agree with every
thing he has done or stands for, I
wish the opposition's response to the
president — and the war. and his So
cial Security plan, and his environ
mental. social and economic policies
— would go hevond unabashed

Bush-hate. These are direlv serious
issues that must be questioned, de
bated. and compromised on in order
to produce good.
As long as the protesters — and
more importantly, the Democratic
Party in general — have embarrass
ing and marginalizing the President
and not generating serious debate
as their primary motivation,
Democrats will continue to flounder
and this country will not achieve its
true potential.

Stanford kids are not that ugly
I read Lashnits' and Stone's ex
pose ("Stanford kids are uglv." Jan.
14) on the ugliness of Stanford stu
dents with a sense of growing disbe
lief. As a grad student with some ex
perience with other institutions. I
would urge them to lower their stan
dards, posthaste.
Let me explain. 1 went to the Uni
versity of Chicago as an undergrad,
the dean for which proclaims that,
while it is not where fun goes to die.

it is where fun goes to rationalize.
We are not conventionally attractive
people. It is cold and gray and we
spend a great deal of our time in the
library. For much of the year we are
so heavily bundled up that determin
ing gender is largely guesswork. We
have odd hair and had skin. Many of
my friends regularly wore capes. It
was, in fact, wonderful. That said,
none of us are likely to be featured in
Abcrcrombic catalogues anytime
soon.
So, as 1 wander around your
green, summer-camp-like campus,
watching undergrads hounding
around like large happy golden re
trievers. I am somehow unimpressed
bv protestations of social woes. 1
have seen people with frosted hair
here. I have seen people biking while
wearing high heels. There are ru
mors that your frats serve alcohol on
a regular basis. You do not wear T
shirts depicting your university as a
dinosaur stomping on your souls. So
stop worrying. Be happy. For heav
en's sake.

Well, notwithstanding the possi
bility of the sudden confession of
electoral fraud that my roommate's
been holding out for. of course it's al
ready decided But protests have an
important audience nonetheless.
Those who speak out today will
show the Bush administration they
don't have the mandate they pre

tend to have.
They'll show international audi
ences that our president and his ac
tions don't speak for all of us.
They'll show politicians on the left
that we support their devotion to
progressive values. They'll show the
youth majority who turned out over
whelmingly in favor of Kerry to
never surrender what they believe
in.
This afternoon I'll he at the rally
in White Plaza from noon to 1 p.m.,
showing Stanford students and the
world that we're going to keep
Standing I Jp for Change. Even if the
election's already decided. I hope
you'll join me.

Leftist rhetoric keeps U.S. from
reaching its full potential
Brian Colwcll completely misses
the point of Will Nelson's reasoned
and realistic articlc.
Nowhere in his article does Nel
son say that the protesters should
not have the right, or be hindered at

all. in staging a peaceful demonstra
tion. However. Covvell is still "dis
mayed" "as an American" that Mr.
Colwell "denigrates ... our national
history and culture." This is the same
alarmist language used hv George
W. Bush during the campaign that
no doubt made Colwell ballistic.
Nelson is actually giving bal
anced. pragmatic advice that the
protesters, and all Democrats,
should heed if they ever want to gen
erate realistic change. The people
who will assemble against Bush
today hold no hopes of changing
people's minds or generating any
real discussion. By equating the
president to a reckless murderer and
by tying their protests to extreme
leftist rhetoric, the protesters are
clearly trying to vent frustration and
harden battle lines in our country.
Which is okay...
But as a supporter of Bush who
certainly does not agree with every
thing he has done or stands for, I
wish the opposition's response to the
president — and the war. and his So
cial Security plan, and his environ
mental. social and economic policies
— would go hevond unabashed

Bush-hate. These are direlv serious
issues that must be questioned, de
bated. and compromised on in order
to produce good.
As long as the protesters — and
more importantly, the Democratic
Party in general — have embarrass
ing and marginalizing the President
and not generating serious debate
as their primary motivation,
Democrats will continue to flounder
and this country will not achieve its
true potential.

Stanford kids are not that ugly
I read Lashnits' and Stone's ex
pose ("Stanford kids are uglv." Jan.
14) on the ugliness of Stanford stu
dents with a sense of growing disbe
lief. As a grad student with some ex
perience with other institutions. I
would urge them to lower their stan
dards, posthaste.
Let me explain. 1 went to the Uni
versity of Chicago as an undergrad,
the dean for which proclaims that,
while it is not where fun goes to die.

it is where fun goes to rationalize.
We are not conventionally attractive
people. It is cold and gray and we
spend a great deal of our time in the
library. For much of the year we are
so heavily bundled up that determin
ing gender is largely guesswork. We
have odd hair and had skin. Many of
my friends regularly wore capes. It
was, in fact, wonderful. That said,
none of us are likely to be featured in
Abcrcrombic catalogues anytime
soon.
So, as 1 wander around your
green, summer-camp-like campus,
watching undergrads hounding
around like large happy golden re
trievers. I am somehow unimpressed
bv protestations of social woes. 1
have seen people with frosted hair
here. I have seen people biking while
wearing high heels. There are ru
mors that your frats serve alcohol on
a regular basis. You do not wear T
shirts depicting your university as a
dinosaur stomping on your souls. So
stop worrying. Be happy. For heav
en's sake.

Protesters' efforts are not fruitless
Much to my chagrin, and despite
many of our best efforts, today is an
ominous one — the first of four
years' worth of ominous ones, in fact
— for America and for every other
nation this side of the meteor belt.
As today's inauguration has
grown near, many of my close
friends have devoted hours of their
lives preparing to speak out in
protest on the streets of Washington
D.C., San Francisco and throughout
the rest of the country. And I 've got
ten the chance to hear the question
from many well-intentioned people
on both ends of the political spec
trum. "Why protest? Do you think
you'll stop the election? It's already
decided."
