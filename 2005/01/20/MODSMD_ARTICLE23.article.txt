## Deconstructing J. Lo 
### 
It you've seen J.Lo.'s new video
"Get Right," you know that she
appears in just about every cos
tume anyone could have imag
ined for her. Getting past all the bad
wigs and make-up, you realize — or
at least I did — that there's only one
element J.Lo forgot to include in
her video: Her "Latin-ness," or La
tinidad.
What am I talking about?
One of her many breathtaking
portrayals of various women in a

club included
that of a stereo
typical. one-di
mensi on a 1
"chola," com
plete with the
tear tattoo on the
corner of one of
her eyes. Very
authentic.
During the
course of a ladies'

gossip session in
the bathroom — with another
"chola" portrayed equally com
pellingly by another J.Lo — the
character whines in that chola voice
about her boyfriend, calling him a
"pendejo."
Now. a cultural aside. Anyone
who is Latino, who has been around
Latinos or knows a little about Lati
nos can tell you that "pendejo" is
not a word to be taken lightly. As a
matter of fact, it's a rather notorious
word since it's so taboo to say.
When I heard J.Lo say it in her
video, I was literally shocked. Not
because she said the word, but be
cause of her pitiful pronunciation —
"pen-DAY-hoe" instead of "pen-
DE-ho."
There are lots of words to mis
pronounce in Spanish, but I'm sorry,
"pendejo" simply isn't one of them
— anyone with any ties to any Lati
no culture, as some would say J.Lo
"occasionally" markets herself to
be. would not mispronounce it so
badly. For comparison's sake, it
would be like an American pro
nouncing the "f-word" incorrcctlv

— it just doesn't happen.
It was at that exact moment I knew
I could never think of her as a Latina
again without giggling to myself.
Why does the pronunciation of
this word matter?
Well, really, the pronunciation it
self doesn't matter one hit — it's the
intentions behind the purposeful
mistake on Ms. Lo's part. It matters
because it proves, to me at least, that
J.Lo. has pimped her Latinidad to
get where she is today (read: "Mi
Familia," "Selena." "In Living
Color." etc.) and promptly disposed
of her culture when its usefulness
expired.
It matters for many reasons,
starting with ingratitude and contin
uing with cowardice, but I think my
most glaring objection is dishonesty
— real Latinos don't use their cul
ture to further their own selfish
goals.
And the saddest thing about the
entire affair is this; J.Lo is not the
first, nor will she be the last, tore
sort to such dastardly means to
achieve success. There are politi
cians. athletes, businesspeople and
even self-proclaimed "community
activists" aplenty who would jump
at the chance to pimp any culture if
it would give them an inch of an op
portunity at personal gain.
But the biggest problem with
using one's culture to bolster per
sonal aspirations — aside from the
fact that doing so is a big, fat lie — is
that in the process you use an entire
population of thousands or millions
of people, and then leave them
empty-handed without so much as a
thank you.
And if using an individual person
to get what you want is wrong, does
a word even exist to label those who
use an entire people?
