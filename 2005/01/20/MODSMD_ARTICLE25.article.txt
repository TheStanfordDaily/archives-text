## The 						Double Clutch Sunday’s games provide reason for excitement 
### 
As my buddy would say, I'm not a real
ly a 'sports fan' —■ I'm an athlete who
happens to enjoy watching the game.
(I'd also like to think I'm a better writer than
an athlete, but recent reader e-mails have dis
puted that.)
I don't particularly like seeing player
strikes and lockouts, as if professional athletes

were on par with auto work
ers and coal miners (al
though the NHL may finally
try to fix itself after this sea
son's cancellation.) Nor do I
like in-game brawls, al
though the NBA may yet
figure out that a packed
arena is a pressure cooker of
fan and player tension and
hostility crying out for con
trol.
You could also guess that

I don't like players pretending to moon the
opposition crowd, because Randy Moss' bum
will likely spawn a score of imitators in high
school and youth football who don't know any
better and don't have anyone with the guts to
forcefully tell them so.
Primarily a college fan, it also disturbs me
to see the rules tampering that has long gone
on in the National Football League, with the
aim of strengthening the passing game. It's
hard to argue with their mission to sell tick
ets and TV time, but tell me this list isn't
ridiculous:
1. Holding by offensive lineman is all but
legal, negating even the best pass rushes.
2. An offensive lineman can 'report in' as a
sixth eligible receiver.
3. Defenders cannot touch receivers more
than five yards downfield.
4. Pass interference assumes the ball would
have been caught, giving possession at the
point of infraction — even if it's 50 yards
downfield.
Collegiate football has none of these provi
sions and somehow manages to produce pro
lific passing games year after year, from New
Hampshire to Florida, from California to
Montana.
This season, the competition committee re
emphasized existing rules regarding down
field contact. What resulted was nothing short
of a circus.
It was almost like defense itself had been
outlawed. If you bumped a receiver — even in
the beer line — it was a penalty.
Whole games were decided by officials'
flags coming down in waves. It penalized
teams with the lead, as trailing teams throw
more. And it forced every offense to abandon
balance in the name of quick-strike ability, to
offset the free points.
And the rub was that even the best passing
game in the pros, led by spectacular Peyton
Manning (a true genius of the game) couldn't
reach the Patriot end zone last Sunday. De
spite breaking Dan Marino's season touch
down pass record. Manning's Colts were help
less in the lilting snow of Foxboro.
(Marino, a gifted passer better known to
our generation as the guy who got kidnapped
by a transgendered placekicker in "Ace Ven
tura: Pet Detective," went to his only Super
Bowl in 1984. In Stanford Stadium, the Dol
phins lost to Joe Montana's 49ers.)
BUT — here comes the segue, it's two
columns in one! — much to my delight, the
four teams that remain have shined through
all of this and. dare I say. transported us back
to an older day of football. When the college
season ends. I usually resign myself to a few
weeks of casual Sunday watching, but this
weekend is the juiciest set of pro matchups I
can remember.


Christopher
Anderson
The storylines alone could be an entire column.
The NFL's best defense (and best record) in the 15-1
Pittsburgh Steelers against the most dangerous coaching
mind. New England's Bill Belichick. The most danger
ous player in the league in Atlanta's hybrid quarterback
Michael Vick against the Philadelphia Eagles, the star
crossed crown jewel of the NFC.
Two games in Pennsylvania, in the shadow of Amer
ica's industrial tradition, in the cold and snow where
playoff football — hard-hitting, unapologetic, cannibal
istic football — was meant to be played.
You want defense? Young Jim Mora (who inciden
tally played for my high school coach) built a first-class
defense in San Fran and has not disappointed in Atlanta.
Teams that can run? Vick is Atlanta's best running back.
Corey Dillon, released from his languishing in Cincinnati,
has lifted the Pats' offense to a battering-ram unit.
And the Steelers can ride one of the classiest guys in
the game, Jerome 'The Bus' Bettis.
It's all enough to blow your mind.
The Eagles want to overturn their history of never
quite reaching the top. Should they fail, their famously
surly and unforgiving fan base may reach critical mass of
a sort previously seen only with the Red Sox Nation.
But this weekend, we may all get a taste of turning
back the clock. Maybe the NFL will notice and make an
effort to bring it back permanently.

Christopher /'. Anderson, a first-year graduate student
in electrical engineering, will he watching this Sunday.
