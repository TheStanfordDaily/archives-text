### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The preseason is officially over, and the
No. 6 Stanford women's swimming and div
ing team is ready to start Pacific-10 Confer
ence competition with a bang. The Cardinal
will get that opportunity this weekend
against one of the nation's top teams.
Coming off a commanding home victory
over a relatively weak squad from Pacific,
the Cardinal will be on the road this week
end, visiting No. IS Arizona State and No. 5
Arizona. ASU is not a team to look past,
but the major test will come against the
Wildcats, who lead the Cardinal in the polls
171 points to 158. A victory over Arizona
would put Stanford in a strong position na
tionally as the end of the season approach
es.
"We are looking forward to both compe
titions because it's beginning to be a very
meaningful part of the season in preparation
for the Pac-10 Championships and the
NCAAs." head coach Richard Quick said.
Both of the opponents this weekend are
ranked and have the talent and depth to be

successful at the end of the season. Last year,
the Cardinal swept the Arizona schools on
the way to their 15th Pac-10 championship.
"Arizona is one of the finest teams in
the country, with a possibility of winning
the NCAA championships," Quick said.
"So it will be a real test for our team and
give us an indication of how good we are
and exactly what we need to work on to get
into the picture with Arizona and Auburn
and Georgia."
Georgia currently sits atop the rankings,
with Auburn eight points behind. Florida
and Texas are also battling near the top. just
ahead of Arizona.
Arizona won five of six preseason
meets this season and came in second at
the Texas Invitational in December. The
Wildcats eked out a one-point victory over
No. 10 UCLA and posted dual-meet wins
over three other ranked opponents. At the
2004 National Championships, the Wild
cats placed third overall, two spots ahead
of Stanford, with then-junior Emily Mason
winning the individual championship in
the 400-meter freestyle in NCAA record
time.

Mason returns to lead the team in her se
nior season and is joined by nine more All-
Americans. Fellow senior Jessica Hayes, a
six-time All-American last season, seeks to
defend her Pac-10 title in the 200-meter
backstroke. With 20 returning letter-winners
and only three newcomers. Arizona has a
mature squad with a wealth of experience in
both college and international competition.
"Arizona State is a good team as well —
not as good as Arizona — but they always
present a challenge." Quick said.
In preseason action. ASU also posted vic
tories over some ranked opponents, though
its competition was not as tough as Ari
zona's. The Sun Devils tied No. 17 USC and
lost to No. 10 UCLA. They ended the pre
season on a high note with large margins of
victory over unranked Wyoming and Ore
gon State two weeks ago.
Last year. ASU finished 14th at the Na
tional Championships, led by then-junior
Agnes Kovacs, who placed in the top-10 in
three events. Kovacs returns as a senior to
lead the team, alone with three other All-

The Stanford women's swimming and diving team opens the Pac-10 season against No. 5
Arizona and No. 18 Arizona State this weekend on the road. The Cardinal are seeking their

After several weeks away from
competition, the Stanford divers
will join the swimmers in Arizona
for their first meet of the regular
season.
"We're really excited for this
meet," sophomore Cassidy Krug
said. ' We haven't had a meet since
last quarter, so we're all ready to
go."
The four divers who will com

Ashlee Rosenthal, junior Sara

for conference season

tensely since the team's last com
petition in December. The fifth
member of the team is senior Erin
Lashnits, who was healthy
throughout Christmas training but
will miss the next few weeks with a
broken nose.
Other than Lashnits' injury, very
little marred the progress achieved
over the break.
"Besides the weather, it was
great," coach Rick Schavone said.
"The girls are training just absolute
ly beyond my expectations. The
intra-squad we had last Saturday
was phenomenal. They're diving

very, very well."
The squad will face some good
competition in Arizona this week
end. but Schavone is still optimistic
about the Cardinal's chances.
"1 don't see this as a real tough
weekend for us," he said. "On the
other hand, because I'm pushing
them at such a high level, they might
make some mistakes, which
wouldn't upset me at all."
"1 think we're in a good place
right now," Rosenthal said. "We
definitely have some fine-tuning to
do and a lot more training, but we all
feel strong and ready to go."
