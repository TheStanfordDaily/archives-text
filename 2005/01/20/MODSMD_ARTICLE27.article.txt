# Wrestling 'Ames' for upset
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Take your pick from any one of the hack
neyed sports adages describing the role of
the underdog, from David vs. Goliath' to
'trial by fire" to describe the Stanford
wrestling team's trip to the Midwest this
weekend. The Cardinal (3-2, 0-1 Pacific-10
Conference) head to Ames, lowa to face
No. 3 lowa State (12-0) and Lock Haven
University (3-2) on Friday night.
The Cyclones' 12-0 start is their best
since the 1985-86 season, one year before
they captured their last NCAA team cham
pionship. The streak includes impressive
victories over No. 14 Northern lowa, No. 7
Minnesota and No. 16 Arizona State. lowa
State also downed No. 9 lowa 19-16 on the
road and finished third in this year's Mid
lands Invitational. Stanford placed 25th.
The Cardinal will be face-to-face with
wrestling history when they enter the gym.
lowa State has finished in second place at
the NCAA Championships twice in the past
four years. Cael Sanderson, who went 159-0
in his record-setting four seasons as a Cy
clone, now serves as an assistant coach.
The matchup provides a measuring
stick for Stanford's progress against the
nation's elite.
"Both teams [lowa St.and Lock Haven]
have history on their side and both have
strong historical programs, especially lowa
State." said head coach Steve Buddie. "No
one nationally thinks we will be in the dual
with lowa State."
Nevertheless, the story is not entirely
grim for the Cardinal. The starting
wrestlers have all healed, and Stanford's
best squad of 10 will wrestle.
"There are no key injuries," Buddie said.
"We're getting healthy at the right time."
At the top of the list is defending NCAA
champion at 157 pounds Matt Gentry. Gen
try defeated his likely opponent at 157
pounds, Trent Paulson, 5-1 in the Midlands
semifinals. It was Paulson's only loss of the
season.
Among the Cyclones' other top starters
are 141-pound Midlands champion Nate
Giilick, 125-pound Grant Nakamura,
Travis Paulson at 165 pounds and 184-
pounder Kurt Backes. The last three all
placed second at Midlands.
Nearly all the Stanford starting wrestlers

sat and watched their teammates compete in
the Menlo Park Invitational over the week
end in order to recharge and prepare for Fri
day's dual. Powered by Gentry's return and
a rested starting lineup, Stanford will be
looking for more pins and a faster start than
usual to pull off the upset.
"As a team. I'd like to see us pin more,
but every coach wants that," Buddie said.
"Still, it's something we can work on. We
can also work on our match preparation. We

still have some issues with being slower in
first rounds of tournaments than I'd like."
One possible douhle-edged sword for
Stanford could be overlooking Lock
Haven given the Cyclones' national repu
tation, but the team insists that it takes
every opponent seriously. Two of the Bald
Eagles' three wins this season came against
American University (0-4). They lost to In
diana at the University of Virginia Duals
last week 32-4.

lowa State could just as easily overlook
the Cardinal, with an upcoming dual meet
against top-ranked Oklahoma State (8-0).
"I know our team can pull off the
upset." Buddie said. "1 really think we
match up with them better than many peo
ple may think.
The Cardinal will get little rest after Fri
day's meet, flying back to California to face
Cal State-Bakersfield on Sunday in a cru
cial Pac-lOdual meet.
