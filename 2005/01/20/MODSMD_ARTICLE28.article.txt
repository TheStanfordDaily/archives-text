# Women open season at UW
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Generally, when a team is la
beled small, it means its players are
at a disadvantage. Gymnastics, of
course, is an entirely different ball
game, with short people dominat
ing the sport. While a team of short
gymnasts is a good thing, a team
short on gymnasts poses a bit of a
challenge.
With eight out of 11 athletes
healthy, the Stanford women's
gymnastics team is short on gym
nasts. The average team size in the
Pacific-10 Conference is 14
women. The smallest team is Ari
zona State with 10 gymnasts, but
right now Stanford is effectively
smaller since only eight of its gym
nasts are healthy enough to com
pete.
To aggravate the situation, both
of Stanford's healthy juniors —
Natalie Foley and Glyn Sweets —
rolled their ankles in practice last
week, leaving the team with six
healthy gymnasts. Team captain
and eight-time All-American Foley
sprained her ankle on a dismount

off the balance beam and Sweets
hurt her ankle coming off a rope
that the team climbs for strength
conditioning.
Rather than having Foley and
Sweets compete with injuries, head
coach Kristen Smyth cancelled the
team's first meet of the season last
weekend against California.
"My number one priority is the
health of my student-athletes."
Smyth said. "Last weekend we
were in a precarious situation. If we
went to the meet, Natalie and Glyn
would have had to compete with in
juries."
Foley and Sweets have since re
cuperated and will compete this
Friday as the Cardinal opens its
season on the road against No. 18
Washington. Stanford was ranked
No. 3 in the pre-season poll but
heads into Friday's meet unranked.
Washington's 16-member team,
double the size of Stanford's
healthy team, is coming off an
upset of No. 7 Arizona State, the
first time that the Huskies have de
feated the Sun Devils on the road.
Washington is ranked No. 1 in the
floor exercise after some excellent

performances against Arizona
State.
This Friday, however, the
Huskies will be without their cap
tain and top scorer, senior Carly
Dockendorf. due to a groin injury.
"Washington is a great team and
Washington is never an easy place
to compete," Smyth said. "Being on
the road is always difficult. And
Washington has had great success
with two meets under their belt. It
should be a great competition."
Stanford's chance for success
against Washington rests largely on
the shoulders of its freshman ciass.
Freshmen will account for five of
the eight Stanford gymnasts, and
they will be performing 16 of the
meet's 24 routines for the Cardinal.
(In college gymnastics, each team
puts six gymnasts up on each of the
four events. The top five out of six
scores are counted toward the team
total.)
Although most members of
Stanford's highly touted freshman
class have experience competing on
the international stage, Friday will
