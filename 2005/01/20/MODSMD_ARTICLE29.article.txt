# Princeton alumni help save wrestling program

### EMILY LAMMERS THE DAILY PRINCETONIAN (PRINCETON U 
U-WIRE — Most University of Princeton athletes go
to practice day after day simply expecting that their
coaches and team will always be there, that there will
always be competitions and that there will always be
next year. But for the Princeton wrestling team, which
had competed since 1905 — 100 years ago next month
— this wasn't always so.
On March 17, 1993, then-Director of Athletics Bob
Myslik and the university announced that varsity
wrestling would be discontinued due to financial con
straints, gender inequity and limited admission open
ings. The team had the mat pulled out from under it.
And Princeton, it appeared, had hopped on the band
wagon with the other 170 NCAA institutions that had
dropped their varsity wrestling programs since 1972,
when Title IX became law.
Those who cared deeply about Princeton wrestling,
particularly the alumni, were outraged. Demonstra
tions during the P-Rade and a 24-hour wrestling
marathon in front of Firestone Library were held.
Many alums wrote letters and some vowed never to
support the University again.
As media outlets put pressure on the university for
the decision. President Harold Shapiro announced
that he would review the decision. A few months
later, he and the board of trustees upheld Myslik's
original decision.
Besides the university's funding and admissions is

sues, the wrestling program also had Title IX working
against it. Signed into law hv President Nixon, it stated
that, "No person in the United States shall, on the basis
of sex, be excluded from participation in. be denied the
benefits of. or be subjected to discrimination under any
education program or activity receiving Federal finan
cial assistance."
Title IX had allowed Brown University's women's
gymnastics and volleyball teams to sue when their pro
grams were cut for budgetary reasons the same year.
However. Princeton wrestling did not have the
same opportunity. If reinstated, the program would
worsen the university's standing under the require
ment of the Office of Civil Rights' athletic standards
of which Princeton was already in violation. The
OCR's three tests for compliance are proportionali
ty with the general student body, a history of pro
gram expansion for the underrepresented gender
and accomodates the interest and ability of the un
derrepresented sex. If Princeton brought wrestling
back, it would be expanding opportunities for the
overrepresented sex.
The outlook for the wrestling program looked
bleak. But as one wrestling alumnus wrote in a letter to
President Shapiro, "Wrestlers are different. Wrestlers
are fighters."
His words rang true as the Friends of Princeton
Wrestling, led by chairman Clay McEldowney, started
a successful campaign to raise $3 million, which became
an endowment for the wrestling program.
Wrestling alumnus Eric Pearson put his career on
hold to coach the new club team. While the program

continued to survive, it did not prosper. No admissions
help was offered by the university and some years the
team had to compete with just six wrestlers.
Meanwhile, current Director of Athletics Gary Wal
ters. who was hired in 1994. made it a priority to
"strengthen gender equity." He upgraded women's
water polo from a club sport to a varsity sport and es
tablished a new women's lightweight crew.
The wrestling alumni came to the university's exec
utive board with their offer in 19%. and the program
was formally reinstated in 1997. Current head coach
Mike New took over for Pearson. The program was
then allowed to recruit again thanks to help from Dean
of Admissions [-red Hargadon.
At the time of reinstatement, however, there was no
place for the team to practice since the wrestling room
in Jadwin had been converted to a varsity football
weight room. There was room fora weight room in the
plans for Princeton Stadium, but not enough funds to
build one.
"The Friends of Princeton Wrestling offered to pay
for the football team's weight room in Princeton Stadi
um in order to get the wrestling room in Jadwin back."
McEldowney said.
With the roadblocks removed. Princeton wrestling
was on its way back. In 2004, the Friends of Princeton
Wrestling reached their endowment goal of $3 million
and thus the program will be eligible to receive univer
sity funding again.
This year, the program will celebrate its 100 th an
niversary in February. It will be a special centennial,
one that almost didn't happen.
