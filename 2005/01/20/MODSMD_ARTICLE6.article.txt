# Resilient Borchardt still 'doing it all'
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
You'll see her. Blonde pony tail bobbing, she's
yo-yoing up and down while bringing the ball down
the court.
You'll see her on defense. She's the one making
1(K) percent effort seem downright lazy.
You might even catch a glimpse of her kneeling
down in the midst of her teammates before the
opening tip. Like a quarterback commanding her
huddle, she draws the total focus of each pair of
eyes.
"She does it all," freshman Jessica Elway said.
"She's definitely vocal and always encouraging ev
eryone off the court. At the same time, with how
hard she plays and how she presents herself, she's a
leader on the court as well."
Watch fifth-year senior Susan King Borchardt
play basketball and you'll see a great performer.
What you can't see is where she's been and how
she got to this point. You can't see the disappoint
ments and the hours of rehab. You can't see the
commitment to her teammates and love for her
school. But without all that, vou wouldn't see her at
all.
Ten months ago, Borchardt had a decision to
make. When the Cardinal lost in the Elite Eight of
the 2004 NCAA Tournament, Borchardt pon
dered whether or not she would return to her bas
ketball family for her final year of eligibility. On
one hand, there was another chance at the Final
Four to consider. There were her teammates with
whom she had practiced and trained for four
years.
On the other hand, there was Curtis Borchardt,
her husband of seven months. The former Stanford
basketball star was playing for the NBA's Utah
Jazz, and the new couple had already purchased a

house in Utah. A return to the Farm would mean a
second season of cross-country marriage.
"It was tough." Curtis said of the 2003-04 sea
son. "I broke my wrist last year, so I wasn't really
busy [playing]. If you're both busy at the same time,
it's a lot easier, and the time goes by faster. When
one of you gets hurt, it makes it a lot tougher.''
Of course, if she were the type to back away
from adversity, she would never have made it this
l;u
Rewind to the fall of 2000, Susan King's first
year on the Farm. Starting the first nine games of
her college career, she is emerging as one of the
nation's most promising guards, averaging 11.3
points per game along with an eye-popping 5.1
assists.
Then, in the second half of a game at Oklahoma,
she sprints out on a fast break, only to be "tackled"
by a frantic defender. The result is a devastating
tear in the ACL of her right knee and an early end
to a promising freshman season.
"I was out [at Stanford] for basketball and
school," Susan said. "Not having basketball took
away a big chunk of the reason I felt I was here."
"I think athletes tend to define themselves by
their performance on the court," Curtis agrees.
"When you're hurt, you don't really feel like you're
a part of the team."
After multiple surgeries and an offseason of
rehab, Susan was ready to pick up where she left off
the year before. Then the unthinkable happened.
In just her second game back from injury, she
stretched her repaired knee ligament, ending her
second season almost before it started.
It was a blow seemingly too great for one person
to handle. Fortunately, she had help. Having met
while rehabbing their respective injuries, Susan
and Curtis were dating when she re-aggravated the
knee.

In the midst of driving back and forth to San
Francisco four times a week for physical therapy,
she enjoyed Curtis's success on the men's team as
well as his encouragement off the court.
"The second time," she said, "there was some
thing besides basketball to focus on, which was
good."
Once again, Susan battled her way back to the
court, becoming a model of resilience.
"She is a driven young lady," said head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "She has had to really over
come huge adversity, and she has my utmost re
spect and admiration. She's an inspiration."
From 2002-04, Borchardt started 64 of the Car
dinal's 66 games, collecting Pacific-10 Conference
honors in her only two full seasons. Meanwhile, she
supported Curtis as he left Stanford for the NBA
draft and as he battled foot and wrist injuries.
Which brings us back to The Decision. All eyes
were on her.
"I made it clear to her that I wanted her to
come back, but that it was totally her decision,"
VanDerveer said. "I said, 'Whatever works for
you is what's best for us, too."'
"(Curtis] said Hey, selfishly I want you out in
Utah, but at the same time I don't want you to be
upset that you didn't come back,"' Susan said.
Finally, she made her choice.
"Honestly, I was not optimistic," VanDerveer
said. "It wasjust a physically ill weekend [waiting
to meet with Susan]. I had to make sure I heard
her correctly when she told me she was coming
back. I was so excited."
After a stress reaction in her foot sidelined Bor
chardt for the first nine games of this season, she is
back in the Cardinal's starting lineup and ready for
a final run in the postseason.
After all the twists and turns, she'll be right in
the middle of it all. You'll see her.
