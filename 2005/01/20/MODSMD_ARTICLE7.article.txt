# Card's Grunfeld having a blast on and off the court
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Poring over the words on official Stanford letter
head three years ago, Dan Grunfeld was worried.
The Cardinal's junior shooting guard, a freshman
at the time, didn't know what to make of the shocking
letter hand-delivered to him by his concerned fresh
man dorm RA. Grunfeld, the letter indicated, was
suspected of cheating on an IHIJM final exam.
Ten minutes later, a smiling Matt Haryasz burst
into the room and broke the news to his friend and
teammate: the letter was a sham, authored as a cruel
prank by Haryasz and a friend.
"He got me so bad." Grunfeld said after practice
this week. "It was so official-looking, with a case num
ber and everything. I was pretty worried for 10 min
utes there; some expletives may have come out of my
mouth."
Three years later, it's opposing coaches preparing
for Stanford who are worried. Perhaps they are won
dering if Haryasz will burst into their office to an
nounce that Grunfeld's gaudy stat line (18.1 points
and 5.5 rebounds per game. 51 percent shooting) is.
like the letter, one big joke.
After all. this is the same guy who averaged 3.5
points per game his first two seasons at Stanford, the
same 6-foot-6 reserve who shot 36 percent from the

field in a limited role last year. Think Grunfeld has
done his part to make up for the loss of the team's top
three leading scorers? In his first year as a starter for
the Cardinal (8-7,2-3 Pacific-10 Conference), he is av
eraging 14.7 points per game more than last year, the
best one-year improvement among Division I players.
Grunfeld's 10-for-12, slashing, swishing, do-no
wrong 29-point performance in Stanford's upset of
Arizona two weeks ago earned him some rare nation
al attention, as "Sports Illustrated" dubbed him Play
er of the Week. Truth is, he has produced at a high
level all season, scoring in double figures in all but
two games, and his teammates aren't surprised.
"He's had an opportunity to shine," said junior
point guard and friend Jason Haas, who lived with
Grunfeld and Haryasz last year. "Now that he's had
his opportunity to play, he's proven what he has been
able to do all along."
"I knew Danny could be this kind of player ever
since I met him." Haryasz said. "He's got a great of
fensive game and he works really hard. I'm honestly
not surprised at all."
Least surprised is Grunfeld himself, who spent the
past two years backing up Matt Lottich after arriving
on the Farm as one of the most highly touted shooters
in the country.
"I think every basketball player has confidence in
their abilities, and at Stanford it's just a matter of op

portunity and learning the system, just biding your
time and being patient," Grunfeld said.
Off the court, things are same as they ever were for
Grunfeld. who is living with Haryasz for the second
consecutive year. Movies, parties, hanging out, a TV
rotation that includes 'The Surreal Life' and Real
World' — standard fare for the typical college stu
dent. And then there are the pranks.
"We've done a lot of dumb stuff together," Grun
feld said with a laugh.
Like the time he and Matt used rope to lock Jason
in the inner room while he was taking a nap, barricad
ing the first floor window with bicycles and boxes of
bottled water to prevent an easy escape.
"Danny's the type of guy you can always count on
to crack a joke: he's always making someone laugh."
said Haas, who, perhaps not surprisingly, opted to live
elsewhere this year. "He's very witty, he's very savvy
and he has a nice way with his words."
As a senior at Nicolet High School near Milwau
kee, Grunfeld averaged 23.9 points per game and
teamed up with point guard Tanner Bronson to form
a dominant backcourt duo. Bronson. whose love for
the game — and The Surreal Life 4 — rivals Dan's,
walked on at Wisconsin this season after spending last
year as the Badgers' team manager.
"Tanner was the greatest guy," said Grunfeld, rem
iniscing about the one-on-one games they would play

at Bronson's house in Milwaukee, where Dan's moth
er Nancy grew up and the Grunfelds still have a resi
dence. "He was a really smart, good player. He was
my hoy."
Dan, of course, is Ernie's boy. The elder Grunfeld
enjoyed a decorated college career at Tennessee he
fore playing for the Milwaukee Bucks, Kansas City
Kings and New York Knicks during his nine seasons
in the NBA. Grunfeld later worked in the New York
Knicks' front office for 17 years before he became
general manager of the Bucks in 1999. After four sea
sons in Milwaukee, he was named the President of
Basketball Operations for the NBA's Washington
Wizards in 2003.
A die-hard Knicks fan while growing up in New
Jersey, Dan has switched allegiances with every new
place he has called home. For now that's the D.C. sub
urb of Potomac, Md.. and Grunfeld beams when talk
ing about the upstart Wizards, an anomaly before his
dad arrived.
"They have the best backcourt in the East," Grun
feld said. "You've got guys like Gilbert [Arenas] and
Larry [Hughes] on the verge of really breaking out,
playing great. Things are coming together."
Sound familiar?
Buoyed by strong play from one of the Pac-10's
best backcourts, a modest two-game win streak has
put the Cardinal right back in the thick of a wide-open
conference race.
Grunfeld tries not to look too far ahead, relishing
every bit of his time at Stanford this year just as he did
for the previous two.
"You just have to try to make the most out of every
experience," Grunfeld said. "I think of my four years
in high school and three years at Stanford so far. and
I think there are a lot of good things to be drawn out
of all those years."
He pauses before adding:
"And a lot of that has come off the floor."

Wizards in 2003.
A die-hard Knicks fan while growing up in New
Jersey, Dan has switched allegiances with every new
place he has called home. For now that's the D.C. sub
urb of Potomac, Md.. and Grunfeld beams when talk
ing about the upstart Wizards, an anomaly before his
dad arrived.
"They have the best backcourt in the East," Grun
feld said. "You've got guys like Gilbert [Arenas] and
Larry [Hughes] on the verge of really breaking out,
playing great. Things are coming together."
Sound familiar?
Buoyed by strong play from one of the Pac-10's
best backcourts, a modest two-game win streak has
put the Cardinal right back in the thick of a wide-open
conference race.
Grunfeld tries not to look too far ahead, relishing
every bit of his time at Stanford this year just as he did
for the previous two.
"You just have to try to make the most out of every
experience," Grunfeld said. "I think of my four years
in high school and three years at Stanford so far. and
I think there are a lot of good things to be drawn out
of all those years."
He pauses before adding:
"And a lot of that has come off the floor."

In his first year as a starter, Stanford junior shooting guard Dan Grunfeld has averaged 18.1 points and 5.7 rebounds per game. When he's not playing basketball, Grun
feld enjoys kicking back with Cardinal teammate and roommate Matt Haryasz.


LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily
Grunfeld shot 10-for-1 2 from the field and scored a
career-high 29 points in the Cardinal's upset victory
over Arizona earlier this season.
Poring over the words on official Stanford letter
head three years ago, Dan Grunfeld was worried.
The Cardinal's junior shooting guard, a freshman
at the time, didn't know what to make of the shocking
letter hand-delivered to him by his concerned fresh
man dorm RA. Grunfeld, the letter indicated, was
suspected of cheating on an IHIJM final exam.
Ten minutes later, a smiling Matt Haryasz burst
into the room and broke the news to his friend and
teammate: the letter was a sham, authored as a cruel
prank by Haryasz and a friend.
"He got me so bad." Grunfeld said after practice
this week. "It was so official-looking, with a case num
ber and everything. I was pretty worried for 10 min
utes there; some expletives may have come out of my
mouth."
Three years later, it's opposing coaches preparing
for Stanford who are worried. Perhaps they are won
dering if Haryasz will burst into their office to an
nounce that Grunfeld's gaudy stat line (18.1 points
and 5.5 rebounds per game. 51 percent shooting) is.
like the letter, one big joke.
After all. this is the same guy who averaged 3.5
points per game his first two seasons at Stanford, the
same 6-foot-6 reserve who shot 36 percent from the

field in a limited role last year. Think Grunfeld has
done his part to make up for the loss of the team's top
three leading scorers? In his first year as a starter for
the Cardinal (8-7,2-3 Pacific-10 Conference), he is av
eraging 14.7 points per game more than last year, the
best one-year improvement among Division I players.
Grunfeld's 10-for-12, slashing, swishing, do-no
wrong 29-point performance in Stanford's upset of
Arizona two weeks ago earned him some rare nation
al attention, as "Sports Illustrated" dubbed him Play
er of the Week. Truth is, he has produced at a high
level all season, scoring in double figures in all but
two games, and his teammates aren't surprised.
"He's had an opportunity to shine," said junior
point guard and friend Jason Haas, who lived with
Grunfeld and Haryasz last year. "Now that he's had
his opportunity to play, he's proven what he has been
able to do all along."
"I knew Danny could be this kind of player ever
since I met him." Haryasz said. "He's got a great of
fensive game and he works really hard. I'm honestly
not surprised at all."
Least surprised is Grunfeld himself, who spent the
past two years backing up Matt Lottich after arriving
on the Farm as one of the most highly touted shooters
in the country.
"I think every basketball player has confidence in
their abilities, and at Stanford it's just a matter of op

portunity and learning the system, just biding your
time and being patient," Grunfeld said.
Off the court, things are same as they ever were for
Grunfeld. who is living with Haryasz for the second
consecutive year. Movies, parties, hanging out, a TV
rotation that includes 'The Surreal Life' and Real
World' — standard fare for the typical college stu
dent. And then there are the pranks.
"We've done a lot of dumb stuff together," Grun
feld said with a laugh.
Like the time he and Matt used rope to lock Jason
in the inner room while he was taking a nap, barricad
ing the first floor window with bicycles and boxes of
bottled water to prevent an easy escape.
"Danny's the type of guy you can always count on
to crack a joke: he's always making someone laugh."
said Haas, who, perhaps not surprisingly, opted to live
elsewhere this year. "He's very witty, he's very savvy
and he has a nice way with his words."
As a senior at Nicolet High School near Milwau
kee, Grunfeld averaged 23.9 points per game and
teamed up with point guard Tanner Bronson to form
a dominant backcourt duo. Bronson. whose love for
the game — and The Surreal Life 4 — rivals Dan's,
walked on at Wisconsin this season after spending last
year as the Badgers' team manager.
"Tanner was the greatest guy," said Grunfeld, rem
iniscing about the one-on-one games they would play

at Bronson's house in Milwaukee, where Dan's moth
er Nancy grew up and the Grunfelds still have a resi
dence. "He was a really smart, good player. He was
my hoy."
Dan, of course, is Ernie's boy. The elder Grunfeld
enjoyed a decorated college career at Tennessee he
fore playing for the Milwaukee Bucks, Kansas City
Kings and New York Knicks during his nine seasons
in the NBA. Grunfeld later worked in the New York
Knicks' front office for 17 years before he became
general manager of the Bucks in 1999. After four sea
sons in Milwaukee, he was named the President of
Basketball Operations for the NBA's Washington
Wizards in 2003.
