### GERRY SHIH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Larry Everest, author of "Oil, Power & Empire: Iraq
and the U.S. Global Agenda," will speak tonight about
President George W. Bush's domestic and foreign poli
cies, including the roots of the war in Iraq.
The event, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. in building 320.
kicks off a four-week-long Iraq Film Festival sponsored
by the Coalition for Justice in the Middle East and the
Muslim Students Awareness Network. The film festival
will show two movies each week, on Thursdays and Sun
days at 7:30 p.m.
Sophomore Omar Shakir. president of MSAN, said
his organization and CJME had been planning the film
festival since last spring.
"Both organizations feel it's important to give people
some perspective of what's going on in Iraq other than
what you see on American news," Shakir said.
CJME vice president Olivia Sohns, a sophomore,
pointed out that the film festival is also relevant to cur
rent events.
"The festival coincides with the Iraqi Elections, and it
reveals the truth of the situation in Iraq, which is some
thing that we have to seek out for ourselves to be good
citizens," Sohns said.
Sohns said that the two movies each week will corre
spond to the weekly theme. Week one will be themed
"War and Occupation," week two "People and Culture,"
week three "Humanitarian Crisis," and week four
"Media and Deception."
"We chose each film because they were fascinating
and eye-opening," Sohns said. ' These are films we had to
special order, and they are documentaries and other
films that you will not see anywhere else."
In addition to the movie screenings, there will be pre
sentations by noted authors, professors and directors.
Guest speakers will include Everest, filmmaker Adam
Shapiro and As'ad Abu-Khalil, an author and professor
at Cal State-Stanislaus.
Everest, an outspoken activist, will most likely deliv
er a message critical of U.S. policies in Iraq. But Shakir
said the film festival as a whole is not meant to have any
political leaning.
"We don't have an agenda," Shakir said. "The movies
are very diverse, and a lot of what we show is in fact about
the brutal regime of Saddam [Hussein j. We leave it up to
the audience."
Shakir said the goal of the festival "is just to show peo
ple what's going on from the perspective of people who
have been in Iraq."
In fact, Shakir hopes Shapiro will not only bring his
film to the festival, but also deliver his message and ex
periences in person. Shapiro, the director of the docu
mentary "About Baghdad." will introduce his work and
watch the film with the audience on Jan. 29.
Before going to Baghdad for his documentary, he
worked in Ramallah, where he administered aid to Pales
tinians trapped in Yasir Arafat's compound during the
Israeli shelling in 2002.
Shapiro shifted his attention to Baghdad at the onset
of the 2003 war in Iraq: he will share his experiences at
the festival.
"We're looking for every single side of what's hap
pening in Iraq." Shakir said. "We want both the enter
taining and the enlightening. Every film has something
unique to tell the audience."
