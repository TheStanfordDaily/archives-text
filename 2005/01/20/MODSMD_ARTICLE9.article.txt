# Students rally, protest inauguration
## 
### BEA SANFORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the two weeks leading up to
President George W. Bush's second in
auguration today, progressive groups at
Stanford have been busy planning a
protest called "Stand Up For Change"
to be held on the same day. Flyers pro
moting the rally urge students to not let
"four more years go by without the rep
resentation you deserve."
Sophomore Samantha Staley, who
led the planning committee for the rally
and is a member of Students fora Sus
tainable Stanford, said that it is intend
ed "to be re-energizing for the people
who are already in student groups,
[and]... to get students aware of these

groups, so that they can potentially join
them."
The rally will consist of a walk-out,
teach-ins, and speeches by student
group representatives and Larry Ever
est, the author of "Oil. Power, & Em
pire: Iraq & the U.S. Global Agenda."
At 11:40 a.m. students will walk out of
classes and march to White Plaza to
gether for the hour-long protest.
"We're asking each group to have a
form of action at their table, whether
it's a pledge, or a letter-writing cam
paign," said Staley, explaining that rally
organizers wanted to emphasize local
action.
While similar rallies are being held
at different places across the country,
Staley called Stanford's event "more

unique, in that we're being positive.
We're not bashing Bush, and we're not
contesting election results."
It took progressive groups a while to
unite around a positive message, said
senior Noami Ullian, who also helped
plan the rally. Initially the event was
going to be called "Never Surrender:
Fight the Right" but the planning com
mittee re-named the rally because some
groups had problems with the mili
tarism of the slogan. Staley said.
"Basically I think that the current
administration is really connected with
militarism and force," said Ullian.
"This idea of aggressive invasion turns
a lot of progressive groups off." Most
groups were pleased with the more pos
itive "Stand Up For Change" title, said

Staley.
Sophomore Marie Jonas, president
of the Stanford Democrats, said that
the differences among groups hadn't
really caused much trouble. Initially
"(the Stanford Democrats) were plan
ning the rally but eventually [other
groups] just coordinated." Jonas said.
Although the Democratic slogan
"Fight the Right" was stripped from the
rally's title, Jonas said she didn't feel
she had to "water anything down."
Student groups participating include
Students for Environmental Action at

Peace and Justice. Stanford Coalition
for Investment Disclosure. Stanford
