# Campus protests mark Bush inauguration

### BEA SANFORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While President George W. Bush
praised freedom and democracy at his sec
ond inauguration in Washington D.C.,
some Stanford students were exercising
their own freedom in demonstrating
against him.
At 11:40 a.m., about 30 students walked
out of their classes, convened at the Histo
ry Corner and marched to White Plaza for
a rally called "Stand Up For Change."
The focal point of the rally was a 10-
minute speech by Larry Everest, author of
"Oil, Power & Empire: Iraq & the U.S.
Global Agenda."
"Today, moments after Bush was inau
gurated, he declared war on us," Everest
said.
Everest described Bush's $40 million
inauguration as "a coronation of war.
greed and intolerance."

Some passersby felt Everest's rhetoric
was too strong.
"He's sort of on the extreme," said se
nior Jessica Park. "That's kind of alienat
ing."
History of Modern Philosophy Prof.
Allen Wood also spoke at the rally, with a
note of disillusionment, on perceived elec
tion failures.
"We know they stole the election in
2000 in Florida, and whether or not they
stole this election in Ohio they don't want
us to know."
Wood acknowledged that "Stand Up
for Change" — and similar rallies across
the country — would he overshadowed by
the inauguration.
He quoted former President Abraham
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address in saying,
"The world will little note nor long re
member what we say here."
On the grassy spot near The Claw, a
group called the Neo Con Artists drew at

tention to possible vote fraud in the 2004
presidential election.
One of the "artists," donning a royal
costume and face mask of Bush, offered
bystanders a chance to "have their picture
taken with King George." The group's
chart of potential poses included one
called "regicide," which depicted someone
slaying a king.
At the rally, a "New Term Resolutions"
table invited people to voice their plans for
political action. One person wrote, "1 will
fight to support recognition of the differ
ence between charity and justice." Anoth
er simply scrawled, "Damn the Man."
Sophomore and Stanford Democrat
Paco Torres, who helped organize the
event, said he was happy with the turnout.
Many of the 30 students who participat
ed in the walk-out wore orange bands on
their arms or duct tape over their mouths.
"The orange bands signify solidarity to
not be afraid, to wear it on your sleeve

quite literally," said junior Francisco Cen
dejas, a participant in the march.
While many passersby appeared sup
portive or neutral toward the rally, there
were some dissenters.
"I have a father in the military," said
sophomore Milton Solorzano. "When I
see protesters protesting, partly the admin
istration, hut also I think the election re
sults, 1 think, sometimes you just have to
move on."
Solorzano went on to say that he felt it
is "important for conservative students to
know that there are people who disagree
with the standard liberal Stanford stu
dent."
Solorzano said he believes that conser
vative students experience "intellectual
persecution" at Stanford.
"In classes, when a professor makes a
Bush-bashing comment and everyone gig
gles, it's intimidating."
