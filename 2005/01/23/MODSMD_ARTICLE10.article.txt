## 
### JESSICA ZHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
What do President George W.
Bush and Sauron from"The Lord of
the Rings" have in common? Ac
cording to Larry Everest, the open
ing speaker at last night's Iraq Film
Festival, both are trying to take over
the world.
Everest, author of "Oil, Power,
and Empire: Iraq and the U.S. Glob
al Agenda," discussed the potential
consequences of Bush's second term
in office. The event was co-spon
sored by the Coalition for Justice in
the Middle East and the Muslim Stu
dents Awareness Network.

"I think we have to confront the
enormity of the moment," Everest
said. "Now. liberating a country
means colonizing it. Freedom means
the freedom of the U.S. to rule the
world, means the freedom of U.S.
corporations to have access to re
sources of the entire planet and free
dom of extreme right to rule over the
nation."
Everest indicated that he believes
the Bush administration is moving
away from progressive and inclusive
ideals.
"This society is increasingly di
verse in terms of country of origin,
ethnicity, sexual orientation, cultural
orientation and political orienta

tion," Everest said. "But the rulers of
this country are fearful that this di
versity will undermine what their
power rests upon: white supremacy,
male supremacy and right-or-wrong
patriotism."
He claimed that Bush's second
term domestic policy, including so
cial security and tax reforms, will
have the effect of consolidating
power and money into fewer hands.
"People are right to feel power
less now. The channels of establish
ment and the channels of political
dissent have been exhausted and the
system has basically ignored them,"
he said. "The Democrats aren't even
pretending to be an opposition party

anymore.
However, Everest said he be
lieved the Bush administration is
also "extremely vulnerable" politi
cally.
" They do not have control of the
universe and we only have to look at
Iraq to understand that and what
they're doing is in the very opposite
interest of people in this country and
around the world."
Everest concluded his short
speech with the comparison between
Bush and Sauron. "Here's to us
being the Frodos of the world."
Everest said, as applause broke from
the audience.
