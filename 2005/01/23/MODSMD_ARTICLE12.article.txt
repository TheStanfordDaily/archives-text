Why does Stanford contin
ue to allow people to get
up on the stage preced
ing Flicks and embarrass
the hell out of themselves?
We understand why athletic teams
make their freshmen get up there:
hazing. (Note: to our knowledge, ath
letic teams neither engage in nor con
done hazing in any way, shape or
form. They don't drink either.)
But what would possess someone
on the Viennese Ball Committee to
parade themselves uncomfortably
along in front of drunk freshmen who
come there with the sole purpose of
throwing paper and yelling obsceni
ties at anything that moves?
We didn't even have the heart to
boo, but it

did get us
thinking:
Stanford
kids will do
anything to
make it a
University
requirement
that they ask
someone
out.
What are
we talking
about?
Fo r ma Is.
They're

everywhere.
Perhaps the best-known are Greek
formals. On the upside, they're free if
you're not in the organization. On the
downside, you have to dress up, walk
to a bus, get on it and ride fora while.
And if your date's a real asshole, you
might even have to pay for booze
once you get there.
Fun once, but after that you real
ize you can get blackout drunk just
sitting in your room wearing sweat
pants. Same payoff, way less effort,
and your chances of witnessing a
bus seat blow job drastically
decrease.
The athlete crowd has its own little
hoe-downs, too. It's generally an
attractive though sometimes obscene
ly tall crowd. The numbers are typi
cally pretty slim because athlete's
don't get out so much (they, for the
most part, stick to Mirrielees, the
approved athlete list of classes,
Arrillaga and...Mirrielees).
Plus, it's pretty fun to watch huge
muscle-y people get themselves balls
to-the-wall wasted. When a line
backer falls, two to three coxswains
can be caught under his neck alone.
Then there are those dances
thrown by each class. Do people go to
these things? No. really, we think
there might have been one last night.
We vaguely remember an e-mail. Did
anyone actually pay to go?
Supposedly they have them at coun
try clubs or something. Get Muffy
and bring the Scotch!
Lastly there are the dorm-sanc
tioned ones. Special Dinner, dorm
dances. Screw Your Roommate —
Excuses to bone, excuses to bone,
excuses to bone someone you don't
know.
But seriously, you live with these
people. Why dress up? They see you
early in the morning, late at night,
they watch your feet while you poop .
.. in short, one night of strappy black
ness isn't going to erase that stench
that inexplicably followed you
through finals.
We're not saying we never go to
these, or that they're not occasionally
a means of entertainment. But we are
saying that you are a ginormous loser
if you're waiting for Groundhog Day
Formal to ask out that hotty program
mer across the hall (hah. "hotty pro
grammer" — it's called poetic
license).
We just wanted to bring it to your
attention that if you would like to
take someone out fora malted milk
shake, all you need do is pluck up
your courage and ask — no Sock Hop
required.
Oh. and also that the people who
get onstage at Flicks should be taken
out back and shot, or at least
acquainted with their drastic misper
ception of what constitutes "some
thing neat and special to view before
a film."

After-thingy: Are you a linebacker who
wants to squish a coxswain for our
amusement? E-mail us at mhstone
