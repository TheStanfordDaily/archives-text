# Research camp for professors
## No students, no classrooms and until recently no telephones. Tucked away in Stanford's hills, professors from around the world take a year to do research, without interruptions. 
### KATIE BEARMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Every year, between 35 and 45 profes
sors from national and international uni
versities take a "break" from their teaching
duties — most are officially on sabbatical
— to convene fora year of grueling
research at the Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences. Nestled in the
foothills near the Stanford Golf Course, the
Center is visible from some parts of cam
pus. The Center, however, leases this land
from Stanford and is not directly associated
with the University.
Founded in 1954, the Center is consid
ered a haven in which Fellows can dedicate
every last drop of their energy to a research
project. The Center boasts an atmosphere
with little to no interruptions.
"So great is the respect for people's
intellectual pursuits that the Center only
recently put telephones in Fellows' offices,"
said Communication Prof. James Fishkin,
who was given two fellowships at the
Center.
Although many of the Fellows enjoy
working as professors, they appreciate the
chance to diligently concentrate on cutting
edge research while at CASBS.
"I'm afraid that one of the attractions of
the Center is that one can focus entirely on
one's own work," said Robert O. Keohane,
a current Fellow at the Center who hails
from Duke University. "1 love teaching —
but 1 cherish this year away from it."
In addition to creating an environment
that facilitates extreme concentration, the
Center makes resources such as the
Stanford libraries and two full-time librari
ans available to the Fellows.
"If you want to be in a place where they
do everything possible to make your
research go without a hitch, it would be
here," said Meg Conkey. a Fellow from the
University of California-Berkeley who is
researching feminist and indigenous
archaeologies.
"People get more done here than at
their home institutions." Fishkin said.
The Fellows at the Center are, indeed,
prolific intellectuals. Much of the research
done at the Center is published, respected
within the academic community and well
known by the public. Some Fellows have

gone on to win Nobel Prizes, the Pulitzer
Prize or other distinguished awards.
For the most part, the research done at
the Center is in the social sciences.There is
also work done in mathematics, the human
ities and human biology. No matter the
field in which they are immersed, the
Fellows share a general goal.
"The Center is dedicated to advancing
knowledge about human behavior through
research," 1 said Cynthia Brandt, Associate
Director of CASBS.
Deliberative polling, for instance — the
brainchild of Fishkin — aims to uncover

how public opinion about elections, the
allocation of tax dollars and other social
concerns would differ if citizens had more
information at their disposal.
Fishkin's research was so influential that
he was invited to return as a Fellow and
construct a team to further develop the
project. To date, deliberative polling has
been applied to an array of pressing issues
.such as changing U.S. presidential primary
processes and debating renewable energy
research in Texas.

Keohane. who also participated in two
fellowships at the Center, experienced sim
ilar success.
"In my first year at the Center, in 1977-
78, I was just beginning to think about
issues that led to my 1984 book. 'After
Hegemony: Cooperation and Discord in
the World Political Economy,"' Keohane
said.
In 1989, his book won the University of
Louisville Grawemeyer Award, which rec
ognizes individuals and teams from all over
the world for their innovative ideas.
Keohane is currently serving as a Fellow

fora second time at the Center, researching
with Peter Katzenstein of Cornell
University. They are examining the origins
and ramifications of various forms of anti-
Americanism.
So how do professors such as Fishkin,
Keohane and Conkey end up at the
Center? Rather than apply for the posi
tions, they are invited to serve as Fellows
after being nominated for remarkable tal
ent and reviewed by panels of experts in
the global academic community.

While some of the Fellows each year are
Stanford professors, approximately 90 per
cent come from other institutions.
According to Conkey, the Center works
tirelessly to ensure that the professors from
outside the Palo Alto area feel comfortable
in their new surroundings.
The Center helps the Fellows find hous
es to rent and provides them with a
resource guide suggesting restaurants,
museums and theaters to visit. The Center
organizes dinners, wine tastings and even
athletic competitions among the Fellows.
Additionally, the Center pays the
Fellows the equivalent of a semester's
salary to compensate for the time they take
off from their careers as professors. To do
so, the Center uses funds provided by insti
tutions such as the William and Flora
Hewlett Foundation and the John D. and
Catherine T. Mac Arthur Foundation and
by individual donors. The Fellows' home
institutions generally provide pay for the
other semester.
Another perk of the Center is the
Fellows' chance to learn from each other
while there. Every Fellow makes one pres
entation of his or her research during the
year. The opportunity to attend these talks
and the ability to interact daily with col
leagues pursuing assorted interests are
opportunities that the Fellows said they
treasure.
"The diversity of disciplines is fantastic
at the Center, and they do everything they
can to make a community of scholars,"
Conkey said.
The Center is also extremely valuable
for Stanford because often. Fellows from
elsewhere end up staying at Stanford as
professors after their year of research.
"[The Center) is the secret of Stanford's
recruiting success," Fishkin said. "It makes
it easier for Stanford to attract professors
who wouldn't otherwise have come."
Much like Stanford students, the
Fellows at the Center are surrounded not
only by a vigorous academic atmosphere
but also by interesting and motivated peers,
a wealth of tremendous opportunities and
beautiful landscapes that can be refreshing
in the midst of a frustrating day.
"We all have up here a marvelous
resource that should be protected and sup
ported," Keohane said.
