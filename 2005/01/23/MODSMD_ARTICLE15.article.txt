# NAACP funds Sudan conference
## 
### XIN XIE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Five Stanford students will join undergraduates
from universities across the country next month to
discuss current affairs in Sudan.
The National Student Conference on Sudan,
sponsored by the United States Holocaust
Memorial Museum Committee on Conscience,
aims to educate undergraduates on the crisis in
Darfur. Sophomores Desiree Cormier, Kirstin
Conti and Nikki Serapio, juniors Chris Hartfield
and senior Mabrookah Heneidi will attend the
conference at Georgetown University in February.
"By attending the conference, we hope to gain
a better understanding of what is going on,"
Cormier said. "As we gain a broader perspective
about the current situation, we hope to put some
pressure on the administration to deal with the
problem."
Out of 17 applicants, the five were chosen by
the Stanford chapter of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
"Although we know what is out there in the
media, we want to gain a more objective view than
that through the media lens," Conti said. "This
knowledge will help us alleviate the social issues
and proceed towards justice."
Cormier explained that upon finding out about
the trip, she thought it interesting and worthwhile.
But she did not want to deal with travel arrange
ments.
The NAACP, of which Cormier is the Political
Activities Chair, decided to fund the travel
expenses for all five students. Because the confer
ence deals with an important human rights issue,
the NAACP believed it important that they enable
the students to participate.
"The fact that the NAACP funded this trip for
us shows that it embraces diversity and is not
pigeonholed at all," Cormier said. "The organiza
tion docs not only care about African American
issues, but rather, all civil and human rights issues."
Cormier added that the other four students are
not even NAACP members, and not all the stu
dents attending the trip are African American.
Upon returning from the trip, the students will
present a program on their findings to the
Stanford community at large.
"Everyone attending the conference had to
submit a proposal, explaining a program by which

he or she would spread knowledge about Darfur,"
Cormier said.
According to Cormier, these programs spanned
the gamut. One student wished to bring in actual
people affected by genocide so they could talk
about their experiences, while others proposed
documentaries or rallies in White Plaza.
"One program I proposed allows students to
buy wristbands, all the proceeds going directly
towards Darfur," Conti said. "1 also thought about
having a panel to educate students, as well as a
program that allows students to call local officials
in White Plaza."
The participants said they hope that their
efforts will spread awareness and motivate people
to act.
"Quite often, it seems that even though we
learn about a situation, our knowledge does not
translate into meaningful action," Cormier said.
"By educating ourselves, we can hopefully become
part of the solution."
"Since donations are usually filtered by NGOs
and other people, we need to find the most effi
cient system to help the victims," Conti said.
"We are not only concerned about the problem
in Darfur," Conti added. "We also want to learn
how to deal with genocide around the world and
make sure people do not turn their backs on such
a pressing problem."
