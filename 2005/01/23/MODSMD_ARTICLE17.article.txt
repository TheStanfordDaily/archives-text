## Editorial Honors programs needs more oversight 
### 
Academic honors at a school like Stanford
is one of the few undergraduate achieve
ments that may make a difference in
graduate life years from now.
However, the guidelines for honors within the
majors are too general and inconsistent, and un
fairly bestow honors on some students at the ex
pense of others who might be more deserving.
To make the award more meaningful and the
process more fair, the University should oversee

The administration should more carefully over
see the requirements and the honors selection pro
cess. This would help ensure that recieving the
honors distinction truly means that students have
achieved excellence in advanced research.
Attaining honors at Stanford is a great achieve

the necessary guidelines to ensure that every un

distinction, and that the honor is equally meaning
ful regardless of a student's field.
