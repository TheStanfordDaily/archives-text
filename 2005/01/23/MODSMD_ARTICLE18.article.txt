# The

## 'Protests' rebuttal misses point 
### WILL NELSON 
My column last week ("Anti
war protests are an ineffective and
unconstructive way of making
change," Jan. 14) seems to have
provoked responses out of some
Daily readers. In particular, Brian
Colweil's recent op-ed ("Public
protest is an effective way of voic
ing minority perspectives," Jan.
18) attacked a caricature of the
opinions I expressed.
My article criticized the rhetoric
and tactics of activists protesting
Bush's second inauguration as in
effective and counterproductive.
The piece argued that some of the
more extreme rhetoric popular
among many contemporary
protestors does not further the na
tion's overall political dialogue.
Colwell accuses me, an aspiring
sociologist, of "professional fail
ure" for not acknowledging the
"sociological importance" of
protests in stimulating public dis
cussion. I surely do recognize that
protests can stimulate public dis
course, and my article clearly ac
knowledged that protest move
ments have sometimes generated
enormously positive social change.
Public discussion is inspired by
many activities and events, includ
ing mass protests. But some activi
ties and protests, in my opinion, in
spire better and more fruitful polit
ical discourse than others.
I believe that the rhetoric of
many anti-war protestors just
doesn't help, and it is just not per
suasive to most Americans and pos
sibly causes a backlash among them.

Most Bush supporters are not
corporate CEO tycoons or reli
gious lunatics. Like many who hate
Bush, his supporters are reason
able, persuadable Americans con
cerned about our shared national
future in these deeply troubling
times.
Colwell acknowledges my point
that successful protest movements
generally require a large persuad
able public. But he ridicules my as
sertion that protestors are wasting
time in reiterating the same argu
ments that most Americans have
already heard and rejected.
He declares, "We are all poten
tially persuadable." So go ahead
and protest; it'll work eventually.
Sure, we are all persuadable to
some extent on a huge variety of
topics. But I don't think I'd be risk
ing my academic career by assert
ing that a position's persuasiveness
depends greatly on the position,
how it's framed and who the audi
ence is.
What are the chances that
someday the American people
magically will be convinced that
the Iraq war was never about any
thing but oil and Halliburton prof
its? What are the chances that
Americans will one day believe
that Bush is really the world's
worst terrorist? Likely? Possible?
Don't hold your breath.
Much of the passion evident in
Colweil's piece seems to flow from
his veneration of the institution of
public demonstration. He holds up
acts of protest as unchallengeable
symbols of America that are "den
igrated" when people like me

choose to question demonstrators'
rhetoric and tactics.
I, too, deeply cherish the right
to assemble, speak freely and
demonstrate publicly. I would hate
to imagine circumstances in which
these freedoms were abridged in
significant ways in our nation. I
could not call such a country
"America."
But that does not mean 1 cannot
challenge protestors' tactics and
rhetoric. That does not mean 1
should sit quietly while left-wing
rhetoric spins out of control in
ways I think are unhelpful.
Colwell questions my motives
in writing about protests by asking
whether it is an "accident" that my
column appeared days before the
inauguration. I don't recall receiv
ing a Suppress the Dissenters Flash
Alert from the Bush people last
week ordering me to wield my con
siderable powers as a Daily colum
nist to discourage those pesky dis
senters.
1 needed no orders from W. to
encourage me to express my views.
I am a big fan of political dialogue,
persuasion and dissent.
I particularly appreciate well
intentioned. valid and constructive
dissent attempting to bridge politi
cal divides. That is exactly what I
intended my column last week to
be.
