Unprotected oral sex not as risky
as unsafe intercourse
"In terms of STD risks, oral sex
is about as dangerous as sexual in
tercourse without a condom," says
health columnist Lauren Gong,
seemingly reporting from the
SHPRC at Vaden. She clearly must
have misheard.
A quick Google search on four
major STDs shows rather definitive
ly the opposite: that transmission of
HIV, HPV, chlamydia, and gonor
rhea are less likely (in some cases,
much less likely) to be transferred
through oral sex than through sexu
al intercourse without a condom.
From my very quick research:
"It is possible to get infected with
HIV through oral sex. The risk is
not zero. .. The risk of HIV infec

tion through oral sex is extremely
low. It is much lower than for other
types of unprotected sexual activi
ty" (http://www.aids.org/Fact-
Sheets/152-How-Risky-Is-It.html).
Or. "HPV is transmitted sexual
ly through intimate genital to geni
tal contact, including vaginal or
anal intercourse, or only rarely
through oral sex," (http://www.in
diana.edu/~health/hpv.html).
And again, "[Chlamydial is less
likely, although possible, to he
transmitted to the throat during
oral sex."
(http://www.dph.sf.ca.us/sfcityclin
ic/stdbasics/chlamydia.asp).
And, finally, "Oral sex is proba
bly the least common mode of
transmission (for gonorrheal,"
(http://www.urologychannel.com/s
td/gonorrhea.shtml).

The exception seems to be
syphilis, which does actually have
high transmission rates through
oral sex: "The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention report
shows that a substantial proportion
of syphilis cases occurred through
unprotected oral sex,"
(http://my.webmd.com/content/ar

LIC).
While 1 think very highly of the
SHPRC and its stall. ;is well as
Daily reporters, I can't help but
wonder how this one slipped
through. STDs are a huge problem
in our society, and on campus, but
please â€” skip the hyperbole, and
give us the facts.
