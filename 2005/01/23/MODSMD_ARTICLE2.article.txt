## 
### JENNY BAER 
The organizers of the ninth annu
al Asian American Issues Confer
ence, which takes place tomorrow,
are confident that this year's event
will appeal to more Stanford stu
dents than in the past.
In previous years, the conference
has received from 300 to 400 visitors,
mostly consisting of non-Stanford
college students. The conference
draws college students mostly from
Nevada, Berkeley and Southern
California, as well as some high
school groups and older community
members.
However, this year conference
organizers Jennifer Chen and Jimmy
Lu. both seniors and co-chairs of the
Asian American Students' Associa
tion, plan to net more Stanford stu

dents by emphasizing discussion of
relevant topics like immigration and
police brutality. The conference con
sists of a keynote speaker as well as
three workshop periods, a food fair
and a concert.
Not only will it be more discus
sion-based than in previous years,
but the goal is to "have a lot more
Stanford students involved," accord
ing Chen, whose organization is
sponsoring the conference.
The conference takes place from
9:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. tomorrow.
Asian-American spoken word
artists Kiwi. Bambu, Kontrast and
music group from University of Cal
ifornia, Berkeley called Theatre
Rice are scheduled to perform at the
evening concert.
The conference was first started
to bring awareness to "the silent but

salient issues" that affect the Asian-
American community, according to
Lu. Its aim is to provoke thought
about subjects ranging from worker
compensation rights and campus di
versity.
Political activist Bob Wing will
serve as this year's keynote speaker.
Wing has written extensively on is
sues like racial justice and nuclear
disarmament. He is also editor of
the War Times, a national newspa
per devoted to peace and justice.
The newspaper, like Wing, is op
posed to the war on terror, and
Wing also serves as the co-chair for
the anti-war coalition United Peace
and Justice.
In an attempt to involve more
Stanford students in the confer
ence, student groups will be host
ing some of the workshops. The

Stanford Vietnamese Student As
sociation is presenting a workshop
entitled "Agent Orange." The
Pilipino American Student Union
will be holding a workshop on
toxic waste, and Sanskriti will be
presenting on South Asian issues.
Other workshops will discuss glob
alization. queer issues, immigra
tion, Asian Americans in electoral
politics, domestic violence, Asian
Americans in performing arts,
worker justice and student orga
nizing.
While Chen stresses the impor
tance of networking and getting to
know students from other schools,
Lu said the purpose of the confer
ence is simply for community mem
bers to get exposure and meet each
other and to create more of a "com
munity feeling."
