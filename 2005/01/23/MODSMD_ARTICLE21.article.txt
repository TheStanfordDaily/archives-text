# Irrational Exuberance
## Intolerable Intolerance 
### 
The level of intolerance at Stan
ford appalls me. I should be more
specific. Today, the first full day of
President George W. Bush's sec
ond term, I find it is time to come
clean: I voted for Bush. I meant to
write this earlier, but feared I
would lose my readers.
With just a few weeks left as a
columnist, like a second-term pres
ident. I now have nothing to lose.
Although I am a thick-skinned
person, there were times this past
year when I felt very uncomfort
able revealing who I planned to

vote for. The
level of vitriol
and disdain di
rected at the
president, and
often at support
ers of the presi
dent, was hurtful
and small-mind
ed.
I voted for
Bush not for any

deep convictions
that he was the better candidate; I
don't consider myself a Republi
can, and I liked Kerry.
Ironically, 1 probably liked
Kerry more than many of his own
supporters.
I could say I voted for Bush be
cause of his policies on issues like
immigration and education. From
his experience as governor of
Texas, Bush pushed hard early on
to normalize immigration from
Mexico, but this was derailed by /
11. In the past month, these efforts
have begun again.
Bush has also demonstrated his
continued commitment to educa
tion reform. When Kerry attempt
ed to suggest reforms, the teachers'
unions quickly forced him to re
tract his proposals. 1 believe that
education is the key to solving
many of America's most in
tractable problems, from poverty
and inequality to better gover
nance.
I could say I voted for Bush be
cause. although 1 disagree with
many of his positions on social is
sues, I think their impact will be
smaller than what Democratic
scare tactics may suggest. The new
head of the Senate committee
overseeing judicial appointments,
Arlen Specter, is pro-choice, as is
Alberto Gonzales, Bush's new at
torney general.
Notably, Bush's new cabinet is
looking to be the most diverse in
U.S. history (the second niAst di
verse was Bush's first-term cabinet).
I could say I voted for Bush to
support the Republican party that
has a record of supporting free trade,
a philosophy that cherishes the po
tential of individuals, and a convic
tion that is unafraid to say America
on net is a force for good. The Re
publican Party today represents dy
namism and change, whether in pur
suing democracy overseas or eco
nomic growth at home.
These reasons alone, however,
were not enough for me to favor
Bush, as there were also many rea
sons to favor Kerry. As I stated in
an earlier column. I do not think I.

nor most people, are qualified to
judge the nuanced ramifications of
choosing either candidate for pres
ident.
Thus, the main reason I voted
for Bush is to be able to say things
like: It is a sad state of affairs at
Stanford that the only other gradu
ate student I know who voted for
Bush was a lifelong Democrat who
spent the last year doing research
in Iraq.
By voting for Bush, I hope to be
able to provoke thought and intro
spection in the people who will un
doubtedly be the future leaders of
the world.
Shortly after the election,
Thomas Friedman of The New
York Times essentially wrote that
he thought all the people who
voted for Bush were un-American.
I feel similar sentiments from
many at Stanford. Economist Dan
Klein finds that among college hu
manities and social science faculty.
Democrats outnumber Republi
cans seven to one. Among such
young faculty at Stanford and
Berkeley, the ratio is 30 to 1.
There were times during the
past campaign when I honestly felt
my view that Bush was not the anti-
Christ would cast me as an outsider
amongst people I had considered
friends. There was a widely held
assumption that everyone in the
room must think it is patently self
evident that Bush is incredibly
stupid and hopelessly evil.
Are these people so illiberal
and self-righteous that they cannot
understand why a reasonable per
son would vote for Bush; that it is
possible that the vote could be
based simply on differences in
opinion rather than differences in
underlying values?
What is especially notable is
that this divisiveness is not univer
sal. but really only restricted to the
cultural elite. Stanford Prof. Mor
ris Fiorina, the only academic I
know to have weighed in on this,
finds that Americans hold a wide
range of nuanced views.
The red-blue divide is largely
media hype, magnifying small dif
ferences. A good example is abor
tion, where, given six scenarios.
Democrats and Republicans are
largely in agreement on which
cases abortion should be allowed.
I heard a Daily staff writer say
that he felt he was Cassandra; Only
he knew the truth, and all those
who voted for Bush were dooming
the United States to the fate of
Troy. 1 am not saying 1 know the
truth. 1 am only urging everybody
to show a little humility.
Universities are a place for dis
course and dialogue. Only if theses
are challenged by their anti-theses
can progress be made. I write this as
a plea to recognize the positives of a
Bush second term, to see the world
not in black and white, to be toler
ant of diverse views and opinions,
and to not assume that your world
view is the only valid one.

There were times during the
past campaign when I honestly felt
my view that Bush was not the anti-
Christ would cast me as an outsider
amongst people I had considered
friends. There was a widely held
assumption that everyone in the
room must think it is patently self
evident that Bush is incredibly
stupid and hopelessly evil.
Are these people so illiberal
and self-righteous that they cannot
understand why a reasonable per
son would vote for Bush; that it is
possible that the vote could be
based simply on differences in
opinion rather than differences in
underlying values?
What is especially notable is
that this divisiveness is not univer

cultural elite. Stanford Prof. Mor

finds that Americans hold a wide

The red-blue divide is largely
media hype, magnifying small dif

Democrats and Republicans are
largely in agreement on which
cases abortion should be allowed.
I heard a Daily staff writer say
that he felt he was Cassandra; Only
he knew the truth, and all those
who voted for Bush were dooming
the United States to the fate of
Troy. 1 am not saying 1 know the
truth. 1 am only urging everybody
to show a little humility.
Universities are a place for dis
course and dialogue. Only if theses
are challenged by their anti-theses

a plea to recognize the positives of a
Bush second term, to see the world
not in black and white, to be toler
ant of diverse views and opinions,
and to not assume that your world
view is the only valid one.

The level of intolerance at Stan
ford appalls me. I should be more
specific. Today, the first full day of
President George W. Bush's sec
ond term, I find it is time to come
clean: I voted for Bush. I meant to
write this earlier, but feared I
would lose my readers.
With just a few weeks left as a
columnist, like a second-term pres
ident. I now have nothing to lose.
Although I am a thick-skinned
person, there were times this past
year when I felt very uncomfort
able revealing who I planned to

vote for. The
level of vitriol
and disdain di
rected at the
president, and
often at support
ers of the presi
dent, was hurtful
and small-mind
ed.
I voted for
Bush not for any

deep convictions
that he was the better candidate; I
don't consider myself a Republi
can, and I liked Kerry.
Ironically, 1 probably liked
Kerry more than many of his own
supporters.
I could say I voted for Bush be
cause of his policies on issues like
immigration and education. From
his experience as governor of
Texas, Bush pushed hard early on
to normalize immigration from
Mexico, but this was derailed by /
11. In the past month, these efforts
have begun again.
Bush has also demonstrated his
continued commitment to educa
tion reform. When Kerry attempt
ed to suggest reforms, the teachers'
unions quickly forced him to re
tract his proposals. 1 believe that
education is the key to solving
many of America's most in
tractable problems, from poverty
and inequality to better gover
nance.
I could say I voted for Bush be
cause. although 1 disagree with
many of his positions on social is
sues, I think their impact will be
smaller than what Democratic
scare tactics may suggest. The new
head of the Senate committee
overseeing judicial appointments,
Arlen Specter, is pro-choice, as is
Alberto Gonzales, Bush's new at
torney general.
Notably, Bush's new cabinet is
looking to be the most diverse in
U.S. history (the second niAst di
verse was Bush's first-term cabinet).
I could say I voted for Bush to
support the Republican party that
has a record of supporting free trade,
a philosophy that cherishes the po
tential of individuals, and a convic
tion that is unafraid to say America
on net is a force for good. The Re
publican Party today represents dy
namism and change, whether in pur
suing democracy overseas or eco
nomic growth at home.
These reasons alone, however,
were not enough for me to favor
Bush, as there were also many rea
sons to favor Kerry. As I stated in
an earlier column. I do not think I.

nor most people, are qualified to
judge the nuanced ramifications of
choosing either candidate for pres
ident.
Thus, the main reason I voted
for Bush is to be able to say things
like: It is a sad state of affairs at
Stanford that the only other gradu
ate student I know who voted for
Bush was a lifelong Democrat who
spent the last year doing research
in Iraq.
By voting for Bush, I hope to be
able to provoke thought and intro
spection in the people who will un
doubtedly be the future leaders of
the world.
Shortly after the election,
Thomas Friedman of The New
York Times essentially wrote that
he thought all the people who
voted for Bush were un-American.
I feel similar sentiments from
many at Stanford. Economist Dan
Klein finds that among college hu
manities and social science faculty.

cans seven to one. Among such
young faculty at Stanford and
Berkeley, the ratio is 30 to 1.
