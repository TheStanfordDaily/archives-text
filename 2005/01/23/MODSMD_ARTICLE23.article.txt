## Cardinal women oust overwhelmed Bruins 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Although the game was played in
doors, rain was still in the forecast last
night as No. 5 Stanford (15-2,7-1 Pacific
-10 Conference) defeated No. 25 UCLA
(11-6,5-3 Pac-10). 100-75.
A veritable monsoon of Cardinal
three-pointers soaked the Bruins at
Maples: 15 shots hit their mark from
long range in a record-tying perfor
mance for Stanford's shooters.
"I thought this was an excellent
team win for us," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "1 was very pleased with
almost all the things 1 saw."
The deck appeared to be stacked
against the Bruins all night. Sophomore
standout Noelle Quinn was out of the
lineup due to arthroscopic surgery on
her left knee. With her went 16.9 points
and 7.1 rebounds per game.
UCLA was by no means going into
battle unarmed, however.
Junior guards Nikki Blue and Lisa
Willis still form one of the finest back
court tandems in the Pac-10.
Willis, the Bruins' all-time leader in

career three-point field goals, forced
the Cardinal into a predominantly
man-to-man defensive scheme. Stan
ford was unable to sit back in the zone
that has limited so many of its oppo
nents' ability to score inside.
Blue, less of an outside threat, has
nonetheless scored 11.9 points per
game this year, and she limited the Car
dinal's defensive options with her ball
handling skills. Her ability to break
through defensive pressure and find the
open player prevented Stanford from
employing the full-court pressure that
led to a massively favorable turnover
ratio early in the season.
In a game that was never close, the
Bruins' two junior leaders did their best
to carry an overwhelmed squad.
Blue scored 26 points while handing
out five assists and pulling down five
boards. Willis tried to match the Cardi
nal's three-point shooting single-hand
edly, shooting 7-of-l 1 from three-point
range under heavy defensive pressure.
At the defensive end of the court, she
collected five steals and a pair of blocks.
"Nikki Blue is a really talented bas
ketball player." VanDerveer said, "and

Willis was hitting shots with people on
her from the ozone."
However, the story of the game was
the Cardinal's three-point shooting.
Despite being undersized, the Bruins'
defense did an excellent job early in the
night of denying Stanford post players
the advantage.
Junior center Brooke Smith was
held at 10 points and a pair of boards in
the first half. Senior T'Nae Thiel and
sophomore Kristen Newlin were both
held scoreless by an undermanned but
determined Bruin defense. UCLA kept
Stanford guessing in the first half,
sometimes fronting the post and dili
gently double-teaming the ball when it
entered the paint.
But good teams always seem to find
a way.
Denied the inside game, the Cardi
nal relentlessly kicked the ball out to
the open player on the perimeter. Ten
of Stanford's 18 first-half attempts from
beyond the arc found the net.

goals in the first half replaced the old
