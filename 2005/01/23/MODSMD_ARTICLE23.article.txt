## Cardinal women oust overwhelmed Bruins 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Although the game was played in
doors, rain was still in the forecast last
night as No. 5 Stanford (15-2,7-1 Pacific
-10 Conference) defeated No. 25 UCLA
(11-6,5-3 Pac-10). 100-75.
A veritable monsoon of Cardinal
three-pointers soaked the Bruins at
Maples: 15 shots hit their mark from
long range in a record-tying perfor
mance for Stanford's shooters.
"I thought this was an excellent
team win for us," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "1 was very pleased with
almost all the things 1 saw."
The deck appeared to be stacked
against the Bruins all night. Sophomore
standout Noelle Quinn was out of the
lineup due to arthroscopic surgery on
her left knee. With her went 16.9 points
and 7.1 rebounds per game.
UCLA was by no means going into
battle unarmed, however.
Junior guards Nikki Blue and Lisa
Willis still form one of the finest back
court tandems in the Pac-10.
Willis, the Bruins' all-time leader in

career three-point field goals, forced
the Cardinal into a predominantly
man-to-man defensive scheme. Stan
ford was unable to sit back in the zone
that has limited so many of its oppo
nents' ability to score inside.
Blue, less of an outside threat, has
nonetheless scored 11.9 points per
game this year, and she limited the Car
dinal's defensive options with her ball
handling skills. Her ability to break
through defensive pressure and find the
open player prevented Stanford from
employing the full-court pressure that
led to a massively favorable turnover
ratio early in the season.
In a game that was never close, the
Bruins' two junior leaders did their best
to carry an overwhelmed squad.
Blue scored 26 points while handing
out five assists and pulling down five
boards. Willis tried to match the Cardi
nal's three-point shooting single-hand
edly, shooting 7-of-l 1 from three-point
range under heavy defensive pressure.
At the defensive end of the court, she
collected five steals and a pair of blocks.
"Nikki Blue is a really talented bas
ketball player." VanDerveer said, "and

Willis was hitting shots with people on
her from the ozone."
However, the story of the game was
the Cardinal's three-point shooting.
Despite being undersized, the Bruins'
defense did an excellent job early in the
night of denying Stanford post players
the advantage.
Junior center Brooke Smith was
held at 10 points and a pair of boards in
the first half. Senior T'Nae Thiel and
sophomore Kristen Newlin were both
held scoreless by an undermanned but
determined Bruin defense. UCLA kept
Stanford guessing in the first half,
sometimes fronting the post and dili
gently double-teaming the ball when it
entered the paint.
But good teams always seem to find
a way.
Denied the inside game, the Cardi
nal relentlessly kicked the ball out to
the open player on the perimeter. Ten
of Stanford's 18 first-half attempts from
beyond the arc found the net.
The Cardinal's 10 three-point field
goals in the first half replaced the old

team record of nine, last set a year
ago against Washington State.
"I think it was because of our
post play," said senior Kelley Sum
inski, who tied a career-high with
five three-pointers and led the
team with 21 points. "They had to
double-team Brooke and Kristen
and T'Nae, and so that opened up
the perimeter."
Although UCLA kept it close
statistically during a wild first half,
the Bruins were simply unable to
track down Stanford's shooters, and
the Cardinal took a 46-31 advantage
into the locker room at halftime.

night.
"I think the biggest disappoint
ment of the Boston College game
was how we came out in the second
half," freshman Candice Wiggins
said. "That was definitely in our
minds."
The Cardinal's shooting began
paying dividends all over the court.
As UCLA defenders floated toward
the perimeter, the Cardinal found
space inside.
Denied some depth by Quinn's
absence, the Bruins also appeared to
tire after halftime. UCLA sue

The Cardinal, by contrast, only
got stronger, as VanDerveer once
again had the luxury of resting her
starters. Ten players saw double
digit minutes for Stanford, and the
Cardinal received excellent play
from their bench, including a team
high seven rebounds from senior
Azella Perryman.
The victory keeps the Cardinal in
a tie for the Pac-10 lead with South

Maples Saturday night looking to
take sole possession of the confer
ence lead.
