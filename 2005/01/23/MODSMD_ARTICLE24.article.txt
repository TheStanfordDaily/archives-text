### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Hours after Pres
ident George W. Bush officially marked the
start of another four years in office, the Stan
ford men's basketball team (9-7, 3-3 Pacific
-10 Conference) celebrated two terms' worth
of domination at Pauley Pavilion with a 75-64
victory over UCLA (10-5,4-3 Pac-10).
It was the Cardinal's eighth straight win at
the storied arena, the longest such streak in
the 39-year history of the building. More im
portantly, it was Stanford's third consecutive
win in the midst of an up-and-down season,
and it came against a team ahead of the Car
dinal in the conference standings that had not
lost a game at home all season.
The game offered several intriguing
matchups, not the least of which was the
showdown between two of the Pac-10's top
three scorers: UCLA's Dijon Thompson and
Stanford's Dan Grunfeld.
Despite being held scoreless for the first
nine minutes of the game, Grunfeld finished
with a game-high 25 points, including seven
straight late in the first half to stretch the Car
dinal's lead to eight. His three-pointer from
the left wing with 8:08 to play put Stanford
ahead by 11 and seemed to sap the energy
from the home crowd.
"Every win in the Pac-10 is a big win, es
pecially on the road," Grunfeld said.
Meanwhile, Thompson never got going.
Coming off a 27-point performance
against Arizona, the Pac-10's second-leading
scorer, finished with as many turnovers — six
— as points against Stanford.
With Matt Haryasz matched up against
him for most of the night, the senior forward
missed all three of his shots in the first half
and clanged several more before he convert
ed a gliding layup with 14:37 to play. Thomp
son finished 3-for-l 1 from the field.
"Matt did a really good job on Dijon,"
Stanford head coach Trent Johnson said.
"We tried to make him work for everything."
"We just wanted to limit his percentages,"
junior guard Jason Haas said. "We knew he
was going to get his shots."
Haas played 24 minutes and dished out
four assists with starting point guard Chris
Hernandez limited bv foul trouble and the flu

to just 21 minutes and a season-low four
points.
Unlike Saturday's win at California, the
Cardinal big men managed to stay out of
trouble against UCLA and were productive
inside.
Senior center Rob Little, who had 17
points and eight rebounds in the Cardinal's
Pac-10-title-clinching 73-60 win here last
year, scored 12 points and grabbed six re
bounds. Little routinely found himself open
on the low block and finished 6-for-13 from
the floor.
"I didn't do a really good job of finishing
but I'm thankful guys kept finding me," Little
said.
Junior forward Matt Haryasz played all
but two minutes and finished with 14 points
and nine rebounds, while senior forward
Nick Robinson chipped in 13.
After racing out to a 14-5 lead behind
three-pointers from Hernandez and Robin
son, Stanford seemed poised to extend its
dominance against the Bruins in easy fash
ion. But feisty UCLA, which overcame
deficits of 19 and 21 points to sweep the
Washington schools two weeks ago, refused
to go away.
With Thompson on the bench after pick
ing up his second foul with 8:46 to play in the
first half. Hernandez penetrated into the lane
and fed Little fora would-be dunk that was
blocked by freshman guard Arron Afflalo.
Seconds later, senior guard Brian Morrison
drained a three-pointer from the left corner
to bring the Bruins to within three.
Stanford took a 33-28 lead into halftime
and the lead hovered around eight points for
most of the second half.
Afflalo and freshman backcourt mate Jor
dan Farmar, who have combined to average
over 25 points per game this season, were rel
atively quiet on the offensive end, finishing
with eight and nine points, respectively.
Junior center Michael Fey did his best to
pick up the slack, finishing with 17 points and
11 rebounds to lead the Bruins, while Morri
son added 12 points off the bench. UCLA
shot just 3-of-12 from beyond the arc.
"It was a tough loss against a good team,"
UCLA head coach Ben Howland said. "They

played like a team that had won 30 games
last year. But for them to heat us with Chris
Hernandez getting only four points is tough

UCLA also played more like last year's
team that finished 11-17 than the one that
opened the Pac-10 season this year with four
wins in its first six games.

with 12 minutes to play. Morrison missed an
ill-advised three-point shot that was
launched from closer to niidcourt than the
top of the key. Robinson responded with a
three-pointer from the left wing to push the
lead back to nine, and UCLA would not se
riously threaten again.
Johnson has noticed a bit of a change in
his team's mentality since the Cardinal's
tough loss at Washington on Jan. 2.
"There was a collective understanding
that we have to play with a sense of urgency,
and we're starting to do that," he said.

dominance against the Bruins in easy fash
ion. But feisty UCLA, which overcame
deficits of 19 and 21 points to sweep the
Washington schools two weeks ago, refused
to go away.
With Thompson on the bench after pick
ing up his second foul with 8:46 to play in the
first half. Hernandez penetrated into the lane
and fed Little fora would-be dunk that was
blocked by freshman guard Arron Afflalo.
Seconds later, senior guard Brian Morrison
drained a three-pointer from the left corner
to bring the Bruins to within three.
Stanford took a 33-28 lead into halftime
and the lead hovered around eight points for
most of the second half.
Afflalo and freshman backcourt mate Jor
dan Farmar, who have combined to average
over 25 points per game this season, were rel
atively quiet on the offensive end, finishing
with eight and nine points, respectively.
Junior center Michael Fey did his best to
pick up the slack, finishing with 17 points and
11 rebounds to lead the Bruins, while Morri
son added 12 points off the bench. UCLA
shot just 3-of-12 from beyond the arc.
"It was a tough loss against a good team,"
UCLA head coach Ben Howland said. "They

played like a team that had won 30 games
last year. But for them to heat us with Chris

for us."
UCLA also played more like last year's
team that finished 11-17 than the one that
opened the Pac-10 season this year with four
wins in its first six games.

with 12 minutes to play. Morrison missed an

LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Hours after Pres
ident George W. Bush officially marked the
start of another four years in office, the Stan
ford men's basketball team (9-7, 3-3 Pacific
-10 Conference) celebrated two terms' worth
of domination at Pauley Pavilion with a 75-64
victory over UCLA (10-5,4-3 Pac-10).
It was the Cardinal's eighth straight win at
the storied arena, the longest such streak in
the 39-year history of the building. More im
portantly, it was Stanford's third consecutive
win in the midst of an up-and-down season,
and it came against a team ahead of the Car
dinal in the conference standings that had not
lost a game at home all season.
The game offered several intriguing
matchups, not the least of which was the
showdown between two of the Pac-10's top
three scorers: UCLA's Dijon Thompson and
Stanford's Dan Grunfeld.
Despite being held scoreless for the first
nine minutes of the game, Grunfeld finished
with a game-high 25 points, including seven
straight late in the first half to stretch the Car
dinal's lead to eight. His three-pointer from
the left wing with 8:08 to play put Stanford
ahead by 11 and seemed to sap the energy
from the home crowd.
"Every win in the Pac-10 is a big win, es
pecially on the road," Grunfeld said.
Meanwhile, Thompson never got going.
Coming off a 27-point performance
against Arizona, the Pac-10's second-leading
scorer, finished with as many turnovers — six
— as points against Stanford.
With Matt Haryasz matched up against
him for most of the night, the senior forward
missed all three of his shots in the first half
and clanged several more before he convert
ed a gliding layup with 14:37 to play. Thomp
son finished 3-for-l 1 from the field.
"Matt did a really good job on Dijon,"
Stanford head coach Trent Johnson said.
"We tried to make him work for everything."
"We just wanted to limit his percentages,"
junior guard Jason Haas said. "We knew he
was going to get his shots."
Haas played 24 minutes and dished out
four assists with starting point guard Chris
Hernandez limited bv foul trouble and the flu

to just 21 minutes and a season-low four
points.
Unlike Saturday's win at California, the
Cardinal big men managed to stay out of
trouble against UCLA and were productive
inside.
Senior center Rob Little, who had 17
points and eight rebounds in the Cardinal's
Pac-10-title-clinching 73-60 win here last
year, scored 12 points and grabbed six re
bounds. Little routinely found himself open
on the low block and finished 6-for-13 from
the floor.
"I didn't do a really good job of finishing
but I'm thankful guys kept finding me," Little
said.
Junior forward Matt Haryasz played all
but two minutes and finished with 14 points
and nine rebounds, while senior forward
Nick Robinson chipped in 13.
After racing out to a 14-5 lead behind
three-pointers from Hernandez and Robin
son, Stanford seemed poised to extend its
dominance against the Bruins in easy fash
ion. But feisty UCLA, which overcame
deficits of 19 and 21 points to sweep the
