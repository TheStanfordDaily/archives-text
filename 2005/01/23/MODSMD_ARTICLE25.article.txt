# Elite gymnasts on the Farm for nationwide Open
## 
### ABBY ZETLIN 
Burnham Pavilion will witness a scene
of some of the most intense collegiate
gymnastic competition in the country Sat
urday night, with many of the best male
gymnasts arriving for the Cardinal Open.
The No. 6 Stanford men s gymnastics
team (1-0) is host to one of the last com
petitions before the re-ranking, which
will occur in the coming weeks, and one
of the last Cardinal home competitions of
the season.
Eight seats will open, and Stanford
projects to place at least five men (in
cluding four freshmen) in those spots to
compete on the Senior National Team.
These men will be performing at their
top form in order to grab those open slots
in the re-ranking..
The team is off to a strong start with a
win last Sunday against No. 8 California.
This weekend Stanford will again face Cal,
but the Cardinal will also compete against
Air Force, Arizona State and Washington.
Elite gymnasts and a few high school All-
Stars will also be competing.
East year, Stanford swept the Open
with a team scoi;e of 208.550 coupled with
a weak showing from Arizona State and

Washington club teams. The men hope
not only to repeat last year's victory, but
to improve the total team score and again
dominate the competition.
Although the men's team is young, fea
turing five freshmen and five sophomores,
it looks strong and healthy. For the first
time in head coach Thom Cilielmi's four
year career at Stanford, he will be able to
field a full team of six on Saturday.
Of the six men competing, the four
best scores will be kept when the final
score is tallied, so having a full roster will
assist the team's overall score.
The competition will be stiff this Sat
urday, but the Cardinal are ready. Senior
Kelly Lang is set to astound with a huge
release skill on the horizontal bar.
"It has got to be big in dynamic or else
he is really going to come down hard like
a sack of potatoes," Glielmi said.
In addition. Lang will perform an orig
inal skill on the parallel bars.
With the loss of junior Nate Downs
due to a sprained hand, the high bar team
is struggling. However. Glielmi is hoping
that the other men will work harder to
compensate in the Open.
With the addition of five freshmen, includ
ing National Vaulting Champion David
Sender, 2(M)3 member of the bronze-medal
Fan-American team Sho Nakamori. and Ju
nior National Pommel-Horse champion Chris
Harper, the men have notched up their com
petitive spirit this year. Both Nakamori and
Sender performed well last weekend against
the Bears, although Glielmi said that
Nakamori is still struggling with his comeback
from a broken femur in 2003.
Nakamori took first place in five of the six
events against Cal, and Sender claimed a top
three finish in five.
The freshmen are not the only men on the
Cardinal team to keep an eye on. Stanford is
the No. 1 ring team in the country, with sopho
mores Peter Derman and Alex Schrosch tied
for No. 3.
"Look out for the Lords of the Rings,"
Glielmi quipped.
The NCAA and Elite Individual competi
tion will begin this Saturday at 7 p.m. Accord
ing to Glielmi, it will be a "circus" competition
with each event performing at the same time.
