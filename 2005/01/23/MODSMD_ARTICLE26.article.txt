# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## Spencer takes on water polo, this time in the pool 
### 
We all have our fun. We all laugh. We all
cry. We all enjoy a nice dip in the pool. How
ever, there are some of us out there that take
it to a new level, take their sport a little too
seriously, and take their identity to a whole
new level. I'm talking, of course, about water
polo, because nobody reads my column if I
don't.
That's right, water polo, I'm back, and only
a four-meter to the jaw will stop me.
For those of you that don't read this col
umn as religiously as my mother, let me re
mind you of my Water Polo history.

From a past column:
"You see, friends, the
water polo team exudes its
supreme alpha male status
with something they call the
"Post-up" —an activity in
which eight-to-10 of them sit
outside the Clock Tower in
the morning, basking in the
sun and watching us mere
mortals crash our bikes into

SJpenosr Barter

one another, all the while
carrying on conversations with an astonishing
overuse of the words "dude,' bro' and the
risky, but highly respected, 'dude-bro.'"
So in an effort to out-cool the polo team,
my buddies and I "posted-up," seeing as how
I couldn't beat them at their own game.
Thanks to a phobia I like to call Spencer-
Likes-To-Breathe-Phobia (Latin name:
Spencerisawussphobia), I tend to avoid
Olympic pools like herpes.
However, over this winter break, I decided
that this was hypocritical. 1 can no longer com
ment on a sport without playing the sport. I
cannot ridicule the thong without wearing the
Speedo. If I truly want to understand the psy
che of the water polo player, I must become
the water polo player.
1 jumped in the pool.
And so, in the Annual Marin Academy
Alumni Water Polo game (my high school has
a yearly alumni game for past players to take
on the current Varsity team), I started at goal
keeper.
I thought to myself, "Spencer, you're a
smart guy. You play soccer at Stanford.
You're a goalkeeper. You have enjoyed the
motion of vast bodies of water before. You
can deal with big balls (hehe). You can do
this."
My friends, all former polo players, and
therefore my teammates, weren't too sure.
When asked, on a scale of 10, how bad an idea
it was for me to be between the posts, the av
erage was a cool 11.5.
But before I had a chance to back out, the
whistle sounded and my tenure as a water polo
superstar began. With my goalkeeping skills
on trial, I rose to the challenge. I yelled at my
defenders, pandered to the fans, and intimi
dated the lowly high schoolers. Nothing could
stop me. I parried, I caught, I passed and I
fought.
Now, to be fair, the Marin Academy pool,
while toasty-warm, isn't exactly regulation
size. Owing to the fact that I'm a terrible swim
mer, and that there is a shallow end to the
mini, backyard-style pool. I only played for
two quarters — the two quarters where I only
had to stand in four feet of water, mercifully
avoiding the shame of treading water until I
drowned.
In the end, I allowed three goals in two

quarters, leading the alumni to a blowout win over the
Varsity team. I was a bailer, a man among men, a polo
superstar.
I asked my teammates how they thought I played.
"On the high school level, on a scale of one to 10, I'd
say you were 6.5 to a 7," Ryan Spies, now a club water
polo player for Lehigh, told me. "I feel like you had the
reflexes, but the legs weren't there. It was clear that mov
ing from post to post, you were unsure of the resistance
of the water."
"Your passing skills were mediocre." Spies (rhymes
with "skeez") continued, "and it was obvious that you
had a very clear confusion of the rules."
However, Spies did offer this one morsel of re
spectability.
"Polo is one of those sports that if you meet someone
who's played it, you view them in a different light, like
you already have a bond with them. It's not a national
sport, not played much outside of Southern California,

Polo man Ryan Spies
rates Spencer's skills

and not played much in Northern California. So when I
see a polo player, I don't immediately judge them. There
is just respect — he is a polo player, and that is important
to me."
That was it. By playing water polo in a high school
alumni game, if just for that one brief instant, in a four
foot pool, never going underwater and never actually
"swimming," I deserve some of that respect, right?
"I don't think 1 could say that, no. There is something
very different about standing in a four-foot pool, playing
goalie in a high school alumni game, rather than actually
playing polo. 1 can't bestow that sort of respect to you."
Well, shit.
Water Polo wins again.
I suck.

Spencer Porter, a senior, is a loser. He'll even tell you
that. Tell him how much he sucks at water polo at

playing polo. 1 can't bestow that sort of respect to you."
Well, shit.
Water Polo wins again.
I suck.

Spencer Porter, a senior, is a loser. He'll even tell you
that. Tell him how much he sucks at water polo at

We all have our fun. We all laugh. We all
cry. We all enjoy a nice dip in the pool. How
ever, there are some of us out there that take
it to a new level, take their sport a little too
seriously, and take their identity to a whole
new level. I'm talking, of course, about water
polo, because nobody reads my column if I
don't.
That's right, water polo, I'm back, and only
a four-meter to the jaw will stop me.
For those of you that don't read this col
umn as religiously as my mother, let me re
mind you of my Water Polo history.

From a past column:
"You see, friends, the
water polo team exudes its
supreme alpha male status
with something they call the
"Post-up" —an activity in
which eight-to-10 of them sit
outside the Clock Tower in
the morning, basking in the
sun and watching us mere
mortals crash our bikes into

SJpenosr Barter

one another, all the while
carrying on conversations with an astonishing
overuse of the words "dude,' bro' and the
risky, but highly respected, 'dude-bro.'"
So in an effort to out-cool the polo team,
my buddies and I "posted-up," seeing as how
I couldn't beat them at their own game.
Thanks to a phobia I like to call Spencer-
Likes-To-Breathe-Phobia (Latin name:
Spencerisawussphobia), I tend to avoid
Olympic pools like herpes.
However, over this winter break, I decided
that this was hypocritical. 1 can no longer com
ment on a sport without playing the sport. I
cannot ridicule the thong without wearing the
Speedo. If I truly want to understand the psy
che of the water polo player, I must become
the water polo player.
1 jumped in the pool.
And so, in the Annual Marin Academy
Alumni Water Polo game (my high school has
a yearly alumni game for past players to take
on the current Varsity team), I started at goal
keeper.
I thought to myself, "Spencer, you're a
smart guy. You play soccer at Stanford.
You're a goalkeeper. You have enjoyed the
motion of vast bodies of water before. You
can deal with big balls (hehe). You can do
this."
My friends, all former polo players, and
therefore my teammates, weren't too sure.
When asked, on a scale of 10, how bad an idea
it was for me to be between the posts, the av
erage was a cool 11.5.
But before I had a chance to back out, the
whistle sounded and my tenure as a water polo
superstar began. With my goalkeeping skills
on trial, I rose to the challenge. I yelled at my
defenders, pandered to the fans, and intimi
dated the lowly high schoolers. Nothing could
stop me. I parried, I caught, I passed and I
fought.
Now, to be fair, the Marin Academy pool,
while toasty-warm, isn't exactly regulation
size. Owing to the fact that I'm a terrible swim
mer, and that there is a shallow end to the
mini, backyard-style pool. I only played for
two quarters — the two quarters where I only
had to stand in four feet of water, mercifully
avoiding the shame of treading water until I
drowned.
In the end, I allowed three goals in two

quarters, leading the alumni to a blowout win over the
Varsity team. I was a bailer, a man among men, a polo
superstar.
I asked my teammates how they thought I played.
"On the high school level, on a scale of one to 10, I'd
say you were 6.5 to a 7," Ryan Spies, now a club water
polo player for Lehigh, told me. "I feel like you had the
reflexes, but the legs weren't there. It was clear that mov
ing from post to post, you were unsure of the resistance
of the water."
"Your passing skills were mediocre." Spies (rhymes
with "skeez") continued, "and it was obvious that you
had a very clear confusion of the rules."
However, Spies did offer this one morsel of re
spectability.
"Polo is one of those sports that if you meet someone
who's played it, you view them in a different light, like
you already have a bond with them. It's not a national
sport, not played much outside of Southern California,

Polo man Ryan Spies
rates Spencer's skills

and not played much in Northern California. So when I
see a polo player, I don't immediately judge them. There
is just respect — he is a polo player, and that is important
to me."
That was it. By playing water polo in a high school
alumni game, if just for that one brief instant, in a four
foot pool, never going underwater and never actually
"swimming," I deserve some of that respect, right?
"I don't think 1 could say that, no. There is something
very different about standing in a four-foot pool, playing
goalie in a high school alumni game, rather than actually
playing polo. 1 can't bestow that sort of respect to you."
