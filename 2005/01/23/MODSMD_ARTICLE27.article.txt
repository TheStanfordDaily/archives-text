# Rearranged lineup succumbs to 49er sweep

### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sorely missing the three outside hit
ters who stayed at home due to in
juries, the No 8 Stanford men's volley
ball team hits the road this week after
falling to No. 5 Long Beach State on
Wednesday. Staying put at the Farm
were sophomore Josh Schwarzapel
and juniors Nick Manov and Ben
Reddy. The 0-3 loss put the depleted
Cardinal squad's overall record at 2-4.
1-2 in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation.
"We lost a real strong hitter and our
most effective server, so that really
hurt." head coach Don Shaw said. "But
the guys that were out there still need
ed to play better."
Out of necessity, the starting lineup
for the Cardinal was a little different on
Wednesday. Freshman Matt Ceran
played in all three games as an outside
hitter, though his listed position is mid
dle blocker / opposite. Still green in the
opposite position was rearranged red
shirt junior William Clayton.
"He hasn't played [opposite] much
this year at all," Shaw said of Clayton.
"It's not his natural position."
Even with an unusual lineup, the
team put up a solid offensive effort in

the first game, staying neck-and-neck
with the 49ers. But at 25-25, Long
Beach started to pull away. The 49ers
clinched a 27-30 win over the Cardinal
on a Stanford service error.
"Sometimes it's a lack of concen
tration; sometimes you're trying to
serve tough and just miss," Shaw said.
"In that game, we had a few near
misses, just out by an inch or two.
When you miss that many serves and
lose the game by three points, that's
tough."
The second game of the match
seemed promising for Stanford, and
the squad started out with a 4-0 lead
that prompted an early Long Beach
timeout. However, the 49ers quickly
tied and proceeded to leave the Cardi
nal behind, 23-30.
Looking at the stats for the middle
match, its no surprise Stanford couldn't
keep up. The Cardinal posted a hitting
percentage of minus-.080 in that game,
as opposed to the 49ers' .423.
"Offensively, we were good in game
one; It was just not a good job defen
sively," Shaw said. "In game two, we
were just bad all the way around. We
didn't do anything very well. We broke
down."

In response to the slump, Stan
ford came back strong in game
three, leading for the majority of
play. The 49ers tied it up at 20-20,
but the Cardinal kept it close.
Long Beach then failed to capi
talize on four game points, starting
at 28-29, giving Stanford the op
portunity to tie it up every time.
Despite Stanford's efforts, the
49ers finally got it right on their
fifth attempt, finishing the match
with a 34-32 win.
"We had no blocks in game one,
and we might have had one or two
in game two, but we ended the
match with about 10 blocks," Shaw
said. "When the block is working
better, we're getting a lot of digs on
defense because the block is well
positioned. Blocking better made

it easier to score points.
Shaw also attributed the team's
improved performance in game
three to opponent errors.
"Long Beach lost its concentra
tion and missed a lot of serves,"
Shaw said. "We played better but
still ended up losing. It was a com
petitive game — the best-played
game of the match."
Looking to avoid the pitfalls of
early Wednesday night and hop
ing to improve its third-game per
formance, Stanford will take on
UC-San Diego (0-3, 0-2 MPSF)
this evening. UCSD. the only Di
vision-II team in the Mountain
Pacific Sports Conference, is just
shy of the top 15 — but this
doesn't mean that they are to be
taken lightly.

Stanford's focus is on
improving, not UCSD

" They're scrappy," Shaw said.
"They're physically not as loaded
as some of the other teams, but
they're used to being that way.
They know they're the underdog in
every match, so they come out and
play hard. When we're less than
full strength, we're going to be in
trouble against them. We lost to
them last year because they played
a good match, and we didn't play
very well."
UC-San Diego's last match was
a 2-3 loss to No. 13 UC-Santa Bar
bara. But the biggest challenge fac
ing the Cardinal tonight won't nec
essarily be the Tritons,
"Right now, it's not a matter of
who the opponent is," Shaw said.
"It's the fact that we need to go out
there and execute better."
