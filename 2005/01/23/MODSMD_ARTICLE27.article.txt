# Rearranged lineup succumbs to 49er sweep

Sorely missing the three outside hit
ters who stayed at home due to in
juries, the No 8 Stanford men's volley
ball team hits the road this week after
falling to No. 5 Long Beach State on
Wednesday. Staying put at the Farm
were sophomore Josh Schwarzapel
and juniors Nick Manov and Ben
Reddy. The 0-3 loss put the depleted
Cardinal squad's overall record at 2-4.
1-2 in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation.
"We lost a real strong hitter and our
most effective server, so that really
hurt." head coach Don Shaw said. "But
the guys that were out there still need
ed to play better."
Out of necessity, the starting lineup
for the Cardinal was a little different on
Wednesday. Freshman Matt Ceran
played in all three games as an outside
hitter, though his listed position is mid
dle blocker / opposite. Still green in the
opposite position was rearranged red
shirt junior William Clayton.
"He hasn't played [opposite] much
this year at all," Shaw said of Clayton.
"It's not his natural position."
Even with an unusual lineup, the
team put up a solid offensive effort in

the first game, staying neck-and-neck
with the 49ers. But at 25-25, Long
Beach started to pull away. The 49ers
clinched a 27-30 win over the Cardinal
on a Stanford service error.
"Sometimes it's a lack of concen
tration; sometimes you're trying to
serve tough and just miss," Shaw said.
"In that game, we had a few near
misses, just out by an inch or two.
When you miss that many serves and
lose the game by three points, that's
tough."
The second game of the match
seemed promising for Stanford, and
the squad started out with a 4-0 lead
that prompted an early Long Beach
timeout. However, the 49ers quickly
tied and proceeded to leave the Cardi
nal behind, 23-30.
Looking at the stats for the middle
match, its no surprise Stanford couldn't
keep up. The Cardinal posted a hitting
percentage of minus-.080 in that game,
as opposed to the 49ers' .423.
"Offensively, we were good in game
one; It was just not a good job defen
sively," Shaw said. "In game two, we
were just bad all the way around. We
didn't do anything very well. We broke
down."
