# No. 1 squad hits the Arizona desert
## 
### SAMUEL CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The quest for perfection for the top-ranked Stan
ford men's swimming and diving team (3-0,0-0 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) will go through the Cirand Canyon
State this weekend as the C ardinal take on Pac-10
challengers Arizona State (2-1) and No. 5 Arizona (4-
1, 1-1 Pac-10) in back-to-back dual-meets this Friday
and Saturday.
Having already notched convincing dual-meet vic
tories over CSU-Bakersfield, Michigan and Pacific,
Stanford will be hoping to silence any doubters of its
recent rise to the No. 1 position with forceful perfor
mances in its only extensive road trip of the dual-meet
season.
Though fatigued by intensive training and the in
nate character of the hectic dual-meet season. Stan
ford is poised for an exciting series of competitions to
close out the regular season.
"No matter how broken down the team may be
from training hard, we are always ready to rise to a
challenge and do our best." said sophomore Andy
Grant.
Recently, the best the Cardinal have offered has
been enough to dismantle all challengers. While hon
ing their skills and race strategies, the Cardinal have
also established individual season-best times in many
events.
As they travel to face the Arizona schools, the
Stanford swimmers are not only prepared, but
psyched to swim head-to-head in opponents' pools.
"The older |swimmers| have plenty of experience
traveling, so it's going to be a critical trip for the fresh
men," Grant said. "It's not how they deal with feeling
comfortable that makes a great swimmer, it's how they
deal with the adversity of a hostile environment and
strong competition that reveals the inner champions."
The focus on the freshman swimmers has grown as
the dual meet season has progressed. The 200.X class
had been making vast improvements since the begin
ning of the season and has been providing quality
depth that will strengthen postseason performances.
In past years, Stanford has had success in these Pac
-10 battles, defeating the consistently competitive
Wildcats 154-133 and the Sun Devils 127-107 in the
2003-04 campaign.
The last time the Wildcats defeated the Cardinal
was in the IW9-2(XX) season — the last season the
Cardinal lost any dual-meet — but Stanford's domi
nance over the Sun Devils is even more eye-catching.
The last victory for ASU in its series against Stanford
was in the 1990-91 season, when the Sun Devils edged
the Cardinal 124-119.

Despite Stanford's past successes, the Cardinal
swimmers still hold great respect for their opponents.
"ASU is a good team and will give us some strong
racing which will hopefully iron out the wrinkles of
travel and catapult us into the big meet on Saturday,"
said sophomore Shaun Phillips. "Arizona has a very
strong dual-meet team right now and will provide us
with a great challenge."
The diversity of skills put to the test in the recent
and upcoming schedule is also expected to prove use
ful down the line.
"Whereas Michigan tested some of our longer
event swimmers, Arizona is considered one of the best
sprinting teams in the country and will give all of our
short-distance swimmers an opportunity to test them
selves against a group of guys that will assuredly be
there at the end of the year," Phillips said.
Following this road trip, the Cardinal men's team
will come home to face Southern California on Feb. 5
and then travel to Berkeley to meet its cross-bay rivals
in Big Swim to conclude the regular season.
The concern of the soon-approaching dual meets,
however, is not taking over the minds of Stanford
swimmers, who have not lost a dual meet in four con
secutive seasons.
The Cardinal know that the postseason Pac-10 and
NCAA championships will determine their legacy.
"We are very much more focused on the end of the
year and not especially concerned about the upcom
ing dual-meets," Grant said. "This attitude is reflect
ed in the pool as each member of the team is training
just as hard now as they had during the beginning
weeks — not trying to rest themselves fora particular
dual meet, hut readying themselves for Pac-lOs and
NCAAs."

"The older |swimmers| have plenty of experience
traveling, so it's going to be a critical trip for the fresh
men," Grant said. "It's not how they deal with feeling
comfortable that makes a great swimmer, it's how they
deal with the adversity of a hostile environment and
strong competition that reveals the inner champions."
The focus on the freshman swimmers has grown as
the dual meet season has progressed. The 200.X class
had been making vast improvements since the begin
ning of the season and has been providing quality
depth that will strengthen postseason performances.
In past years, Stanford has had success in these Pac
-10 battles, defeating the consistently competitive
Wildcats 154-133 and the Sun Devils 127-107 in the
2003-04 campaign.
The last time the Wildcats defeated the Cardinal
was in the IW9-2(XX) season — the last season the
Cardinal lost any dual-meet — but Stanford's domi
nance over the Sun Devils is even more eye-catching.
The last victory for ASU in its series against Stanford
was in the 1990-91 season, when the Sun Devils edged
the Cardinal 124-119.

Despite Stanford's past successes, the Cardinal
swimmers still hold great respect for their opponents.
"ASU is a good team and will give us some strong
racing which will hopefully iron out the wrinkles of
travel and catapult us into the big meet on Saturday,"
said sophomore Shaun Phillips. "Arizona has a very
strong dual-meet team right now and will provide us
with a great challenge."
The diversity of skills put to the test in the recent
and upcoming schedule is also expected to prove use
ful down the line.
"Whereas Michigan tested some of our longer
event swimmers, Arizona is considered one of the best
sprinting teams in the country and will give all of our
short-distance swimmers an opportunity to test them
selves against a group of guys that will assuredly be
there at the end of the year," Phillips said.
Following this road trip, the Cardinal men's team
will come home to face Southern California on Feb. 5
and then travel to Berkeley to meet its cross-bay rivals
in Big Swim to conclude the regular season.
The concern of the soon-approaching dual meets,
however, is not taking over the minds of Stanford
swimmers, who have not lost a dual meet in four con
secutive seasons.
The Cardinal know that the postseason Pac-10 and
NCAA championships will determine their legacy.
"We are very much more focused on the end of the
year and not especially concerned about the upcom
ing dual-meets," Grant said. "This attitude is reflect
ed in the pool as each member of the team is training
just as hard now as they had during the beginning
weeks — not trying to rest themselves fora particular
dual meet, hut readying themselves for Pac-lOs and
NCAAs."

Stanford's weekend visit to the Arizona schools gives its
freshmen a chance to experience a hostile setting.
The quest for perfection for the top-ranked Stan
ford men's swimming and diving team (3-0,0-0 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) will go through the Cirand Canyon
State this weekend as the C ardinal take on Pac-10
challengers Arizona State (2-1) and No. 5 Arizona (4-
1, 1-1 Pac-10) in back-to-back dual-meets this Friday
and Saturday.
Having already notched convincing dual-meet vic
tories over CSU-Bakersfield, Michigan and Pacific,
Stanford will be hoping to silence any doubters of its
recent rise to the No. 1 position with forceful perfor
mances in its only extensive road trip of the dual-meet
season.
Though fatigued by intensive training and the in
nate character of the hectic dual-meet season. Stan
ford is poised for an exciting series of competitions to
close out the regular season.
"No matter how broken down the team may be
from training hard, we are always ready to rise to a
challenge and do our best." said sophomore Andy
Grant.
Recently, the best the Cardinal have offered has
been enough to dismantle all challengers. While hon
ing their skills and race strategies, the Cardinal have
also established individual season-best times in many
events.
As they travel to face the Arizona schools, the
Stanford swimmers are not only prepared, but
psyched to swim head-to-head in opponents' pools.
"The older |swimmers| have plenty of experience
traveling, so it's going to be a critical trip for the fresh
men," Grant said. "It's not how they deal with feeling
comfortable that makes a great swimmer, it's how they
