						only rule of 24-hour Stanford Dance Marathon: stay on your feet

### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Beginning at noon tomorrow.
260 students will dance the day —
and night — away at Roble Gym
for the inaugural Stanford Dance
Marathon. The 24-hour-long event
will benefit the Elizabeth Glaser
Pediatric AIDS Foundation, a non
profit organization dedicated to
helping children with HIV and
AIDS.
"I believe [Dance Marathon]
will be the largest student philan
thropy event of the year in terms of
the amount of publicity, money
raised, student participation, cam
pus resources and ultimate conse
quences of the event." said Dance
Marathon Co-Chair Fat Bomhack,

a senior.
Each dancer has pledged to
raise at least $125 to contribute to
the $30,000 goal. The final dona
tions were collected yesterday; the
total amount raised will be an
nounced at the close of the event.
"We've just started calculating,
but we feel really positive we will
meet the goal," said senior Sonam
Sherpa, a Dance Marathon finan
cial executive.
Bomhack, who has worked with
the event's founder, senior Sanjay
Shah, for the past year, said the
fundraising experience has been
overwhelmingly positive.
"Dance Marathon is an easy sell.
It's an event where students, out of
their own personal charity, get to
help raise money for children with

HIV and AIDS," Bomhack said.
He encouraged to
drop by and motivate the dancers,
and organizers invited more than
100 faculty members and commu
nity leaders to visit as well. All
guests are asked to donate a sug
gested $10 entrance fee to support
the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric
AIDS Foundation.
Dancers aren't required to
dance for 24 hours nonstop but
must stay on their feet the whole
time. To help keep dancers enter
tained, the event will include per
formances by more than 20 stu
dent groups, several campus
D.J.s, bands and guest speakers.


Students break it down in White Plaza to
promote the first-ever Stanford Dance
Marathon, which starts tomorrow.
