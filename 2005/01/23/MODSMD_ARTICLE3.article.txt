# The 						only rule of 24-hour Stanford Dance Marathon: stay on your feet
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Beginning at noon tomorrow.
260 students will dance the day —
and night — away at Roble Gym
for the inaugural Stanford Dance
Marathon. The 24-hour-long event
will benefit the Elizabeth Glaser
Pediatric AIDS Foundation, a non
profit organization dedicated to
helping children with HIV and
AIDS.
"I believe [Dance Marathon]
will be the largest student philan
thropy event of the year in terms of
the amount of publicity, money
raised, student participation, cam
pus resources and ultimate conse
quences of the event." said Dance
Marathon Co-Chair Fat Bomhack,

a senior.
Each dancer has pledged to
raise at least $125 to contribute to
the $30,000 goal. The final dona
tions were collected yesterday; the
total amount raised will be an
nounced at the close of the event.
"We've just started calculating,
but we feel really positive we will
meet the goal," said senior Sonam
Sherpa, a Dance Marathon finan
cial executive.
Bomhack, who has worked with
the event's founder, senior Sanjay
Shah, for the past year, said the
fundraising experience has been
overwhelmingly positive.
"Dance Marathon is an easy sell.
It's an event where students, out of
their own personal charity, get to
help raise money for children with

HIV and AIDS," Bomhack said.
He encouraged to
drop by and motivate the dancers,
and organizers invited more than
100 faculty members and commu
nity leaders to visit as well. All
guests are asked to donate a sug
gested $10 entrance fee to support
the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric
AIDS Foundation.
Dancers aren't required to
dance for 24 hours nonstop but
must stay on their feet the whole
time. To help keep dancers enter
tained, the event will include per
formances by more than 20 stu
dent groups, several campus
D.J.s, bands and guest speakers.


Students break it down in White Plaza to
promote the first-ever Stanford Dance
Marathon, which starts tomorrow.
and is packed with activities like a
300-person pillow fight, dance con
tests and Twister.
In addition to the 260 registered
dancers, 150 student "moralers," will
serve three-hour shifts to boost
morale throughout the night and
into the wee hours of the morning.
About 60 committee members, who
worked for months to organize the
event and pledged a minimum of
$175 each, will also be on hand —
and on their feet — at the Marathon.
About 80 percent of the dancers
are female, and most are undergrad
uates. Many dancers chose to
teamup with friends to make
fundraising easier and dancing more
fun.
To raise money, most partici
pants asked friends and family for
donations. Some were sponsored by
their dorms, while others went door
to-door.
Freshman Sarah Kleinman raised
$2,000 for Dance Marathon by writ
ing over 40 letters to family friends
and her friends' parents.
"The letters were all personalized
and took a substantial amount of
time, but hand-writing letters makes
a big difference." she said.
"In the letters, I said that even
just a few dollars would make a dif
ference, and I made sure to include a
self-addressed stamped envelope."
Kleinman said she was surprised
that almost all her friends respond
ed: "I got far more donations than I
thought I would. They weren't huge
amounts of money, but they really
added up."
Local businesses donated over
$1,500 in raffle prizes to reward the
dancers. Prizes vary from free mani
cures and pizzas to hotel rooms and
fancy dinners.
"We even got a gift certificate do
nated from a diamond store," said
senior Agnieszka Czechowicz,
Dance Marathon's corporate and
catering executive.

She said organizers were espe
cially grateful to Stanford Dining,
which is donating $10,000 worth of
food to refuel the hungry dancers
around the clock.
Bomhack stressed the education
al side of the event and the impor
tance of the cause: "Dance
Marathon is a special tool for educa
tion. Stanford is using this event as a
creative way to teach people about
serious health issues."
According to the Glaser Founda
tion, approximately 5.6 million chil
dren worldwide have lost their lives
to AIDS since its outbreak, and
more than 2.000 children are infect
ed with HIV each day.
Photo displays, a meditation
room and a variety of educational
materials will be at the event to in
form visitors and participants about
the Foundation and pediatric AIDS.
While the event is new at Stan
ford, more than 100 universities na
tionwide have held a Dance
Marathon, making it the largest stu
dent philanthropy event in the coun
try. Universities use the Dance
Marathons structure to raise money
for charity, but they are not formally
connected.
The charitable aims of Stanford
Dance Marathon are serious, but the
event itself is meant to be fun. A
schedule filled with live entertain
ment and activities will help stave off
drowsiness, Czechowicz said.
"There's free food, a 5 a.m. pillow
fight, different themes throughout
the night and tons of fun activities
planned so the dancers will easily
stay awake. It's like a 24-hour-long
party."
Can dancers sleep it they're
standing up or leaning against a
wall?
"Urn, I don't think so. That's not
allowed," Czechowicz said. "Be
sides, there's loud music playing the
whole time. They're not even going
to want to sleep."
