# You might be waiting for 'ole Teddy boy...and it's worth it
## 
### KATIE BERK INTERMISSION LITERARY CRITIC 
I have to admit to having a rather large bias toward
this book. Howard Frank Mosher lives in Northern
Vermont and uses this setting for all of his books.
And as a Vermonter, this naturally appeals to me.
Mosher has a knack for capturing the feel of rural life
by creating fictitious little towns full of eccentric char
acters. While some of these oddballs may seem a lit
tle over the top and unbelievable to you city dwellers,
let me assure you from personal experience that
neighbors who threaten to bulldoze down barns and
constables (i.e. elected police officers) whose
biggest worry is out of season hunting really do exist.

But don't write this book off if rural Vermont life
doesn't exactly work you into a tizzy of excitement.
The story revolves around Ethan "E.A." Allen, a little
boy who dreams of playing for the Boston Red Sox
one day. Now, having been raised as an adamant
Yankees fan, this part of book is a little hard for me to
take, but I still have to admire E.A's single-minded
determination. Even if it is a little misguided. Anyone
who ever dreamed of growing to be a famous athlete
(and I know most of you did) will appreciate the plot
of this novel. The reader can't help but root for E.A.
as he progresses from an eight-year-old thrilled at
the idea of a little batting practice with his mom to a
15-year-old town league phenom to the day a Boston
Red Sox recruiter shows up at his front door.
Mosher litters throughout the book a barrage of
bizarre characters that promise to amuse even the
most serious reader. There's E.A.'s mom to entertain
you, if young, single mothers who striptease fora liv
ing are your thing. There's the drifter who teaches
E.A. to play baseball to add a little mystery into the
mix. There's the judge who happens to be the cousin
of the constable, yet still throws out all his cases. The
list of artfully sketched characters goes on and on.
The book does falter when Mosher tries to work
the Red Sox into the plot more than is necessary.
After more than half a novel chronicling the life of
E.A., the book suddenly changes to chapters alter
nating between E.A.'s continuing improvement and
the Red Sox's predictable (despite this year's un
characteristic results) demise. Mosher seems to be
implying that fate is bringing the boy and "his team"
together, but I can't help but feel that E.A. wouldn't
have gotten a shot if the Sox didn't suck. Which is ul
timately a let down after watching him work so hard
for 200 pages.
Despite its missteps, "Waiting for Teddy Williams"
is a thoroughly amusing read. I highly recommend
this book to the baseball enthusiast and to those of
you who, like me, miss your rural homes. Or for
anyone who's just looking to waste all that free
time we have (when was the last time you ven
tured into "non-required" reading?) with a fast, fun
read.


Something tells me that tfiis book is about baseball Must be the
cow standing in the middle of the field Mmm . McDonalds
