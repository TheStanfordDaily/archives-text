## SIDEWAYS 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION TEETOTALER 
FROMTFBE DIRECTOR OF^

Who knew that a little film about a road trip through
southern California's wine country would be able to uncork
a bottle of critical praise, inspire travel and tourism, and
even snag a Best Picture Golden Globe?
My guess is that when "Sideways" first opened, Alexan
der Payne knew. The director of "Election" and "About
Schmidt," Payne presents us with a small tale of two
friends, Miles and Jack, embarking on one last weekend of
golf, wine tasting and, yes, sex, before Jack's wedding.
The film centers on the misadventures of Miles (Paul Gi
amatti), an aspiring author and eighth grade teacher who
takes off for the wine country with Jack (Thomas Hayden
Church), an almost-over-the-hill television actor. While
Miles is attempting to teach Jack about the "fineries" of
wine, Jack is attempting to get Miles and himself laid. It's
clearly a relationship formed on giving.
While on their respective quests, Miles and Jack meet
the beautiful and recently divorced Maya (Virginia Mad
sen) and the effervescent, and perhaps a little naughty,
Stephanie (Sandra Oh). And from here on out, trouble
ensues.
What makes "Sideways" so good is its ability to present
a candid look at the banality of everyday existence with ir
reverence, melancholy and a subtle dry humor. It exposes
those moments where life is embarrassing, funny and
often intensely pitiful. We feel both a sympathy and respect

for our hero, Miles, who trans
forms into a sort of neurotic "every
man." We feel for Miles the way we
feel for Bridget Jones or Charlie
Kaufman. We love them, we are
them and we feel sorry for them.
"Sideways" borders on being
boring at times, but just before it
slips into obscurity, it saves itself
with a dose of absurd humor.
What makes the film is a handful of

truly great moments â€” discovering Maya's secret passion
for horticulture on the darkened porch of Stephanie's
house, watching Miles explode with rage at a winery bar,
or witnessing Jack charging fellow golfers with 3-wood in
hand.
The film touches on a lot of the same ideas as Payne's
previous works, but without the abrasiveness of "Election,"
or the severity (or nudity involving Kathy Bates) of "About
Schmidt."
So, does it live up to the hype? The answer is clearly
"yes." "Sideways" is really a solid, poetic film with a well-de
veloped story line filled with enough evocative imagery and
metaphor to make an English teacher blush and enough!
dry humor to make Jon Stewart chuckle.
"Sideways" manages to be deeply sad without being"
depressing. Much like "Garden State,"the film presents a
light at the end of the tunnel, a glimmer of hope for the fu
ture. And, just perhaps, that glimmer means Oscar gold.
