# Guilt-free TV for those who can afford to lose brain cells
## 
### JIMMY MOSQUEDA INTERMISSION COUCH POTATO 
We college students are a cultured
bunch. We watch all the latest cut
ting-edge movies, listen to the hottest
rock bands and read the newest rad
ical, left-wing (or right-wing, if you
swing that way) books. But one thing
I've noticed among Stanford students
and the college population in general
is that not many people watch TV (or
at least admit to watching TV). Even
Thefacebook.com doesn't have a
field for "Favorite TV Shows." Instead
we are left to add our favorite shows
under "Interests" or "Favorite
Movies."

Perhaps all those reports about how watching
television kills brain cells have scared people
away. (What, like watching movies doesn't have
the same effect?) I can understand. Just one
switch to the Fox network and its crop of reality

shows such as "Who's
Your Daddy?" and "My
Big Fat Obnoxious Boss"
ought to kill a few million
cells. Seriously, do we re
ally believe watching TV
will make us dumber? I
mean, I watch TV and I
done good, right?
So we've agreed that
the majority of what is on
TV is mindless dreck,
but there is a lot out
there that can actually
make you think a bit and
also entertain you. Here
are a few shows you can
watch and not feel like

you just licked clean the bottom of a pigsty.
"Alias" Okay, so ABC totally plays up Jen
nifer Garner's natural assets in its advertising
campaign, but don't let that fool you. The spy

drama, which just started its fourth season
this month, is still one of the most complicated
series on television. This was the show that
established JJ Abrams ("Lost") as a genius.
(Wednesday at 9 p.m. on ABC)
"24" This show just started its fourth season
as well, and it is better than ever. How can you
say no to a show unafraid to portray members
of a Muslim family as perfectly normal, de
cent, American citizens, who just happen to
be orchestrating a large terrorist plot from the
living room of their own home, including their
15-year-old son? Be prepared to get serious
ly addicted. (Mondays at 9 p.m. on Fox —
that's right, Fox)
"Arrested Development" "Scary? No. No, it's
the opposite of scary. It's like a carnival...
without the half person on the skateboard
that grabbed your knee to steady himself."
(Sundays at 8:30 p.m. on Fox — wow, per
haps Fox isn't so bad after all)

American Idol Just kidding.
Editor's Note: Another sign that the apoca
lypse is coming has to be Fox's recent ad
mission that they were "relying too heavily on
reality television."
I know your guilty pleasure is watching
"The O.C" on Thursday nights, but aren't you
tired of hearing a reference to Death Cab for
Cutie every 15 minutes? Or hearing a
swelling snippet of one of their songs every
time the script calls fora "poignant / moving"
moment (or as much as you can be moved by
Orange County drama, which consists of fig
uring out who's your baby's father, hooking
up with the lawn guy to spite your bitchy mom,
and finding out your half-sister is making out
with your surrogate son)? Give me a break.
Watch "Iron Chef'reruns, "Iron Chef Amer
ica"and pull out those "Family Guy" DVDs.
I've also heard good things about "Desperate
Housewives" — (sounds like soft porn, don't
it?)


Together wi tfi Daredevil (Ben Affleck) b
create tfte monster known as Ben- Gar.

be orchestrating a large terrorist plot from the
living room of their own home, including their
15-year-old son? Be prepared to get serious
ly addicted. (Mondays at 9 p.m. on Fox —

"Arrested Development" "Scary? No. No, it's
the opposite of scary. It's like a carnival...

I know your guilty pleasure is watching
"The O.C" on Thursday nights, but aren't you
tired of hearing a reference to Death Cab for
Cutie every 15 minutes? Or hearing a
swelling snippet of one of their songs every
time the script calls fora "poignant / moving"
moment (or as much as you can be moved by
Orange County drama, which consists of fig
uring out who's your baby's father, hooking
up with the lawn guy to spite your bitchy mom,
and finding out your half-sister is making out
with your surrogate son)? Give me a break.
Watch "Iron Chef'reruns, "Iron Chef Amer
ica"and pull out those "Family Guy" DVDs.
I've also heard good things about "Desperate
Housewives" — (sounds like soft porn, don't
it?)
