### SASHA LUBOMIRSKY ALEX ROSEN INTERMISSION SKETCH ARTISTS 
What's the difference between a
sketchfest at Stanford and a sketchfest
in San Francisco? Other than the lack of
white boy bump and grind, the latter is
significantly funnier, although some
times just as awkward. The SF Sketch
fest, also called the San Francisco
Sketch Comedy Festival, is in its fourth
year and features everyone from Dana
Carvey and The Onion Live to Chris
Hardwick (the one that wasn't the Play
boy Playmate on "Singled Ouf). Rather
successful at its aim (quality sketch
comedy and generally good times), it is
distinctly different from improv and cer
tainly so from stand-up. Well, what is it
exactly, you may ask 9 Intermission can
most simply answer by replying, "Dude,
haven't you ever seen 'SNL'?"
However, Joe Klocek, who was the
MC for the opening night, began the
show with some fine quality stand-up.
He delivered narratives including one
especially noteworthy account about
a masturbating bus-rider. If you can
believe it,"I hope my stop comes be-

tore he does," and,"I hope I get oft be
fore he does" weren't even the most
amusing parts of the, ahem, detailed
account. After the enjoyable stand-up
came the first sketch comedy team,
Hard N' Phirm. Although it started
strong with a multi-media sing-along
to a Spanish song about the heart
(ventricles in Spanish is way sexier in
English), it started to lose its steam
somewhere in the middle when the
sing-songs continued, but the novelty
wore off. Plus, Intermission was all the
while stressing out in trying to figure
out if That Guy Who Looks Like The
Guy From "Singled Out" really was the
guy from "Singled Out" (it was). Once
we heard the name Chris thrown

around and got the pun (Hard and
Phirm, get it, do you get it?),

we were satisfied.
Kasper Hauser was

(and current

proof that not

everyone goes

corporate job after a

Stanford education). The

comedy, at

times, was wise

and erudite; at
others, there was a pudgy and shirtless
40-something man kung-fu-kicking a
white board that had "premature ejacula
tion" written on it in black marker. Never
theless, the overall

humor was smart — al
beit a bit straining at
times.
The act that followed
was Prank the Dean. The
youngest performers that
were on stage that
evening, the four boys
and one girl hailed from
UC-Santa Cruz and gave
the audience the neces
sary energy to make it to
intermission. Although
the general crowd didn't
pick up on the humor
right away, Intermission
found it hilarious from the
get go and judging by the
lauahter that followed as

iici u lUI lunuvvcu ao
the sketches went along, it seemed that
everyone else came around as well. Es
pecially funny was Jesse Thorn: We ex
pect him on "SNL" in the near future — if
it gets better any time soon, that is.
The penultimate act was a two-per
son female group called Clifford & Kidd,
which quite frankly really made Intermis
sion have to go the ladies' room — from
laughter, not antsy squirming. Maybe it's
the woman thing, but we're pretty sure
that Carrie Clifford and Amy Kidd just
freaking know funny. Dispersed
amongst their main sketches were short
vignettes of jaded darkly-clad models
smoking cigarettes and musing about
life in monotone one-liners. As Air played
in the background, we were exposed to

the darkest and most hysterical thoughts
of the painfully beautiful. Intermis-

sion could try and explain,

but they were so com-

plex in their simplici-

ty, we suggest

you just see

them on your

own. The act

ended with

a look into

two sepa-

versations:

a mother's

version of

life with

daughter to a

friend, and a

teenage daugh-

ter at the dinner

table backtalking to

her mother. The dispar-

ity of the inter-

action will

make you
laugh, remember your own angsty teen
years and laugh some more.
The finale was Killing My Lobster,
which despite being highly acclaimed,
felt like a step down from some of the

previous acts. The whole first sketch
had a great premise — a political candi
date who lost her election because of
her baby hands (no, really, you should
have seen her hands) but when it be
came clear that it was the only joke in
the whole skit, it grew old and consider
ably less hysterical. Nevertheless,
Killing My Lobster was enjoyable and
the San Francisco Sketchfest is certain
ly a wonderful way to spend an evening.
Even despite the ODnoxious red-head
ed couple sitting right behind us who
were consistently cueing each other's
over-exaggerated laughter to the point
the jokes were drowned out by FRUS
TRATIONBUTWHO'SBITTER, all in all
the SF Sketchfest was a fine way to
spend a Thursday evening. With a full

acts. And ask Chris for nis autograph,

most simply answer by replying, "Dude,
haven't you ever seen 'SNL'?"
However, Joe Klocek, who was the
MC for the opening night, began the
show with some fine quality stand-up.
He delivered narratives including one
especially noteworthy account about
a masturbating bus-rider. If you can
believe it,"I hope my stop comes be-

tore he does," and,"I hope I get oft be
fore he does" weren't even the most
amusing parts of the, ahem, detailed
account. After the enjoyable stand-up
came the first sketch comedy team,
Hard N' Phirm. Although it started
strong with a multi-media sing-along
to a Spanish song about the heart
(ventricles in Spanish is way sexier in
English), it started to lose its steam
somewhere in the middle when the
sing-songs continued, but the novelty
wore off. Plus, Intermission was all the
while stressing out in trying to figure
out if That Guy Who Looks Like The
Guy From "Singled Out" really was the
guy from "Singled Out" (it was). Once
we heard the name Chris thrown

around and got the pun (Hard and
Phirm, get it, do you get it?),

we were satisfied.
Kasper Hauser was

the next act Of the

Four-man sketch

comedy troupe,

former

Review

(and current

proof that not

everyone goes

on to a repressed

corporate job after a

Stanford education). The

comedy, at

times, was wise

and erudite; at
others, there was a pudgy and shirtless
40-something man kung-fu-kicking a
white board that had "premature ejacula
tion" written on it in black marker. Never
theless, the overall

humor was smart — al
beit a bit straining at
times.
The act that followed
was Prank the Dean. The
youngest performers that
were on stage that
evening, the four boys
and one girl hailed from
UC-Santa Cruz and gave
the audience the neces
sary energy to make it to
intermission. Although
the general crowd didn't
pick up on the humor
right away, Intermission
found it hilarious from the
get go and judging by the
lauahter that followed as

iici u lUI lunuvvcu ao
the sketches went along, it seemed that
everyone else came around as well. Es
pecially funny was Jesse Thorn: We ex
pect him on "SNL" in the near future — if
it gets better any time soon, that is.
The penultimate act was a two-per
son female group called Clifford & Kidd,
which quite frankly really made Intermis
sion have to go the ladies' room — from
laughter, not antsy squirming. Maybe it's
the woman thing, but we're pretty sure
that Carrie Clifford and Amy Kidd just
freaking know funny. Dispersed
amongst their main sketches were short
vignettes of jaded darkly-clad models
smoking cigarettes and musing about
life in monotone one-liners. As Air played
in the background, we were exposed to

the darkest and most hysterical thoughts
of the painfully beautiful. Intermis-

sion could try and explain,

but they were so com-

plex in their simplici-

ty, we suggest

you just see

them on your

own. The act

ended with

a look into

two sepa-

rate con
versations:

a mother's

version of

life with

daughter to a

friend, and a

teenage daugh-

ter at the dinner

table backtalking to

her mother. The dispar-

ity of the inter-

action will

make you
laugh, remember your own angsty teen
years and laugh some more.
The finale was Killing My Lobster,
which despite being highly acclaimed,
felt like a step down from some of the

previous acts. The whole first sketch
had a great premise — a political candi
date who lost her election because of
her baby hands (no, really, you should
have seen her hands) but when it be
came clear that it was the only joke in
the whole skit, it grew old and consider
ably less hysterical. Nevertheless,
Killing My Lobster was enjoyable and
the San Francisco Sketchfest is certain
ly a wonderful way to spend an evening.
Even despite the ODnoxious red-head
ed couple sitting right behind us who
were consistently cueing each other's
over-exaggerated laughter to the point
the jokes were drowned out by FRUS
TRATIONBUTWHO'SBITTER, all in all
the SF Sketchfest was a fine way to
spend a Thursday evening. With a full
