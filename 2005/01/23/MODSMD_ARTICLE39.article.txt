## Interviews Canned Corn ... er, Scout Niblett 
### BONNIE JOHNSON INTERMISSION MUSIC CRITIC 
INTERMISSION: You're from Not
tingham, right? And you've toured the
States before? Do you have a favorite
place here?
SCOUT NIBLETT: I'm from Stratford
shire, but I lived in Nottingham for nine
years. This is my third year in a row
touring in the States. I would have to
go with either Chicago or here; I love
this part of California, but I'm also quite
attached to Chicago. I even got a
Chicago area code on my cell phone,
because I want to go back there.
INT: Chicago is where you worked
with Steve Albini, right?
SN: Right, his studio is there. I'm
going back there soon to record the
next album.

INT: What's it been like to work with him?
SN: It's been good, because the way I record is like a
show, like a live band, not a lot of work on the produc
tion, and Steve takes a really hands-off approach to
recording.
INT: Have I heard any of the songs that'll be on the next
album? And does it have a name?
SN: "Dare", from the EP, is going to be on the album.
But it's not had a name so far.
INT: You cover "Uptown Top Ranking" on your new
EP. What made you pick that song?
SN: It was the first single I bought as a kid. in 1979 or
something. I never get tired of it.
INT: How has touring been this time around?
SN: It's been fine. I just flew back from Europe, and I
only have a few dates left on this tour. I usually tour
alone, but we scheduled some of these dates with De
vendra Banhart at the last minute, and it's been quite
nice traveling with him and the band. They're really
wonderful. Usually we talk or read in the car.
INT: What are you reading?
SN: A book called 'Women Who Won the Wars."
INT: Your lyrics are beautiful. Are they personal to you?
SN: Yes, really they're all about love, whetherfor a par
ticular person or for life. I'm really just in love with life.
INT: You play both guitar and drums, and you alternate
between them at your shows. Do you have a prefer
ence for one?
SN: I bve them both, but I guess I've been quite ob
sessed with drums. Since I've been playing the drums,
ifs led to a different way of songwriting for me. I like the
drums because they're something to bash, but the guitar

is more focused.
INT: You always wear a blond wig to perform. Does it
possess magical properties?
SN: Yes, it's to do with the fact that I'm quite shy. I think
it helps to bring out the real me. When I put on the wig,
I'm "Scout," not Emma.
INT: You picked the name "Scout" from To Kill a Mock
ingbird, right 9
SN: Right. I especially love the film. Gregory Peck is
wonderful.
INT: Do you get sick of having people compare you to
Cat Power?
SN: I love her music, and I've played with her sever
al times. I think peopie make the comparison oe
cause of the similar emotional intensity, but lyrically
what we're saying is very different. Everyone comes
from a different place. Cat Power has been really
successful; she's been in the public eye for years, so
it's hard as a female solo musician to avoid being
called "another Cat Power." Even if we're not the
same, people don't really know what else to say, be
cause it's not like I sound like Joni Mitchell or P.J.
Harvey.
INT: Do you have any other projects going on right
now?
SN: Someone is going to animate my drawings into a
video. It's a long process, because it's all by hand. The
drawings are stick figures holding signs, and they say
things that are meaningful to me.
INT: Where are you staying when you're not touring or
recording these days?
SN: I had been staying in Philly, but I'm actually home
less now. I'd really like to come stay out here fora while.
INT: You can move into my co-op; no one will mind.
SN: Really? I might take you up on that.

But it's not had a name so far.
INT: You cover "Uptown Top Ranking" on your new
EP. What made you pick that song?
SN: It was the first single I bought as a kid. in 1979 or
something. I never get tired of it.
INT: How has touring been this time around?
SN: It's been fine. I just flew back from Europe, and I
only have a few dates left on this tour. I usually tour
alone, but we scheduled some of these dates with De
vendra Banhart at the last minute, and it's been quite
nice traveling with him and the band. They're really
wonderful. Usually we talk or read in the car.
INT: What are you reading?
SN: A book called 'Women Who Won the Wars."
INT: Your lyrics are beautiful. Are they personal to you?
SN: Yes, really they're all about love, whetherfor a par
ticular person or for life. I'm really just in love with life.
INT: You play both guitar and drums, and you alternate
between them at your shows. Do you have a prefer
ence for one?
SN: I bve them both, but I guess I've been quite ob
sessed with drums. Since I've been playing the drums,
ifs led to a different way of songwriting for me. I like the
drums because they're something to bash, but the guitar

is more focused.
INT: You always wear a blond wig to perform. Does it
possess magical properties?
SN: Yes, it's to do with the fact that I'm quite shy. I think
it helps to bring out the real me. When I put on the wig,
I'm "Scout," not Emma.
INT: You picked the name "Scout" from To Kill a Mock
ingbird, right 9
SN: Right. I especially love the film. Gregory Peck is
wonderful.
INT: Do you get sick of having people compare you to
Cat Power?
SN: I love her music, and I've played with her sever
al times. I think peopie make the comparison oe
cause of the similar emotional intensity, but lyrically
what we're saying is very different. Everyone comes
from a different place. Cat Power has been really
successful; she's been in the public eye for years, so
it's hard as a female solo musician to avoid being
called "another Cat Power." Even if we're not the
same, people don't really know what else to say, be
cause it's not like I sound like Joni Mitchell or P.J.
Harvey.
INT: Do you have any other projects going on right
now?
SN: Someone is going to animate my drawings into a
video. It's a long process, because it's all by hand. The
drawings are stick figures holding signs, and they say
things that are meaningful to me.
INT: Where are you staying when you're not touring or
recording these days?
SN: I had been staying in Philly, but I'm actually home
less now. I'd really like to come stay out here fora while.
INT: You can move into my co-op; no one will mind.
SN: Really? I might take you up on that.

INTERMISSION: You're from Not
tingham, right? And you've toured the
States before? Do you have a favorite
place here?
SCOUT NIBLETT: I'm from Stratford
shire, but I lived in Nottingham for nine
years. This is my third year in a row
touring in the States. I would have to
go with either Chicago or here; I love
this part of California, but I'm also quite
attached to Chicago. I even got a
Chicago area code on my cell phone,
because I want to go back there.
INT: Chicago is where you worked
with Steve Albini, right?
SN: Right, his studio is there. I'm
going back there soon to record the
next album.

INT: What's it been like to work with him?
SN: It's been good, because the way I record is like a
show, like a live band, not a lot of work on the produc
tion, and Steve takes a really hands-off approach to
recording.
INT: Have I heard any of the songs that'll be on the next
album? And does it have a name?
SN: "Dare", from the EP, is going to be on the album.
But it's not had a name so far.
