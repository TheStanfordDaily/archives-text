Would Martin Luther King Jr. have sup
ported the present struggle for gay rights in
America? Absolutely, argues Keith
Boykin. a former advisor to President Bill
Clinton who spoke at Tresidder last night
about the connection between the gay
rights movement and the civil rights move
ment of the 19605.
Boykin, president of the National Black
Justice Coalition, came to Stanford as part
of the annual Martin Luther King Jr. cele
bration sponsored by the Black Communi
ty Service Center.
He criticized blacks who oppose gay
rights, saying they are using the same argu
ments against homosexuals that whites
used against African Americans.
"Black ministers quote passages from


JOHN SHEN/The Stanford Dail
Boykin said that Martin Luther King Jr.
would have supported the present
struggle for gay rights in America.
Leviticus about it being a sin to lie
with another man, and yet many
southerners used quotes from the
Bible to justify slavery in the 19th
century," Boykin said. "They forget
that one of Dr. King's closest advi
sors, Bayard Rustin, was openly gay
and Dr. King was a very religious
man."
According to Boykin, discrimina
tion against gay people is perpetuat
ed by some of the most prominent
black leaders in America. He be
lieves it is a mistake to separate gay
rights from civil rights.
"A lot of people think of these
two issues differently," he said.
"Colin Powell claimed he was
against banning blacks from the mil
itary but not gays because sexual ori
entation is the most fundamental of
behavioral traits, whereas skin color
is a benign, non-behavioral trait. But
1 think that in America, skin color
has never been a benign trait. In
1948, they were arguing the exact
opposite to try and keep blacks out
of the military."
Boykin thought King would be in
complete support of the current
movement for equal rights for ho
mosexuals.
"King was all for challenging the
status quo and using power to
change things for the better," he
said. "A few years ago, a black
southern minister organized a march
against gay rights that started at
King's tomb, and I knew he must

Boykin:

have just been turning in his grave."
Many people fail to see the corre
lations between the two movements,
Boykin said, because the nature of
the struggles show differences.
"A lot of African Americans say.
Gay people don't have to sit at the
back of the bus, so it's not the
same,'" he said. "But women never
had to sit at the back of the bus. Nei
ther did disabled people. And yet
people support those groups having
equal rights."
Boykin concluded his talk with a
personal anecdote about faith.
"My grandmother was opposed
to my sexual orientation because
she was religiously conservative,"
he said. "And yet when my first
book was published, she made the
minister announce a local book
signing of mine."
"I think it was because she took
the message of the Bible to heart,
as Dr. King did — to love everyone
equally, no matter their race, reli
gion, or sexual orientation."
Boykin is the author most recent
ly of the book "Beyond the Down
Low: Sex, Lies and Denial in Black
America."
"Keith's message is central to our
mission," junior Anetl Okonkwo,
publicity coordinator of BCSC, said.
"Within the events of the celebra
tion, we wanted to represent all
kinds of diversity found within the
black community."
