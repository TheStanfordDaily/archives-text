# Welcome to the Bookstore, my name is Ben Dover and I'll be ringing up your returns

### TAM VO LOLLIPOP GUILD REPRESENTATIVE 
SETH: It's a really good place, a great
program ... Most people regret not
doing SLE, that's what I've heard.
INT: That's not what I've heard. So are
the girls in SLE hot?
SETH: Sure.
INT: What was the last non-required
reading you did, if any?
SETH: We 11... Not any this year
[three guesses as to why ]... but over
the summer, I read "Fast Food Nation"
and "House of the Spirits."
He looked kind of familiar
Student #27
Adam Isen, junior
INT: I see that you're returning "Mod
em Labor Economics"?
ADAM: Yeah, while reading it.
INT: Why the hell are you reading it?
ADAM: I ordered the book online and
haven't received it yet.
INT: I'll let that slide. Have you ever
bought a course reader, copied pages
and then returned it?
ADAM: No, I never buy course readers.
INT: I'm impressed. Do you have any
other suggestions for screwing over
the Bookstore?
ADAM: You should sign up for the on
line book trading / swapping sites.
INT: Do you still find girls at Stanford
attractive?
ADAM: Yeah, actually —I think that
the girl that's three people down from
me is pretty hot.
His first name is actually shorter than
mine
Student #30 in line
Zi Han Li, freshman
INT: I see that you're returning "A Con
cise History of Germany" by Mary Full
brook, second edition, Cambridge
Press.
ZI: Yeah.

'The Bookstore is a horrible, evil place
— even if my books cost the same on
line or somewhere else, I wouldn't buy
them here."
After overhearing this said numer
ous times, with numerous expletives,
while waiting in line this Tuesday (the
official last day to return your text
books), I decided to get the story be
hind this love-hate relationship that is
even older than the one we have with
PWR, the class that hates you back.
This is what happens when I decide to
ask random questions of random peo
ple waiting in the never-ending "returns
and exchanges" line at the Stanford
Bookstore. There is no greater bond
than that which unites students in their
hatred of overpriced course readers
and surly temporary cashiers.

Student # 63 in line
Seth Silverman, freshman
INT: Have you ever bought a course
reader, made copies and then re
turned it?
SETH: I don't believe I have.
INT: Where are your pants from?
[Note: They had multicolored woven
stripes. WITH cargo pockets]
SETH: Ecuador.
INT: When was the last time you had a
random hookup?
SETH: Never
INT: Not too talkative, are you? So why
did you wait until the last day to return
your books?
SETH: I didn't even know it was the
last day until someone told me today:
the urgency level was so much higher.
INT: Do you plan on reading any of the
books you bought?
SETH: Yeah.
INT: Wait, are you in SLE?
SETH: Yeah.
INT: That would explain it. Do you want
to debunk any myths about SLE?
