How do you tell about death and
tragedy in a way that will move the
viewer but not exploit the dead?

The San Fran
cisco Museum of
Modern Art has a
new installation by
Doris Salcedo,
"Atrabiliarios," that
is the most effective
presentation I've
ever seen of her
particular answer to
this question.
Salcedo was
born, and still re
sides, in Bogota,
Colombia. For the
last 20 years or so,
she has immortal-

ized the "disappeared" of Colom
bia's ongoing political violence
through the objects they leave be
hind. These are memorials made
from stacks of folded shirts with an
iron rod driven through them, furni
ture filled with cement and now,
shoes, singly and in pairs, placed
in holes cut into the wall and sealed
over with animal skin.
Initially, this might seem too ab
stract a representation for all the
grief and fear a family must feel
when their son or daughter or
mother or father is dragged away in
the middle of the night and never
seen again. I saw one visitor walk

like gravestones, each one mark
ing a single person's life and death.
Without any of the information with
which we mark graves, we share
fora brief moment in the families'
uncertainty. Who wore these solid
pumps, stable, older, confident?
How did she die? Where is the
woman who preferred the slightly
girlish Mary Janes now? Why is
there only one shoe of this pair? Is
it that the family couldn't bear to
give up even one more link to their
lost child?
In the final corner of the room is
a pile of empty boxes, also made of
animal skin. Others have de
scribed them as caskets, but I see

into the room, turn on his
toes to scan the walls,
shrug quizzically and
walk out. But this is an
installation that is meant
to be viewed at a more
funereal pace.
The holes in the wall
are about eye level. The

animal skin is translucent but not
transparent so the shoes have a
slightly ghostly quality to them.
Stripped of their function, never to
be worn again, their empty pres
ence haunts the living with the un
certainty of a death without a body,
without a record, without any infor
mation about when or where or

them as too small for such a func
tion. Instead, they look like archival
boxes, the kind that a family might
use to keep their photos or store a
child's first grade report card and
lovingly hand-made Valentine. Or
like the archival boxes in which
government records are stored,
where births and deaths and police

reports are filed away. The empti
ness of the archives here is both
the emptiness of all the photos that
will never be taken and the memo
ries that will never be made and the
emptiness of the official record,
which reveals

nothing about
these deaths.
The absence
here is the ab
sence of knowl
edge, the con
tinually haunting
uncertainty that
keeps grief
open and un
able to be
packed away.
The families of
the "disap
peared" have

neither the memories of a full and
happy life nor the closure of a
death certificate.
Taken slowly, this installation is
an opportunity to empathize, to try
and comprehend life lived in a
place without the daily secu r ities
we in the United States take for
granted. In using objects from
daily life Salcedo asks us to imag
ine those shoes as the shoes of
one of our loved ones and these
deaths as the deaths of people we
know. We cannot know the pri
vate, particular grief of any family,
and Salcedo doesn't try. Instead,
as we imagine our own grief she
asks us to remember that these

things happened
in real life to real
people whose
grief is beyond
our imagining.
She also asks
us to remember
that governments,
rebels and gangs
make people dis
appear, that we
should not and
cannot agree to

these monstrosities by allowing
these people to disappear from
memory as well.
Quiet though this installation
is, it is also a dangerous act of
defiance. Those who cause dis
appearances are trying to force
people into fear and silence. To
refuse to let the "disappeared"

be forgotten is to refuse to for
get the crimes that caused their
disappearance, and to demand
that eventually the truth be
known and justice be served.
With a dignity befitting a grave
yard and a formal beauty befit
ting a museum, Salcedo's "Atra

biliarios" quietly asks that we
take part in this defiance of
disappearance.
Doris Salcedo's "Atrabiliarios," is
currently on view on the second
floor of SFMoMA as part of the per
manent collection.
