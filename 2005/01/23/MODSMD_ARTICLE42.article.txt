## The 						Arcade Fire: Take that Avril 
### MIKE ORME INTERMISSION MUSIC CRITIC 
"So how do you like San Francisco?"
"What are you talking about? We're already in San Francisco, you
know."
So began and ended my attempt at conversation with Regine
Chassagne, one half of the husband-wife duo that fronts the or
chestra! rock group the Arcade Fire, as we prepared EPs to sell

at the show on Thursday. My friends and I had been invited to one
of the three sold-out shows the band played last week at the Great
American Music Hall on the condition that we prepare the band's
newly-printed EPs because my friend had gone to high school with
frontman Win Butler. Anyway, I could chalk Chassagne's misun
derstanding up to her quirky French-Canadian English dialect, but
more likely I'd blame it on my awkward conversation skills.
Such is the kind of banal perplexity that I seem to be experienc
ing with the Arcade Fire these days. I admit I have never under-

stood the praise for the Arcade Fire that critics have
heaped upon the band. The band's debut LP, "Fu
neral," has garnered tons of critical adoration, land
ing the group on top of many critics' year-end lists,

and David Byrne and David Bowie have sepa
rately called Arcade Fire shows their favorite in
years.

I, however, listen to Funeral's emotional take
Dn Byrne's new-wave and feel somewhat un
derwhelmed. I can't really even explain why, but
I liken it to the critical world em
bracing "Die Hard 2" as the greatest film of all
time: sure, ifs not bad, but what's with all the
fuss? With this mindset, I came to the concert
hoping to understand the praise heaped upon
the band.
The Arcade Fire took the stage around 9:30
p.m. after worthy openers Tycho Band Final
Fantasy. They greeted the audience with the
thunderous chorus of all members singing the
hymnal chant of "Wake Up" from Funeral. Im
mediately. The crowd took to the liturgy and
began chanting in unison to the band like a
Baptist congregation.

Next was the tribal, Talking Heads-esque
romp "Neighborhood 2 (Laika)." On the song,
Butler adopted a percussive yelp much like
David Byrne, sounding nothing like the man
who just before soundcheck was hacking
from a respiratory infection. The band ended
up playing through most of the tracks on "Fu
neral," some tracks from their 2003 self-titled
i EP and giving a rousing update of the Talk-

ing Heads' "This Must be the Place," before

closing with Funeral's "Neighborhood #2
(Tunnels)."

Throughout the show, I couldn't ig
nore the joy permeating both the
audience and the band. People
weren't coming to this show to
look cool, like they do at just about
every other S.F. show I attend;
rather, giddy teenagers and twen
ty-somethings came with their
mothers and fathers, a few odd

ducks said they paid the prohibitive
price to see all three Arcade Fire

shows that week, and yuppie 30-
and 40-somethings huddled in the cor-

— — —
ners; most importantly, everyone was
SMILING.

And the
band. The
band played
each track
with fiery in
tensity and

playful enthusiasm, bringing the eclectic instru
mentation of strings, marimbas and sometimes a
steel drum or accordion. Butler and Chassagne
spent the show locked in synchronization, staring
out at the audience and delivering their gospel

with zealous emotion.
There's a lot of misunderstanding and divi
sion in the world these days, but I feel comfort
able saying that the Arcade Fire show was truly
a unifying experience. Forget irony: these six
guys and one girl played like a family. Though
"Funeral" might stay out of heavy rotation in my
CD player, I feel that I understand the band's
emotional aim. At least now I know that if I'm
missing out, then I'm missing out on something
really special.

Chassagne, one half of the husband-wife duo that fronts the or
chestra! rock group the Arcade Fire, as we prepared EPs to sell

at the show on Thursday. My friends and I had been invited to one
of the three sold-out shows the band played last week at the Great
American Music Hall on the condition that we prepare the band's
newly-printed EPs because my friend had gone to high school with
frontman Win Butler. Anyway, I could chalk Chassagne's misun
derstanding up to her quirky French-Canadian English dialect, but
more likely I'd blame it on my awkward conversation skills.
Such is the kind of banal perplexity that I seem to be experienc
ing with the Arcade Fire these days. I admit I have never under-

stood the praise for the Arcade Fire that critics have
heaped upon the band. The band's debut LP, "Fu
neral," has garnered tons of critical adoration, land
ing the group on top of many critics' year-end lists,

and David Byrne and David Bowie have sepa
rately called Arcade Fire shows their favorite in
years.

I, however, listen to Funeral's emotional take
Dn Byrne's new-wave and feel somewhat un
derwhelmed. I can't really even explain why, but
I liken it to the critical world em
bracing "Die Hard 2" as the greatest film of all
time: sure, ifs not bad, but what's with all the
fuss? With this mindset, I came to the concert
hoping to understand the praise heaped upon
the band.
The Arcade Fire took the stage around 9:30
p.m. after worthy openers Tycho Band Final
Fantasy. They greeted the audience with the
thunderous chorus of all members singing the
hymnal chant of "Wake Up" from Funeral. Im
mediately. The crowd took to the liturgy and
began chanting in unison to the band like a
Baptist congregation.

Next was the tribal, Talking Heads-esque
romp "Neighborhood 2 (Laika)." On the song,
Butler adopted a percussive yelp much like
David Byrne, sounding nothing like the man
who just before soundcheck was hacking
from a respiratory infection. The band ended
up playing through most of the tracks on "Fu
neral," some tracks from their 2003 self-titled
i EP and giving a rousing update of the Talk-

ing Heads' "This Must be the Place," before

closing with Funeral's "Neighborhood #2
(Tunnels)."

Throughout the show, I couldn't ig
nore the joy permeating both the
audience and the band. People
weren't coming to this show to
look cool, like they do at just about
every other S.F. show I attend;
rather, giddy teenagers and twen
ty-somethings came with their
mothers and fathers, a few odd

ducks said they paid the prohibitive
price to see all three Arcade Fire

shows that week, and yuppie 30-
and 40-somethings huddled in the cor-

— — —
ners; most importantly, everyone was
SMILING.

And the
band. The
band played
each track
with fiery in
tensity and

playful enthusiasm, bringing the eclectic instru
mentation of strings, marimbas and sometimes a
steel drum or accordion. Butler and Chassagne
spent the show locked in synchronization, staring
out at the audience and delivering their gospel

with zealous emotion.
There's a lot of misunderstanding and divi
sion in the world these days, but I feel comfort
able saying that the Arcade Fire show was truly
a unifying experience. Forget irony: these six
guys and one girl played like a family. Though
"Funeral" might stay out of heavy rotation in my
CD player, I feel that I understand the band's
emotional aim. At least now I know that if I'm
missing out, then I'm missing out on something
really special.
