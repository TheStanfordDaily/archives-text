### MIKE ORME INTERMISSION HIPSTER 
Here's a (by no means exhaustive) listing of interesting soon-to-be
released albums, matched with a (by no means authoritative) hypo
thetical intersection of musical reference points.
If you like Iron & Wine and The Jesus and Mary Chain, you might
like:
Low — 'The Great Destroyer"
Release date: Jan. 25
Those of you familiar with Low know these Duluth, Minn., natives
have been the most popular of the "slow-core" acts. A quiet intro
spective and (of course) slow group, Low boasts a catalog whose pin
nacle, 1995's Long Division, should come with a warning label advis
ing not to operate heavy machinery while listening.
For the upcoming "The Great Destroyer," however, Low has re
versed course somewhat Having just signed to Sub Pop Records,
the band has hired veteran Flaming Lips producer Dave Fridmann
and have adopted parts of his sound, such as overdriven, effects
laden synth flourishes (cue "Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots"). Low
still retains its trademark minimalism on most tracks, thousi a few
tracks could even be described as "mid-tempo."
'The Great Destroyer" may not play as slow as Low's other work,
perhaps betraying Low's ultra-minimalist roots. But there's plenty to
satisfy fans of the band's previous work, and the lush instrumentation
and strong melodies on the album show that even after 10 years, Low
has more to offer the music world than putting listeners to sleep.
If you like My Bloody Valentine and Sigur Ros, you might like:
M83 —Until the Dawn Heals Us"
Release date: Jan. 25
The French duo's critically-acclaimed 2003 release Dead Cities,
Red Seas and Lost Ghosts restored my faith in shoegaze music by
recasting the characteristic "wall of sound' as shimmering synths
rather than layers of distorted guitar. On Until the Dawn Heals Us,
MB3 expands on their largely instrumental keyboard sound and fea
tures more guitar and vocals. On 'Don't Save me from the Flames,"
ethereal male /female vocals lay on top of a driving synth / guitar hook
that more strongly recalls MBVs Loveless than any recording I've
heard.
Though poised to cash in on their huge underground credit with an
other Dead Cities, MB3 has taken the respectable route of attempt
ing to evolve just as they have found success. Taking a gamble that
could have landed the group flat on its face, but MB3 succeeds ad
mirably in melding shoegaze rock and new age while adopting a
sound separate from that of its influences.
If you like Wilco and the Pixies, you might like:
The Frames — "Bum the Maps "
Release date: Feb. 8
Longtime Intermission readers reading this section may ask me why
I keep promoting The Frames. True, this is the third time covering the
band, and my only reply is that I liope browbeating my readership
about The Frames will at least influence some to check them out
"Burn the Maps," the band's first studio release in over
three years, treads back into harder territory mostly ignored
by 2001's folky "For the Birds." Most tracks
on "Burn the Maps," notably "Dream
Awake," build beautiful guitar dissonance
upon the simple foundations of quiet folk
hooks.

For those of you not up on your Irish pop cul
ture, The Frames are currently the most popular
band in Ireland and for 15 some-odd years and
have been playing edgy folk-influenced roots
rock seemingly unnoticed by the States. I'm be
ginning to suspect that The Frames will never
enjoy any measure of success in over here, but
I would be surprised to hear a prettier and more
mature study in Americana this year than the
Irish 'Bum the Maps."
