# RUSSIAN TO SHARE SOME VODKA: ROXY SASS
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS, MAMMAL LOVER 
"You ami me baby ain 'tnuthin but
mammals, so let V do it like they do on
the Diseovery Channel"
While mammals are busy hiber
nating, eating and sleeping through
the winter, the more intelligent, hotter
blooded ones have devised better
ways of occupying themselves when
confined to the indoors. That's right:
| vodka and sex. (The Russians had it
down centuries ago.) But. Roxy, you
| whine, my ski trip was CANCELLED
. . . what's my next to best option??
Rest easy, cubscout. With a little
change in attitude, your current dorm /
house can transform into your very
own Love Lodge.
For instance, take the old joke
Roxy's grandfather inappropriately
tells at the dinner table EVERY flu
season: "What better thing is there to
do when it's cold out?" (Uncomfort
ably followed by. "Don't look at me
like that. Where do you think YOU
came from?"... aaaand we're mov ing
on.)
So perhaps you've been spared the
vulgar sex talks with the family. Con
sider yourself lucky (and probably
American bom and bred). Even if you
have NO concept of your own concep
tion (and the pivotal roles of a
bearskin rug and lack of central heat
ing involved), don't forsake the cabin
fever and ignore the critical life lessons
Roxy has gained from such experi
ences. A Bacardi shot -margarita glass
beer bottle coat will only help your
flip-flopped feet and tank-topped ti...
uhh ... shoulders amble over so far to
some frat far as freak, in search of
lovin".
Given all recent circumstances
(tsunamis, extreme cold on campus,
sky rocketing oil prices), your toler
ance is just not up for such a challenge
and you need to find ways to rev your
own engine for less than $2 / gallon.
So, my lil' horny one. what now?
Well, let's get the obvious out of the
way. The most convenient, most avail
able and least complicated option is al
| ways self-reliance. God helps the man
[who helps himself — or something

like that (we talked about sex at the
dinner table, not church). So help
yourself. Roommate takes a shower
— hell, you've got five to 10 minutes
for the ultimate relief to reduce stress.
Then again, this is the time to really get
those cheeks Hushed and the blood
boiling with man-made substance and
man-made sex. Share the warmth. Lit
erally.
All things considered, location now
becomes of the utmost importance,
since you want to stay on your back as
much as possible. Roxy's friend this
weekend didn't want to walk to SAE
because of her blisters — but she also
kicked her roommate out for
'ALONE time." And she was alone
fora happy hour. In the middle of the
day. Roxy, on the other hand, has
other (cough cough) local friends, like
the one across Escondido Road, who
can be beckoned to come over and to
rub her feet — before moving, slowly
and with precision, on upward.
Roxy knows it's difficult to focus on
anything when shivering next to a bro
ken down, ghetto heater, all the while
panting like a dog in heat. These
arrangements and the stop-drop-and
roll to put out your fire buddies aren't
easy to come by when you're not get
ting out as much. Furthermore. Ms.
Sass is not suddenly recommending
immediate dormcest. Uh-uh. Do it
once, shame on him (or the alcohol),
but twice, shame on you for having to
see the big man feet, once in your twin
sized bed. now planted firmly in the
bathroom stall next to you. (Or at least
make sure thev don't live on the same
floor. AWKWARD.)
Then again, anything more than a
five minute walk away is already too
far to be exploring potential with that
cute guy who helps you do problem
sets. 'Cause there will be a morning
when your rose-filled cheeks and pur
ple-bruised neck will have to walk
back in shame (or stride in pride) —
but either way, the shorter the journey,
the better, when your tears of remorse
(or joy) are freezing to your face in the
cold.
So take Roxy's sage advice and find
someone who may roast your marsh
mallows, or better yet, can toast your
love mittens.

For instance, take the old joke
Roxy's grandfather inappropriately
tells at the dinner table EVERY flu
season: "What better thing is there to
do when it's cold out?" (Uncomfort
ably followed by. "Don't look at me
like that. Where do you think YOU
came from?"... aaaand we're mov ing
on.)
So perhaps you've been spared the
vulgar sex talks with the family. Con
sider yourself lucky (and probably
American bom and bred). Even if you
have NO concept of your own concep
tion (and the pivotal roles of a
bearskin rug and lack of central heat
ing involved), don't forsake the cabin
fever and ignore the critical life lessons
Roxy has gained from such experi
ences. A Bacardi shot -margarita glass
beer bottle coat will only help your
flip-flopped feet and tank-topped ti...
uhh ... shoulders amble over so far to
some frat far as freak, in search of
lovin".
Given all recent circumstances
(tsunamis, extreme cold on campus,
sky rocketing oil prices), your toler
ance is just not up for such a challenge
and you need to find ways to rev your
own engine for less than $2 / gallon.
So, my lil' horny one. what now?
Well, let's get the obvious out of the
way. The most convenient, most avail
able and least complicated option is al
| ways self-reliance. God helps the man
[who helps himself — or something

like that (we talked about sex at the
dinner table, not church). So help
yourself. Roommate takes a shower
— hell, you've got five to 10 minutes
for the ultimate relief to reduce stress.
Then again, this is the time to really get
those cheeks Hushed and the blood
boiling with man-made substance and
man-made sex. Share the warmth. Lit
erally.
All things considered, location now
becomes of the utmost importance,
since you want to stay on your back as
much as possible. Roxy's friend this
weekend didn't want to walk to SAE
because of her blisters — but she also
kicked her roommate out for
'ALONE time." And she was alone
fora happy hour. In the middle of the
day. Roxy, on the other hand, has
other (cough cough) local friends, like
the one across Escondido Road, who
can be beckoned to come over and to
rub her feet — before moving, slowly
and with precision, on upward.
Roxy knows it's difficult to focus on
anything when shivering next to a bro
ken down, ghetto heater, all the while
panting like a dog in heat. These
arrangements and the stop-drop-and
roll to put out your fire buddies aren't
easy to come by when you're not get
ting out as much. Furthermore. Ms.
Sass is not suddenly recommending
immediate dormcest. Uh-uh. Do it
once, shame on him (or the alcohol),
but twice, shame on you for having to
see the big man feet, once in your twin
sized bed. now planted firmly in the
bathroom stall next to you. (Or at least
make sure thev don't live on the same
floor. AWKWARD.)
Then again, anything more than a
five minute walk away is already too
far to be exploring potential with that
cute guy who helps you do problem
sets. 'Cause there will be a morning
when your rose-filled cheeks and pur
ple-bruised neck will have to walk
back in shame (or stride in pride) —
but either way, the shorter the journey,
the better, when your tears of remorse
(or joy) are freezing to your face in the
cold.
So take Roxy's sage advice and find
someone who may roast your marsh
mallows, or better yet, can toast your
love mittens.
"You ami me baby ain 'tnuthin but
mammals, so let V do it like they do on
the Diseovery Channel"
While mammals are busy hiber
nating, eating and sleeping through
the winter, the more intelligent, hotter
blooded ones have devised better
ways of occupying themselves when
confined to the indoors. That's right:
| vodka and sex. (The Russians had it
down centuries ago.) But. Roxy, you
| whine, my ski trip was CANCELLED
. . . what's my next to best option??
Rest easy, cubscout. With a little
change in attitude, your current dorm /
house can transform into your very
own Love Lodge.
