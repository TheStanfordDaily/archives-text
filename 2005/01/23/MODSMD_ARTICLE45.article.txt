INT (incredulous): Only once? I'm
lucky to get through one day without
falling asleep in a lecture. Or worse
yet, a seminar of 7 people. What
class was it?
ERICA: Math 106 —complex
variables.
One of them has two coffee table
books about coffee
Student # 45 and 46 in line, re
spectively:
Chris Nguyen, sophomore, ASSU
Senator
Hollis Moore, sophomore
INT: If you were going to write a mu
sical about one of the Supreme
Court justices, who would you
choose and why?
CHRIS: Does it have to be about a
Supreme Court justice?
INT: I guess not.
CHRIS: In that case, I'd do a musi
cal about the ASSU certification
debate.
INT: Who Would you cast as Dylan
Mefford?
CHRIS: A really tall, blonde person
— like Colin Mochrie from "Whose
Line is it Anyway?"
INT: I think you mean Ryan Stiles.
Colin Mochrie is Canadian. Don't
you think that Colin Mochrie is a lot
balder and funnier than Dylan?
CHRIS: I don't know, he wasn't
even at the hearing. And I won the
case for him.
INT: Have you ever bought a book
or course reader, copied pages
from it and then returned it?
HOLLIS: No, I mean, I probably
should, it'd make me more badass.
CHRIS: I've returned every book

that I bought this year.
INT: Chris, you sound like an au
thority on the subject. How do you
screw the Bookstore over?
CHRIS: It's an easy three-step
plan. One: Buy the book from on
the first day of the quarter. Two:
Buy a copy online on the same
day. Three: When the online book
arrives, pick the one in worse
condition and return that to the
Bookstore.
INT: Hollis, do you have any addi
tional tips?
HOLLIS: No, I'm just amused at
Chris's lack of morals. He's such a
good politician.
Upon reaching the front of the line
in a record 45 minutes, I decided to
speak up on behalf of my fellow
students.
INT: So, I've noticed that there
are seven cashiers waiting for all
the customers that are supposed
to be buying books right now
(meaning: none), and there are
two of you. Is that just me, or is
there a more efficient way of get
ting all of these books returned?
There's more than 75 people
here.
REFUND CASHIER [his nametag
read "Jamie"]: Um . . . those
cashiers over there aren't trained to
do refunds or exchanges. They can
only ring up purchases.
INT: That doesn't make sense —
are you guys just going slowly so
that people won't be able to return
their books in time?
CASHIER: [chuckles] That's a good
idea... we close at 8 p.m.
I noted that there were very few, if
any, seniors waiting in this line.
That's wisdom that will surely save
you an hour of your time — and
probably $500.
