# Faculty Senate wrestles with grant restrictions on â€˜objectionable' research
## 
### JEFFREY ERFE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Faculty Senate yesterday dis
cussed University negotiations with
the Ford Foundation over new grant
restrictions and debated potential
changes to the 2005-2006 academic
calendar. (A story in The Daily on
Monday will discuss the second item
from the meeting.)
University Provost John
Etchemendy announced that Stan
ford has reached an agreement with
the Ford Foundation over the re
search grant stipulations that the
foundation recently instituted to
comply with an executive order
against terrorism. Stanford faculty
will still he able to accept research
grants from the Ford Foundation,
but they must be aware that Univer
sity policies and the actions of other
faculty that violate these new restric
tions could cause the Ford Founda
tion to revoke their funds at any
time.
In 2001, President George W.
Bush signed Executive Order 13224,
which prohibited actions and trans
actions that may be construed as ter
rorism. As a result, a number of
foundations began to include in their
grant language certain new restric
tions to comply with this executive
order.
The restrictions vary widely in
form and scope from foundation to
foundation, but universally prohibit
the recipient of the grant from using
the funds to further terrorist activi
ties, and in some cases, other activi
ties that the foundation deems simi

larly objectionable, such as bigotry
or violence. The Ford and Rocke
feller Foundations imposed restric
tions that considerably exceed those
stipulated by the federal govern
ment.
The Ford Foundation requires
grant recipients to certify that they
"will not promote or engage in vio
lence, terrorism, bigotry or the de
struction of any State, nor will it
make subgrants to any entity that en
gages in these activities."
The Rockefeller Foundation re
quires grant recipients to certify that
they will not "directly or indirectly
engage in, promote, or support
other organizations or individuals
who engage in or promote terrorist
activity."
Etchemendy said that "of partic
ular concern is the fact that in a few
cases the reach of the restrictions is
not limited to the grant funds, but in
stead applies to all funds used by the
institution regardless of the source."
Both the Ford and Rockefeller
Foundations have made it clear that
they intend their restrictive language
to apply to all funds used by the Uni
versity, not just those provided by
the grant. Thus it applies to all
salaries, scholarships and, university
payments to outside vendbrs.
These restrictions also posed a
problem for Stanford researchers
who might have to censor their
speech or activities in order to pre
clude the possibility that their work
might be construed as terrorism.
ing these terms, hut University Pres
ident John Hennessy and
Etchemendy did not.
"We were concerned about sev
eral things," Etchemendy said.
"First of all. we would not accept a
gift or a grant if one of the conditions
of that award was a restriction of our
right to endorse controversial posi
tions such as affirmative action or
stem-cell research."
Furthermore, accepting these re
strictions on free speech and action
in order to receive grant money
would contradict Stanford's beliefs
in academic freedom, freedom of
speech and institutional autonomy,
Etchemendy said.
"Frankly, 1 would rather be able
to stand on the general principle
than enter into debates about specif
ic positions a donor finds offensive.

Accepting the Ford or Rockefeller
conditions would take away that
ability. We also had concerns about
the sanctions for violating the condi
tions, and continuing concerns
about what constituted 'official'
speech," Etchemendy said.
In October, Etchemendy and
Stanford's Board of Trustees
reached an agreement with the Ford
Foundation. The revised language
of the "side" letter still constrains
the official speech of the University.
However, Stanford has emphasized
that it will not significantly modify
its future behavior or retroactively
revise its previous actions and state
ments to comply with Ford's new re
strictions.
"We notified the Ford Founda
tion that although we do not antici
pate adopting positions that they

"We placed a moratorium on ac
cepting grants from the Ford Foun
dation or Rockefeller and on sub
mitting grant proposals to either of
these foundations while we contin
ued our negotiations," Etchemendy
said.
As of this date, Stanford has
made no significant agreement with
the Rockefeller Foundation that
would enable faculty to accept re
search grants from it. However,
Stanford has lifted the moratorium
on Ford Foundation funds.
In response to the concerns of
Stanford and other universities, the
Ford Foundation proposed to ac
company grants to universities with
a letter containing Ford's interpreta
tion of the new conditions. Some
universities felt comfortable accept-

University rejects restrictions, but
faculty can still take money on their own

consider violations of the condition
in question, we also do not intend to
modify our speech or require our
faculty to do so in order to comply
with that condition," Etchemendy
said.
Etchemendy ended by emphasiz
ing that faculty who receive a grant
from the Ford Foundation must ac
cept the risk that the University may
officially endorse a position that the
Foundation will find to be in viola
tion of the grant agreement and that
will jeopardize continued funding of
an existing Ford grant or future Ford
grant awards.
"Thus, the terms of a Ford grant
now can be violated by the Universi
ty, the principal investigator of the
grant, or a faculty member with no
relationship to the grant,"
Etchemendy said.

said.
As of this date, Stanford has
made no significant agreement with
the Rockefeller Foundation that
would enable faculty to accept re
search grants from it. However,
Stanford has lifted the moratorium
on Ford Foundation funds.
In response to the concerns of
Stanford and other universities, the
Ford Foundation proposed to ac
company grants to universities with
a letter containing Ford's interpreta
tion of the new conditions. Some
universities felt comfortable accept-

in question, we also do not intend to
modify our speech or require our
faculty to do so in order to comply
with that condition," Etchemendy
said.
Etchemendy ended by emphasiz
ing that faculty who receive a grant
from the Ford Foundation must ac
cept the risk that the University may
officially endorse a position that the
Foundation will find to be in viola
tion of the grant agreement and that
will jeopardize continued funding of
an existing Ford grant or future Ford
grant awards.
"Thus, the terms of a Ford grant
now can be violated by the Universi
ty, the principal investigator of the
grant, or a faculty member with no
relationship to the grant,"
Etchemendy said.
The Faculty Senate yesterday dis
cussed University negotiations with
the Ford Foundation over new grant
restrictions and debated potential
changes to the 2005-2006 academic
calendar. (A story in The Daily on
Monday will discuss the second item
from the meeting.)
University Provost John
Etchemendy announced that Stan
ford has reached an agreement with
the Ford Foundation over the re
search grant stipulations that the
foundation recently instituted to
comply with an executive order
against terrorism. Stanford faculty
will still he able to accept research
grants from the Ford Foundation,
but they must be aware that Univer
sity policies and the actions of other
faculty that violate these new restric
tions could cause the Ford Founda
tion to revoke their funds at any
time.
In 2001, President George W.
Bush signed Executive Order 13224,
which prohibited actions and trans
actions that may be construed as ter
rorism. As a result, a number of
foundations began to include in their
grant language certain new restric
tions to comply with this executive
order.
The restrictions vary widely in
form and scope from foundation to
foundation, but universally prohibit
the recipient of the grant from using
the funds to further terrorist activi
ties, and in some cases, other activi
ties that the foundation deems simi

larly objectionable, such as bigotry
or violence. The Ford and Rocke
feller Foundations imposed restric
tions that considerably exceed those
stipulated by the federal govern
ment.
The Ford Foundation requires
grant recipients to certify that they
"will not promote or engage in vio
lence, terrorism, bigotry or the de
struction of any State, nor will it
make subgrants to any entity that en
gages in these activities."
The Rockefeller Foundation re
quires grant recipients to certify that
they will not "directly or indirectly
engage in, promote, or support
other organizations or individuals
who engage in or promote terrorist
activity."
Etchemendy said that "of partic
ular concern is the fact that in a few
cases the reach of the restrictions is
not limited to the grant funds, but in
stead applies to all funds used by the
institution regardless of the source."
Both the Ford and Rockefeller
Foundations have made it clear that
they intend their restrictive language
to apply to all funds used by the Uni
versity, not just those provided by
the grant. Thus it applies to all
salaries, scholarships and, university
payments to outside vendbrs.
These restrictions also posed a
problem for Stanford researchers
who might have to censor their
speech or activities in order to pre
clude the possibility that their work
might be construed as terrorism.
ing these terms, hut University Pres
ident John Hennessy and
Etchemendy did not.
"We were concerned about sev
eral things," Etchemendy said.
"First of all. we would not accept a
gift or a grant if one of the conditions
of that award was a restriction of our
right to endorse controversial posi
tions such as affirmative action or
stem-cell research."
Furthermore, accepting these re
strictions on free speech and action
in order to receive grant money
would contradict Stanford's beliefs
in academic freedom, freedom of
speech and institutional autonomy,
Etchemendy said.
"Frankly, 1 would rather be able
to stand on the general principle
than enter into debates about specif
ic positions a donor finds offensive.

Accepting the Ford or Rockefeller
conditions would take away that
ability. We also had concerns about
the sanctions for violating the condi
tions, and continuing concerns
about what constituted 'official'
speech," Etchemendy said.
In October, Etchemendy and
Stanford's Board of Trustees
reached an agreement with the Ford
Foundation. The revised language
of the "side" letter still constrains
the official speech of the University.
However, Stanford has emphasized
that it will not significantly modify
its future behavior or retroactively
revise its previous actions and state
ments to comply with Ford's new re
strictions.
"We notified the Ford Founda
tion that although we do not antici
pate adopting positions that they

"We placed a moratorium on ac
cepting grants from the Ford Foun
dation or Rockefeller and on sub
mitting grant proposals to either of
these foundations while we contin

said.
