# Faculty Senate wrestles with grant restrictions on â€˜objectionable' research
## 
### JEFFREY ERFE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Faculty Senate yesterday dis
cussed University negotiations with
the Ford Foundation over new grant
restrictions and debated potential
changes to the 2005-2006 academic
calendar. (A story in The Daily on
Monday will discuss the second item
from the meeting.)
University Provost John
Etchemendy announced that Stan
ford has reached an agreement with
the Ford Foundation over the re
search grant stipulations that the
foundation recently instituted to
comply with an executive order
against terrorism. Stanford faculty
will still he able to accept research
grants from the Ford Foundation,
but they must be aware that Univer
sity policies and the actions of other
faculty that violate these new restric
tions could cause the Ford Founda
tion to revoke their funds at any
time.
In 2001, President George W.
Bush signed Executive Order 13224,
which prohibited actions and trans
actions that may be construed as ter
rorism. As a result, a number of
foundations began to include in their
grant language certain new restric
tions to comply with this executive
order.
The restrictions vary widely in
form and scope from foundation to
foundation, but universally prohibit
the recipient of the grant from using
the funds to further terrorist activi
ties, and in some cases, other activi
ties that the foundation deems simi

larly objectionable, such as bigotry
or violence. The Ford and Rocke
feller Foundations imposed restric
tions that considerably exceed those
stipulated by the federal govern
ment.
The Ford Foundation requires
grant recipients to certify that they
"will not promote or engage in vio
lence, terrorism, bigotry or the de
struction of any State, nor will it
make subgrants to any entity that en
gages in these activities."
The Rockefeller Foundation re
quires grant recipients to certify that
they will not "directly or indirectly
engage in, promote, or support
other organizations or individuals
who engage in or promote terrorist
activity."
Etchemendy said that "of partic
ular concern is the fact that in a few
cases the reach of the restrictions is
not limited to the grant funds, but in
stead applies to all funds used by the
institution regardless of the source."
Both the Ford and Rockefeller
Foundations have made it clear that
they intend their restrictive language
to apply to all funds used by the Uni
versity, not just those provided by
the grant. Thus it applies to all
salaries, scholarships and, university
payments to outside vendbrs.
These restrictions also posed a
problem for Stanford researchers
who might have to censor their
speech or activities in order to pre
clude the possibility that their work
might be construed as terrorism.
