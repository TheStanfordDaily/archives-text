# South Asian film week: beyond Bollywood
## 
### JENNIFER LIU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When South Asian cinema is
mentioned, often the first thing to
come to mind is Bollywood, the wild
ly popular genre of Indian movies.
"South Asian cinema always
reminds people of actors and ac
tresses running around trees
singing love songs," said senior
Shalini Ahmed, co-chair of San
skriti, Stanford's South Asian stu
dent organization.
Debunking these stereotypes is a
goal of the second annual South
Asian Awareness Week, the theme
of which is "Seeing South Asia:
Awareness through Film and
Media," organizers said. Each day of
the festival, which is sponsored by
Sanskriti, has a different theme anil
topic. Sanskriti's Cultural and South
Asian Issues Committee Co-Chairs
sophomores Natasha Dar and
Supriya Misma invited several direc
tors to screen and discuss their works
throughout the week.
Last year was the first time San
skriti held a weeklong event that fo
cused on South Asian culture, in
cluding discussions, forums and a
lecture by Political Science Prof.

Scott Sagan about security issues in
South Asia. This year, Ahmed said.
Sanskriti tried to broaden its reach
by focusing on South Asia, rather
than just India.
"We're directing the events at
both the South Asian community as
well as the larger Stanford communi
ty itself," she said. "The theme of this
year was not an isolated South Asian
community, which doesn't function
in the real world and isn't really
healthy. One of our goals this year is
to work with other groups."
Sanskriti is planning an event in
February with the Black Student
Union.
Ulka Anjaria, a Ph.D. candidate
in the department of Modern
Thought and Literature, delivered
the keynote address on Monday, ad
dressing the themes of identity that
were also portrayed in the following
days' films. She also discussed the
issue of the South Asian Diaspora,
which was a focal point in Wednes
day night's movie "Monsoon Wed
ding."
Screenings of the themed movies
began on Tuesday, which addressed
the theme of queer issues and identi
ty. The lunchtime film was "Flesh
and Paper," a documentary about

Indian lesbian poet and writer Suniti
Bamjoshi. Later that night, "Chut
ney Popcorn," a movie about LGBT
identity, motherhood and family ties
was screened, followed by a discus
sion with lead actress and director
Nisha Ganatra.
Wednesday's theme was "Kin
ship and Marriage," which covered
the stereotype of arranged mar
riages. The documentary "Some
Kind of Arrangement," screened at
lunch, focused on contemporary
young professionals contemplating
modern arranged marriages. "Mon
soon Wedding," a critically ac
claimed film that achieved world
wide success, was shown in the
evening followed by a student panel
discussion.
" Monsoon Wedding' also ad
dresses the Diaspora, but it's also
about identity," Ahmed said.
"Again, it's looking beyond the fa
cade; a group of people who have
been abroad come together fora
wedding in India, but at the end of
the day, they're still South Asian."
Yesterday's movies, "Miss India
Georgia" and "Pyaasa," focused on
the theme of "Expectations and
Struggle." "Miss India Georgia," a
documentary, trails beauty contes

tants as they prepare for the annual
South Asian beauty pageant, held in
Atlanta, Ga. "Pyaasa," a 1957
movie, will be followed by a discus
sion with Huma Dar, a researcher
from the University of California,
Berkeley.
"Many South Asian films really
delve into subjects like contempo
rary issues and identity," Ahmed
said. "We're trying to feature South
Asian movies that focus on issues
which don't often receive as much at
tention when people mention South
Asian cinema."
The movie "American Desi" will
be shown today at 3:30 p.m. in Build
ing 260-113 to correspond with the
theme of "Here and Now," followed
by a discussion with writer and direc
tor Piyush Pandya.
Tonight, Sanskriti will be hold
ing the Raas for Relief dance in
Toyon Lounge at 8:00 p.m. Raas is
a traditional Indian folk dance
from the Gujarat region performed
with twirling sticks, and the annual
charity event consists of a work
shop and then open dance. Dona
tions are accepted, and all pro
ceeds will go toward relief efforts
in South Asia for the victims of the
Dec. 26 tsunamis.
