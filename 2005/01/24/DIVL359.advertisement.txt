ENFORCING THE PEACE
Learning from the Imperial P**l

The Trouble with Ed Schools by David Labaree
American schools of education get little respect. They are portrayed as intellectual wastelands, as impractical and irrelevant as the root cause of bad teaching
and inadequate learning. In this hook, a sociologist and historian of education examines the historical developments and contemporary factors that have
resulted in the unenviable status of ed schools, offering valuable insights into the problems of these beleaguered institutions. Throughout these discussions,
Labaree maintains an ambivalent position about education schools-admiring their dedication and critiquing their mediocrity, their romantic rhetoric, and their
compliant attitudes.
Labaree is a professor in the School of Education at Stanford University.

From First Kicks to First Steps by Dr. Alan Greene
Already a trusted source of advice for millions of parents through his popular childcare website, Dr. Greene answers all your questions from your pregnancy
through your baby's first birthday, including: Does a fetus dream? Yes, as early as 26 weeks after conception. How can I get my child to like vegetables? You
can get your child to enjoy vegetables with what you eat during pregnancy and while breastfeeding! How soon can I get my baby to sleep through the night?
You can start to get your baby accustomed to nighttime sleep while still in the womb.
Dr. Greene teaches pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine, and his website www.drgreene.com, is immensely popular.

Enforcing the Peace: Learning from the Imperial
Past by Kimberly Zisk Marten
Focusing on operations in Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor in the mid-to late 19905, while touching on the military occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq,
this daring new work argues that modem peacekeeping operations and military occupations bear some surprising resemblances to the imperialism practiced
by liberal states a century ago. Kimberly Zisk Marten draws lessons from that comparison, arguing that attempts by outsiders to control political developments
in foreign societies arc pipe dreams, and that a more sensible goal of foreign intervention is to provide basic security in unstable regions.
Kimberly Zisk Marten is an associate of political science at Barnard College, Columbia University.
