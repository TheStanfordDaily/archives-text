ford University Hospital after being
struck by a Caltrain near the Encinal
Avenue railroad crossing in Menlo
Park. A memorial will be held today

Jayme Kunz, a spokesperson for

Pringle may have waited for the
train to pass and then jumped direct
ly into the locomotive.
An autopsy was conducted
Wednesday. San Mateo County

Pringle's death is being investigated
as a possible suicide. An official rul
ing may be made as early as this
week, once additional information is

an MBA from the Kellogg School
of Management at Northwestern
University.
Pringle served as associate vice
president and director of develop
ment marketing for Stanford's Of
fice of Development from Decem
ber 1997 to November 2002.
"From the first day he arrived
on the Farm as a freshman in the
fall of 1968. Bob loved Stanford,"
said Vice President for Develop
ment John Ford. "He devoted
much of his incredible energy to
Stanford, first as a volunteer and
then as a senior officer of the uni
versity. Bob played a major role in
the development of The Stanford
Fund and helped shape the Think
Again tour, which carried the mes
sage of Stanford's renaissance in
undergraduate education to alum
ni and friends around the country."
"As associate vice president for
development and as an active
member of the Campaign for Un
dergraduate Education (CUE) Ex
ecutive Committee, Bob con
tributed in many ways to Stan
ford's recent achievement of
CUE's $1 billion goal. Bob's death
leaves a tremendous void in the Of
fice of Development family," Ford
said.
The prominent Bay Area mar

keting and communications pro
fessional will be remembered for
his commitment to his family and
the University.
"Bob was such a tremendous
support for everyone," said his
wife Maggie in Pringle's obituary.
"He was always willing to help any
one who was in need. I could not
have asked fora more supportive
husband, and I don't think you
could find a more supportive fa
ther."
"Bob's love and enthusiastic
support of Stanford were evident
in everything he did," said Univer
sity President John Hennessy.
"This made him a great treasure to
have in our midst: first as a student,
then as a supporter and volunteer
and.finally, as associate vice presi
dent."
While actively serving his com
munity. Pringle's relationship with
the Holy Trinity Episcopal Church
in Menlo Park became one of his
most meaningful involvements.
Pringle and his family also have
deep affiliations with Menlo
School in Atherton, Calif., from
which two of his children graduat
ed and his youngest child is cur
rently a senior. Maggie Pringle
served as the president of the
Menlo School Association, and
Pringle's father-in-law served on
the Menlo School Board of
Trustees.
"Bob was a source of great in
sight," said Norman Colb, head of

Pringle served as
associate vice president

school at Menlo School. "He
served on an advisory committee,
helping us think through our ap
proach to development and com
munications by contributing very
astute ideas. Bob had a deep un
derstanding about how communi
ties form and work."
"The Pringle family enjoys the
respect and affection of a large
number of people in many differ
ent communities," Colb said. "The
outpouring of affection testifies to
the number of lives this family
touches. As a family the Pringles
truly make Menlo School and this
world better."
Bob is survived by his wife,
Margaret Ely Pringle: his children
Abby, David and Will Pringle; his
mother. Janet Pringle of Portola
Valley; and his mother- and father
in-law, Shirley and Leonard Ely of
Palo Alto.
Pringle was a member of the
