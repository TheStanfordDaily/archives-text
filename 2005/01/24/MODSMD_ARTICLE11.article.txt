# Playing it Straight
## Doing the Fandango 
### 
This week, in the spirit of the
NFL post-season, we've de
cided to tackle an issue that
hits close to home (field ad
vantage). To put it more eloquently,
we've decided to open the column with
a horrible pun and then discuss product
placement.
Yes, product placement. These days
it's pretty much everywhere (you want
to be). That's right — you and your
VISA card are hard pressed to watch a
television program, go to the movies or
even walk down the street without
being bombarded by advertisements
and clever slogans. Any which way you
turn, you're sure to be subjected to
some kind of Catch Phrase — that's the
hilarious fast-talking game from Parker

Brothers.
The big
question is how
to deal with it
all. Some peo
ple simply hate
it, and would
love nothing
more than to
wake up in an
advertising-free
world where
one can actually
make an unbi
ased decision.
For others, the
best part of

waking up is Folger's in their cups. It's
delicious, hut we're not so sure that it's
up to the Maxwell House standard.
That stuff really is good 'til the last drop!
The two of us don't really mind all
this product placement and advertising.
You see, we really love goods and ser
vices. Goods are good, and services are,
well, good, too. And without all these
great products to keep us company,
we'd be lonelier than the Maytag re
pairmen.
Herein lies our dilemma. There's so
much untapped potential for product
placement at Stanford, and it breaks
our little hearts to see it go to waste.
Some days we make it to class and back
without consciously taking in a single
advertisement.
When we arrive back at our suite, we
simply don't know what to buy, and so
we have to resort to shopping for shoes
online at Zappos.com. Consequently,
we have some pretty cool shoes, but at
the end of the day shoes are just shoes
(and we're not women).
Most of you are probably cringing at
the idea of professors getting paid to
sell you stuff or seeing billboards plas
tered across the top of MemChu. Fear
not — this is not what we had in mind.
We're talking high-tech advertising,
like in sports where they digitally plas
ter logos across the field. Well, the
blackboard is the playing field of
academia. Let's plaster some logos on
that one over the SITN broadcast (or
on the actual board, while we're at it).
And professors should wear fancy
costumes like NASCAR drivers do,
with patches and stickers all over the
place. It might even help some of the
slower ones pick up the Pace (Picante
Sauce) on their dreary lectures.
If you think about it. most profes
sors are already trying to sell you some
thing, usually their own boring book.
The clever ones make a joke out of it on
the first day of class by making fun of
the fact that you have to read it. Don't
fall for this; they are just damned good
salesmen.
And this really highlights the prob
lem with most advertising and product
placement. It's irritating because peo
ple generally try to sell you things that
you don't want, especially books. But
when you see an ad for something you
really want, you appreciate it. Product
placement is the perfect medium.
For example, remember that
Sylvester Stallone movie. "Demolition
Man"? It had a lot of Taco Bell ads, and
they made the movie great because ev
eryone who likes Sylvester Stallone
loves Taco Bell. We're confident that
there are a lot of things Stanford kids
would love if they were only properly
introduced.
To make a short column short, prod
uct placement is just about putting the
right things in the right place at the right
time. Fundamentally, it's quality con
trol. We need product placement, but
the people in charge need to be choosy
about what to place. Just remember,
choosy moms choose J if.
Chew on that. Trident.
