# The
						Raging Grannies
## With a sense of humor and 'grandma's clothes,' these women are giving peaceful protests a new look 
### MICHAEL TAMKIN 
You may have noticed them on the front lines of a peace
rally, environmental conservation march or a civil liberties
demonstration, singing songs while wearing outlandish out
fits. They are the San Francisco Peninsula Raging Grannies,
an activist group whose mission is to promote peace and jus
tice.
The first Raging Grannies group was established in 1986
in British Columbia, Canada, to protest nuclear submarines.
Since then, chapters of the group have sprung up around the
world. In 2001, the Raging Grannies came to the Bay Area.
The group is an offshoot of the Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom, which was established in
1915.
While their activities take them all over the Peninsula,
the Raging Grannies are regulars at events in Palo Alto
and occasionally stop at Stanford. Many of the members
have Stanford ties. Some have spouses who teach at Stan
ford. some are alumni and all share a common goal of mak
ing a difference using songs, theatrical skits and a sense of
humor.
"We're constantly fighting, and we're a presence you
can't ignore," said Granny Ruth Robertson.
Since 2001, the Grannies have protested the War in Iraq,
the death penalty, military recruiting at Palo Alto High
schools and racial profiling at more than 150 rallies. They
also came to the Stanford Campus in 2003 to protest Con
doleezza Rice's speech at Commencement.
According to Robertson, what really changed things and
"got us out on the streets" were the terrorist attacks of Sept.
11,2001.
"Not what happened but what happened in the after
math," Robertson said. "A lot of women our ages felt like
we have to do more than sit around and write letters to pa
pers. The political climate has gotten us together."
In February, the Grannies will come to campus to speak
to a Program in Writing and Rhetoric class. Lecturer Shay
Brawn invited the Grannies to speak to her class in a pre
sentation entitled "War Toys: How We Can Rid Them
From Our Society."
Brawn's class, "The Rhetoric of Play," focuses on how
"play activities operate on us rhetorically, persuade us of
particular values, world views and even truths."
"They have this whole initiative against war toys that is
premised on how such toys shape our attitudes about war,"
Brawn said.
Not only are the Grannies of interest to the class for their
message, but also for their unusual methods of persuasion.
Brawn said she also invited them because they use "a vari
ety of interesting forms for getting out their message â€” cre
ating peace sculptures, doing street theater and singing
satirical songs."
Part of the group's appeal and effectiveness stems from

its seemingly benign appearance. Robertson said one of her
most memorable moments is when the group participated in
a 1,000-person march when President George W. Bush
came to speak at the Santa Clara Convention Center in May
of 2003.
In one picture that appeared in newspapers, the group
was "being held back by riot police," Robertson said. "Do
they need to hold us back? One of the women is in a wheel
chair. Why does W. need to be protected from old ladies
who are singing?" she said.
A recent addition to the Grannies, Carol Vesecky, grad
uated from Stanford in the mid-19605. After the 2004 presi
dential election she joined the group to "protest publicly."
"In 2004, in an attempt to help change the country's di

rection as regards the war, the environment, education,
economy and social issues, I got involved politically,"
Vesecky said. "I enjoyed expressing my views through song,
and it seemed to he a great way to finally attract media at
tention to the election fraud case."
Robertson believes the name "Raging Grannies" and
the wearing of unusual clothes originated from a Monty
Python skit.
"We feel braver when we're in costume," Robertson
said. "It gives us a shtick to get our message out."
While most of the members are 60 to 80 years old. the
group also welcomes younger women and men.
"We don't specifically say you have to be a certain age or
even be a woman," she said. "We cross all barriers."
