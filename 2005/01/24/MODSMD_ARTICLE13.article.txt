## West of Center What kind of conservative are you? 
### KAI STINCHCOMBE 
If you're a campus conservative,
you're all the rage these days. Egged
on hy your grown-up hackers, the
media is going gaga over your resur
gence.
You're cool and rebellious he
cause you're going against the sys
tem. Ten times as many Web pages
talk about you as "campus liberals."
In order to help you get a handle
on the latest phenomenon to hit
campus — you — we've put togeth
er a profile ol the three types of cam
pus conservatives: winners, charis
matic conservatives and hell-raisers.
See which type is the best match for
you.
You can read the profiles aloud
and then try to guess what category
your like-minded friends and neigh
bors are in. or make it an activity at
your conservative political group
meeting.
The Whiner
You feel like the system is
stacked against you. From the mo
ment you step onto campus you feel
oppressed. People look at you differ
ently. Your perspective isn't respect
ed in class. You have a hard time
finding people like you.
You are more anti-liberal than
pro-conservative. You describe the
fact that the most educated, eco
nomically productive, attractive,
and interesting people in our coun
try typically arrive at the same polit
ical conclusions with two words: lib
eral bias.
If you get a bad grade or don't
have any friends it's not because you
need to work harder, it's because
you were treated unfairly. You think
that unqualified conservatives
should be given academic jobs in
order to make the faculty more "rep

resentative.
If this describes you: Your strate
gi/.ing about "exposing bias" will get
you nowhere. Though you think
you'll be more accepted once you
get off campus, if you don't change
now you'll never be anything more
than a whiner.
You can't start demanding sensi
tivity training and affirmative action
and "balance" quotas as soon as you
become an oppressed minority. Get
over your politics and show some
personal responsibility, or you'll
make a career of not being taken se
riously by the people who got the job
you couldn't get. just like David
Horowitz.
I he Charismatic Con
You're not a policy wonk. Your
thefacebook.com, profile may list
you as anything from moderate to
very conservative, or may not list
your political views at all. You make
friends easily, and you don't mind
drinking and sex.
You're probably going to end up
with a crappy job that makes a lot of
money. You're successful at most
things you try, so you're suspicious
of anything that gets in your way —
including the government. You
probably believe in evolution and
don't think abortion is murder.
If this describes you: The Repub
lican Party is an alliance of libertari
ans, tycoons, hawks, evangelicals
and bigots. You libertarians are
being taken fora ride.
Instead of running for president
of your frat or sorority, think about
getting involved in something more
political. If you can't stomach the
whiny conservatives, find a group
dominated by the third category,
and lend your social skills to make it
successful.

The Hell-raiser
You love the challenge of being
on a college campus. You unapolo
getically oppose affirmative action,
think taxation is theft, and / or
blame the hippies for losing the war
in Vietnam. You are hawkish and
patriotic. You know most campus
liberals don't have the facts to sup
port their arguments and relish the
chance to point it out to them.
Although you may be very con
servative. you are pragmatic in your
stances. You don't follow the party
line, but still manage to piss people
off with every sentence. You know
that you won't convert most people
to conservatism, but still think it's a
good thing for people to question
their preconceptions. You believe in
debate.
You favor clever, innovative
ways to attract attention. You don't
think "Hey hey, ho ho, Social Secu
rity has got to go" is a good slogan,
and anyway you wouldn't feel natu
ral chanting slogans at a campus
rally — or a rally anywhere.
You go for elegance, particularly
the sort of elegance that rattles the
administration, becomes a national
news story and maybe results in a
ton of donations to your group. You
admire the Dartmouth Bestiality So
ciety and whoever thought of affir
mative action bake sales.
If this describes you: You are the
reason your party is doing so well.
Young far-lefties could learn a lot
from you. But race baiting is getting
old. Move on to national security.
Figure out some elegant way to ex
pose the U.N. or something.

you were treated unfairly. You think
that unqualified conservatives
should be given academic jobs in
order to make the faculty more "rep

resentative.
If this describes you: Your strate
gi/.ing about "exposing bias" will get
you nowhere. Though you think
you'll be more accepted once you
get off campus, if you don't change
now you'll never be anything more
than a whiner.
You can't start demanding sensi
tivity training and affirmative action
and "balance" quotas as soon as you
become an oppressed minority. Get
over your politics and show some
personal responsibility, or you'll
make a career of not being taken se
riously by the people who got the job
you couldn't get. just like David
Horowitz.
I he Charismatic Con
You're not a policy wonk. Your
thefacebook.com, profile may list
you as anything from moderate to
very conservative, or may not list
your political views at all. You make
friends easily, and you don't mind
drinking and sex.
You're probably going to end up
with a crappy job that makes a lot of
money. You're successful at most
things you try, so you're suspicious
of anything that gets in your way —
including the government. You
probably believe in evolution and
don't think abortion is murder.
If this describes you: The Repub
lican Party is an alliance of libertari
ans, tycoons, hawks, evangelicals
and bigots. You libertarians are
being taken fora ride.
Instead of running for president
of your frat or sorority, think about
getting involved in something more
political. If you can't stomach the
whiny conservatives, find a group
dominated by the third category,
and lend your social skills to make it
successful.

The Hell-raiser
You love the challenge of being
on a college campus. You unapolo
getically oppose affirmative action,
think taxation is theft, and / or
blame the hippies for losing the war
in Vietnam. You are hawkish and
patriotic. You know most campus
liberals don't have the facts to sup
port their arguments and relish the
chance to point it out to them.
Although you may be very con
servative. you are pragmatic in your
stances. You don't follow the party
line, but still manage to piss people
off with every sentence. You know
that you won't convert most people
to conservatism, but still think it's a
good thing for people to question
their preconceptions. You believe in
debate.
You favor clever, innovative
ways to attract attention. You don't
think "Hey hey, ho ho, Social Secu
rity has got to go" is a good slogan,
and anyway you wouldn't feel natu
ral chanting slogans at a campus
rally — or a rally anywhere.
You go for elegance, particularly
the sort of elegance that rattles the
administration, becomes a national
news story and maybe results in a
ton of donations to your group. You
admire the Dartmouth Bestiality So
ciety and whoever thought of affir
mative action bake sales.
If this describes you: You are the
reason your party is doing so well.
Young far-lefties could learn a lot
from you. But race baiting is getting
old. Move on to national security.
Figure out some elegant way to ex
pose the U.N. or something.

If you're a campus conservative,
you're all the rage these days. Egged
on hy your grown-up hackers, the
media is going gaga over your resur
gence.
You're cool and rebellious he
cause you're going against the sys
tem. Ten times as many Web pages
talk about you as "campus liberals."
In order to help you get a handle
on the latest phenomenon to hit
campus — you — we've put togeth
er a profile ol the three types of cam
pus conservatives: winners, charis
matic conservatives and hell-raisers.
See which type is the best match for
you.
You can read the profiles aloud
and then try to guess what category
your like-minded friends and neigh
bors are in. or make it an activity at
your conservative political group
meeting.
The Whiner
You feel like the system is
stacked against you. From the mo
ment you step onto campus you feel
oppressed. People look at you differ
ently. Your perspective isn't respect
ed in class. You have a hard time
finding people like you.
You are more anti-liberal than
pro-conservative. You describe the
fact that the most educated, eco
nomically productive, attractive,
and interesting people in our coun
try typically arrive at the same polit
ical conclusions with two words: lib
eral bias.
If you get a bad grade or don't
have any friends it's not because you
need to work harder, it's because
you were treated unfairly. You think
that unqualified conservatives
should be given academic jobs in
order to make the faculty more "rep
