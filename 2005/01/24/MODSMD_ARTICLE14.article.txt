# Student Pet Peeves
## Has anyone come down with the flu? 
### YAMANDA WRIGHT 
It has been established that I am
a germ-o-phobe. My friends have
told me more than once that my
debilitating uneasiness with greasy
handprints and unidentifiable liq
uids is less than normal.
I gaze admiringly at co-eds who
dare to walk barefoot on the house
kitchen floor after a particularly
rowdy Thursday night dinner. The
last time I even had full hands-on
contact with a doorknob, I was
sleepwalking.
However, this was not always
the case. Until fall quarter of my
freshman year, I was completely
normal. My relationship with
germs was not a phobia but a gen
tle rivalry in which I was mildly op
posed to disease and we (germs
and I) had agreed to disagree.
As a lazy person, I was prone to
drinking from my neighbor's foggy
Nalgene to avoid walking all 10 feet
to the nearest drinking fountain. As
a starving student, the infamous
Five-Second Rule had been my
dogma. Any Cheez-it that had not
been on the floor for more than five

seconds was fair game, but after
that, the carpet critters set in and the
Cheez-it was abandoned.
All of this carefree living ended
abruptly at the outset of my first
college midterm many quarters
ago. 1 had done everything advised
by the Undergraduate Advising
Center. 1 had studied (sort of),
showered and gone to sleep early
the night before. Everything
seemed in order until I woke up the
next morning with a mind full of
Jeopardy facts about cognitive psy
chology, a migraine that felt like
my brain was pounding its way out
of my eye sockets and a throat full
of fun-killer.
The UAC forgot to mention
that the first step to academic and
social success at Stanford is "Don't
touch anything."
And there in my congested,
cough-drop misery began my fixa
tion with identifying anything that
could possibly contain the flu and
with reciting an endless stream of
statistics about how many microor
ganisms there are on the buttons of
my drawmates' remote control. I
have become fascinated with such

scandals as the super-bacteria
paradox of antibacterial gel hand
cleanser and the immortal glob of
shampoo on the communal shower
wall that seems to survive every
bathroom cleaning each week.
The college student must come
to accept the fact that she is both a
breeding ground and motor vehi
cle for germs. Her days of "never
getting sick" and using Kleenex
only to wipe her marker board end
the day she picks up her room key.
Before 1 completely ruin my
chance of making new friends, let
me redeem myself and say that
these efforts have been futile. De
spite all of my crafty attempts at
avoiding infection. 1 am now silting
at my desk amidst a sea of tissue
and wasted precautions. 1 am sick,
and there is nothing that gloves
and $8 hand soap can do to save me
now.
