Choosing how to vote should not
be done just to be contrarian
The chief merit of Ben Ho's
"Intolerable Intolerance" column
is its unintentionally astute title
"Irrational Exuberance" — for the
words that follow are exactly that.
Ho characterizes his decision to
vote for Bush in a way more ap
propriate to the defense of wear
ing an Ashlee Simpson t-shirt at a
Bad Religion concert: the courage
to support unpopular viewpoints
in a hostile environment.
More disturbingly, he details
how he "feared" articulating his
(arguably) political orientation be
cause it might cost him his reader
ship. It is exactly this attitude on
behalf of political minorities (on
campus, at least) that breeds igno
rance and intolerance.
An articulate, persuasive, pas
sionate account on the merits of

the President over his opponent
would have been a suitable balanc
ing mechanism to the coverage of
the anti-Bush protests on Thurs
day.
Instead, Ho provides a slapdash
and misleading account of Bush's
political appointments and social
policies, which culminates in his
bizarre admission that "main rea
son" he voted for Bush was to be
able to "say things" tending to
ward the political asymmetry of
this campus and to "provoke
thought and introspection."
A vote is not like a speech, rally,
or lecture. A vote determines who
will lead the United States of
America for the next four years.
Letting your decision of whom to
vote for be decided by any factor
other than who you believe to be
the best suited to confront the prob
lems in American society today is
simply irresponsible behavior fora
citizen of any political persuasion.

My fundamental opposition to
his unilateral foreign policy, stead
fast belief in women's right to
choose, discomfort with re-inte
gration of church and state, and
distaste for simultaneous tax cuts
for the wealthy and astronomical
defense spending (among other
things) led me to opt for President
Bush's opponent in the most re
cent election.
However. Ho might be sur
prised to learn that in my time at
Stanford 1 have taken classes with
instructors who have been em
ployed by former President Clin
ton. as well as President Bush, and
that my current economics profes
sor characterizes himself as "more
fiscally conservative." This has in
deed provoked "thought and in
trospection" among my classmates
and I. Your voting criteria do not.
