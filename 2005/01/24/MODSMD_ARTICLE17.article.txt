# Smoke and Mirrors Aside...
## Wars alone won't solve the world's problems 
### 
I long for the days when Dennis
Franz gliding across a bed
room butt-naked on "NYPD
Blue" drew the most moral
scorn in our country. Today,
America's moral woes are much
deeper.
A poll conducted by Cornell
University revealed that 44 percent
of Americans — nearly half the
country — believe that Muslims
should have fewer liberties than
others. Most of the people who be
lieved this classified themselves as
Republican and religious; they are
the same people who send you chain

e-mails warning
you that Chris
tianity is in dan
ger.
Last week
their hero deliv
ered an inaugu
ral address that
mentioned
"freedom" and
"liberty" 42
times. It out
lined no plans.

and the speech was so uninspiring
that the president often paused for
long periods of time to cue ap
plause from the audience. The vi
sion offered simply consisted of re
peating a few pretty words like
"freedom" over and over, devalu
ing them to the point of banality.
I want Bush's foreign policy to
succeed. The Iraqis and oppressed
peoples everywhere deserve
democracy and freedom. And
America should be a leader, by
virtue of its economic, political and
military strength. But the rest of
the world isn't stupid, and they sus
pect ulterior motives precisely be
cause America's benevolent ac
tions in history have rarely been
selfless. Our leadership today
should prove them wrong. That re
quires coloring outside the lines a
little bit to do what's bold, imagi
native and compassionate at the
same time.
I'll tell you what I would have
liked to hear in Bush's inaugural
address. The U.N. Millennium De
velopment Project — an undertak
ing of hundreds of development
experts led by Jeffrey Sachs — re
leased a report concluding that
world poverty could end by 2025 if
a list of measures were enacted. I
would have liked it if the president
praised the report, pledged to do

nate billions more in official devel
opment assistance than asked, and
made the elimination of world
poverty America's number one
foreign policy objective. I would
have especially been moved if he
framed it as God's demand of
America.
Instead, the word "poverty"
never appeared in Bush's speech.
The president conveniently quoted
President Abraham Lincoln by
saying, "Those who deny freedom
to others deserve it not for them
selves; and, under the rule of a just
God, cannot long retain it."
It would have been more appro
priate for Bush to ask whether
those who deny bed nets to the
150,000 African children who die
every month from malaria will be
looked upon favorably on the day
of judgment.
This administration is showing
no signs it will do what's right hu
manitarianly over what's right
strategically. During her confirma
tion hearings last week, Con
doleezza Rice said "that the tsuna
mi was a wonderful opportunity to
show not just the U.S. government,
but the heart of the American peo
ple. And I think it has paid great
dividends for us." Wonderful op
portunity? Great dividends? Over
225,000 people died, and Ameri
ca's liaison to the world looks to it
as an investment.
The lesson is straightforward:
America should do the moral
thing.
And a look at history indicates
that wars cannot make peace
alone. World War I led to World
War 11. World War II set up the
conditions for the Cold War. The
Cold War led to Osama bin Laden.
The way we're going, the War on
Terror will lead to something bad
as well. If we recognize that pover
ty breeds anger, hopelessness and
terrorism, and we work obsessively
to eliminate it, then we can under
mine brutal dictators by improving
life for those the world has aban
doned, and pave the way for free
dom and democracy.
Only then can America be
saved from God.

opment assistance than asked, and
made the elimination of world
poverty America's number one
foreign policy objective. I would
have especially been moved if he
framed it as God's demand of
America.
Instead, the word "poverty"
never appeared in Bush's speech.
The president conveniently quoted
President Abraham Lincoln by
saying, "Those who deny freedom
to others deserve it not for them
selves; and, under the rule of a just
God, cannot long retain it."
It would have been more appro
priate for Bush to ask whether
those who deny bed nets to the
150,000 African children who die
every month from malaria will be
looked upon favorably on the day
of judgment.
This administration is showing
no signs it will do what's right hu
manitarianly over what's right
strategically. During her confirma
tion hearings last week, Con
doleezza Rice said "that the tsuna
mi was a wonderful opportunity to
show not just the U.S. government,
but the heart of the American peo
ple. And I think it has paid great
dividends for us." Wonderful op
portunity? Great dividends? Over
225,000 people died, and Ameri
ca's liaison to the world looks to it
as an investment.
The lesson is straightforward:
America should do the moral
thing.
And a look at history indicates
that wars cannot make peace
alone. World War I led to World
War 11. World War II set up the
conditions for the Cold War. The
Cold War led to Osama bin Laden.
The way we're going, the War on
Terror will lead to something bad
as well. If we recognize that pover
ty breeds anger, hopelessness and
terrorism, and we work obsessively
to eliminate it, then we can under
mine brutal dictators by improving
life for those the world has aban
doned, and pave the way for free
dom and democracy.
Only then can America be
saved from God.

I long for the days when Dennis
Franz gliding across a bed
room butt-naked on "NYPD
Blue" drew the most moral
scorn in our country. Today,
America's moral woes are much
deeper.
A poll conducted by Cornell
University revealed that 44 percent
of Americans — nearly half the
country — believe that Muslims
should have fewer liberties than
others. Most of the people who be
lieved this classified themselves as
Republican and religious; they are
the same people who send you chain

e-mails warning
you that Chris
tianity is in dan
ger.
Last week
their hero deliv
ered an inaugu
ral address that
mentioned
"freedom" and
"liberty" 42
times. It out
lined no plans.

and the speech was so uninspiring
that the president often paused for
long periods of time to cue ap
plause from the audience. The vi
sion offered simply consisted of re
peating a few pretty words like
"freedom" over and over, devalu
ing them to the point of banality.
I want Bush's foreign policy to
succeed. The Iraqis and oppressed
peoples everywhere deserve
democracy and freedom. And
America should be a leader, by
virtue of its economic, political and
military strength. But the rest of
the world isn't stupid, and they sus
pect ulterior motives precisely be
cause America's benevolent ac
tions in history have rarely been
selfless. Our leadership today
should prove them wrong. That re
quires coloring outside the lines a
little bit to do what's bold, imagi
native and compassionate at the
same time.
I'll tell you what I would have
liked to hear in Bush's inaugural
address. The U.N. Millennium De
velopment Project — an undertak
ing of hundreds of development
experts led by Jeffrey Sachs — re
leased a report concluding that
world poverty could end by 2025 if
a list of measures were enacted. I
would have liked it if the president
praised the report, pledged to do

nate billions more in official devel
opment assistance than asked, and
made the elimination of world
poverty America's number one
foreign policy objective. I would
have especially been moved if he
framed it as God's demand of
America.
