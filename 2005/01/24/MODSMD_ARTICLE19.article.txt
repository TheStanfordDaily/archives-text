matter ot time before the No. 5 Cardinal women's bas

Southern California (13-5,
7-2) in a lopsided 94-58
win.

USC has spent the
season surpassing all expectations, compiling a 7-1 Pac
-10 record that no one saw coming. In the preseason, the
Trojans were expected to finish seventh in the confer
ence.
But coming into Maples Pavilion on Saturday, the
Women of Troy weren't blinded by visions of grandeur
from their early season success. They were well aware
that just staying close with the Cardinal would be a task.
Freshman guard Candice Wiggins made sure they
never did stay close. Wiggins scored 20 of her 23 points in
the first half and had a season-high nine rebounds.
"Our feeling was to stay close and we'll make our run.

hut they never let us do it," USC head coach Mark Trakh
said. "You look at Wiggins, and she brings the X-factor.
She can create her own shots, and she disrupted our of
fense. They have a real good press breaker in Candice."
Wiggins redirected all the praise to her teammates.
"We work on our press offense a lot, and with our
guards I don't think anyone can really press us," Wiggins
said. ' We stay poised, and we don't have to worry about
every possession. We're thinking about the big picture."
Stanford boasted a well-balanced attack. Along with
Wiggins, guards Susan King Borchardt and Kelley Sum
inski led the onslaught from the outside with 10 points
each. Kristen Newlin added 14 points from the inside,
putting four Stanford players in double figures.
"We're doing all things well," Newlin said. "We're
concentrating on the little things. We have great shooters
on the team, and it's all the extra work they put in."
The inefficient Trojans offense was led by Eshaya
Murphy with 11 points) and Jamie Hagiya with 10. The
loss snapped the Trojans' seven-game winning streak,
which had been their longest winning streak in 11 years.
While the Trojans ended their streak, the Cardinal
just extended theirs. The win was the Cardinal's 33rd
straight home win against a Pac-10 opponent.
