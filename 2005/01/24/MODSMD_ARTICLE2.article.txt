### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the clock wound down, the 70
exhausted, sweaty, smelly students
who survived the first-ever Stanford
Dance Marathon were re-energized
to learn they had exceeded all
fundraising expectations.
The event raised a whopping
$46,074 yesterday for the Elizabeth
Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation,
far surpassing its $30,000 goal.
Dance Marathon Co-Chairs Sanjay
Shah and Pat Bomhack, both se
niors, announced the grand total 23
hours and 46 minutes after the event

began in Roble Gym Saturday at
noon.
Organizers set the goal at $30,000
after looking at the results of other
Dance Marathons, which require
participants to earn charitable dona
tions by dancing for 24 hours
straight. Over 1 (X) universities spon
sor the event nationwide.
"UCLA raised about $26,000 in
its first Dance Marathon, and
they're twice as big as we are,"
Bomhack said before announcing
the total.
"But we're better than UCLA,"
he said, eliciting cheers from the

dancers and supporters.
The announcement capped
an inaugural event that re
quired the efforts of hun
dreds of students, adminis
trators and donors.
"It was educational, enter
taining and absolutely ex
hausting— the three 'e's"
said senior Jen Nuckols, one
of the 260 registered dancers
who raised at least $125 for
the cause.
"Ha! You didn't see her
five hours ago when she had
her head on the table," said
fellow dancer Jessica Angel
son, a junior.
"OK, at times I hated it.
but at other times 1 thought it
was the buM time of my life,"
Nuckols said.
Not all of the registered
dancers showed lip; only 70
made it to the end.
Angelson said she was tired
but gratified by the outcome
of the event.

Shah, whom Bomhack
called the "founding father of
Dance Marathon," congratu
lated the dancers for the
event's success.
"You guys are special,"
Shah said. "You guys are part
of the first Stanford Dance
Marathon."
The event, described by
organizers as "one 24-hour
party," required over a year
of planning.
"It (was) about I.oootimes
harder than throwing 12 two
hour parties," Bomhack said.
Students left Dance
Marathon like they leave
most good parties: tired but
happy.
When asked to reflect on
her experience, senior Sheila
Joglekar looked perplexed
and smiled.
"I'm a little delirious," she
said.
