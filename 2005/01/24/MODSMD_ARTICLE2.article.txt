who survived the first-ever Stanford
Dance Marathon were re-energized

fundraising expectations.
The event raised a whopping
$46,074 yesterday for the Elizabeth
Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation,
far surpassing its $30,000 goal.

straight. Over 1 (X) universities spon

"UCLA raised about $26,000 in
its first Dance Marathon, and
they're twice as big as we are,"
Bomhack said before announcing
the total.
"But we're better than UCLA,"
he said, eliciting cheers from the
