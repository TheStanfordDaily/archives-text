LOS ANGELES — With junior point

mates fighting a bout of reboundingitis.
Stanford's modest three-game winning
streak was on thin ice Saturday at the L. A.

didn't crack.

night, scored
18 of his 20 points in the second half — in
cluding 10 during a crucial five-minute stretch
— to help Stanford to a 78-70 victory over the
Trojans before a small crowd of 3,447.
"I didn't want to come out too early and
be dead in the second half," said Hernan
dez. 'it's always a close game here."
Saturday was no exception, as the 225 th
meeting between the Pacific-10 Confer
ence foes included 16 lead changes and
seven ties. The last came with 5:24 to play,
when Hernandez swished a three-pointer
from the top of the key to give Stanford
(10-7,4-3) a 64-62 lead.'
"It was just a matter of waiting for my
time to come and get some open looks,"
said Hernandez, who stole an inbounds
pass that led to an easy layup thirty seconds
earlier and hit five free throws after his
three-pointer to give Stanford a 71-62 lead
with 1:19 to play.
As impressive as Hernandez's second
half solo act was, he got plenty of help from
his supporting cast. Coming off a 14-point
performance at UCLA, fellow junior Matt
Haryasz finished with 18 points and 10 re
bounds. While he was active inside,
Haryasz did most of his damage with his
high-arching long-range jumper.
"1 think I've had him down in the post
too much, as opposed to moving him
around," head coach Trent Johnson said.
"I've got to do a better job of getting him
on the move so people can't just get real
physical with him."
USC (9-10, 2-6) was determined to be

physical with Stanford from the opening
tip. using full-court pressure to force the
Cardinal into 11 first half turnovers. Stan
ford was outrebounded 17-8 on the offen
sive glass — 34-28 overall — which led to
20 second-chance points. The discrepancy
was even greater at the half, with the Tro
jans holding a 19-9 advantage.
Junior Dan Grunfeld added 20 points in
a game-high 38 minutes for Stanford, and
senior center Rob Little finished with 12
points and seven boards despite being lim
ited by foul trouble.
The win gave Stanford its third straight
road sweep of the Los Angeles schools and
vaulted it into third place in the Pac-10
standings. Not bad fora team that lost its
first three conference games.
"That's big for us." Haryasz said. "Now
we have the Oregon schools, and we're
looking to continue winning. It feels good
to be back in the winner's circle."
For most of the first half, Stanford
looked nothing like the team that con
trolled the tempo from start to finish in a
75-64 win at UCLA on Thursday night.
USC opened an eight-point lead on a
jumper by Rory O'Neil with five minutes to
play in the first half and took a fouij-point
lead into halftime. The Trojans' largest lead
of the second half was six with 11:59 to play.
Horrid free throw shooting doomed the
Trojans, however, as McMillan's 2-for-7
night headlined USC's 10-for-20 clip from
the charity stripe. Stanford shot 19-for-27
from the line.
The Trojans, winners of two straight en
tering the game after starting 0-5 in confer
ence play, got a career-high 23 points from
freshman guard Gabe Pruitt. The Los An
geles native drained five three-pointers to
lead a USC bench that outscored the Car
dinal's reserves 34-3. Pruitt shot 8-for-l l
from the field.
"I saw Gabe play in high school, and I
thought he was one of the best guards com
ing out," Johnson said. "So we knew he
could play."
But Stanford, which shot 54 percent as
a team, limited the rest of the Trojans to 38
percent shooting and forced 21 turnovers.
Senior forward Jeff McMillan added a
double-double with 10 points and 12 re
bounds in defeat.
Stanford returns home fora pair of
games against the Oregon schools this
week to complete the first half of the Pac
!o season.
