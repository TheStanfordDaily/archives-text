## Kim Jong II rules golf at the Dictator Classic

Author's note: Foremost, this author
would like to thank an anonymous e-mailer
for his or her lively response to my Sidney
Ponson article. AtleeNelli43 concluded the e
mail with this zinger: "You're a jealous idiot
who wouldn't know the first thing about being
politically correct or even nice! So here's to
you, asshole!"
Smarting from Atlee's well-composed
piece of hate mail, I considered who might
have written such a response. Since I can't
imagine anybody actually defending Sir Pon
son, I'm guessing that Atlee is either a) Sir

Ponson himself attempting
to defend his own robust
image, or b) a member of Sir
Sidney's family. Regardless,
reader response is always
appreciated, so my thanks go
out to Atlee.
And now, onto today's
article.
Deathly ill from the West
Nile Virus (or at least some
manifestation of a nasty

cold), I still endeavored to write a column for
this week. And what should this column be
about, dear readers? With Spring Quarter
rapidly approaching (granted. Spring Quar
ter's not anywhere close, but at least let me
dream of my impending Winter Quarter grad
uation and subsequent trips to the golf
course), it's time to take the sticks out of stor
age and talk about golf. Today's topic: the
world's best golfer.
Let's look at the stats for the world's best
golfer: routinely shoots in the low 50's, fin
ished 38 under par in his first attempt at golf
(with five holes-in-one), and scores three or
four holes-in-one per round. While Ameri
cans might be content with David Duval's 59
in the final round of the 1999 Bob Hope
Chrysler Classic, people in the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). always
looking to one-up American accomplish
ments, know that Kim Jong-11 is easily the
world's best golfer.
People might refer to an East Coast bias in
sports, but the media's lack of coverage of this
story shows a distinct Western-centrism for
news.
Skeptics, doubters, and those consuming
the Haterade might not believe the legend
that is Kim Jong-11. But au contraire, mon
frere. As much as I'd like to mythologize Kim
Jong-11 for the sake of a Stanford Daily story,
I have journalistic integrity to contend with.
Thus, before writing this story, 1 consulted nu
merous sources to check the facts of this story.
Granted, they were all sources from within
the DPRK, but I'm willing to extend the olive
branch to a rogue DPRK nation, in order to
cover an underreported story and hopefully
bridge the gap between the United States and
the DPRK. Like I tell my friends, I'm just try
ing to do my part for world diplomacy.
First, according to DPRK media sources,
Jong-Il's favorite Pyongyang course, measur
ing a lengthy 7,700 yards, is "in full line with in
ternational standards." Thus, before people
start complaining to me that Kim Jong-11 card
ed a 34 on a course that does not comply with
international regulation, I'd like to point out
that this is simply not true. Surrounded by a
forest and a scenic lake, golfers can enjoy col
lecting plants and boating during breaks in
their rounds at the Pyongyang course.
Next, not only was the course a full par 72,
the golf pro at the Pyongyang course. Park
Young Man, witnessed the round and signed
Kim Jong-Il's scorecard. After the round.
Park Young Man confirmed that Kim Jong-II
was a natural, shooting a 34 in his first round
