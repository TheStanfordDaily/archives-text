## 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Heading to the desert this weekend, the
No. 6 Stanford swimming and diving team
knew that every athlete needed to give her
best. They did just that, cruising to a 177-117
victory over No. 18 Arizona State and
pulling off a 165-135 upset over previously
undefeated No. 4 Arizona.
The competition against the Wildcats was a
close one, with each team winning eight of the
16 events. In the end. it was the depth of talent
on the Cardinal roster that garnered enough
points to edge Arizona.
The victory over the Sun Devils was much
more decisive, with Stanford winning 13 of 16
races, losing only in the 100-yard backstroke,
100-yard breaststroke and 200-yard freestyle
relay.
The marquee matchup of the weekend
came in the breaststroke events, which fea
tured Stanford's freshman ace Caroline
Bruce going head-to-head with ASU's Agnes
Kovacs, who earned Olympic bronze for
Hungary in the 200-meter distance in 19%
before moving up to grab the gold in 2000.

Kovacs edged Bruce in the 100-yard breast
by . 15 seconds, but Bruce pulled out a victory
in the 200 by a margin of almost half a second.
Both times in the 200 distance were NCAA
"A" standard times, while Bruce settled for a
"B" time behind Kovacs' "A" in the 100.
The rest of the meet against ASU was not
nearly as competitive, with Stanford clearly
proving itself the superior squad. Bruce added
a second victory in the 400-yard individual
medley in NCAA "B" time.
Senior Lacey Boutwell tallied a pair of wins
in the 50-yard and 100-yard freestyle, missing
the "B" standard by .02 seconds in the 50 but
recording a qualifying time in the 100.
Sophomore Dana Kirk was a double win
ner as well, sweeping the 100-yard and 200-
yard butterfly, both with "B" times.
Senior diver Ashlee Rosenthal finished at
the top in both the one-meter and three-meter
springboard events, followed closely by
sophomore Cassidy Krug in both heights.
Freshman Katie Lampe completed the 1-2-3
Cardinal sweep in the one-meter and finished
fourth in the three-meter.
Four other Stanford swimmers came away
with victories at ASU: freshman Brooke Bish

op in the 200-yard back, sophomore Desiree
Stahley in the 200-yard free, freshman Eliza
beth Durot in the 500-yard free and sopho
more Lauren Costella in the 1650-yard free. In
the 200-yard medley relay, the team of senior
Amy Wagner. Bruce, Kirk and Boutwell got
the win in a close race by a margin of .01 sec
onds.
The meet against No. 4 Arizona the follow
ing day was not nearly as easy for the Cardinal,
but Stanford had an advantage in the number
of talented swimmers on its roster.
"We won the same number of races," se
nior Kirsten Gilbert said. "But in the races we
won, we went 1-2-3 and picked up lots of
points all the way down to fifth, whereas they
didn't have the same depth."
The Cardinal took the top three spots in
both the 100-yard and 200-yard breast. Junior
Kristen Caverly, swimming breaststroke for
the first time this season, finished first in both
races, both in NCAA "B" standard time.
Caverly was joined at the front of the pack by
freshmen Erica Liu and Katherine Bell in the
100 and Bell and Gilbert in the 200.

usually Bruce's domain, to allow
the versatile Bruce to swim the
backstroke events, a strength of the
Wildcats. Arizona won both of
those races, but Bruce finished
third in each of them, contributing
much-needed points to help edge
the undefeated Wildcats. Bruce

of Bishop. Bruce, Kirk and
Boutwell finished on top in their
event, touching the wall nearly four
seconds ahead of Arizona's A
squad in NCAA "B" time.
The relay was the day's first
event and the win gave the team a
boost of confidence. The entire
team performed at a high level,
with three non-winners posting
"B" standard limes. It was these
fast supporting times that allowed
the Cardinal to come home with a
sweep.
Of the 16 events, only three did
not feature two Cardinal swimmers
in the top three, and Stanford
placed three in the top five on 11
occasions.

For two members of the team,
heating Arizona was extra sweet.
Seniors Kirsten Gilbert and Amy
Wagner are both natives of
Phoenix, and they were swimming
in their hometown for the last time
in their collegiate careers.
"Thinking that it would be my
last meet in Arizona was a little sad
since 1 was raised there and swam
so many times in both pools." Wag
ner said. "But there were a lot of
my friends and family there, so they
got to see me in one last meet."
Especially against U of A.it was
good to beat them in their home
pool," Gilbert added. "We lost to
them down in Arizona my sopho
more year, so it felt especially good.
There were a bunch of people from
my club team there, and it was nice
to show them that we're good
enough to beat Arizona."
