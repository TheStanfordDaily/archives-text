### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
Pulitzer Prize-winning poet C.K.
Williams will be sharing his work on
campus this week as part of the Cre
ative Writing Program's Jean and
Bill Lane Lecture Series.
Williams is known for connecting
his poetry to current events, and he
has recently turned his eye on the
war in Iraq.
He will read from his work
tonight at 8 p.m. in Kresge Auditori
um. He will also hold an informal
colloquium tomorrow at 11 a.m. in
the Terrace Room on the fourth
floor of Margaret Jacks Hall, where
he will speak about his writing
process and field questions from the

audience. Both the reading and col
loquium are free and open to the
public.
In a profile of Williams last week.
The New York Times referred to his
poetry as "the antidote to patriotic
jingoism, moral smugness and the
imbecility of the easily amused."
"We in the Creative Writing Pro
gram saw Williams as an obvious
choice for the lecture series," said
Peter Campion, a Jones Lecturer in
creative writing who helped coordi
nate the events. "American poetry
seems so divided into different
camps and styles, but he's the kind of
poet that all sorts of people acknowl
edge as a real master."
