### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
Pulitzer Prize-winning poet C.K.
Williams will be sharing his work on
campus this week as part of the Cre
ative Writing Program's Jean and
Bill Lane Lecture Series.
Williams is known for connecting
his poetry to current events, and he
has recently turned his eye on the
war in Iraq.
He will read from his work
tonight at 8 p.m. in Kresge Auditori
um. He will also hold an informal
colloquium tomorrow at 11 a.m. in
the Terrace Room on the fourth
floor of Margaret Jacks Hall, where
he will speak about his writing
process and field questions from the

audience. Both the reading and col
loquium are free and open to the
public.
In a profile of Williams last week.
The New York Times referred to his
poetry as "the antidote to patriotic
jingoism, moral smugness and the
imbecility of the easily amused."
"We in the Creative Writing Pro
gram saw Williams as an obvious
choice for the lecture series," said
Peter Campion, a Jones Lecturer in
creative writing who helped coordi
nate the events. "American poetry
seems so divided into different
camps and styles, but he's the kind of
poet that all sorts of people acknowl
edge as a real master."
Raised during the Great Depres
sion. Williams began writing poetry
at age 19 after attending the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania. His first hook,
"Lies," was published in 1969. His
most noted works include "Flesh
and Blood," for which he received
the National Book Critics Circle
Award, and "Repair," published in
1999, which earned him the
Pulitzer. He currently teaches at
Princeton and spends part of the
year in Paris.
"I think his common theme is a
very special political vision," said
Eavan Boland. director of the Cre
ative Writing Program. "He sees the
private world reflected in the public
and the public in the private. He
doesn't divide them."
Campion also emphasized this
aspect of Williams' poetry as one

that separates him from many of his
contemporaries.
"He writes poems that take place
in the private sphere, and then con
nects it to the world of current
events, to war. to the larger picture,
which some American poets seem
isolated from,"he said. "There's a
big dark side of his work, a lot of
agony in it to be sure, but all the
same it can rise to moments of exul
tation."
According to Campion, Williams
is also known for his poetry's like
ness to fiction.
"He's a poet who has in many
ways invaded the territory of the
novelist," he said. "He often writes
in long lines, uses searching sen
tences. There's a kind of shock that
comes from seeing that inside a

Poet tackles current events

poem that has all of its lyrical
force."
Boland said she hopes Williams'
unique style and awareness of cur
rent and political events will impact
the students who attend the week's
events.
"They will see a major American
poet absolutely engaged with the
same world they are interested in,
and one who has carved out a
unique style to express that engage
ment," she said. "I think and hope
that that is what our poetry students
want as well."
In past years the Lane Lecture
Series have brought many well
known authors and poets to cam
pus, including Thorn Gunn, Michael
Ondaatje, Eudora Welty, John Irv
ing and Toni Morrison.
