# Faculty senate extends Thanksgiving break
## 
### JEFFREY ERFE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Faculty Senate approved
a proposal last Thursday that
would significantly alter the au
tumn quarter calendar for the
2005-2006 school year.
Perhaps the biggest change
the senate passed is to extend
Thanksgiving break to a full
week. No classes will be held dur
ing Thanksgiving week next year,
but University offices will not
close. Also, for the second year in
a row, classes will begin on a
Monday. Both changes were
passed on a one-year trial basis
and can be re-examined after
next year.
At least two faculty members
argued that extending Thanks
giving week break could be dis
ruptive because of the fast pace at
which the quarter system moves.
Statistics Prof. David Siegmund
suggested that Stanford keep last
year's schedule for Thanksgiving
week and simply move winter
break up.
Others suggested that giving
an entire week off would give stu
dents and faculty time to catch up
on work before finals. Humani
ties students would have a longer
time to write papers. Also, stu
dents who live farther away might
go home. Others worried about

the effect the break could have on
international students.
Other faculty members rec
ommended that the senate give
closer scrutiny to the proposal.
"There is the distinct possi
bility for the loss of academic
momentum, so it is very impor
tant that we determine how
these changes are to be present
ed," Geophysics Prof. Rose
mary Knight said. "It can be an
opportunity for people to have
reflection and preparation.
From day one, we have to make
clear how we see this week being
used."
The second major change the
senate passed was to begin class
es again on a Monday. Before this
year, autumn classes typically
began on Wednesday of the first
week.
"The downside was that the
quarter was shorter because we
started on the Monday after the
usual Wednesday start. Howev
er, overall it was a particularly
positive thing in our view. Classes
that have sections were able to
meet during that week. Shopping
period seemed to calm down
sooner than it seemed to in the
past. Students got involved in
their studies much more quickly
than the past," Printup said.
After Printup's report, a host
of Senate members raised a vari

ety of questions and concerns.
One Senate member asked how
these changes would affect
Sophomore and Honors College.
"There would be some logisti
cal adjustments to be made,"
Printup noted. "But the intention
would be not to hinder those pro
grams. I've talked to the people
involved with those programs
and they think they can accom
modate them."
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Sheri Sheppard expressed con
cerns that the new beginning date
would be disruptive for graduate
student orientation activities. In
the new quarter calendar, there
would be no Monday or Tuesday
Orientation for graduate stu
dents to connect with faculty. The
orientation has been important in
the past for graduate students.
On the other hand. Biological
Science Prof. Patricia Jones ap
proved of the new beginning date
for fall quarter. Heavily involved
with Freshmen Academic Advis
ing, she felt that this would be an
opportunity "to have the acade
mic advising during the week and
have the weekend for students to
blow off some steam and get used
to their courses."
Nonetheless, the Faculty Sen
ate narrowly approved the
changes for the 2005-2006 school
vear.
