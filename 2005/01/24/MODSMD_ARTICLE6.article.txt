# With fewer majors, CS job market improves

### NOAH WEISS 
In 2001, Pets.com sold its last dog bone. Kozmo
sent out its last neon-orange-tote-bag-carrying de
livery person and Webvan decided that it could no
longer afford the army of vans needed to deliver
groceries.
The NASDAQ peaked at 5,048.62 on March 10,
2002 and then plummeted nearly 4,000 points by
the following August. But in the last year and a half
it has made a 1,000 point comeback, and the once
deflated high tech sector has been revitalized.
Last week, representatives from high-tech com
panies attended the Stanford Computer Forum job
fair for computer science and electrical engineering
students. It isn't surprising that Stanford students
are targeted for jobs in these sectors. But what may
come as a surprise is that the number of employers
attending the fair has remained relatively constant,
from the bubble to the burst to the present.
The number of computer science majors de
clared at Stanford, however, has declined by more
than 30 percent since 2000. From 1995 to 2000, the
enrollment more than doubled as students watched
the climb of the NASDAQ and enlisted to become
the next beneficiaries of initial public offerings, or
IPOs.
