# With fewer majors, CS job market improves
## 
### NOAH WEISS 
In 2001, Pets.com sold its last dog bone. Kozmo
sent out its last neon-orange-tote-bag-carrying de
livery person and Webvan decided that it could no
longer afford the army of vans needed to deliver
groceries.
The NASDAQ peaked at 5,048.62 on March 10,
2002 and then plummeted nearly 4,000 points by
the following August. But in the last year and a half
it has made a 1,000 point comeback, and the once
deflated high tech sector has been revitalized.
Last week, representatives from high-tech com
panies attended the Stanford Computer Forum job
fair for computer science and electrical engineering
students. It isn't surprising that Stanford students
are targeted for jobs in these sectors. But what may
come as a surprise is that the number of employers
attending the fair has remained relatively constant,
from the bubble to the burst to the present.
The number of computer science majors de
clared at Stanford, however, has declined by more
than 30 percent since 2000. From 1995 to 2000, the
enrollment more than doubled as students watched
the climb of the NASDAQ and enlisted to become
the next beneficiaries of initial public offerings, or
IPOs.

grounds."
In addition to high-tech stalwarts like
Yahoo, eßay and Apple, many startups are
hiring again.
"More and more startups are looking for
employees, and more and more startups are
getting funding these days," Hsieh said. "The
venture community is extremely open to in
novative ideas, and we live in the heart of that
entrepreneurial environment."
At Google, students have found the open
ness of a startup inside an established compa
ny — one fortunately founded and filled with
Stanford graduates.
"They have built an amazing set of em
ployees there where everyone loves their
job," Hsieh said. "Everyone 1 spoke with was
extremely passionate about what they do.
Google is in a unique position right now and
has tons of potential for future growth."
Senior Dan Siroker added that Google
was"a lot more friendly and willing to talk."
Since many of the companies recruiting
have employees who are Stanford gradu
ates, the companies "know what it means
that you're a Stanford student," Siroker
said.
"CS majors are not as pessimistic about
job prospects as the media would like people
to believe," Siroker said.
Matt Reuben, a co-terminal graduate in
CS last year and now an engineer at Ama
zon.com, agreed with Siroker that the com
panies understand what a Stanford computer
science degree represents.
"Recent grads know the easy and hard
classes," Reuben said. "I was most of [these
students'] TA."
Compared to the late 19905, graduates
now will enter a significantly different hiring
climate.
At the height of the bubble, according to
Electronic Arts recruiter Gee, companies
would pay students exorbitant bonuses, offer
thousands of stock options and send Tiffany
& Co. pens in the mail.

"CS enrollment has declined significantly
at MIT. Stanford and Berkeley." said Phillip
Gee, a recruiter at Electronic Arts and nine
year veteran of the industry. "At the same
time, the high-tech industry has picked up."
This created a "perfect storm for employ
ment." where the "good students get many
job offers." Gee said.
Students at the job fair gauged their
prospects and felt confident.
"I feel as if I won't have any trouble find
ing a job," said junior David Blackman.
When interviewing candidates for intern
ships, the first question many companies ask
is whether the student would be interested in

a full-time position. With lucrative internship
programs, CS majors can gain experience
while making a sizeable salary over the sum
mer.
"Most companies are offering internships
with $10,000, housing and a stipend," said
Blackman.
Computer science co-terminal student
Tony Hsieh said he feels bullish about his and
his fellow computer science majors'
prospects.
"Now is a great time to be a graduating
CS student," Hsieh said. "Many companies
out there, not just tech companies, are look
ing for people with quantitative back-

Computer skills back in demand

"Candidates are no longer overwhelmed
by option packages," Gee said. "Students
have never been truly motivated by money.
They're focused on job content."
Now companies recruit with guaranteed
salaries and benefits instead of options and
pre-paid BMW car leases. Recruiters who
can no longer promise soaring stock prices
are faced with the task of persuading students
with promises of job and intellectual fulfill
ment.
The questions employers must answer in
clude: "How can you grow their career? How
can you challenge them?" Gee said.
"The character of the students has
changed a bit," said Computer Science Prof.
Bill Dally, who is the chair of the department.
"There used to be two classes of students:
those who truly loved CS, and those who
wanted to be millionaires before they were 30
and thought CS would get them there."
"Now we have fewer students, and they
are all from the first set," said Dally.
Even though computer science enroll
ment is down, "CS still teaches more student
hours per faculty member than any other de
partment in the school," Dally said.
Throughout Silicon Valley, there are of
fice parks with signs advertising thousands
of available square feet where dot-com
companies once displayed their logo. But
there are companies like Sun Microsystems,
Google and Oracle that are building new
offices and startup companies moving back
in.
The economic impact of the Internet stock
collapse has worn off and the hiring has
restarted. Now seems to be the perfect time
to find a job as a computer science graduate
from Stanford — the demand for employees
is growing as the supply of graduates is
falling.
"The number of jobs dropped when the
bubble burst but is still higher than before the
bubble," Dally said. "In the future I see mod
est growth in technology jobs."
