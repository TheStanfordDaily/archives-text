# FLiCKs to bring 'Fockers' director next week
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
FLiCKS is donating ticket sales
from its two screenings of "Meet the
Fockers" to charity and giving the
audience the chance to meet director
Jay Roach. The first screening was
last night, and the encore will take
place this Sunday.
"Students are able to donate to
the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric
AIDS Foundation, and all they have
to do is buy a $6 ticket to watch a new
hit movie â€” it's a win-win situation,"
said FLiCKS Manager Debby
Chang, a sophomore.
She praised Roach, Class of 1979,
who also directed the "Austin Pow
ers" movies, for his generosity.
"We only got this movie because
Jay Roach has been such a great
sport about it. He personally called
Universal Studios to ensure that we
could show it for free."
Roach worked as a FLiCKS man
ager while at Stanford and will be on
campus fora FLiCKS-exclusive
question-and-answer session after

the 7 p.m. encore presentation of
"Fockers" on Sunday. Audience
members at last night's show re
ceived a two-person entrance ticket
to Roach's talk.
Chang said she expects the
screening to draw record numbers
because of the charitable cause, the
celebrity appearance and the
movie's popularity. Upon its release
one month ago, "Meet the Fockers"
topped the box office for three
weeks in a row.
Students who organized yester
day's Dance Marathon, which also
benefited the Glaser Foundation, in
spired the FLiCKS staff to raise
money for the charity, Chang said.
"We helped Dance Marathon
with advertising in the fall, and I
guess their excitement for the cause
rubbed off. It really did get us think
ing about what we could do for the
Foundation using the resources we
have."

movie's screening rights and his time to the
students.
To thank Roach, Chang said, the
FLiCKS staff "wants to give him a home
coming worth remembering."
Chang said she hopes that this charity
event, the first by FLiCKS in recent memo
ry, will serve as the beginning of a trend.
"We'd definitely like to do something
like this again in the future. Personally. I'd
like to do it every quarter or every year at
least."
