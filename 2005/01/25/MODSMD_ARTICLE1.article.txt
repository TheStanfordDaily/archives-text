# Classmates fight to free jailed alum
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While students at Stanford's
Graduate School of Business lay am
bitious plans for the future, the fate
of Jude Shao, Class of l l )93 at the
Business School, stands as a re
minder that life does not always un
fold as planned.
Despite the efforts of his support
ers, who have doggedly lobbied to
secure his release from prison in
Shanghai, Shao is currently serving
his sixth year of a 16-year sentence
for what many observers view to be
fallacious tax charges.
However, a number of recent de
velopments provide Shao's support
ers with renewed hope. These devel
opments include the diagnosis of
Shao's heart condition, diplomatic
efforts by the U.S. State Department
and overtures to solicit the help of
newly appointed Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice.
Shao's lengthy prison sentence
stemmed from his refusal to pay a
$60,000 "special tax audit bond,"

which Shao considered to be a bribe.
Chinese tax auditors, taking Shao's
refusal as an insult, had him arrested
and jailed incommunicado for two
years. He was barred from hiring a
lawyer until 10 days before the trial,
and consequently, Shao could not
prepare a meaningful defense.
In March of 2000. a Shanghai
Court sentenced him to 16 years in
prison for tax evasion.
The Effort from Home
Shao's friends and family have
been unrelenting in fighting for his
release. Chuck Hoover, Shao's for
mer roommate at Stanford, spear
headed the Free Jude Shao Cam
paign, which is largely responsible
for drawing public attention to the
case and for soliciting government
support.
"While Jude [Shao| is working
the official appeals route in China,
we — his classmates in the U.S. —
are trying to find ways for the U.S. to
influence China," said Lane Ahn

Jude Shao, who graduated from the Graduate School of Business in 1993, is
serving a 16-year prison term in China on tax evasion charges.
Pham. another partner in the Free
Jude Shao Campaign.
"We have cultivated relation
ships with our representatives from
California, all of whom have been
very supportive," Pham said.
Three members of Congress have
also been working on Shao's case —
Anna Eshoo (D-Palo Alto), Zoe
Lofgren (D-San Jose) and Mike
Honda (D-Campbell). They have
co-authored numerous letters to
both American and Chinese offi
cials, including then-Secretary of
State Colin Powell and Chinese Am
bassador Yang Jiechi.
"I think it is very important to
stay on it," Eshoo said in an inter
view with The Daily. "If you don't
keep the pressure on. most frankly,
these issues are forgotten."
A significant victory came after
the representatives sent a letter to
President George W. Bush last No
vember. The letter urged Bush to
bring Shao's case to the attention of
Chinese President Hu Jintao at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit.
The U.S. Department of State re
sponded to the letter, saying James
Kelly — assistant secretary for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs — had
taken time at the summit to lobby se
nior Chinese officials on Shao's be
half.
There is no word as to how the
Chinese responded. But the letter
from the State Department stated
that the White House has "regularly
raised [Shao's] case both publicly
and privately."
Eshoo said these actions are
"more than appropriate." But she
felt it would have been more benefi
cial if Bush had raised the case "di
rectly, one-on-one" with the Chinese
President.
Nonetheless, these diplomatic ef
forts are "really imperative" for se
curing an early release, according to
Hoover. "The support Jude has re
ceived on Capitol Hill has been in
strumental in keeping his case in the
public eye.

An Impassive System
Public diplomacy from the U.S. is
especially important in Shao's case
because working from within the
Chinese judicial system has so far
proven ineffective.
Shao has petitioned four times for
new proof of his innocence to be re
viewed. but he has received no reply
from Chinese courts. Hoover said,
"which is a violation of their own
law."
"We do not have any confidence
that the Chinese government will re
spond [to the petitions] and rectify
this situation," he said.
This has made it necessary to
place Shao's case in a political con
text, namely within the framework
of the human rights dialogue be
tween the U.S. and China.
John Kamm is one of the people
working on this aspect of the case.
Kamm is the founder and chairman
of the Dui Hua Foundation, a non
profit organization dedicated to fos
tering human rights in China by
means of diplomacy with the United
States.
"The U.S. and China are dis
cussing a resumption of the dialogue
on human rights, which has been sus
pended since last march," Kamm
told The Daily. "It's a very good sign
that Shao is on the priority list of key
cases on that agenda."
However, it is not clear where
these diplomatic avenues will lead. If
the goal is getting the Chinese sys
tem to grant a retrial or to admit new
evidence, Kamm is skeptical about
whether that can be achieved at all.
In a speech made at the 10-year
reunion of Shao's graduating class,
Kamm said that, for the Chinese
government, granting Shao's legal
petitions would amount to admitting
that mistakes had been made in their
courts, and in China this is simply un
heard of.
Alternative Hopes tor Release

Shao's heart ailment may
be best chance out of jail

Other news in the case has been
bittersweet. Prison doctors recently
diagnosed Shao with a heart condi
tion that cannot be treated in China,
Hoover said. Although tragic in it
self, his condition will qualify him to
be released from prison on medical
parole.
According to Kamm, the prison
warden would be allowed to grant
the parole on his own authority.
Therefore, Shao's release could by
pass the Chinese government.
"In terms of early release from
prison, the most probable route to
success is medical parole," Kamm
said.
If released this way, Shao would
be allowed to leave China until he
recovers from his illness. Legally, he
would still be serving his sentence
and could continue to petition the
courts from abroad.
Shao applied for medical parole
last June, but has yet to receive any
reply, said Hoover. Diplomatic pres
sure could also be instrumental in
winning the parole, which would
allow the Chinese government to re
lease Shao without admitting to any
flaws in their legal system.
In terms of diplomacy, Kamm
said Rice could be an "absolutely
critical" ally in Shao's case.
"If she, in her new position, were
to write a letter, it would have a ter
rific impact," Kamm said.
Hoover agreed, saying that "the
current focus is to get a meeting with
Condoleezza Rice, because we think
it is important that the new Secretary
of State is familiar with this case and
that she bring it up with her Chinese
counterpart."
Still, according to Kamm, it will
not be any one letter that wins
Shao's freedom.
"Rarely is it a single action or ef
fort, but the accumulation [of them J
that makes the Chinese government
act on these kinds of cases," Kamm
said. "So the road to that can be a
long and winding one."

Jude Shao, who graduated from the Graduate School of Business in 1993, is
serving a 16-year prison term in China on tax evasion charges.
Pham. another partner in the Free
Jude Shao Campaign.
"We have cultivated relation
ships with our representatives from
California, all of whom have been
very supportive," Pham said.
Three members of Congress have
also been working on Shao's case —
Anna Eshoo (D-Palo Alto), Zoe
Lofgren (D-San Jose) and Mike
Honda (D-Campbell). They have
co-authored numerous letters to
both American and Chinese offi
cials, including then-Secretary of
State Colin Powell and Chinese Am
bassador Yang Jiechi.
"I think it is very important to
stay on it," Eshoo said in an inter
view with The Daily. "If you don't
keep the pressure on. most frankly,
these issues are forgotten."
A significant victory came after
the representatives sent a letter to
President George W. Bush last No
vember. The letter urged Bush to
bring Shao's case to the attention of
Chinese President Hu Jintao at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit.
The U.S. Department of State re
sponded to the letter, saying James
Kelly — assistant secretary for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs — had
taken time at the summit to lobby se
nior Chinese officials on Shao's be
half.
There is no word as to how the
Chinese responded. But the letter
from the State Department stated
that the White House has "regularly
raised [Shao's] case both publicly
and privately."
Eshoo said these actions are
"more than appropriate." But she
felt it would have been more benefi
cial if Bush had raised the case "di
rectly, one-on-one" with the Chinese
President.
Nonetheless, these diplomatic ef
forts are "really imperative" for se
curing an early release, according to
Hoover. "The support Jude has re
ceived on Capitol Hill has been in
strumental in keeping his case in the
public eye.

An Impassive System
Public diplomacy from the U.S. is
especially important in Shao's case
because working from within the
Chinese judicial system has so far
proven ineffective.
Shao has petitioned four times for
new proof of his innocence to be re
viewed. but he has received no reply
from Chinese courts. Hoover said,
"which is a violation of their own
law."
"We do not have any confidence
that the Chinese government will re
spond [to the petitions] and rectify
this situation," he said.
This has made it necessary to
place Shao's case in a political con
text, namely within the framework
of the human rights dialogue be
tween the U.S. and China.
John Kamm is one of the people
working on this aspect of the case.
Kamm is the founder and chairman
of the Dui Hua Foundation, a non
profit organization dedicated to fos
tering human rights in China by
means of diplomacy with the United
States.
"The U.S. and China are dis
cussing a resumption of the dialogue
on human rights, which has been sus
pended since last march," Kamm
told The Daily. "It's a very good sign
that Shao is on the priority list of key
cases on that agenda."
However, it is not clear where
these diplomatic avenues will lead. If
the goal is getting the Chinese sys
tem to grant a retrial or to admit new
evidence, Kamm is skeptical about
whether that can be achieved at all.
In a speech made at the 10-year
reunion of Shao's graduating class,
Kamm said that, for the Chinese
government, granting Shao's legal
petitions would amount to admitting
that mistakes had been made in their
courts, and in China this is simply un
heard of.
Alternative Hopes tor Release

Shao's heart ailment may
be best chance out of jail

Other news in the case has been
bittersweet. Prison doctors recently
diagnosed Shao with a heart condi
tion that cannot be treated in China,
Hoover said. Although tragic in it
self, his condition will qualify him to
be released from prison on medical
parole.
According to Kamm, the prison
warden would be allowed to grant
the parole on his own authority.
Therefore, Shao's release could by
pass the Chinese government.
"In terms of early release from
prison, the most probable route to
success is medical parole," Kamm
said.
If released this way, Shao would
be allowed to leave China until he
recovers from his illness. Legally, he
would still be serving his sentence
and could continue to petition the
courts from abroad.
Shao applied for medical parole
last June, but has yet to receive any
reply, said Hoover. Diplomatic pres
sure could also be instrumental in
winning the parole, which would
allow the Chinese government to re
lease Shao without admitting to any
flaws in their legal system.
In terms of diplomacy, Kamm
said Rice could be an "absolutely
critical" ally in Shao's case.
"If she, in her new position, were
to write a letter, it would have a ter
rific impact," Kamm said.
Hoover agreed, saying that "the
current focus is to get a meeting with
Condoleezza Rice, because we think
it is important that the new Secretary
of State is familiar with this case and
that she bring it up with her Chinese
counterpart."
Still, according to Kamm, it will
not be any one letter that wins
Shao's freedom.
"Rarely is it a single action or ef
fort, but the accumulation [of them J
that makes the Chinese government
act on these kinds of cases," Kamm
said. "So the road to that can be a
long and winding one."
While students at Stanford's
Graduate School of Business lay am
bitious plans for the future, the fate
of Jude Shao, Class of l l )93 at the
Business School, stands as a re
minder that life does not always un
fold as planned.
Despite the efforts of his support
ers, who have doggedly lobbied to
secure his release from prison in
Shanghai, Shao is currently serving
his sixth year of a 16-year sentence
for what many observers view to be
fallacious tax charges.
However, a number of recent de
velopments provide Shao's support
ers with renewed hope. These devel
opments include the diagnosis of
Shao's heart condition, diplomatic
efforts by the U.S. State Department
and overtures to solicit the help of
newly appointed Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice.
Shao's lengthy prison sentence
stemmed from his refusal to pay a
$60,000 "special tax audit bond,"

which Shao considered to be a bribe.
Chinese tax auditors, taking Shao's
refusal as an insult, had him arrested
and jailed incommunicado for two
years. He was barred from hiring a
lawyer until 10 days before the trial,
and consequently, Shao could not

very supportive," Pham said.
Three members of Congress have
also been working on Shao's case —
Anna Eshoo (D-Palo Alto), Zoe
Lofgren (D-San Jose) and Mike
Honda (D-Campbell). They have
co-authored numerous letters to
both American and Chinese offi
cials, including then-Secretary of
State Colin Powell and Chinese Am
bassador Yang Jiechi.
"I think it is very important to
stay on it," Eshoo said in an inter
view with The Daily. "If you don't
keep the pressure on. most frankly,
these issues are forgotten."
A significant victory came after
the representatives sent a letter to
President George W. Bush last No
vember. The letter urged Bush to
bring Shao's case to the attention of
Chinese President Hu Jintao at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit.
The U.S. Department of State re
sponded to the letter, saying James
Kelly — assistant secretary for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs — had
taken time at the summit to lobby se
nior Chinese officials on Shao's be
half.
There is no word as to how the
Chinese responded. But the letter
from the State Department stated
that the White House has "regularly
raised [Shao's] case both publicly
and privately."
Eshoo said these actions are
"more than appropriate." But she
felt it would have been more benefi
cial if Bush had raised the case "di
rectly, one-on-one" with the Chinese
President.
Nonetheless, these diplomatic ef
forts are "really imperative" for se
curing an early release, according to
Hoover. "The support Jude has re
ceived on Capitol Hill has been in
strumental in keeping his case in the
public eye.

An Impassive System
Public diplomacy from the U.S. is
especially important in Shao's case
because working from within the
Chinese judicial system has so far
proven ineffective.
Shao has petitioned four times for
new proof of his innocence to be re
viewed. but he has received no reply
from Chinese courts. Hoover said,
"which is a violation of their own
law."
"We do not have any confidence
that the Chinese government will re
spond [to the petitions] and rectify
this situation," he said.
This has made it necessary to
place Shao's case in a political con
text, namely within the framework
of the human rights dialogue be
tween the U.S. and China.
John Kamm is one of the people
working on this aspect of the case.
Kamm is the founder and chairman
of the Dui Hua Foundation, a non
profit organization dedicated to fos
tering human rights in China by
means of diplomacy with the United
States.
"The U.S. and China are dis
cussing a resumption of the dialogue
on human rights, which has been sus
pended since last march," Kamm
told The Daily. "It's a very good sign
that Shao is on the priority list of key
cases on that agenda."
However, it is not clear where
these diplomatic avenues will lead. If
the goal is getting the Chinese sys
tem to grant a retrial or to admit new
evidence, Kamm is skeptical about
whether that can be achieved at all.
In a speech made at the 10-year
reunion of Shao's graduating class,
Kamm said that, for the Chinese
government, granting Shao's legal
petitions would amount to admitting
that mistakes had been made in their
courts, and in China this is simply un
heard of.
Alternative Hopes tor Release

Shao's heart ailment may
be best chance out of jail

Other news in the case has been
bittersweet. Prison doctors recently
diagnosed Shao with a heart condi
tion that cannot be treated in China,
Hoover said. Although tragic in it
self, his condition will qualify him to
be released from prison on medical
parole.
According to Kamm, the prison
warden would be allowed to grant
the parole on his own authority.
Therefore, Shao's release could by
pass the Chinese government.
"In terms of early release from
prison, the most probable route to
success is medical parole," Kamm
said.
If released this way, Shao would
be allowed to leave China until he
recovers from his illness. Legally, he
would still be serving his sentence
and could continue to petition the
courts from abroad.
Shao applied for medical parole
last June, but has yet to receive any
reply, said Hoover. Diplomatic pres
sure could also be instrumental in
winning the parole, which would
allow the Chinese government to re
lease Shao without admitting to any
flaws in their legal system.
In terms of diplomacy, Kamm
said Rice could be an "absolutely
critical" ally in Shao's case.
"If she, in her new position, were
to write a letter, it would have a ter
rific impact," Kamm said.
Hoover agreed, saying that "the
current focus is to get a meeting with
Condoleezza Rice, because we think
it is important that the new Secretary
of State is familiar with this case and
that she bring it up with her Chinese
counterpart."
Still, according to Kamm, it will
not be any one letter that wins
Shao's freedom.
"Rarely is it a single action or ef
fort, but the accumulation [of them J
that makes the Chinese government
act on these kinds of cases," Kamm
said. "So the road to that can be a
long and winding one."
