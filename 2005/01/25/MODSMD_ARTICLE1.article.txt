While students at Stanford's
Graduate School of Business lay am
bitious plans for the future, the fate
of Jude Shao, Class of l l )93 at the
Business School, stands as a re
minder that life does not always un
fold as planned.
Despite the efforts of his support
ers, who have doggedly lobbied to
secure his release from prison in
Shanghai, Shao is currently serving
his sixth year of a 16-year sentence
for what many observers view to be
fallacious tax charges.
However, a number of recent de
velopments provide Shao's support
ers with renewed hope. These devel
opments include the diagnosis of
Shao's heart condition, diplomatic
efforts by the U.S. State Department
and overtures to solicit the help of
newly appointed Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice.
Shao's lengthy prison sentence
stemmed from his refusal to pay a
$60,000 "special tax audit bond,"

which Shao considered to be a bribe.
Chinese tax auditors, taking Shao's
refusal as an insult, had him arrested
and jailed incommunicado for two
years. He was barred from hiring a
lawyer until 10 days before the trial,
and consequently, Shao could not
prepare a meaningful defense.
In March of 2000. a Shanghai
Court sentenced him to 16 years in
prison for tax evasion.
The Effort from Home
Shao's friends and family have
been unrelenting in fighting for his
release. Chuck Hoover, Shao's for
mer roommate at Stanford, spear
headed the Free Jude Shao Cam
paign, which is largely responsible
for drawing public attention to the
case and for soliciting government
support.
"While Jude [Shao| is working
the official appeals route in China,
we — his classmates in the U.S. —
are trying to find ways for the U.S. to
influence China," said Lane Ahn
