# SOCIAL INNOVATION
## An education with a mission 
### LIJA MCHUGH ADAM STONE 
Nestled in Silicon Valley, a hub of innovation and cre
ativity, Stanford has many ties to industry, including
biotech, information technology and finance. But the ties
don't end there: Stanford is also linked to many leading
companies involved in social innovation and, as a result,
has become the leading undergraduate institution in this
field. Over the past six years, since the first class in social
entrepreneurship started, student interest has grown
tremendously in innovative non-profits and for-profits
with social missions.
The contemporary social innovation movement arose
primarily in the Bay Area. It was built up from a combi
nation of new wealth, socially conscious business leaders
and entrepreneurial spirit. Many nationally renowned
nonprofits and for-profits such as Delancey Street and
The Bridgespan Group began in the Bay Area. Local
foundations, such as the Hewlett Foundation and
Packard Foundation, have played important roles in
shaping the movement and the nonprofit sector.
Stanford benefits from being located in the heartland
of social innovation. Both the Graduate School of
Business and the undergraduate programs have begun
to promote and involve students in the growing field.
The Stanford Graduate School of Business houses
the Center for Social Innovation in addition to the
Public Management Program for MBA students. The
Center for Social Innovation sponsors research, organiz
es conferences and publishes the quarterly "Stanford
Social Innovation Review," a journal on managing and
improving nonprofits. The Center for Social Innovation
brings together scholars and people with experience and
research in these areas to help nonprofit leaders find
new ideas and operate effectively.
Stanford students are fortunate in that they have the
opportunity to take courses from some of the leaders in
this field. The Public Policy and Urban Studies Programs
offer several course options for students who wish to
study social entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurship
bourses such as the SE Collaboratory give students the
chance to work in groups and actually develop a busi
ness plan for an organization that would work to meet a
certain social need.
Last quarter, a team of students from FUSION, the
Future Social Innovators Network, and the GSB's
Public Management Program worked with Melanie
Edwards, the founder of Mobile Media and GSB
Associate Prof, of Organizational Behavior Jim Phills to
put on a one-unit lecture series where a variety of social
entrepreneurs spoke about the evolution and growth of
their organizations.
The social entrepreneurship curriculum has empow
ered several teams of students to participate in the annu
al business plan competition put on by the Business
Association for Stanford Engineering Students, com
monly known as BASES. The competition started with
an Innovator Challenge and an Entrepreneur
Challenge, but has expanded to include a Social
Entrepreneur Challenge. The SE Collaboratory directly
prepares students for this socially minded business plan
competition, where teams of Stanford students compete
to win a cash prize of a few thousand dollars which can
be used to fund the starting of their organizations. A
series of presentation rounds are judged by Bay Area
social entrepreneurs, thus simultaneously creating a
forum for discussion and networking as well as a way for
students to get feedback from experienced practitioners.
Undergraduate student groups also have focused on
promoting social enterpreneurship on campus. The stu
dent group FUSION, to which we belong, has promoted
social innovation and entrepreneurship among under
graduates at campus over the last three years. The group
initially grew out of a class on social entrepreneurship by
one of the academic leaders in the field. Prof. J. Gregory
Dees, then at Stanford and currently at Duke University.
The group has sponsored conferences, classes in public
policy and consulting projects with local non-profits.
"The class made me realize that social entrepreneur
ship had the potential to unite the differences between
public service and entrepreneurial communities at
Stanford," said Tarek Ghani, Class of 2003 and co
founder of Fusion.
The Stanford Association for International
Development has also worked to promote social innova
tion on campus over the last three years. For the last
three years, the group has organized events for students
to learn more about international development, includ
ing an annual conference. The conference this year,
which will be held on Feb. 26 in Bishop Auditorium, will
focus on the role of non-governmental organizations
and others in improving international health. The con
ference is entitled, "Innovations in Improving Access to
Health Care: Appropriate and Feasible?"
"We hope the conference will get students more
interested in innovative ideas in international develop
ment and health," said senior Christina Riechers. the
conference co-coordinator.
Social innovation is obviously alive and well at
Stanford. There are endless opportunities for students to
get involved through classes, student groups, competi
tions and more. In order for social innovation to create
real change more is needed: Ideas and inspiration need
to become real organizations that change real lives.

interested in innovative ideas in international develop
ment and health," said senior Christina Riechers. the
conference co-coordinator.
Social innovation is obviously alive and well at
Stanford. There are endless opportunities for students to
get involved through classes, student groups, competi
tions and more. In order for social innovation to create
real change more is needed: Ideas and inspiration need
to become real organizations that change real lives.

Nestled in Silicon Valley, a hub of innovation and cre
ativity, Stanford has many ties to industry, including
biotech, information technology and finance. But the ties
don't end there: Stanford is also linked to many leading
companies involved in social innovation and, as a result,
has become the leading undergraduate institution in this
field. Over the past six years, since the first class in social
entrepreneurship started, student interest has grown
tremendously in innovative non-profits and for-profits
with social missions.
The contemporary social innovation movement arose
primarily in the Bay Area. It was built up from a combi
nation of new wealth, socially conscious business leaders
and entrepreneurial spirit. Many nationally renowned
nonprofits and for-profits such as Delancey Street and
The Bridgespan Group began in the Bay Area. Local
foundations, such as the Hewlett Foundation and
Packard Foundation, have played important roles in
shaping the movement and the nonprofit sector.
Stanford benefits from being located in the heartland
of social innovation. Both the Graduate School of
Business and the undergraduate programs have begun
to promote and involve students in the growing field.
The Stanford Graduate School of Business houses
the Center for Social Innovation in addition to the
Public Management Program for MBA students. The
Center for Social Innovation sponsors research, organiz
es conferences and publishes the quarterly "Stanford
Social Innovation Review," a journal on managing and
improving nonprofits. The Center for Social Innovation
brings together scholars and people with experience and
research in these areas to help nonprofit leaders find
new ideas and operate effectively.
Stanford students are fortunate in that they have the
opportunity to take courses from some of the leaders in
this field. The Public Policy and Urban Studies Programs
offer several course options for students who wish to
study social entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurship
bourses such as the SE Collaboratory give students the
chance to work in groups and actually develop a busi
ness plan for an organization that would work to meet a
certain social need.
Last quarter, a team of students from FUSION, the
Future Social Innovators Network, and the GSB's
Public Management Program worked with Melanie
Edwards, the founder of Mobile Media and GSB
Associate Prof, of Organizational Behavior Jim Phills to
put on a one-unit lecture series where a variety of social
entrepreneurs spoke about the evolution and growth of
their organizations.
The social entrepreneurship curriculum has empow
ered several teams of students to participate in the annu
al business plan competition put on by the Business
Association for Stanford Engineering Students, com
monly known as BASES. The competition started with
an Innovator Challenge and an Entrepreneur
Challenge, but has expanded to include a Social
Entrepreneur Challenge. The SE Collaboratory directly
prepares students for this socially minded business plan
competition, where teams of Stanford students compete
to win a cash prize of a few thousand dollars which can
be used to fund the starting of their organizations. A
series of presentation rounds are judged by Bay Area
social entrepreneurs, thus simultaneously creating a
forum for discussion and networking as well as a way for
students to get feedback from experienced practitioners.
Undergraduate student groups also have focused on
promoting social enterpreneurship on campus. The stu
dent group FUSION, to which we belong, has promoted
social innovation and entrepreneurship among under
graduates at campus over the last three years. The group
initially grew out of a class on social entrepreneurship by
one of the academic leaders in the field. Prof. J. Gregory
Dees, then at Stanford and currently at Duke University.
The group has sponsored conferences, classes in public
policy and consulting projects with local non-profits.
"The class made me realize that social entrepreneur
ship had the potential to unite the differences between
public service and entrepreneurial communities at
Stanford," said Tarek Ghani, Class of 2003 and co
founder of Fusion.
The Stanford Association for International
Development has also worked to promote social innova
tion on campus over the last three years. For the last
three years, the group has organized events for students
to learn more about international development, includ
ing an annual conference. The conference this year,
which will be held on Feb. 26 in Bishop Auditorium, will
focus on the role of non-governmental organizations
and others in improving international health. The con
ference is entitled, "Innovations in Improving Access to
Health Care: Appropriate and Feasible?"
