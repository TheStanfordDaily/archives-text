# Digital photography: Managing your collection
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
One of the wonders of digital pho
tography is that you can take hun
dreds of shots at any one event and
never have to worry about running
out of film.
After you've pretended to be one
of the paparazzi, however, there
remains that one small nagging ques
tion: What in the world are you going

to do with all of those pictures?
Some super-organizers post their
pictures on their personal Web sites
on a regular basis, sharing them with
friends and family. For the rest of us,
there are some great software pack
ages that can help you organize, edit
and share your digital pictures. And
since you've already spent the big
bucks on the camera, you need not
worry about spending more: All of
the software mentioned costs you
zip.

Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0
Starter Edition
Tiie Case: A great product for the
casual photographer, the Adobe
Photoshop Album 2.0 Starter Edition
is not as souped-up as the full ver
sion. but it offers a great way to
organize your photos by attaching
"identifying tags" based on events,
places, people — or any categories
you can think of.
You can also easily fix red-eye,
crop your pictures and change them
to black-and-white or sepia. Plus, in
many cases, it identifies when the pic
ture was taken (based on when you
downloaded it) so you can keep track
of your memories chronologically.
The Verdicr Best for the techno
phobe, but may fall short of features
for someone who wants to manipu
late photos in a more sophisticated
manner.

Google Picasa 2
The Case: First there was Google.
Then there was Gmail. Now, Google
wants to get into your pictures. Aside
the fact that Google's starting to
remind us a little of Microsoft
(monopoly, anyone?), at least this soft
ware is free. Picasa finds all of the pic
tures stored in your computer and
sorts them into files based on their
date. For the photo editor in you,
Picasa offers lots of tools. Sure, you
can crop and fix red-eye — standard
editing fare — but you can also add
captions to your pictures, fine-tune
pictures by playing around with color,
contrast and brightness.
Google also makes it easy to share

your digital masterpieces: Picasa
resizes shots so your friends can easi
ly download attachments, allows you
to instant-message pictures with
"Hello," Picasa's included instant
message product — and you can even
start your own blog.
And if you have some, ahem, "pri
vate" shots, you can even password
protect selected photos. Handy, eh?
The Verdict: A multitude of edit
ing, sharing and organize features
makes Picasa a keeper.

HP Imacje Zone Express
The Case: Like Picasa, HP's Image
Zone Express finds all of the pictures
on your computer so you don't have to
manually add them to your new digital
album. For those who like creating
photo collages or nicely organized
album pages with multiple photos.
Image Zone Express has a nice feature
that allows you to pick pictures and
place them on a variety of templates.
While you can't categorize your pic
tures like you can with the Adobe soft
ware, you can attach keywords to each
picture, in case you need a way to find
them later.
The photo editing features, howev
er, are somewhat meager — though
the simple interface may appeal to
some. For example, while other, more
sophisticated photo editing software
lets you figure out exactly how much
cyan or red tone you want your photo
to have. Image Zone gives you two
choices: you can go "warmer" or
"cooler."
The Verdict: Great if you like to
make albums and don't want very
technical photo-editing software.

some. For example, while other, more
sophisticated photo editing software
lets you figure out exactly how much
cyan or red tone you want your photo
to have. Image Zone gives you two
choices: you can go "warmer" or
"cooler."
The Verdict: Great if you like to
make albums and don't want very
technical photo-editing software.

One of the wonders of digital pho
tography is that you can take hun
dreds of shots at any one event and
never have to worry about running
out of film.
After you've pretended to be one
of the paparazzi, however, there
remains that one small nagging ques
tion: What in the world are you going

to do with all of those pictures?
Some super-organizers post their
pictures on their personal Web sites
on a regular basis, sharing them with
friends and family. For the rest of us,
there are some great software pack
ages that can help you organize, edit
and share your digital pictures. And
since you've already spent the big
bucks on the camera, you need not
worry about spending more: All of
the software mentioned costs you
zip.

Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0
Starter Edition
Tiie Case: A great product for the
casual photographer, the Adobe
Photoshop Album 2.0 Starter Edition
is not as souped-up as the full ver
sion. but it offers a great way to
organize your photos by attaching
"identifying tags" based on events,
places, people — or any categories
you can think of.
You can also easily fix red-eye,
crop your pictures and change them
to black-and-white or sepia. Plus, in
many cases, it identifies when the pic
ture was taken (based on when you
downloaded it) so you can keep track
of your memories chronologically.
The Verdicr Best for the techno
phobe, but may fall short of features
for someone who wants to manipu
late photos in a more sophisticated
manner.

Google Picasa 2
The Case: First there was Google.
Then there was Gmail. Now, Google
wants to get into your pictures. Aside
the fact that Google's starting to
remind us a little of Microsoft
(monopoly, anyone?), at least this soft
ware is free. Picasa finds all of the pic
tures stored in your computer and
sorts them into files based on their
date. For the photo editor in you,
Picasa offers lots of tools. Sure, you
can crop and fix red-eye — standard
editing fare — but you can also add
captions to your pictures, fine-tune
pictures by playing around with color,
contrast and brightness.
Google also makes it easy to share

your digital masterpieces: Picasa
resizes shots so your friends can easi
ly download attachments, allows you
to instant-message pictures with
"Hello," Picasa's included instant
message product — and you can even
start your own blog.
And if you have some, ahem, "pri
vate" shots, you can even password
protect selected photos. Handy, eh?
The Verdict: A multitude of edit
ing, sharing and organize features
makes Picasa a keeper.

HP Imacje Zone Express
The Case: Like Picasa, HP's Image
Zone Express finds all of the pictures
on your computer so you don't have to
manually add them to your new digital
album. For those who like creating
photo collages or nicely organized
album pages with multiple photos.
Image Zone Express has a nice feature
that allows you to pick pictures and
place them on a variety of templates.
While you can't categorize your pic
tures like you can with the Adobe soft
ware, you can attach keywords to each
picture, in case you need a way to find
them later.
The photo editing features, howev
er, are somewhat meager — though
the simple interface may appeal to
some. For example, while other, more
sophisticated photo editing software
lets you figure out exactly how much
cyan or red tone you want your photo
to have. Image Zone gives you two
choices: you can go "warmer" or
"cooler."
The Verdict: Great if you like to
make albums and don't want very
technical photo-editing software.
