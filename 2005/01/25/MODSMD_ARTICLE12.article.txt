# Tech news you can use
## Buying a computer when you're low on cash 
### ANETO OKONKWO 
Whenever you walk into a computer store, the
choices are dazzling. Bright, crisp-looking screens,
features galore — your options seem endless. A
quick look at the price tags, and suddenly your
choices become much more limited.
For less than $1,000, you will have to make compro
mises on the speed, memory, screen size and warranty.
Luckily, fierce competition is forcing major players like
Apple, Dell, Fujitsu, Gateway, HP, IBM. Sony and
Toshiba to offer quality low-cost options.
The concept of low-cost computing began three
decades ago. with innovations tike the PDP-11 and
Altair 8800. These early computers lacked screens,
keyboards and memory — they could only perform
simple computations. Over time, mass production
and improved technology have resulted in
decreased computer prices. For example, the cost of
memory is about 8.000 times cheaper today than it
was 12 years ago.
Now you're probably wondering: "How can I
join the low-cost revolution, and what are my
options?"

If you are in a rush, you could jog down to the
Bookstore and grab the cheapest models, decently
priced around $934 for laptops and $599 for desk
tops. To supplement the Bookstore's limited selec
tion. Stanford's Information Technology Services
and Systems maintains discount programs with
Apple, Dell and several other hardware and soft
ware providers. Using these programs, faculty, staff
and students can purchase desktop, laptop and soft
ware bundles at discounted prices. I capitalized on
this deal last year and saved over $300.

Beyond Stanford, there are many avenues for
researching products and buying on a student budg
et. For example, you can shop around with CNET
(http://www.cnet.com), a trusted source of con
sumer technology advice. CNET boasts a directory
of more than 200,000 consumer electronics with
downloads, reviews and price comparisons.
Students and other consumers are often led
astray by glossy marketing and insufficient product
knowledge.Take the time to research before buying
your computer because a faster and cheaper com

puter can make all the difference in your course
work and your wallet.
The drive toward faster, cheaper computers is
not just central to a student's cost-of-living, but also
has greater implications for lowering cost curves for
computing all over the world. Last December,
China's low-cost computer giant, Lenovo, made the
move to purchase IBM's PC unit.This month Apple
announced a major push toward the low-cost com
puter market with the release of the $500 Mac Mini.
Cheaper computers will enable millions of peo
ple with fewer resources to connect to the Internet,
allowing them to communicate, gain access to
knowledge and improve their quality of life. Today,
there are 57.5 million computers used globally, and
this number is expected to double by 2010 driven by
the emerging markets of Russia. China and India.
In the 1980s, Bill Gates boldly proposed to put a
computer in every home in America — perhaps
with cheaper computers we can fulfill that promise.
