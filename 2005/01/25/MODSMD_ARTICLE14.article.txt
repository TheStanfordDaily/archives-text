## Editorial Recreational reading needed 
### 
Stanford students can attend athletic events,
musical performances, plays and movies with
out leaving campus. However, if students want
to find a book for recreational reading, their
on-campus resources are sparse.
Fora cultural institution that prides itself on
healthy outlets for the high pressure of daily course
work, the absence of recreational reading on-campus
reflects an area in which the University should work
hard to improve.
Stanford should set up a recreational reading
room. It would allow students to check out contem
porary fiction without making a two-and-a-half mile
trip off campus to Palo Alto's main library.
Unfortunately, Green Library does not purchase
books for pleasure reading. Regarded as a research li
brary, Green's separate departments buy books that
they perceive have significant research value. Popular
fiction is purchased if it satisfies one of two condi
tions: if the author has attained cultural significance
or if the book has excellent literary value.
This translates into a limited selection of pleasure
reading for students. Collections that focus on au
thors with cultural significance, like Steven King, are
purchased ad nauseum, at the expense of literary va
riety. Simultaneously, fiction that displays literary
value can be esoteric and might not provide students
with the recreational reading they seek.

Unsigned editorials in this space represent the views of the members of The Daily's editorial hoard. 7he board consists
of six Daily opinions staffers and three community members at-large. Any signed columns and contributions
are the views of their respective writers ami do not necessarily represent the views of the editoriid hoard.

Stanford should make it a priority to independent
ly fund a reading collection of a more recreational na
ture. With surging undergraduate donations and
alumni who are eager to improve the quality of edu
cation that Stanford provides, funding for such a col
lection is likely to be obtained if asked for.
More difficult is the problem of space. However, if
the University converted part of the space Green cur
rently uses to create a room similar to the Bender
Room, the benefit to students would outweigh the
costs of relocating library resources.
In order to build a solid collection of good reads,
the popular novels Green already has could be found,
consolidated and moved to the new reading room.
Additionally, material could be purchased to include
enjoyable reads that might not have as much cultural
significance or literary value, but which nevertheless
have endured over time.
By combining the recreational reading that Green
already has with the popular reading it is missing, the
University could minimize costs while maximizing
student benefit.
Stanford should work hard to make this possibility
a reality. If a reading room is created, for the first time
Stanford students would then have a place on campus
where they could go to escape the pressures of class in
the pleasures of a good book.
