# Holt's Harangue
## Protests are useless, but so much fun 
### CHRIS HOLT 
1 was at the anti-inauguration
rally the other day, and I had an
epiphany. While I was yelling and
feeling empowered with the dozens
who showed up, I suddenly asked
myself some questions:
Why wasn't this making a differ
ence? Why weren't our voices being
heard? Why didn't our huge "pin
the grievance on King George" ar
ticulate the point we wanted to get
across?
Why didn't our satirical Bush /
Cheney impersonators reaffirm our
beliefs for the next four years? Why
didn't our angry Marxist author
spark serious debate?
I've yelled "fur is murder!" until
I was hoarse, I've been a member of
PETA since I saw "Bambi" and I've
been to so many hotel lock-outs that
I forget what a lobby looks like.
None of it has made a difference.
Then I think, well, maybe Daily
columnist Will Nelson is right:
Maybe the left is hurting this nation.
Maybe we could be having so much
more fun without the signs or harsh
language. Replace the hate-speech
with the hacky sacks, the "Bush =
Satan" fliers with devil sticks.
Instead, maybe. I should work to
put the "party" back in Democratic.

1 mean, these protest thingies just
aren't working. Nelson is right: We
can't persuade people using large
signs and over-the-top rhetoric.
Protests may have helped to end
the Vietnam War early, hut every
one knows that what is happening in
Iraq right now has no parallels to
that. So. might as well quit with the
whole anti-war thing ... voicing our
opinions over the long term will have
no impact.
But I'm not saying we can't have
gatherings. 'Cause honestly, we lib
erals aren't just in it for the free tear
gas. We're in it for the ass. That's
right: Hippie chicks are easy, and
they are more than willing to reveal
themselves in the name of animal
rights or women's rights or whatev
er it is we're bitching about this
week.
With an end to over-the-top
rhetoric, we hope to be able to reach
out to our Republican brethren. To
gether, we can throw one hell of a
kegger. Stanford Republicans:
Bring the red plastic cups and meet
us at White Plaza, we'll protest
homework together. Whoo!
Then, thankfully, we can stop
hurting America with our leftist po
litical demonstrations. We can stop
with our baseless, hate-filled accusa
tions: "Bush was misleading the

li.S. into going into Iraq!" "Condi
lied under oath!" "Bush is bad for
the environment!" 1 mean, do these
slogans have any basis in reality?
The right's tactics, on the other
hand, are much better for America.
Creating hundreds of prop graves
to demonstrate that abortion is
murder? Fine by me.
Angry protestors barring
women from having the legal right
to an abortion? Sounds good.
Having groups like the Ameri
can Family Association petition
against gay rights? Go for it.
Funding the Swift Boat Veter
ans for Truth to tarnish a candi
date's war record that you previ
ously said you wouldn't touch?
Why not?
If anybody wants me, I'll be
teaching the anti-Roe v. Wade peo
ple how to dreadlock their hair and
make hemp necklaces. Also, dead
baby jokes. Lots of them.
C hris thinks both parties are full of
loon it's. But it's important that nei
ther side remain silent, especially
the one that is out of power. Send
complaints to c ho/K&stanfortl edu if
you didn 't get that this column is a
satire.

Protests may have helped to end
the Vietnam War early, hut every
one knows that what is happening in
Iraq right now has no parallels to
that. So. might as well quit with the
whole anti-war thing ... voicing our
opinions over the long term will have
no impact.
But I'm not saying we can't have
gatherings. 'Cause honestly, we lib
erals aren't just in it for the free tear
gas. We're in it for the ass. That's
right: Hippie chicks are easy, and
they are more than willing to reveal
themselves in the name of animal
rights or women's rights or whatev
er it is we're bitching about this
week.
With an end to over-the-top
rhetoric, we hope to be able to reach
out to our Republican brethren. To
gether, we can throw one hell of a
kegger. Stanford Republicans:
Bring the red plastic cups and meet
us at White Plaza, we'll protest
homework together. Whoo!
Then, thankfully, we can stop
hurting America with our leftist po
litical demonstrations. We can stop
with our baseless, hate-filled accusa
tions: "Bush was misleading the

li.S. into going into Iraq!" "Condi
lied under oath!" "Bush is bad for
the environment!" 1 mean, do these
slogans have any basis in reality?
The right's tactics, on the other
hand, are much better for America.
Creating hundreds of prop graves
to demonstrate that abortion is
murder? Fine by me.
Angry protestors barring
women from having the legal right
to an abortion? Sounds good.
Having groups like the Ameri
can Family Association petition
against gay rights? Go for it.
Funding the Swift Boat Veter
ans for Truth to tarnish a candi
date's war record that you previ
ously said you wouldn't touch?
Why not?
If anybody wants me, I'll be
teaching the anti-Roe v. Wade peo
ple how to dreadlock their hair and
make hemp necklaces. Also, dead
baby jokes. Lots of them.
C hris thinks both parties are full of
loon it's. But it's important that nei
ther side remain silent, especially
the one that is out of power. Send
complaints to c ho/K&stanfortl edu if
you didn 't get that this column is a
satire.
