Anti-abortion protesters should
respect women's choices
I am writing in response to the
anti-abortion presentation that was
displayed in the White Plaza area of
campus on Monday.
As the director of the Women's
Community Center, one of my re
sponsibilities to the campus commu
nity is to provide outreach to women
students. It is in this capacity that I
feel compelled to offer an alterna
tive to the aforementioned exhibit,
which contained a mock graveyard
of fetuses, presumably symbolizing
death due to abortion.
To be clear, I am not questioning
the right of anti-abortion students to
express their viewpoints. What con
cerns me is the impact that dramatic
representations like this have on

students who may have exercised
their right to an abortion in the past
or are planning to do so in the fu
ture. Women students walking to
class should not have to see images
designed to induce guilt and anxiety
over a practice that has been
deemed both safe and legal.
Women students struggling with an
unplanned pregnancy need support
and information, not a gratuitous
display.
I offer the Women's Community
Center as a place where women stu
dents can seek support and informa
tion in an environment that ac
knowledges their decision-making
capacities as intelligent and capable
adults. We respect the full range of
women's choices and will not seek to
control or limit a student's options.
Conversely, we will not suggest
abortion if this is something a

woman student has decided is im
moral or unethical in her worldview.
The point is that women students
at Stanford have the right to be re
spected and validated for their
choices, particularly the tough ones.
I offer myself and the other staff of
the Women's Community Center as
resources for women students seek
ing information and support in an
environment that promotes their
freedom.

Abortion foes should advocate for
changes to help pregnant women
I saw the crosses today. Although
I am no longer an active Catholic,
the use of the cross still elicits a

deeply emotional response from
me. I do not approve of abortion,
but I also do not approve of making
it illegal, because that leaves vulner
able women in the lurch. The only
truly compassionate balance here is
a pro-choice balance.
Pro-life groups could do their
cause a huge service by advocating
changes to our system and society
that would ensure that women did
not feel helpless or alone when fac
ing an unwanted pregnancy. That
would probably save more lives than
shoving a hugely emotional and sig
nificant symbol in the face of our de
cidedly pro-choice student body.
You are hurting a lot of people who
struggle to deal with this difficult
balance.

Liberal columnist asked
tfie wrong question
I wish Kai Stinchcombe had
asked a different question in his
op-ed piece "What Kind of Con
servative Are You?" (Jan. 24),
maybe along the lines of "Why do
you support President Bush's for
eign policy?" or 'Which particular
points on the Republican agenda
made you vote the way you did?"
Maybe that way he would've
learned something about Republi
can supporters on this campus
rather than wasting time on an arti
cle without much substance. It
seems that it's not the Republicans
that need to "get a handle on the
latest phenomenon to hit campus,"
but a few Democratic supporters
â€” on the fact the Democrats lost

the election.
I am afraid "classifying" your
opponents is not a substitute for lis
tening to their opinions (and I'd
rather not classify the radical left
supporters with "Zionism =
Nazism"' and "Support Iraqi resis
tance" signs). However, I think
most people will agree that valid
points are being made by both sides
in debates and discussions between
the Democrats and Republicans.
Yes. listening is much harder than
yelling, chanting and beating on the
drums (as they do in Berkeley when
a conservative speaker comes to
campus), but I think it has more
chances of paying off in under
standing and respect between the
two parties.
