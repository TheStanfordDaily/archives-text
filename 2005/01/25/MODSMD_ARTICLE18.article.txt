# Sketch: Tales of Graduate Student Life
## Beauty is out there 
### 
My younger colleagues at
The Daily have being
commenting lately on
the ugliness (or other
wise) of Stanford students (see
"Stanford kids are ugly," Jan. 15,
and "Beauty and/or the brains,"
Jan. l l >). Since originality doesn't
really have a place in student jour
nalism, 1 thought I'd jump on the
bandwagon.
In fact, with the wisdom of age
and my refined continental outlook,
it seems clear that I can offer a level
headed assessment of the playing
field.
First off, I must confess that in
some respects I'm not that well
placed to comment on the attractive
ness of the Stanford community. This
is, of course, because the undergrad-

uate population
does tend to ap
pear as an amor
phous mass once
you've reached
the lofty status of
a graduate.
However, I
made a special ef
fort last week to
try and peer into
the hordes of
screaming chil-

dren and count the relative numbers
ol titties (you may have noticed that
I'm trying to popularize this word in
the New World, so please, tell all
your friends).
The results? Well, you do okay.
Obviously, one has to adjust for the
fact that almost everyone on cam
pus needs immediate help with their
dress sense (white socks are bad,
having the word "Stanford" plas
tered over your apparel is not cool).
Once you get past deficiencies of
taste, though, the raw material is re
ally quite reasonable. Bodies are
relatively lithe, faces are relatively
symmetrical and personalities are
relatively ... well, who cares?
In the negative column, though, 1
did move to California largely on
the visual evidence of teenage T.V.
shows and slick Hollywood movies,
so I can't help but be a little bit dis
appointed at the available talent.
Still, it's definitely a step up from
the suburbs of London.
Actually, the prettiness of youth
is not particularly relevant to most
grads. It is, after all. almost impossi
ble to penetrate the market given
the glass ceiling / Chinese wall / bar
rier of sketchiness / general annoy
ance at (im)maturity.
Instead, we must turn to our own
kind, and make a frank assessment
of their "abilities." Here the out

look is rather grim.
There are several problems with
the average attractiveness of the
graduate student community. Fore
most among these is the existence of
electrical engineers. And computer
scientists. And physicists.
Even if you get past that problem
by hanging out on the fluffy side of
campus, there are still more obsta
cles to overcome in your quest for
"more than a sparkling intellect and
engaging personality."
While most of the Stanford com
munity needs fashion help, grads
are in a league of their own. It's the
first time in my life I've moved in a
group where wearing socks with
sandals is an acceptable style choice.
I pride myself on my ability to
spot a looker although they may
be buried under layers of bad
taste. Doing it amongst my peers
at the Farm, though, is proving a
challenge.
Of course, even if you hang out in
the right corners of campus and fil
ter out the dreadful clothing, you
will still have an almost insurmount
able obstacle in locating the beauti
ful grown-ups. They're in hiding.
As amazing as it sounds, rather
than show off their wares to the
world, PYTs in grad school tuck
themselves away and allow the
world to assume that we're a terribly
unattractive group.
When I say hidden, I don't meaji
that they are lurking behind trees
and around corners — rather
they've buried themselves under
piles of hard work.
I've heard it said that men find
smart women unattractive. The
truth is, however, that both sexes
are far from their best when im
mersed in the drudgery of achieve
ment. And, if nothing else, grad
school certainly brings out the worst
in people when it comes to that.
Well now you've had my two
cents (and 623 words) worth, I sup
pose I should construct some kind
of witty farewell. This is my last
column for The Daily, at least for
this volume, and I'd like to thank
all seven of my readers for their
dedication.
Anyway, that's all for now — I'm
off to try and improve my complex
ion by studiously doing nothing fora
couple of hours.
Nav is a little uncertain of the num
ber seven when it conies to his read
ers and would appreciate confirma
tion. Please e-mail navins@stan
ford.edu if you read this column so
that statistics can he compiled.
