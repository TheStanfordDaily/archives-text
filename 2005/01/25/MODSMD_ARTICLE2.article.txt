# Panel: Relief efforts face hurdles
## 
### JOE SEXTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Institute for Inter
national Studies assembled a panel
of experts last night to discuss the
aftermath of last month's devastat
ing South Asian tsunamis and the
future of the affected region.
The speakers highlighted the
scope of the international relief ef
fort and agreed that the focus of
the assistance should be on aiding
nations in regaining self-sufficien
cy.
They argued that affected coun
tries must take a proactive role in
the rebuilding process.
"The key for us is to start the re
construction efforts in ways that do
not undermine the well-being of
the population," said Lizanne
Mcßride, the director of the non
profit International Rescue Com
mittee and expert on Indonesian
humanitarian issues.
When it comes to rebuilding
countries ravaged by disaster, "the
tendency for countries like the
U.S. is to do it ourselves, and what
we need to do is help them do it
themselves," Mcßride said.
Eric Weiss, assistant professor
of surgery and international health
expert, agreed.
"One of the main things is to
help bring the local people back to
self-reliance," he said.
"In a lot of relief, we send peo
ple to help people who can't help
themselves, but there is little focus
of promoting self-sufficiency. I
think that is critical to addressing
these crises."
The panelists also addressed the
barriers impeding the relief effort,
like the political instability of the
region.
"Before the wave hit, one had
to question the administrative ca
pacity of the provincial govern
ment (in Indonesia|," said Interna
tional Relations Prof. Donald Em
merson.
"The governor [in one affected
area] isn't giving out aid and taking
charge because he is currently in
prison on corruption charges."

For years, the relationship be
tween the United States and In
donesia has been icy, some pan
elists noted, a fact that may have
long-term effects on a sustained
aid effort.
"For us, security, logistical ac
cess and political access are key;
without these we are crippled,"
Mcßride said. "The Indonesian
military are providing us with secu
rity, and rebel groups have re
mained quiet, but as the region sta
bilizes — and it will stabilize — we
will probably be increasingly de
nied access."
Religious differences may also
play a factor in the outcome of re
lief efforts, Emmerson added.
"There are in fact Christian aid
givers in Indonesia who say that
they are here to lead by example

and not to evangelize the popula
tion. but the predominately Mus
lim population seems to be skepti
cal," he said. "I think this may pose
a problem."
The panelists also argued that it
will be difficult to maintain a long
term relief effort as time passes.
"The task for us is to hold atten
tion to it," Mcßride said, "The
hardest thing to do is to keep at
tention to the crisis after the cam
eras go away."
Donald Kennedy, University
president emeritus and an environ
mental science and policy profes
sor, agreed.
"Our political attention span
about this sort of thing is notably
short," he said. "The door won't be
open for long."
This idea resonated with stu

dents in attendance as well.
"People seem to only want to do
things that will make a quick im
pact," said freshman Aaron Berg.
"There isn't a whole lot of popular
ity for groups or causes that pick a
difficult task and try to stay with it
until it is solved."
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner, deputy director of the
Stanford Institute for Internation
al Studies and moderator for the
event, argued that this country still
hasn't found an effective formula
for providing humanitarian relief.
"We don't know how to do
this,"he said. "It isn't all about im
proving our political attention
span. We just don't know how to
do this."

"The governor [in one affected
area] isn't giving out aid and taking
charge because he is currently in
prison on corruption charges."

For years, the relationship be
tween the United States and In
donesia has been icy, some pan
elists noted, a fact that may have
long-term effects on a sustained
aid effort.
"For us, security, logistical ac
cess and political access are key;
without these we are crippled,"
Mcßride said. "The Indonesian
military are providing us with secu
rity, and rebel groups have re
mained quiet, but as the region sta
bilizes — and it will stabilize — we
will probably be increasingly de
nied access."
Religious differences may also
play a factor in the outcome of re
lief efforts, Emmerson added.
"There are in fact Christian aid
givers in Indonesia who say that
they are here to lead by example

and not to evangelize the popula
tion. but the predominately Mus
lim population seems to be skepti
cal," he said. "I think this may pose
a problem."
The panelists also argued that it
will be difficult to maintain a long
term relief effort as time passes.
"The task for us is to hold atten
tion to it," Mcßride said, "The
hardest thing to do is to keep at
tention to the crisis after the cam
eras go away."
Donald Kennedy, University
president emeritus and an environ
mental science and policy profes
sor, agreed.
"Our political attention span
about this sort of thing is notably
short," he said. "The door won't be
open for long."
This idea resonated with stu

dents in attendance as well.
"People seem to only want to do
things that will make a quick im
pact," said freshman Aaron Berg.
"There isn't a whole lot of popular
ity for groups or causes that pick a
difficult task and try to stay with it
until it is solved."
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner, deputy director of the
Stanford Institute for Internation
al Studies and moderator for the
event, argued that this country still
hasn't found an effective formula
for providing humanitarian relief.
"We don't know how to do
this,"he said. "It isn't all about im
proving our political attention
span. We just don't know how to
do this."

A collection of experts gathered in Encino Hall last night to address the on-going humanitarian crisis in South Asia
following last month's tsunamis. International Relations Professor Don Emmerson (far right) argued that religious ten
sions could impede the relief process, with some Muslims in the region suspicious of Christian aid volunteers.
The Stanford Institute for Inter
national Studies assembled a panel
of experts last night to discuss the
aftermath of last month's devastat
ing South Asian tsunamis and the
future of the affected region.
The speakers highlighted the
scope of the international relief ef
fort and agreed that the focus of
the assistance should be on aiding
nations in regaining self-sufficien
cy.
They argued that affected coun
tries must take a proactive role in
the rebuilding process.
"The key for us is to start the re
construction efforts in ways that do
not undermine the well-being of
the population," said Lizanne
Mcßride, the director of the non
profit International Rescue Com
mittee and expert on Indonesian
humanitarian issues.
When it comes to rebuilding
countries ravaged by disaster, "the
tendency for countries like the
U.S. is to do it ourselves, and what
we need to do is help them do it
themselves," Mcßride said.
Eric Weiss, assistant professor
of surgery and international health
expert, agreed.
"One of the main things is to
help bring the local people back to
self-reliance," he said.
"In a lot of relief, we send peo
ple to help people who can't help
themselves, but there is little focus
of promoting self-sufficiency. I
think that is critical to addressing
these crises."
The panelists also addressed the
barriers impeding the relief effort,
like the political instability of the
region.
"Before the wave hit, one had
to question the administrative ca
pacity of the provincial govern
ment (in Indonesia|," said Interna
tional Relations Prof. Donald Em
merson.
"The governor [in one affected
area] isn't giving out aid and taking
charge because he is currently in
prison on corruption charges."

For years, the relationship be
tween the United States and In
donesia has been icy, some pan
