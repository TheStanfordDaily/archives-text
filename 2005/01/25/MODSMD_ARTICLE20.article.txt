## Soto Tape Chronicles Old school hoops from the rocking chair 
### 
I would like to dedicate this column to my
grandfather, the last great basketball
player in my family. Grandpa was a stal
wart on the Williamsburg YMCA team
that won the New York City championship in
1931.
When I was younger we used to play one-

on-one in our cracked drive
way court with the rusted
backboard and crooked rim.
It was always close, as my
sprightliness was a good
match for his experience.
Grandpa learned the
game before the invention of
the jump shot. Instead, he
would shoot by pushing the
ball from his chest two-hand
ed, with a touch of backspin

and his feet firmly planted on the ground.
When Grandpa played, shorts were short,
the hall was heavy, and showboating was un
heard of.
1 thought of Grandpa this weekend when I
went to see our No. 3 women's basketball team
defend its Pac-10 title against its two closest
challengers, LJCLA and USC.
From watching the games this weekend,
you would not have known that the Los Ange
les schools were in the same league as Stan
ford. The Cardinal came out energized, eager
to maintain their high national standing, and
ran their opponents clear out of town.
I have only recently become a fan of
women's basketball. Though 1 have been a
front-of-the-line Sixth Man Club fanatic for
four years, 1 attended only one women's bas
ketball game before this weekend, and my
only memory of it is the John Elway bobble
head doll I won at halftime.
It has often been said that women's basket
ball is much closer to James Naismith's origi
nal vision than today's men's game. Brute
strength and leaping ability take a back seat to
crisp passing, pure shooting and teamwork.
Naysayers claim that the women's game is
slow and boring, and that it's not fun to watch
if there is no promise of a backboard-shatter
ing, foundation-shaking dunk. 1 say to them:
you have not seen what this Cardinal team can
do.
This game is not slow. This game is not bor
ing. Take your throwback jerseys and retro
Converses back to Foot Locker, because this is
real Old School Basketball.
Back in the day, teams could shoot. The
Cardinal made 23 three-pointers over the
course of the two games, rarely hesitating to
take the long shot in transition and effortlessly
finding the open player on the perimeter out of
the half-court offense. Kelley Suminski and
Sebnem Kimyacioglu combined to shoot 61
percent from behind the arc, showcasing a skill
that has long been absent from the men's
game.
On the defensive end. Stanford played
hard-nosed basketball with an intensity rarely
seen elsewhere on the hardwood. They merci
lessly pressured opposing guards and forced
countless poor passes and turnovers. They ini
tiated full body contact with much larger post
players, challenged every shot at the basket,
and pressed full-court even when the clock was
waning in the second half.
Old School rules dictate that you must pro
tect your home court. Against the Bruins, with
five seconds left and 99 on the scoreboard,
Kristen Newlin went hard to the hole, drew the
foul, and hit the ensuing free throw to put Stan
ford at the century mark. How's that fora
