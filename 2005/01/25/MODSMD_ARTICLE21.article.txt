went into Friday's match coming off a disheartening 0-3 loss to
Long Beach State just two days earlier.
"The team's performance was much improved from
Wednesday night," head coach Don Shaw said. "We never let
UCSD get any momentum going."
The first game of the match was the most balanced of the
three, with Stanford's hitting percentage of .379 just barely
edging out the Tritons' .306. But the Cardinal won the game
30-26, and UCSD would not come that close to a win for the
rest of the match.
Stanford improved as the night went on, hitting .483 and

before sealing the match with a 30-24 victory in the
third.
With such a dominating presence on the court, one
might wonder what caused such a change. The Stan
ford lineup was the same as the one that fell to Long
Beach State 0-3 the previous Wednesday.
"We just played much better in all phases," Shaw
said. "Our block was the best it's been so far this season."
Indeed, the Cardinal recorded a season high of 20
blocks. But even with such strong defense, according
to Shaw, serving was also essential to the outcome of
the match.
With 41 assists, senior Kevin Hansen helped the
Cardinal take advantage of every scoring opportunity.

Solid play uplifting
after Long Beach loss

Freshman Matt Ceran, who has seen more playing
time since sophomore Josh Schwarzapel and juniors
Nick Manov and Ben Reddy suffered injuries, led the
team with 11 kills.
"1 can't think of anything we did poorly," Shaw
said. "We were solid from start to finish."
It was a timely victory for the Cardinal, having suf
fered such a brutal loss to Long Beach State just two
days earlier.
"It's always good to improve on a poor perfor
mance with the result being a win on the road," Shaw
said.
The team's next game is this Thursday at Burnham
Pavilion, where Stanford will take on No. 6 Cal State
Northridge.
