# Wrestlers falter without Gentry, struggle on the road

### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A short-handed Stanford wrestling
team (4-4, 0-2 Pacific-10 Conference) al
most took down a giant.
The Cardinal was without senior co
captain 157-pound Matt Gentry, who was
unable to compete due to illness. And the
team still came tantalizingly close to heat
ing the undefeated No. 3 lowa State (14-0)
only to fall one step short of the monu
mental upset.
The meet was decided in the last weight
class, where Stanford heavyweight junior
Shawn Ritzenthaler fell to Scott Coleman
in an 8-2 decision, sealing the 23-18 victory
for the Cyclones.
"It was a long trip to lowa but it was a
huge confidence boost because we took
the number three team in the country
down to the last minute of the last match."
Gentry said.

The Cardinal also faced Lock Haven
University of Pennsylvania (3-2) where
they were led by 174-pound junior co-cap
tain I mad Kharbush to a 22-15 victory.
Once again, the contest came down to the
final match, in which Ritzenthaler won a
13-5 major decision over the Bald Eagles'
Tim Meyers to take the dual meet.
After the two dual meets in lowa on Fri
day, Stanford flew back to California to
face No. 23 Cal State Bakersfield on Sun
day. After such an emotionally charged
dual, the long travel time and a short
turnaround, the Roadrunners took down
the Cardinal, 29-12.
"Two away competitions in one week
end must have really worn us out," Gentry
said. "We had one of our best perfor
mances on Friday and one of our worst on
Sunday. 1 don't know if we weren't fresh
but we didn't wrestle up to our ability."
Lock Haven and Stanford were even
through the first four weight classes as

both teams scored two decisions and had
six team points. Stanford was forced to
forfeit at 157-pounds because of Gen
try's illness, which was not expected last
week when head coach Steve Buddie
thought his starting 10 would be ready
for the weekend. The NCAA champion
is a lock for points, having won 57
straight matches.
The Cardinal got exceptional efforts
from 165-pound freshman Scott Loescher,
who recorded a tight 5-4 decision over B.J.
Mikeska. Kharbush pinned Carlos Ponce
and 184-pound junior Ryan Hagen earned
a 10-3 victory over Justin Johnson.
The marquee event of the weekend was
the dual with lowa State. Stanford started
off the meet with a win from 125-pound se
nior Nathan Peterson in a 3-0 decision over
Ben Hanisch. lowa State then rolled off a
pin and a major decision. Freshman Josh
Zupancic, at 141 pounds, won a 5-4 deci
sion for the Cardinal.

Gentry also had to forfeit the predicted
premiere rematch of the meet against lowa
State's Trent Paulson.
Stanford found itself in a significant 16-
6 hole, and the meet looked like a blowout.
"It's horrible having to give up six
points where you know you would normal
ly score between three and six points every
time you compete," said head coach Steve
Buddie. "With that said, the team did not
let the 'handicap' distract them at all. They
all went out and tried to make up for those
lost points. With that said, it's a possibility
that we win the lowa State dual with Matt
there."
Once again, Loescher, Kharbush and
Hagen led their team back into contention.
Loescher and Hagen came up with deci
sions while Kharbush pinned David
Bertolino in two minutes and 11 seconds.
However, lowa State would not be kept
down as their two upper weight-classes recorded a
major and minor decision to preserve the Cyclones'
perfect record.
Stanford's trip to Bakersfield did not have the same
suspense. The Roadrunners charged out to a 17-3 lead
by winning six of the first seven weight-classes via one
pin and four major decisions. This lead was insur
mountable, but Stanford did not stop fighting. Khar
bush closed the meet with a 17-0 technical fall to com
plete his perfect 3-0 weekend.
Gentry made his return to the mat with a 16-4 major
decision over Brian Busby to record his 58th consecu
tive victory.

Card post 'horrible
showing' in Bakersfield

Given the extremes of the weekend, Stanford and
their upcoming opponents are still trying to figure out
the impact and importance of such a strange road trip.
"I can't tell yet if the weekend was a success or not."
Buddie said. "I'll tell you after the Pac-10 Champi
onships. This weekend will be considered a success if
we take the small victory in lowa and the horrible
showing in Bakersfield and learn from both."
Stanford has one more weekend on the road, as it
travels through Oregon to compete against Oregon,
Oregon State and Portland State. After this, the Car
dinal finally return to their home gym on Feb. 4 to face
Fresno State.
