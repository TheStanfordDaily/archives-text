# Gymnastics drops meet, rank to Huskies
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In its first meet of the season this past
Friday, the women's gymnastics team fell
to No. 22 University of Washington.
192.825 to 192.425. Due to the relatively
low score, the Cardinal fell from its pre
season No. 3 rank to a No. 30 rank.
Although seemingly a huge upset, the
slow start comes as no surprise to this
small, young team.
"For the first meet of the year, they did
a tremendous job," said Smyth of the five
freshmen, one sophomore, and two semi
injured juniors who sported the Cardinal
leotard Friday night.
"It's a slow start: we didn't do our highest
difficulty skills or put in our best competitors
... I'm committed to getting this team to the
end of season and doing something great.
It's just going to be slow starting."
Although Friday night's score is over
three points lower than last year's lowest
score of 195.5. some of that difference is due
to changes in judging standards, said Smyth.
In past years, judges would deduct a quarter
of a tenth for minor infractions like wobbles
on beam, incomplete casts on bars, or steps
on landings, but this year judges are taking
a full tenth deduction for those mistakes.
Freshman Elizabeth Tricase, who
placed 10th in Olympic trials this past sum
mer, led the Cardinal in the All-Around.
capturing first place with a 39.05. A 2002
national champion on vault. Tricase com
peted a Yurchenko vault with a full twist to
earn a 9.85 and first place on the event. Tri
case was also the meet's top scorer on the
uneven bars with a 9.825.
Fellow freshman Lauren Elmore was
the only other Cardinal to compete in the
All-Around, since junior captain Natalie
Foley sat out balance beam due to an ankle
injury. Elmore faced the difficult task of
being the first gymnast to compete on
three of the four events (scores usually
climb as more gymnasts compete), but still
earned third place in the All-Around with
a 38.35.
"I want to commend Liz and Lauren:
They were freshmen phenoms in the first
college meet of their career," said Smyth.
"Liz really stood out and led this team, and
Lauren was the highlight on beam."
Elmore started the Cardinal on balance
beam by hitting her routine to score a 9.70.
For the first time in at least two years, how
ever. the Cardinal did not improve on that
initial score. Elmore was the team's high
scorer on beam, finishing fourth overall
behind the Huskies.

Beam has traditionally been Stanford's
best event: for the past two years, the Car
dinal has been the No. 1 team in the coun
try during the regular season. But after
graduating Lindsay Wing, the four-time
Pacific-10 champion on beam, as well as
four other seniors, Stanford is not as solid
as it once was.
Although none of Stanford's gymnasts
fell off the beam on Friday, they certainly
struggled to stay on the four-inch-wide ap
paratus. Beam was the Cardinal's lowest
scoring event with a total score of 47.65, al
most an entire point below the team's low
est score last year of 48.5.
"The girls stayed on, which was good,
but some nerves got in the way," said
Smyth. "They had to fight like crazy to stay
on, and there were a lot of wobbles."
Improving the team's performance on
balance beam is Smyth's priority in prac
tice this week. She is confident that the
beam score will improve in about three or
four weeks when top performers Foley and
freshman Tabitha Yim are healthy enough
to enter the line-up. But for now, the
healthy gymnasts will focus on performing
their routines under pressure, fixing small
details, and sticking the landings on their
dismounts.
What the team has lost on beam, how
ever. it may gain on the floor exercise.
Floor was by far Stanford's best event,
with a total of 48.70 over Washington's
47.825.
"Floor was just about the most fantastic
performance I've seen yet from a Stanford
team." said Smyth who is entering her
fourth year on the Farm. "These freshmen
like to perform. Alex Pintchouk started us
off with a great smile and a beautiful floor
performance ... and Liz Tricase just sells
her routine to the crowd."
Despite her ankle injury, Foley also
competed well on floor exercise, perform
ing a new routine and tying Tricase for sec
ond place with a 9.80. Like the other gym
nasts, however, she left room for improve
ment by not performing her most difficult
tumbling passes. Smyth will have her gym
nasts add difficulty to their routines as the
season progresses, but for now she just
wants to keep them healthy.
The slow start should not affect the Car
dinal's chance for success in the long run.
Unlike the ranking systems of other sports,
which count wins and losses, the regular
season gymnastics ranking system is solely
dependent on average scores.
At the end of the regular season, teams
advance on the basis of a regional qualify
ing score (RQS). The RQS is an average of

the team's top three home scores and top
three away scores after dropping the high
est score. With four home meets, including
this Friday's meet against Oregon State,
and five away meets ahead on the sched
ule, the Cardinal will have plenty of op

portunities to improve on last Friday's
score.
In the meantime, however, Stanford
sits at No. 30 â€” a ranking that is not likely
indicative of its potential come time for
NCAA nationals in April.
