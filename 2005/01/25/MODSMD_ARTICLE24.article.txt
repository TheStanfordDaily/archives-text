### SAMUEL CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Strength and consistency have been essential for
the No. 1 Stanford men's swimming and diving team
(5-0,2-0 Pacific-10) this season. In this past weekend's
trip down south to Arizona fora pair of dual meets, the
Cardinal men displayed both characteristics, blowing
out both Arizona State (2-4,0-3 Pac-10) and No. 5 Ari
zona (4-3,1-2 Pac-10).
"Many skeptics did not expect us to swim so fast this
weekend," senior Gary Marshall said. "Our perfor
mance solidified our number one ranking and boosted
our confidence."
In Stanford's 130-103 win over the Sun Devils in
Tempe, the Card had their first Pac-10 dual meet
matchup and won at will, touching the wall first in all
11 swimming events of the afternoon. As has often
been the case this season. Stanford started off the com
petition in dominant fashion, taking the top three
times in the 200-yard medley relay.
All three Cardinal groups finished more than a
second before the anchor of the first ASU four-man
squad hit the wall. Sophomore Hongzhe Sun. fresh
men Kyle Boehringer and Peter Carothers and
sophomore Ben Wildman-Tobriner formed the win
ning quartet, turning in a combined time of one
minute and 28.42 seconds.
The strength of the group, which was entirely com

posed of underclassmen. displayed the comfort level of
tjie young athletes in unfamiliar pools.
"Going on road trips is an integral and exciting part
about college swimming," said Sun. "I think the fresh
men can gain a lot of experience by adjusting and
learning to race teams away from home where differ
ent variables like pool and weather may affect the way
races are swum."
The Cardinal only increased their control over the
lead after that point, taking at least the top two spots in
nine of the remaining ten events. It was only in the 200-
yard breaststroke that two ASU swimmers finished in
the top three, only bested by a strong first-place swim
by Marshall.
In all nine individual-event wins by the Cardinal,
only senior co-captain Jayme Cramer repeated first
place finishes, edging all opponents in the 200-yard
backstroke and 200-yard freestyle events.
Wildman-Tobriner, Sun. freshman Noa Sakamoto,
sophomore Matt Crowe, junior Tobias Oriwol and ju
nior Michael McLean also emerged victorious in indi
vidual events on Friday.
Stanford went into the meet thinking that Arizona
State would provide a solid warm-up to a highly antic
ipated powerhouse rumble between the first-place
Cardinal and the fifth-place Wildcats. But the Cardinal
were surprised how easy the win came.
Despite the fact that the men
and women alternated in their
events, the Stanford men had no
problem finding their groove, win
ning all hut two events on the after
noon and cruising to a 155-82 win
over Arizona.
Again, the Card started off
strong, taking the first and third
finishes in the opening 400-yard
medley relay. This time, it was the
combination of Sun. senior co-cap
tain Matt McDonald, junior Ricky
Eddy and sophomore Kyle Ran
som who led the field, finishing
nearly live seconds ahead of the
second-place Arizona "A" team at
3:15.96.
In the event that Sakamoto won
on the previous day — in the 1000-
yard freestyle — Shaun Phillips

took the top position, finishing
more than live seconds ahead of his
nearest competitor, Tyler Deßerry
of Arizona. Sun, Cramer. McLean.
Marshall and sophomore Andy
Grant also took top honors in indi
vidual events on the day.
The only disappointment came
when the famed Arizona sprinting
contingent took to the blocks, win
ning the 50-yard and 100-yard
freestyle events.
In both events. South African
native junior Lyndon Ferns fin
ished first, edging the Cardinal's
Wildman-Tobriner in the 50-yard
event and Grant in the 100-yard
event. These were the only two de
feats on the two-day, two-meet
trip.
On the final event of the day,

Stanford defeated only
twice in two meets

the 400-yard freestyle relay, the
Stanford "A" team, composed of
Wildman-Tobriner, Cramer. Ran
som and Grant took the top time of
2:58.54, capping the rout with the
only sub-three minute time.
Marshall was surprised by the
relative lack of competition.
"We expected Arizona to be
our toughest challenge of the
weekend, but they rolled over at
our feet." he said. "While it was a
little disappointing to go all that
way for such a level of competition,
it is never disappointing to unleash
total domination."
Stanford will take on USC on
Feb. 5 at the Avery Aquatic Center
before finishing the regular season
at California on Feb. l l ).
