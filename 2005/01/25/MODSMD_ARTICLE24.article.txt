Strength and consistency have been essential for
the No. 1 Stanford men's swimming and diving team
(5-0,2-0 Pacific-10) this season. In this past weekend's
trip down south to Arizona fora pair of dual meets, the
Cardinal men displayed both characteristics, blowing
out both Arizona State (2-4,0-3 Pac-10) and No. 5 Ari
zona (4-3,1-2 Pac-10).
"Many skeptics did not expect us to swim so fast this
weekend," senior Gary Marshall said. "Our perfor
mance solidified our number one ranking and boosted
our confidence."
In Stanford's 130-103 win over the Sun Devils in
Tempe, the Card had their first Pac-10 dual meet
matchup and won at will, touching the wall first in all
11 swimming events of the afternoon. As has often
been the case this season. Stanford started off the com
petition in dominant fashion, taking the top three
times in the 200-yard medley relay.
All three Cardinal groups finished more than a
second before the anchor of the first ASU four-man
squad hit the wall. Sophomore Hongzhe Sun. fresh
men Kyle Boehringer and Peter Carothers and
sophomore Ben Wildman-Tobriner formed the win
ning quartet, turning in a combined time of one
minute and 28.42 seconds.
The strength of the group, which was entirely com

posed of underclassmen. displayed the comfort level of
tjie young athletes in unfamiliar pools.
"Going on road trips is an integral and exciting part
about college swimming," said Sun. "I think the fresh
men can gain a lot of experience by adjusting and
learning to race teams away from home where differ
ent variables like pool and weather may affect the way
races are swum."
The Cardinal only increased their control over the
lead after that point, taking at least the top two spots in
nine of the remaining ten events. It was only in the 200-
yard breaststroke that two ASU swimmers finished in
the top three, only bested by a strong first-place swim
by Marshall.
In all nine individual-event wins by the Cardinal,
only senior co-captain Jayme Cramer repeated first
place finishes, edging all opponents in the 200-yard
backstroke and 200-yard freestyle events.
Wildman-Tobriner, Sun. freshman Noa Sakamoto,
sophomore Matt Crowe, junior Tobias Oriwol and ju
nior Michael McLean also emerged victorious in indi
vidual events on Friday.
Stanford went into the meet thinking that Arizona
State would provide a solid warm-up to a highly antic
ipated powerhouse rumble between the first-place
Cardinal and the fifth-place Wildcats. But the Cardinal
were surprised how easy the win came.
