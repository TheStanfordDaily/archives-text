The atmosphere in Burnham Pavilion was electric:
1,2(K) fans filled the gym to watch as the all-stars of men's
gymnastics marched in to compete at the Cardinal
Open. Hundreds of Cardinal fanscheered as the men en
tered to take on their first opponent of the home sched
ule.
But after a Herculean performance on Saturday
night, the men's gymnastics team fell to California hy
less than two points after beating the Bears just last
weekend. Berkeley stole a win in the final round to
earn a score of 215.625, while the Cardinal finished the
meet with a score of 213.525.
The competition at the Cardinal ()pen was stiff, as the
Cardinal faced Berkeley, Air Force, Washington, and
Elite gymnasts, a club team featuring high-schoolers
from around the country.
The Cardinal's first test of the evening came on
pommel horse. Each man performed routines far
above the standard required for NCAA competition,
but the Cardinal seemed to struggle, suffering multi
ple execution deductions, as well as deductions for
falling of the apparatus.
Freshman Chris Harper performed one of the most
difficult pommel horse routines in the world. Although
he was disappointed hy his score, he was resolute in what
the team needed to do in future practices to improve.
"We've got to put pressure on ourselves and practice
like it's a meet," he said.
The gymnasts composed themselves on the rings
and maintained their collective status as the top rings
team in the NCAA. Freshman David Sender had an
astounding performance, earning a score of 9.75.
Sophomore Alex Schorsch was also able to redeem

himself after a disappointing pommel horse routine,
earning a score of
Stanford head coach Tom Glielmi expects the team
to go up at least another half point on the rings when se
nior Daniel Torres-Rangel returns. Torres-Rangel is out
of commission with an injury.
The Cardinal moved to the vault, where they again
struggled. After the event, Glielmi spoke with the team,
and they revved up their competitive spirit to earn high
scores on the parallel bars.
Stanford led the competition by two points going into
the high bar, but lost crucial points to several falls. The
first two competitors hit their routine, but the next four
failed to execute.
Sender solidified his position as the team's "go-to"
man this weekend. He astounded the crowd on his floor
routine with a double-twisting, double-layout. He fol
lowed that with a perfectly executed iron cross and mal
tese on the rings. I le brought home first place in the all
aroundwith a score of 53.75 and tied for first on the rings
and the vault, earning a 1 >.75 and a 9.45, respectively.
Sender also placed third on the floor exercise with a 9.30.
Glielmi acknowledged that the loss was understand
able given the youth of the team. The Cardinal could
have watered down their routines, but Glielmi wanted
the men to perform at a higher difficulty level in order to
prepare for the NCAAs. where they will need an overall
higher point score.
"We showed signs of a young team. It was our first
time at home, and I anticipate that we will do better at
the next home meet because we know what we need to
do," Glielmi said.
The Cardinal will have another shot at Cal at home
on March 6. In the meantime. Stanford will compete in
Las Vegas at the Winter Cup on Feb. 4 and 5.
