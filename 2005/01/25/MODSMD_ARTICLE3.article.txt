# Persuasion goes high-tech

Can computers and machines
persuade people to think or act a
certain way?
They already do. They convince
teens that caring for an infant is
hard work. Thev motivate smokers
to quit smoking. And they per
suade online hook customers to
buy more books.
"Machines are being created to
manipulate your thoughts and be
haviors." said Computer Science
Prof. B. J. Fogg.
Fogg pioneered the field of cap
tology — that is. the study of com
puters as persuasive technologies.
He now directs the Stanford Per
suasive Technology Lab. which

studies how technology can be used
and designed to change what peo
ple believe and do.
The Stanford Persuasive Tech
nology Lab is currently housed at
the Center for the Study of Lan
guage and Information. It began in
IWB and grew out of a class on
human-computer interaction that
Fogg taught.
"(At the time] people were not
thinking about technology and its
persuasive potential." said Daniel
Berdichevsky. Class of 2(X)2. who
was an associate lab manager when
the lab began.
Berdichevsky described re
search in the early nineties by
Communication Prof. Clifford
Nass. His research showed that

people interacted with computers
as it they were human. Fogg's re
search took the next step.
"Once you accept that comput
ers can be social actors, one of the
next logical questions is to ask
yourself if computers can be per
suasive social actors. And B. J. had
found that they could be," he said.
The Stanford Persuasive Tech
nology Lab is currently working on
a number of projects. One of the
latest is a mobile phone application
called Buddyßuzz. It allows users
to read articles on their cell phone
screens at a rate of 300 to 80() words
per minute.

While other mobile programs force users
to scroll through minute text, Buddvßuzz
employs rapid serial visual presentation, a
mode of reading suited for small screen
interfaces where words are displayed one
at a time. Each word flashes by after a frac
tion of a second at a speed that the user
controls.
Buddyßuzz has currently partnered
with Reuters and Utne Magazine, deliver
ing more than 700 articles to users daily.
However, Buddyßuzz is not just anoth
er way to read articles on a cell phone.
Buddyßuzz also enables users to form
social networks and to receive reading rec
ommendations from other users based on
one's individual profile.
Fogg compared the system to a book
club.
"You get recommendations from
friends and people like you." he said.
"Stuff gets pushed to you. It's a sense of
community reading. It makes reading
better."
Once enough people have registered
with Buddyßuzz, Fogg intends to conduct
research on persuasion strategies.
"What I'm excited about is getting a
bunch of people using it and finding out
how people are persuaded by mobile
devices," he said.
Fogg suggested that his team would be

researchers said they hope to build a network of Buddyßuzz users who can
recommend titles to each other.

entering the research phase in about two months.
According to senior Greg Cuellar. who along with
junior Dean Eckles helped program the first version

of Buddyßuzz, the lab's research will focus on how
aspects of the program can be changed to affect the
reading habits of its users.
"For example, we could modify the application so

that half of the users receive flattery as
part of the user experience," Cuellar said
in an email exchange. "Buddyßuzz could
occasionally tell them, 'You look great
today,' or 'You're very smart.' We could
then compare the usage patterns of the
group with the flattery to the group with
out the flattery."
"If the group with the extra flattery
reads significantly more, then we've
found a way to persuade people to read
more using Buddyßuzz, which may
extrapolate to technology usage in gen
eral," he added.
The beta version of Buddyßuzz has
been available to the public since early
November. The application is compatible
with most Nokia and Samsung mobile
phones that can access the Internet. It is
currently free of charge and available for
download after registering on the
Buddyßuzz Web site.
Buddyßuzz is mainly targeted
towards people on-the-go, who might not
have the time to sit down with a book,
newspaper or magazine, but Eckles
believes that students could also benefit
from the program.
He added: "I think that reading
blogs and having content recommended
by our algorithms based on the reading of

their peers and others with similar tastes are the high
lights for students."
