Can computers and machines
persuade people to think or act a
certain way?
They already do. They convince
teens that caring for an infant is
hard work. Thev motivate smokers
to quit smoking. And they per
suade online hook customers to
buy more books.
"Machines are being created to
manipulate your thoughts and be
haviors." said Computer Science
Prof. B. J. Fogg.
Fogg pioneered the field of cap
tology — that is. the study of com
puters as persuasive technologies.
He now directs the Stanford Per
suasive Technology Lab. which

studies how technology can be used
and designed to change what peo
ple believe and do.
The Stanford Persuasive Tech
nology Lab is currently housed at
the Center for the Study of Lan
guage and Information. It began in
IWB and grew out of a class on
human-computer interaction that
Fogg taught.
"(At the time] people were not
thinking about technology and its
persuasive potential." said Daniel
Berdichevsky. Class of 2(X)2. who
was an associate lab manager when
the lab began.
Berdichevsky described re
search in the early nineties by
Communication Prof. Clifford
Nass. His research showed that

people interacted with computers
as it they were human. Fogg's re
search took the next step.
"Once you accept that comput
ers can be social actors, one of the
next logical questions is to ask
yourself if computers can be per
suasive social actors. And B. J. had
found that they could be," he said.
The Stanford Persuasive Tech
nology Lab is currently working on
a number of projects. One of the
latest is a mobile phone application
called Buddyßuzz. It allows users
to read articles on their cell phone
screens at a rate of 300 to 80() words
per minute.
