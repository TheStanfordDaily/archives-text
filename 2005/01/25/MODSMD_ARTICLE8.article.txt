On Jan. 25, 19ffl, The Daily wrote a
story about the U.S. Olympic Commit
tee rev /'en >s ofthe Bay A reafaL Hi ties for
the 1996 Olympics hid. Below is- an ex
cerpt:
Stanford University, along with
several Bay Area sports facilities, re
ceived rave reviews this weekend from
U.S. Olympic Committee members
assessing the area's hid to host the
19% Summer Games.
"The Bay Area came out superla
tively" in the site selection commit
tee's two-day tour of various sports fa
cilities located from San Francisco to
San Jose, said state Sen. Quentin
Kopp, who chairs the Bay Area Sports
Organizing Committee, the organiza
tion spearheading the Bay Area hid.
The Bay Area, including Stanford,
is one of four sites being considered for
the United States' entry bid to host the
1996 games. The Bay Area was the first
of the four sites that the committee will
visit. Kopp said. The other U.S. cities
being considered are Atlanta.
Nashville and Minneapolis-St. Paul.
According to Kopp. the reaction of
the nine-member delegation "was
quite enthusiastic" after spending Fri
day and Saturday visiting athletic sites,
including Stanford Stadium.
If the Bay Area is chosen as the site
of the games, Stanford would host the
opening and closing ceremonies, the
track and field events, and the swim
ming competition. Stanford would
also house between 7,000 and B,(KK)
athletes.
Because 1996 will be the 100 th an
niversary of the modern Olympics,
Athens, which hosted the games in
18%. will probably be chosen as the
site of the '% games. But if the Bay
Area is selected by the United States
Olympic Committee as the U.S. entry
for the 1996 games, its chances of being
the U.S. entry in future Olympic years
would be strengthened, Kopp said.

On Jan. 25, 1974. The Daily ran a
story about a program on KZSU that
allowed students, faculty and commu
nity members to talk on the air. Below
is an excerpt:
'"Opinion 74' a new free speech
program on campus radio station
KZSU, will provide students, faculty
and area residents with free air time to
voice their opinions on issues of their
choosing.
"Junior Kathy Cunningham, pro
ducer of the program, said the idea for
the broadcasts stemmed from efforts
by the Committee for Open Media
(COM). The group, which included
several Stanford students, last year
asked Bay Area television and radio
stations to allow free speech air time
for listeners to voice their views during
prime time.
"Some stations complied with the
COM free speech proposal. But Cun
ningham pointed out that 'there are
very few radio stations with programs
such as this, and we feel that KZSU is
a prime place that will fill the need for
public access to the media in the area.'
"Cunningham, a communication
student, has read numerous articles
supporting the case for free speech
programming. Under the slogan 'Peo
ple Time In Broadcasting,' she noted,
there is growing interest in public use
of the time provided to voice personal
opinions on local, state and federal is
sues.
"Cunningham said 'Opinion 74'
will welcome any responsible opinions
from students, faculty and citizens out
side the University. But she warned
that 'there are FCC [Federal Commu
nications Commission' rulings against
the use of criminal obscenity, libelous
statements or incitements to violence.
"'We will solicit both sides of the is
sues, although we are not required to,'
she said."

story about a program on KZSU that
allowed students, faculty and commu
nity members to talk on the air. Below
is an excerpt:
'"Opinion 74' a new free speech
program on campus radio station
KZSU, will provide students, faculty
and area residents with free air time to
voice their opinions on issues of their
choosing.
"Junior Kathy Cunningham, pro
ducer of the program, said the idea for
the broadcasts stemmed from efforts
by the Committee for Open Media
(COM). The group, which included
several Stanford students, last year
asked Bay Area television and radio
stations to allow free speech air time
for listeners to voice their views during
prime time.
"Some stations complied with the
COM free speech proposal. But Cun
ningham pointed out that 'there are
very few radio stations with programs
such as this, and we feel that KZSU is
a prime place that will fill the need for
public access to the media in the area.'
"Cunningham, a communication
student, has read numerous articles
supporting the case for free speech
programming. Under the slogan 'Peo
ple Time In Broadcasting,' she noted,
there is growing interest in public use
of the time provided to voice personal
opinions on local, state and federal is
sues.
"Cunningham said 'Opinion 74'
will welcome any responsible opinions
from students, faculty and citizens out
side the University. But she warned
that 'there are FCC [Federal Commu
nications Commission' rulings against
the use of criminal obscenity, libelous
statements or incitements to violence.
"'We will solicit both sides of the is
sues, although we are not required to,'
she said."
