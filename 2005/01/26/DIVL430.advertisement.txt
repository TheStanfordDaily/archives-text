If you're at Stanford, we know you're smart. And a smart thing to do is to wear
a helmet when you're riding a bike. We know you're on a tight budget, so we're
appealing to your head — and your wallet.
Now you can buy a high quality Giro or
Bell helmet for only $15 at the Campus
Bike Shop (normal retail: $35)1
For details, check the websites below. | J |
And always wear a helmet when biking!
