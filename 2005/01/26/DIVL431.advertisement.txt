Want 10,000 people to read what YOU write? If so, there are two ways to join
The Daily. Apply to be on the editorial board or to be a columnist.
APPLY TO BE ON THE DAILY'S EDITORIAL BOARD!
Applications are due on Friday, January 28 @ 5 p.m.
Do you care about Stanford? Do you enjoy learning about campus issues? Do you want to make an impact on the campus communi
ty? If so, then you belong on The Daily's editorial board.
The Daily's editorial board includes six non-Daily individuals who work with four Daily editors and writers to decide the topics and
stances of the paper's editorials. Editorial board members must attend one weekly editorial meeting, write one editorial a week and
submit ideas for editorials. If interested, please e-mail Anthony Ha (acha@stanford.edu) with five editorial ideas, a 300-word sample
editorial on a topic of your choice and a short paragraph describing your interests and reasons for wanting to join the board by Jan. 28
at 5 p.m.
BE A DAILY COLUMNIST.
Applications are due on Monday, January 31 at 5 p.m.
Submit a packet with your contact information, two sample columns (500-600 words each), a list of 10 column ideas and a proposed
theme for your column to The Daily either by e-mail at acha@stanford.edu or in a sealed envelope to The Daily's offices at the Storke
Publications Building.
Applications will be reviewed in an anonymous fashion, so do not mention your name in your sample columns or ideas. All applicants
will be considered to either be features or opinions columnists. Feel free to indicate a preference fora type of column if you have one.
Features columnists generally write social commentary pieces that deal with issues such as fashion and style, mating and dating, food
and entertainment, travel and beer pong. Opinions columnists generally tackle issues regarding campus, local, state or national news
and affairs, although their pieces should still be written in an engaging manner and can be lighthearted in tone. Unlike this paragraph.
