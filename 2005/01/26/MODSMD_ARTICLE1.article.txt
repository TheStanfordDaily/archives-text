# Sink the red cups to win $10,000 in NYC

### SHIRIN SHARIF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Thefacebook.com creator Mark Zucker
herg is hoping that his drunken idea will he a
brilliant success when he launches a national
Beirut tournament today on the ever-so-popu
lar Weh site.
Students from 128 schools that are sub
scribed to Thefacebook.com have been invit
ed to participate in a national Beirut tourna
ment. Winners from each school will get $500
to fly to New York City during President's
Day weekend to vie fora whopping $10,000
grand prize.
There is a $10 entry fee per team, which
should cover the school's prize money and
costs of the national tournament. Unless there
is unexpectedly high interest,
Thefacebook.com team is expecting to lose
$10,000 on the event.
Why would they be organizing an event to
lose money, especially when they have a pend
ing lawsuit with rival Web site
www.connect I J.com?
"Because it's cool." said Zuckerberg. who is
currently on leave from Harvard University
and residing in Menlo Park.
Students do not have to be 21 to enter the
tournament at their individual schools (they
are advised to use 2 percent milk instead of
beer), but they must be 21 to compete in the na
tional tournament. Off-duty police officers will

be checking identification in New York.
Brackets will be randomly created online
for the Stanford tournament, which will feature
teams facing off in best-of-three, single-elimi
nation games. In New York, the three-day na
tional tournament will consist of a round-robin
to determine seeding, followed by a two-day,
single-elimination tournament.
Beirut, a game played by throwing ping
pong balls into cups of beer (or milk), is a grow
ing pastime at Stanford. This quarter, senior
Nick Damiano organized an unofficial Intra
mural Beirut league that will last through Dead
Week. Students are competing for "Beirut
Champions" T-shirts, as well as a makeshift
trophy made from cardboard, cups, balls and
spray paint.
"The 1M Beirut league is something much
bigger, and the title will carry much more pres
tige on campus (than Thefacebook tournament
winner]," Damiano said. "I definitely approve
of Zuckerberg's efforts to use
Thefacebook.com to arrange the first ever na
tionwide Beirut tournament.
"I just hope the game will be able to keep its
purity and the day doesn't come when Beirut
players get Nike sponsorship and stores start
selling Beirut trading cards to little kids. That
might not be a good message to send to the
youth of America," Damiano added.
Students can easily participate in both the
Stanford IM League and the national tourna
ment sponsored by Thefacebook.com because

both offer scheduling flexibility, although the
latter is going to be run on a shorter two-week
timetable. Both organizers like the social inter
action that comes from the matches.
" I think the social scene really needed some
thing like [the IM league] to happen in the
midst of increasingly strict University regula
tions on students having fun," Damiano said.
Zuckerberg said that while
Thefacebook.com could be used as a tool for
organizing national social events, this is not a
major part of what it does. The staff is current
ly looking at developing a college dining and
entertainment directory, in which students can
"make friends" with local bars and restaurants.
There are no plans to enter the textbook resale
market, as Thefacebook staff "doesn't like
those sites."
Thefacebook.com reached the 1.5 million
users mark on Tuesday, including 9,730 Stan
ford users. The Web site, and its creators, have
been featured in many national media outlets,
including Time magazine.
The site is also bringing in repeat "cus
tomers," with 55 million hits per day across all
schools and 208,000 hits per day at Stanford.
Sixty-five percent of users come back to the site
everyday.
Students interested in entering theface

The site is also looking to hire interns and engi
neers in the near future.

Nick Damiano organized an unofficial Intra
mural Beirut league that will last through Dead
Week. Students are competing for "Beirut
Champions" T-shirts, as well as a makeshift
trophy made from cardboard, cups, balls and
spray paint.
"The 1M Beirut league is something much
bigger, and the title will carry much more pres
tige on campus (than Thefacebook tournament
winner]," Damiano said. "I definitely approve
of Zuckerberg's efforts to use
Thefacebook.com to arrange the first ever na
tionwide Beirut tournament.
"I just hope the game will be able to keep its
purity and the day doesn't come when Beirut
players get Nike sponsorship and stores start
selling Beirut trading cards to little kids. That
might not be a good message to send to the
youth of America," Damiano added.
Students can easily participate in both the
Stanford IM League and the national tourna
ment sponsored by Thefacebook.com because

both offer scheduling flexibility, although the
latter is going to be run on a shorter two-week
timetable. Both organizers like the social inter
action that comes from the matches.
" I think the social scene really needed some
thing like [the IM league] to happen in the
midst of increasingly strict University regula
tions on students having fun," Damiano said.
Zuckerberg said that while
Thefacebook.com could be used as a tool for
organizing national social events, this is not a
major part of what it does. The staff is current
ly looking at developing a college dining and
entertainment directory, in which students can
"make friends" with local bars and restaurants.
There are no plans to enter the textbook resale
market, as Thefacebook staff "doesn't like
those sites."
Thefacebook.com reached the 1.5 million
users mark on Tuesday, including 9,730 Stan

been featured in many national media outlets,

The site is also bringing in repeat "cus

Students line up the red cups to prepare fora qame of Beirut. Thefacebook com is launching a national Beirut tournament for its 1 28 subscriber schools.
Thefacebook.com creator Mark Zucker
herg is hoping that his drunken idea will he a
brilliant success when he launches a national
Beirut tournament today on the ever-so-popu
lar Weh site.
Students from 128 schools that are sub
scribed to Thefacebook.com have been invit
ed to participate in a national Beirut tourna
ment. Winners from each school will get $500
to fly to New York City during President's
Day weekend to vie fora whopping $10,000
grand prize.
There is a $10 entry fee per team, which
should cover the school's prize money and
costs of the national tournament. Unless there
is unexpectedly high interest,
Thefacebook.com team is expecting to lose
$10,000 on the event.
Why would they be organizing an event to
lose money, especially when they have a pend
ing lawsuit with rival Web site
www.connect I J.com?
"Because it's cool." said Zuckerberg. who is
currently on leave from Harvard University
and residing in Menlo Park.
Students do not have to be 21 to enter the
tournament at their individual schools (they
are advised to use 2 percent milk instead of
beer), but they must be 21 to compete in the na
tional tournament. Off-duty police officers will

be checking identification in New York.
Brackets will be randomly created online
for the Stanford tournament, which will feature
teams facing off in best-of-three, single-elimi
nation games. In New York, the three-day na
tional tournament will consist of a round-robin
to determine seeding, followed by a two-day,
single-elimination tournament.
Beirut, a game played by throwing ping
pong balls into cups of beer (or milk), is a grow
ing pastime at Stanford. This quarter, senior
Nick Damiano organized an unofficial Intra
mural Beirut league that will last through Dead
Week. Students are competing for "Beirut
Champions" T-shirts, as well as a makeshift
