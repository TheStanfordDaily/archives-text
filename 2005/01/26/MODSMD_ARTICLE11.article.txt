# Does this make me look fat?
## We will not go back

It is 2:12 a.m. I am crying as I write
this. I'm crying because just for
writing this column I could have
my name and address posted on a
Web site that tells visitors they are
"doing

God's
work" if
they mur
der the peo
ple — doc
tors, judges,
activists
and politi
cians— list
ed on the
page. I am
crying be
cause Dr.
George
Patterson's
name is
crossed out.
So is Dr.

Burnett Slepian's. And Dr. John Brit
ton's. They were murdered by "pro-lif
ers" who believe the lives of unborn fe
tuses were worth more than the lives of
these doctors who performed abor
tions. 1 am crying for their families. I am
crying because the Web site lists their
widows as targets. I am crying for all the
doctors too scared to provide the ser
vices their patients need.
1 am crying for the women who died
in pools of their own blood with coat
hangers in their hands. I'm crying for the
women who resorted to back-alley abor
tionists that butchered them with rusted
tools. I'm crying for all the women who
have died, and who will die, as a result of
President George W. Bush's reinstate
ment of the Global Gag Rule.
I am crying because how dare they
call themselves "pro-life?" How dare
they bomb clinics, maim staffers, harass
women and tell me that I am the one
going to hell?
I am crying because this isn't even
my problem. I could get an abortion
any time I needed to even if it were ille
gal in this country because I have the
money to take time off work and fly to
a country whose government under
stands that a woman's body is her own.
I am crying for the women who would
be stuck with unwanted pregnancies. I
am crying for their unwanted children.
As I walked through White Plaza on
Monday. I had one thought: Thank you
Stanford Students "For Life."
I had planned to attend the march in
defense of Roe v. Wade last Saturday in
San Francisco, but when my alarm went
off at 8:30 a.m. after a rough Friday
night. I decided my presence didn't
matter that much. I went back to sleep,
dreaming peacefully.
Students For Life woke me up.
The right to choose is perpetually
under attack. With each piece of legis
lation like the "Unborn Victims of Vio
lence" Act and the "Partial Birth Abor
tion" Ban, our rights are eroded. Roe v.
Wade will not be overturned with a
shocking, decisive reversal. It will be
meticulously dismantled by incremen
tal restrictions on types of procedures,
duration of the pregnancy, consent
laws and waiting periods.
It is easy to become complacent at a
liberal safe-haven like Stanford. Thank
you Students For Life for reviving my
determination.
It is now 2:34 a.m., and I'm tired of
crying. I just returned from taping a
wire hanger to the outside of my door.
It's a symbol to remind me everyday
that the fight is not over. It is a symbol
to anyone who walks by that I support
— with my words, my deeds and my
door — a woman's right to choose. I
would love it if every other pro-choice
person on t his campus did the same, not
for my ego's sake, but to show Students
For Life that they are outnumbered.
The majority of Stanford, and the coun
try. is pro-choice. We cannot let them
forget that.
I want them to know that all their ef
forts do is rejuvenate ours. I want them to
know that we appreciate their reminders
that we cannot afford to be complacent.
In gratitude for this awakening. I'm
kicking off a fundraiser. I promise to
make a contribution of $440 to Choice
USA by the end of next week. I will
raise a dollar for each cross on the lawn.
I would have chosen a dollar for each
victim of the "pro life" movement, but
it would be impossible for me to raise
that much money in a week and a half.
I know it's not much. It's a hanger
and a check, but it makes me feel bet
ter. I can stop crying and start doing.

If you'd like to contribute, or don t have
an extra hanger, e-mail me at
annekfl@stanford. edu
