# New University architect says he will stick to founding principles of Stanford
## 
### COURTNEY WEAVER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last week, Stanford's Land and Building De
partment announced the appointment of David
Lenox as the new University architect. The selec
tion is the result of a nation-wide search process
following the departure of David Neuman in 2003.
Lenox will take over the job from interim architect
H. Ruth Todd in March.
Having begun his career at Wandel & Schnell,
Architects, Inc., a Columbus, Ohio-based firm
that focuses on higher education and corporate
work, Lenox went on to NBBJ, a Columbus, Ohio
based design practice. In the past, he has also
taught as an adjunct professor at the School of Ar
chitecture at Ohio State.
Bob Reidy, Vice Provost for Land and Build
ings, feels that Lenox's experience makes him a
prime candidate fora job that requires being able
to "make a building fit in harmoniously with the
other buildings and the campus architecture as a
whole."
Reidy said: "[Lenox has] demonstrated a key
ability to manage a studio of architects and he's
very good at his interpersonal efforts." He also
noted that Lenox's "contemplative yet forward
thinking" attitude gives him an advantage in being
able to knit together old architecture with new
buildings.
In a phone interview from his last day at work
in Ohio, Lenox spoke of how he plans to maintain
the careful balance between tradition and innova
tion.
"My vision would really be to stick with the ar

chitectural principles that the school was founded
upon," he said. "[The vision] doesn't necessarily
need to stick to the style, but if it sticks to the prin
ciples it will be successful."
Lenox decided to make the move to California
because he "thought Stanford would be a good
place for the strengths that I have" and was at
tracted to the fact that "Stanford has a strong
brand both in its academic world and in its archi
tecture."
According to Reidy, Lenox will be working on
the Munger Dorms and SEQ2 (the West Science
and Engineering Quad) in addition to "a series of
projects that come up every year."
Lenox will also be responsible for the Universi
ty's landscape in conjunction with its architecture.
According to Charles Carter, Director of Land
Use and Environmental Planning at Stanford,
Lenox may encounter difficulties in regards to the
campus's land use.
"The biggest challenge for David and the Cam
pus Planning Office will be in maintaining campus
character and structure in accommodating new
growth and development," Carter said. "Good de
sign can protect essential character and enhance
open space and landscape elements while provid
ing sensible circulation and infrastructure that
compliment new and existing buildings."
According to Reidy, this new growth will most
likely involve a movement toward making parts of
campus more compact and urban in order to bal
ance "a need to grow with a desire to retain im
portant features on campus such as open space."
He added: "You don't want two-story build
ings to set the tone for the future."
