# Graduate schools offer religion in coursework
## 
### MEGAN WATKINS 
It seems that more and more these days,
graduate schools are giving a little dose of
spirituality to their students.
At Stanford this year, the Graduate
School of Business, the Law School and the
School of Medicine all offer courses that
deal in faith.
Scotty McLennan, the University's
dean of religious life, teaches "The Busi
ness World: Moral and Spiritual Inquiry
through Literature" to second-year MBA
students at the Business School. The
course covers such literature as Albert
Camus' "Stranger" and F. Scott Fitzger
ald's "The Great Gatsby" in a discussion

setting. McLennan says that the course,
which will be offered for the third time this
spring, fulfills several purposes.
"The class is organized around the in
terplay of religious traditions and national
identities," he said. "At least five different
religions have a protagonist represented in
the books. It's an international course that
asks what happens when you are trying to
do business in other countries."
"I'm trying to both help students under
stand the cultural context for values and
beliefs in which commercial activities take
place, but also the character of business
people in the novels."
McLennan started teaching a similar
course while "moonlighting" at Harvard
Business School 10 years prior to the be-

ginning of Stanford's "The Business
World: Moral and Spiritual Inquiry
through Literature." McLennan says that
he did not take on the course without
adding his own touches.
"Over the years I sort of reoriented it to
have more spiritual content," he said. "I
changed a lot of the books. Over time I en
couraged other professors to teach the
course themselves. At one point we had
three different sections of it."
The law school has courses addressing
similar issues. Dean Larry Kramer says
that the law school addresses spirituality,
though not as directly as McLennan does.
"We have a course on the First Amend
ment which explores the role of religion in
American society and the regulation of reli

gion as well as the role of tree speech," he said.
Although not available for comment,
Clarence Braddock. associate professor of
medicine at the Medical Center, teaches a
course called "Practice of Medicine,"
which integrates discussion of spirituality.
McLennan emphasizes the value of ap
proaching morality and spirituality
through fiction.
"I hope to develop some life-long habits
for students. I hope they will always read
literature and find it a source of moral
strength and sustenance. I encourage stu
dents to join book groups. Through fiction
you get to people not just in the boardroom
but in the bedroom."
