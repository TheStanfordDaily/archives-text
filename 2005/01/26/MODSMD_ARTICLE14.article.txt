## Editorial Student space must be increased 
### 
At 8,000 acres, Stanford currently stands as
the world's second-largest campus. So it's
surprising that the lack of common student
space has been such a longstanding problem
for the University.
After three long years, the administration recently
completed the Student Activities Space Master Plan,
which outlines the future space needs for Stanford stu
dents. The report discusses the potential renovation of
the Old Union complex and the White Plaza area and
outlines plans for accommodating student groups in
these areas. However, with basically no signs of such
changes being implemented anytime soon, one won
ders when these plans will actually materialize.
The University needs to take a more aggressive ap
proach toward increasing organized student space on
campus. The lack of student space has been an obvious
need beyond the three years it has taken for the Stu
dent Activity Space Task Force to finish its report.
While Stanford has postponed resolving this issue and
students have been forced to stomach this inadequacy.
Student groups still exhibit a'need fora well
planned space to hold meetings and rehearsals. Most of
them must resort to Stanford's cultural centers or open
areas in their dormitories, but these places are difficult
to reserve and susceptible to disturbances.The
Blender, a student space project that opened last year
in Old Union, was a good effort by the University ad

ministration and the ASSU to address the space needs
of student groups, but work still needs to done.
The need for more on-campus entertainment op
tions remains one of the most pressing student space
problems. Most areas where students can gather out
side their dorms — such as the CoHo or Tresidder —
function more as eateries than sources of entertain
ment. The campus lacks a central location where stu
dents can meet during their off-hours to have a good
time.
The University's location and its surrounding areas
also make the need for on-campus student entertain
ment at Stanford more critical than at other universi
ties located in college towns. Since Stanford is located
in a suburban community, students usually have to
travel by car to access outside social venues. The pub
lic transportation options provided by the University
give students only limited access to these off-campus
areas.
Sufficient student space is essential to a healthy col
lege social life. By commissioning a task force and de
veloping a report to examine the lack of student space,
the administration has shown that it recognizes the im
portance of fulfilling this need.
The University has already taken a great deal of
time in allocating space for student use, and it should
bring the task force's ideas to fruition as soon as possi
ble.
