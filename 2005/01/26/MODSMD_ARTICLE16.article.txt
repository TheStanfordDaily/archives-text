## Progressive rally was a positive event By MARIE JONAS & SAMANTHA STALEY 
### 
Last Thursday, more than 10 stu
dent groups successfully joined to
gether to put on a progressive rally
entitled Stand Up For Change. But it
you read The Daily article published
the next morning, one might have
thought the event was something else
entirely.
Though the date for the rally was
symbolically chosen to coincide with
inauguration events in Washington,
D.C., student organizers from the be
ginning were focused not on a protest
against the administration, but on
reinvigorating student activism on
campus.
Speakers included representatives
from Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion, the Stanford Democrats,
MEChA, the Stanford Greens, Stu
dents for Choice, Students for Sus
tainable Stanford and members of
the Spoken Word Collective. During
the rally, many more groups had in
formation tables highlighting pro
gressive action on campus and en
couraging immediate positive in
volvement. For example:
Fifty students signed letters of ap
preciation at the Stanford
Democrats' table to Senator Barbara
Boxer for her defense of voting
rights.
Thirty students signed letters at
the Students for Choice table to Sen
ator Arlen Specter in support of pro
choice judicial nominees.

Thirty-five students wrote letters
and signed petitions at the Amnesty
International Table.
More than 150 students signed a
progressive mailing list.
More than 250 programs of the
day's events were distributed during
the rally.
For those who didn't attend, un
less you managed to find the pre
event coverage, buried deep inside
the special Cardinal Today sports
edition that day. you'd never have
known why students worked so hard
to make the rally happen.
In short, this was an event to keep
students aware, engaged and active.
But if one read the cover story of
the rally on Friday morning, one
might have thought that the event
was organized to keep students alien
ated. uncomfortable and angry.
It's unfortunate that of the 13 stu
dents who spoke at the rally, The
Daily instead chose to quote from the
only two adult speakers. While invit
ed to speak, their views did not char
acterize the event as a whole. The
Daily might have one believe other
wise.
It's unfortunate that our student
newspaper portrayed the event as 30
students who stood their ground
while "many passersby appeared
supportive or neutral towards the
rally ..." In fact, many of the stu
dents present were anything but
"passersby," as evidenced by the
sign-ins, letters and cheers.
From the figures above, the event

clearly drew an overall standing
crowd in the hundreds, most of
whom were far from neutral.
While it's important to recognize
the diversity of views on campus, fair
and objective reporting should at
least include a balance of those view
points. Wouldn't it have been far
more representative to also include
thoughts of a student who had lis
tened throughout the event?
In their efforts to be "unbiased"
The Daily managed to misrepresent
a positive event. Perpetual emphasis
of the negative undermines potential
for events on campus; controversy
seems to be valued more than honest
portrayals.
For all those who spent late nights
imagining the event, brainstorming
with other students, telephoning
endless contacts, fliering the campus
and writing inspiring speeches, we
know the reality of last Thursday.
For all those who stopped, listened
and even wrote a letter during the
rally, they know the event was about
change.
The Daily's coverage can't under
mine the impact this event has had on
our hope for student activism in the
future.

less you managed to find the pre
event coverage, buried deep inside
the special Cardinal Today sports
edition that day. you'd never have
known why students worked so hard
to make the rally happen.
In short, this was an event to keep
students aware, engaged and active.
But if one read the cover story of
the rally on Friday morning, one
might have thought that the event
was organized to keep students alien
ated. uncomfortable and angry.
It's unfortunate that of the 13 stu
dents who spoke at the rally, The
Daily instead chose to quote from the
only two adult speakers. While invit
ed to speak, their views did not char
acterize the event as a whole. The
Daily might have one believe other
wise.
It's unfortunate that our student
newspaper portrayed the event as 30
students who stood their ground
while "many passersby appeared
supportive or neutral towards the
rally ..." In fact, many of the stu
dents present were anything but
"passersby," as evidenced by the
sign-ins, letters and cheers.
From the figures above, the event

clearly drew an overall standing
crowd in the hundreds, most of
whom were far from neutral.
While it's important to recognize
the diversity of views on campus, fair
and objective reporting should at
least include a balance of those view
points. Wouldn't it have been far
more representative to also include
thoughts of a student who had lis
tened throughout the event?
In their efforts to be "unbiased"
The Daily managed to misrepresent
a positive event. Perpetual emphasis
of the negative undermines potential
for events on campus; controversy
seems to be valued more than honest
portrayals.
For all those who spent late nights
imagining the event, brainstorming
with other students, telephoning
endless contacts, fliering the campus
and writing inspiring speeches, we
know the reality of last Thursday.
For all those who stopped, listened
and even wrote a letter during the
rally, they know the event was about
change.
The Daily's coverage can't under
mine the impact this event has had on
our hope for student activism in the
future.
