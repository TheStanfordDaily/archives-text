## School for the gifted

Imagine fora moment being in
a room with the 10 other peo
ple who wanted and asked for
the spot that Stanford gave to
you:
"Why do you deserve to he at
Stanford more than 1 do?"
Have you thought about this
one? Do you know what makes you
special? The Admissions Office cer
tainly has its pick of the litter when
it comes to letting in the special
ones. Have you thought about why
they picked you?
For each of us it is different, but
we do have one thing in common:
We're gifted.
This is true in more than one
sense. Not only are we all gifted in
the sense that

we've demon
strated the intel
lectual curiosity
necessary for ad
mittance, but
we're lucky too.
We're lucky
in that we have
an opportunity
here that few
people in the his
tory of the world

have ever had, and this is no exag
geration.
How many other places have li
braries with millions of volumes?
How many other places have world
renowned professors — geniuses —
who spend at least two hours of their
weeks, and in most cases more, in
their offices waiting to talk with
you? When else in your life are you
going to he surrounded by other
people who are on par with you in
tellectually, share your academic in
terests and laugh at your nerdy
jokes?
The answers, in order, are not
many, not many and never.
Think I'm lying? Spend a day at a
community college. Spend a day
with immigrant day laborers. Spend
a night on the streets of San Francis
co.
These are destinies that belong
to other people, not you.
Why? Because you have been
given this opportunity.
"What are you going to do with

your Stanford education?"
Have you thought about this
one? If not, then it's certainly time
you did.
I'm not saying that all you fresh
men need to choose your major or
set in stone your career path. But I
am urging you to think about what
kind of life you want to lead and
what kind of feats you can accom
plish with the training this place is
giving you.
Figure out what is important to
you, and figure out a way to get it
done.
The other day, my microeco
nomics teacher put into words what
I had basically suspected for some
time. The gist of the message was:
"The greater the gift, the greater the
responsibility."
This is true.
We have all been blessed with
gifts that the other 10 people you
face do not have. This is not a free
pass, but rather, places on you an
obligation — an obligation to those
10 people.
You will have the ability to solve
the problems of the world in the fu
ture. You will have the tools to fix
Social Security. You will have the
tools to find a cure for disease. You
will have the tools to end poverty.
And I'll help you out with the
motivation — it's those 10 people
you're facing now.
One of them is not going to be
able to save enough money over the
course of his or her life to provide a
good retirement and will need that
Social Security money. One of them
might die of a cancer that you could
fix. One of them will be too poor to
fill his or her stomach every day.
But not you.
Take your gifts and share them
with the world. Do something
worthwhile, something that makes
this world a better place for those in
the future.
If you don't, who will? After all,
who is better prepared than you?

If you have ever been inspired by a
teacher, even if it wasn 't David W.
Johnson, e-mail Nick at ndfram
