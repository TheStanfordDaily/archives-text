Anti-abortion display
insensitive to women
I was deeply saddened by the dis
play conducted by the Stanford Stu
dents for Life in the Quad on Mon
day, which consisted of crosses rep
resenting the graves of aborted fe
tuses. 1 have to ask its organizers,
what was the point? Everyone al
ready knows that abortion means
the destruction of a fetus, so they
can't argue that it was education. To
me, it seemed a lot closer to harass
ment.
I am not writing to defend the
pro-choice standpoint or to dissuade
its supporters from their own be
liefs. I just ask that we do not treat
the issue of abortion as a purely
philosophical or hypothetical de
bate, but as a very real decision that
many women on this campus have
already made.
Even if one does not agree with
the choice to abort, we owe it to each
other to be kind and to not try to
haunt a fellow classmate by creating
a representation of her aborted

fetus's grave.
Frankly, this is a tactic that is not
only malicious and disrespectful, but
utterly inappropriate. If groups like
the Stanford Students for Life truly
cared about women, they would not
treat them as monsters that kill their
own babies but as complex human
beings who did what they thought
was best, and they would not scheme
to place a massive guilt trip on them
that is neither ethical nor effective.
I do not find it at all unlikely that
a woman who passed by your display
today was healing from a recent
abortion, and the very idea that the
organization claiming to put so
much value on the sanctity of human
life would try to target their out
reach so tactlessly is appalling.
Some of these women were raped.
Some of these women were young and
confused. Whether or not they re
gretted the abortion (and statistically
speaking, the vast majority of them
don't), abortion is intensely personal
and emotional, and in all arguments
for or against it, these women (and all
women) deserve the utmost respect

when their fetuses and uteruses are
discussed in graphic detail. Anything
less is dehumanizing.
If you are indeed a person dedi
cated to "protecting and defending
the integrity and value of human life
at all stages of development," then
do extend the same courtesy to the
women of this campus. I would like
to think that students at one of the
most highly regarded universities in
the world could engage in intellectu
al debate without reverting to such
blatant insensitivity.

Abortion rights must be
protected for the safety of women
Before Roe v. Wade, United
States abortion prohibitions took a
substantial toll on women's lives.
While women with financial means
could circumvent the law and access
safe abortions, less affluent women
could not and suffered the gruesome
and often deadly consequences of

unsafe abortion.
Today, even 32 years after the
landmark Supreme Court decision,
unwanted pregnancies remain a re
ality, and women's reproductive
rights are in jeopardy.
Studies in the U.S. and around
the world show that making abor
tion illegal does not reduce the num
ber of abortions women seek. In
stead. it drives women who arc des
perate for help to turn to unsafe and
self-induced abortions — just as in
the U.S. before 1973. They often
face infertility, infection and death.
Women with less access to medical
care — women of color, immigrant
women and less affluent women —
are most likely to resort to such des
perate measures.
Opinions of abortion and contra
ception are personal and often
grounded in religious and moral be
lief, but a woman's right to make her
own. personal choices must be pro
tected under law and in practice. A
woman's ability to make decisions
about her body and her life keeps
women and families safer and

healthier, as does the ability to ac
cess safe and affordable services.
Even with Roe v. Wade still in
place, the White House's anti
choice agenda builds barriers that
deprive women of the reproductive
health services to which they are
legally entitled. Parental notifica
tion laws, laws that prohibit travel
across state lines, and major funding
cuts and restrictions deny access to
safe abortion for thousands of
women across the country. While
women struggle to secure health
coverage for general and prenatal
care, the Unborn Victims of Vio
lence Act now grants rights to the fe
tuses they carry that put women's
rights on the line.
This campaign against reproduc
tive rights extends beyond the anti
abortion platform. Increasing limits
on access to contraception and
emergency contraception (the
"morning-after pill") are built upon
the theory that access to contracep
tion encourages people to have sex.
