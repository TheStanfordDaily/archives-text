Anti-abortion display
insensitive to women
I was deeply saddened by the dis
play conducted by the Stanford Stu
dents for Life in the Quad on Mon
day, which consisted of crosses rep
resenting the graves of aborted fe
tuses. 1 have to ask its organizers,
what was the point? Everyone al
ready knows that abortion means
the destruction of a fetus, so they
can't argue that it was education. To
me, it seemed a lot closer to harass
ment.
I am not writing to defend the
pro-choice standpoint or to dissuade
its supporters from their own be
liefs. I just ask that we do not treat
the issue of abortion as a purely
philosophical or hypothetical de
bate, but as a very real decision that
many women on this campus have
already made.
Even if one does not agree with
the choice to abort, we owe it to each
other to be kind and to not try to
haunt a fellow classmate by creating
a representation of her aborted

fetus's grave.
Frankly, this is a tactic that is not
only malicious and disrespectful, but
utterly inappropriate. If groups like
the Stanford Students for Life truly
cared about women, they would not
treat them as monsters that kill their
own babies but as complex human
beings who did what they thought
was best, and they would not scheme
to place a massive guilt trip on them
that is neither ethical nor effective.
I do not find it at all unlikely that
a woman who passed by your display
today was healing from a recent
abortion, and the very idea that the
organization claiming to put so
much value on the sanctity of human
life would try to target their out
reach so tactlessly is appalling.
Some of these women were raped.
Some of these women were young and
confused. Whether or not they re
gretted the abortion (and statistically
speaking, the vast majority of them
don't), abortion is intensely personal
and emotional, and in all arguments
for or against it, these women (and all
women) deserve the utmost respect

when their fetuses and uteruses are
discussed in graphic detail. Anything
less is dehumanizing.
If you are indeed a person dedi
cated to "protecting and defending
the integrity and value of human life
at all stages of development," then
do extend the same courtesy to the
women of this campus. I would like
to think that students at one of the
most highly regarded universities in
the world could engage in intellectu
al debate without reverting to such
blatant insensitivity.

Abortion rights must be
protected for the safety of women
Before Roe v. Wade, United
States abortion prohibitions took a
substantial toll on women's lives.
While women with financial means
could circumvent the law and access
safe abortions, less affluent women
could not and suffered the gruesome
and often deadly consequences of

unsafe abortion.
Today, even 32 years after the
landmark Supreme Court decision,
unwanted pregnancies remain a re
ality, and women's reproductive
rights are in jeopardy.
Studies in the U.S. and around
the world show that making abor
tion illegal does not reduce the num
ber of abortions women seek. In
stead. it drives women who arc des
perate for help to turn to unsafe and
self-induced abortions — just as in
the U.S. before 1973. They often
face infertility, infection and death.
Women with less access to medical
care — women of color, immigrant
women and less affluent women —
are most likely to resort to such des
perate measures.
Opinions of abortion and contra
ception are personal and often
grounded in religious and moral be
lief, but a woman's right to make her
own. personal choices must be pro
tected under law and in practice. A
woman's ability to make decisions
about her body and her life keeps
women and families safer and

healthier, as does the ability to ac
cess safe and affordable services.
Even with Roe v. Wade still in
place, the White House's anti
choice agenda builds barriers that
deprive women of the reproductive
health services to which they are
legally entitled. Parental notifica
tion laws, laws that prohibit travel
across state lines, and major funding
cuts and restrictions deny access to
safe abortion for thousands of
women across the country. While
women struggle to secure health
coverage for general and prenatal
care, the Unborn Victims of Vio
lence Act now grants rights to the fe
tuses they carry that put women's
rights on the line.
This campaign against reproduc
tive rights extends beyond the anti
abortion platform. Increasing limits
on access to contraception and
emergency contraception (the
"morning-after pill") are built upon
the theory that access to contracep
tion encourages people to have sex.
This theory is incorrect.
Instead, contraception is a
proven method that decreases the
number of unwanted pregnancies
and therefore decreases the demand
for abortions. Against FDA recom
mendations, the federal govern
ment refuses to allow the morning
alter pill to be sold over-the
counter, thus creating yet another
barrier for women.
Furthermore, the government's
anti-choice campaign fails to edu
cate young people about safe-sex
practices. Recent Congressional
findings show that government
funded "abstinence-only" sex edu
cation programs provide young peo
ple with scientifically inaccurate in
formation about contraception and
go further to teach children that het
erosexual sex within the context of
marriage is the only moral sexual
behavior — a discriminatory ap
proach, since marriage rights are de
nied to millions of Americans.
The comprehensive sex educa
tion programs that are being re
placed by the "abstinence-only" ap
proach have been shown to decrease
rates of unwanted pregnancy, abor
tions and STD transmission, while
empowering young people to make
educated choices about their lives.
While it is important to celebrate
the 32nd anniversary of Roe v.
Wade and the rights it protects, it is
also important to use this occasion
to recognize the need for continued
pro-choice support and activism in
the U.S. and elsewhere. To be pro
choice is to fight for the rights of all
people to make informed decisions
about their bodies and their lives. It
means allowing all Americans to
make their own choices based on
their own moral values, including

the choice to prevent a pregnancy,
have an abortion, or have a child.
A woman's decision to have an
abortion can be a difficult one, but
that decision must be her own. As
long as inequality and unwanted
pregnancy are a reality, we must up
hold the right to choose at all costs.

Pro-life demonstration was
solemn and peaceful, not
judgmental and intimidating
1 want to thank the members of
The Daily for Tuesday's beautiful
front page photo of the Roe v. Wade
memorial, although, judging from
the caption, 1 fear that the writer
mistook medical models of prenatal
development for "graphic images of
deceased fetuses" that were suppos
edly displayed at our booth.
This point highlights the dispari
ty between the general accusations
of those the day's activities offended
(namely, that pro-lifers were "shov
ing hugely emotional" symbols into
others' faces with the apparent goal
of making people feel bad) and the
actual nature of those activities.
First of all, the demonstration
was a peaceful and solemn state
ment about the ills of our society,
not a judgment on those who dis
agree with us or have had an abor
tion. It was also intended to be non
religious and non-exclusive, the
much-criticized use of crosses only
simulating a stereotypical cemetery
scene. (The other option, tomb
stones reading RIP, would have
been too grim and would have
lacked the desired serenity.)
Since awareness is an important
element of any issue involving
choice and choices, members of
Stanford Students for Life were al
ways present to answer questions,
dialogue and hand out information

al — not judgmental — pamphlets.
Also, as the flier associated with
the display explained, the memorial
not only mourned the deaths of mil
lions of unborn children but also de
cried our utilitarian, irresponsible,
and still male-oriented society that
shamelessly exploits women and has
led to many of the admittedly seri
ous problems that abortion intends
to address.
In contrast to Galen Panger's inti
mations, pro-life groups have been at
the forefront of trying to "ensure that
women did not feel helpless or alone
when facing an unwanted pregnan
cy." This is in fact one of the founda
tional goals of the pro-life move
ment, and Stanford Students for Life
has been active in community out
reach providing emotional and mate
rial support to low-income women
facing unplanned pregnancies.
There are certainly serious social
disorders behind the 44 million legal
abortions since 1973, and, just be
cause we categorically deny that
killing 44 million people is an ac
ceptable solution to the problems,
we firmly believe that it is our duty
to address them in an ethical way
that gets to the heart of the matter
instead of simply avoiding it.
The ultimate goal of a society in
which no woman feels the need to
dispose of her children — the goal
of a society in which all children are
wanted — will only be possible with
sweeping changes to a disordered
culture, and these changes will begin
with an increased respect for human
dignity.
In the meantime, we must all do
what we can to protect the basic
rights of all human beings upon
which our nation is founded — basic
rights which should not be at the
mercy of another's choice.

ality, and women's reproductive
rights are in jeopardy.
Studies in the U.S. and around
the world show that making abor
tion illegal does not reduce the num
ber of abortions women seek. In
stead. it drives women who arc des
perate for help to turn to unsafe and
self-induced abortions — just as in
the U.S. before 1973. They often
face infertility, infection and death.
Women with less access to medical
care — women of color, immigrant
women and less affluent women —
are most likely to resort to such des
perate measures.
Opinions of abortion and contra
ception are personal and often
grounded in religious and moral be
lief, but a woman's right to make her
own. personal choices must be pro
tected under law and in practice. A
woman's ability to make decisions
about her body and her life keeps
women and families safer and

healthier, as does the ability to ac
cess safe and affordable services.
Even with Roe v. Wade still in
place, the White House's anti
choice agenda builds barriers that
deprive women of the reproductive
health services to which they are
legally entitled. Parental notifica
tion laws, laws that prohibit travel
across state lines, and major funding
cuts and restrictions deny access to
safe abortion for thousands of
women across the country. While
women struggle to secure health
coverage for general and prenatal
care, the Unborn Victims of Vio
lence Act now grants rights to the fe
tuses they carry that put women's
rights on the line.
This campaign against reproduc
tive rights extends beyond the anti
abortion platform. Increasing limits
on access to contraception and
emergency contraception (the
"morning-after pill") are built upon
the theory that access to contracep
tion encourages people to have sex.
This theory is incorrect.
Instead, contraception is a
proven method that decreases the
number of unwanted pregnancies
and therefore decreases the demand
for abortions. Against FDA recom
mendations, the federal govern
ment refuses to allow the morning
alter pill to be sold over-the
counter, thus creating yet another
barrier for women.
Furthermore, the government's
anti-choice campaign fails to edu
cate young people about safe-sex
practices. Recent Congressional
findings show that government
funded "abstinence-only" sex edu
cation programs provide young peo
ple with scientifically inaccurate in
formation about contraception and
go further to teach children that het
erosexual sex within the context of
marriage is the only moral sexual
behavior — a discriminatory ap
proach, since marriage rights are de
nied to millions of Americans.
The comprehensive sex educa
tion programs that are being re
placed by the "abstinence-only" ap
proach have been shown to decrease
rates of unwanted pregnancy, abor
tions and STD transmission, while
empowering young people to make
educated choices about their lives.
While it is important to celebrate
the 32nd anniversary of Roe v.
Wade and the rights it protects, it is
also important to use this occasion
to recognize the need for continued
pro-choice support and activism in
the U.S. and elsewhere. To be pro
choice is to fight for the rights of all
people to make informed decisions
about their bodies and their lives. It
means allowing all Americans to
make their own choices based on
their own moral values, including

the choice to prevent a pregnancy,
have an abortion, or have a child.
A woman's decision to have an
abortion can be a difficult one, but
that decision must be her own. As
long as inequality and unwanted
pregnancy are a reality, we must up
hold the right to choose at all costs.

Pro-life demonstration was
solemn and peaceful, not
judgmental and intimidating
1 want to thank the members of
The Daily for Tuesday's beautiful
front page photo of the Roe v. Wade
memorial, although, judging from
the caption, 1 fear that the writer
mistook medical models of prenatal
development for "graphic images of
deceased fetuses" that were suppos
edly displayed at our booth.
This point highlights the dispari
ty between the general accusations
of those the day's activities offended
(namely, that pro-lifers were "shov
ing hugely emotional" symbols into
others' faces with the apparent goal
of making people feel bad) and the
actual nature of those activities.
First of all, the demonstration
was a peaceful and solemn state
ment about the ills of our society,
not a judgment on those who dis
agree with us or have had an abor
tion. It was also intended to be non
religious and non-exclusive, the
much-criticized use of crosses only
simulating a stereotypical cemetery
scene. (The other option, tomb
stones reading RIP, would have
been too grim and would have
lacked the desired serenity.)
Since awareness is an important
element of any issue involving
choice and choices, members of
Stanford Students for Life were al
ways present to answer questions,
dialogue and hand out information

al — not judgmental — pamphlets.
Also, as the flier associated with
the display explained, the memorial
not only mourned the deaths of mil
lions of unborn children but also de
cried our utilitarian, irresponsible,
and still male-oriented society that
shamelessly exploits women and has
led to many of the admittedly seri
ous problems that abortion intends
to address.
In contrast to Galen Panger's inti
mations, pro-life groups have been at
the forefront of trying to "ensure that
women did not feel helpless or alone
when facing an unwanted pregnan
cy." This is in fact one of the founda
tional goals of the pro-life move
ment, and Stanford Students for Life
has been active in community out
reach providing emotional and mate
rial support to low-income women
facing unplanned pregnancies.
There are certainly serious social
disorders behind the 44 million legal
abortions since 1973, and, just be
cause we categorically deny that
killing 44 million people is an ac
ceptable solution to the problems,
we firmly believe that it is our duty
to address them in an ethical way
that gets to the heart of the matter
instead of simply avoiding it.
The ultimate goal of a society in
which no woman feels the need to
dispose of her children — the goal
of a society in which all children are
wanted — will only be possible with
sweeping changes to a disordered
culture, and these changes will begin
with an increased respect for human
dignity.
In the meantime, we must all do
what we can to protect the basic
rights of all human beings upon
which our nation is founded — basic
rights which should not be at the
mercy of another's choice.

Anti-abortion display
insensitive to women
I was deeply saddened by the dis
play conducted by the Stanford Stu
dents for Life in the Quad on Mon
day, which consisted of crosses rep
resenting the graves of aborted fe
tuses. 1 have to ask its organizers,
what was the point? Everyone al
ready knows that abortion means
the destruction of a fetus, so they
can't argue that it was education. To
me, it seemed a lot closer to harass
ment.
I am not writing to defend the
pro-choice standpoint or to dissuade
its supporters from their own be
liefs. I just ask that we do not treat
the issue of abortion as a purely
philosophical or hypothetical de
bate, but as a very real decision that
many women on this campus have
already made.
Even if one does not agree with
the choice to abort, we owe it to each
other to be kind and to not try to
haunt a fellow classmate by creating
a representation of her aborted

fetus's grave.
Frankly, this is a tactic that is not
only malicious and disrespectful, but
utterly inappropriate. If groups like
the Stanford Students for Life truly
cared about women, they would not
treat them as monsters that kill their
own babies but as complex human
beings who did what they thought
was best, and they would not scheme
to place a massive guilt trip on them
that is neither ethical nor effective.
I do not find it at all unlikely that
a woman who passed by your display
today was healing from a recent
abortion, and the very idea that the
organization claiming to put so
much value on the sanctity of human
life would try to target their out
reach so tactlessly is appalling.
Some of these women were raped.
Some of these women were young and
confused. Whether or not they re
gretted the abortion (and statistically
speaking, the vast majority of them
don't), abortion is intensely personal
and emotional, and in all arguments
for or against it, these women (and all
women) deserve the utmost respect

when their fetuses and uteruses are
discussed in graphic detail. Anything
less is dehumanizing.
If you are indeed a person dedi
cated to "protecting and defending
the integrity and value of human life
at all stages of development," then
do extend the same courtesy to the
women of this campus. I would like
to think that students at one of the
most highly regarded universities in
the world could engage in intellectu
al debate without reverting to such
blatant insensitivity.

also important to use this occasion
to recognize the need for continued
pro-choice support and activism in
the U.S. and elsewhere. To be pro
choice is to fight for the rights of all
people to make informed decisions
about their bodies and their lives. It
means allowing all Americans to
make their own choices based on
their own moral values, including

the choice to prevent a pregnancy,
have an abortion, or have a child.
A woman's decision to have an
abortion can be a difficult one, but
that decision must be her own. As
long as inequality and unwanted
pregnancy are a reality, we must up
hold the right to choose at all costs.

Pro-life demonstration was
solemn and peaceful, not
judgmental and intimidating
1 want to thank the members of
The Daily for Tuesday's beautiful
front page photo of the Roe v. Wade
memorial, although, judging from
the caption, 1 fear that the writer
mistook medical models of prenatal
development for "graphic images of
deceased fetuses" that were suppos
edly displayed at our booth.
This point highlights the dispari
ty between the general accusations
of those the day's activities offended
(namely, that pro-lifers were "shov
ing hugely emotional" symbols into
others' faces with the apparent goal
of making people feel bad) and the
actual nature of those activities.
First of all, the demonstration
was a peaceful and solemn state
ment about the ills of our society,
not a judgment on those who dis
agree with us or have had an abor
tion. It was also intended to be non
religious and non-exclusive, the
much-criticized use of crosses only
simulating a stereotypical cemetery
scene. (The other option, tomb
stones reading RIP, would have
been too grim and would have
lacked the desired serenity.)
Since awareness is an important
element of any issue involving
choice and choices, members of
Stanford Students for Life were al
ways present to answer questions,
dialogue and hand out information

al — not judgmental — pamphlets.
Also, as the flier associated with
the display explained, the memorial
not only mourned the deaths of mil
lions of unborn children but also de
cried our utilitarian, irresponsible,
and still male-oriented society that
shamelessly exploits women and has
led to many of the admittedly seri
ous problems that abortion intends
to address.
In contrast to Galen Panger's inti
mations, pro-life groups have been at
the forefront of trying to "ensure that
women did not feel helpless or alone
when facing an unwanted pregnan
cy." This is in fact one of the founda
tional goals of the pro-life move
ment, and Stanford Students for Life
has been active in community out
reach providing emotional and mate
rial support to low-income women
facing unplanned pregnancies.
There are certainly serious social
disorders behind the 44 million legal
abortions since 1973, and, just be
cause we categorically deny that
killing 44 million people is an ac
ceptable solution to the problems,
we firmly believe that it is our duty
to address them in an ethical way
that gets to the heart of the matter
instead of simply avoiding it.
The ultimate goal of a society in
which no woman feels the need to
dispose of her children — the goal
of a society in which all children are
wanted — will only be possible with
sweeping changes to a disordered
culture, and these changes will begin
with an increased respect for human
dignity.
In the meantime, we must all do
what we can to protect the basic
rights of all human beings upon
which our nation is founded — basic
rights which should not be at the
mercy of another's choice.

Anti-abortion display
insensitive to women
I was deeply saddened by the dis
play conducted by the Stanford Stu
dents for Life in the Quad on Mon
day, which consisted of crosses rep
resenting the graves of aborted fe
tuses. 1 have to ask its organizers,
what was the point? Everyone al
ready knows that abortion means
the destruction of a fetus, so they
can't argue that it was education. To
me, it seemed a lot closer to harass
ment.
I am not writing to defend the
pro-choice standpoint or to dissuade
its supporters from their own be
liefs. I just ask that we do not treat
the issue of abortion as a purely
philosophical or hypothetical de
bate, but as a very real decision that
many women on this campus have
already made.
Even if one does not agree with
the choice to abort, we owe it to each
other to be kind and to not try to
haunt a fellow classmate by creating
a representation of her aborted

fetus's grave.
Frankly, this is a tactic that is not
only malicious and disrespectful, but
utterly inappropriate. If groups like
the Stanford Students for Life truly
cared about women, they would not
treat them as monsters that kill their
own babies but as complex human
beings who did what they thought
was best, and they would not scheme
to place a massive guilt trip on them
that is neither ethical nor effective.
I do not find it at all unlikely that
a woman who passed by your display
today was healing from a recent
abortion, and the very idea that the
organization claiming to put so
much value on the sanctity of human
life would try to target their out
reach so tactlessly is appalling.
Some of these women were raped.
Some of these women were young and
confused. Whether or not they re
gretted the abortion (and statistically
speaking, the vast majority of them
don't), abortion is intensely personal
and emotional, and in all arguments
for or against it, these women (and all
women) deserve the utmost respect

when their fetuses and uteruses are
discussed in graphic detail. Anything
less is dehumanizing.
If you are indeed a person dedi
cated to "protecting and defending
the integrity and value of human life
at all stages of development," then
do extend the same courtesy to the
women of this campus. I would like
to think that students at one of the
most highly regarded universities in
the world could engage in intellectu
al debate without reverting to such
blatant insensitivity.

Abortion rights must be
protected for the safety of women
Before Roe v. Wade, United
States abortion prohibitions took a
substantial toll on women's lives.
While women with financial means
could circumvent the law and access
safe abortions, less affluent women
could not and suffered the gruesome
and often deadly consequences of

unsafe abortion.
Today, even 32 years after the
landmark Supreme Court decision,
unwanted pregnancies remain a re
ality, and women's reproductive
rights are in jeopardy.
Studies in the U.S. and around
the world show that making abor
tion illegal does not reduce the num
ber of abortions women seek. In
stead. it drives women who arc des
perate for help to turn to unsafe and
self-induced abortions — just as in
the U.S. before 1973. They often
face infertility, infection and death.
Women with less access to medical
care — women of color, immigrant
women and less affluent women —
are most likely to resort to such des
perate measures.
Opinions of abortion and contra
ception are personal and often
grounded in religious and moral be
lief, but a woman's right to make her
own. personal choices must be pro
tected under law and in practice. A
woman's ability to make decisions
about her body and her life keeps
women and families safer and

healthier, as does the ability to ac
cess safe and affordable services.
Even with Roe v. Wade still in
place, the White House's anti
choice agenda builds barriers that
deprive women of the reproductive
health services to which they are
legally entitled. Parental notifica
tion laws, laws that prohibit travel
across state lines, and major funding
cuts and restrictions deny access to
safe abortion for thousands of
women across the country. While
women struggle to secure health
coverage for general and prenatal
care, the Unborn Victims of Vio
lence Act now grants rights to the fe
tuses they carry that put women's
rights on the line.
This campaign against reproduc
tive rights extends beyond the anti
abortion platform. Increasing limits
on access to contraception and
emergency contraception (the
"morning-after pill") are built upon
the theory that access to contracep
tion encourages people to have sex.
This theory is incorrect.
Instead, contraception is a
proven method that decreases the
number of unwanted pregnancies
and therefore decreases the demand
for abortions. Against FDA recom
mendations, the federal govern
ment refuses to allow the morning
alter pill to be sold over-the
counter, thus creating yet another
barrier for women.
Furthermore, the government's
anti-choice campaign fails to edu
cate young people about safe-sex
practices. Recent Congressional
findings show that government
funded "abstinence-only" sex edu
cation programs provide young peo
ple with scientifically inaccurate in
formation about contraception and
go further to teach children that het
erosexual sex within the context of
marriage is the only moral sexual
behavior — a discriminatory ap
proach, since marriage rights are de
nied to millions of Americans.
The comprehensive sex educa
tion programs that are being re
placed by the "abstinence-only" ap
proach have been shown to decrease
rates of unwanted pregnancy, abor
tions and STD transmission, while
empowering young people to make
educated choices about their lives.
While it is important to celebrate
the 32nd anniversary of Roe v.
Wade and the rights it protects, it is
also important to use this occasion
to recognize the need for continued
pro-choice support and activism in
the U.S. and elsewhere. To be pro
