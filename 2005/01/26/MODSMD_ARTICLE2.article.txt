# Stanford researchers well-positioned to receive stem cell grants

Editor's note: This article is the first of
two examining stem cell research.
Today's article discusses how Stanford
will be affected by the passage of Propo
sition 71. Tomorrow's article will discuss
how Stanford professors are playing a
role in the national and state debates
about stem cell research.
While stem cell researchers across
the country seeking federal funding face
an increasing number of hurdles, Stan
ford and other California institutions
could receive state funding that will ex
ceed any federal funding for stem cell re
search. Already a leader in stem cell re
search, Stanford is likely to receive
grants from the California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine, formed after
the passage of Proposition 71 last No
vember. The result, prominent scientists
on campus said, is expected to bring
about advances in medical therapies
that will benefit both Stanford and the
state.
"Stanford will get money [from the
California Institute] because it houses a
terrific collection of people who are
doing absolutely cutting-edge research
in stem cell biology and trying to apply
that research to disease," said Biochem
istry Emeritus Prof. Paul Berg, a Nobel
laureate and prominent supporter of
stem cell research. "There isn't any
place better suited. [The money is] not
going to go to Harvard, it's not going to
St. Louis or Dallas, it's going to be done
in California."
Money from the new state institute,
which will be financed with $3 billion
and up to $350 million a year instate
bonds for the next decade, will support
Stanford's Institute for Cancer /Stem
Cell Biology and Medicine with essen
tial financing.
"We are fundraising to develop
enough money to develop this research
and give it up a kick start," said Patholo
gy Prof. Irving Weissman, the stem cell
institute's director.
Stanford started its stem cell institute
in 2002 after receiving a private dona
tion of $12 million from an anonymous
donor. The institute is interdisciplinary
and includes both basic scientific and
clinical research.
Weissman said the institute plans to
build a facility at the medical school that
will house comprehensive cancer and
stem cell research. He said there will
need to be temporary facilities in place
by this fall and that more permanent de
velopments will probably take place
over the next four years.

Weissman said that stem cell re
search and cancer research are not unre
lated. One of the goals of the institute,
he said, is to refocus cancer research
from the entire cancer to just its stem
cells, which are capable of moving
through the blood stream and replicat
ing throughout the body.
Weissman said he hopes to use state
funding not only for facilities, but also to
recruit new researchers and clinicians.
He said he is especially looking for re
searchers who could find stem cells for
different types of cancer.
"We already have a few people who
are excellent at working with adult type
stem cells," Weissman said. "We hope
to recruit others working with human
embryonic stem cells."
Weissman said one of the institute's
goals is creating new human stem cell
lines through nuclear transfer.
So far. the process — which entails
replacing the genetic information in an
embryo in order to replicate a certain
person's stem cells — has only been
done in South Korea. It is a controver
sial process, yet one Weissman called
"extremely important."
"Our objective is to take stem cells
(from) someone with a disease like Juve
nile Diabetes and use the genetic infor
mation to make a cell line to understand
how the genes you inherent cause the
diseases," he said. "That's a long-term
goal, and it's certainly one that we could
not fund with federal funds."
Dr. Philip Pizzo, dean of the medical
school, is one of the 29 people who will
be deciding just where the state funds
go. Pizzo was the first person named to
sit on the Independent Citizens Over
sight Committee, the state institute's
governing board. He said he hopes Stan
ford's research agenda will be broad.
"The obvious focus areas will be appli
cations to the study and treatment of
cancer, neurological disorders, diabetes,
cardiovascular disorders, organ trans
plantation among others," he wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily.
Do California schools have
an unfair edge?
These goals will prove easier to reach
in California than elsewhere after the
passage of Prop. 71. Since 2001, federal
funding for stem cell research has been
restricted to a limited number of al
ready-existing stem cell lines. However,
researchers from the University of Cali
fornia-San Diego claimed on Sunday
that all the available stem cell lines are
contaminated and are potentially risky
