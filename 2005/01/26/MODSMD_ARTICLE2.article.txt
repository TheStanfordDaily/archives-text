### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Editor's note: This article is the first of
two examining stem cell research.
Today's article discusses how Stanford
will be affected by the passage of Propo
sition 71. Tomorrow's article will discuss
how Stanford professors are playing a
role in the national and state debates
about stem cell research.
While stem cell researchers across
the country seeking federal funding face
an increasing number of hurdles, Stan
ford and other California institutions
could receive state funding that will ex
ceed any federal funding for stem cell re
search. Already a leader in stem cell re
search, Stanford is likely to receive
grants from the California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine, formed after
the passage of Proposition 71 last No
vember. The result, prominent scientists
on campus said, is expected to bring
about advances in medical therapies
that will benefit both Stanford and the
state.
"Stanford will get money [from the
California Institute] because it houses a
terrific collection of people who are
doing absolutely cutting-edge research
in stem cell biology and trying to apply
that research to disease," said Biochem
istry Emeritus Prof. Paul Berg, a Nobel
laureate and prominent supporter of
stem cell research. "There isn't any
place better suited. [The money is] not
going to go to Harvard, it's not going to
St. Louis or Dallas, it's going to be done
in California."
Money from the new state institute,
which will be financed with $3 billion
and up to $350 million a year instate
bonds for the next decade, will support
Stanford's Institute for Cancer /Stem
Cell Biology and Medicine with essen
tial financing.
"We are fundraising to develop
enough money to develop this research
and give it up a kick start," said Patholo
gy Prof. Irving Weissman, the stem cell
institute's director.
Stanford started its stem cell institute
in 2002 after receiving a private dona
tion of $12 million from an anonymous
donor. The institute is interdisciplinary
and includes both basic scientific and
clinical research.
Weissman said the institute plans to
build a facility at the medical school that
will house comprehensive cancer and
stem cell research. He said there will
need to be temporary facilities in place
by this fall and that more permanent de
velopments will probably take place
over the next four years.

Weissman said that stem cell re
search and cancer research are not unre
lated. One of the goals of the institute,
he said, is to refocus cancer research
from the entire cancer to just its stem
cells, which are capable of moving
through the blood stream and replicat
ing throughout the body.
Weissman said he hopes to use state
funding not only for facilities, but also to
recruit new researchers and clinicians.
He said he is especially looking for re
searchers who could find stem cells for
different types of cancer.
"We already have a few people who
are excellent at working with adult type
stem cells," Weissman said. "We hope
to recruit others working with human
embryonic stem cells."
Weissman said one of the institute's
goals is creating new human stem cell
lines through nuclear transfer.
So far. the process — which entails
replacing the genetic information in an
embryo in order to replicate a certain
person's stem cells — has only been
done in South Korea. It is a controver
sial process, yet one Weissman called
"extremely important."
"Our objective is to take stem cells
(from) someone with a disease like Juve
nile Diabetes and use the genetic infor
mation to make a cell line to understand
how the genes you inherent cause the
diseases," he said. "That's a long-term
goal, and it's certainly one that we could
not fund with federal funds."
Dr. Philip Pizzo, dean of the medical
school, is one of the 29 people who will
be deciding just where the state funds
go. Pizzo was the first person named to
sit on the Independent Citizens Over
sight Committee, the state institute's
governing board. He said he hopes Stan
ford's research agenda will be broad.
"The obvious focus areas will be appli
cations to the study and treatment of
cancer, neurological disorders, diabetes,
cardiovascular disorders, organ trans
plantation among others," he wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily.
Do California schools have
an unfair edge?
These goals will prove easier to reach
in California than elsewhere after the
passage of Prop. 71. Since 2001, federal
funding for stem cell research has been
restricted to a limited number of al
ready-existing stem cell lines. However,
researchers from the University of Cali
fornia-San Diego claimed on Sunday
that all the available stem cell lines are
contaminated and are potentially risky
to use for medical therapies.
It is expected that because of the
limited federal 112 unding, many top re
searchers will he interested in mov
ing to California to finance their
work with state funds.
"We will he looking for the very
best and brightest investigators,"
Pizzo said. "We do not intend to re
cruit a large number of people —but
those that we do recruit will hopeful
ly bring new skills or techniques or
will help establish new directions."
Besides attracting researchers,
Berg said that the new funding will
also help bring in the best students to
Stanford and to other California
schools.
"It'll attract students who want to
work in this field," Berg said. "It'll
attract grad students who come here
because as they look around and ask
what's some of the hot new areas in
biological sciences — stem cell re
search is one of them. The cumula
tive effect is to make Stanford and
other leading institutions in Califor
nia sort of a Mecca for this line of
work."
One of the criticisms that has
been brought against California's
new institute is that it will show fa
voritism toward institutions such as
Stanford that have representatives
— like Pizzo — helping to develop
the institute and deciding how to dis
tribute funds.
In response to this. Berg said it is
only logical for leading scientists to
be involved in the decision-making
process.
"You have to ask yourself who
are the insiders," he said. "The in
siders are the leading stem cell biol
ogists in the world, and the institu
tions that are going to benefit from it
are institutions that are doing the
most promising research and where
these world leading scientists
work."
Berg added that there is enough
money budgeted to fund almost all
of the leading scientists in the state,
and if Stanford were to get a dispro

portionate share of the funding, it
would only be because of the quality
of the research being done.
"There's no secret agreement
that Stanford will get so much. Cal
Tech so much — it's going to be
going out on the basis of merit: who's
doing good science, who's getting
good leads, who's ultimately the one
most likely to develop the kinds of
cures the citizens of California voted
for,"he said.
Another misconception, accord
ing to Berg, is that insiders will prof
it from patenting discoveries made.
He said that any discoveries made
using state funds will presumably be
patented by the state and that profit
ing from stem cell research is far
down the road anyway.
"I can guarantee you, if you look
at how long it takes to develop a
therapy or a drug, and then to get a
patent, and then to license it and
then for that company to develop it
into a commercial thing, it's going to
be years and years before there's any
money that comes back," Berg said.
"The benefits that will come will be
from discoveries that will be imme
diately applicable to treating pa
tients. To get money out of discover
ies is a very long process."
Many other states and universi
ties are also taking steps to regulate
stem cell research and its funding.
Some states have restricted by pro
hibiting nuclear transfer research,
and some states — such as New Jer
sey — have pledged to fund stem
cell research like California. Addi
tionally, Harvard University has
pledged to raise $100 million dollars
for stem cell research.
"It's not to be conceivable that
the rest of the leading universities in
the country are going to sit idly by
and say. Well, we'll let all the stem
cell research go on in California,'
without a light," Berg said. "But, I
think none of the states has come
close or can come close to the kind of
activity that is going to uo on here."

work."
Berg added that there is enough
money budgeted to fund almost all
of the leading scientists in the state,
and if Stanford were to get a dispro

would only be because of the quality
of the research being done.
"There's no secret agreement
that Stanford will get so much. Cal

money that comes back," Berg said.
"The benefits that will come will be
from discoveries that will be imme

Many other states and universi

stem cell research and its funding.
Some states have restricted by pro
hibiting nuclear transfer research,
and some states — such as New Jer
sey — have pledged to fund stem
cell research like California. Addi
tionally, Harvard University has
pledged to raise $100 million dollars
for stem cell research.
"It's not to be conceivable that
the rest of the leading universities in
the country are going to sit idly by

without a light," Berg said. "But, I

Stanford to
take lead role
Editor's note: This article is the first of
two examining stem cell research.
Today's article discusses how Stanford
will be affected by the passage of Propo
sition 71. Tomorrow's article will discuss
how Stanford professors are playing a
role in the national and state debates
about stem cell research.
While stem cell researchers across
the country seeking federal funding face
an increasing number of hurdles, Stan
ford and other California institutions
could receive state funding that will ex
ceed any federal funding for stem cell re
search. Already a leader in stem cell re
search, Stanford is likely to receive
grants from the California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine, formed after
the passage of Proposition 71 last No
vember. The result, prominent scientists
on campus said, is expected to bring
about advances in medical therapies
that will benefit both Stanford and the
state.
"Stanford will get money [from the
California Institute] because it houses a
terrific collection of people who are
doing absolutely cutting-edge research
in stem cell biology and trying to apply
that research to disease," said Biochem
istry Emeritus Prof. Paul Berg, a Nobel
laureate and prominent supporter of
stem cell research. "There isn't any
place better suited. [The money is] not
going to go to Harvard, it's not going to
St. Louis or Dallas, it's going to be done
in California."
Money from the new state institute,
which will be financed with $3 billion
and up to $350 million a year instate
bonds for the next decade, will support
Stanford's Institute for Cancer /Stem
Cell Biology and Medicine with essen
tial financing.
"We are fundraising to develop
enough money to develop this research
and give it up a kick start," said Patholo
gy Prof. Irving Weissman, the stem cell
institute's director.
Stanford started its stem cell institute
in 2002 after receiving a private dona
tion of $12 million from an anonymous
donor. The institute is interdisciplinary
and includes both basic scientific and
clinical research.
Weissman said the institute plans to
build a facility at the medical school that
will house comprehensive cancer and
stem cell research. He said there will
need to be temporary facilities in place
by this fall and that more permanent de
velopments will probably take place
over the next four years.

Weissman said that stem cell re
search and cancer research are not unre
lated. One of the goals of the institute,
he said, is to refocus cancer research
from the entire cancer to just its stem
cells, which are capable of moving
through the blood stream and replicat
ing throughout the body.
Weissman said he hopes to use state
funding not only for facilities, but also to
recruit new researchers and clinicians.
He said he is especially looking for re
searchers who could find stem cells for
different types of cancer.
"We already have a few people who
are excellent at working with adult type
stem cells," Weissman said. "We hope
to recruit others working with human
embryonic stem cells."
Weissman said one of the institute's
goals is creating new human stem cell
lines through nuclear transfer.
So far. the process — which entails
replacing the genetic information in an
embryo in order to replicate a certain
person's stem cells — has only been
done in South Korea. It is a controver
sial process, yet one Weissman called
"extremely important."
"Our objective is to take stem cells
(from) someone with a disease like Juve
nile Diabetes and use the genetic infor
mation to make a cell line to understand
how the genes you inherent cause the
diseases," he said. "That's a long-term
goal, and it's certainly one that we could
not fund with federal funds."
Dr. Philip Pizzo, dean of the medical
school, is one of the 29 people who will
be deciding just where the state funds
go. Pizzo was the first person named to
sit on the Independent Citizens Over
sight Committee, the state institute's
governing board. He said he hopes Stan
ford's research agenda will be broad.
"The obvious focus areas will be appli
cations to the study and treatment of
cancer, neurological disorders, diabetes,
cardiovascular disorders, organ trans
plantation among others," he wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily.
Do California schools have
an unfair edge?
These goals will prove easier to reach
in California than elsewhere after the
passage of Prop. 71. Since 2001, federal
funding for stem cell research has been
restricted to a limited number of al
ready-existing stem cell lines. However,
researchers from the University of Cali
fornia-San Diego claimed on Sunday
that all the available stem cell lines are
contaminated and are potentially risky
to use for medical therapies.
It is expected that because of the
limited federal 112 unding, many top re
searchers will he interested in mov
ing to California to finance their
work with state funds.
"We will he looking for the very
best and brightest investigators,"
Pizzo said. "We do not intend to re
cruit a large number of people —but
those that we do recruit will hopeful
ly bring new skills or techniques or
will help establish new directions."
Besides attracting researchers,
Berg said that the new funding will
also help bring in the best students to
Stanford and to other California
schools.
"It'll attract students who want to
work in this field," Berg said. "It'll
attract grad students who come here
because as they look around and ask
what's some of the hot new areas in
biological sciences — stem cell re
search is one of them. The cumula
tive effect is to make Stanford and
other leading institutions in Califor
nia sort of a Mecca for this line of
work."
One of the criticisms that has
been brought against California's
new institute is that it will show fa
voritism toward institutions such as
Stanford that have representatives
— like Pizzo — helping to develop
the institute and deciding how to dis
tribute funds.
In response to this. Berg said it is
only logical for leading scientists to
be involved in the decision-making
process.
"You have to ask yourself who
are the insiders," he said. "The in
siders are the leading stem cell biol

most promising research and where

ford's research agenda will be broad.

Do California schools have
an unfair edge?
These goals will prove easier to reach
in California than elsewhere after the
passage of Prop. 71. Since 2001, federal
funding for stem cell research has been
restricted to a limited number of al
ready-existing stem cell lines. However,
researchers from the University of Cali
fornia-San Diego claimed on Sunday
that all the available stem cell lines are
contaminated and are potentially risky
to use for medical therapies.
It is expected that because of the
limited federal 112 unding, many top re
searchers will he interested in mov
ing to California to finance their
work with state funds.
"We will he looking for the very
best and brightest investigators,"
Pizzo said. "We do not intend to re
cruit a large number of people —but
those that we do recruit will hopeful
ly bring new skills or techniques or
will help establish new directions."
Besides attracting researchers,
Berg said that the new funding will
also help bring in the best students to
Stanford and to other California
schools.
"It'll attract students who want to
work in this field," Berg said. "It'll
attract grad students who come here
because as they look around and ask
what's some of the hot new areas in
biological sciences — stem cell re
search is one of them. The cumula
tive effect is to make Stanford and
other leading institutions in Califor
nia sort of a Mecca for this line of
work."
One of the criticisms that has
been brought against California's
new institute is that it will show fa
voritism toward institutions such as
Stanford that have representatives
— like Pizzo — helping to develop
the institute and deciding how to dis
tribute funds.
In response to this. Berg said it is
only logical for leading scientists to
be involved in the decision-making
process.
"You have to ask yourself who
are the insiders," he said. "The in
siders are the leading stem cell biol
ogists in the world, and the institu
tions that are going to benefit from it
are institutions that are doing the
most promising research and where
these world leading scientists
work."
Berg added that there is enough
money budgeted to fund almost all
of the leading scientists in the state,
and if Stanford were to get a dispro

portionate share of the funding, it
would only be because of the quality
of the research being done.
"There's no secret agreement
that Stanford will get so much. Cal
Tech so much — it's going to be
going out on the basis of merit: who's
doing good science, who's getting
good leads, who's ultimately the one
most likely to develop the kinds of
cures the citizens of California voted
for,"he said.
Another misconception, accord
ing to Berg, is that insiders will prof
it from patenting discoveries made.
He said that any discoveries made
using state funds will presumably be
patented by the state and that profit
ing from stem cell research is far
down the road anyway.
"I can guarantee you, if you look
at how long it takes to develop a
therapy or a drug, and then to get a
patent, and then to license it and
then for that company to develop it
into a commercial thing, it's going to
be years and years before there's any
money that comes back," Berg said.
"The benefits that will come will be
from discoveries that will be imme
diately applicable to treating pa
tients. To get money out of discover
ies is a very long process."
Many other states and universi
ties are also taking steps to regulate
stem cell research and its funding.
Some states have restricted by pro
hibiting nuclear transfer research,
and some states — such as New Jer
sey — have pledged to fund stem
cell research like California. Addi
tionally, Harvard University has
pledged to raise $100 million dollars
for stem cell research.
"It's not to be conceivable that
the rest of the leading universities in
the country are going to sit idly by
and say. Well, we'll let all the stem
cell research go on in California,'
without a light," Berg said. "But, I
think none of the states has come
close or can come close to the kind of
activity that is going to uo on here."

Stanford to
take lead role
Editor's note: This article is the first of
two examining stem cell research.
Today's article discusses how Stanford
will be affected by the passage of Propo
sition 71. Tomorrow's article will discuss
how Stanford professors are playing a
role in the national and state debates
about stem cell research.
While stem cell researchers across
the country seeking federal funding face
an increasing number of hurdles, Stan
ford and other California institutions
could receive state funding that will ex
ceed any federal funding for stem cell re
search. Already a leader in stem cell re
search, Stanford is likely to receive
grants from the California Institute for
Regenerative Medicine, formed after
the passage of Proposition 71 last No
vember. The result, prominent scientists
on campus said, is expected to bring
about advances in medical therapies
that will benefit both Stanford and the
state.
"Stanford will get money [from the
California Institute] because it houses a
terrific collection of people who are
doing absolutely cutting-edge research
in stem cell biology and trying to apply
that research to disease," said Biochem
istry Emeritus Prof. Paul Berg, a Nobel
laureate and prominent supporter of
stem cell research. "There isn't any
place better suited. [The money is] not
going to go to Harvard, it's not going to
St. Louis or Dallas, it's going to be done
in California."
Money from the new state institute,
which will be financed with $3 billion
and up to $350 million a year instate
bonds for the next decade, will support
Stanford's Institute for Cancer /Stem
Cell Biology and Medicine with essen
tial financing.
"We are fundraising to develop
enough money to develop this research
and give it up a kick start," said Patholo
gy Prof. Irving Weissman, the stem cell
institute's director.
Stanford started its stem cell institute
in 2002 after receiving a private dona
tion of $12 million from an anonymous
donor. The institute is interdisciplinary
and includes both basic scientific and
clinical research.
Weissman said the institute plans to
build a facility at the medical school that
will house comprehensive cancer and
stem cell research. He said there will
need to be temporary facilities in place
by this fall and that more permanent de
velopments will probably take place
over the next four years.

Weissman said that stem cell re
search and cancer research are not unre
lated. One of the goals of the institute,
he said, is to refocus cancer research
from the entire cancer to just its stem
cells, which are capable of moving
through the blood stream and replicat
ing throughout the body.
Weissman said he hopes to use state
funding not only for facilities, but also to
recruit new researchers and clinicians.
He said he is especially looking for re
searchers who could find stem cells for
different types of cancer.
"We already have a few people who
are excellent at working with adult type
stem cells," Weissman said. "We hope
to recruit others working with human
embryonic stem cells."
Weissman said one of the institute's
goals is creating new human stem cell
lines through nuclear transfer.
So far. the process — which entails
replacing the genetic information in an
embryo in order to replicate a certain
person's stem cells — has only been
done in South Korea. It is a controver
sial process, yet one Weissman called
"extremely important."
"Our objective is to take stem cells
(from) someone with a disease like Juve
nile Diabetes and use the genetic infor
mation to make a cell line to understand
how the genes you inherent cause the
diseases," he said. "That's a long-term
goal, and it's certainly one that we could
not fund with federal funds."
Dr. Philip Pizzo, dean of the medical
school, is one of the 29 people who will
be deciding just where the state funds
go. Pizzo was the first person named to
sit on the Independent Citizens Over
sight Committee, the state institute's
governing board. He said he hopes Stan
ford's research agenda will be broad.
"The obvious focus areas will be appli
cations to the study and treatment of
cancer, neurological disorders, diabetes,
cardiovascular disorders, organ trans
plantation among others," he wrote in
an e-mail to The Daily.
