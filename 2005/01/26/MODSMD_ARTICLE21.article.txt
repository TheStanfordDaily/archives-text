## Lackluster teams give Cardinal break in schedule NCAA singles champ Liu continues her late reappearance trend 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
Between last week's craze of individual
tournaments and next week's Team In
doors competition in Madison. Wise., the
No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team (1-0)
will enjoy some downtime doing what the
defending national champion squad does
best:
Winning. In this case, shutting down two
opponents who offer the Cardinal little more
than practice time.
Two Big West Conference schools, Davis
(0-1) and Cal Poly (1 -3), come toTaube Fam

ily Tennis Stadium this Thursday and Friday
to try their luck against a team that holds a
record 13 NCAA titles and 17 Pacific 10 Con
ference titles.
Davis and Cal Poly usually compete in
an 11-team league in which only five teams
enjoy a national ranking. Cal Poly leads
the way at No. 56, 10 slots ahead of Pac-10
straggler No. 66 Washington State.
No. 12 Alice Barnes (5-5), a junior, has al
ready begun remedying her mixed singles re
sults from the fall. Barnes made it to the
quarterfinals at the Pac-10 Indoors Tourna
ment, losing a tough three-setter to Southern
California's No. 29 Lindsey Nelson, 5-7, 6-3,
6-1.
Nelson, a freshman, quickly established
herself in the rankings and boasts a 13-5
record. At Indoors, she dropped a re
spectable 6-4, 6-2 semifinal match to No. 13
Dea Sumantri, Washington's most seasoned
player.

No. 22 senior Erin Burdette (9-2) is gain
ing momentum after clinching both the sin
gles and doubles titles at Indoors last week.
Burdette downed Sumantri in the final, 6-3,
2-6, 6-2, in a show of maturity and determi
nation.
Meanwhile, two-time NCAA Singles
champion Amber Liu (1 -0), is making anoth
er fashionably late reappearance onto the
collegiate scene.
The junior's opting for professional tour
naments in the fall has become something of
an annual tradition.
"She's just this ridiculous competitor,"
said Stanford assistant coach Frankie Bren
nan. "We still have her, thankfully."
Playing at No. 1 singles, Liu allowed
Hawaii's Lauren Fitzgerald just four games
in the defending champion's first match of
the season.
No. 94 Fitzgerald added the 6-1,6-3 loss to
her current 4-5 record.

That said, expect the Aggies to go home
without much of a fight. Davis has seen bet
ter days, closing at No. 25 in 2004, continuing
its steady decline from a record No. 7 in
November of 2000.
Davis has since landed in an unranked
abyss, posting a team total of 14 games —
none in doubles — against No. 38 Arizona
State (1-0) on Saturday.
Cal Poly, on the other hand, shows more
promise. Competing in the No. 1 singles
position, senior Noelle Lee holds a 7-4
record.
Last week, Lee pulled her weight in Pac
-10 matches against California and the
Women of Troy, defeating Cal's Cristina
Visico, 6-3,2-6 (11-9). Southern California's
No. 70 Dianne Matias got the best of her in
another three-setter, 4-6,6-1,6-1.
Match play against Davis begins tomor
row and Cal Poly takes the court on Friday.
Both matches start at 1:30 p.m.

6-1.
Nelson, a freshman, quickly established
herself in the rankings and boasts a 13-5
record. At Indoors, she dropped a re
spectable 6-4, 6-2 semifinal match to No. 13
Dea Sumantri, Washington's most seasoned
player.

No. 22 senior Erin Burdette (9-2) is gain
ing momentum after clinching both the sin
gles and doubles titles at Indoors last week.
Burdette downed Sumantri in the final, 6-3,
2-6, 6-2, in a show of maturity and determi
nation.
Meanwhile, two-time NCAA Singles
champion Amber Liu (1 -0), is making anoth
er fashionably late reappearance onto the
collegiate scene.
The junior's opting for professional tour
naments in the fall has become something of
an annual tradition.
"She's just this ridiculous competitor,"
said Stanford assistant coach Frankie Bren
nan. "We still have her, thankfully."
Playing at No. 1 singles, Liu allowed
Hawaii's Lauren Fitzgerald just four games
in the defending champion's first match of
the season.
No. 94 Fitzgerald added the 6-1,6-3 loss to
her current 4-5 record.

That said, expect the Aggies to go home
without much of a fight. Davis has seen bet
ter days, closing at No. 25 in 2004, continuing
its steady decline from a record No. 7 in
November of 2000.
Davis has since landed in an unranked
abyss, posting a team total of 14 games —
none in doubles — against No. 38 Arizona
State (1-0) on Saturday.
Cal Poly, on the other hand, shows more
promise. Competing in the No. 1 singles
position, senior Noelle Lee holds a 7-4
record.
Last week, Lee pulled her weight in Pac
-10 matches against California and the
Women of Troy, defeating Cal's Cristina
Visico, 6-3,2-6 (11-9). Southern California's
No. 70 Dianne Matias got the best of her in
another three-setter, 4-6,6-1,6-1.
Match play against Davis begins tomor
row and Cal Poly takes the court on Friday.
Both matches start at 1:30 p.m.

No. 12 Alice Barnes will look to improve on
her fail season. The junior is 5-5 on the year.
