# Right in the Babymaker
## This patch of Moss has long since decayed 
### 
Randy Moss is a bad football player.
There, I said it. Yes, he has the most
receiving yards of any player over
the first seven years of his career.
Yes. he scored 13 touchdowns this year and
made a couple of big plays in the Vikings' play-

off victory in Green Bay. Yes,
he's an electrifying playmaker
who has the capacity to take
over a game.
These will all be things the
Vikings emphasize when they
put him on the trading block
this spring.
Needless to say, though,
there is more to being a good
football player than statistics.

Specifically, there is the small
matter of helping your team, at which Moss is
worse than he is at appealing to Middle Ameri
ca. Randy Moss is a spectacular wide receiver,
but if you judge a football player's worth as a
function of how much he contributes to his
team's ability to win championships, I would
rather have one Mines Ward than 10 Mosses.
In terms of his overall contribution to a
team. Moss is horrific. If Barry Bonds is a club
house cancer. Moss is flesh-eating bacteria. He
projects a public image of ignorance and lazi
ness, he's personally irresponsible, and he
doesn't seem to care about winning football
games.
He's also not even interesting. His fake
mooning of the Green Bay crowd two weeks
ago wouldn't have even registered had Joe
Buck not put on his Jerry Falwell mask and
feigned righteous outrage, as if a Fox anchor ex
pounding on appropriateness isn't more hypo
critical than Shawn Kemp promoting condom
usage.
Now. I'm all for the freedom of expression
on the football field. Unless you're bringing
Bengal tigers into the endzone and riding them
around like Siegfried and Roy. knock yourself
out.
But know that there is a very particular reac
tion. both in the American living room and
around the league, which comes from endzone
celebrations. It's why Barry Sanders was one of
the most beloved players in NFL history, and
why everyone likes Randy Moss less than a
Hefty bag of rancid vomit.

You have to wonder what's going
through the heads of the Minnesota
offensive line when they see a team
mate distancing himself from their
work, making the offense all about
him and antagonizing opposing fans.
Behind closed doors, I bet there are
more complex sentiments than
"That's just Randy being Randy."
It would also be easier to forgive
Moss his antics if they weren't appar
ently such a close representation of
his off-the-field persona. He has con
tinually expressed an unwillingness
to be a team player, going so far as to
demand that 40 percent of all offen
sive plays go through him (a conces
sion agreed to by Vikings coach
Mike Tice).
Aside from the fact that this
makes Tice and the rest of the
Vikings staff look more impotent
than Bob Dole, it paints Moss as a
selfish crybaby whose perception of
his own role on the team is far re
moved from any collective goal. Fur
thermore, Moss has had repeated
run-ins with the law, intentionally
bumping a traffic officer with his car
in downtown Minneapolis and ver
bally abusing corporate sponsors of
the Vikings.
When Moss left the field with two
seconds left in the Vikings' regular
season-ending loss to Washington,
he probably didn't hurt Minnesota's

chances of winning the game. None
of the penalties or ludicrously pid
dling fines he accrued from end/one
celebrations really hurt either.
That's really not what matters,
though, otherwise Moss wouldn't he
up for grabs. The image put forth by
the action, rather than the action it
self. is what says something. It seems
that even Minnesota has tired of his
act, and he'll probably be making
"highlights" in another uniform
come next fall.
Of course, next year's campaign
will probably involve similar statis
tics to this season, bolstered by the
fact that the other receivers on his
team will have a subpar season. This
will be due, of course, to the relent
less infighting that Moss will pro
voke, in addition to Moss tipping off
when plays are going to other re
ceivers by not making an attempt to
block or jog more than three steps
from the line of scrimmage. I'm sure
it won't matter to him either, when
whatever team he plays for ends up
not making the playoffs.
Randy Moss may be a great guy in
person. What matters to the public
and to his teammates, though, is that
he presents himself as a self-serving
player who would rather wave his ass
at opposing fans after scoring in a 45-
7 loss than sacrifice his own role to
win a Super Howl.

The sad thing is that right now I'd
say Moss wishes he could he Terrell
Owens, a guy who has backed up his
on-field bravado with stellar play this
season. While Owens is brash in the
clubhouse too, at least he hustles and
doesn't run over traffic cops. It
would make me happy to think of
Moss sulking at home, watching
Owens struggle to return from injury
for the Super Bowl, when Moss
couldn't carry Owens' jock in terms
of pure performance. But even that's
probably not the case, as everything
that Randy Moss does indicates that
he is less interested in winning than
he is in being an asshole.
Since the $10 grand that the
league fined him obviously "ain't
nothing" to Moss, maybe he can use
the rest of his $5.75 million salary to
buy something that he'll never get
otherwise â€” respect. As long as he
continues his routine, he'd better be
comfortable with his growing legacy
as a guy who will hurt whatever team
he plays for, breed internal dissent
and turn fans against the team.
Enjoy your winter. Randy. The
list of people who will put up with
you is a little shorter, and your new
teammates will be waiting with
sharpened knives.
