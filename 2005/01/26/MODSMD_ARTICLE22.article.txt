# Right in the Babymaker
## This patch of Moss has long since decayed 
### 
Randy Moss is a bad football player.
There, I said it. Yes, he has the most
receiving yards of any player over
the first seven years of his career.
Yes. he scored 13 touchdowns this year and
made a couple of big plays in the Vikings' play-

off victory in Green Bay. Yes,
he's an electrifying playmaker
who has the capacity to take
over a game.
These will all be things the
Vikings emphasize when they
put him on the trading block
this spring.
Needless to say, though,
there is more to being a good
football player than statistics.

Specifically, there is the small
matter of helping your team, at which Moss is
worse than he is at appealing to Middle Ameri
ca. Randy Moss is a spectacular wide receiver,
but if you judge a football player's worth as a
function of how much he contributes to his
team's ability to win championships, I would
rather have one Mines Ward than 10 Mosses.
In terms of his overall contribution to a
team. Moss is horrific. If Barry Bonds is a club
house cancer. Moss is flesh-eating bacteria. He
projects a public image of ignorance and lazi
ness, he's personally irresponsible, and he
doesn't seem to care about winning football
games.
He's also not even interesting. His fake
mooning of the Green Bay crowd two weeks
ago wouldn't have even registered had Joe
Buck not put on his Jerry Falwell mask and
feigned righteous outrage, as if a Fox anchor ex
pounding on appropriateness isn't more hypo
critical than Shawn Kemp promoting condom
usage.
Now. I'm all for the freedom of expression
on the football field. Unless you're bringing
Bengal tigers into the endzone and riding them
around like Siegfried and Roy. knock yourself
out.
But know that there is a very particular reac
tion. both in the American living room and
around the league, which comes from endzone
celebrations. It's why Barry Sanders was one of
the most beloved players in NFL history, and
why everyone likes Randy Moss less than a
Hefty bag of rancid vomit.
