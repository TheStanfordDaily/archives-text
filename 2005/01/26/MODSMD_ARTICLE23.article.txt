The calendar has seen two months, six dual-meets and
three open tournaments go by since Burnham Pavilion last
rolled out the mats. Nevertheless, wrestling fans on the Farm
will still need to wait one more week fora home dual meet.
The Stanford wrestlers (4-4. 0-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
have been on an extended road schedule since Nov. 23, and
there is still one major roadblock before they return home on
Feb. 4. The Cardinal will trek up through Oregon this week
end to face Pac-10 foes Oregon (4-5.1 -3). Oregon State (9-4,
4-0) and Portland State (12-0.0-4).
The practice week will be exceptionally brief, with
practices running through Wednesday, putting time at a
premium.
"We have a very short time to prepare, so instead of fo
cusing on what these teams do and don't do well, we will focus
on our own preparation," said head coach Steve Buddie.
"For us. that means continuing to build our conditioning, our
mental toughness and our ability to adjust to our opponent's
stvle within a match itself."
