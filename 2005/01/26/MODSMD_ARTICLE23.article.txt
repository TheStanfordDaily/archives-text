# Busy week cuts time, practice short
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The calendar has seen two months, six dual-meets and
three open tournaments go by since Burnham Pavilion last
rolled out the mats. Nevertheless, wrestling fans on the Farm
will still need to wait one more week fora home dual meet.
The Stanford wrestlers (4-4. 0-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
have been on an extended road schedule since Nov. 23, and
there is still one major roadblock before they return home on
Feb. 4. The Cardinal will trek up through Oregon this week
end to face Pac-10 foes Oregon (4-5.1 -3). Oregon State (9-4,
4-0) and Portland State (12-0.0-4).
The practice week will be exceptionally brief, with
practices running through Wednesday, putting time at a
premium.
"We have a very short time to prepare, so instead of fo
cusing on what these teams do and don't do well, we will focus
on our own preparation," said head coach Steve Buddie.
"For us. that means continuing to build our conditioning, our
mental toughness and our ability to adjust to our opponent's
stvle within a match itself."

Heading to Oregon fora three-city tour is junior
Imad Kharbush. The wrestling squad finishes up
its road trip against a flailing Portland team.
Stanford faces the most hectic
travel day on Friday. The Cardinal
wrestle the Beavers in Corvallis at 2
p.m and then drive 48 miles to Eu
gene fora 7 p.m. dual against the
Ducks.
In the final test of the weekend,
Stanford will face the Vikings in
Portland on Saturday at 1 p.m. Stay
ing fresh will be essential to the Car
dinal's success; this past weekend,
travel took a toll on the team and was
a factor in a 29-12 beat-down by No.
23( SU-Bakersfield. Regardless, the
coaching staff won't use the schedule
as an excuse, and it plans to win.
"With this being our last road trip
before Pac-lOs, I'd like for the team
to be able to put forth a very strong
effort," Buddie said. "Traveling is
never easy, but it's very much a part
of every varsity sport and can be a
very fun, bonding part of team unity.
I'd have to say that within this trip,
closing out strong against Portland is
very important."
The toughest opponent for Stan
ford on paper may be Oregon State.
The Beavers are coming off a 29-9
win over Bakersfield. Oregon State's
two most impressive performers this
year have been senior co-captain and
defending Pac-10 champion at 165-
pounds Matt Ellis and sophomore
heavyweight Ty Watterson. Ellis,

who transferred from Oklahoma
State after his freshman year, has yet
to lose in a dual-meet this season.
Watterson leads the team with 15
wins, and the sophomore has only
lost one match thus far.
"Oregon and Oregon State have
very strong histories, and they've
gotten the best of us over the years,"
Buddie said. "In fact, last year was
the first ever that we'd ever beaten
Oregon State."
Oregon will also challenge a trav
el-weary Stanford. The Ducks fin
ished fourth in the Tournament of
Champions in Reno, Nev. earlier this
season, while the Cardinal finished
eighth.
Oregon's star wrestler is senior
197-pound/heavyweight Scott Bark
er. Barker has gone 23-4 on the sea
son with a trip to the semifinals of the
Midlands Invitational tournament.
Oregon got its elusive first confer
ence win in a tight 25-23 contest
against Boise State on Jan. 14.
"Even though both of these
teams seem to get especially riled up
to beat us every year, this year will be
even more so as we defeated both
teams last season," Buddie said.
"Both teams always wrestle tough in
their home gyms, and I would expect
both teams to be especially aggres
sive. With conference seeds on the

line, everyone will be in a dogfight."
Portland State, however has had a
very unsuccessful season so far. The
team is still winless and has been shut
out often, but the Stanford coaching
staff refuses to overlook it and insists
it could be a sleeper. Portland's
strongest performer has been 149-
pound senior Eddie Dahlen, who
leads the team in almost all relevant
categories including total wins (16)
and pins (five).
"Portland State is lagging a bit be
hind the rest of the conference, but
they can't be taken lightly." Buddie
said. "The kids who wrestle for Port
land State do it for the pure love of
the sport, and they can be tena
cious."
Throughout this interminable
road trip, the team has always had a
consistent message, and it will not
change in the final weekend.
According to coach Buddie, it will
be a successful weekend if the Cardi
nal wrestle to their own potential.
"If that happens, we will win three
dual-meets." Buddie said. "I can't lie
and say that beating all three teams
wouldn't be a boost."
A 3-0 weekend would be a nice
close to a Stanford roadtrip that has
stretched across nine cities. And it
would be a welcome stat to look at
before coming home.
