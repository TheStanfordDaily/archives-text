# Seniors await SoCal meets
## Coach confident of Card's chances against Trojan Olympians 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the final home meet of their colle
giate careers, the No. 8 Stanford senior
swimmers will look to continue their pur
suit of an elusive national championship.
The Cardinal's last championship came in
2002, when the seniors were freshmen,
and finishes at nationals have been disap
pointing since then.
This year's team is in a strong position
to make a bid for the title. With an experi
enced core and a talented group of young
sters, Stanford has shown itself as one of
the most balanced and fiercest squads.
"The way the team has been practicing
is incredible compared to past years," se
nior Amy Wagner said. "The girls drive
for it more. They come in willing to do
amazing things and do everything Richard
[Quick] asks, and they do it with a lot of
heart. These girls just want it more than
teams in the past."
As the team prepares to send off nine
seniors, the focus this weekend will be on
honoring the veterans. In front of family
and friends, the Cardinal will take on No.
10 UCLA on Friday and No. 17 Southern
California on Saturday.
"It's going to be really special because
it will be parents' weekend for us," head
coach Quick said. "A large percentage of
the women on the team will have parents
there to watch."
The team is looking forward to a sup
portive home crowd to boost it over the
competition, teams which are very much
in the running as the regional and nation
al championships approach.
"It's going to be exciting," Wagner
said. "Being home in front of all our fans,
it should be more rowdy, and we can feed
off of that. I think we will do really well."
"We will be very ready for both
meets," said senior Kirsten Gilbert. "And
we hope to get lots of fans out. We're es
pecially going to go for UCLA, who really
snuck out of nowhere to beat us last sea
son."
The opponents this weekend should
not pose as large a threat as No. 5 Arizona
(whom Stanford beat by 30 points in Tuc
son last Saturday,) but both have the tal
ent and depth to challenge the Cardinal.

Last season, UCLA handed the third
ranked Cardinal their first loss of the sea
son, a 151-92 domination. In 24 meetings,
it was only the Bruins' second victory.
The UCLA squad has many talented
swimmers and will be a difficult opponent,
but Stanford received a large boost of con
fidence with the upset over Arizona. USC
has several athletes with experience in in
ternational competition, but the Trojans
do not have as many consistent contribu
tors as UCLA or Stanford.
Sizing up the competition. Quick is
confident in his squad's chances.
"USC has some excellent individual
swimmers," he said. "To my knowledge,
they have three Olympians: a diver from
Mexico, Kalyn Keller — who was in the
Olympics in the 800-meter freestyle —
and Rhi Jeffrey, who swam on the 800-
meter relay team. They have good indi
viduals, but their biggest problem is a lack

of depth and team balance. I believe that
we should, if we swim well, do pretty
well."
The last time the Cardinal were in the
pool with the Trojans was in a three-way
meet in Texas. Keller, defending national
champion in the mile, was a winner in the
1650-yard freestyle, Jeffrey took first in
the 200-yard freestyle, and freshman
Emily Goetsch brought home the only
other individual victory in the 200-yard
fly.
The 400-yard USC freestyle relay team
also won. but the Trojans still fell to the
Texas Longhorns. The Stanford-USC
score was not kept, but Stanford also came
up short against Texas, albeit by a much
smaller margin.
With the depth of talent in all strokes
for the Cardinal, USC should not pose too
great a threat.
"UCLA, on the other hand, they have

a little more depth and balance [than
USC]," Quick said. "So they'll be a hard
er team for us to beat. If we compete well
though, we should have a good chance of
sweeping the weekend."
The UCLA roster is headlined by ju
nior Kim Vandenberg who is currently
ranked third in the country in the 200-
meter butterfly, an event in which she
placed fifth at the US Olympic Trials.
In head-to-head competition so far
this season. UCLA has recorded victories
over Oregon State, UC-Santa Barbara.
San Diego, Arizona State, and UC-San
Diego.
Its only dual-meet loss came against
Arizona in November and was decided by
a single point.
The Cardinal will take on UCLA at 1
p.m. on Friday and USC at noon on Satur
day. Both meets are in the Avery Aquatic
Center.
