# Volleyball comes home to Matadors

### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tomorrow evening, the men's volleyball team will
host No. 6 CSU-Northridge (3-4, 1-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation), marking the Cardinal's first home
game in over a week. But coming home might not he as
advantageous as it's cut out to be: Stanford (3-4, 2-2
MPSF) will face a team similar to the one that handed
the Cardinal their first home loss of the year.
Thursday night won't be the first time that Stanford
has seen Northridge this season, though. The two teams
met at the UC-Santa Barbara tournament on Jan. 7,
where the No. 9 Cardinal fell in four games, 1-3.
In that match, junior Ben Reddy led the team with 17
kills, racking up 21 points for the Cardinal. However,
the team will most likely have to go without Reddy in
this rematch, as he has been out for two games with a
knee injury. The Cardinal will also probably be missing
sophomore Josh Schwarzapel, out with a back injury,
and junior Nick Manov, sidelined with a sore shoulder.
"We're not sure of the availability of the injured
players," Shaw said. "Probably very limited action, if at
all."
In comparison, the Matador bench remains strong,
which will pose a significant threat to the Cardinal.
"They are a deep, well-coached team capable of
bringing in quality players off the bench who can give
them a lift if their starters falter," Shaw said.

Last week, CSUN suffered back-to-back losses
against No. 4 Hawaii. But the Matadors have a chance
to rebuild some confidence tonight in a match against
No. 9 Pacific before coming to Stanford tomorrow.
The Cardinal are also looking for opportunities to
build their own self-assurance.
"We need to win matches against teams ranked
ahead of us, both to enhance our playoff chances and for
our confidence," Shaw said.
While Stanford played strongly in its last match,
shutting out UC-San Diego 3-0, this is no guarantee that
it is ready to take on a higher-ranked team. UCSD is the
only Division II team in the MPSF. and a Stanford vic
tory on Friday was almost obligatory.
Coming off almost a full week of rest, the Cardinal
will need to be ready to play hard against the Matadors.
"Having played [CSUN] at the Santa Barbara tour
nament, we know they are a big, physical team, similar
to Pepperdme," Shaw said.
That does not bode well for the Cardinal, as their last
home competition was a 1-3 loss against the No. 3
Waves. Stanford came out strong in that match but fell
apart in the fourth game, handing the victory to Pepper
dine. The Cardinal will need to show more consistency
in their level of play if they are to defeat higher-ranked
rivals like Northridge.
"We'll have to deal with their blocking as well as slow
down their middle hitters better than we did the last
time," Shaw said.
