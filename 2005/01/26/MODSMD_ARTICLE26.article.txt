## 'A New Hero Every Night' 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Cardinal baseball in 2(H)4 wouldn't have been quite
the same without Jed Lowrie's stop-you-in-your
tracks season. Without Brian Hall's breakout year, or
Danny Putnam's power-hitting eruption. Without Jeff
Gilmore's all-of-a-sudden poise on the mound.
Each year the Stanford baseball team loses key
pieces of its national contender puzzle, and each year,
someone emerges from nowhere to fill the void and
keep the squad's eyes fixed on Omaha. Neb.
According to coach Mark Marquess, who this
season embarks on his 29th year at the head of the
program, the key to making up the ground lost after
the departure of nine valuable 2004 players is sim
ple. First, the team's veterans must fly out of the
dugout with the intention of having career years.
And second?
"It we're still talking here in June," Marquess said,
"it means Lowrie had a good year, Mayberry had a
good year. And then we have a surprise. We need a
Jed Lowrie. We need a freshman position player who
doesn't play like a freshman.
"We need a pleasant surprise."
It seems like a precarious entity to depend upon,
but miracles have happened pretty regularly over the
years at Sunken Diamond. And if there is a pleasant
surprise or two on this year's staff, the intrasquad com
petition, the demanding conference schedule and the
desire to live up to the Cardinal legacy will certainly
bring them to surface.
"That's the joy of playing with this team," Lowrie
said. "There's a new hero every night."
The strength of the team:
THE PITCHING STAFF
While last year's pitching squad, as a result of youth
and relative inexperience, occasionally gave the team
a shock, this season's hurlers will likely be the strength
of the Stanford squad. The staff lost four relievers
from last season; closer David O'Hagan, Mark Jecman
and Drew Ehrlich were chosen in last year's draft,
while junior reliever Kodiak Quick transferred to
Kansas.
What remains is a proven starting rotation head
lined by junior ace Mark Romanczuk, a preseason Ail-
American and a two-time Team USA selection. The
lefthander, who was 11-3 with a 4.31 ERA as a Friday
night starter in 2004, will be relied upon to lead the
pitching staff on and off the field.
"Getting accustomed to facing the other team's ace
was the hardest thing." Romanczuk said. "But this
year 1 have two years under my belt, and I think I'm
ready to go. I know the ropes."
Stanford will keep last year's Saturday starter in
that spot: Junior Jeff Gilmore, while lacking Ro
manczuk s outright power, threw nearly as many in
nings in 2(X)4. tossed one of the squad's two complete
games and compiled a 10-2 record.
The Cardinal's last slot in the starting rotation,
however, is the one that really makes a statement.
The reason? Sophomores Greg Reynolds, Blake
Holler and Matt Leva, and freshmen Nolan Gallagher
and Erik Davis.
The sophomore trio spent 2004 proving itself,
combining for 21 starts and a 14-5 record. Reynolds,
a 6-foot-7 tower of a righty, fought an arm injury for
much of last season, but pitched very well in the fall.

Southpaw Holler threw more than any freshman
last year (58 innings), including a series of success
ful Sunday starts against some challenging portions
of the Cardinal's schedule. Leva pitched a decent
2004 that became sterling when he threw the first
complete game of his career to win a key game in
last year's Regionals.
Davis and Gallagher arrived on the Farm as highly
regarded recruits and impressed coaches and players
alike with their performances in fall workouts.
Though Reynolds and Holler appear to be the front
runners for the third starting job — Romanczuk be
lieves that both are "primed for great years" —the

competition for time on the mound will likely he stiff
for most of the season.
"There are arms on the staff that could take Gilly
and Romy out of [the rotation]," Marquess said.
"Holler. Leva. Reynolds, Gallagher, Davis, Manship.
Their stuff is as good as Gilly's and Romy's. Of course,
experience and coming with the big pitch at the right
time is something different."
The departure of O'Hagan was likely the hardest
hit that the pitching staff took, hut junior Matt Man
ship and sophomore Jeff Stimpson will vie to shut
the door for the Cardinal this year. The duo com
bined for 41 appearances and four saves last season.
"In my few years, this is the deepest the staff has
ever been," Romanczuk said. "I think the coaches are
very confident in a lot of pitchers. If we can rely on 11.
12.13 pitchers to go out on the mound, we're going to
win some games."

Experience and its opposite collide:
THE DEFENSE
The defense that backs the Stanford pitchers is a
blend of veteran reliability, rookie uncertainty and the
ever-present hope fora breakout.
The right side of the infield holds the most security
for the Cardinal, as junior Jed Lowrie is a lock to re
turn at second base and John Mayberry. Jr., who paced
last year's starters with a .995 fielding percentage, will
man first base once again.
Junior Chris Minaker, who played shortstop for
much of last year, will return to the position, while

sophomore Adam Sorgi will likely start at third, the
position vacated by Jonny Ash.
"Our infield is basically intact," Marquess said.
"And Sorgi is a good defensive third baseman. He's
used to short, but he's made the adjustment well."
Junior John Hester will get the starting job behind
the plate after two seasons of waiting behind Ryan
Garko and Donny Lucy. Catcher has historically been
one of Stanford's deepest positions, and the fact that
Marquess does not expect a drop in defensive effec
tiveness speaks volumes of the skill Hester showed in
his first two campaigns.
The Stanford regiment with the most question
marks dangling from it is the Cardinal outfield. Last
year's triumvirate of Danny Putnam. Brian Hall and
Sam Fuld was steadfast, and it was accordingly

Stanford lost nine irreplaceable players after last season, giving the 2005 squad a challenge to face when play opens
against Fresno State this weekend at Sunken Diamond. But for now, the Cardinal are smiling,
