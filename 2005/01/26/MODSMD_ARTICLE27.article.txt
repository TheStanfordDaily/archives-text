# Possible Cardinal keys to the 2005 season John Hester, C, junior
## 
### 
There is no ques
tion that Hester's
defensive skills
are on par with
those of his pre
decessors. Donny
Lucy and Ryan
Garko. The ques
tion remains: Will
he be able to
match the offen
sive power of his
two mentors?
Strong fall work
outs indicate that
2005 could be the
year. Hester hit

.265 last season in his 1 uesday starts, collecting
seven RBI along the way.
Greg Reynolds, RHP, sophomore

Reynolds' 2004
numbers aren't
stellar (4-1
record and an
ERA of 6.00 in
27.0 innings
pitched.) But
Stanford fans
have yet to see
him in top form
— his arm injury
prevented him
from contribut
ing for much of
the season. This
year he has
pitched well

enough to he a strong contender for the Cardi
nal's third spot in the starting rotation, and just
might be the breakout Marquess is looking for.
Chris Lewis, OF, junior

Despite limited
playing time in his
first two college
campaigns. Lewis
is one of the
team's most ver
satile position
players and will
start the year in
left field. Offen
sively his coaches
are hoping he can
provide some of
the bang needed
to jumpstart am
inexperienced

r
lineup. He led all non-starters last season with four
home runs.
