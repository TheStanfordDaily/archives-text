## Stanford baseball's field general 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Not many clubs on thefacebook.com
have three times as many groupies as
members, but if you read the vague.
Navy SEAL-esque description of
Rappy's Crew — "an elite group of indi
viduals capable of performing any task"
— they would seem to be deserving of
the recognition.
"We do miscellaneous odd jobs,
like bringing the batting practice
screens in, setting up the cages, picking
up balls, bringing out tarps and weigh
ing them down," said sophomore fore
man Jim Rapoport, who doubles as
Stanford's centerfielder.
"It all started one day when Nine
[the uniform number of head coach
Mark Marquess] called for Rappy and
his crew' after practice," said sopho
more outfielder Ryan Kissick. "Now,
anytime Nine needs anything, we're
there."
The Crew is only part of the base
ball team's Sunken Diamond mainte
nance program — all of the players
clean and rake the field after every
practice and game — but with all three
outfield positions opening up this year
after the departures of Sam Fuld,
Danny Putnam and Brian Hall,
Rappy's Crew will also play an integral
role on the field. It is only fitting that
Rapoport will lead the group during
games as well as after them.
He will take over for departed se
nior Fuld in center, and their playing
styles bear a strong resemblance to
each other. Rapoport — who, like
Fuld, bats and throws left-handed —
is a smart defender, and his speed
makes him dangerous once he gets on
base.
"He's the fastest guy on the team,"
Marquess said. "He takes the right
angles on fly balls, and he's our lead
ing base-stealing threat. At the plate,
if he makes good contact, he's going
to get on."
When Rapoport puts the ball in
play, good things seem to happen, and
he capitalizes on this phenomenon by
utilizing a drag bunt and a push bunt.
But when he needs to, Rapoport can
switch on the power. In this respect,
his versatility lives up to the descrip
tion of his Crew.
"He has very good bat speed and
deceptive power fora guy who doesn't
look that big," Kissick said. "The ball
just jumps off his bat."
Rapoport arrived at the Farm as a

highly touted prospect and one of the
best centerfieiders in Southern Cali
fornia, if not the country. He was
picked in the first-year player draft hut
turned down an offer to play in the
Cleveland Indians' system.
He can only hope to wreak as much
havcx: on opposing defenses as he did at
Chaminade, his LA-area high school, as
Kissick, who played for league rival
Harvard Westlake, can testify.
"I just remember he was so fast," he
said. "He'd get on if he hit a ball to the
shortstop. He stole second base every
time, and most of the time he stole
third, too."
College catchers are not quite as
forgiving as high school receivers, and
Rapoport will not have the green light
with the likes of Jed Lowrie and John
Mayberry, Jr. hitting behind him. He
stole only one base last year, but when
the team needs a runner in scoring po
sition in a close game, chances are
Rapoport will be allowed to run at will.
He hit .250 and scored 10 runs in 60 at
bats while backing up Fuld last season,
practicing beside the former All-
American every day. Rapoport credits
Fuld with helping to ease his transition
from high school to college ball.
"He was always right over my
shoulder." he said. "I learned a lot
from his fielding mechanics, his jump
and his overall game. His presence was
tutelage in itself."
In his managerial position with the
Crew. Rapoport might have a similar
effect on his fellow outfielders. He will
likely be flanked at the beginning of
the season by freshman Michael Tay
lor in right field and junior Chris
Lewis, a converted infielder, in left.
"I think he's pretty confident out
there," said junior pitcher Matt Man
ship, Rapoport's roommate and an
honorary member of Rappy's Crew.
"He's pretty low-key in the room, but
I think he saves it for the field."
"We take a lot of pride in working
together," Rapoport says, and pretty
soon it becomes evident that he's talk
ing about the Crew's field mainte
nance work. "We take a lot of pride
here in the total game of baseball, in
everything you do on the field. It
brings us together."
You get the feeling that Rappy's
Crew takes as much pride in doing odd
jobs after games as it does in its perfor
mance during them. But when you are
entrusted with replacing Putnam, Fuld
and Hall — all of whom were drafted
in the first 10 rounds last season — it

can be nice to have a built-in support
system. For Rapoport. that comes
from the whole team.
"We are careful not to expect too
much of him," Marquess said. "He's a
freshman in terms of playing experi
ence, but at Stanford there's a huge
leap in confidence from your freshman
to your sophomore year, and most of
that happens off the field. He's settled
in. He knows what to expect."

The only difference is that
Rapoport now has the authority to call
off the outfielders beside him on a fly
ball. But he's not letting that power go
to his head.
"He's the white-collar member of
the crew, but he's definitely not over
bearing," Kissick said. "Rappy has a
lot of humility. He's a kid who will still
be nice to everyone, no matter how
good he gets."
