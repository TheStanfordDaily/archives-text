# Stanford starts title defense against locked and loaded conference foes
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Four teams out of the nine in the Pacific-10 Con
ference were greeted last week with the news that
they had garnered a top 20 preseason ranking. Not
one of the nine squads was surprised fora second —
the Pac-10 has never suffered from a shortage of
tough competition. One 2004 College World Series
competitor, four NCAA Tournament participants
and four teams struggling just to find the postseason
begin their seasons this week. Here is the outlook for
each of the Pacific-10 squads, listed in order of their
possible conference finish.
No. 6 Stanford Cardinal
46-14, 16-8 Pac-10/Ist
The numbers look daunting at first, even fora
powerhouse such as Stanford. Nine players left
the Farm for professional baseball after the 2004
season, including six starting position players
and the club's closer. But the two-time defending
conference champion Cardinal's strength has al
ways been in the coaching staff's recruiting abili
ty, which results in a complete team year after
year.
Stanford welcomes back two cogs of its explo
sive 2004 offense: juniors Jed Lowrie and John
Mayberry Jr., who hit .399 and .333 last season, re
spectively. Stanford returns its top two pitchers in
juniors Mark Romanczuk. who went 11-3 in 2004,
and Jeff Gilmore (10-2). Most of the pitching
staff's relief contributors also return for 2005, in
cluding the sophomore quartet of Blake Holler,
Matt Leva, Greg Reynolds and Jeff Stimpson. all
of whom will have a chance fora breakout year on
the mound.
The experienced hurling staff is backed up by a
proven infield — anchored by Preseason All-Amer
ican Lowrie — and arguably the Cardinal's weakest
contingent, a swift, hard-working, but largely inex
perienced outfield held together at the center seam
by sophomore Jim Rapoport.
No. 8 Washington Huskies
39-20-1. 15-9 Pac-10/2nd
Most of the expectations pinned to the
Huskies, who missed a share of the Pac-10 crown
by one game last season, can be traced to two cul
prits: sophomore hurlers Tim Linctcum and Kyle
Parker, who arguably comprise the conference's
most lethal 1-2 combination. To say Lincecum
showed unusual poise fora freshman would be an
understatement. The righthander racked up the
third-highest strikeout total in the nation on the
way to Pac-10 Pitcher of the Year and Freshman

of the Year honors.
The Washington lineup is a mixture of veterans
and inexperienced players, which has caused a bit of
a shuffle among position players but still allows fora
solid supporting cast for what will likely be the start
ing rotation's show.
No. 9 Arizona State Sun Devils
41-18,13-11 Pac-10/4th
Just like last season, all-around offensive
power is the key to ASU's 2005 campaign. Last
year's squad, which led the conference in hitting
with a team average of .325, relied heavily on the
swing of shortstop Dustin Pedroia, a .384 career
hitter who was drafted in the second round by the
Boston Red Sox. In Pedroia's absence, many eyes
will turn to outfielder and Team USA selection
Travis Buck, who batted at a .373 clip and paced
the Sun Devils in RBI. Arizona State also wel
comes back Ail-American Jason Urquidez, the
Pac-10 leader in wins (12).
The Sun Devils' postseason prospects will rely
heavily on their ability to contend with the toughest
non-conference schedule in the Pac-10. In addition
to having to face top-10 conference opponents in
Stanford and Washington, ASU has series sched
uled against defending national champion CSU-
Fullerton, No. 2 Lousiana State, No. 11 Baylor, No.
1 Tulane and No. 14 North Carolina.
No. 12Arizona Wildcats
36-27-1,12-12 Pac-10/sth
The strength of the Wildcats team is its large
group of returning starters. Seven of nine position
players return for Arizona, along with two-thirds of
its starting rotation. And considering that the team
was the conference's lone representative at the Col
lege World Series last June, the 'Cats could be set for
another solid year. Three of their 2005 starters hit
over .300 last season and one of those —junior out
fielder Trevor Crowe — ran away with 26 stolen
bases on the season.
The Arizona offense was so effective that the
staff's key starter, righthander John Meloan. who
also returns for 2005, wound up with a 10-0 record
despite a 4.66 ERA.
Southern California Trojans
24-32,10-14 Pac-10/T-6th
The Trojans will be hoping to ride into the post
season for the first time since 2002 on the coattails of
one of the nation's most highly acclaimed pitcher
catcher duos: possible first-round draft pick Jeff
Clement and righthander lan Kennedy. Clement,
essential in the leadership vein, is coming off a year

in which he hit .293 with 10 dingers and 43 RBI.
Kennedy, a sophomore and a Team USA alum, fin
ished 2004 with a 7-2 record, striking out 120 in 92 2/3
innings.
Oregon State Beavers
31-22. 10-14 Pac-10/T-6th
While righthander Dallas Buck went 3-6 during
his 2004 debut season, he also had a 4-1 record with
a 0.77 earned run average while pitching in 10 games
for Falmouth; in 58 innings, he allowed just 26 hits
while walking 20 and striking out 65. Junior Jacoby
Ellsbury looks to lead the Beavers again this year
after hitting .352 in 2004.
California Golden Bears
25-31.14-10 Pac-10/T-Bth
Though the Golden Bears have the potential to
contend with the top tier of their conference foes,
the team could struggle to find consistency after
losing 10 players to graduation or professional
baseball. Its pitching staff is highlighted by the
presence of junior ace Ada Gold, who paced the
team in strikeouts and nearly threw a no-hitter at
Fresno State, despite his deceptively mediocre 6-7
record in 2004.
UCLA Bruins
35-29,14-10 Pac-10/3rd
The Bruins are one of two teams in the confer
ence to start the year with a new head coach, and the
change is only one of the disadvantages that UCLA
has coming into 2005. New coach John Savage —
who previously coached at UC-Irvine, USC and
Nevada — has inherited a team depleted by gradua
tion and the MLB draft (11 players will not return
from the 2(X)4 staff). Righthanded pitcher Bryan
Beck, who went 2-3 in 11 appearances for last sea
son's Bruins, is the squad's lone senior.
Washington State Cougars
29-26.9-15 Pac-10rr-Bth
Washington State's 2005 will likely be branded
with the mark of inexperience. Don Marbut begins
his first year at the helm of the program (he was
named the team's assistant coach in August of 2003
and promoted to the top spot by May). Marbut will
take solace in the fact that the Cougars have a trio of
veterans in the outfield that make up a strong 1-2-3
band in the batting order.
However, the team's pitching staff is not solid.
The squad will have to contend with a tough
amount of travel, but a relatively soft non-confer
ence schedule.
