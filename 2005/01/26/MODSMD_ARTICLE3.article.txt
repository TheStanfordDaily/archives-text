# ASSU again debates investment disclosure
## 
### NICK PARKER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate heard a second round of argu
ments last night on a proposed hill
calling for investment disclosure of
University funds, including student
involvement in"the ethical over
sight of the endowment."
The Senate also confirmed a new
sophomore class president after tine
of the four elected officers resigned
last week.
Linda Kimball, manager of in
vestment responsibility for the Stan
ford Management Company, also
known as SMC. and four representa
tives of the Stanford Coalition for
Investment Disclosure, also known
as SCID. spoke to the Senate about
student involvement in Stanford's
investment procedures.
SCID representative Raphael
Ginsburg, a senior, said that the pro
posed bill would not ask the Univer
sity for full disclosure of its invest
ments.
"Our goal is full disclosure," he

said. "This bill is basically a pared
down version of what we are striving
for."
Kimball spoke to senators pri
marily about investment responsi
bility and how it is protected at Stan
ford.
"The Trustees' primary duty is to
ensure the health and growth of the
endowment over time to meet the
educational mission of the Universi
ty," she said. "However, as ethical
investors they are also responsible
for investigating expansive social in
jury by companies in which the Uni
versity invests."
After Stanford's divestment from
apartheid South Africa in the 1980s,
two special committees were formed
to ensure that the University's in
vestments are ethical.
The Special Committee on In
vestment Responsibility, or SCIR. is
a subcommittee of the University's
Board of Trustees and reports di
rectly to the Board, while the Advi-
sory Panel on Investment Responsi
bility, or APIR, whieh is composed
of students, faculty, and alumni,
among others, makes recommenda
tions to the SCIR.
Senior Anna Mumford, who is
one of four student representatives
on APIR, represented the special
committee at the meeting.
According to Kimball, each year
an independent committee deter
mines that about 70 out of the 2,(HM)
companies that Stanford invests in
have bad social practices, and a list of
these companies is given to APIR
but not to all Stanford students.
SCID representatives told the
Senate that the process lor student
complaints regarding investment re
sponsibility is complicated and
drawn-out.
In order to file a complaint, a stu
dent must first submit it to APIR.
which then must review the com
plaint before presenting it to the
SCIR, which must give it to the Uni
versity Board of Trustees for final
review.

Vote will be
next week

Kimball confirmed that student
complaints are rare, and she told the
Senate that in 2(X)4 there was not a
single complaint regarding invest
ment responsibility by a student.
Ginsburg voiced his concern over
investment disclosure and explained
SCID's long-term goals.
"Nobody outside of the Board of
Trustees and the Stanford Manage
ment Company has a complete list of
the companies that the University
invests in."he said. "We want more
student voice to make APIR a more
serious, proactive body."
The senators will vote on the pro
posal at next week's meeting.
The Senate also confirmed Lucas
Botello as a new sophomore class
president. Botello replaces Feranmi
Okanlami, who publicly announced
his resignation on Jan. 19 in an e
mail to the Class of 2(X)7. Okanlami
cited personal reasons as the
grounds for his departure.
Botello joins Rene Spellman,
Michael Lazar and Emma Vaughn
as class presidents.
