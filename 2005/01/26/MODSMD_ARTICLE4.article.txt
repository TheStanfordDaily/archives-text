# For some students, last call comes too early
## 
### EMMA VAUGHAN 
It is 1:30 a.m., and for most college students in New
York, the night is young. They have barely finished
primping and are just heading out to the nearby bars
and clubs, where they will remain until the wee hours of
the morning.
If we took these individuals out of New York and
placed them in Palo Alto, they would be probably
shocked when asked to leave bars only half an hour
after their arrival.
This disparity is the result of Section 25631 of Cali
fornia's Business and Professions Code, which prohibits
the distribution of alcohol between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.,
making Californian bars some of the earliest to close na
tionwide.
This regulation has been in place for some time, but
last year San Francisco activists decided to fight it. The
San Francisco Late Night Coalition, backed by Califor
nia State Assemblyman Mark Leno, a Democrat who
represents east San Francisco, created a bill to try and
extend the last call for alcohol to 4 a.m. The amend
ment, AB 2433, failed, but the concept has continued to
gain popularity.
It is supported on the Stanford campus by sopho
more Walter Haas. Haas, who happens to be one of
Stanford's few 21-year-old sophomores, picked up the
issue early in the fall and is in the process of creating a
student Political Action Committee devoted to extend
ing the last call in California.
"There are some profound economic and social ben
efits from it." Haas remarked. "A lot of small pluses
from something that seems like a relatively minor
change."


ANASTACIA JUNQUEIRA-DEGARCIAThe Stanford Dail'
issue for its social implications,
it is the legal and economic
statistics that have encouraged
him to pursue it.
Along with Leno and many of
San Francisco's residents,
Haas believes that an extended
last call will help to bolster the
city's economy in relation to
tourism, employment and tax
revenue. Cities across the
country, including New York,
Las Vegas, Miami, New Or
leans. Chicago and Washing
ton D.C. all hold last call after 2
a.m., which proponents of the
amendment believe could sig
nificantly add to their tourist
appeal.
"San Francisco should have
a chance to compete with these
cities," wrote Leno last April in
an opinion piece to the San
Francisco Bay Guardian, an al
ternative weekly newspaper.
"Now is an important time to
visibly support the nightlife
culture, especially since
tourism has taken a big hit in
recent years."
In addition to the financial
perks, Haas believes that a
later alcohol curfew could ac
tually save rather than endan
ger lives. He argues that the
most important step is to re
move the sense of urgency
from drinking.
"I know it seems counter
intuitive; but statistically states
with later last calls have lower
incidents of DUI," Haas said.
"What people do in California
is at 1:30 they decide they need
to pound, and since there is

nothing else open at that hour,
they just get in their cars and
drive home."
Statistics from the U.S. Na
tional Traffic Safety Adminis
tration reinforce Haas' claim
by citing that 42.4 percent of
driving deaths are related to al
cohol in states with an average
last call of 2 a.m. or earlier,
while 40.5 percent are related
to alcohol in states with an av
erage last call later than 2 a.m.
Many proponents of AB
2433 argue that the hours of
public transportation fit more
compatibly with a later last
call. Since many subways and
bus systems close at midnight
and reopen at 4 a.m., there is a
two-hour gap between the cur
rent last call and available pub
lic transportation.
"It would be so much easier
if we could rely on BART or
some other means of trans
portation to get us home."
commented sophomore Heidi
Moseson, a prospective mem
ber of the new PAC. "But with
the rules as they are now. we'd
have to wait around forever."
Bartenders and owners also
tend to oppose the current reg
ulations. Megan Gross, who
bartends at the Old Pro in
down town Palo Alto feels that
a later last call would help cus
tomers moderate their alcohol
intake.
"Now when I call Mast call,'
everybody rushes to the bar to
get those last few drinks,"
Gross remarked. "This is espe
cially true with young people.

The later call would be good
because people could come in
later and have a chance to
slowly sober up."
However, there are still
many organizations, most no
tably Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, that remain hesitant
about the safety benefits of
such an extension.
"People have always had a
knee-jerk suspicion about it."
commented Haas. "That's why
they've been naturally against
it, but it's really not true and I
want to get enough people and
information to effectively com
municate that to people."
When the amendment
failed last April, many attribut
ed it to the testimonies of both
police officers and a mother
whose child had been killed in
a drunk-driving accident.
"What they don't realize,"
commented Haas, "is that
we're both fighting for the
same thing."
Haas, who will hold his first
meeting Thursday at 8 p.m. in
Kimball, is confident in his
ability to gather support and
enthusiasm for the issue. He
has been in frequent communi
cation with Leno and has accu
mulated a list of over 25
prospective participants.
"This is something that I
feel anyone can really care
about," he commented. "I'm
not trying to change the world
or reinvent the wheel. It just
seems like something right and
something that could be attain
able."
