# For some students, last call comes too early
## 
### EMMA VAUGHAN 
It is 1:30 a.m., and for most college students in New
York, the night is young. They have barely finished
primping and are just heading out to the nearby bars
and clubs, where they will remain until the wee hours of
the morning.
If we took these individuals out of New York and
placed them in Palo Alto, they would be probably
shocked when asked to leave bars only half an hour
after their arrival.
This disparity is the result of Section 25631 of Cali
fornia's Business and Professions Code, which prohibits
the distribution of alcohol between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.,
making Californian bars some of the earliest to close na
tionwide.
This regulation has been in place for some time, but
last year San Francisco activists decided to fight it. The
San Francisco Late Night Coalition, backed by Califor
nia State Assemblyman Mark Leno, a Democrat who
represents east San Francisco, created a bill to try and
extend the last call for alcohol to 4 a.m. The amend
ment, AB 2433, failed, but the concept has continued to
gain popularity.
It is supported on the Stanford campus by sopho
more Walter Haas. Haas, who happens to be one of
Stanford's few 21-year-old sophomores, picked up the
issue early in the fall and is in the process of creating a
student Political Action Committee devoted to extend
ing the last call in California.
"There are some profound economic and social ben
efits from it." Haas remarked. "A lot of small pluses
from something that seems like a relatively minor
change."
