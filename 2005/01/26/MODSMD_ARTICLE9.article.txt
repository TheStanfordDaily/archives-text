On Jan. 26, 1973, The Daily ran a
story about the Faculty Senate's deci
sion to close down the Vienna over
seas studies campus. Below is an ex
cerpt:
"The Faculty Senate yesterday
voted unanimously to approve a res
olution from its Committee on For
eign Study Program (C-FSP) to
close down the present Stanford in
Austria campus.
"The -FSP statement recom
mended that the lease on the Vienna
site be terminated, but stressed that
this action in no way prejudiced Vi
enna as a location for the develop
ment of other programs."
"Prof. Clark Reynolds of the Food
Research Institute cited the Vienna
Campus' financial problems as a
chieT factor in his committee's deci
sion to advocate an end to the Aus
trian program.
There is, in fact, a very heavy
subsidy of those going to Vienna,
both by those who are going to the
program abroad, but also by the
University at large, amounting to ap
proximately $2,-000 per student.
This weighted very heavily in our de
cision,' he stated.
"In his report to the faculty body
yesterday. Provost William Miller
pointed to an expected $80,000
deficit that the University faces due
to low enrollment at the Vienna
campus as a good reason to termi
nate the campus base.

On Jan. 26, 1980, The Daily ran a
story about plans to create a scholar
ship fund for the children of U.S.
commandos who died trying to free
the hostages in Iran. Below is an ex
cerpt:
"A local group is trying to culti
vate national support fora scholar
ship fund for the children of the eight
men who died in the aborted rescue
attempt last April.
'"We were moved by the number
of gifts pouring in for the hostages,'
Kenneth Fulmer, a graduate student
in education and spokesman for the
group, said. 'However, we felt there
was no real way for the average guy
to honor the American sacrifice in
Iran.' he said.
"After a 'brainstorming' session
that included calls to local banks,
state government. ASSU Legal
Counseling Office and the U.S. State
Department, the group 'felt it might
be most appropriate to help those
who made the greatest sacrifice of all
on the hostages' behalf,' Fulmer
said.
"There are 17 children that the
scholarship must support, and ap
proximately one half million dollars
will be necessary to provide for them
all. Fulmer said.
"Since the oldest child is now 15,
there will be a need for the fund
money soon, he said. The bulk of the
drain will tie in about eight or 10
years when more of the children
reach college age. Fulmer said.
