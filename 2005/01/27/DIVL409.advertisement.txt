Want 10,000 people to read
what YOU write?
If so, there are two ways to join The Daily. Apply to be on the editorial board or to be a columnist. Details below.
APPLY TO BE ON THE
DAILY'S EDITORIAL
BOARD!
Applications are due on
Friday, January 28 @ 5 p.m.
Do you care about Stanford? Do you enjoy
learning about campus issues? Do you want to
make an impact on the campus community? If so,
then you belong on The Daily's editorial board.
The Daily's editorial board includes six non-
Daily individuals who work with four Daily edi
tors and writers to decide the topics and stances
of the paper's editorials. Editorial board mem
bers must attend one weekly editorial meeting,
write one editorial a week and submit ideas for
editorials.
If interested, please e-mail Anthony Ha
(acha@stanford.edu) with five editorial ideas, a
300-word sample editorial on a topic of your
choice and a short paragraph describing your in
terests and reasons for wanting to join the board
by Jan. 28 at 5 p.m.
BE A DAILY COLUMNIST!
Applications are due on Monday,
January 31 at 5 p.m.
Submit a packet with your contact information,
two sample columns (500-600 words each), a list
of 10 column ideas and a proposed theme for your
column to The Daily either by e-mail at
acha@stanford.edu or in a sealed envelope to The
Daily's offices at the Storke Publications Build
ing.
Applications will be reviewed in an anonymous
fashion, so do not mention your name in your
sample columns or ideas. All applicants will be
considered to either be features or opinions
columnists. Feel free to indicate a preference for
a type of column if you have one. Features colum
nists generally write social commentary pieces
that deal with issues such as fashion and style,
mating and dating, food and entertainment, trav
el and beer pong. Opinions columnists generally
tackle issues regarding campus, local, state or na
tional news and affairs, although their pieces
should still be written in an engaging manner and
can be lighthearted in tone.
