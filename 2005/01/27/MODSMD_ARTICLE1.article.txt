Perhaps it is fitting that No. 4 Stanford's trip to
the Northwest this weekend marks the start of the
second half of the Pacific-10 Conference schedule.
The Cardinal (17-2,8-1 Pac-10) spent the first half
of their conference season climbing to the top of
the 10-dog pile. The final nine games could see

Stanford pull away from the
pack.
The Cardinal, picked in
the preseason to defend
their conference champi
onship, played their early
conference games without
fifth-year senior Susan King
Borchardt at full strength.
Stanford grew into its new
triangle offense and mean
while suffered a road loss to
an inspired Oregon team in
late December.
Since that game in Eu
gene, Ore., however, the
Cardinal have truly become
a juggernaut. In the eight
contests since its loss to the
Ducks (including one non
conference tilt with No. 14
Boston College), Stanford
has gone undefeated, dis
patching its opponents, in
cluding a pair of Top-25
teams, by an average of 21.9
points.
More recently, this ma-

chine has found yet another gear, winning its last
four games (two against ranked teams) by an aver
age of 26.5 points. In short, it's a bad time for op
posing teams to see "vs. Stanford" on the schedule.
"I think [the games versus UCLA and USC] was
our best weekend from top to bottom," Borchardt
said. "Everyone got in the game and everyone
played well. Those weren't bad teams we were
playing at all, so.that's exciting."
After spending two weeks at home in which they
gained sole possession of the Pac-10 lead, the Car
dinal will take their show to the Evergreen State for
rematches with Washington (8-11,4-5) and Wash
ington State (4-14,0-9).
With the departure of Washington's senior scor
ing leader Giuliana Mendiola, the Husky offense

has been significantly slimmer this year, managing
almost five fewer points per game than the unit that
ranked second in the conference a year ago. Wash
ington's defense has been even more generous this
season than last, after giving up the second-most
points in the Pac-10 in 2004.
In tonight's game, the Cardinal will try to estab
lish the same type of interior dominance that car
ried them to victory three weeks ago at Maples
Pavilion. Junior Brooke Smith and Kristen Newlin
ruled the paint with an iron fist against the Huskies,
and both collected a double-double.
"They have a bull's eye on this game," Smith said.
"So we're prepared fora pretty physical game, and
prepared for them to try to make some adjustments."
While Washington will likely work hard to mix
up its defensive looks and deny the Cardinal easy
baskets in the post, Stanford's balanced offense will
make it tough for the Huskies to focus on a single
area of the court.
Even if Stanford does move back to the perime
ter, is that really what the Huskies want? Fifteen
three-point field goals and 100 points against No.
25 UCLA suggest the Cardinal can play the long
distance game with little trouble.
"Washington will be in both a fman-to-man] and
zone defense," associate head coach Amy Tucker
said. "Regardless of what they're in, we'll be going
inside and then hitting people from there."
After this evening's engagement with Washing
ton, Stanford moves on to Pullman, Wash., where
things figure to get much easier in a 2 p.m. matinee
with Washington State on Saturday.
For the life of Washington State's women's bas
ketball program, the word "Stanford" has been
synonymous with "loss." The next time the
Cougars defeat the Cardinal will be the first time.
Ever.
Thirty-nine times the two teams have met.
Thirty-nine teams Stanford has triumphed. The
Cardinal have owned the series in every statistical
sense and will look to continue that domination
on Saturday. Key will be Stanford's pressure de
fense, which created 14 steals and 24 Washington
State turnovers in the first meeting between these
teams.
On a trip that Stanford looks prepared to domi
nate, the biggest challenge will be to maintain
focus.
"Our focus is on Stanford getting better," Tuck
er said. "We want to be doing things well by our
standards, not by the other team's. We know that
there can't be any letdown."

After this evening's engagement with Washing
ton, Stanford moves on to Pullman, Wash., where
things figure to get much easier in a 2 p.m. matinee
with Washington State on Saturday.
For the life of Washington State's women's bas
ketball program, the word "Stanford" has been
synonymous with "loss." The next time the
Cougars defeat the Cardinal will be the first time.
Ever.
Thirty-nine times the two teams have met.
Thirty-nine teams Stanford has triumphed. The
Cardinal have owned the series in every statistical
sense and will look to continue that domination
on Saturday. Key will be Stanford's pressure de
fense, which created 14 steals and 24 Washington
State turnovers in the first meeting between these
teams.
On a trip that Stanford looks prepared to domi
nate, the biggest challenge will be to maintain
focus.
"Our focus is on Stanford getting better," Tuck
er said. "We want to be doing things well by our
standards, not by the other team's. We know that
there can't be any letdown."

After trouncing UCLA and USC at home to take over sole possession of first
place in the Pac-10, No. 2 Stanford kicks off the second half of the conference
season tonight at Washington.

Perhaps it is fitting that No. 4 Stanford's trip to
the Northwest this weekend marks the start of the
second half of the Pacific-10 Conference schedule.
The Cardinal (17-2,8-1 Pac-10) spent the first half
of their conference season climbing to the top of
the 10-dog pile. The final nine games could see

Stanford pull away from the
pack.
The Cardinal, picked in
the preseason to defend
their conference champi
onship, played their early
conference games without
fifth-year senior Susan King
Borchardt at full strength.
Stanford grew into its new
triangle offense and mean
while suffered a road loss to
an inspired Oregon team in
late December.
Since that game in Eu
gene, Ore., however, the
Cardinal have truly become
a juggernaut. In the eight
contests since its loss to the
Ducks (including one non
conference tilt with No. 14
Boston College), Stanford
has gone undefeated, dis
patching its opponents, in
cluding a pair of Top-25
teams, by an average of 21.9
points.
More recently, this ma-

chine has found yet another gear, winning its last
four games (two against ranked teams) by an aver
age of 26.5 points. In short, it's a bad time for op
posing teams to see "vs. Stanford" on the schedule.
"I think [the games versus UCLA and USC] was
our best weekend from top to bottom," Borchardt
said. "Everyone got in the game and everyone
played well. Those weren't bad teams we were
playing at all, so.that's exciting."
After spending two weeks at home in which they
gained sole possession of the Pac-10 lead, the Car
dinal will take their show to the Evergreen State for
rematches with Washington (8-11,4-5) and Wash
ington State (4-14,0-9).
With the departure of Washington's senior scor
ing leader Giuliana Mendiola, the Husky offense

has been significantly slimmer this year, managing
almost five fewer points per game than the unit that
ranked second in the conference a year ago. Wash
ington's defense has been even more generous this
season than last, after giving up the second-most
points in the Pac-10 in 2004.
In tonight's game, the Cardinal will try to estab
lish the same type of interior dominance that car
ried them to victory three weeks ago at Maples
Pavilion. Junior Brooke Smith and Kristen Newlin
ruled the paint with an iron fist against the Huskies,
and both collected a double-double.
"They have a bull's eye on this game," Smith said.
"So we're prepared fora pretty physical game, and
prepared for them to try to make some adjustments."
While Washington will likely work hard to mix
up its defensive looks and deny the Cardinal easy
baskets in the post, Stanford's balanced offense will
make it tough for the Huskies to focus on a single
area of the court.
Even if Stanford does move back to the perime
ter, is that really what the Huskies want? Fifteen
three-point field goals and 100 points against No.
25 UCLA suggest the Cardinal can play the long
distance game with little trouble.
"Washington will be in both a fman-to-man] and
zone defense," associate head coach Amy Tucker
said. "Regardless of what they're in, we'll be going
inside and then hitting people from there."
