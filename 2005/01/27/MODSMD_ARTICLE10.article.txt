# Senate confirms Rice; Krasner named director of policy planning
## 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Former University Provost Condoleezza Rice was
confirmed by the Senate yesterday afternoon by a vote
of 85-13, making her the next secretary of state. Rice,
the first black woman to occupy that post, was sworn in
hours later at the White House.
The outcome was no surprise, especially after Rice
eased through a committee hearing last week with a 16-
2 vote, despite facing some contentious questioning
from Democrats, especially Senator Barbara Boxer of
California.
Rice has been a fixture on campus since 1981, when
she arrived as a fellow in the arms control and disarma
ment program. She became a tenured professor in the
political science department, and served as a Hoover
Senior Fellow from 1991 until 1993, when she became
provost.
"Condi Rice will give us first-class leadership as Sec
retary of State," said George P. Shultz, a business school
professor emeritus and Secretary of State under Presi
dent Reagan. "She knows the world, and she can work
effectively with the president and with her colleagues in
the national security field, and with the people of the
State Department."
"On a personal note," Shultz added, "she is a great
human being, and she will do us proud around the world
as our representative."
University President John Hennessy is visiting Japan
and could not be reached for comment.
Rice has appointed Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner to become the director of policy planning. (A
profile of Krasner will be in The Daily on Monday.)
"Professor Krasner's departure for the State Depart
ment is great news for Secretary Rice," said Professor
Coit Blacker, director of the Stanford Institute for In
ternational Studies. "It is not so great news for Stanford,
but we wish him well in his new job and we expect that
he will enjoy every success. And, of course, we count the
days when he will return to Stanford."
