### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At 11:30 p.m. on Tuesday night,
Mirrielees residents were evacuated
after a broken sprinkler head caused a
fire alarm to sound off.
"The fire alarm went off due to a
malfunctioning sprinkler head,"' said
police sergeant David Lee. "The sprin
kler head broke due to unknown caus
es, and the water flow triggered the fire
alarm."
Mirrielees Resident Assistant
Jacqueline Doziersaid, "When the fire
alarm went off, we had no idea what
was going on, so we evacuated all of
the residents in accordance with nor
mal fire drill procedures. It wasn't until
we were outside and we saw water
spraying out of the building that we re
alized there was something unusual."

Lee said that no one was hurt and
the majority of the students were co
operative. The resident advisor said
that some students who did not realize
the severity of the problem attempted
to re-enter the building before being
given permission by the police, but
these students were asked to leave ei
ther by staff members or by the offi
cers.
"If a resident was not cooperative
or somehow hindered us in performing
out duties, we would have had to make
arrests or citations," Lee said. "But in
this case, everything went smoothly
and no arrests were made."
The problem started in one room
on the third floor but soon affected all
the rooms in the A wing, one of three
wings in the dorm.
"The room with the broken sprin
kler head and the rooms directly un

derneath suffered the majority of the
damage," Dozier said. "The rooms on
either side of the initial room suffered
some minor damages, and the third
and first-floor hallways were signifi
cantly affected. The second-floor hall
way escaped severe damage, because
most of the water leaked through and
collected on the first floor."
Lee said that a couple of the stu
dents had to be dispatched from their
rooms because of the flooding. They
were placed in temporary housing.
"The sprinkler head broke in my
next-door neighbor's room, but my en
tire room was flooded," said sopho
more Sherri Hansen, a resident of one
of the flooded rooms. "My roommates
and 1 couldn't spend last night in the
room and had to stay with friends. Mv
