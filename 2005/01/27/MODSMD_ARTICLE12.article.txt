# After one success and one failure, Naranja holds third annual non-alcoholic dance party
## 
### KATIE BEARMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Do you feel like the same few hip-hop songs
play on repeat at Stanford parties? Had enough
of Snoop and Britney? If so, organizers of an
electronic music party on campus believe that
partygoers will head toward Naranja, one of
the five houses in Lagunita Court. And in place
of a keg or a full bar, there will be fresh oranges
and Jamba Juice.
"Regardless of your musical taste, you
should come see what other parties like Cloud
Orange can be like and support it in being dif
ferent," said junior Greg Hochmuth.
Electronic music is produced by using elec
tronic and computer synthesizers to remix al
ready-composed songs or to create original
pieces.
"It's mostly recognized by its strong 4/4 bass
beat, and it's very international in nature," said
junior Max Mednik, a self-taught DJ. "There
are many different genres of electronic music:
club/dance, house, rave, techno, trance, drum
and bass, jungle and more."
These alternative tunes have quite a follow
ing in San Francisco, and various undergrads
are trying to bring the trend to campus.
"I'm starting a dance / performance group
called 'Lightswept,' to represent electronic
dance culture at Stanford," said freshman
David Ho. "People have already joined the
group expressing interest in learning to rave."
Although 'Lightswept' is not yet ready to
perform, some members hope to teach basic
rave moves to partygoers.
Naranja has hosted similarly themed parties
for the past two years — "Orange Pill" in 2003
and "Tranceford" in 2004. Mednik said that
"Orange Pill" was so successful that he had to
turn off the music and force lively undergrads
out of the West Lag lounge after 1 a.m.
But only about 20 people attended "Tranee

ford," perhaps because there were a few other
large parties going on that night, organizers
speculated.
"The party was a lot of fun — the DJ-ing and
club atmosphere were excellent," said senior
Andrew Buck. "I went because I've been rav
ing for about seven years, and because I rarely
get a chance to do it any more. The provision of
fresh oranges was pretty cool, too."
Mednik will once again be at the helm of
preparations for this year's event and is trying
to advertise "Cloud Orange" as widely as pos

sihle. He hopes that Naranja will he throwing
electronic music bashes for many years to
come.
"This will he the third year of this party, so
it's kind of becoming a tradition here, like Ex
otic Erotic at 680 Lomita," Mednik said.
Ho said. "I think it's great that people like
Mednik are showing Stanford that a different
kind of party — with Jamba Juice instead of al
cohol, with trance instead of hip-hop — can still
rock the house."
