On January 27, 1998, The Daily
wrote an article about senior Anne
linger, who won a year's supply of
MAM candies.
Imagine opening a bag of M& M can
dies and discovering that you've won
a year's supply of those bite-sized
chocolates that "melt in your mouth
and not in your hand." What would
you do?
Senior Anne Unger is currently
facing this very predicament.
"If 1 see another M&M. I'm going
to die." Unger said. "They're com
ing out of my ears."
Last summer, Unger found the
prize-winning gray M&Ms in her
bag during the Impostor M&Ms
Contest while on a visit to Seattle.
"I was sick as a dog, "complained
Unger, who had contracted
mononucleosis and strep throat,
"my mom said, 'We're going to
make Anne feel better.' so she rent
ed 'Out of Africa' and bought me my
favorite candies, including a huge
bag of almond M&Ms."
Unger said she opened the bag to
find gray M&Ms and wondered if
the company had produced a new
color.
"I opened the 'Peel and see if you
won' sticker and saw that I won first
prize ... a year's supply of M&Ms.."
Unger said.
The year's supply of M&Ms does
not mean Unger can eat all the
M&Ms she wants in the next year.
Actually, Unger received 365
coupons for the 50-cent M&M bags,
redeemable at any store selling the
candy.
"The first time I redeemed the
coupons was at the Safeway in
Mountain View." Unger explained.

"Everyone heard from the cashier
about my year's supply and came
over to see me. Later, a random guy
in my apartment who was actually at
Safeway saw me unloading my gro
ceries and said, "You're the one who
won a year's supply of M&Ms!"
Unger proceeded to hand the
man a bag of M&Ms.
"Stores laugh at me now since 1
buy like 40 bags of M&Ms at a time,"
Unger said. "The cashiers all say,
'Oh God, she's back.' since they
have to type in every coupon."
On January 21, 1937, The Daily
wrote an article about the availability
of single women for date-less Stan
ford men fora dance in Roble Gym.
Men without dates or cars will get
special consideration at the Presi
dent's Ball in the Women's Gym
next Saturday night. Any man in
need of a date may leave his name
and height at the ASSU office when
he buys his ticket to the dance, and a
date with a Roble or Lagunita girl
will be arranged for him.
Both dormitories are within easy
walking distance of the Gym. so the
necessity of a car is thereby re
moved. This plan was developed by
the members of the committee for
the affair yesterday and was ap
proved by ASSU President Jim
Reynolds. Carlene Brown, the social
chairwoman of Lagunita. and Betty
Grover, president of Roble.
Stanford's celebration of Presi
dent Roosevelt's birthday will pro
vide funds to help cure victims of in
fantile paralysis at the Foundation at
Warm Springs, Georgia.
