# Get that freakishly white smile you've dreamed of
## Your guide to teeth-whitening products 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Unnaturally white teeth — they seem to be
a must-have nowadays. Such pearly whites
are all the rage; actors and actresses, ath
letes and singers all display brilliant smiles
for the public to see. You better believe
Britney Spears' paycheck depends at least
partially on her radioactive grin. And with
the advent of accessible teeth-whitening
products, the average citizen can achieve
the same results —or so advertisements
would have you believe
But be cautious. Haven't you seen that
Friends episode? Ross tries a teeth
whitening gel and ends up with freakishly
fluorescent teeth — unique, but not exact
ly what a girl looks for on a hot date. Here
is a risk assessment guide to help you nav
igate the deluge of products available on
drugstore shelves.
1) Crest Whitestrips — Since their debut in
2001, over 20 million Americans questing for
whiter teeth have turned to Crest. At a retail
price of $27.99 fora box of 28 strips, this sys
tem is touted to whiten your teeth in 14 days.
If you simply cannot wait that long. Crest
Whitestrips Premium are said to visibly
whiten teeth in just three to seven days.
Freshman Mariel Bailey raved about her
results using the regular whitestrips.
"My teeth got almost a little too white after
a week and a half so I stopped," she said.
But are they easy to use? Well, it de
pends on who you ask. Bailey said that the
strips were comfortable enough to wear
during commonplace activities, like show
ering. But fellow freshman Thaisan Ton
that had mixed feelings.
"They were a little bit of a pain because
they slide around in your mouth if you're not
careful, and they're messy if you play around
with them," he said. "Also, they leave a
residue on your teeth that you have to wash
out afterwards."

Crest Whitestrips also have certain chemi
cal drawbacks. Their active ingredient is hy
drogen peroxide, which can irritate gums
and increase tooth sensitivity, leaving some
users a bit uncomfortable after wearing the
strips for the directed 30 minutes. In addi
tion. the strips cannot be used to whiten any
thing but your natural teeth, not even caps,
fillings or crowns.
2) Whitening gels — Using gels is certain
ly a more hands-on experience. While Crest
Whitestrips come with a measured amount
of teeth-whitener on each strip, gels allow

you to apply whitener manually, as much or
as little as you want. Most brands of gel must
be allowed to sit on the teeth for anywhere
between 20 minutes to overnight.
If kept on overnight. Crest Night Effects
promises results within 14 days for the price
of approximately $15 a box. Yet for $18.99,
Rembrandt's 2-Hour White Kit can be ap
plied in six 20-minute intervals all in one day
— seems like a great deal if you're meeting
that special someone for dinner.
"My friend used white strips," said fresh
man Kelly Foster. "I used the whitening gel
because it was cheaper."
Any disadvantages? These gels can get in
credibly messy. After applying the solution,
you must keep your mouth open for at least
30 seconds in order for the gel to dry on your
teeth. If your lips touch your teeth, the gel
wipes off and you must reapply.
3) Whitening toothpastes — The least
expensive of the teeth-whitening prod
ucts, toothpastes have also made a big im
pact on the dental market. They are easy
to use and automatically built into your
schedule. Every brand of toothpaste on
the market offers whitening solutions
with retail prices of up to $8. However, lit
tle change in teeth whiteness has been
witnessed by users. Whitening tooth
pastes simply remove surface stains, but
all toothpastes can do that. Don't fall prey
to marketing tricks.
4) Professional bleaching — Companies
like 1-800-BriteSmile have popped up
across the nation, promoting the opportu
nity for brighter, whiter smiles after a sin
gle one-hour appointment.
A company consultant meets with you
before your appointment to discuss just
how white you want your teeth to be, and
can adjust treatment accordingly. During
your appointment, a whitening gel is ap
plied to your teeth while a special light
uses the chemical process of oxidation to
activate the gel.
While 1-800-BriteSmile has proven effec
tive and can remove stains from caps and ve
neers, treatment is pricey. Prices depend on
location, but are usually upwards of $ 1,000 to
$2,000.

All and all, the cheapest and most effi
cient option may very well be to abstain
from coffee, soda, tea and tobacco prod
ucts. While all the products listed above are
intended to remove such stains from natu
ral teeth, all your whitening efforts can be
undone if you continue to regularly con
sume coffee and colas.
