# The 						Great Pot Debate?
## Fight over medical marijuana goes national 
### MICHELLE KELLER HEALTH COLUMNIST 
The line dividing recreational drugs and le
gitimate medical drug is growing increasing
ly blurry. Legal drugs can be abused, and il
licit drugs can often be successfully used to
treat medical conditions.
Heroin, for example, was once sold by the
Bayer Corporation for use as a cough sup
pressant and to aid recovery from morphine
addiction. Of course the drug was rapidly
banned once health officials and doctors rec
ognized that it was highly addictive. Most
would argue that this was a smart move, but
perhaps the arguments are not so clear for
other drugs.
For instance, the Food and Drug Admin
istration recently approved a study at Har
vard that will look into whether or not ecsta
sy can improve the emotional health of ter
minally ill patients. Other researchers have
investigated the active ingredients in "magic
mushrooms" and how they can help people
suffering from obsessive-compulsive disor
der. So where does one draw the line be
tween helping a select group of sick patients
and creating a national drug abuse problem?
Nowhere is this controversy more alive
than in the debate over the legalization of
medical marijuana — a battle based right
here in California. State Proposition 215, en
acted in 1996, allows doctors to recommend
medical marijuana on a case-by-case basis.
The drug is typically used to relieve patients
with chronic pain, increase appetite in AIDS
patients, treat mood disorders and reduce
nausea associated with chemotherapy.
Many doctors believe it works. One Har
vard study of 2.000 physicians found that
over 40 percent of oncologists recommend
the use of marijuana following chemothera
py treatments.

Prop. 215 allows patients to claim exemp
tion from the law if they can provide evi

dence of special medical circumstances.
However, since buying marijuana is still ille
gal in California, patients must grow their
own. In Sonoma County, for example, those
who are exempt may cultivate up to 99 plants
and can possess up to three pounds of mari
juana at any one time. Those who cannot
grow their own supply often make special ar
rangements through "Cannabis Clubs,"
using a special "club card."
Despite Prop. 215, tension still exists be
tween law enforcement and medicinal mari
juana users, particularly because marijuana
is illegal under federal law, which is inter
preted by some to trump state law. As a re
sult, cannabis clubs and even patients' homes
continue to be raided by police.
Yet this spring, one Supreme Court case
might change everything. The case concerns
a California mother of two. Angel McClary
Raich, who suffers from a number of medical
problems, including tumors in her brain and
uterus. She began using marijuana when no
other medication allowed her to function. In
2002, Raich, along with another patient and
two caregivers, sued the United States gov
ernment to prevent federal authorities from
interfering with her use of medical marijua
na. If the Supreme Court rules against Raich,
the federal government will have the final
say on the legalization of the drug.
But enough legal talk. This is a health page,
and the real question remains: Do the bene
fits of medical marijuana outweigh the costs?
To start off, let's go over what happens to
your body when you smoke a joint. Marijua
na is composed of thousands of chemical
compounds. The one that causes users to feel
"high" is called delta-9-tetrahydrocannibol,
also known as THC. When you inhale from a
pipe or a joint, THC enters your lungs, dis
solves into your bloodstream and eventually
makes its way to your brain. THC binds to
specific sites known as cannabinoid recep
tors. which are found in regions of the brain

related to pleasure, thought, concentration,
memory, perception of sensations and time
and movement. As a result, when you feel
high, your memory, thought and concentra
tion are also impaired.
Additionally, with each inhalation, car
cinogenic compounds make their way into
your body, many of which can irritate your
mouth, throat and lungs. Marijuana is
unique in that it is nowhere near as addictive
as other drugs — including legal drugs. Even
so, long-term use has the potential to lead to
addiction.
What about the medical benefits? As men
tioned, marijuana can help people with se
vere pain, cancer patients suffering from side
effects of chemotherapy and AIDS patients
who have no appetite. In some cases, mari
juana can help people conquer a day full of
pain, nausea or extreme fatigue.
Law enforcement and public health of
ficials fear that if medical marijuana is
completely legalized across the nation, use
— both prescribed and recreational —
will skyrocket.
There is evidence to support this concern.
After Oregon made use of medical marijua
na legal in 1998, the number of users spiked
much higher than expected. Today, 10,000
Oregonians hold medical marijuana cards.
Some question whether all cases are legiti
mate — and whether patients share their
marijuana with non-patients.
But do a few people abusing the system
justify denying everyone who needs the drug
for legitimate medical reasons? If a handful
of people overdose on morphine, should this
important analgesic be banned entirely?
The decision no longer lies in the hands of
Californians —or any other common citi
zens, for that matter. We can only watch and
wait to see what the court decides this spring.
