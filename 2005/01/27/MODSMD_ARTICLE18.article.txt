# F.D.A. stalls morning-after pill decision again
## Student opinion heavily divided on whether or not an emergency contraceptive should be available over the counter on campus 
### CHUAN-MEI LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over Thanksgiving break, a female Stan
ford student awoke to the scary realization
that she had less than 72 hours to obtain a
morning-after pill. She immediately called
Vaden Student Health Center, only to be
met with a voice mail message. She was left
with no choice but to wait for the on-call
clinician to get back to her.
Barr Pharmaceuticals hopes to eliminate
such situations by making the emergency
contraceptive Plan B available over-the
counter to women ages 16 and older. This
would eliminate the need for medical con
sultation, allowing women quicker access to
the treatment within the short timeframe
that it is effective.
Amid political controversy, the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) was ex
pected to rule on Barr Pharmaceuticals' pro
posal last Friday. However, the FDA post
poned its decision, prompting a lawsuit from
the Center for Reproductive Rights.
Opinion on campus surrounding emergen
cy contraception is just as divided, and lines
are often drawn according one's opinion on
reproductive choice and abortion.
Stanford Students for Choice enthusiasti
cally supports the proposal to make Plan B
available over the counter.
"The circumstances that lead to the

need for emergency contraception are not
ones that can necessarily wait fora doc
tor's appointment or clinic visit," said co
terminal student Emily Flynn, a member
of Students for Choice. "In the interest of
empowering women to make decisions
about their health, [emergency contracep
tion] should be easily accessible and af-

"People may be in situa
tions that their family
would not be in support of
or in abusive relation
ships. They need to be
able to obtain emergency
contraception easily and
without a lot of fanfare "

fordable, regardless of a woman's proxim
ity to a clinic, hospital or doctor's office."
However. Stanford Students for Life
strongly opposes the proposal.
"Emergency contraception, as I under
stand, is still a form of abortion because
conception has already occurred," said

sophomore Dennis Adams, a member of
Students for Life. "What emergency con
traception does is make it impossible for
the fertilized egg to implant itself on the
wall of the uterus. And so that denies the
fertilized egg life, which is what our group
is fighting against. Our group is about pro
tecting the dignity of human life from con
ception to natural death."
According to Barr Pharmaceuticals, Plan
B is thought to work by preventing ovula
tion, fertilization or implantation. The emer
gency contraceptive is 89 percent effective in
preventing pregnancy when taken within 72
hours of unprotected intercourse. The soon
er the treatment is taken, the more effective
it becomes.
Sophomore Alexandra Goldman, a peer
counselor at the Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center, emphasized the sensitive na
ture of sexual health.
"People may be in situations that their
family would not be supportive of or in abu
sive relationships," she said. "They need to
be able to obtain emergency contraception
easily and without a lot of fanfare."
She also said that the current political at
mosphere in the country is not very con
ducive to improving the accessibility of con
traception in general.
"People are fallible, and methods of con
traception. while more effective than the
Bush administration would like us to believe.

are fallible," Goldman added. "Condoms
are fallible. Women in that situation are real
ly freaked out. It would really simplify things
if [the morning-after pill] was available over
the counter."
Other students felt that eliminating the
need to see a clinician would be detrimental.
"1 personally don't think this will benefit
Stanford students," said senior Natalie
Lozano, also a member of Stanford Stu
dents for Life. "As I understand it, it is quite
easy to go to Vaden, talk to a doctor or
nurse practitioner and get the prescription.
So, in my opinion, the pill is pretty much
readily available."
She added that students would have the
additional benefit of exploring other options
of birth control, rather than relying on emer
gency contraception after the fact.
In California, emergency contraception is
already available directly from participating
pharmacists without an advance prescrip
tion from a doctor. According to Robyn
Tepper. chief physician of medical services
at Vaden, "pharmacy access" is not avail
able at Vaden because clinicians are usually
easy to contact.
There are, however, several participating
pharmacies in Palo Alto which dispense
emergency contraception with only pharma
cist consultation, including the pharmacy at
Safeway on Middlefield Road and at Wal
greens on University Avenue.
