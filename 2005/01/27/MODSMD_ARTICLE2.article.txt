### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a home loss to Arizona State three weeks
ago, the idea of an 11th straight NCAA Tourna
ment bid was the furthest thing from senior center
Rob Little's mind. The loss dropped the Cardinal
to 0-3 in the Pacific-10 Conference, and without
any marquee non-conference wins, Stanford sat

squarely on the proverbial
bubble — for an NIT bid.
Four wins later, when
Little and the Cardinal (10-
7,4-3 Pac-10) take the floor
tonight at Maples Pavilion
against Oregon State (11-7,
3-4), their NCAA outlook
will be as bright as it has
been all season.
"I see the bracket and
Joe Lunardi's predictions,"
said Little, referring to
ESPN.corn's "Bracketolo
gist," who projects the tour
nament's field each week.
"We're playing the bracket
game like everyone else,
trying to get into the field of
64. The NCAA seems like
it's far away, but it's almost
February and March is right
around the corner."
In this week's edition of
Bracketology. Lunardi put
Stanford among the last
four teams in the tourna
ment. Taking into account
RPI (Stanford is 40th),

strength of schedule, quality wins and bad losses
among other criteria, Lunardi tabbed the Cardinal
as a 12-seed.
To Little, the formula for securing a bid on Se
lection Sunday is much simpler.
"We have to get another good win and win out
at home," Little said. "We need to beat Arizona at
Arizona and / or defend the homecourt against
Washington to be even considered for the NCAA.

I think without a doubt we have to finish third in the
league and we can't go out in the first round at Sta
ples Center like we've done previously."
Defending Maples starts tonight.
Oregon State, which can match last season's vic
tory total with a win this weekend, is one of the
most experienced teams in the Pac-10 and is led by
senior forward David Lucas. The All Pac-10 selec
tion is averaging 14.4 points and 4.3 rebounds in
nine games since returning from a foot injury.
Guards Chris Stephens and J.S. Nash both average
over 10 points per game.
"Oregon State is a good defensive team and
wants to pick up the pace of the game," said junior
point guard Chris Hernandez, who is averaging
13.8 points. "They've got a good core back."
Looking to reignite their own NCAA Tourna
ment aspirations, the Beavers have struggled away
from home fora second consecutive year. Head
coach Jay John's squad has one road win in its past
15 conference games and has lost four of five over
all since starting 10-3.
In his latest projections, Lunardi has six Pac-10
teams in the tournament, which is double the num
ber of bids the conference received in what was by
all measures a down year for the conference last
season. In addition to Stanford and Pac-10 leaders
Washington and Arizona. Arizona State, UCLA
and Oregon, the Cardinal's opponent Saturday,
make the cut.
With the Pac-10 season still not half over, it
doesn't mean much, but it's a barometer of how far
Stanford has climbed in three weeks since their
upset win over Arizona.
Head coach Trent Johnson felt the turnaround
occurred one week prior, in Stanford's narrow loss
at Washington. Little agrees.
"It's obvious that we've been playing well since
that game," Little said. "It was definitely the best
game that we had played all year, playing against a
good team, on the road in a very hostile environ
ment. We showed up."
Stanford is 4-1 since the loss and is all alone in
third place in the Pac-10 standings. As Washington
and UCLA proved last year, a perfect or horrid
start guarantees nothing in the wacky Pac-10. The
Huskies began conference play 0-5 before rattling

off 12 wins in their next 13 conference games to
earn an at-large bid. The Bruins were 5-0 in Pac-10
play before plummeting and missing the tourna
ment.
"We didn't overthink it when we were losing,"
Little said. "We just needed to play together and
play within ourselves. We're getting better shots
out of everyone."
That includes junior forward Matt Haryasz. who
scored 32 points in Stanford's sweep of the Los An
geles schools last weekend. Leading scorer Dan
Grunfeld continued to get good looks as well, scor
ing 45 points on 13-for-23 shooting to earn Pac-10
Player of the Week honors.
Last weekend's good fortune behind them and
Selection Sunday still too far away, there's no ques
tioning where Stanford's focus lies.
"Just because we got two wins in L.A. doesn't
put 20 points on the scoreboard on Thursday,"
Grunfeld said.
"If we lose to Oregon State, it's out the door,
we'll be out again," Little said. "We can't look too
far ahead."

ment bid was the furthest thing from senior center
Rob Little's mind. The loss dropped the Cardinal
to 0-3 in the Pacific-10 Conference, and without
any marquee non-conference wins, Stanford sat

squarely on the proverbial
bubble — for an NIT bid.
Four wins later, when
Little and the Cardinal (10-
7,4-3 Pac-10) take the floor
tonight at Maples Pavilion
against Oregon State (11-7,
3-4), their NCAA outlook
will be as bright as it has
been all season.
"I see the bracket and
Joe Lunardi's predictions,"
said Little, referring to
ESPN.corn's "Bracketolo
gist," who projects the tour
nament's field each week.
"We're playing the bracket
game like everyone else,
trying to get into the field of
64. The NCAA seems like
it's far away, but it's almost
February and March is right
around the corner."
In this week's edition of
Bracketology. Lunardi put
Stanford among the last
four teams in the tourna
ment. Taking into account
RPI (Stanford is 40th),

strength of schedule, quality wins and bad losses
among other criteria, Lunardi tabbed the Cardinal
as a 12-seed.
To Little, the formula for securing a bid on Se
lection Sunday is much simpler.
"We have to get another good win and win out
at home," Little said. "We need to beat Arizona at
Arizona and / or defend the homecourt against
Washington to be even considered for the NCAA.

I think without a doubt we have to finish third in the
league and we can't go out in the first round at Sta
ples Center like we've done previously."
Defending Maples starts tonight.
Oregon State, which can match last season's vic
tory total with a win this weekend, is one of the
most experienced teams in the Pac-10 and is led by
senior forward David Lucas. The All Pac-10 selec
tion is averaging 14.4 points and 4.3 rebounds in
nine games since returning from a foot injury.
Guards Chris Stephens and J.S. Nash both average
over 10 points per game.
"Oregon State is a good defensive team and
wants to pick up the pace of the game," said junior
point guard Chris Hernandez, who is averaging
13.8 points. "They've got a good core back."
Looking to reignite their own NCAA Tourna
ment aspirations, the Beavers have struggled away
from home fora second consecutive year. Head
coach Jay John's squad has one road win in its past
15 conference games and has lost four of five over
all since starting 10-3.
In his latest projections, Lunardi has six Pac-10
teams in the tournament, which is double the num
ber of bids the conference received in what was by
all measures a down year for the conference last
season. In addition to Stanford and Pac-10 leaders
Washington and Arizona. Arizona State, UCLA
and Oregon, the Cardinal's opponent Saturday,
make the cut.
With the Pac-10 season still not half over, it
doesn't mean much, but it's a barometer of how far
Stanford has climbed in three weeks since their
upset win over Arizona.
Head coach Trent Johnson felt the turnaround
occurred one week prior, in Stanford's narrow loss
at Washington. Little agrees.
"It's obvious that we've been playing well since
that game," Little said. "It was definitely the best
game that we had played all year, playing against a
good team, on the road in a very hostile environ
ment. We showed up."
Stanford is 4-1 since the loss and is all alone in
third place in the Pac-10 standings. As Washington
and UCLA proved last year, a perfect or horrid
start guarantees nothing in the wacky Pac-10. The
Huskies began conference play 0-5 before rattling

off 12 wins in their next 13 conference games to
earn an at-large bid. The Bruins were 5-0 in Pac-10
play before plummeting and missing the tourna
ment.
"We didn't overthink it when we were losing,"
Little said. "We just needed to play together and
play within ourselves. We're getting better shots
out of everyone."
That includes junior forward Matt Haryasz. who
scored 32 points in Stanford's sweep of the Los An
geles schools last weekend. Leading scorer Dan
Grunfeld continued to get good looks as well, scor
ing 45 points on 13-for-23 shooting to earn Pac-10
Player of the Week honors.
Last weekend's good fortune behind them and
Selection Sunday still too far away, there's no ques
tioning where Stanford's focus lies.
"Just because we got two wins in L.A. doesn't
put 20 points on the scoreboard on Thursday,"
Grunfeld said.
"If we lose to Oregon State, it's out the door,
we'll be out again," Little said. "We can't look too
far ahead."
