## Editorial Link DoorKings to cell phones 
### 
Insurance companies, landlords and even Stanford
Housing agree on a fundamental security measure
for housing on campus: Strangers should not be al
lowed to enter. To realistically enforce this policy,
the system that allows students to open their residence
hall doors for visitors should be improved.
The D(x>rKing system is what currently lets students
admit visitors into a building. The system conveniently al
lows residents to unlock their residence hall door when
visitors call them by a phone located near the residence
entrance.
However, only landline phone numbers can be pro
grammed into Door King, and over 30 percent of students
at Stanford lack landlines. This percentage is steadily in
creasing as cell phones, are becoming the norm for com
munication.
A frequent request from students is to enter their local
cell phone number into Door King. When Residental As
sistants had a conversation with Gene Awakuni, vice
provost for Student Affairs, in the fall of 2003, they asked
him if the Door King system could be changed to allow
students to open their residence hall door without having
to connect through the landline phone service.
In response, Awakuni said, "Student Housing staff
has met with the Door King vendor about the capabilities
for the upgraded software package that will be installed
for fall 2004. New technology will allow fora certain num
ber of local area codes to be programmed into the system
so that visitors can call a resident's cell phone (as long as
it is within the designated area codes)."
However, this planned reform never materialized.
One possible reason for this could be Residential Com
puting's reluctance to create more incentive for students

to forgo a subscription to a landline in their rooms.
In a Daily article published earlier this year ("Land
lines losing out to cell phones," 0ct.1,2004), Ethan Rik
leen. Residential Computing Network and Systems ad
ministrator. mentioned that as fewer and fewer people
get landline phone service from ITSS, it collects less and
less money to cover the network infrastructure cost. As a
result of fewer people subscribing to landlines, the costs
for having a landline connection went up this year.
Rikleen said that 60 percent of the in-room fee goes to
Networking Systems at ITSS, which manages the resi
dential network in partnership with residential comput
ing. If landlines ceased to exist on campus and cell phones
became the norm. Networking Systems and ITSS would
lose a great deal of revenue.
However, we hope Student Housing is not linking es
sential services to outdated technologies — in this case,
the landline. Loss of revenue for Networking Systems
and ITSS would not be a justifiable reason fora delay in
the implementation of the upgraded Door King system
that would allow cell phones to let in visitors.
Some students are even willing to pay for this ex
panded Door King functionality. In fact, a small frac
tion of students keep their landlines simply for access to
Door King. If Networking Systems and ITSS charged
students for linking their cell phones to the Door King
system, they could probably generate more revenue
than they are with the current system. This situation
would be win-win for both students and the University,
as students would have improved access to a valuable
security service and the University could upgrade their
outdated Door King system while making more money
on a service students need.
