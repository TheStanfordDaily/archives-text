# The 						Good Life
## Amid classes, find yourself in college 
### JULIE PARK 
Like so many others before me, I
came to Stanford, in part, to find myself.
I'm not on schedule. My time here
is running out. Two years have lapsed,
and while I have some ideas on what I
would do with my post-college life in
an ideal world, my parents frown upon
my apparent inability to figure out
how to make a living. What have I
been doing here?
Freshman year lingers as a blur of
faces, hit-or-miss classes and conver
sations, and stubborn sleep debt. Like
a book re-read at a later date, sopho
more year held happy surprises along
side the expected; yet my struggles on
what! should do with my life increased
in intensity. The book on that very
topic ("What Should I Do With My
Life?" by a Stanford grad) left me with
the realization that many of us may
never have that sudden epiphany to
swipe clean our petite existential
dilemmas.
It's a little disheartening. But take
the natural curiosity that got you here
and keeps you going to class, and
pause fora moment. We don't worry
about where lunch is going to come
from when we're in Green trying to
find books whose call numbers seem
to have disappeared. Unfortunately,
the reality is that fuzzy majors are not
the only ones in danger of eating Cup
o' Nwidles every meal post-gradua
tion. (Watch out, econ majors... It

could happen to you. Too bad it will
definitely happen to me.)
What I like to do, though, is hear
the news before disaster strikes.
Sometimes you need to grab some
post-college adults in and away from
the university setting so that you,
Charlie Rose wannabe, can interview
them. It's fun ... talking to more ex
perienced people, that is. Still, talking
to 30-somethings (who still vividly re
member feeling angst during college)
probably won't automatically allevi
ate the questions of what to do. how to
do it and why we live the way we do.
I talked to a few working adults
over the summer only to catch
glimpses of talent, bitterness, resign
and struggle. I don't like that combi
nation. Sometimes observing the lives
of others affirms the importance of
that constant scourge of ideals, money.
Sometimes it may encourage us to
hold on to our pipe dreams. Stories of
aspiring novelists with master's in fine
arts and credit-card debt depress me.
Luckily for unwavering pre-meds.
there is no such thing as a starving doc
tor — unless you get sued.
But it's kind of nice to know college
students are not alone in the search for
direction and meaning. Being 35 years
old does not mean you will know what
to do with your life. Neither does being
55. My parents should get accustomed
to frowning at my inconclusive re
sponses to their straightforward
queries. The parental "follow your

heart" mantra, no longer heard with
much frequency these days, has given
way to lectures on self-reliance and
being practical.
In the end. 1 get peeved at the math.
In the Bay Area, a recent graduate of
beauty school can make the same
salary as a teacher with a Stanford
master's degree in education, but nei
ther job pays enough for you to buy an
average house in this area.
You can think about this some
more. But there simply isn't enough
time left to dwell on anxiety. Like
many of you, I'm already a junior.
Reaching the midpoint of college, you
realize, if you haven't already, that you
don't have any time left to squander
feeling dejected about that midterm
you scored below the mean on. You
don't have time to lay awake in bed at
night obsessing about your future.
This merely detracts from the amount
of fun you can have while still in col
lege — this brief and precious time in
your life.
There's plenty of time to reflect
and mull over your life goals after
graduation, when you're alone, full of
angst and ambition, eating ramen in
your apartment.

Like so many others before me, I
came to Stanford, in part, to find myself.
I'm not on schedule. My time here
is running out. Two years have lapsed,
and while I have some ideas on what I
would do with my post-college life in
an ideal world, my parents frown upon
my apparent inability to figure out
how to make a living. What have I
been doing here?
Freshman year lingers as a blur of
faces, hit-or-miss classes and conver
sations, and stubborn sleep debt. Like
a book re-read at a later date, sopho
more year held happy surprises along
side the expected; yet my struggles on
what! should do with my life increased
in intensity. The book on that very
topic ("What Should I Do With My
Life?" by a Stanford grad) left me with
the realization that many of us may
never have that sudden epiphany to
swipe clean our petite existential
dilemmas.
It's a little disheartening. But take
the natural curiosity that got you here
and keeps you going to class, and
pause fora moment. We don't worry
about where lunch is going to come
from when we're in Green trying to
find books whose call numbers seem
to have disappeared. Unfortunately,
the reality is that fuzzy majors are not
the only ones in danger of eating Cup
o' Nwidles every meal post-gradua
tion. (Watch out, econ majors... It

could happen to you. Too bad it will
definitely happen to me.)
What I like to do, though, is hear
the news before disaster strikes.
Sometimes you need to grab some
post-college adults in and away from
the university setting so that you,
Charlie Rose wannabe, can interview
them. It's fun ... talking to more ex
perienced people, that is. Still, talking
to 30-somethings (who still vividly re
member feeling angst during college)
probably won't automatically allevi
ate the questions of what to do. how to
do it and why we live the way we do.
I talked to a few working adults
over the summer only to catch
glimpses of talent, bitterness, resign
and struggle. I don't like that combi
nation. Sometimes observing the lives
of others affirms the importance of
that constant scourge of ideals, money.
Sometimes it may encourage us to
hold on to our pipe dreams. Stories of
aspiring novelists with master's in fine
arts and credit-card debt depress me.
