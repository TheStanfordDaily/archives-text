Anti- and pro-abortion
groups both do not address
the other side
Reading recent letters to the ed
itor has made me realize that both
sides of the abortion "debate" are
talking past each other: Neither
side acknowledges the other's ar
guments or offers relevant coun
terarguments. The labels them
selves demonstrate my point: Pro
life and pro-choice do not even ad
dress the same issue.
Abortion foes offer a straight
forward argument: Killing humans,
no matter how young, is murder;
murder is wrong; therefore, abor
tion is wrong. On an entirely differ
ent plane of existence, supporters of
abortion rights posit that a woman
owns herself and should have liber
ty to choose what to do with her
own body; therefore, abortion
should be legal. Clearly, these argu
ments cannot both be correct, be
cause their conclusions contradict.
Society has given the abortion
issue taboo status, and that needs

to end. People need to start poking
holes in their opponents' argu
ments. Allow me to start:
Pto-choicers, a person's free
dom to act ends when that action
infringes upon another's rights. I
do not have the choice to enslave,
nor do I have the freedom to mur
der. If a fetus has a right to live,
then a woman's choice becomes
moot.
On the other hand, pro-lifers, I
challenge you to identify those
characteristics a fetus possesses
that grant it rights. Given that a
fetus starts as a sac of a few cells,
given that it cannot think or feel
until later in development, given
that it is not autonomous, how
could it possibly earn the right to
think or feel or be autonomous —
such as the right to life? Just like 1
do not have the "right" to fly by
flapping my arms, a fetus cannot
have the right to life without first
being conscious.
Suddenly, the real differences
become apparent: One side be
lieves rights are inherent to all

human beings, regardless of men
tal or physical development; the
other side holds that rights are as
signed only to those who have the
capacity to act on those rights.
We need to stop allowing room
for equivocation in this debate.
Life and choice are values that
most people defend. Let's stop
using these misnomers and address
the real issues surrounding abor
tion.

Daily's portrayal of
Beer Pong inaccurate
It is a bit ironic that in the same
issue in which The Daily gives col
umn space to the anti-inauguration
protestors who believe their event
was covered unfairly. The Daily
would choose to run on its front
page the most staged photo I have
ever seen in any newspaper ("Sink
the Red Cups," Jan. 26).
1 do not know what the photog

rapher thinks Beirut is. but I can
assure him it does not involve an
entire bag of solo cups, arranged in
straight lines. Furthermore, people
seldom play in pajama pants.

Call it Beer Pong/ not Beirut
Yesterday's edition of The Daily
promoted thefacebook.com's lat
est scheme to snag college stu
dents: a nationwide drinking con
test ("Sink the Red Cups," Jan.
26). I'd like to think that creator
Mark Zuckerberg was drunk when
he chose to use the term "Beirut"
as opposed to "Beer Pong" when
announcing the game.
For, how would anyone feel if
people enjoyed their drunken
nights simulating the attacks of 9 /
11 or Pearl Harbor? People would
reel in disgust if a game was named
Auschwitz and emulated genocide
by gassing.
I was ama/ed when I came to

Stanford and heard that people
were playing a game called Beirut.
Initially, I was excited that a game
was actually named after my
hometown, hut when I asked why it
was called Beirut, the reply horri
fied me: Ping-pong balls being
thrown into cups represent bombs
being dropped on Beirut.
To put it into perspective, those
bombs that you are dropping so
competitively led to the death or
injury of almost 4(X),000 people,
and drove 1,750,000 people from
their homes, among which almost a
million left Lebanon permanently.
Next time you are enjoying a
beer with your friends, have some
respect for the millions of people
who were directly affected by
those bombs being dropped on
Beirut — call it Beer-Pong. Mark
Zuckerberg, despite his en
trepreneurial genius, dropped the
ball on this one.

was called Beirut, the reply horri
fied me: Ping-pong balls being
thrown into cups represent bombs
being dropped on Beirut.
To put it into perspective, those
bombs that you are dropping so
competitively led to the death or
injury of almost 4(X),000 people,
and drove 1,750,000 people from
their homes, among which almost a
million left Lebanon permanently.
Next time you are enjoying a
beer with your friends, have some
respect for the millions of people
who were directly affected by
those bombs being dropped on
Beirut — call it Beer-Pong. Mark
Zuckerberg, despite his en
trepreneurial genius, dropped the
ball on this one.

Anti- and pro-abortion
groups both do not address
the other side
Reading recent letters to the ed
itor has made me realize that both
sides of the abortion "debate" are
talking past each other: Neither
side acknowledges the other's ar
guments or offers relevant coun
terarguments. The labels them
selves demonstrate my point: Pro
life and pro-choice do not even ad
dress the same issue.
Abortion foes offer a straight
forward argument: Killing humans,
no matter how young, is murder;
murder is wrong; therefore, abor
tion is wrong. On an entirely differ
ent plane of existence, supporters of
abortion rights posit that a woman
owns herself and should have liber
ty to choose what to do with her
own body; therefore, abortion
should be legal. Clearly, these argu
ments cannot both be correct, be
cause their conclusions contradict.
Society has given the abortion
issue taboo status, and that needs

to end. People need to start poking
holes in their opponents' argu
ments. Allow me to start:
Pto-choicers, a person's free
dom to act ends when that action
infringes upon another's rights. I
do not have the choice to enslave,
nor do I have the freedom to mur
der. If a fetus has a right to live,
then a woman's choice becomes
moot.
On the other hand, pro-lifers, I
challenge you to identify those
characteristics a fetus possesses
that grant it rights. Given that a
fetus starts as a sac of a few cells,
given that it cannot think or feel
until later in development, given
that it is not autonomous, how
could it possibly earn the right to
think or feel or be autonomous —
such as the right to life? Just like 1
do not have the "right" to fly by
flapping my arms, a fetus cannot
have the right to life without first
being conscious.
Suddenly, the real differences
become apparent: One side be
lieves rights are inherent to all

human beings, regardless of men
tal or physical development; the
other side holds that rights are as
signed only to those who have the
capacity to act on those rights.
We need to stop allowing room
for equivocation in this debate.
Life and choice are values that
most people defend. Let's stop
using these misnomers and address
the real issues surrounding abor
tion.

Daily's portrayal of
Beer Pong inaccurate
It is a bit ironic that in the same
issue in which The Daily gives col
umn space to the anti-inauguration
protestors who believe their event
was covered unfairly. The Daily
would choose to run on its front
page the most staged photo I have
ever seen in any newspaper ("Sink
the Red Cups," Jan. 26).
1 do not know what the photog

rapher thinks Beirut is. but I can
assure him it does not involve an
entire bag of solo cups, arranged in
straight lines. Furthermore, people
seldom play in pajama pants.

Call it Beer Pong/ not Beirut
Yesterday's edition of The Daily
promoted thefacebook.com's lat
est scheme to snag college stu
dents: a nationwide drinking con
test ("Sink the Red Cups," Jan.
26). I'd like to think that creator
Mark Zuckerberg was drunk when
he chose to use the term "Beirut"
as opposed to "Beer Pong" when
announcing the game.
For, how would anyone feel if
people enjoyed their drunken
nights simulating the attacks of 9 /
11 or Pearl Harbor? People would
reel in disgust if a game was named
Auschwitz and emulated genocide
by gassing.
I was ama/ed when I came to

Stanford and heard that people
were playing a game called Beirut.
Initially, I was excited that a game
was actually named after my
hometown, hut when I asked why it
was called Beirut, the reply horri
fied me: Ping-pong balls being
thrown into cups represent bombs
being dropped on Beirut.
