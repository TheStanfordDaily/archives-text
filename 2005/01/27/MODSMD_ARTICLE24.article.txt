## We have to make it work 
### 
Loving this country, much
like loving a person, is quite
a task.Sometimes you fight.
When I think about all the
things the United States has done
that 1 have been a part of —
whether it was with tax dollars, with
history or with participation —it
makes me so angry and sad that I
don't know what to do.
But much like having a fight with
someone you love, there's a choice:
You can let anger win and let it de
stroy the rela-

tionship, or you
can choose love
and forgiveness.
It's not always
an easy decision
to make, and it
can take a lot of
deliberation and
self-reflection.
Personally, I
have chosen to

forgive. Being
angry feels righteous and dignified,
hut that's not a sentiment that can
last too long before it begins to de
stroy you.
It doesn't mean you forget, how
ever— on the contrary, it means
you work harder to resolve differ
ences.
If you just forgave, relationships
would never get any better. 1 have a
confession to make: I am a Trekkie.
What I loved most about Star
Trek was the fact that humanity had
finally made something of itself; hu
manity had finally gotten its crap to
gether to start accomplishing things
together.
I still believe we can get there —
and probably someplace even better
— but that means we have to start
asking questions of ourselves.
Where are we, and I mean every
one — minorities, majorities and in
betweens — all going?
What's going to happen with
Iraq? What's going to happen with

urban poverty?
Illiteracy? Increasing Latino
populations? Will the monochro
matic nature of Hollywood, Wash
ington, D.C., and corporate Ameri
ca ever change to reflect reality?
What does it all mean? The older
I get, the more complicated life be
comes. But in the end, I feel it's the
simple things that count.
I understand that I am young, but
Iraq seems to be nearing a critical
point in which everyone's life — in
one way or another — is affected.
I have friends on the other side of
that ocean, and family. What's to
become of them? Is it possible to
squelch a spirit that refuses to be
squelched? How do Stanford stu
dents and soldiers and politicians
and businesses and citizens in differ
ent parts of the world fit into a pic
ture together? Is there even room?
Can we make it work?
We have to make it work. We can
make it work. As cynical as 1 have
become, I still believe that humani
ty is capable of beautiful things —
the fantasy of Star Trek had to come
from somewhere. And I am writing
directly to you, to Stanford students,
because I know that you know that
we are the future and have opportu
nities to create a better world that
not too many other people enjoy.
I know I should probably end my
last column of the volume with some
amazing quote or incredible ending,
but all I can say is that, one day, I
want to be able to tell my children
that I tried to make this world a bet
ter place for them, and I don't want
to lie.
