## Track teams on their marks Cardinal men and women set to open seasons Friday 
### RACHEL HODARA 
The men's and women's indoor track
season will kick off Friday in Boise, Idaho
at the Body Building.com Invitational and
continue Saturday in Seattle. Wash., at the
Washington Invitational.
Men's head coach Robert Weir says he
thinks of this first meet as a chance to see
il his athletes are mentally and physically
prepared to compete.
"I expect to have a much better season
than we had last year." Weir said. "1 want
to use this as a building season to carry us
into the outdoor season."
The core strength of the Stanford
men's team lies in its middle distance
and distance runners. Middle distance
starts at 800 meters, and Weir expects
this event as well as the 3000 and 5000
meter events to be the strongest part of
the Cardinal program.
"This is where the top recruits were
and where the top results and perfor
mances will come from." Weir said.
"The goal of the season is to try to get
more athletes qualified for indoor nation
als than we had last year," Weir said.
The first meet for indoor track is real
ly about seeing how the new college ath
letes handle the pressure and intensity
and assessing the performances of re
turning athletes.
"We don't want to put too much pres
sure on the athletes this early in the sea
son" Weir said, although he does want to
get the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion qualifying times out of the way.
The men lost several of their top per
formers last year, but Weir has his eye on
several young athletes and a few returning
middle distance runners. Three freshmen
Weir says to look out for are Garrett
Heath, a distance runner, and Graeme
Hoste and Benjamin Dickens, two pole
vaulters.

Sophomore Joaquin Chapa, who fin
ished seventh in the 800 meters at the Pac
-10 Championships last year, returns, and
senior Evan Fox should perform well in
the middle distance events as well.
Redshirt freshman Mike Macellari. an
offensive lineman for the Cardinal football
team, will throw shotput for the track team.
On the women's side, head coach
Edrick Floreal is excited about the up
coming season.
"This first meet is really about seeing
what the tone will be for the rest of the
year," Floreal said. "You look at your main
competitors and see how people compete."
About 20 Stanford women will be trav
eling to Boise and Seattle this weekend,
and Floreal expects to assess the team and
see how the freshmen perform in their first
collegiate track competition.
Freshmen jumper Erica McLain and
middle distance runner Lauren Cen
trowitz are two new Cardinal women to
watch this season. Floreal has high hopes
for junior distance runner Anita Siraki
and twin sophomore middle distance
runners Amanda and Katy Trotter. All
three had stellar cross country seasons
ranking third, fifth, and fourth, respec
tively, for the Cardinal at the NCAA
Championships.
Unlike the men's team, which lacks
competitive sprinters, the girls have a
strong group of sprinters raring to go. Ju
nior Nashonme Johnson, sophomore Jan
ice Davis and senior Christine Moschella
are three sprinters Floreal is eager to see
compete.
The first indoor track meet for the Car
dinal should be a learning experience for
both new and returning runners.
"To run indoor track you have to be a
smarter, more tactical runner," Floreal
said. "Indoor track is more hectic."
This is because the track is half the size
of the outdoor track that most runners are
used to from high school. The track is 200
meters (half the length of an outdoor
track), and half the width, leaving less
room for the runners and less room for
error.
"You can't make your move on the
turns in indoor track because you only

have 50 meters to work with," Floreal
said. "So you have to make your move
on the 50 meter straightaway, which

doesn't leave much room. A mile race of
12 runners on the indoor track can get
tight."
