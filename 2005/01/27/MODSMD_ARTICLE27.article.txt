# Miles from home, Pintchouk shines

### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the No. 30 women's gymnastics team (0-1)
takes the floor for its first home meet on Friday night,
spectators will see a drastically different team from last
season, with five new freshmen sporting the Cardinal
leotard. One of the most exciting aspects of the fresh
man class is the energy and style they bring to the Car
dinal's performance on floor.
"These freshmen just love to perform." head coach
Kristen Smyth said.
One of the Cardinal's five freshmen, Alexandra
Pintchouk, will lead off for the Cardinal on floor exer
cise.
"Showmanship is the highlight of Pintchouk's rou
tine," said fellow freshman Lauren Elmore, who will
compete in the All-Around on Friday night.
Pintchouk gets her showmanship on floor exercise
from her Russian mother, who was also her longtime
gymnastics coach.
As a young child, Pintchouk emigrated from Russia
to the United States with her mother, who found a
coaching position at a New Jersey gymnastics club. The
gym was little Pintchouk's playground, and at the age of
11, she decided to make that playground her training
ground. Her mother started coaching her and continued

to do so until Pintchouk left for Stanford this past au
tumn.
Pintchouk picked up her mother's love for floor ex
ercise — both enjoy the dance, the expression and the
tumbling skills. A chip off the old block, Pintchouk
started choreographing floor routines for recreational
gymnasts at her mother's gym last summer and hopes to
continue doing so well after her career in gymnastics is
over.
Pintchouk. who is the only Stanford gymnast to have
choreographed her own routine, told her mother that
she was nervous Smyth wouldn't like the routine, but
Smyth made only minor changes to it. So far, the judges
seem to like it; they gave it a 9.70 at last weekend's meet
against Washington.
Pintchouk called her mother after the meet to tell
her how she did.
"She told me, I'm really proud of you, you can only
improve from here,"' Pintchouk said. "It made me feel
happy, it was like old times a little bit."
"The biggest challenge of coming to Stanford was
leaving my mom who has always been with me in and
out of the gym,'' Pintchouk said. "We were coach and
gymnast in the gym and mother and daughter at home .
.. doing both really strengthened our relationship."

The Stanford women's gymnastics team hosts Ore
gon State on Friday night.
Although the transition was dif
ficult, Pintchouk has adjusted well
and appreciates having the fresh
perspective of her new coaches at
Stanford. Sometimes, however, she
still calls home to ask mom what
she is doing wrong in her bar rou
tine or on her tumbling passes.
"She tells me, 'I can't see what
you're doing, just listen to your
coaches,"' Pintchouk said with a
laugh.
Having five fellow freshmen as
teammates has certainly eased the
transition for Pintchouk. Although
she was initially nervous to be join
ing a team where two of the six
freshmen competed at Olympic tri
als. Pintchouk said she now feels at
home with her team.
"I feel comfortable going to any
of them," Pintchouk said. "We
have so many different personali
ties, but they all complement one

Card's five frosh
are a diverse lot

another."
The personalities do cover a
wide range — Elmore calls her
self quiet and shy, while
Pintchouk describes herself as
loud and crazy. The two said that
there is also a very caring fresh
man, an outgoing freshman, a stu
dious freshman and a freshman
who adds comic relief.
"It's like having our own little
posse," Elmore said.
The freshmen's ability to work
with one another and with the five
upperclassmen will be integral to
the team's success. Although gym
nastics is often thought to be an in
dividual sport, college gymnastics
is focused on the team. Pintchouk
and Elmore said the biggest differ
ence they have encountered in col
lege gymnastics is feeling that team
focus.
"The atmosphere is much more

team-oriented." Pintchouk said.
"I've never had so many team
mates cheering for me and focusing
on my routines ... it's more fun
that way. Instead of getting butter
flies. I just get excited."
"It's often more exciting to see
my teammates hit good routines
than it is for me to hit a good rou
tine," Elmore said.
Although the team is not at full
strength right now due to injuries,
the Cardinal have a good chance to
beat No. 14 Oregon State (3-2).
Having just competed against the
top two teams in the country, Utah
and UCLA, Oregon State will be
hungry fora win. But with a pre
season rank of No. 3, Stanford will
be a tough team to beat.
The meet will likely come down
to the last event: floor exercise.
Pintchouk will likely start the show
on floor for her teammates.
