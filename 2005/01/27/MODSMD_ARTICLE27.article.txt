# Miles from home, Pintchouk shines

### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the No. 30 women's gymnastics team (0-1)
takes the floor for its first home meet on Friday night,
spectators will see a drastically different team from last
season, with five new freshmen sporting the Cardinal
leotard. One of the most exciting aspects of the fresh
man class is the energy and style they bring to the Car
dinal's performance on floor.
"These freshmen just love to perform." head coach
Kristen Smyth said.
One of the Cardinal's five freshmen, Alexandra
Pintchouk, will lead off for the Cardinal on floor exer
cise.
"Showmanship is the highlight of Pintchouk's rou
tine," said fellow freshman Lauren Elmore, who will
compete in the All-Around on Friday night.
Pintchouk gets her showmanship on floor exercise
from her Russian mother, who was also her longtime
gymnastics coach.
As a young child, Pintchouk emigrated from Russia
to the United States with her mother, who found a
coaching position at a New Jersey gymnastics club. The
gym was little Pintchouk's playground, and at the age of
11, she decided to make that playground her training
ground. Her mother started coaching her and continued

to do so until Pintchouk left for Stanford this past au
tumn.
Pintchouk picked up her mother's love for floor ex
ercise â€” both enjoy the dance, the expression and the
tumbling skills. A chip off the old block, Pintchouk
started choreographing floor routines for recreational
gymnasts at her mother's gym last summer and hopes to
continue doing so well after her career in gymnastics is
over.
Pintchouk. who is the only Stanford gymnast to have
choreographed her own routine, told her mother that
she was nervous Smyth wouldn't like the routine, but
Smyth made only minor changes to it. So far, the judges
seem to like it; they gave it a 9.70 at last weekend's meet
against Washington.
Pintchouk called her mother after the meet to tell
her how she did.
"She told me, I'm really proud of you, you can only
improve from here,"' Pintchouk said. "It made me feel
happy, it was like old times a little bit."
"The biggest challenge of coming to Stanford was
leaving my mom who has always been with me in and
out of the gym,'' Pintchouk said. "We were coach and
gymnast in the gym and mother and daughter at home .
.. doing both really strengthened our relationship."
