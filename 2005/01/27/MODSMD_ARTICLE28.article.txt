## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Two Saturdays ago, the men's basket
ball team traveled to Berkeley and defeat
ed the Bears as part of its recent four
game winning streak. This Saturday, the
No. 7 men's tennis team will travel to Cal,
where it hopes to spark a winning streak
of its own.
The match against the No. 28 Golden
Bears is scheduled to begin at 12:30 at
Berkeley's Hellman Tennis Center and will
be a good test of where both teams stand as
they open up the season.
In 2(X)4. Stanford and Cal met twice dur
ing the season, with each team winning on
their respective home courts. The Cardinal
claimed a 5-2 victory when the teams met in
February, but were upset 4-3 by the Golden
Bears in April.
While the Bears, which will take on
Santa Clara today, are ranked 28th in the
ITA poll. Stanford is well aware that the
team may be underrated.
"This is Cal. and it's our first match,"
head coach John Whitlinger said.
"They're better than 28, and we better be
ready to play them. We're preparing and

we've had good days of practice. This is
like a test or a quiz, and after the match,
we'll know what to work on. what things
to do."
There will likely be more Cal fans in at
tendance, but that does not faze junior KC
Corkery.
"It's always fun having people out
there," he said. "For me anyways, whether
they're cheering for you or against you. I
just feel that it's fun having people out
watching the match."
Whitlinger agreed that the atmosphere
will be exciting and the start of the match is
key.
"Peter Wright's a great coach and does a
great job with those guys, and keeps them
fired up and battling, he said. "If you give
the crowd a reason to cheer, they're going
to go crazy for Cal. I think the way we start
that match is pretty important."
Stanford began its winter quarter play at
the Sherwood Cup two weeks ago in Thou
sand Oaks, Calif.
Senior Sam Warburg and junior Jon
Wong were the only Stanford players to
advance past the first round in singles,
and Warburg was then eliminated in the
quarterfinals.

In the consolation singles bracket,
sophomore James Wan defeated fellow
Cardinal freshman and doubles teammate
Phil Kao.
The Cardinal fared well in doubles, ad
vancing three pairs to the quarterfinals of
the tournament. However, only Warburg
and Wong advanced to the semifinals.
The pairing's results were surprising con
sidering that Warburg usually plays with
Corkery.
But. because Corkery and Warburg
won the NCAA doubles title last May. it is
likely that the two will remain partners
this season.
"I felt like if I went down to the tourna
ment and did have some injuries, that
would not be productive, considering I
might injure myself more so." Corkery said.
"Nothing was really preventing me from
playing. I just wanted to make sure I was
healthy for this weekend."
While Stanford was competing in the
Sherwood Cup. Berkeley traveled to Puer
to Rico to compete in the Puerto Rican
Tennis Invitational with schools like No. 5
Illinois. No. 17 TCU and No. 35 Georgia
Tech. The Bears tallied a total of 18 wins in
Puerto Rico, including some impressive

ones.
The No. 30 doubles tandem of senior
Patrick Briaud and junior Conor Niland
scored an 8-6 upset against TCU's No. 8
pairing of Fabrizio Sestini and Rafael
Abreu.
Niland is also ranked 21st in singles
and played in Cal's top singles spot in
2003-04. notching 10 consecutive wins at
one point.
In the Wilson / ITA Regional Champi
onships in October. Briaud and Niland ad
vanced to the finals, where they faced War
burg and Corkery; the Cardinal duo pre
vailed with an 8-2 victory.
However, in singles, Corkery was de
feated in the quarterfinals 6-1, 6-0 by Cal's
No. 27 Lennart Maack, a transfer from the
University of Pacific.
"They've got a very deep team all the
way down the lineup," Corkery said. "For
us, we're kind of looking forward to getting
the season started off.
"It's always a tough match, going up and
playing at Cal. but we've been working
hard this past fall and we're kind of hoping
to see where we're at and see how much
more we need to improve as the season
goes out."
