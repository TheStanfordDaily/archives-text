# The
						Double Clutch
## Renovated Maples Pavilion has lost some of its old luster 
### 
Well, now that we're all familiar with it,
the verdict is in on the renovated
Maples Pavilion.
It's not good. The brightly painted but one
dimensional interior makes the Meyer Library
look tasteful. It has the feel of a low-rent NBA
facility rather than a college

fieldhouse. In addition to
blowing who knows how
much money expanding the
concourse, the remodel (de
model?) neutered the arena's
esprit and punished the peo
ple who made Maples into the
intimidating, hostile snakepit
it was.
Former Sixth Man Com
mittee member Rustin Mc-
Cullum feels the distinctive
character of the facility has
been destroyed.

"I really liked the fact that we had a small,
dingy arena, with no frills, and all we did was
win. It wasn't flashy, it wasn't comfortable for
the opposition, and it gave us a real advantage.
Now Maples is just another basketball arena."
McCullum cites the since-replaced springy
floor.
Only graduate students and longtime fans
will remember when Arizona came to Maples
in February 2000 against top-ranked Stanford.
As the Wildcats' Jason Gardner went to the
free throw line late in the game, the 6th Man
section jumped on the bleachers with such
force that the court itself was shaking.
The officials threatened to assess a techni
cal foul on the crowd for disrupting play.
The Sixth Man Club floor bleachers, now
double-wide, require two rows of fans to pack
in each tier. This punishes shorter spectators,
girls especially. There is no place for students
to stash coats and sweatshirts, which inadver
tently get stepped on.
And only half the section can sit down. For
those with joint or muscle ailments — or just
plain fatigue — even a few minutes' rest at
halftime can mean a world of relief.
Nor does the new oversized video score
board impress McCullum.
"The corner boards were easy to read at a
glance. Now we have to crane our necks to
read it, and at every timeout we're bombarded
with loud video advertisements."
I thought this was the domain of movie the
aters, which promote attorneys and shopping
malls before the film plays. I guess I was naive.
Apparently the next step in the so-called
'arms race' of college sports is to turn your fa
cilities into giant audiovisual billboards and
hold the fans hostage to commercials from
dawn to dusk. This development is bizarre
when one considers that several years ago the
athletic department dedicated itself to remov
ing placard ads from Maples and Stanford Sta
dium.
The Band was none too happy, either. Ac
cording to the LSJUMB, they were told their
drum kit would not fit in the new band section
due to code, that they would not be allowed to
field their standard 60-person unit and that
they would not get to play as often during
games so that the scoreboard could show ads.
(The drum kit was eventually brought back in
a compromise.)
But it's not just students complaining.
