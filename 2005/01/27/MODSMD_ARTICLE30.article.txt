# First place in Pac-10 on the line as Arizona and UW square off
## 
### Roman Veytsman Arizona Daily Wildcat (U. Arizona 
(U-WIRE) TUCSON. Ariz. - With 16 straight years
of 20 wins or more under your belt, opposing teams
tend to notice your success. The Arizona men's bas
ketball team knows this and expects nothing less any
time it steps on the court.
"Our players know that when they come here, you
stick an Arizona jersey on your chest and you are
never going to get anybody's second effort," said
head coach Lute Olson. "We've been used to being
the hunted since '85-86."
Rarely are the Wildcats the underdog, but with
No. 10 Washington coming to McKale Center Thurs
day and the Huskies having knocked off No. 11 Ari
zona three times last season, U A becomes the hunter
rather than the hunted.
" Especially, me being my senior year and us in the
situation that we're in with the Pac-10 being so
tight," said senior center Channing Frye, "it can't get
much bigger than the next game."
Big games have become a scarcity over the past
two seasons in the Pac-10 as the conference has been
less than dominant according to Associated Press
polls.
The conference hasn't seen more than two ranked
teams play each other since 2003 and when top-25
squads do match up. the Wildcats are usually in
volved because over the last 17 years, Arizona has
ended up in the season's final polls.
"When you have Arizona on your chest, every
body is out to get you." junior guard Hassan Adams
said.
Last season, UA Pac-10 marquee matchups were
against Stanford, which was ranked No. 4 in the first
game and No. 2 in the second game. Although UA
lost both games, the experience gained by the young
Arizona players on the team came from facing qual

ity opponents.
"It's a big game whether you're playing against
Stanford last year and Stanford here and Washing
ton last year too," Adams said. "We take the game
and play like it's your last."
Playing big games is also important to recruiting
because each incoming class understands that the
competition will be fierce when playing other ranked
opponents, and those games are often nationally
televised.
Olson understands that the team can't get too
hyped about big games.
He said former UCLA and Hall of Fame coach
John Wooden told him a valley always followed a
peak, reiterating that his team needs to stay at an
even height emotionally.
"The biggest thing that you could do is to hype the
game so much that your players go out tight," Olson
said.
He mentioned younger players learn more in
practice because of the amount of talent on the ros
ter than they do from most of the game, against
ranked opponents or not. When it comes to big
games, the younger players are already prepared for
the task of playing the best teams in the country.
Frye has played at Arizona for four years and has
faced 31 ranked opponents, including 15 against
ranked Pac-10 teams. The Wildcats have gone 20-11
in those games, including Frye's first game in 2001, in
which the Wildcats defeated No. 2 Maryland. Frye
was pushed into the action early in his career, play
ing 22 minutes and scoring four points in that win.
"Every game is huge," Frye said.
Not only will the game against Washington be
huge because of bragging rights, but also because
there is something more to play for -- the Pac-10 title.
Currently the Wildcats and Huskies are tied at the
top of the Pac-10 standings at 6-1, and the sole posi
tion at the Pac-10 peak will be up for grabs.
"The key thing from our standpoint is that we just
go out and play and have fun playing," Olson said.

John Wooden told him a valley always followed a
peak, reiterating that his team needs to stay at an
even height emotionally.
"The biggest thing that you could do is to hype the
game so much that your players go out tight," Olson
said.
He mentioned younger players learn more in
practice because of the amount of talent on the ros
ter than they do from most of the game, against
ranked opponents or not. When it comes to big
games, the younger players are already prepared for
the task of playing the best teams in the country.
Frye has played at Arizona for four years and has
faced 31 ranked opponents, including 15 against
ranked Pac-10 teams. The Wildcats have gone 20-11
in those games, including Frye's first game in 2001, in
which the Wildcats defeated No. 2 Maryland. Frye
was pushed into the action early in his career, play
ing 22 minutes and scoring four points in that win.
"Every game is huge," Frye said.
Not only will the game against Washington be
huge because of bragging rights, but also because
there is something more to play for -- the Pac-10 title.
Currently the Wildcats and Huskies are tied at the
top of the Pac-10 standings at 6-1, and the sole posi
tion at the Pac-10 peak will be up for grabs.
"The key thing from our standpoint is that we just
go out and play and have fun playing," Olson said.
