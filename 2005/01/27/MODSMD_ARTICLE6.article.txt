# Stanford's Sixth Man: Haas steps up for Card
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
When Chris Hernandez's name was not in the
starting lineup against Arizona State on Jan. 6, the ini
tial reaction among many in attendance was one of
surprise, ol fear, maybe even of panic. But if there was
one man in the building who was not surprised when
Hernandez suffered back spasms during warm-ups; it
was his replacement on the floor, junior point guard
Jason Haas.
Haas played 36 minutes — almost double his previ
ous season high — in that game, finishing with six
points, live assists and only one turnover in a Cardinal
loss. lor most players, that would have been a break
through. For I laas, it was a shrug.
"We always know that Chris's back can act up, so I
was ready to go," I laas said. "I was glad to have anoth
er opportunity to get out there and build confidence."
Haas has been worked into the rotation every game
since then, often alongside Hernandez in the back
court. after playing a total of nine minutes against
Washington and Washington State in the weekend be
fore the ASIJ game. He has replaced shooting guard
Tim Morris, who was put on academic probation, as the
team's sixth man on the court.
Haas leads the team with 20 assists in the last five
games, committing only eight turnovers in that span.
His minutes have risen from a scant 9.6 per contest over
the first 12 games to 25.4.
Before his breakout against Arizona State, was
Haas worried that he would be stuck backing up Her
nandez this season?
"Coach's fault, coach's fault," said head coach Trent
Johnson on his way out of practice. "And no, he wasn't
worried," Johnson added as he rounded the corner.
Haas agreed.
"1 have no say in [whether I play], so I can't com
plain when I don't get the minutes." he said. "We were
going through a pretty rough stretch as a team, so for
me to complain, especially then ..." His voice trails
off, as it he couldn't imagine that scenario.
1 laas has never been in a rush to get on the court. I le
felt he was too young to play college basketball when he
graduated high school at the age of 17, so he enrolled
fora fifth year at Blair Academy, a New Jersey prep
school.
" I think it's more common on the East coast," I laas
said. "I didn't want to reduce mv college eligibility, and

I got to play against some great basketball players. It
helped me to develop a lot."
This came on the heels of a senior season at Penns
Valley High School in Spring Mills. Pa. in which Haas
averaged 22 points and five assists per game on the way
to being named state MVP.
But in the end Haas' decision to take another year
paid off — Stanford was the last team to recruit him.
"When I told my dad that [assistant coach Tony
Fuller] called, a tear came to my eye," Haas said. "I al
ways wanted to play here growing up."
Fuller couldn't be happier that he recruited him.
'He's a coach's dream, a gentleman, the most sin
cere kid you'll ever meet, a great student, great athlete,
voter, taxpayer," Fuller said without even being asked,
and you got the feeling he would have kept going had
he not been walking into the locker room while he was
talking.
Hernandez is also happy for his practice rival.
"Jason's done a great job, he's doing exactly what
we expected," Hernandez said. "It gives us a different
feeling with me at the two, it's a good change-up. It's
nice to have someone else bringing up the ball fora
change."
Hernandez's scoring has shot up since Haas' inser
tion into the regular rotation. In the last four games —
including a game at UCLA in which Hernandez had the
flu and scored only four points — he has averaged 16.5
points, up from 12.9 before that point. The Cardinal are
running Hernandez off screens and he is moving with
out the ball, allowing him to get open shots without
having to create them off the dribble. His field goal per
centage is up from 44 percent to 53, and his three-point
percentage has jumped from 38 percent to 58.
Haas, for his part, is happy to have Hernandez
around as well.
" This is the third year I've gone up against Chris in
practice," Haas said. "He's great to play against. It's the
best thing that has ever happened to me as a basketball
player. We're able to push each other, and sometimes I
get the better of him. We feed off of each other's ener
gy and we always try to support each other on the
court."
At the beginning of the season, Haas was doing his
part and supporting his teammates.
"I just kept my mouth shut and tried to stay positive,
cheered my teammates on."
Now, they are relishing the chance to cheer him on.
Patience can be a virtue.
