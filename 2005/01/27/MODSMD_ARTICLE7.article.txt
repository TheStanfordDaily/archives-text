# Selfless Suminski enjoying a steady senior season
## 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Even after 1.000 points, more than 150 three pointers
and a dramatic last-second game-winning shot in the
Sweet Sixteen of the NCAAs, it's still all about the team
for Kelley Suminski.
Suminski, a senior guard on the Cardinal women's
basketball team (17-2,8-1 Pac-10), was on the preseason
Wooden Award list and has been a stalwart in the back
court for Stanford throughout her college career. Yet,
no matter how much you try to talk to her about her per
sonal accolades, somehow she manages to always throw
the attention back to her teammates.
Case in point: When asked about her selection to the
Wooden Award list, Suminski said, "It was an extreme
ly great honor. I was really surprised, because pretty
much any other member of the team could've been nom
inated."
Suminski has always been a quiet star, starting with
the prolific high school career that propelled her to Di
vision I basketball at Stanford. Named a Women's Bas
ketball Coaches Association Honorable Mention Ail-
American and listed as one of the "Top 10 Players of the
19905" in the Newark Star-Ledger, Suminski led Mend
ham High School to a 114-6 record in her four seasons.
While many of the other incoming freshman at Stan
ford were going through awkward social changes, Sum
inski was busy making an immediate impact for the Car
dinal. She was named to the Pac-10 Conference All-
Freshman Team after leading the conference in three
point percentage in 27 starts.
Suminski's success train didn't stop there. Rather, it
kept chugging along through her sophomore season, as
she was a first team All Pac-10 selection. She was an in
tegral part of last year's team, as she hit the last second
game winner that put the Cardinal past Vanderbilt in the
Sweet Sixteen.
When asked what her personal goals were coming
into the 2004-05 season, Suminski responded with an an
swer that was devoid of self.
"Individually, I'm trying to do whatever my team
needs," Suminski said. "If it's handling the ball, dis
tributing the ball, I'll do whatever is needed by the
team."
But in Suminski's eyes, the goal for the team is crys
tal clear.
"As a team we're all shooting fora national champi
onship," she said.
With the type of experience that Suminski has under
her belt, it's easy for her to place this year's team in the
context of several other great teams, including last
year's team starring current WNBA player Nicole Pow
ell.
"I think this team has more depth than the other
teams I've been on in the past," Suminski said. "We have
a lot more people contributing. This year we have so
many people that are stepping up and doing so well."
The Cardinal have three players averaging double
digits in points in Suminski. freshman guard Candice
Wiggins and junior center Brooke Smith.
With a roster boasting a strong balance of freshman
vigor and veteran leadership, the team has been surpris
ingly unified.
"This season we've had the most cohesive team,"
Suminski said. "We've been really close and get along
really well. I've got some best friends on this team."
Working together as one unit, the Cardinal team has
started to come together in the last few weeks.
"I think we had a tough challenge going on the road
in Arizona, and we came out with two key wins," Sum
inski said. "The past few games at home we've been
playing really well. We're on our way to success, but we

have a lot to improve on."
It's fair to say that with eight straight wins, the Stan
ford women are hitting their stride. And although the
Stanford roster is star-studded, it's also fair to say that
Suminski's consistently solid play in the backcourt may
be the most important factor in the Cardinal's success.
But good luck trying to convince Suminski of that.
When asked what her most long-lasting memory of
Stanford basketball would be, she replied, "The first
thing I'll always remember are my teammates."

American and listed as one of the "Top 10 Players of the
19905" in the Newark Star-Ledger, Suminski led Mend
ham High School to a 114-6 record in her four seasons.
While many of the other incoming freshman at Stan
ford were going through awkward social changes, Sum
inski was busy making an immediate impact for the Car
dinal. She was named to the Pac-10 Conference All-
Freshman Team after leading the conference in three
point percentage in 27 starts.
Suminski's success train didn't stop there. Rather, it
kept chugging along through her sophomore season, as
she was a first team All Pac-10 selection. She was an in
tegral part of last year's team, as she hit the last second
game winner that put the Cardinal past Vanderbilt in the
Sweet Sixteen.
When asked what her personal goals were coming
into the 2004-05 season, Suminski responded with an an
swer that was devoid of self.
"Individually, I'm trying to do whatever my team
needs," Suminski said. "If it's handling the ball, dis
tributing the ball, I'll do whatever is needed by the
team."
But in Suminski's eyes, the goal for the team is crys
tal clear.
"As a team we're all shooting fora national champi
onship," she said.
With the type of experience that Suminski has under
her belt, it's easy for her to place this year's team in the
context of several other great teams, including last
year's team starring current WNBA player Nicole Pow
ell.
"I think this team has more depth than the other
teams I've been on in the past," Suminski said. "We have
a lot more people contributing. This year we have so
many people that are stepping up and doing so well."
The Cardinal have three players averaging double

Wiggins and junior center Brooke Smith.
With a roster boasting a strong balance of freshman
vigor and veteran leadership, the team has been surpris
ingly unified.
"This season we've had the most cohesive team,"
Suminski said. "We've been really close and get along
really well. I've got some best friends on this team."
Working together as one unit, the Cardinal team has
started to come together in the last few weeks.
"I think we had a tough challenge going on the road
in Arizona, and we came out with two key wins," Sum
inski said. "The past few games at home we've been
playing really well. We're on our way to success, but we

have a lot to improve on."
It's fair to say that with eight straight wins, the Stan
ford women are hitting their stride. And although the
Stanford roster is star-studded, it's also fair to say that
Suminski's consistently solid play in the backcourt may
be the most important factor in the Cardinal's success.
But good luck trying to convince Suminski of that.
When asked what her most long-lasting memory of
Stanford basketball would be, she replied, "The first
thing I'll always remember are my teammates."
