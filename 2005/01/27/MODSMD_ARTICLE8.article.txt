## Faculty members play role in stem cell debate 
### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Institute for Cancer / Stem Cell Bi
ology and Medicine promises to conduct some of
the most advanced stem cell research in the coun
try in upcoming years, and several faculty mem
bers are involved in deciding how that research
should be carried out.
Legislation passed on both the national and
state levels could determine the future of stem cell
research at institutions and organizations
throughout the country, including Stanford.
Dr. Philip Pizzo, dean of the medical school,
will be directly involved in determining how Cali
fornia state funds will be distributed for stem cell
research. On the national level. Human Biology
Prof. William Hurlbut, who sits on the President's
Council on Bioethics, has been advising President
George W. Bush on the ethical issues surrounding
stem cell research and is developing a proposal
that he hopes will bring the country closer to a con
sensus on the issue. Biochemistry Emeritus Prof.
Paul Berg has also offered his counsel to national
politicians; though he does no stem cell research
himself, he is a strong advocate for it.
The varying opinions of these experts, and the
reasoning behind their convictions, demonstrate
the complexity and sensitivity of the debate on
stem cell research. While many acknowledge the
potential for great medical advances through stem
cell research, others find troubling the ethics be
hind the research.
Pizzo sits on the Independent Citizen's Over
sight Committee, or ICOC, which will distribute
funds approved for stem cell research in Califor

nia as a result of Prop. 71. Prior to the passage of
the proposition, he said he was careful not to cam
paign in any official capacity.
"I did advocate for Prop. 71 as a private citizen
and have certainly discussed the merits of stem
cell research in a number of public and private set
tings," he said.
Named to the ICOC on Nov. 5,2004, Pizzo will
help select members of three new committees
which will work with the ICOC to decide which re
search proposals to fund. The ICOC is the gov
erning body of the California Institute on Regen
erative Medicine, which was formed after the pas
sage of Prop.7l.
"Appointments to various committees within
the California Institute on Regenerative Medicine
will be done in an open, fair and merit-based man
ner," he said. "I believe excellent individuals will
be chosen for various committee and advisory po
sitions."
Pizzo said he could not speculate on whether
anyone from Stanford would be named to the
committees.
Along with the 28 other members, Pizzo will
serve one. possibly two, eight-year terms on the
ICOC. The committee members selected Stan
ford Law School alumnus Robert Klein, who au
thored Prop. 71, to chair the ICOC.
Prop. 71 was written, in large part, to circum
vent governmental limitations on federal funding
that could be used for stem cell research.
Bush announced in 2001 that federal funding
for stem cell research would be limited to a prede
termined number of stem cell lines. Following his

information would be altered so that
the embryo would never be able to
completely develop.
The fundamental idea is if we
can't agree on whether or when an
embryo should be treated *as a
human life in process, then maybe
we could agree on what isn't a
human embryo," Hurlbut explained.
"We need to do the hard work of dis
cerning what exactly is the moral en
tity that is of concern to those with
the deepest concerns. Then, if we
could find the technical means of
production, which I'm hopeful we
can do, we could solve this."
Hurlbut said he is not trying to
promote the idea in the public arena
yet, but first trying to gain support
for the process from both the scien
tific community and religious lead
ers.
"I've talked with many people
about the moral significance of it, in
cluding major figures in the Catholic
Church," Hurlbut said, noting that

the process has won the approval of
the Archbishop of San Francisco,
William Levada. "I've also spent a
lot of time talking to scientists trying
to figure out the feasibility, and on
both fronts I feel I've made signifi
cant progress."
However, almost immediately
after he began to promote this pro
posal last December. Hurlbut began
to receive criticism about it.
"[The embryoj is a human being
unfolding, not a future human
being," Hurlbut said. "That's not a
popular view to take, and I've taken
a lot of heat about it. When I put for
ward my proposal for altered nu
clear transfer, within two hours I was
getting hate mail from both sides of
the argument."
Also, an opinion piece in the Dec.
30 issue of the New England Journal
of Medicine — co-authored by Dr.
George Q. Daley of Harvard Med
ical School and Charles Jennings, ex
ecutive director of the Harvard Stem

decision. Bush formed the Presi
dent's Council on Bioethics to help
continue the national debate on the
matter. Hurlbut joined the council in
the beginning of 2002.
"I'm very excited by the advances
of stem cell biology, and while it isn't
yet proven, I think it could prove to
be a very hopeful realm." Hurlbut
said. "However, 1 think at this stage
we should all acknowledge that it is
investigative science."
Some people take issue with em
bryonic stem cell research because of
the ambiguous moral status of em
bryos. Hurlbut has been promoting a
proposal that he sees as an accept
able compromise.
The proposal is to pursue a
process called altered nuclear trans
fer. This process would replace the
nucleus of an embryo with one con
taining the genetic information that
one hopes to replicate. The genetic

Cell Institute — outlines critical con
cerns over certain aspects of Hurl
but's proposal.
"I respect the fact that Dr. Hurl
but is attempting to think creatively
about this important topic," Pizzo
said, mirroring the concerns stated in
the journal article. "However. I have
concerns about the feasibility of the
methodology being suggested."
Still, some scientists have ex
pressed interest in pursuing altered
nuclear transfer, Hurlbut said, and
the process has won the approval of
Dr. Leon Kass, chairman of the Pres
ident's Council on Bioethics.
"The council is an amazingly di
verse group of people, and I don't
believe it was designed to be a rub
ber-stamp council for the president
there's a strong diversity of opinions
represented," Hurlbut said. "[BushJ
said he wanted us to help stimulate
discussion of these issues more
broadly within the society, to engage
and educate the public, to help serve

as the conscience of the country and
to advise him and the nation."
Pizzo said that he thinks some as
pects of policy surrounding stem cell
research are currently driven "by re
ligious beliefs or by strong positions
about abortion and freedom of
choice."
"I would hope that in a nation
that values freedom and democracy,
the U.S. A would have its public pol
icy guided by the highest scientific
and ethical principles — but not by
religious or ideological positions,"
he said. "Because the policies
around stem cell research currently
emanating from the present federal
administration appear to be more
grounded in religion and ideology, I
do hope that this will change as citi
zens become more knowledgeable
about this important area of re
search."
In contrast, Hurlbut said that sci
ence always proceeds within some
agreed-upon constraints, and that to
label certain such constraints as ide
ology is incorrect.
"If you say that it's ideology to
call the embryo a human life at con
ception, I, first of all, just think that's
bad science," Hurlbut said. "If you
say it's ideology to call it that be
cause you're assigning moral worth
to it, well, any assignment of moral
worth is in some sense ideology then.
You'd be hard-pressed to make a
convincing argument for why an em
bryo at seven weeks or a fetus at
three months or six months or eight
months has moral standing. You
won't get agreement from anybody.
"I think some ideologies are dis
proportionate and based on myth
and emotion," he continued. "But I
don't believe calling the human em
bryo an organism in continuity with
its later manifest form to be ideology
— that'sjust scientific discernment."
The debate over the role of "ide
ological beliefs" in stem cell research
is what prompted Berg to publicly
support funding for stem cell re
search. In 2002, he proclaimed sup
port for therapeutic cloning, which
produces stem cells for research, and
he has since worked with members
of Congress to lobby for more lax
regulations on federal funding.
"(Embryonic stem cell research|
has tremendous potential for doing
good, and yet at the same time you
have these people who are saying, it
offends me, it offends my values or
my religious beliefs,"' Berg said.
"You can have your religious beliefs,
but you can't restrict it so that other
people who don't share your beliefs
can't have access to the advances."

Hum Bio profs stem cell proposal seeks a middle ground

Berg said that though he is cur
rently not actively involved in sup
porting stem cell research, he was a
very outspoken supporter of Prop.
71 and could potentially become
more involved in the future.
One of Berg's concerns is of legis
lation currently pending in Congress
that would criminalize both nuclear
transfer and reproductive cloning.
Many scientists have said that repro
ductive cloning should be banned,
though nuclear transfer should not.
Berg noted that one bill pending
would make it a crime for an individ
ual to receive a medical transplant
that involved some sort of cloning in
another country and then to return
to the United States.
"That's arrogance," Berg said of
the bill.
However. Berg said that he
thinks many congresspeople who
supported strict regulation of stem
cell research will change their minds
once they realize that other coun
tries are making more medical ad
vances.
"You begin to look around and
say, 'Hey, wait a minute, are we
going to sit back and stand on our
moral principles and stifle this re
search while everybody else is
booming ahead?"' Berg said.
Hurlbut said that even though
there could be benefits to proceed
ing with different avenues of stem
cell research, it must proceed in such
a way that most citizens feel com
fortable with the work being done
and would trust the medical leaders
in their community. That is why, he
said, he is trying to reach a moral
middle ground by pursuing the idea
of altered nuclear transfer.
"My big goal is to allow federal
funding so the research can be car
ried out on a national level with col
laboration between laboratories,"
Hurlbut said. "The creativity that
will come from having multiple cen
ters of research will be much greater
than distilling everybody in one uni
versity."
Though Stanford did not lake an
official position on Prop. 71. the Uni
versity has endorsed the pursuit of
stem cell research.
"Given the impasse of our soci
ety, it's understandable that they
feel they should go forward in this
situation." Hurlbut said. "It would
also be understandable to be sensi
tive to the diversity of opinion in this
society, and I think it would be bet
ter for science in the long run if sci
ence takes account of the serious
moral concerns that a great many
people have about this research."

port for therapeutic cloning, which
produces stem cells for research, and
he has since worked with members
of Congress to lobby for more lax
regulations on federal funding.
"(Embryonic stem cell research|
has tremendous potential for doing
good, and yet at the same time you
have these people who are saying, it
offends me, it offends my values or
my religious beliefs,"' Berg said.
"You can have your religious beliefs,
but you can't restrict it so that other
people who don't share your beliefs
can't have access to the advances."

Hum Bio profs stem cell proposal seeks a middle ground

Berg said that though he is cur
rently not actively involved in sup
porting stem cell research, he was a
very outspoken supporter of Prop.
71 and could potentially become
more involved in the future.
One of Berg's concerns is of legis
lation currently pending in Congress
that would criminalize both nuclear
transfer and reproductive cloning.
Many scientists have said that repro
ductive cloning should be banned,
though nuclear transfer should not.
Berg noted that one bill pending
would make it a crime for an individ
ual to receive a medical transplant
that involved some sort of cloning in
another country and then to return
to the United States.
"That's arrogance," Berg said of
the bill.
However. Berg said that he
thinks many congresspeople who
supported strict regulation of stem
cell research will change their minds
once they realize that other coun
tries are making more medical ad
vances.
"You begin to look around and
say, 'Hey, wait a minute, are we
going to sit back and stand on our
moral principles and stifle this re
search while everybody else is
booming ahead?"' Berg said.
Hurlbut said that even though
there could be benefits to proceed
ing with different avenues of stem
cell research, it must proceed in such
a way that most citizens feel com
fortable with the work being done
and would trust the medical leaders
in their community. That is why, he
said, he is trying to reach a moral
middle ground by pursuing the idea
of altered nuclear transfer.
"My big goal is to allow federal
funding so the research can be car
ried out on a national level with col
laboration between laboratories,"
Hurlbut said. "The creativity that
will come from having multiple cen
ters of research will be much greater
than distilling everybody in one uni
versity."
Though Stanford did not lake an
official position on Prop. 71. the Uni
versity has endorsed the pursuit of
stem cell research.
"Given the impasse of our soci
ety, it's understandable that they
feel they should go forward in this
situation." Hurlbut said. "It would
also be understandable to be sensi
tive to the diversity of opinion in this
society, and I think it would be bet
ter for science in the long run if sci
ence takes account of the serious
moral concerns that a great many
people have about this research."
Stanford's Institute for Cancer / Stem Cell Bi
ology and Medicine promises to conduct some of
the most advanced stem cell research in the coun
try in upcoming years, and several faculty mem
bers are involved in deciding how that research
should be carried out.
Legislation passed on both the national and
state levels could determine the future of stem cell
research at institutions and organizations
throughout the country, including Stanford.
Dr. Philip Pizzo, dean of the medical school,
will be directly involved in determining how Cali
fornia state funds will be distributed for stem cell
research. On the national level. Human Biology
Prof. William Hurlbut, who sits on the President's
Council on Bioethics, has been advising President
George W. Bush on the ethical issues surrounding
stem cell research and is developing a proposal
that he hopes will bring the country closer to a con
sensus on the issue. Biochemistry Emeritus Prof.
Paul Berg has also offered his counsel to national
politicians; though he does no stem cell research
himself, he is a strong advocate for it.
The varying opinions of these experts, and the
reasoning behind their convictions, demonstrate
the complexity and sensitivity of the debate on
stem cell research. While many acknowledge the
potential for great medical advances through stem
cell research, others find troubling the ethics be
hind the research.
Pizzo sits on the Independent Citizen's Over
sight Committee, or ICOC, which will distribute
funds approved for stem cell research in Califor

nia as a result of Prop. 71. Prior to the passage of
the proposition, he said he was careful not to cam
paign in any official capacity.
"I did advocate for Prop. 71 as a private citizen
and have certainly discussed the merits of stem
cell research in a number of public and private set
tings," he said.
Named to the ICOC on Nov. 5,2004, Pizzo will
help select members of three new committees
which will work with the ICOC to decide which re
search proposals to fund. The ICOC is the gov
erning body of the California Institute on Regen
erative Medicine, which was formed after the pas
sage of Prop.7l.
"Appointments to various committees within
the California Institute on Regenerative Medicine
will be done in an open, fair and merit-based man
ner," he said. "I believe excellent individuals will
be chosen for various committee and advisory po
sitions."
Pizzo said he could not speculate on whether
anyone from Stanford would be named to the
committees.
Along with the 28 other members, Pizzo will
serve one. possibly two, eight-year terms on the
ICOC. The committee members selected Stan
ford Law School alumnus Robert Klein, who au
thored Prop. 71, to chair the ICOC.
Prop. 71 was written, in large part, to circum
vent governmental limitations on federal funding
that could be used for stem cell research.
Bush announced in 2001 that federal funding
for stem cell research would be limited to a prede
termined number of stem cell lines. Following his


JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily
information would be altered so that
the embryo would never be able to
completely develop.
The fundamental idea is if we
can't agree on whether or when an
embryo should be treated *as a
human life in process, then maybe
we could agree on what isn't a
human embryo," Hurlbut explained.
"We need to do the hard work of dis
cerning what exactly is the moral en
tity that is of concern to those with
the deepest concerns. Then, if we
could find the technical means of
production, which I'm hopeful we
can do, we could solve this."
Hurlbut said he is not trying to
promote the idea in the public arena
yet, but first trying to gain support
for the process from both the scien
tific community and religious lead
ers.
"I've talked with many people
about the moral significance of it, in
cluding major figures in the Catholic
Church," Hurlbut said, noting that

the process has won the approval of
the Archbishop of San Francisco,
William Levada. "I've also spent a
lot of time talking to scientists trying
to figure out the feasibility, and on
both fronts I feel I've made signifi
cant progress."
However, almost immediately
after he began to promote this pro
posal last December. Hurlbut began
to receive criticism about it.
"[The embryoj is a human being
unfolding, not a future human
being," Hurlbut said. "That's not a
popular view to take, and I've taken
a lot of heat about it. When I put for
ward my proposal for altered nu
clear transfer, within two hours I was
getting hate mail from both sides of
the argument."
Also, an opinion piece in the Dec.
30 issue of the New England Journal
of Medicine — co-authored by Dr.
George Q. Daley of Harvard Med
ical School and Charles Jennings, ex
ecutive director of the Harvard Stem

decision. Bush formed the Presi
dent's Council on Bioethics to help
continue the national debate on the
matter. Hurlbut joined the council in
the beginning of 2002.
"I'm very excited by the advances
of stem cell biology, and while it isn't
yet proven, I think it could prove to
be a very hopeful realm." Hurlbut
said. "However, 1 think at this stage
we should all acknowledge that it is
investigative science."
Some people take issue with em
bryonic stem cell research because of
the ambiguous moral status of em
bryos. Hurlbut has been promoting a
proposal that he sees as an accept
able compromise.
The proposal is to pursue a
process called altered nuclear trans
fer. This process would replace the
nucleus of an embryo with one con
taining the genetic information that
one hopes to replicate. The genetic

Cell Institute — outlines critical con
cerns over certain aspects of Hurl
but's proposal.
"I respect the fact that Dr. Hurl
but is attempting to think creatively
about this important topic," Pizzo
said, mirroring the concerns stated in
the journal article. "However. I have
concerns about the feasibility of the
methodology being suggested."
Still, some scientists have ex
pressed interest in pursuing altered
nuclear transfer, Hurlbut said, and
the process has won the approval of
Dr. Leon Kass, chairman of the Pres
ident's Council on Bioethics.
"The council is an amazingly di
verse group of people, and I don't
believe it was designed to be a rub
ber-stamp council for the president
there's a strong diversity of opinions
represented," Hurlbut said. "[BushJ
said he wanted us to help stimulate
discussion of these issues more
broadly within the society, to engage
and educate the public, to help serve

as the conscience of the country and
to advise him and the nation."
Pizzo said that he thinks some as
pects of policy surrounding stem cell
research are currently driven "by re
ligious beliefs or by strong positions
about abortion and freedom of
choice."
"I would hope that in a nation
that values freedom and democracy,
the U.S. A would have its public pol
icy guided by the highest scientific
and ethical principles — but not by
religious or ideological positions,"
he said. "Because the policies
around stem cell research currently
emanating from the present federal
administration appear to be more
grounded in religion and ideology, I
do hope that this will change as citi
zens become more knowledgeable
about this important area of re
search."
In contrast, Hurlbut said that sci
ence always proceeds within some
agreed-upon constraints, and that to
label certain such constraints as ide
ology is incorrect.
"If you say that it's ideology to
call the embryo a human life at con
ception, I, first of all, just think that's
bad science," Hurlbut said. "If you
say it's ideology to call it that be
cause you're assigning moral worth
to it, well, any assignment of moral
worth is in some sense ideology then.
You'd be hard-pressed to make a
convincing argument for why an em
bryo at seven weeks or a fetus at
three months or six months or eight
months has moral standing. You
won't get agreement from anybody.
"I think some ideologies are dis
proportionate and based on myth
and emotion," he continued. "But I
don't believe calling the human em
bryo an organism in continuity with
its later manifest form to be ideology
— that'sjust scientific discernment."
The debate over the role of "ide
ological beliefs" in stem cell research
is what prompted Berg to publicly
support funding for stem cell re
search. In 2002, he proclaimed sup
port for therapeutic cloning, which
produces stem cells for research, and
he has since worked with members
of Congress to lobby for more lax
regulations on federal funding.

cerns over certain aspects of Hurl
but's proposal.
"I respect the fact that Dr. Hurl
but is attempting to think creatively
about this important topic," Pizzo
said, mirroring the concerns stated in
the journal article. "However. I have
concerns about the feasibility of the
methodology being suggested."
Still, some scientists have ex
pressed interest in pursuing altered
nuclear transfer, Hurlbut said, and
the process has won the approval of
Dr. Leon Kass, chairman of the Pres
ident's Council on Bioethics.
"The council is an amazingly di
verse group of people, and I don't
believe it was designed to be a rub
ber-stamp council for the president
there's a strong diversity of opinions
represented," Hurlbut said. "[BushJ
said he wanted us to help stimulate
discussion of these issues more
broadly within the society, to engage
and educate the public, to help serve

as the conscience of the country and
to advise him and the nation."
Pizzo said that he thinks some as
pects of policy surrounding stem cell
research are currently driven "by re
ligious beliefs or by strong positions
about abortion and freedom of
choice."
"I would hope that in a nation
that values freedom and democracy,
the U.S. A would have its public pol
icy guided by the highest scientific
and ethical principles — but not by
religious or ideological positions,"
he said. "Because the policies
around stem cell research currently
emanating from the present federal
administration appear to be more
grounded in religion and ideology, I
do hope that this will change as citi
zens become more knowledgeable
about this important area of re
search."
In contrast, Hurlbut said that sci
ence always proceeds within some
agreed-upon constraints, and that to
label certain such constraints as ide
ology is incorrect.
"If you say that it's ideology to
call the embryo a human life at con
ception, I, first of all, just think that's
bad science," Hurlbut said. "If you
say it's ideology to call it that be
cause you're assigning moral worth
to it, well, any assignment of moral
worth is in some sense ideology then.
You'd be hard-pressed to make a
convincing argument for why an em
bryo at seven weeks or a fetus at
three months or six months or eight
months has moral standing. You
won't get agreement from anybody.
"I think some ideologies are dis
proportionate and based on myth
and emotion," he continued. "But I
don't believe calling the human em
bryo an organism in continuity with
its later manifest form to be ideology
— that'sjust scientific discernment."
The debate over the role of "ide
ological beliefs" in stem cell research
is what prompted Berg to publicly
support funding for stem cell re
search. In 2002, he proclaimed sup
port for therapeutic cloning, which
produces stem cells for research, and
he has since worked with members
of Congress to lobby for more lax
regulations on federal funding.
"(Embryonic stem cell research|
has tremendous potential for doing
good, and yet at the same time you
have these people who are saying, it
offends me, it offends my values or
my religious beliefs,"' Berg said.
"You can have your religious beliefs,
but you can't restrict it so that other
people who don't share your beliefs
can't have access to the advances."

Hum Bio profs stem cell proposal seeks a middle ground

Berg said that though he is cur
rently not actively involved in sup
porting stem cell research, he was a
very outspoken supporter of Prop.
71 and could potentially become
more involved in the future.
One of Berg's concerns is of legis
lation currently pending in Congress
that would criminalize both nuclear
transfer and reproductive cloning.
Many scientists have said that repro
ductive cloning should be banned,
though nuclear transfer should not.
Berg noted that one bill pending
would make it a crime for an individ
ual to receive a medical transplant
that involved some sort of cloning in
another country and then to return
to the United States.
"That's arrogance," Berg said of
the bill.
However. Berg said that he
thinks many congresspeople who
supported strict regulation of stem
cell research will change their minds
once they realize that other coun
tries are making more medical ad
vances.
"You begin to look around and
say, 'Hey, wait a minute, are we
going to sit back and stand on our
moral principles and stifle this re
search while everybody else is
booming ahead?"' Berg said.
Hurlbut said that even though
there could be benefits to proceed
ing with different avenues of stem
cell research, it must proceed in such
a way that most citizens feel com
fortable with the work being done
and would trust the medical leaders
in their community. That is why, he
said, he is trying to reach a moral
middle ground by pursuing the idea
of altered nuclear transfer.
"My big goal is to allow federal
funding so the research can be car
ried out on a national level with col
laboration between laboratories,"
Hurlbut said. "The creativity that
will come from having multiple cen
ters of research will be much greater
than distilling everybody in one uni
versity."
Though Stanford did not lake an
official position on Prop. 71. the Uni
versity has endorsed the pursuit of
stem cell research.
"Given the impasse of our soci
ety, it's understandable that they
feel they should go forward in this
situation." Hurlbut said. "It would
also be understandable to be sensi
tive to the diversity of opinion in this
society, and I think it would be bet
ter for science in the long run if sci
ence takes account of the serious
moral concerns that a great many
people have about this research."
Stanford's Institute for Cancer / Stem Cell Bi
ology and Medicine promises to conduct some of
the most advanced stem cell research in the coun
try in upcoming years, and several faculty mem
bers are involved in deciding how that research
should be carried out.
Legislation passed on both the national and
state levels could determine the future of stem cell
research at institutions and organizations
throughout the country, including Stanford.
Dr. Philip Pizzo, dean of the medical school,
will be directly involved in determining how Cali
fornia state funds will be distributed for stem cell
research. On the national level. Human Biology
Prof. William Hurlbut, who sits on the President's
Council on Bioethics, has been advising President
George W. Bush on the ethical issues surrounding
stem cell research and is developing a proposal
that he hopes will bring the country closer to a con
sensus on the issue. Biochemistry Emeritus Prof.
Paul Berg has also offered his counsel to national
politicians; though he does no stem cell research
himself, he is a strong advocate for it.
The varying opinions of these experts, and the
reasoning behind their convictions, demonstrate
the complexity and sensitivity of the debate on
stem cell research. While many acknowledge the
potential for great medical advances through stem
cell research, others find troubling the ethics be
hind the research.
Pizzo sits on the Independent Citizen's Over
sight Committee, or ICOC, which will distribute
funds approved for stem cell research in Califor

nia as a result of Prop. 71. Prior to the passage of
the proposition, he said he was careful not to cam
paign in any official capacity.
"I did advocate for Prop. 71 as a private citizen
and have certainly discussed the merits of stem
cell research in a number of public and private set
tings," he said.
Named to the ICOC on Nov. 5,2004, Pizzo will
help select members of three new committees
which will work with the ICOC to decide which re
search proposals to fund. The ICOC is the gov
erning body of the California Institute on Regen
erative Medicine, which was formed after the pas
sage of Prop.7l.
"Appointments to various committees within
the California Institute on Regenerative Medicine
will be done in an open, fair and merit-based man
ner," he said. "I believe excellent individuals will
be chosen for various committee and advisory po
sitions."
Pizzo said he could not speculate on whether
anyone from Stanford would be named to the
committees.
Along with the 28 other members, Pizzo will
serve one. possibly two, eight-year terms on the
ICOC. The committee members selected Stan
ford Law School alumnus Robert Klein, who au
thored Prop. 71, to chair the ICOC.
Prop. 71 was written, in large part, to circum
vent governmental limitations on federal funding
that could be used for stem cell research.
Bush announced in 2001 that federal funding
for stem cell research would be limited to a prede
termined number of stem cell lines. Following his


JOSEPH BERGEN/The Stanford Daily
information would be altered so that
the embryo would never be able to
completely develop.
The fundamental idea is if we
can't agree on whether or when an
embryo should be treated *as a
human life in process, then maybe
we could agree on what isn't a
human embryo," Hurlbut explained.
"We need to do the hard work of dis
cerning what exactly is the moral en
tity that is of concern to those with
the deepest concerns. Then, if we
could find the technical means of
production, which I'm hopeful we
can do, we could solve this."
Hurlbut said he is not trying to
promote the idea in the public arena
yet, but first trying to gain support
for the process from both the scien
tific community and religious lead
ers.
"I've talked with many people
about the moral significance of it, in
cluding major figures in the Catholic
Church," Hurlbut said, noting that

the process has won the approval of
the Archbishop of San Francisco,
William Levada. "I've also spent a
lot of time talking to scientists trying
to figure out the feasibility, and on
both fronts I feel I've made signifi
cant progress."
However, almost immediately
after he began to promote this pro
posal last December. Hurlbut began
to receive criticism about it.
"[The embryoj is a human being
unfolding, not a future human
being," Hurlbut said. "That's not a
popular view to take, and I've taken
a lot of heat about it. When I put for
ward my proposal for altered nu
clear transfer, within two hours I was
getting hate mail from both sides of
the argument."
Also, an opinion piece in the Dec.
30 issue of the New England Journal
of Medicine — co-authored by Dr.
George Q. Daley of Harvard Med
ical School and Charles Jennings, ex
ecutive director of the Harvard Stem

decision. Bush formed the Presi
dent's Council on Bioethics to help
continue the national debate on the
matter. Hurlbut joined the council in
the beginning of 2002.
"I'm very excited by the advances
of stem cell biology, and while it isn't
yet proven, I think it could prove to
be a very hopeful realm." Hurlbut
said. "However, 1 think at this stage
we should all acknowledge that it is
investigative science."
Some people take issue with em
bryonic stem cell research because of
the ambiguous moral status of em
bryos. Hurlbut has been promoting a
proposal that he sees as an accept
able compromise.
The proposal is to pursue a
process called altered nuclear trans
fer. This process would replace the
nucleus of an embryo with one con
taining the genetic information that
one hopes to replicate. The genetic

Bush announced in 2001 that federal funding
for stem cell research would be limited to a prede
termined number of stem cell lines. Following his

information would be altered so that
the embryo would never be able to
completely develop.
The fundamental idea is if we
can't agree on whether or when an
embryo should be treated *as a
human life in process, then maybe
we could agree on what isn't a
human embryo," Hurlbut explained.
"We need to do the hard work of dis
cerning what exactly is the moral en
tity that is of concern to those with
the deepest concerns. Then, if we
could find the technical means of
production, which I'm hopeful we
can do, we could solve this."
Hurlbut said he is not trying to
promote the idea in the public arena
yet, but first trying to gain support
for the process from both the scien
tific community and religious lead
ers.
"I've talked with many people
about the moral significance of it, in
cluding major figures in the Catholic
Church," Hurlbut said, noting that

the process has won the approval of
the Archbishop of San Francisco,
William Levada. "I've also spent a
lot of time talking to scientists trying
to figure out the feasibility, and on
both fronts I feel I've made signifi
cant progress."
However, almost immediately
after he began to promote this pro
posal last December. Hurlbut began
to receive criticism about it.
"[The embryoj is a human being
unfolding, not a future human
being," Hurlbut said. "That's not a
popular view to take, and I've taken
a lot of heat about it. When I put for
ward my proposal for altered nu
clear transfer, within two hours I was
getting hate mail from both sides of
the argument."
Also, an opinion piece in the Dec.
30 issue of the New England Journal
of Medicine — co-authored by Dr.
George Q. Daley of Harvard Med
ical School and Charles Jennings, ex
ecutive director of the Harvard Stem

decision. Bush formed the Presi
dent's Council on Bioethics to help
continue the national debate on the
matter. Hurlbut joined the council in
the beginning of 2002.
"I'm very excited by the advances
of stem cell biology, and while it isn't
yet proven, I think it could prove to
be a very hopeful realm." Hurlbut
said. "However, 1 think at this stage
we should all acknowledge that it is
investigative science."
Some people take issue with em
bryonic stem cell research because of
the ambiguous moral status of em
bryos. Hurlbut has been promoting a
proposal that he sees as an accept
able compromise.
The proposal is to pursue a
process called altered nuclear trans
fer. This process would replace the
nucleus of an embryo with one con
taining the genetic information that
one hopes to replicate. The genetic

Cell Institute — outlines critical con
cerns over certain aspects of Hurl
but's proposal.
"I respect the fact that Dr. Hurl
but is attempting to think creatively
about this important topic," Pizzo
said, mirroring the concerns stated in
the journal article. "However. I have
concerns about the feasibility of the
methodology being suggested."
Still, some scientists have ex
pressed interest in pursuing altered
nuclear transfer, Hurlbut said, and
the process has won the approval of
Dr. Leon Kass, chairman of the Pres
ident's Council on Bioethics.
"The council is an amazingly di
verse group of people, and I don't
believe it was designed to be a rub
ber-stamp council for the president
there's a strong diversity of opinions
represented," Hurlbut said. "[BushJ
said he wanted us to help stimulate
discussion of these issues more
broadly within the society, to engage
and educate the public, to help serve

as the conscience of the country and
to advise him and the nation."
Pizzo said that he thinks some as
pects of policy surrounding stem cell
research are currently driven "by re
ligious beliefs or by strong positions
about abortion and freedom of
choice."
"I would hope that in a nation
that values freedom and democracy,
the U.S. A would have its public pol
icy guided by the highest scientific
and ethical principles — but not by
religious or ideological positions,"
he said. "Because the policies
around stem cell research currently
emanating from the present federal
administration appear to be more
grounded in religion and ideology, I
do hope that this will change as citi
zens become more knowledgeable
about this important area of re
search."
In contrast, Hurlbut said that sci
ence always proceeds within some
agreed-upon constraints, and that to
label certain such constraints as ide
ology is incorrect.
"If you say that it's ideology to
call the embryo a human life at con
ception, I, first of all, just think that's
bad science," Hurlbut said. "If you
say it's ideology to call it that be
cause you're assigning moral worth
to it, well, any assignment of moral
worth is in some sense ideology then.
You'd be hard-pressed to make a
convincing argument for why an em
bryo at seven weeks or a fetus at
three months or six months or eight
months has moral standing. You
won't get agreement from anybody.
"I think some ideologies are dis
proportionate and based on myth
and emotion," he continued. "But I
don't believe calling the human em
bryo an organism in continuity with
its later manifest form to be ideology
— that'sjust scientific discernment."
The debate over the role of "ide
ological beliefs" in stem cell research
is what prompted Berg to publicly
support funding for stem cell re
search. In 2002, he proclaimed sup
port for therapeutic cloning, which
produces stem cells for research, and
he has since worked with members
of Congress to lobby for more lax
regulations on federal funding.
"(Embryonic stem cell research|
has tremendous potential for doing
good, and yet at the same time you
have these people who are saying, it
offends me, it offends my values or
my religious beliefs,"' Berg said.
"You can have your religious beliefs,
but you can't restrict it so that other
people who don't share your beliefs
can't have access to the advances."

Hum Bio profs stem cell proposal seeks a middle ground

Berg said that though he is cur
rently not actively involved in sup
porting stem cell research, he was a
very outspoken supporter of Prop.
71 and could potentially become
more involved in the future.
One of Berg's concerns is of legis
lation currently pending in Congress
that would criminalize both nuclear
transfer and reproductive cloning.
Many scientists have said that repro
ductive cloning should be banned,
though nuclear transfer should not.
Berg noted that one bill pending
would make it a crime for an individ
ual to receive a medical transplant
that involved some sort of cloning in
another country and then to return
to the United States.
"That's arrogance," Berg said of
the bill.
However. Berg said that he
thinks many congresspeople who
supported strict regulation of stem
cell research will change their minds
once they realize that other coun
tries are making more medical ad
vances.
"You begin to look around and
say, 'Hey, wait a minute, are we
going to sit back and stand on our
moral principles and stifle this re
search while everybody else is
booming ahead?"' Berg said.
Hurlbut said that even though
there could be benefits to proceed
ing with different avenues of stem
cell research, it must proceed in such
a way that most citizens feel com
fortable with the work being done
and would trust the medical leaders
in their community. That is why, he
said, he is trying to reach a moral
middle ground by pursuing the idea
of altered nuclear transfer.
"My big goal is to allow federal
funding so the research can be car
ried out on a national level with col
laboration between laboratories,"
Hurlbut said. "The creativity that
will come from having multiple cen
ters of research will be much greater
than distilling everybody in one uni
versity."
Though Stanford did not lake an
official position on Prop. 71. the Uni
versity has endorsed the pursuit of
stem cell research.
"Given the impasse of our soci
ety, it's understandable that they
feel they should go forward in this
situation." Hurlbut said. "It would
also be understandable to be sensi
tive to the diversity of opinion in this
society, and I think it would be bet
ter for science in the long run if sci
ence takes account of the serious
moral concerns that a great many
people have about this research."
