## Faculty members play role in stem cell debate 
### STEPHANIE CONDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Institute for Cancer / Stem Cell Bi
ology and Medicine promises to conduct some of
the most advanced stem cell research in the coun
try in upcoming years, and several faculty mem
bers are involved in deciding how that research
should be carried out.
Legislation passed on both the national and
state levels could determine the future of stem cell
research at institutions and organizations
throughout the country, including Stanford.
Dr. Philip Pizzo, dean of the medical school,
will be directly involved in determining how Cali
fornia state funds will be distributed for stem cell
research. On the national level. Human Biology
Prof. William Hurlbut, who sits on the President's
Council on Bioethics, has been advising President
George W. Bush on the ethical issues surrounding
stem cell research and is developing a proposal
that he hopes will bring the country closer to a con
sensus on the issue. Biochemistry Emeritus Prof.
Paul Berg has also offered his counsel to national
politicians; though he does no stem cell research
himself, he is a strong advocate for it.
The varying opinions of these experts, and the
reasoning behind their convictions, demonstrate
the complexity and sensitivity of the debate on
stem cell research. While many acknowledge the
potential for great medical advances through stem
cell research, others find troubling the ethics be
hind the research.
Pizzo sits on the Independent Citizen's Over
sight Committee, or ICOC, which will distribute
funds approved for stem cell research in Califor

nia as a result of Prop. 71. Prior to the passage of
the proposition, he said he was careful not to cam
paign in any official capacity.
"I did advocate for Prop. 71 as a private citizen
and have certainly discussed the merits of stem
cell research in a number of public and private set
tings," he said.
Named to the ICOC on Nov. 5,2004, Pizzo will
help select members of three new committees
which will work with the ICOC to decide which re
search proposals to fund. The ICOC is the gov
erning body of the California Institute on Regen
erative Medicine, which was formed after the pas
sage of Prop.7l.
"Appointments to various committees within
the California Institute on Regenerative Medicine
will be done in an open, fair and merit-based man
ner," he said. "I believe excellent individuals will
be chosen for various committee and advisory po
sitions."
Pizzo said he could not speculate on whether
anyone from Stanford would be named to the
committees.
Along with the 28 other members, Pizzo will
serve one. possibly two, eight-year terms on the
ICOC. The committee members selected Stan
ford Law School alumnus Robert Klein, who au
thored Prop. 71, to chair the ICOC.
Prop. 71 was written, in large part, to circum
vent governmental limitations on federal funding
that could be used for stem cell research.
Bush announced in 2001 that federal funding
for stem cell research would be limited to a prede
termined number of stem cell lines. Following his
