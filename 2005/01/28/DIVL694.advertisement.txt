Decline in Aluminum Can Recycling
Do you recycle all of your aluminum cans?
The numbers show that less and less
Americans are. In 2002, Americans wasted
approximately $800 million by discarding
nearly 50 billion aluminum cans into the
landfills according to a study produced by
Alcan Inc, a Montreal-based aluminum and
packaging company. The rate dropped from
67.9% in 1992 to 53.4% in 2002 nationwide.
In California, the recycling rate for alu
minum cans has dropped one percent every
year since 2000 to 74%. The aluminum can
still has the highest recycling rate of all bev
erage containers, so why is there a concern
about its decline?

to make the primary aluminum. In 2001, the
energy lost from unrecycled cans was equal to
approximately 16 million barrels of crude oil or
enough power to supply electricity to 2.7
million homes fora year, according to the study. The energy saved from
recycling helps the environment because it reduces production related
emissions, such as greenhouse gases.
Alum ilium cans arc valuable
The aluminum can is the only packaging material that
more than covers the cost of collection and re-processing
for itself and, in fact, also subsidizes the collection of
other containers, including plastic and glass. Since 1990,
approximately 7 million tons of aluminum cans with a
market value of $7 billion have not been recycled.

What is to blame for the decline? Lack of awareness and consuming more
beverages on-the-go. Realize that aluminum cans have value and look for
places to recycle when you are away from home. If you can't find a place,
bring them home and put them in your recycling bin.
