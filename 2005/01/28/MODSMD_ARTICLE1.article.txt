# Family creates James Hsu Memorial Fund
## 
### JESSICA ZHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In honor of James Hsu, the Stanford Graduate School of
Business student who died in last month's South Asian
tsunamis, the Hsu family, in partnership with the Community
Foundation Silicon Valley announced last Tuesday the cre
ation of the James W. Hsu Memorial Fund to assist tsunami
survivors and aid in the region's rebuilding efforts.
Hsu and several classmates traveled to Thailand and Singa
pore on a school-sponsored study trip and were vacationing on
the island of Koh Phi Phi when waves overcame his bungalow.
Hsu's sister. Peggy, and her fiance Ben McCaw traveled to
Thailand in search of Hsu, and according to a press release by
the CFSV, "were touched by the kindness and generosity of
the local residents who aided them in their search."
"We want to keep his spirit alive by helping others,"
McCaw said in the press release.
Although the fund itself has existed for less than two weeks,
"community members and James' friends have been incredi
bly generous thus far," said Michelle McGurk, director of
communications and marketing at the CFSV. "The family has
been very moved by the response by the community."
The family has not made public how much money has been
raised so far.
Members of the Hsu family approached the CFSV in early
January to inquire about creating a fund in James' memory.
They have been working with staff members at the CFSV since
then to make this a reality.
"The role of community foundations is to build charitable
endowments," McGurk explained. "Often, families will de
cide to commemorate a loved one and to support causes their
Hsu Fund to
help victims

loved ones cared about."
Individuals, families and busi
nesses create charitable funds tar
geting communities' needs. Commu
nity foundations, which are tax-ex
empt public charities, then invest
and administer these funds, and
work with the fund's creators to
make grants.
"Family members of James will
be the advisors on the fund,"
McGurk said. "They'll be recom
mending grants from the fund to var
ious causes. In the short term, those
causes will be to remember James by
helping families in Thailand and
over the longer term, as relief and re
building efforts come to a close, the
fund will help with local causes."

For now, funds — through the
CFSV — will most likely he allocat
ed to larger, non-governmental or
ganizations instead of individuals in
need.
"IRS regulations make it difficult
to grant to individuals directly. It's
more effective for us to work
through NGOs in the particular
country who have staff in that coun
try and can monitor local need,"
McGurk said.
Specific NGOs have yet to be
named, nor has the Hsu family or the
CFSV commented about local orga
nizations the fund may target in the
future.
