# On this day in Stanford History...

### 
On January 28,1965, The Daily ran
a story summarizing an LA Times
article that predicted Berkeley-like
unrest on campus.
William Trombley, education
writer for the Los Angeles Times,
warned of a possible uprising at
Stanford in a recent series of arti
cles.
Students traditionally con
cerned with "girls, golf and good
jobs," have, he threatens ominous
ly, "become acutely aware of the
world's problems and willing to
take action to correct them. Al
though the per capita ownership of
Maseratis still runs high, some agi
tated hearts beat beneath the afflu
ent surface."
Noting that Stanford adminis
trators, leery of a student rebellion
similar to the Cal FSM movement,
have hastened to resurrect the un
dergraduate study program, and to
personalize academic intercourse,
Trombley writes that growing stu
dent dissatisfaction made such re
forms imperative.
"Eighty-five Stanford students
entered the Peace Corps in 1964; a
number were involved in the Mis
sissippi Freedom project; and the
University's student body even en
dorsed, on paper, the FSM move
ment."
He cited the 1-19 ratio of teacher
to students as a further source of
dissatisfaction. Harvard, he noted,
has a ratio of 1-18.
"The furor over late-leaves for
coeds may well blow up into an

equivalent of the FSM furor," he
proposed.
On January 28, 1997, The Daily
ran an article detailing the switch
from the required freshman CIV
program to the current I HUM pro
gram.
CIV in its current form is ending.
Years of student dissatisfaction
have motivated a close look at the
Culture, Ideas and Values Pro
gram, and as a result of the findings,
the CIV Design and Review Com
mittee has decided to recommend a
change.
The new program, if approved
by the Faculty Senate, will remain
three quarters. However, CIV will
be taught in a one quarter-two
quarter sequence.
The first quarter, titled "Intro
duction to the Humanities," will be
team-taught and will examine only
three to five texts, each in great
depth. The second quarter will be a
truncated version of the current
CIV program.
The CIV review and Design
Committee, chaired by English
Prof. Robert Polhemus, has pro
posed that the first quarter consist
of only three tracks, with about 500
people in each. Students will exam
ine work through different disci
plines. Teams of professors will de
velop a lecture series based on at
least three different view points -
such as historical, literary and
philosophical perspectives.
