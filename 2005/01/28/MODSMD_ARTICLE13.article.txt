# Touching Tongues
## Manifesto for the Bacchanaliainclined 
### 
Recently, while reading the
nationally renowned and
critically acclaimed publi
cation you currently hold
in your hot little hands, your colum
nists came across an informative news
tidbit. We discovered that some
valiant bacchanalia-inclined soul is
attempting to extend the hour of
California's last call for booz-ahol.
Arguments in favor of debauchery
are few and far between on the hal
lowed grounds of our fair Farm, so we
sullied our noses with newsprint as
we pressed closer in to absorb the
information from the article.
To update you: sooner would pigs
fly out of your columnists' collective
nether-regions than the Governator

would sanc
tion our rag
ing further
into the
proverbial
night. But it
did get us
thinking:
Would any
one in the
vicinity of
Stanford
besides your
columnists,
their draw
mates and
the bums of

Palo Alto even notice two more
blessed hours of blacked-out social
ization?
Probably not.
We've been sick of the frat parties.
Bob parties. Cafe nights, how-do-so
manv-freshmen-even-know-where-
Synergy-is parties for some time now.
And for this reason we have actually
ventured out into the wilds of Palo
Alto bars. We've never seen you
there. How sad. In hopes that we can
inspire just one carpal-tunnel-afflict
ed kid to venture out into the dark
ness, we present the following treatise
on what to expect once you leave the
shade of the $30,000 palm trees.
In downtown Palo Alto you'll find
34-year-olds (where do they live, what
do they do?). Paly High kids and us.
That's it, and all crammed into only
two bars — Nola's and Blue Chalk.
Yes, there are other bars down
town. but nobody, because of some
weird unspoken law, ever really has
any fun in them. We don't make the
rules, we just write about their awk
wardness. Anyway, Q's closed, Gordon
Biersch is some kind of weird restau
rant and Rose and Crown is just an
alleyway with a dartboard. Oh, and
there's the new Old Pro, otherwise
known as overflow seating / waiting
room for Nola's.
Then there are those establish
ments that are a bit harder to get to,
but often worth the cab fare:The BBC
(British Bankers' Club, you loser),
The Nuthouse, the Oasis and the
Dutch Goose. However, these places
have their established crowds of old
folks (you know, late 20s, early 70s),
and they can get pretty territorial
when it comes to their "hip hangouts."
For drinking during the daylight
hours (you lush, you!) the Oasis
comes to mind again, but Zott's
(Alpine Inn. you really big loser) sells
forties, and is therefore the hot ish.
And if you're looking fora challenge,
its Portola Valley location makes it
the Holy Grail on the quest fora des
ignated driver.
If you're lazy and did not reach the
terminus of the Quest for the
Designated Driver, the CoHo and the
Treehouse are right here on campus.
The CoHo is a rip off. closes early and
almost never has anyone there to
serve you (only one person is
"trained" so you have to wait if they
take a pee / "I would rather be eaten
by wild dogs than serve you" break).
The Treehouse, therefore, becomes
the logical pick, and they'll let you
stick straws right into the pitcher
without too much ridicule.
We know it's not much, but these
venues do offer something slightly
different from flip-cup in the
Robinson bathroom. And to the guy
who wants to make last call later: in
the event that your mission is never
accomplished, you know who to call
between the wee hours of 2 and 4 a.m.

Angry that we left out Rudy's and the
F&As? Shove it. Or e-mail us at
inhstone@stanford.edu or lashnits@

The CoHo is a rip off. closes early and

The Treehouse, therefore, becomes
the logical pick, and they'll let you

We know it's not much, but these

Recently, while reading the
nationally renowned and
critically acclaimed publi
cation you currently hold
in your hot little hands, your colum
nists came across an informative news
tidbit. We discovered that some
valiant bacchanalia-inclined soul is
attempting to extend the hour of
California's last call for booz-ahol.
Arguments in favor of debauchery
are few and far between on the hal
lowed grounds of our fair Farm, so we
sullied our noses with newsprint as
we pressed closer in to absorb the
information from the article.
To update you: sooner would pigs
fly out of your columnists' collective
nether-regions than the Governator

would sanc
tion our rag
ing further
into the
proverbial
night. But it
did get us
thinking:
Would any
one in the
vicinity of
Stanford
besides your
columnists,
their draw
mates and
the bums of

Palo Alto even notice two more
blessed hours of blacked-out social
ization?
Probably not.
We've been sick of the frat parties.
Bob parties. Cafe nights, how-do-so
manv-freshmen-even-know-where-
Synergy-is parties for some time now.
And for this reason we have actually
ventured out into the wilds of Palo
Alto bars. We've never seen you
there. How sad. In hopes that we can
inspire just one carpal-tunnel-afflict
ed kid to venture out into the dark
ness, we present the following treatise
on what to expect once you leave the
shade of the $30,000 palm trees.
In downtown Palo Alto you'll find
34-year-olds (where do they live, what
do they do?). Paly High kids and us.
That's it, and all crammed into only
two bars — Nola's and Blue Chalk.
Yes, there are other bars down
town. but nobody, because of some
weird unspoken law, ever really has
any fun in them. We don't make the
rules, we just write about their awk
wardness. Anyway, Q's closed, Gordon
Biersch is some kind of weird restau
