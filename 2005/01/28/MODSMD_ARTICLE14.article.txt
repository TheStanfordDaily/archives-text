# Vacationing in the tropics or relaxing at home?
## SPRING BREAK 2005 
### By: NOAH WEISS 
Whether they want to eat gumbo and
crayfish in New Orleans, live la vida loca in
Cancun or master the MCAT at home, stu
dents have already started planning their
spring breaks. At the start of winter quar
ter, students are most preoccupied not with
finals week but the week after: spring
break.
Those who are not participating in
group-organized event — such as
Alternative Spring Break or trips organ
ized by classes — seem to fall into one of
two schools of thought for what makes the
best spring break.
One camp holds that after a hectic quar
ter and taxing finals week, the best thing to
do is to rest, relax and catch up on work
they pushed back because of class. For
these students, spring break is a time to
recuperate.
Other students need a release. Instead
of taking a week to recover, these students
spend a week traveling around the
Caribbean, drinking all day long and club
bing until the morning.
Junior Jared Miller adheres to the first
school of spring break planning and
believes that this year's break is the perfect
time to prepare for the MCAT.
Miller rationalized his decision to devote
his break to studying by looking at how he
has spent the majority of his past spring
breaks. He has traveled only once before.
"Freshman year, I went to Europe with
my older brother," he said. "You may have
seen the film Euro Trip, which was based on
our travels," he joked.
For Miller, "watching TV for the major
ity of the day and purchasing a video
game" was his "ideal" spring break.
"Europe was an aberration," he added.
Last year. Miller enjoyed his newly
installed satellite television.
"1 really infused myself in MTV culture
and discovered the wonders of DirecTV" he
said. "By about 3 p.m. 1 just waited for my
mom to come home with dinner. On
Thursday nights 1 would watch the OC, and
on all other nights I wished it was Thursday."
This year, Miller wants to replace his
past lethargy with productivity.
"I just want to study and get [the
MCAT] over with," he said.
Junior Raf Zuzuarregui agreed with
Miller that spring break presented the per
fect opportunity to catch up on non-school
related work.
"Because 1 am so busy with stuff during

the school year, 1 generally tend to try to
get my business handled during the
breaks." Zuzuarregui said.
This break Zuzuarregui is going to his
friend's wedding and helping his parents
pack for their upcoming move in April.
After spring break, Zuzuarregui likes to
have "a sense that I've handled my to-dos
and I'm set to hit the next quarter run
ning," he said. "I need the break to chill."
Unlike the upperclassmen who vacation
with people from Stanford, freshmen often
spend their spring breaks with their high
school friends.
"I'm planning on going to my family's
beach house in Ventura with my girlfriend
and several of our friends from high
school," said freshman Keenan Hahn. "I'll

probably go surfing, boogie boarding and
look at the tide pools and starfish."
Hahn will be going with a coed group of
friends, for which he has parental approval.
"All of us have known each other for so
long that the girl-boy mixing in rooms
doesn't matter," he said.
Instead of viewing spring break as a
time to catch up on work. Hahn sees it as a
time to catch up with friends outside of
Stanford.
"1 just want to relax and not think about
school fora week," he said. "I want to have
fun at the beach with all my high school
friends and catch up."
Although many students enjoy a mellow
spring break after a strenuous quarter, oth
ers find that the best way to release the
pressure is to let loose.

"A few close friends and I are planning
on going to Mexico, probably Cancun " said
senior Gabriel Martinez. "My friends and I
have always wanted to do a traditional col
lege spring break with lots of partying in an
exotic location, and as seniors this is the
last chance we have."
Martinez plans to go with three male
friends.
"No significant others allowed on this
one," he said.
To reduce the stress of planning a vaca
tion, Martinez said they intend to buy an
inclusive deal.
Martinez has three simple goals: "Fun
times, great memories and going out with a
bang."
Around 20 members of the fraternity

Sigma Alpha Epsilon also have plans to go
to Mexico, where for their annual spring
break trip they have rented a "luxurious
mansion" in Acapulco, according to junior
Jeff Nardinelli.
"I hope to get the time of my life, and
most importantly to share a week with the
gentlemen of SAE," Nardinelli said. "More
importantly, though, is what I hope not to
get: bumps, rashes, gratuitous alcohol poi
soning, or a surprise knock on my door a
year from now from a woman holding a
young baby."
"Especially if said woman is alongside
Maury Povich," he added. "Though I would
like to be on TV."
Junior Stedman Wilson and sophomore
Baiju Bhatt are looking fora fun time in
New Orleans.

"We plan on drinking heavily every
night," Wilson said. "We will both be 21. so
going to bars should prove the appropriate
means of hell-raising."
But Wilson is heading to the Big Easy
for more than just booze. He said he wants
to explore the culture of the city, too.
"We are hoping that some of the jazz
and bad ass music culture of'NTawlins 1 will
rub off on us," he said. "We also can't wait
to get a taste of the Deep South, something
that both of us, having grown up in the
South, feel is a must."
Rather than staying in one city, senior
Chin Lum Kwa is taking a cruise around
the Caribbean. Kwa went to Seatlle and
Vancouver during freshman year; Florida
sophomore year; and Minnesota and
Chicago junior year.
"I like to travel, so usually I am the driv
ing force behind a lot of these trips." Kwa
said.
A veteran traveler. Kwa has found two
factors crucial in making fora good trip: a
group that is "same-sex, three to four peo
ple" and establishing a budget early.
Even athletes like Olympic swimmer
junior Kristin Caverly can go on wild
spring break trips; when in training, most
athletes stick to a strict schedule. Freshman
year she rented a house on the coast of
Newport Beach with three friends from
Stanford.
"We would go to the beach and lie out
and get tan during the day, and come back
to party in the evening with the many
friends we had invited over." Caverly said.
Sophomore year, Caverly wanted to go
someplace more exciting.
"My same girl friends from my freshman
year spring break decided that we needed
to go somewhere that had a real wild and
crazy spring break," she said. They decided
on Cancun, Mexico.
"Every night we partied and drank at a
club," she said. "The day was spent passed
out in the sand getting tanned and drinking
the free drinks. After some intense nights
of partying we would not return home until
the morning."
Despite getting food poisoning, which
forced her to stay in bed for days, Caverly
remembers the trip fondly.
"Overall it was an interesting experi
ence," she said. "One that many college stu
dents should try, if not watch."
Students value their spring breaks as a
needed week of reprieve from the fast
paced quarters, no matter which break phi
losophy they ascribe to.
