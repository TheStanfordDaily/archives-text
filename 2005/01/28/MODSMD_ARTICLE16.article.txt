## Editor's Note Reflections on a work in progress 
### 
I couldn't answer all the e-mails. There were just
too many. Thirty-five, 45 a day. And I couldn't
get all the computer problems fixed. Sometimes
the newspaper looks a little funny because of it.
There are extra lines here and there or a strange U
shaped symbol instead of a diamond next to the page
number.
We couldn't follow up on all the good story leads.
There were events that we missed. Stories that we
were late in covering. Mistakes in articles, in head
lines, in captions.
But as I sit in my office on my last day as editor in
chief of The Daily, I am less concerned with our short
comings than with what we accomplished: We, a
group ol students who are all taking classes in addition
to our work at the paper, put out 60 issues of news,
features, photos, sports stories, columns. We dealt
with setbacks, overcame personality conflicts, pulled
all-nighters, sacrificed our social lives and our class
work, and put out a volume's worth of interesting and
entertaining content.
When I began my term as editor in chief, my main
goal was to make the news page a must-read on cam
pus. To improve both the timeliness and the depth
of our coverage, and to not just report on official
events but to capture the richness and variety of
campus life through profiles of people and features
about trends.
As I prepare to clean out my office to make way for
the next editor in chief, Cynthia Cho, I'm not sure if
The Daily is a must-read yet. But I think we're mak
ing progress.
A few weeks ago, as we toasted Cynthia on her
election, someone said "Here's to a better volume
than Will's!" He turned to me laughing and said, "Just
kidding. Will."
I hope he wasn't.
I am extremely proud of the work that this vol
ume's staff has done. We produced sustained, insight
ful coverage of big issues like stem cell research, the

new Munger residence buildings and local and na
tional election issues. We told the compelling stories
of Stanford students and community members, in
cluding a former EPATT tutee, a basketball star and
a custodian who is learning English. Our eager and
talented reporters and our dedicated editors did re
markable work.
But to say that the paper can be better next vol
ume is not an insult. What we accomplished, others
will build on. The Daily will continue to improve.
We re-introduced the beat system to the news de
partment; next volume, it will be more established and
should run more smoothly. We emphasized covering
the drama of sports and not just the numbers; next vol
ume, the sports section will also focus more on the in
dividual athletes' personalities. We re-organized the
front-page layout to accommodate more stories; next
volume, that layout will be more professional and
standardized.
One thing I learned from my five months as editor
is that there is a limit to how much one can reasonably
expect to accomplish in such a short time. But 1 think
The Daily is on an upward trajectory, and that's what
gives me the most satisfaction.
And if I never e-mailed you back, maybe the next
editor will.
