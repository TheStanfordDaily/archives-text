## Congressman's speech deserved coverage 
### OLIVIA SOHNS 
I am very disappointed that The
Daily failed to cover Paul Findley's
speech on Tuesday night about "The
Peril of America's Middle East Poli
cies," which was sponsored by the
Speakers' Bureau and Coalition for
Justice in the Middle East.
Paul Findley served as a Republi
can Congressman from Illinios for 22
years, and he gave a very compelling
speech on Tuesday night, one that
provided insights into the workings
of Congress and how, in his opinion,
strong pro-Israel lobbies like
AIPAC have been influencing our
foriegn policy in the Middle East to
the detriment of our interests in the
region.
Findley argued that the pro-Is
rael stance of Congress has exacer
bated the tragic situation of the
Palestinians. He also argued that it
has fueled terrorism by demonstrat
ing to the Arab world that the Unit
ed States is biased and untrustwor
thy and has harmed our internation
al prestige by alienating countries
from us that are concerned about Is
rael's "brutality" and "apartheid
like policies" towards the Palestini
an people.
Findley also discussed the way in
which the U.S. government has re
peatedly misled the American peo
ple, changing the justification for
war against Iraq from finding
weapons of mass destruction, to re

moving Saddam Hussein, to democ
ratizing the region. With its nebu
lous intentions, Findley commented
that it is no wonder that the Arab
world does not trust the administra
tion, and how the decision for going
to war was rendered undemocratic
because the American people were
not correctly informed.
In Findley's opinion, the true mo
tivation of the Bush administration
for launching a war on Iraq was root
ed in the administration's new con
cept of international relations: one
which abandons the precept of the
sovereignty of nation states and per
mits the use of U.S. force, not as a
last resort, but as an instrument of
U.S. hegemony to serve as a "world
policeman."
Findley lamented the way in
which Congress has granted Bush
unlimited powers to make war, and
also the way in which the American
people have succumbed to false rep
resentations of Islam, as demonstrat
ed by a poll he sited which reported
that 46 percent of Americans think
that the civil liberties of all Muslims
should be curtailed.
Findley stated that neither are all
terrorists Muslim nor are all Mus
lims terrorists. He expressed his dis
approval of the way in which the ad
ministration fails to address the caus
es of terrorism by refusing to exam
ine the grievances that terrorists use
to recruit new members, and instead
merely seeks to remove the symp-

Toms of the "cancer" of terrorism by
taking away people's civil and legal
rights and labeling them "enemy
combatants."
Furthermore, Findley offered
dire projections for the future of U.S.
intervention in the Middle East. He
called the decision to invade Iraq
"the worst mistake in the history of
United States foriegn policy," and
believes that the situation there will
simply get worse. He mentioned
that Iran is the next target for the
Bush administration because of its
hostile stance towards the United
States and its nuclear plans. In Find
ley's opinion, intervention in Iran
would be an even greater provoca
tion to the Arab world and would
further entrench us in war with the
region.
Findley noted that one of the con
tradictions in U.S. foriegn policy to
ward Iran and Iraq is that we ourse
ves have the largest nuclear capabil
ity in the world, are the only nation
to have used a nuclear bomb as an in
strument of war and have also
helped Israel develop its nuclear
program. At the end of his speech
Findley encouraged the audience to
speak out against false stereotyping
of Muslims and to oppose the Bush
administration's perilous policies in
the Middle East.
