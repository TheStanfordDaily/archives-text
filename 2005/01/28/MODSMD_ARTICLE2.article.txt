# Tree stolen; Band fingers Cal
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a heist more fitting for pre-Big Game
day than fora chilly January Monday,
thieves allegedly broke into the Tree Room
of the Band Shak last week and stole the
Band mascot's costume, valued at over
$2,500.
The incident was reported to the Stan
ford Police Department.
"I took a report fora burglary at the
Band Shak fora costume on Jan. 18," said
Deputy Vincent Larson. Larson declined to
comment on the method of entry because of
the ongoing investigation. The detective in
charge of the investigation could not be
reached by press time.
The burglars have not been identified,
nor have they contacted senior Isaac Salier-
Hellendag. the student who dons the outfit
at sporting events for the Band as the Tree.
But circumstances surrounding the crime
lead many Band members to suspect stu
dents from UC-Berkeley to be the perpetra
tors.
"Well, obviously the villains behind the
crime have an abundance of time on their
hands, a hatred of children and all things
fun, and a heart three sizes too small," junior
Chris Holt, the Band's public relations di
rector and a columnist for The Daily. "Since
Andy Dick wasn't in town, we're guessing it
was the Weenies. The Tree is not just the
mascot of the Stanford Band, a symbol of
the University, and a genuinely cool thing to
look at, but also a children's icon that is
adored by millions."
The fact that the Tree's costume was
stolen does not come as a surprise to some,
since just last year the costume was swiped
twice, first during a Pier 39 Band rally during
Big Game week and again during winter
break when the University was officially

closed.
In fact, the Tree's costume has been a tar
get for years. In the early 19905, the Tree was
stolen, only to be recovered and ceremoni
ously destroyed by the Band.
Many students also remember last year's
Big Game halftime festivities, when the re
covered Tree costume was destroyed via a
wood chipper. The Tree sported a different
costume during that game and later built a
new one.
There also have been several attempts to
steal the costume during 2005, none of
which were successful.
"During Big Game week. Band members
were in and around the Shak around the
clock, at one point preventing a group from
Cal from stealing the costume," Salier-Hel
lendag said. "Over winter break, there were
still more attempts. I had decided to keep
my costume in my room at Slavianski Dom
during the holiday, so again, the thieves
were unsuccessful."
It is the timing and circumstances of this
theft, however, that have left Band members
reeling.
"Unfortunately, mid-January was not a
time any of us really expected as a reason
able period fora break-in, so security
around the costume was relatively low,"
Salier-Hellendag said. "Last winter break,
[former Tree] Will Rothacker's costume
was stolen from the same room, and the
thieves actually cut the entire lock from the
door to break in. We rely on the University
and the Athletic Department to repair these
things, and over the past year, the lock was
never replaced."
According to Salier-Hellendag, the theft
had to be well-thought-out due to the cos
tume's bulk.

a car, I have no idea," he said. "It's
six feet tall and, even broken down
into pieces, is almost impossible to
fit into an SUV. My guess is that they
would have had to use a very large
van, which means they may have
needed to plan extensively before
acting. Renting large vans, or at least
finding a guy who'll let you borrow
one, can be tricky and time-consum
ing."
Salier-Hellendag has already
started making a new costume and
hopes to get funding for it from the
Band and the Athletics Department.
"(The costume] will be the same

design as the stolen costume, but
smaller and lighter," he said. "I'll be
able to move more quickly in it. On a
scale of one to 10, my old costume
was an 11. The new one will be a 13."
Holt added that the theft would
not affect the Band's spirit.
"What the Weenies don't under
stand is that although they may take
the costume, the Tree is a person, an
ideal, not just a system of green cloth
and wiring," he said. "The tree cos
tume has been stolen, but the Tree
stands strong and proud in Stanford
territory. The Tree will never die."

"Unfortunately, mid-January was not a
time any of us really expected as a reason
able period fora break-in, so security
around the costume was relatively low,"
Salier-Hellendag said. "Last winter break,
[former Tree] Will Rothacker's costume
was stolen from the same room, and the
thieves actually cut the entire lock from the
door to break in. We rely on the University
and the Athletic Department to repair these
things, and over the past year, the lock was
never replaced."
According to Salier-Hellendag, the theft
had to be well-thought-out due to the cos
tume's bulk.

Senior Isaac Salier-Hellendag, the Tree, takes out his frustration on
the sewing machine he has slaved over to make a new costume.

a car, I have no idea," he said. "It's
six feet tall and, even broken down
into pieces, is almost impossible to
fit into an SUV. My guess is that they
would have had to use a very large
van, which means they may have
needed to plan extensively before
acting. Renting large vans, or at least
finding a guy who'll let you borrow
one, can be tricky and time-consum
ing."
Salier-Hellendag has already
started making a new costume and
hopes to get funding for it from the
Band and the Athletics Department.
"(The costume] will be the same

design as the stolen costume, but
smaller and lighter," he said. "I'll be
able to move more quickly in it. On a
scale of one to 10, my old costume
was an 11. The new one will be a 13."
Holt added that the theft would
not affect the Band's spirit.
"What the Weenies don't under
stand is that although they may take
the costume, the Tree is a person, an
ideal, not just a system of green cloth
and wiring," he said. "The tree cos
tume has been stolen, but the Tree
stands strong and proud in Stanford
territory. The Tree will never die."
In a heist more fitting for pre-Big Game
day than fora chilly January Monday,
thieves allegedly broke into the Tree Room
of the Band Shak last week and stole the
Band mascot's costume, valued at over
$2,500.
The incident was reported to the Stan
ford Police Department.
"I took a report fora burglary at the
Band Shak fora costume on Jan. 18," said
Deputy Vincent Larson. Larson declined to
comment on the method of entry because of
the ongoing investigation. The detective in
charge of the investigation could not be
reached by press time.
The burglars have not been identified,
nor have they contacted senior Isaac Salier-
Hellendag. the student who dons the outfit
at sporting events for the Band as the Tree.
But circumstances surrounding the crime
lead many Band members to suspect stu
dents from UC-Berkeley to be the perpetra
tors.
"Well, obviously the villains behind the
crime have an abundance of time on their
hands, a hatred of children and all things
fun, and a heart three sizes too small," junior
Chris Holt, the Band's public relations di
rector and a columnist for The Daily. "Since
Andy Dick wasn't in town, we're guessing it
was the Weenies. The Tree is not just the
mascot of the Stanford Band, a symbol of
the University, and a genuinely cool thing to
look at, but also a children's icon that is
adored by millions."
The fact that the Tree's costume was
stolen does not come as a surprise to some,
since just last year the costume was swiped
twice, first during a Pier 39 Band rally during
Big Game week and again during winter
break when the University was officially

closed.
In fact, the Tree's costume has been a tar
get for years. In the early 19905, the Tree was
stolen, only to be recovered and ceremoni
ously destroyed by the Band.
Many students also remember last year's
Big Game halftime festivities, when the re
covered Tree costume was destroyed via a
wood chipper. The Tree sported a different
costume during that game and later built a
new one.
There also have been several attempts to
steal the costume during 2005, none of
which were successful.
"During Big Game week. Band members
were in and around the Shak around the
clock, at one point preventing a group from
Cal from stealing the costume," Salier-Hel
lendag said. "Over winter break, there were
still more attempts. I had decided to keep
my costume in my room at Slavianski Dom
during the holiday, so again, the thieves
were unsuccessful."
It is the timing and circumstances of this
theft, however, that have left Band members
reeling.
