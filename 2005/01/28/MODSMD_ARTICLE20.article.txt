## Reasons for hope in Iraq 
### WILL NELSON 
With the long-awaited Iraqi elec
tion just two days away, there seems
to he no let up in the rate and feroc
ity of insurgent attacks. But there
are signs of hope amid the awful sto
ries of mayhem and tragic loss of
life.
Success in Iraq requires
widespread support for democracy
and a relatively open society. Thank
fully, this appears to be the case, at
least among the long-oppressed Shiite
and Kurdish populations.
News outlets have recently car
ried numerous reports of Iraqis
openly supporting the elections and
democracy. The defiant tone of their
statements inspires confidence that
decades of brutal dictatorship and
nearly two years of bloody insurgen
cy have not drained the desire for
freedom from many Iraqis.
The New York Times recently
quoted an Iraqi man saying. "Even if
there's a bomb in my polling place. I
will go in it." A Christian woman liv
ing in Baghdad said, "Scared? If
God wants me, he can take me. I'm
voting."
Another Iraqi seemed to really
capture the democratic spirit when
he opined, "[Voting] is the most im
portant pillar in building a free
country."
There will surely be violence on
polling day. There may even be
enough violence to derail the elec
tion and push Iraq further toward
civil war.
But regardless of what happens
Sunday, it is clear that the desire for
democracy and freedom is alive in
the hearts of many Iraqis. The
courage of multitudes of common
Iraqis is a testament to the universal
and enduring appeal of democracy.
Amir Taheri of the Saudi online
newspaper Arab News reports that
nearly three quarters of eligible
Iraqi voters have registered. These
voters will choose from a list of 111
candidate coalitions.
There are over 6,(XX) declared
candidates, ranging from commu
nists and democrats to Islamists and
even monarchists. I wonder if there
are any republicans.
Television stations in major cities
are airing slick political ads com
plete with dramatic music and well
worded taglines.
Interim Prime Minister Ayad
Allawi's popularity is increasing,
and some expect his ticket to be one
of the top vote-getters.
That's not bad for someone with
strong ties to the coalition, not to

mention the CIA. and who autho
rized the November attack on Fallu
ja. Allawi's growing popularity
demonstrates that many Iraqis are
willing to look past their hatred for
the occupation and choose what
they think is best fora democratic
Iraq.
Some doubted that common
Iraqis would prefer democracy to
Saddam Hussein's brutal but pre
dictable rule. They criticized the
Bush administration for overselling
democracy, for being naive about its
appeal.
History is not yet written, but the
fact that so many Iraqis enthusiasti
cally embrace the election process is
a sure sign of hope that Bush did not
oversell democracy.
Some may say it was never a
question of whether the Iraqis
would embrace freedom and
democracy. After all, everyone ac
cepts such ideals, right?
The insurgents surely don't.
Taheri of the Arab News reports the
slogan "From the ballot box into the
coffin" appearing on walls through
out the Sunni Triangle.
A businessman from Falluja
claimed "Zionists" are behind the
election and said, "This election is
not free or honest." At least he pre
tends to object to a single election,
not all elections.
Abu Musab A1 Zarqawi, the no
torious leader of AI Qaeda in Iraq,
went a bit further. "We have de
clared a bitter war against the princi
ple of democracy and all those who
seek to enact it,"he says. "Those
who vote ... are infidels."
Perhaps Bush had this guy in
mind when he said, "They hate our
freedoms."
This election forced Zarqawi's
hand. He had to show himself for
what he is: not a righteous freedom
fighter, but a vicious killer with ex
tremist religious ideas and no regard
for common Iraqis.
In contrast, the election also
demonstrates the good will of the
United States and the coalition in
bringing democracy to Iraq. On
election day, hopefully, the world
will witness the great majority of
Iraqis enthusiastically embracing
their democratic future.
And perhaps this showcase of
two starkly different visions for the
future of Iraq will help change some
minds about the United States and
its detractors.
