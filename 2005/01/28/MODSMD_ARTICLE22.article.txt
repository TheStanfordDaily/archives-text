Tsunami survivors need support
I know that in recent weeks we
have all looked for ways to support
relief efforts for the hundreds of
thousands of people who are suffer
ing as a result of the earthquake and
tsunami in South Asia.
I have been deeply moved by the
compassion of Stanford students
who have organized a group called
Stanford Student Relief to support
disaster relief efforts of the interna
tional community.
The student group has selected
Save the Children as the beneficiary
of their disaster-related fundraising
efforts. The students have set a goal
to raise $100,000 from members of
the Stanford community.

My family and I want to support
their efforts in bringing humani
tarian aid to the victims of the
tsunami and have made a commit
ment to match up to $5,000 in stu
dent contributions.
As you well know, Stanford has
long played a role in helping people
in need, and one of our most illustri
ous alumni, Herbert Hoover, will
long be remembered for heroic ef
forts to feed millions of hungry peo
ple in Europe after both World Wars.
I hope you will join me in sup
porting our students as they continue
a university tradition of taking on the
responsibilities of world citizens and
supporting those in dire need of our
help.
Donations can be made through

the group's Web site at

The small people thank Nick From
I just wanted to write and say
thank you. Nick Fram ("School for
the Gifted," Jan. 26). Thank you for
telling my story. I applied to Stan
ford but was rejected, and I am so
relieved to know that you. who got
in. have the gifts to solve the prob
lems that will plague my future,
Stanford-less life of misery.
I am an immigrant laborer from
San Francisco who's going to com
munity college at night, just making

it on Social Security and trying to
survive my bout with a rare form of
cancer — cancer of the mind.
Unfortunately, I can't go off of
work to recover from my cancer,
because my HMO won't pay for it.
and I need to keep going to work so
I can retire by the time I'm 95. My
dreams of going to office hours and
having intellectually stimulating
conversations are shot, and all my
friends are goons who don't under
stand that I once aspired to change
the world.
The only thing that keeps me
getting up in the morning is the
knowledge that you and your ilk
are out there, fighting to cure all my
ills, and going to office hours. You
lucky, gifted bastards.

I once wished 1 could he one of
you, hut now. when I get off work
every two years (and I'm not in too
much pain from my cancer), I go on
free tours of the Stanford campus
and wander the libraries, imagining
1 am one of you. At the end of the
day, however. I must go home to my
wretched, doomed life and empty
cupboards.
Perhaps I can never be gifted
like you, but at least I know that I
have a place in your heart.
Yours Sincerely,

In defense of the
Maples renovations
As a season-ticket holder for the
last six years and Cardinal basket
ball fan for more than 20 years. I
have to disagree with Christopher
Anderson's assessment of the
Maples renovations. I really like
the new stadium.
I like not having to wait in line to
go to the bathroom — I like it even
more that my kids don't have to ei
ther. I like having a greater variety
of choices in concessions, too.
I also like the new scoreboard —
a lot. The video screen and the
point totals for all players in the
