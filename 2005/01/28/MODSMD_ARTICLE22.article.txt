Tsunami survivors need support
I know that in recent weeks we
have all looked for ways to support
relief efforts for the hundreds of
thousands of people who are suffer
ing as a result of the earthquake and
tsunami in South Asia.
I have been deeply moved by the
compassion of Stanford students
who have organized a group called
Stanford Student Relief to support
disaster relief efforts of the interna
tional community.
The student group has selected
Save the Children as the beneficiary
of their disaster-related fundraising
efforts. The students have set a goal
to raise $100,000 from members of
the Stanford community.

My family and I want to support
their efforts in bringing humani
tarian aid to the victims of the
tsunami and have made a commit
ment to match up to $5,000 in stu
dent contributions.
As you well know, Stanford has
long played a role in helping people
in need, and one of our most illustri
ous alumni, Herbert Hoover, will
long be remembered for heroic ef
forts to feed millions of hungry peo
ple in Europe after both World Wars.
I hope you will join me in sup
porting our students as they continue
a university tradition of taking on the
responsibilities of world citizens and
supporting those in dire need of our
help.
Donations can be made through

the group's Web site at

The small people thank Nick From
I just wanted to write and say
thank you. Nick Fram ("School for
the Gifted," Jan. 26). Thank you for
telling my story. I applied to Stan
ford but was rejected, and I am so
relieved to know that you. who got
in. have the gifts to solve the prob
lems that will plague my future,
Stanford-less life of misery.
I am an immigrant laborer from
San Francisco who's going to com
munity college at night, just making

it on Social Security and trying to
survive my bout with a rare form of
cancer — cancer of the mind.
Unfortunately, I can't go off of
work to recover from my cancer,
because my HMO won't pay for it.
and I need to keep going to work so
I can retire by the time I'm 95. My
dreams of going to office hours and
having intellectually stimulating
conversations are shot, and all my
friends are goons who don't under
stand that I once aspired to change
the world.
The only thing that keeps me
getting up in the morning is the
knowledge that you and your ilk
are out there, fighting to cure all my
ills, and going to office hours. You
lucky, gifted bastards.

I once wished 1 could he one of
you, hut now. when I get off work
every two years (and I'm not in too
much pain from my cancer), I go on
free tours of the Stanford campus
and wander the libraries, imagining
1 am one of you. At the end of the
day, however. I must go home to my
wretched, doomed life and empty
cupboards.
Perhaps I can never be gifted
like you, but at least I know that I
have a place in your heart.
Yours Sincerely,
Juan Doe

In defense of the
Maples renovations
As a season-ticket holder for the
last six years and Cardinal basket
ball fan for more than 20 years. I
have to disagree with Christopher
Anderson's assessment of the
Maples renovations. I really like
the new stadium.
I like not having to wait in line to
go to the bathroom — I like it even
more that my kids don't have to ei
ther. I like having a greater variety
of choices in concessions, too.
I also like the new scoreboard —
a lot. The video screen and the
point totals for all players in the
New Maples
attracts recruits

game is a very nice addition.
Having seen both the visitors
and home team locker rooms in
both the old and new Maples, I can
say that while the accommodations
are better for our opponents, the
magnitude of improvement for the
home team is much greater.
1 also believe that Anderson
overlooks one important aspect to
the improvements — recruiting.
The new additions include some
things that can make a difference in
a recruit's decision. It's tough
enough to get a blue-chip athlete
admitted to Stanford. Let's not
make Trent Johnson and his staff's
job tougher than it already is by
having an uncompetitive facility.
As for not having a place to sit
down, if he wants to trade his Sixth
Man plank for my seat for the Cal
game, he's got a deal.

Emergency contraception story
quotes uniformed sources
I am appalled with the misinfor
mation about emergency contra
ception conveyed in Thursday's ar
ticle "F.D.A. stalls morning-after
pill decision again." The story re
lies on a member of Stanford Stu
dents for Life to give unbiased
medical information about the
mechanism of action of lev
onorgestrel, or Plan B.
Unfortunately, the member of
Stanford Students for Life who was
quoted, Dennis Adams, is incorrect
in his understanding of how Plan B
works. Scientific studies of lev
onorgestrel indicate that its prima
ry action is to prevent fertilization
in the first place, with preventing
implantation as only a secondary
and conjectured effect.
In fact, a recent journal article
by Horatio B. Croxatto, "Mecha
nisms of Action of Emergency
Contraception," indicates that,
"from a physiological and pharma
cological point of view," lev
onorgestrel preventing implanta
tion of a fertilized egg is "highly un
likely." Furthermore, the author
points out that "publications in ref
ereed journals do not support the
hypothesis that it [levonorgestrel]
alters endometrial receptivity or

impedes implantation."
Journalism requires back
ground research to confirm the
claims by partisan or biased
sources. Misinformation can be
harmful, especially when it in
volves the health and happiness of
members of our own community.
Instead of portraying only unin
formed opinions on an issue,
maybe you should try offering the
facts.

Compromise needed in
addressing abortion
Sam Lord made a genuine con
tribution to the pro-choice / pro
life debate with his letter "Anti
and pro-abortion groups both do
not address the other side" yester
day. He's right that the two sides
tend to talk past each other, but his
summary of the real issues to the
debate falls short.
Lord states that "if a fetus has a
right to live, then a woman's choice
becomes moot." In fact, this does
not follow. Imagine, for example,
that I were striken with kidney dis
ease and certain to die unless you
agreed to donate one of your work
ing kidneys to me.
No one would doubt that I have
a right to life or that you have a
right to choose what to do with
your own body. But should the gov
ernment step in and force you to
make a medical decision to protect
my life? As a pro-choicer, I would
say no.
To be clear, I don't believe that
a fetus, as a collection of cells,
should enjoy the same "right to
life" that you or I do. Rather. I
think its rights should be more akin
to those of a non-sentient animal—
no one objects to euthanizing a dog
to test for rabies in order to pre
vent the suffering a human would
undergo from needless rabies
treatment. But even if you were to
grant a fetus the same rights as a vi
able human being, this still does
not imply that the government
should be regulating women's
medical decisions.
