## Haitians take issue with inaugural speech and method; Bush should tread lightly 
### SASHA KRAMER 
"lt is the policy of the United States to seek and sup
port the growth of democratic movements and institu
tions in every nation and culture."
— George W. Bush, Jan. 20,2005
Haitians have a radically different perspective of US
foreign policy...
The U.S.-sponsored overthrow of Haiti's democrati
cally elected government in February of last year has
pushed the country to a new level of desperation. Thou
sands of community organizers have been driven into
hiding and members of the former Haitian military,
many known human rights abusers, have taken over
towns throughout Haiti and are rapidly being integrated
into the national police force in the capital.
There have been over 3000 politically motivated
killings and the prisons are overflowing. Human rights
organizations estimate that only I in 50 prisoners have
been convicted of crimes and there are approximately

700 political prisoners, including prominent members
of Aristide's Lavalas party, in Port-au-Prince alone.
In August and December 2004 I traveled to Haiti as a
human rights observer. I met with political prisoners,
elected officials driven into hiding, labor organizers, and
UN and police officials and came away with a very dif
ferent perspective on political violence in Haiti then the
one portrayed by most US media outlets.
In the poor communities that I visited in Port au
Prince and Cap Haitien the overwhelming majority of
residents were angry. They feel that their fledgling
democracy and the laws and procedures dictated by the
constitution have been taken away from them by a rela
tively small armed force and an international communi
ty intent on removing the president they elected.
One thing I heard over and over in Haiti was that this
coup is worse than the coup in 1991. In 1991 it was clear
that Aristide was overthrown by the military and the in
ternational community stood behind the vote of the peo
ple and publicly isolated the illegal regime.
The coup of February 29,2004 was better orchestrat-

Ed with a fierce disinformation campaign that demo
nized Aristide and continues to demonize the Lavalas
movement. Additionally, Aristide maintains that he was
kidnapped by the U.S. government, an accusation that
helps explain the unwillingness of the Bush Administra
tion to investigate the circumstances under which he left
the country. U.S. media coverage of Haiti has been
characterized by disinformation and general disinterest.
The result is misunderstanding and inaction on the part
of the international academic and peace and social jus
tice communities.
Tonight Father Gerard Jean-Juste, a beloved Haitian
priest, friend of President Aristide and recent political
prisoner, will be speaking at Stanford. We have a unique
opportunity to send a message to the Haitian people that
they are not alone.
If we can fill Braun Auditorium on Friday night
Father Jean-Juste will take that message back to the
people, through his church and his radio program.
During the period of military dictatorship from 1991-
1994 the Stanford community played an important

role in the movement to reestablish democracy in
Haiti, from hunger strikes to inviting Aristide to
speak in 1993.
I encourage people to come out on Friday night to
hear more about political repression in Haiti from the
perspective of someone deeply connected to poor com
munities in Port au Prince who has seen the inside of
Haiti's prisons. We have a chance to give hope to thou
sands of people who feel isolated and alone and learn a
great deal in the process.
"In the long run, there is no justice without freedom,
and there can be no human rights without human liber
ty." — George W. Bush, Jan. 20,2005
On this point the Haitian majority would agree com
pletely.

Ed with a fierce disinformation campaign that demo
nized Aristide and continues to demonize the Lavalas
movement. Additionally, Aristide maintains that he was
kidnapped by the U.S. government, an accusation that
helps explain the unwillingness of the Bush Administra
tion to investigate the circumstances under which he left
the country. U.S. media coverage of Haiti has been
characterized by disinformation and general disinterest.
The result is misunderstanding and inaction on the part
of the international academic and peace and social jus
tice communities.
Tonight Father Gerard Jean-Juste, a beloved Haitian
priest, friend of President Aristide and recent political
prisoner, will be speaking at Stanford. We have a unique
opportunity to send a message to the Haitian people that
they are not alone.
If we can fill Braun Auditorium on Friday night
Father Jean-Juste will take that message back to the
people, through his church and his radio program.
During the period of military dictatorship from 1991-
1994 the Stanford community played an important

role in the movement to reestablish democracy in
Haiti, from hunger strikes to inviting Aristide to
speak in 1993.
I encourage people to come out on Friday night to
hear more about political repression in Haiti from the
perspective of someone deeply connected to poor com
munities in Port au Prince who has seen the inside of
Haiti's prisons. We have a chance to give hope to thou
sands of people who feel isolated and alone and learn a
great deal in the process.
"In the long run, there is no justice without freedom,
and there can be no human rights without human liber
ty." — George W. Bush, Jan. 20,2005
On this point the Haitian majority would agree com
pletely.
