## Dance Marathon: A new Stanford tradition 
### 
First year a success
We believe strongly in Dance
Marathon: in its power to unite Stan
ford, to educate about health crises,
and to bring out the personal charity
and generosity in all of us.
It is our hope that this year's event
will mark the beginning of a long-last
ing Stanford tradition. Dance
Marathon — from the planning pro
cess through the event itself — has
been a profoundly rewarding experi
ence. It has changed our lives. We will
carry with us forever the inspiration
that there is a need to make the world
better and that it is possible to do so.
Dance Marathon has also had a
deep impact on many of the partici
pants. Included below in this section
is a reflection from Sarah Kleinman,
one of the dancers.

Why it matters to me
It was 11:30 am. and I was in tears. I

couldn't stop crying. I had been on my
feet for 23 and a half hours. During the
closing ceremonies of Stanford's First
Annual Dance Marathon, I saw many
exhausted students squatting, kneeling
and leaning on each other for support
— but not one was sitting. That is why
I was crying.
A friend asked me, "Why is it so
important to dance the whole time if
you've already turned in your
money?" The answer is simple:
Those of us who lasted all 24 hours
had committed ourselves to the cause
— psychologically, as well as mone
tarily.
It was more difficult than I ever
imagined it would be. My legs were
burning. My feet were aching. My
head was pounding. There were
times when all I could think about
was hiding in the dressing rooms fora
few minutes of rest. But I didn't. And
when the event was over, I was proud
of myself. I was even more proud of
my school and the dedicated individ
uals who made this such a wonderful
experience. So I cried. And so did ev
eryone else.
The room suddenly erupted as the
DJ played the last song of the event:
the Stanford Fight Song. No one was
counting down the seconds; all of us
were on our feet — yelling, singing,
dancing like we hadn't danced all

night. The positive energy was over
whelming: We did it.
During this final explosion of en
ergy, 1 was thinking about Ben Banks
— who spoke about his experiences
as a cancer victim who acquired the
HIV virus through a blood transfu
sion — and the four and six-year-old
children from Dean Pizzo's presenta
tion who are alive in their 20s thanks
to pediatric AIDS research. We real
ized that our pain would end after a
day or two, but the daily suffering of
children all around the world infected
with HIV /AIDS will last until we
find a cure.
That's why we danced. This week
end, we committed ourselves to the
cause for good. In the words of my RA,
Sumeet Ajmani, "Dance Marathon
was the most exhilarating, motivating
experience of my entire life."
We quickly overcame the mental
and physical exhaustion. All that's
left are the amazing memories — the
11 student groups who performed,
the Soul Line Dancers, the guest ap
pearance from Chris Ayer, the Toga
Party, the dance contest, the four
hour rave, the inspirational speakers
— and the accomplishment. And
none of us will ever be the same.
