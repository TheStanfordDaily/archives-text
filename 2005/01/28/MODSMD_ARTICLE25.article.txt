## Card fix first-half slip-ups in Seattle victory 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Good teams are often measured by how
they react to adversity. No. 4 Stanford over
came a rough first half and a feisty Washing
ton team en route to an 82-60 victory in Scat
tie. Wash. Thursday night.
In Stanford's first meeting with the
Huskies at Maples Pavilion in early January,
the Cardinal (18-2, 9-1 Pacific-1 () Confer
ence) dominated the game from the inside
all night long. Junior Brooke Smith and
sophomore Kristen Newlin had their way in
the paint against Washington, as each play
er notched a double-double.
In last night's rematch, the Huskies ap
peared to have learned their lesson.
Washington diligently denied entry pass
es to both Smith and Newlin as the Cardinal
tried unsuccessfully to get their triangle of
fense on track. Husky defenders alternated

fronting the post and playing behind Smith
and Newlin, visibly confusing Stanford's tal
ented guard corps.
Despite shooting 50 percent from the
field before halftime, Stanford killed itself
with ill-advised passes. Aggressive play
from Washington on the defensive end of
the court led to 12 first-half turnovers for the
Cardinal and kept the Huskies in the game
while shooting less than 38 percent from the
floor.
"We turned the ball over too much in the
first half to give ourselves a good chance,"
head coach Tara VanDerveer said. "We
didn't keep them off the [offensive boards]
as well as we should have."
VanDerveer, meanwhile, was forced to
rifle through her bench as the foul bug hit
Stanford hard in the early minutes.
For the third straight game, freshman
guard Candice Wiggins picked up two fouls
in the first half, forcing her to the bench and

limiting her to just seven minutes in the first
stanza.
"I think sometimes she really wants to
contribute a lot," VanDerveer said. "I
thought she was pressing a little bit, honest
ly."
Even more distressing for the Cardinal,
however, were the troubles of Smith and
Newlin, each of whom had collected two
fouls before the intermission.
As a result, Stanford's role players, in
cluding Eziamaka Okafor and Azella Perry
man, were called upon to bridge the gap in
side. Despite performing admirably in relief,
the Cardinal's subs were unable to provide
the offense with the same opportunities and
balance it has possessed in recent weeks.
Despite struggling, the Cardinal took a
36-31 lead into halftime on the strength of
fine play from senior Kelley Suminski and
fifth-year Susan King Borchardt, who
played 20 and 18 minutes in the first half, re

spectively. Suminski hit a trio of three-point
shots, while Borchardt played tight defense
and settled Stanford's non-regulars at the
offensive end.
After halftime, the Huskies must have
been having flashbacks to their earlier loss.
Playing with three fouls early in the half.
Smith began once again to carve up the
Washington interior. She finished the night
with a game-high 20 points and added seven
rebounds.
The tough defense that had earlier de
nied Smith the ball became too tough in the
second, drawing referee whistles and forcing
Washington standout Jill Bell into an early
exit with 5:36 remaining. Despite her pre
mature departure. Bellied her team with 14
points in the game.
Ultimately, however, the Cardinal's
depth was just too much for the Huskies to

handle. The three-headed monster
of Newlin, Smith and senior T'Nae
Thiel dominated the boards, ex
tending Stanford's offensive pos
sessions and creating fast-break
opportunities. They helped secure
a 40-29 rebounding edge.
After guarding the ball jealous
ly earlier in the game, Washington
began to panic against the Cardi
nal's persistent pressure defense,
turning the ball over 10 times in the
second half and 17 on the night.
Wiggins came alive as well, con
tributing 12 points and three re
bounds while playing in foul trou
ble the entire night.
Play was physical all game long,

and the Cardinal's size inside ap
peared to wear down the Washing
tun defense over the course of the
night. Stanford's ability to control
the glass at both ends of the floor
prevented the Huskies from run
ning their normal fast-paced at
tack.
"We had a chance to play Bay
lor. Minnesota, Notre Dame and a
lot of people," Washington head
coach Daugherty said. "Stanford is
by far a better team than any of
those above mentioned."
The praise and the victory were
all dulled, however.
Okafor left the game halfway
through the second half with what

she believed was an Achilles ten
don injury in her right ankle. In her
third year on the Farm, Okafor has
missed nearly all of her first two
years due to injury.
Her freshman season was lost to
a tear in the ACL of her right knee,
and she was once again sidelined
her sophomore year with a tear in
her left Achilles.
"I thought she played really
well," VanDerveer said. "This is
the most she's played in a big game
on the road, and when she went
out, that just really affected every
one. It's really, really tough."
She will fly back to Stanford to
be reevaluated today.

the glass at both ends of the floor
prevented the Huskies from run
ning their normal fast-paced at
tack.
"We had a chance to play Bay
lor. Minnesota, Notre Dame and a
lot of people," Washington head
coach Daugherty said. "Stanford is
by far a better team than any of
those above mentioned."
The praise and the victory were
all dulled, however.
Okafor left the game halfway
through the second half with what

she believed was an Achilles ten
don injury in her right ankle. In her
third year on the Farm, Okafor has
missed nearly all of her first two
years due to injury.
Her freshman season was lost to
a tear in the ACL of her right knee,
and she was once again sidelined
her sophomore year with a tear in
her left Achilles.
"I thought she played really
well," VanDerveer said. "This is
the most she's played in a big game
on the road, and when she went
out, that just really affected every
one. It's really, really tough."
She will fly back to Stanford to
be reevaluated today.
Good teams are often measured by how
they react to adversity. No. 4 Stanford over
came a rough first half and a feisty Washing
ton team en route to an 82-60 victory in Scat
tie. Wash. Thursday night.
In Stanford's first meeting with the
Huskies at Maples Pavilion in early January,
the Cardinal (18-2, 9-1 Pacific-1 () Confer
ence) dominated the game from the inside
all night long. Junior Brooke Smith and
sophomore Kristen Newlin had their way in
the paint against Washington, as each play
er notched a double-double.
In last night's rematch, the Huskies ap
peared to have learned their lesson.
Washington diligently denied entry pass
es to both Smith and Newlin as the Cardinal
tried unsuccessfully to get their triangle of
fense on track. Husky defenders alternated

fronting the post and playing behind Smith
and Newlin, visibly confusing Stanford's tal
ented guard corps.
Despite shooting 50 percent from the
field before halftime, Stanford killed itself
with ill-advised passes. Aggressive play
from Washington on the defensive end of
the court led to 12 first-half turnovers for the
Cardinal and kept the Huskies in the game
while shooting less than 38 percent from the
floor.
"We turned the ball over too much in the
first half to give ourselves a good chance,"
head coach Tara VanDerveer said. "We
didn't keep them off the [offensive boards]
as well as we should have."
VanDerveer, meanwhile, was forced to
rifle through her bench as the foul bug hit
Stanford hard in the early minutes.
For the third straight game, freshman
guard Candice Wiggins picked up two fouls
in the first half, forcing her to the bench and

limiting her to just seven minutes in the first
stanza.
"I think sometimes she really wants to
contribute a lot," VanDerveer said. "I
thought she was pressing a little bit, honest
ly."
Even more distressing for the Cardinal,
however, were the troubles of Smith and
Newlin, each of whom had collected two
fouls before the intermission.
As a result, Stanford's role players, in
cluding Eziamaka Okafor and Azella Perry
man, were called upon to bridge the gap in
side. Despite performing admirably in relief,
the Cardinal's subs were unable to provide
the offense with the same opportunities and
balance it has possessed in recent weeks.
Despite struggling, the Cardinal took a
36-31 lead into halftime on the strength of
fine play from senior Kelley Suminski and
fifth-year Susan King Borchardt, who
played 20 and 18 minutes in the first half, re

spectively. Suminski hit a trio of three-point
shots, while Borchardt played tight defense
and settled Stanford's non-regulars at the
offensive end.
After halftime, the Huskies must have
been having flashbacks to their earlier loss.
Playing with three fouls early in the half.
Smith began once again to carve up the
Washington interior. She finished the night
with a game-high 20 points and added seven
rebounds.
The tough defense that had earlier de
nied Smith the ball became too tough in the
second, drawing referee whistles and forcing
Washington standout Jill Bell into an early
exit with 5:36 remaining. Despite her pre
mature departure. Bellied her team with 14
points in the game.
Ultimately, however, the Cardinal's
depth was just too much for the Huskies to
