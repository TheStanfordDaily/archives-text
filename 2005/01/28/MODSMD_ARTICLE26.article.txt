1 woke up this weekend, turned on the TV,
and within 15 seconds of waking, heard the
scariest phrase in the history of the English
language.
"Hi, this is Ashlee Simpson, and you're
watching the Ashlee Simpson Marathon on
MTV!"

I swear to God, that's
what that talentless baboon

thousands of plastic ticks fill the room.
Steve Myrick. ladies and gentlemen, is ded

big, he needs your help.
His craft? His passion? His sport?
Minesweeper.
Why minesweeper? Because he needs a
reason to tune me out in conversation. Sad.
For those who don't know of the popular
game that most of us outgrew once we found
out that the TV was on, minesweeper is a
