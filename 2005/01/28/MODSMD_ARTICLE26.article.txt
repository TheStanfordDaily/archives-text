# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## Pro-lifers, bad marathons and a sad, sad game 
### 
1 woke up this weekend, turned on the TV,
and within 15 seconds of waking, heard the
scariest phrase in the history of the English
language.
"Hi, this is Ashlee Simpson, and you're
watching the Ashlee Simpson Marathon on
MTV!"

I swear to God, that's
what that talentless baboon
yelped. How dare she
prance around with no voice
and no intelligence? And
(how do I say this politely?)
she's ugly. At least her sister
has the decency to tell us sto
ries of taping her breasts
down during her formative
years.
Hold on. The stares of

the pro-life White Plaza people are burning a
hole in my prostate.
By the way, did anyone else find it funny
that the pro-life people tried to claim that
their demonstration (for those that missed it,
they set up a mini-graveyard with white cross
es representing some number of aborted fe
tuses since Roe v. Wade) wasn't Christian?
Please. And then that in the same spot, those
lovable Larkin scamps sold their semi-nude
calendar two days later! Oh sexual politics,
what can't you infiltrate?
But anyway, it is these fantastic TV mo
ments that I truly enjoy — Ashlee Simpson
howling like a baboon, the Taco Bell "I'm a Pi
rate" ad and most of Arrested Development.
But he's not listening to me. My roommate,
Steve, is off in his own world of bombs, flags
and time. All I hear back is clicking. Incessant
clicking. Just tap-tap-tap, as hundreds upon
thousands of plastic ticks fill the room.
Steve Myrick. ladies and gentlemen, is ded
icated to his craft, and if he wants to make it
big, he needs your help.
His craft? His passion? His sport?
Minesweeper.
Why minesweeper? Because he needs a
reason to tune me out in conversation. Sad.
For those who don't know of the popular
game that most of us outgrew once we found
out that the TV was on, minesweeper is a

be a Minesweeper God

speed-based game where clues help
the user clear a minefield. Click on a
square, and you will either hit a
bomb, or show a number that says
how many bombs are touching the
square. "Touching the square" being
the first use of this phrase not in ref
erence to my romantic past.
I didn't realize the extent of his
passion until this winter break, when
this instant messenger conversation
shed some light on his addiction.
Steveheartsßlink 182squarepants:
Dude, you have no idea. 1 am so
good at minesweeper. I must be the
greatest player ever. I spend so much
time at this, I seriously must have the
world record by now.
Spencerisnarcissisticbecausehe'sin
secure: Don't they have websites for
this sort of thing? Google the world
record, I'm sure you don't have it.
Steveheartsßlink 182squarepants:
No, I'm sure I do. I'm checking it.

hold on.

There are some 112 g liars in this
world, dude.
And while the aforementioned
IM names are a fabrication, the
world records seemed to be accu
rate. Steve, who assumed that his 109
seconds would stand the test of time,
was shamed when it was clear that he
was nowhere close: 43 seconds
seemed to be the time to beat.
"It's tough, very tough," Myrick
said. "To tell the truth, my mouse is
a hindrance. It gets stuck, and be
cause we're dealing with very small
squares, any miscue can be disas
trous."
Excuses are the crutches of the
weak, Steven. But it is true: his com
puter, which crashes quite frequent
ly, like when he opens Microsoft
Word, or types the "H" key. does

weigh him down. And considering
that he plays this stupid, stupid game
for four hours a day (Seriously, four
hours. At least.), he knows his game
better than anyone.
"I'm really fighting to get under
the century mark," Myrick contin
ued. "I've hit 109 once, 115 a couple
times. But I feel like if 1 work at it. I
can get there. It's just a matter of
time."
Really? I thought it was a matter
of touchdowns! You see, this is why
he's the minesweeper God, and I'm
just a lowly sports columnist.
For you see friends, sports come
in all shapes and sizes. Even the most
basic, the silliest and the least excit
ing can make a God out of you too.
Just look at Badminton. Jk. Omg.
Rotfl. Haha.

Spencer Porter, a senior, is running
out of friends to talk about in his col
umn. E-mail him at porters(<Pstan
ford.edu to become his new buddy.
