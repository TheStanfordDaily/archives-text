# Final seconds' free throws save win
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For nearly 30 minutes last night, Ore
gon State and Stanford played like two
teams headed in opposite directions.
Though both teams ultimately main
tained their course, it was less clear by
the end of the night exactly which team
was on the way up.
After letting an 18-point second half
lead slip away, the Cardinal eked out a
69-65 victory over the Beavers before
5,749 at Maples Pavilion. Stanford (11-
7, 5-3 Pacific-10 Conference) won its
fifth straight game since opening confer
ence play 0-3, while Oregon State (11-8,
3-5) has lost five of six.
Junior point guard Chris Hernandez,
who finished with a game-high 23 points,
hit six free throws in the final minute to
seal the win for Stanford, which won de
spite shooting just 18-for-31 from the
charity stripe and being outrebounded
for the fifth consecutive game.
"We beat a pretty good team," head
coach Trent Johnson said. "1 thought we
played the first 10-15 minutes as well as
we have all year ... We knew they were
going to make a run."
When Hernandez drained a three
pointer from the right wing to give Stan
ford a 15-4 lead less then four minutes
into the game, everyone in the Cardinal
starting lineup was in the scoring col
umn and the Beavers appeared headed
fora particularly brutal 12th straight
loss at Maples.
But after junior forward Matt
Haryasz hit a jumper to give Stanford its
largest lead of the game with 13:54 to
play, Oregon State, which had been held
to two second-half points at that point,
began chipping away.
A 10-1 run capped by a forward Kyle
Jeffers' layup cut the Stanford lead to
nine with 11:01 to play. With a chance to
cut the lead to four less than three min
utes later, senior forward and leading
scorer David Lucas picked up his fifth
personal foul on the offensive end, end
ing his strong night (17 points, nine re
bounds) prematurely. Oregon State's
bench, incredulous at the call, was whis
tled fora technical foul.
The momentum never shifted, how
ever, as a pair of free throws by guard
Jason Fontenet, who finished with eight
points and five assists, capped an 8-0 run
to tie the score 54-54 with 5:24 to play.
Oregon State took its first lead of the
night two minutes later, when junior

forward Nick DeWitz, who scored 13 of
his team-high 19 points in the second
half, knocked down two free throws.
"It's all a matter of getting in a
groove," senior center Rob Little said.
"We were coasting the whole game and
couldn't really separate."
Little, who scored all 10 of his points
in the first half, never got in a groove
from the charity stripe, missing all eight
of his attempts.
"I thought we didn't do a good job re
bounding in the second half and we
didn't hit free throws," said Haryasz,
who finished with 13 points, 11 re
bounds and two blocks, but was just 1-
for-3 from the line. "We let them back in
the game ... But give them credit for
staying strong and fighting back."
Hernandez took control of the game
late, hitting a mid-range jumper at the
3:11 mark to regain the lead, and drain
ing two free throws to give the Cardinal
the lead for good, 65-63 with 20 seconds
to play. The Beavers had a chance to tie
or take the lead back on their next pos
session, but Fontenet slipped and lost
the handle on a drive and Hernandez
came away with the steal.
"Cruise is not something that's going
to happen on our basketball team,"
Johnson said. "It's just going to get
tougher the rest of the year."
Stanford did cruise for most of the
first half, though. Junior Dan Grunfeld,
Haryasz and Hernandez had eight first
half points apiece as Stanford led by as
many as 15 in the first half en route to a
38-28 halftime lead. The Cardinal shot 53
percent from the field in the first 20 min
utes but only 35 percent after the break.
While Oregon State held the Cardi
nal scoreless for the first four minutes of
the second half, the Beavers managed
just one basket during that span. Grun
feld, who finished with 15 points, five re
bounds and six assists, ended the
drought with a layup inside to spark an
8-0 Cardinal run. Haryasz converted a
short jumper inside and senior Nick
Robinson, who was playing the four
with Little taking a breather, took his
man off the dribble for an easy layup.
Robinson scored eight points and
grabbed nine rebounds.
In a game that featured an abnor
mally large number of Oregon State air
balls— most in the first half—the low
point for the Beavers came when re
serve forward Jim Hanchett was called
fora technical foul for hanging on the
rim after a failed dunk attempt.
