# Men falter again against No. 8 Northridge
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
CSU-Northridge passed the Stan
ford men's volleyball team in the
USA Today / AVCA poll this week,
pushing the Cardinal down to No. 9.
Northridge then came to Burn
ham Pavilion yesterday evening to
prove itself worthy of that No. 8 spot,
defeating the Cardinal 3-1.
It was a repeat of Stanford's first
meeting with the Matadors this sea
son.
At the UC-Santa Barbara tourna
ment, Stanford only won the second
game in their match against
Northridge— precisely what hap
pened this time around.
The Cardinal has yet to win any
match in which they have lost a
game.
In the first game last night, Stan
ford (3-5, 2-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) stumbled early
and could not seem to regain the lost
momentum, as the team fell 25-30.
The Cardinal was still missing

sophomore Josh Schwarzapel and ju
niors Nick Manov and Ben Reddy,
all out with injuries.
In the meantime, freshman Matt
Ceran has taken a semi-permanent
spot as a starter.
"Reddy is our biggest handicap,"
Ceran said. "It's been hard fora lot
of people to fill in, playing positions
we don't normally play. I'm in the
opposite position, and I'm an outside
hitter normally."
The improvised lineup saw mixed
results last week, as Stanford fell 0-3
to Long Beach State, then shut out
UC-San Diego 3-0.
Yesterday evening, Northridge
(4-5, 2-4 MPSF) dominated the first
game with strong kills, taking advan
tage of open spots on the Cardinal's
side of the court.
A strong block at the net also
stuffed many Stanford attempts to
score.
"We were way behind, and we
were very bad in the beginning of
that game," Shaw said. "We actually
fought back and made a game out of

it.
"We felt that we had momen
tum going back into it, considering
how we started," Shaw added.
On the Cardinal side, the block
was not working so well, with
many hits bouncing off to give
Northridge the point.
By the end of the match,
Northridge had 21.5 team blocks
to Stanford's 8.5.
"Awe and frustration are the
two best words to describe our re
action," Ceran said. "Last time, we
played competitively against
them, but this time we didn't."
In the second game of the
match. Stanford stayed with the
Matadors, never giving them a
lead of more than three points and
prompting Northridge to call a
timeout at 10-10.
Even though it was a close
game from the start. Northridge
managed to stay ahead of the Car
dinal until junior Chris Ahlfeldt
tied it up at 18-18.
The Matadors, facing a loss of
momentum, took another time
out.
Stanford was able to capitalize
on the opportunity to pull ahead,
though the Matadors put up a

strong fight. With a block from
Ceran, the Cardinal won game two
30-27 and brought the match to 1-
1.
The third game started out with
several long points, as both teams
seemed to shift into high gear.
"Intense play like that fires you
up," Ceran said. "It gets really
emotional. You have to stay at
that level, or you're going to be
outplayed."
And that is exactly what hap
pened. as the Cardinal lost more of
those points than they won.
The game that had been close
enough at the start for Stanford's
outlook to look hopeful, slid to 11 -
20 in favor of the Matadors.
"Getting behind didn't help."
Shaw said. "You want to win those
points, obviously. But it wasn't
about any specific plays; we just
didn't play well enough.
"Our ball handling wasn't good
enough," he continued. "We
didn't put our hitters in good posi
tions to hit. As a result.
|Northridge] blocked a lot of
balls."
Stanford continued to struggle,
scoring only five more points and
bunding Northridge the victory.

16-30.
Instead of falling apart in the
fourth game, as they did at home
against Pepperdine earlier this
season, the Cardinal put in a de
cent effort.
Despite falling behind early,
Stanford held on to tie the Mata
dors 15-15.
It was a close game to the finish,
but the Stanford effort ultimately
wasn't enough.
Northridge sealed the match
with a 26-30 win.
"Tonight we just gave
Northridge confidence and played
right into their hands," Shaw said.
"We're doing the best we can; we
just didn't do a very good job of it
tonight. We just didn't play well."
The Cardinal's next match will
be Saturday against No. 7 UC-
Santa Barbara.
The Gauchos are 3-4 overall
but 3-1 MPSF, tied for third in the
conference.
"Santa Barbara has been play
ing better lately than Northridge."
Shaw said. "At least we have a day
to regroup and get a little practice
in, which is unusual. That certainly
helped us last week in San Diego."

The game that had been close
enough at the start for Stanford's
outlook to look hopeful, slid to 11 -
20 in favor of the Matadors.
"Getting behind didn't help."
Shaw said. "You want to win those
points, obviously. But it wasn't
about any specific plays; we just
didn't play well enough.
"Our ball handling wasn't good
enough," he continued. "We
didn't put our hitters in good posi
tions to hit. As a result.
|Northridge] blocked a lot of
balls."
Stanford continued to struggle,
scoring only five more points and
bunding Northridge the victory.

16-30.
Instead of falling apart in the
fourth game, as they did at home
against Pepperdine earlier this
season, the Cardinal put in a de
cent effort.
Despite falling behind early,
Stanford held on to tie the Mata
dors 15-15.
It was a close game to the finish,
but the Stanford effort ultimately
wasn't enough.
Northridge sealed the match
with a 26-30 win.
"Tonight we just gave
Northridge confidence and played
right into their hands," Shaw said.
"We're doing the best we can; we
just didn't do a very good job of it
tonight. We just didn't play well."
The Cardinal's next match will
be Saturday against No. 7 UC-
Santa Barbara.
The Gauchos are 3-4 overall
but 3-1 MPSF, tied for third in the
conference.
"Santa Barbara has been play
ing better lately than Northridge."
Shaw said. "At least we have a day
to regroup and get a little practice
in, which is unusual. That certainly
helped us last week in San Diego."
CSU-Northridge passed the Stan
ford men's volleyball team in the
USA Today / AVCA poll this week,
pushing the Cardinal down to No. 9.
Northridge then came to Burn
ham Pavilion yesterday evening to
prove itself worthy of that No. 8 spot,
defeating the Cardinal 3-1.
It was a repeat of Stanford's first
meeting with the Matadors this sea
son.
At the UC-Santa Barbara tourna
ment, Stanford only won the second
game in their match against
Northridge— precisely what hap
pened this time around.
The Cardinal has yet to win any
match in which they have lost a
game.
In the first game last night, Stan
ford (3-5, 2-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) stumbled early
and could not seem to regain the lost
momentum, as the team fell 25-30.
The Cardinal was still missing

sophomore Josh Schwarzapel and ju
niors Nick Manov and Ben Reddy,
all out with injuries.
In the meantime, freshman Matt
Ceran has taken a semi-permanent
spot as a starter.
"Reddy is our biggest handicap,"
Ceran said. "It's been hard fora lot
of people to fill in, playing positions
we don't normally play. I'm in the
opposite position, and I'm an outside
hitter normally."
The improvised lineup saw mixed
results last week, as Stanford fell 0-3
to Long Beach State, then shut out
UC-San Diego 3-0.
Yesterday evening, Northridge
(4-5, 2-4 MPSF) dominated the first
game with strong kills, taking advan
tage of open spots on the Cardinal's
side of the court.
A strong block at the net also
stuffed many Stanford attempts to
score.
"We were way behind, and we
were very bad in the beginning of
that game," Shaw said. "We actually

"We felt that we had momen
tum going back into it, considering
how we started," Shaw added.
On the Cardinal side, the block
was not working so well, with
many hits bouncing off to give
Northridge the point.
By the end of the match,
Northridge had 21.5 team blocks
to Stanford's 8.5.
"Awe and frustration are the
two best words to describe our re
action," Ceran said. "Last time, we
played competitively against
them, but this time we didn't."
In the second game of the
match. Stanford stayed with the
Matadors, never giving them a
lead of more than three points and
prompting Northridge to call a
timeout at 10-10.
Even though it was a close
game from the start. Northridge
managed to stay ahead of the Car
dinal until junior Chris Ahlfeldt
tied it up at 18-18.
The Matadors, facing a loss of
momentum, took another time
out.
Stanford was able to capitalize
on the opportunity to pull ahead,
though the Matadors put up a

strong fight. With a block from
Ceran, the Cardinal won game two
30-27 and brought the match to 1-
1.
The third game started out with
several long points, as both teams
seemed to shift into high gear.
"Intense play like that fires you
up," Ceran said. "It gets really
emotional. You have to stay at
that level, or you're going to be
outplayed."
And that is exactly what hap
pened. as the Cardinal lost more of
those points than they won.
