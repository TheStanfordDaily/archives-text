# Men falter again against No. 8 Northridge

### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
CSU-Northridge passed the Stan
ford men's volleyball team in the
USA Today / AVCA poll this week,
pushing the Cardinal down to No. 9.
Northridge then came to Burn
ham Pavilion yesterday evening to
prove itself worthy of that No. 8 spot,
defeating the Cardinal 3-1.
It was a repeat of Stanford's first
meeting with the Matadors this sea
son.
At the UC-Santa Barbara tourna
ment, Stanford only won the second
game in their match against
Northridgeâ€” precisely what hap
pened this time around.
The Cardinal has yet to win any
match in which they have lost a
game.
In the first game last night, Stan
ford (3-5, 2-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) stumbled early
and could not seem to regain the lost
momentum, as the team fell 25-30.
The Cardinal was still missing

sophomore Josh Schwarzapel and ju
niors Nick Manov and Ben Reddy,
all out with injuries.
In the meantime, freshman Matt
Ceran has taken a semi-permanent
spot as a starter.
"Reddy is our biggest handicap,"
Ceran said. "It's been hard fora lot
of people to fill in, playing positions
we don't normally play. I'm in the
opposite position, and I'm an outside
hitter normally."
The improvised lineup saw mixed
results last week, as Stanford fell 0-3
to Long Beach State, then shut out
UC-San Diego 3-0.
Yesterday evening, Northridge
(4-5, 2-4 MPSF) dominated the first
game with strong kills, taking advan
tage of open spots on the Cardinal's
side of the court.
A strong block at the net also
stuffed many Stanford attempts to
score.
"We were way behind, and we
were very bad in the beginning of
that game," Shaw said. "We actually
fought back and made a game out of
