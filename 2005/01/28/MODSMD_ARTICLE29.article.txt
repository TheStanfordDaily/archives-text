# Cardinal baseball ready to put skills to the test in home opener
## Marquess not expecting any 'cupcakes' to fall into his team's hands 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Year-old stats, fall workouts and daily
practices only mean so much in the game of
baseball. To see what a team can really ac
complish, there's nothing to do but wait for
game time.
Tonight, in Stanford's home opener
against Fresno State, each member of the No.
6 Cardinal baseball squad gets his first shot at
proving that regardless of what the past has
shown, he's ready to make history this season.
"I just want to see where we are," head
coach Mark Marquess said. "Some guys are
great practice players, and when the lights go
on they just don't perform as well. Other guys
don't practice as well, but when the game's on
the line, they play differently."
According to Marquess, the reactions of
his pitchers to a game situation and the per
formance of his freshmen are most crucial to

determine.
The Bulldogs arrive at the Farm this week
end with similar questions to answer. Like the
Cardinal, Fresno State returns most of its
pitching staff, but only some of the bats that
built up the Bulldogs' .321 team batting aver
age last season.
Both squads have already named starters
for the weekend's series: The Cardinal will,
not surprisingly, start ace lefty Mark Ro
manczuk on Friday, followed by junior
righthander Jeff Gilniore on Saturday.
Sophomore righty Cireg Reynolds will be the
first Stanford pitcher to try on the role of the
third starter this season.
Fresno State will match junior college
transfer Ryan Penn up against Romanczuk in
their season opener, then follow up with the
rotation's lone lefty. Brandon Miller, on Sat
urday. Junior Matt Garza will face off with
Reynolds in the series finale.
The Bulldogs pulled out a 3-1 win over the
Cardinal in the teams' first meeting last year,
but Stanford's signature power at the plate
picked up in the next two matchups and pro
duced two victories, 13-4 and 10-3.
