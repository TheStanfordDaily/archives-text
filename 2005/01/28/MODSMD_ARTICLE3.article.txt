# Students hit all the right notes in ASSU-sponsored 'Stanford Idol' singing contest

Simon, Randy and Paula? No. Try Ed, Chris
and Chioke. These three will judge the first-ever
Stanford Idol, a talent show modeled after the
popular television show "American Idol." More
than 50 students came to the first round of audi
tions this week. But by March, there will only be
one Stanford Idol.
Approximately 30 semifinalists will be chosen
by Monday and will perform in sets of 10 over the
next three weeks. Each week's performance will
be aired on SCBN, and students will be able to
vote online to determine their favorite vocalists.
The final will be held in March, when the Stanford
Idol will be chosen from six finalists and one wild
card contestant.
What makes this different from any other tal
ent show? According to sophomore Elizabeth
Heng, ASSU executive cabinet student life co
chair and producer of Stanford Idol, all proceeds
from the contest will be donated to charity. Orga
nizers are looking for outside sponsors to donate
money in return for free advertising.
The winner of Stanford Idol will receive studio
time with student-founded Inphanyte Records
and decide which philanthropic organization will

get the donated money.
Heng, who is also the Absolute Fun perform
ing arts / comedy chair, said that the talent show is
a good way to bring together different groups on
campus.
"Various members of the Stanford community
have pointed out that the groups on campus don't
hold many collaborated events," she said. "Since
each group already has an abundant amount to do
for their own events, there is often not enough
time to plan events with other groups."
The event's sponsors include the ASSU Un
dergraduate Senate, FUCKS and Stanford Din
ing.
The first round of Stanford Idol consists of four
separate auditions. The judges for Stanford Idol
are ASSU President Chioke Borgelt-Mose, a ju
nior, senior Chris Babson and co-terminal student
Ed Iskandar. After each performance, the judges
offer critiques.
Iskandar, who has directed a number of shows
while at Stanford, became involved with the show
after an invitation from Babson, who is a member
of the fraternity Delta Tau Delta, one of the
groups sponsoring the contest.
"Chris and 1 had worked on several shows to
gether in the past," Iskandar said. "This show
proves that there's a real interest in trying to ex

press yourself in the performing arts, even though
the performing arts don't get enough attention,
space or support. Some people think they have to
join an a cappella group or there's no other op-
