This issue marks the departure of longtime
editor-matriarch Tarn Vo, who has guided
this sub-publication for just about a full year.
She asked us fora tasteful celebratory arti
cle, honoring her time in the cancerous coal
mine that is the Intermission bureaucracy
with a subdued, unpretentious farewell. To
hell with that. Instead, in the age-old tradition
of going out with a nuclear kaBOOM, we end
this volume with a series of off-the-cuff, ire
inducing, impossibly controversial opinions,
guaranteed to make even the most liberal
hipster flower-child commie incredibly
angry. ,
(If you are at all offended by any part of this ar
ticle, write to us. We will pleasure ourselves to
your hateful words and poor penmanship.)

That guy in the CoHo reading Kierkegaard

ask? A terrorist.

Editor's Note: Shortly after their submis
sion of this piece, Comrades Franich and
Shah mysteriously disappeared from com
mune 680. Despite allegations of insubordi
nation and blatant disregard for social
norms, we have no leads on their where
abouts. Please facebook them and leave
angry messages in the hopes that contro
versy will bring about their safe return.

With only a precious few hours left in my tenure as Party Chair of the People's Commumission,
I feel the cold of a long winter to come — a sparse existence in which there are no People's G5s
to accomplish layout on, no People's golfclubs to swing aimlessly while marching about the office
— a cold winter that is knocking ... no, pounding at the door. Fortunately, the People's Party was

foresightful enough to install iron-reinforced doors so that winter
can continue to knock all it likes until the thaw of spring, but the
Party's headquarters will remain unbreached.
But I digress. Which is unforgivable, of course, because to di
gress is to isolate oneself from the aims of the State, and to do so

is to undermine the very people of the State itself, and to do so is to undermine oneself. Having
been so undermined, and only furthering my undermination through this explanatory side note of
mine, I return to my larger point.
In the course of human events, there are only so many different stages at which critical turning
points will reveal themselves — turning points at which the relation of man to the modes of pro
duction will once again be reformed and reestablished. Only through the pooling of capital within
the state can the capital be pooled within the people. But while the capitalist scourge might choose
to remain ignorant of this inevitable truth, the People's Commumission sees beyond contemporary
circumstance to envision a bold, triumphant union — nay, a most complete marriage — of all the
oppressed and the oppressors, of the capitalists and those who labor for them. To be equal through
the eradication of equity. To be individual through conformity to the community.
I would say that my fellow comrades Tam and Victor have served me well, but this would be in
accurate. Rather, they have served the People's Commumission well, and in this they have served
us all well. Because one must remember, only through the people can one ever become himself.

Long time Commumission Party leader Tam V® is finally leaving the hallowed halls of The
Daily's smarmiest section. Editor for an unprecedented — and surely never to be repeated —
two volumes, Tam has put her sweat blood and tears into The People's Intermission. Sadly, hers
hasn't been the only blood used to paint these pages.
As a pitiable freshman, I came looking for solace and warmth when I first entered the doors of
The Daily. What I found were horrors beyond my imagining. Drunken baccanals, swinging golfclubs
and decapited bears of the gummi persuasion hanging from the ceiling.
Our leader, Tam Vo, was the whipmaster of it all. Standing over my shoulder, shouting demands,
Tam would spend hours verbally abusing her downtrodden layout guy. She made me cry on at least
three separate occasions. After she would release me from my chains at three in the morning, I would
limp home, wincing at the scars left by the floggings.
Things progressed very painfully. First Bizarro Intermission came around with Tam shouting
orders that contradicted everything she had said the week before. By Intermission Apocalypse,
she had killed her co-editor, Tom Hanada, like a spider eats her young.
When all is said and done, Tam kicked ass. My ass. And though she says she's leaving, the dark
powers that surround the cubicle of Commumission will draw her back in once more and I will be

glad to work with
her. At least that's
what I say when
she's around.

Commumission doesn't work because
people like to own things. — Frank Zappa
