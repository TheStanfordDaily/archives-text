## ALONE THE DARK Tara Reid's Favorite place to 'work' 
### COMRADE FARIS MOHIUDDIN COMMUMISSION PROPAGANDIST 
Apparently, this 90-minute train wreck
was loosely based on a popular video game.
Come on people, did we learn anything
from "Tomb Raider," "Resident Evil" or
"The Village"? Fine, "The Village" wasn't
based on a video game, but it blew just as
hard as the others. Empirically, video game
ancestry represents a one-way ticket to
Blockbuster in less than a month. I sincere
ly hope they spare us the trip to the store
and ship "Alone in the Dark" right to Cin
emaxs.
Christian Slater plays Edward Carnby, a
paranormal detective seeking to uncover
the mystery surrounding his past. And
somehow this relates to an ancient civiliza
tion that was wiped out by opening a door
to the dark nether world. But just what is
this dark world? We never get an explana
tion, but the movie's chock full of scaly
things that would really like to poke you to
death.
"Paranormal detective, what the hell?"
you may ask. Slater basically plays a Ghost
buster minus the uniform. He doesn't catch
any ghosts — he just follows and attempts
to kick them from time to time. If you
would like to know about more detectives,
they were handing out puka shells at their
table during the Liberal Arts Majors Ca
reer Fair.
" Alone in the Dark'"s plotline resembles

pieces from different jigsaw puzzles
mashed together to form something from a
cubist's bad dream. The characters' ulti

mate motivations are never de
veloped in any way. The patch
work plot is just an excuse to
make things go Kapow! and to
puree a few dozen people.
Tara Reid dawns smart-look
ing glasses and BOOM — she's a
brilliant anthropologist. She ef
fortlessly analyzes obscure and
ancient civilizations, yet she still
cannot pronounce "Newfound
land." Reid plays Slater's ex-girl
friend and serves no purpose
throughout the plot except for an
obligatory sex scene — but no
one's complaining about that
one.
The monsters themselves are

really just half-assed CGI Alien / Predator
knockoffs. These nefarious little nibblers

have a few arbitrary weaknesses: elements
76-79 and, oh yeah, SUNLIGHT. Not too
plausible, but that's hardly unexpected.

Stephen Dorff plays Slater's archrival at
a highly classified special agency also inves
tigating the paranormal phenomenon.
They're supposedly equipped with the lat
est technology, but their form-fitting armor
never actually prevents bodily damage.
This "world-class" special ops team looks
more like a GAP ad that went terribly
awry.
All throughout the movie, the plot is sub
verted in the interest of action. But nothing
in the movie is visually unique or moving in
any way. The slow-motion action se
quences and bullet trail shots are truly cut
ting edge — that is, if you take a time ma
chine back to 1999. Otherwise, "Alone in
the Dark" is devoid of any visual punch —
even fora video game incarnation.
At one point. Slater's character prophet
ically remarks, "I shouldn't be here." He's
right; Slater should be back in the mid
1990's when he still had a career: Tara
Reid should be in a movie where some
thing edible gets defiled: Steven Dorff
should be... well, taller. And I sure as
hell should have been back in Grove,

sleeping for another four hours.

To be perfectly honest. 1 could
swear I signed up to see "Hide &

Seek." Seriously, they seem
close enough: if you're alone in

the dark, you're probably hid

ing and, um. someone's
maybe seeking you out?

Okay, this is how I ratio
nalize my inattention to

detail. It's definitely
not a good habit, but
sitting through

Alone in the
Dark was simply
cruel and unusu
al punishment.


I long for the rise j
of your proletariat. J
