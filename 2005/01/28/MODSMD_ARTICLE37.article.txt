# Miss Reid sobers up for interrogation
## 
### COMRADE FARIS MOHIUDDIN COMMUMISSION INTERROGATOR 
I sat down with Tara Reid earlier this
week. By VI mean "20-something col
lege newspaper writers." By "sat down
with," I mean "slumped over my desk
with my cad phone's loudspeaker on."
With far too many interviewers and far
too little time, each college newspaper
was granted one question, and one
question alone. You'd think such con
straints would prompt a concerted effort
to maximize the quality of one's only
query. Well, instead we got priceless
gems along the lines of, 'You went to
school at the Professional Children's
School with Sarah Michelle GeHar, how
was that?" It only got worse from there,
once again demonstrating why some
people should just never open their
mouths.
INTERMISSION: So Tara, I hear you
began your career in horror movies,
right?
TARA REID: Yeah, my first movie was
"Return to Salem's Lot:" it was based on
a Stephen King book.

INT: Okay so in retro
spect, which do you find
more frightening: "Return
to Salem's Lot" or "Saved
By the Bell: The New
Class"?
TR: "Saved By the Bell:
The New Class," definitely.
Q: Tara, everyone wants
to know this. Can you ex
plain what happened at
Puff Daddy's party?
TR: Accidents happen all
the time. Next question.
ANGRY LIONS GATE
FILMS PUBLICITY

LADY: Everyone, Tara's here to publi
cize the movie, let's focus on that.
So apparently this genius thought he
was going to tap into a Kennedy-esque
conspiracy all in the name of titty pub
licity. Maybe he thought she'd finally
connect the CIA, the Mafia and Castro
colluding to slide her dress down. Fu
ture Woodward and Bernstein? I think
not.
Q: We hear you're going to work on a
comedy about a celebrity actress with a
reputation for being a party girl. Is this
rote your way of playing off your image?
TR: Exactfy. Tabloids make a huge deal
about me being this party girl. I work all

the time — for most of the week. I work
hard so I go to have fun and unwind.
Q: Wasitverycffferenttoplayaroteina
honor movie as opposed to a comedy?
TR: Yeah, its actually much harder to
act in a comedy. Timing is necessary to
play off certain scenes well. In an action
movie you just have to survive.
If we lived in a world where questions
were based on merit potential for
amusement and not equally distrib
uted, here are some that I had lined up
for Ms. Reid — along with what I imag
ine her answers might be.
[Editor's Note: Comrade Mohiuddin
did not actually have the chance to
pose the following questions to Ms.
Reid, nor did she reply to them in such
a manner.)
INT: How was the experience of being
in a movie filled with special effects
that didn't involve genitalia and edible
objects? Did you have to make any
adjustments?
TR: Your guess is as good as mine.

INT: "Alone in the
Dark" was loosely
based off of an Atari
videogame. Now
seriously, how
much would it take
for you star in a
screen Adaptation
of' Pong?" If it helps,
you can be an an
thropologist in this
movie, too.*
TR: [crickete chirping]
INT: Okay, here's a
hypothetical. You
and Stephen Dorff in
a battle to the death.
Be honest, how

many minutes before you'd kick his ass?
TR: [loud silence] (We predict two
minutes and eight seconds. They'll
tussle a bit before she busts out the
can o' whoop-ass... or her breasts.
Whichever's funnier.)
INT: So over your career, you've as
sumed multiple occupations. These in
clude the hot student, the hot gold dig
ger, the hot daughter, the hot drummer,
the hot DJ, to the hot newtywed...and
now the hot anthropologist. How has
this movie made you appreciate the ver
itable roller coaster ride that is being an
anthropologist?
TR: [attempts to spell "anthropologist"]


Tara Reid's favorite
breakfast lunch and
dinner food.
