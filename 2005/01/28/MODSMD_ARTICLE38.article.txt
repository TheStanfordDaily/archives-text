## It's French, it's choir boys: A priest smorgasbord 
### COMRADE RICARDO GILB COMMUMISSION SKEPTIC 
Before anything else, here's a little quiz. Which of the follow
ing lines comes from "Les Choristes," the new French movie by
Christophe Barratier, and which comes from Marx's "The Com
munist Manifesto"? Here goes: 1) "Man's consciousness changes
with every change in the conditions of his material existence" and
2) "A chicken lays on average K4 eggs per year, hut if she is well

fed, kept in a clean coop, she lays 150."
Don't worry, I wouldn't know the
answer either if I hadn't had the good
fortune to have seen "Les Choristes."
Amazingly, this movie's consisten
cy with the views of Karl Marx is only

Commumission is not love. Commumission is a ham
mer which we use to crush the enemy. — Moo Tse-Tung

the beginning of its charm. Before I saw the film, I was a skep
tic. I only knew that it was a story about an idealistic young
teacher who takes on a classroom of delinquents and saves
them with the magical power of choral music — "Sister Act"
meets "Stand and Deliver" meets "Mr. Holland's Opus."
(Whoopi Goldberg teaching calculus using music . . . maybe
that's not a bad idea after a11...) But Les Choristes is much bet
ter, less sentimental and, in the end. more inspirational than
anything 1 could've expected.
The story is more complex than in most "idealist rescues delin
quents" movies. Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot), a composer,

arrives to teach at a re
form school where dis
cipline is the top priori
ty. Clement must fight
against a principal who
feels the choir is silly,
forcing him to disobey
orders while trying to
teach the students to
follow them. He unites
the oppressed students
in a choir, finding an un
expected vocal talent in

the young Pierre Morhange (Jean-Baptiste Maugnier). Mathieu
tries to help Pierre, in large part out of affection for the boy's
mother, but also because own musical ambitions have come to so
little.

But beneath the surface, "Les Choristes" is about the impor
tance of the environment. In a clever move, this theme finds ex
pression in an arithmetic problem about an egg-laying chicken. It
may sound a bit contrived, but the message is delivered quite
skillfully. This is Barratier's debut as a director, writer and com
poser, and I take it as a promising sign that he shies away from
the heavy-handed. He never worries that viewers will miss the
point, so he rarely feels the need to zoom in and get the orches
tra going.
His subtlety demonstrates not only confidence in his own direc
tion, but also a commendable faith in the proletariat. And judging

from the movie's financial
and critical success, Bar
ratier's confidence was
more than justified. It also
doesn't hurt that "Les
Choristes" marks France's
33rd Oscar nomination for
best foreign film.
When all is said and
done, it's still impossible to
resist calling a successful
movie about a choir "har
monious." Forgive me the
metaphor, and 1 will for
give you for reading about
movies, when you ought to
out uniting the masses.
