### COMRADE NICOLE BECKLEY COMMUMISSION PROPAGANDA SPECIALIST 
For 52-year-old Dan Foreman
(Dennis Quaid), life is pretty good.
He's got the corner office, the nice
house, the beautiful wife .. . but of
course, all of that doesn't make for
very interesting cinema. So, before
Dan realizes it, his wife (the mother
of his two teenage daughters) gets
pregnant; his oldest daughter an
nounces her plans to transfer to a

much more expensive college; and
he gets replaced at work — by a 26-
year-old. Ouch. The lesson that
Communism can teach us is that
everyone is dispensable.
That 26-year-old is Carter Duryea
(Topher Grace), a young, inexperi
enced corporate hopeful brought in
to revamp the advertising depart
ment of "Sports America" maga
zine. Carter wastes no time in get
ting to work, laying people off and
drinking lots and lots of coffee.
Carter and Dan begin to build a
relationship, starting when Carter
invites himself to dinner at the
Foreman's house. Here he meets
Dan's 18-year-old daughter, Alex
(Scarlett Johannson), a college
freshman and tennis player. Carter
and Alex bond over foosball and
pizza, which then leads to coffee,

and more coffee, which then
leads to . . . sushi, of course.
But one can only date the
daughter of one's business as

sociate for so long before there is
bound to be trouble.
For "In Good Company," the
trouble is never major. Never com
pletely unmanageable. We see the
father/son dynamic brewing be
tween Carter and Dan as well as the
potential love blossoming between
Carter and Alex, and we know that
only one relationship will be able to
survive. We see Dan struggling with
his age and obligations, but we
never feel like he can't handle it.
The movie keeps us pretty safe —
wrapped up in a changing yet secure
world.
While the film is not entirely with
out its moments of cliche — the
obligatory bar scene (complete with
Aretha Franklin's "Chain of Fools"
playing in the background), the
mandatory company basketball

team and the quintessential
"goth chick" roommate at
NYU — the film is vibrant
enough to keep us entertained
and genuinely interested.
"In Good Company" works
because the actors make it
work. Grace transforms him
self into the super-hyper-yet
lonely Carter with great ease
and naturalness. Johansson is
both strong and vulnerable as
Alex, giving her character
depth and likeability. (Of
course the inevitability that
she will become involved with

Carter is only a matter of time. This
is Hollywood after all — dim the
lights and cue the Sade.) And let's
be honest, it's nice to see Dennis
Ouaid doing something, anything,
that isn't "Dragonhead."

In short, if you're looking fora
feel-good film (and I would go so far
as to say "the feel-good film of the
year" — since it's still January), "In
Good Company" is definitely worth
a look.
