# School of Education receives $700,000 donation
## Gift will create fellowship for doctoral candidate next year 
### ADAM WIDMAN 
The School of Education last month re
ceived $700,000 — one of the largest donations
in the school's history — to endow a financial
aid program for doctoral students. The H. An
drea Neves and Barton Evans Graduate Stu
dent Aid Fund, named after the alumni who do
nated the money, will be used to support a fel
lowship for at least one Ph.D. student each year.
"We are deeply grateful to the donors for
their generosity and the faith their gift shows in
our students and our ability to provide them
with rigorous training." said School of Educa
tion Dean Deborah Stipek.
The School of Education has 358 total stu
dents, including 200 doctoral candidates.
"Funds generated will provide various forms
of financial support for graduate students at the
Ph.D. level who have academic backgrounds in
the social sciences and research interests in so
cial justice issues such as minority rights and jus
tice for indigenous peoples," Stipek said.
Neves, who received a Ph.D from the School

of Education in 1984 and is currently a professor
of education at Sonoma State University, said
that she would like the donation to fund social
justice work.
"I have a strong international perspective
and interest in social justice," Neves said in a
Jan. 12 press release. "More specifically, my
teaching and research have been in ethnic mi
nority rights, social class, women's rights, and
race issues both internationally and within the
United States. I want to support students whose
research interests reflect my own."
Evans, who graduated as an undergraduate
in YEAR, has also supported education by
funding schools in Tanzania with Neves. He
said he feels that education deserves more sup
port from individual donors.
"After looking at the current state of educa
tion. it seems that engineering and the sciences
have generally been getting their share, while
education seems to be further down the list,"
Evans said in the same press release.
The School of Education plans to create the
fellowship as early as next fall.
