# CENSORED BY STATE
## POINT/ COUNTERPOINT Ultimately, the Soviet Union Collapsed Under the Crushing Weight of its Own Economic Inefficiencies 
### COMRADE HERBERT DINKELSPIEL COMRADE ZACH R. KELLEY 
Whatever you might have to say about
communism as an ethos, just look at the
facts: ultimately, the Soviet Union col
lapsed under the crushing weight of its
own economic inefficiencies.
I'm getting very tired of ail the specious
explanations that I hear. No, it wasn't the
burning desire of the Soviet people to
break free of the chains of oppression.
And no, it wasn't the pressure of the
American arms race.
I cannot stress this enough — these
are simple facts. I'm not making them up.
Here it is, pure and simple: the Soviet
economy suffered from a crippling ineffi
ciency that inevitably impaired the ability
of the state to maintain control over its
citizens. I don't know why people have
such a hard time understanding this.
I'll be the first to admit that the Soviet
command economy allowed Stalin to in
dustrialize Russia at an incredible pace.
And yes, the tanks he built were every bit
as valuable against the Nazis as our own.
But that didn't mean the Soviet economy
would continue to function effectively.
After the war, the Soviet manufactur
ing framework began a steady slide

into obsolescence and inefficiency.
And without the forces of supply

and demand to regulate the
marketplace, production
choices rarely made sense.
Resources were chronically
misallocated and consumer
goods were in perpetual short
supply.
When Gorbachev came to
power, he had no choice but
to reform the system. But
when he came on strong with
glasnost and perestroika, the
end was already near. Gor
bachev's reforms became a
destabilizing force in the re
gion, liberalization spiraled
out of control and just like that,
the Soviet Union collapsed.
But in case you were thinking
of blaming Gorbachev, real
ize this: the root cause of the
collapse lies firmly anchored
in the inefficiencies of the So
viet economy. It's true, just
accept it.

NERRRRRRRD!

My God, do you even listen to yourself?
You sir, are a nerd. In fact, you are such a nerd that I
don't even know where to begin. It's bad enough that you're
writing about the Soviet Union. But you're not even writing
about anything cool, you're writing about the boring-ass
ECONOMICS of Soviet Russia. That is just pathetic.
I cannot believe how often you use the word "inefficiency."

The word has TWELVE letters. That's almost EIGHTY letters, fj e "J ),re **
And let's look at some other words you use — "ethos," "ulti- f 0 " o*"oHcmtei- evil empire. Ironic, huh.
mately," "specious" — I can't even begin to explain how much of a nerd you are, and I've only gotten
to your second paragraph. On the moon, you would be spanked with moon rocks.
Let's take a look at your argument. You say, "the Soviet economy suffered from a crippling inefficiency
that inevitably impaired the ability of the state to maintain control over its citizens." I don't know why you
would even say that, because all you're doing is showing me how much of a nerd you are.
And then you go on: "After the war, the Soviet manufacturing framework began a steady slide into obsolescence
and inefficiency." Sweet Jesus, ifs like you just don't leam. You are so ridiculous that I think I could kill you.
As if that's not bad enough, you even go around making up words. "Glasnost and perestroika"? I've

never heard anything more ridiculous in my entire life. Hey look, I can make up

words too. Seprtlja, tont, njeri i ngathet! Ooh, look at me, I'm making
up words ... in case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic. And answer

me this: those big made-up words you keep using — is anyone

ever impressed? I think we both know the answer to that question.
Hmm ... come to think of it, your own family just might find you im
pressive, because they're probably all nerds just like yourself — ex
cept for your sister. Your sister is hot.
Now that I've proven conclusively that you are a nerd, I should proba
bly mention that you are no doubt unattractive as well. Your pimples defy

the clinically-proven powers of Pro-Activ acne solution and I'll bet that
your wire-frame glasses are taped together at the bridge. And where

did you even find a sweater like that? You offend me with your
appearance, with the words that come out of your mouth and
with every fiber of your being. I cannot believe that the laws of

this country permit you to exist.
So next time you feel like

making the world a more
four-eyed place, just keep

it to yourself. You
nerd.

And then you go on: "After the war, the Soviet manufacturing framework began a steady slide into obsolescence
and inefficiency." Sweet Jesus, ifs like you just don't leam. You are so ridiculous that I think I could kill you.
As if that's not bad enough, you even go around making up words. "Glasnost and perestroika"? I've

never heard anything more ridiculous in my entire life. Hey look, I can make up

words too. Seprtlja, tont, njeri i ngathet! Ooh, look at me, I'm making
up words ... in case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic. And answer

me this: those big made-up words you keep using — is anyone

ever impressed? I think we both know the answer to that question.
Hmm ... come to think of it, your own family just might find you im
pressive, because they're probably all nerds just like yourself — ex
cept for your sister. Your sister is hot.
Now that I've proven conclusively that you are a nerd, I should proba
bly mention that you are no doubt unattractive as well. Your pimples defy

the clinically-proven powers of Pro-Activ acne solution and I'll bet that
your wire-frame glasses are taped together at the bridge. And where

did you even find a sweater like that? You offend me with your
appearance, with the words that come out of your mouth and
with every fiber of your being. I cannot believe that the laws of

this country permit you to exist.
So next time you feel like

making the world a more
four-eyed place, just keep

it to yourself. You
nerd.


Whatever you might have to say about
communism as an ethos, just look at the
facts: ultimately, the Soviet Union col
lapsed under the crushing weight of its
own economic inefficiencies.
I'm getting very tired of ail the specious
explanations that I hear. No, it wasn't the
burning desire of the Soviet people to
break free of the chains of oppression.
And no, it wasn't the pressure of the
American arms race.
I cannot stress this enough — these
are simple facts. I'm not making them up.
Here it is, pure and simple: the Soviet
economy suffered from a crippling ineffi
ciency that inevitably impaired the ability
of the state to maintain control over its
citizens. I don't know why people have
such a hard time understanding this.
I'll be the first to admit that the Soviet
command economy allowed Stalin to in
dustrialize Russia at an incredible pace.
And yes, the tanks he built were every bit
as valuable against the Nazis as our own.
But that didn't mean the Soviet economy
would continue to function effectively.
After the war, the Soviet manufactur
ing framework began a steady slide

into obsolescence and inefficiency.
And without the forces of supply

and demand to regulate the
marketplace, production
choices rarely made sense.
Resources were chronically
misallocated and consumer
goods were in perpetual short
supply.
When Gorbachev came to
power, he had no choice but
to reform the system. But
when he came on strong with
glasnost and perestroika, the
end was already near. Gor
bachev's reforms became a
destabilizing force in the re
gion, liberalization spiraled
out of control and just like that,
the Soviet Union collapsed.
But in case you were thinking
of blaming Gorbachev, real
ize this: the root cause of the
collapse lies firmly anchored
in the inefficiencies of the So
viet economy. It's true, just
accept it.

phone company. ~ Lenny Bruce

NERRRRRRRD!

My God, do you even listen to yourself?
You sir, are a nerd. In fact, you are such a nerd that I
don't even know where to begin. It's bad enough that you're
writing about the Soviet Union. But you're not even writing
about anything cool, you're writing about the boring-ass
ECONOMICS of Soviet Russia. That is just pathetic.
I cannot believe how often you use the word "inefficiency."

The word has TWELVE letters. That's almost EIGHTY letters, fj e "J ),re **
And let's look at some other words you use — "ethos," "ulti- f 0 " o*"oHcmtei- evil empire. Ironic, huh.

to your second paragraph. On the moon, you would be spanked with moon rocks.
Let's take a look at your argument. You say, "the Soviet economy suffered from a crippling inefficiency
that inevitably impaired the ability of the state to maintain control over its citizens." I don't know why you
would even say that, because all you're doing is showing me how much of a nerd you are.
