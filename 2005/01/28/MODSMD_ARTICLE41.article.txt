### COMRADE DARREN FRANICH COMMUMISSION CHAIRMAN OF CALISTHENICS 
The new Maples Pavilion, ladies and
gents, the eighth wonder of the world!
Who wasn't skeptical about the multimil
lion dollar recreation of our much-loved
basketball arena? Granted, Classic
Maples had its problems (crammed seat
ing, labyrinthine stairway structure, lack
of a gigantic TV-Scorecard-MegaCube
hanging from the heavens) but converse
ly, it DID have ... well, change is hard on
anyone.
But surprise! Neo-Maples has every
thing the old Maples didn't and still
FEELS like the place where I grew up
watching players like Adam Keefe, Brevin
Knight and Casey Jacobsen, to say noth
ing of patriarch Mike Montgomery. At the
same time, there's so much pleasure to
be had from enjoying all the new bits: the
upper lights shutting off during gametime,
the refined stairway structure, that classy
inside-outside outer layer and the TV-
Cube.
Yet the metaphorical new-car smell
began fading at the first major home
game, when the nice men directing us to
the student seats explained we were
going to have to get very, very cozy. In a
structural mistake shocking in its idiot au
dacity, members of the Sixth Man Club
have been crammed onto relatively thin
bleacher-steps, two rows per level. In the
ory, this probably sounded like a grand
idea. I'm sure a heartless plutocrat in the
back office got paid a hefty Thanksgiving
bonus for coming up with this one. Good
for him.
Except that, like the Flat Earth and the
Piltdown Man, the theory doesn't hold.
Instead, in the midst of a massively huge
Neo-Geo remodel, the Sixth-Man sec
tion seems almost like an afterthought.
The*other sections have all been refitted
with cushions, space, aesthetically
pleasing design and improved visibility;
no doubt this makes the alumni (or, as
we at Commumission like to call them,
"the bourgeois pigs") quite happy.
Meanwhile, we students get a few stair
platforms masquerading as bleachers.
Luxuries like personal space, clear stair
ways for exiting, air that doesn't smell
like sweat and sitting down during half
time have all been lost in the corporate
shuffle.
