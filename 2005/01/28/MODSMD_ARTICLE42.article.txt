Anyone with even the most humdrum childhood will recall sit
ting down in front of the television on those beautiful Saturday
mornings and entering a land where miniature blue creatures
spend their (toys frolicking around mushroom houses while
doing their best to avoid always-dangerous cats. The many ad
ventures of the shirtless, white-hatted Smurfs entertained gen
erations of children and taught them many valuable lessons, But
were the Smurfs teaching children the nght lessons?
Tlieories as to the real purpose of the animated Smurfs have
ranged from innocent kiddie-fair to the devious and corrupt. But
the most convincing theory proposed by manyleadingscientists
is that the Smurfs are a dWId-oriented representation of a Marx
ist community. Irt other words, the Smurife are commies.t H

If we examine the evidenoe, this idea is quite well supported by the
metaphors and symbols embedded in every episode Starting from the top of
the Smurf hierarchy, Papa Smurf dearly represents Karl Maw. Not only does
he have a Marxist beard, but he is also the only Smurf to wear red, the color
most associated with communism.
Respected because of his age and wisdom, he resides over a self-sufficient
community, or commune, where everyone is treated as equals (despite the
obvious greater worth of Farmer and Handy Smurf over members like Lazy
Smurf) and no one owns their own land. Rather, the land is owned by the
Smurf community at large.
In their economically self-contained commune, Smurfs neferto themselves as
"smurf in much the same way as the title "comrade" is applied to citizens of a

communist state. When you
think about it, "farmer smurf is
actually pretty dose to "com
rade Lenin."
In addition to this verbal so
cial leveler, all Smurfs wear the
same outfit, rather reminiscent
of a classic Maoist uniform.
Furthermore, there is no "King
Smurf or "Priest Smurf," imply
ing a condemnation of social
hierarchy as well as organized
religion.
The antithesis of the Utopian
Smurf society is the series' vil
lain, Gargomel. An embodi

ment of the evils of capitalism, he is greedy and concerned only with his own
satisfaction, His quest to eat the Smurfs — hardly a good source of nutrition
— shows how capitalists find nothing as gratifying as annihilating a truly idyl
lic commune.
Finally there is Smurfette. One can only wonder what her role in this ho
mogenously male environment could be. Since she is set apart by her
gender and the idea that every Smurf is equal, it is safe to assume that
the Smurf motto "share and share alike" includes her.
Devious and dastardly, the messages subversively promoted by
the blue devils in white hats have quietly corrupted the very fabric of
our society. However, their evil pales in comparison to the darkness
known as the Snortcs.

Reading it now,
"The Communist Mani
festo", by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, seems prescient. It
predicted the rise of consumerism, federalism and intellectual
ism: aside from also forecasting a quick and permanent revolt
of the working class, Mane and Engels were right on the money.
These authors actually created the now-clich6 genre of "boy

of communism from ancient Rome to the discovery of America
(in a blatant attempt to spice up the visual appeal of the movie
adaptation).

Chances are, your stylist will have

hair factories such as Toni & Guy

more surprised by the eclectic clien

down in the waiting area, I found
myself surrounded by elderly
women. I reasoned that these con
servative-looking women must be
waiting for their nonconformist
daughters and granddaughters. I
didn't expect them to greet the
multi-tattooed, ultra-pierced
stylist with the lavender mo
hawk striding towards us
as though they were old
friends. I took this as a
sign that there was
something special
about Faux salon.

There was a reason why the 65+ crew trusted
these people with their tresses. So put your

most bookstores will try to "upsell" you to a premium edition of

that proclaimed quite appropriately, "Fuck Fash

to cover myself in, I was led to the sinks, where my
hair was shampooed, conditioned and massaged. I

After being seated in an incredibly comfortable

"I'm also tired of being told 'You ail look the same.'"
No problem. Faux Salon only hires talented gradu
ates of beauty college and puts them through a
two-year apprentice program for more training,
often times sending them to Paris. No wonder
Vogue magazine has written about them no fewer
than four times in recent years. Don't worry about
condescending employees, though — they're
much more down-to-earth than the self-proclaimed
Intellectual elite" you probably encounter every
day.
Elizabeth gave me one of the best haircuts I ever
got in my life. After listening to my proletariat con
cerns and agreeing to aid me in my rebellion, I
was liberated from the oppressive mullet that had
forced me to tuck my strands into pigtails for
weeks.

What did this cost me, you ask? Fifty sacks of potatoes and a fifth
of my farm. Faux is a bit pricey, with cuts ranging from $40 and up.
Can't afford it? Do what I do — offer your hair up for their apprentice
learning program. It's for the greater good, because Faux needs hair
models every Tuesday evening at 6. Definitely call ahead and ask if
they have openings. You'll get a free or nearly-free haircut and will
be the envy of everyone in your commune. Be sure to tip your liber
ator, they deserve it.
Don't let those Commies get you down. Faux Salon is located at 378
E. Campbell Ave., Campbell, Calif. 95003. A complete price listing
can be found online at www.dk-industries.com/faux/index.php. Call

Elizabeth gave me one of the best haircuts I ever
got in my life. After listening to my proletariat con

was liberated from the oppressive mullet that had
forced me to tuck my strands into pigtails for
weeks.

What did this cost me, you ask? Fifty sacks of potatoes and a fifth
of my farm. Faux is a bit pricey, with cuts ranging from $40 and up.
Can't afford it? Do what I do — offer your hair up for their apprentice
learning program. It's for the greater good, because Faux needs hair
models every Tuesday evening at 6. Definitely call ahead and ask if
they have openings. You'll get a free or nearly-free haircut and will
be the envy of everyone in your commune. Be sure to tip your liber

Karl Marx and Papa Smurt.

The last thing your hair sees
before it dies.



The last thing you

KGB takes you.

This won't work without penguins to rule
over us all.
Anyone with even the most humdrum childhood will recall sit
ting down in front of the television on those beautiful Saturday
mornings and entering a land where miniature blue creatures
spend their (toys frolicking around mushroom houses while
doing their best to avoid always-dangerous cats. The many ad
ventures of the shirtless, white-hatted Smurfs entertained gen
erations of children and taught them many valuable lessons, But
were the Smurfs teaching children the nght lessons?
Tlieories as to the real purpose of the animated Smurfs have
ranged from innocent kiddie-fair to the devious and corrupt. But
the most convincing theory proposed by manyleadingscientists
is that the Smurfs are a dWId-oriented representation of a Marx
ist community. Irt other words, the Smurife are commies.t H

If we examine the evidenoe, this idea is quite well supported by the
metaphors and symbols embedded in every episode Starting from the top of
the Smurf hierarchy, Papa Smurf dearly represents Karl Maw. Not only does
he have a Marxist beard, but he is also the only Smurf to wear red, the color
most associated with communism.
Respected because of his age and wisdom, he resides over a self-sufficient
community, or commune, where everyone is treated as equals (despite the
obvious greater worth of Farmer and Handy Smurf over members like Lazy
Smurf) and no one owns their own land. Rather, the land is owned by the
Smurf community at large.
In their economically self-contained commune, Smurfs neferto themselves as
"smurf in much the same way as the title "comrade" is applied to citizens of a

communist state. When you
think about it, "farmer smurf is
actually pretty dose to "com
rade Lenin."
In addition to this verbal so
cial leveler, all Smurfs wear the
same outfit, rather reminiscent
of a classic Maoist uniform.
Furthermore, there is no "King
Smurf or "Priest Smurf," imply
ing a condemnation of social
hierarchy as well as organized
religion.
The antithesis of the Utopian
Smurf society is the series' vil
lain, Gargomel. An embodi

ment of the evils of capitalism, he is greedy and concerned only with his own
satisfaction, His quest to eat the Smurfs — hardly a good source of nutrition
— shows how capitalists find nothing as gratifying as annihilating a truly idyl
lic commune.
Finally there is Smurfette. One can only wonder what her role in this ho
mogenously male environment could be. Since she is set apart by her
gender and the idea that every Smurf is equal, it is safe to assume that
the Smurf motto "share and share alike" includes her.
Devious and dastardly, the messages subversively promoted by
the blue devils in white hats have quietly corrupted the very fabric of
our society. However, their evil pales in comparison to the darkness
known as the Snortcs.

Reading it now,
"The Communist Mani

predicted the rise of consumerism, federalism and intellectual

These authors actually created the now-clich6 genre of "boy

of communism from ancient Rome to the discovery of America
(in a blatant attempt to spice up the visual appeal of the movie

Karl Marx and Papa Smurt.
Saturated at BlrtliP



The last thing your hair sees
before it dies.



The last thing you
see before the
KGB takes you.
. • ' V' ;


This won't work without penguins to rule
over us all.
Anyone with even the most humdrum childhood will recall sit
ting down in front of the television on those beautiful Saturday
mornings and entering a land where miniature blue creatures
spend their (toys frolicking around mushroom houses while
doing their best to avoid always-dangerous cats. The many ad
ventures of the shirtless, white-hatted Smurfs entertained gen
erations of children and taught them many valuable lessons, But
were the Smurfs teaching children the nght lessons?
Tlieories as to the real purpose of the animated Smurfs have
ranged from innocent kiddie-fair to the devious and corrupt. But
the most convincing theory proposed by manyleadingscientists
is that the Smurfs are a dWId-oriented representation of a Marx
ist community. Irt other words, the Smurife are commies.t H

If we examine the evidenoe, this idea is quite well supported by the
metaphors and symbols embedded in every episode Starting from the top of
the Smurf hierarchy, Papa Smurf dearly represents Karl Maw. Not only does
he have a Marxist beard, but he is also the only Smurf to wear red, the color
most associated with communism.
Respected because of his age and wisdom, he resides over a self-sufficient
community, or commune, where everyone is treated as equals (despite the
obvious greater worth of Farmer and Handy Smurf over members like Lazy
Smurf) and no one owns their own land. Rather, the land is owned by the
Smurf community at large.
In their economically self-contained commune, Smurfs neferto themselves as
"smurf in much the same way as the title "comrade" is applied to citizens of a

communist state. When you
think about it, "farmer smurf is
actually pretty dose to "com
rade Lenin."
In addition to this verbal so
cial leveler, all Smurfs wear the
same outfit, rather reminiscent
of a classic Maoist uniform.
Furthermore, there is no "King
Smurf or "Priest Smurf," imply
ing a condemnation of social
hierarchy as well as organized
religion.
The antithesis of the Utopian
Smurf society is the series' vil
lain, Gargomel. An embodi

ment of the evils of capitalism, he is greedy and concerned only with his own
satisfaction, His quest to eat the Smurfs — hardly a good source of nutrition
— shows how capitalists find nothing as gratifying as annihilating a truly idyl
lic commune.
Finally there is Smurfette. One can only wonder what her role in this ho
mogenously male environment could be. Since she is set apart by her
gender and the idea that every Smurf is equal, it is safe to assume that
the Smurf motto "share and share alike" includes her.
Devious and dastardly, the messages subversively promoted by
the blue devils in white hats have quietly corrupted the very fabric of
our society. However, their evil pales in comparison to the darkness
known as the Snortcs.

Reading it now,
"The Communist Mani

predicted the rise of consumerism, federalism and intellectual

These authors actually created the now-clich6 genre of "boy

of communism from ancient Rome to the discovery of America
(in a blatant attempt to spice up the visual appeal of the movie

Chances are, your stylist will have

blue or hot pink in their hair. But don't
worry. Having offered my hair up to
hair factories such as Toni & Guy
and Aveda, I wasn't fazed. I was
more surprised by the eclectic clien
tele that this salon attracts. As I sat
down in the waiting area, I found
myself surrounded by elderly
women. I reasoned that these con
servative-looking women must be
waiting for their nonconformist
daughters and granddaughters. I
didn't expect them to greet the
multi-tattooed, ultra-pierced
stylist with the lavender mo
hawk striding towards us
as though they were old
friends. I took this as a
sign that there was
something special
about Faux salon.

There was a reason why the 65+ crew trusted
these people with their tresses. So put your
fears to rest. You won t walk out of here with
an "upscale, sophisticated rat tail" (the
9 A house specialty) unless you ask for one.
I was assigned to Elizabeth, whose

"gtg" and two "lol's" away from being the product not of two
enormous economic minds but a 13-year-old girl on a cell
phone, remember that it is done as a longtime fan.
After writing the "Manifesto," Mare and Engels broke up. The
reasons? A mixture of skyrocketing production costs, their
deaths and the tiresome meddling of Yoko. So don't wait to
catch them on tour —pick up this book. [A cautionary note:
most bookstores will try to "upsell" you to a premium edition of
the work, perhaps leather-bound, that includes B-sides, demo
tapes or live versions. Avoid these like the plague, or you'll end
up as ashamed as the time you walked into Tower looking to
buy The Sign" single and walked out with an Ace of Base box
set.] This collaboration marked the peak of each of their ca
reers: Marx's sophomore effort, "Das Kapttal," is admittedly ge
nius, but also an FDA-approved treatment for insomnia. And
Engels never managed to regain his footing after the emotion
al toll of the faction, instead spending years in and out of rehab
hoping against hope fora reunion tour and writing no fewer
than twelve distinct prefaces over the next forty years.
Which isn't a bad thing, per se: if some other fallen legends
had taken a similar route, our world might have been spared
both Wings and "Ringo and the All-Starrs."

The Record Bin" encourages readers to try
oldies but goodies by reviewing art that's
moved from the new releases shelf to the
classics rack.

smock was adorned with multiple pins, notably one
that proclaimed quite appropriately, "Fuck Fash
ion."After being handed a black kimono style wrap
to cover myself in, I was led to the sinks, where my
hair was shampooed, conditioned and massaged. I
almost fell asleep.
After being seated in an incredibly comfortable
swivel chair, my stylist asked me what I wanted to
do with my hair. "Get rid of this mullet," I pleaded.
"I'm also tired of being told 'You ail look the same.'"
No problem. Faux Salon only hires talented gradu
ates of beauty college and puts them through a
two-year apprentice program for more training,
often times sending them to Paris. No wonder
Vogue magazine has written about them no fewer
than four times in recent years. Don't worry about
condescending employees, though — they're
much more down-to-earth than the self-proclaimed
Intellectual elite" you probably encounter every
day.
Elizabeth gave me one of the best haircuts I ever
got in my life. After listening to my proletariat con
cerns and agreeing to aid me in my rebellion, I
was liberated from the oppressive mullet that had
forced me to tuck my strands into pigtails for
weeks.

What did this cost me, you ask? Fifty sacks of potatoes and a fifth
of my farm. Faux is a bit pricey, with cuts ranging from $40 and up.
Can't afford it? Do what I do — offer your hair up for their apprentice
learning program. It's for the greater good, because Faux needs hair
models every Tuesday evening at 6. Definitely call ahead and ask if
they have openings. You'll get a free or nearly-free haircut and will
be the envy of everyone in your commune. Be sure to tip your liber
ator, they deserve it.
Don't let those Commies get you down. Faux Salon is located at 378
E. Campbell Ave., Campbell, Calif. 95003. A complete price listing
