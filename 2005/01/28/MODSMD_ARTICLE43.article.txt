# LIKE WATER, BUT BETTER

### COMRADE JOHN HOLGATE COMMUMISSION POTATO FARMER 
Just because we live under a repressive regime that favors
back-alley murder to political discourse doesn't mean we can't
live it up a bit. Careful preparation, some money to grease the
wheels, and a high tolerance for sub-zero temperatures are all
you need to make sure your next party doesn't end up like Leon
Trotsky — lying in Mexico City with an ice pick in its back.
Step 1 — Secrecy. The first rule of Project Communist
Party (PCP) is you don't ask questions. In fact, the fewer peo
ple you talk to about PCP, the better. Anybody could be a spy
— even your mother (sorry, especially your mother).
Step 2 — Distillation. Let's face it, you'll need some vodka
for this party. It will liven things up, keep people warm and can
be used to disinfect any cuts sustained when guests jump the
barbed wire. To determine whether your moonshine is strong
enough, here's a guide:
Too weak —Uncle Leo drinks half the bottle with no effect,
then gives the rest of the "water" to Baby Yuri, who finishes it off
and is found the next morning with a huge penis drawn on his
forehead.
Too strong—You black out after inhaling the vapors and
wake up next to a hairy man named Ivan in a Siberian work
camp.

Just right—The stars begin to shine more brightly and that farmer's daughter starts to become good
looking.
Step 3 — Permits. If you are planning to throw your party within the next two weeks, you should have
started applying forthe necessary permits about thirteen years ago. If you don't anticipate getting the cor
rect papers in time, you will need at least a dozen chickens or a small ox to pay off any curious soldiers
who wander by. You don't want to be slammed into the back of a railway car heading on a one-way track
to the gulag, do you?
Step 4 — Entertainment. Your party will only be as good as the diversion you provide. Check if Crazy
Kolya will do his impression of Lenin or see if Misha will perform her single-act play about the Revolution.
Remember, some musicians may be blacklisted by the authorities, so be careful who you talk to if you
value your children.
Step 5 —- The Party. Drink until you forget you are living in the USSR. Escape through alcohol is the
only escape you'll ever get, you Commie scum.
