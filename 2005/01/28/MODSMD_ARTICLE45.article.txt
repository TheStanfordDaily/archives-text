## The
						Stanford Theatre 
### COMRADE CHRIS "CONG" CHAN COMMUMISSION PROPAGANDA FILM DIRECTOR 
As I near the end of my fourth year, I've heard
many excuses for why students haven't gone to
the Stanford Theatre, that perennial mainstay of
University Avenue with the old-fashioned mar
quee and flashy neon lights.
"Oh, you mean Borders?"
— Frankie Frosh
No, Frankie Frosh, that capitalist haven might
resemble the Stanford Theatre on the outside,
but inside it is a despicable tribute to corporate
conformity. The Stanford Theatre, on the other
hand, is a place of wonder and beauty.
A Greek / Assyrian style movie palace, the
Stanford Theatre first opened its doors in 1925.
In 1987, the David and Lucille Packard Founda
tion purchased the theatre to preserve the his
toric building and to provide a venue for films
from Hollywood's Golden Age. The theatre's
programming consists of 100% classic films,
mostly from 1920 to 1965.
"Classic? Isn 1 that a synonym for boring?"
— Susie Sophomore
Hardly. The decor alone packs more excite-

ment than any of those crappy
movies That Guy in your dorm
ripped the other day. Plus, they
sell popcorn for less than two
bucks. How you can beat that?
Not to mention the fact that a
professional organ player pops
out of nowhere at the end of the
show, performing to your
heart's content. Clearly, this
theatre is an experience that ex
tends far beyond the movie it
self.
Besides, have you seen the
crap thafs in multiplexes these
days? "Racing Stripes" is
about a talking zebra. "Elektra"
is fast outdoing Daredevil and
Punisher as the worst comic
book movie ever. "White
Noise" is about household
recording devices. If I wanted
to be scared shitless by the
so-called "electronic voice
phenomenon," I could have
just as easily turned my stereo
volume on really high, downed
a few shrooms and let the fun
begin...

"But I hate romantic comedies. They're so for
mulaic."
— Jimmy Junior
Alright, so if s true that many classic films are
romantic comedies, and that many of those ro
mantic comedies have a rather simplistic formu
la — guy meets girl, guy falls in love, girl resists,
guy persists, and then they abruptly hook up at
the end, conveniently omitting the part where he
ditches her days before the wedding and she is
left to raise an obnoxious crying brat out of wed
lock.
Nevertheless, the actors and actresses back
then possessed qualities that few kids in show
business have today: charisma and talent.
Keanu Reeves in "Sweet November" versus
Fred Astaire in The Belle of New York?" Who
are you kidding? Britney Spears in "Crossroads"
versus Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday?"
Don't even bother.
"Alright, so you've sold me. But I'm a frosh
and have no car."
— Shirley Senior
Yeah, whatever. I've heard that one before.
If s a ten-minute bike ride and half-hour walk
from most dorrns. You could use the exercise 112.
