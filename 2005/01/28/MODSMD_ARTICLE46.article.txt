holiday season, I'm

guessing you're
halfway toward
your Freshman
15. And even if
you're too "cold"
to bike or walk
(as if you actually

California win

guerite sends
plenty of shut
tles downtown
and back (not
that I've actu

such ends, but I hear it
works and shows up on
time these days). And if
all else fails, borrow a

seduce that upper
classman with ambigu

check out the Stanford
Theatre (www.stanfordthe

across the street from the
place where you live off of
the "free slice" coupons
you pilfer from all those

copies of the Stanford Directory and
Unofficial Guide. The weekend of January
28-30 will be the last weekend of a tribute to
Fred Astaire, who is regarded by most as
the greatest dancer to ever grace the silver
screen. Eat your heart out, Honey Daniels.
