## Cheesecake Factory just doesn't have same feel of Potato Factory The 						Cheesecake Factory 
### COMRADE TAM VO COMMUMISSION CULINARY HEALTH INSPECTOR 
This is the first of a series of quickie
undercover inspections brought to you
by Commumission, The People's In
termission. Escorted by Comrade
Drew Peterson, I was safe from the
prying eyes of the KGB. Pretending to
be patrons who had a prior reservation,
we entered the premises unnoticed
and infiltrated all aspects of the eatery.
From stealing bread to checking under
tables to interrogating employees, we
did everything imaginable in less than
10 minutes — except order food.

THE NAME: The Cheesecake Factory
THE COORDINATES: 375 University
Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94301
THE SEATING CAPACITY: If you
want to go to the Factory for dinner
next week, you should have made the
reservation 10 years ago (9 years be
fore the restaurant opened in Palo
Alto). Be prepared to huddle with your
comrades in the lines that snake out
side the building and down the street.
While you are waiting to nourish your
empty belly, read the list of rations that
the Factory produces.
THE FACILITIES: The standardiza
tion of the Factory's restrooms is almost
shockingly opulent compared to the
communal outhouses and dirt holes

many laborers are used to. For the fe
males, four lavatory stalls (two of which
facilitate the handicapped and larger
patrons) yield white porcelain toilets
with automatic flushing mechanisms.
Ranging from 6' x 3.5' to 9' x 4' in size,
they can easily accommodate all your
clandestine needs (that's right, there's
enough space to hook up with even the
tallest Soviet basketball player). A soft
spotlight shines directly above each toi
let. For increased efficiency, the show
er-like sink spigots (also motion-sensi
tive) yield just the right amount of water.
A full-length mirror allows you to spruce
your matted hair up — make sure to
impress the Party officials. For the
males, the Factory felt two urinals were

enough to facilitate the efficient dispen
sation of bodily fluids.
THE CLEANLINESS: Pretending that
I had forgotten something important in
an abandoned booth that had not yet
been cleared, I quickly checked under
the table for gum and secret KGB doc
uments. Surprisingly, I found nothing,
which means only one thing — labor
ers who fail to meet Factory standards
are forced to scrape away gum wads
and informants after work.
THE FACTORY: Although it advertis
es itself as "The Cheesecake Factory,"
any signs of industrialization are clev
erly hidden by excessive marble tiling
and whimsical airbrushed murals. If
your footwear lacks traction and you

end up slipping, the KGB has the right
to shoot you. We were forced to sneak
into the employee / personnel only
area, where the Factory's minions
quickly and efficiently ran plates to and

fro from the dining
area to the kitchen.
The stainless steel
and clockwork ma
chinery lies behind
the fagade of terra
cotta colored walls
and soft art-deco
lighting. An army of
beige and black
wicker chairs beck
on weary peasants
to sit and enjoy their
rations. If possible,
opt for the leather
covered bench seats

and booths, which provide more priva
cy, lest someone find out about your
plans to overthrow the government.
THE LABOR: Clad in the standard
uniform of crisp white shirts and white
pants, the Factory laborers are gener
ally attractive and attentive. We were
surprised at their enthusiasm and de
sire to please, as it was past 1900
hours (that's 7 p.m. for you nomen
klatura). Their smiles do not hint at the
suffering they endure daily — just look
at the grimy leather and torn lining of
their once-white shoes. The speed at
which they serve orders and fill water
glasses is astonishingly efficient or as
tontshingly sluggish, depending on the
crowd. Upon our request fora writing
utensil, the labor coordinator obedient
ly offered her own.
THE NOMENKLATURA (The Elite): If

membership

er Party class

a communist, but he is not a porn star. — Grandpa Simpson

workers who can afford The Factory's
rations, push your wheelbarrow full of
rubles to the head of the line. On this
night, The Factory attracted primarily
Asian couples of Chinese descent
Comrades of Red China feel welcome
in the equality that the Factory offers
them. Particularly oppressed laborers
who want to temporarily forget their
woes enjoy being waited on by equally
oppressed Factory workers. Intellectu
al rebels pretend that they do not sup-

port the capitalism that
marks this company's
franchise.
MANIFESTO: During

many years of
hard work build
ing upon their vi
sion of cheese
cake for the
common man,
Oscar and Eve
lyn Overton truly
did achieve 'The
American
Dream." Accord
ing to their story,
the "early years

were extremely lean and sometimes
very difficult. Evelyn and Oscar often
worked 18-hour days." However, their

capitalist son David
opened up the first 1
Cheesecake Facto- 1
ry restaurant in an f
unusual location— \
Beverly Hills.
THE RATIONS:
The shiny list of ra
tions we received
ran on for four pages
of alcoholic bever
ages before begin
ning to mention
solids. A little disturb
ing was the presence
of "Dry Sack" label co

gnac, "Wet" brand gin and the subcat
egory "Super-creamy Drinks." The
regime is fond of utilizing quotation

marks to describe ambiguous hy
bridized foods such as the Hawaiian
fish "burger," Cajun chicken "Littles"
and the Jumbo "chicken chop." This
further confirmed that The Factory is
nothing like it seemed. We could find
no consistency in the menu except in
its assurance of large portions and its
massive attempt to equally cover all
patrons' palates.
The Factory realizes that their cui
sine attracts many small Asian day la-

borers, and tailors their portion size for
equal distribution among parties. One
helping of the"Mile High Meatloaf"
(dinner can easily feed a family of five.
For those who are strapped for rubles,
take care to ask for extra rations of the
complimentary white and brown bread
— tuck them into your pockets to
stave off hunger pains tomorrow.
For the lactose-intolerant, 35 varia
tions of cheesecake are offered by the
Factory.

PROPAGANDA: Capitalist goods
such as diamond bracelets, cruise
ships and Bebe brand clothing (mod
eled by European waifs) are featured

on alternating pages of
the Factory menu. Oddly
enough, the Factory
regime allowed capitalist
Americans to advertise in
their publication — "Harry

and Hannah Herrington:
All American Teddy Bears"

(limited edition) embark on
'The American Adventure,"
which seems to consist of

? wearing denim overalls, white
' sneakers and patriotic colors.
While walking, as much as
stuffed animals are capable of,

on freshly trimmed grass. With the
American flag waving softly in the
background. The advertisement reads
'Travel along with brother and sister

twins Harry and Hannah Herrington,
on their adventures around the world."
As a Commumission comrade who
hasn't been paid since last June, I can't
afford that adventure.
Other kernels of propaganda litter
the menu in unexpected places. "The
Navajo" sandwich is offered daily, on
"warm fry bread stuffed with grilled

chicken, avocado, lettuce, tomato, red
onion and mayonnaise, served with fries"
for 995 rubles. Native Americans hunted
buffalo, not overpriced sandwiches. The
Factory also tries to appeal to those with
yellow fever, serving up "Bang-Bang chick
en and shrimp" over steamed rice for 1595
rubles. Is this something Ho Chi Minh might
order? The subliminal message here may
be "Kill Bill." An attempt to fuse races to

gether with "Chino-Latino Steak" seems al
most racist. However, Communism IS all
about homogeny.
When we asked the front desk for nutri
tional facts, they feigned ignorance. When
asked what the "Steak Diane" (1895
rubles) was, the laborers brought their
manager over. "Who is she, and what did
you do with her?" we demanded. "The peo
ple deserve to know!"
As they pulled back their jackets to
reveal sleek pistols, Comrade Peterson
and I decided we didn't really need to
know who Diane was. We bolted for the
exit, ready to return to our prior meager
existence.

When we asked the front desk for nutri

As they pulled back their jackets to

and I decided we didn't really need to

existence.
This is the first of a series of quickie
undercover inspections brought to you
by Commumission, The People's In

Drew Peterson, I was safe from the
prying eyes of the KGB. Pretending to
be patrons who had a prior reservation,
we entered the premises unnoticed
and infiltrated all aspects of the eatery.
From stealing bread to checking under
tables to interrogating employees, we
did everything imaginable in less than
10 minutes — except order food.

THE NAME: The Cheesecake Factory
THE COORDINATES: 375 University
Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94301
THE SEATING CAPACITY: If you
want to go to the Factory for dinner
next week, you should have made the
reservation 10 years ago (9 years be
fore the restaurant opened in Palo
Alto). Be prepared to huddle with your
comrades in the lines that snake out
side the building and down the street.
While you are waiting to nourish your
empty belly, read the list of rations that
the Factory produces.
THE FACILITIES: The standardiza
tion of the Factory's restrooms is almost
shockingly opulent compared to the
communal outhouses and dirt holes

many laborers are used to. For the fe
males, four lavatory stalls (two of which
facilitate the handicapped and larger
patrons) yield white porcelain toilets
with automatic flushing mechanisms.
Ranging from 6' x 3.5' to 9' x 4' in size,
they can easily accommodate all your
clandestine needs (that's right, there's
enough space to hook up with even the
tallest Soviet basketball player). A soft
spotlight shines directly above each toi
let. For increased efficiency, the show
er-like sink spigots (also motion-sensi
tive) yield just the right amount of water.
A full-length mirror allows you to spruce
your matted hair up — make sure to
impress the Party officials. For the
males, the Factory felt two urinals were

enough to facilitate the efficient dispen
sation of bodily fluids.
THE CLEANLINESS: Pretending that
I had forgotten something important in
an abandoned booth that had not yet
been cleared, I quickly checked under
the table for gum and secret KGB doc
uments. Surprisingly, I found nothing,
which means only one thing — labor
ers who fail to meet Factory standards
are forced to scrape away gum wads
and informants after work.
THE FACTORY: Although it advertis
es itself as "The Cheesecake Factory,"
any signs of industrialization are clev
erly hidden by excessive marble tiling
and whimsical airbrushed murals. If
your footwear lacks traction and you

end up slipping, the KGB has the right
to shoot you. We were forced to sneak
into the employee / personnel only
area, where the Factory's minions
quickly and efficiently ran plates to and

fro from the dining
area to the kitchen.
The stainless steel
and clockwork ma
chinery lies behind
the fagade of terra
cotta colored walls
and soft art-deco
lighting. An army of
beige and black
wicker chairs beck
on weary peasants
to sit and enjoy their
rations. If possible,
opt for the leather
covered bench seats

and booths, which provide more priva
cy, lest someone find out about your
plans to overthrow the government.
THE LABOR: Clad in the standard
uniform of crisp white shirts and white
pants, the Factory laborers are gener
ally attractive and attentive. We were
surprised at their enthusiasm and de
sire to please, as it was past 1900
hours (that's 7 p.m. for you nomen
klatura). Their smiles do not hint at the
suffering they endure daily — just look
at the grimy leather and torn lining of
their once-white shoes. The speed at
which they serve orders and fill water
glasses is astonishingly efficient or as
tontshingly sluggish, depending on the
crowd. Upon our request fora writing
utensil, the labor coordinator obedient
ly offered her own.

are forced to scrape away gum wads
and informants after work.
THE FACTORY: Although it advertis
es itself as "The Cheesecake Factory,"
any signs of industrialization are clev
erly hidden by excessive marble tiling
and whimsical airbrushed murals. If
your footwear lacks traction and you

end up slipping, the KGB has the right
to shoot you. We were forced to sneak
into the employee / personnel only
area, where the Factory's minions
quickly and efficiently ran plates to and

fro from the dining
area to the kitchen.
The stainless steel
and clockwork ma
chinery lies behind
the fagade of terra
cotta colored walls
and soft art-deco
lighting. An army of
beige and black
wicker chairs beck
on weary peasants
to sit and enjoy their
rations. If possible,
opt for the leather
covered bench seats

and booths, which provide more priva
cy, lest someone find out about your
plans to overthrow the government.
THE LABOR: Clad in the standard
uniform of crisp white shirts and white
pants, the Factory laborers are gener
ally attractive and attentive. We were
surprised at their enthusiasm and de
sire to please, as it was past 1900
hours (that's 7 p.m. for you nomen
klatura). Their smiles do not hint at the
suffering they endure daily — just look
at the grimy leather and torn lining of
their once-white shoes. The speed at
which they serve orders and fill water
glasses is astonishingly efficient or as
tontshingly sluggish, depending on the
crowd. Upon our request fora writing
utensil, the labor coordinator obedient
ly offered her own.

workers who can afford The Factory's
rations, push your wheelbarrow full of
rubles to the head of the line. On this
night, The Factory attracted primarily
Asian couples of Chinese descent
Comrades of Red China feel welcome
in the equality that the Factory offers
them. Particularly oppressed laborers
who want to temporarily forget their
woes enjoy being waited on by equally
oppressed Factory workers. Intellectu
al rebels pretend that they do not sup-

port the capitalism that
marks this company's
franchise.
MANIFESTO: During

many years of
hard work build
ing upon their vi
sion of cheese
cake for the
common man,
Oscar and Eve
lyn Overton truly
did achieve 'The
American
Dream." Accord
ing to their story,
the "early years

were extremely lean and sometimes
very difficult. Evelyn and Oscar often
worked 18-hour days." However, their

capitalist son David
opened up the first 1
Cheesecake Facto- 1
ry restaurant in an f
unusual location— \
Beverly Hills.
THE RATIONS:
The shiny list of ra
tions we received
ran on for four pages
of alcoholic bever
ages before begin
ning to mention
solids. A little disturb
ing was the presence
of "Dry Sack" label co

gnac, "Wet" brand gin and the subcat
egory "Super-creamy Drinks." The
regime is fond of utilizing quotation

marks to describe ambiguous hy
bridized foods such as the Hawaiian
fish "burger," Cajun chicken "Littles"
and the Jumbo "chicken chop." This
further confirmed that The Factory is
nothing like it seemed. We could find
no consistency in the menu except in
its assurance of large portions and its
massive attempt to equally cover all
patrons' palates.
The Factory realizes that their cui
sine attracts many small Asian day la-

borers, and tailors their portion size for
equal distribution among parties. One
helping of the"Mile High Meatloaf"
(dinner can easily feed a family of five.
For those who are strapped for rubles,
take care to ask for extra rations of the
complimentary white and brown bread
— tuck them into your pockets to
stave off hunger pains tomorrow.
For the lactose-intolerant, 35 varia
tions of cheesecake are offered by the
Factory.

PROPAGANDA: Capitalist goods
such as diamond bracelets, cruise
ships and Bebe brand clothing (mod
eled by European waifs) are featured

on alternating pages of
the Factory menu. Oddly
enough, the Factory
regime allowed capitalist
Americans to advertise in
their publication — "Harry

and Hannah Herrington:
All American Teddy Bears"

(limited edition) embark on
'The American Adventure,"
which seems to consist of

? wearing denim overalls, white
' sneakers and patriotic colors.
While walking, as much as
stuffed animals are capable of,

on freshly trimmed grass. With the
American flag waving softly in the
background. The advertisement reads
'Travel along with brother and sister

twins Harry and Hannah Herrington,
on their adventures around the world."
As a Commumission comrade who
hasn't been paid since last June, I can't
afford that adventure.
Other kernels of propaganda litter
the menu in unexpected places. "The
Navajo" sandwich is offered daily, on
"warm fry bread stuffed with grilled

chicken, avocado, lettuce, tomato, red
onion and mayonnaise, served with fries"
for 995 rubles. Native Americans hunted
buffalo, not overpriced sandwiches. The
Factory also tries to appeal to those with
yellow fever, serving up "Bang-Bang chick
en and shrimp" over steamed rice for 1595
rubles. Is this something Ho Chi Minh might
order? The subliminal message here may
be "Kill Bill." An attempt to fuse races to

gether with "Chino-Latino Steak" seems al
most racist. However, Communism IS all
about homogeny.
When we asked the front desk for nutri
tional facts, they feigned ignorance. When
asked what the "Steak Diane" (1895
rubles) was, the laborers brought their
manager over. "Who is she, and what did
you do with her?" we demanded. "The peo
ple deserve to know!"
As they pulled back their jackets to
reveal sleek pistols, Comrade Peterson
and I decided we didn't really need to
know who Diane was. We bolted for the
exit, ready to return to our prior meager
existence.
This is the first of a series of quickie
undercover inspections brought to you
by Commumission, The People's In
termission. Escorted by Comrade
Drew Peterson, I was safe from the
prying eyes of the KGB. Pretending to
be patrons who had a prior reservation,
we entered the premises unnoticed
and infiltrated all aspects of the eatery.
From stealing bread to checking under
tables to interrogating employees, we
did everything imaginable in less than
10 minutes — except order food.

THE NAME: The Cheesecake Factory
THE COORDINATES: 375 University
Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94301
THE SEATING CAPACITY: If you
want to go to the Factory for dinner
next week, you should have made the
reservation 10 years ago (9 years be
fore the restaurant opened in Palo
Alto). Be prepared to huddle with your
comrades in the lines that snake out
side the building and down the street.
While you are waiting to nourish your
empty belly, read the list of rations that
the Factory produces.
THE FACILITIES: The standardiza
tion of the Factory's restrooms is almost
shockingly opulent compared to the
communal outhouses and dirt holes

many laborers are used to. For the fe
males, four lavatory stalls (two of which
facilitate the handicapped and larger
patrons) yield white porcelain toilets
with automatic flushing mechanisms.
Ranging from 6' x 3.5' to 9' x 4' in size,
they can easily accommodate all your
clandestine needs (that's right, there's
enough space to hook up with even the
tallest Soviet basketball player). A soft
spotlight shines directly above each toi
let. For increased efficiency, the show
er-like sink spigots (also motion-sensi
tive) yield just the right amount of water.
A full-length mirror allows you to spruce
your matted hair up — make sure to
impress the Party officials. For the
males, the Factory felt two urinals were

enough to facilitate the efficient dispen
sation of bodily fluids.
THE CLEANLINESS: Pretending that
I had forgotten something important in
an abandoned booth that had not yet
been cleared, I quickly checked under
the table for gum and secret KGB doc
uments. Surprisingly, I found nothing,
which means only one thing — labor
ers who fail to meet Factory standards
are forced to scrape away gum wads
and informants after work.
THE FACTORY: Although it advertis
es itself as "The Cheesecake Factory,"
