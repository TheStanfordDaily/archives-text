### COMRADE NEIL MUKHOPADHYAY COMMUMISSION LIFESTYLE CHAIRMAN 
In pursuit of dens of Bay Area Communism,
I knew that the usual sources of information
would be utterly useless to me. Instead of
going to newspapers, homing pigeons and
Google, I decided to rely on my own extensive
experience in the pink.
My first planned stop was "The Russian Art
and Memorabilia Store" in the Vallco Shop
ping center. You see, I used to be an aspiring
emo kid, and in my attempts to be equally emo
as my peers, I decided that I needed to stick
some commie pins and patches on a book
bag that was too small to possibly carry any

thing more than a copy of "Catcher in The

Rye." And for this, the Russian Art
and Memorabilia Store was the

place to go.
I, like other budding Marx
ists, knew the coolest and

most hip way to be differ
ent and counter-culture

was to adopt the para
phernalia of an ideolog
ical revolution that
stressed homogene
ity. Because hyper-in
dividualistic American
culture was so hetero
geneous that hetero
geneity was becoming
homogeneous and the
only way to fight hetero

geneity was homogeneity.
Right? Right. That was too

complicated, and the mes
senger bag hurt my shoulder,

so the emo phase didn't last for
long. But when I arrived at the store

front that used to be the bastion of Cold
War gear and emo beacon of hope, I was

A specter is haunting Europe — the
specter of communism. — Karl Marx

shocked to find it was out of business, along
with every store on the first floor of Vallco.
Next Commie stop: Sputnik's in south San
Jose. Sputnik's donut shop operated for
about 30 years and was famous for"The
Sputnik." This thing was one of those brilliant
food inventions so bad for you that even vet
erinarians would warn against human con
sumption. It was a fried lump of dough stuffed
with a hamburger patty, condiments and
cheese. Scientists speculated that this bas
tard child of fried pastry and ground meat
would increase your chances of a heart attack
more than Vioxx would.
But what do I find out when I pull into the
parking lot? Sputnik's has been replaced with
"Supreme Donut." The new joint was some
kind of Vietnamese sandwich / donut shop,
but Ho Chi Minh's takeover of Lenin's proper
ty was not as exciting as I thought it would be.
I was unimpressed and very hungry. On the
wall rested a grid of Polaroid-quality pictures
of all the available sandwiches — I was dis
turbed that the management would advertise
such shoddy products so openly. I would be
much more inclined to order #179 if I didn't
have a high-resolution color picture to obliter
ate whatever naive, delicious illusion my brain
could have generated had I just read it as
"Best Tasty Crab

Sand-

wich" on some
barely legible,
Sriracha hot
sauce-stained
menu. I bought
two donut holes

and left.
But really now,
where had all the
commies gone? Then
it struck me — the last
place I knew in the
Bay Area that was
loosely linked to the
U.S.S.R. was right
under my nose. On
San Antonio Road in
Mountain View, in the
parking lot of Safeway
and next to Planned
Parenthood, towers
"The Russian Club."
Frequently passing
"the club" on the way
to the Central Ex
pressway, I never re
ally figured out exact
ly what it was. A mem
bers-only group? A
store? A hot night club
for lonely babushkas?
There was only one
way to find out. I
parked and walked
into what turned out
to be a specialty mar
ket for Russian
foods.

Mysterious bottles
of highly alcoholic
beverages dis

tilled from
. question

able food products lined the walls

and a pleasantly bready smell
hung in the air. Upon my en
i trance, a middle-aged Russian

woman dressed entirely in pale
yellow shot a very suspicious
and uncomfortably long look
at me. Being a poorly
groomed Indian male, I knew I
had to quickly and firmly estab
lish a legitimate reason for

' being inside the Russian Club. I
needed to be looking for some
thing, something that would

sound plausible for an obvious for
eigner to desire. A Soviet slide show

ran through my head: An unusually

shaped, rose-colored birthmark? No

Crippling radioactive gas spewed from the
melted reactor core? No. A busty and disillu
sioned mail-order bride named Ivanka?

Commumission is the death of the soul. It is
the organization of total conformity — in short,
of tyranny — and it is committed to making
tyranny universal. —AdlaiE. Stevenson

Maybe, but too many follow-up questions. A
piroshki? Perfect! For those readers who are
unfortunate piroshki-virqins, a piroshki is di
rectly akin to a culturally sanctioned Hot Pock
et (tm) filled with delicious seasoned ground
beef and unavailable in any offensive "lean"
forms. Trust me, these meat pockets are
damn good, as is most anything following the
meat + bread formula tends to be.
"Piroshki?" I asked her, avoiding the use
of any pesky verbs or adjectives. She imme
diately smiled and pointed to the deli
counter. I had my piroshki. It was terrible.
Just like Communism, it was unsuccessful,
dry, and would have been much better with a
little Grey Poupon. But the important part
was that I found what I set out for. I found the
last place where any decent red-blooded
Commie could sit back and enioy the fruits of
his economic system — a tiny, dessicated
piroshki.


Imagine what he would look like four beers
from now. Yummy



After the fall of the BeHin Wall, people couldn't be scared into buying
donuts anymore. Instead, they were fooled by daims of being "Supreme."
