## BANNED! 'Rubber Factory' shut down for being too subversive The 						Black Keys

One day you come home with a
new drug and it's amazing how
swiftly you slip from a responsive
member of society to a wasted shell
of your former self. One listen and
you're hooked. Just knowing you
can come home and play a track
brightens your mood all day.
Soon, you're playing the album
every day, sometimes more than
once. The guilt of your addiction

makes you glance with un
ease any time Red Army in
fantry passes by. You stop
hanging with your friends just
so you can sneak in your room
and slip the headphones over
your head. Classes become
secondary to that rush of the
opening song. You lose
everything that means any
thing to you.
Then what do you do? You
get your addicted ass outside
and try to get all your friends
hooked too.
"You got pains like an ad
dict / 10 a.m. automatic." Oh,
The Black Keys certainly
know the gnawing power of
obsession. This is the blues;
hot and primal, with a guitar
that sings of sweet bliss and a
man who sings the pain of the
world. The Black Keys are a
guitar and drums duo straight
from the industrial wasteland

of Akron, Ohio with three albums
now under their belt and no end to
the addiction in sight.
Their latest effort, "Rubber Fac
tory," blasts with such power that
I'm surprised the Soviet censors
allowed it to reach the public. Dan
Auerbach leads the way with blis
tering guitar work and a voice as
ancient as the Motherland itself.
Patrick Carney pounds the drum
set and uses his patented medi
um-fidelity production during stu
dio recording. "This system re
quires equal parts broke-ass shit
to equal parts hot-ass shit" read
the liner notes.
"Rubber Factory" opens with
"When the Lights Go Out," a

somber piece of gigantic
sound and agonizing
heartbreak. Is it a story
of emotional pain or a
blatant criticism of the
nightly power cuts that
plague everyone in So
viet Russia? "Act Nice
and Gentle" conveys the
philosophy of the Com
munist lifestyle — but
does the KGB know that
this gorgeous song was
originally written by

those capitalist
pigs, the Kinks?
The most surpris
ing part of the
album is the revo
lutionary tone of
the closer, "Till I
Get My Way." The
guitar crackles with
a life of its own.
Fuzzed-out but not
drowned out, The
Black Keys will
rock until the revo
lution.
In case the au
thorities ever de
cide to pull "Rub
ber Factory" from
the shelves of your
local cantina, you
should get your
frostbitten hands
on a copy of 2002's
"The Big Come Up"
or 2003's follow-up

"Thickfreakness." The
Black Keys' debut album
will blast the ice off your
roof with balls-to-the-wall
blues rock such as "Do
the Rump" and "Heavy
Soul." The guitar lick on
"The Breaks" is honestly
one of the greatest I have
ever heard, oozing a cool
that will sneak its way
into your bloodstream.
Armed with compelling
songwriting and a spirit
that cannot be extin
guished, The Black Keys
shall lead us to the
promised land; klasni in
any language.



Reading the People's publications, one can not help but marvel at
the glory of the State.


Unpardled prcdudion of rubber is a high priority of
the most recent five-year plan of GDmmumission.

the liner notes.
"Rubber Factory" opens with
"When the Lights Go Out," a

somber piece of gigantic
sound and agonizing
heartbreak. Is it a story
of emotional pain or a
blatant criticism of the
nightly power cuts that
plague everyone in So
viet Russia? "Act Nice
and Gentle" conveys the
philosophy of the Com
munist lifestyle — but
does the KGB know that
this gorgeous song was
originally written by

those capitalist
pigs, the Kinks?
The most surpris
ing part of the
album is the revo
lutionary tone of
the closer, "Till I
Get My Way." The
guitar crackles with
a life of its own.
Fuzzed-out but not
drowned out, The
Black Keys will
rock until the revo
lution.
In case the au
thorities ever de
cide to pull "Rub
ber Factory" from
the shelves of your
local cantina, you
should get your
frostbitten hands
on a copy of 2002's
"The Big Come Up"
or 2003's follow-up

"Thickfreakness." The
Black Keys' debut album
will blast the ice off your
roof with balls-to-the-wall
blues rock such as "Do
the Rump" and "Heavy
Soul." The guitar lick on
"The Breaks" is honestly
one of the greatest I have
ever heard, oozing a cool
that will sneak its way
into your bloodstream.
Armed with compelling
songwriting and a spirit
that cannot be extin
guished, The Black Keys
shall lead us to the
promised land; klasni in
any language.



Reading the People's publications, one can not help but marvel at
