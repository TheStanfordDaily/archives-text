# ASSU special fees system financially sound after scare
## 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A year ago, the ASSU's special
fees system, which allows students to
vote on which student groups re
ceive funding, faced a crisis. The per
centage of students choosing not to
pay the full fee or opting out alto
gether had tripled, from 8 percent to
around 25 percent. By the end of the
year, the refund rate was almost
quadruple the historic average.
"The system would not keep run
ning if this refund rate continued,"
senior Josh Shipp. then serving as
the ASSU senate chair, said at the
time.
But this year, either by miracle or
design, the refund request rate has
leapt back to its normal level, hover
ing around 8 percent. Student group
leaders attribute the sudden drop to
a number of factors, including struc
tural changes to the refund system

and a new attitude amongst groups
and students toward special fees.
"Part of it was just the publicity of
the problems last year," said senior
Chris Lin, the ASSU senate chair.
"People became aware of the prob
lems of the refund. I think groups
were more proactive in making peo
ple aware of what the refund does,
how it harms the group, what the
group does for the student body, and
things like that."
Student groups have an incentive
to keep their refund requests low.
Before, groups that earned special
fees received their complete budget
no matter how many students re
quested refunds. All groups are al
lowed an 8 percent buffer — that is,
if 8 percent of the student body re
quests refunds, the group is not
harmed. Any refunds requested that
exceed the buffer are subtracted
Changes to system structure credited with drop in special
fees requests from 30 percent last year to 8 percent this year

from the group's operating budget.
"Student groups suddenly have an inter
est in making sure people know about what
events they do. what they publish." Lin said.
No groups went over the eight percent limit
in fall quarter; the numbers for this quarter
haven't been finalized yet.
The ASSU made a number of other
changes to the way special fees work. Refund
requests no longer rollover from one quarter
to the next, meaning the request must be re

newed at the start of each term. The name
that appears on quarterly bills is no longer
"ASSU Fee" but, starting in spring, "Student
Group Fee," to better reflect where the
money is going, according to student leaders.
And. just as importantly, the refunds no
longer come straight to the student in the
form of a check. They now appear as a cred
it on tuition bills.
"There was a crusade by certain individu
als to get the refund," ASSU financial man

ager Justin Fishner-Wolfson said of the trou
bles last year. "It seemed like it got a lot of
coverage. They just think there is $90 float
ing out there."
And although the structural changes have
helped make the system run more smoothly,
it's more likely that the tremendous decrease
in refund rates is due to a shift in student at
titudes — an awareness of the damage that
unnecessary refund requests can do to on
campus groups and activities.

"Refunds don't roll over anymore," Fish
ner-Wolfson said. "But I don't think that's
keeping the rate down from 30 to 8 percent."
"1 have no idea why they dropped back,"
he continued. "I think everyone was sur
prised."
But if salvation came so easily, couldn't
damnation return just as quickly?
"It's pretty damn near impossible to
break the system." Fishner-Wolfson said.
"The problem was overblown last year. If

everyone wants a refund, fine. You'll bring
student groups to a halt on-campus, but
there's not necessarily anything wrong with
that."
In a worst-case scenario, the financial
manager could freeze groups' bank ac
counts, shutting off their spigot of funding
and ensuring the fiscal solvency of the
ASSU.

vote on which student groups re
ceive funding, faced a crisis. The per
centage of students choosing not to
pay the full fee or opting out alto
gether had tripled, from 8 percent to
around 25 percent. By the end of the
year, the refund rate was almost
quadruple the historic average.
"The system would not keep run
ning if this refund rate continued,"
senior Josh Shipp. then serving as
the ASSU senate chair, said at the
time.
But this year, either by miracle or
design, the refund request rate has
leapt back to its normal level, hover
ing around 8 percent. Student group
leaders attribute the sudden drop to
a number of factors, including struc
tural changes to the refund system

and a new attitude amongst groups
and students toward special fees.
"Part of it was just the publicity of
the problems last year," said senior
Chris Lin, the ASSU senate chair.
"People became aware of the prob
lems of the refund. I think groups
were more proactive in making peo
ple aware of what the refund does,
how it harms the group, what the
group does for the student body, and
things like that."
Student groups have an incentive
to keep their refund requests low.
Before, groups that earned special
fees received their complete budget
no matter how many students re
quested refunds. All groups are al
lowed an 8 percent buffer — that is,
if 8 percent of the student body re
quests refunds, the group is not
harmed. Any refunds requested that
exceed the buffer are subtracted
Changes to system structure credited with drop in special
fees requests from 30 percent last year to 8 percent this year

from the group's operating budget.
"Student groups suddenly have an inter
est in making sure people know about what
events they do. what they publish." Lin said.
No groups went over the eight percent limit
in fall quarter; the numbers for this quarter
haven't been finalized yet.
The ASSU made a number of other
changes to the way special fees work. Refund
requests no longer rollover from one quarter
to the next, meaning the request must be re

newed at the start of each term. The name
that appears on quarterly bills is no longer
"ASSU Fee" but, starting in spring, "Student
Group Fee," to better reflect where the
money is going, according to student leaders.
And. just as importantly, the refunds no
longer come straight to the student in the
form of a check. They now appear as a cred
it on tuition bills.
"There was a crusade by certain individu
als to get the refund," ASSU financial man

ager Justin Fishner-Wolfson said of the trou
bles last year. "It seemed like it got a lot of
coverage. They just think there is $90 float
ing out there."
And although the structural changes have
helped make the system run more smoothly,
it's more likely that the tremendous decrease
in refund rates is due to a shift in student at
titudes — an awareness of the damage that
unnecessary refund requests can do to on
campus groups and activities.

"Refunds don't roll over anymore," Fish
ner-Wolfson said. "But I don't think that's
keeping the rate down from 30 to 8 percent."
"1 have no idea why they dropped back,"
he continued. "I think everyone was sur
prised."
But if salvation came so easily, couldn't
damnation return just as quickly?
"It's pretty damn near impossible to
break the system." Fishner-Wolfson said.
"The problem was overblown last year. If

everyone wants a refund, fine. You'll bring
student groups to a halt on-campus, but
there's not necessarily anything wrong with
that."
In a worst-case scenario, the financial
manager could freeze groups' bank ac
counts, shutting off their spigot of funding
and ensuring the fiscal solvency of the
ASSU.
