### COMRADE ROXY SASS COMMUMISSION SEX GODDESS 
If Communism is associated with a red Hag
proudly waving its star, hammer and sickle, then
Communist-stvle sex would have to tie in red lace
with whips of uniform size and texture. After all.
no one gets to he different. Forget
where equal opportunity is a nice way to forgive
yourself for lowering your standards due to beer
goggles. Communism is a whole new arena. Com
munism forces upon \Vnrthe blind eye that will get
you laid — no matter how or why. After all, a sat
isfied state is a happy state. St) for the overall good
of the community, GO OUT AND GET SOME
ASS.
Just think of the awkward kid you see on the way to

your 9 a.m. —okay, so who are we
kidding your 1 pmclass — who

shuffles

down the middle of the hallway avoiding any eye con
tact, almost humping into you. ()r the guy who's prac
tically Spiderman as he glides against the wall, his
buggy eyes glued to your midriff. Now turn your
thoughts to the sorority'girl skipping through the mid
dle of the Quad, spreading good cheer to everyone
who passes. Using some deductive reasoning and the
analytical skills we picked up from " Blue's
VQues," let's figure out why. Easy. She's easy.
Ok. Maybe that was unfair, but the point is.
she's probably getting laid. Just imagine if you
were in a post-orgasm state. You'd be spreading
good cheer too. And so would that bumbling hall
way shuffler. Conclusion? Sexually satisfied peo
ple are happy people and happy people make
other people happier. Hence, Communism in the
bedroom, library, co-op shower, eating club
kitchen... wherever.
You can't get good without practice. Bedroom
Communism will make sure every Stanford stu
dent takes it upon himself / herself not only to get
ass. but to help others get better at giving it. When
the clock tower chimes 11 p.m., everyone puts
down their books, congregates in White Plaza and
blindly selects a partner for the night.
I fnim ... sounds a little cultish. Perhaps that's
why Communism doesn't work N We're not blind,
We're Facebook-obsessed. We can't put others
before ourselves, WeVe selfish, and we're all for
the liberty and pursuit of happiness-individual
happiness, that is. Not pity sex. Status is merit
based. and a good lay will always be preferred to
Boris or Natasha (even in her vinyl military boot,
lace teddy and bad teeth getup). So feel free to ex
periment. Try out a little Fascism (a.k.a. S&M
loving), a little Communism (after an embar

rassing hookup, just say that you diu it lor the
Motherland). Socialism (hell, invite your
friends), or m> with t>ood ol' Democracy

""C* Welcome back. Mr. Clinton ... care for
a cigar?").
They say politics makes for strange bed
fellows. Roxv says it makes for interesting

ones, especially if you find the right mixture of
short-term pleasure (equally shared by partners, of
course) and long-term satisfaction. Go red, (defi
nitely) go black — and just go'crazy.
