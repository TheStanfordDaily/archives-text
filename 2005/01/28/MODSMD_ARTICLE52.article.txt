### COMRADE TAM VO COMMUMISSION PARTY PREMIER 
"Get out! Last words are for fools who
haven't said enough."
With those final words, Karl Marx joined the
big Communist party in the sky.
Dearest Comrades, I fear that it has come
time for us to finally part. After our year of hard
toil in the Factories, Rice Paddies and Distil
leries, I do not have enough tears to equals
distribute among all 200 of you who may actu
ally read this publication. Instead, you may di
vide up the remains of three letters sent to A
me by Mssr. Registrar, in which the
Authorities threatened to remove me fromfl
party office. -«mJC
Four quarters later, I
your humble servant — they
silenced us! WE have silenced them!

From blasting The Daily Standards to
smithereens to challenging the ethics of Uggs
to championing the needs of the proletariat,
we have always remained The People's Inter
mission.
Let us remember the sacrifice of Comrade
Tom, Party secretary, who perished tragically
while abandoning ship. Without the manipula
tive skills of Comrade Victor, this clandestine
publication would suffer from disorgnization.
Without the visual propaganda of Comrade
Joseph, these pages would be used for toilet
paper. Without the aid of Comrade B. Marten,
our morale would have been lost long ago.
S?The People tolerate the Democratic Republic
of Oremus for allowing us to prevail.
MMpprTo an of those who have joined us in
movement, your brotherhood
/and solidarity have furthered the cause of the
\3tate. Remain strong, and never forget.


Armed and dangerous, the vanguard of the Commumission Revolution is at your doorstep
