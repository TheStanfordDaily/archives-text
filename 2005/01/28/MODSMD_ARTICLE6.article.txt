# Accelerator reopens

The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center has restarted one of the two
accelerator facilities that the center
shut down after an electrical fire
badly burned a technician last Octo
ber. The re-opened SPEAR 3 facility
went through SLAC's validation
process last week and is now operat
ing.
"Switching on SPEAR 3 is a long
and complex business," said Neil
Calder, the Director of Communica
tion at SLAC. "It's now ready to
start the scientific program."
SPEAR 3, a synchrotron light
source facility, is dedicated to the
study of the structure of matter at
the atomic and molecular scale.
Last December, the Department
of Energy, SLAC's principal source
of funding, reported that the Cen
ter's unsafe operating procedures
were directly responsible for the
Oct. 11 fire.

After the fire, SLAC and the De
partment of Energy launched a joint
investigation and formed a correc
tive action plan to address safety
concerns. SLAC Director Jonathan
Dorfan also appointed a validation
committee to review the corrective
action plan for each accelerator.
"We wanted to be absolutely sure
that everything was done with the
highest level of safety." said Calder.
The second accelerator facility. B
Factory, is still under review by the
DOE and SLAC and will remain
shut down indefinitely. Before the
fire, the B Factory housed SLAC's
major high-energy physics program,
which enabled scientists to investi
gate the matter-antimatter asymme
try in nature.
The fire occurred when a techni
cian tried to work on a 480-volt
power panel that had not been shut
off. The injured electrician, David
Simon, is suing SLAC for negli
gence.
