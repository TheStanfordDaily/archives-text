# Intruders trouble east campus
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In separate incidents this past weekend, two
intruders caused trouble in Stanford undergradu
ate dormitories, Stanford Police said yesterday.
Friday evening, a middle-aged man entered
Storey House and followed a female resident into
the women's bathroom. Resident Assistant
Ramit Sethi, a co-terminal student, called the po
lice. and the man was arrested shortly thereafter.
Late Saturday night, a different man, also de
scribed as being middle-aged, entered the room
of a Burbank resident and began touching her
while she slept, said Stanford Police Sgt. Richard
Shearer.
"A sexual battery did occur," Shearer said, but
he added, "the victim was fine."
"I think she yelled for him to leave, and her
roommate woke up." he said. "She said she was

going to call the RA, and he ran away."
The incident was not reported to the police
until the following afternoon, and no arrests have
been made.
When such an incident occurs. Shearer said,
residence staff should call the police immediate
ly. Shearer also recommended that students sleep
with their doors locked â€” the door to the vic
tim's room was unlocked at the time.
Shearer did not know how the suspect got into
Burbank. but he noted that residents often leave
doors propped open.
"On Friday and Saturday nights there's a lot of
people that come on campus looking for parties,"
Shearer said. "That's why it's important that at
the parties they ensure that everyone is a Stan
ford student. We get burglaries and thefts every
weekend from parties."
Intruders are less common, however. Shearer
said sexual assaults by people unknown to the

victims are quite rare on the Stanford campus.
In the wake of this weekend's events, Twain
Resident Fellow Arcadio Morales, who is also
residence dean for Governor's Corner, sent an e
mail to a Resident Fellow list describing the Bur
bank incident. The e-mail said the suspect was a
"30- to 40-year-old male, 5'5" to 5'6," with thin
dark hair, no facial hair or glasses, wearing a blue
and white thick striped shirt and carrying a dark
windbreaker jacket."
The e-mail's first sentence read, "Dear RAs,
CAs, RFs and CDs, Please urge your residents to
lock the doors to their rooms and to refrain from
propping house doors."
Word has not spread across campus yet. Sev
eral residents of Twain said they had heard noth
ing of the intruders, and Otero Resident Fellow
Jed Black said he hadn't been informed, either.
