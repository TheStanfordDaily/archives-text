# Intruders trouble east campus
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In separate incidents this past weekend, two
intruders caused trouble in Stanford undergradu
ate dormitories, Stanford Police said yesterday.
Friday evening, a middle-aged man entered
Storey House and followed a female resident into
the women's bathroom. Resident Assistant
Ramit Sethi, a co-terminal student, called the po
lice. and the man was arrested shortly thereafter.
Late Saturday night, a different man, also de
scribed as being middle-aged, entered the room
of a Burbank resident and began touching her
while she slept, said Stanford Police Sgt. Richard
Shearer.
"A sexual battery did occur," Shearer said, but
he added, "the victim was fine."
"I think she yelled for him to leave, and her
roommate woke up." he said. "She said she was

going to call the RA, and he ran away."
The incident was not reported to the police
until the following afternoon, and no arrests have
been made.
When such an incident occurs. Shearer said,
residence staff should call the police immediate
ly. Shearer also recommended that students sleep
with their doors locked — the door to the vic
tim's room was unlocked at the time.
Shearer did not know how the suspect got into
Burbank. but he noted that residents often leave
doors propped open.
"On Friday and Saturday nights there's a lot of
people that come on campus looking for parties,"
Shearer said. "That's why it's important that at
the parties they ensure that everyone is a Stan
ford student. We get burglaries and thefts every
weekend from parties."
Intruders are less common, however. Shearer
said sexual assaults by people unknown to the

victims are quite rare on the Stanford campus.
In the wake of this weekend's events, Twain
Resident Fellow Arcadio Morales, who is also
residence dean for Governor's Corner, sent an e
mail to a Resident Fellow list describing the Bur
bank incident. The e-mail said the suspect was a
"30- to 40-year-old male, 5'5" to 5'6," with thin
dark hair, no facial hair or glasses, wearing a blue
and white thick striped shirt and carrying a dark
windbreaker jacket."
The e-mail's first sentence read, "Dear RAs,
CAs, RFs and CDs, Please urge your residents to
lock the doors to their rooms and to refrain from
propping house doors."
Word has not spread across campus yet. Sev
eral residents of Twain said they had heard noth
ing of the intruders, and Otero Resident Fellow
Jed Black said he hadn't been informed, either.
If he knew of such incidents,
Black said, he would meet with
his staff and then inform the res
idents at a house meeting. He
said he always talks to students
in the fall about security issues,
but he added, "we do become
complacent."
"it's a campus where you've
got mostly really good people and
honest people, and everybody ex
pects that everybody else will be
the same way," Black said.
Heather Backman, a sopho
more who lives in Twain, next
door to Burbank in Stern Hall,
said she probably wouldn't ap
proach an adult wandering the
halls of her dorm.
"If they're in their 30s or 40s. I
assume they're someone's par
ents," she said. "I think if someone
looks legitimately weird. I would
hope people would have the intel
ligence not to let them in."
But Backman said she has
never seen such suspicious char

acters in her dorm.
The Storey resident who was
followed into the bathroom by
an intruder on Friday — who
asked not to be named — said
no one questioned the man at
first because he was wearing a
sweatshirt that said "Stanford
faculty club."
She said that as she was walk
ing upstairs in her towel to take a
shower, the man "kept glancing
sideways at me." and when she
went into the bathroom and into a
stall, he followed her.
"I hear him come in.and he
first looks into the shower stalls.
Then he starts looking into the
bathroom stalls, and he sees me
and says 'Excuse me!' and pro
ceeds to leave."
The student said it happened
too fast for her to panic, but that
she was certainly "taken aback."
She came out of the bathroom and
asked the man what he was doing,
and he said he was looking for the

East campus intruders
frighten female residents

men's bathroom. It was then that
she told Sethi about the man. and
he called police.
The student later identified the
man at the police station. She said
she decided to press charges when
police told her that a conviction
could send a strong message not
only to the man but to the com
munity at large.
Though she was a bit shaken by
the incident, she said that as long
as residents take better precau
tions in the future she isn't con
cerned that something similar will
happen again.
"I still think it's a pretty safe
campus," she said. "I think this
was just an exception, but you just
have to be careful."
Senior Marie Kobler, a Storey
resident, said at least one thing
has changed since Sethi e-mailed
the house to inform the residents
about the intruder:
"We didn't lock the door last
week, and we locked it this week."
