On Jan. 31,1955, The Daily published
a story about the controversial mischief of
fraternity pledges, with allegations of
rock-throwing from police reports.
Below is an excerpt:
"At 1:30 a.m., Chief Gordon Davis re
ported that the Stanford University po
lice detained four pledges of the fraterni
ty Alpha Delt for allegedly throwing
rocks at the second-story windows of
Hurlburt House.
"The Alpha Delt president. Sam Reg
ister, denied the allegation that 'the
pledges were throwing the rocks under
instructions from the pledge committee
of the Alpha Delt house.'
"Yet, 'a similar incident occurred at
Hurlburt at the same hour early Thursday
morning,' the Daily reported. 'The
pledges admitted they knew of the previ
ous activity but denied they took part.'
"In response to the tainted reputation
the pledges have acquired for Alpha Delt,
the fraternity sent Hurlburt House flow
ers for retribution. The Daily reported.
'Hurlburt is now prominently displaying
flowers sent by the Alpha Delts following
the disturbances. Both the pledges and
the Alpha Delt house face possible action
as investigation is being continued by po
lice.' "
On Jan. 31,1972, The Daily ran a story in
the midst of the feminist movement about
the different perspectives and assumed
roles of Stanford beauty pageant queens.
Here is an excerpt:

"Women's Liberationists attack beau
ty pageants because they legitimize
checking out a girl on a strictly physical
level. 'You can find that anywhere,' Ann
Hayaski, Miss San Joaquin County 1970,
contends, 'in modeling, commercials,
cheerleading...that is how society is
structured.' She says entrants in the Miss
America preliminaries are true represen
tatives of the current generation of
American women. They are proof that
women are not subservient, harried
blonde types.
"Similar to the view of Hayaski, Jack
ie Benington, America's Junior Miss
1969, explains that she "views straight
'beauty' pageants as "useless and degrad
ing' and contends that she would not be
so presumptuous as to enter one." The
Junior Miss title that Benington held re
quired that the winners were not only
beautiful, but were well-rounded. Ben
ington states that she entered the Junior
Miss pageant 'for the large scholarship.'
"However, some pageant contestants
enjoy the flattery and attention due to
their title as a beauty queens.
"Miss Santa Cruz 1969, Jill Kostenko,
contends that she is 'pleased and proud'
that she went out for pageants. Admit
ting that 'I've never lacked a boyfriend
once they find out I was a beauty queen,'
Jill even goes so far as to say that 'guys
will brag about me being a queen.' "
