# Playing it Straight
## Hot Banquet Action 
### 
Well, this week the two of us found
ourselves fortunate enough to attend
the Stanford Daily banquet. Wow.
What a night.
First of all, we didn't get officially in
vited. Apparently they don't appreci
ate features columnists at The Daily.
But thankfully, our all-star Dev-baller
features editor. Devon Maylie, hooked
us up with an under-the-radar invite.
Free Compadre's dinner and an
open bar on the Daily's tab, followed by
a rousing round of awards mediated by
the one-and-only Editor in Chief Will
Renfrew Oremus? We'd be fools to
refuse such an offer.
Sixty minutes or so into our night...
our editor is throwing down strawberry
daiquiris like Lebron James, Will is well

on his way to
cloud nine and
we're not doing
too badly our
selves. The ad
vertising guys at
the table next to
us arc doing
their best to de
stroy the $750
bar tab limit
and our waiter
is trying to talk
people into vir
gin drinks for
some reason or
another.
Needless to

say, he failed like Nick Nolte on a so
briety test.
The night took a turn for the worse
when we were told that we weren't
going to get paid for all the columns
we've written. A poor show from The
Daily, indeed. And that's the real prob
lem, isn't it? The Daily is poor. Boozing
and carousing are higher on the priori
ty list than paying columnists, which is
arguably fair. As far as we know, our
words are yet to get anyone happy
drunk.
In fact, we never really knew what
our words were supposed to do. To tell
you the truth, we applied for the col
umn posing as writers who would speak
to lifestyle choices from a metrosexual
perspective.
After writing our interior decorating
and Food Network pieces, that theme
degenerated pretty quickly into draw
inspiration-from-degenerate-celebri-
ties Dear Abby pieces with our job
hunting and midterm articles. The post-
Big Game melee was a completely dif
ferent animal — literally! (Bears and
Goose!) Where's the theme now?
Probably gone like our sobriety at the
banquet.
Regardless, the real fun started after
dinner. The Chappie jokesters decked
The Daily office out in good fashion,
sporting an inflatable turkey as a nice
centerpiece on the booze table. Will
promptly started dishing out awards
like whoa and new head editor demon
strated how the shot-per-award system
works, eventually telling everyone
about how the Romans used to have
these rooms called vomitoriums (we
use the verb "telling" loosely).
The crowning moment of the night
had to be when the Chappie gave out its
awards. We're proud to say that we
were awarded "Best" and also given
honorable mention for "Worst." So
suck on that, lolli-poseur-pops. You
wish that you could write garbage as
badly as we do.
Anyway, the point of all this, as sad
as it may be. is that this is our final col
umn. The last hurrah. The icing on the
cake. The calm before the storm.
We've had a great time writing this
weekly piece, but we're sick of it, and
we're not going to do it anymore. Espe
cially now that they've told us we're not
getting paid. Surely our successors will
have a better sense of (literary) style
and a greater command of the English
diction than us, but they probably won't
know anything about cooking, John
Stamos. using parentheses (way) too
much or why Berkeley is so damn cool.
And that's exactly why you won't
miss us. They're going to start writing
about interesting things.
In some ways, our columns have
been a little like life — you never know
were it's going, but as long as you've
been able to laugh along the way,
you've won. We've won. Our prize?
Nine margaritas, four beers and a re
newed lack of respect from friends,
family and colleagues. Take care of
yourselves.

another.
Needless to

say, he failed like Nick Nolte on a so
briety test.
The night took a turn for the worse
when we were told that we weren't
going to get paid for all the columns
we've written. A poor show from The
Daily, indeed. And that's the real prob
lem, isn't it? The Daily is poor. Boozing
and carousing are higher on the priori
ty list than paying columnists, which is
arguably fair. As far as we know, our
words are yet to get anyone happy
drunk.
In fact, we never really knew what
our words were supposed to do. To tell
you the truth, we applied for the col
umn posing as writers who would speak
to lifestyle choices from a metrosexual
perspective.
After writing our interior decorating
and Food Network pieces, that theme
degenerated pretty quickly into draw
inspiration-from-degenerate-celebri-
ties Dear Abby pieces with our job
hunting and midterm articles. The post-
Big Game melee was a completely dif
ferent animal — literally! (Bears and
Goose!) Where's the theme now?
Probably gone like our sobriety at the
banquet.
Regardless, the real fun started after
dinner. The Chappie jokesters decked
The Daily office out in good fashion,
sporting an inflatable turkey as a nice
centerpiece on the booze table. Will
promptly started dishing out awards
like whoa and new head editor demon
strated how the shot-per-award system
works, eventually telling everyone
about how the Romans used to have
these rooms called vomitoriums (we
use the verb "telling" loosely).
The crowning moment of the night
had to be when the Chappie gave out its
awards. We're proud to say that we
were awarded "Best" and also given
honorable mention for "Worst." So
suck on that, lolli-poseur-pops. You
wish that you could write garbage as
badly as we do.
Anyway, the point of all this, as sad
as it may be. is that this is our final col
umn. The last hurrah. The icing on the
cake. The calm before the storm.
We've had a great time writing this
weekly piece, but we're sick of it, and
we're not going to do it anymore. Espe
cially now that they've told us we're not
getting paid. Surely our successors will
have a better sense of (literary) style
and a greater command of the English
diction than us, but they probably won't
know anything about cooking, John
Stamos. using parentheses (way) too
much or why Berkeley is so damn cool.
And that's exactly why you won't
miss us. They're going to start writing
about interesting things.
In some ways, our columns have
been a little like life — you never know
were it's going, but as long as you've
been able to laugh along the way,
you've won. We've won. Our prize?
Nine margaritas, four beers and a re
newed lack of respect from friends,
family and colleagues. Take care of
yourselves.

Well, this week the two of us found
ourselves fortunate enough to attend
the Stanford Daily banquet. Wow.
What a night.
First of all, we didn't get officially in
vited. Apparently they don't appreci
ate features columnists at The Daily.
But thankfully, our all-star Dev-baller
features editor. Devon Maylie, hooked
us up with an under-the-radar invite.
Free Compadre's dinner and an
open bar on the Daily's tab, followed by
a rousing round of awards mediated by
the one-and-only Editor in Chief Will
Renfrew Oremus? We'd be fools to
refuse such an offer.
Sixty minutes or so into our night...
our editor is throwing down strawberry
daiquiris like Lebron James, Will is well

on his way to
cloud nine and
we're not doing
too badly our
selves. The ad
vertising guys at
the table next to
us arc doing
their best to de
stroy the $750
bar tab limit
and our waiter
is trying to talk
people into vir
gin drinks for
some reason or
another.
Needless to

say, he failed like Nick Nolte on a so
briety test.
The night took a turn for the worse
when we were told that we weren't
