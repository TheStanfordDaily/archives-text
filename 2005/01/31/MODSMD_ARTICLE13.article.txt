# Haitian priest calls action, solidarity on behalf of political prisoners
## 
### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD 
On Oct. 13, 2004, Father Gerard Jean-
Juste was helping to serve meals to over 600
children in his food program in St. Claire
Church, Haiti. Hooded, armed men soon
surrounded the parish and arrested the 58-
year old priest.
In response, the children began to sing
the "Our Father" prayer and other spiritu
als, but they were silenced and forced to lie
face down. Meanwhile, Jean-Juste was beat
en and taken to the National Penitentiary as
three children were shot and wounded.
Jean-Juste was not released from prison
until Nov. 29, after significant pressure from
activists around the world. Like many polit
ical prisoners in Haitian jails today, Jean-
Juste was neither charged nor convicted of
any crime during his imprisonment. He
spoke at Stanford's Braun Auditorium on
Friday to raise awareness about his experi
ence and the current state of politics and
human rights in Haiti.
Over 100 people attended the event to
hear him speak about his native Caribbean
country, which is home to almost nine mil
lion people, with the majority of people liv
ing on about $1 a day.
In his talk, Jean-Juste drew on his 26
years in exile in the United States under the
Duvalier regimes and his advocacy for
Haitian refugees in the United States. He
said his activism is also strongly inspired by
his roots in the Haitian church and libera
tion theology, much like ousted Haitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Aristide was forced to leave Haiti on
Feb. 29, 2004 following a three-week rebel
lion that resulted in a coup. He has now set
tled in South Africa, and is teaching at the
University of South Africa in Pretroria.
Since Aristide's departure, Jean-Juste has
received death threats because of his calls
for Aristide's return.
In fact, Jean-Juste narrowly escaped
death during his time in jail. He began his
speech with a poetic rhythm much like that
of a sermon as he thanked the audience and
all activists.
"Thanks for the great job many of you
have done, for me personally, during my 48
days in jail from Oct. 13 to Nov. 29." he said.
"All of you involved have saved me, and
that's why God has his reasons to bring me
here tonight. God has brought me here to
talk with you face to face, because right after
I left jail, a big massacre took place at the
penitentiary national."
Jean-Juste referred to a riot that broke

out among prisoners in a three-story cell
block called "The Titanic" on Dec. 1. In re
sponse, a special police unit was brought in
to quell the uproar. According to the gov
ernment's official record, fewer than a
dozen were killed and over 40 prisoners
were wounded, though estimates from pris
oners themselves and human rights organi
zations reach over 100 dead.
Controversy and violence have sur
rounded politics in Haiti since the crisis last
year. The country is ruled by an interim gov
ernment led by Gerard Latortue, though
Jean-Juste insists that Aristide should still
be recognized as Haiti's legitimate and
democratically elected president.
Amnesty International has denounced
arbitrary arrests, illegal detentions and sum
mary executions that witnesses say have
been carried out by the national police. A
U.N. police force of about 6,700, which took
over from a U.S. peacekeeping force in
June, has been unable to stop the violence in
the poorest slums of Port-au-Prince, the na
tion's capital.
Jean-Juste summarized the violence that
has surrounded the political process in Haiti
over the past two decades, and pointed a fin
ger at U.S. involvement in last year's coup.
He asked the audience to reflect on the
United States, the U.S. government and its
role in Haiti.
"Are Haitians Americans or not?" he

asked. "We are American, part of the conti
nent called America. And many times,
when American officials are talking, they
say, 'Haiti is in our backyard.' I don't like
that, when they say 'backyard.' If we could
say, 'Haiti is part of the continent where all
of us are living together,' I would appreciate
that better."
The event was organized by Biological
Sciences Ph.D. candidate Sasha Kramer and
sponsored by the Office for Religious Life,
the Division of General Surgery, the Stan
ford School of Medicine, the African and
African-American Studies Program and the
Program in Ethics in Society. In addition, it
was endorsed by Amnesty International,
the Haiti Action Committee and several
South Bay organizations.
"One thing that was incredible was that
this event was one of the only ones I've seen
at Stanford that has been such a great mix of
Stanford students, various departments and
community members," Kramer said. "Jean-
Juste was able to speak in a language that all
of those groups could understand and re
spond to."
Kramer traveled to Haiti in August and
in December on human rights delegations
and screened a slideshow of photos docu
menting the rallies in support of Aristide in
Cap Haitian, Haiti.
"It was something I've always wanted to
do ... to be an international human rights

observer, but I never knew what qualifica
tions I needed But I found that you
don't need any qualifications but an open
heart and a willingness to bear witness ...
and that can make a tremendous differ
ence," she said.
Kramer said she felt that Jean-Juste's
speech provided students with an example
of pro-active solidarity effecting change.
"I think that people should really come
away with a feeling of empowerment be
cause it was the fact that people all over the
world responded that got him out of
prison," she said. "He was talking about so
many sad things but he still had hope, and
believed that hope could really make differ
ence."
In bringing this event to campus,
Kramer's objectives included exposing the
situation in Haiti to the Stanford communi
ty and encouraging individuals to speak out.
"Pressure your representatives ... and
get other Congress people to pressure the
Haitian government to release the political
prisoners," she urged.
Just as Jean-Juste met with Aristide in
South Africa earlier this month and brought
Aristide's message of hope for resisters to
Stanford, he promoted initiative among
Stanford students with a message from the
Haitian people: "Wake up and see what is
happening in Haiti!"
Jean-Juste's call to action struck a reso
nant with many of the students who attend
ed Friday night's event.
"To me. Father Jean-Juste's talk was a
reminder â€” a reminder that as Stanford
students, we are a privileged elite," said
sophomore Salvador Perez. "As such, we
have an undeniable responsibility to act
against injustice around the world. A pas
sive, indolent life for us would be an unfor
givable indulgence. Especially profound
was the Father's call for American unity on
a continental scale .... The world cannot
afford our provincial, casual indifference."
Freshman Peter Porcino, a member of
Stanford's Moving Mountains: Stanford
Students for Haiti, agreed. "I found him to
be a well-spoken, refreshing breath of reali
ty on campus." Members of the Haiti stu
dent group were inspired by the talk to
begin a letter-writing campaign to free other
political prisoners like Jean-Juste in Haiti.
While Jean-Juste said he thanks God
every day for his freedom, and he said the
fight for liberation is far from over. "As I
like to say, 'one free, 700 more to go,"' he
said.

human rights in Haiti.
Over 100 people attended the event to
hear him speak about his native Caribbean
country, which is home to almost nine mil
lion people, with the majority of people liv
ing on about $1 a day.
In his talk, Jean-Juste drew on his 26
years in exile in the United States under the
Duvalier regimes and his advocacy for
Haitian refugees in the United States. He
said his activism is also strongly inspired by
his roots in the Haitian church and libera
tion theology, much like ousted Haitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Aristide was forced to leave Haiti on
Feb. 29, 2004 following a three-week rebel
lion that resulted in a coup. He has now set
tled in South Africa, and is teaching at the
University of South Africa in Pretroria.
Since Aristide's departure, Jean-Juste has
received death threats because of his calls
for Aristide's return.
In fact, Jean-Juste narrowly escaped
death during his time in jail. He began his
speech with a poetic rhythm much like that
of a sermon as he thanked the audience and
all activists.
"Thanks for the great job many of you
have done, for me personally, during my 48
days in jail from Oct. 13 to Nov. 29." he said.
"All of you involved have saved me, and
that's why God has his reasons to bring me
here tonight. God has brought me here to
talk with you face to face, because right after
I left jail, a big massacre took place at the
penitentiary national."
Jean-Juste referred to a riot that broke

out among prisoners in a three-story cell
block called "The Titanic" on Dec. 1. In re
sponse, a special police unit was brought in
to quell the uproar. According to the gov
ernment's official record, fewer than a
dozen were killed and over 40 prisoners
were wounded, though estimates from pris
oners themselves and human rights organi
zations reach over 100 dead.
Controversy and violence have sur
rounded politics in Haiti since the crisis last
year. The country is ruled by an interim gov
ernment led by Gerard Latortue, though
Jean-Juste insists that Aristide should still
be recognized as Haiti's legitimate and
democratically elected president.
Amnesty International has denounced
arbitrary arrests, illegal detentions and sum
mary executions that witnesses say have
been carried out by the national police. A
U.N. police force of about 6,700, which took
over from a U.S. peacekeeping force in
June, has been unable to stop the violence in
the poorest slums of Port-au-Prince, the na
tion's capital.
Jean-Juste summarized the violence that
has surrounded the political process in Haiti
over the past two decades, and pointed a fin
ger at U.S. involvement in last year's coup.
He asked the audience to reflect on the
United States, the U.S. government and its
role in Haiti.
"Are Haitians Americans or not?" he

asked. "We are American, part of the conti
nent called America. And many times,
when American officials are talking, they
say, 'Haiti is in our backyard.' I don't like
that, when they say 'backyard.' If we could
say, 'Haiti is part of the continent where all
of us are living together,' I would appreciate
that better."
The event was organized by Biological
Sciences Ph.D. candidate Sasha Kramer and
sponsored by the Office for Religious Life,
the Division of General Surgery, the Stan
ford School of Medicine, the African and
African-American Studies Program and the
Program in Ethics in Society. In addition, it
was endorsed by Amnesty International,
the Haiti Action Committee and several
South Bay organizations.
"One thing that was incredible was that
this event was one of the only ones I've seen
at Stanford that has been such a great mix of
Stanford students, various departments and
community members," Kramer said. "Jean-
Juste was able to speak in a language that all
of those groups could understand and re
spond to."
Kramer traveled to Haiti in August and
in December on human rights delegations
and screened a slideshow of photos docu
menting the rallies in support of Aristide in
Cap Haitian, Haiti.
"It was something I've always wanted to
do ... to be an international human rights

observer, but I never knew what qualifica
tions I needed But I found that you
don't need any qualifications but an open
heart and a willingness to bear witness ...
and that can make a tremendous differ
ence," she said.
Kramer said she felt that Jean-Juste's
speech provided students with an example
of pro-active solidarity effecting change.
"I think that people should really come
away with a feeling of empowerment be
cause it was the fact that people all over the
world responded that got him out of
prison," she said. "He was talking about so
many sad things but he still had hope, and
believed that hope could really make differ
ence."
In bringing this event to campus,
Kramer's objectives included exposing the
situation in Haiti to the Stanford communi
ty and encouraging individuals to speak out.
"Pressure your representatives ... and
get other Congress people to pressure the
Haitian government to release the political
prisoners," she urged.
Just as Jean-Juste met with Aristide in
South Africa earlier this month and brought
Aristide's message of hope for resisters to
Stanford, he promoted initiative among
Stanford students with a message from the
Haitian people: "Wake up and see what is
happening in Haiti!"
Jean-Juste's call to action struck a reso
nant with many of the students who attend
ed Friday night's event.
"To me. Father Jean-Juste's talk was a
reminder â€” a reminder that as Stanford
students, we are a privileged elite," said
sophomore Salvador Perez. "As such, we
have an undeniable responsibility to act
against injustice around the world. A pas
sive, indolent life for us would be an unfor
givable indulgence. Especially profound
was the Father's call for American unity on
a continental scale .... The world cannot
afford our provincial, casual indifference."
Freshman Peter Porcino, a member of
Stanford's Moving Mountains: Stanford
Students for Haiti, agreed. "I found him to
be a well-spoken, refreshing breath of reali
ty on campus." Members of the Haiti stu
dent group were inspired by the talk to
begin a letter-writing campaign to free other
political prisoners like Jean-Juste in Haiti.
While Jean-Juste said he thanks God
every day for his freedom, and he said the
fight for liberation is far from over. "As I
like to say, 'one free, 700 more to go,"' he
said.

Father Gerard Jean-Juste speaks to the Stanford community about injustices occurring in Haiti.
On Oct. 13, 2004, Father Gerard Jean-
Juste was helping to serve meals to over 600
children in his food program in St. Claire
Church, Haiti. Hooded, armed men soon
surrounded the parish and arrested the 58-
year old priest.
In response, the children began to sing
the "Our Father" prayer and other spiritu
als, but they were silenced and forced to lie
face down. Meanwhile, Jean-Juste was beat
en and taken to the National Penitentiary as
three children were shot and wounded.
Jean-Juste was not released from prison
until Nov. 29, after significant pressure from
activists around the world. Like many polit
ical prisoners in Haitian jails today, Jean-
Juste was neither charged nor convicted of
any crime during his imprisonment. He

In fact, Jean-Juste narrowly escaped
death during his time in jail. He began his
speech with a poetic rhythm much like that
of a sermon as he thanked the audience and
all activists.
"Thanks for the great job many of you
have done, for me personally, during my 48
days in jail from Oct. 13 to Nov. 29." he said.
"All of you involved have saved me, and
that's why God has his reasons to bring me
here tonight. God has brought me here to
talk with you face to face, because right after
I left jail, a big massacre took place at the
penitentiary national."
Jean-Juste referred to a riot that broke

out among prisoners in a three-story cell
block called "The Titanic" on Dec. 1. In re
sponse, a special police unit was brought in
to quell the uproar. According to the gov
ernment's official record, fewer than a
dozen were killed and over 40 prisoners
were wounded, though estimates from pris
oners themselves and human rights organi
zations reach over 100 dead.
Controversy and violence have sur
rounded politics in Haiti since the crisis last
year. The country is ruled by an interim gov
ernment led by Gerard Latortue, though
Jean-Juste insists that Aristide should still
be recognized as Haiti's legitimate and
democratically elected president.
Amnesty International has denounced
arbitrary arrests, illegal detentions and sum
mary executions that witnesses say have
been carried out by the national police. A
U.N. police force of about 6,700, which took
over from a U.S. peacekeeping force in
June, has been unable to stop the violence in
the poorest slums of Port-au-Prince, the na
tion's capital.
Jean-Juste summarized the violence that
has surrounded the political process in Haiti
over the past two decades, and pointed a fin
ger at U.S. involvement in last year's coup.
He asked the audience to reflect on the
United States, the U.S. government and its
role in Haiti.
"Are Haitians Americans or not?" he

asked. "We are American, part of the conti
nent called America. And many times,
when American officials are talking, they
say, 'Haiti is in our backyard.' I don't like
that, when they say 'backyard.' If we could
say, 'Haiti is part of the continent where all
of us are living together,' I would appreciate
that better."
The event was organized by Biological
Sciences Ph.D. candidate Sasha Kramer and
sponsored by the Office for Religious Life,
the Division of General Surgery, the Stan
ford School of Medicine, the African and
African-American Studies Program and the
Program in Ethics in Society. In addition, it
was endorsed by Amnesty International,
the Haiti Action Committee and several
South Bay organizations.
"One thing that was incredible was that
this event was one of the only ones I've seen
at Stanford that has been such a great mix of
Stanford students, various departments and
community members," Kramer said. "Jean-
Juste was able to speak in a language that all
of those groups could understand and re
spond to."
Kramer traveled to Haiti in August and
in December on human rights delegations
and screened a slideshow of photos docu
menting the rallies in support of Aristide in
Cap Haitian, Haiti.
"It was something I've always wanted to
do ... to be an international human rights

observer, but I never knew what qualifica
tions I needed But I found that you
don't need any qualifications but an open
heart and a willingness to bear witness ...
and that can make a tremendous differ
ence," she said.
Kramer said she felt that Jean-Juste's
speech provided students with an example
of pro-active solidarity effecting change.
"I think that people should really come
away with a feeling of empowerment be
cause it was the fact that people all over the
world responded that got him out of
prison," she said. "He was talking about so
many sad things but he still had hope, and
believed that hope could really make differ
ence."
In bringing this event to campus,
Kramer's objectives included exposing the
situation in Haiti to the Stanford communi
ty and encouraging individuals to speak out.
"Pressure your representatives ... and
get other Congress people to pressure the
Haitian government to release the political
prisoners," she urged.
Just as Jean-Juste met with Aristide in
South Africa earlier this month and brought
Aristide's message of hope for resisters to
Stanford, he promoted initiative among
Stanford students with a message from the
Haitian people: "Wake up and see what is
happening in Haiti!"
Jean-Juste's call to action struck a reso
nant with many of the students who attend
ed Friday night's event.
"To me. Father Jean-Juste's talk was a
reminder â€” a reminder that as Stanford
students, we are a privileged elite," said
sophomore Salvador Perez. "As such, we
have an undeniable responsibility to act
against injustice around the world. A pas
sive, indolent life for us would be an unfor
givable indulgence. Especially profound
was the Father's call for American unity on
a continental scale .... The world cannot
afford our provincial, casual indifference."
Freshman Peter Porcino, a member of
Stanford's Moving Mountains: Stanford
Students for Haiti, agreed. "I found him to
be a well-spoken, refreshing breath of reali
ty on campus." Members of the Haiti stu
dent group were inspired by the talk to
begin a letter-writing campaign to free other
political prisoners like Jean-Juste in Haiti.
While Jean-Juste said he thanks God
every day for his freedom, and he said the
fight for liberation is far from over. "As I
like to say, 'one free, 700 more to go,"' he
said.
