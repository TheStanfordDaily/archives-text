# Job fair targets tech students
## 
### VICTORIA DEGREGTA STAFF WRITER 
Engineering and science students
flocked to the Arrillaga Alumni Cen
ter this past Saturday for the annual
Opportunity Job Fair, hosted by the
Stanford School of Engineering.
Ninety companies ran recruiting
booths at the fair, including Mi
crosoft, Boeing and Volkswagen.
"The Opportunity Job Fair focus
es on introducing leading engineer
ing and science corporations to Stan
ford's engineering students," said ju
nior Nicole Quesada, one of the
fair's coordinators. "It was estab
lished as a means of integrating the
engineering student body with the
current technological field."
While the fair was open to all stu
dents, it was specifically geared to
ward racially and ethnically under
represented groups.
"The job fair's motivation is to
promote engineering opportunities
specifically targeting minority stu
dents," Quesada said. "It is unique in
that it advocates diversity within the
field of engineering."
According to junior Teena Red
horse, another fair coordinator, the
best way a student can prepare for
such an event is to research the com
panies in attandance
"There are a lot of very smart and
qualified people coming to this fair,"
said Jeff Burk, a recruiter for Mer

cury Interactive, a software-testing
company. "The student has to find
some way to stand out, make me feel
like he's interested in the company
and has done his research."
Adam Gersh of Malcolm Pirnie,
an environmental engineering firm,
recommended that students tailor
their resumes for specific fields or
companies.
"When a student targets his re
sume fora certain position or in
cludes my company's name in the re
sume it shows me that he's interested
in my company in particular." he
said.
Senior Tony Huie, an electrical
engineering major, said that he
makes a point of researching compa
nies before attending job fairs.
"I target my search to a few spe
cific companies and think of differ
ent ways to get them to remember
me," he said.
Senior Addison Shelton, a me
chanical engineering major, said that,
for him, the purpose of these fairs is
not so much to find out more about
companies, but to "schmooze" with
the recruiters.
Similarly, junior Allen Huang,
also an electrical engineering major,
said he went to the fair with the spe
cific intention of meeting new peo
ple and making solid network con
nections.
Many recruiters also emphasized
the importance of making a good

first impression.
"Having a degree from Stanford
and an impressive resume are good
calling cards." Burke said. "But in
the end. it really comes down to per
sonality."
Andy Noma, a recruiter for Visa,
concurred.
"The career fair serves as a mini
interview." he said. "We want the
next generation of creativity; people
who are inquisitive, cooperative and
have good communication skills."
Burked added that many people
look good on paper, but that acade
mic success is not the only re
quirment for new hires.
"We're looking for people who
are dynamic," Burke said. "You
can't be too introverted. You can't
lack aggressiveness, and you must
have good communication skills."
Both students and recruiters
seemed very positive about the fair
experience, Redhorse said.
"These fairs are really a hit or
miss," Huang said. "Sometimes you
make good connections and get a
call back right away and other times
nothing happens."
The fair was produced by volun
teers from the American Indian Sci
ence and Engineering Society, the
Stanford Society of Black Scientists
and Engineers, the Stanford Society
of Women Engineers and the Stan
ford Society of Chicano / Latino En
gineers and Scientists.

cific intention of meeting new peo
ple and making solid network con
nections.
Many recruiters also emphasized
the importance of making a good

first impression.
"Having a degree from Stanford
and an impressive resume are good
calling cards." Burke said. "But in
the end. it really comes down to per
sonality."
Andy Noma, a recruiter for Visa,
concurred.
"The career fair serves as a mini
interview." he said. "We want the
next generation of creativity; people
who are inquisitive, cooperative and
have good communication skills."
Burked added that many people
look good on paper, but that acade
mic success is not the only re
quirment for new hires.
"We're looking for people who
are dynamic," Burke said. "You
can't be too introverted. You can't
lack aggressiveness, and you must
have good communication skills."
Both students and recruiters
seemed very positive about the fair
experience, Redhorse said.
"These fairs are really a hit or
miss," Huang said. "Sometimes you
make good connections and get a
call back right away and other times
nothing happens."
The fair was produced by volun
teers from the American Indian Sci
ence and Engineering Society, the
Stanford Society of Black Scientists
and Engineers, the Stanford Society
of Women Engineers and the Stan
ford Society of Chicano / Latino En
gineers and Scientists.
