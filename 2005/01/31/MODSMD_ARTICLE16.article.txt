## Editor's Note Our responsibility to you 
### 
The first time I came across someone who had list
ed his phone number on hisThefacebook.com profile,
I thought, "That's crazy. I'd never do that. It's bad
enough that I get random e-mails." I take that back. I
thank all of you who have listed your phone numbers
on Thefacebook.com for making my life easier. Daily
editors use Thefacebook.com to track down writers
and sources; on any given night at the Daily office,
you're bound to hear the term "facebook her" at least
three times.
So I now return the favor. My cell phone number is
(650) 906-0380. I'm not joking. I dare you to call me
right now. Now it's your turn to think I'm crazy.
You're probably thinking, "Did she just give her cell
phone number out to 10,(MX) people?" Yes, and I'll tell
you why. I am that serious about wanting to hear from
you. Daily readers, about how this newspaper can
serve you better.
(OK. you should first try me at the office: (650)
725-2100, ext. 501. Or e-mail me at eic@daily.stan
ford.edu.)
As editor in chief of The Daily, my promise to you
is to listen and respond to your concerns and sugges
tions. I admit that 1 am not the first editor in chief to
set this kind of goal. But I think that The Daily is bet
ter prepared to rise and meet that challenge now.
Why? Because we, as an organization, are growing.
As managing editor of news and features last volume,
I was most proud of having recruited and, more im
portantly, retained more than 40 new writers. At the
beginning of the school year, we suffered from a
shortage of reporters. In the Orientation issue of The
Daily, for example, all but one front-page story was
written by an editor.
That's changed now — on my last day as managing
editor, there were at least 10 people who were still
waiting for their first assignments. But that doesn't
mean we're going to stop recruiting new writers now.
On a campus with more than 500 student organiza-

tions, students have to pick and choose carefully what
to do with their time. II you enjoy writing, taking pho
tos or designing graphics, choose The Daily.
Some of our newest staffers were editors in chief of
their high school papers, and some had no journalism
experience. Some took photos or designed pages for
their high school yearbooks, and others are just start
ing to learn. Whatever your background, our editing
staff is ready, willing and excited to work with you.
If The Daily has so many new staffers, why would
we want more, you ask? That brings me back to what
1 wrote three paragraphs ago. We are growing and we
need to continue to grow. ()n a campus as big and live
ly as ours, it is impossible for The Daily to cover every
event and issue. But doesn't it make sense that if we
have more reporters and photographers, we can ex
pand our coverage? Certainly.
But if you don't have time to work with us this
quarter, 1 ask that you continue to read and keep in
mind that, as a daily newspaper. The Daily's main re
sponsibility is to reflect and address issues that are im
portant and relevant to our readers — that's you. St)
the next time you're reading The Daily in your dorm
room, in the dining hall, in front of Moonbean's (you
can find The Daily in nearly 250 locations on campus),
and you're wondering, "Why didn't The Daily cover
?" tell us. Call it constructive criticism.
I look forward to hearing from you. Welcome to
volume 227 of The Daily.

phone number out to 10,(MX) people?" Yes, and I'll tell
you why. I am that serious about wanting to hear from
you. Daily readers, about how this newspaper can
serve you better.
(OK. you should first try me at the office: (650)
725-2100, ext. 501. Or e-mail me at eic@daily.stan

As editor in chief of The Daily, my promise to you
is to listen and respond to your concerns and sugges
tions. I admit that 1 am not the first editor in chief to
set this kind of goal. But I think that The Daily is bet
ter prepared to rise and meet that challenge now.
Why? Because we, as an organization, are growing.
As managing editor of news and features last volume,
I was most proud of having recruited and, more im
portantly, retained more than 40 new writers. At the
beginning of the school year, we suffered from a
shortage of reporters. In the Orientation issue of The
Daily, for example, all but one front-page story was
written by an editor.
That's changed now — on my last day as managing
editor, there were at least 10 people who were still
waiting for their first assignments. But that doesn't
mean we're going to stop recruiting new writers now.
On a campus with more than 500 student organiza-

tions, students have to pick and choose carefully what
to do with their time. II you enjoy writing, taking pho
tos or designing graphics, choose The Daily.
Some of our newest staffers were editors in chief of
their high school papers, and some had no journalism
experience. Some took photos or designed pages for
their high school yearbooks, and others are just start
ing to learn. Whatever your background, our editing
staff is ready, willing and excited to work with you.
If The Daily has so many new staffers, why would
we want more, you ask? That brings me back to what
1 wrote three paragraphs ago. We are growing and we
need to continue to grow. ()n a campus as big and live
ly as ours, it is impossible for The Daily to cover every
event and issue. But doesn't it make sense that if we
have more reporters and photographers, we can ex
pand our coverage? Certainly.
But if you don't have time to work with us this
quarter, 1 ask that you continue to read and keep in
mind that, as a daily newspaper. The Daily's main re
sponsibility is to reflect and address issues that are im
portant and relevant to our readers — that's you. St)
the next time you're reading The Daily in your dorm
room, in the dining hall, in front of Moonbean's (you
can find The Daily in nearly 250 locations on campus),
and you're wondering, "Why didn't The Daily cover
?" tell us. Call it constructive criticism.
I look forward to hearing from you. Welcome to
volume 227 of The Daily.

Cynthia H. Cho
Editor in Chief, Vol. 227
