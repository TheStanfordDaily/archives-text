## One ‘fag' wonders — have we failed to make homophobia unacceptable? 
### DAVID LOUK 
Nigger. Raghead. Chink. Kike.
These are words you probably
aren't used to hearing too often —
and with good reason. They're unac
ceptable forms of bigotry and racism.
But what about the word "fag
got"? A recent conversation among
friends reminded me that the word,
and a generalized acceptance of ho
mophobia, is still alive and well,
even on an enlightened liberal col
lege campus. When my friend said
the word, (we'll say my friend is a
she) she used it to describe a sketchy
guy at a party, and it had nothing to
do with his sexual preference.
It's bad enough that she said it
(and if she said it in front of me,
someone who is gay, my guess is that
she uses it more frequently in other
company). What's worse is the fact
that I wasn't shocked. I wasn't of
fended. 1 didn't say a word about the
comment. Not until afterward, when
another friend went on a tirade
about the fact that she would use
such a word, did it begin to dawn on
me how much our society tolerates
homophobia.

Maybe it's because I've heard "fag
got" used so many times before.
Maybe it's because I hear every
thing from cars to homework assign
ments to bad luck at cards described
as "gay". Whatever the reason,
other than a general uneasiness with
how uncomfortable the conversa
tion had become, I wasn't a bit
phased by her utterance of "the
other f-word."
And that saddens me. 1 have qui
etly adopted this sort of second-class
status, where bigoted language is ac
ceptable and, to quote "Star Trek",
resistance is futile. Part of the blame
rests on my shoulders — I should be
the first line of defense against intol
erance, and I should have immedi
ately said something. Yet I am so
used to hearing homophobic com
ments that I've internalized them as
tolerable, if not standard. I didn't
even raise an eyebrow.
How has our society normalized
such comments, and what do we do
to make them socially unaccept
able? 1 honestly don't know. Seeing
FACES during freshman orienta
tion. having dorm discussions about
racism, homophobia, sexism, etc..

and even having "fag" friends didn't
work to make my friend understand
that such language is unacceptable
and hurtful.
Where have we failed? Where
have I failed? If my friend had said
then-word. I would have been up in
arms about how offensive it was.
Why I did I not even question big
otry directed at me? And if I don't
blink an eye at it. what about the
people out there who really are in
tolerant? Apart from our happy
bubble called Stanford. I can only
hope that as our society progresses,
everyone — myself included — is
more aware of the effect words can
have on each other and on ourselves.
My friend eventually apologized
and said that she should not have
been so flippant. 1 accepted the
apology. What I have yet to accept is
a society that has coerced me — a
strong, intelligent and socially-con
scious "fag" — into thinking that
such language, although harmful, is
acceptable.
