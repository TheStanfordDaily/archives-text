# Smoke and Mirrors Aside...
## No way to adequately repay our armed forces 
### 
Last year a Stanford law student
named Mike Zummer wrote an e
mail to his classmates explaining
why he was departing to serve in

Iraq. A former
Marine and FBI
agent, Zummer
wrote: "When
Marines are
fighting, it is a fel
low Marine's
duty to help
them. That is our
ethos. I couldn't
stay protected

while my Marines were doing their
duty. Our country will survive with
one less lawyer, but we need as many
Marines as we can get. Especially
now. Semper Fidelis."
I never felt comfortable talking
about the sacrifices and courage of
Americans like Zummer. It felt too
easy, like I had no place to talk as a
bystander. How could I justly ac
knowledge their contributions
when 1 have no idea what it's like to
fight in a war zone with a target on
your back?
There are many things I could
write about for my last column, but
I am selfish for choosing to end on
this one. I am constantly asking my
self if my motivation for writing this
is to somehow placate some of my
own feelings of guilt. They serve, I
don't. That doesn't mean I can't do
good things in my life. But it means
I'm choosing to let fellow Ameri
cans risk their lives while I stay on
the sidelines.
It takes discipline, principle, ide
alism, courage and strength of mind
to serve. It surely takes a lot more
things, but we don't really know ev
erything our troops go through.
We don't know just how asym
metrical warfare can be when fight
ing terrorists. These insurgents
have forced women and children
into cars, set them on fire, waited
until U.S. soldiers came to the res
cue and then blown up roadside
bombs to kill them. Yet we don't
have to think about this.
We also don't have to think
about how many hours of training
soldiers must endure to learn the

proper procedures for reacting
when enemy fire comes from in
surgents stationed in mosques.
U.S. soldiers have died taking
these precautions.
And we can't begin to realize
how superbly soldiers adhere to the
highest codes of honor and profes
sional integrity. Every day they face
life-threatening challenges and
risks, both physical and emotional,
but they maintain the ethical com
posure that keeps America from
looking like an oppressor, at least
from fair-minded Iraqis.
They know that they are more
than defenders of the United States;
they are torchbearers of liberty.
They fight to win the freedom of an
unknown people, who differ in cul
ture, creed and religion. But they be
lieve that freedom is a gift be
queathed to all human beings from
God. We very rarely think about is
sues like that at all.
Almost 1,500 soldiers have died
in Iraq, thousands more have been
maimed or injured for life and ev
eryone probably comes back at
least a little different. While critics
in the world argue that democracy
won't sprout in Iraq, these troops
wake up every morning believing it
will, and praying that they will see
the day that it does.
My goal is not to fetishize service
to country, but to say there is no way
to adequately express gratitude for
those who have been in or are in Iraq
today. Although the task of convey
ing appreciation seems daunting, a
simple "thank you for your service"
might be all they ask to hear.
That isn't supposed to make us
feel better. Nor should it.

write about for my last column, but
I am selfish for choosing to end on
this one. I am constantly asking my
self if my motivation for writing this
is to somehow placate some of my
own feelings of guilt. They serve, I
don't. That doesn't mean I can't do
good things in my life. But it means
I'm choosing to let fellow Ameri
cans risk their lives while I stay on
the sidelines.
It takes discipline, principle, ide
alism, courage and strength of mind
to serve. It surely takes a lot more
things, but we don't really know ev
erything our troops go through.
We don't know just how asym
metrical warfare can be when fight
ing terrorists. These insurgents
have forced women and children
into cars, set them on fire, waited
until U.S. soldiers came to the res
cue and then blown up roadside
bombs to kill them. Yet we don't
have to think about this.
We also don't have to think
about how many hours of training
soldiers must endure to learn the

proper procedures for reacting
when enemy fire comes from in
surgents stationed in mosques.
U.S. soldiers have died taking
these precautions.
And we can't begin to realize
how superbly soldiers adhere to the
highest codes of honor and profes
sional integrity. Every day they face
life-threatening challenges and
risks, both physical and emotional,
but they maintain the ethical com
posure that keeps America from
looking like an oppressor, at least
from fair-minded Iraqis.
They know that they are more
than defenders of the United States;
they are torchbearers of liberty.
They fight to win the freedom of an
unknown people, who differ in cul
ture, creed and religion. But they be
lieve that freedom is a gift be
queathed to all human beings from
God. We very rarely think about is
sues like that at all.
Almost 1,500 soldiers have died
in Iraq, thousands more have been
maimed or injured for life and ev
eryone probably comes back at
least a little different. While critics
in the world argue that democracy
won't sprout in Iraq, these troops
wake up every morning believing it
will, and praying that they will see
the day that it does.
My goal is not to fetishize service
to country, but to say there is no way
to adequately express gratitude for
those who have been in or are in Iraq
today. Although the task of convey
ing appreciation seems daunting, a
simple "thank you for your service"
might be all they ask to hear.
That isn't supposed to make us
feel better. Nor should it.
