# Krasner takes place in State Dept.
## 
### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
Despite his wife's request that he purchase
a cell phone, Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner has refused. He has said that he is con
tent with his landline phones, in his office and
at home, and his e-mail.
But it is hard to imagine that he can contin
ue to live his increasingly busy life without
one.
Newly-confirmed Secretary of State and
former University Provost Condoleezza Rice
has named Krasner, her long-time friend and
colleague, as the incoming director of Policy
Planning at the State Department. Today,
Krasner will assume his new post, a position
equivalent in rank to an assistant secretary of
state, according to the State Department Web
site.
"Steve's scholarship in international relations
and his analytical prowess are well matched to
the job of director of Policy Planning," said Uni
versity President John Hennessy. "I believe his
experience and insight will help shed light on
some of the seemingly intractable international
situations faced by the Unites States and other
nations." _
A State Department spokesman said he could

not comment on the appointment until it be
comes official.
One of the country's most renowned schol
ars in international relations, Krasner, turning
63 next month, served as the deputy director of
the Stanford Institute for International Studies
(SI IS) and headed the Center on Democracy,
Development and the Rule of Law, or SIIS.
Past directors of Policy Planning include in
fluential statesmen such as George Kennan,
author of the containment policy toward the
former Soviet Union; Paul Nitze, a crucial
player in the U.S. Cold War strategy and nu
clear weapon policies; and Paul Wolfowitz, the
chief architect of the U.S. policy toward Iraq.
The appointment did not come as a surprise,
especially to faculty members familiar with
Krasner.
"As soon as 1 knew Condi Rice would be
come the next Secretary of State, I surmised
she might name Steve to that position, because
it was such a logical step," said Political Sci
ence Prof. Larry Diamond, coordinator of the
Democracy Program at the CDDRL, who has
known Krasner for more than a decade. "He
and Condi have been close friends and they
tend to view the world in largely similar ways."

Krasner joins the State Department today as
director of Policy Planning.
Krasner said that when Rice asked him to
accept the position, he immediately agreed.
"Leaving Stanford is always difficult,"
Krasner said. "But at the same time, it is an
opportunity that I just cannot turn down."
In his new role, Krasner will lead a State
Department division known as the Policy
Planning Staff â€”the internal think tank that
carries out policy analysis and offers advice
to the secretary. According to the depart
ment's Web site, the mission of the Policy
Planning Staff is "to take a longer term,
strategic view of global trends and frame rec
ommendations for the Secretary of State to
advance U.S. interests and American val
ues."
Krasner is no stranger to the Policy Plan
ning Staff, where he served as a staff member
from September 2001 to February 2002. He
then moved to the National Security Council
and worked with Rice, then national security
advisor. The two have had a close personal
relationship since 1981, when they both ar
rived at Stanford. During his nine-month
stint at the National Security Council. Kras
ner helped create the Millennium Challenge
Account, an initiative in which acceptance of
development aid is contingent upon im
proved governance of recipient nations. His
contribution to the Millennium Challenge
Account earned him substantial respect and
stature in political circles.
Krasner, who will report directly to Rice,
noted that his priorities as director of the Pol
icy Planning staff "will be whatever the Sec
retary wants me to do." But the real chal
lenge rests on how to provide her with well
conceived perspectives that she cannot easily
obtain from other parts of the State Depart
ment, he said.
"The key is to come up with visions or
strategic plans that can actually be turned
into functional policy initiatives," Krasner
said.
The Policy Planning Staff is staffed main

ly with professional civil servants, career
diplomats and short-term outside experts.
Many of them exhibit remarkable scholastic
credentials, but few actually entered the de
partment as academics. Krasner said he be
lieves his extensive academic experience will
help stimulate the process of policy analysis.
"I have a background very different from
those of other members of Policy Planning,"
Krasner said. "So I hope I'll be able to bring
to the table a different set of ideas."
He is no stranger to presenting a different
set of ideas. Krasner has challenged the con
ventional notion of sovereignty by arguing
that under some circumstances, it may be
better fora nation to share its sovereignty
with outside institutions. He is also opposed
to U.S. membership in the International
Criminal Court, contending that American
citizens should not be tried in the Court be
cause it lacks democratic accountability.
Krasner is widely respected in academia
for his studies on governance and the limits of
authority of nation-states in the modern
world. He has been credited for having pro
duced groundbreaking works on the topics of
sovereignty and international political econ
omy.
"Steve is the country's foremost thinker
about issues of failed and wrecked states,"
said Law Prof. Allen Weiner, a former career
attorney in the State Department. "No schol
ar can talk about nation-states and interna
tional sovereignty without quoting him."
Kathryn Stoner-Weiss, associate director
of the CDDRL. concurred.
"He's a giant in his field," Stoner-Weiss
said. "Steve is the reason why I came to Stan
ford from Princeton."
As a professor, Krasner is frequently de
scribed by his students as demanding, sharp
witted and, most of all, analytically incisive.
"Steve is rigorous, analytical and refresh
ingly frank," said Moonhawk Kim. a
CDDRL pre-doctoral fellow. "In his own
work and in advising students, Steve pushes
others to think about the world systematical

ly, yet in novel ways."
Tonya Putnam, who has been Krasner's
dissertation advisee for six years, said Kras
ner does not pull punches when he goes after
the flaws in an argument.
"That is sometimes tough on graduate stu
dents attempting to formulate dissertation
ideas, but my work has benefited immeasur
ably from his feedback."
While Krasner insisted that it is Bush, not
the secretary of state and her team, who plays
the vital role in foreign policy-making, some
see the recent appointments of Krasner and
other senior State Department officials as a
pattern suggesting that Rice has adopted a
more practical approach to shaking up the
U.S. foreign policy team.
Krasner is seen largely as an independent
realist without a particular ideological agen

da, and it is widely believed that the presence
of Krasner and other pragmatists in the State
Department will serve as a counterweight to
what many critics consider unilateral attitude
of the White House and the aggressive im
pulse of the Pentagon.
"For those who are worried that foreign
policy making under the Bush administration
has become increasingly detached from the
actual state of world affairs, it is reassuring to
know that Steve will head the very important
division charged to provide policy analysis
that is independent and not ideologically
driven," Diamond said.
"I think the Bush administration will ben
efit significantly from the counsel and strate
gic thinking of one of the most intellectually
sophisticated scholars in the field of interna
tional relations," Diamond concluded.
