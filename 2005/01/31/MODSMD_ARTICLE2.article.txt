### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
Despite his wife's request that he purchase
a cell phone, Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner has refused. He has said that he is con
tent with his landline phones, in his office and
at home, and his e-mail.
But it is hard to imagine that he can contin
ue to live his increasingly busy life without
one.
Newly-confirmed Secretary of State and
former University Provost Condoleezza Rice
has named Krasner, her long-time friend and
colleague, as the incoming director of Policy
Planning at the State Department. Today,
Krasner will assume his new post, a position
equivalent in rank to an assistant secretary of
state, according to the State Department Web
site.
"Steve's scholarship in international relations
and his analytical prowess are well matched to
the job of director of Policy Planning," said Uni
versity President John Hennessy. "I believe his
experience and insight will help shed light on
some of the seemingly intractable international
situations faced by the Unites States and other
nations." _
A State Department spokesman said he could

not comment on the appointment until it be
comes official.
One of the country's most renowned schol
ars in international relations, Krasner, turning
63 next month, served as the deputy director of
the Stanford Institute for International Studies
(SI IS) and headed the Center on Democracy,
Development and the Rule of Law, or SIIS.
Past directors of Policy Planning include in
fluential statesmen such as George Kennan,
author of the containment policy toward the
former Soviet Union; Paul Nitze, a crucial
player in the U.S. Cold War strategy and nu
clear weapon policies; and Paul Wolfowitz, the
chief architect of the U.S. policy toward Iraq.
The appointment did not come as a surprise,
especially to faculty members familiar with
Krasner.
"As soon as 1 knew Condi Rice would be
come the next Secretary of State, I surmised
she might name Steve to that position, because
it was such a logical step," said Political Sci
ence Prof. Larry Diamond, coordinator of the
Democracy Program at the CDDRL, who has
known Krasner for more than a decade. "He
and Condi have been close friends and they
tend to view the world in largely similar ways."
