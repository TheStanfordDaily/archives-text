Speaker Paul Findley offered
'hysterical claims', not facts
Olivia Sohns ("Congressman's
Speech Deserved Coverage," Jan.
28) complains that .The Daily did
not cover the speech of Paul Find
ley, the veteran ex-Congressman
that was brought to Stanford by the
Stanford Coalition for Justice in the
Middle l ast
As Sohns writes, the gist of Find
ley's speech was that the tragedy of
9/11 and the Iraq war were largely
the fault of America's support for Is
rael. Naturally, he offered nothing
to prove his assertions, only hysteri

cal claims such as America's pro-Is
rael lobby has cowed the US
Congress into doing Israel's bidding.
While pointing all fingers at Is
rael for everything wrong with the
world today, Findley reminded us
that Muslims have no responsibility
for anything that is occurring. He
brought informational fliers with
him which he asked the audience to
pass out and take into churches.
These fliers inform people about
Muslims and how "Islam and
democracy are compatible and
complementary." It is amazing that
he hasn't noticed that the Israel that
he loathes — which is surrounded

by 22 corrupt Arab-Islamic dicta
torships, monarchies and theocra
cies — is the only democracy in the
Middle East.
Those who brought Findley to
campus, those who heard him speak
and those who read Sohns' tribute to
him, should know that former Ku
Klux Klansman, David Duke lists
Findley as a good source of informa
tion about Jews in an article, "The
Media, The Genetics of Race, and
The Racial Double Standard."
On its Web site, the neo-Nazi
group National Alliance refers to .
Findley as one of the greatest politi
cians that ever existed.

It is a shame that the Stanford
Coalition for Justice in the Middle
East brought this bigot to campus and
the ASSU Speakers Bureau spon
sored him. Where is the outrage?

Article supporting congressman
'must be a joke' witnout a
punchline
After reading Olivia Sohns' re
cent piece ("Congressman's Speech
Deserved Coverage." Jan. 28), I am
left to wonder what passes for print
able material in the Daily's opinion

pages nowadays.
We get the point that Sohns is
quite taken by former Congressman
Paul Findley (who, if he doesn't al
ready, ought to write copy for Al-
Jazeera television) and his anti-Is
rael politics, but is a point-by-point
summary of Findley's speech (with
absolutely no analysis from its au
thor) really worthy of printing?
Literally all but two sentences of
Sohns' 600-word, grade-school book
report-like column begin with a vari
ation of "Findley then stated."
Thinking the article must be a
joke. 1 waited for the punch line, but
it never came.
All politics aside. Sohns' childish

article is an embarrassment to not
only its author but also to what I re
member to be a generally re
spectable student newspaper.

Local resident offers suggestions
for used-book sources
There are three good sources for
used book very close to the campus:
Bell's Books, on Emerson St. off
University Ave.. Know Knew Books
and The Bargain Box, a thrift shop
which has a large collection of used
books. The last two are both on
California Ave. All three are with
in biking distance or are reachable
by Marguerite.
There is also a Palo Alto Li
brary branch in College Terrace.
My suggestion: Rather than
going to the library every time you
want to read a novel/bio/travel
book, get some paperbacks from
one of the above sources, keep
them in your dorm and start a Put
and Take Library of your own.
When you want to read a
Hersey. Ayn Rand. Dickens,
Clancy or Grisham. get one from
the supply, putting in one of your
already read ones to replace it.
Every few months you'll have to
replenish the supply. There's al
ways someone who will Take and
not Put.
