## Card cruise past Ducks Haryasz shines in 88-69 rout of overmatched Oregon 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
The only uncertainties that kept Cardinal fans on
their toes in the second half of Stanford's 88-69 win
over Oregon (11-7, 3-6 Pacific-10 Conference) at

STANFORD 88
OREGON 69

Maples Pavilion on Sat
urday were whether ju
nior forward Matt
Haryasz would break
Rich Kelley's Cardinal

rebounding record of 27 and whether the fans would
be treated to Wendy's hamburgers after the game in
the event that the team broke the 10()-point barrier.
Neither hope was fulfilled, but the consolation is
that Stanford (12-7, 6-3 Pac-10) is beginning to look a
lot more like last season's 30-2 team. The team has
pushed its winning streak to six games and now finds it
self within one game of first place in the Pac-10 after
Arizona's stunning home loss to Washington State on
Saturday.
Haryasz finished with a career-high 20 points and 20
rebounds, becoming the first Stanford player to pull off
the feat since Tim Young did it at Oregon in 1997.
"It's really pretty special for me." he said. "I'm pret
ty excited. I think some of it's luck. too. Sometimes a
ball bounces your way, two or three of those rebounds,
or even more than that. Sometimes somebody tips a
ball your way."
Head coach Trent Johnson said that Haryasz's suc
cess was about more than just chance.
"It's about concentrating, constantly pursuing the
basketball." Johnson said. "You don't assume that
Rob [Little] or Chris [Hernandez] or Nick [Robinson]
is going to get the rebound. You have to want to get
every rebound."
The Sixth Man Club cheered every Harvasz board

in the second half and started chanting "20-20" when
Haryasz checked out for the last time with the game
well in hand.
"1 thought they were talking about vision," Haryasz
joked.
He was seeing fine, but Ernie Kent's squad was see
ing double when they looked up at the Cardinal's point
total. Stanford took a 51-25 lead into the half after
sophomore guard Fred Washington stripped the ball
from Oregon point guard Aaron Brooks and went
coast-to-coast fora one-handed dunk. He finished with
eight points.
Freshman guard Malik Hairston tried to keep Ore
gon in the game with a team-high 19 points, but the
Ducks were unable to string together more than five
consecutive points until late in the second half.
After Hernandez drained a three-pointer seven
minutes into the first half to put the Cardinal up 20-9,
Oregon never cut the lead below double digits. The ju
nior point guard scored 17 of his 19 points and made all
four of his three-point attempts in the first half.
Stanford got off to a similarly strong start against
Oregon State on Thursday, building an 18-point lead
seven minutes into the second half. But unlike the game
against the Beavers — in which the Cardinal surren
dered the lead and squeaked out a victory with clutch
free-throw shooting — the team did not let off the
throttle on Saturday.
Stanford led by 30 points with 7:53 to go in the sec
ond half, and Johnson did not pull his starters until two
minutes were left in the game, long after it had been
decided.
"We always talk about taking it one possession at a
time, and 1 didn't need to remind them to play like the score
was 0-0 coming out of the half," Johnson said. "They're in
telligent kids. They weren't satisfied with their perfor
mance in the second half against Oregon State."
For the first time this season, the Cardinal dominat
ed a game from start to finish.

the lead to 37-16 with 7:13 remaining
in the first half. The highlight was a
Nick Robinson lay-up on a pass by
Hernandez. The run was capped 20
seconds later when Robinson re
turned the favor, finding Hernandez
in the corner for an uncontested
trey.
Another high point in the half
was junior guard Dan Grunfeld's
lay-up on a one-on-three fastbreak.
He had a quiet game by his stan
dards, scoring 14 points.
"I think that Oregon did a good
job of getting to Dan, taking away
his driving lanes early," Johnson
said.
But even without Grunfeld lead
ing the scoring attack, the team had
no trouble burying a young Oregon
group from the get-go. It was some
thing the Cardinal would not have
been able to do early on this season,
when the offense depended mainly
on Grunfeld's ability to create shots.

buries Oregon early

"1 thought early on that it was
going to take our basketball team as
individuals a while to adjust to dif
ferent roles, and they've done that,"
Johnson said.
Oregon head coach Ernie Kent
agreed.
"They're right back to where
they were last year," he said. "They
may not have the depth that they
had last year, but they've got five
guys who can really play. I think
they've got their confidence and
their swagger back."
Johnson, a notorious perfection
ist, said that the team still had a long
way to go. He gave a laundry list of
the areas in which the Cardinal could
improve, including assist-to-turnover
ratio, bench play and execution
against the zone defense. The team
did pick up one deficiency, thanks to
Haryasz: For the first time in six
games, Stanford out-rebounded an
opponent, by a margin of 46-34.

After Johnson said that he was
not paying attention to the Cardi
nal's climb through the standings, he
was asked if he would go through the
year unsatisfied.
"Miserable is the word 1 like to
use." he said, perhaps only half-kid
ding. "I'm not miserable, I'm just...
we played well, we won. My respon
sibilities are making sure we're pre
pared for the next practice, the next
game. That's all."
After a little ribbing, he said,
"Okay, let's start all over and clean it
up. We're going to win a National
Championship. Now you've got me
laughing. Honestly, it's a journey. It
is what it is. Am I happy? Yeah. We
won. It beats the alternative."
Just ask the Ducks. They have
now lost 19 consecutive games in
Maples, a streak dating back to 1986,
the year when freshmen Taj Finger
and Peter Prowitt were born.
