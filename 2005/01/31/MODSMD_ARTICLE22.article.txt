## Card cruise past Ducks Haryasz shines in 88-69 rout of overmatched Oregon

The only uncertainties that kept Cardinal fans on
their toes in the second half of Stanford's 88-69 win
over Oregon (11-7, 3-6 Pacific-10 Conference) at

STANFORD 88
OREGON 69

Maples Pavilion on Sat
urday were whether ju
nior forward Matt
Haryasz would break
Rich Kelley's Cardinal

rebounding record of 27 and whether the fans would
be treated to Wendy's hamburgers after the game in
the event that the team broke the 10()-point barrier.
Neither hope was fulfilled, but the consolation is
that Stanford (12-7, 6-3 Pac-10) is beginning to look a
lot more like last season's 30-2 team. The team has
pushed its winning streak to six games and now finds it
self within one game of first place in the Pac-10 after
Arizona's stunning home loss to Washington State on
Saturday.
Haryasz finished with a career-high 20 points and 20
rebounds, becoming the first Stanford player to pull off
the feat since Tim Young did it at Oregon in 1997.
"It's really pretty special for me." he said. "I'm pret
ty excited. I think some of it's luck. too. Sometimes a
ball bounces your way, two or three of those rebounds,
or even more than that. Sometimes somebody tips a
ball your way."
Head coach Trent Johnson said that Haryasz's suc
cess was about more than just chance.
"It's about concentrating, constantly pursuing the
basketball." Johnson said. "You don't assume that
Rob [Little] or Chris [Hernandez] or Nick [Robinson]
is going to get the rebound. You have to want to get
every rebound."
The Sixth Man Club cheered every Harvasz board

in the second half and started chanting "20-20" when
Haryasz checked out for the last time with the game
well in hand.
"1 thought they were talking about vision," Haryasz
joked.
He was seeing fine, but Ernie Kent's squad was see
ing double when they looked up at the Cardinal's point
total. Stanford took a 51-25 lead into the half after
sophomore guard Fred Washington stripped the ball
from Oregon point guard Aaron Brooks and went
coast-to-coast fora one-handed dunk. He finished with
eight points.
Freshman guard Malik Hairston tried to keep Ore
gon in the game with a team-high 19 points, but the
Ducks were unable to string together more than five
consecutive points until late in the second half.
After Hernandez drained a three-pointer seven
minutes into the first half to put the Cardinal up 20-9,
Oregon never cut the lead below double digits. The ju
nior point guard scored 17 of his 19 points and made all
four of his three-point attempts in the first half.
Stanford got off to a similarly strong start against
Oregon State on Thursday, building an 18-point lead
seven minutes into the second half. But unlike the game
against the Beavers — in which the Cardinal surren
dered the lead and squeaked out a victory with clutch
free-throw shooting — the team did not let off the
throttle on Saturday.
Stanford led by 30 points with 7:53 to go in the sec
ond half, and Johnson did not pull his starters until two
minutes were left in the game, long after it had been
decided.
"We always talk about taking it one possession at a
time, and 1 didn't need to remind them to play like the score
was 0-0 coming out of the half," Johnson said. "They're in
telligent kids. They weren't satisfied with their perfor
mance in the second half against Oregon State."
For the first time this season, the Cardinal dominat
ed a game from start to finish.
They put it out of reach with an 11 -0 run that pushed
