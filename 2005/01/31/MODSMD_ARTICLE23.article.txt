# Women earn wins over Huskies, WSU
## 
### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
On the court. No. 4 Stanford's trip to Washington last
weekend was a complete success. The Cardinal (19-2. 10-1
Pacific-10 Conference) notched impressive victories over
both Washington (82-60) and Washington State (69-56).
However, the injury bug bit Tara VanDerveer's team
hard during the trip, sidelining redshirt sophomore Ezia
maka Okafor and freshman Jessica Elway.
Against Washington, the Cardinal struggled early as ju
nior Brooke Smith, sophomore Kristen Newlin and fresh-

man Candice Wiggins spent
significant time on the bench
in foul trouble.
In the absence of
Newlin and Smith, the un-

STANFORD 69
WSU 56

dersized Huskies were able to take the ball inside with reg
ularity. Washington's Jill Bell led her team with 14 points
before fouling out with more than five minutes remaining
in the game.
In the second half, however, the Cardinal's size wore the
Huskies down, leading to a 40-29 edge on the boards tor
Stanford. Smith led all scorers with 20 points and added
seven rebounds.
In Pullman. Wash.. Stanford once again started out slug
gishly against a surprisingly aggressive Cougar team. In 40
meetings between the two teams, Washington State (5-15,
1-10) has never won.
In a virtual replay of the first half of the Washington
game. Smith struggled against the Cougars' double team,
turning the ball over three times and shooting just 2-tor-6
from the field. For the season, Smith is No. 10 in the nation
in accuracy, shooting 61.0%.
"Brooke had some uncharacteristic turnovers," head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "We didn't seem real sharp
in terms of our passing out of the post."
Another disturbing trend for VanDerveer was the ab
sence of Wiggins due to foul trouble. In what has become
a habit for Wiggins of late, she picked up a pair ol fouls
on the defensive end. and played just six minutes in the
first half. She finished with seven points on the after
noon.
Wiggins, Stanford's leading scorer, has played fewer

than 10 first-half minutes in five of the team's last six games.
Over that span, she is averaging 8.8 minutes in the first half.
"I don't want to have her not be aggressive," Van-
Derveer said. "She's a young player, and I think she's a
quick study. I don't see this being a trend."
Most surprising, however, was the Cougars' success on
the boards against a much larger Stanford team. Washing
ton State battled Stanford to a virtual draw on the boards,
39-40. and the Cougars at one point held an 18-10 edge on
the glass.
On the bright side for Stanford, senior Sebnem Kimya
cioglu has begun to re-emerge as a force for the Cardinal
offense.
Tied with Lindsey Yamasaki for third on Stanford's ca
reer three-pointer list, Kimyacioglu needs just nine more to
move into a tie for second with three-time All-American
Nicole Powell.
After looking excellent in a tough Friday practice,
Kimyacioglu took the same aggressiveness with her to the
court against the Cougars, scoring 10 points on 4-for-7
shooting, including 2-for-4 from beyond the three-point
arc.
Sophomore Kate Benz led a feisty Washington State of
fense that attacked the hoop for much of the afternoon and
got to the free throw line for 20 attempts.
Benz tallied her eighth double-double of the season
with 10 points and 15 rebounds.
The Cougars stayed with Stanford for much of the first
half, leading by three points until the 6:27 mark.
"The power of believing is an amazing force,"' WSU
head coach Sherri Murrell said. "| We| were confident over
Cal... and hopefully this confidence can continue on the
road against the California schools."
Despite Stanford's victories, however, the loss of
Okafor and Elway hung heavy over the team this weekend.
"We're ready to leave Washington as soon as possible,"
Kimyacioglu said. "That really does hurt us emotionally,
and 1 think we did a really good job of coming out and play
ing hard."
Okafor tore her right Achilles tendon in Thursday's
game against Washington, and underwent an MRI yester
day. Surgery to repair the tendon will take place Wednes
day, and she will miss the rest of the season.
In Friday's practice, Elway suffered a broken right hand

in four-on-four drills. She will receive a cast after seeing a
hand specialist, and the timetable for her return is current
ly unknown.
Stanford returns home this weekend fora rematch with
the Arizona schools at Maples Pavilion.

Over that span, she is averaging 8.8 minutes in the first half.
"I don't want to have her not be aggressive," Van-
Derveer said. "She's a young player, and I think she's a
quick study. I don't see this being a trend."
Most surprising, however, was the Cougars' success on
the boards against a much larger Stanford team. Washing
ton State battled Stanford to a virtual draw on the boards,
39-40. and the Cougars at one point held an 18-10 edge on
the glass.
On the bright side for Stanford, senior Sebnem Kimya
cioglu has begun to re-emerge as a force for the Cardinal
offense.
Tied with Lindsey Yamasaki for third on Stanford's ca
reer three-pointer list, Kimyacioglu needs just nine more to
move into a tie for second with three-time All-American
Nicole Powell.
After looking excellent in a tough Friday practice,
Kimyacioglu took the same aggressiveness with her to the
court against the Cougars, scoring 10 points on 4-for-7
shooting, including 2-for-4 from beyond the three-point
arc.
Sophomore Kate Benz led a feisty Washington State of
fense that attacked the hoop for much of the afternoon and
got to the free throw line for 20 attempts.
Benz tallied her eighth double-double of the season
with 10 points and 15 rebounds.
The Cougars stayed with Stanford for much of the first
half, leading by three points until the 6:27 mark.
"The power of believing is an amazing force,"' WSU
head coach Sherri Murrell said. "| We| were confident over
Cal... and hopefully this confidence can continue on the
road against the California schools."
Despite Stanford's victories, however, the loss of
Okafor and Elway hung heavy over the team this weekend.
"We're ready to leave Washington as soon as possible,"
Kimyacioglu said. "That really does hurt us emotionally,
and 1 think we did a really good job of coming out and play
ing hard."
Okafor tore her right Achilles tendon in Thursday's
game against Washington, and underwent an MRI yester
day. Surgery to repair the tendon will take place Wednes
day, and she will miss the rest of the season.
In Friday's practice, Elway suffered a broken right hand

in four-on-four drills. She will receive a cast after seeing a
hand specialist, and the timetable for her return is current
ly unknown.
Stanford returns home this weekend fora rematch with
the Arizona schools at Maples Pavilion.

Cissy Pierce and the rest of the Stanford women's basket
ball team continued their dominance of Washington State.
They face Arizona at home this Thursday.
On the court. No. 4 Stanford's trip to Washington last
weekend was a complete success. The Cardinal (19-2. 10-1
Pacific-10 Conference) notched impressive victories over
both Washington (82-60) and Washington State (69-56).
However, the injury bug bit Tara VanDerveer's team
hard during the trip, sidelining redshirt sophomore Ezia
maka Okafor and freshman Jessica Elway.
Against Washington, the Cardinal struggled early as ju
nior Brooke Smith, sophomore Kristen Newlin and fresh-

man Candice Wiggins spent
significant time on the bench
in foul trouble.
In the absence of
Newlin and Smith, the un-

WSU 56

dersized Huskies were able to take the ball inside with reg
ularity. Washington's Jill Bell led her team with 14 points
before fouling out with more than five minutes remaining
in the game.
In the second half, however, the Cardinal's size wore the
Huskies down, leading to a 40-29 edge on the boards tor
Stanford. Smith led all scorers with 20 points and added
seven rebounds.
In Pullman. Wash.. Stanford once again started out slug
gishly against a surprisingly aggressive Cougar team. In 40
meetings between the two teams, Washington State (5-15,
1-10) has never won.
In a virtual replay of the first half of the Washington
game. Smith struggled against the Cougars' double team,
turning the ball over three times and shooting just 2-tor-6
from the field. For the season, Smith is No. 10 in the nation
in accuracy, shooting 61.0%.
"Brooke had some uncharacteristic turnovers," head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "We didn't seem real sharp
in terms of our passing out of the post."
Another disturbing trend for VanDerveer was the ab
sence of Wiggins due to foul trouble. In what has become
a habit for Wiggins of late, she picked up a pair ol fouls
on the defensive end. and played just six minutes in the
first half. She finished with seven points on the after
noon.
Wiggins, Stanford's leading scorer, has played fewer

than 10 first-half minutes in five of the team's last six games.
Over that span, she is averaging 8.8 minutes in the first half.
