# Fade Into Bolivian
## February, the sports fan's most boring month 
### 
Following Spencer Porter's classic
Minesweeper column on Friday. I was faced
with the monumental task of writing a col
umn for this week. Granted, I usually don't cover
current events, but in my best attempt at staying
"relevant," allow me to introduce this week's
topic: the February Dead Zone.
Quite simply, the month of February is an ab
solute sports abyss. After the Super Bowl there's
no more NFL (the Pro Bowl certainly doesn't
count), we are a month away from conference
tournaments in NCAA Basketball. Spring Train
ing doesn't fully start until March and there's usu
ally mediocre midseason NHL and NBA action.
Being a fan of Barry Bonds. I recognize that not

giving maximum effort on
every play during a 162-game
season allows Bonds to stay rel
atively healthy and put up as
tronomical numbers. Thus, the
recent revelation that TMac
and V. Carter lollygag through
the NBA season doesn't bother
me. However, with roughly half
the teams in both the NHL and
NBA making the playoffs,
February basketball or hockey

season is extraordinarily irrelevant, as teams som
nambulate through the regular season. Of course,
the fact that the Warriors will be eliminated from
playoff contention come February usually doesn't
help.
I, for one, motion that the entire month of
February be stricken from the sports calendar, and
that the Super Bowl be returned to January, the
month that rightly owns it. Of the past 39 Super
Bowls, 36 of those have been played in January.
'Hie recent introduction of two weeks of hype
filled babble in between the Conference Champi
onships and the Super Bowl is simply unbearable
and leads to meaningless debates between T.O.
and his doctor.
In a clear acknowledgement of the Dead Zone,
Sports Illustrated publishes its Swimsuit Issue dur
ing the woeful month of February. With no sports
to cover and a need to sell issues, SI attempts to
pass hot models wearing next to nothing off as
sports. While I love Ilsa Benitez as much as the
next guy, publishing pictures of Serena Williams
and Steffi Graf is questionable at best. Look, 1 un
derstand your desire to put athletes in the Swim
suit Issue in order to save face as a sports magazine.
But. quite simply, Serena and Steffi disrupt the
flow of hot models and ruin my viewing experi
ence. Considering the revealing outfits that Serena
chooses to wear, I have no idea how SI chose to
model her beastly body for the Swimsuit Issue —
I've seen enough of her tennis matches to know
exactly what she'd look like in a bikini, and it isn't
pretty.
And finally, on a side note that has absolutely
no relevance to the topic of this column, after Moi
ses Alou left via free agency to the Giants, and
Sammy Sosa was traded to the O's, can anybody
name the starting outfield for the Chicago Cubs?
In an attempt to uncover the truth, I drunkenly ap
proached a guy wearing a backward Cubs hat at
the Kappa Alpha fraternity on Saturday night.
After debating the merits of the Sosa deal, he in
formed me that the Cubs outfield now consists of
an injury-prone Corey Patterson, a mediocre
Todd Hollandsworth and rookie Jason Dubois.
Jason who? While I certainly don't question that
Sosa was universally hated in the Cubs clubhouse,
the Cubs still lose, at minimum, a 30-home run guy
who puts up very good power numbers. The loss of
Sosa and his freakishly large head, combined with
Alou and his peculiar urinating habits, finds the
Cubs 74 home runs and 186 RBIs short of last
year's production.

Faced with a lack of meaningful sports to follow,
and thus a plethora of free time during February,
you can most likely find Neil on his Nintendo
Power Pad. E-mail him at neild@stunford.edu

Bowls, 36 of those have been played in January.
'Hie recent introduction of two weeks of hype
filled babble in between the Conference Champi
onships and the Super Bowl is simply unbearable
and leads to meaningless debates between T.O.
and his doctor.
In a clear acknowledgement of the Dead Zone,
Sports Illustrated publishes its Swimsuit Issue dur
ing the woeful month of February. With no sports
to cover and a need to sell issues, SI attempts to
pass hot models wearing next to nothing off as
sports. While I love Ilsa Benitez as much as the
next guy, publishing pictures of Serena Williams
and Steffi Graf is questionable at best. Look, 1 un
derstand your desire to put athletes in the Swim
suit Issue in order to save face as a sports magazine.
But. quite simply, Serena and Steffi disrupt the
flow of hot models and ruin my viewing experi
ence. Considering the revealing outfits that Serena
chooses to wear, I have no idea how SI chose to
model her beastly body for the Swimsuit Issue —
I've seen enough of her tennis matches to know
exactly what she'd look like in a bikini, and it isn't
pretty.
And finally, on a side note that has absolutely
no relevance to the topic of this column, after Moi
ses Alou left via free agency to the Giants, and
Sammy Sosa was traded to the O's, can anybody
name the starting outfield for the Chicago Cubs?
In an attempt to uncover the truth, I drunkenly ap
proached a guy wearing a backward Cubs hat at
the Kappa Alpha fraternity on Saturday night.
After debating the merits of the Sosa deal, he in
formed me that the Cubs outfield now consists of
an injury-prone Corey Patterson, a mediocre
Todd Hollandsworth and rookie Jason Dubois.
Jason who? While I certainly don't question that
Sosa was universally hated in the Cubs clubhouse,
the Cubs still lose, at minimum, a 30-home run guy
who puts up very good power numbers. The loss of
Sosa and his freakishly large head, combined with
Alou and his peculiar urinating habits, finds the
Cubs 74 home runs and 186 RBIs short of last
year's production.

Faced with a lack of meaningful sports to follow,
and thus a plethora of free time during February,
you can most likely find Neil on his Nintendo
Power Pad. E-mail him at neild@stunford.edu
