# Romanczuk, Stanford sweep Fresno State
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford ace Mark Romanczuk walked the first bat
ter he faced in the No. 6 Cardinal's season opener on
Saturday afternoon. In fact, he walked three of the first
four Bulldogs to step into the box — the fourth got a
single.
But, of course. Romanczuk wouldn't be a Cardinal if
he couldn't overcome allowing one measly run.
The lefthander combined with six other Stanford
pitchers this weekend to allow only five runs in the Car
dinal's three-game sweep of Fresno State (0-3). Stan
ford vanquished the Bulldogs 12-1 in the series opener
(which took place on Saturday due to Friday night's wet
weather), then went on to claim a 7-0 shutout and a 8-4
victory in Sunday's doubleheader.
"I was really pleased with our pitching, our defense,"
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said. "We only
used seven pitchers this early in the year, which is
good."
The Bulldogs opted to send their No. 2 starter to the
mound to face Romanczuk, but sophomore Brandon
Miller was clearly no match for Stanford's offense.

which seems to have retained some of last season's fire
power.
The Cardinal scored nine of its 12 runs in the third
and fourth inning, leaving Miller and his fourth-inning
replacement Doug Fister with the sour feeling of an
ugly early-season ERA. Junior Chris Minaker led Stan
ford from the two-spot, going 5-for-5 on the night with
four runs scored, while junior John Mayberry Jr. hit 2-
for-3 with three RBI. Junior Jed Lowrie knocked the
game's only home run — a two-run shot in the filth —
to the surprise of no one.
Fresno State, on the other hand, scattered five hits
that never materialized. Romanczuk collected the win
after five innings on the mound, while sophomore re
liever Matt Leva threw four scoreless innings for the
pitching staff's first save of the season.
Junior righthander Jeff Gilmore looked smooth
from start to finish in his Sunday start, conceding only
two hits and striking out six in six complete innings. The
key, according to Gilmore, was pitch choice — he used
the new change-up that he picked up during summer
ball about 50 percent of the time.
"Fresno State is an excellent fastball hitting team,"
Gilmore said. "So we threw a lot off-speed and had suc
cess."

Freshman Nolan Gallagher also took the mound on
Sunday afternoon in his first collegiate outing and en
sured Stanford the win and the shutout. Gallagher al
lowed three hits and was awarded a save for the effort.
The Bulldogs' number one starter. Ryan Penn,
struggled in his first start in Fresno State uniform. A ju
nior transfer from Cerro Coso Community College.
Penn immediately gave up two runs in the first — hey.
you try keeping Lowrie from a two-run homer — and
hit three batters in five innings.
Damage was limited to three runs until the seventh
inning, when sophomore Adam Sorgi got a free pass
from rookie reliever Chuck Fick and was knocked
home by a Minaker single to left. Minaker was then
brought around the basepath by Lowrie's third two-run
moonshot of the series. Sophomore outfielder Jim
Rapoport crossed the plate once more in the eighth to
seal the Cardinal's lead at seven.
In game two of Sunday's double dose. Fresno State
finally found something it could hit. Sophomore Greg
Reynolds won Stanford's third starting job in practice
but couldn't quite translate his command to a gametimc
situation. Reynolds gave up eight hits — which the de-

runs — and was lifted after 3 1/3 in
nings. Sophomore lefty Blake
Holler, who is regarded as
Reynolds' stiffest competition for
the third spot in the Cardinal rota
tion. got his teammate out of the
fourth frame quickly. Holler tossed
4 2/3 innings, allowing only one run
on one hit, with three wild pitches
to get the win.

Fresno State might have had a
shot at prevailing in the final game
of the series — that is, if the fa

crucial errors in the first inning and
three more after that. By the time
the fifth error struck in the sixth
frame, the scoreboard read 6-3.
In the following inning, a pair of
sophomores added to the game's
lopsided look. Rapoport and Sorgi

each hit a towering shot over the
right field wall — the first career
home run for both — and an early
indication that the Cardinal may
still have top-to-bottom reliability
in their lineup.
Gilmore said that the perfor
mances seen in opening weekend
were very characteristic of the Car

In the following inning, a pair of
sophomores added to the game's
lopsided look. Rapoport and Sorgi

each hit a towering shot over the
right field wall — the first career
home run for both — and an early
indication that the Cardinal may
still have top-to-bottom reliability
in their lineup.
Gilmore said that the perfor
mances seen in opening weekend
were very characteristic of the Car
dinal's abilities.
"But the next two weekends we
play arguably two of the best teams
in the country in CSU-Fullerton
and Texas, and that will be the true
test."
Stanford ace Mark Romanczuk walked the first bat
ter he faced in the No. 6 Cardinal's season opener on
Saturday afternoon. In fact, he walked three of the first
four Bulldogs to step into the box — the fourth got a
single.
But, of course. Romanczuk wouldn't be a Cardinal if
he couldn't overcome allowing one measly run.
The lefthander combined with six other Stanford
pitchers this weekend to allow only five runs in the Car
dinal's three-game sweep of Fresno State (0-3). Stan
ford vanquished the Bulldogs 12-1 in the series opener
(which took place on Saturday due to Friday night's wet
weather), then went on to claim a 7-0 shutout and a 8-4
victory in Sunday's doubleheader.
"I was really pleased with our pitching, our defense,"
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said. "We only
used seven pitchers this early in the year, which is
good."
The Bulldogs opted to send their No. 2 starter to the
mound to face Romanczuk, but sophomore Brandon
Miller was clearly no match for Stanford's offense.

which seems to have retained some of last season's fire
power.
The Cardinal scored nine of its 12 runs in the third
and fourth inning, leaving Miller and his fourth-inning
replacement Doug Fister with the sour feeling of an
ugly early-season ERA. Junior Chris Minaker led Stan
ford from the two-spot, going 5-for-5 on the night with
four runs scored, while junior John Mayberry Jr. hit 2-
for-3 with three RBI. Junior Jed Lowrie knocked the
game's only home run — a two-run shot in the filth —
to the surprise of no one.
Fresno State, on the other hand, scattered five hits
that never materialized. Romanczuk collected the win
after five innings on the mound, while sophomore re
liever Matt Leva threw four scoreless innings for the
pitching staff's first save of the season.
Junior righthander Jeff Gilmore looked smooth
from start to finish in his Sunday start, conceding only
two hits and striking out six in six complete innings. The
key, according to Gilmore, was pitch choice — he used
the new change-up that he picked up during summer
ball about 50 percent of the time.
"Fresno State is an excellent fastball hitting team,"
Gilmore said. "So we threw a lot off-speed and had suc
cess."

Freshman Nolan Gallagher also took the mound on
Sunday afternoon in his first collegiate outing and en
sured Stanford the win and the shutout. Gallagher al
lowed three hits and was awarded a save for the effort.
The Bulldogs' number one starter. Ryan Penn,
struggled in his first start in Fresno State uniform. A ju
nior transfer from Cerro Coso Community College.
Penn immediately gave up two runs in the first — hey.
you try keeping Lowrie from a two-run homer — and
hit three batters in five innings.
Damage was limited to three runs until the seventh
inning, when sophomore Adam Sorgi got a free pass
from rookie reliever Chuck Fick and was knocked
home by a Minaker single to left. Minaker was then
brought around the basepath by Lowrie's third two-run
moonshot of the series. Sophomore outfielder Jim
Rapoport crossed the plate once more in the eighth to
seal the Cardinal's lead at seven.
In game two of Sunday's double dose. Fresno State
finally found something it could hit. Sophomore Greg
Reynolds won Stanford's third starting job in practice
but couldn't quite translate his command to a gametimc
situation. Reynolds gave up eight hits — which the de-

runs — and was lifted after 3 1/3 in
nings. Sophomore lefty Blake
Holler, who is regarded as
Reynolds' stiffest competition for
the third spot in the Cardinal rota
tion. got his teammate out of the
fourth frame quickly. Holler tossed
4 2/3 innings, allowing only one run
on one hit, with three wild pitches
to get the win.
Righthander Erik Davis made
his collegiate debut in the ninth,
dropping Fresno's 4-5-6 hitters to
end the game.

shot at prevailing in the final game
of the series — that is, if the fa

crucial errors in the first inning and
three more after that. By the time
