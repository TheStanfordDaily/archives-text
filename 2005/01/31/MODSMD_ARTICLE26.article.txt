# Gauchos too much for Reddy and Stanford men
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITER 
Even with junior Ben Reddy hack in the lineup,
the men's volleyball team could not defeat No. 7 UC-
Santa Barbara in a five-game match at Burnham
Pavilion on Saturday.
The Gauchos (5-4, 5-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) were propelled to victory by sopho
more Evan Patak, who recorded a career-high 48
kills in the match. With the help of senior Kevin
Hansen's 60 assists, senior Craig Buell led the Car
dinal with a noteworthy 16 kills, but Patak's pres
ence was simply overwhelming.
"If we had just been able to stop [Patak] a couple
of times, we could have won the match," head coach
Don Shaw said. "It was unbelievable. That's part of
our dilemma. These other teams have guys to go to
that we're going to have to figure out a way to stop.
We're more of a team effort, where we have to have
all the players working together. That team has one
guy, and he bails them out."
Despite the intensity of Patak's offense, the No. 9
Cardinal (3-6, 2-4 MPSF) came out strong, fighting
their way through a series of tied points in the start of
game one. The play was not always pretty, but the
Stanford team scrambled for the ball and pulled
through on a number of plays.
The Cardinal went on to win 30-23, with a brief
appearance by Reddy toward the end of the game.
The second game started out much like the first,
but when the Gauchos pulled ahead 13-12, Shaw
called a timeout to let his team regroup. Stanford
continued to slide, however, until freshman Matt
Ceran's fourth service ace of the match pulled the
Cardinal into another temporary tie at 17-17.
Despite another timeout and a substitution of
Reddy in for redshirt junior William Clayton, Stan
ford ultimately could not keep things together. Its
hitting percentage in that game was a mere .063 and,
after allowing UCSB to record a .400 percentage, the
Cardinal lost the game 24-30.
"We didn't take care of as many point-scoring op
portunities as we could have," Shaw said. "We
couldn't put the ball away, so we couldn't catch up."
Reddy was back in the lineup as a starter fora
highly competitive game three.
"Ben made an impact immediately," senior David
Vogel said. "He adds a lot of offense to the team, and
that kind of balances out the rest of the guys, so we
can all get into our roles a bit easier."
A series of long, dramatic points in that third
game fueled the crowd's energy as they stomped the
bleachers and yelled for the Cardinal.
Stanford won many of these points, breaking ties
and staying one step ahead of UCSB. A scramble
into the bench and a point that crossed the net count
less times before the Cardinal block roofed the Gau
cho attack energized both the fans and the team.
Toward the end of the match. Stanford's 26-21
lead fell to 27-26, but with a few more scrappy plays.

it notched a 30-28 win.
"It was dramatic and high-energy," Vogel said. "I
think we did a good job with digging and transitions;
serving, we put them in trouble off the corner."
The Cardinal had a surprisingly poor start to game
four, though, and they immediately fell behind 0-4.
The gap widened to 2-8 until Stanford pulled within
three, forcing a UCSB timeout.
"The other team served really, really tough, and
we got in a hole, because we had a hard time handling
their serves," Shaw said. "You get in a hole; it's hard
to come back. We got back within 10-13, and I felt
like we'd gotten back into the game, but then we
gave them a little bit more of a run. Again, with
point-per-play scoring, you get in a hole, and without
a power guy like they have, we have a hard time fin
ishing off points."
The Cardinal scrambled to 18-20 halfway through
the game, then fell further behind and could not re
cover. With a 24-30 loss, Stanford lost the advantage
in the match and was forced into game five.
"The beginning of game four, they came out rip
ping their jump serves, and we just had a difficult
time getting a settable pass," Vogel said. "Unfortu
nately, we were down 7-2 before we started playing
well again. In practice, we're always trying to work
on not giving up any streaks like at the beginning of
that game."
The Cardinal did not allow the Gauchos to repeat
such a performance in the fifth game. Breaking an
early tie, Stanford drew away 8-5 before UCSB came
back to make it 11-11. The game was almost consis
tently tied at every point, but the Gauchos took the
upper hand, forcing the Cardinal to keep up with
them.
"We had one miscommunication when we had a
chance to score an extra point," Shaw said. "It got
loud in here, and two of the guys both called for the
ball at the same time, and we mishandled the ball.
Little things like that make a huge difference in a
match that close. A play here, a play there."
The first match point came at 13-14 in favor of
UCSB. With the Cardinal fighting back each time as
they tried to tip the score in their favor, it took the
Gauchos four more attempts to finally close out the
match 16-18.
"Nobody likes to lose, and our guys are just like
anyone else," Shaw said. "They will not take this loss
easily. But we did what we had to do. Our guys come
in and they play hard, they play together, and we're
doing the best we can. It's a long season, and we just
have to keep trying to play better."
Overall, Stanford played aggressively and made
UCSB work hard for its 3-2 victory. Even though the
Cardinal lost, there were signs of encouragement.
"Game live was really close," Vogel said. "I felt
that we could have been a little bit more consistent at
times, but overall, we sat it out. Patak did a good job;
he's kind of their safety valve for the team. He beat
us at the end. But I think it was a positive match for
us. We're going in the right direction."

times, but overall, we sat it out. Patak did a good job;
he's kind of their safety valve for the team. He beat
us at the end. But I think it was a positive match for
us. We're going in the right direction."
Even with junior Ben Reddy hack in the lineup,
the men's volleyball team could not defeat No. 7 UC-
Santa Barbara in a five-game match at Burnham
Pavilion on Saturday.
The Gauchos (5-4, 5-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) were propelled to victory by sopho
more Evan Patak, who recorded a career-high 48
kills in the match. With the help of senior Kevin
Hansen's 60 assists, senior Craig Buell led the Car
dinal with a noteworthy 16 kills, but Patak's pres
ence was simply overwhelming.
"If we had just been able to stop [Patak] a couple
of times, we could have won the match," head coach
Don Shaw said. "It was unbelievable. That's part of
our dilemma. These other teams have guys to go to
that we're going to have to figure out a way to stop.
We're more of a team effort, where we have to have
all the players working together. That team has one
guy, and he bails them out."
Despite the intensity of Patak's offense, the No. 9
Cardinal (3-6, 2-4 MPSF) came out strong, fighting
their way through a series of tied points in the start of
game one. The play was not always pretty, but the
Stanford team scrambled for the ball and pulled
through on a number of plays.
The Cardinal went on to win 30-23, with a brief
appearance by Reddy toward the end of the game.
The second game started out much like the first,
but when the Gauchos pulled ahead 13-12, Shaw
called a timeout to let his team regroup. Stanford
continued to slide, however, until freshman Matt
Ceran's fourth service ace of the match pulled the
Cardinal into another temporary tie at 17-17.
Despite another timeout and a substitution of
Reddy in for redshirt junior William Clayton, Stan
ford ultimately could not keep things together. Its
hitting percentage in that game was a mere .063 and,
after allowing UCSB to record a .400 percentage, the
Cardinal lost the game 24-30.
"We didn't take care of as many point-scoring op
portunities as we could have," Shaw said. "We
couldn't put the ball away, so we couldn't catch up."
Reddy was back in the lineup as a starter fora
highly competitive game three.
"Ben made an impact immediately," senior David
Vogel said. "He adds a lot of offense to the team, and
that kind of balances out the rest of the guys, so we
can all get into our roles a bit easier."
A series of long, dramatic points in that third
game fueled the crowd's energy as they stomped the
bleachers and yelled for the Cardinal.
Stanford won many of these points, breaking ties
and staying one step ahead of UCSB. A scramble
into the bench and a point that crossed the net count
less times before the Cardinal block roofed the Gau
cho attack energized both the fans and the team.
Toward the end of the match. Stanford's 26-21
lead fell to 27-26, but with a few more scrappy plays.

it notched a 30-28 win.
"It was dramatic and high-energy," Vogel said. "I
think we did a good job with digging and transitions;
serving, we put them in trouble off the corner."
The Cardinal had a surprisingly poor start to game
four, though, and they immediately fell behind 0-4.
The gap widened to 2-8 until Stanford pulled within
three, forcing a UCSB timeout.
"The other team served really, really tough, and
we got in a hole, because we had a hard time handling
their serves," Shaw said. "You get in a hole; it's hard
to come back. We got back within 10-13, and I felt
like we'd gotten back into the game, but then we
gave them a little bit more of a run. Again, with
point-per-play scoring, you get in a hole, and without
a power guy like they have, we have a hard time fin
ishing off points."
The Cardinal scrambled to 18-20 halfway through
the game, then fell further behind and could not re
cover. With a 24-30 loss, Stanford lost the advantage
in the match and was forced into game five.
"The beginning of game four, they came out rip
ping their jump serves, and we just had a difficult
time getting a settable pass," Vogel said. "Unfortu
nately, we were down 7-2 before we started playing
well again. In practice, we're always trying to work
on not giving up any streaks like at the beginning of
that game."
The Cardinal did not allow the Gauchos to repeat
such a performance in the fifth game. Breaking an
early tie, Stanford drew away 8-5 before UCSB came
back to make it 11-11. The game was almost consis
tently tied at every point, but the Gauchos took the
upper hand, forcing the Cardinal to keep up with
them.
"We had one miscommunication when we had a
chance to score an extra point," Shaw said. "It got
loud in here, and two of the guys both called for the
ball at the same time, and we mishandled the ball.
Little things like that make a huge difference in a
match that close. A play here, a play there."
The first match point came at 13-14 in favor of
UCSB. With the Cardinal fighting back each time as
they tried to tip the score in their favor, it took the
Gauchos four more attempts to finally close out the
match 16-18.
"Nobody likes to lose, and our guys are just like
anyone else," Shaw said. "They will not take this loss
easily. But we did what we had to do. Our guys come
in and they play hard, they play together, and we're
doing the best we can. It's a long season, and we just
have to keep trying to play better."
Overall, Stanford played aggressively and made
UCSB work hard for its 3-2 victory. Even though the
Cardinal lost, there were signs of encouragement.
