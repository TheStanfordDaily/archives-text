### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
Team captain Lacey Boutwell
won the 50-yard and 100-yard
freestyle races both days and added
a victory in the 200-yard distance
on Saturday. Four of these five fin
ishes were "B" qualifying times.
She led a 1-2-3 sweep of the 100-
yard free on Friday and a 1-2-3-4
sweep in the 50-yard race the fol
lowing day.
"I thought that Lacey Boutwell
really set the tone by winning three
first places [on Saturday]," said
head coach Richard Quick.
Other seniors contributing
points were Amy Wagner, who
placed third in the 100-yard back
stroke in both meets, Sarah Jones,
who finished fourth in an exhibi
tion swim in the 50-yard freestyle
against USC, and Kirsten Gilbert,
fourth finisher in the 200-yard
breaststroke against USC.
Before Saturday's meet, there
was a ceremony honoring all nine
seniors: Boutwell, Rosenthal,
Wagner, Jones, Gilbert, Evins
Cameron, Erin Glenn, Erin Lash
nits and Tami Ransom.
"We have a large senior class
and they represent a big percent
age of the team," Quick said. "We
had more parents than ever before
on a Parent's Weekend with the
biggest senior class ever. It was an
emotional and exciting time for
them, but of course we have quite a
long way to go before the end of the
season."
Though it will be hard to part
with the senior class at the end, the
departing veterans are leaving
their squad in very capable hands.
The freshman class has already
made a huge impact on the team's
success. Olympian Caroline Bruce
has proven herself to be a mature
and talented competitor. Bruce
won six races this weekend, all in at
least "B" qualifying times. She
posted the fourth fastest time in the
nation this year in the 200-yard
breaststroke against UCLA, more
than two seconds under the NCAA
"A" cutoff, and won both the 100-
and 200-yard breaststroke races
and the individual medley in each
meet. Three of those races were in
"A" qualifying time.
Two other freshmen have

There is always the urge to do
something especially well the last
time you do it. The seniors on the
women's swimming and diving
team, competing on the Stanford
campus for the final time of their
collegiate careers, put on a show
this weekend for the home crowd
and went out with a bang.
No. 5 Stanford cruised to a 176-
124 victory over No. 11 UCLA on
Friday and then clobbered No. 18
USC on Saturday, 193-103.
Against the Bruins, Stanford
dropped the first three races but
stepped up to take 11 of the last 13
events. Against the Trojans, the
Cardinal started strong and never
looked back, winning all but one
race and one diving event.
UCLA won the 200-yard med
ley relay, 1000-yard freestyle and
200-yard freestyle to start the meet
but could only manage two more
wins, which came in the 100- and
200-yard butterfly events.
USC's victories came in the 100-
yard butterfly, with Emily Goetsch
edging out Stanford's Dana Kirk;
the three-meter springboard div
ing, won by Olympian Blythe Hart
ley; and the 400-yard freestyle
relay, in which all three Stanford
teams swam as unscored exhibi
tions. Though USC officially won
the race, Stanford's A team
touched the wall first.
Over the course of the two
meets, the seniors contributed
seven victories.
Senior diver Ashlee Rosenthal
swept the one-meter and three
meter springboard competitions
against USC and placed third and
second, respectively, against the
Trojans. Her score in her three
meter win was a career high.
"I asked her and she said it
wasn't a big deal," head coach Rick
Schavone said of Rosenthal's per
formance in her last home meet.
"It's more than just the four years
at Stanford for us. We've been to
gether since she was nine years old,
so she's leaving that too. It's an
emotional time for her, but she
downplayed it."

emerged as consistent competitors,
leading the team in several strokes.
Brooke Bishop posted wins in the
100- and 200-yard backstroke in
each meet and finished second in
the 50-yard freestyle on Saturday.
In these five races she reached the
NCAA "B" standard three times.
Elizabeth Durot rounds out the
freshman trio. Durot won the 500-
yard freestyle both days in "B"
qualifying time and came in second
both times in the 200-yard
freestyle, again in "B" time.
"With Bruce, Bishop, Durot
and sophomore Lauren Costella
winning, we had a lot of youth do a
real good job," Quick said.
In the long-distance freestyle
races, the Cardinal were led by
sophomore Desiree Stahley, run
ner-up in the 1000-yard distance,
and Lauren Costella, who led a 1-2-
3 of the 1650-yard race, with all
three swimmers recording "B"
times.
In the butterfly events, a sopho
more led the way for the Cardinal.
Olympian Dana Kirk finished sec
ond in the 200-yard distance in
both meets, missing first place by
the narrowest of margins. She re
bounded from a second-place fin
ish in the 100-yard butterfly on Fri
day to take first on Saturday. Three
of the four races were in NCAA
"B" times.
The diving team recorded three
victories in four events, two from
Rosenthal and one from sopho
more Cassidy Krug, who won the
one-meter contest against USC
with a career high score. In the
three-meter springboard, USC's
Hartley edged out Rosenthal and
Krug to take the top spot.
In one of its best outings of the
season, the Cardinal reached the
NCAA "A" standard three times,
all recorded by Bruce, and the "B"
standard an outstanding 24 times.
"I asked the team this weekend
fora total team effort," Quick said.
"I wanted our third and fourth
swimmers to be in at least the top
five or six in each of the races. I
thought against USC that hap
pened. Everyone felt the need to
be in the top six and, if you look at
the results, that happened."
