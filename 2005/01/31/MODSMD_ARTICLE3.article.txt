### MELISSA FUSCO 
The Peking University Performing Arts
Troupe kicked off its first U.S. tour with a per
formance in a packed Memorial Auditorium
Saturday afternoon.
The troupe's performance included dance,
chorus, orchestra and folk music, and it featured
performers from more than 20 departments and
schools within the university.
The group, which consists entirely of stu
dents, is touring the country to encourage cultur
al and artistic exchange between China and the
United States. Peking University and Stanford
have been educational collaborators for over 10
years, and the school is the site of Stanford's new
Beijing overseas program.
The performance was preceded by an intro
duction by University Provost John Etchemedy,
who welcomed Peking University president and
a delegation of other officials.
"We are confident that this fruitful coopera
tion will continue for many years to come, mir
roring the relationship between our two coun
tries," Etchemendy said. "We are proud to be
their first stop."
Etchemendy's speech was followed by
speeches and declarations of welcome from the
mayors of Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, Cupertino and
Millbrae, as well as salutations by the Chinese
Consul General of San Francisco and California
State Assemblyman Leland Yee.
Peking University President Xu Zhihong also
spoke briefly.
"Stanford University has a hist 017 of over 100
years," he said. "It has continued to develop it
self to become a leading university. Peking Uni
versity is a product of the 100 Days' Reform in
the later 19th century in China, and is an institu
tion of comparative prestige."
Highlights of the show included several opera
arias, a male a cappella ensemble, a Tibetan folk
dance and an instrumental ensemble of tradi-
