# Iraqi election called a success
## 
### BEA SANFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A large voter turnout and a
minimum of violence quieted in
ternational fears about Iraq's his
toric election as the polls closed
yesterday at 5 p.m. Iraq time, 6
a.m. Pacific Standard Time.
"The world is hearing the
voice of freedom from the center
of the Middle East," President
George W. Bush said in a White
House address given shortly after
the election. "Across Iraq today,
men and women have taken
rightful control of their country's
destiny, and they have chosen a
future of freedom and peace."
Election Day came after a
tense waiting period. Iraqi offi
cials closed bridges and borders
and enforced a 7 p.m. to 6 a.m.
curfew.
While the Iraqi National

Guard and police forces guarding
polling stations ensured the safe
ty of most voters, the day did not
pass without violence. Mortar at
tacks and suicide bombings led to
at least 44 deaths, according to
the Boston Globe.
Larry Diamond, professor of
political science and senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution, said
that the number of deaths was
"significantly lower than it might
have been. It- could have been
something much higher. It could
have been in the hundreds."
Diamond added, "It speaks to
the wisdom of security forces in
banning automobiles."
Despite the threat of danger,
voters flocked to the polls
dressed in their finest clothes.

told The New York Times. "After 35 years, we finally got
lid of Saddam and now we can vote for whoever we
want."
Fareed Ayar, chairman of the Independent Election
("ommission of Iraq, commented on the high turnout in
provinces with large Sunni populations such as Anbar
and Nineveh. Extra voting materials had to be brought in
to polling stations in Anbar to meet the high demand, ac
cording to The New York Times.
Prior to the election, many officials expressed concern
about Sunni turnout.
Although it seems that more Sunnis voted than ex
pected, Diamond said that the number would be "signif
icantly lower than the turnout of Shiites and Kurds."
The Sunnis "will be underrepresented in Parliament."
he said. "There needs to be a round-table dialogue to de
velop a compromise formula."
Diamond said this formula could include "a wide range
of groups in the constitution drafting."
While official numbers will not be available for nine
days, Ayar estimated a turnout of 8 million of the 14 mil
lion voters, reported The New York Times.
The large number of voters led Bush to call the elec
tion "a resounding success."
Whiie the president viewed the election as "a valida
tion of his broader foreign policy agenda," according to
The Washington Post, Diamond disagreed.
"I don't think we should be spreading liberty through
the point of a gun," he said. "I'm not sure if we have aval-

idation or anything, it's more of a validation of his broad
er point that peoples around the world want to live in
freedom and choose their leaders democratically."
Diamond said a successful election should mitigate
criticism directed at United States action in Iraq.
"A democratically-elected Iraq government should
modestly reduce international resistance to United
States policy," Diamond said when asked if the election
would increase international support for U.S. involve
ment.
"However, the big breakthrough will be when Iraq
becomes more stable and when U.S. troops start to with
draw," he added.
Enthusiasm over the election dimmed somewhat
when a transport plane carrying British officers crashed
25 miles north of Baghdad. At least nine officers were
killed, according to the BBC News, although the number
could rise to 15.
Both Prime Minister Tony Blair and Bush addressed
the losses.
"Some Iraqis were killed while exercising their
rights as citizens," Bush said. "We also mourn the
American and British military personnel who lost
their lives today. Their sacrifices were made in a vital
cause of freedom, peace in a troubled region and a
more secure future for us all."
Diamond will be giving a talk on the election at 7
p.m. today in Tresidder Oak West.
