# Iraqi election called a success
## 
### BEA SANFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A large voter turnout and a
minimum of violence quieted in
ternational fears about Iraq's his
toric election as the polls closed
yesterday at 5 p.m. Iraq time, 6
a.m. Pacific Standard Time.
"The world is hearing the
voice of freedom from the center
of the Middle East," President
George W. Bush said in a White
House address given shortly after
the election. "Across Iraq today,
men and women have taken
rightful control of their country's
destiny, and they have chosen a
future of freedom and peace."
Election Day came after a
tense waiting period. Iraqi offi
cials closed bridges and borders
and enforced a 7 p.m. to 6 a.m.
curfew.
While the Iraqi National

Guard and police forces guarding
polling stations ensured the safe
ty of most voters, the day did not
pass without violence. Mortar at
tacks and suicide bombings led to
at least 44 deaths, according to
the Boston Globe.
Larry Diamond, professor of
political science and senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution, said
that the number of deaths was
"significantly lower than it might
have been. It- could have been
something much higher. It could
have been in the hundreds."
Diamond added, "It speaks to
the wisdom of security forces in
banning automobiles."
Despite the threat of danger,
voters flocked to the polls
dressed in their finest clothes.
The New York Times reported.
"We now have our freedom,"
voter Aasim Muhammad Saleh
