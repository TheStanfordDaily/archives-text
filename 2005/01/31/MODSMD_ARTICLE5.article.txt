Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare
recently received the 2005 Wolf
Prize in Chemistry, a $100,000
award granted by the Israel-based
Wolf Foundation to only one per
son in the field each year.
Zare was recognized for his
work with laser techniques used
to identify intricate molecular
mechanisms.
"Zare's inventions and discov
eries have generated an impres
sive collection of new spectro
scopic tools, for scientific commu
nities investigating chemical dy
namics and studying biochemical

processes," according to the Wolf
Prize jury's press release.
"Of course I'm thrilled," Zare
said. "At the same time, with any
of these big awards there are so
many who deserve it. So honestly,
it's humbling."
This is not the first big award
Zare has received. The Wolf Prize
is one of the three most presti
gious awards in chemistry, along
with the Nobel Prize and the
Welch Prize, which Zare received
in 1999. These are only two of the
nine honors Zare has received for
his research.
The Wolf Prize does not focus
on a specific project and honors
Zare's lifetime achievements,

many of which involves the cre
ation of techniques to study nano
scale molecules and reactions.
These techniques serve as tools
for chemists worldwide, allowing
them to gain insight into the most
minute particles and chemical re
actions.
Zare was nominated for the
prize anonymously. He still does
not know the identity of the per
son who submitted his name, but
said he is very grateful to the per
son who took the time to recom
mend him.
