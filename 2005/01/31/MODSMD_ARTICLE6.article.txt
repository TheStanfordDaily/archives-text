# GCC pub delayed until April
## 
### ELAINE CHOI STAFF WRITER 
The grand opening of the gradu
ate student pub, initially slated for
this quarter, has been delayed until
mid-April.
Members of the Graduate Stu
dent Council hope that the complet
ed pub, located at the Graduate
Community Center in Escondido
Village, will foster interactions be
tween students from different de
partments.
Renovation problems are respon
sible for the delay, according to Mo
riah Thomason, chair of the GSC.
The kitchen was not equipped for
the type of operation the vendor
found necessary. The vendor re

quired an extensive upgrade to pro
vide higher quality food and service,
she said.
With the new renovations, the
vendor will be able to expand its op
erations in conjunction with Stan
ford Dining to provide food and bev
erage services. These changes will
require additional funding.
"Stanford University is support
ing the changes," Thomason said. "It
is seen as a valuable investment to
improve social interaction among
graduate students."
Thomason predicts that pub
business will boom upon its open
ing since students are already using
the space in the community center
to socialize.
"There are more graduate stu

dents on campus than at any other
major university," Thomason said.
"This is a great opportunity to create
a novel social dynamic among grad
students."
Currently, most graduate stu
dents socialize at restaurants and en
tertainment venues off campus.
"There will be a Mexican night in
one of the public spaces in the Rains
Houses, or Studio 1 will hold some
small event in the lounge," graduate
student Eran Magen said. "For big
ger things, people go off-campus to
the stupefying array of selections
that crazy Palo Alto has to offer."
Even though the programming
and activities offered through the
Graduate Community Center are
targeted toward graduate students,
undergraduates shouldn't feel un
welcome. Thomason said.
"It's more graduate student ori
ented but at the same time we don't
want to exclude anyone," she
added. "The grad students value
having a place that's their own."
Since the GSC Operations and
Steering Committee pitched the
idea for the pub, the focus has been
on creating the ideal facility.
"The vendor is very excited for
this pub," Thomason said. "He's
young and enthusiastic."
Students submitted names for
the pub in a contest held earlier in
the year, and the winner will be an
nounced soon before the opening.
