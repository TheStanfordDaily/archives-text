# Diamond speaks on elections
## Calls Iraqi voting a 'real beginning' for democracy 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The election in Iraq is over, and
by now most Stanford students have
heard about the unexpectedly high
voter turnout and seen the photos of
Iraqis proudly showing their ink
stained fingers. But might domestic
reactions to the election fall in line
with personal views on the wisdom
of U.S. policy in Iraq?
Not likely, says Political Science
Prof. Larry Diamond.
"I don't care whether you were for
the war or against the war, whether
you thought it was a good idea to
hold elections or whether you didn't,
you just can't be ambivalent about
what happened Sunday."
Diamond, also a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution, spoke
about the election at Tresidder last
night. He served as a senior advisor
to the Coalition Provisional Au
thority in Iraq from January to
April of last year and has written a
book about his experiences that
will be released in June.-
The talk was organized by the Soci
ety for International Affairs at Stanford.

Official results of voting will not
be released for another two weeks,
and Diamond speculated that it
would be at least two to three days be
fore anyone had "the faintest idea" of
the victors. Nonetheless, he said that
"no matter what happens," the elec
tion will be regarded as an important
historical moment in the histories of
Iraq and the Middle East.
Diamond called the images of
Iraqis casting ballots for the first
time in over fifty years "deeply mov
ing" and a "real beginning" in the
struggle for democracy in Iraq, but
he also had serious misgivings about
the security of the country.
"I believe that the insurgency is
going to explode again pretty fero
ciously, pretty soon," he said.
In the most emotional section of
his talk. Diamond raised his voice
and pounded on the podium with his
fist as he warned that Iraq would face
more prolonged violence unless
President George W. Bush gives up
on plans for permanent military
bases in Iraq.
"This, to my mind, is reallv, really

dumb," Diamond said about the
construction of military bases, which
he believes is already in progress.
Sunday's election will decide the
make-up of the 275 member transi
tional assembly that will be charged
with creating a permanent Iraqi
constitution. Diamond guessed that
that the assembly will meet in Bagh
dad for the first time by the end of
this month.
A few Stanford students with
Iraqi parents were eligible to vote.
Polling places were set up in five U.S.
cities, with Los Angeles being the
closest site to Stanford.
Junior Nora Salim and sopho
more Omar Shakir both could have
voted, but didn't. They both cited
the inconvenience of traveling to

Los Angeles two separate weekends
— first for registration, then to cast
a ballot — as their reason for miss
ing the vote.
But Salim said that her parents,
who are originally from Baghdad,
but live in Sun Valley, Calif., made
the drive to Los Angeles last week
end in order to participate. She said
that none of her remaining relatives
in Baghdad went to the polls because
they felt the threats of violence made
voting too dangerous.
But as national media have re
ported, many Iraqis made it to the
polls anyway.
Owing to the apparent success of
the election, Diamond predicted
that Bush would receive a "signifi
cant. temporary boost" in popularity

in the United States, and that the
president would try to "milk" that
success in Thursday's State of the
Union address.
Diamond has been very open
with his criticism of the U.S.-led in
vasion of Iraq in 2003. He is consid
ered an expert on the efforts to cre
ate democracy in Iraq.
By the time he got to the podium
at Tresidder last night, he had al
ready provided analysis for several
media outlets, including the Los An
geles Times.
At one point, Diamond seemed to
forget how much time had passed
since the election.
"Was it yesterday? I feel like I've
lived through this a week already,"
he said.
