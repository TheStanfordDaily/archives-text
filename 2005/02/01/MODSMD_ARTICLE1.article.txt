# Diamond speaks on elections
## Calls Iraqi voting a 'real beginning' for democracy 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The election in Iraq is over, and
by now most Stanford students have
heard about the unexpectedly high
voter turnout and seen the photos of
Iraqis proudly showing their ink
stained fingers. But might domestic
reactions to the election fall in line
with personal views on the wisdom
of U.S. policy in Iraq?
Not likely, says Political Science
Prof. Larry Diamond.
"I don't care whether you were for
the war or against the war, whether
you thought it was a good idea to
hold elections or whether you didn't,
you just can't be ambivalent about
what happened Sunday."
Diamond, also a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution, spoke
about the election at Tresidder last
night. He served as a senior advisor
to the Coalition Provisional Au
thority in Iraq from January to
April of last year and has written a
book about his experiences that
will be released in June.-
The talk was organized by the Soci
ety for International Affairs at Stanford.

Official results of voting will not
be released for another two weeks,
and Diamond speculated that it
would be at least two to three days be
fore anyone had "the faintest idea" of
the victors. Nonetheless, he said that
"no matter what happens," the elec
tion will be regarded as an important
historical moment in the histories of
Iraq and the Middle East.
Diamond called the images of
Iraqis casting ballots for the first
time in over fifty years "deeply mov
ing" and a "real beginning" in the
struggle for democracy in Iraq, but
he also had serious misgivings about
the security of the country.
"I believe that the insurgency is
going to explode again pretty fero
ciously, pretty soon," he said.
In the most emotional section of
his talk. Diamond raised his voice
and pounded on the podium with his
fist as he warned that Iraq would face
more prolonged violence unless
President George W. Bush gives up
on plans for permanent military
bases in Iraq.
"This, to my mind, is reallv, really
