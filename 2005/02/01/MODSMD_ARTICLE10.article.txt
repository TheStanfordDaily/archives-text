On Feb. 1, 1968, The Daily covered a
story about third year medical students re
fusing to sign their final exams until the
course improved. Below is an excerpt:
"Nearly one-third of the third-year
medical students refused to sign their
final examination in Community Health
last quarter in hopes of improving the
course.
"The action of 20 of the 67 students
taking the course came after a letter,
signed by 60 of the students, was sent to
the department of preventative medi
cine. The letter expressed discontent
with the structure and content of the re
quired course.
"'We felt that there was inadequate
response to our letter,' explained one of
the students who didn't sign his exam.
'We felt we couldn't let this course be
passed on to another class without im
provement.'
. "He felt that the course 'lacked ade
quate consideration to relevant prob
lems of community health." He explained
that the course dealt mainly with epi
demiology (epidemics) and lacked inclu
sion of problems of drug addiction,
smoking, and alcoholism.
"The students who refused to sign
their names to the exams received in
completes in Community Health. The
Department of Preventive Medicine,
which administrates the course with a va
riety of lecturers, has not made any state
ment regarding makeup requirements."

On Feb. 1, 1935, The Daily ran a story
about the Stanford humor publication
Chaparral receiving an award from the
Univ. of Arizona's Kitty-Kat feature mag
azine. Below is an excerpt:
"Further honors have been accorded
Chaparral, Stanford's famous humor
magazine. In the January Contemporary
Comics Issue of the Arizona Kitty-Kat,
received at Chappie office yesterday,
Chaparral is placed at t he top of the list of
'the first ten leading comics, based upon
all-around ability."
"Chappie circles were quite agog last
week, when a copy of the temple Owl ar
rived with news that the local publication
had won first prize for the best humor of
the 1(X) college comics considered.
"'With this news Chappie circles have
certainly slipped agog,' said Editor Gor
don Steedman. 'Of course we think the
Chappie is OK, but what is our opinion
compared to so many more competent
critics?'
"In awarding first place, the Kitty Kat
mewed: The Stanford Chapparal, to our
notion, occupies first place in the field,
Steedman was faced with the tremen
dous task this year of filling the shoes of
his artist-predecessor, Jim Algar. New
artists, gagmen, and feature writers seem
to be fairly flooding the Stanford cam
pus. With a large staff, splendid art work
and nice make-up, Steedman's book is
outstanding."'
