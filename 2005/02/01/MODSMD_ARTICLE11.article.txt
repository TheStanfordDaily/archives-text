# Taherian named executive director of Stanford Dining
## 
### LITAO 
After serving as associate direc
tor of residential dining for six
years, Rafi Taherian officially re
placing former executive director
of dining, Nadeem Siddiqui, on
Jan. 14.
"I received a letter from Shirley
Everett [associate vice proyost for
residential & dining enterprises] on
Dec. 17,'" Taherian said. "It is a privi
lege working with her in a permanent
position to help fulfill her vision."
Taherian said his main objective
is to make the University "the best in
the industry and to continue provid
ing exceptional customer service to
Stanford students, faculty and staff."
During his term as acting direc
tor of dining, Taherian met with
students and Stanford stakehold
ers often on a daily basis. A typical
day involved visiting several of the
20 on-campus dining facilities.
In his new role, Taherian will
expand upon these responsibilities.
"Being executive director will
allow me to work on strategic initia
tives. including dining hall and meal
plan enhancements, green business
initiatives and sustainability and effi
cient use of technology to provide

better service to students and other
customers," he said.
Taherian described several new
goals he hopes to accomplish in the
near future.
"We are working with several
student leadership groups to sim
plify the meal plans and give stu
dents more choices and more value
for upcoming years," he said. "One
of Stanford Dining's long-term
projects is to develop online access
to our menus, recipes and other nu
tritional information."
In addition, Taherian is working
with Stanford Student Enterprise
group to enable students to view
and change their meal plans online.
"Another goal is sustainability,"
he said. "A primary objective is to
reduce waste, which comes in many
different forms: energy, water,
food, non-reusable materials and
other non-renewable resources."
Taherian added that he believes
it is unconscionable to waste food
and hopes to encourage dining hall
managers to reduce leftovers.
"When we have leftovers, how
ever, we work closely with SPOON
to ensure the good food can still be
consumed," he said. The SPOON
program takes leftover food from

dining halls and delivers it to local
food pantries.
Overall, Taherian said he hopes
to improve the quality of the
15,000 meals Stanford Dining
serves each dav.
