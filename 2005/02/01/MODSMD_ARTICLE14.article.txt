# Social Innovation
## Have your cake and eat it too 
### 
Stanford students want to change
the world — even if they don't always
admit it. Freshmen arrive knowing all
the privileges they've been given, and
seniors leave wanting to show that
their Stanford experience wasn't just
all about getting that job at the end.
But at the same time, there's an
idea out there that subverts these
good intentions: If you want to make
a change, you have to work fora non
profit organization. Non-profits are
good for social change, but bad for the
bank; for-profits are good for the
bank, but bad for social change.
This is wrong. Non-profits don't
always improve society, and for-prof
its don't always make things worse.

Non-profits
can cause
more prob
lems for the
world or
just waste
money and
resources.
For-profits
can address
social prob
lems with
new prod
ucts and
policies.
It's true
that non
profits have
"social"
goals and

for-profits have "economic" goals.
And it's also true students who gravi
tate to non-profits tend to have differ
ent motivations than those who are
attracted to for-profits.
But intentions are one thing and
results are another.
It's not enough that someone
wants to help disadvantaged kids by
starting a tutoring program. Or that
someone wants to make millions writ
ing computer software. One is not
necessarily "socially" better than the
other.The question isn't "what kind of
organization is it?" but rather "what
does it do?" We should be asking: Is it
actually helping people? Is it working
efficiently? Is it sustainable?
These realizations drive new, inno
vative ideas for social change. It's the
realization that everyone, in all sec
tors, can contribute to social change.
The key is to recognize that non
profits and for-profits share core fea
tures. We've been too quick to see the
two as opposites: tree-huggers and
frat-boys, justice and self-interest,
Seth and Luke. But for all their differ
ences, they both share the goal of uti
lizing their resources in new and
effective ways.
Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield
wanted to make ice cream, but they
also cared about the local community,
the environment and social causes.
The Body Shop was founded with the
hopes of bringing nature-inspired
products to socially and environmen
tally-minded consumers. Working
Assets, a communications and credit
card service provider, is "making it
easy to make a difference," and they
have donated over $46 million to pro
gressive causes.
Then there's "corporate social
responsibility." Multinational compa
nies. the wise ones at least, are taking
huge steps to use their global pres
ence and power to address social
needs.
While there is still much to be done
on this front, companies like Gap, Inc.
have grown in a positive direction
over the last decade. The market for
socially-friendly products is growing
fast.
All of these examples are situated
within what we call "social innova
tion." Social innovation includes the
new approaches, the new models the
new ideas that are being born to
address social problems. And these
solutions span all sectors — nonprof
it, for-profit and public.
It's an old moral: "The road to hell
is paved with good intentions." It's
results, not just motivations, that mat
ter. It's what you do, and what it does,
that change the world.
Stanford students want to make a
change in the world. But whatever
sector they join, it's only the first step.
For-profit, non-profit or otherwise,
social innovations can make the world
a better place.

Stanford students want to change
the world — even if they don't always
admit it. Freshmen arrive knowing all
the privileges they've been given, and
seniors leave wanting to show that
their Stanford experience wasn't just
all about getting that job at the end.
But at the same time, there's an
idea out there that subverts these
good intentions: If you want to make
a change, you have to work fora non
profit organization. Non-profits are
good for social change, but bad for the
bank; for-profits are good for the
bank, but bad for social change.
This is wrong. Non-profits don't
always improve society, and for-prof
its don't always make things worse.

Non-profits
can cause
more prob
lems for the
world or
just waste
money and
resources.
For-profits
can address
social prob
lems with
new prod
ucts and
policies.
It's true
that non
profits have
"social"
goals and

for-profits have "economic" goals.
And it's also true students who gravi
tate to non-profits tend to have differ
ent motivations than those who are
attracted to for-profits.
But intentions are one thing and
results are another.
It's not enough that someone
wants to help disadvantaged kids by
starting a tutoring program. Or that
someone wants to make millions writ
ing computer software. One is not
necessarily "socially" better than the
other.The question isn't "what kind of
organization is it?" but rather "what
does it do?" We should be asking: Is it
actually helping people? Is it working
efficiently? Is it sustainable?
These realizations drive new, inno
vative ideas for social change. It's the
realization that everyone, in all sec
tors, can contribute to social change.
The key is to recognize that non
profits and for-profits share core fea
tures. We've been too quick to see the
two as opposites: tree-huggers and
frat-boys, justice and self-interest,
Seth and Luke. But for all their differ
ences, they both share the goal of uti
lizing their resources in new and
effective ways.
Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield
wanted to make ice cream, but they
also cared about the local community,
the environment and social causes.
The Body Shop was founded with the
hopes of bringing nature-inspired
products to socially and environmen
tally-minded consumers. Working
Assets, a communications and credit
card service provider, is "making it
easy to make a difference," and they
have donated over $46 million to pro
gressive causes.
Then there's "corporate social
responsibility." Multinational compa
nies. the wise ones at least, are taking
huge steps to use their global pres
ence and power to address social
needs.
While there is still much to be done
on this front, companies like Gap, Inc.
have grown in a positive direction
over the last decade. The market for
socially-friendly products is growing
fast.
All of these examples are situated
within what we call "social innova
tion." Social innovation includes the
new approaches, the new models the
new ideas that are being born to
address social problems. And these
solutions span all sectors — nonprof
it, for-profit and public.
It's an old moral: "The road to hell
is paved with good intentions." It's
results, not just motivations, that mat
ter. It's what you do, and what it does,
that change the world.
Stanford students want to make a
change in the world. But whatever
sector they join, it's only the first step.
For-profit, non-profit or otherwise,
social innovations can make the world
a better place.
