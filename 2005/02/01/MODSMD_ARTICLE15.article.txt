## Much-anticipated iPod shuffle hits stores 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
You wanted one for Christmas, but nei
ther your parents nor Santa Claus knew.
You tried again for your birthday, but your
hints were overlooked. The iPod seemed
just out of your reach — it was too expen
sive, or it was always sold out.
Now consumers have another option.
Earlier this month, Apple Computer, Inc.
introduced the much-anticipated iPod
shuffle. Marketed by Apple as the "official
soundtrack to random revolution," the
iPod shuffle comes in two sizes — 512M8
and IGB. Fora retail price of $99, the 512
MB shuffle holds 120 songs. At $149, the 1
GB shuffle holds 240 songs.
Just three weeks into its release, the
shuffle has already generated a lot of
excitement. According to Raymond Raza,
a customer service specialist at Fry's
Electronics in Palo Alto, the iPod shuffle
has not yet arrived at the electronics store,
but people are calling everyday to check if
it is in stock.
"We're getting a lot of calls, and we're
not sure when Apple will be sending its
shipment to us," Raza said.
Why all the talk? What's the difference
between the iPod and the iPod shuffle?
The iPod shuffle promotes random song
selection. After uploading music from
Apple iTUnes onto the shuffle, it plays the
user's songs in a different order each time
the device is used. It's a constant surprise.
Of course, there are exceptions. For
people who don't like random ordering,
the iPod shuffle will permit users to play
from specific playlists, and it has a "Play in
Order" mode.
For the technologically challenged user,
the iPod shuffle might be a good choice.

While the iPod and the iPod mini come
with Fire Wires and USB cables that can
get tricky for those who find computers
daunting, the iPod shuffle plugs directly
into the USB port on most computers —
no additional wires necessary.
For people constantly on the run —
namely fitness-buffs and joggers — the
iPod shuffle is the new "it" gadget. Smaller
than a pack of gum and less than an ounce
in weight, the shuffle is lightweight and
sleek enough to fit in the palm of one's
hand or in a back pocket.
For an extra $29, consumers can even
keep the shuffle clipped to a secure arm
band that fits snugly around the wrist for
greater convenience. Another $29 will pur
chase the iPod shuffle Sport Case. This
clear case is attached to a bright lanyard
that will effectively shield one's music
from bright sun, dirt and rain.
However, some users are not so gung
ho about the new iPod product.
"Think function over fashion," said
freshman Bradley Neil Pereira. "Sure, the
iPod shuffle is cute, but the iPod and iPod
mini have the ability to hold many more
songs — and that's what you're paying for,
aren't you?"
Fellow freshman Wahl thought
about purchasing an iPod shuffle but is
now reconsidering after careful research.
While Apple is advertising the shuffle as
the "unpredictable new iPod," Wahl sees
right through the company's marketing
strategy.
"When you think about the bang for
your buck, you want something that will
allow you to listen to the songs you want to
listen to," Wahl said. "Yes, the shuffle is
cheaper and smaller, but it's not economi
cally advantageous."
Similar products have been on the mar

ket for years, but Apple has a competitive
edge because of iPod's name recognition.
After the overwhelming popularity of the
iPod and iPod mini, Apple is riding high on
the coattails of its past products.

Will the iPod shuffle sell? It seems to
have generated enough excitement, but
only time will tell.

no additional wires necessary.
For people constantly on the run —
namely fitness-buffs and joggers — the
iPod shuffle is the new "it" gadget. Smaller
than a pack of gum and less than an ounce
in weight, the shuffle is lightweight and
sleek enough to fit in the palm of one's
hand or in a back pocket.
For an extra $29, consumers can even
keep the shuffle clipped to a secure arm
band that fits snugly around the wrist for
greater convenience. Another $29 will pur
chase the iPod shuffle Sport Case. This
clear case is attached to a bright lanyard
that will effectively shield one's music
from bright sun, dirt and rain.
However, some users are not so gung
ho about the new iPod product.
"Think function over fashion," said
freshman Bradley Neil Pereira. "Sure, the
iPod shuffle is cute, but the iPod and iPod
mini have the ability to hold many more
songs — and that's what you're paying for,
aren't you?"
Fellow freshman Wahl thought
about purchasing an iPod shuffle but is
now reconsidering after careful research.
While Apple is advertising the shuffle as
the "unpredictable new iPod," Wahl sees
right through the company's marketing
strategy.
"When you think about the bang for
your buck, you want something that will
allow you to listen to the songs you want to
listen to," Wahl said. "Yes, the shuffle is
cheaper and smaller, but it's not economi
cally advantageous."
Similar products have been on the mar

ket for years, but Apple has a competitive
edge because of iPod's name recognition.
After the overwhelming popularity of the
iPod and iPod mini, Apple is riding high on
the coattails of its past products.

Will the iPod shuffle sell? It seems to
have generated enough excitement, but
only time will tell.
