## Rocket scientists make candle wax into fuel

What do candle wax and rocket fuel have
in common?
Paraffin wax may eventually serve as the
fuel for launching rockets into space, thanks
to research done by Aeronautics and
Astronautics Profs. Brian Cantwell and
Mustafa Arif Karabeyoglu. Paraffin, which
is used for making candles, is a safer, cheap
er and more environmentally friendly alter
native to traditional liquid or solid-phase
rocket fuels.
The idea of using paraffin wax in rocket
fuel first came to Karabeyoglu in 1995,
when he was a Ph.D. student at Stanford.
The first use of a paraffin fuel took place in
November 1998. Since then, more than 260
tests of paraffin-fueled motors have taken
place, with loads of up to 2,500 pounds.
"We expect the first direct use of the fuel
to be to power a fly-back sounding rocket
demonstration vehicle in the next year or
so," Cantwell said.
Paraffin is one of the latest materials to
be tested for use in hybrid rocket launch
systems; doing so mitigates the danger and
cost of typical solid or liquid rocket fuels.
In solid systems, the oxidizer, which aids
burning, is included in a composite with the
fuel. TTie result is a dangerously volatile
fuel, which may explode in shipping. Solid
fuels also release toxic and environmental
ly-damaging chemicals when burnt and can
not be stopped once ignited.
Liquid systems, on the other hand, keep
the oxidizer and fuel in separate tanks. They
mix and burn in a rocket chamber, and the
valves through which they flow allow for
greater control of fuel ignition and rocket
launch. These systems, however, are expen
sive and still highly explosive.
Alternatively, hybrid systems reduce the
danger of both solid and liquid rocket fuels
by keeping only solid fuel in the rocket
chamber and using just one set of valves to
force oxidizer over the surface of the fuel,
where it ignites. However, since the fuel
must evaporate to mix with the oxidizer, the
burning process is generally slower. The
resulting lower thrust explains why hybrid
rocket engines generally have not been used
commercially, though they have been
researched fora long time.
The first sign of a solution to the thrust
problem of hybrid rocket fuels came in
1995, when the U.S. Air Force found that
hybrid fuels burned three or four times
faster than normal fuels in tests of frozen
pentane. Karabeyoglu and David Altman, a
consulting professor in the Aeronautics and

Astronautics Department, were uncon
vinced by the Air Force's explanation that
the results were due to the lower heat need
to gasify pentane.
Instead. Karabeyoglu delved into chem
istry and physics literature and developed a
model that showed a thin, unstable layer of
liquid pentane forming over the solid mate
rial. This layer forms waves, which are then
picked up in droplets that evaporate and

burn, as the oxidizer blows over the surface.
"It was a brilliant achievement to make
such a degree of progress on such a hard
problem," Cantwell said.
Given an understanding of how the
frozen pentane produced such remarkable
results, Karabeyoglu set out to find other
materials similar to pentane but that existed
as a solid at room temperature.
As Cantwell explained, "No one is going

to build a practical launch system that
requires the fuel to be put into a cryogenic
deep freeze before launch."
Though seemingly an unlikely source of
fuel, Karabeyoglu found that paraffin had
precisely the same physical characteristics
that made frozen pentane a great rocket
fuel. While paraffin wax is not the only
material that could make hybrid rocket
engines work, it seemed to be the best.
"Other possible alternatives include
Naphthalene and Anthracene, but no other
candidate offers the high-energy content,
low cost, ease of use and environmentally
benign characteristics of paraffin," Cantwell
said.
Since the discovery, Karabeyoglu and
Cantwell have been busy testing systems
using paraffin wax as a fuel to determine its
usability for rocket launching. Gaseous oxy
gen, liquid oxygen and nitrous oxide have
all been used as oxidizers in their tests.
Thrust levels between 50 and 2,500
pounds have been reached so far, and they
plan to scale â€” up to 6,000 to 10,000 pounds
in the coming year. They have been collabo
rating with NASA, who has helped fund the
test program and has provided the facilities
to test rockets at larger thrust levels.
"These tests have enabled us to define
the burning characteristics of the fuel over a
range of motor chamber pressure and oxy
gen flow rate that encompasses the range of
conditions that would be encountered in an
operational system including a large launch
system," Cantwell said.
Meanwhile, Karabeyoglu has been head
ing the Space Propulsion Group, Inc., which
has been working with aerospace compa
nies to consider the commercial feasibility
of paraffin fuels in satellite launching sys
tems.
"While there are many identifiable per
formance benefits including reduced weight
and increased delivered impulse we really
expect the long-term benefit to be substan
tial reductions in cost as well as much sim
pler, safer operations," Cantwell said.
And the potential for paraffin wax does
n't stop at launching rockets. Cantwell
pointed out that the program has been con
tacted by producers of large airbags and by
steel companies. He noted that paraffin
fuels could be used in the melting of scrap
steel, particularly in developing countries,
where it could be much easier to obtain than
the typically-used fuel of natural gas.
"There are many possible commercial
applications fora safe, low-cost gas genera
tor which is essentially what a hybrid rocket
motor is." Cantwell said.
