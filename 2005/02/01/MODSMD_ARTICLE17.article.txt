## Editor's Note The
						editorial board: who we are 
### 
Last Monday, we put out a call for applications to
our editorial board. There were some great appli
cants, but I also received a lot of e-mails that went
something like this: "Uh ... what does the board do
again?"
So here's who we are.
There are eight people on The Daily's editorial
board — the editorial editor (that's me), the deputy
editor, two staff writers and four community mem
bers at large. We meet once a week to discuss issues
of import to our readership (that's you) and try to
formulate intelligent, informed opinions that pro
voke thought and action. While the editor in chief
has final say over what we print, the board basically
runs independently of the rest of the paper.
The editorials are written by individuals, but they
represent a consensus or super-majority of the
board's views; that's why the pieces aren't signed.
You might even say that the editorial board is The
Daily's "official voice."
I don't necessarily want you to agree with us, but
I hope that you read our work and take what we say
seriously. Even if you only read to point out all the
ways in which the editorial is misguided and poorly
argued, at least you're paying attention to what we
have to say.
This is the inaugural week of a new board, and of
yours truly as editorial editor. You won't be seeing
any big changes, but I'll keep working to make edi
torials — not to mention the rest of the Opinions
pages — even more readable and provocative.
I have my own biases. I'd describe myself as po
litically progressive; yes, this is my third year living
in Columbae, and yes, I did serve a brief, brief stint
as the president of the Stanford Greens. But I'd like
to think that my agenda, if I have one, is to make our
editorials a voice for student interests at a universi
ty where those interests are not always taken very
seriously.
I'm going to be handling administrative duties
and guiding the discussion, but when it comes to vot
ing and writing. I'm just another member of the
board. I lere are the others;
During the first quarter of community member
Theodora Chang's freshman year, she decided not to
apply for any writing positions at The Daily because
she thought she was burned out from working for her
high school newspaper — Gunn's The Oracle — and
thought she needed a break. A year later, she misses
writing and the hectic newspaper-staff life. Theodo
ra has always been particularly interested in hearing
the opinions of those who might not usually express
them, and she enjoys providing a way in which this
can be achieved.
Amy Keith, a community member, has no inter
est in changing the world. She says she is not a revo
lutionary, but is passionate about information, about
informing the world about what is going on beyond
the line of sight. Amy, who is finishing her tenure as

the managing editor of The Real News, welcomes
the opportunity to write about issues that concern
the communities that she represents and thus make
them issues that concern a larger, increasingly in
formed public.
Alice Kim, the deputy editorial editor, is a senior
majoring in Science, Technology and Society. She
smacks me down when I step out of line.
Michael Miller, one of our staff writers, has
worked as a writer and news editor for two years. As
he has covered everything from student activism to
crime, he's learned that great ideas and interesting
angles are not always the first ones presented, and
that stories don't usually have exactly two sides.
With the editorial page, The Daily has the opportu
nity to explain which side is more logical or reason
able from a reporter's perspective — and that side
may not be what readers think it is.
Through community member Joey Natoli's vari
ous roles on campus, he has seen the importance of
Daily editorials in guiding the Stanford community.
More importantly, he feels that his experiences as
ASSIJ vice president, chair of Absolute Fun and
member of various University committees give him
a knowledge base to be a valuable member of the
editorial board.
Nick Parker, one of our staff writers, is a fresh
man interested in the humanities. He's from New
York City and has always loved journalism. Both of
his parents were journalists — his dad was editor in
chief of The Daily in 1%2 — and he's proud to follow
in their footsteps. Nick was the ASSU beat writer for
Vol. 226, and he joined the editorial board because
he would rather write subjectively than objectively,
and because he wanted a little variety at The Daily.
Wenkai Tay, one of our community members, is
a freshman thinking of majoring in chemical engi
neering. He has been involved in writing and editing
since high school and has also had his writing pub
lished in several print and online publications. He
believes that the editorial board has a responsibility
to create thoughtful dialogue among students about
campus issues. He is concerned with housing and ad
vising policies that affect the freshman population
and is committed to promoting greater cost-con
sciousness among Stanford students.
And even with all of these members, we still can't
represent everyone on the Stanford community. If
we mess up. let us know. If there's something we
should write about but haven't, let us know. I look
forward to hearing from you.
