## It's a Friendly Prison 
### 
Okay, so I lied. Last week wasn't
my last column. And this may not
be either. (I'm applying to be one

for Vol. 227.)
Still, at least I
have some
statistics as a re
sult of my re
quest.
Apparently I
don't have seven
readers. 1 have
six. Yes that's
right, in re
sponse to my re
quest for all my

readers to e-mail me I collected a
sextet of messages in my inbox.
While a little disappointing, it's
not particularly surprising. Alter
all. with so many other exciting
things to do in Palo Alto, who has
time to read the paper?
Of course, if anybody could be
expected to be a regular reader it
would be a member of The Daily's
staff. So for reassurance I did some
field research.
The Daily banquet (though I'm
not sure the word "banquet" is ap
propriate if there's no whole roast
pig sitting on the table, with apple in
mouth) took place on Friday. Inter
esting experience.
It was the first time I found my
self interacting (and I use the word
loosely) with undergraduates since
I got to the Farm. Unfortunately, it
appears that this is not a skill that
perseveres under the steady assault
of graduate school on one's social
graces.
Needless to say, after such a fee
ble performance I've been wonder
ing where the charm and ease have
gone. I see two possible solutions.
One, either we never had it in

the first place or two, grad school
has somehow leeched from lis the
ability to interact. I'm leaning to
wards the second option. And I
think I have an answer.
Itl's all about open doors. You
see, back in the halcyon days of
youth, when we had neither a 13 nor
an A to put after our names we
would not shut ourselves off from
the world.
Remember how you could walk
along the halls of your undergrad
dorm and glance into every room.
Remember how people would say
hello when they were walking past.
Remember how every door was
propped open.
Now, however, it's like living in
a prison. Albeit a friendly, coopera
tive prison, but a prison all the
same. Walk through the corridor of
one of studios or the EV tower
blocks and every door is shut. Hard
ly a sound is being made. It's a per
petual state of lockdown.
Actually, it's much worse than
that. At least in jail you don't have a
choice. Here at Stanford, though,
it's a self-imposed incarceration.
Everybody chooses to trap them
selves in their own little bubble.
Of course one could point out
that the same could be said of the
real world. After all, if you walk
down the back streets of Palo Alto
the houses don't welcome you with
open entryways.
However, we don't live in the
real world. We live on a university
campus. We go to classes. We pre
tend to be poor. We hold impracti
cal and unfeasible political views. In
short, we're students. Anu as stu
dents, we need a new door policy.
The Graduate Student Council
spends a lot of time creating ever

more inventive (and tedious)
events in order to stave off the im
pression that life here is a little dull
and also in order to facilitate social
ising.
This obviously fails, so instead I
suggest the following new idea.
Doorstops. Give every grad student
a doorstop and watch the people
talk.
In fact, I'm declaring this week
"Open Door Week." Whenever
you're at home from now until Sun
day prop your door open (it does
occur to me that given the data on
my readership this may not be a
widespread phenomenon, but I live
in hope).
Since it may take some time for
the doorstop rollout to take place
let me suggest a (temporary) home
made version. Just fold up your
copy of The Daily and wedge it
under the door — you see how ver
satile the paper can be.
Open doors aren't enough by
themselves though. We need inter
action as well. Remember, an un
filled doorframe is an invitation to
stop in and say hello. Spread the
love.
There are, of course, some
downsides with this brilliant plan.
Occasionally someone will get
upset at your choice of music /
cooking/late night drinking game
and complain. But really that's part
of the fun — after all. if they're
complaining, at least they're talking
to you.

Unsure of how best to fold the
paper for use as a doorstop ? Don 7 e
tnail, come by to Rains 2 IS, Apt. 20V
instead. The door will he open.

a prison. Albeit a friendly, coopera
tive prison, but a prison all the
same. Walk through the corridor of
one of studios or the EV tower
blocks and every door is shut. Hard
ly a sound is being made. It's a per
petual state of lockdown.
Actually, it's much worse than
that. At least in jail you don't have a
choice. Here at Stanford, though,
it's a self-imposed incarceration.
Everybody chooses to trap them
selves in their own little bubble.
Of course one could point out
that the same could be said of the
real world. After all, if you walk
down the back streets of Palo Alto
the houses don't welcome you with
open entryways.
However, we don't live in the
real world. We live on a university
campus. We go to classes. We pre
tend to be poor. We hold impracti
cal and unfeasible political views. In
short, we're students. Anu as stu
dents, we need a new door policy.
The Graduate Student Council
spends a lot of time creating ever

more inventive (and tedious)
events in order to stave off the im
pression that life here is a little dull
and also in order to facilitate social
ising.
This obviously fails, so instead I
suggest the following new idea.
Doorstops. Give every grad student
a doorstop and watch the people
talk.
In fact, I'm declaring this week
"Open Door Week." Whenever
you're at home from now until Sun
day prop your door open (it does
occur to me that given the data on
my readership this may not be a
widespread phenomenon, but I live
in hope).
Since it may take some time for
the doorstop rollout to take place
let me suggest a (temporary) home
made version. Just fold up your
copy of The Daily and wedge it
under the door — you see how ver
satile the paper can be.
Open doors aren't enough by
themselves though. We need inter
action as well. Remember, an un
filled doorframe is an invitation to
stop in and say hello. Spread the
love.
There are, of course, some
downsides with this brilliant plan.
Occasionally someone will get
upset at your choice of music /
cooking/late night drinking game
and complain. But really that's part
of the fun — after all. if they're
complaining, at least they're talking
to you.

Unsure of how best to fold the
paper for use as a doorstop ? Don 7 e
tnail, come by to Rains 2 IS, Apt. 20V
instead. The door will he open.

Okay, so I lied. Last week wasn't
my last column. And this may not
be either. (I'm applying to be one

for Vol. 227.)
Still, at least I
have some
statistics as a re
sult of my re
quest.
Apparently I
don't have seven
readers. 1 have
six. Yes that's
right, in re
sponse to my re
quest for all my

readers to e-mail me I collected a
sextet of messages in my inbox.
While a little disappointing, it's
not particularly surprising. Alter
all. with so many other exciting
things to do in Palo Alto, who has
time to read the paper?
Of course, if anybody could be
expected to be a regular reader it
would be a member of The Daily's
staff. So for reassurance I did some
field research.
The Daily banquet (though I'm
not sure the word "banquet" is ap
propriate if there's no whole roast
pig sitting on the table, with apple in
mouth) took place on Friday. Inter
esting experience.
It was the first time I found my
self interacting (and I use the word
loosely) with undergraduates since
I got to the Farm. Unfortunately, it
appears that this is not a skill that
perseveres under the steady assault
of graduate school on one's social
graces.
Needless to say, after such a fee
ble performance I've been wonder
ing where the charm and ease have
gone. I see two possible solutions.
One, either we never had it in

the first place or two, grad school
has somehow leeched from lis the
ability to interact. I'm leaning to
wards the second option. And I
think I have an answer.
Itl's all about open doors. You
see, back in the halcyon days of
youth, when we had neither a 13 nor
an A to put after our names we
would not shut ourselves off from
the world.
Remember how you could walk
along the halls of your undergrad
dorm and glance into every room.
Remember how people would say
hello when they were walking past.
Remember how every door was
propped open.
Now, however, it's like living in
a prison. Albeit a friendly, coopera
tive prison, but a prison all the
same. Walk through the corridor of
one of studios or the EV tower
