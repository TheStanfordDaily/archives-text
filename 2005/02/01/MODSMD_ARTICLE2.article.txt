# Faculty question calendar changes
## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
For the 2005-2006 academic year
Thanksgiving break will start at the
beginning of the week to accommo
date students who must miss classes
to travel home for the holiday, a
change that has sparked controver
sy after it was presented at a recent
Faculty Senate meeting.
Although the Faculty Senate ap
proved the registrar and provost's
decision to test this change, several
faculty members disapproved of the
way the issue was handled during the
most recent meeting.
"The proposal was brought up
not as a motion, but as an an
nouncement by the provost," said
English Prof. Robert Polhemus,
chair of the Faculty Senate. "This
caught many people off guard and
raised certain controversies over
the issue."
Polhemus explained that the
Faculty Senate did not have an offi

cial vote on the matter. The regis
trar asked the senate to vote infor
mally, which Polhemus noted, is
not binding.
The Faculty Senate will hold a
formal vote next winter to decide
whether or not to permanently
change the academic calendar.
"Since the issue was brought to
the Senate in such an irregular man
ner. people were displeased," Polhe
mus said. "It would have been better
if we had had more time to discuss
the issue, but I doubt that the results
would have been different."
Robert Simoni. professor of Bio
logical Sciences and member of the
Faculty Senate, on the other hand,
was happy with the way the issue
was discussed.
"It's my understanding that this
is an administrative issue and no
faculty vote is required for the
changes to pass," he said. "1 think
we should give credit to the provost
and registrar for even bringing the
issue to the senate."

Applied Physics Prof. Malcolm
Beasley agreed.
"The provost brought up the
issue and this led to a good discus
sion about the effects it would have
on the faculty and the students," he
said. "Changes to the calendar, re
gardless of how they are brought up,
will cause trouble."
Other faculty members said they
were worried about the temporary
nature of the proposal.
"I was concerned that the provost
said we would try this new calendar
for one year," Beasley said. "If we
change the calendar now, the worst
thing we can do is change it again
next year."
The short notice given to the fac
ulty about these changes caused fur
ther controversy, since several acad
emic departments have already
planned events and retreats for the
following year.
"Our department plans around
the academic calendar, so we ex
pect it to be set," Simoni said. "We

only get six months notice before
these changes come into place and
that's not enough time to re
arrange our schedule."
Overall, the Faculty Senate re
sponded positively to the new calen
dar proposal, and a majority said
they were in favor of the changes
during the informal vote.
"Attendance during the days be
fore Thanksgiving break has always
been poor and many classes are usual
ly cancelled," Simoni said. "This is an
honest attempt to fix that problem."
Although he was not happy with
the way that the issue was brought up
at the meeting, Polhemus was equal
ly enthusiastic about the proposal.
"Some people might be against
the changes in the schedule, but it's a
small minority of the faculty and an
even smaller minority of the stu
dents," he said.
To compensate for the extra va
cation days, classes will begin the
first Monday bf fall quarter instead
of Wednesday.
