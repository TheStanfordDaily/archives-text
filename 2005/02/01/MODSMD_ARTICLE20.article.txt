# Holt's Harangue
## Avast, Ye Media Pirate! 
### 
Music piracy is no longer the
only threat facing the entertain
ment industry these days. Video
piracy (in particularly full-length

movies and TV
shows) has risen
in the last year as
well. Instead of
innocent TiVo,
consumers are
increasingly tak
ing the law into
their own hands
and making their
own cable boxes,
ripping pro
grams and per-

son-to-person file-sharing services
— all illegal.
Film and TV executives are in
creasingly wary of another under
ground guerilla program like Nap
ster coming into popularity.
These threats are real, and we
need to take action now. If the pira
cy continues, our entertainment in
dustry will begin to suffer and de
cline. Can you imagine a world
where our "0.C." stars don't make
seven digits? Or where reality
shows are canceled due to lack of
funding? Or where the main attrac
tion of a Super Bowl half-time show
can only afford half a bra?
We need to be able to stop media
piracy, a form of cyber-terrorism,
from growing into an epidemic.
What I propose is no less than a cru
sade against computers.
As anyone will tell you, cyber
terrorism springs from computer
literacy. You don't see Old Aunt
Edna dropping viruses and swiping
episodes of "Farscape." So basical
ly, if we could prevent people from
becoming technologically compe
tent, we would never have these
piracy problems.
What I'm calling for here is
nothing short of revolutionary. I am
asking for the government to cut
funding for computer programs in
schools, to punish schools that har
bor computer programming classes
and to ban "computer science" as a
major. 1 will call it my "No Geek
Left Behind" program — we must
weed out the technology savvy ele
ments of our society.
Did you know that there are com
puter shows where people are free
to buy and sell computer technolo
gy with little or no supervision? A
person could walk away with a fully
loaded Pentium 4 with 17-inch flat
screen without being tracked. The
government needs to step forward
and target hotbeds of cyber-terror

ism such as computer shows, music
sharing parties, and "Star Wars"
conventions — all known spawning
grounds for media pirates.
I also propose a CPU-control
policy. Until we can weed out com
puter use from our society altogeth
er (Eritrea can do it, why cam't
we?), we need a way to monitor
computer users. A waiting period
for computer buyers would be a
good start. We need to have back
ground checks to insure that won't
pirate music, video or TV shows. If
they have a history of such criminal
behavior, or know what "Ev
erquest" is, they will be denied pur
chase.
Until the un-education of the
people is complete, the government
will need to curtail certain liberties
we previously enjoyed. To prove
our loyalty to American entertain
ment executives, we must not
record any TV show. To show our
patriotism, we must swear to not
buy pre-viewed movies at Block
buster. Also, to prevent the enter
tainment industry from going
under, we must all buy Ashlee
Simpson s new CD. It's the patriot
ic thing to do.
As great as all these plans seem,
I think we can do more to fight the
war on cyber terrorism. President
Bush must deploy troops to major
file-sharing networks across the
globe. There, they can secure "fire
walls of freedom" and seek out in
surgent file sharers. One may ask
how we hope to deploy troops to
the Internet, which is not an actual
place but rather a vast network of
personal computers. I must point
out. though, that we've had the
technology to zap humans into
computers since the Re
member "Tron"?
I'll admit, there may be some
objections to my little scheme.
Without computers, our nation will
need alternative means of compu
tation. We unfortunately have an
alarming scarcity of calculators,
abacuses and fingers to count on.
Another problem is because all of
their specialized technological
skills will now be rendered useless,
all of the techie majors on campus
will find themselves jobless after
graduation.
As an English major, all I can say
is: "Welcome to my world."
