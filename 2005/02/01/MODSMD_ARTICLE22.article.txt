Honors students are deserv
ing 'beyond any doubt'
Editor's note: The editorial discussed
in this letter was written by the former
editorial hoard.
The recent editorial "Honors
Programs Needs More Oversight"
(Jan. 21) raises concerns that "the
guidelines for honors within the ma
jors are too general and inconsis
tent, and unfairly bestow honors on
some students at the expense of oth
ers who might be more deserving."
While the concern is legitimate,
honors are not "unfairly" bestowed
"at the expense" of any other stu
dent. At Undergraduate Research
Programs, we work with honors
programs across the University, and
the situation does not seem unfair.
Stanford honors students are "de
serving" beyond any doubt; they
produce outstanding honors pro
jects, many at graduate school- and
even post-graduate levels.
In the last several years, there
has been a tremendous increase in
students doing research of all sorts,
on faculty projects as well as on
honors theses, with students in
volved in projects from Chappell-
Lougee grants to Summer Research
College. Students have been able to
learn and practice research skills
early in their undergraduate ca
reers, and this has facilitated their
undertaking more advanced honors
projects during their junior and se
nior years. Stanford students are in
creasingly competitive for graduate
school admissions because of the
opportunities for research in all
fields and on all levels.

It's actually healthy that depart
ments and interdisciplinary pro
grams handle criteria for honors ac
cording to their own understanding
of their fields. There are so many
differences between disciplines, in
intellectual visions and methods,
that it would be counter-productive
to try to over-legislate "excellence."
There are now a number of inter
disciplinary honors programs in
which students do not need to be
majors, and many departments with
demanding requirements are mak
ing renewed efforts to encourage
honors in their majors. In many re
spects, this diversity is the strength
of Stanford as a university, and dis
ciplinary autonomy has been a
source of great creativity. Not every
department or program offers a co
terminal degree, and there is noth
ing unfair about that difference.
The Daily is correct that all stu
dents should be welcomed to do
honors with equal enthusiasm.
Through the facilitation of URP, di
rectors of honors programs in the
different departments have been
exchanging insights, techniques and
resources. By sharing "best prac
tices," each department can tailor
approaches to honors in ways ap
propriate to its field, and as many
students who wish to do honors pro
jects will have the opportunity.

Letter from the 'small peo
ple' is racist and insensitive

I want to write now to express
my support for Nick Fram's column
on Jan. 26 ("School for the Gifted")
and express my disgust at the insen
sitivity, racist undertone and self
pitying nature of the letter written
to the editor by Selena Simmons-
Duffin and Jessica Schaffer ("The
small people thank Nick Fram,"
Jan. 28). Their letter mimics the dif
ficult life of a fictitious"immigrant
laborer" suffering from cancer who
sarcastically chides Fram over the
alleged presumption of his column.
The letter is signed "Juan Doe," a
racial categorization that is offen
sive and unnecessary.
Fram's column implored Stan
ford students to do more with their
degrees than get rich, and to think
about the bountiful opportunities
available to them to remediate the
injustices that are too common in
the world. Even if you disagree with
Fram's bluntness, you should ap
plaud his intent. Simmons-Duffin
and Schaffer's letter is so broad and
unqualified that it can be used to as
sault anyone who believes that
human beings have a responsibility
to one another, from Margaret
Mead to Desmond Tutu.
Simmons-Duffin and Schaffer
should know better than to play
around with life circumstances as
serious as the ones expressed in the
letter. I hope they find a less offen
sive and more sensitive way to relay
their opinions in the future.
