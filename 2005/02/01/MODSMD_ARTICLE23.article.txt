## Soto Tape Chronicles Haryasz's big day provides reason to chant 
### 
This weekend I was featured on
ESPN.com, the one true barometer of
sports fanaticism, for only the second
time in my life.
The first was after the 2003 Arizona bas
ketball game, the year of the Candygate
scandal, when ESPN the Magazine colum
nist Curry Kirkpatrick quoted a poster 1 had

helped design for Luke
Walton: "Family Studies is a
Specious Major." (In the in
terest of full disclosure 1
should point out that my
idea was to use a big word to
poke fun at Walton's aca
demic passion, but my sec
ond-grade level vocabulary
restricted my contribution .)
The second was after Sat-

urday evening's 19th annual Duck Hunt at
Mapies Pavilion. Matt Haryasz had just sat
down after 31 standout minutes with an
amazing total of 20 points and 20 rebounds.
During a rare quiet spell I started chanting
"20-20!" in honor of our new hero. The cheer
caught on and was mentioned in the online
write-up.
(For the record: In the annals of great
cheers it ranks nowhere near "Rudy" or the
slow clap from "Cool Runnings," but it does
come close to the litany of creative invec
tives hurled at Desmon Farmer over the past
couple of years.)
But this column is not about me. It's a
sports column. It's a sports column about the
sudden resurgence of the Stanford Basket
ball team and its new leader. Matt Haryasz.
Haryasz was a monster on the offensive
and defensive boards Saturday, boxing out
bulkier opponents and using his lanky arms
to snatch rebounds from the grasp of waiting
Duck players. He blocked two shots to bring
his season total to 28. He made lay-ups, put
backs, free throws and long-range jumpers
to spur the Cardinal offense at every turn.
What is it about Matt Haryasz and Ore
gon? The last time No. 52 was this dominant
was last year's contest in Eugene, when his
19 points helped the Cardinal overcome a
19-point second-half deficit to win 83-80 and
keep their season record unblemished.
Haryasz had a breakout game then, rais
ing big hopes for the rest of the season until
an ankle injury the next week slowed him
down. Though honestly, with the team we
had last year, we didn't need another stand
out player.
This year, Haryasz is a much more impor
tant part of a less dominant team, but he
would not be nearly as successful without his
surrounding cast. Rob Little is too girthy on
the blocks for single coverage, which forces
opponents to let Haryasz see daylight from
time to time. Chris Hernandez and Dan
Grunfeld are dangerous on the perimeter,
which spreads the defense and gives Haryasz
the space he needs to display his awesome
creativity with the ball.
But if there is one lesson learned from last
weekend's games, it is that Haryasz and his
teammates will not succeed in big games
without substantial input from the four guys
who watch the opening tip from the bench.
Against Oregon State, the five starters
scored all 69 of our points. We began both
halves with impressive runs to take leads of
15 and 18 points, respectively. But as soon as
the starters took a breather, our offense
ground to a halt and the pesky Beavers
mounted a comeback.
Saturday was a different story. Jason
Haas hit an early three-pointer and dished
out a beautiful assist to Little on a fastbreak.
Fred Washington stole the limelight from
Haryasz fora brief moment with a highlight
reel windmill jam off of a steal. Peter Prowitt
picked up a pair of rebounds and ably substi
tuted Little when the big man found himself
in foul trouble. And Taj Finger scored four
points despite being called for traveling on a
dunk in an officiating decision tantamount
to refusing a participation trophy to an
eight-year-old Little Leaguer.
Halfway through the Pac-10 season, Stan
ford finds itself only one game behind the
leaders, with a head-to-head rematch with
Arizona in Tucson on Saturday and Wash
ington scheduled to visit Maples in the con
ference finale. If the bench players continue
to put points on the board and keep the team
functioning when the starters sit. Stanford
should find itself in the thick of things come
March.
The future was in attendance on Saturday
as the Lopez twins, 6-foot-ll potential re
cruits, watched Stanford dismantle the
Ducks. But thanks to Haryasz it was impos
sible to ignore the present. With every re
bound, every block, every swish, and every
fist-pump to the Sixth Man Club he remind
ed us that this Cardinal team is coming into
its own, and that there is real potential for
success now.

Jordi Mala-Fink is a senior majoring in fam
ily studies who won his first cribbage game
before Saturday !r game and attributed that
to Stanford's domination.
