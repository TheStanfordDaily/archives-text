season in a big way on Saturday at California.
The Cardinal won a commanding 5-2 vic
tory over the No. 28 Golden Bears, which will
give them some confidence and momentum
as they jump into the season. A good start for
2005 was imperative, as the Cardinal men
prepare fora schedule that includes matches
against highly ranked opponents such as No.
1 Baylor, No. 2 UCLA and No. 8 USC.
Stanford got off to a strong start by clinch
ing two of the three doubles matches and,
consequently, the doubles point.
"Anytime you play on the road, it's nice to
win the doubles point and get that early lead,
and we came through with the doubles
point," head coach John Whitlinger said.
Ranked as the No. 2 doubles team in the
ITA's latest poll, Stanford senior Sam War
burg and junior KC Corkery defeated Cal's
Patrick Briaud and Conor Niland 8-4. Stan
ford senior Phil Sheng and sophomore Eric
McKean were dealt an 8-3 defeat, but junior

Jon Wong and sophomore James Wan cap
tured an 8-6 victory to secure the point.
"We struggled a little bit with doubles,"
Sheng said. "[We] got off to a slow start and
the other team played really well. We need to
work on getting off to a better start, especial
ly on road matches."
McKean agreed that a strong start was
key
"The other team just came out really lired
up and got on top of us early," he said.
After picking up the doubles point, Stan
ford only needed to win three of the singles
matches to claim the win. The Cardinal did
one better, garnering four wins in singles.
The NCAA Champions tandem of War
burg and Corkery contributed two of the sin
gles wins. No. 4 Warburg claimed a 6-4, 6-4
victory over No. 21 Niland, while No. 15
Corkery defeated Cal's Daniel Sebescen 6-4,
6-2.
"Sam and KC played well and did what I
hope they can do all year long," Whitlinger
said. "They did a good job in a tough place to
play."

over Wan for one of Cal's singles triumphs

knocked off Phil Kao 6-4. 7-5 in an
other tight match.
Bouncing hack from their defeat
in doubles, Sheng and McKean
claimed two more victories for the
Cardinal. Sheng won 6-1, 7-5 and
McKean. playing in the sixth singles
spot, tallied a hard-fought three set
victory.
Whitlinger said he believed that
Sheng and McKean's victories
would build confidence for both
players.
"It's nice to see (McKean] get a
win. to be able to lose a set and
them come back and win convinc
ingly, 6-2, in the third." Whitlinger
said. "Anytime you have success, it
builds*ome confidence, and we all
will be better the next time we
play."
Whitlinger said that some of the
players were slightly nervous be

cause Saturday's match was the first
of the season.
McKean noted that he started to
feel calmer as the match progressed.
"It was tough," he said. "They
had a lot of fans out there, and 1
think I eased myself into the match
more. [After doubles], I calmed
down my nerves and then played
singles. That was my first time play
ing Cal, and I was excited to play my
match."
With their first-match jitters out
of the way, the Cardinal will prepare
for this weekend's double-header
against No. 45 Sari Diego and No. 56
Fresno State.
"I'm glad we won just because it's
John [Whitlinger]'s first official
match of the season," Sheng said.
"Cal's a great team; they're ranked
28th, but they're better than that. It
was a great way to start off the sea
son, and we all played really well."
