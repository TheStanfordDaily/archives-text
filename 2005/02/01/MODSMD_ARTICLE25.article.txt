# Tricase leads gymnastics to home win
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There are some gymnastic skills that one needs to
see performed to believe that they're possible. Try
picturing the following tumbling pass on the floor ex
ercise — round-off, whip-half, Branni, switch split.
Having trouble with the gymnastics jargon?
Translated into lay person's terms, that is a
round-off into a no-handed back handspring with a
half twist, followed bv a half-twisting front flip, im
mediately into a split jump. Now here's the kicker
the jump isn't landed on two feet, but in a lull split on
the floor.
Ouch.
That tumbling pass is one of the many highlights
of freshman Liz Tricase's routine on floor exercise.
The Burnham Pavilion crowd loved it at last Friday's
meet against No. 24 Oregon .State. It was the first
time the Stanford crowd has seen Tricase and her
five fellow freshmen perform.
They did not disappoint.
The six freshmen alongside junior Glynn Sweets
and sophomore Stacy Sprando polished off the
Beavers, 193.125 to 192.35. Freshmen look first, sec
ond, and third in the Ail-Around and won first place
on each of the four events.
Tricase, 10th place finisher at Olympic trials this
past summer and a national champion on vault, was
the crowd favorite even though she fell after her last
tumbling pass on floor and after a front aerial (no
handed front handspring) on balance beam. She won
the vault with a 9.90 and the uneven bars with a 9.95,
setting season highs for the team on those events.
Her bar routine, another crowd favorite, cli
maxed in a release move called a Tkachev — the
gymnast releases the high bar. flies over the top of it
in a straddle position and re-catches the bar. Al
though many collegiate gymnasts perform the skill.
Tricase made it particularly exciting to watch, get
ting about twice the height that one would usually
see at a collegiate meet.
"Competing at home was more fun than I had
ever expected." Tricase said as she signed auto
graphs after the meet. "The Stanford support was in
credible and we all really appreciated it."
Freshman Alex Pintchouk finished first in the
All-Around just ahead of Tricase with a 38.675. Fri
day was the first time Pintchouk competed all four

events for the Cardinal. The Belarus native steadily
improved as the meet progressed, starting with a
9.525 on vault, continuing with a 9.65 on bars and
building to a 9.725 on beam. She culminated the
night with her self-choreographed floor routine that
scored a 9.775.
Freshman Stephanie Gentry performed a swanky
number on floor exercise to win the event with a
9.85. The strength of her tumbling passes and the
flexibility in her dance carried her routine and ener
gized the crowd.
Freshman Lauren Elmore won balance beam
with a season-high score of 9.75 and was Stan
ford's top scorer on the event for the second con
secutive week. The Cardinal struggled on beam at
the first meet of the season, but proved more con
sistent this past weekend counting a 9.75, 9.725
and a pair of 9.705.
"Beam was a huge improvement over last week
end." head coach Kristen Smyth said. "You could
see it in their attitude. They had a lot more confi
dence and were much more aggressive."
Smyth said, however, that there was plenty of
room for improvement on all four events. The gym
nasts can improve their casts on bars, their en
durance on floor and their difficulty on vault. The
upgrades will come as the team progresses through
the season and as its injured gymnasts recover and
take to the floor.
Four of the 11 gymnasts on Stanford's team did
not compete this past weekend because of injuries.
Due to the lack of depth, the Cardinal only had five
gymnasts compete on vault and floor. Teams usually
have six gymnasts compete, drop the lowest score
and count the top five scores toward the team score.
Stanford, however, did not have that luxury this past
Friday.
"A little more depth would really help us,"
Smyth said. "But we're being patient and taking it
slow. We don't want to rush anyone back."
Help is on the way for next weekend's meet
against No. 20 Central Michigan. Junior captain Na
talie Foley and freshman Tabitha Yim, two of the
team's top-scorers, should perform on two events.
Yim, the fourth place finisher at Olympic trials
this past summer, gave the crowd a thrill Friday night

by performing an exhibition routine
on bars. She watered down her dis
mount from a double back tuck with
a full twist to a single layout in order
to protect her healing Achilles ten
don. Stanford did not count her
score, but doing the routine gave
Yim some experience in collegiate
competition.
Foley, on the other hand, had to
completely sit out the meet due to
an ankle injury. It was the first time
that the eight-time All-American
spent an entire meet for the Cardi
nal in her warm-up suit. She wasn't
happy.
"She hates sitting out," Smyth
said. "She loves to compete and ab
solutely hates having to watch from
the sidelines... In some ways it's
good to be without her, because it
forces everyone else to step up. She
has big shoes to fill and they had to
step up huge."

room for improvement on all four events. The gym
nasts can improve their casts on bars, their en
durance on floor and their difficulty on vault. The
upgrades will come as the team progresses through
the season and as its injured gymnasts recover and
take to the floor.
Four of the 11 gymnasts on Stanford's team did
not compete this past weekend because of injuries.
Due to the lack of depth, the Cardinal only had five
gymnasts compete on vault and floor. Teams usually
have six gymnasts compete, drop the lowest score
and count the top five scores toward the team score.
Stanford, however, did not have that luxury this past
Friday.
"A little more depth would really help us,"
Smyth said. "But we're being patient and taking it
slow. We don't want to rush anyone back."
Help is on the way for next weekend's meet
against No. 20 Central Michigan. Junior captain Na
talie Foley and freshman Tabitha Yim, two of the
team's top-scorers, should perform on two events.
Yim, the fourth place finisher at Olympic trials
this past summer, gave the crowd a thrill Friday night

by performing an exhibition routine
on bars. She watered down her dis
mount from a double back tuck with
a full twist to a single layout in order
to protect her healing Achilles ten
don. Stanford did not count her
score, but doing the routine gave
Yim some experience in collegiate
competition.
Foley, on the other hand, had to
completely sit out the meet due to
an ankle injury. It was the first time
that the eight-time All-American
spent an entire meet for the Cardi
nal in her warm-up suit. She wasn't
happy.
"She hates sitting out," Smyth
said. "She loves to compete and ab
solutely hates having to watch from
the sidelines... In some ways it's
good to be without her, because it
forces everyone else to step up. She
has big shoes to fill and they had to
step up huge."
There are some gymnastic skills that one needs to
see performed to believe that they're possible. Try
picturing the following tumbling pass on the floor ex
ercise — round-off, whip-half, Branni, switch split.
Having trouble with the gymnastics jargon?
Translated into lay person's terms, that is a
round-off into a no-handed back handspring with a
half twist, followed bv a half-twisting front flip, im
mediately into a split jump. Now here's the kicker
the jump isn't landed on two feet, but in a lull split on
the floor.
Ouch.
That tumbling pass is one of the many highlights
of freshman Liz Tricase's routine on floor exercise.
The Burnham Pavilion crowd loved it at last Friday's
meet against No. 24 Oregon .State. It was the first
time the Stanford crowd has seen Tricase and her
five fellow freshmen perform.
They did not disappoint.
The six freshmen alongside junior Glynn Sweets
and sophomore Stacy Sprando polished off the
Beavers, 193.125 to 192.35. Freshmen look first, sec
ond, and third in the Ail-Around and won first place
on each of the four events.
Tricase, 10th place finisher at Olympic trials this
past summer and a national champion on vault, was
the crowd favorite even though she fell after her last
tumbling pass on floor and after a front aerial (no
handed front handspring) on balance beam. She won
the vault with a 9.90 and the uneven bars with a 9.95,
setting season highs for the team on those events.
Her bar routine, another crowd favorite, cli
maxed in a release move called a Tkachev — the
gymnast releases the high bar. flies over the top of it
in a straddle position and re-catches the bar. Al
though many collegiate gymnasts perform the skill.
Tricase made it particularly exciting to watch, get
ting about twice the height that one would usually
see at a collegiate meet.
"Competing at home was more fun than I had
ever expected." Tricase said as she signed auto
graphs after the meet. "The Stanford support was in
credible and we all really appreciated it."
Freshman Alex Pintchouk finished first in the
All-Around just ahead of Tricase with a 38.675. Fri
day was the first time Pintchouk competed all four

events for the Cardinal. The Belarus native steadily
improved as the meet progressed, starting with a
9.525 on vault, continuing with a 9.65 on bars and
building to a 9.725 on beam. She culminated the
night with her self-choreographed floor routine that
scored a 9.775.
Freshman Stephanie Gentry performed a swanky
number on floor exercise to win the event with a
9.85. The strength of her tumbling passes and the
flexibility in her dance carried her routine and ener
gized the crowd.
Freshman Lauren Elmore won balance beam
with a season-high score of 9.75 and was Stan
ford's top scorer on the event for the second con
secutive week. The Cardinal struggled on beam at
the first meet of the season, but proved more con
sistent this past weekend counting a 9.75, 9.725
and a pair of 9.705.
"Beam was a huge improvement over last week
end." head coach Kristen Smyth said. "You could
see it in their attitude. They had a lot more confi
dence and were much more aggressive."
