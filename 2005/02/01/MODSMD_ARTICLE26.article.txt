# Card grapplers win, lose and draw on Oregon trip
## After tough road swing, Stanford returns home for its first home dual meet since Nov. 23 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team outwres
tled its competition in all three matches
last weekend, hut it won't he reflected in
the standings, as the Cardinal (5-5-1. 1-3-
1 Pacific-10 Conference) could not over
come several weight-class forfeits and re
turned home following a 1-1-1 trip.
On Friday, Stanford wrestled Oregon
State (9-6-1, 4-2-1 Pac-10) to an 18-18
draw before heading to Eugene to take
on Oregon (5-7, 2-5) the same night. The
Ducks pulled off a painfully narrow 22-
21 victory with a 7-3 decision from Joey
Bracamonte over Oregon native and
Stanford freshman Scott Loescher in the
final match. The Cardinal did not leave
Oregon empty handed, however, drub
bing lowly Portland State (0-14. 0-6) 33-
18 on Saturday.
"Don't let any team scores fool you.
because we outwrestled all three teams,"
head coach Steve Buddie said. "Both
Oregon and Oregon State were gifted
because we had a hole at one of our
weights, and then against Oregon, we
had two holes because of lan Bork's in
jury suffered during the first dual meet of
the weekend. So, overall, the trip was a

success despite the 1-1-1 'surface' record
of what transpired."
Stanford's efforts were offset once
again by injuries. Stanford sophomore
Juston Johnson was unable to wrestle at
133-pounds due to an elbow injury.
"Forfeits were the only reason we did
not come out of the trip 3-0," Buddie
said. "Spotting a team six points is huge
because it's like handing them a pin. and
most dual meets at the Division 1 level
are decided by 'bonus wins,' like pins."
Against Oregon State, the Cardinal
were down I J-3 in team scoring after the
first three matches. Stanford was able
to make up the six-point hole after
Loescher's pin in 1:52 over Matt Ellis,
the No. 14 seed at 165 pounds. Powered
by four straight wins from freshman
Josh Zupancic, senior co-captain Matt
Gentry, junior co-captain Imad Khar
bush and Loescher, Stanford entered
the last two matches with a six-point
lead. Oregon State wrestlers Dan Pitsch
and Travis Gardner earned the dual
meet draw with two minor decision
wins over junior Ryan Hagen and
sophomore lan Bork at 184 and 197
pounds, respectively.
Against Oregon, Stanford did not
enter two wrestlers, giving the Ducks 12
free points, yet the Cardinal still kept
the meet within reach. Kharbush contin
ued his inspired wrestling at 174 pounds,
as he pinned Oregon's Mark Allen in
6:08. Gentry also earned a pin at 157
pounds over Steve Johnson in 2:3 K. The
defending NCAA Champion has not
lost since the 2002-2003 season, accu

mulating a school record 61 straight vic
tories during that span. With one match
remaining, the Cardinal led the Ducks
21-19, but Loescher could not get his
second win on the weekend as Stanford
fell 22-21.
It was the fourth time in the past five
meets that the dual meet was decided in
the last match. Stanford is 1-3 in those
meets.
"Giving a team 12 points is almost im
possible to overcome," Buddie said. "For
Oregon to only win three bouts against
us and win the dual is in many ways an in
justice, but it's part of the sport. Our en
tire team knows the real outcome of the
weekend, and we can't wait to have our
starting 10 ready and healthy for the Pac
-10 Championships."
Stanford would have to wait until Sat
urday to garner their first Pac-10 victory.
Stanford jumped out to a commanding
21-3 lead over the winless Vikings and
Hagen's pin of Sean Murphy in 3:39 was
one of three pins in the meet for the Car
dinal.
Stanford will return to Burnham
Pavilion this weekend to face Fresno
State (6-6-1) on Feb. 4 and No. Id Ari
zona State (7-6-1. 4-0-0) on Feb. 5. Stan
ford's wrestlers are excited to wrestle in
front of a home crowd for the first time
since a dual meet again San Francisco
State on Nov. 23, and the Cardinal hope
that injuries to Bork and Johnson will be
healed in time.
"Road trips are fun, and they do pre
pare you for both the conference tourna
ment and the NCAA Championships,

but traveling drains you." Buddie said.
"It will he great for them to be in their
own beds over the next month. It also
gives us a chance to watch more film,
train more frequently and still manage to
get more rest overall than when we're
traveling as often as we have been. The
team knows that if they continue to train
at the level they have been, they will win
a Pac-10 title, and all of these 'tough loss
es' will be forgotten in an instant."
