Chunks of yellow sandstone may
not seem artistic by themselves, but
to Charles Junkerman, they were
perfect for his exhibit "100 Stones /
100 Days," where visitors are ac
tive participants in the installation
and can freely move the stones
each day.
Junkerman. dean of continu
ing studies and summer session,
came up with the idea for the ex
hibit when the Cantor Arts Cen
ter asked him to lecture on any
work of art from the museum's
collections.
"I was going to lecture on Andy
Goldsworthy or Richard Long, two
artists who use natural materials in
their artwork, but then the muse
um staff offered to let me do some
thing more than just lecture," he
said. "Since I still wanted to pay
tribute to these artists. I decided to
create an exhibit where people
could experience what the two
artists go through when making a
piece of art."
Junkerman handpicked the
pieces of yellow sandstone from
the Bone Yard, where the Univer
sity deposited the rock left over
from the construction of the build
ings on the Main Quad in addition
to sandstone recovered from the
wreckage caused by the earth
quakes of 1906 and l l )S9.

" They're all pretty large so that
people will appreciate their heft
when picking them up." Junker
man said. "I picked out exactly 1 (K),
and had a few in reserve in case
some disappeared. What I didn't
expect was for the stones to multi
ply, which they did. since sand
stone is verv fragile and breaks

apart easily when wet."
Junkerman said he was original
ly going to remove the smaller
pieces of stone to maintain the ini
tial number, but he changed his
mind when people started making
new, more interesting sculptures
using the fragments.
He currently monitors the devel
opment of his exhibit, documenting
the changes with daily photographs.
He has seen many intriguing sand
stone designs—from elephants to
spokes in a wheel —but one of the
most impressive structures was cre
ated by graduate anthropology stu
dents overnight.
"They were all quite interested
in astroarchaelogy, or the building

of sculptures to mark the changes
going on in space, so they made a
ring of stones that marked the rising
of four different sets of stars, in
cluding the Pleiades," Junkerman
said. "Then they took pictures of it
by moonlight."
All kinds of visitors have been
drawn to this unusual exhibit,
from children as young as six
years-old to adults. Many of them
record their stone-arranging expe
riences in a journal provided by
Junkerman that lies just inside the
door of the museum.
"I was surprised by the entries
that I've read." Junkerman said.
"Many of them are quite poetic and
enigmatic. They talk about force

fields and centrifugal pressures and
the energy of the stones."
He added that the entries are writ
ten in a variety of languages, includ
ing English, Spanish, Portuguese
and even Chinese.
Junkerman said he has always
harbored somewhat of a passion for
stones, often stopping to pick up ran
dom ones that strike his fancy.
Through this exhibit, he said he
hoped visitors would experience and
perhaps remember the joy of playing
with everyday things.
"1 know that every adult has that
itchiness in their fingers to see how it
would feel to make art out of nature."
Junkerman said. "I'm hoping that it
will prompt their imaginations."
