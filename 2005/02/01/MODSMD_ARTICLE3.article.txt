Chunks of yellow sandstone may
not seem artistic by themselves, but
to Charles Junkerman, they were
perfect for his exhibit "100 Stones /
100 Days," where visitors are ac
tive participants in the installation
and can freely move the stones
each day.
Junkerman. dean of continu
ing studies and summer session,
came up with the idea for the ex
hibit when the Cantor Arts Cen
ter asked him to lecture on any
work of art from the museum's
collections.
"I was going to lecture on Andy
Goldsworthy or Richard Long, two
artists who use natural materials in
their artwork, but then the muse
um staff offered to let me do some
thing more than just lecture," he
said. "Since I still wanted to pay
tribute to these artists. I decided to
create an exhibit where people
could experience what the two
artists go through when making a
piece of art."
Junkerman handpicked the
pieces of yellow sandstone from
the Bone Yard, where the Univer
sity deposited the rock left over
from the construction of the build
ings on the Main Quad in addition
to sandstone recovered from the
wreckage caused by the earth
quakes of 1906 and l l )S9.

" They're all pretty large so that
people will appreciate their heft
when picking them up." Junker
man said. "I picked out exactly 1 (K),
and had a few in reserve in case
some disappeared. What I didn't
expect was for the stones to multi
ply, which they did. since sand
stone is verv fragile and breaks
