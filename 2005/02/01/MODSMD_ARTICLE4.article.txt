# Off-campus grads to ride Caltrain for free

### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Coun
cil will soon finalize a one-year
pilot program that will allow off
campus graduate students to ride
the Caltrain for free.
According to Moriah Thoma
son, chair of the Graduate Stu
dent Council, the program re
cently received approval for
funding from University Provost
John Etchemendy and needs a
few finishing touches before its
implementation possibly by the
end of winter quarter.
The GSC has been working
to team up with Caltrain for
over three years, former GSC
Chair Steve Allison said.
While the details are not final
ized, he added that "grad stu
dents have been really excit
ed" about the deal.
Transportation is one of the
chief concerns of graduate stu
dents at Stanford, according to
Allison. The prospective pro
gram "is our most popular advo
cacy effort," he said, adding that
riding the Caltrain is "almost
prohibitively expensive" for
graduate students.
GSC member Marcus Folch

agreed. Folch. who lives in San
Francisco and commutes twice
a week to the Stanford campus
said he spends about $20 per
week on transportation.
Thomason, who estimated
the average annual cost of
transportation fora student
living off campus to be $900,
said she receives e-mails daily
from graduate students ask
ing fora program to help alle
viate the costs of the Caltrain
commute.
The pilot program is the
first designed to help fund stu
dent use of Caltrain, which
previously only negotiated
with businesses for special
programs and had not made
deals for students.
"We really wanted to offer stu
dents the opportunity that staff
has," Thomason said, referring
to Stanford's two-year-old pro
gram that provides free rides on
the Caltrain for all faculty and
staff members.

for funding from Etchemendy

After working for nearly three years to help alleviate commuting costs for
grad students, the GSC has worked out a deal with Caltrain to provide
free passes.
