# Off-campus grads to ride Caltrain for free

### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Coun
cil will soon finalize a one-year
pilot program that will allow off
campus graduate students to ride
the Caltrain for free.
According to Moriah Thoma
son, chair of the Graduate Stu
dent Council, the program re
cently received approval for
funding from University Provost
John Etchemendy and needs a
few finishing touches before its
implementation possibly by the
end of winter quarter.
The GSC has been working
to team up with Caltrain for
over three years, former GSC
Chair Steve Allison said.
While the details are not final
ized, he added that "grad stu
dents have been really excit
ed" about the deal.
Transportation is one of the
chief concerns of graduate stu
dents at Stanford, according to
Allison. The prospective pro
gram "is our most popular advo
cacy effort," he said, adding that
riding the Caltrain is "almost
prohibitively expensive" for
graduate students.
GSC member Marcus Folch

agreed. Folch. who lives in San
Francisco and commutes twice
a week to the Stanford campus
said he spends about $20 per
week on transportation.
Thomason, who estimated
the average annual cost of
transportation fora student
living off campus to be $900,
said she receives e-mails daily
from graduate students ask
ing fora program to help alle
viate the costs of the Caltrain
commute.
The pilot program is the
first designed to help fund stu
dent use of Caltrain, which
previously only negotiated
with businesses for special
programs and had not made
deals for students.
"We really wanted to offer stu
dents the opportunity that staff
has," Thomason said, referring
to Stanford's two-year-old pro
gram that provides free rides on
the Caltrain for all faculty and
staff members.

for funding from Etchemendy
and University Manager Chris

After working for nearly three years to help alleviate commuting costs for
grad students, the GSC has worked out a deal with Caltrain to provide

portation must make changes to
its system before it can begin
distributing passes.
Both Caltrain and the Univer
sity seem to be "playing the num
bers to get the most benefit for the
least money out of Stanford pock
ets," Thomason said.
Once in effect, graduate stu
dents will only have to go
through "a very simple process"
to take part in the program, ac
cording to Allison.
Students will likely have to go
to the Parking and Transporta
tion Office and obtain a sticker
for their student IDs that will act
as train tickets. The program
will only be open to students who
do not live on land owned or
leased by Stanford.
Graduate students said they
are eager to take advantage of the
opportunities made possible by
free Caltrain rides. Thomason
said that the new program will

costs of commuting

"change the way that students are
able to live."
The program is not all about
student perks, however.
Thomason said that in order to
provide funding, the program had
to be proved significantly benefi
cial to the University.
Stanford has a deal with
Santa Clara County to limit
its traffic flow during peak
commuting hours. In order to
comply with the policy, Stan
ford created the Marguerite
shuttle system, and the pilot
program is a continuation of
this effort, Thomason said.
The University will also ben
efit from decreased demand
for parking.
The pilot program will be
reevaluated by both Caltrain and
the University in 2006, Thomason
said, and it will be renewed on a
yearly basis should it be deemed
successful.
