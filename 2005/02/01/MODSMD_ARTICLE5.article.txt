# Viennese Ball still alive, looks to continue
## 
### BEA SANFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In recent weeks, the rapidly ap
proaching Viennese Ball has
prompted rumors that this will be
the final year for the 28-year-old
Stanford tradition. But the Ball's
planning committee has a differ
ent story.
"We did advertise that this year
might be the last because we were
losing special-fees funding," said se
nior Howard Shen, who is both chair
and treasurer of this year's Viennese
Ball. But Shen went on to say he
does not "expect this year to be the
last year, although this could change
depending on how things look after
the Ball."
Despite fears that the ball would
be discontinued due to lack of
money, last year the event "actually
turned a profit for the first time in
four years," Shen said. "We're hop
ing to break even this year and not
touch our reserves."
Although the rumors seem un
founded, the funding situation still
leaves the future of the Ball uncertain.
"Viennese Ball is living hand-to
mouth," said sophomore Eric Chen,
a member of the Austria Week
Committee. "Every Viennese Ball
for right now could be the last one if
we don't turn a profit."
The Viennese Ball has been a
prominent Stanford event for
years. Alumna Trang Pham, '04,
who has helped orchestrate the
Ball for five years, said that there
have been many changes since its

conception. The first Ball was held
in Toyon and only admitted 200 at
tendees, Pham said.
"People used to have to sleep out
for Viennese Ball because tickets
would sell out on the first day," she
added, describing a line of students
in tents and sleeping bags.
Now the event is held at the Hyatt
Regency in Burlingame, on a 7,000
square-foot floor that holds up to
550 couples.
The Ball changes each year as
dance fads come and go, Pham said.
She cited the swing craze seven years
ago as the "peak of [student] inter
est" in dancing.
"Now salsa is coming in really
big," she said, mentioning that a lot
of Stanford dancers are also getting
into the hustle.
When the ASSU ruled two years
ago that the Ball would no longer re
ceive special fees, the committee had
to find new ways to pay for the
$55,000 event.
Shen, who has been involved with
the dance for four years, explained
the ASSU's reasoning behind their
refusal of special fees this year.
"Basically, they ruled that Vien
nese Ball cannot receive a special fee
and charge a ticket price at the same
time," Shen said. However, to cover
the cost of the Ball solely through
Stanford funding, the Committee
would have had to ask for four times
as much funding, a request which
had "no chance" of being successful,
according to Shen.

Now the group receives only
$5,543 per year in discretionary
funding, $7,000 less than last year's
special fees.
In order to make up the differ
ence, the Viennese Ball raised tick
et prices this year for alumni and
faculty, as well as for people unaf
filiated with the University. The
ticket price for students is once
again $75 per couple, and tickets
cost $105 per couple for Stanford
faculty, staff and alumni. Couples
unaffiliated with the University
must pay $125 for admission.
Many students who have attend
ed previous balls say they would be
very unhappy to see the Viennese
Ball go, and Chen said he thinks the
event provides a unique and much
needed outlet for students.
"The atmosphere at Viennese
Ball is a very different contrast to the
casual, laid-back atmosphere of
campus," he said. "It's like what high
school prom should have been."

money, last year the event "actually
turned a profit for the first time in
four years," Shen said. "We're hop
ing to break even this year and not
touch our reserves."
Although the rumors seem un
founded, the funding situation still
leaves the future of the Ball uncertain.
"Viennese Ball is living hand-to
mouth," said sophomore Eric Chen,
a member of the Austria Week
Committee. "Every Viennese Ball
for right now could be the last one if
we don't turn a profit."
The Viennese Ball has been a
prominent Stanford event for
years. Alumna Trang Pham, '04,
who has helped orchestrate the
Ball for five years, said that there
have been many changes since its

conception. The first Ball was held
in Toyon and only admitted 200 at
tendees, Pham said.
"People used to have to sleep out
for Viennese Ball because tickets
would sell out on the first day," she
added, describing a line of students
in tents and sleeping bags.
Now the event is held at the Hyatt
Regency in Burlingame, on a 7,000
square-foot floor that holds up to
550 couples.
The Ball changes each year as
dance fads come and go, Pham said.
She cited the swing craze seven years
ago as the "peak of [student] inter
est" in dancing.
"Now salsa is coming in really
big," she said, mentioning that a lot
of Stanford dancers are also getting
into the hustle.
When the ASSU ruled two years
ago that the Ball would no longer re
ceive special fees, the committee had
to find new ways to pay for the
$55,000 event.
Shen, who has been involved with
the dance for four years, explained
the ASSU's reasoning behind their
refusal of special fees this year.
"Basically, they ruled that Vien
nese Ball cannot receive a special fee
and charge a ticket price at the same
time," Shen said. However, to cover
the cost of the Ball solely through
Stanford funding, the Committee
would have had to ask for four times
as much funding, a request which
had "no chance" of being successful,
according to Shen.

Now the group receives only
$5,543 per year in discretionary
funding, $7,000 less than last year's
special fees.
In order to make up the differ
ence, the Viennese Ball raised tick
et prices this year for alumni and
faculty, as well as for people unaf
filiated with the University. The
ticket price for students is once
again $75 per couple, and tickets
cost $105 per couple for Stanford
faculty, staff and alumni. Couples
unaffiliated with the University
must pay $125 for admission.
Many students who have attend
ed previous balls say they would be
very unhappy to see the Viennese
Ball go, and Chen said he thinks the
event provides a unique and much
needed outlet for students.
"The atmosphere at Viennese
Ball is a very different contrast to the
casual, laid-back atmosphere of
campus," he said. "It's like what high
school prom should have been."
