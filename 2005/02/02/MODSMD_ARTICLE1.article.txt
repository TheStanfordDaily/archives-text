### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In his talk last night, author
David Horowitz accused Ameri
can academia of systematically
filling university departments
with "leftist" professors and bar
ring political conservatives from
gaining presence on campuses.
Horowitz, who is nationally
recognized as a figurehead of the
U.S. political right, is currently
lobbying for universities and state
legislatures throughout the coun
try to adopt his "Academic Bill of
Rights," which would commit
campuses to disregard political
beliefs in the promotion and hir
ing of faculty.
Co-sponsored by Hillel and
the Stanford Jewish American
Alliance, Horowitz's lecture
touched on various issues in con
temporary politics, but focused
mainly on the lack of "intellectual
diversity" in American higher ed
ucation and his own crusade stem
this problem.
The political imbalance,
Horowitz claimed, is largely due
to the blacklisting of conservative
scholars. As an example,
Horowitz cited the case of Hamil
ton University, which he called a
"typical leftist" institution.
"If you are a terrorist, or if you
are a supporter of terrorism, you
can be invited by the faculty of

Hamilton ... to work as a visiting
professor," Horowitz said.
It is actually the liberal-mind
ed students who suffer most from
this breed of discrimination.
Horowitz claimed, because "it is
the conservatives who are the in
novative and creative forces on
college campuses."
