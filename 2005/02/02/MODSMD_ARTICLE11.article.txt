# Does this make me look fat?
## Being a Girl 
### 
The other day, as I was driving
home from a political event in
San Francisco, I got a flat tire.
I managed to get back on campus
before I had to stop driving on it.
Right near Toyon, in nearly four
inch heels, nylons and a short-pleat
ed skirt, I stared helplessly at my pa
thetic. lifeless tire.
I thought, "I am a liberated, self-

reliant,
strong, in
dependent
woman. I
can do
this,"and
then I
called my
boyfriend.
I've never
changed a
tire — I
have AAA.
I've never
actually
needed to
call them,
though —

o
every time I've gotten a flat, a man
has offered to change it for me.
This time, I got the stuff out of my
trunk. I had taken my shoes off and
was hopping on top of the lug
wrench, trying to loosen the tire be
fore jacking it up. when my knight in
shining white sweatshirt showed up.
He offered to help, and my feeble
protests of "thanks for the offer, but
I'm doing fine" were less than credi
ble since they were delivered with
me bouncing up and down, perched
precariously on a wrench that I
couldn't get to budge. Long story
short, he was a darling and I escaped
from the situation without even a
run in my hose.
A week after that, some friends
and I went out to a bar. That was the
night of Operation Drunkity Drunk
— let's call it ODD. First mission in
ODD was "make friends with the
bartender" — not too difficult when
you've got a group of girls intent on
getting drunk. While I don't re
member this part, apparently the
bartender would make us drinks to
keep us occupied. While he made us
the drinks, we ordered, which
amounted to lots and lots of free al
cohol.
When 1 was on the mock trial
team here (Hey, don't mock it 'til
you try it. It's okay, I know I'm a
dork. I love Trivial Pursuit, too), 1
constantly used the fact that 1 was fe
male to get what 1 wanted.
As you may imagine, mock trial
doesn't typically attract the most
stunning group of feminine speci
mens, which put those of us not dis
tractingly ugly at a significant advan
tage. Flirting with opposing counsel
meant that they were less aggressive
in their objections and often got flus
tered if you'd just smile at them like
you thought their opening state
ments were Churchill-ian.
These are the reasons I love being
a girl. I don't have to stand in line to
get into clubs. I don't have to pay
cover. I never have to carry anything
heavy or register for the draft.
But, am I a sellout? Each time I
use the power that comes with a pair
of breasts, even small ones, do I take
the feminist movement back a step?
As long as women tease and tempt
to get what we want, will we ever ac
tually be respected? Can a woman
get to the top without everyone as
suming she slept her way there?
I guess. No one is suggesting that
Condi got there by boinking Bush.
Nah. she's just written off as another
case of affirmative action. But
would it be different if she were
sexy? Could she have gotten there if
she were?
I don't know. It seems like the cur
rent environment demands that
women shed their femininity to be
taken seriously in professional set
tings. That is a trade I'm unwilling to
make. I shouldn't have to pretend to
be one thing or pretend not to be an
other.
I am blunt, flirty, sensitive and
shocking. And none of those quali
ties affect my ability to write a brief,
change a tire, buy a drink or conduct
a cross examination.
But if people want to offer to do
things for me that I don't like doing
because I smile, yeah, I'm gonna let
them. Should I not? What's a femi
nist to do?

and I went out to a bar. That was the
night of Operation Drunkity Drunk
— let's call it ODD. First mission in
ODD was "make friends with the
bartender" — not too difficult when
you've got a group of girls intent on
getting drunk. While I don't re
member this part, apparently the
bartender would make us drinks to
keep us occupied. While he made us
the drinks, we ordered, which
amounted to lots and lots of free al
cohol.
When 1 was on the mock trial
team here (Hey, don't mock it 'til
you try it. It's okay, I know I'm a
dork. I love Trivial Pursuit, too), 1
constantly used the fact that 1 was fe
male to get what 1 wanted.
As you may imagine, mock trial
doesn't typically attract the most
stunning group of feminine speci
mens, which put those of us not dis
tractingly ugly at a significant advan
tage. Flirting with opposing counsel
meant that they were less aggressive
in their objections and often got flus
tered if you'd just smile at them like
you thought their opening state
ments were Churchill-ian.
These are the reasons I love being
a girl. I don't have to stand in line to
get into clubs. I don't have to pay
cover. I never have to carry anything
heavy or register for the draft.
But, am I a sellout? Each time I
use the power that comes with a pair
of breasts, even small ones, do I take
the feminist movement back a step?
As long as women tease and tempt
to get what we want, will we ever ac
tually be respected? Can a woman
get to the top without everyone as
suming she slept her way there?
I guess. No one is suggesting that
Condi got there by boinking Bush.
Nah. she's just written off as another
case of affirmative action. But
would it be different if she were
sexy? Could she have gotten there if
she were?
I don't know. It seems like the cur
rent environment demands that
women shed their femininity to be
taken seriously in professional set
tings. That is a trade I'm unwilling to
make. I shouldn't have to pretend to
be one thing or pretend not to be an
other.
I am blunt, flirty, sensitive and
shocking. And none of those quali
ties affect my ability to write a brief,
change a tire, buy a drink or conduct
a cross examination.
But if people want to offer to do
things for me that I don't like doing
because I smile, yeah, I'm gonna let
them. Should I not? What's a femi
nist to do?

The other day, as I was driving
home from a political event in
San Francisco, I got a flat tire.
I managed to get back on campus
before I had to stop driving on it.
Right near Toyon, in nearly four
inch heels, nylons and a short-pleat
ed skirt, I stared helplessly at my pa
thetic. lifeless tire.
I thought, "I am a liberated, self-

reliant,
strong, in
dependent
woman. I
can do
this,"and
then I
called my
boyfriend.
I've never
changed a
tire — I
have AAA.
I've never
actually
needed to
call them,
though —

o
every time I've gotten a flat, a man
has offered to change it for me.
This time, I got the stuff out of my
trunk. I had taken my shoes off and
was hopping on top of the lug
wrench, trying to loosen the tire be
fore jacking it up. when my knight in
shining white sweatshirt showed up.
He offered to help, and my feeble
protests of "thanks for the offer, but
I'm doing fine" were less than credi
ble since they were delivered with
me bouncing up and down, perched
precariously on a wrench that I
couldn't get to budge. Long story
short, he was a darling and I escaped
from the situation without even a
run in my hose.
A week after that, some friends
and I went out to a bar. That was the
night of Operation Drunkity Drunk
— let's call it ODD. First mission in
ODD was "make friends with the
bartender" — not too difficult when
you've got a group of girls intent on
