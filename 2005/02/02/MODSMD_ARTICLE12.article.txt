# A
						break from reality ...
## Students indulge in reality TV for a needed break 
### RENEE L. HUDSON 
With groups on Thefacebook.com
devoted to "the divine innocence of
Jessica Simpson," "American Idol,"
"Top Model" and "Laguna Beach,"
it seems that Stanford students are
finding time to enjoy the guilty plea
sure of reality television.
But what causes a show to make
the cut. especially when judged by
busy Stanford students?
"I usually like the ones with un
predictable outcomes like "The
Mole,' Big Brother' and Project
Runway,'" said freshman Arielle
Montgomery, who is listed as presi
dent of Thefacebook.com group,
"National Association for the Ad
vancement of Top Model."
Senior Kevin Holmes compared
the appeal of competitive reality
television to basketball.
"It's the same sport, the same
teams, but you want to see who
wins," he said.
For instance, when discussing one
of his favorite shows, "The Amazing
Race," Holmes said it was "more
about the game. less about the peo
ple — it could be any people, it
would still be good because of edit
ing."
Emily Wood, a senior who started
Thefacebook.com group "Laguna
Beach — Live it. Love it," said she
enjoys both competitive reality
shows and more situational pro

grams.
"I think you get to know the peo
ple better," Wood said about her
preference for "Laguna Beach."
"It's more like watching fictional
TV, only better because you are see
ing them in a general situation as op
posed to when they have their game
face on, so you get a more holistic
view of the person."
Holmes also expressed an interest
in the relationships between the peo
ple in reality shows.
"I like to watch the interpersonal

dynamics though they can seem con
trived," he said.
What is surprising, then, is that not
all of the attraction to these televi
sions shows stems from the "reality"
of it.
"I don't watch reality TV because
it supposedly is more real than other
genres, I watch it because it at least
makes an attempt to incorporate
'real' people into the storyline,"
Montgomery said. "I say they're
'real' because I really cannot relate
to most contestants, as many of those

that make it on TV after the rigorous
selection process are characters in
their own right."
Wood expressed a similar senti
ment, saying that it was not the like
ability of the characters that the
shows depend on "but on how good
of a character they are. It's a weird
paradox because they are 'real' peo
ple but you go to them for the same
reasons you'd go to fictional ones —
you want the ridiculous people."
However, creating a successful re
ality show may be a harder task than
it seems. Holmes, for example,
stopped watching "The Bachelor"
because there wasn't "enough going
on in the episodes — they're not
competing against each other direct
ly-"
One critique of "The Apprentice"
is that there is not enough time in the
show devoted to watching the candi
dates complete their missions.
"I want to see them engage in
tasks, not just argue," Holmes said.
Even the most dedicated fans
sometimes find it hard to stay inter
ested in reality TV.
"They made a whole episode
about how the apartment was messy.
It was so boring," Wood said about
"The Real World."
Holmes, in addition to watching
the shows, often reads message
boards about them to see what com
ments other people have to say
about the episodes. Also, since the

shows have their own Web sites com
plete with pictures, recaps and infor
mation on the contestants, staying
up-to-date with the shows can be
done easily.
"Whenever there's a new season
coming out I go online and read con
test bios and stuff," Holmes said.
However, being busy Stanford stu
dents, it is not always easy to make
time to watch shows.
"1 really don't have time to watch
TV much now, so I can only devote
my time to one or two shows," Mont
gomery said. "My friend TiVos a lot
of the shows, so we'll have
marathons on the weekends."
Similarly, Wood often watches
shows like "The Newlyweds" on the
weekend. Holmes, on the other
hand, simply makes time in his
schedule to watch his programs dur
ing the week.
"I watch them every week, even if
I have too much work," he said.
So why is it worth all the trouble?
"The overall experience reality
TV provides is a positive one,"
Montgomery said. "Nobody takes
them seriously and that's the fun.
We're often stressed out with all the
work and responsibilities college im
poses on us and reality TV serves as
a means of letting ourselves go for an
hour and delving into the mindless
drama of strangers. Strangers we
don't have to impress or argue with
to make a point."
