## Editorial Don't charge for unused services 
### 
University administrators will soon consider a pro
posal to include land-line telephone and in-room net
work connections as a charge on each quarterly Uni
versity bill. Those proposing the change — Informa
tion Technology Systems and Services, Stanford Uni
versity Libraries and Academic Information Re
sources and Residential Computing — are correct
that hilling should be simplified, but combining a ser
vice everyone uses with one that is rapidly declining is
the wrong tactic.
Under the proposed system, students would pay
$47 per quarter to receive both phone and network
service. ITSS officials estimate that next year, the cost
of in-room connections alone will rise from $36 to $42
per quarter, so the proposal essentially charges stu
dents $5 fora land line — a definite bargain.
However, the cost still outweighs the benefits for
most students.
Cell-phone use on campus has greatly reduced re
liance on land-lines among students. According to
ITSS, this year only 49 percent of rooms throughout
campus have land-line phones, and the percentage is
just 38 percent among undergraduates.
Understandably, ITSS wants everyone to use the
telephone lines that are already installed in rooms.
Eixed costs are high, and the phone lines have to be
maintained even if few students order service.
And there other good reasons to support the pro
posal. ITSS promotes land-line phones over cell
phones as a better way to call 911, since the call will be
directly connected to local dispatchers instead of the
California Highway Patrol. ITSS also suggests that
universal phone service will make the Door King en
trance systems effective again, increasing safety by
only allowing authorized visitors to enter.
Last weekend's break-ins have reminded us of the
importance of dorm safety, but these concerns can be
addressed through other measures. Encourage stu
dents to program local dispatch numbers into their
cell phones or use nearby land-line phones (outside
doors and in common rooms) to call 911. To increase
entrance security, speed up implementation of an ID
card based system — already in place in Branner,

Toyon and other dorms — that allows Stanford stu
dents and not strangers into dorms.
How do the costs add up? Now, students pay $42
for phone connections and $36 for network connec
tions. Under the new plan, the services will cost $47 in
all. That's an $11 per quarter increase for students
who only pay for network connections.
The plan would force all students to pay fora ser
vice that less than half of the population wants.
ITSS says that with or without this change in
billing, it will have to increase network connection
costs another 17 percent ($2 per month) on top of this
year's 20 percent increase. With the change, ITSS can
save the cost of billing all students and add cheap
phone service. The group also points out that phone
and network connections will be automatically in
cluded in financial aid. but we doubt that this will go
unnoticed in the financial aid office, where cost-of-liv
ing estimates will probably drop by the exact same
amount.
The cost savings are ITSS's best argument. But the
organization could get the same cost benefits by in
cluding network connections on the housing bill and
excluding telephone service. The Daily has favored
including network fees on University bills for some
time, and since 97 percent of students pay for in-room
connections, the fee is already distributed fairly.
What ITSS is really trying to do is make telephone
service mandatory. By combining the network con
nection and telephone bills, they are distorting the
issue. Most students should not be charged for land
lines—lTSS should add only the cost for network
connections to our quarterly bills.
Clearly, land-line phones are not disappearing any
time soon, but they are not going to become more
popular. As fewer students use land-line phones,
ITSS will have to raise rates further to maintain its
telephone system — which will drive more students to
choose cell phones. It will be difficult, but the organi
zation needs to look at other ways to keep land-lines
affordalbe, and may have to look into whether it
makes sense to maintain land-line phone systems in
the long term.
