Students can do more to support di
versity in sexual orientation
David Louk made an important
point in his op-ed about the unthink
ing ease that often characterizes ho
mophobic remarks. Acceptance of
queer people at Stanford is often
tempered by the use of demeaning
language that even those affected
have learned to tolerate or ignore.
Although offensive expressions
may seem to be more of an annoy
ance than an important issue on
campus, the presence of this lan
guage may be indicative of a culture
that claims to tolerate diversity in
sexual orientation but does not ac
tively support this diversity.
Several campus groups work to
change this situation, including the
Queer / Straight Alliance, which
hosts anti-homophobia workshops
in dorms to challenge heterosexism
and make queer issues more visible.
Clearly, it takes more than a work
shop to change individual behavior,
but if you are concerned with homo
phobic remarks in your dorm or stu
dent group and would like to do
something about it. QSA is available
atqsalliance@gmail.com as a possi
ble resource.
Even simple steps like hanging
an "I support queer rights" sign on
your door or refusing to tolerate ho
mophobic comments can be a start
to making the campus a more active
ly aware and appreciative place for
those of all sexual orientations.
In order for queer rights to be
more than a slogan on the door,
queer and queer-allied students

alike in every dorm and house on
campus must be willing to speak out
for what they believe in, even — and
— especially in moments that oth
erwise would pass in silence.

Administration needs to fix
Doorking systems
In regards to the recent intruders
in dorms, 1 place a large portion of
the blame on residential housing
services who for the past two years
have failed to properly set up the
Door King systems that they so read
ily flaunt as their solution for resi
dents propping doors open.
For the past two years, Door King
listings have been incomplete and
inaccurate. Just last night I went to
visit some friends at Xanadu and not
only were their names unlisted, but a
friend of mine who had lived there
the previous year was still on the list!
The administration needs to get
their priorities straight. If they are
going to provide this great Door -
ing system and tout its benefits, they
need to do THEIR PART and actu
ally set them up properly.

Michelle Keller's Jan. 27 story
("The Great Pot Debate") is care
fully balanced to give voice to both
sides of the contentious issue of mar
ijuana smoking.
I have a problem with both argu
ments. They focus on the drug as if it
alone causes addiction. True, drug
addiction is determined partly by
the drug's properties, but primarily
by the genetic makeup and environ
ment of the drug user. A person who
uses one drug to excess usually uses
other drugs to excess. The user —
not the drug — is the cause of the
excess.
Keller speaks of heroin as being
"highly addictive." Not so. The
probability of an average person be
coming addicted to heroin is about 2
percent, based on that famous fol
low-up study done on Vietnam vets
who had used heroin overseas. The 2
percent figure is consistent with the
experience of pain clinics and burn
clinics who prescribe opiates to their
patients.
Heroin dependence today seems
higher because the people who
choose to inject an illegal drug are
hardly a random sample of Ameri
cans; rather, they are an addiction
prone. risk-seeking subset of Amer
icans.
Those who would prohibit mari
juana because it "can be abused" or
"causes addiction" are too ignorant
to be deciding public policy.

Several campus groups work to
change this situation, including the
Queer / Straight Alliance, which
hosts anti-homophobia workshops
in dorms to challenge heterosexism
and make queer issues more visible.
Clearly, it takes more than a work
shop to change individual behavior,
but if you are concerned with homo
phobic remarks in your dorm or stu
dent group and would like to do
something about it. QSA is available
atqsalliance@gmail.com as a possi
ble resource.
Even simple steps like hanging
an "I support queer rights" sign on
your door or refusing to tolerate ho
mophobic comments can be a start
to making the campus a more active
ly aware and appreciative place for
those of all sexual orientations.
In order for queer rights to be
more than a slogan on the door,
queer and queer-allied students

alike in every dorm and house on
campus must be willing to speak out
for what they believe in, even — and
— especially in moments that oth
erwise would pass in silence.

Administration needs to fix
Doorking systems
In regards to the recent intruders
in dorms, 1 place a large portion of
the blame on residential housing
services who for the past two years
have failed to properly set up the
Door King systems that they so read
ily flaunt as their solution for resi
dents propping doors open.
For the past two years, Door King
listings have been incomplete and
inaccurate. Just last night I went to
visit some friends at Xanadu and not
only were their names unlisted, but a
friend of mine who had lived there
the previous year was still on the list!
The administration needs to get
their priorities straight. If they are
going to provide this great Door -
ing system and tout its benefits, they
need to do THEIR PART and actu
ally set them up properly.

Arguments against legalizing
marijuana ignore important facts

Michelle Keller's Jan. 27 story
("The Great Pot Debate") is care
fully balanced to give voice to both
sides of the contentious issue of mar
ijuana smoking.
I have a problem with both argu
ments. They focus on the drug as if it
alone causes addiction. True, drug
addiction is determined partly by
the drug's properties, but primarily
by the genetic makeup and environ
ment of the drug user. A person who
uses one drug to excess usually uses
other drugs to excess. The user —
not the drug — is the cause of the
excess.
Keller speaks of heroin as being
"highly addictive." Not so. The
probability of an average person be
coming addicted to heroin is about 2
percent, based on that famous fol
low-up study done on Vietnam vets
who had used heroin overseas. The 2
percent figure is consistent with the
experience of pain clinics and burn
clinics who prescribe opiates to their
patients.
Heroin dependence today seems
higher because the people who
choose to inject an illegal drug are
hardly a random sample of Ameri
cans; rather, they are an addiction
prone. risk-seeking subset of Amer
icans.
Those who would prohibit mari
juana because it "can be abused" or
"causes addiction" are too ignorant
to be deciding public policy.
