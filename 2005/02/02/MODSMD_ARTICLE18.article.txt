## An American soldier's life is worth how much? 
### 
While news of (he Iraqi elec
tion has drawn the bulk of
media attention over the
past few days, it was one tiny, 60-
word wire story in yesterday's New
York Times that caught my eye.
"Military Death Benefits to Rise,"
the headline

extolled.
Take a
wild guess at
what the
family of a
soldier killed
in combat
gets. Nope,
lower.
Current
ly, the De
partment of
Defense
places the
value of an

American killed in combat at
$12,420.
This is approximately the cost of
a burial. A quick survey of Palo
Alto funeral homes and cemeteries
put the cost of a gravesite at just
over $6,450; the cost of the head
stone at about $1,250; and a decent
casket (one made out of real wood)
starts at $1,400. The total cost of
$9,100, including the cost of a
memorial service or a procession.
True, the prices in Palo Alto
probably represent the higher end
of those one could find in this coun
try. But odds are that the people
from around here who enlist in the
army are not the Silicon Valley en
trepreneurs who have made mil
lions and are just itching to prove
something to themselves. But I've
been wrong before.
The $12,420 is not even as much
as one year's basic pay for the low
est ranking private in the army.
That amount is $14,321, plus the
signing bonus, plus benefits, plus
allowances.
True, George Bush I doubled
the amount from $6,000 on account
of the Gulf war and Bill Clinton did
not raise it beyond $12,(X)0 during
his tenure. But, the last time I
checked, Clinton did not start any
large-scale wars that put hundreds
of thousands of troops in harms

way.
The $12,420 is a pittance of the
more than $1 million that the fami
lies — civilian families — of police
officers and fire fighters received
from the September 11 Victim's
Compensation Fund.
This fund was set up to shield
the airline industry from large
scale lawsuits, and thus inflated the
compensation to discourage griev
ing families from suing. Are mili
tary families allowed to sue the
government if their son or daugh
ter gets killed in combat? Does
that make these deaths worth a mil
lion dollars less?
The average enlisted soldier
doesn't get a say in policy. He or
she signs up and pledges to defend
our country in good times and in
bad, in sickness and in health, until
death — or the end of one's con
tract — do they part.
And the thanks the government
bestows the families of these brave
men and women is $12,420.
Economists will tell you that this
is an issue of supply and demand,
and that the supply of troops has,
well, greatly diminished since this
war began. Surprise, surprise.
We must have been busy using
our money on something worth
while, right?
It seems we were more con
cerned with giving the rich tax cuts
on unearned income. Perhaps we
needed to spend more on that mis
sile-defense system, which is in its
20-somethingth incarnation and
still hasn't worked. No, we proba
bly needed the money for the coro
nation. Sorry, inauguration.
So 1 applaud George Bush II for
seeking to raise the death benefit to
$100,000, whatever his reasons for
doing so are.
At the same time, we invaded
Iraq almost two years ago. Did we
think we wouldn't lose any sol
diers?

While news of (he Iraqi elec
tion has drawn the bulk of
media attention over the
past few days, it was one tiny, 60-
word wire story in yesterday's New
York Times that caught my eye.
"Military Death Benefits to Rise,"
the headline

extolled.
Take a
wild guess at
what the
family of a
soldier killed
in combat
gets. Nope,
lower.
Current
ly, the De
partment of
Defense
places the
value of an

American killed in combat at
$12,420.
This is approximately the cost of
a burial. A quick survey of Palo
Alto funeral homes and cemeteries
put the cost of a gravesite at just
over $6,450; the cost of the head
stone at about $1,250; and a decent
casket (one made out of real wood)
starts at $1,400. The total cost of
$9,100, including the cost of a
memorial service or a procession.
True, the prices in Palo Alto
probably represent the higher end
of those one could find in this coun
try. But odds are that the people
from around here who enlist in the
army are not the Silicon Valley en
trepreneurs who have made mil
lions and are just itching to prove
something to themselves. But I've
been wrong before.
The $12,420 is not even as much
as one year's basic pay for the low
est ranking private in the army.
That amount is $14,321, plus the
signing bonus, plus benefits, plus
allowances.
True, George Bush I doubled
the amount from $6,000 on account
of the Gulf war and Bill Clinton did
not raise it beyond $12,(X)0 during
his tenure. But, the last time I
checked, Clinton did not start any
large-scale wars that put hundreds
of thousands of troops in harms

way.
The $12,420 is a pittance of the
more than $1 million that the fami
lies — civilian families — of police
officers and fire fighters received
from the September 11 Victim's
Compensation Fund.
This fund was set up to shield
the airline industry from large
scale lawsuits, and thus inflated the
compensation to discourage griev
ing families from suing. Are mili
tary families allowed to sue the
government if their son or daugh
ter gets killed in combat? Does
that make these deaths worth a mil
lion dollars less?
The average enlisted soldier
doesn't get a say in policy. He or
she signs up and pledges to defend
our country in good times and in
bad, in sickness and in health, until
death — or the end of one's con
tract — do they part.
And the thanks the government
bestows the families of these brave
men and women is $12,420.
Economists will tell you that this
is an issue of supply and demand,
and that the supply of troops has,
well, greatly diminished since this
war began. Surprise, surprise.
We must have been busy using
our money on something worth
while, right?
It seems we were more con
cerned with giving the rich tax cuts
on unearned income. Perhaps we
needed to spend more on that mis
sile-defense system, which is in its
20-somethingth incarnation and
still hasn't worked. No, we proba
bly needed the money for the coro
nation. Sorry, inauguration.
So 1 applaud George Bush II for
seeking to raise the death benefit to
$100,000, whatever his reasons for
doing so are.
At the same time, we invaded
Iraq almost two years ago. Did we
think we wouldn't lose any sol
diers?
