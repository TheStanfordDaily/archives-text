# Sudan ambassador denies claims of genocide in the Darfur region
## 
### BOB BOREK 
The Sudanese government is not pursuing
a program of genocide in Darfur, Khidir
Haroun Ahmed, Sudan's ambassador to the
United States said last night during a talk
hosted by the Muslim Students Awareness
Network.
Ahmed recounted Sudan's prominent role
in liberation movements since the 19505.
"A country with this great contribution to
the struggles of Africa would not commit
genocide against its own people," he said.
He also explained that when rebels first
began attacking police officers and military
personnel in the region in Feb. 2003, many av
erage citizens fled to the nation's capital
Khartoum. Ahmed referred to this move
ment as people "voting with their feet," con
tending that if the government were truly
committing genocide, no one would voluntar
ily travel closer to it.
Ahmed also argued that the outbreak of
rebel violence was only an attempt to "attract
the attention of international political com
munity," and that if the United States and
other countries choose to condone the rebel
lion, they will be sending a message that ag
gression is a "legitimate means to address
grievances," and would therefore "condone
rebellion all throughout Africa whenever a
group felt marginalized."
He again assured the audience that "the
government has pursued no policy of geno
cide" and added that the "government is de
termined to resolve this conflict peacefully
and using negotiations."
Other speakers during the event included
two members of the Give Peace a Chance
Coalition, Rahiel Tesfamariam, a Stanford

alumna, and Hodari Abdul-Ali. The coalition
recently traveled to the Sudan for two weeks
last month.
As an editor at the Washington Informer,
Tesfamariam often witnessed protests at the
Sudanese Embassy in Washington D.C. be
fore joining the coalition.
"My African as well as my black identity
made this trip very important for me," she
said, adding that there were "a lot of things in
Sudanese life that impressed me beyond what
I see in America."
She said she was surprised by the freedom
enjoyed by Muslim women in the Sudan rela
tive to the way that their status is portrayed in
the Western media. Based on these experi
ences, and her observations of protesters at
the Washington Embassy, she encouraged
students to find information from a number
of sources before protesting on someone's be
half.
Tesfamariam said that remaining objective
was most difficult when she saw the children
and infants in refugee camps during the trip.
The only promising sign, she said, was that
"the children did smile and they did laugh."
She then implored students to "do whatever
you can so we don't come to the day when
those children are no longer smiling."
Abdul-Ali. also a member of the coalition
who has been to Sudan four times, labeled the
conflict in Darfur a "problem between no
madic tribesmen and farmers" and discount
ed claims that slavery exists in Sudan, stating
that the current "peace agreement in Sudan is
unprecedented."
He also pointed out that Sudan is strategi
cally located within the African continent and
