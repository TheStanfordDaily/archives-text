## Right in the Babymaker No numerals, just points, on Super Bowl 
### 
Thoughts on the Super Bowl and its ac
coutrements:
• With the rise of the Patriots and Red
Sox, Boston sports fans are going through a
victory-induced X trip, squawking joyfully
and mooning New Yorkers with gleeful
abandon. The Celtics aren't hurting either,

since they're in a virtual tie
for first-place despite being
three games below .500. Of
course, that could only hap
pen in the NBA's Eastern
Conference, the polio-af
flicted younger brother of
the burly West.
• There's more at stake
here than just football. As
Boston ascends from its

identity as America's comically downtrod
den sports town, it leaves a vacuum that
could be adequately tilled by Philadelphia.
The Phillies haven't won a title since 19S0,
the Flyers since 1975 and the Sixers since
1983. The Eagles, of course, have never won
a Super Bowl. Philadelphia will have to
duke it out with Cleveland for the spot,
though. Cleveland has a strong case due to
the fact that it has been title-less since 1964
and that Indians fans had to pin their cham
pionship hopes on Jose Mesa in a deciding
World Series game in 1997, which is akin to
being forced to bet on Mozambique to be
come the next world superpower.
• Are the Roman numerals really neces
sary anymore? They just make it difficult to
remember which Super Bowl we're on, and
they add more pretentiousness to something
that's already ridiculously overrated. Re
member classics like Super Bowl IX, when
the Vikings gained 17 rushing yards, or
Super Bowl XXIV, when the 49ers won by
45 points? Of course you don't. We've been
spoiled lately by the Rams, Titans, Patriots
and Panthers, but more often than not, the
game is subpar.
• Kickers win championships, and Adam
Vinalieri is the best. It's that simple. But
don't take my word for it; talk to Jets fans,
who are rabidly searching for Doug Brien
right about now. Or just ask Super Bowl
XXV goat Scott Norwood, who, at this time
of year, can probably be found in his base
ment pitting the Bills against the Giants in
Super Tecmo Bowl and sobbing quietly.
• New England's Tedy Bruschi isn't the
biggest linebacker in the world, but he
seems to be everywhere. 1 bet he was skulk
ing around the back of Terrell Owens' press
conferences last week.
• Unless Owens plays, the passing edge
has to go to the Patriots. 1 grew up watching
Freddie Mitchell make unreal catches for
UCLA, but he also occasionally comes
down with a rare nerve disorder that seems
to deaden all feeling in his hands. I've also
seen Todd Pinkston shy away from hits that
Christopher Reeve would be able to shake
off— in his current state.
• On the other side of the ball, though,
the Pats have a very small, very mistake
prone secondary that has as yet been stellar
in the playoffs. Rodney Harrison is really
the one strong link; he makes excellent
reads and tackles well, but there's always
the possibility that he'll get thrown out of a
game for surreptitiously punching an oppo
nent in the groin. Harrison was voted the
dirtiest player in the league by his peers this
season. He must be a great guy, though,
since he donates a lot to charity in the form
of fines for illegal hits. As Arizona OB Josh
McCown said after absorbing a vicious hit
from Harrison while two steps out of
bounds, "When he hits you. he's just doing it
for the kids."
• Remember when Jevon Kearse was the
most feared defensive player in the league?
Yeah, me neither. Until I saw his name on
the Eagles roster two weeks ago I thought
he was out of the league and appearing on
TV only to promote Under Armour.
• You're right, Pats fans, Tom Brady is
better than Joe Montana. I guess I should be
convinced. I'm just going to forget that
Montana presided over four Super Bowl
winners to Brady's two. that he obliterated
his AFC opponents repeatedly while Brady
had to struggle to beat Carolina and St.
Louis, and that Brady came within a missed
field goal of being last season's Super Bowl
goat for his inexplicable endzone intercep
tion. Also, the quarterbacks Montana beat
in the Super Bowl had names like Elway,
Marino, and Esiason. It's entirely possible
that Jake Delhomme will be farming craw
dads in a couple of years. Same goes for
Kurt Warner, who apparently incurred the
wrath of God after two seasons of excel
lence, by allowing his wife to share his
hairstyle.
• You've been great; I'll be here all week.
Or at least until Sunday, when I've been in
formed that a local sports bar has a "Dollar
Hot Dogs" promotion during the game.

45 points? Of course you don't. We've been
spoiled lately by the Rams, Titans, Patriots
and Panthers, but more often than not, the
game is subpar.
• Kickers win championships, and Adam
Vinalieri is the best. It's that simple. But
don't take my word for it; talk to Jets fans,
who are rabidly searching for Doug Brien
right about now. Or just ask Super Bowl
XXV goat Scott Norwood, who, at this time
of year, can probably be found in his base
ment pitting the Bills against the Giants in
Super Tecmo Bowl and sobbing quietly.
• New England's Tedy Bruschi isn't the
biggest linebacker in the world, but he
seems to be everywhere. 1 bet he was skulk
ing around the back of Terrell Owens' press
conferences last week.
• Unless Owens plays, the passing edge
has to go to the Patriots. 1 grew up watching
Freddie Mitchell make unreal catches for
UCLA, but he also occasionally comes
down with a rare nerve disorder that seems
to deaden all feeling in his hands. I've also
seen Todd Pinkston shy away from hits that
Christopher Reeve would be able to shake
off— in his current state.
• On the other side of the ball, though,
the Pats have a very small, very mistake
prone secondary that has as yet been stellar
in the playoffs. Rodney Harrison is really
the one strong link; he makes excellent
reads and tackles well, but there's always
the possibility that he'll get thrown out of a
game for surreptitiously punching an oppo
nent in the groin. Harrison was voted the
dirtiest player in the league by his peers this
season. He must be a great guy, though,
since he donates a lot to charity in the form
of fines for illegal hits. As Arizona OB Josh
McCown said after absorbing a vicious hit
from Harrison while two steps out of
bounds, "When he hits you. he's just doing it
for the kids."
• Remember when Jevon Kearse was the
most feared defensive player in the league?
Yeah, me neither. Until I saw his name on
the Eagles roster two weeks ago I thought
he was out of the league and appearing on
TV only to promote Under Armour.
• You're right, Pats fans, Tom Brady is
better than Joe Montana. I guess I should be
convinced. I'm just going to forget that
Montana presided over four Super Bowl
winners to Brady's two. that he obliterated
his AFC opponents repeatedly while Brady
had to struggle to beat Carolina and St.
Louis, and that Brady came within a missed
field goal of being last season's Super Bowl
goat for his inexplicable endzone intercep
tion. Also, the quarterbacks Montana beat
in the Super Bowl had names like Elway,
Marino, and Esiason. It's entirely possible
that Jake Delhomme will be farming craw
dads in a couple of years. Same goes for
Kurt Warner, who apparently incurred the
wrath of God after two seasons of excel
lence, by allowing his wife to share his
hairstyle.
• You've been great; I'll be here all week.
Or at least until Sunday, when I've been in
formed that a local sports bar has a "Dollar
Hot Dogs" promotion during the game.

Thoughts on the Super Bowl and its ac
coutrements:
• With the rise of the Patriots and Red
Sox, Boston sports fans are going through a
victory-induced X trip, squawking joyfully
and mooning New Yorkers with gleeful
abandon. The Celtics aren't hurting either,

since they're in a virtual tie
for first-place despite being
three games below .500. Of
course, that could only hap
pen in the NBA's Eastern
Conference, the polio-af
flicted younger brother of
the burly West.
• There's more at stake
here than just football. As
Boston ascends from its

identity as America's comically downtrod
den sports town, it leaves a vacuum that
could be adequately tilled by Philadelphia.
The Phillies haven't won a title since 19S0,
the Flyers since 1975 and the Sixers since
1983. The Eagles, of course, have never won
a Super Bowl. Philadelphia will have to
duke it out with Cleveland for the spot,
though. Cleveland has a strong case due to
the fact that it has been title-less since 1964
and that Indians fans had to pin their cham
pionship hopes on Jose Mesa in a deciding
World Series game in 1997, which is akin to
being forced to bet on Mozambique to be
come the next world superpower.
• Are the Roman numerals really neces
sary anymore? They just make it difficult to
remember which Super Bowl we're on, and
they add more pretentiousness to something
that's already ridiculously overrated. Re
member classics like Super Bowl IX, when
the Vikings gained 17 rushing yards, or
Super Bowl XXIV, when the 49ers won by
45 points? Of course you don't. We've been
spoiled lately by the Rams, Titans, Patriots
and Panthers, but more often than not, the
