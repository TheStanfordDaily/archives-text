# Split-squad collects nine top finishes in Idaho, notches two provisional NCAA times in Seattle

With its squad splitting up for the weekend, the
Stanford indoor track team got off to a promising
start. The athletes parted ways, with some travel
ing to the Bodyßuilding.com invitational in Boise,
Idaho, and others to the Washington Indoor Invi
tational in Seattle. While the men's and women's
vaulters and distance runners competed in Seattle,
the sprinters, throwers and jumpers showed off
their fine-tuned skills in Boise.
The women had nine first-place finishes in
Boise, hut because many big teams were not pre
sent at the meet, the results may not be indicative
of what is to come this season.
"The competition was low key which makes
you less excited about the results," head women's
coach Edrick Floreal said.
The results were still notable, especially those
of freshman jumper Erica McClain. McClain set a
new school record with her triple jump of 43-10
1/2. Her winning jump qualified her for the NCAA
Indoor Nationals in March.
"Even when she was being recruited you could
tell she was going to be a very special athlete," Flo
real said.
Other first-place finishers were sophomore
Janice Davis in the 60-meter dash, senior Christine
Moschella in the 200-meter, sophomore Ashley
Freeman in the 400-meter and freshman Laura
Mottaz in the 800-meter run.
The 4x4(X) meter relay team of Davis. Moschel
la, junior Nashonme Johnson and sophomore
Ashley Purnell dominated the competition, win
ning by more than 15 seconds.
The Cardinal women came away with four first
place finishes in jumps and throws. McClain
threatened to break another record, taking the
longjumpin 19-103/4 —second-best inschool his
tory. Sophomore Lindsey Gannaway jumped 5-5
to win the high jump.
Rounding out the top honors in Idaho were
freshman Melissa Yunghans, who won the shot
put. and sophomore Katy Elsbury, who took first
place in the weight throw.
The men did not fare quite as well in Boise, al
though men's head coach Robert Weir had faith in
the potential of his runners.
"It was a good season opener," Weir said. "We
are a very young team, and we're hoping to boost
our performances later on."
Weir was pleased with the second-place 4x400

meter relay team. Senior sprinters Curtis
Goehring and Nick Sebes, running the second and
fourth legs at times of 46.8 and 47 seconds, respec
tively, led the relay team to a respectable time of
3:13.95.
Weir, who is also the throwing coach, was espe
cially confident about redshirt freshman thrower
Mike Macellari, who placed third in the shot put
and opened the season with a personal best of 53-
5 3/4.
Freshman Wopamo Osaisai took third in the
60-meters with a time of 6.90, the third best time in
Stanford history.
While Floreal —who doubles as the sprint and
jump coach—highly regarded Osaisai, a corner
back on the Stanford football team, Osaisai's tran
sition from football to track seemed to be of some
concern.
"The track is a lot stiffer, tougher and less for
giving than the grass on a football field," said Flo
real. "His first performance was very good, and if
he remains focused and recovers from football he
will do very well."
In Washington, expectations to improve as tl;e
season goes along were shared. Sophomore
Joaquin Chapa came off with a ninth-place finish
in the 8(X)-meter run. Chapa was scheduled to run
the mile but failed to finish after another runner's
spike clipped him on the curve, causing him to fall.
"His 800 time was good all things considered."
Weir said.
The two freshmen pole vaulters, Graeme Hoste
and Benjamin Dickens, competed well in their first
collegiate meet this weekend. Hoste vaulted 16-5
1/4 to a fourth-place finish, while Dickens vaulted
15-1 1/2 to finish 11th.
"They did a marvelous job actually," Weir said.
"I'm excited about the prospects for later on."
Meanwhile, the women showed promise in
Washington, earning two provisional NCAA
marks. Junior Anita Siraki finished fourth in the
3,000 with a time of 9:17.68, and sophomore Katy
Trotter followed close behind with a time of
9:20.56.
Unlike an automatic qualifying time, a provi
sional time puts the athletes in a pool that is later
used to round out the 16-20 athletes that compete
in each event at nationals.
"The automatic mark is really tough to get -

Nick Sebes, a senior sprinter, ran his leg of the 4x400 meter relay in 47 sec
onds. Coupled with teammate Curtis Goehring's time of 46.8 seconds, the
Cardinal relay team put together a second-place finish.
son," Floreal said.
McClain was the only
Stanford runner to automat
ically qualify this past week
end.
The women pole vaulters
faced tough competition.
Junior Samantha Shepard
and freshman Leila Ben-
Youssef vaulted to fourth
and eighth-place, respec
tively. Both Shepard and
Ben-Youssef vaulted 12-4.
"The pole vault is an
event that is really tough in

the NCAA," Floreal said.
"It's also harder on the West
Coast because of the weath
er conditions. We can train
outside all year, whereas
elsewhere they have to train
inside for part of the year."
Floreal was pleased with
the results and with the
standout performances of
McClain and Siraki.
"Erica and Anita really
set the tone for us this week
end," Floreal said.
