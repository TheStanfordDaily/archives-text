# Women head elite field of 16 in tourney
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
On Thursday, the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team
(2-0) heads to the ITA Women's Team Indoor Champi
onship in Madison, Wis., aiming to erash the party of 16
NCA A-caliher challengers.
Only four schools have ever won a title at the tourna
ment, which turns IK this year. Stanford leads the pack
with seven titles, clinching three in the last four years.
Florida is runner-up, with six titles, followed by Georgia's
three and Duke's recent 2003 victory.
Last year, the Cardinal dropped just two matches en
route to a 5-0 final victory over the Bulldogs. The win re
versed a two-year slump in the tournament for Stanford,
which was edged out by Georgia and California in earlier
rounds in back-to-back years.
This year, Stanford returns as the prima donna: the top
seed, confident about its chances in a competition featur
ing the top four finishers at the 2004 NCAA Champi
onships. Finalist UCLA (3-0), which fell to Stanford last
May, 4-1, is seeded third.
NCAA semifinalists Clemson (1-0) and Vanderbilt (4-
0) lay claim to the second and fifth seeds, respectively.
"We are always ready for teams to be fired up at this
stage, and as the No. 1 team we expect people to be aim
ing for us," junior Alice Barnes said. "But we are pretty
fired up too, and we are very confident in our ability."
Barnes refers to the high level of play sure to come
from any of the top eight seeds rounded out by No. 11
Washington.
In addition, Stanford is more than ready to overpower
weaker opponents, such as No. 34 Harvard (1-0), which it
faces in the first round.
Ranked No. 12 in the nation, Barnes (6-5) allowed UC-
Davis' Robin Guier just two games in a smooth win last
Thursday 6-2,6-0.
"In practice, I've just been working on my usual stuff,
trying to get sharp again," Barnes said. "I think I am."
Barnes succeeds in exhibiting a great amount of pa
tience on the courts, as her opponents become frustrated
with long points and three-set matches. However, in a
frenzied tournament where individual matches are often
cut short to declare one team victor over another, a
drawn-out playing style is a mixed blessing.
In the semifinals at 2004 Indoor. Barnes waged an ex
hausting battle at No. 2 singles against Washington's No.
13 Dea Sumantri. Barnes was ahead 7-5. 3-6, 4-2, when
teammate Emilia Anderson clinched the team win at No.
6 singles.
But for every sliced backhand that Barnes sends sailing
over the net, and for every delayed return that opponents
readjust and scramble to provide, the Cambridge, U.K,
native proves she also knows how to polish off a match in
a hurry.
Facing off against Georgia in the final. Barnes deprived
Shadisha Robinson of a win in just two sets 6-0,6-3.
Adding to the Cardinal lineup are two freshmen who
generated phenomenal results in the fall season. Whitney
Deason and Lejla Hodzic.
Deason boasts an 8-2 record and a No. 41 ranking. Her
two losses this season were in close matches against Geor
gia's No. 10 Shadisha Robinson and Cal's No. 3 Suzi
Babos. Deason weathered a solidO 7-5, 7-5, decision in
Robinson's favor at the Freeman Memorial Champi
onship semifinal. Babos defeated Deason in the quarter

finals at the ITA Northwest Regional Championships 6-3,
7-6.
Nevertheless, Deason's respectable appearances in
three fall tournaments have only boosted her confidence.
Robinson got the best of yet another Cardinal, 6-3,6-4,
after Hodzic had pulled out a tough win over Babos in the
Freeman Memorial semifinals 6-3, 6-4. But with her 10-1
record, Hodzic will likely break into next week's rankings
after reaching the Freeman final.
In doubles, the Cardinal are proving to be just as
formidable. Heading the lineup, the No. 7 tandem of Erin
Burdette and Barnes dashed the Aggies' hopes with
an 8-0 win over Guier and Ally Muller.
Burdette and Barnes are two-for-two in individual
tournament finals so far. bringing home a title from the
Pacific-10 Conference Indoor Championships last month.
The No. 41 duo of Deason and Hodzic (6-0) garnered

honors of its own at Freeman Memorial, upsetting Flori
da's Nina Suvak and Alex Liles, 8-5, in the final.
In a third doubles pairing, defending NCAA Singles
Champion Amber Liu, a junior, will compete with sopho
more Anne Yelsey. who completed a solid 35-5 record
with Anderson last year.
"In each team we've got players whose styles compli
ment each other really well, so I'm very optimistic about
our doubles prospects this year," Barnes said. "It will take
a very, very tough team to win the doubles point from us
this year."
It appears likely then, that in a tournament where time
is fleeting, an increasingly fortified Cardinal lineup will
turn last year's slew of 8-6 nail-biters and 9-8 scrapes into
more comfortable margins of success.
The action begins Thursday at 9 a.m. at A.C. Nielsen
tennis center.

native proves she also knows how to polish off a match in
a hurry.
Facing off against Georgia in the final. Barnes deprived
Shadisha Robinson of a win in just two sets 6-0,6-3.
Adding to the Cardinal lineup are two freshmen who
generated phenomenal results in the fall season. Whitney
Deason and Lejla Hodzic.
Deason boasts an 8-2 record and a No. 41 ranking. Her
two losses this season were in close matches against Geor
gia's No. 10 Shadisha Robinson and Cal's No. 3 Suzi
Babos. Deason weathered a solidO 7-5, 7-5, decision in
Robinson's favor at the Freeman Memorial Champi
onship semifinal. Babos defeated Deason in the quarter

finals at the ITA Northwest Regional Championships 6-3,
7-6.
Nevertheless, Deason's respectable appearances in
three fall tournaments have only boosted her confidence.
Robinson got the best of yet another Cardinal, 6-3,6-4,
after Hodzic had pulled out a tough win over Babos in the
Freeman Memorial semifinals 6-3, 6-4. But with her 10-1
record, Hodzic will likely break into next week's rankings
after reaching the Freeman final.
In doubles, the Cardinal are proving to be just as
formidable. Heading the lineup, the No. 7 tandem of Erin
Burdette and Barnes dashed the Aggies' hopes with
an 8-0 win over Guier and Ally Muller.
Burdette and Barnes are two-for-two in individual
tournament finals so far. bringing home a title from the
Pacific-10 Conference Indoor Championships last month.
The No. 41 duo of Deason and Hodzic (6-0) garnered

honors of its own at Freeman Memorial, upsetting Flori
da's Nina Suvak and Alex Liles, 8-5, in the final.
In a third doubles pairing, defending NCAA Singles
Champion Amber Liu, a junior, will compete with sopho
more Anne Yelsey. who completed a solid 35-5 record
with Anderson last year.
"In each team we've got players whose styles compli
ment each other really well, so I'm very optimistic about
our doubles prospects this year," Barnes said. "It will take
a very, very tough team to win the doubles point from us
this year."
It appears likely then, that in a tournament where time
is fleeting, an increasingly fortified Cardinal lineup will
turn last year's slew of 8-6 nail-biters and 9-8 scrapes into
more comfortable margins of success.
The action begins Thursday at 9 a.m. at A.C. Nielsen
tennis center.

The freshman tandem of Whitney Deason and Lejla Hodzic stands at No. 41 in the country. The duo has found not only found
success as partners — faking the Freeman Memorial title earlier this season — but as individual players as well. Deason is ranked
at No. 41 in singles play while Hodzic is expected to break into the rankings next week.
On Thursday, the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team
(2-0) heads to the ITA Women's Team Indoor Champi
onship in Madison, Wis., aiming to erash the party of 16
NCA A-caliher challengers.
Only four schools have ever won a title at the tourna
ment, which turns IK this year. Stanford leads the pack
with seven titles, clinching three in the last four years.
Florida is runner-up, with six titles, followed by Georgia's
three and Duke's recent 2003 victory.
Last year, the Cardinal dropped just two matches en
route to a 5-0 final victory over the Bulldogs. The win re
versed a two-year slump in the tournament for Stanford,
which was edged out by Georgia and California in earlier
rounds in back-to-back years.
This year, Stanford returns as the prima donna: the top
seed, confident about its chances in a competition featur
ing the top four finishers at the 2004 NCAA Champi
onships. Finalist UCLA (3-0), which fell to Stanford last
May, 4-1, is seeded third.
NCAA semifinalists Clemson (1-0) and Vanderbilt (4-
0) lay claim to the second and fifth seeds, respectively.
"We are always ready for teams to be fired up at this
stage, and as the No. 1 team we expect people to be aim
ing for us," junior Alice Barnes said. "But we are pretty
fired up too, and we are very confident in our ability."
Barnes refers to the high level of play sure to come
from any of the top eight seeds rounded out by No. 11
Washington.
In addition, Stanford is more than ready to overpower
weaker opponents, such as No. 34 Harvard (1-0), which it
faces in the first round.
Ranked No. 12 in the nation, Barnes (6-5) allowed UC-
Davis' Robin Guier just two games in a smooth win last
Thursday 6-2,6-0.
"In practice, I've just been working on my usual stuff,
trying to get sharp again," Barnes said. "I think I am."
Barnes succeeds in exhibiting a great amount of pa
tience on the courts, as her opponents become frustrated
with long points and three-set matches. However, in a
frenzied tournament where individual matches are often
cut short to declare one team victor over another, a
drawn-out playing style is a mixed blessing.
In the semifinals at 2004 Indoor. Barnes waged an ex
hausting battle at No. 2 singles against Washington's No.
13 Dea Sumantri. Barnes was ahead 7-5. 3-6, 4-2, when
teammate Emilia Anderson clinched the team win at No.
6 singles.
But for every sliced backhand that Barnes sends sailing
over the net, and for every delayed return that opponents
readjust and scramble to provide, the Cambridge, U.K,
native proves she also knows how to polish off a match in
a hurry.
Facing off against Georgia in the final. Barnes deprived
Shadisha Robinson of a win in just two sets 6-0,6-3.
