# Cardinal men admire winning role of younger teammates' depth
## 
### SAMUEL CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's swim
ming and diving team (5-0,2-0 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) has formed the
habit of winning. Well, old habits die
hard, and no opponent seems to be
giving this one the boot.
Winners of 37 consecutive dual
meets dating back to the 1999-2000
season, when the Cardinal lost a nail
biter to Texas, Stanford is seeking to
keep its streak alive as it hosts No. 7
Southern California (4-1,2-0 Pac-10)
at the Avery Aquatic Center Satur
day afternoon.
Stanford swimmers are confident
heading into their final home meet
of the season against the recently de
throned Trojans. One month ago
USC sat atop the polls, only to be
soundly defeated by a strong dis
tance-swimming Michigan team.
The Cardinal trounced the Wolver
ines less than a week later, 136-102.
"We've been able to do whatever
is necessary to get wins," senior co
captain Matt McDonald said. "Dif
ferent people have stepped up in
every meet and that will continue to
happen against USC."
The Cardinal have won their past
seven meets against the Trojans,
with Stanford's last defeat coming
during the 1996-1997 season.
Strength through depth has been
the trump card all season for the
Cardinal, and the emergence of
young swimmers has proven to be a
great part of the winning formula for

coach Skip Kenney. Stanford's ex
ceptional sophomore class —includ-
ing Hongzhe Sun, Ben Wildman-To
briner, Andy Grant, Shaun Phillips,
Matt Crowe, Keenan Newman and
Kyle Ransom — has contributed to
each of Stanford's five wins.
The freshmen are also coming on
strong, and as the end of the season
draws near, they could prove crucial
to the Cardinal's postseason success.
"We've worked primarily on race
strategies earlier in the year, now it's
just time to race and see how all the
work pays off," McDonald said. "It
should be fun to see our freshman
improve every week from here on
out."
The race to finish at the elusive
No. 1 position at the end of the sea
son has presented some drama this
past week. The previously top
ranked Cardinal dropped down to
No. 2 - defending national champi
on Auburn (8-0) took over the top
spot - despite decisively routing two
strong Arizona schools.
"We were perplexed when we
saw the latest rankings, especially
considering our great performances
in Arizona," senior Gary Marshall
said. "While mid-season rankings
are not as important as our finish at
the end of the year, they definitely
provide motivation to excel."
Despite the disappointing news,
the Cardinal are still upbeat and
concentrating on preparing to swim
well at the Pac-10 and NCAA
Championships.
"There's always motivation to

perform, to strike fear in your oppo
nents, but I don't see being bumped
to No. 2 as a change in our attitude,"
McDonald said. "We are more fo
cused on the end-of-season swims at
the Pac-10's and NCAA's and how
we can contribute individually to
team goals. Dual meet rankings are a
nice indicator of how we're doing,
but they aren't the end all."
Though USC will provide rare
top-notch competition, Stanford is
bent on swimming fast and having
fun in the seniors' last collegiate
meet on the Farm. In doing so, the
Cardinal will face some of the fastest
competitors they have seen all year,
with Trojan sophomore olympian
Larsen Jensen and junior Ous Mel
louli already having performed
NCAA "A" cut times.
Deemed a meet in preparation
for the Cardinal's Big Swim at cross
bay rival California, Marshall is
ready to give his last collegiate meets
his all.
"This meet is a warm-up for Cal,"
Marshall said. "They will be our
biggest challenge and would love
nothing more than to beat us. I can't
wait to disappoint them in two
weeks."
Stanford will visit Cal on Feb. 19,
before heading off to the Pac-10
Championships to be held March 2-
5. NCAA Championships will be
held March 24-26.
As the Cardinal finish the regular
season, 39 consecutive dual meet
wins and a 63-3 record since the
1997-1998 season are in sight.

Junior Tobias Oriwol and the Stanford men's swim team were slightly confused over their most recent ranking at No. 2.
According to the Cardinal, though, the change in the standings won't affect their attitudes when it really counts.

we can contribute individually to
team goals. Dual meet rankings are a
nice indicator of how we're doing,
but they aren't the end all."
Though USC will provide rare
top-notch competition, Stanford is
bent on swimming fast and having
fun in the seniors' last collegiate
meet on the Farm. In doing so, the
Cardinal will face some of the fastest
competitors they have seen all year,
with Trojan sophomore olympian
Larsen Jensen and junior Ous Mel
louli already having performed
NCAA "A" cut times.
Deemed a meet in preparation
for the Cardinal's Big Swim at cross
bay rival California, Marshall is
ready to give his last collegiate meets
his all.
"This meet is a warm-up for Cal,"
Marshall said. "They will be our
biggest challenge and would love
nothing more than to beat us. I can't
wait to disappoint them in two
weeks."
Stanford will visit Cal on Feb. 19,
before heading off to the Pac-10
Championships to be held March 2-
5. NCAA Championships will be
held March 24-26.
As the Cardinal finish the regular
season, 39 consecutive dual meet
wins and a 63-3 record since the
1997-1998 season are in sight.

Junior Tobias Oriwol and the Stanford men's swim team were slightly confused over their most recent ranking at No. 2.
According to the Cardinal, though, the change in the standings won't affect their attitudes when it really counts.
The No. 2 Stanford men's swim
ming and diving team (5-0,2-0 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) has formed the
habit of winning. Well, old habits die
hard, and no opponent seems to be
giving this one the boot.
Winners of 37 consecutive dual
meets dating back to the 1999-2000
season, when the Cardinal lost a nail
biter to Texas, Stanford is seeking to
keep its streak alive as it hosts No. 7
Southern California (4-1,2-0 Pac-10)
at the Avery Aquatic Center Satur
day afternoon.
Stanford swimmers are confident
heading into their final home meet
of the season against the recently de
throned Trojans. One month ago
USC sat atop the polls, only to be
soundly defeated by a strong dis
tance-swimming Michigan team.
The Cardinal trounced the Wolver
ines less than a week later, 136-102.
"We've been able to do whatever
is necessary to get wins," senior co
captain Matt McDonald said. "Dif
ferent people have stepped up in
every meet and that will continue to
happen against USC."
The Cardinal have won their past
seven meets against the Trojans,
with Stanford's last defeat coming
during the 1996-1997 season.
Strength through depth has been
the trump card all season for the
Cardinal, and the emergence of
young swimmers has proven to be a
great part of the winning formula for

coach Skip Kenney. Stanford's ex
ceptional sophomore class —includ-
ing Hongzhe Sun, Ben Wildman-To
briner, Andy Grant, Shaun Phillips,
Matt Crowe, Keenan Newman and
Kyle Ransom — has contributed to
each of Stanford's five wins.
The freshmen are also coming on
strong, and as the end of the season
draws near, they could prove crucial
to the Cardinal's postseason success.
"We've worked primarily on race
strategies earlier in the year, now it's
just time to race and see how all the
work pays off," McDonald said. "It
should be fun to see our freshman
improve every week from here on
out."
The race to finish at the elusive
No. 1 position at the end of the sea
son has presented some drama this
past week. The previously top
ranked Cardinal dropped down to
No. 2 - defending national champi
on Auburn (8-0) took over the top
spot - despite decisively routing two
strong Arizona schools.
"We were perplexed when we
saw the latest rankings, especially
considering our great performances
in Arizona," senior Gary Marshall
said. "While mid-season rankings
are not as important as our finish at
the end of the year, they definitely
provide motivation to excel."
Despite the disappointing news,
the Cardinal are still upbeat and
concentrating on preparing to swim
well at the Pac-10 and NCAA
Championships.
"There's always motivation to

perform, to strike fear in your oppo
nents, but I don't see being bumped
to No. 2 as a change in our attitude,"
McDonald said. "We are more fo
cused on the end-of-season swims at
the Pac-10's and NCAA's and how
we can contribute individually to
team goals. Dual meet rankings are a
nice indicator of how we're doing,
but they aren't the end all."
