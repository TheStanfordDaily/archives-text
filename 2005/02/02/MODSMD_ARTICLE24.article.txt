# Hawaii poses tough battle for men's volleyball
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This time of year, who wouldn't want to
be a member of the Stanford men's volley
ball team?
While much of the Stanford student
body is struggling through midterms, the
Cardinal men are flying to Manoa fora
pair of matches against Hawaii.
Despite the team's recent home losses
to Northridge and UC-Santa Barbara, the
Cardinal (3-6,2-4 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) are looking forward to leav
ing the Farm.
"Hawaii is probably one of the best
trips of the year," senior outside hitter
David Vogel said. "They get tons of peo
ple - thousands of people - into the stadi
um. It's a riot, a lot of fun."
The No. 10 Cardinal are particularly
upbeat to face the No. 3 Warriors, who are
6-1 overall and are undefeated (4-0) in
MPSF play.
Stanford will play Hawaii in back-to
back matches Thursday and Friday
evening. If the Cardinal are able to defeat
the Warriors in either match, it will be
Stanford's first victory over a higher
ranked team this season.
Hawaii's only loss this season came at
the hands of No. 3 Brigham Young. To say
that the Warriors will be an intimidating
opponent is an understatement.
"It's extremely difficult to play there
because they're very good at home,"
Vogel said. "Thev have a few good attack

ers that We're going to have to really key
on."
Such attackers include Hawaii senior
Pedro Azenha, an outside hitter and sec
ond team Ail-American who recorded 53
service aces last season. Azenha finished
second nationally in aces per game (.576).
Giving the Warriors additional depth
at the position of outside hitter is senior
Delano Thomas. Another strong server,
Thomas led the conference in aces last
season and led his team in kill average,
with four per game.
Hawaii junior Maulia La Barre, a mid
dle blocker, won't have to jog Stanford's
mind Thursday and Friday night to re
mind the Cardinal of his presence.
The Cardinal should have no problem
remembering La Barre, who recorded ca
reer single-match bests in hitting (1.000),
kills (11) and solo blocks (4) last season —
all in one match against Stanford.
In that Feb. 13 match last year the Car
dinal never scored more than 19 points. It
was their second shutout defeat by Hawaii
that season.
However, this year's Cardinal squad has
a greater level of overall experience than
they did last year. Using this advantage and
working well together on the court will be
key if Stanford is to upset the Warriors.
"If we can do a good job of keeping
their hitters to a lower percentage, which
we kind of failed to do [Saturday] with
F.van Patak, I think we have a good shot of
winning out there," Vogel said.
