# Grads got the beat: Hip-hop group performs, teaches
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Alter less than a month of practice in Roble Gym. a
group of Stanford graduate students popped and loeked
their way to a successful first performance. The new hip
hop dance group, Soul'd ()ut. started jamming this Janu
ary at the Graduate Community Center; in addition to
performing the group teaches grad students interested in
aerobic exercise and eight-count choreography.
The group was the brain child of four graduate stu
dents— Kelly Thong, a first-year graduate student in
management science and engineering and fifth-year
medical students Sarah Ratanasopa, Dustin Bermudez
and Ryan Louie. Thong and Ratanasopa, having noticed
the large undergraduate interest in hip-hop, were in
spired to form a group of their own for graduate students
and began meeting with dance teams last year to create
new steps.
Soul'd ()ut, which is in the process of obtaining offi
cial recognition from the Office of Student Activities,
holds one- to two-hour dance sessions on weekends and
draws about 20 regular participants. There are no audi
tions and no mandatory attendance policies.
"We invented a group open to everyone to join at any
time to experience dance," Ratanasopa said. "We per
form. but our main purpose is to get students to socialize
and share hip-hop together."
The organizers said they work to make the experience
flexible for students.
"We encourage everyone to come for fun, exercise
and hopefully to make hip-hop dance part of their lives,"
Louie said.
He added that performers self-choreograph and com
pose their own routines by taking turns leading.
"In medical school, we learned the mantra 'see one,
do one, teach one,"' Louie said. "I think this philosophy
also describes the best way to learn hip-hop."
Thong explained, "Our group is special because we
have a different style then most hip-hop groups. We are in
novative and encourage contributions from one another."
Soul'd Out also provides graduate students with a
sense of community, the organizers emphasized.
"We feel that our graduate community is very diverse
with regard to backgrounds, academics and dance expe
riences," Louie said. "Hip-hop is a global experience,
and graduate students can come to our sessions to share
what they believe hip-hop to be."
According to Thong, the diverse attendance at week
end sessions enhances the experience for all dancers.
"We have international students playing different
hip-hop songs from Korea, Taiwan and Japan," she said.
"Dancing is great for relieving stress as well as cultural
sharing."
Soul'd Out performed for the first time at the Stan
ford Taiwanese Student Association Chinese New Year
Party last Saturday in Tresidder's Oak Lounge, and the
group is looking into other opportunities to perform.
"I was excited because it was our first major perfor

mance." Ratanasopa said. "We choreographed it togeth
er. and the final product was amazing."
Soul'd Out also hopes to perform with other ethnic
groups in order to promote the transcendence of hip-hop
across races and ethnicities, the organizers said.
"People should always make hip-hop dance part of
their lives and keep an open mind while enjoying the
rhymes," Louie said.
The group's coordinators said they each discovered
hip-hop in a unique way.
"I first cot interested in hip-hop because it is a way to

express myself using rhyme and motion." Louie said.
"When I was in a lab as an undergrad I started rapping to
remember scientific information. I even made a rap
video, and people commented that they wanted to see
more motion. This inspired me to go into hip-hop dance
so that I could display motion as well as rhymes."
Thong also has past experience in hip-hop. having
taken jazz dance classes as an undergrad and then joining
a gym in Taiwan that taught the dance style.
"When I came to Stanford 1 was depressed because
there was not an open group 1 could join, and so I was

motivated to start my own group that promoted cultural
sharing," she said.
Though Ratanasopa has never trained formally in
hip-hop dance, she said she brings both outside experi
ence and creativity to the group.
"When I was 12 years old a friend talked me into
choreographing a dance and performing in my school tal
ent show," she said. "I consider myself self-taught. I love
the music. I love the movement."

and hopefully to make hip-hop dance part of their lives,"
Louie said.
He added that performers self-choreograph and com
pose their own routines by taking turns leading.
"In medical school, we learned the mantra 'see one,
do one, teach one,"' Louie said. "I think this philosophy
also describes the best way to learn hip-hop."
Thong explained, "Our group is special because we
have a different style then most hip-hop groups. We are in
novative and encourage contributions from one another."
Soul'd Out also provides graduate students with a
sense of community, the organizers emphasized.
"We feel that our graduate community is very diverse
with regard to backgrounds, academics and dance expe
riences," Louie said. "Hip-hop is a global experience,
and graduate students can come to our sessions to share
what they believe hip-hop to be."
According to Thong, the diverse attendance at week
end sessions enhances the experience for all dancers.
"We have international students playing different
hip-hop songs from Korea, Taiwan and Japan," she said.
"Dancing is great for relieving stress as well as cultural
sharing."
Soul'd Out performed for the first time at the Stan
ford Taiwanese Student Association Chinese New Year
Party last Saturday in Tresidder's Oak Lounge, and the
group is looking into other opportunities to perform.
"I was excited because it was our first major perfor

mance." Ratanasopa said. "We choreographed it togeth
er. and the final product was amazing."
Soul'd Out also hopes to perform with other ethnic
groups in order to promote the transcendence of hip-hop
across races and ethnicities, the organizers said.
"People should always make hip-hop dance part of
their lives and keep an open mind while enjoying the
rhymes," Louie said.
The group's coordinators said they each discovered
hip-hop in a unique way.
"I first cot interested in hip-hop because it is a way to

express myself using rhyme and motion." Louie said.
"When I was in a lab as an undergrad I started rapping to
remember scientific information. I even made a rap
video, and people commented that they wanted to see
more motion. This inspired me to go into hip-hop dance
so that I could display motion as well as rhymes."
Thong also has past experience in hip-hop. having
taken jazz dance classes as an undergrad and then joining
a gym in Taiwan that taught the dance style.
"When I came to Stanford 1 was depressed because
there was not an open group 1 could join, and so I was

motivated to start my own group that promoted cultural
sharing," she said.
Though Ratanasopa has never trained formally in
hip-hop dance, she said she brings both outside experi
ence and creativity to the group.
"When I was 12 years old a friend talked me into
choreographing a dance and performing in my school tal
ent show," she said. "I consider myself self-taught. I love
the music. I love the movement."

New graduate student hip-hop group Soul'd Out performs for the first time at the Stanford Taiwanese Student Association Chinese New Year celebration.
Alter less than a month of practice in Roble Gym. a
group of Stanford graduate students popped and loeked
their way to a successful first performance. The new hip
hop dance group, Soul'd ()ut. started jamming this Janu
ary at the Graduate Community Center; in addition to
performing the group teaches grad students interested in
aerobic exercise and eight-count choreography.
The group was the brain child of four graduate stu
dents— Kelly Thong, a first-year graduate student in
management science and engineering and fifth-year
medical students Sarah Ratanasopa, Dustin Bermudez
and Ryan Louie. Thong and Ratanasopa, having noticed
the large undergraduate interest in hip-hop, were in
spired to form a group of their own for graduate students
and began meeting with dance teams last year to create
new steps.
Soul'd ()ut, which is in the process of obtaining offi
cial recognition from the Office of Student Activities,
holds one- to two-hour dance sessions on weekends and
draws about 20 regular participants. There are no audi
tions and no mandatory attendance policies.
"We invented a group open to everyone to join at any
time to experience dance," Ratanasopa said. "We per
form. but our main purpose is to get students to socialize
and share hip-hop together."
The organizers said they work to make the experience
flexible for students.
"We encourage everyone to come for fun, exercise
and hopefully to make hip-hop dance part of their lives,"
Louie said.
He added that performers self-choreograph and com
pose their own routines by taking turns leading.
"In medical school, we learned the mantra 'see one,
do one, teach one,"' Louie said. "I think this philosophy
also describes the best way to learn hip-hop."
