# Room rental costs remain same despite rumors of price increase

### XIN XIE STAFF WRITER 
Despite frequent complaints from
student groups and event planners
about rising room-rental costs on
campus, American Building Mainte
nance. the company that cleans Uni
versity buildings, maintains that rental
fees are no higher than in past years.
"Since we are under an eight year
contract with Stanford, we are not al
lowed to increase costs," said Jose
Gonzalez, operations manager for
ABM. "Our costs have stayed the
same since we began working with
Stanford in 1995."
Gonzalez added that ABM had to
charge the same prices even when the
wages of janitors increased, without
even accounting for inflation.
"Our janitors are union employ
ees, and ABM swallows any wage
hikes they receive." Gonzalez said.
The recent increase in room-clean
ing costs may be due to a greater num
ber of group meetings and events tak
ing place on weekends when costs are
higher. More food served in rented
rooms also translates into expensive
cleaning services.
"We charge more on weekends
and when food is provided because it
usually takes more time to clean up."
Gonzalez said.
Several ABM employees com
mented that students always seem to
be satisfied with the services ABM
provides.
"As far as I know, we have not re
ceived any complaints about prices or

services from Stanford," Gonzalez
said.
He added that a group of Stanford
students has organized a program to
teach janitors English. According to
Gonzalez, these classes were initially
taught two days a week through the
"Habla el Dia" and "Habla la Noche"
programs. Currently, with the sup
port of ABM, the union and in
creased funding, a third day of classes
is taught by a professional instructor.
"Even during the holidays classes
are still in session, as the professor
teaches all three days." Gonzalez
said. "The fact that these students are
spending time to teach our janitors
probably indicates that they are
pleased with the service."
Despite the criticism of some stu
dents, many others have expressed
satisfaction with ABM.
"1 am thankful that the cleaning
company is providing us the service,"
said sophomore Casey Irvin, member
of Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship,
which rents space for meetings.
Those who are unhappy with the
current rental fees contend that the
University should cover these costs.
"When 1 was at Vanderbilt Uni
versity. we did not have to pay for
renting rooms," said Ibrahim al-
Mojel, a third-year graduate student
in management science and engineer
ing and president of the Islamic Soci
ety of Stanford University. "If depart
ments do not have to pay to use class
rooms, then Stanford should cover
the costs of renting rooms for student
groups."
