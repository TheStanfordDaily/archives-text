# The 						Donk makes its network television debut
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
Whether it's on its way to one of
the Band's rallies or rolling down
the Row on a Saturday night, it's
hard not to notice the
Badonkadonk.
The stout, armored vehicle that
transports drums by day and party
goers by night has certainly gotten
its fair share confused looks from
students. Now. the affectionately
termed "Donk" is turning heads
nationwide.
The Donk is expected to be fea
tured on MTV's "Wildboyz," along
with other gadgets, like a flame
thrower and a water cannon, all
built by Donk creator Neal Or
mond. Class of 2001. "Wildboyz"
features two MTV personalities
who perform crazy stunts, often
dangerous, and often featuring ani
mals.
"They're going to be filming out
in California in March," said Or
mond. who is known as Nelly to the
Band. "It sounds like a pretty laid

back crew."
The Donk, a motorized tank
that's often compared to Jabba the
Hutt's sail barge from "Return of
the Jedi." was first noticed in Octo
ber when Amazon asked Ormond
to put it up for sale on its Web site.
At $19,999.95, the Donk has yet to
receive any offers, but Ormond has
talked to some potential buyers.
"Unfortunately, people who
have $20,(1)0 in discretionary in
come are not the type of people
who want to drive something like
this." Ormond said. "There have
been a few people with minor inter
est — one guy says he might be get
ting a raise and would buy it. I want
to tell him if he gets a raise, this isn't
what he should be spending his
money on."
Ormond built the Donk in the
summer of 2002 with fellow band
member J.L. Podgurski. Class of
2001, as a way to carry around their
heavy drums.
"We'd built a couple man-pow
ered vehicles for Band events, and
around that point we decided we

wanted to do something with a
motor on it," Ormond said. "It just
kind of came together from there."
Podgurski is now on the East
Coast, but Ormond, who lives in
Palo Alto, takes the Donk to the
Burning Man art festival in Nevada
and is pretty much the only Band
member who drives it around cam
pus.
'it's really such a quirky thing —
it's reverse steering, and the engine
is really particular," Ormond said.
Besides the tricky steering, Or
mond also noted that driving the
Donk can be a challenge since it's
not the most discreet vehicle.
"Obviously, if we're taking it out
on a party night, one of the consid
erations is DUls," Ormond said.
"Early on there was a lot more con
fusion with the police, but for the
most part they were cool with it.
There was one officer who tracked
me from SAE to Phi Psi and pulled
me over."

Neal Ormond often takes his creation the Badonkadonk, which is primari
ly for the use of the Band, to the Burning Man art festival in Nevada.
Clearly, the Donk is a one of a kind, so if any
one is willing to fork out the $19,999.95 for it,
Ormond said he'd build a new one rather than
sell the original. Ormond said he never truly in
tended to sell the Donk, but put it up on his com
pany Web site simply as a marketing device.
Ormond started his company, NAO Design,
in the spring of his senior year. He stuck with it
when,£s an art major, he was unable to find a
job in product design. Most of his business
comes from doing graphic design and selling
home furnishings like lamps and tables.
"The real fun is in the Donk and flame
throwers and air cannons and stuff like that,"
Ormond said of his business.
Ormond acknowledged that $19,999.95
seems pretty steep fora vehicle of the Donk's
size, but said it's a pretty fair price, considering
the amount of labor that went into it.
The construction costs came to about
$8,000, Ormond said, and he and Podgurski
spent three months working on it, almost all
day, every day. He said they carved flat sheets
of metal into the ovular shape the Donk has
now by attaching a big bracket to a tree and,
with the leverage of a beam, curving the metal
sheets around the tree.
"Everything was built with a lot of bolts and
nuts and drilling thousands of holes — that
probably contributed to the time factor," Or
mond said. "There was a lot of hammering,
grinding, bending — basically forcing the stuff
into shape."

The finished product is a sturdy little tank
that can fit up to five people, or two to three
comfortably.
"It's pretty nice," Ormond said. "It's mostly
carpeted, and we've got pillows, black lights.
The stereo faces out through the metal mesh
windows. The cabin itself is definitely a cool,
cozy place."
While the Donk may be more comfortable
than it looks, the novelty of it is what really
makes it a good ride, according to senior Chris
Chan, who was the drum section leader in 2003.
"Between rehearsals, we'll bring it to the
Treehouse, and we'll be eating around it,
bumping music really loud," Chan said. "It's
fun because some people will walk by with
quizzical looks and some will ask us about it."
According to Ormond. one of the Donk's
greatest uses is prompting "spontaneous par
ties."
"1 had some friends over last winter, and I
took them out to see the Donk," Ormond ex
plained. "There were some people lighting can
dles and listening to music out in the Quad for
someone's birthday, so we plugged their music
into the Donk, which had better speakers.
"Twenty minutes later, the party's in full
swing, everyone's drinking, the driver had
clearly been drinking and the cops pull up. But
it turns out one cop hadn't seen it before, so
they just wanted to get a closer look."
And where, one might wonder, did the
Badonkadonk get its name?
"Once we were part way through, we decid
ed to think about names — a potential one was

"Armadillo,' but nothing really jumped out at
us," Ormond said. "We were sitting around
having a few beers, watching 'Crank Yankers.'

and they used the word Badonkadonk,' and it
fit the bill. We knew right then that's what it had
to be called."'
