# The
						Donk makes its network television debut

### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
Whether it's on its way to one of
the Band's rallies or rolling down
the Row on a Saturday night, it's
hard not to notice the
Badonkadonk.
The stout, armored vehicle that
transports drums by day and party
goers by night has certainly gotten
its fair share confused looks from
students. Now. the affectionately
termed "Donk" is turning heads
nationwide.
The Donk is expected to be fea
tured on MTV's "Wildboyz," along
with other gadgets, like a flame
thrower and a water cannon, all
built by Donk creator Neal Or
mond. Class of 2001. "Wildboyz"
features two MTV personalities
who perform crazy stunts, often
dangerous, and often featuring ani
mals.
"They're going to be filming out
in California in March," said Or
mond. who is known as Nelly to the
Band. "It sounds like a pretty laid

back crew."
The Donk, a motorized tank
that's often compared to Jabba the
Hutt's sail barge from "Return of
the Jedi." was first noticed in Octo
ber when Amazon asked Ormond
to put it up for sale on its Web site.
At $19,999.95, the Donk has yet to
receive any offers, but Ormond has
talked to some potential buyers.
"Unfortunately, people who
have $20,(1)0 in discretionary in
come are not the type of people
who want to drive something like
this." Ormond said. "There have
been a few people with minor inter
est — one guy says he might be get
ting a raise and would buy it. I want
to tell him if he gets a raise, this isn't
what he should be spending his
money on."
Ormond built the Donk in the
summer of 2002 with fellow band
member J.L. Podgurski. Class of
2001, as a way to carry around their
heavy drums.
"We'd built a couple man-pow
ered vehicles for Band events, and
around that point we decided we

wanted to do something with a
motor on it," Ormond said. "It just
kind of came together from there."
Podgurski is now on the East
Coast, but Ormond, who lives in
Palo Alto, takes the Donk to the
Burning Man art festival in Nevada
and is pretty much the only Band
member who drives it around cam
pus.
'it's really such a quirky thing —
it's reverse steering, and the engine
is really particular," Ormond said.
Besides the tricky steering, Or
mond also noted that driving the
Donk can be a challenge since it's
not the most discreet vehicle.
"Obviously, if we're taking it out
on a party night, one of the consid
erations is DUls," Ormond said.
"Early on there was a lot more con
fusion with the police, but for the
most part they were cool with it.
There was one officer who tracked
me from SAE to Phi Psi and pulled
me over."
