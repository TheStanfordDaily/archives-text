# Textbook prices continue to escalate
## 
### LAURA CARWILE 
Freshman Clea Alspin returned from
winter break this year eager to start her
new classes — that is. until she saw her
Stanford Bookstore bill totaling over
$300 textbooks for four classes.
Alsip's experience is not uncommon, as
many students now expect to drop several
hundred dollars for books each quarter.
In response to rising costs, the Califor
nia Student Public Interest Research
Group — an organization that makes pol
icy recommendations based on research
— teamed up with other interest groups to
compile a report entitled "Rip-off 101:
How the Publishing Industry's Practices
Needlessly Drive Up Textbook Costs."
Based on faculty and student inter
views, the report concluded that text
book prices will only continue to climb
nationwide.
The average college student spends
$898 per academic year on textbooks, the
report stated. According to a survey of
University of California students, this fig
ure represents about 20 percent of aver
age tuition and fees for in-state students
at public four-year universities. This find
ing stands in stark contrast to that of a

similar 1997 survey which reported $642
as the average annual price for textbooks.
While these numbers are based solely
on the University of California system,
•the report said they have broad implica
tions for all schools since textbook prices
are fairly consistent nationwide.
According to a faculty questionnaire,
65 percent of faculty members said they
"rarely or "never" use extra materials
such as CDs and workbooks that come
bundled with textbooks, upping the price.
A textbook packaged with additional fea
tures can cost up to twice as much as the
book alone, the report stated.
Even though some students are able to
borrow books from friends who have al
ready taken classes, the constant release
of new editions forces students to buy the
most updated versions even if there is lit
tle content change, the report said.
Although 40 percent of questioned
faculty members said the replacement of
old editions is "rarely" or "never" justi
fied," many continue to request the
newest releases. A new textbook can cost
up to 58 percent more than a used one,
the report stated.
To alleviate these costs, 87 percent of
faculty members in the UC system sur

veyed said they would encourage compa
nies to publish new information in a
cheaper supplement instead of releasing
an entirely new book.
The report makes several recommen
dations. including the increased use of on
line textbooks, which could dramatically
lower printing costs as well. It also sug
gests that professors should stop using
textbook editions that come with unneces
sary extras. Student-textbook swap pro
grams and on-campus book-rental pro
grams are also advocated by the report.
Several students have launched Web
site that network students looking to buy
and sell their textbooks for higher prices
than they can get at the Bookstore, when
trying to sell books back.
Yet most Stanford students have turned
to the large Internet booksellers, such as
Amazon.com, to cut textbook costs.
"It's a whole lot cheaper, used or
new," freshman Vivek Saraswat said. "If
you want extra money in your pocket,
buy your books from Amazon."
Freshman Ming Zhi also purchased
his books on the popular site.
"Even after individual shipping and
handling costs, the price was much lower
