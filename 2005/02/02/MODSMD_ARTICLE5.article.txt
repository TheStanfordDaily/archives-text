## 
### NILA BALA STAFF WRITER 
Last night's Undergraduate Sen
ate meeting focused primarily on
budget modifications for four
groups: the Stanford Band, the
Black Community Service Center,
the Black Psychology Student Asso
ciation and Stanford Students for
Life. A large part of the meeting
concentrated on whether or not
funds should be granted retroactive
ly for unforeseen costs.
Junior Becca Fogel, the financial
manager for the Stanford Band, ex
plained that the group's annual
alumni newsletter had created un
foreseen postage costs due to an un
derestimation of the number of
alumni. She requested that money
be moved from the Band's equip
ment budget to their postage alloca
tion.
"The mailing of 3.000 newsletters
came to $1,100," she said. "It wasn't
in the original budget because we
didn't realize the costs. This money is
important because an active alumni
base is really important to fund us."
The Black Community Service
Center had similar concerns regard
ing a special issue of The Real News
for alumni, as well as posters and
honoraria for Black Liberation
month. The Senate passed all three
budget modifications, and decided
that the posters in particular were a
special exception to the general
poster allocation amount.
"The poster is actually a calen
dar," said Black Community Service
Center representative Aneto
Okonkwo. a junior and Daily writer.
"Unlike most posters that are for
daily or weekly events, this poster
lasts for months and includes many
student groups."
A new student group to be in
cluded on the poster, the Black Psy
chology Student Association, ap
proached the Senate when a faculty
dinner cost turned out to be higher
then anticipated.
"We were forced to use Stanford
Catering, which charged $570," said
