# Senate decides on budget revisions
## 
### NILA BALA STAFF WRITER 
Last night's Undergraduate Sen
ate meeting focused primarily on
budget modifications for four
groups: the Stanford Band, the
Black Community Service Center,
the Black Psychology Student Asso
ciation and Stanford Students for
Life. A large part of the meeting
concentrated on whether or not
funds should be granted retroactive
ly for unforeseen costs.
Junior Becca Fogel, the financial
manager for the Stanford Band, ex
plained that the group's annual
alumni newsletter had created un
foreseen postage costs due to an un
derestimation of the number of
alumni. She requested that money
be moved from the Band's equip
ment budget to their postage alloca
tion.
"The mailing of 3.000 newsletters
came to $1,100," she said. "It wasn't
in the original budget because we
didn't realize the costs. This money is
important because an active alumni
base is really important to fund us."
The Black Community Service
Center had similar concerns regard
ing a special issue of The Real News
for alumni, as well as posters and
honoraria for Black Liberation
month. The Senate passed all three
budget modifications, and decided
that the posters in particular were a
special exception to the general
poster allocation amount.
"The poster is actually a calen
dar," said Black Community Service
Center representative Aneto
Okonkwo. a junior and Daily writer.
"Unlike most posters that are for
daily or weekly events, this poster
lasts for months and includes many
student groups."
A new student group to be in
cluded on the poster, the Black Psy
chology Student Association, ap
proached the Senate when a faculty
dinner cost turned out to be higher
then anticipated.
"We were forced to use Stanford
Catering, which charged $570," said
junior Jennifer O'Neil of the BPSA.
"The Black Community Service
Center was forced to pay for it. I
know the ASSU doesn't like to ap
prove things retroactively but we are
a new organization and this hap
pens."
She added that the organization
had predicted 30 people to attend
and instead ended up with a turnout
of 50.
O'Neil and others, including
sophomore Dennis Adams, the rep

resentative from Stanford Students
for life, commented on the Senate's
apparent reluctance to approve
unanticipated costs retroactively.
Senator Shani Fregia, a senior,
disagreed with this perception.
"The senate doesn't have a prob
lem with funding things retroactive
ly," she said. "We just have to be
careful not to set a precedent for
groups to be irresponsible with their
spending."
Senator Adrian Boscolo-High-

Students groups ask Senate
for retroactive budget changes

tower, a junior, agreed that while the
ASSU Senate is sympathetic to bud
get modifications, it is rightfully
wary.
"I really feel for groups that come
to the Senate and have spent money
from their own pocket," he said. "1
know what that feels like. It's hap
pened to me, but I feel like we made
appropriation decisions fora reason
and need to be cognizant of that."
