# On this day in Stanford History...

On Feb. 2, 1959, The Daily wrote
a story about the "Smoke-chasers,"
the noble Stanford students working
on staff with the Fire Department.
Below is an excerpt:
"With the blast of the old Stanford
fire whistle seven student firemen
drop their books, run out of lecture
halls, or dispense with whatever else
they are doing and run for the fire
house.
"These are the men who are work
ing their way through Stanford by
fighting fire for our unique fire de
partment, which is manned by 10
regular and 14 student firemen who
take turns every other day working
24-hour shirts.
"Under the veteran direction of
John M. Marston, chief of the Uni
versity division, the primarily stu
dent organization battles from 150 to
300 fires a year to protect the
school's $65 million worth of proper
ty which ranges over more than
8,000 acres of land.
"Even though the traffic problem
is making travel difficult to any point
on our huge campus, Stanford's
rugged student and regular 'smoke
chasers' rarely fail to make a blaze
inside the five-minute limit that is
the most critical in determining
whether it will be controlled or lost.
"Chief Marston pointed out that
in the many years that he has been
working on the Stanford fire crew,
he has never known there to be a fire
casualty. This perfect record, he
said, is due largely to the co-opera
tion and efforts of the students them
selves. not firemen."
On Feb. 2, 1965, The Daily pub
lished a short comical article about
some "doggy" business occurring on
Stanford campus. Below is an ex

cerpt:
"Nothing is sacred nowadays at
'depersonalized' Stanford. Not even
dogs — distinguished dogs, at that.
"It seems the county dog catcher
has been raiding the campus in re
cent weeks, rounding up all stray
hounds. One such victim was a fair
ly obese golden retriever named
Heidi.
"Heidi was first spotted at the
Santa Clara dog pound buy a Stan
ford professor's wife, who was there
seeking her own empounded dog.
" 'For heaven's sake!' she ex
claimed, upon seeing Heidi. 'What
are you doing here?'
"The woman then turned to the
keeper.
" 'You sure hit the jackpot,' she
said. 'That's the President Sterling's
dog."
On Feb. 2, 1965, The Daily also
covered a brief article about Martin
Luther King Jr. and his nationally fa
mous Selma, Alabama demonstra
tion. Below is an excerpt:
"Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was
arrested with 256 other Negroes dur
ing a right-to-vote protest march
yesterday, and he refused to post
bond when called' before a magis
trate.
"King's arrest came as he led a
group of about 300 adult Negroes
from a church toward the court
house to dramatize again their de
mands for speedier and more lenient
voter registration.
"Unless he posts bond he will re
main in jail until his case is heard on
Feb. 15. Maximum penalty for the
offense under the city is 180 days in
jail and a $100 fine."
