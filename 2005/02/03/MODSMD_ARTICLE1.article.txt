## Surging Cardinal get another crack at Diogu as second half of Pac-10 season begins 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
When the men's basketball team travels to
face Arizona State tonight and Arizona on Sat
urday, it will be looking fora ticket to second
place in the Pacific-10 Conference standings.
All Matt Haryasz is looking for is a ticket
—or two. The junior forward from Page,
Ariz, has any number of family and friends
who would love to come see him play, but
players only get four seats per road game.
"I've been trying to get some of my team
mates to give me theirs," Haryasz said. "I
know it might look selfish, but this is the only
weekend I really need tickets for."
It's a homecoming for Haryasz, but the
Cardinal (12-7, 6-3 Pac-10) will revisit a less
pleasant experience: their last loss, over a
month ago, an 81-69 defeat at the hands of the
Sun Devils (15-6, 4-5). Junior point guard

Chris Hernandez sat
that game out with
back spasms, the Car
dinal had trouble
making lay-ups and
Arizona forward Ike
Diogu scored 28
points and pulled
down 15 rebounds.
But Hernandez
returned for the next
game, shots started
finding the net, and
Stanford has not seen
Diogu — until now.
The Cardinal head to
the desert as the con
ference's hottest
team, hoping to build
on a six-game win
ning streak that has
them one game out of
first place.
While junior
guard Dan Grun
feld's offensive out
put has remained
steady, a number of

Stanford players have stepped up their games
during the streak. Hernandez's shot has im
proved; senior forward Rob Little has pro
vided an inside presence; junior guard Jason
Haas has shared the point guard duties and
relieved some of the pressure on Hernandez;
and, most recently, sophomore guard Fred
Washington has emerged as a valuable role
player, scoring a season-high eight points
against Oregon on Saturday.
But Haryasz has made perhaps the most
dramatic improvement. He scored 20 points
and pulled down 20 boards against Oregon
on Saturday, earning him Sporting News
Player of the Week honors. Things have
opened up for Haryasz on the offensive end
of late.
"Rob has been doing a good job rebound
ing and he's hitting his hook shot," Haryasz
said. "In the start of the season, Rob and I
were getting doubled every game. I think
now, we're probably getting more one-on
one opportunities."
Haryasz has taken advantage, averaging
16.3 points and 12.5 rebounds per game — a
stat line that looks a lot like that of Diogu,
who leads the conference with 21.2 points and
10.2 rebounds per game.
The Cardinal will do everything they can
to limit Diogu tonight.
"We have a better idea of how good Ike
is," head coach Trent Johnson said. "What
surprised us is that when we came down to
double him last game, he stepped away from
the basket and made three short jump shots."
Haryasz and Little have been more ag
gressive on the defensive end and more active
on the boards, but everything pretty much
goes out the window against Diogu.
"If Shaq wants to leave Miami and come
over and help, then we might have a shot,"
Johnson said. "If he gets the ball in the post we'll
send a guy down there. We'll try to front him, to
play straight behind him, whatever works."
The Cardinal might be able to limit Diogu
even without the Big Aristotle. Diogu has
scored 15 points or less in each of his last
three games, but Arizona State managed to
win two of the three. The Sun Devils lost to
Washington on Sunday, 79-70, but were with
in reach until the final couple of minutes.
While Stanford tries to move to the top of
the Pac-10, Arizona State is working to assert
itself in the middle of the conference. The
team is perched in a precarious three-way tie
for fifth place.

The Sun Devils have more weapons than
just Diogu, and will rely on contributions
from Kevin Kruger, who averages 10.4 points
per game off the bench, and point guard
Steve Moore, who scored 19 points in the
teams' last meeting.
It will make a difference to have Hernan
dez guarding Moore this time around. Since
his return, Hernandez has shut down some of
the best guards in the Pac-10, including Ari
zona's Mustafa Shakur, California's Richard
Midgley and UCLA's Jordan Farmar. The
team as a whole has upped its defensive ef
fort, limiting opponents to 39.2 percent from
the field.
"I know I didn't play particularly well on
defense in [the Arizona State] game,"
Haryasz said. "We didn't look like we had
much energy that game. We weren't getting
back on D nearly as well as we are now. I
think going there, having Chris back is huge,
but also I think our energy will be up and we'll
look fora little revenge, a little payback."
Johnson agreed that the team has made
strides on the defensive end.
"We have been defending more intelli
gently," Johnson said. "We hurt ourselves be
cause of fouls early on. We have been limiting
transition baskets, we've done well playing
team defense and rotating, helping out.
We're playing with a sense of urgency. We
understand that we can't rest on defense be
cause these teams can come from behind."
The Cardinal will have a big defensive
challenge on Saturday against Arizona's
stacked lineup, but a win over the Sun Devils
and Wildcats would move Stanford into — at
the very least — a tie for second place. They
are inching closer to the conference lead, a
possibility that seemed dead after they lost to
Arizona State at home.
Arizona head coach Lute Olson thinks the
conference is still wide open.
"I said at the start of the season that I
thought whoever won it could have four or
five losses, and I don't think the picture has
changed a whole lot," Olson said. "Stanford
has come on to be what we all expected them
to be at the start of the season."
Haryasz has recently become everything
Stanford fans thought he could be — and
more. Now he and the Cardinal will set their
sights on Diogu. And, of course, the tickets.
"I could use as many as I can get," he said.
"I've still got a lot of family and friends out
there."

fort, limiting opponents to 39.2 percent from
the field.
"I know I didn't play particularly well on
defense in [the Arizona State] game,"
Haryasz said. "We didn't look like we had
much energy that game. We weren't getting
back on D nearly as well as we are now. I
think going there, having Chris back is huge,
but also I think our energy will be up and we'll
look fora little revenge, a little payback."
Johnson agreed that the team has made
strides on the defensive end.
"We have been defending more intelli
gently," Johnson said. "We hurt ourselves be
cause of fouls early on. We have been limiting
transition baskets, we've done well playing
team defense and rotating, helping out.
We're playing with a sense of urgency. We
understand that we can't rest on defense be
cause these teams can come from behind."
The Cardinal will have a big defensive
challenge on Saturday against Arizona's
stacked lineup, but a win over the Sun Devils
and Wildcats would move Stanford into — at
the very least — a tie for second place. They
are inching closer to the conference lead, a
possibility that seemed dead after they lost to
Arizona State at home.
Arizona head coach Lute Olson thinks the
conference is still wide open.
"I said at the start of the season that I
thought whoever won it could have four or
five losses, and I don't think the picture has
changed a whole lot," Olson said. "Stanford
has come on to be what we all expected them
to be at the start of the season."
Haryasz has recently become everything
Stanford fans thought he could be — and
more. Now he and the Cardinal will set their
sights on Diogu. And, of course, the tickets.
"I could use as many as I can get," he said.
"I've still got a lot of family and friends out
there."

Riding a six-game winning streak, a pair of wins for junior point guard Chris Hernan
dez and the Cardinal in the desert would vault Stanford into at least a tie for second
place in the Pac-10 standings.
When the men's basketball team travels to
face Arizona State tonight and Arizona on Sat
urday, it will be looking fora ticket to second
place in the Pacific-10 Conference standings.
All Matt Haryasz is looking for is a ticket
—or two. The junior forward from Page,
Ariz, has any number of family and friends
who would love to come see him play, but
players only get four seats per road game.
"I've been trying to get some of my team
mates to give me theirs," Haryasz said. "I
know it might look selfish, but this is the only
weekend I really need tickets for."
It's a homecoming for Haryasz, but the
Cardinal (12-7, 6-3 Pac-10) will revisit a less
pleasant experience: their last loss, over a
month ago, an 81-69 defeat at the hands of the
Sun Devils (15-6, 4-5). Junior point guard

Chris Hernandez sat
that game out with
back spasms, the Car
dinal had trouble
making lay-ups and
Arizona forward Ike
Diogu scored 28
points and pulled
down 15 rebounds.
But Hernandez
returned for the next
game, shots started
finding the net, and
Stanford has not seen
Diogu — until now.
The Cardinal head to
the desert as the con
ference's hottest
team, hoping to build
on a six-game win
ning streak that has
them one game out of
first place.
While junior
guard Dan Grun
feld's offensive out
put has remained
steady, a number of

Stanford players have stepped up their games
during the streak. Hernandez's shot has im
proved; senior forward Rob Little has pro
vided an inside presence; junior guard Jason
Haas has shared the point guard duties and
relieved some of the pressure on Hernandez;
and, most recently, sophomore guard Fred
Washington has emerged as a valuable role
player, scoring a season-high eight points
against Oregon on Saturday.
But Haryasz has made perhaps the most
dramatic improvement. He scored 20 points
and pulled down 20 boards against Oregon
on Saturday, earning him Sporting News
Player of the Week honors. Things have
opened up for Haryasz on the offensive end
of late.
"Rob has been doing a good job rebound
ing and he's hitting his hook shot," Haryasz
said. "In the start of the season, Rob and I
were getting doubled every game. I think
now, we're probably getting more one-on
one opportunities."
Haryasz has taken advantage, averaging
16.3 points and 12.5 rebounds per game — a
stat line that looks a lot like that of Diogu,
who leads the conference with 21.2 points and
10.2 rebounds per game.
The Cardinal will do everything they can
to limit Diogu tonight.
"We have a better idea of how good Ike
is," head coach Trent Johnson said. "What
surprised us is that when we came down to
double him last game, he stepped away from
the basket and made three short jump shots."
Haryasz and Little have been more ag
gressive on the defensive end and more active
on the boards, but everything pretty much
goes out the window against Diogu.
"If Shaq wants to leave Miami and come
over and help, then we might have a shot,"
Johnson said. "If he gets the ball in the post we'll
send a guy down there. We'll try to front him, to
play straight behind him, whatever works."
The Cardinal might be able to limit Diogu
even without the Big Aristotle. Diogu has
scored 15 points or less in each of his last
three games, but Arizona State managed to
win two of the three. The Sun Devils lost to
Washington on Sunday, 79-70, but were with
in reach until the final couple of minutes.
While Stanford tries to move to the top of
the Pac-10, Arizona State is working to assert
itself in the middle of the conference. The
team is perched in a precarious three-way tie
for fifth place.

The Sun Devils have more weapons than
just Diogu, and will rely on contributions
from Kevin Kruger, who averages 10.4 points
per game off the bench, and point guard
Steve Moore, who scored 19 points in the
teams' last meeting.
It will make a difference to have Hernan
dez guarding Moore this time around. Since
his return, Hernandez has shut down some of
the best guards in the Pac-10, including Ari
zona's Mustafa Shakur, California's Richard
Midgley and UCLA's Jordan Farmar. The
team as a whole has upped its defensive ef
fort, limiting opponents to 39.2 percent from
the field.
"I know I didn't play particularly well on
defense in [the Arizona State] game,"
Haryasz said. "We didn't look like we had
