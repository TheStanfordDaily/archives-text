# Business prof. advises president on tax reform
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Edward Lazear. professor at the Gradu
ate School of Business and senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution, has been appointed
to the President's Advisory Panel on Fed
eral Tax Reform.
Lazear has taught at the Business
School since 1992 and will continue to do so
during his six-month tenure on the panel.
He has also served as president of the Soci
ety of Labor Economists and the founding
editor of the Journal of Labor Economics.
He has authored the book "Personnel Eco
nomics."
Yet none of these issue-specific achieve
ments were responsible for his appoint
ment to the panel on tax reform, Lazear
said. In fact, it was his lack of official back
ground on the issue of tax economics that
helped him win the post.
"I don't have any predetermined,
staked-out position [on tax reform] â€” I'm
completely open," Lazear said. This kind of
objectivity is just what President George
W. Bush needs from the members of the
panel, he said.
In the executive order that established
the tax advisory panel, Bush outlined its
purpose as threefold.
It was created to "share the burdens and
benefits of the Federal tax structure...

while recognizing the importance of home
ownership and charity in American soci
ety," as well as to "promote long-run eco
nomic growth and job creation... so as to
strengthen the competitiveness of the Unit
ed States in the global marketplace."
But, most importantly, the tax panel will
be charged with simplifying the existing
federal tax laws. .
Lazear said that "complications [in the
tax system] costa significant amount of re
sources." estimating that as much as 10 per
cent of what is collected gets needlessly
spent on the administrative burden of com
plying with convoluted tax laws.
According to Bush's executive order,
the panel must submit its advisory report to
his office by July 31,2005, and its existence
will terminate soon after.
Until then, Lazear expects to be
stretched somewhat thin between his Stan
ford commitments and his responsibility to
the President.
"There's no question that my research
speed will be somewhat reduced, but I
think the assignment is an important one -
it's something that can significantly help
the state of the country," he said.
Dean Robert Joss of the GSB said he is
not too worried about Lazear being dis
tracted from his work at Stanford.
"These kinds of things come up
from time to time," Joss said. "I
think it's important for people with
expertise to provide that expertise
in the national interest."
Joss added, "(Lazear| is the type
of person that will make time for
everything, all of his interests. He's
certainly a good choice, because
he's certainly an international
leader in the field."
