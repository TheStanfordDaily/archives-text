# Overseas service groups elicit liability concerns
## 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Increasing concern for the safety of student human
itarians is causing the University to reconsider its poli
cies towards new groups that work on international
service projects.
Organizations like Moving Mountains, which con
centrates on work in Haiti, and Students for Interna
tional Change, aimed at increasing HIV / AIDS aware
ness in Tanzania, have been warned of a possible mora
torium on the approval of new groups with an overseas
focus due to the University's liability concerns.
"We are currently undergoing the application
process with the Office of Student Activities, but they
told me about the risk management moratorium," said
Jason Kerwin, an organizer of Students for Interna
tional Change. "They are concerned that there is too
great of a liability."
Kerwin added that he hopes the request for OSA
approval will be granted, but thinks there is a good
chance the moratorium will present a problem.
This increased scrutiny was not prompted by any
change to global security, but rather a growing reluc
tance to increase the University's liability.
Jon McConnell, the student development programs
director at the Haas Center for Public Service, is meet
ing with staff members at the Office of Student Affairs

next week to discuss concerns and possible solutions.
"We are looking at how we can work most creative
ly with groups that want to do international projects,"
McConnell said. "We want to work with risk manage
ment to determine the current reality and seek possi
ble solutions."
The moratorium does not affect any groups current
ly funded through the Haas Center or other campus de
partments. In fact, the Haas Center increased the num
ber of international fellowships it offers this year.
However, all University grants are restricted by the
International Travel Policy, a memo written by Uni
versity Provost John Etchemendy, which orders that
travel be restricted to countries under a State Depart
ment Travel Warning, or "where there is other reliable
information of significant health or safety risks."
The Risk Management Department evaluates the
danger by country and city using information from iJET
Travel, a private firm that advises clients on travel risks.
Their program provides up-to-date information regard
ing the current dangers of any given location.
For instance, yesterday it warned against flooding in
Ghana, social unrest in Bangladesh and snowstorms in
southern Germany. All of these factors are considered
when University insurance companies determine the li
ability involved in supporting student travel to poten-
tially risky locations.
"Insurance companies are very conserva
tive," said Jo Thome, administrative associate
in the risk management department. "Tradi
tionally, they don't fund people who want to
travel to very dangerous countries. It doesn't
make sense for them."
Sophomore Tapiwa Mabaye is one such stu
dent. A native Zimbabwean, Mabaye wanted
to conduct research in his home country this
summer. However, given the nation's poor list
ing with the State Department, he was unable
to obtain University funding for his studies.
While Mabaye is forced to take his research
elsewhere, he said he understands Stanford's
concern.
"In my case it is complicated, me being
from Zimbabwe and Zimbabwe being on the
travel ban list," he said. "But generally, I un
derstand why they have the policy."
Underscoring the new policy is the memo
ry' of Amy Biehl, a Stanford graduate stabbed
to death in South Africa in 1993 while travel
ing on a Truman Scholarship. Her memory is
memorialized in the Amy Biehl Fellowship,
which supports service projects in Cape Town.
