# University reclaims, renovates stables
## 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
These days there aren't any
long faces around Stanford's
Red Barn — except maybe on
the horses.
The University has re
claimed the Equestrian Center
and historic Red Barn and is
currently upgrading the site.
"It's going to he one of the
nicest collegiate equine facili
ties in the country and probably
one of the nicer equine facilities
in the country," said Vanessa
Bartsch. general manager of
the Equestrian Center and the
equestrian team's head coach.
The renovations include
the complete rebuilding of the
auxiliary barn. Each new stall
will feature therapeutic sleep
ing mats for horses, lights,
water bowls that automatically
refill, open-air windows and
new environmentally friendly
bedding. The University is
also constructing a new show
arena and will improve the
quality of the facility's pad
docks.
An old brick barn built in the
late 19th century will be con
verted into a clubhouse for the
equestrian team — complete
with offices, meeting rooms and

a small museum. No major up
grades have been made to the
Red Barn, however, due to its
historical status. Bartsch said
she expects most of the renova
tions to be finished by March.
The facility had been under
the control of Equestrian Asso
ciates, an off-campus company,
for the past 20 years. But the
University declined to renew its
lease when it expired in August.
"Stanford decided to con
tinue running the barn as a
boarding stable, but with more
focus on students," Bartsch
said. "The board rate is as ex
pensive for students as non
students," she added, which is
not typical of University facili
ties like the golf course, which
gives student discounts. Stu
dent prices may lower when
the new center is complete.
Before the lease expired,
Equestrian Associates boarded
109 horses on the property.
With the construction in
progress, 45 of them are now
living in a large rented tent,
while other horse-owners have
opted to use different stables.
Members of the equestrian
team are enthusiastic about the
new facilities.
"It's a big step up from where
we were before," said English

Captain Jarret Guajardo, a
sophomore. "It's going to be re
ally good for the horses and for
the team."
Team President Alex Her
bert, a junior, agreed.
"I think it's great for the
team and community to have
such a great facility on cam
pus," she said. "I'm happy the
University is putting money

into making facilities better and
bringing them up to date."
The new center will give stu
dents a taste of one of the
world's most expensive sports,
Bartsch added.
"At Stanford, it's a chance
for people to take lessons with
out being part of the riding
elite," he said. "My beginners
ride $80,000 to $ 100.000 horses."
