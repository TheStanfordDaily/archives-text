On Feb. 3, 1982, The Daily updated a story
about stolen Law School property found in the
Delta Upsilon fraternity. lielow is an excerpt:
"The Palo Alto district attorney's office has
declined to file charges of possession of stolen
property against members of the Delta Upsilon
(DU) fraternity at this time.
"Fraternity members faced possible prose
cution for possession of more than $5000 in fur
niture allegedly stolen from the Law School and
other University departments, said Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington yesterday.
"Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyersaid
the district attorney's office is strictly interpret
ing provisions of the penal code because suc
cessful prosecution requires proof beyond a
reasonable doubt that individuals knowingly'
possess stolen property.
"Maintenance workers, thinking they might
have found furniture reported missing from the
Law School since October, notified Stanford
police, who entered the fraternity with a search
warrant on Dec. !?0.
"Officers confiscated tables, chairs, sofas
and other office furniture from 21 members'
rooms. Police also removed small amounts of
marijuana and hashish from two rooms.
"Herrington said because so many fraternity
members are involved in the case, police have
been unable to prove exactly who knew the
property was stolen. 'No one disputes the furni
ture was stolen, but we need to prove specifical
ly who stole it,' he said.
"Niemeyer said his officers will continue
their investigation and have several leads, but
have so far had difficulty in locating possible
sources of information."

On Feb. 3, 1999, The Daily published a story
about a possible Labor Department probe of the
University due to alleged gender discrimination.
Below is an excerpt:
"The U.S. Department of Labor is reviewing
a complaint filed last November by eight Stan
ford faculty and staff members alleging gender
discrimination in University hiring and promo
tion practices including tenure, a Labor Depart
ment spokesman confirmed today.
'"No one in this complaint is asking fora
preference,' said former Asst. History Prof.
Karen Sawislak, one of the complainants.
'We're asking to be evaluated based on our
qualifications."'
"Sawislak, an expert on labor history who is
currently a research fellow at Harvard, con
tributed to a 400-page report written by female
faculty and staff last year on instances of alleged
gender discrimination within the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, the Medical School, the
Law School and the School of Education.
"The report addressed issues ranging from
'promotion to appointment to hostile climate to
wrongful termination,' Sawislak said.
"University Provost Condoleezza Rice de
fended Stanford's policies.
'"We do everything we can to diversity the
faculty,' Rice said. But, she said, 'I think you
cannot do anything which establishes a separate
standard for hiring or promotion.'
"'We're still fleshing out the complaint,'
Labor Department spokesman Tino Serrano
said. Labor Department attorneys will decide
soon whether to pursue an investigation that
could last a few months, up to a couple of
years.'"
