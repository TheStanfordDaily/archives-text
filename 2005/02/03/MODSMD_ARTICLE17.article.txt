# An ounce of prevention
## To the Typhoid Marys of Stanford University 
### 
When it comes to health, the Stanford campus
is filled with contradictions. To the casual ob
server, it would appear to be a highly health
conscious environment, where people are wary of
diets and motivated to exercise.
Even with a little rain, hail or gale-force winds,
there will never be a time when you won't see people
jogging around Campus Drive or up to the Dish.
At the dining halls, plates are piled up with salads
and tofu. In dorm rooms, shelves are stocked with pro
tein powders and other nutritional supplements. And
yet, when it comes to something much simpler and
more vital to promoting campus health, the lack of en-

thusiasm and participation is
rather worrisome.
I'm not talking about binge
drinking or sexually transmitted
diseases, but something we all
learned about at a much earlier
age — or at least should have
learned about. I am talking
about washing our hands.
Somehow, even at Stanford,
where people are both educated
and generally health-conscious,
some find it difficult to partici
pate in this simple post-excreto
ry ritual.

When dozens of undercover
investigative reports document the lack of hygienic
protocol at dining establishments, we all watch with re
vulsion. "How horrendous, people must be very lazy to
not practice such basic cleanliness," we think.
And yet, on numerous occasions, in the many love
ly bathrooms of Stanford's dorms, libraries, dorms and
classroom buildings, I have personally seen this egre
gious crime being committed.
Everyone knows that washing our hands ranks high
on the list of basic practices required to be a decent
person. Our parents taught us to wash our hands just as
their parents taught them. But somehow, many gener
ations after hand washing has been found to prevent
the spread of infections, the practice still hasn't caught
on.
As early as the 1840s, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes
advocated washing one's hands to prevent childbed
fever, a cause of maternal death during childbirth. And
by the 1860s, Dr. Joseph Lister introduced the practice
of hand washing into hospitals, requiring surgeons to
wash their hands with a carbolic acid solution between
seeing patients. This novel idea cut the post-operative
sepsis death rate to nearly zero.
Since then, abundant research has shown that hand
washing can reduce not just infections acquired in hos
pitals, but other illnesses as well. This is true in places
ranging from day-care centers to restaurants to the
homes of regular people.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention pro
claims, "Frequent hand-washing is one of the best
ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases."
And yet the CDC still estimates that one out of three
people does not wash his or her hands after using the
restroom.
The importance of hand washing can't be overstat
ed, especially at a place like Stanford. Because of the
close proximity in which people live, college campuses
are the ideal environments for the spread of disease. In
fact, it might not be inaccurate to call them troves of
festering pestilence.
Still, we are not entirely helpless.
Instead of panicking when the flu vaccine is in short
supply, perhaps it would be wise to remember that a
little extra hand washing just might do the trick to re
duce viral transmission during influenza season. (Hey,
if George Bush isn't getting a flu shot this year, why the
hell should you?)
Indeed, one of the most common ways people catch
colds and the flu is by rubbing their nose or their eyes
after their hands have been contaminated with the
virus. In addition, serious diseases like hepatitis A,
meningitis and infectious diarrhea (which just so hap
pens to be spread by a fecal-oral transmission route),
can easily be prevented if people make a habit of wash
ing their hands.
Even Ebola can be eliminated.
Just kidding. But the general point still stands.
(Note: The chances of Ebola breaking out at Stanford
are pretty much zero, unless, of course, .an infected
human or monkey was to board a plane from one of
the African regions where past outbreaks have oc
curred and then spread the virus here. But my guess is
that it would be pretty hard to get past airport security
while bleeding from the eyes ... especially if you're a
monkey.)
So now that we are all aware of the problem, the
time has come to take action. And so, I call upon all of
you, my faithful readers, to join me in my mission — to
spread not just the word, but the actual suds-and
scrubbing practice of hand washing across the wide ex
panses of the Stanford campus.
"But what can I, a mere peon at the hands of The
Man and 'acceptable social protocol." do?" you might
ask.
Rise up. I say, and cast off your hesitance to offend
your friend, dorm-mate, professor or co-worker by
calling them on their erroneous ways. $ay loudly and
in a firm tone of voice, "Excuse me (insert appropriate
name or title here], but it would appear that you have
forgotten to wash your urine-drenched hands after
using the lavatory. Please do so now."
This should embarrass at least a few people enough
to do a quick scrub down. And to all the little Typhoid
Marys out there who think you're just so cute —
please do wash your hands, both for your own sake and
for the well-being of those around you. And speaking
of which, this keyboard I'm typing on in Meyer is real
ly sticky. Yeesh. I think I'll go wash my hands.

panses of the Stanford campus.
"But what can I, a mere peon at the hands of The
Man and 'acceptable social protocol." do?" you might
ask.
Rise up. I say, and cast off your hesitance to offend
your friend, dorm-mate, professor or co-worker by
calling them on their erroneous ways. $ay loudly and
in a firm tone of voice, "Excuse me (insert appropriate
name or title here], but it would appear that you have
forgotten to wash your urine-drenched hands after
using the lavatory. Please do so now."
This should embarrass at least a few people enough
to do a quick scrub down. And to all the little Typhoid
Marys out there who think you're just so cute —
please do wash your hands, both for your own sake and
for the well-being of those around you. And speaking
of which, this keyboard I'm typing on in Meyer is real
ly sticky. Yeesh. I think I'll go wash my hands.

When it comes to health, the Stanford campus
is filled with contradictions. To the casual ob
server, it would appear to be a highly health
conscious environment, where people are wary of
diets and motivated to exercise.
Even with a little rain, hail or gale-force winds,
there will never be a time when you won't see people
jogging around Campus Drive or up to the Dish.
At the dining halls, plates are piled up with salads
and tofu. In dorm rooms, shelves are stocked with pro
tein powders and other nutritional supplements. And
yet, when it comes to something much simpler and
more vital to promoting campus health, the lack of en-

thusiasm and participation is
rather worrisome.
I'm not talking about binge
drinking or sexually transmitted
diseases, but something we all
learned about at a much earlier
age — or at least should have
learned about. I am talking
about washing our hands.
Somehow, even at Stanford,
where people are both educated
and generally health-conscious,
some find it difficult to partici
pate in this simple post-excreto
ry ritual.

When dozens of undercover
investigative reports document the lack of hygienic
protocol at dining establishments, we all watch with re
vulsion. "How horrendous, people must be very lazy to
not practice such basic cleanliness," we think.
And yet, on numerous occasions, in the many love
ly bathrooms of Stanford's dorms, libraries, dorms and
classroom buildings, I have personally seen this egre
gious crime being committed.
Everyone knows that washing our hands ranks high
on the list of basic practices required to be a decent
person. Our parents taught us to wash our hands just as
their parents taught them. But somehow, many gener
ations after hand washing has been found to prevent
the spread of infections, the practice still hasn't caught
on.
As early as the 1840s, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes
advocated washing one's hands to prevent childbed
fever, a cause of maternal death during childbirth. And
by the 1860s, Dr. Joseph Lister introduced the practice
of hand washing into hospitals, requiring surgeons to
wash their hands with a carbolic acid solution between
seeing patients. This novel idea cut the post-operative
sepsis death rate to nearly zero.
Since then, abundant research has shown that hand
washing can reduce not just infections acquired in hos
pitals, but other illnesses as well. This is true in places
ranging from day-care centers to restaurants to the
homes of regular people.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention pro
claims, "Frequent hand-washing is one of the best
ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases."
And yet the CDC still estimates that one out of three
people does not wash his or her hands after using the
restroom.
The importance of hand washing can't be overstat
ed, especially at a place like Stanford. Because of the
close proximity in which people live, college campuses
are the ideal environments for the spread of disease. In
fact, it might not be inaccurate to call them troves of
festering pestilence.
Still, we are not entirely helpless.
Instead of panicking when the flu vaccine is in short
supply, perhaps it would be wise to remember that a
little extra hand washing just might do the trick to re
duce viral transmission during influenza season. (Hey,
if George Bush isn't getting a flu shot this year, why the
hell should you?)
Indeed, one of the most common ways people catch
colds and the flu is by rubbing their nose or their eyes
after their hands have been contaminated with the
virus. In addition, serious diseases like hepatitis A,
meningitis and infectious diarrhea (which just so hap
pens to be spread by a fecal-oral transmission route),
can easily be prevented if people make a habit of wash
ing their hands.
Even Ebola can be eliminated.
Just kidding. But the general point still stands.
(Note: The chances of Ebola breaking out at Stanford
are pretty much zero, unless, of course, .an infected
human or monkey was to board a plane from one of
the African regions where past outbreaks have oc
curred and then spread the virus here. But my guess is
that it would be pretty hard to get past airport security
while bleeding from the eyes ... especially if you're a
monkey.)
So now that we are all aware of the problem, the
time has come to take action. And so, I call upon all of
you, my faithful readers, to join me in my mission — to
spread not just the word, but the actual suds-and
scrubbing practice of hand washing across the wide ex
panses of the Stanford campus.
