# The
						debate on stem cell research:
## Can altered nuclear transfer be a middle ground? 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Is stem cell research bringing us clos
er to human cloning?
To some, stem cell research is essen
tially the same as cloning, while others
see the relationship as merely semantic.
The gulf between these outlooks is
broad indeed. Yet one Stanford pro
fessor may have come up with a way to
reconcile them.
In between these divergent positions
stands Human Biology Prof. William
Hurlbut, who sits on the President's
Council on Bioethics. Hurlbut believes
that "both sides of this difficult debate
are defending important human goods"
— proponents of stem cell research
claim to defend medicinal progress
while opponents advocate the integrity
of human life.
In hopes of reconciling these two
viewpoints, Hurlbut has proposed a
technique he calls "altered nuclear
transfer," which he described as "a way
to get embryonic stem cells without cre
ating a human organism."
Instead of putting the full genetic
code inside the egg cell. Hurlbut's tech
nique will delete several genes from the
code before implanting it in the egg.
The resultant cell will be fully capable
of producing the desired stem cells, but
will lack the capacity to develop as a
human being.
An issue of language?
The controversy surrounding stem
cell research largely derives from the
confusion between two differing re
search techniques: "therapeutic
cloning" and "reproductive cloning."
Whereas therapeutic cloning is used
to produce stem cells, reproductive
cloning was used to clone Dolly the
sheep and could theoretically be used
to clone a human being.
But the first steps in both of these
techniques are the same. These are the
steps in which the incomplete set of ge
netic material inside a female's egg cell
is replaced with the full genetic code
from a body cell such as a skin, liver or
brain cell.
This similarity causes some people to
confuse the two procedures, even though

the latter steps are quite different.
In therapeutic cloning, once the egg
cell is given the full genetic code, it is
stimulated to grow into a specific kind
of tissue — such as brain tissue to po
tentially relieve Alzheimer's or pancre
atic tissue to treat early-onset diabetes.
In reproductive cloning, the egg cell is
usually implanted into a womb, and
thereby stimulated to grow into a whole
new organism, such as a sheep named
Dolly.
Laws drafted to restrict reproductive
cloning have often blocked funds to
therapeutic and reproductive cloning.
The Human Cloning Research Pro
hibition Act, which is now in Congress,
seeks to prohibit all "nuclear transfer
technology" — the technology that is
essential to both therapeutic and repro
ductive cloning.
"We've got a really serious crisis of
language here," said Idelle Datlof, ex
ecutive director of Stem Cell Action
Network, a non-profit that lobbies in
favor of stem cell research.
"When you talk about therapeutic
cloning, the word 'cloning' is there and
you can't get rid of it," Datlof said.
Datlof said that deliberate misinfor
mation, sown largely by the religious
right, has caused mass confusion in
Congress on the issue of stem cells.
"My guess is that it if you gave all the
Congressmen the test on what is nuclear
transfer, 90 percent would fail," she said.
Datlof said that the stigma sur
rounding stem cell research results
from a problem of semantics.
"You hear the word 'fetus' used in
terchangeably with the word 'em
bryo,'" she said, stating the opinion that
an embryo, unlike a fetus, will not nec
essarily develop into a human life.
However, for Noelle Patno, presi
dent of Stanford Students for Life, an
activist group that challenges stem cell
research, there is more to the stigma
than confusion about language.
Patno said she believes that the fetus,
the embryo and even the single fertil
ized egg all deserve the same respect as
a human being.
Because an egg cell modified through
therapeutic cloning has the capacity to
grow into a healthy human being, the
resulting cell "is essentially the same as
a fertilized egg," Patno said.

It is this capacity that instills the egg
cell with human dignity - the stage of
development makes no difference, she
added.
Nor does it matter that the modified
egg cell is not inserted into a womb.
"The location of the embryo does
not matter," Patno said. "Killing
human embryos is wrong."
A proposed compromise
Hurlbut said he believes egg cells
that undergo altered nuclear transfer
are not the same as a human embryo.
He pointed out that, during the stage of
development when stem cells are pro
duced. an embryo only uses about a
quarter of its genetic material. In theo
ry, one could transfer only that quarter
of the genome into an egg. The egg
would still be capable of yielding stem
cells, but it would be missing three
quarters of the genes it takes to make a
human. Because of this absence, Hurl
but said he believes that the altered cell
is not equivalent to a human embryo.
"Even an egg cell with no nucleus
can divide to the eight-cell stage. It ap
pears to be a living being, but would we

really call that egg cell a human organ
ism? Of course not," Hurlbut said.
Hurlbut's altered nuclear transfer
technique is receiving support from
prominent figures in politics, science
and even in the Catholic Church, which
has historically opposed research on
embryonic stem cells.
Archbishop William J. Levada re
cently wrote a letter to President
George W. Bush in which he wrote, "As
Chairman of the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops Committee on Doc
trine, I want to assure you of our inter
est in and encouragement of Dr. Hurl
but's proposal."
Hurlbut outlined the technology be
fore the President's Council on
Bioethics last month but it has yet to be
put into practice.
However, the good news for Hurl
but is that MIT Biology Prof. Rudolf
Jaenisch reviewed the proposal and
concluded in an open letter that,
"Based on current scientific evidence
and reasonable expectations, the pro
posed approach is both technically fea
sible and consistent with the scientific
and medical goals of embryonic stem
cell research."
