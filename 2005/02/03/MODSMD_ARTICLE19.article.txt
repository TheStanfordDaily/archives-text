## Dietary guidelines offer new health schedule 
### TINA HAN 
In elementary school, just about every American
child learns about the food pyramid. Today, dietary
guidelines are not just based on the five basic food
groups. They have developed into an entire manual of
regulations that lay out a plan for the health and nutri
tion of the American population.'
But is it reasonable to expect the average American
to follow these guidelines?
In the most recent edition of dietary and nutritional
guidelines, released by the U.S. Department of Agricul
ture and Health and Human Services on Jan. 12. creators
of the report targeted educators rather than the unin
formed public.
"The Dietary Guidelines is intended primarily for use
by policymakers, healthcare providers, nutritionists and

nutrition educators," said the report.
But at the same time, the latest edition of dietary
guidelines is more user-friendly and accessible to the av
erage reader.
A striking difference from the older guidelines is the
more accessible language used to describe what changes
can be made to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The guide
lines no longer use the vague term "servings" to give por
tion size recommendations but instead use the more spe
cific term "cups" instead.
The new guidelines place more emphasis on the im
portance of certain food groups.
"These guidelines are really stressing high fiber. In
stead of using the term 'low-carb,' the terms 'smart-carb'
and 'sensible-carb' are now being used by food compa
nies and the guidelines are hoping to steer Americans to
ward high fiber," said Vivian Crisman, staff nutritionist
at the Vaden Student Health Center.
"The guidelines also recommend three servings of
dairy. A large study was done on hypertension and they
found that a diet higher in calcium is likely to lower blood
pressure," she added.
The report provides a complete nutritional plan for
health-conscious adults, offering exact quantities and
percentages for specific food groups and nutrients.
In a 2,000-calorie diet, the USDA Food Guide allows
for two cups of fruit, two-and-a-half cups of vegetables,
six ounces of grains and five-and-a-half ounces of meat
per day. The guide also restricts "discretionary calories,"
or less nutritionally valuable foods, to 267 calories per
day.
Although many students may have an intuitive knowl
edge of proper nutritional habits, most simply do not
have the time to think about specific numbers when eat
ing. With their busy academic and extracurricular sched
ules, students may not have time to eat three full meals,
let alone eat healthily.
"I used to take more care in what I eat but when I'm
on campus, I'm lucky if I even get in time fora meal so I
just end up eating whatever is in front of me," said junior
Jennifer Clark.
But Crisman has a simple rule of thumb by which stu
dents can easily incorporate these dietary guidelines into
their busy schedules.
"When you're going with your tray to the dining hall.

just look down and ask yourself. 'Is your tray colorful?
Or is it beige and brown?' Do you see calcium rich
foods? Make sure that you see a good variety of colors
on your plate," she said.
Some students already follow Crisman's advice on cre
ating a diverse and comprehensive diet.
"I try to balance my meals out. I try to incorporate
some grains like whole wheat bread with my meat," said
junior Karina Ortega.
"I generally like to see something green on Ihy plate.
I also make sure I get fresh fruit into my meals. I don't
have much trouble finding what I want to eat in the din
ing hall since all the food is readily available," she added.
Students who do not live in dorms with dining halls but
live in apartment-style housing, such as Mirrielees, usu
ally shop and cook for themselves. In these situations,
some students make a greater effort to follow dietary
guidelines, even if they do so unconsciously.
"Even though I don't have a specific plan or grocery
list, I always buy vegetables and fruits to ensure that I
have the option of eating healthily," said junior Rachel
Dacwag.
"Living in Mirrielees, as opposed to living in a dorm
with a dining plan, gives you the freedom to eat whatev
er you want. When I have time, I do make sure I get
enough of the necessary nutrients fora balanced diet,"
she added.
In addition to dietary suggestions, the report encour
ages adults and children to incorporate physical activity
into their schedules as a way to manage body weight.
"To prevent the gradual accumulation of excess
weight in adulthood ... approximately 60 minutes of
moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity on most days of
the week," the report said.
Recognizing that not everybody can fit a 60-minute
workout block into their schedules, the guidelines sug
gest working out for three to six 10-minute sessions
throughout the day.
Although many Stanford students are aware of the di
etary guidelines, they say they do not let them hamper
their lifestyles.
"There's a tradeoff. You can either spend your time
worrying only about diet and exercising or you can spend
time enjoying life. The key is balance," said senior Vic
tor Lin.

for two cups of fruit, two-and-a-half cups of vegetables,
six ounces of grains and five-and-a-half ounces of meat
per day. The guide also restricts "discretionary calories,"
or less nutritionally valuable foods, to 267 calories per
day.
Although many students may have an intuitive knowl
edge of proper nutritional habits, most simply do not
have the time to think about specific numbers when eat
ing. With their busy academic and extracurricular sched
ules, students may not have time to eat three full meals,
let alone eat healthily.
"I used to take more care in what I eat but when I'm
on campus, I'm lucky if I even get in time fora meal so I
just end up eating whatever is in front of me," said junior
Jennifer Clark.
But Crisman has a simple rule of thumb by which stu
dents can easily incorporate these dietary guidelines into
their busy schedules.
"When you're going with your tray to the dining hall.

just look down and ask yourself. 'Is your tray colorful?
Or is it beige and brown?' Do you see calcium rich
foods? Make sure that you see a good variety of colors
on your plate," she said.
Some students already follow Crisman's advice on cre
ating a diverse and comprehensive diet.
"I try to balance my meals out. I try to incorporate
some grains like whole wheat bread with my meat," said
junior Karina Ortega.
"I generally like to see something green on Ihy plate.
I also make sure I get fresh fruit into my meals. I don't
have much trouble finding what I want to eat in the din
ing hall since all the food is readily available," she added.
Students who do not live in dorms with dining halls but
live in apartment-style housing, such as Mirrielees, usu
ally shop and cook for themselves. In these situations,
some students make a greater effort to follow dietary
guidelines, even if they do so unconsciously.
"Even though I don't have a specific plan or grocery
list, I always buy vegetables and fruits to ensure that I
have the option of eating healthily," said junior Rachel
Dacwag.
"Living in Mirrielees, as opposed to living in a dorm
with a dining plan, gives you the freedom to eat whatev
er you want. When I have time, I do make sure I get
enough of the necessary nutrients fora balanced diet,"
she added.
In addition to dietary suggestions, the report encour
ages adults and children to incorporate physical activity
into their schedules as a way to manage body weight.
"To prevent the gradual accumulation of excess
weight in adulthood ... approximately 60 minutes of
moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity on most days of
the week," the report said.
Recognizing that not everybody can fit a 60-minute
workout block into their schedules, the guidelines sug
gest working out for three to six 10-minute sessions
throughout the day.
Although many Stanford students are aware of the di
etary guidelines, they say they do not let them hamper
their lifestyles.
"There's a tradeoff. You can either spend your time
worrying only about diet and exercising or you can spend
time enjoying life. The key is balance," said senior Vic
tor Lin.

In elementary school, just about every American
child learns about the food pyramid. Today, dietary
guidelines are not just based on the five basic food
groups. They have developed into an entire manual of
regulations that lay out a plan for the health and nutri
tion of the American population.'
But is it reasonable to expect the average American
to follow these guidelines?
In the most recent edition of dietary and nutritional
guidelines, released by the U.S. Department of Agricul
ture and Health and Human Services on Jan. 12. creators
of the report targeted educators rather than the unin
formed public.
"The Dietary Guidelines is intended primarily for use
by policymakers, healthcare providers, nutritionists and

nutrition educators," said the report.
But at the same time, the latest edition of dietary
guidelines is more user-friendly and accessible to the av
erage reader.
A striking difference from the older guidelines is the
more accessible language used to describe what changes
can be made to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The guide
lines no longer use the vague term "servings" to give por
tion size recommendations but instead use the more spe
cific term "cups" instead.
The new guidelines place more emphasis on the im
portance of certain food groups.
"These guidelines are really stressing high fiber. In
stead of using the term 'low-carb,' the terms 'smart-carb'
and 'sensible-carb' are now being used by food compa
nies and the guidelines are hoping to steer Americans to
ward high fiber," said Vivian Crisman, staff nutritionist
at the Vaden Student Health Center.
"The guidelines also recommend three servings of
dairy. A large study was done on hypertension and they
found that a diet higher in calcium is likely to lower blood
pressure," she added.
The report provides a complete nutritional plan for
health-conscious adults, offering exact quantities and
percentages for specific food groups and nutrients.
