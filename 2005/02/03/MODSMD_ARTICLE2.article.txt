# Thiel a perfect fit for No. 2 Card
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Every top basketball team has one. She's the
superstar who grabs every headline and sits for
every post-game interview. She's the answer to

her school's trivia ques
tions and the standard of
excellence for years after
she plays her final game.
When things are
falling apart for her team,
all eyes begin falling on
her. She's a brand name.
For No. 1 LSU, that
player is Seimone Augus
tus. For No. 2 Ohio State,
it's Jessica Davenport and
No. 3 Duke is led by
Monique Curry.
For No. 4 Stanford,
that player is . . . how
much time do you have?
For the last four years,
the answer to that question
was painfully obvious.
Nicole Powell, arguably
the greatest player to wear
a Stanford uniform, was
undoubtedly the center of
gravity for each team on
which she played.
Yet. with Powell's de
parture for the WNBA,
head coach Tara Van-

Derveer's team has undergone a transformation,
incorporating the triangle offense and generally
getting used to playing without its three-time Ail-
American.
"We have a lot of superstars on our team/'
VanDerveer said. "People who are willing to play
a back-up role, but would be starters on any other
[Pacific-10 Conference] team."

How is the Cardinal faring without that single
go-to player? Well, Stanford (19-2,10-1 Pac-10) is
riding a 10-game winning streak and has been
called a Final Four team by more than one oppos
ing coach.
Without a superstar, however, the Cardinal
depends on each player to contribute on a
nightly basis.
In many ways, then, senior forward T'Nae
Thiel is the perfect fit for this year's Stanford team.
"Without [Powell], a lot of us have had to step
up and take on bigger roles on the team," Thiel
said. "It makes you focus on consistency."
During her days as a dominating high school
forward in Weatherford. Tex., Thiel saw Palo
Alto as the perfect collegiate destination.
"There are a lot of great schools in Texas, but
none like Stanford," Thiel said. "The academics
are so strong, and one of the top women's basket
ball programs in the country, the combination of
the two was very appealing to me."
Despite Thiel's soft-spoken manner off the
court, VanDerveer immediately recognized her
as an ideal fit for the Cardinal program.
"Our conversations were very short," Van-
Derveer said. "I asked her a question, and her an
swer was 'Yes, ma'am,' or 'No, ma'am.' She didn't
ask a lot of questions and was very clear about
what she wanted."
Once she arrived on campus, it was only
natural for the unassuming Thiel to slip seam
lessly into the overall pattern of Stanford's
success. Quietly going about her business, she
has been a master of detail and technique for
four years, making those around her better
while consistently avoiding their spotlight.
"She does a lot of the things that aren't reflect
ed in the stat sheet," VanDerveer said. "She's a
great passer, she's a great defender, she rebounds,
she boxes out."
Perhaps the clearest insight into T'Nae Thiel as
person and player lies in her casual scorn for her
own place in Stanford history. Told that she is No.

10 on the program's all-time rebounding list, her
response is equal parts surprise and self-critique.
"I had no idea," Thiel said. "I feel like I could
rebound more than I am, so it's something I need
to work on. But I haven't really thought about it."
Fora squad without a single player averaging as
many as 30 minutes per game, Thiel has teamed up
with sophomores Brooke Smith and Kristen Newl
in at the center of Stanford's triangle offense. Led
by Thiel's team-high 5.4 rebounds per contest, the
trio has combined to give the Cardinal an edge of
7.4 rebounds per game, 19th in the country.
On a team ranked 17th in the country in oppo
nents' field goal percentage, Thiel is a dominating
presence at the defensive end of the court.
"She prides herself on defense and might be
one of the best defenders I've ever coached at any
level," VanDerveer said. "She can just stop peo
ple, and you just know that if she guards someone,
they're not going to score."
Most important, fora team that will face im
mense pressure in trying to reach its first Final
Four since 1997, Thiel brings an understanding of
the game beyond her years.
"She knows every play at every position," Van-
Derveer said. "There are only three players that re
ally know this, and [assistant coach Charmin Smith]
is one of them. Honestly, I don't know them."
Yet, for all her prowess between the lines,
Thiel wins her greatest fans off the court. The only
player who can actually appear embarrassed after
making a great play, she greets publicity with a
"Who, me?" attitude that is as rare as it is refresh
ing.
"She's caring, she's funny," senior Kelley Sum
inski said. "Freshman year I felt very lucky, and
today I still feel lucky, to have met some of my
best friends, especially T'Nae."
Unfortunately, when Thiel's career concludes
in April, there will be few numbers to demon
strate her importance to one of the nation's finest
collegiate basketball programs. But then again,
that might be just fine with her.

Once she arrived on campus, it was only
natural for the unassuming Thiel to slip seam
lessly into the overall pattern of Stanford's
success. Quietly going about her business, she
has been a master of detail and technique for
four years, making those around her better
while consistently avoiding their spotlight.
"She does a lot of the things that aren't reflect
ed in the stat sheet," VanDerveer said. "She's a
great passer, she's a great defender, she rebounds,
she boxes out."
Perhaps the clearest insight into T'Nae Thiel as
person and player lies in her casual scorn for her
own place in Stanford history. Told that she is No.

10 on the program's all-time rebounding list, her
response is equal parts surprise and self-critique.
"I had no idea," Thiel said. "I feel like I could
rebound more than I am, so it's something I need
to work on. But I haven't really thought about it."
Fora squad without a single player averaging as
many as 30 minutes per game, Thiel has teamed up
with sophomores Brooke Smith and Kristen Newl
in at the center of Stanford's triangle offense. Led
by Thiel's team-high 5.4 rebounds per contest, the
trio has combined to give the Cardinal an edge of
7.4 rebounds per game, 19th in the country.
On a team ranked 17th in the country in oppo
nents' field goal percentage, Thiel is a dominating
presence at the defensive end of the court.
"She prides herself on defense and might be
one of the best defenders I've ever coached at any
level," VanDerveer said. "She can just stop peo
ple, and you just know that if she guards someone,
they're not going to score."
Most important, fora team that will face im
mense pressure in trying to reach its first Final
Four since 1997, Thiel brings an understanding of
the game beyond her years.
"She knows every play at every position," Van-
Derveer said. "There are only three players that re
ally know this, and [assistant coach Charmin Smith]
is one of them. Honestly, I don't know them."
Yet, for all her prowess between the lines,
Thiel wins her greatest fans off the court. The only
player who can actually appear embarrassed after
making a great play, she greets publicity with a
"Who, me?" attitude that is as rare as it is refresh
ing.
"She's caring, she's funny," senior Kelley Sum
inski said. "Freshman year I felt very lucky, and
today I still feel lucky, to have met some of my
best friends, especially T'Nae."
Unfortunately, when Thiel's career concludes
in April, there will be few numbers to demon
strate her importance to one of the nation's finest
collegiate basketball programs. But then again,
that might be just fine with her.


MATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily File
Senior forward T'Nae Thiel has averaged a team-high 5.4 rebounds per
game for Stanford, which takes on Arizona at home tonight.

Every top basketball team has one. She's the
superstar who grabs every headline and sits for
every post-game interview. She's the answer to

her school's trivia ques
tions and the standard of
excellence for years after
she plays her final game.
When things are
falling apart for her team,
all eyes begin falling on
her. She's a brand name.
For No. 1 LSU, that
player is Seimone Augus
tus. For No. 2 Ohio State,
it's Jessica Davenport and
No. 3 Duke is led by
Monique Curry.
For No. 4 Stanford,
that player is . . . how
much time do you have?
For the last four years,
the answer to that question
was painfully obvious.
Nicole Powell, arguably
the greatest player to wear
a Stanford uniform, was
undoubtedly the center of
gravity for each team on
which she played.
Yet. with Powell's de
parture for the WNBA,
head coach Tara Van-

Derveer's team has undergone a transformation,
incorporating the triangle offense and generally
getting used to playing without its three-time Ail-
American.
"We have a lot of superstars on our team/'
VanDerveer said. "People who are willing to play
a back-up role, but would be starters on any other
[Pacific-10 Conference] team."

How is the Cardinal faring without that single
go-to player? Well, Stanford (19-2,10-1 Pac-10) is
riding a 10-game winning streak and has been
called a Final Four team by more than one oppos
ing coach.
Without a superstar, however, the Cardinal
depends on each player to contribute on a
nightly basis.
In many ways, then, senior forward T'Nae
Thiel is the perfect fit for this year's Stanford team.
"Without [Powell], a lot of us have had to step
up and take on bigger roles on the team," Thiel
said. "It makes you focus on consistency."
During her days as a dominating high school
forward in Weatherford. Tex., Thiel saw Palo
Alto as the perfect collegiate destination.
"There are a lot of great schools in Texas, but
none like Stanford," Thiel said. "The academics
are so strong, and one of the top women's basket
ball programs in the country, the combination of
the two was very appealing to me."
Despite Thiel's soft-spoken manner off the
court, VanDerveer immediately recognized her
as an ideal fit for the Cardinal program.
"Our conversations were very short," Van-
Derveer said. "I asked her a question, and her an
swer was 'Yes, ma'am,' or 'No, ma'am.' She didn't
ask a lot of questions and was very clear about
what she wanted."
