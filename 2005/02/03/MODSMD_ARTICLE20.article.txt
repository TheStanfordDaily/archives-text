## Editorial Roble's conversion will enrich Stanford 
### 
This September, Stanford community members
will no longer find students fencing, playing basket
ball or participating in exercise programs inside Roble
Gym. That's because Roble Gym will no longer be a
gym. The Drama Department will assume control
over the facility, changing it into a space primarily for
classes, as well as allowing more rehearsal space for
non-academic dance groups.
The conversion, which has been under discussion
for over three years, is a necessary step toward recti
fying the scarcity of rehearsal space available for per
formance groups. In addition, the move will hopeful
ly increase the importance of the department in the
eyes of the University.
The Vice Provost of Student Affair's student space
committee found that rehearsal space is one of the
greatest shortages. Dance groups have difficulty prac
ticing — to the point at which Cardinal Ballet has at
times rented space off-campus, for example — and
finding a space to performan is almost as difficult. This
is a particular problem in winter and spring quarters,
when the department's seniors put on their shows, and
student groups want to show off the talents they have
developed over the year. The Drama Department has
recognized the need for space and has said that ac
commodating the needs of student groups will be one
of the its top priorities.
The Drama Department's takeover will also allow
the expansion of course offerings and the program as a
whole. The department, which includes the dance pro
gram, does not have enough space for its current cur
ricula. The Roble change will be move toward resolv
ing this situation.
More importantly, this move will hopefully signify
a change in the University's view of the department.

For too long. Drama has not been a priority for the
University. With the exception of the multimillion dol
lar Hewlett gift to the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, the University has not had any major funding
pushes to expand or improve the Drama Department.
In preparation for the conversion, the Drama De
partment has done an excellent job reaching out to stu
dents and student groups. We applaud the department
for these efforts, particularly in organizing an advising
committee. These steps toward student inclusion will
not only serve to qualm fears regarding the change, but
guarantee a successful outcome as well.
Still, there are concerns. Several staff members arc
worried about the future of Roble's Health Improve
ment Program, or HIP, which allows staff members to
exercise during lunch. Many of the participants believe
the new Arrillage Family Recreation Center, located on
the corner of Galvez and Campus Drive, will be too far
for those who work on West campus. The University
thus far has said that they hope commuting will not be
an issue. Such a stance is not sufficient. The University,
HIP participants and the Drama Department should
work out a compromise to allow the program to contin
ue, even if on a limited basis.
The conversion will displace other groups — such
as the Stanford Martial Arts Program — and the Uni
versity must ensure that there is suitable space avail
able for them elsewhere.
Despite our misgivings, Roble's conversion is a
beneficial move for the Drama Department and the
University as a whole. As Stanford broadens and im
proves as a university, having a strong performance
department and appropriate facilities will become
even more important. The conversion is a strong step
in the right direction.
