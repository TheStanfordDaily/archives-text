# The
						Good Life
## Turn the television on 
### JULIE PARK 
There are so many important and interesting
things to do at Stanford that we almost don't
have time to do the things that don't matter at all.
Like watch TV.
I miss TV. I never get to watch it when I 'm at school.
When I'm bored, lazy and at home, there's nothing else
that fills the hole in my thumping heart like the ail-
American, all-consuming Technicolor pop-cultural
hodge-podge from hell. Its natural to be so enamored,
really. Besides making vast chunks of time disappear,
TV teaches you about the true Hollywood story of
scary but oddly fascinating people like Martha Stewart.
It teaches you about plastic surgeons who, as children,
decided to get rich — because sometimes, when chil
dren are raised to follow Gandhi and are taught to live
a simple life, they become determined to live in man
sions, hire chefs and throw lavish dinner parties in Bev
erly Hills. TV even tricks children — and probably too
many adults — into believing that life is like a movie,
before they discover otherwise and understand the
word "disillusionment." What's not to like?
Well, there is the cloak of lethargy that descends
upon me after a couple of shows. There is that dull
headache I get after a few more hours. There is the loss
of time that eventually leads to loss of life.
While I wish I could watch Nip/Tuck and other
quality shows in the dorms, in truth I'm glad that I only
have (united access to TV and therefore live a more
productive life than 1 probably would otherwise. Yes,
TV contaminates your mind. But don't worry about
the obvious dangers like watching people get killed
and hearing lawyers talk. It's the underlying messages
that screw up your outlook on life without you even
knowing it.
I grew up watching "Saved By the Bell," and where
did that get me in life? Perhaps my slight fear of prep
py white people with blond hair comes from watching
blonds like Zach Morris rule the school.
But a "Blond is Better" myth isn't universal, not
even in Europe. Blond men have no place in Italian
television. Blond women, yes; they are dearly coveted
and appear next to brunette men only. Odd — but
then, was Ken blond? I don't know. I only had one Ken
doll when 1 was little, and he had shiny brown paint on
his head. He wore an unfortunate sparkly blue leop
ard-print shirt, but when you only have one Ken, you
probably only have one Ken outfit. One day my best

friend sat on him, and his leg fell off. He wasn't the only
one who was crushed.
It kind of disturbs me that I didn't throw away one
legged Ken. It kind of disturbs me that 1 played with
Barbie and Ken. Oh well, at least I didn't collect scary
plastic "Treasure Trolls" with fuzzy neon hair and jew
els for belly buttons like countless American children,
who probably fell for Beanie Babies and Harry Potter,
too. Hellish fads. Harry Potter is a mystery to me, and
I'm not talking about the stories themselves. I doubt
it's my short attention span alone that makes me un
able to read those books. I actually did the reading for
I-HUM, unlike all those freshmen who kicked my butt
in I-HUM despite their creaseless book spines.
It kind of sucks that I couldn't compete with the
CS and EE kids in I-HUM. At least I'm smart
enough to avoid the run-of-the-mill variety of cheesy
cleavage-baring, weapon-wielding melodramas on
the air like "Alias." That's not to say that I oppose
cheesy cleavage-baring, weapon-wielding melodra
mas. If you stretch your imagination, almost any grit
ty and entertaining show on television, such as the
strangely good Nip/ Tuck, qualifies as such. Watch
Nip / Tuck to see messed up adults reveal their mod
ern messed-up-edness with riveting acting and well
written lines. Did I mention it shows you how life can
turn out extremely badly and thus steels your resolve
to avoid having weekly life crises involving crack,
adultery and plastic surgery?
Sometimes I wonder what my life would have been
like had I not grown up letting years of my life disap
pear, glued to the four TVs at home. Half a century ago
in Korea, when my parents were toy-less children, kids
were so bored that they tasted ant butts because they
heard they're sour. They are. And once, my dad fol
lowed other kids to a slaughterhouse and saw a cow
valiantly struggling to stand up while being hacked to
death. Life without TV surely would have been vastly
different. Perhaps it would have been more real.
Would life be more real now if we turned off TV?
Or would we just substitute the electronic brain drain
with other meaningless activities like buying stuff and
listening to iPod Minis? I don't know. I only know one
thing. I have never been bored enough to taste an ant
butt. And that's a damn good thing.
