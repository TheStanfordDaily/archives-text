# Brown and Out
## What color are you? 
### 
I! TT never think of myself as a
I color," one of my profes-
JLsors said last week in class.
It made me wonder: Do I ever
think of myself as a color? As just a
color? It's a good point, because 1
don't think of myself as a color, ei
ther. Do you? Do people ever

think of them
selves primarily
as a color?
It seems like
an odd question
to ask, hut —
given the way
our society is or
ganized around
color lines — it's
also a very signif
icant one.

I guess the
closest I ever got to thinking of my
self as a color was in the fourth
grade, when I made the mistake of
calling the color peach the "skin
color." Perhaps it was because it
was closest to the color of my skin,
but in fourth grade, I didn't really
consider the ramifications such a
comment could have on my psyche
as a woman of (light) color.
I eventually got over the whole
"skin color" idea, but 1 know I'm
not the only person to have ever
made that exact mistake. It makes
me wonder if these labels have ef
fects I'm not considering.
In Portuguese, you can distin
guish between a person who is
dark-skinned (negro) and a thing
that is dark (preto). According to
my Portuguese professor, when
you describe a person with the
name of the colored object, you
turn them into a thing. That's pret
ty demeaning.
Although English can't convey
this exact difference in meaning, it
can still be pretty offensive to call
someone a color in the right cir
cumstances. If you read through
any literature written for most of
this country's history, you'll be able
to feel the tremendous disgust of
white Americans at the thought of

darker peoples. Even Abraham
Lincoln — the man "responsible"
for freeing the slaves — was pretty
disgusted by dark skin, I recently
learned.
And while English doesn't work
the same way as Portuguese, the dif
ference brings up a good point: What
does it mean that each "race" has its
own corresponding "skin color"? I
consider myself Mexican-Latino (but
not Hispanic), and I'm not literally
brown — but I would still call myself
that in the right circumstances.
It's definitely useful when talk
ing about race and ethnicity in a so
ciety as diverse as the United States
to have a nomenclature that easily
provides tangible symbols, such as
colors, for different groups.
But how far is too far? Is it ap
propriate to call someone black or
African-American? Do the
metaphors of Twinkies, Oreos, co
conuts and apples illustrate the ab
surdity of the whole system? Do you
end up making unfair categoriza
tions — maybe Irish white and Ger
man white are different colors? Is
Mexican brown a shade apart from
Salvadorian brown?
I guess the point is that it has lit
tle to do with skin color at all, but
rather, it's a way to easily identify a
group by one of their most basic el
ements — color. A lot of Latinos I
know aren't brown. A lot of
African-Americans I've met aren't
black. I have never met a yellow
Asian. I have yet to meet a red Na
tive American.
I'm sure that if these labels were
traced back, they would have less
than-egalitarian origins, and I'm
not sure what that means, but I do
know that I myself wouldn 't want to
be called a color — because that's
not what I am. I'm more than that,
so I guess that means everybody
else is, too.

I! TT never think of myself as a
I color," one of my profes-
JLsors said last week in class.
It made me wonder: Do I ever
think of myself as a color? As just a
color? It's a good point, because 1
don't think of myself as a color, ei
ther. Do you? Do people ever

think of them
selves primarily
as a color?
It seems like
an odd question
to ask, hut —
given the way
our society is or
ganized around
color lines — it's
also a very signif
icant one.

I guess the
closest I ever got to thinking of my
self as a color was in the fourth
grade, when I made the mistake of
calling the color peach the "skin
color." Perhaps it was because it
was closest to the color of my skin,
but in fourth grade, I didn't really
consider the ramifications such a
comment could have on my psyche
as a woman of (light) color.
I eventually got over the whole
"skin color" idea, but 1 know I'm
not the only person to have ever
made that exact mistake. It makes
me wonder if these labels have ef
fects I'm not considering.
In Portuguese, you can distin
guish between a person who is
dark-skinned (negro) and a thing
that is dark (preto). According to
my Portuguese professor, when
you describe a person with the
name of the colored object, you
turn them into a thing. That's pret
ty demeaning.
Although English can't convey
this exact difference in meaning, it
can still be pretty offensive to call
someone a color in the right cir
cumstances. If you read through
any literature written for most of
this country's history, you'll be able
to feel the tremendous disgust of
white Americans at the thought of

darker peoples. Even Abraham
Lincoln — the man "responsible"
for freeing the slaves — was pretty
disgusted by dark skin, I recently
learned.
And while English doesn't work
the same way as Portuguese, the dif
ference brings up a good point: What
does it mean that each "race" has its
own corresponding "skin color"? I
consider myself Mexican-Latino (but
not Hispanic), and I'm not literally
brown — but I would still call myself
that in the right circumstances.
It's definitely useful when talk
ing about race and ethnicity in a so
ciety as diverse as the United States
to have a nomenclature that easily
provides tangible symbols, such as
colors, for different groups.
But how far is too far? Is it ap
propriate to call someone black or
African-American? Do the
metaphors of Twinkies, Oreos, co
conuts and apples illustrate the ab
surdity of the whole system? Do you
end up making unfair categoriza
tions — maybe Irish white and Ger
man white are different colors? Is
Mexican brown a shade apart from
Salvadorian brown?
I guess the point is that it has lit
tle to do with skin color at all, but
rather, it's a way to easily identify a
group by one of their most basic el
ements — color. A lot of Latinos I
know aren't brown. A lot of
African-Americans I've met aren't
black. I have never met a yellow
Asian. I have yet to meet a red Na
tive American.
I'm sure that if these labels were
traced back, they would have less
than-egalitarian origins, and I'm
not sure what that means, but I do
know that I myself wouldn 't want to
be called a color — because that's
not what I am. I'm more than that,
so I guess that means everybody
else is, too.
