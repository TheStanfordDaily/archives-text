Stanford Israel Alliance did not cosponsor
Horowitz event
We are writing in regard to the article entitled
"Horowitzcriticizesacademia as 'leftist' " (Feb. 2) article
that appeared in The Daily. In the article, the reporter er
roneously stated that the Stanford Israel Alliance co
sponsored the event. However, this particular event was
not cosponsored by our organization in light of the fact
that we are working on two exciting upcoming events this
month: a lecture by Thomas Friedman, New York Times
foreign affairs correspondent, on Feb 8, and the Idan
Raichel Project concert on Feb. 15.
We hope that in the future, the Stanford Daily staff

will he more responsible ahout publishing correct infor
mation and take the extra step to ensure their news sto
ries are accurate. We look forward to their coverage of
our upcoming events.

Sudanese Ambassador is apologist for
governments actions
I attended the Stanford-advertised and Muslim Stu
dent Association Network-sponsored visit by the Su
danese Ambassador last night. The talk, ostensibly on

the genocide in Darlur, glaringly became the pleonastic
propaganda of individuals with unclean hands.
I attended the talk, seared by the words that Canadi
an General Romeo Delaire wrote of about his time as the
UN Commander in Rwanda during their horror. Like
others, I thought humanity would unite to prevent such
wanton and senseless cleaving of life again.
From the words of the speakers and ambassadors at
tonight's event. I've since learned that the most important
matter in African and particularly Sudanese affairs is the
independent development and unquestioned actions of
its government, not peace or the care of its people.
The ambassador, quoting Orwell, spoke eloquently
that Sudan is the land of blacks, distinguished by tribal

histories, hut united hy nationality and fear of foreign in
tervention for economic or political advantage. Exactly
how the deaths of these Sudanese produced economic or
political advantage for America was left unanswered.
After the ambassador spoke, I too was left shocked by
his Orwellian doublespeak about the tainted actions of
his government. I am also left with the question of how a
student group could invite such an individual and how
the university could advertise this event. This event
marched less for peace than for the nationalistic scourge
of the previous century.
