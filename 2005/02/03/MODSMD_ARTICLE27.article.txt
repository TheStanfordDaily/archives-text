## The
						Double Clutch On any given (Super Bowl) Sunday... 
### 
Feb. 3, 2002 — I trudged into the Boston
afternoon, which was cold as it always is
at the apex of the merciless Northeast
winter. Destination: my buddy Jesse Smith
nosky's frat house, its 61-inch TV and Super
Bowl XXXVI (that's 36 for the non-Roman
among us.)
It had been a gut-wrenching set of months

since I had returned to
school. From 9/11 and
Afghanistan on the national
front, to the late-season col
lapses of Mariner baseball
and Michigan football, to the
gloriously satisfying melt
down of the Yankees in the
World Series (since eclipsed
by New York's three-up.
four-down tilt against the
Red Sox last season).

Blowhards in (he press said this game was a
lock. There was no way the Pats would be able
to steal one from the mighty Rams and their
track-team offense. A plodding, low-scoring
team against Super Bowl veteran quarterback
Kurt Warner, one of the great comeback sto
ries of our time. It was to be the closest we
could come to a public execution.
But I knew better. 1 believed.
OK, so maybe that's a lie. I knew the 17-
point spread was for good reason. I wasn't
guaranteeing a New England win or anything.
1 will say this — I knew that they were very ca
pable of winning.
After all, this is the NFL. It can happen any
given Sunday, even if that given Sunday is the
Super Bowl.
Departing from tradition, the game was
spectacular in the literal sense of the word.
Turnovers and effective offense led to a 14-
point Pats lead. Warner looked human, and
New England wasn't fazed by his able receiv
ing corps.
We were all going nuts. In another exhibi
tion of my trademark enthusiasm, I developed
a habit of throwing my hat at the TV, over
three rows of people, whenever I got excited.
What happened next was sort of a blur. To
make a long story short, the lead evaporated,
and with John Madden second-guessing. Patri
ots kicker Adam Vinatieri fought off the din to
boot the game-winning points on the final
play. I threw my hat again.
The city didn't seem to know what to do
with itself. Major streets had not been closed
off. People were climbing on top of buses and
honking car horns into the night. I grabbed
some Dunkin' Donuts and watched as stu
dents flipped over a car (alcohol may have
been involved). "Imagine what it will be like if
the Sox win the World Series," I thought to
myself.
Of course, the joke — as the Patriots pre
pare to play for their third trophy in four years
— is that people are STILL complaining that
"the best team didn't win" and carping that the
Pats shouldn't have beaten the Raiders in a
snow-soaked divisional playoff.
In that famous game, an apparent Tom
Brady fumble was ruled an incomplete pass on
review, based upon an obscure and subtle or
dinance known as the "tuck rule." New Eng
land then kicked a game-tying field goal and
won in overtime. Raider Nation flooded the
radio with Al Davis wannabes claiming that
the NFL has been out to get Oakland's band of
corsairs since — well, since before Davis
began to turn into a raisin.
(Maybe it was a stupid rule after all. But we
don't rewrite the book in the middle of the
game because a situation comes up where we
think the rule shouldn't apply.)
Anyway, the roles reversed two years
later, with upstart Carolina (alas, with" no
tuck rule controversy) challenging 14-2 New
England. Perhaps the most interesting trivia
in the leadup was Panthers kick returner Rod
Smart — the man who put "He Hate Me" on
the back of his jersey when he was in the
XFL.
To make a long, stressful story short, the
same damn thing happened again — New
England's lead disappeared, and it had to pull
another late drive to win.
And in an unholy alliance that is a testa
ment to the unifying power of Boston sports. I
sat with my Michigan hat next to a Buckeye
girl from Columbus, Ohio, holding hands in
tension as the Pats lined up for the game-win
ning points.
The city erupted almost instantaneously.
This time Boylston Street was shut down, free
of cars for the masses of people. T-shirts were
burned in Kenmore Square outside of Fenway
Park. The cops, though mindful of streakers
and other such ribaldry, seemed ready to let
everyone have a good time.
The sweetness of victory is best enjoyed
with 150,000 of your best friends.
Note to Philadelphia Mayor John Street:
Forget the spread. Forget the favorite. If the
Iggles win. 45 years of gridiron frustration will
pour into the streets like the eruption of Vesu
vius. You better be ready for it.
