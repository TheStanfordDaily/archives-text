# New-look softball team seeks perfect balance
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
This weekend, Stanford's softball field will be the hub of
a search for balance. The perfect balance in the perfect bat,
the ideal stability and steadiness of the pitcher... the list
goes on. But the No. 5 Cardinal are looking fora different
type of balance — one that isn't necessarily found on the
field, but within the team.
The 2005 Cardinal must cope with the graduation of All-

American battery Dana Sorensen and Jessica Allister.
Sorensen, who boasted a 1.41 ERA, notched 34 wins as the
Cardinal's ace. In addition to her leadership, Allister hit
.345 and drove in 55 runs.
Finding new team leaders is a priority for head coach
John Rittman as the Cardinal look to return to the College
World Series. With six freshmen in the mix, Stanford must
develop a new team chemistry and find the right balance
between youth and experience.
"It's going to be a big key for us," Rittman said. " Any

time you have six freshmen and six seniors, and you have
people used to playing a lot of innings, you have to stay co
hesive as a team."
With the first pitch of the 2005 season less than 48 hours
away, Rittman is not at a loss for players willing to step into
new roles.
"Everyone provides a type of leadership, whether it's
vocal or on the field with actions," Rittman said. "But our
seniors know what it takes at this level... our whole team
has stepped up and taken responsibility."
The veterans should lead Stanford to another successful
season on the heels of last year's third-place finish at the
College World Series, where Stanford lost to eventual
champion UCLA. But if the Cardinal are to come close to
repeating last season's 49-19 record, their non-seniors will
play a big part.
Sophomore Jackie Rinehart and junior Lauren Lappin
were both among the 40 selected for the USA Softball Col
legiate Player of the Year Award Watch List. Rinehart,
who swings from the left, hit an impressive .356 her first
year on the Farm and led Stanford with 80 hits. Those stats
seem hard to improve upon, but according to Rittman, the
leftfielder has not only matured, but she has developed
power and arm strength as well. Her role as a "flapper and
a bunter," then, looks to change.
Lappin, Stanford's highly regarded shortstop, hit .358 last
season.
Rittman expects the left-side combo to provide leader
ship, along with junior centerfielder Catalina Morris, in the
field.
This year's offense should also be a little more balanced
with the addition of the freshmen, many who have earned
starting spots on the squad. With the new additions, Stan
ford has gained depth and variety, including a lefty in a
right-heavy lineup.
"We're going to be a better team offensively, top to bot
tom," Rittman said. "The freshmen will provide and add
power and speed post more numbers.
Rittman admits that last year's squad was a one-pitcher
go-to type of team. Sorenson, a three-time Ail-American,
bore the brunt of work last season. This year, however, the
coaching staff will look for big contributions from the entire
rotation.
"We don't have any one overbearing-type pitcher like
Dana, but [we have pitchers that can| hit spots and change
speeds," Rittman said. "If you can do that, you can be ef-

fective."
If last year's 13-8 record and 2.30
ERA are any indication, junior right
hander Lauren Severson is slated to
be the Cardinal ace this season.
"There is no question that
Laura is going to have to step it up
and take a leadership role with the
pitching staff," Rittman said, be
fore adding that the weight of the
season won't rest solely on her
shoulders.
Sophomore Danika Dukes,
freshman Becky McCullough and
freshman Lauren Nydam fill out the
rest of the pitching staff. The right
handed Dukes, who had a 2.92 ERA
in 24 innings last season, could see
time considerable time this weekend
in relief.
Nydam is recovering from an in
jury and will not pitch this weekend.
Stanford Classic Preview
Leading off the Cardinal's season
is the Stanford Classic this weekend.
While anxious to get its base running
underway, Stanford is tip-toeing
around opening day jitters.
"It's the first weekend, and other
teams will be pumped up," Rittman
said. "| We'll try] not to get caught up
in it, being the first weekend."
That might be hard to do, as the
Cardinal are thrown into the fast
pace of the season with the four
game, three-day tournament.
Stanford beat its two opponents

this weekend a combined four times
last season en route to a glistening
.720 winning percentage overall.
"We're playing two programs
we're really familiar with; they're
kind of like rivals for us," Rittman
said.
Santa Clara comes into the Boyd
and Jill Smith Family Stadium at 3
p.m. this Friday with a 1-1 record
(the Broncos went 30-23 last year).
Liz Courter, who suffered a loss
Tuesday, will likely he on the mound
for Santa Clara.
Stanford will play a double
header on Saturday, with a 4 p.m.
start against Pacific (36-23, 2004)
following up a 2 p.m. game against
Santa Clara. Gina Carbonatto, also
named to the 2005 Watch List,
sparks the Tigers' offense. In her
debut season last year, the sopho
more outfielder hit .449 before suf
fering a season-ending injury in
early May.
Pacific has a balanced lineup
filled out by several upperclassmen,
and returns an experienced pitcher
in junior Natalie King, who has com
piled a 1.90 ERA in her two seasons
at Stockton.
A 1 p.m. Sunday game against the
Tigers closes out the weekend.
While the Cardinal lineup is yet to
be finalized, this weekend's round of
games will surely provide enough
feedback for Rittman and the Cardi
nal to start making their way around
this season's bases.

debut season last year, the sopho
more outfielder hit .449 before suf
fering a season-ending injury in
early May.
Pacific has a balanced lineup
filled out by several upperclassmen,
and returns an experienced pitcher
in junior Natalie King, who has com
piled a 1.90 ERA in her two seasons
at Stockton.
A 1 p.m. Sunday game against the
Tigers closes out the weekend.
While the Cardinal lineup is yet to
be finalized, this weekend's round of
games will surely provide enough
feedback for Rittman and the Cardi
nal to start making their way around
this season's bases.
This weekend, Stanford's softball field will be the hub of
a search for balance. The perfect balance in the perfect bat,
the ideal stability and steadiness of the pitcher... the list
goes on. But the No. 5 Cardinal are looking fora different
type of balance — one that isn't necessarily found on the
field, but within the team.
The 2005 Cardinal must cope with the graduation of All-

American battery Dana Sorensen and Jessica Allister.
Sorensen, who boasted a 1.41 ERA, notched 34 wins as the
Cardinal's ace. In addition to her leadership, Allister hit
.345 and drove in 55 runs.
Finding new team leaders is a priority for head coach
John Rittman as the Cardinal look to return to the College
World Series. With six freshmen in the mix, Stanford must
develop a new team chemistry and find the right balance
between youth and experience.
"It's going to be a big key for us," Rittman said. " Any

time you have six freshmen and six seniors, and you have
people used to playing a lot of innings, you have to stay co
hesive as a team."
With the first pitch of the 2005 season less than 48 hours
away, Rittman is not at a loss for players willing to step into
new roles.
"Everyone provides a type of leadership, whether it's
vocal or on the field with actions," Rittman said. "But our
seniors know what it takes at this level... our whole team
has stepped up and taken responsibility."
The veterans should lead Stanford to another successful
season on the heels of last year's third-place finish at the
College World Series, where Stanford lost to eventual
champion UCLA. But if the Cardinal are to come close to
repeating last season's 49-19 record, their non-seniors will
play a big part.
Sophomore Jackie Rinehart and junior Lauren Lappin
were both among the 40 selected for the USA Softball Col
legiate Player of the Year Award Watch List. Rinehart,
who swings from the left, hit an impressive .356 her first
year on the Farm and led Stanford with 80 hits. Those stats
seem hard to improve upon, but according to Rittman, the
leftfielder has not only matured, but she has developed
power and arm strength as well. Her role as a "flapper and
a bunter," then, looks to change.
Lappin, Stanford's highly regarded shortstop, hit .358 last
season.
Rittman expects the left-side combo to provide leader
ship, along with junior centerfielder Catalina Morris, in the
field.
This year's offense should also be a little more balanced
with the addition of the freshmen, many who have earned
starting spots on the squad. With the new additions, Stan
ford has gained depth and variety, including a lefty in a
right-heavy lineup.
"We're going to be a better team offensively, top to bot
tom," Rittman said. "The freshmen will provide and add
power and speed post more numbers.
Rittman admits that last year's squad was a one-pitcher
go-to type of team. Sorenson, a three-time Ail-American,
bore the brunt of work last season. This year, however, the
coaching staff will look for big contributions from the entire
rotation.
"We don't have any one overbearing-type pitcher like
Dana, but [we have pitchers that can| hit spots and change
speeds," Rittman said. "If you can do that, you can be ef-

fective."
If last year's 13-8 record and 2.30
ERA are any indication, junior right
hander Lauren Severson is slated to
be the Cardinal ace this season.
"There is no question that
Laura is going to have to step it up
and take a leadership role with the
pitching staff," Rittman said, be
fore adding that the weight of the
season won't rest solely on her
shoulders.
Sophomore Danika Dukes,
freshman Becky McCullough and
freshman Lauren Nydam fill out the
rest of the pitching staff. The right
handed Dukes, who had a 2.92 ERA
in 24 innings last season, could see
time considerable time this weekend
in relief.
Nydam is recovering from an in
jury and will not pitch this weekend.
Stanford Classic Preview
Leading off the Cardinal's season
is the Stanford Classic this weekend.
While anxious to get its base running
underway, Stanford is tip-toeing
around opening day jitters.
"It's the first weekend, and other
teams will be pumped up," Rittman
said. "| We'll try] not to get caught up
in it, being the first weekend."
That might be hard to do, as the
Cardinal are thrown into the fast
pace of the season with the four
game, three-day tournament.
Stanford beat its two opponents

this weekend a combined four times
last season en route to a glistening
.720 winning percentage overall.
"We're playing two programs
we're really familiar with; they're
kind of like rivals for us," Rittman
said.
Santa Clara comes into the Boyd
and Jill Smith Family Stadium at 3
p.m. this Friday with a 1-1 record
(the Broncos went 30-23 last year).
Liz Courter, who suffered a loss
Tuesday, will likely he on the mound
for Santa Clara.
Stanford will play a double
header on Saturday, with a 4 p.m.
start against Pacific (36-23, 2004)
following up a 2 p.m. game against
Santa Clara. Gina Carbonatto, also
named to the 2005 Watch List,
