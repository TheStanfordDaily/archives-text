# New-look softball team seeks perfect balance
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
This weekend, Stanford's softball field will be the hub of
a search for balance. The perfect balance in the perfect bat,
the ideal stability and steadiness of the pitcher... the list
goes on. But the No. 5 Cardinal are looking fora different
type of balance â€” one that isn't necessarily found on the
field, but within the team.
The 2005 Cardinal must cope with the graduation of All-

American battery Dana Sorensen and Jessica Allister.
Sorensen, who boasted a 1.41 ERA, notched 34 wins as the
Cardinal's ace. In addition to her leadership, Allister hit
.345 and drove in 55 runs.
Finding new team leaders is a priority for head coach
John Rittman as the Cardinal look to return to the College
World Series. With six freshmen in the mix, Stanford must
develop a new team chemistry and find the right balance
between youth and experience.
"It's going to be a big key for us," Rittman said. " Any

time you have six freshmen and six seniors, and you have
people used to playing a lot of innings, you have to stay co
hesive as a team."
With the first pitch of the 2005 season less than 48 hours
away, Rittman is not at a loss for players willing to step into
new roles.
"Everyone provides a type of leadership, whether it's
vocal or on the field with actions," Rittman said. "But our
seniors know what it takes at this level... our whole team
has stepped up and taken responsibility."
The veterans should lead Stanford to another successful
season on the heels of last year's third-place finish at the
College World Series, where Stanford lost to eventual
champion UCLA. But if the Cardinal are to come close to
repeating last season's 49-19 record, their non-seniors will
play a big part.
Sophomore Jackie Rinehart and junior Lauren Lappin
were both among the 40 selected for the USA Softball Col
legiate Player of the Year Award Watch List. Rinehart,
who swings from the left, hit an impressive .356 her first
year on the Farm and led Stanford with 80 hits. Those stats
seem hard to improve upon, but according to Rittman, the
leftfielder has not only matured, but she has developed
power and arm strength as well. Her role as a "flapper and
a bunter," then, looks to change.
Lappin, Stanford's highly regarded shortstop, hit .358 last
season.
Rittman expects the left-side combo to provide leader
ship, along with junior centerfielder Catalina Morris, in the
field.
This year's offense should also be a little more balanced
with the addition of the freshmen, many who have earned
starting spots on the squad. With the new additions, Stan
ford has gained depth and variety, including a lefty in a
right-heavy lineup.
"We're going to be a better team offensively, top to bot
tom," Rittman said. "The freshmen will provide and add
power and speed post more numbers.
Rittman admits that last year's squad was a one-pitcher
go-to type of team. Sorenson, a three-time Ail-American,
bore the brunt of work last season. This year, however, the
coaching staff will look for big contributions from the entire
rotation.
"We don't have any one overbearing-type pitcher like
Dana, but [we have pitchers that can| hit spots and change
speeds," Rittman said. "If you can do that, you can be ef-
