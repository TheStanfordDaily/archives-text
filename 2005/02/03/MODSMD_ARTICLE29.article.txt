### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When Walt Harris was named Stan
ford's new head football coach, he had to
juggle double-duty. Harris had the chal
lenge of preparing his Pittsburgh squad
for their Fiesta Bowl while simultane
ously pursuing recruits for the Cardinal.
Today, after all of the phone calls, cross
country jet-setting and limited sleep,
Harris put his first stamp on the Stanford
football community by signing 16 ath
letes to letters of intent.
The incoming class, which represents
12 states, is comprised of 10 defensive
specialists, four offensive players and
two who play both sides of the line. The
recruiting focus was mainly defensive
considering last season's offense-minded
approach and the graduating class.
Many of the newcomers were identi

stuck to those lists. The coaching staff
said it is very pleased with the results of
the decision, because many of their re
cruits turned down offers from arguably
more successful football programs.
"The winning edge in this stuff is what
we have to offer at our university," Har
ris said. "I think our players did a good
job selling ... the camaraderie and the
tightness of our team."
In addition, Stanford has an allure to
recruits' parents, which helps in the pro
cess: "Mom and Dad are in our boat,"
Harris said with a smile.
In addition to mom and dad, one of
Stanford's new recruits had brother and
sister in his boat. Defensive lineman
Ekom Udofia, whose brother Udeme is a
defensive end for the Cardinal and
whose sister Aniebiet is a Stanford grad,
joins the Cardinal as one of the most
highly regarded players in the nation.
Udofia is a Prep All-American and is the
only one of the Stanford signers listed
among ESPN's top 50 recruits.
Outside linebacker Will Powers, who
hails from nearby Foster City, has the dis
tinction of being the first recruit that Har
ris visited upon arriving from Pittsburgh.
"Personally, I targeted him," Harris
said. "I think he's going to provide a lot of
leadership for (his] class, as well as skill."
Stanford also reeled in two players that
Harris and his staff attempted to recruit at
Pittsburgh but couldn't â€” highly regarded
