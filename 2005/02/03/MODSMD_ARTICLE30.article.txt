# Card to face No. 20 Chippewas Friday
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 30 women's gymnastics team
(1-1) is off to a slow start. Ranked No. 3
in the preseason, the team has yet to re
alize its potential. It has had to cope with
injuries, a lack of senior leadership and a
large freshman class that is still adjusting
to collegiate competition.
With two meets under their belt and
with two gymnasts back from the injured
list, however, this weekend could be a
turning point for the Cardinal.
Stanford will take the road to face No.
20 Central Michigan (4-1) on Friday
night.
Freshman Tabitha Yim and junior
captain Natalie Foley, who both sat out
last weekend's meet due to injury, will
likely compete on the uneven bars this
weekend and possibly on the balance
beam as well.
The addition of Yim. fourth place fin
isher at the Olympic Trials this past sum
mer, will make an immediate impact on
the team's scoring capability on the bars.
Yim ruptured her Achilles tendon just
weeks before the Olympic Games and

has been recovering since then. She is
ready to compete on balance beam and
possibly other events as well, but head
coach Kristen Smyth says she does not
want to push her too fast.
"My conservativism as a coach makes
me want to hold her back so she has a
chance to do the Ail-Around in March
and April," Smyth said. "With a healthy
body, she is just incredible."
Contributions from Foley, an eight
time All-American and team leader, will
also give the Cardinal a big boost on the
scoreboard.
Foley injured her ankle two weeks ago
but is recuperating well. Ankle problems
are also plaguing fellow juniors Glyn
Sweets and captain Jessica Louie. Sweets
has been competing in every event ex
cept floor exercise, but Louie will be out
until March or April.
Freshman Liz Tricase will likely lead
the Cardinal on the scoreboard at Friday
night's meet. The four-time U.S. Nation
al Team member was voted the Pacific
-10 Conference gymnast of the week for
her performance at last weekend's home
meet, a 193.125 to 192.350 victory over
Oregon State.

Tricase won the uneven bars with a
9.95 and the vault with a 9.90. She cer
tainly left room for improvement, how
ever, on the floor exercise and the bal
ance beam. She fell on both events, cost
ing her first place in the All-Around (she
took second place behind freshman Alex
Pintchouk). Tricase has only been prac
ticing her floor routine for ihree weeks,
however, so with some more time she will
be able to work out the kinks and be in
top form on the event in the future.
This is the first time this season that a
Stanford gymnast has been named Pac
-10 gymnast of the week. Also nominated
for the award this week was UCLA's
Tasha Schwikert. Schwikert edged out
Tricase at the Olympic Trials this past
summer, earning an eighth-place finish
over Tricase's lOth-place finish.
The close competition between the
two gymnasts has continued on the colle
giate scene. Tricase is ranked sixth on
vault and Schwikert is ranked 10th; Tric
ase is ranked sixth on bars and Schwikert
is ranked fourth.
