# Track teams head to the Big Apple
## 
### RACHEL HODARA 
On the heels of last weekend's
season openers in Boise and Seat
tle, the men's and women's track
ind field teams are once again

gearing up to travel. The squad will
compete in New York City at the
high-profile New Balance Armory
Invitational Friday and Saturday.
"The quality of the New York
meet will be a whole lot better,"

head women's coach Edrick Flore
al said. "There will be much more
excitement, times will be a lot
faster."
Head men's coach Robert Weir
shared the same sentiment.

"It's going to be a lot better,"
Weir said. "A very exciting track
meet."
Weir plans to take primarily his
middle distance and distance run
ners, along with a smajl group off
throwers, sprinters and pole
vaulters. Weir had only positive
things to say about redshirt fresh
man thrower Mike Macellari and
freshman sprinter Wopamo Osai
sai, who will travel with the team
this weekend.
Freshman pole vaulter Graeme
Hoste will also travel to New York,
where he will be tested against a
higher level of competition.
"Hoste had such a splendid
showing in Seattle," Weir said.
"We'll see how he does at this next
meet."
Senior sprinters Curtis
Goehring and Nick Sebes are also
expected to do well this weekend.
They are the strengths of Stan
ford's 4x400 meter relay, which
placed second last weekend at the
Body√üuilding.com Invitational.
The focus will be on the men's
middle distance and distance run
ners, who are some of the best in
the country.
Floreal will take all of his top
athletes to New York. He is hoping
the examples of junior Anita Siraki
and freshman Erica McClain last
weekend will be motivation for the
women to reach the highest levels
of excellence at the Armory Invita
tional.
The strong group of Cardinal
sprinters is expected to continue its
success from last weekend. Sopho
mores Janice Davis, Ashley Pur
nell and Ashley Freeman, senior
Christine Moschella and junior
Nashonme Johnson all ran well at
Boise State and will travel to New
York this weekend.
The women's team will take a
handful of distance runners to the
Armory.
"We're taking people from the
East coast to give them a chance to
compete in front of their families,"
women's head coach Dena Evans
said.
That includes sophomore Ari
anna Lambie, who will make her
2005 debut after a spectacular
freshman season.
"We're really looking forward
to seeing her get her uniform on,"
Evans said.
Freshman Lauren Centrowitz,
who finished 14th at the Pac-10
Cross Couutry Championships dur
ing the fall, will also make the trip.
"This will give Lauren the op
portunity to run in a very good col
legiate field," Evans said.
The Armory Track and Field
Center is located in the Washing
ton Heights district of Manhattan.
The New Balance Collegiate Invi
tation has been held there for the
past five years.
In 2001, Alan Webb broke a
high school indoor record at the
Armory, running the mile in under
four minutes.
