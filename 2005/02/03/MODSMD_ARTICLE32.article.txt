### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team (5-5-1, 1-3-1 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) will wrestle a dual meet on the
Farm this weekend for the first time in over two
months. Two familiar foes, Fresno State (6-6-1),
and No. 16 Arizona State (7-6-1,4-0-0 Pac-10), will
take on the Cardinal at Burnham Pavilion tomor
row at 6 p.m. and Feb. 5 at noon, respectively.
Stanford's last home dual meet was against Divi
sion II opponent San Francisco State on Nov. 23;
since then. Stanford has visited nine different gyms
and traveled everywhere from Texas to lowa.
"Primarily, the crowd and the familiar surround
ings are what give us an advantage," head coach
Steve Buddie said. "As minor as this seems, even
weighing in on our own scale is a small advantage,
because the team just knows exactly what to expect,
and those 'game day' surprises that always seem to
jump out at you on the road are minimized, if not
eliminated, when competing at home. [Still] we all
know how many distractions there are on this cam
pus."
Fresno State will try to avenge last year's loss to
Stanford for their coach Dennis Deliddo, who will
be retiring after 24 seasons as head coach. The Car
dinal's win was their first over the Bulldogs in 34
years. Fresno State, a former Pac-10 team, is led by
three seniors and one sophomore who are ranked
in the top 20 in the nation for their weightclasses:
senior Jim Medeiros (No. 17 at 157 pounds), sopho
more Shane Seibert (No. 16 at 165), senior Clint
Walbeck (No. 13 at heavyweight) and senior Mar
cio Botelho (No. 8 at 197).
"Fresno State has a number of wrestlers that
we've beaten before," 165-pound freshman Scott
Loescher said. "Also, last year we beat them on the
road, so I like our chances."
Arizona State is at the top of the Pac-10 stand
ings, and they will be putting their perfect confer
ence record on the line this Saturday. The Sun Dev
ils are led by a group of six wrestlers who are
ranked in the top 20 of their weightclasses. includ
ing junior Jeremy Mendoza (No. 10 at 125 pounds),
senior Patrick Williams (No. 10 at 149), sophomore
Brian Stith (No. 14 at 157), junior C.B. Dollaway
(No. II at 184), junior Ryan Bader (No. 7 at 197)
and junior Cain Velasquez (No. 4 at 285).
"ASU is the favorite to win the Pac-10 Champi

onships this season, so this will be a good measuring
stick for us," Buddie said. "Winning some key
bouts will help us with seeding in several weight
classes for the Championships as well."
Like the Sun Devils, Stanford senior co-captain
Matt Gentry will be defending an unbeaten streak
this weekend. The 157-pounder, who will be chal
lenged by Stith and Medeiros, has a school record
61 straight wins.
"The 157 pounders from both Fresno State and
Arizona State have given me my closest matches of
the year, both double-overtime wins, so 1 am look
ing forward to some really close matches this week
end," Gentry said. "I try not to let my past record
and all the pressure get to me. Really what is im
portant is my next match, not my last match, so
keeping that perspective and wrestling well are
what is important, not what I have accomplished."
Stanford continues to be bitten by the injury
bug. Sophomores lan Bork and Juston Johnson are
likely to be out at 197 pounds and 133 pounds, re
spectively. The Cardinal hope that exceptionally
hard practices and experience gained from their re
cent Oregon road trip will pay dividends and be the
difference in the dual meets.
"We've become closer as a team over the past
month than we have been all
season," Loescher said. "Being able to bond with
nine of your teammates allows you to put your trust
in them 100 percent."
"Each year, we try to travel somewhere different
to keep the season exciting and fresh," Buddie said.
"Learning to deal with the unexpected is a huge
part of learning mental toughness, which is proba
bly the greatest tool you can have in wrestling. To
not get rattled when surprises are thrown your way
... is a valuable lesson"
Stanford is putting great importance on individ
ual improvement with the Pac-10 Championships
looming. Though a team win is of lesser importance
to the coaches, especially given the impact of for
feits on the Cardinal's record, the wrestlers believe
that the wins will come if everyone does their job.
"A success would be wrestling well and winning
all the close matches," Gentry said. "If we do th.lt,
we will beat both teams, because the dual meet will
come down to who wins the close matches."
And many Stanford wrestlers are thinking big.
"We expect nothing less than 2-0." Loescher
said.

because the team just knows exactly what to expect,
and those 'game day' surprises that always seem to
jump out at you on the road are minimized, if not
eliminated, when competing at home. [Still] we all
know how many distractions there are on this cam
pus."
Fresno State will try to avenge last year's loss to
Stanford for their coach Dennis Deliddo, who will
be retiring after 24 seasons as head coach. The Car
dinal's win was their first over the Bulldogs in 34
years. Fresno State, a former Pac-10 team, is led by
three seniors and one sophomore who are ranked
in the top 20 in the nation for their weightclasses:
senior Jim Medeiros (No. 17 at 157 pounds), sopho
more Shane Seibert (No. 16 at 165), senior Clint
Walbeck (No. 13 at heavyweight) and senior Mar
cio Botelho (No. 8 at 197).
"Fresno State has a number of wrestlers that
we've beaten before," 165-pound freshman Scott
Loescher said. "Also, last year we beat them on the
road, so I like our chances."
Arizona State is at the top of the Pac-10 stand
ings, and they will be putting their perfect confer
ence record on the line this Saturday. The Sun Dev
ils are led by a group of six wrestlers who are
ranked in the top 20 of their weightclasses. includ
ing junior Jeremy Mendoza (No. 10 at 125 pounds),
senior Patrick Williams (No. 10 at 149), sophomore
Brian Stith (No. 14 at 157), junior C.B. Dollaway
(No. II at 184), junior Ryan Bader (No. 7 at 197)
and junior Cain Velasquez (No. 4 at 285).
"ASU is the favorite to win the Pac-10 Champi

onships this season, so this will be a good measuring
stick for us," Buddie said. "Winning some key
bouts will help us with seeding in several weight
classes for the Championships as well."
Like the Sun Devils, Stanford senior co-captain
Matt Gentry will be defending an unbeaten streak
this weekend. The 157-pounder, who will be chal
lenged by Stith and Medeiros, has a school record
61 straight wins.
"The 157 pounders from both Fresno State and
Arizona State have given me my closest matches of
the year, both double-overtime wins, so 1 am look
ing forward to some really close matches this week
end," Gentry said. "I try not to let my past record
and all the pressure get to me. Really what is im
portant is my next match, not my last match, so
keeping that perspective and wrestling well are
what is important, not what I have accomplished."
Stanford continues to be bitten by the injury
bug. Sophomores lan Bork and Juston Johnson are
likely to be out at 197 pounds and 133 pounds, re
spectively. The Cardinal hope that exceptionally
hard practices and experience gained from their re
cent Oregon road trip will pay dividends and be the
difference in the dual meets.
"We've become closer as a team over the past
month than we have been all
season," Loescher said. "Being able to bond with
nine of your teammates allows you to put your trust
in them 100 percent."
"Each year, we try to travel somewhere different
to keep the season exciting and fresh," Buddie said.
"Learning to deal with the unexpected is a huge
part of learning mental toughness, which is proba
bly the greatest tool you can have in wrestling. To
not get rattled when surprises are thrown your way
... is a valuable lesson"
Stanford is putting great importance on individ
ual improvement with the Pac-10 Championships
looming. Though a team win is of lesser importance
to the coaches, especially given the impact of for
feits on the Cardinal's record, the wrestlers believe
that the wins will come if everyone does their job.
"A success would be wrestling well and winning
all the close matches," Gentry said. "If we do th.lt,
we will beat both teams, because the dual meet will
come down to who wins the close matches."
And many Stanford wrestlers are thinking big.
"We expect nothing less than 2-0." Loescher
said.
The Stanford wrestling team (5-5-1, 1-3-1 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) will wrestle a dual meet on the
Farm this weekend for the first time in over two
months. Two familiar foes, Fresno State (6-6-1),
and No. 16 Arizona State (7-6-1,4-0-0 Pac-10), will
take on the Cardinal at Burnham Pavilion tomor
row at 6 p.m. and Feb. 5 at noon, respectively.
Stanford's last home dual meet was against Divi
sion II opponent San Francisco State on Nov. 23;
since then. Stanford has visited nine different gyms
and traveled everywhere from Texas to lowa.
"Primarily, the crowd and the familiar surround
ings are what give us an advantage," head coach
Steve Buddie said. "As minor as this seems, even
weighing in on our own scale is a small advantage,
