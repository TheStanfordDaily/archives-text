# No. 8 Card head to Sin City
## Men are looking to shake off loss to Cal 
### ABBY ZEITLIN 
The No. 8 Stanford men's gymnas
tics team will travel to Las Vegas to
compete in the Winter Cup this week
end. The two-day event featuring top
notch competitors will culminate with
the finals on Saturday night.
The Cardinal hope to perform well
after a disappointing loss to N0.7 Cal
ifornia two weeks ago at the Cardinal
Open. The Bay Area rivals are play
ing a game of cat and mouse, flip-flop
ping in the rankings over the past few
weeks, but the Cardinal will face more
pressure from other NCAA teams
this weekend.
Head coach Thom Glielmi attribut
ed much of the Cardinal Open's disap
pointment to the men's excitement for
their first home meet. The Cardinal
should be calmer and more mentally
prepared this weekend.
Some of the top-ranked teams will
compete at the tournament, including
Fenn State, Temple. Military. Illinois.
lowa and Michigan. Washington will
also participate, but as a club team.
Illinois is currently ranked No. 2,
closely followed by No. 3 Michigan.
Both pose major competition to the
Cardinal.
The Winter Cup is organized into
two sessions: Session 1 will be com
peting Senior National Team Mem
bers and Session 2 will include partici
pants from the Senior Ail-Around Fi
nals from the 2004 U.S. Champi
onships. Freshman David Sender and
sophomore Jason Shen will be the
only Cardinal athletes to compete in
Session 1.
Only five of the Cardinal pre-qual
ified this weekend, including sopho
mores Dylan Carney and Shen and

freshmen Chris Harper, Sho
Nakamori and Sender. Each of these
men is under considerably more pres
sure to perform well.
The team can bring six gymnasts,
although only five of the scores are
counted for the final tally. However,
the young Cardinal athletes compet
ing in Las Vegas are prepared to face
their hardest challenge so far this sea
son.
Sender is healthy and expected to
perform well this weekend, especially
on his strength routine, the rings. He
was one of the top competitors at the
Cardinal Open, winning the All-
Around, in addition to earning the
team's highest scores on the still rings
and the vault. Although Nakamori

struggled throughout the Cardinal
Open, he says he is mentally more
prepared for this meet.
Harper also had an extremely diffi
cult routine on the pommel horse at
the Cardinal Open, hut he has fine
tuned many of the skills in prepara
tion for this weekend. Carney is cur
rently tied for No. 9 on the floor exer
cise after earning a 9.45 at the Cardi
nal Open, the team's highest score.
Glielmi says he is hoping that Stan
ford's second-ranked rings team will
help propel the Cardinal to a victory
this weekend, although they have also
been more focused on the vault.
The team competition will begin
Friday at 5:30 p.m., and the finals will
be held on Saturday at 6:30 p.m.
