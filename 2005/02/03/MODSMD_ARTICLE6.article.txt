# Little strives to keep winning legacy alive

### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Ai a press conference two days before Stanford's
home game against Arizona State in early January,
head coach Trent Johnson talked about the chal
lenge of getting Rob Little to play out of his comfort
zone.
Simulating the post-game atmosphere of the se
nior center's first collegiate game might do the trick.
"We played New Mexico at the Pit," Little said,
reflecting back on the jam-packed, high-altitude
site of his welcome-to-Di vision I-college-basketball
moment in 2(X)1. "When we finally won, the whole
place was booing the refs and us, and they were
throwing everything they possibly could — coins,
bottles, cans, seat covers. 1 was like, 'Is this really
how it is every time you win?'"
As Little would soon learn, it wasn't. That's a
good thing considering the Cardinal have won 75
percent of their games in Little's three-and-a-half
years on the Farm. Stanford finished second in the
Pac-10 during Little's first two years, before win
ning the Pac-10 regular season and tournament ti
tles last season en route to a No. 1 seed in the
NCAA Tournament.
All of that made the first half of this season
especially tough on Little, who likened Stan
ford's rocky start to the one he went through as
a senior at Paul VI High School in Fairfax, Va.
That team never recovered from a couple of
early-season injuries, and Little didn't want the
same thing to happen to him at Stanford four
years later.
While coaches and teammates are quick to talk
about the success that Little, a political science and
philosophy double major, will continue to have in
life after basketball — Johnson called Little one of
the brightest people he knows — he is more con
cerned right now about not going down in history as
a senior leader on the team that ended Stanford's 10-
year tournament run.
"As a senior, I want to walk away from this pro
gram happy and satisfied, and that is contingent
upon us winning this year and making sure that
those winning ways will continue in the future," Lit
tle said. "I feel like the best thing I can do for the un
derclassmen is show them what it takes to win at
Stanford and also how to do so graciously. We've
been really good here fora long time and I think
that what also makes winning special is humility and
respect for your opponents."
Little speaks volumes about the respect he has
for the big men he will face this weekend — Ari
zona State's Ike Diogu and Arizona's Channing
Frye — and says he learned a lot of what he knows
about winning from a cast of talented teammates
who passed through the program before him, in
cluding first-round NBA draft pick Curtis Bor
chardt.
"Curtis was a very savvy player and he told me
that that was the first thing that 1 needed to pick up
on," Little said. "Justin [Davis] was just a relentless
fighter and a very smart player. He talked with me a
lot about the mental aspect about being a big man
here and also being a good team player."

Always a team player, Little has taken a more ac
tive role during Stanford's recent resurgence. He
and junior guard Dan Grunfeld are the only Stan
ford players who have scored in double figures in
each of the Cardinal's six wins during the streak. Lit
tle averaged 12.7 points — on 62.8 percent shooting
— and 7.8 rebounds per game during that span, rais
ing his season averages to 10.2 and 5.6, respectively.
The key to the turnaround?
"In my mind there was just going to be a point
when we were going to win," Little said. "The key
was staying positive in the midst of all the media
criticism. It's easy to stay positive when you are win
ning. I think we showed a lot of character when
were down 0-3 in the league and looked the Wild
cats in the face and said, 'You're not leaving here
without a fight!'"
Little responded with one of his best fights of the
year, scoring 16 points on 7-for-10 shooting and
grabbing 12 rebounds in the Cardinal's 87-76 upset
of Arizona. Stanford hasn't lost since.
"I think everybody wants to leave a program or
business that they enter into better than how they
received it," Little said. "As a freshman I came
into a program that had won three straight Pac-10
titles and was ranked No 1. Last year we had that
similar kind of success and that was very fulfilling
for me."
Little also gets fulfillment spreading the knowl
edge about basketball and life he has accrued over
his time here to freshmen posts Peter Prowitt and
Taj Finger. Little predicts both players will enjoy
successful collegiate careers, citing their strong
work ethic and listening skills.
"I've always admired Rob, so I'm glad I got the
chance to come out here and play with him." said
Prowitt, a fellow Virginian who saw Little play in
high school. "Rob definitely does a good job of
showing me the ropes a little bit. He's really good
with teaching me to control my emotions and stay
ing level-headed. I've been known to have kind of
a temper, but Rob has definitely helped me with
that aspect.
Earlier this week, Johnson touched on Little's
comfort zone once again, suggesting that a little
anger on the court might actually be beneficial to his
even-keeled center.
"We're trying to get Rob to play a bit tougher
this year," Johnson said. "He always tries to make
everybody happy, but we want him to be a little
more nasty on the boards."
Little's retort?
"I am a control freak right down to my emotions,
and I really try to not let the actions of others
change my outlook on life or on the court," Little
said. "Sometimes I think I play better when I am
angry at something, but I also think being under
control is important. I think 1 play better cool head
ed with a little bit of an edge. When I am playing
well. I feel very focused and very calm; 1 feel as
though things just come to me."
Johnson's good intentions aren't going unno
ticed. however.
"1 do feel that Coach knows what button to push
with me," Little said. "He is a great people reader
and that is a sign of a really good coach."


LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily
Senior center Rob Little has helped the Cardinal rise from the depths of an 0-3 start in Pac-10 play with solid inside play
during the team's six-game winning streak. Little will have the tough task of limiting Arizona State's Ike Diogu tonight.
