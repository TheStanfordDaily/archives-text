# Women welcome Wildcats to Maples
## Arizona looks to avenge January loss that snapped its 34-game home winning streak 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Winning the second time around is always
a little harder than the first. The No. 4 Stan
ford women's basketball team (19-2, 10-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) will have to keep that in
mind when it takes on the preseason Pac-10
favorite Arizona (15-6,7-3) tonight at Maples
Pavilion.
The Cardinal are riding a season-high 10-
game winning streak and are marching through
the conference schedule after an early stumble
at Oregon. The latest victims were the Washing
ton State Cougars, who fell 69-56 last Saturday.
Seniors Susan King Borchardt. Sebnem Kimya
cioglu and Azella Perryman scored 10 points
apiece, while five other Cardinal players con
tributed between six and nine points.
The Wildcats are recovering from a heart
breaking loss to No. 20 Maryland in overtime.
Arizona erased a 10-point deficit in the game
before falling 84-77.
Arizona boasts a good outside-inside game,
with guard Dee-Dee Wheeler leading the team
in scoring with 17.6 points per game and center
Shawntinice Polk right behind her with 13.5
points per game.
"We're going to have to play really good
team defense," Borchardt said. "They have a
couple of standout players and some excellent
surrounding players so it'll be a tough
matchup."
The Cardinal allowed the Wildcats scoring
duo to score a combined 37 points but still pulled
out a win in their first meeting this season, end
ing Arizona's 34-game home winning streak.
"We're not concentrating on our win streak."
Borchardt said. "We're looking at each team in
dividually and each game is important. It's not
like we're all excited about this game against
Arizona and then not Arizona State."
Stanford rode the brilliant performance of
Candice Wiggins in the first game, as the fresh
man guard scored 28 points. In last Thursday's
matchup, the Cardinal will look to shore up their
presence on the glass.
"We've been working on rebounding and
making sure they don't get too many offensive
rebounds because that was a problem last
game," junior center Brooke Smith said.
"They're a really good team and have some
great three-point shooters, and they're big in
side. We need to also stop them in transition be

cause they have some quick guards that get them
going."
The Cardinal will look to combat the Arizona
fasthreak with a transition game of their own.
"I think as a team we're looking to get out and
run." Borchardt said. "They have some bigger

bodies inside so we should try and take advan
tage of that."
"This is a really big weekend for us. both Ari
zona and Arizona State are really good teams,"
Smith said. "It'd be great to come out with a pair
of wins."
