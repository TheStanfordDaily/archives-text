## New committee studies grad life 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Members of the Graduate Student Council are recruiting
graduate student input from every department and school on
campus in hopes of improving the educational opportunities and
general quality of life for graduate students.
The Commission on Graduate Education, formed this acade
mic year, will be creating about a dozen focus groups — of 12 to
18 graduate students each — to investigate different topics relat
ed to graduate life.
"[The focus groups) are not intended to be decision-making
bodies, but rather to help inform the CGE and its sub-committee
on the issues that affect the lives and thus the work of Stanford's
graduate students," said Denis Phillips, professor of education
and philosophy.
"The CGE will be formulating its recommendations during
spring quarter, and hence the groups will meet during the later
part of winter quarter," he added.
According to Phillips, the purpose of the focus groups' discus
sions will be to provide "relevant groups of students a chance to
refine these issues, but more importantly to brainstorm possible
and innovative solutions, or directions in which Stanford ought to
move,"
Moriah Thomason, a fourth-year neuroscience Ph.D. candi
date and chair of the GSC, said that the CGE is meeting with pro
fessional facilitators now "to optimize our approach to these in
formation gathering sessions."
There are no current plans to hold open meetings or town
halls as part of the CGE, but students already have outlets to talk
about their campus experiences, according to Sohini Ramachan
dran, a biological sciences doctoral student and GSC at-large rep
resentative.
"All students are welcome at Graduate Student Council meet
ings and the Graduate Life Office sponsors dinners throughout
the academic year with both University President John Hennessy
and University Provost John Etchemendy," she said. "We hope
that the creation of the CGE and the publicity surrounding our
focus groups will also raise awareness about these other forums
for graduate students to provide feedback to the University."
