## New committee studies grad life 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Members of the Graduate Student Council are recruiting
graduate student input from every department and school on
campus in hopes of improving the educational opportunities and
general quality of life for graduate students.
The Commission on Graduate Education, formed this acade
mic year, will be creating about a dozen focus groups — of 12 to
18 graduate students each — to investigate different topics relat
ed to graduate life.
"[The focus groups) are not intended to be decision-making
bodies, but rather to help inform the CGE and its sub-committee
on the issues that affect the lives and thus the work of Stanford's
graduate students," said Denis Phillips, professor of education
and philosophy.
"The CGE will be formulating its recommendations during
spring quarter, and hence the groups will meet during the later
part of winter quarter," he added.
According to Phillips, the purpose of the focus groups' discus
sions will be to provide "relevant groups of students a chance to
refine these issues, but more importantly to brainstorm possible
and innovative solutions, or directions in which Stanford ought to
move,"
Moriah Thomason, a fourth-year neuroscience Ph.D. candi
date and chair of the GSC, said that the CGE is meeting with pro
fessional facilitators now "to optimize our approach to these in
formation gathering sessions."
There are no current plans to hold open meetings or town
halls as part of the CGE, but students already have outlets to talk
about their campus experiences, according to Sohini Ramachan
dran, a biological sciences doctoral student and GSC at-large rep
resentative.
"All students are welcome at Graduate Student Council meet
ings and the Graduate Life Office sponsors dinners throughout
the academic year with both University President John Hennessy
and University Provost John Etchemendy," she said. "We hope
that the creation of the CGE and the publicity surrounding our
focus groups will also raise awareness about these other forums
for graduate students to provide feedback to the University."
The topics to he discussed at these con
versation sessions are still being refined.
Most of the ideas have come from CGE
members, GSC members, administrators
and students.
Many graduate students say they see the
focus group format as an ideal means
through which students can get involved in
the future of graduate education at Stanford.
"I'm glad that the CGE is soliciting the
views of graduate students," said Tom Lee,
a third-year doctoral student in Electrical
Engineering and a GSC Engineering
School Representative. "Their report
would not be complete without hearing the
students' side of things."
GSC At-Large Representative Luke
Miller also expressed his excitement.
"I believe they are another sign of the
seriousness with which CGE is approach
ing their directive from President Hen
nessey." he said. "CGE has been collecting
data on graduate education at Stanford
from several sources and speaking with the
key stakeholders such as school deans, fac
ulty, and administrators. Now they are
going to talk to us — the students."
However, students recognize that ideas
developed by the CGE conversation ses
sions will need to be incorporated and im
plemented for them to have a significant
impact on their Stanford experience.

"How these conversations will affect
grad life really depends on what the admin
istration does with the information they re
ceive from these sessions," said Donna
Winston, a first-year doctoral student
studying administration and policy analysis
at the school of education. "If they use
them to constructively develop plans of im
provement, then these sessions can have an
amazingly positive and long-lasting impact.
But if the notes of these sessions are simply
just filed away, then the impact will be neg
ligible." Students have identified a diverse
set of topics that should be discussed dur
ing the conversation sessions.
Winston believes that the most impor
tant graduate issues involve international
students and master's and professional
school students.
"Nearly 40 percent of the graduate stu
dent body is international and they have to
deal with many policy issues, especially
since Sept. 11, that make life a little more
difficult for them," she said. "In regard to
master's and professional students, since
their programs are so short and intense it's
difficult for them to develop long-term ad
vocacy campaigns on their own behalf."
Alice Lincoln, third-year chemistry
doctoral student and chair of the GSC
committee on diversity, is concerned about
the representation of minority graduate

students.
"Like many institutions nationwide,
Stanford suffers atrocious representation
of female and minority graduate students,"
she said. "This is 2005. Are we content to
have only 3b percent of the grad popula
tion be female or just 3 percent African-
American and to have those be largely in
the professional schools?"
According to GSC deputy chair and sec
ond-year business school student Roger
Stanley, ethics is the single most important
topic the focus groups should address.
"I would like very much to see a central
ized, top-down plan that holds each gradu
ate school accountable for developing a
plan to infuse ethical decision-making
throughout the curriculum, whether that
course of study is in business, medicine or
Russian literature," he said. "It must be
more than lip service. It must be something
meaningful and thoughtout."
Lee noted that the CGE should focus on
designing the graduate curriculum to fit the
reality of today's job market for advanced
degree graduates, including non-academic
jobs for doctoral candidates and interdisci
plinary students.
"Gone are the days when a graduate
student could lock himself or herself in a
room and study a subject ad nauseum,"
Lee said. "Today, people coming out of

graduate school aren't going into academia
like they used to. They're getting jobs in
the real world, and in today's world you
can't just know a lot about one thing."
Last February, the GSC conducted a
survey about graduate student satisfaction
with coursework, advising, qualifying
exams, dissertations, workspace and career
preparation.
Miller, a second-year doctoral candi
date at the School of Education who also
serves as the chair of the Graduate Acade
mic Life Survey Committee, identified the
key topics of concern to graduate students
to be: interdisciplinary programs, course
work and research; academic advising; ca
reer preparation; and the role of qualifying
exams.
Lincoln, who also serves as the GSC
H&S Natural Sciences representative, said
he is amazed at how little information is
shared across sectors of the campus and is
optimistic that the CGE will be able to
change this situation.
"The CGE represents a major opportu
nity to enhance the graduate experience,"
she said. "It is my hope that the CGE will
foster needed dialogue that exploits the
creativity of students and administrators in
addressing opportunities for increased ex
cellence."

student could lock himself or herself in a
room and study a subject ad nauseum,"
Lee said. "Today, people coming out of

graduate school aren't going into academia
like they used to. They're getting jobs in
the real world, and in today's world you
can't just know a lot about one thing."
Last February, the GSC conducted a
survey about graduate student satisfaction
with coursework, advising, qualifying
exams, dissertations, workspace and career
preparation.
Miller, a second-year doctoral candi
date at the School of Education who also
serves as the chair of the Graduate Acade
mic Life Survey Committee, identified the
key topics of concern to graduate students
to be: interdisciplinary programs, course
work and research; academic advising; ca
reer preparation; and the role of qualifying
exams.
Lincoln, who also serves as the GSC
H&S Natural Sciences representative, said
he is amazed at how little information is
shared across sectors of the campus and is
optimistic that the CGE will be able to
change this situation.
"The CGE represents a major opportu
nity to enhance the graduate experience,"
she said. "It is my hope that the CGE will
foster needed dialogue that exploits the
creativity of students and administrators in
addressing opportunities for increased ex
cellence."

Policy concerns of international students one
of many issues to be discussed by commission
Members of the Graduate Student Council are recruiting
graduate student input from every department and school on
campus in hopes of improving the educational opportunities and
general quality of life for graduate students.
The Commission on Graduate Education, formed this acade
mic year, will be creating about a dozen focus groups — of 12 to
18 graduate students each — to investigate different topics relat
ed to graduate life.
"[The focus groups) are not intended to be decision-making
bodies, but rather to help inform the CGE and its sub-committee
on the issues that affect the lives and thus the work of Stanford's
graduate students," said Denis Phillips, professor of education
and philosophy.
"The CGE will be formulating its recommendations during
spring quarter, and hence the groups will meet during the later
part of winter quarter," he added.
According to Phillips, the purpose of the focus groups' discus
sions will be to provide "relevant groups of students a chance to
refine these issues, but more importantly to brainstorm possible
and innovative solutions, or directions in which Stanford ought to
move,"
Moriah Thomason, a fourth-year neuroscience Ph.D. candi
date and chair of the GSC, said that the CGE is meeting with pro
fessional facilitators now "to optimize our approach to these in
formation gathering sessions."
There are no current plans to hold open meetings or town
halls as part of the CGE, but students already have outlets to talk
about their campus experiences, according to Sohini Ramachan
dran, a biological sciences doctoral student and GSC at-large rep
resentative.
"All students are welcome at Graduate Student Council meet
ings and the Graduate Life Office sponsors dinners throughout
the academic year with both University President John Hennessy
and University Provost John Etchemendy," she said. "We hope
that the creation of the CGE and the publicity surrounding our
focus groups will also raise awareness about these other forums
for graduate students to provide feedback to the University."
The topics to he discussed at these con
versation sessions are still being refined.
Most of the ideas have come from CGE
members, GSC members, administrators
and students.
Many graduate students say they see the
focus group format as an ideal means
through which students can get involved in
the future of graduate education at Stanford.
"I'm glad that the CGE is soliciting the
views of graduate students," said Tom Lee,
a third-year doctoral student in Electrical
Engineering and a GSC Engineering
School Representative. "Their report
would not be complete without hearing the
students' side of things."
GSC At-Large Representative Luke
Miller also expressed his excitement.
"I believe they are another sign of the
seriousness with which CGE is approach
ing their directive from President Hen
nessey." he said. "CGE has been collecting
data on graduate education at Stanford
from several sources and speaking with the
key stakeholders such as school deans, fac
ulty, and administrators. Now they are
going to talk to us — the students."
However, students recognize that ideas
developed by the CGE conversation ses
sions will need to be incorporated and im
plemented for them to have a significant
impact on their Stanford experience.

"How these conversations will affect
grad life really depends on what the admin
istration does with the information they re
ceive from these sessions," said Donna
Winston, a first-year doctoral student
studying administration and policy analysis
at the school of education. "If they use
them to constructively develop plans of im
provement, then these sessions can have an
amazingly positive and long-lasting impact.
But if the notes of these sessions are simply
just filed away, then the impact will be neg
ligible." Students have identified a diverse
set of topics that should be discussed dur
ing the conversation sessions.
Winston believes that the most impor
tant graduate issues involve international
students and master's and professional
school students.
"Nearly 40 percent of the graduate stu
dent body is international and they have to
deal with many policy issues, especially
since Sept. 11, that make life a little more
difficult for them," she said. "In regard to
master's and professional students, since
their programs are so short and intense it's
difficult for them to develop long-term ad
vocacy campaigns on their own behalf."
Alice Lincoln, third-year chemistry
doctoral student and chair of the GSC
committee on diversity, is concerned about
the representation of minority graduate

students.
"Like many institutions nationwide,
Stanford suffers atrocious representation
of female and minority graduate students,"
she said. "This is 2005. Are we content to
have only 3b percent of the grad popula
tion be female or just 3 percent African-
American and to have those be largely in
the professional schools?"
According to GSC deputy chair and sec
ond-year business school student Roger
Stanley, ethics is the single most important
topic the focus groups should address.
"I would like very much to see a central
ized, top-down plan that holds each gradu
ate school accountable for developing a
plan to infuse ethical decision-making
throughout the curriculum, whether that
course of study is in business, medicine or
Russian literature," he said. "It must be
more than lip service. It must be something
meaningful and thoughtout."
Lee noted that the CGE should focus on
designing the graduate curriculum to fit the
reality of today's job market for advanced
degree graduates, including non-academic
jobs for doctoral candidates and interdisci
plinary students.
"Gone are the days when a graduate
student could lock himself or herself in a
room and study a subject ad nauseum,"
Lee said. "Today, people coming out of

graduate school aren't going into academia
