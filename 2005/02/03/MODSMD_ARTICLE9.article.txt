# Bush stresses domestic agenda
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In his State of the Union Address before Con
gress last night. President George W. Bush focused
largely on the Middle East and on his plan to re
form Social Security.
Bush began the address by hailing "the privilege
of democracy," which the United States now shares
with Afghanistan, the Palestinian territories,
Ukraine and"a free and sovereign Iraq." This
opening was met with cheers and applause from
both parties, but Bush quickly moved on to the
more divisive domestic policy issues.
Promising to cut government spending. Bush
said, "My budget substantially reduces or elimi
nates more than 150 government programs."
The funds saved from these and other cutbacks
will be funneled into the health care system, tax re
lief for small businesses and into his controversial
education initiative, the No Child Left Behind Act.
On his domestic agenda. Social Security was
clearly Bush's main concern. Bush discussed the
roots of the social security system in the post-De
pression economy of the 19305, arguing that the
"very different" needs of today's economy call for
drastic reforms.
Bush promised that these reforms would not cut
benefits for Americans over the age of 55. But for
younger citizens, the "Social Security system has
serious problems that will grow worse with time,"
and by 2042, the "entire system would be exhaust
ed and bankrupt," Bush said.
At the core of Bush's reform plan are "volun
tary personal retirement accounts," which would
urge younger workers to invest their own money in
a "conservative mix of bonds and stock funds." Ac
cording to the plan, the interest from these person
al investments would provide for workers when
they retire, largely replacing the retirement checks
that today's retirees get from the government.
As Bush outlined these reforms. Democrats

booed him from their side of the hall. In the official
response to the State of the Union Address, Sen-

ate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada
lashed out against Bush's plan, scying "it's

wrong to replace the guaranteed benefit
that Americans have earned with a

guaranteed benefit cut of up to 40
percent. Make no mistake, that's
exactly what President Bush is

proposing."
There was also some diver
gence with regard to the war on
terror. Bush praised American
armed forces for confronting
"the enemy abroad, with mea
sures that are determined, suc
cessful and continuing."
Yet he did not suggest a time
frame for when armed conflict in

the Middle East would end. "There
are still governments that sponsor

and harbor terrorists," Bush said, cit
ing Syria and Iran in particular. "We
will stay on the offensive against [terror-

ists] until the fight is won," he added.
In response. House Minority Leader Nancy
Pelosi of California said, "Despite the best efforts

of our troops and their Iraqi counterparts, Iraq still
faces a violent and persistent insurgency."
The Democratic response called fora plan to
bring American troops home.
"We have never heard a clear plan from this ad
ministration for ending our presence in Iraq. And
we did not hear one tonight," Pelosi said.
The Stanford Democrats held an event last
night to watch the president's address. Sophomore
Josh Wiener, a Stanford Democrat, was disap
pointed with what he described as fear-mongering
on the part of the president.
"All the talk about freedom from fear seemed
hypocritical at best," Wiener said. "Because the
rest of the speech kept saying how much we must

Bush's Words by the

Numbers

still
fear terrorism."
Bob Sensenbrenner, president of the Stanford
Republicans, approved of Bush's agenda for the
war on terror, as well as his proposed reforms to
Social Security.
"I'm very glad that the president was aggressive
in promoting Social Security policy, which will re
ally help college-aged students when we come to
retirement age."
Sensenbrenner said he was disappointed with
the Democratic response.
"If [Democrats] really want to suggest a policy,
they need to come up with some of their own ideas,
and not just be the party that's not Bush."
