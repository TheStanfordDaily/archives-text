SEKOU SUNDIATA
BLESSING THE BOATS
"...a lean, spare, evocative piece that
moves with the delicate precision of a
surgeon's scalpel—slicing open a soul
and setting its survivor's spirit loose."
—Berkshire Eagle
blessing the boats is a compelling
montage of poems, prose, and
stand-up comedy riffs inspired
by the author's near-death
experiences. Performance
artist and poet Sekou
Sundiata takes you oh
a unique and riveting
journey of chaos,
hope, and art. A
post-performance
talk is free and open
to the public.
