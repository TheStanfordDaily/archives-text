# FacSen passes new GER guidelines
## 
### JEFF ERFE KATIE BEARMAN 
Beginning next year, Stanford
students will be required to take
one less course to graduate, ac
cording to an announcement at
yesterday afternoon's Faculty
Senate meeting.
After fierce debates, the Sen
ate approved a proposal by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policy to signifi
cantly alter the General Educa
tion Requirements, popularly
known asGERs. The Senate man
dated that the changes to the core
curriculum will go into effect at
the beginning of the next academ
ic year and will apply to current
students and incoming freshmen.
Current students, however,
will still have the option of using
the old system to accumulate
GERs. As usual, they will be able
to choose between any set of
GER guidelines that have been in
effect since they matriculated.

After much debate, the Facultv
Senate specified new general ed
ucation requirements for next
year.
Under the new policy, Area 2 —
newly entitled Disciplinary Breadth
— will be a combination of current
Areas 2 and 3. Disciplinary Breadth
will be composed of the following
sub-categories: engineering and ap
plied sciences, humanities, mathe
matics. natural sciences and social
sciences. Students will have to take
one course in each sub-category.
What is now known as Area 4 will
be called Area 3: Education for Citi
zenship. Current Area 4 sub-cate
gories World Cultures. American
Cultures and Gender Studies will be
maintained, and sub-category Ethi
cal Reasoning will be added. A mini
mum of two courses in Area 3 will be
required, and the courses must be in
two separate sub-categories.
Notably, the title of sub-category

World Cultures will change to The
Global Community as requested by
the Department of Cultural and So
cial Anthropology. CAS A faculty
members believe that the previous
name was constraining and perpetu
ated a dichotomous understanding of
"the West" and"the Other."
Various Stanford professors say
they are enthusiastic about the addi
tion of the Ethical Reasoning sub
category, claiming that it fills a prob
lematic gap in the current Area 4 re
quirement.
"This new sub-area is intended to
help make students aware of how
pervasive ethical reasoning and
value judgments are throughout the
curriculum." said Philosophy Prof.
Chris Bobonich. "We wanted to
pitch the old requirements in a
broader context so that students
could see why they're required and
also to add something to Area 4 that
was missing."
Ethical Reasoning was not added
to\he policy without opposition. En

glish Prof. Paula Moya was con
cerned, for instance, that the pres
ence of the new sub-category could
take away from students' under
standing of the interaction between
people of different race, ethnicity
and gender because of the often ab
stract and theoretical nature of
ethics.
"Ethical Reasoning should not be
there," Moya said. "It allows stu
dents to go through their Stanford ca
reer and not take courses that focus
on human diversity."
Bobonich refuted this claim.
"It will not be possible to just take
an Ethical Reasoning Course and not
take a course in the one of the other
three areas," he said. He also argued
that ethics studies do successfully ad
dress the role of diversity in interac
tion.
In addition to haggling over this
Area 4 issue, some faculty members
disputed changing the GER system
at all because there will be a larger re
view of the academic system in two

years.
"Should we tinker with GERs
now, two years before there's a re
view when we can look at the total
picture?" asked History Prof. Albert
Camarillo. "Maybe it makes more
sense to postpone it and incorporate
it into the longer review."
Students who want to take as few
courses as possible to graduate —
ten instead of the eleven required
under the current system — will like
ly be glad that the faculty members
in support of the changes came out of
the debate victorious.
"I think this change is such a good
change," said University Provost
John Etcheniendy, a professor of
philosophy, whose excitement about
the future GER policy might rival
that of slothful students. "I can't wait
to tell my new crop of freshman ad
visees that these are the new GERs
and why."
Beginning next year, Stanford
students will be required to take
one less course to graduate, ac

gories World Cultures. American
Cultures and Gender Studies will be
maintained, and sub-category Ethi
cal Reasoning will be added. A mini
mum of two courses in Area 3 will be
required, and the courses must be in
two separate sub-categories.

World Cultures will change to The
Global Community as requested by
the Department of Cultural and So
cial Anthropology. CAS A faculty
members believe that the previous
name was constraining and perpetu
ated a dichotomous understanding of
"the West" and"the Other."
Various Stanford professors say
they are enthusiastic about the addi
tion of the Ethical Reasoning sub
category, claiming that it fills a prob
lematic gap in the current Area 4 re
quirement.
"This new sub-area is intended to
help make students aware of how
pervasive ethical reasoning and
value judgments are throughout the
curriculum." said Philosophy Prof.
Chris Bobonich. "We wanted to
pitch the old requirements in a
broader context so that students
could see why they're required and
also to add something to Area 4 that
was missing."
Ethical Reasoning was not added
to\he policy without opposition. En

glish Prof. Paula Moya was con
cerned, for instance, that the pres
ence of the new sub-category could
take away from students' under
standing of the interaction between
people of different race, ethnicity
and gender because of the often ab
stract and theoretical nature of
ethics.
"Ethical Reasoning should not be
there," Moya said. "It allows stu
dents to go through their Stanford ca
reer and not take courses that focus
on human diversity."
Bobonich refuted this claim.
"It will not be possible to just take
an Ethical Reasoning Course and not
take a course in the one of the other
three areas," he said. He also argued
that ethics studies do successfully ad
dress the role of diversity in interac
tion.
In addition to haggling over this
Area 4 issue, some faculty members
disputed changing the GER system
at all because there will be a larger re
view of the academic system in two

years.
"Should we tinker with GERs
now, two years before there's a re
view when we can look at the total
picture?" asked History Prof. Albert
Camarillo. "Maybe it makes more
sense to postpone it and incorporate
it into the longer review."
Students who want to take as few
courses as possible to graduate —
ten instead of the eleven required
under the current system — will like
ly be glad that the faculty members
in support of the changes came out of
the debate victorious.
"I think this change is such a good
change," said University Provost
John Etcheniendy, a professor of
philosophy, whose excitement about
the future GER policy might rival
that of slothful students. "I can't wait
to tell my new crop of freshman ad
visees that these are the new GERs
and why."
Beginning next year, Stanford
students will be required to take
one less course to graduate, ac
cording to an announcement at
yesterday afternoon's Faculty
Senate meeting.
After fierce debates, the Sen
ate approved a proposal by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policy to signifi
cantly alter the General Educa
tion Requirements, popularly
known asGERs. The Senate man
dated that the changes to the core
curriculum will go into effect at
the beginning of the next academ
ic year and will apply to current
students and incoming freshmen.
Current students, however,
will still have the option of using
the old system to accumulate
GERs. As usual, they will be able
to choose between any set of
GER guidelines that have been in
effect since they matriculated.

After much debate, the Facultv
Senate specified new general ed
ucation requirements for next
year.
Under the new policy, Area 2 —
newly entitled Disciplinary Breadth
— will be a combination of current
Areas 2 and 3. Disciplinary Breadth
will be composed of the following
sub-categories: engineering and ap
plied sciences, humanities, mathe
matics. natural sciences and social
sciences. Students will have to take
one course in each sub-category.
What is now known as Area 4 will
be called Area 3: Education for Citi
zenship. Current Area 4 sub-cate
gories World Cultures. American
Cultures and Gender Studies will be
maintained, and sub-category Ethi
cal Reasoning will be added. A mini
mum of two courses in Area 3 will be
required, and the courses must be in
two separate sub-categories.
