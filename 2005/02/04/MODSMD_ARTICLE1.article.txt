# FacSen passes new GER guidelines
## 
### JEFF ERFE KATIE BEARMAN 
Beginning next year, Stanford
students will be required to take
one less course to graduate, ac
cording to an announcement at
yesterday afternoon's Faculty
Senate meeting.
After fierce debates, the Sen
ate approved a proposal by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policy to signifi
cantly alter the General Educa
tion Requirements, popularly
known asGERs. The Senate man
dated that the changes to the core
curriculum will go into effect at
the beginning of the next academ
ic year and will apply to current
students and incoming freshmen.
Current students, however,
will still have the option of using
the old system to accumulate
GERs. As usual, they will be able
to choose between any set of
GER guidelines that have been in
effect since they matriculated.
