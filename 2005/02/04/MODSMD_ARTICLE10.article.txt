On Feb. 4, 1972, the Daily published
an article about the petition sent by
the Stanford University Ombuds
man, Lois Amsterdam, to President
Ric hard Lyman to change the univer
sity's mascot. Below is an excerpt:
"The Indian was adopted as the
Stanford symbol by the Executive
Committee of the Associated Stu
dents around Big Game in 1930.
"In a letter to President Richard
Lyman yesterday. Amsterdam said
Stanford's continued use of the (In
dian) symbol 'brings up to visibility a
painful lack of sensitivity and aware
ness on the part of the University.'
"Her letter accompanied a peti
tion sent to her this week by native
American students asking for an end
to the Indian symbol.
"The petition was singed by 55
native Americans here and charged
that continued use of the symbol
showed 'non-Indian members of the
Stanford Community are not sensi
tive to the 'humanness' of their na
tive American counterparts.'
"Negative reaction to the change
has been very mild. Alumni director
Tom Newell said he had received
only two calls about the change so
far. Earlier this week he predicted
alumni would be 'saddened' and dis
appointed,' but 'not very upset'
about the change.
"Acting Director Bob Young said
I'm not very strong one way or an
other. I realize there's a minority
problem involved.

"Abandonment of the Indian
symbol now appears just about cer
tain."
On Feb. 4,1960, The Daily covered a
story about the mysterious multiple
slashings of bicycle tires by vandals
on campus. Below is an excerpt:
"Thirty-two bicycle tires were
slashed on campus early yesterday
morning according to Stanford Po
lice Chief Gordon Davis. Six of the
damaged bicycles were at the Phi
Sigma Kappa house, and 26 were at
Lagunita Court.
"A student in the Phi Sig house
heard voices outside his window. He
looked out and saw three girls in a
late-model station wagon. He also
heard a man's voice. According to
the student, they appeared intoxicat
ed.
"At the time the student thought
he heard air escaping. He paid no at
tention to it until the next morning,
when he found that six bicycle tires
had been slashed.
"The student told Chief Davis
that when the station wagon left the
Phi Sig house it headed down Lane
Wand then turned up Campus Drive
towards Florence Moore. Davis said
that the tires appear to have been
slashed with knives, and that the two
sets of slashings were apparently
done on the same day."
