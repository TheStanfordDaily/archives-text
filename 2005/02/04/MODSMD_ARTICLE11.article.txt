# Political-party tension is not unusually high, prof. says

### MIMA MOHAMMED DEBASHISH BAKSHI 
Although present-day relations
between Republicans and Democ
rats seem tense, it is not unusually
high, said Public Policy Prof. David
Brady at the Bursting the Bubble
panel discussion on Wednesday
night.
The event, entitled, "A Nation
Divided?" also featured Dick
Meyer, a political producer for CBS,
and John McManus, director of
GradetheNews.org, a media watch
dog site.
"Most Americans describe them
selves as moderates," Brady said,
pointing to statistical data he collect
ed with Political Science Prof. Mor
ris Fiorina from various surveys and
sources.
He stressed that when the party
hostility that has recently been
making headlines is placed in his
torical context, it is clear that
America is not nearly as divided as
it has been at other times during the
20th century.
The data collected by Brady and
Fiorina also highlighted terrorism
and the war in Iraq as the two most
important issues for voters in the
2004 presidential election.
"Facts of moral issues are the
least significant of all," Brady said.
One survey Brady cited found
the average American to be politi
cally centrist, but also showed that
people perceive the two major par
ties to be on far opposite ends of the
political spectrum.
"Among the party elites, there is
a polarization, but among the mass
es there is no polarization," Brady
said.
Meyer, a visiting Hoover Media
Fellow and editorial director of CB
SNews.com. provided a more quali
tative analysis of the political cli
mate.
"The culture of American poli
tics has changed . . . but 1 can't
prove it with a chart," he said.
Meyer explained that the atmos
phere in the U.S. Senate has grown
increasingly bitter. Friendships and
alliances between Senators are a
thing of the past, he said, which
might account for the obvious lack
of cooperation in Congress.
Though Meyer agreed nominally
with Brady and Fiorina's conclusion
that Americans are more moderate
and unified than they appear, he of
fered his own perspective on the po
larization.
"The us versus them-ism held by
many Americans is corroding the ci
vility of politics," Meyer said.
He said he laments the fact that
Americans have become more iso
lated, alienated and detached from
their neighborhoods and other tra
ditional community groups.
McManus, the author of "Market-
Driven Journalism: Let the Citizen
Beware?" spoke last and analyzed
the ways in which the modern media
conveys political news.
He cited a study conducted by his
Web site, which showed that the
Bay Area station KPIX Channel 5
only dedicated 24 seconds per night
to crucial ballot issues two weeks
prior to last March's primaries. He
said he fears that more news sta
tions are simply airing partisan ads
to convey political information to
the public.
