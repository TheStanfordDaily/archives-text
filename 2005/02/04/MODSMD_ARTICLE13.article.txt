# Touching Tongues
## Here's lookin' at you, guy who won't stop e-mailing 
### 
In our very last column for The
Stanford Daily we'd like to
take a little time to clear
something up: At the end of
each week, when we make some
inane statement and then say,
"Shove it. Or e-mail us," you can
pretty much disregard the second
half of that statement.
Apparently though, you take
those parting words literally, and
over the weeks we've had a wide
range of responses to our dabblings
in the business of entertaining our
selves.

Some
praised us
for our can
dor. Some
told us that
we were
going to hell
and when we
got there,
we'd have to
sit next to
Mussolini or
possibly
Hernando
Cortes. And
some pushed
the bound-

Aries of awkward interaction. So
now we'll share with you some of
the misery that has clogged our e
mail inboxes for the past few
months.
We don't even need to tell you
about the hate e-mail, because they
were printed in Letters to the
Editor section of The Daily. Fora
minute we were chagrined, but then
we just felt famous. No seriously,
having a discriminating fan base
has moved us up a few rungs on the
ladder of egomania â€” and we
thank you for that.
For the record we're not "xeno
phobic." We just hate people who
don't look like us (oh come on now,
if you're still taking us seriously at
this point, call us and we'll wrench
that stick out of your ass).
People have also sent e-mail to
hit on us. These were even better
than people likening us to Der
Fuhrer. We'd write a column about
how socially dysfunctional the
Stanford dating scene was, and just
to prove our point, you'd send us a
link to your "pic" on Craigslist. You
know the one where you look like
you photoshopped yourself in front
of a Tahitian sunset.
Even better is when you recog
nize us in public and try to hit on us.
For instance, the other evening, a
large, swarthy gentleman wouldn't
stop saying, "Don't you want to go to
the baaahrrrrs?" to Mary. She
smiled and tried to get past him, but
he kept leaning forward and saying it
again and again. Eventually he
changed tacks with, "Don't you want
to go to the baaahrrs? You write the
bars." And she got the picture.
Speaking of pictures, it's worth
mentioning that Erin looks nothing
like herself in the picture in our col
umn; rather, she looks constipated
and inexplicably pleased with her
self about it. Thus the whole phe
nomenon of being recognized in
real life is only a problem for Mary.
In contrast, Erin's fans are usu
ally parents. That's right, Erin's got
the over-5() fan base all wrapped
up, and no, it's not awkward to dis
cuss her rampant alcoholism and
deviant sexual behavior with
Mommies and Daddies. She finds
that their advanced years allow
them to bring a lot of experienced
perspectives to the table.
And with that we leave you.
We've had fun pissing you off and
occasionally making your profes
sors feel witty when you let a few
column-induced chucks fly during
lecture.
Parting advice: Try to talk to
each other less awkwardly every
once in a while, and maybe give
that mirror a few more glances
each morning. Oh, and please try
to forget our e-mail addresses.

If you really need to e-mail us, for
instance, in a life-or-death situation,
vou may do so at fuckoff@stan
ford.edu. When that bounces, try
mhstone@stanford.edu or lash
nits@stanford. edu.
