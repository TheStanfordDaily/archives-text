## Non-starters speak out on what motivates them 
### EMMA VAUGHN STAFF WRITER 
At some point during their career at Stanford, many stu
dents dream about being a part of the Stanford basketball
team.
The fame and exposure combined with the uncondition
al support of an obsessive fan base seems like the ideal way
to spend four years of college. Josh Childress didn't need his
afro to be recognized by every person on campus, and the
name Chris Hernandez has become more familiar than
John Hennessy.
However, the team is composed of more than just a few
famous individuals. There are the "non-starters" who devote
extensive amounts of time and effort to the team, but often
play only three or four minutes during the actual game.
For these players, who do not bask in fame and glory, it
is all about the sport.
"You do it because you want to be as good as you can
be," said sophomore Tim Morris, who is academically ineli
gible to play for the remainder of the quarter. "I have an
ideal picture of where I want to be as a basketball player
and practicing every day motivates me to get to that point,
regardless of game time."
Taj Finger, a freshman who averages about eight minutes
per game, agreed that playing time is not what matters the
most and cited his personal drive as the primary motivation
for his work ethic.
"The desire to be really good is the key motivation,"
Finger said. "I know that I am going to have to go in there
eventually, even if it's just fora few minutes, and when 1 do,
I want to contribute positively to the game."
Finger, like most members of the team, came from a
high school basketball program in which he dominated the
court for four years. Adjusting to the skill and pace of the
Stanford team was something that took time and effort.
"It's a very different game from a mental stand
point," said freshman center Peter Prowitt, who set
four high school records and gained numerous all
state and all-league honors. "You have to learn a vari
ety of new plays and just really think the game. It's
hard coming in accustomed to being the biggest and
strongest guy on the court, and then suddenly be sur
rounded by guys your size."
Some players say that the lack of playing time actually
helps their game. They say it gives them the ability to focus
more on their weaknesses and goals.
"When you have less playing time it allows you to have
extra time to really try and improve yourself," Prowitt

said. "Chris [Hernandez] is at a certain level and he has to
work hard, but I have to work a lot harder to get to that
point."
Fred Washington, a sophomore forward averaging nine
minutes on the floor, believes that motivation is a matter of
loving the game enough.
"It all comes from liking to play," Washington said. "If
you don't enjoy doing it, why do it in the first place? You
know you're going to get your chance at some point."
Head coach Trent Johnson supports this notion. He sees
no discrepancy in the way he motivates the starters versus
the bench.
"There's not much motivation on my part needed,"
Johnson explained, "They all understand that it's a team and
they're every bit as important to our success as anyone else.
They know that they have to be ready and they know their
role."
But what about team dynamic? Do those who get less
court time feel secondary in the team setting?
Johnson argued that there is no hierarchy, as all of the
players know it is in their best interest to encourage and
motivate each and every individual on the team.
"They understand the big picture that this is a team,"
Johnson explained. "There is no hierarchy and you're only
as strong as your weakest link."
* Carlton Weatherby, a junior who has been on the bench
and averaged only 0.9 and 1.6 minutes a game for the last
two years, respectively, agreed with Johnson's assessment of
the strong team dynamic.
"It's really a family atmosphere," Weatherby said. "I
know that sounds corny, but it's true. As long as we win. no
one cares how much they play."
Many of the players on the team could have attended
smaller-name or Ivy League schools, where they would have
had more playing time, but none of them expressed their
regret for choosing Stanford.
For Prowitt, who he is looking to pursue a career in the
NBA, Stanford is the perfect feeder school.
"You get the whole package here," Prowitt said. "There's
only so much college can do for you in terms of sports, but
playing at Stanford will put me in a great position to pursue
basketball after college."
For other players, the academic reputation and prestige
in the professional world the Stanford name carries brought
them to the Farm.
"You're set for the rest of your life," Washington said. "I
get to turn to those players at Arizona or Washington and
be like,' You're going to be working for me.'"
When it comes to public recognition, the bench players

might not get as much, but it is still there.
"It's not the same as it was with Josh or now Chris,"
Weatherbv said. "But people still occasionally come up and
say, 'You play basketball,' and that always feels really good."
Other players have more conspicuous means of being
recognized.
"1 just try and wear as much Stanford basketball gear as
I can so that people will know me," Finger said.

Peter Prowitt, a reserve player, says that adjusting playing
on a team in which he is not the star player took some time,
but that gives him motivation to play harder.
