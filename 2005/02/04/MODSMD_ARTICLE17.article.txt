## Editorial Trustees should heed call for investment transparency 
### 
This week, the ASSU passed a bill pressing the
Board of Trustees to lake steps towards full disclosure
of University investments.
In principle, we agree that the Board of Trustees
should set for itself a goal of full disclosure regarding
the investment decisions of the University's endow
ment fund. Such a move would engender greater ac
countability on the part of the Board of Trustees and
the Stanford Management Company, which manages
the University's financial and real estate assets. Stan
ford should be held to high standards of ethical be
havior, given that the University, as a community of
scholars, is committed to improving humanity. To that
end, the University's endowment can be seen as a
powerful vehicle for social change. Our endowment,
valued by the ASSU at $12.2 billion as of June 2004,
must be managed and administered justly.
Of course, the primary duty of the Board of
Trustees is to increase the size of the endowment, not
to run a charitable organization. However, it is possi
ble to have a healthy return on equity while engaging
in socially responsible investment practices. At the
very least, Stanford should take pains to avoid financ
ing companies that violate human rights, exploit labor
or damage the environment.
However, we feel that a move to full disclosure at
this time might be premature. A policy of full disclo
sure could hurt the University financially in the long
run. Requiring our fund managers to disclose their in
vestment positions would curtail their abilities to
achieve high returns on our investment.
This problem is especially acute with hedge funds
and private equity investment firms, which form ap
proximately 10 percent of Stanford's endowment.
These firms, by the very nature of their investment ac
tivities, require a high degree of autonomy in their in
vestment decisions. These fund managers would be re-

luctant to disclose their investment positions on a reg
ular basis, and might even refuse Stanford's invest
ment capital altogether. As such, lull disclosure would
impair the ability of the Stanford Management Com
pany to make optimal allocations of University assets.
This would put Stanford in a particularly difficult po
sition when investment firms can accept the funds of
other universities and nonprofit organizations under the
501(c)(3) tax code that do not engage in full disclosure.
We applaud the Stanford Coalition for Investment
Disclosure's efforts for greater investment trans
parency and accountability. Nevertheless, Stanford
can take steps toward greater investment responsibil
ity without immediately jeopardizing its endowment.
The University has already established an Adviso
ry Panel for Investment Responsibility, or APIR, a
committee that investigates allegations of socially ir
responsible investment decisions. Currently, APIR is
too far removed from the Stanford Management
Company to influence investment decisions. The
panel should be given more power to scrutinize the in
vestment decisions of the Stanford Management
Company. This could be achieved by having full dis
closure of investments to APIR members on the con
dition of confidentiality.
Stanford should also work with other premier in
stitutions of higher learning toward lull disclosure for
all universities. Such a move would send a strong sig
nal to the nation about the academic world's commit
ment to social responsibility, and prompt other
501 (c)(3) organizations to consider declaring their in
vestment positions as well.
And while moving to full disclosure with other uni
versities would still be a financial risk, it will be much
more difficult for hedge funds and investment firms
to ignore the capital of the nation's academic or non
profit communities.

vestment decisions of the Stanford Management
Company. This could be achieved by having full dis
closure of investments to APIR members on the con
dition of confidentiality.
Stanford should also work with other premier in
stitutions of higher learning toward lull disclosure for
all universities. Such a move would send a strong sig
nal to the nation about the academic world's commit
ment to social responsibility, and prompt other
501 (c)(3) organizations to consider declaring their in
vestment positions as well.
And while moving to full disclosure with other uni
versities would still be a financial risk, it will be much
more difficult for hedge funds and investment firms
to ignore the capital of the nation's academic or non
profit communities.
