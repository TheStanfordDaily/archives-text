## Condoleezza Rice's confirmation gives Stanford nothing to be proud of 
### RACHELLE MARSHALL 
Despite the praise heaped on Con
doleezza Rice by her former Hoover
Institution colleague George P.
Shultz in The Daily ("Senate con
firms Rice; Krasner named director
of policy planning," Jan. 27). Stanford
has nothing to be proud of in Rice's
appointment as secretary of state. For
the past four years she has been a
close adviser and aide to a president
who has plunged the country into
ever deepening debt and endangered
the environment, turned America
into an aggressor nation that is hated
around the world.
Rice played an active role in the
campaign of lies that led this country
into a needless and disastrous war.
She raised false fears of nuclear
war ("We don't want the smoking
gun to be a mushroom cloud") by
claiming, contrary to the Internation
al Atomic Energy Agency, that Iraq
was using imported aluminum tubes
to make nuclear weapons. She gave
her full support to a president who
claimed the right to suspend the Con
stitution and ignore international law
by detaining suspects indefinitely
without trial or access to a lawyer. She
made no public objection to policies
that included broadening the power
of government to spy on its citizens
and the harassment and imprison
ment of people because of their reli
gion or ethnicity.

But even more shameful than
these actions was Kite's participation
in the administration's endorsement
of torture and other prisoner abuse.
George W. Bush's White House
counsel advised that the war on ter
rorism "renders obsolete" the Gene
va Conventions' restrictions on ques
tioning enemy prisoners. Bush's sec
retary of defense Donald Rumsfeld
personally approved such techniques
as hooding, removal of clothing, sleep
deprivation, use of attack dogs and
extended periods in painful positions.
Months before the shocking pic
tures from Abu Ghraib became pub
lic, the Red Cross. Amnesty Interna
tional and other human rights groups
had complained to the administration
about the treatment of prisoners â€”
only to have their reports ignored.
After the pictures appeared, the ad
ministration delayed for months in
releasing documents concerning the
orders given to guards at Abu Ghraib
and other U.S. military prisons.
Rice's role in decisions regarding
the treatment of prisoners was made
clear in a letter she wrote that was re
leased on Jan. 12. Last fall, after the
Senate voted % to 2 to explicitly pro
hibit the use of torture or inhumane
treatment of prisoners by intelligence
officers. Rice sent Congress a letter
expressing White House opposition
to the measure because it "provides
legal protections to foreign prisoners
to which thev are not now entitled."

The restrictions were deleted.
During the recent hearings on
Rice's nomination as secretary of
state, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a
Democrat from Connecticut, asked
her whether or not she considered
forced nudity and simulated drown
ing (in which the prisoner is tied to a
board and repeatedly held under
water) to be torture. Rice replied,
"Senator, the determination of
whether interrogation techniques are
consistent with our international obli
gations and American law are made
by the Justice Department. I don't
want to comment on any specific in
terrogation technique." In other
words. Rice will go along with what
ever abuses the Justice Department
says are legal.
1 realize it is rude and unkind to
criticize someone in the pages of The
Daily, especially a person who is so
widely respected at Stanford. But it is
also important to say loud and clear
that launching an aggressive and dev
astating war in the name of promot
ing freedom is unacceptable, that tor
turing another human being for any
reason is unacceptable.
Instead of praising Rice, we
should hold her accountable for her
support of policies that violate the
rules of civilized society and have
brought shame on America.

Rachelle Marshall is a Stanford resi
dent.
