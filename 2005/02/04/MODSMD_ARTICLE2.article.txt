# Copy center embezzler sentenced to three years
## 
### BONNIE SWIFT 
Peter Trinca, former manager
of the Pulse Copy Center, now
FedEx / Kinko's, was sentenced
yesterday to 3 years instate
prison. Trinca, 54, was arrested in
November after an investigation
revealed that he had embezzled
more than $1.5 million from the
center between 2000 and 2003.
Trinca pled guilty to one felony
count of grand theft after it was re
vealed that under his management
Pulse Copy Center had been rou
tinely inflating the number of
copies on statements, billing de

partments twice for the same job
and charging for copy services that
had not occurred.
The scam was allegedly uncov
ered after complaints from several
people led to an audit and investiga
tion by the Stanford Department of
Public Safety in September. Trinca
resigned shortly after suspicions
began to circulate.
Trinca's sentence mandates that
he be held accountable for repaying
Stanford the full $1.5 million. He
has been in custody since his No
vember arrest.

FedEx / Kinko's replaces the Pulse Copy Center after embezzlement
scandal, for which a former manager was arrested and sentenced.
"He is eligible under his sentence
to spend the next three years in the
California Restitution Center in Los
Angeles, where inmates can repay a
portion of their restitutions by work
ing while incarcerated," said Dale
Lohman, Deputy District Attorney
for Santa Clara County.
Stanford has yet to retrieve any of
the lost moneys, and the Office of
Risk Management has also filed a
claim with the University's theft in
surance carrier.
"The theft was allowed to occur
because of a flaw in the University's
old accounting system." said Laura
Wilson, director of Stanford's De
partment of Public Safety. "This
flaw has been corrected in the new
system."
Apparently, Trinca was motivat
ed to exaggerate the profitability of
Pulse by the prospect of promotion
and an estimated $83,0(X) in financial
incentives from his employer.
College Enterprises, the compa
ny that owned Pulse, received there

maining embezzled profits. Howev
er, there is no evidence that anybody
within College Enterprises was
aware that fraud was taking place,
and Trinca is the sole person who
faced charges following the scandal.
"We believe that he was acting
alone," said Lohman, who empha
sized that College Enterprises had
been very cooperative throughout
the investigation.
The Pulse Copy Center in Tresid
der Memorial Union was closed on
Dec. 17 last year due to the legal ac
tions taken against Trinca. FedEx /
Kinko's has since taken over the op
eration of the space under a short
term contract, and Stanford is cur
rently negotiating a longer term ar
rangement.
One employee at the new
Kinko's said that most of the people
who worked at the copy center
under Pulse management have kept
their positions and that the transi
tion to new ownership as gone
smoothly. In fact, students can now
send packages via FedEx Ground, a
service that was not previously avail
able, as well as receive a Stanford
discount on posters, which are print
ed offsite.
