### BONNIE SWIFT 
Peter Trinca, former manager
of the Pulse Copy Center, now
FedEx / Kinko's, was sentenced
yesterday to 3 years instate
prison. Trinca, 54, was arrested in
November after an investigation
revealed that he had embezzled
more than $1.5 million from the
center between 2000 and 2003.
Trinca pled guilty to one felony
count of grand theft after it was re
vealed that under his management
Pulse Copy Center had been rou
tinely inflating the number of
copies on statements, billing de

partments twice for the same job
and charging for copy services that
had not occurred.
The scam was allegedly uncov
ered after complaints from several
people led to an audit and investiga
tion by the Stanford Department of
Public Safety in September. Trinca
resigned shortly after suspicions
began to circulate.
Trinca's sentence mandates that
he be held accountable for repaying
Stanford the full $1.5 million. He
has been in custody since his No
vember arrest.
