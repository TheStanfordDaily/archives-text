# Irrational Exuberance
## The 						Econ 1 Guide to Life 
### 
Economists have a rather dis
mal reputation for being self
ish, venal egoists, especially
among those who look in from the
outside. With all due respect to the
fact that a little bit of knowledge can
be a dangerous thing, I have always
believed that at least one economics

class should he
part of any proper
liberal education,
and not just be
cause economics
is essential to the
understanding of
government poli
cy. I have recently
come to realize
that economics
can offer a frame
work fora good
and moral life.

In this column, I intend to decon
struct the field of economics to show
the inherently optimistic, essentially
moral underpinnings of neo-classical
economics.
I admit that modern economics is
questioning many of the assumptions
upon which neo-classical economics
has been based. However, the neo
classical framework is still the core of
economic thinking and still has huge
impact on how the profession oper
ates, especially in the gut inclinations
of its practitioners.
Tellingly, economics was be
queathed the derogatory name "the
dismal science" by Thomas Carlyle, a
stout supporter of the institution of
slavery. Carlyle's disgust arose be
cause of the economists' insistence
that market forces of free exchange
were more efficient than the system
of dominance inherent to slavery.
During the civil rights movement,
the Chicago school was known for
maintaining the belief that discrimi
nation is irrational. In fact, since dis
crimination impedes profit maxi
mization, a competitive market
should force all businesses that dis
criminate out of the market. Only im
pediments to competition, such as
those imposed by an intrusive govern
ment, allow discrimination to persist.
Economics, as a whole, tends to as
sume that people are all the same.
Admittedly, they do so because it
makes modeling easier, but it also im
pacts our outlook. Instead of falling
prey to the fundamental attribution
error, we tend to attribute differences
in outcomes not to differences be
tween individuals, but to differences
in circumstances.
As for applications to daily life,
spite is a concept foreign to most
economists. Experiments repeated
around the world in many circum
stances find that people will give up
large amounts of money — up to two
weeks of income — to punish those
they feel have been unfair to them. It

is typical for economists who are un
familiar with this literature to he stu
pefied and incredulous when they
first hear of it, and 1 have no doubt
that none would do such a thing
themselves.
Admittedly, altruism without quid
pro quo is equally foreign to
economists. However, economists are
quick to point out that people are al
ways embedded in relationships, and
that altruism within a relationship
makes perfect rational sense. Further
more, economics also readily accepts
that norms of altruism and trust are
crucial parts of an efficient society.
More prosaically, procrastination
is also labeled as irrational. For any
reasonable discount rate, the cost of
doing something today versus a week
from today is practically the same,
thus there is no rational benefit from
procrastinating.
Recent MRI research by neuro
economics into the neo-cortex of the
brain has shown why occasionally our
more animal side will override our ra
tional planning. I often appeal to my
more rational side when my brain
tells me to read my comic books when
I have a column to finish. It occasion
ally works.
Ideas from welfare economics can
be applied to group decision-making.
Decisions of what movie to see or
which restaurant to meet at can be
evaluated on criteria such as pareto
optimally or social welfare maxi
mization. Similarly, conflicts with
roommates can be thought of as cul
ture clashes arising from mis-coordi
nation. Disagreements can best be re
solved by communication rather than
anger, and a mutually beneficial equi
librium can be found.
Finally, and perhaps most impor
tantly, economists believes there is an
underlying truth to the world. Many so
cial scientists like to agree to disagree.
For me. that's like two engineers agree
ing to disagree on whether a bridge is
going to collapse. One day, there will
be a grand theory of everything that
will explain all human behavior, and
we are working toward that day.
Admittedly, practical me and
post-modernist me concedes that
though such an underlying truth ex
ists, we are eons away from finding it.
Underlying complexities, chaotic
non-linear dynamics, the occasional
Neo or Mule greatly complicate mat
ters. Thus dialogue with the other so
cial sciences, and humanities-thinkers
more attuned to these underlying
complexities, is ever important in pur
suit of this truth.
Even if we never get there, the
pursuit will be one heck of a ride.
