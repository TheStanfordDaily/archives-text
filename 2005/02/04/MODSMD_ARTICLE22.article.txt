'Urine-drenched hands' not
necessarily unclean
It is unfortunate that Priya Jay
achandran chose to propagate a com
mon misperccption in her Thursday
column ("To the Typhoid Marys of
Stanford University," Feb. 3) when
she made a reference to unclean
"urine-drenched hands." In point of
fact, urine is usually sterile. During
battlefield surgery, it has been used as
an antibacterial agent. Washing hands

after urinating is important not he
cause of the content of urine, hut he
cause everyone has virulent bacteria
present on the skin of the genital area,
which most people touch when they
urinate. Correcting this misconcep
tion is important because far too many
people, when cautioned to wash, say,
"Well. I don't pee on my hands!" — as
if that makes any difference.

Dining director should support
workers' rights
Rafi Taherian, the new execu
tive director of Stanford Dining,
promised to focus on "green busi
ness initiatives and sustainability"
and to donate leftover food be
cause "it is unconscionable to
waste food" ("Taherian named ex
ecutive director of Stanford Din
ing," Feb. 1).
I applaud Taherian's stated com

mitment to the social good, but that
promise is empty when he continues
to support Stanford Dining's illegal
violation of its workers' right to or
ganize and its denial of their free
dom of speech.
In October, Susan Hoerger, di
rector of employee and labor rela
tions at Stanford, issued a policy pro
hibiting workers from wearing union
buttons or insignia at work.
This directive is in violation of the
National Labor Relations Act of

1935 and multiple rulings by the Na
tional Labor Relations Board and
the Supreme Court sincc then.
Moreover, it is ludicrous that
Stanford, an institution suppos
edly dedicated to the free ex
change of ideas, should stifle the
freedom of expression of some of
the members of the Stanford
community.
Taherian has upheld the illegal
policy despite repeated student re
quests that he repeal it. Now that he

is officially executive director of
Stanford Dining, he has an opportu
nity to start off on the right foot by
ending Stanford Dining's systemat
ically illegal actions.
If Taherian truly wants to run a
socially responsible business, a good
place to start would be obeying the
law.
