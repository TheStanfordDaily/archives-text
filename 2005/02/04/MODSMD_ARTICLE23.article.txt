## Jeff Dorman Sucks! Picking a Super Bowl winner? It's way easier than waltzing

... to make a long story short, she turns to me
and says,"and that's why crabs can be a bless
ing in disguise!"
Oh. hi there! I didn't see you come in; you sur
prised me! How are you doing? Good? Good.

Well, to business. Because
my life is a mess right now, I
have no coherent story line to
draw out SIX) words, so we're
just going to have to improvise
with little vignettes. Enjoy!
1 caved. I'm sorry every
body, but I went limp in the
face of a woman's pressure.
Oh get your mind out of the
gutter, not Bob Dole limp.
Doug Christie limp.

Walking through White Plaza the other
day. 1 did something I'm not proud of, some
thing I swore I'd never do. something that
made me hate myself.
I bought two tickets to the Viennese Ball.
1 know, I know, I know.
I've made fun of this event for the last
four years, scoffed at the $75 ticket for two
and have been told the only people that go to
this thing also TiVo "The Wayne Brady
Show." But sometimes, you gotta do what
you gotta do, and if the girlfriend has waited
four years to wait/, beside people who laugh
during "Hollywood Squares," sometimes
you have to stop rolling your eyes and just
buy the tickets.
Anyway, so I buy the tickets, but my being
a complete idiot. I don't know the first thing
about Viennese Ball. 1 mean, 1 know I'm
going to stick out like a PoliSci TA at a Nice
People Anonymous convention (side note,
am 1 still bitter that a PoliSci 2 TA wrote that
my midterm paper was "reprehensible"? Yes,
1 am. let's move on). But I'm sorry, I have no
idea how to Viennese Dance at a Viennese
Ball. Hell, I just figured out that Viennese
meant "From Vienna." I thought it had some
thing to do with an ice cream cake.
The point? I'm going to look stupid, but I'm
going to like it. 1 have been told you have to do
this once in your four years here, so I'll keep it
optimistic. I'll keep you guys posted on the re
sult. but it should be fun.
But the Viennese Ball isn't the only Super
thing happening soon (Segue alert!). There is
also the "Super" Bowl! I am a terrible writer.
However, I do know what's going to happen.
The short version? Take the Pats.
The long version? Let's go through the two
teams. With the Eagles on offense, T. 0., even
with God as his trainer, won't make it through
the first quarter. Answer me this: what will
happen to Owens after he catches his first
pass? Where do you think every Patriots play
er will be tackling him? His chest? No way in
Belichick will that happen. Bruschi and Co.
will hit that leg over and over and over again,
inadvertently auditioning for the WWE in the
process.
As for the rest of the Eagles offense, their
wide receivers will be neutralized. Even the
best passing offense in the NFL (that would be
the Colts) were stopped, leaving McNabb and
Westbrook to run for the game. The Eagles
can only hope fora defensive turnover in the
red zone, but I don't see them scoring more
than 10 points.
With the Pats on offense, don't look away,
because they will score fast, and often. Deion
Branch will have a huge game â€” you have my
word. Watch the end-around. Combine this
with Belichick, Bradv and Dillon, and you
