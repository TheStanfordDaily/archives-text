# Diogu spells disaster for Cardinal again
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
TEMPE, Ariz. — The Stanford men's bas
ketball team has certainly figured a lot out since
suffering an 81-69 loss to Arizona State at home
on Jan. 6. But as last night's start to the second
half of the Pacific-10 Conference season showed,
the Cardinal still don't have an answer for Ike
Diogu.
Arizona State's junior center scored a career
high 39 points on 16-for-26 shooting to lead the

ARIZONA ST. 88
STANFORD 69

Sun Devils to a 74-
67 win over Stan
ford at Wells Fargo
Arena, snapping

Stanford's six-game winning streak.
Diogu also grabbed 11 rebounds for his
conference-leading 12th double-double and
played all 40 minutes for Arizona State (16-6,
5-5 Pac-10), which broke a nine-game losing
streak to Stanford at home and swept the sea
son series for the first time since the 1993-1994
season.
After trailing by as many as 10 in the second
half, Stanford closed to within four on Nick
Robinson's lay-up with 36 seconds left, but Ari
zona Slate sophomore Kevin Kruger sank a pair
of free throws on the other end and junior Jason
Haas dribbled the ball off his leg and out of
bounds to ice the game.
The Cardinal opted not to double team Diogu
as often as they did during the teams' first meet
ing, when he hit his first six shots en route to a
game-high 28 points in the Sun Devils' 81-69 win
at Maples Pavilion. Senior center Rob Little was
matched up against Diogu for most of the first
half, while junior Matt Haryasz took over in the
second. Both were equally unsuccessful. ,
"It's hard to guard him, especially when he's
knocking his shots down," said Little, who fin
ished with six points and 14 rebounds. "He had a
good performance; you have to give him all the
credit."
Only half joking, head coach Trent Johnson
said earlier this week that Stanford might need
the services of Shaquille O'Neal to stop Diogu,
the Pac-10's leading scorer and rebounder. But
could Little and Haryasz have combined forces
to at least contain him?
"Ike Diogu is one of the best players in the
country," Johnson said. "It's hard to sit up here
and say we want to rotate and double-team with
two posts. What [Arizona State] does offensive
ly doesn't allow you to rotate and double-team

with two posts."
Diogu was a one-man wrecking crew for most
of the night, however, scoring 19 points in the
first half to help Arizona State to a 27-25 lead.
Kruger was the only other Sun Devil to finish in
double digits with 15 points.
"I guess you have to pick your poison, but I
think that's giving us a lot of credit," said
Kruger of Stanford's decision not to double
team Diogu.
Arizona State stretched its lead to 10 three
minutes into the second half, after Diogu drained
a fadeaway to cap a 10-2 run that included a pair
of three-pointers from Steve Moore and Bryson
Krueger.
Johnson said he felt the momentum shifted
earlier.
"The key to the game, from where I was sit
ting, was when Chris Hernandez, who is an All
Pac-10 performer, got two fouls in the first half
and I had to take him out," Johnson said. "Nick
Robinson, who is the glue to our group, got two
fouls and I had to take him out."
Hernandez, who did not play in the teams' last
meeting due to back spasms, scored 12 points
and dished out three assists, but never took con
trol of the game. He scored just four points after
his three-pointer with 10:38 to play and nar
rowed the Arizona State lead to 48-44.
With junior guard Dan Grunfeld struggling
from the field. Robinson stepped up with a sea
son-high 17 points in 28 minutes.
Early on, Stanford looked as if it would
breeze to a seventh straight win, building a 13-4
lead by the time the first substitutions entered
the game at the 13:26 mark of the first half.
But Diogu would score 17 of the Sun Devils'
next 23 points. He dunked, hit fadeaways and
drained all six of his free throw attempts.
While he credited Diogu, Haryasz felt Stan
ford let one slip away.
"We had way too many unforced turnovers,"
said Haryasz, who finished with 14 points and 10
rebounds. "They played pretty good defense, but
a lot of it was just passing the ball out of bounds,
not being able to catch it and traveling."
Stanford finished with 20 turnovers, including
14 in the first half.
"It stings to lose, but we have to come back
and play hard," Haryasz said. "We have a tough
one on Saturday and we have to put this one be
hind us and keep marching forward."
Stanford will take on Arizona at 10 a.m. PST
on Saturday at the McKale Center, where the
Cardinal have won four straight.

a lot of it was just passing the ball out of bounds,
not being able to catch it and traveling."
Stanford finished with 20 turnovers, including
14 in the first half.
"It stings to lose, but we have to come back
and play hard," Haryasz said. "We have a tough
one on Saturday and we have to put this one be
hind us and keep marching forward."
Stanford will take on Arizona at 10 a.m. PST
on Saturday at the McKale Center, where the
Cardinal have won four straight.

Junior Dan Grunfeld struggled with his usually precise shooting in Stanford's
second loss of the season to the Sun Devils.
TEMPE, Ariz. — The Stanford men's bas
ketball team has certainly figured a lot out since
suffering an 81-69 loss to Arizona State at home
on Jan. 6. But as last night's start to the second
half of the Pacific-10 Conference season showed,
the Cardinal still don't have an answer for Ike
Diogu.
Arizona State's junior center scored a career
high 39 points on 16-for-26 shooting to lead the

ARIZONA ST. 88
STANFORD 69

Sun Devils to a 74-
67 win over Stan
ford at Wells Fargo
Arena, snapping

Stanford's six-game winning streak.
Diogu also grabbed 11 rebounds for his
conference-leading 12th double-double and
played all 40 minutes for Arizona State (16-6,
5-5 Pac-10), which broke a nine-game losing
streak to Stanford at home and swept the sea
son series for the first time since the 1993-1994
season.
After trailing by as many as 10 in the second
half, Stanford closed to within four on Nick
Robinson's lay-up with 36 seconds left, but Ari
zona Slate sophomore Kevin Kruger sank a pair
of free throws on the other end and junior Jason
Haas dribbled the ball off his leg and out of
bounds to ice the game.
The Cardinal opted not to double team Diogu
as often as they did during the teams' first meet
ing, when he hit his first six shots en route to a
game-high 28 points in the Sun Devils' 81-69 win
at Maples Pavilion. Senior center Rob Little was
matched up against Diogu for most of the first
half, while junior Matt Haryasz took over in the
second. Both were equally unsuccessful. ,
"It's hard to guard him, especially when he's
knocking his shots down," said Little, who fin
ished with six points and 14 rebounds. "He had a
good performance; you have to give him all the
credit."
Only half joking, head coach Trent Johnson
said earlier this week that Stanford might need
the services of Shaquille O'Neal to stop Diogu,
the Pac-10's leading scorer and rebounder. But
could Little and Haryasz have combined forces
to at least contain him?
"Ike Diogu is one of the best players in the
country," Johnson said. "It's hard to sit up here
and say we want to rotate and double-team with
two posts. What [Arizona State] does offensive
ly doesn't allow you to rotate and double-team

with two posts."
Diogu was a one-man wrecking crew for most
of the night, however, scoring 19 points in the
first half to help Arizona State to a 27-25 lead.
Kruger was the only other Sun Devil to finish in
double digits with 15 points.
"I guess you have to pick your poison, but I
think that's giving us a lot of credit," said
Kruger of Stanford's decision not to double
team Diogu.
Arizona State stretched its lead to 10 three
minutes into the second half, after Diogu drained
a fadeaway to cap a 10-2 run that included a pair
of three-pointers from Steve Moore and Bryson
Krueger.
Johnson said he felt the momentum shifted
earlier.
"The key to the game, from where I was sit
ting, was when Chris Hernandez, who is an All
Pac-10 performer, got two fouls in the first half
and I had to take him out," Johnson said. "Nick
Robinson, who is the glue to our group, got two
fouls and I had to take him out."
Hernandez, who did not play in the teams' last
meeting due to back spasms, scored 12 points
and dished out three assists, but never took con
trol of the game. He scored just four points after
his three-pointer with 10:38 to play and nar
rowed the Arizona State lead to 48-44.
With junior guard Dan Grunfeld struggling
from the field. Robinson stepped up with a sea
son-high 17 points in 28 minutes.
Early on, Stanford looked as if it would
breeze to a seventh straight win, building a 13-4
lead by the time the first substitutions entered
the game at the 13:26 mark of the first half.
But Diogu would score 17 of the Sun Devils'
next 23 points. He dunked, hit fadeaways and
drained all six of his free throw attempts.
While he credited Diogu, Haryasz felt Stan
ford let one slip away.
"We had way too many unforced turnovers,"
said Haryasz, who finished with 14 points and 10
rebounds. "They played pretty good defense, but
a lot of it was just passing the ball out of bounds,
not being able to catch it and traveling."
Stanford finished with 20 turnovers, including
14 in the first half.
"It stings to lose, but we have to come back
and play hard," Haryasz said. "We have a tough
one on Saturday and we have to put this one be
