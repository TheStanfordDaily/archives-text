# Stanford out-hustles depleted Arizona squad
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The game may have been over as soon as the starting
lineups were read and Arizona's Dee-Dee Wheeler was
not announced. No. 4 Stanford (20-2, 11-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference) trounced Arizona 91-74 last night, as the Wildcats
played the first half without their star All-Conference point
guard.
Though few teams in the Pacific-10 Conference can
match the Cardinal's offensive weapons from both the

paint and perimeter, the
Wildcats' tandem of junior
center Shawntinice Polk
and Wheeler may come the
closest.

ARIZONA 74

Yet, after violating team rules, neither player started the
game. Though Polk quickly entered the game, Arizona ap
peared lost without Wheeler's court leadership, turning the
ball over 18 times before she entered the game to start the
second half.
Nonetheless, Arizona head coach Joan Bonvicini stood
by her decision to hold Wheeler out.
"It's a lot more than just basketball," Bonvicini said.
"I'm trying to teach life lessons. Sometimes those lessons
are difficult."
Arizona (15-7, 7-4) entered last night's game in third
place in the Pac-10, coming off a tough 84-77 overtime loss
to No. 20 Maryland.
Without the threat of Wheeler's ball handling or

perimeter shooting, the Cardinal defense was free to col
lapse on Polk and senior Danielle Adefeso when the ball
came inside. Passing lanes were constantly clogged, and an
opportunistic Stanford team created an incredible 13 steals
in the first half. For the season, the Cardinal is averaging
10.4 steals per game.
"[Wheeler's absence] had a huge impact on what hap
pened," Polk said. "Stanford went on a run, and that's
when usually everybody looks for Dee-Dee to step up."
For portions of the game, the Cardinal appeared to be
running layup drills, as their guards sprinted out on fast
break after fast break. Noise levels within Maples may have
been at their highest since the renovation when freshman
Candice Wiggins collected the hoop and the harm on a one
on-one play with 4:06 remaining in the first half.
"It's great to play with Candice," Stanford's Susan King
Borchardt said. "There's a lot of speed on the floor, and
we're starting to click."
The favorite for Pac-10 Freshman of the Year. Wiggins
avoided foul trouble for the first time in several games and
played 30 minutes. She collected four steals and finished
with 20 points on 7-of-l 1 shooting to lead Stanford.
With the return of sophomore forward Shannon Hob
son from a sprained MCL, Arizona tried to make up for the
lack of a dependable perimeter game by challenging Stan
ford to a physical battle inside.
Their post play was one of the few bright spots for the
Wildcats, as they provided a whopping 36-29 edge on the
boards for the game. Polk led her team with 22 points.
Meanwhile, Arizona forced Stanford's inside trio of

T'Nae Thiel, Brooke Smith and Kristen Newlin to consis
tently kick the ball out to the perimeter.
Unfortunately for Arizona, this was a hollow victory.
The Cardinal's long-range shooting was solid; the team
shot 7-of-l8 from beyond the arc. Tallying 17 points on the
night. Borchardt led the way, going 3-for-4 from the
perimeter.
Wheeler's return after intermission was small consola
tion for the Wildcats, who already trailed 4tv24 at the half
and were unable to gain any momentum against the Cardi
nal's relentless defensive pressure.
Stanford's 16 steals for the game fail to tell the story of a
defense that dove for loose balls, hassled ball handlers and
generally out-hustled its opponent. The night was epito
mized when senior Kelley Suminksi stopped a second-half
two-on-one Arizona fast-break, with the ball returning to
Stanford as it glanced off one of the Wildcats.
The game was extremely physical from the opening tip,
and both teams racked up 10 fouls in the second half —
Arizona less than halfway through the period. The Cardi
nal got to the line for 31 free throws in the game.
"There are teams that are talented, there are teams that
win, and there are special teams," VanDerveer said. "With
this team, for me. it's obvious that we have some special
chemistry."
Before the game, Cissy Pierce was added to the growing
list of the Cardinal's wounded. Having dislocated two fin
gers on her right hand in practice, Pierce underwent x-rays
that were negative and was unavailable for the game. Her
recovery is expected to take two weeks.

defense that dove for loose balls, hassled ball handlers and
generally out-hustled its opponent. The night was epito
mized when senior Kelley Suminksi stopped a second-half
two-on-one Arizona fast-break, with the ball returning to
Stanford as it glanced off one of the Wildcats.
The game was extremely physical from the opening tip,
and both teams racked up 10 fouls in the second half —
Arizona less than halfway through the period. The Cardi
nal got to the line for 31 free throws in the game.
"There are teams that are talented, there are teams that
win, and there are special teams," VanDerveer said. "With
this team, for me. it's obvious that we have some special
chemistry."
Before the game, Cissy Pierce was added to the growing
list of the Cardinal's wounded. Having dislocated two fin
gers on her right hand in practice, Pierce underwent x-rays
that were negative and was unavailable for the game. Her
recovery is expected to take two weeks.
The game may have been over as soon as the starting
lineups were read and Arizona's Dee-Dee Wheeler was
not announced. No. 4 Stanford (20-2, 11-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference) trounced Arizona 91-74 last night, as the Wildcats
played the first half without their star All-Conference point
guard.
Though few teams in the Pacific-10 Conference can
match the Cardinal's offensive weapons from both the

paint and perimeter, the
Wildcats' tandem of junior
center Shawntinice Polk
and Wheeler may come the
closest.

ARIZONA 74

Yet, after violating team rules, neither player started the
game. Though Polk quickly entered the game, Arizona ap
peared lost without Wheeler's court leadership, turning the
ball over 18 times before she entered the game to start the
second half.
Nonetheless, Arizona head coach Joan Bonvicini stood
by her decision to hold Wheeler out.
"It's a lot more than just basketball," Bonvicini said.
"I'm trying to teach life lessons. Sometimes those lessons
are difficult."
Arizona (15-7, 7-4) entered last night's game in third
place in the Pac-10, coming off a tough 84-77 overtime loss
to No. 20 Maryland.
Without the threat of Wheeler's ball handling or

perimeter shooting, the Cardinal defense was free to col
lapse on Polk and senior Danielle Adefeso when the ball
came inside. Passing lanes were constantly clogged, and an
opportunistic Stanford team created an incredible 13 steals
in the first half. For the season, the Cardinal is averaging
10.4 steals per game.
"[Wheeler's absence] had a huge impact on what hap
pened," Polk said. "Stanford went on a run, and that's
when usually everybody looks for Dee-Dee to step up."
For portions of the game, the Cardinal appeared to be
running layup drills, as their guards sprinted out on fast
break after fast break. Noise levels within Maples may have
been at their highest since the renovation when freshman
Candice Wiggins collected the hoop and the harm on a one
on-one play with 4:06 remaining in the first half.
"It's great to play with Candice," Stanford's Susan King
Borchardt said. "There's a lot of speed on the floor, and
we're starting to click."
The favorite for Pac-10 Freshman of the Year. Wiggins
avoided foul trouble for the first time in several games and
played 30 minutes. She collected four steals and finished
with 20 points on 7-of-l 1 shooting to lead Stanford.
With the return of sophomore forward Shannon Hob
son from a sprained MCL, Arizona tried to make up for the
lack of a dependable perimeter game by challenging Stan
ford to a physical battle inside.
Their post play was one of the few bright spots for the
Wildcats, as they provided a whopping 36-29 edge on the
boards for the game. Polk led her team with 22 points.
Meanwhile, Arizona forced Stanford's inside trio of

T'Nae Thiel, Brooke Smith and Kristen Newlin to consis
tently kick the ball out to the perimeter.
Unfortunately for Arizona, this was a hollow victory.
The Cardinal's long-range shooting was solid; the team
shot 7-of-l8 from beyond the arc. Tallying 17 points on the
night. Borchardt led the way, going 3-for-4 from the
perimeter.
Wheeler's return after intermission was small consola
tion for the Wildcats, who already trailed 4tv24 at the half
and were unable to gain any momentum against the Cardi
nal's relentless defensive pressure.
Stanford's 16 steals for the game fail to tell the story of a
defense that dove for loose balls, hassled ball handlers and
generally out-hustled its opponent. The night was epito
