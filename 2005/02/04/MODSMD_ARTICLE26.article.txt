# Card take on defending champion CSU-Fullerton
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Rumor has it that California governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger will throw out the first pitch tonight to
open the No. 6 Cardinal's three-game set against No. 3
Cal State-Fullerton at Goodwin Field. It is only fitting
that the former Mr. Universe and legendary strongman
open the first round between the two college baseball
heavyweights, because, by all accounts, it should be an
other classic bout.
In one corner you have the Cardinal (3-0), two-time
NCAA Champions in 1987 and 1988, with 10 consecu
tive 40-win seasons under their belt.
In the other corner, the Titans, who have taken
home four NCAA titles — including last season's —
have not missed the playoffs since 1991, the fifth
longest streak in the nation.
When 160 NCAA Division I coaches were asked
who they thought would come home with the NCAA
title this year, Fullerton finished second and Stanford
came in third, just one vote behind. Texas received the
most votes.
Stanford sabotaged the Titans' 2003 season by beat
ing them in two straight games in the College World Se
ries. The Cardinal have claimed six of the last seven sea
son series, and are one of only two teams in collegiate
baseball to boast a winning record against the Titans.
The way this matchup has been hyped, you would
think that a championship hangs in the balance. Then
you realize that we're only four days into February and

Omaha is still just another city in Nebraska.
"It's a measuring stick: that's why we play them," said
Cardinal head coach Mark Marquess. "We'll be able to
find out where we're weak or lacking over the next three
weekends, when we play two of the top three teams in
the country, the other one being Texas."
Stanford swept last year's series against Fullerton,
the season opener for both teams, in which the Cardi
nal outscored the Titans, 28-11. It was a measuring stick
— the Cardinal would hold the No. 1 ranking for much
of the rest of the season, while the Titans would go on
to lose 16 of their first 31 games — but it was not an in
dicator of the final result. Stanford bowed out in the
Regional, while Fullerton won 32 of its last 38 games on
its way to the national championship.
This season, while the Cardinal restock with five
new starting position players, the Titans merely reload.
Six of the eight starting position players from last year's
team return.
"They have good pitching, a good nucleus," Mar
quess said. "If you don't play well, you'll get beat, but
the scary thing is that even if you do play well you could
get beat, too."
The matchup on :he mound tonight will pit two USA
National team members against each other — Fullerton
junior Ricky Romero (14-4 last season with a 3.37 earned
run average) and Stanford junior Mark Romanczuk,
owner of a 12-2 mark last year to go with a 4.01 ERA.
"I've seen (Romero] pitch," said fellow National
team member and Cardinal second baseman Jed
Lowrie. "He has great stuff. He's one of the best pitchers

in the nation. But we'll get after him, just like anybody
else, and our staff will keep runs off the hoard."
That is just what Stanford was able to do against
Fresno State in the team's first series of the year when
it outscored the Bulldogs, 27-5.
Though this year's team is not the offensive jugger
naut it was last season, the Cardinal showed that they
can still pack a punch, hitting .324 with five home runs,
three of them courtesy of Lowrie.
The Cardinal will start junior Jeff Gilmore. who
pitched six scoreless innings against Fresno State, on
Saturday. He will match up with Fullerton's Ryan
Schreppel, who didn't escape the first inning of last
year's series opener against Stanford after being
roughed up for six runs and recording only one out.
Sophomore Greg Reynolds will get the start for the
Cardinal on Sunday. He allowed three runs and eight hits
in 3 1 / 3 innings in a start last Sunday, striking out five.
Though the series might not have anything to do
with Stanford's hopes of winning a College World Se
ries, it will still feel like a title fight.
"1 think [the atmosphere at Fullerton] is only matched
by Texas," Lowrie said. "Their fans are all over you, es
pecially with this big of a rivalry'early in the season."
Stanford is ready for the early challenge.
"We're excited for that," Romanczuk said. "Defi
nitely. They're the national champs, they're a top-five
team this year. I wouldn't say we get up more for this
game, because coach Marquess has us get up for every
game, but this is more exciting than most. More fans are
going to be there. It's going to be a lot of fun."

find out where we're weak or lacking over the next three
weekends, when we play two of the top three teams in
the country, the other one being Texas."
Stanford swept last year's series against Fullerton,
the season opener for both teams, in which the Cardi
nal outscored the Titans, 28-11. It was a measuring stick
— the Cardinal would hold the No. 1 ranking for much
of the rest of the season, while the Titans would go on
to lose 16 of their first 31 games — but it was not an in
dicator of the final result. Stanford bowed out in the
Regional, while Fullerton won 32 of its last 38 games on
its way to the national championship.
This season, while the Cardinal restock with five
new starting position players, the Titans merely reload.
Six of the eight starting position players from last year's
team return.
"They have good pitching, a good nucleus," Mar
quess said. "If you don't play well, you'll get beat, but
the scary thing is that even if you do play well you could
get beat, too."
The matchup on :he mound tonight will pit two USA
National team members against each other — Fullerton
junior Ricky Romero (14-4 last season with a 3.37 earned
run average) and Stanford junior Mark Romanczuk,
owner of a 12-2 mark last year to go with a 4.01 ERA.
"I've seen (Romero] pitch," said fellow National
team member and Cardinal second baseman Jed
Lowrie. "He has great stuff. He's one of the best pitchers

in the nation. But we'll get after him, just like anybody
else, and our staff will keep runs off the hoard."
That is just what Stanford was able to do against
Fresno State in the team's first series of the year when
it outscored the Bulldogs, 27-5.
Though this year's team is not the offensive jugger
naut it was last season, the Cardinal showed that they
can still pack a punch, hitting .324 with five home runs,
three of them courtesy of Lowrie.
The Cardinal will start junior Jeff Gilmore. who
pitched six scoreless innings against Fresno State, on
Saturday. He will match up with Fullerton's Ryan
Schreppel, who didn't escape the first inning of last
year's series opener against Stanford after being
roughed up for six runs and recording only one out.
Sophomore Greg Reynolds will get the start for the
Cardinal on Sunday. He allowed three runs and eight hits
in 3 1 / 3 innings in a start last Sunday, striking out five.
Though the series might not have anything to do
with Stanford's hopes of winning a College World Se
ries, it will still feel like a title fight.
"1 think [the atmosphere at Fullerton] is only matched
by Texas," Lowrie said. "Their fans are all over you, es
pecially with this big of a rivalry'early in the season."
Stanford is ready for the early challenge.
"We're excited for that," Romanczuk said. "Defi
nitely. They're the national champs, they're a top-five
team this year. I wouldn't say we get up more for this
game, because coach Marquess has us get up for every
game, but this is more exciting than most. More fans are
going to be there. It's going to be a lot of fun."

Freshman Nolan Gallagher and the Cardinal pitching staff
will get an early test against one of the nation's top teams.
Rumor has it that California governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger will throw out the first pitch tonight to
open the No. 6 Cardinal's three-game set against No. 3
Cal State-Fullerton at Goodwin Field. It is only fitting
that the former Mr. Universe and legendary strongman
open the first round between the two college baseball
heavyweights, because, by all accounts, it should be an
other classic bout.
In one corner you have the Cardinal (3-0), two-time
NCAA Champions in 1987 and 1988, with 10 consecu
tive 40-win seasons under their belt.
In the other corner, the Titans, who have taken
home four NCAA titles — including last season's —
have not missed the playoffs since 1991, the fifth
longest streak in the nation.
When 160 NCAA Division I coaches were asked
who they thought would come home with the NCAA
title this year, Fullerton finished second and Stanford
came in third, just one vote behind. Texas received the
most votes.
Stanford sabotaged the Titans' 2003 season by beat
ing them in two straight games in the College World Se
ries. The Cardinal have claimed six of the last seven sea
son series, and are one of only two teams in collegiate
baseball to boast a winning record against the Titans.
The way this matchup has been hyped, you would
think that a championship hangs in the balance. Then
you realize that we're only four days into February and

Omaha is still just another city in Nebraska.
