# Men play host with a little help from the Bryan bros
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Picture this: the sun beating down on
the courts and a refreshing breeze in the
air. Hands have been shaken and the
match is over, yet the stands are filled with
eager fans, waiting for more tennis.
Most likely, this will be the setting to
morrow after the No. 7 Stanford men's ten
nis team (1-0) competes against No. 58
Fresno State in the Cardinal's second at
home battle of the season.
After the Cardinal finish playing these
two teams, some of the players will face
even tougher opponents on Saturday after
noon. Bob and Mike Bryan will be helping
kick off the Cardinal's tennis season with
an exhibition match against the defending
NCAA doubles Champions, senior Sam
Warburg and junior KC Corkery. The
Bryan twins are former NCAA Champi
ons and a two-time, international top
ranked doubles team.
The Bryan brothers attended Stanford
from 1996-98 before turning pro. Since
then. Bob and Mike have won over 20 titles
on the ATP tour including the 2(X)3 French
Open. The brothers have also had success
in mixed doubles, with both winning two
grand slam mixed doubles titles. Most re
cently, the duo was also successful at this
year's Australian Open, where they ad
vanced to the finals before falling to Zim
babwe's Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett.
"We're really excited that they're com
ing back to welcome John's weekend debut
as head coach," tennis director Dick Gould
said of new coach John Whitinger. "That
shows how much the players who played
for John respect him and that they would
come all the way up here to do that in the
middle of a very busy schedule."
Before Warburg and Corkery can start
thinking about the Stanford show-down,
they, along with the rest of the team, must
focus on what lies ahead: San Diego's
Toreros today, followed by Fresno State's
Bulldogs tomorrow. The home opener will
be today against No. 44 San Diego, starting
at 1:30 p.m.
Stanford and San Diego have not met
since the 2002 season and the Toreros are
ranked significantly lower than last week's
Golden Bears. However, the team's ranking
is by no means an indication of an easy match,
and Stanford will have to work to earn the
four points it needs to garner the "W."
"I don't want the guys just looking at
(San Diego's] ranking because I think
they're better than that," head coach John
Whitlinger said. "You can't take anybody

lightly."
Look fora possible matchup between
Stanford's No. 4 Warburg and San Diego's
top player, junior Pierrick Ysern. a lefty
who is ranked fifth in the ITA singles poll.
Today's meeting will be the opening match
of the season for San Diego, as last week's
match against BYU was rained out with
the Toreros leading 3-2. In the IStimesthat
Stanford and San Diego have met, the Car
dinal have lost only once.
Tomorrow at noon. Stanford will face
Fresno State, who is currently 4-0 and has
collected wins over Cal Poly, UC-Santa
Cruz. Loyola Marymount and UC-Davis.

However. Stanford owns a flawless 13-0
record against the Bulldogs.
In his home debut as head coach.
Whitlinger is looking to set the mood for
the rest of the home matches.
"I really want the standard to be set
when we play at home: I don't want to lose
at home," Whitlinger said. "This is a place
where we need to win matches and set the
tone that when guys come into the Taube
Tennis Stadium, it's going to be a rough
deal. That's what I want to instill in the guys.
"We've got a tennis match to play first,
and once we get that done, we're going to
have a good time," he said.
