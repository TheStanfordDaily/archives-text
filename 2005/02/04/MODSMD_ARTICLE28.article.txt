# Tennis' version of Sixth Man begins
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Is there a better way to jumpstart the season
and a new club for student fans than to pit the de
fending NCAA doubles champions against two
former NCAA champions?
Following Saturday's match against Fresno
State, senior Sam Warburg and junior KC Cork
ery will be taking on 2005 Australian Open dou
bles finalists. Bob and Mike Bryan. The brothers
attended Stanford from 1996-98 before going
pro and are returning to Stanford fora day full of
events planned for the kick-off of the Cardinal
Court Club, tennis' version of the Sixth Man
Club.
"They're great ambassadors for college ten
nis and Stanford tennis, and they're great guys,"
head coach John Whitlinger said.
Saturday's exhibition match is scheduled to
begin immediately following the Fresno State
match and will take place rain or shine. In addi
tion to the match, there will be a question-and
answer session with Bob and Mike and a hitting
clinic will the brothers as well as the team. Fans
will have the opportunity to pick up posters au
tographed by the Stanford team, and there will
be an auction with items such as US Open, SAP
Open and Davis Cup tickets.
The Cardinal Court Club was the idea of ten
nis director Dick Gould, who hopes that it will
build excitement and a strong fan base for the
tennis teams. The men's and women's basket
ball teams have their respective Sixth Man and
Brickyard Clubs and have rather high atten
dance rates at the games. Unfortunately, Stan
ford has always struggled with attendance at
sporting events, not only with tennis but occa

sionally even with high-profile sports.
"College tennis can be one of the most excit
ing team sports there is to watch," Gould said.
"People don't understand that it can really be
exciting, and we're trying to get that word out to
the student body. Having a good student sup
port has proven to be invaluable for the perfor
mance of the teams."
Students in the Cardinal Court Club can earn
points by attending matches and promoting the
club, among other point-accumulating activities.
Ultimately, these points will be calculated and
prizes will be awarded at the end of the season.
"When they cheer the right way, students can
be a positive influence at a tennis match, and I'm
really looking forward to seeing what will hope
fully build on this in years to come," Whitlinger
said. "Hopefully we can give something to cheer
about."
There's no doubt that the teams will deliver.
The women's team went undefeated last year
and won the NCAA Championship. The men's
team boasts the defending NCAA doubles
champions. The two teams have brought home a
combined 31 championships in 32 years. But if
someone were to take a look at the stands during
a home match, one would never guess that the
teams were so successful.
The purpose of the Cardinal Court Club is to
bring excitement back to tennis and to support the
teams that are out there doing some serious dam
age to their opponents. Students who bring their
ID get in free, and the first 200 students to show up
on Saturday will receive a free Cardinal Court
Club long-sleeve shirt and some pizza. Even bet
ter, the student who has the most points at the end
of the season wins a trip to Hawaii with the team
next Thanksgiving break.
