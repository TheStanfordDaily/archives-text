# Christian groups sue universities nationwide
## 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Since 2(MX), a flood of controversies, protests
and lawsuits has pitted Christian student groups
against universities' nondiscrimination policies,
rocking campuses across the nation.
This series of legal battles began five years
ago when the Christian Fellowship at Tufts Uni
versity barred one of its members, an open les
bian, from an official position. Stanford Dean of
Religious Life. Scotty McLennan, who was at
Tufts at the time, recounted the well-publicized
conflict.
"[Tufts'] student judiciary banned the Inter
varsity Fellowship from campus for refusing to
allow a lesbian to hold a leadership position,"
McLennan said. "But it was found by a student
faculty review panel that the judiciary set the
ban without due process."
In the Tufts' case, the review panel recog
nized the Christian student group with the stipu
lation that it must avoid future confrontations
and any semblance of discrimination. On other
campuses, however, some Christian groups have
been successful in forcing colleges to allow them
to bar gay students and atheists.
Since the conflict at Tufts, battles have erupt
ed on many campuses, with different Christian
groups — claiming their First Amendment right
to freedom was being restricted by anti-discrim
ination laws — suing universities.
In the fall of 2(X)3, two students at Ohio State
University complained to the administration
that the Christian Legal Society on campus did
not allow gays or non-Christians to join the
group. Choosing to avoid confrontation with the
Society. Ohio State changed its discrimination
policies, and stated that groups with "sincerely
held religious beliefs" were exempt from univer
sity rules banning discrimination.

The battles still rage on, as universities such
as Arizona State and the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill refuse to acquiesce and
preemptively change their policies. Instead they
have chosen to fight back in the legal arena.
In light of the controversy, McLennan said he
recognizes the possibility of such a situation aris
ing at Stanford and said it has come up in discus
sion before.
"Stanford Associated Religions has a meet
ing every quarter," said McLennan, " There's
enough good information about what has hap
pened at other universities to make sure that ev
eryone is listening to each other. I really hope we
don't have that kind of conflict."
Despite the wariness, many involved in reli
gious life at Stanford — including McLennan—
said similar problems are not likely to occur
here.
Junior Rosabelle Oribello, the LGBT Cen
ter's liaison to on-campus residences, believes
the current political atmosphere at Stanford will
help prevent the outbreak of such a controversy.
"I don't think it will happen at this campus
because the message the center has gotten from
the religious groups has been that they are pret
ty affirming of LGBTs," she said. "Though I
don't know what it's like on other college cam
puses, we have a pretty liberal campus and that
goes far in reducing the chances of these kinds of
conflicts."
McLennan agreed with Oribello's reasoning.
"Stanford is a very pluralistic environment,
religious and in other ways," he said.
Many students believe that it is this political
ly-homogeneous atmosphere that prevents the
difficulties faced at other schools.
Todd Hojo, a member of the leadership team
for the Catholic student community, believes
that Stanford students, in general, are very good
at accepting and respecting differences.

"As a Catholic, 1 have for the most part felt
respected by other students who don't share my
beliefs," he said.
McLennan reaffirmed Stanford's policy pre
venting discrimination based on sexual orienta
tion, but explained that Stanford has a clause
preventing religious discrimination as well. In
the event of such a conflict, some students said
they would be very disappointed if Stanford
took an approach similar to Ohio State.
"I think that it is very dangerous to make ex
emptions from prohibitions on discrimination,"
said junior Alayna Buckner, a member of the
Unitarian Universalists. "Literally, doesn't the
prohibition lose all meaning if we do make ex
emptions? The prohibition is there specifically
to say that no reason, be it 'sincere', 'religious' or
anything else is an acceptable reason to discrim
inate."
Junior Carla Fenves. president of the Jewish
Leadership Council, also emphasized her orga
nization's tolerance for lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgendered students, adding that there is
a queer Jewish group at Hillel and that the Hillel
Rabbi is openly lesbian.
"When you become a student group, you are
upheld to the Stanford tolerance policy," Fenves
said. "I could see the University feeling particu
larly worried if a group that discriminates gets
money from the ASSU. I don't think students
should pay for groups who discriminate against
sexual orientation."
While the likelihood of a conflict seems small,
McLennan admits that the reality could be dif
ferent.
"The truth is, most religious traditions still
have discriminatory clauses," he said. "In terms
of a conflict. I think we can avoid it."
