# Undergrad Senate passes bill for student input in Univ. investment
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate on Tuesday threw its weight be
hind a growing student movement
for increased transparency in the
way universities invest their endow
ments.
By a vote of 9-3-2, the Senate ap
proved a bill calling on Stanford's
Board of Trustees "to allow for
greater, more direct student involve
ment and input in the endowment
process" and "to take steps in the di
rection of investment disclosure."
The bill also calls fora meeting be
tween a board member and interest
ed students "to discuss how to ampli
fy student voice in the endowment
process."
The portions of the bill that called
for greater student voice were ap
proved unanimously — a vote of 14-
0 — but three senators, including
Senate Chair Chris Lin. a senior, dis

agreed with the line urging disclo
sure, and the bill was split to allow
them to vote against that portion.
Stanford's endowment — which
the University estimates at $10 bil
lion but which the ASSU pegs at
$12.2 billion — generates an annual
return of between 15 and 20 percent
and helps cover a significant part of
the University's operating budget.
Over the past year, student ac
tivists have been lobbying the Uni
versity to disclose how it invests that
money.
Senior Anna Mumford of the
Stanford Coalition for Investment
Disclosure said in a press release that
the ASSU's passage of the bill "will
send a powerful message to Stanford
that as students and members of this
University community, we care
about impacts our university is hav
ing on the larger world through our
investments."
After Stanford divested from
apartheid South Africa in the 1980s

due to student pressure, the Univer
sity set up the Advisory Panel on In
vestment Responsibility to give stu
dent and faculty representatives a
voice in endowment investment de
cisions. But the SCID approached
the ASSU about drafting a bill be
cause its members felt that the panel
does not provide for sufficient stu
dent input.
When the bill was drafted, coali
tion representative senior Raphael
Ginsberg called it a "pared-down
version of what we are striving for" -
that is, full disclosure of University
investments.
Sophomore Omar Shakir, the
bill's author, said he thinks its pas
sage will lend credibility to students'
concerns as they meet with the
Board of Trustees.
"We don't want to go in there
and say, 'Look, here's what you
need to do. here's the policy you
need to adopt,"' Shakir said, point
ing out that the bill's wording allows

for flexibility in addressing the issue.
"Maybe we can put together a
forum or a group to look into
changes."
Lin said he agrees that the APIR
is ineffective.
"I don't really support full invest
ment disclosure," he added. "I think
Stanford definitely needs to main
tain our competitive advantage in
our portfolio investment strategy. I
think there are definitely other ways
to achieve investment responsibility
than full disclosure."
Opponents of full investment dis
closure have said that it would com
promise Stanford's ability to maxi
mize the return on its investments.
Lin said that some lucrative hedge
funds and venture capital funds
have been known to drop clients
that disclose the companies they in
vest in.
"I don't want the [endowment)
pool to become over-politicized,"
Lin said.
