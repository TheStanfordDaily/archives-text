# GSC discusses funding for tsunami relief benefit
## 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM 
Wednesday night, the Graduate
Student Council focused on the
transferal of funds for the Associa
tion of Chinese College Students at
Stanford and funding fora reception
to be held by the group Stanford Stu
dent Relief as a fundraiser.
The relief benefit will be held
Feb. 12 for university students at the
Velvet Lounge in San Francisco.
The establishment has allowed Stan
ford to host the event for free, and all
of the money collected at the door
will be contributed to Hearts to the
World, a philanthropic organization
providing aid to victims of the South
Asian tsunamis. There will also be a
large card for attendants to sign,
which will be sent to Save the Chil
dren in Southeast Asia, another hu
manitarian organization. Students
from Stanford, UC San Francisco
and UC Berkeley will attend.
The GSC also discussed the
shortage of labor funding for the As
sociation of Chinese College Stu
dents at Stanford for its annual Chi
nese New Year celebration. Before
this year, the University had allowed
students to decorate and set up par
ties themselves, but now they must

hire outside companies to provide
these services.
The association had allotted only
$500 for labor and $1800 for food
and refreshments. To compensate
for the disparity, the group request
ed a transferal of $1500 from its food
to its labor fund. Not only did the
GSC approve this request, but it also
decided to contribute an additional
$500 to the association's food fund.
Council members expressed their
excitement at the recently distribut
ed Caltrain "Go Pass" stickers,
which allow graduate students who
live off campus to ride the train at
any time for free.
Previously the council had been
uncertain of when the stickers would
begin to be produced, since Caltrain
officials had projected them to be
available sometime toward the end
of winter quarter.
Although the stickers are cur
rently offered to all graduate stu
dents, council members fear that
many are not aware of their avail
ability. They discussed where to ad
vertise the "Go Pass" stickers, and
several members suggested the Mar
guerite shuttle, the parking and
transportation Web site and articles
in The fc^aily.
