# Sullivan still busy after deanship
## 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Right now, Kathleen M. Sullivan just might be the busiest professor on
campus. And she isn't even teaching this quarter.
Long stacks of file cartons occupy half of her office at the Law School.
Some are without lids and reveal files and folders still crammed into any
place where they will fit. Sullivan apologized to this reporter for the messi
ness and says she's been too busy to unpack. Strange, since she officially
returned to the faculty four months ago.
Sullivan stepped down as dean of the Law School on Sept. 1, after serv
ing in the post since September 1999. Throughout her five years as dean,
she was known to operate at a breakneck pace.
Prof. Allen S. Weiner, one of the new international law specialists hired
by Sullivan in 2003, recalls her all-out work ethic.
"When she recruited me, I was in the Netherlands and nine hours of
time difference away," he said. "It didn't matter when I sent her an email
â€” at midnight or 3 in the afternoon, I got a response within ten minutes.
She worked around the clock and clearly was somebody who devoted an
extraordinary amount of energy, heart and soul to this law school."
Sullivan explained her initial approach to the job.
"I was lucky to become dean when I did," Sullivan said. "Things were
going well economically nnd the school was bullish. When 1 first became
dean, my three main goals were to make the school more high-tech, be
cause we are centered in the Silicon Valley, to transform us into an inter
national school and improve public and international law and to create a
superb clinical education program."
In 60 frantic months, Sullivan appointed 15 new professors, including
international and internet law specialists, and a new clinical faculty line.
She also launched cyberlaw and community clinics, raised more than $ 1 (X)
in alumni gifts and oversaw an $11-million renovation of the Law School,
just to name a few of her accomplishments.
She recently finalized the $43.5 million Munger donation, which she
described as the "biggest gift in the history of American legal education."
Of the many highlights of Sullivan's tenure as dean. Prof. Pamela S. Kar
lan emphasized Sullivan's commitment to the Law School's clinical programs.
"During her deanship, there were huge changes in the clinical pro
gram," Karlan explained. "We created an in-house clinical program and
she was instrumental in hiring Larry Marshall, now the director of clinical
programs. She was very supportive of my Supreme Court clinic."

Weiner said he believes Sullivan successfully realized her vision.
"Stanford hasn't always been the leader in international law," he said.
"She unquestionably reached her goal of improving this area. She didn't
merely say that she was committed to strengthening this area, but her hir
ing decisions clearly manifested that commitment. I think the University
owes her an extraordinary debt of gratitude for her work to maintain and
enhance the reputation of this law school."
After five years of non-stop work, Sullivan has certainly earned a break.
"Right now I'm just spending some much-deserved time off," she said
meekly, smiling as she reclined on a chair in her office.
But don't get her wrong. Though Sullivan is in the middle of her one
year administrative leave, granted to all deans after completing their
tenure, she has yet to show any signs of slowing down.
