# New study links race and DNA material
## 
### JESSICA ZHANG STAFF WRITER 
A recent study conducted at the Stanford Medical School
challenges the widely held belief that race is only a social
construct and provides evidence that race has genetic impli
cations.
The study, recently published in the American Journal of
Human Genetics, was led by Neil Risch — a former Stan
ford genetics professor who now teaches at UC San Francis
co — who examined 326 different DNA regions, using 3,636
subjects.
Risch's project is by far the largest study of this kind, in
cluding evidence collected from patients that hail from 15 lo
cations within the U.S. and Taiwan.
"This broad distribution is important because it means
that the results are representative of racial groups through
out the United States rather than a small region that might
not reflect the population nationwide," according to a press
release issued by the Stanford Medical Center.
Researchers on Risch's team examined the genetic sign
posts of white, African-American, East Asian and Hispanic
subjects using a computer program that groups relevant re
sults into clusters.
Only four clearly distinguishable clusters appeared. In all
but five cases, individuals within each cluster were of the
same race, Risch said.
"Socially defined categories of race-ethnicity correspond
extremely closely to genetically defined categories," he
added.
This high correspondence between self-identified race
and genetic makeup was an unexpected result for many in
the genetics field.
"1 asked other scientists, including geneticists, how often

they thought the two categories would he discordant," Risch
said. "The most common answer was about 20 percent of the
time, with some people saying 50 percent or higher."
The study found a correspondence of 99.9 percent with a
discordance of 0.1 percent. He said that most people would
not predict the correspondence to be as high due to previous
reports that have been written on the subject.
Despite this unexpected result, the study does not pro
vide evidence for genes that cause differences in traits with-

in racial or ethnic groups.
"This study focused on genetic
markers," Risch said. "These results
say nothing about other traits except
that it is possible that genetic factors
may contribute to differences in
traits among racial and ethnic
groups."
The results of this study may im
pact the way in which medicine is
practiced in the U.S.
According to the Medical Cen
ter's press release, genetic signposts
identifying the race of individuals
can help doctors determine which
patients may be more susceptible to
certain diseases and may require ad
ditional screening.
A study to take these findings one
step further is already in progress.
Risch and other researchers identi
fied regions of chromosomes 6 and
21 that seem to contain genes lead
ing to increased risk of hypertension.
They also found that these genes
have a higher frequency among
those of African descent.
"So, it appears that genetic fac
tors may contribute to increased risk
of hypertension in Africans, but

these results also do not say the de
gree to which these particular genes
contribute and how much role the
environment also plays," Risch said.
Risch argued that fears that racial
genetic profiling will arise from the
study are unfounded.
"The FBI and others are already
using genetic markers to identify
people and all population geneticists
are aware that these markers differ
in frequency among the major racial
ethnic groups," he said.
Despite the strong correspon
dence between race and genes,
Risch pointed out that traits reflect
both an individual's genetic make
up as well as environmental factors.
Accordingly, determining the caus
es of group trait differences is diffi
cult-sometimes even impossible, he
said.
"Our results show that socially
defined racial and ethnic groups,
while being genetically differen
tiate. also differ fora large variety
of environmental factors — socio
economic, cultural, behavioral and
so on," Risch said.

co — who examined 326 different DNA regions, using 3,636
subjects.
Risch's project is by far the largest study of this kind, in
cluding evidence collected from patients that hail from 15 lo
cations within the U.S. and Taiwan.
"This broad distribution is important because it means
that the results are representative of racial groups through
out the United States rather than a small region that might
not reflect the population nationwide," according to a press
release issued by the Stanford Medical Center.
Researchers on Risch's team examined the genetic sign
posts of white, African-American, East Asian and Hispanic
subjects using a computer program that groups relevant re
sults into clusters.
Only four clearly distinguishable clusters appeared. In all
but five cases, individuals within each cluster were of the
same race, Risch said.
"Socially defined categories of race-ethnicity correspond
extremely closely to genetically defined categories," he
added.
This high correspondence between self-identified race
and genetic makeup was an unexpected result for many in
the genetics field.
"1 asked other scientists, including geneticists, how often

they thought the two categories would he discordant," Risch
said. "The most common answer was about 20 percent of the
time, with some people saying 50 percent or higher."
The study found a correspondence of 99.9 percent with a
discordance of 0.1 percent. He said that most people would
not predict the correspondence to be as high due to previous
reports that have been written on the subject.
Despite this unexpected result, the study does not pro
vide evidence for genes that cause differences in traits with-

in racial or ethnic groups.
"This study focused on genetic
markers," Risch said. "These results
say nothing about other traits except
that it is possible that genetic factors
may contribute to differences in
traits among racial and ethnic
groups."
The results of this study may im
pact the way in which medicine is
practiced in the U.S.
According to the Medical Cen
ter's press release, genetic signposts
identifying the race of individuals
can help doctors determine which
patients may be more susceptible to
certain diseases and may require ad
ditional screening.
A study to take these findings one
step further is already in progress.
Risch and other researchers identi
fied regions of chromosomes 6 and
21 that seem to contain genes lead
ing to increased risk of hypertension.
They also found that these genes
have a higher frequency among
those of African descent.
"So, it appears that genetic fac
tors may contribute to increased risk
of hypertension in Africans, but

these results also do not say the de
gree to which these particular genes
contribute and how much role the
environment also plays," Risch said.
Risch argued that fears that racial
genetic profiling will arise from the
study are unfounded.
"The FBI and others are already
using genetic markers to identify
people and all population geneticists
are aware that these markers differ
in frequency among the major racial
ethnic groups," he said.
Despite the strong correspon
dence between race and genes,
Risch pointed out that traits reflect
both an individual's genetic make
up as well as environmental factors.
Accordingly, determining the caus
es of group trait differences is diffi
cult-sometimes even impossible, he
said.
"Our results show that socially
defined racial and ethnic groups,
while being genetically differen
tiate. also differ fora large variety
of environmental factors — socio
economic, cultural, behavioral and
so on," Risch said.
