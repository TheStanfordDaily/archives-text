# New study links race and DNA material

A recent study conducted at the Stanford Medical School
challenges the widely held belief that race is only a social
construct and provides evidence that race has genetic impli
cations.
The study, recently published in the American Journal of
Human Genetics, was led by Neil Risch — a former Stan
ford genetics professor who now teaches at UC San Francis
co — who examined 326 different DNA regions, using 3,636
subjects.
Risch's project is by far the largest study of this kind, in
cluding evidence collected from patients that hail from 15 lo
cations within the U.S. and Taiwan.
"This broad distribution is important because it means
that the results are representative of racial groups through
out the United States rather than a small region that might
not reflect the population nationwide," according to a press
release issued by the Stanford Medical Center.
Researchers on Risch's team examined the genetic sign
posts of white, African-American, East Asian and Hispanic
subjects using a computer program that groups relevant re
sults into clusters.
Only four clearly distinguishable clusters appeared. In all
but five cases, individuals within each cluster were of the
same race, Risch said.
"Socially defined categories of race-ethnicity correspond
extremely closely to genetically defined categories," he
added.
This high correspondence between self-identified race
and genetic makeup was an unexpected result for many in
the genetics field.
"1 asked other scientists, including geneticists, how often

they thought the two categories would he discordant," Risch
said. "The most common answer was about 20 percent of the
time, with some people saying 50 percent or higher."
The study found a correspondence of 99.9 percent with a
discordance of 0.1 percent. He said that most people would
not predict the correspondence to be as high due to previous
reports that have been written on the subject.
Despite this unexpected result, the study does not pro
vide evidence for genes that cause differences in traits with-
