Khapsody in Red
by Jindong Cai
Western classical music has become as Chinese as Peking Opera, and it
has woven its way into the hearts and lives of ordinary Chinese people.
This lucidly written account traces the biographies of the bold
visionaries who carried out this musical merger.
RHAPSODY IN RED is a history of classical music in China that
revolves around a common theme: how Western classical music entered
China, and how it became Chinese. China's oldest orchestra was
founded in 1879, two years before the Boston Symphony. Since then,
classical music has woven its way into the lives of ordinary Chinese
people.
Prof. Jindong Cai is the Director of Orchestral Studies at Stanford
University, and conductor of the Stanford Symphony Orchestra. He has
a special interest in the works of Chinese composers. He received the
ASCAP award for his support of contemporary music in 1998 and 2002.

Dare to Lead!
by Mike Merrill
In business, mavericks have changed industries, opened entirely new
markets and turned failing companies into industry leaders. Dare to
Lead! is the story of 50 business leaders who succeeded precisely because
they cast aside conventional wisdom and charted their own course. You'll
learn how:
• Larry Page and Sergey Brin, entering late in a field crowded with huge
competitors, built Google into the world's leading search engine without
spending a dime on a brand campaign.
• John Osher turned a $1.5 million investment into a $450 million
payoff in 18 months by applying a successful idea from his previous
company to a new industry about which he knew virtually nothing.
• Gert Boyle saved Columbia Sportswear and built it into the largest
outdoor apparel company in the world by firing all her professional
advisors and running the company her way.
• Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank of Home Depot created a fictional
VP of Customer Service, then had "his" calls routed to the Executive Suite
so they couldlearn what was really going on in their stores.

The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Volume Vby Clayborne Carson
The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr. has become the definitive record
of the most significant correspondence, sermons, speeches, published
writings, and unpublished manuscripts of one of America's best known
advocates for peace and justice. Threshold of a New Decade, Volume V
illustrates the growing sophistication and effectiveness of King and
the organizations he led while providing an unparalleled look into
the surprising emergence of the sit in protests that sparked the social
struggles of the 19605.
CI.AYBORNE CARSON holds a PhD from UCLA, and currently is a pro
fessor of History at Stanford University. He is the director and
executive editor of the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project at Stanford
LJniversity.
Unbelievable by Cheo Hodari Coker
In this riveting account of Biggie's life from the man who was with him
36 hours before his shooting, hip hop journalist Cheo Hodari Coker tells
the story you've never heard about the dramatic, tension filled world of
Biggie, tracing friendships and feuds from the beginning to the bitter end.
Coker's narrative is based on exclusive interviews with Biggie's family and
friends, some of whom have never spoken publicly about Biggie before.
Compeilingly written and brilliantly illustrated, this is an in-depth look at
the life and afterlife of an icon whose music is as powerful and prevalent
as ever. A virtuoso of flow as well as a master storyteller, Biggie was
arguably the greatest rapper of all time. It's time to remember his life and
celebrate his work.
CHEO HODARI COKER is a hip hop journalist turned Hollywood
screenwriter. His writing has appeared in VIBE, Spin, the Los Angeles
Times, the Village Voice, Premiere, Details, Rolling Stone, Essence, The
Source, XXL, and URB. He has worked on feature film scripts for Warner
Brothers, MTV Networks, and HBO. Cheo received his B.A. in English
from Stanford in 1994, and was a writer for the Stanford Daily.

Khapsody in Red
by Jindong Cai
Western classical music has become as Chinese as Peking Opera, and it
has woven its way into the hearts and lives of ordinary Chinese people.
This lucidly written account traces the biographies of the bold
visionaries who carried out this musical merger.
RHAPSODY IN RED is a history of classical music in China that
revolves around a common theme: how Western classical music entered
China, and how it became Chinese. China's oldest orchestra was
founded in 1879, two years before the Boston Symphony. Since then,
classical music has woven its way into the lives of ordinary Chinese
people.
Prof. Jindong Cai is the Director of Orchestral Studies at Stanford
University, and conductor of the Stanford Symphony Orchestra. He has
a special interest in the works of Chinese composers. He received the
ASCAP award for his support of contemporary music in 1998 and 2002.

Dare to Lead!
by Mike Merrill
In business, mavericks have changed industries, opened entirely new
markets and turned failing companies into industry leaders. Dare to
Lead! is the story of 50 business leaders who succeeded precisely because
they cast aside conventional wisdom and charted their own course. You'll
learn how:
• Larry Page and Sergey Brin, entering late in a field crowded with huge
competitors, built Google into the world's leading search engine without
spending a dime on a brand campaign.
• John Osher turned a $1.5 million investment into a $450 million
payoff in 18 months by applying a successful idea from his previous
company to a new industry about which he knew virtually nothing.
• Gert Boyle saved Columbia Sportswear and built it into the largest
outdoor apparel company in the world by firing all her professional
advisors and running the company her way.
• Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank of Home Depot created a fictional
VP of Customer Service, then had "his" calls routed to the Executive Suite
so they couldlearn what was really going on in their stores.

The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Volume Vby Clayborne Carson
The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr. has become the definitive record
of the most significant correspondence, sermons, speeches, published
writings, and unpublished manuscripts of one of America's best known
advocates for peace and justice. Threshold of a New Decade, Volume V
illustrates the growing sophistication and effectiveness of King and
the organizations he led while providing an unparalleled look into
the surprising emergence of the sit in protests that sparked the social
struggles of the 19605.
CI.AYBORNE CARSON holds a PhD from UCLA, and currently is a pro
fessor of History at Stanford University. He is the director and
executive editor of the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project at Stanford
LJniversity.
Unbelievable by Cheo Hodari Coker
In this riveting account of Biggie's life from the man who was with him
36 hours before his shooting, hip hop journalist Cheo Hodari Coker tells
the story you've never heard about the dramatic, tension filled world of
Biggie, tracing friendships and feuds from the beginning to the bitter end.
Coker's narrative is based on exclusive interviews with Biggie's family and
friends, some of whom have never spoken publicly about Biggie before.
Compeilingly written and brilliantly illustrated, this is an in-depth look at
the life and afterlife of an icon whose music is as powerful and prevalent
as ever. A virtuoso of flow as well as a master storyteller, Biggie was
arguably the greatest rapper of all time. It's time to remember his life and
celebrate his work.
CHEO HODARI COKER is a hip hop journalist turned Hollywood
screenwriter. His writing has appeared in VIBE, Spin, the Los Angeles
Times, the Village Voice, Premiere, Details, Rolling Stone, Essence, The
Source, XXL, and URB. He has worked on feature film scripts for Warner
