### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Arizona State head coach Charli Turner
Thome had three goals for Saturday's game
against No. 4 Stanford: win the rebounding
battle, limit the Cardinal's trips to the free
throw line and keep Stanford from scoring
in the paint. Instead, Stanford (21-2, 12-1
Pacific-10 Conference) pounded the ball in
side and spent half the day at the charity
stripe en route to a 67-53 victory at Maples
Pavilion.
Much improved from a year ago, the Sun
Devils have used an attacking pressure de
fense and superiority on the boards to dic
tate game tempo all season. Entering Satur

day's game, their defense was giving up just
52.4 points per game, which ranks No. 1 in
the Pac-10 and eighth in the country.
In its upset victories over then-No.B
Connecticut and then-No. 14 Georgia, Ari
zona State limited the Huskies and Bull
dogs to 50 and 57 points, respectively.
On Saturday, Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer and the Cardinal gave the
Sun Devils a taste of their own medicine,
playing a full-court pressing defense for
the vast majority of the game. The press it
self led directly to four Arizona State
turnovers, and the Sun Devils committed a
total of 18 on the afternoon.


LINDSAY COIEMAN/The Stanford Daily
Junior center Brooke Smith finished with 15 points and eight rebounds in No. 4 Stan
ford's 67-53 win Saturday. The Cardinal held Arizona State to 33 percent shooting.
"I think sometimes when other
teams aren't used to playing fast they
can sort of get out of their rhythm,"
freshman Candice Wiggins said.
The loss of rhythm extended to
Arizona State's shooting as well.
They shot just over 33 percent for
the game. A three-point field goal
from sophomore Emily Westerberg
with 10:42 remaining before half
time was the first basket of the game
for the Sun Devils and one of just
seven in the first half.
From that point, it was all downhill
for Westerberg, who, after lighting
the Cardinal up for 22 points in the
last meeting between the two
schools, managed just 10 points on 3-
of-11 shooting.
The lone bright spot on offense
for the Sun Devils was the play of se
nior guard Kylan Loney, who shot 5-
of-7 from the field, and was a perfect
3-of-3 from beyond the arc. Loney
finished with a team-high 13 points
and chipped in three assists.
While Stanford's defense kept
Arizona State at bay, its offense at
tacked the Sun Devils in the paint
with the trio of Brooke Smith, T'Nae
Thiel and Kristen Newlin.
In the Jan. 7 game in Tempe,
Ariz., Arizona State used a zone de
fense to slow Stanford's posts, while
challenging the Cardinal's guards to
shoot the ball from the perimeter.
But in eight games since, Stanford
has rediscovered its shooting touch,
averaging eight three-point field
goals per game and shooting better
than 44 percent from beyond the arc.
As a result. Turner Thorne opted
fora man-to-man defensive scheme
that might control the Cardinal's
guards. The result? Stanford shot
just 3-of-9 from three-point range,
but the Sun Devils quickly found

themselves in foul trouble as they
tried to grapple with Stanford's Big
Three down low.
In a virtual replay of Thursday
night's game against Arizona, the
Cardinal found themselves in the
bonus for more than 20 minutes
against the Sun Devils and got to the
free throw line for 28 attempts, con
verting 22. Stanford outscored the
Sun Devils by 10 points from the
charity stripe alone.
Nonetheless, Arizona State
flashed some defense of its own. tak
ing advantage of 17 turnovers in the
game and trailed by just eight points
at halftime.
"I thought this had the feel of a
[NCAA Tournament) game," Van-
Derveer said. "It's good for us to
have these games. 1 think they're an
NCAA team."
The Sun Devils might have hung
around longer had they kept a lid on
Wiggins, who scored just five points
in the first half.
After shredding Arizona State
for 31 points in Tempe. the NCAA
Freshman of the Year candidate
dropped 15 on the Sun Devils in the
second half at Maples, finishing with
a game-high 20 points and convert
ing all eight of her free throw at
tempts. Wiggins also added three
steals.
"That young lady's intensity is in
credible," Turner Thorne said.
"That's what impresses me the most.
You think as a freshman you can
kind of take her out of the game, but
you can't."
For the weekend. Wiggins aver
aged 20 points, five rebounds and
three-and-a-half steals over 62 total
minutes played.
Senior Sebnem Kimyacioglu was
1 -of-1 from beyond the arc, moving
her into a tie with Jennifer Azzi for
fourth place in Stanford history for
three-point field goals made. Her
next trey will tie Lindsey Yamasaki
for third place.
