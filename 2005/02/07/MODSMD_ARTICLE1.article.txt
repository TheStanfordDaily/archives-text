### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Arizona State head coach Charli Turner
Thome had three goals for Saturday's game
against No. 4 Stanford: win the rebounding
battle, limit the Cardinal's trips to the free
throw line and keep Stanford from scoring
in the paint. Instead, Stanford (21-2, 12-1
Pacific-10 Conference) pounded the ball in
side and spent half the day at the charity
stripe en route to a 67-53 victory at Maples
Pavilion.
Much improved from a year ago, the Sun
Devils have used an attacking pressure de
fense and superiority on the boards to dic
tate game tempo all season. Entering Satur

day's game, their defense was giving up just
52.4 points per game, which ranks No. 1 in
the Pac-10 and eighth in the country.
In its upset victories over then-No.B
Connecticut and then-No. 14 Georgia, Ari
zona State limited the Huskies and Bull
dogs to 50 and 57 points, respectively.
On Saturday, Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer and the Cardinal gave the
Sun Devils a taste of their own medicine,
playing a full-court pressing defense for
the vast majority of the game. The press it
self led directly to four Arizona State
turnovers, and the Sun Devils committed a
total of 18 on the afternoon.

Junior center Brooke Smith finished with 15 points and eight rebounds in No. 4 Stan
ford's 67-53 win Saturday. The Cardinal held Arizona State to 33 percent shooting.
