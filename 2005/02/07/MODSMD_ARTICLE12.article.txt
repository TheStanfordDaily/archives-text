# Water in the milk bottle
## The 						future of menstruation 
### 
When I got my period in the
middle of finals last quar
ter, 1 was too enraged to
finish my term paper and instead
called my friend Haps to rant about
cramps, schoolwork and cycle-free
men.
I always call Haps for this kind of
thing. 1 knew her before I knew
menarche, and her pheromones
have screwed with practically every
cycle I've ever had.
Haps told me she'd just heard of a
Utopian culture in Africa in which
it's generally understood that men
struation is a woman's time off.

Menstruating
women vaca
tion in special
houses where
they receive
full-service
meals and
massages and,
most impor
tantly, do no
work. She
couldn't say
where this was
exactly, hut I
decided to find

out and emigrate.
I Googled "menstruation" and
discovered a Web site for the Muse
um of Menstruation and Women's
Health (www.mum.org). 1 found out
from the Web site that a number of
cultures provide menstrual huts for
women, but not to pamper them.
These cultures remove menstru
ating women from the community
because their blood is considered
polluting or offensive to men. (To
the men reading now: It's far, far
more offensive to us.)
According to Rice University
coursework, anthropologists theo
rize that the practice started as a way
of increasing paternal certainty by
broadcasting the woman's place in
her menstrual cycle.
In accompanying photos, one
Hawaiian hut resembles a teepee.
Another, built by the Dogon of Mali,
the African society, looks more or
less like a large, hollow cake with a
door in it. The common mode is
dark, dank and not too well fur
nished.
Sally Price, a professor from Col
lege of William and Mary, spent sev
eral bleeding cycles in a hut in Suri
name (just north of Brazil). On the
Museum of Menstruation Web site,
she described the experience as iso
lated and uncomfortable.
Haps was, as usual, a bit loose in
her fact-checking.
Nonetheless, I believe we can
learn from the mistakes of the past
without merely reacting against
them. A good idea is still a good
idea, and now that we've practically
thrown out the patriarchy, I'd like to
suggest we get back to the other
ideas that really were moving in the
right direction.
In one village in Southern Portu
gal, I think they have it right— the
sausage-loving inhabitants have
quite a to-do every year over killing
a pig and ramming it all into its own
intestines, according to a University
of Minnesota graduate student's
thesis paper. A menstruating
woman, however, cannot partici
pate. It is believed that she can rot
the pig meat with her evil eye.
Evil eye. This is not just supersti
tion. This is recognition of the in
credible depth of rage that begins
with PMS and ends 15 days later
when the spotting is over. Imagine if
our society acknowledged this
power.
Menstrual huts haven't worked
for women because they were built
for the service of men. But now, in
the 21st century, I feel that we —
with the benefit of historical knowl
edge, civil rights and menstrual rage
— can truly reform the system.
We can have well-lit menstrual
houses where we hole up, man-free,
for at least the first two days of every
cycle. It would be like a spa, with
free chocolate, where we would
enjoy full-service meals and mas
sages and, most importantly, do no
work.
What Haps relayed to me was not
fact, but a bright vision of the future.
And what better place to realize that
future than here, at Stanford, the
forefront of modern thought?

When I got my period in the
middle of finals last quar
ter, 1 was too enraged to
finish my term paper and instead
called my friend Haps to rant about
cramps, schoolwork and cycle-free
men.
I always call Haps for this kind of
thing. 1 knew her before I knew
menarche, and her pheromones
have screwed with practically every
cycle I've ever had.
Haps told me she'd just heard of a
Utopian culture in Africa in which
it's generally understood that men
struation is a woman's time off.

Menstruating
women vaca
tion in special
houses where
they receive
full-service
meals and
massages and,
most impor
tantly, do no
work. She
couldn't say
where this was
exactly, hut I
decided to find

out and emigrate.
I Googled "menstruation" and
discovered a Web site for the Muse
um of Menstruation and Women's
Health (www.mum.org). 1 found out
from the Web site that a number of
cultures provide menstrual huts for
women, but not to pamper them.
These cultures remove menstru
ating women from the community
because their blood is considered
polluting or offensive to men. (To
the men reading now: It's far, far
more offensive to us.)
According to Rice University
coursework, anthropologists theo
rize that the practice started as a way
of increasing paternal certainty by
broadcasting the woman's place in
her menstrual cycle.
In accompanying photos, one
Hawaiian hut resembles a teepee.
Another, built by the Dogon of Mali,
the African society, looks more or
less like a large, hollow cake with a
door in it. The common mode is
dark, dank and not too well fur
nished.
Sally Price, a professor from Col
lege of William and Mary, spent sev
eral bleeding cycles in a hut in Suri
name (just north of Brazil). On the
Museum of Menstruation Web site,
she described the experience as iso
lated and uncomfortable.
Haps was, as usual, a bit loose in
her fact-checking.
Nonetheless, I believe we can
learn from the mistakes of the past
without merely reacting against
them. A good idea is still a good
idea, and now that we've practically
thrown out the patriarchy, I'd like to
suggest we get back to the other
ideas that really were moving in the
right direction.
In one village in Southern Portu
gal, I think they have it right— the
sausage-loving inhabitants have
quite a to-do every year over killing
a pig and ramming it all into its own
intestines, according to a University
of Minnesota graduate student's
thesis paper. A menstruating
woman, however, cannot partici
pate. It is believed that she can rot
the pig meat with her evil eye.
Evil eye. This is not just supersti
tion. This is recognition of the in
credible depth of rage that begins
with PMS and ends 15 days later
when the spotting is over. Imagine if
our society acknowledged this
power.
Menstrual huts haven't worked
for women because they were built
for the service of men. But now, in
the 21st century, I feel that we —
with the benefit of historical knowl
edge, civil rights and menstrual rage
— can truly reform the system.
We can have well-lit menstrual
houses where we hole up, man-free,
for at least the first two days of every
cycle. It would be like a spa, with
free chocolate, where we would
enjoy full-service meals and mas
sages and, most importantly, do no
work.
What Haps relayed to me was not
fact, but a bright vision of the future.
And what better place to realize that
future than here, at Stanford, the
forefront of modern thought?
