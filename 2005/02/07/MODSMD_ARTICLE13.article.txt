Under the stars of Lake Lagunita, men
and women danced around a brilliantly lit
bonfire. The crowd applauded and people
young and old sang along to traditional Pun
jabi folk songs.
Saturday night marked the arrival of
Lohri, a Northern Indian farming festival
celebrating the end of winter and the ap
proaching spring harvest. Stanford students
and people from the Bay Area crowded
Lake Lag to enjoy Stanford's Lohri festivi
ties.
"Lohri is a time to ensure strong roots
for the community and it builds good re
lationships throughout the year," said
Ravi Dhillan, a coordinator of Stanford's
event.
The festival is built around good will,
community and fun. Music and crowd par
ticipation both play an important role in the
celebration.
As people began to arrive at the event,
they were served appetizers while music
played in the background.
As the crowd grew, people sang and
danced around the ceremonial bonfire
which in India creates warmth during a cold
winter's night.
Weddings, births and accomplishments
were announced and commemorated to
allow members of the Punjabi community
to keep track of one another's lives and
families. One couple was congratulated
for becoming grandparents, and a fresh
man was praised for beginning his studies

at Stanford.
Throughout the event, a full Indian din
ner was served to all in attendance.
The festival also included a performance
by the Stanford bhangra team, which
dressed in traditional Punjabi garb.
According to junior Sandeep Wasan, an
other coordinator of the festival, this year's
celebration drew the largest crowd in the
last 10 to 15 years that the celebration has
been held at Stanford. Three hundred to
400 people packed the parking lot by Lake
Lag to attend the event.
"People hear about our Lohri festival
through e-mail lists and word of mouth."
Wasan said. "Also, special funding from the
ASSU allowed us to host more people this
year than ever before."
In addition to the support of the ASSU,
the Lohri festival received funding from in
dividual donors and the Special Language
Program, which offers classes in Punjabi and
about 20 other less commonly spoken lan
guages. The event is largely organized
through students in a Punjabi class taught by
Dhillan.
When asked why the event was held at
Stanford, Dhillan spoke about the impor
tance of Lake Lag and the event's enriching
value for Stanford students.
"The Lake picnic area is best suited for
the event," Dhillan said. "We can have live
drumbeats, a bonfire and an open place to
celebrate just like we have in Punjab. The
event enhances Stanford's cultural life by
providing a valuable cultural resource not
only to Punjabi students, but all of the Stan
ford community."
