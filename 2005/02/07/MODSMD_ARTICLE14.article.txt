# Forum strives to increase disability awareness, support on campus

### JENNY BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The number of disabled people at Stan
ford may be small, but the Disabled Staff Stu
dents and Faculty Forum, or DSSFF, is work
ing to increase disability awareness and sup
port within the Stanford community.
The goal of the forum is to improve com
munication between Stanford community
members with and without disabilities. In the
past, the forum was very active in providing
and organizing disabilities education, train
ing, workshops and lectures. It also hosted so
cial activities, such as dinners and mutual sup
port groups, and it provided information to
the non-disabled.
"Recently, a professor who had a deaf stu
dent asked me to help him learn sign lan
guage so that he could communicate better
with students who have disabilities and have
better relationships with them," said the
group's current Chair Cathy Hass, who is
deaf.
Some members of the DSSFF are blind,
have impaired hearing or are confined to
wheelchairs. Some forum members have a
disabled family member and seek support.
Others just want to learn about and support
the disabled campus population.
Hass stresses the diversity of the group.
"It doesn't matter if you're disabled or
not, we just want people to know that all
these activities are available," Hass said.
"People shouldn't be embarrassed about
their disabilities. We just want to get people
to understand and communicate with each
other. Many people become disabled for dif

ferent reasons, and we're one big family at
Stanford and we can help them no matter
what the situation is."
The forum also helps disabled students
adjusting to Stanford. For example, some
people complain of difficulty in gaining ac
cess to many of the buildings. Forum mem
bers have discussed how to create facilities
for the disabled.
Sophomore Britton Cailloutte had his leg
amputated and now wears a prosthetic leg.
He has not, however, become involved with
Stanford's Disability Resource Center or
with the DSSFF. Cailloutte has not encoun
tered many obstacles around campus, but
states that simply getting around campus is
the biggest difficulty.
"Being allowed to have a golf cart on cam
pus is really important for me," Cailloutte
said. "I wouldn't be able to get around other
wise."
Hass notes that, during the 1980s, under
University President Donald Kennedy Stan
ford met the requirements of the Americans
with Disabilities Act. The University imple
mented ramps into dorms and provided
teachers trained to work with disabled stu
dents. It also provided interpreters and
Braille assistants to blind and deaf students.
The forum held its first event of the year
last Wednesday, when Hass brought in
Joanne Callahan, a blind Stanford graduate
and diversity recruiter for the CIA. She
spoke on job opportunities for disabled peo
ple in the CIA. According to Hass, Callahan
"is an excellent role model for other blind
people who can say 'look at all that woman
achieved, I can do that too.' "

The forum has been relatively inactive for
the past two years because of the death of a
leading staff member, Kimberly Thompson.
Cailloutte said that he has not received
disriminating treatment from other students
because of his disability.
"No. not at a11... if anything people go out
of their way to be helpful or make accommo
dations."
Mike Nunez, a senior who is legally blind
with some residual vision, agrees that the
general University community is as support

ive as possible of those with disabilities.
"I speculate that the transition experience
was a bit more difficult for me than it was for
most other students, but I did not consider
the transition particularly turbulent."
The difficulty with impaired vision, he
says, lies in future job opportunities after
leaving Stanford.
"1 predict that it constricts the breadth of
field and organizations into which 1 could
enter and in which I can perform competi
tively."
