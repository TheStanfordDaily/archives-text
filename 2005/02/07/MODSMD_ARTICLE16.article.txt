## Editorial Don't leave Awakuni's spot empty 
### 
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Gene Awakuni is
leaving his post at Stanford to begin a three-year term
as chancellor of the University of Hawaii's West
O'ahu campus starting this March. During his three
year stint at the University, Awakuni has left an in
delible mark on the Stanford community.
Given that Awakuni has had a positive impact at
Stanford, the University's decision thus far not to set up
a search committee for his replacement is discouraging.
In his tenure as vice provost, Awakuni was instru
mental in improving and increasing student activities
space, including the partial renovation of Tresidder
Memorial Union last year and the complete renova
tion of Old Union that is scheduled to take place in
2006.
Awakuni also took part in the decision to turn
Koble Gym over to the Drama Department to use for
classes and rehearsal space. Such renovations have
significantly enhanced life at the University, and stu
dents owe such enrichment to Awakuni's passion for
and dedication to student affairs.
In addition, Awakuni was a proponent of increas
ing the effectiveness and visibility of community cen
ters across campus. In particular, he encouraged the
building of the new Graduate Student Community
Center that opened on Oct. 15,2004.
On a different front, Awakuni was a strong advo

ganizes various alcohol-free student events, such as
Full Moon on the Quad.
Awakuni's greatest accomplishment during his

2(X)3 hiring of Greg Boardman as dean of students.
In the past year, Awakuni and Boardman have
worked together to provide funding to various com
munity centers and much-needed support to student
activities. The tandem has taken strong steps in the
right direction and these steps must be advanced in
order to further improve student affairs.
With Awakuni's departure, Stanford loses a key
figure in its student affairs division, and the Universi
ty's decision to take its time in implementing a search
committee for his replacement is potentially harmful
to the immediate future of student life.
The role of the Vice Provost for Student Affairs
has changed and evolved into an integral part of the
University's administration since Awakuni took over
the post in January 2002. Therefore, it is imperative
that Stanford replace Awakuni with someone who
will continue to focus on and properly represent stu
dent interests.
Administrators told The Daily that they are taking
time to reassess the role of the Vice Provost of Stu
dent Affairs before searching fora replacement.
However, it has been two-and-a-half months since
Awakuni announced his departure â€” too long a peri
od for the University logo without taking visible steps
toward filling Awakuni's position.
The Daily wishes Awakuni all the best at his new job
in Hawaii and urges the University's administration to
immediately begin the search for his replacement.
