Speed dating is an interesting phenomenon. Essen
tially it's a mechanism for ordinary folks like you
and me to find True Love. Well maybe not that, but
at least to get laid.
I'll assume youi're all familiar with the premise: A
couple dozen people of either sex, a continual stream of

awkward conversation, not quite
enough alcohol to dull the sense that
you're making a fool of yourself and
the nagging feeling that on a Friday
night, you should really be elsewhere.
It's somewhat of a puzzle to me
how a high-speed version of a dating
agency became cool. For years, ads
proclaiming iFind Your One True
Partner? were the subject of jokes
rather than serious attention.
Yet somehow, in the most brilliant
piece of marketing since New Coke

(younger folk may want to Google that), adding the
phrase iin three minutest to any matchmaking proposi
tion transforms it into a socially acceptable plan.
Of course, I have a proven track record of ignoring
my better instincts, so over the weekend 1 indulged in
last seasoms hot new cultural phenomenon.
Obviously, my primary motivation was to report to
you, dear readers, what horrors (or delights, 1 suppose)
can await should you embrace the world of aided-dating.
Well that and the faint hope of some action ...
Despite the general underperformance of grad
school-organized events I was only a shade pessimistic
about the evening's possibilities prior to the big day.
Cynicism, however, reasserted itself after I arrived and
took in the strewn rose petals, the multiplicity of candles
and the clustered folding chairs.
In hindsight, what should have occurred to me is that
the kind of speed dating event constructed by Lyman
CAs was likely to come up short both in style and sub
stance. After all, if I were a typical attendee, it would be
unfair to expect too much of the other daters.
Things started off surprisingly well as I found myself
chatting to a friend — a gentle, but misleading, intro
duction to the brutality that was to follow. After that,
though, a continual stream of unpleasantness.
I would list the various ways conversations went

wrong, but frankly I'd rather not relive the experience,
other than to say that my ability to interact socially is nei
ther good nor well below the norm. 1 hit a particular low
by telling a grad student that studiousness is unattractive
— not a great conversation starter.
After a while, rapid romance becomes a little like a
hyper-condensed Orientation Week. The same se
quence of questions are asked and answered — which is
a touch on the disturbing side. 1 can't help but worry that
in 30 years I'll still asking people what theyi're majoring
in...
For variety, I eventually started inquiring how atten
dees were finding the speed-dating experience. Almost
universally the response goes something along the lines
of: "Well, it's been fun, and I've met a lot of interesting
people ..."
Interesting people?!? What interesting people? Even
if everybody in the room was fascinating, no more than
three would possibly be able to convey that in three-and
a-half minutes. And, what's more, we're all grad stu
dents, we left "interesting" at home when we moved
here.
I've often heard certain bars or clubs described as
"meat markets." It's an unpleasant phrase, but sadly true
of the odd place here or there. Speed dating is not quite
that bad, but it certainly feels like youire shopping (and
being shopped for).
It's a sad truth that despite the horrors of Friday
night, my biggest regret is not that I went along. Iti's not
even that I wasnit faced with a room of pretty young
things with sparkling personalities and glints in their
eyes.
Rather it's this: Some people speed date because
they're busy and because it's the trendy way out of im
pending social failure; grad students, on the hand, do it
because there are few other ways out of the gaping pit of
further education and sometimes you have to shop in the
seedier parts of town.
Ah well, mustnit grumble. After all, at least we have
Valentine's Day to look forward to next week. My ex
citement knows no bounds.
