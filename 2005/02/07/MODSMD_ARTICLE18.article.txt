# Readership Editor

### JENNIFER GRAHAM READERSHIP EDITOR 
We're starting all over. Though I'd guess
the majority of The Daily's readers don't
know it, the paper you're reading today is sub
stantially different from the one you read two
weeks ago.
The editor in chief — who guides coverage
and makes all final editorial decisions — is
different. The editors in charge of the news,
editorial and sports pages are different. The
students who rotate nightly to do the hands
on work in each of these sections are different.
Sure, some of the writers are the same ... hut
that's about it.
Each year The Daily changes hands
around Feb. 1, and that switch can sometimes
mean very obvious changes to the direction
and content of the paper. Other times the
switch is subtler. The bottom line is, any beef
you may have had with The Daily from

September through January could now be
rendered moot; on the other hand, you also
may take issue with the style or policies of this
new volume.
We don't know what we're in store for yet,
but it seems safe to say that Vol. 227 isn't to
tally starting from scratch. The basic sections
are the same as before, and the new editor in
chief was last volume's managing editor for
news, which would suggest there will be a
large degree of continuity.
However, there are already some changes
— or at least distinguishing elements — in
this volume that are clear from just a week's
worth of papers. Personally, I find these
changes to be improvements and will expect
this editorial staff to continue working to
reach the apparently high bar they've set for
themselves. Here's what Vol. 227 looks like it
will be doing differently:
One: Each volume, whether The Daily
should devote resources and space to nation

aland international news sparks debate
amongst the staff. This volume doesn't seem
to shy away from it; rather, it has led two of its
first five papers with such stories.
While last volume's editors did send re
porters across the country to cover the presi
dential election, it seems that this news de
partment may he making a larger commit
ment to bringing in outside stories on a regu
lar basis. Stories covering Bush's inaugural
address and the elections in Iraq combined
the reporting of major news agencies with
Daily reporting at Stanford. If indeed this sig
nals the desire of the paper's staff to frame
major news stories in the context of Stanford
(which I think is a worthwhile and welcome
goal), then we'll be keeping an eye on how
they do it.
Two: Graduate students, rejoice. Well,
maybe not just quite yet. Many new Daily
staffs have gone into their volume with the ad
mirable goal of covering the graduate student

community in a way that makes The Daily
worthwhile for graduate students to read;
more often than not. The Daily falls short.
This volume, though, is off to an impressive
start. Three meaty stories on transportation
and graduate student life have already shown
up. If this trend continues, perhaps this staff
will be able to get past press-release type top
ics and delve into some issues that lie below
the purview of the Stanford News Service and
Graduate Student Council. Stories like ~.
Three: "Faculty question calendar
changes." I'm not sure how The Daily came
across this story (the change itself was covered
in a Faculty Senate article), but it is extremely
significant — not because calendar changes
are campus' most pressing issue, but because
The Daily covered a story essentially on intra
faculty politics. This is notoriously hard fora
troupe of undergrads to have a pulse on, and
The Daily's ability to pick out and cover sto
ries like this would lead to a major rise in the

quality and uniqueness of the paper. Similar
ly, the paper was been able to pick up on some
other interesting and relevant "University"
news, including new obstacles for overseas
service groups and the road anead for Stan
ford Law School's former dean.
So is Volume 227 just all good? No. Their
editorial page is already falling into the trap of
Vol. 226 by running editorials on topics that
have never been covered by the news depart
ment — a trend that readers should demand
stops.
Also, despite producing an impressive
combination of coverage tin campus talks as
well as faculty, graduate student. University,
national and international news, will this vol
ume be under-covering campus' political,
community and other student groups? Too
early to tell, but let's stay tuned.
