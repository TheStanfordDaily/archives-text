Poet Sekou Sundiata performed
"blessing the boats," a one-man
multimedia performance of his
near-death experiences on Saturday
night at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Sundiata. a resident artist this quar
ter at Stanford, set poetry, prose and
comedy to a background of music
and video to tell the story of his kid
ney failure, organ transplant and
near-fatal car accident.
"We looked at his work, and we
were incredibly intrigued by his per
formances and interested in him. so
we came together to host him here."
said Lois Wagner, executive direc
tor of Stanford Lively Arts, which
presented the performance in con
junction with the Committee for
Black Performing Arts. "Sekou is a
really intelligent, sensitive human
being and he's able to express his
emotions and experiences so well."
"blessing the boats." directed by
Rhodessa Jones, addresses Sundia
ta's illness, transplant and accident,
all of which occurred in a five-year
period.
Sundiata was diagnosed with kid
nev failure in 1996. and he received

a live donor transplant from a friend
in 1999. The following year, he
broke his neck in a car accident. The
performance describes the way his
illness exiled his body and spirit, as
well as his struggle to return to
health.
Through mixed media, Sundiata
weaves the ideas of family, friends,
art, life and death into his personal
story.
A post-performance discussion,
moderated by Drama Prof. Harry
Elam. was open to the public imme
diately after the show. Sundiata said
that "blessing the boats." which has
been performed every year since
2(X)2, was unlike anything he had
written or performed before.
"This is my first solely autobio
graphical, introspective piece," he
said. "I wanted to write myself back
into the writing life. At first it was
more of an essay and less like the
ater. which is what I'm more used to,
but the story is not only related to
me but connected to the human
drama."
He said that the autobiographical
format forced him to address his
family's reaction to his need for an

organ donor, and the fact that his
kidney failure was caused by 20
years of drug use.
"The main story, though, is the
story of grace," Sundiata said. "The
whole thing is miraculous and com
pletely mysterious. As much sci
ence, thought and logic there is, to
me it's still a story of mystery and
awe and wonder."
Born in New York's Harlem.
Sundiata was involved in the Black
Arts-Black Aesthetic Movement in
the late 19605. According to Lively
Arts, Sundiata writes for print, per
formance, music and theater and
identifies himself as a "ritual poet
rooted in the black church, the black
arts movement and the black avant
garde."
Currently a professor at the Eu
gene Lang College of the New
School University in New York City,
Sundiata has recorded and released
his own music for Righteous Babe,
the record label of his former stu
dent Ani DiFranco.
His other theatrical works in
clude "The Circle Unbroken is a
Hard Bop," which toured national
ly. In March, he will bring "blessing
the boats" to the Apollo Theater in
New York City.
Sundiata has used "blessing the

boats" to raise awareness of kidney
disease and treatment as well as
organ donation and transplant. In
addition to his public performances,
he also lectures about organ trans
plantation, kidney disease and other
health issues especially focusing on
cultural and minority issues.
As one of the three artists in resi
dence this quarter for the Institute
for Diversity in the Arts or IDA,
Sundiata is also teaching "Writing
for Performance," a workshop on
spoken word performance.
Georgina Hernandez, associate
director of IDA. said that the insti
tute was interested in Sundiata's ca
pability as both a performer and a
teacher.
"We ask a lot of the artists in res
idence â€” they have to be commit
ted to engaging the community with
their art as well as teaching," she
said. "It's a tall but Sekou fits
the bill beautifully."
During his quarter on campus,
Sundiata will be gathering informa
tion for his newest multimedia pro
ject, "The America Project," which
will explore what it means to be an
individual and an American citizen
in a changing, complex world. He
will also be conducting activities
with senior citizens in East Palo
Alto.
On Feb. 14, Sundiata will hold an
"Informance" at the Mountain View
Community School of Music and
Arts, sponsored by the school and
Lively Arts.
