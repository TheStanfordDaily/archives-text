Poet Sekou Sundiata performed
"blessing the boats," a one-man
multimedia performance of his
near-death experiences on Saturday
night at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Sundiata. a resident artist this quar
ter at Stanford, set poetry, prose and
comedy to a background of music
and video to tell the story of his kid
ney failure, organ transplant and
near-fatal car accident.
"We looked at his work, and we
were incredibly intrigued by his per
formances and interested in him. so
we came together to host him here."
said Lois Wagner, executive direc
tor of Stanford Lively Arts, which
presented the performance in con
junction with the Committee for
Black Performing Arts. "Sekou is a
really intelligent, sensitive human
being and he's able to express his
emotions and experiences so well."
"blessing the boats." directed by
Rhodessa Jones, addresses Sundia
ta's illness, transplant and accident,
all of which occurred in a five-year
period.
Sundiata was diagnosed with kid

a live donor transplant from a friend
in 1999. The following year, he
broke his neck in a car accident. The
performance describes the way his
illness exiled his body and spirit, as
well as his struggle to return to
health.
Through mixed media, Sundiata
weaves the ideas of family, friends,
art, life and death into his personal
story.
A post-performance discussion,
moderated by Drama Prof. Harry
Elam. was open to the public imme
diately after the show. Sundiata said
that "blessing the boats." which has
been performed every year since
2(X)2, was unlike anything he had
written or performed before.
"This is my first solely autobio
graphical, introspective piece," he
said. "I wanted to write myself back
into the writing life. At first it was
more of an essay and less like the
ater. which is what I'm more used to,
but the story is not only related to
me but connected to the human
drama."
He said that the autobiographical
format forced him to address his
family's reaction to his need for an
