# A 						Break From the Bubble
## Let's talk about class 
### 
Anyone who read my recent
column on homophobia and
the word "faggot" will cor
rectly deduce I am unafraid of ad
dressing serious, complicated and
sometimes controversial topics. For
my now-regular column, I want to
take "A Break from the Bubble" —
that is, to help Stanford engage in a
dialogue on often-serious matters. I
don't pretend to know the answers.
My hope is that bringing these top-

ics to light may
encourage our
community to
think and talk
more about the
issues we face as
students and as
human beings.
With that,
let's face it. In a
world of "haves"
and "have-nots,"

Stanford students are "haves." Al
though many of us come from dif
ferent socioeconomic backgrounds,
the second we cruise down Palm
Drive onto campus, we cease to be
anything other than highly privi
leged.
Perhaps because of the insular
world we exist in, Stanford lacks a
strong dialogue on issues of class
and socioeconomics. In our fresh
man dorms we gain wonderful op
portunities for lengthy discussions
on race, sexuality and gender issues.
But often left out of this mix is an
examination of issues of class and
the implications this has both here
at Stanford and in the real world.
The town I grew up in was rural,
beautiful and ... 99 percent white.
Racial differences weren't a divisive
issue for my community, but socioe
conomic differences sure were. For
me and other students from racially
homogeneous but socio-economi
cally diverse regions, our campus'
lack of a dialogue on class can be
striking.

It's easy to see why. In our insu
lated academic world, we gripe
about how far we have to walk to
class, complain that the gym isn't
open late enough and stress about a
test the next day. For millions of
Americans, their concerns are how
far they have to walk to work, that
the community clinic isn't open late
enough and they stress about the
rent due the next day.
Even on campus, many students
may look just as socio-economically
well-off as everyone else, but they
aren't. For them, and even more lor
the students who do come from
privileged backgrounds, Stanford
should encourage a dialogue on
these issues.
Some students have cars (and
some mighty nice ones — my dorm's
parking lot last year had more luxury
cars than the private golf club I
worked at in high school). Others
don't. Some students have to work,
often as much as 20 hours a week, to
afford the privilege of a Stanford ed
ucation. Others spend those hours at
the gym, at the mall, or out on the
lawn working on their tans.
There's nothing wrong with this
— it's a fact of life that differences
in class will always exist. But we are
doing ourselves a disservice by con
veniently forgetting that these dif
ferences do exist, if for no other rea
son than because as soon as our
diplomas are conferred and we
head out into the "real world," we'll
be facing them daily.
Differences in socioeconomic
status are not as visually apparent as
differences in race or gender, but
for many individuals, communities
and societies, they are just as promi
nent and problematic.
