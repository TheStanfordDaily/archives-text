## Fade Into Bolivian It's not a sport, but a day on the links certainly doesn't 'suck' 
### 
Despite an ominous e-mail from Stan
ford Cross Country Coach Andrew
Gerard telling me that "golf sucks," I
returned to the Stanford Golf Course on Fri
day afternoon with my buddies Freddie,

Rusty and birthday boy Jim
Grau. While it's undoubted
ly true that running repeat 1
km intervals on a golf course
at 7:30 a.m. on Mondays in
the fall actually does "suck,"
in stark contrast, playing golf
on a balmy Friday afternoon
is quite enjoyable. Thus,
Coach Gerard is factually in
correct in his assertion that
"golf sucks."

Foremost, although covered ad nauseum
by other, far more highly qualified sports
columnists, my Friday afternoon golf adven
ture reaffirmed to me that golf is definitely
not a sport. Was I physically tired after the
round? No. Was I drunker than John Daly
during the round? Possibly. Any activity
where my performance improves because
I'm drinking a Coors Light during the pro
cess (read: bowling, pool and golf) is auto
matically not a sport. It is more representa
tive of a lifestyle of leisure.
Moreover, some people have made the
faulty argument that golf is actually a skill.
However, this is incorrect as well, as perfor
mance on the golf course is inversely propor
tional to the amount of time I spend on the
range. Tiger Woods should clearly spend less
time on the range with self-anointed swing
guru Butch Harmon and more time cloistered
in his palatial estate with his hot Swedish
nanny. Last time I checked, his hot Swedish
nanny was interested in starting a family with
Tiger, while Butch merely wants a platonic re
lationship.
The most important part of enjoying a golf
round is seeing as much of the golf course as
possible. Thus, in my best Jean Van de Velde
impression, I like to chunk bunker shots and
spray balls into the water while carding triple
bogey sevens (on good holes). Should I ever
have the opportunity to drop 400 dollars and
play Pebble Beach (in reality, I would rather
spend one-tenth the money and play Pacific
Grove), you can bet that I'm going to be hitting
shots all over the course — into the water, the
rough and Maseratis in the parking lot. Some
might argue that this shows a lack of skill. In re
ality, I really just want to get my money's
worth. But, as an unemployed political science
major and hack sports columnist, the probabil
ity of my ever playing Pebble Beach is minis
cule at best.
Call me a traditionalist, but I'm sick of the
technology that has infiltrated the golfing
world. In my bag you can find vintage 1950's
era Wilson Irons, coupled with real persim
mon woods. With a clubface roughly one
fourth the size of modern clubs, these sticks
put me at a distinct advantage when I play
against my friends — since I tend to shank the
ball so often, I get to explore more of the
course.
Finally, I'd like to introduce Daily readers
to my housemate and golfing partner Russ
Martin, who used thermodynamics arcana as a
means of describing his golf game (he's a red
head and he's single ladies!). Thus, after his
poorly struck tee-shot somehow managed to
avoid the creek on the par-3, eighth hole Rusty
made the following observation: "It's [the
shot] like a state function: whether it gets there
via dW or dQ, it's all about the dH moth
erf****r!" In describing his comment later,
Rusty made it clear that dH is the differential
enthalpy, and that the change in the state func
tion is independent of the path. In summation,
apparently Rusty was saying that the manner
in which his ball tlew over the creek doesn't
matter: it's that his shot stayed dry and arrived


Neil Davis
safely on the other side of the creek.
Why somebody would make
such a dorky observation is be
yond me, and I certainly don't un
derstand his comment. But. for all
the chemical engineers who read
my column, there's the first — and

hopefully only — time that ther
modynamics will ever be used in
reference to golf. Hope you all en
joyed this groundbreaking occa
sion.

not a sport. Was I physically tired after the
round? No. Was I drunker than John Daly
during the round? Possibly. Any activity
where my performance improves because
I'm drinking a Coors Light during the pro
cess (read: bowling, pool and golf) is auto
matically not a sport. It is more representa
tive of a lifestyle of leisure.
Moreover, some people have made the
faulty argument that golf is actually a skill.
However, this is incorrect as well, as perfor
mance on the golf course is inversely propor
tional to the amount of time I spend on the
range. Tiger Woods should clearly spend less
time on the range with self-anointed swing
guru Butch Harmon and more time cloistered
in his palatial estate with his hot Swedish
nanny. Last time I checked, his hot Swedish
nanny was interested in starting a family with
Tiger, while Butch merely wants a platonic re
lationship.
The most important part of enjoying a golf
round is seeing as much of the golf course as
possible. Thus, in my best Jean Van de Velde
impression, I like to chunk bunker shots and
spray balls into the water while carding triple
bogey sevens (on good holes). Should I ever
have the opportunity to drop 400 dollars and
play Pebble Beach (in reality, I would rather
spend one-tenth the money and play Pacific
Grove), you can bet that I'm going to be hitting
shots all over the course — into the water, the
rough and Maseratis in the parking lot. Some
might argue that this shows a lack of skill. In re
ality, I really just want to get my money's
worth. But, as an unemployed political science
major and hack sports columnist, the probabil
ity of my ever playing Pebble Beach is minis
cule at best.
Call me a traditionalist, but I'm sick of the
technology that has infiltrated the golfing
world. In my bag you can find vintage 1950's
era Wilson Irons, coupled with real persim
mon woods. With a clubface roughly one
fourth the size of modern clubs, these sticks
put me at a distinct advantage when I play
against my friends — since I tend to shank the
ball so often, I get to explore more of the
course.
Finally, I'd like to introduce Daily readers
to my housemate and golfing partner Russ
Martin, who used thermodynamics arcana as a
means of describing his golf game (he's a red
head and he's single ladies!). Thus, after his
poorly struck tee-shot somehow managed to
avoid the creek on the par-3, eighth hole Rusty
made the following observation: "It's [the
shot] like a state function: whether it gets there
via dW or dQ, it's all about the dH moth
erf****r!" In describing his comment later,
Rusty made it clear that dH is the differential
enthalpy, and that the change in the state func
tion is independent of the path. In summation,
apparently Rusty was saying that the manner
in which his ball tlew over the creek doesn't
matter: it's that his shot stayed dry and arrived

safely on the other side of the creek.
Why somebody would make
such a dorky observation is be
yond me, and I certainly don't un
derstand his comment. But. for all
the chemical engineers who read
my column, there's the first — and

hopefully only — time that ther
modynamics will ever be used in
reference to golf. Hope you all en
joyed this groundbreaking occa
sion.

Despite an ominous e-mail from Stan
ford Cross Country Coach Andrew
Gerard telling me that "golf sucks," I
returned to the Stanford Golf Course on Fri
day afternoon with my buddies Freddie,

Rusty and birthday boy Jim
Grau. While it's undoubted
ly true that running repeat 1
km intervals on a golf course
at 7:30 a.m. on Mondays in
the fall actually does "suck,"
in stark contrast, playing golf
on a balmy Friday afternoon
is quite enjoyable. Thus,
Coach Gerard is factually in
correct in his assertion that
"golf sucks."

Foremost, although covered ad nauseum
by other, far more highly qualified sports
columnists, my Friday afternoon golf adven
ture reaffirmed to me that golf is definitely
not a sport. Was I physically tired after the
round? No. Was I drunker than John Daly
during the round? Possibly. Any activity
where my performance improves because
I'm drinking a Coors Light during the pro
cess (read: bowling, pool and golf) is auto
matically not a sport. It is more representa
tive of a lifestyle of leisure.
