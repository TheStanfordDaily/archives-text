# Softball opens season with three wins at home
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
With freshmen occupying five of the last six
spots in the Stanford softball team's lineup. Pa
cific and Santa Clara might have only expected
a battle from the Cardinal's top three hitters.
But the Cardinal provided offensive punches
throughout the lineup, opening the season with
three wins in four games as part of the Stanford
Classic. Stanford defeated Santa Clara 9-0,19-4
and defeated Pacific 5-0 before falling 4-3 in the
final game of the season-opening tournament.
Batting cleanup, freshman right fielder Anna
Beardman drove in the Cardinal's first run of
the year with a clean single up the middle in her
first at-bat.
Small-frame freshman second baseman Tri
cia Aggaboa, who batted fifth in both Saturday
games, knocked in two runs against the Broncos
(1-5) and proved the swiftness of her swing
against the Tigers (4-2), going 2-for-4 at the
plate.
Freshman righthander Becky McCullough
made an impact on the mound as well, notching

her first collegiate win Saturday against Santa
Clara.
"Our freshmen contributed a lot this week
end, obviously, along with our six seniors," ju
nior Lauren Lappin said. "We have a lot of com
petition on this team. The freshmen are pushing
everyone to be a lot better and to get better in
every practice and game."
This isn't to say that the freshmen stole the
show, however. Stanford's established stars
shined in the first weekend of play.
"Our freshman are going to have to step up
and contribute all year, but this is going to be a
team effort," Stanford head coach John
Rittman said. "We need all 20 of our players to
step up when they're called on."
Junior Laura Severson showed her potential
to be another Dana Sorensen — Stanford's
since-graduated ace last season. Against a
weaker Santa Clara squad, the right
righthander dominated. 9-0. She recorded her
second shutout with a 5-0 blanking of Pacific.
Junior centerfielder Catalina Morris got off
to a strong start, hitting two homeruns on Fri
day. Morris led off the third inning with a solo

shot to right-center and hammered her second
of the game with a runner on to almost the same
spot.
"They were both inside but one was low, one
was high." Morris said of the different pitches
she saw. "1 think one was a drop, one was a
rise."
Lappin picked up where she left off last sea
son, going 4-for-4 with six RBIs and four runs
scored (including two deep homeruns to left)
against the Broncos on Saturday. Lappin fol
lowed that up with a good day at the plate
against Pacific's Kristen Allen, going 2-for-4.
"I was a little more comfortable and confi
dent during the last four at-bats," Lappin said.
"I settled in after the first couple of bats."
Natalie King silenced the Cardinal bats on
Sunday.
"She kept it away from us and didn't really
pitch anybody inside, so we had to be disci
plined to go with the pitch," Morris said. "She
also threw a lot of balls so it was basically just

discipline; getting your pitch and
going with good pitches is what we
needed to do."
Having won three games
apiece. Pacific and Stanford bat
tled it out for most of the game,
each trying to make a significant
scratch on the scoreboard.
After the Tigers took a 1 -0 lead,
Severson settled down and kept
the Cardinal in the game with a
string of 1-2-3 innings. After King
walked two batters in the fourth,
senior Leah Nelson drove in two
with a triple to rightfield.
But Pacific tied it up 2-2 two in
nings later. The Tigers then took a
two-run lead heading into the bot
tom of the seventh when RBl
threat Gina Carbonato laced a
two-run double to center.
Stanford made a decent at
tempt at a comeback in the last
frame of the game. Freshman
Michelle Smith hit the ball hard

into the outfield to take second.
One walk later. Lappin brought
the Cardinal within one with a sin
gle to left. But a fielder's choice
helped end a late-inning rally and
King was able to shut the door on
Stanford, 4-3.
"Natalie threw a lot harder and
faster than the other pitchers we saw
this weekend," Lappin said. "1 think
that was an adjustment, adjusting to
the speed. We just need to be a little
better about sitting on the same pitch,
going with an outside pitcher. That's
what we needed to do against King,
and we weren't that successful
throughout the game [until the end]."
Even with the loss, the Stanford
Classic was a promising start to the
season.
"It was good to get out and get
a lot of runs scored and get every
body some action this weekend,"
Rittman said. "We're just looking
to improve and build on this week
end for next weekend."
"We definitely saw some things
we needed to work on but I think
we also did a lot of good things,"
Morris said. "It's a good starting
point for the rest of the season."

throughout the game [until the end]."
Even with the loss, the Stanford
Classic was a promising start to the
season.
"It was good to get out and get
a lot of runs scored and get every
body some action this weekend,"
Rittman said. "We're just looking
to improve and build on this week
end for next weekend."
"We definitely saw some things
we needed to work on but I think
we also did a lot of good things,"
Morris said. "It's a good starting
point for the rest of the season."
With freshmen occupying five of the last six
spots in the Stanford softball team's lineup. Pa
cific and Santa Clara might have only expected
a battle from the Cardinal's top three hitters.
But the Cardinal provided offensive punches
throughout the lineup, opening the season with
three wins in four games as part of the Stanford
Classic. Stanford defeated Santa Clara 9-0,19-4
and defeated Pacific 5-0 before falling 4-3 in the
final game of the season-opening tournament.
Batting cleanup, freshman right fielder Anna
Beardman drove in the Cardinal's first run of
the year with a clean single up the middle in her
first at-bat.
Small-frame freshman second baseman Tri
cia Aggaboa, who batted fifth in both Saturday
games, knocked in two runs against the Broncos
(1-5) and proved the swiftness of her swing
against the Tigers (4-2), going 2-for-4 at the
plate.
Freshman righthander Becky McCullough
made an impact on the mound as well, notching

her first collegiate win Saturday against Santa
Clara.
"Our freshmen contributed a lot this week
end, obviously, along with our six seniors," ju
nior Lauren Lappin said. "We have a lot of com
petition on this team. The freshmen are pushing
everyone to be a lot better and to get better in
every practice and game."
This isn't to say that the freshmen stole the
show, however. Stanford's established stars
shined in the first weekend of play.
"Our freshman are going to have to step up
and contribute all year, but this is going to be a
team effort," Stanford head coach John
Rittman said. "We need all 20 of our players to
step up when they're called on."
Junior Laura Severson showed her potential
to be another Dana Sorensen — Stanford's
since-graduated ace last season. Against a
weaker Santa Clara squad, the right
righthander dominated. 9-0. She recorded her
second shutout with a 5-0 blanking of Pacific.
Junior centerfielder Catalina Morris got off
to a strong start, hitting two homeruns on Fri
day. Morris led off the third inning with a solo

shot to right-center and hammered her second
of the game with a runner on to almost the same
spot.
"They were both inside but one was low, one
was high." Morris said of the different pitches
she saw. "1 think one was a drop, one was a
rise."
Lappin picked up where she left off last sea
son, going 4-for-4 with six RBIs and four runs
scored (including two deep homeruns to left)
against the Broncos on Saturday. Lappin fol
lowed that up with a good day at the plate
against Pacific's Kristen Allen, going 2-for-4.
"I was a little more comfortable and confi
dent during the last four at-bats," Lappin said.
"I settled in after the first couple of bats."
Natalie King silenced the Cardinal bats on
Sunday.
"She kept it away from us and didn't really
pitch anybody inside, so we had to be disci
plined to go with the pitch," Morris said. "She
also threw a lot of balls so it was basically just

needed to do."
Having won three games
apiece. Pacific and Stanford bat
tled it out for most of the game,
each trying to make a significant
scratch on the scoreboard.
After the Tigers took a 1 -0 lead,
Severson settled down and kept
the Cardinal in the game with a
string of 1-2-3 innings. After King
walked two batters in the fourth,
senior Leah Nelson drove in two
with a triple to rightfield.
But Pacific tied it up 2-2 two in
nings later. The Tigers then took a
two-run lead heading into the bot
tom of the seventh when RBl
threat Gina Carbonato laced a
two-run double to center.
Stanford made a decent at
tempt at a comeback in the last
frame of the game. Freshman
Michelle Smith hit the ball hard

into the outfield to take second.
One walk later. Lappin brought
the Cardinal within one with a sin
gle to left. But a fielder's choice
helped end a late-inning rally and
King was able to shut the door on
Stanford, 4-3.
"Natalie threw a lot harder and
faster than the other pitchers we saw
this weekend," Lappin said. "1 think
that was an adjustment, adjusting to
the speed. We just need to be a little
better about sitting on the same pitch,
going with an outside pitcher. That's
what we needed to do against King,
and we weren't that successful
throughout the game [until the end]."
