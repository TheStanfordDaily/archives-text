# Out of reach: Baseball drops two of three
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
FULLERTON, Calif. — Maybe it was the home-field advan
tage, or the pre-game fanfare of presenting the National Cham
pionship trophy. Maybe it was the loud, show-no-mercy fans.
Maybe it was their own gixxJ pitching, or perhaps it was the Car
dinal's poor hitting.
Whatever the reason, the No. 3 defending NCAA Champion
Cal State-Fullerton Titans (2-1) took two out of three from the
No. 6 Stanford baseball squad, winning games one and two, 5-3
and 4-3, respectively, before faltering in Sunday's 15-10
marathon.
The first two games of the series pitted the Stanford hitters
against chilly night air and strong left-handed pitchers, and the
Cardinal failed to rise to the occasion. Stanford redeemed itself
on Sunday with contributions from every place in the lineup, but

by then the series was lost and the Cardinal headed home with a
4-2 overall record.
"ITiey're not ranked third for no reason," Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess said. "[The series loss] was a combination
of both things: they have good pitching, but we weren't swinging
the bats real well."
The Cardinal bats weren't exactly asleep Friday night — they
just weren't hitting anything. Fullerton starting lefty Ricky
Romero fanned seven Stanford batters, while reliever Adam Jor
genson picked up four strikeouts. Only three Cardinal players
managed a base knock in the cold, pitcher-friendly weather: ju
nior Jed Lowrie, junior Chris Lewis and sophomore Adam Sorgi.
To Stanford's credit, the team capitalized on the Titans' er
rors, picking up two of the squad's three runs with the help of
Fullerton's shaky defense.
"That's to be expected from the defense, especially infielders,
early in the season," Marquess said.

But the Titans more than made up for those gifts to the Car
dinal by scattering five hits off of junior starter Mark Romanczuk
and taking advantage of the five walks and two plunked batters
by Romanczuk and his replacement, sophomore Matt Leva.
On Saturday, the second member of the Titans' all-lefty start
ing rotation, Ryan Schreppel, stifled the Stanford offense once
again, allowing only three hits in six innings. The three relievers
that followed Schreppel were even stingier, giving up just two
walks.
Junior John Mayberry, Jr. highlighted the Cardinal's offen
sive effort in the game, when he absolutely drilled a Schreppel of
fering in the fourth inning. The ball sailed high enough and far
enough over the leftfield wall that no one saw the moonshot come
back to earth.
"I wish we could get two for distance," Marquess joked after

After the offense's performance on
Friday and Saturday, there were ques

could muster the might to avoid a
sweep. Marquess' answer to those ques

raised a few eyebrows.

around the five-hole this season, was

dered his starting job in centerfield to
sophomore Ryan Seawell for the first
three innings of game.
It worked. TTie first five batters got
on base and scored, and Lewis hit a solo
shot all before the second out. Lewis
nabbed his first career two-homer game
an inning later, just two batters after Mi
naker hit a solo shot.
By the fourth inning, Stanford had
battered six different Fullerton pitchers.
It was exactly what Minaker said
would be necessary for redemption.
"|Fullerton has| done a good job of
coming up in that big spot," he said of
the first two games. "That's what we
needed to do. Get the big hit."
The lead was large enough to put
sophomores Greg Reynolds and Blake
Holler and freshman Erik Davis at ease
on the mound. The trio didn't pitch re
markably well, but the Titans needed a
miracle to chase the Stanford lead.

FULLERTON, Calif. — Maybe it was the home-field advan
tage, or the pre-game fanfare of presenting the National Cham
pionship trophy. Maybe it was the loud, show-no-mercy fans.
Maybe it was their own gixxJ pitching, or perhaps it was the Car
dinal's poor hitting.
Whatever the reason, the No. 3 defending NCAA Champion
Cal State-Fullerton Titans (2-1) took two out of three from the
No. 6 Stanford baseball squad, winning games one and two, 5-3
and 4-3, respectively, before faltering in Sunday's 15-10
marathon.
The first two games of the series pitted the Stanford hitters
against chilly night air and strong left-handed pitchers, and the
Cardinal failed to rise to the occasion. Stanford redeemed itself
on Sunday with contributions from every place in the lineup, but

by then the series was lost and the Cardinal headed home with a
4-2 overall record.
"ITiey're not ranked third for no reason," Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess said. "[The series loss] was a combination
of both things: they have good pitching, but we weren't swinging
the bats real well."
The Cardinal bats weren't exactly asleep Friday night — they
just weren't hitting anything. Fullerton starting lefty Ricky
Romero fanned seven Stanford batters, while reliever Adam Jor
genson picked up four strikeouts. Only three Cardinal players
managed a base knock in the cold, pitcher-friendly weather: ju
nior Jed Lowrie, junior Chris Lewis and sophomore Adam Sorgi.
To Stanford's credit, the team capitalized on the Titans' er
rors, picking up two of the squad's three runs with the help of
Fullerton's shaky defense.
"That's to be expected from the defense, especially infielders,
early in the season," Marquess said.

But the Titans more than made up for those gifts to the Car
dinal by scattering five hits off of junior starter Mark Romanczuk
and taking advantage of the five walks and two plunked batters
by Romanczuk and his replacement, sophomore Matt Leva.
On Saturday, the second member of the Titans' all-lefty start
ing rotation, Ryan Schreppel, stifled the Stanford offense once
again, allowing only three hits in six innings. The three relievers
that followed Schreppel were even stingier, giving up just two
walks.
Junior John Mayberry, Jr. highlighted the Cardinal's offen
sive effort in the game, when he absolutely drilled a Schreppel of
fering in the fourth inning. The ball sailed high enough and far
enough over the leftfield wall that no one saw the moonshot come
back to earth.
"I wish we could get two for distance," Marquess joked after
