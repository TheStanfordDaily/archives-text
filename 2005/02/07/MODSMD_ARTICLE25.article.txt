# Card can't stop the 'Cats
## 
### SCOTT ALIEN MANAGING EDITOR 
TUCSON, Ariz. — Two days after Ike Diogu sin
gle-handedly ended Stanford's streak of road dom
inance at Arizona State, the Cardinal ran into an
Arizona team — two seniors in particular — deter
mined to do the same.
Channing Frye and Salim Stoudamire com
bined for 41 points to lead No. 14 Arizona to a 90-
72 victory over Stanford at McKale Center on Sat
urday. The duo avoided the dubious distinction of
becoming the first four-year players to go winless at
home against a conference opponent under head
coach Lute Olson and ended a three-game losing
streak to the Cardinal in the process.
Arizona (19-4, 9-2 Pac-10) also avenged Stan
ford's 87-76 upset win at Maples Pavilion on Jan. 8,
the spark that ignited a six-game winning streak
that is now an all-too distant memory for the Car
dinal (12-9, 6-5).
In case the Wildcats needed any extra motiva
tion — although a four-year home drought to your
biggest rival seems sufficient — Olson posted the
scores from the 1987-88 season in his team's locker
room before Thursday's win over Cal. Arizona won
its home games by an average of 23.5 points per
game that season.
"The Stanford score in '88 was 90-65," Olson
said after the game. "I told the guys they did a good
job offensively; they need to work on their de
fense."
Stanford's point total and Olson's jovial jab
aside, the Arizona defense was dominant at times.
One minute the Wildcats were stepping in front of
passing lanes (10 steals as part of 17 Stanford
turnovers), and the next they were swatting shots
into the front row (8 blocks).
"When I was trying to go to the basket in the first
half, there were a lot of people there," said junior
guard Dan Grunfeld, who scored a career-high 29
points in the teams' first meeting. "I had my shot
blocked a couple of times. They did a good job
helping. They were very active."
Grunfeld, playing his second game since jam
ming his right wrist in practice, finished with 23

points on 8-for-16 shooting, but most of his damage
came with the game already out of reach.
Frye was particularly disruptive on the defen
sive end, blocking four shots to go along with 15
points and 13 rebounds. Arizona junior Hassan
Adams added two blocks, and despite not produc
ing any of his patented highlight-reel dunks, fin
ished with 13 points and three rebounds.
Stoudamire stole the show on the offensive end,
rebounding from a slow start to score a game-high
26 points. The senior, who is making his case for
Player of the Year honors, drilled five of his nine
shots from beyond the arc.
"The bottom line is Arizona is really, really
good," head coach Trent Johnson said. "TTiey had
some guys coming out today with a lot of energy.
They made some shots early, they got some separa
tion and we had to play from behind. That's not
what we do best."
Stanford led 14-11 with 12:18 to play in the first
half, when Arizona's Chris Rodgers drained the
second of his three three-pointers en route to 13
points off the bench. The Cardinal would not lead
again and appeared to be facing a double-digit half
time deficit after an Ivan Radenovic bucket with 50
seconds to play put Arizona ahead by 13.
But junior point guard Chris Hernandez
drained a three-pointer and, with the Wildcats
holding for the last shot, junior Jason Haas darted
in front of an Arizona pass and converted a lay-up
as the horn sounded to cut the deficit to eight.
Seven minutes into the second half, however,
the lead had doubled and Stanford would trail by
no less than 14 the rest of the way.
"They were a lot more intense," Hernandez
said. "They definitely wanted to end that streak and
they played a good game today."
Hernandez scored 13 points and drained three
three-pointers, but his old buddy Stoudamire kept
him in check with smothering defense to comple
ment his strong shooting night.
"You sucker, you went off," he told Stoudamire
afterward.
Hernandez also shared a few words with one of

his biggest admirers. Olson.
"I told Lute, 'You got us, man.
You got us this time,'" Hernandez
said. "He was like, if you had beaten
me again. I was going to get fired."
Maybe not, but it was clear that
Olson and the Wildcats wanted this
one bad. Unlike last Thursday's loss at
Arizona State, the Cardinal did not
give the game away; they were simply
outplayed.
"It's never easy to lose, but as long
as your effort is good, that's really all
you can control," Grunfeld said.
"It's the ultimate sign of respect
fora program like Arizona and their
coaches to put so much emphasis on
this game," Johnson said.

Arizona team — two seniors in particular — deter
mined to do the same.
Channing Frye and Salim Stoudamire com
bined for 41 points to lead No. 14 Arizona to a 90-
72 victory over Stanford at McKale Center on Sat
urday. The duo avoided the dubious distinction of
becoming the first four-year players to go winless at
home against a conference opponent under head
coach Lute Olson and ended a three-game losing
streak to the Cardinal in the process.
Arizona (19-4, 9-2 Pac-10) also avenged Stan
ford's 87-76 upset win at Maples Pavilion on Jan. 8,
the spark that ignited a six-game winning streak
that is now an all-too distant memory for the Car
dinal (12-9, 6-5).
In case the Wildcats needed any extra motiva
tion — although a four-year home drought to your
biggest rival seems sufficient — Olson posted the
scores from the 1987-88 season in his team's locker
room before Thursday's win over Cal. Arizona won
its home games by an average of 23.5 points per
game that season.
"The Stanford score in '88 was 90-65," Olson
said after the game. "I told the guys they did a good
job offensively; they need to work on their de
fense."
Stanford's point total and Olson's jovial jab
aside, the Arizona defense was dominant at times.
One minute the Wildcats were stepping in front of
passing lanes (10 steals as part of 17 Stanford
turnovers), and the next they were swatting shots
into the front row (8 blocks).
"When I was trying to go to the basket in the first
half, there were a lot of people there," said junior
guard Dan Grunfeld, who scored a career-high 29
points in the teams' first meeting. "I had my shot
blocked a couple of times. They did a good job
helping. They were very active."
Grunfeld, playing his second game since jam
ming his right wrist in practice, finished with 23

points on 8-for-16 shooting, but most of his damage
came with the game already out of reach.
Frye was particularly disruptive on the defen
sive end, blocking four shots to go along with 15
points and 13 rebounds. Arizona junior Hassan
Adams added two blocks, and despite not produc
ing any of his patented highlight-reel dunks, fin
ished with 13 points and three rebounds.
Stoudamire stole the show on the offensive end,
rebounding from a slow start to score a game-high
26 points. The senior, who is making his case for
Player of the Year honors, drilled five of his nine
shots from beyond the arc.
"The bottom line is Arizona is really, really
good," head coach Trent Johnson said. "TTiey had
some guys coming out today with a lot of energy.
They made some shots early, they got some separa
tion and we had to play from behind. That's not
what we do best."
Stanford led 14-11 with 12:18 to play in the first
half, when Arizona's Chris Rodgers drained the
second of his three three-pointers en route to 13
points off the bench. The Cardinal would not lead
again and appeared to be facing a double-digit half
time deficit after an Ivan Radenovic bucket with 50
seconds to play put Arizona ahead by 13.
But junior point guard Chris Hernandez
drained a three-pointer and, with the Wildcats
holding for the last shot, junior Jason Haas darted
in front of an Arizona pass and converted a lay-up
as the horn sounded to cut the deficit to eight.
Seven minutes into the second half, however,
the lead had doubled and Stanford would trail by
no less than 14 the rest of the way.
"They were a lot more intense," Hernandez
said. "They definitely wanted to end that streak and
they played a good game today."
Hernandez scored 13 points and drained three
three-pointers, but his old buddy Stoudamire kept
him in check with smothering defense to comple
ment his strong shooting night.
"You sucker, you went off," he told Stoudamire
afterward.
Hernandez also shared a few words with one of

his biggest admirers. Olson.
"I told Lute, 'You got us, man.
You got us this time,'" Hernandez
said. "He was like, if you had beaten
me again. I was going to get fired."
Maybe not, but it was clear that
Olson and the Wildcats wanted this
one bad. Unlike last Thursday's loss at
Arizona State, the Cardinal did not
give the game away; they were simply
outplayed.
"It's never easy to lose, but as long
as your effort is good, that's really all
you can control," Grunfeld said.
"It's the ultimate sign of respect
fora program like Arizona and their
coaches to put so much emphasis on
this game," Johnson said.
