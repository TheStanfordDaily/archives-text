# Swimmers soak Trojans
## 
### SAMUEL CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In front of a large crowd of parents, the No. 2 Stan
ford men's swimming and diving team (5-0, 3-0 Pacific
-10 Conference) dismantled No. 7 Southern California
(4-2,2-1 Pac-10) at the Avery Aquatic Center on Satur
day, decisively winning its last home meet of the season
179-116 against a talented Trojan lineup.
As they have in their previous wins, the Cardinal
relay contingent started things off with a win in the 400-
yard medley relay, as senior co-captain Jayme Cramer,
junior Ricky Eddy, freshman Daniel Beal and sopho
more Kyle Ransom finished with a combined time of
three minutes ;ind 15.37 seconds. Two teams in the relay
finished with times qualifying the squads for NCAA "B"
berths.
Unlike the Cardinal's previous meets, however, the
visiting Trojans responded. Following the opening
relay, swimmers set up for the longest event of the meet,
the 1650-yard freestyle. The field included Trojan
sophomore and Olympic Silver Medalist Larsen Jensen.
Already the American record holder in the 800-
meter and 1500-meter freestyle events, Jensen did not
disappoint in the mile-long event of sixty-six laps, win
ning with an NCAA "A" time of 15:03.79. However,
Jensen was not alone in his excellent swim in the event.
Stanford sophomore Shaun Phillips provided exhaus
tive competition Jensen could not shake off until the
very end, as Phillips finished second in 15:06.67. Fol
lowing Phillips were two Stanford swimmers, junior
Michael McLean and freshman Noa Sakamoto, who
took the third and fourth positions, respectively.
Following the 1650 was perhaps the most exciting
event of the meet, in which Cardinal sophomore Andy
Grant shot off the blocks and proceeded to set a new

pool record in the 200-yard freestyle, finishing with a
blazing 1:34.54, good enough to finish ahead of the
NCAA "A" cut time by nearly two seconds. Cramer fin
ished second, while senior Thomas Brown finished with
in the ensuing pack of three swimmers who touched the
wall within one second of each other.
"Andy did a great job and really stepped up against
USC," Brown said. "The whole team feeds and builds
off of one another, so great swimming by one guy usual
ly translates into great swimming for the entire team."
Grant said he was surprised by the fashion of his win
and the way the team performed.
"We expected much closer meets against all those top
teams," Grant said. "Don't get me wrong, they all swam
fast, but we were always just one step ahead."
Despite the initial promise of a close match after the
first two events, Stanford pulled away, going on to win
all but one of the last 12 swimming events. In the fourth
event, the 100-yard backstroke, the Cardinal completed
their first 1 -2-3 sweep of the afternoon, with sophomore
Hongzhe Sun leading the way in 48.37. Juniors Tobias
Oriwol and Mark Stephens followed with times of 49.96
and 50.45, respectively. Sun went on to win the 200-yard
backstroke event as well.
Other Stanford winners were senior Gary Marshall
in the 100- and 2(X)-yard breaststroke events; senior co
captain Matt McDonald in the lead of yet another 1 -2-3
sweep in the 200-yard butterfly; sophomore Ben Wild
man-Tobriner, who along with Kyle Ransom, led a
Stanford 1-2 finish in both the 50- and 100-yard
freestyle events; and junior Michael McLean in his 1-2
finish with Phillips in the 500-yard freestyle over
Jensen. Co-captains Cramer and McDonald combined
to form a formidable 1-2 punch in the 100-yard butter
fly, finishing two seconds better than the next finisher
— a considerable margin considering the distance of

the event.
"This meet really solidified our confidence going
into the toughest meets of the year," McDonald said.
"We're really starting to believe in the greatness of
this team and trusting our teammates to come
through in big situations."
In the last individual event of the meet dominated so
far by Stanford swimmers, Jensen's fellow USC
Olympian Ous Mellouli touched the wall first in the 200-
yard individual medley, the second and last time any
Trojan swimmer would accomplish such a feat.
In the last event of the meet, the 400-yard freestyle
relay, the Cardinal capped an impressive day with a de

cisive set of swims by the Stanford "A"and "B" teams,
with the latter finishing nearly six seconds before the
first USC finish.
"Meet after meet our confidence has continued to
build," Brown said. "Going into the championship sea
son, our team is ready to surprise a lot of people and
show the country what Stanford swimming is all about."
Stanford will complete its regular season with Big
Swim against Cal at Berkeley on Feb. 19. Following this
dual meet, the Pacific-10 Conference Championships
will be held in Long Beach, Calif, from March 2 to 5, and
NCAA Championships will be held March 24 to 26 to
determine the final dual-meet rankings.

"Meet after meet our confidence has continued to
build," Brown said. "Going into the championship sea
son, our team is ready to surprise a lot of people and
show the country what Stanford swimming is all about."
Stanford will complete its regular season with Big
Swim against Cal at Berkeley on Feb. 19. Following this
dual meet, the Pacific-10 Conference Championships
will be held in Long Beach, Calif, from March 2 to 5, and
NCAA Championships will be held March 24 to 26 to

Junior Mark Stephens finished third in tfie 100-yard backstroke as part of No. 2 Stanford's dominating 179-116 win
over No. 7 USC on Saturday. The Cardinal swept the top three spots in the event.
In front of a large crowd of parents, the No. 2 Stan
ford men's swimming and diving team (5-0, 3-0 Pacific
-10 Conference) dismantled No. 7 Southern California
(4-2,2-1 Pac-10) at the Avery Aquatic Center on Satur
day, decisively winning its last home meet of the season
179-116 against a talented Trojan lineup.
As they have in their previous wins, the Cardinal
relay contingent started things off with a win in the 400-
yard medley relay, as senior co-captain Jayme Cramer,
junior Ricky Eddy, freshman Daniel Beal and sopho
more Kyle Ransom finished with a combined time of
three minutes ;ind 15.37 seconds. Two teams in the relay
finished with times qualifying the squads for NCAA "B"
berths.
Unlike the Cardinal's previous meets, however, the
visiting Trojans responded. Following the opening
relay, swimmers set up for the longest event of the meet,
the 1650-yard freestyle. The field included Trojan
sophomore and Olympic Silver Medalist Larsen Jensen.
Already the American record holder in the 800-
meter and 1500-meter freestyle events, Jensen did not
disappoint in the mile-long event of sixty-six laps, win
ning with an NCAA "A" time of 15:03.79. However,
Jensen was not alone in his excellent swim in the event.
Stanford sophomore Shaun Phillips provided exhaus
tive competition Jensen could not shake off until the
very end, as Phillips finished second in 15:06.67. Fol
lowing Phillips were two Stanford swimmers, junior
Michael McLean and freshman Noa Sakamoto, who
took the third and fourth positions, respectively.
Following the 1650 was perhaps the most exciting
event of the meet, in which Cardinal sophomore Andy
Grant shot off the blocks and proceeded to set a new

pool record in the 200-yard freestyle, finishing with a
blazing 1:34.54, good enough to finish ahead of the
NCAA "A" cut time by nearly two seconds. Cramer fin
ished second, while senior Thomas Brown finished with
in the ensuing pack of three swimmers who touched the
wall within one second of each other.
"Andy did a great job and really stepped up against
USC," Brown said. "The whole team feeds and builds
off of one another, so great swimming by one guy usual
ly translates into great swimming for the entire team."
Grant said he was surprised by the fashion of his win
and the way the team performed.
"We expected much closer meets against all those top
teams," Grant said. "Don't get me wrong, they all swam
fast, but we were always just one step ahead."
Despite the initial promise of a close match after the
first two events, Stanford pulled away, going on to win
all but one of the last 12 swimming events. In the fourth
event, the 100-yard backstroke, the Cardinal completed
their first 1 -2-3 sweep of the afternoon, with sophomore
Hongzhe Sun leading the way in 48.37. Juniors Tobias
Oriwol and Mark Stephens followed with times of 49.96
and 50.45, respectively. Sun went on to win the 200-yard
backstroke event as well.
Other Stanford winners were senior Gary Marshall
in the 100- and 2(X)-yard breaststroke events; senior co
captain Matt McDonald in the lead of yet another 1 -2-3
sweep in the 200-yard butterfly; sophomore Ben Wild
man-Tobriner, who along with Kyle Ransom, led a
Stanford 1-2 finish in both the 50- and 100-yard
freestyle events; and junior Michael McLean in his 1-2
finish with Phillips in the 500-yard freestyle over
Jensen. Co-captains Cramer and McDonald combined
to form a formidable 1-2 punch in the 100-yard butter
fly, finishing two seconds better than the next finisher
— a considerable margin considering the distance of

the event.
"This meet really solidified our confidence going
into the toughest meets of the year," McDonald said.
"We're really starting to believe in the greatness of
this team and trusting our teammates to come
through in big situations."
In the last individual event of the meet dominated so
far by Stanford swimmers, Jensen's fellow USC
Olympian Ous Mellouli touched the wall first in the 200-
yard individual medley, the second and last time any
Trojan swimmer would accomplish such a feat.
In the last event of the meet, the 400-yard freestyle
relay, the Cardinal capped an impressive day with a de

cisive set of swims by the Stanford "A"and "B" teams,
with the latter finishing nearly six seconds before the
first USC finish.

build," Brown said. "Going into the championship sea
