### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Few places provide a nicer setting fora volleyball match
than Hawaii, hut two days in Honolulu meant two more losses
for the No. 10 Stanford men's volleyball team, which lost back
to-back matches to No. 3 Hawaii last Thursday and Friday.
In Thursday's match, the Cardinal (3-8, 2-6 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) came close to being the first confer
ence team to defeat the Warriors (7-1,5-0 MPSF) this season.
Junior Ben Rcddy, returning from injury to reclaim his spot
in the starting lineup, led the team with 16 kills in the match.
The Cardinal dropped the first two games of the match be
fore battling back to force a decisive fifth game.
In the first game, the Cardinal jumped out to an early lead.
4-1. Hawaii came back, but Stanford managed to stay within
three or four points and refused to allow the Warriors to pull
away until the end, 30-24.
The second game was less evenly balanced, with Hawaii
pulling ahead early, 17-8. Stanford pulled to within four at 25-
21, but was never able to take the lead and fell 30-24.
Down two games to none, head coach Don Shaw played
with the lineup, putting freshman Matt Ceran in for redshirt ju
nior William Clayton.
Game three started out much like the first, with an early
Cardinal lead that evaporated when the Warriors tied it up at
11. Stanford maintained the upper hand in most of the game
until a Hawaii rally put the Warriors ahead 22-20. The Warrior
lead grew to 25-22, but the Cardinal came back to force a tie at
26-26. Finally, in a streak of kills that turned what was looking
like a Hawaii sweep into anyone's match, Stanford pulled
through to win 30-27.
Fired up by their sizzling comeback, the Cardinal entered
game four with high energy, flying to a 13-6 lead. For the rest of
the game, Stanford's lead hovered around six en route to a 30-
22 victory to tie the match 2-2.
After a series of ties early in the fifth game, the Cardinal
held a 10-8 advantage before the Warriors went on a 5-0 run to
prompt a Stanford timeout. Following a Hawaii timeout after
Stanford pulled to within one at match point, a Cardinal ball
handling error was the deciding factor in a heartbreaking 15-13
loss.
The Cardinal looked to avenge Thursday's tough loss when
they returned to the floor the following evening.
Though Stanford started out with an early lead in the first
game, Hawaii soon swept past them to a 20-14 advantage. The
Cardinal could not mount a comeback, and the Warriors
notched an impressive 30-21 victory.
Hawaii won that game point on a Stanford attack error, a
play that seemed to characterize the game as a whole. The Car
dinal hit just .014 in the game, while the Warriors posted a
strong .448 hitting percentage.
In the second game of the match, Stanford stayed close with
Hawaii, and the score was tied at seven apiece. But the War
riors drew away once again, pulling out to a 16-11 lead. The
Cardinal managed to tie it again at 20-20. but Hawaii edged out
a slight advantage.
Shaw called two timeouts, and Stanford seemed to regain
some momentum, forcing a Warrior timeout after the Cardinal
pulled to within 27-25. However, the Warriors maintained
their lead and ended game two with a 30-26 victory.
Down two games to none once again, all hope was not lost
for the Cardinal, who had been in the same position the previ
ous evening only to come back and force five games. They did
not fare so well Friday.
As Hawaii gained another early 11-6 lead, Shaw sent junior
Nick Manov, who has been out recently with a shoulder injury,
in for Reddy. The substitution did not immediately slow
Hawaii's run, and the Hawaii lead ballooned to 11 at 21-10.
Hawaii won 30-23 to close out the match.
Stanford has a week off until a home match next Friday
against No. 9 Pacific (9-4,3-3 MPSF).
