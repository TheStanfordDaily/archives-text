# Panel discusses Iraq war
## 
### BEA SANFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On a panel called "Cost of War: The Hu
manitarian Crisis in Iraq," members last
night discussed public health concerns re
lated to the U.S. invasion of Iraq.
The panel, which was organized by the
Coalition for Justice in the Middle East, was
a part of a four-week series focusing on Iraq.
Sophomore Olivia Sohns, vice president of
the student group, said it was intended to
counteract false mainstream portrayals of
the war in Iraq.
Panelists said that many Americans arc
unaware of the effects of the American in
vasion.

"Everyone who was supposed to serve
you has failed you," said Les Roberts, an
epidemiologist at John Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health. " The
greatest failure has been the press."
Roberts said he saw the press as a subset
of a larger American mindset: "Our press is
part of our culture, and our culture has col
lectively done this en masse."
Roberts traveled to Iraq last September
with a medical team to calculate some of
the public health issues that arose after the
invasion and published a study upon his re
turn in the British medical journal The
Lancet.
Roberts said the team estimated at least
1(X),(XX) civilians had died at the hands of

U.S. military since the invasion, compared
with the 16.(XM) deaths estimated by the Iraq
Body Count, a Web site that tracks how
many Iraqi civilians have died. He added
that violent deaths were much more com
mon after the U.S. occupation than before.
"If we believed that the people who in
vaded Iraq had a positive motive, than the
news of HX).(XX) deaths should produce a
response of contrition."
While Roberts said that Iraqis expressed
anger toward the U.S. military for their ac
tions in Iraq, he added that they were still
glad to see Saddam Hussein ousted.
"Every Iraqi I dealt with was ecstatic
Saddam was gone," he said. "Every
single one also hated the Americans
for what they had done during the
occupations."
Panel moderator Dr. Robert
Gould, an associate pathologist at
Kaiser Hospital and president of the
San Francisco Bay Area Physicians
for Social Responsibility, said that de
pleted uranium stores left behind by
the U.S. military have also significant
ly worsened public health in Iraq.
Gould said that Iraq has seen an
alleged 4(X) percent rise in cancer
rates since 1991, when the United
States first attacked the country.
He cited military technology as
another force that separates Ameri
cans from understanding the full im
pact of the war.
"We have incredibly highly capa
ble technical arms able to kill from a
distance, so we in the United States
are insulated and cannot tell the im
pacts of these weapons."
Zaid Albanna, an Iraqi who at
tended the panel, said he had seen
Iraqi perceptions of the United
States change dramatically between
the beginning of the invasion and a
year later, during which time he vis
ited Iraq.
"In 2(X)3 people were hopeful,"
Albanna said. "By 2004 they were in
absolute confusion. There was a lot
more anger, and less hope."
Antonia Juhasz, a member of the
International Forum on Globalization,
said that much of the anger had result-

Ed lrom poor reconstruction efforts by
America. She blamed San Francisco
based company Bechtel Corporation,
which was given $680million to rebuild
Iraq, for much of the problem.
She gave as an example the three
sewage plants in Baghdad, none of
which is properly working.
"The water flows through the
pipes untreated, and raw waste lies
untreated in the streets," Juhasz
said.
Juhasz said that $24 billion re
main for reconstruction in Iraq.
However, she said that conditions
needed to change in order for the
money to be spent wisely.
"The funds must be taken away
from the Bush administration,"
Juhasz said. " They should go to a
panel in the United Nations, which is
committed to hiring only Iraqis to
rebuild the country."
Gould also criticized U.S. foreign
policy from a medical standpoint:
"Our whole foreign policy is really
providing extreme danger for the
world in terms of public health."
Juhasz censured the recent elec
tions in Iraq, saying that they met
few international standards for de
mocratic and fair elections.
She said she thought there was a
possibility that the Bush administra
tion would invade Iran.
"They're exceptionally greedy
and power hungry, and I don't put
Iran past them."
Sohns said that student interest in
the four-week series has been
strong.
"We've had good turn-out,"
Sohns said. "The audience has been
really diverse, full of people who
don't normally come."

She gave as an example the three
sewage plants in Baghdad, none of
which is properly working.
"The water flows through the
pipes untreated, and raw waste lies
untreated in the streets," Juhasz
said.
Juhasz said that $24 billion re
main for reconstruction in Iraq.
However, she said that conditions
needed to change in order for the
money to be spent wisely.
"The funds must be taken away
from the Bush administration,"
Juhasz said. " They should go to a
panel in the United Nations, which is
committed to hiring only Iraqis to
rebuild the country."
Gould also criticized U.S. foreign
policy from a medical standpoint:
"Our whole foreign policy is really
providing extreme danger for the
world in terms of public health."
Juhasz censured the recent elec
tions in Iraq, saying that they met
few international standards for de
mocratic and fair elections.
She said she thought there was a
possibility that the Bush administra
tion would invade Iran.
"They're exceptionally greedy
and power hungry, and I don't put
Iran past them."
Sohns said that student interest in
the four-week series has been
strong.
"We've had good turn-out,"
Sohns said. "The audience has been
really diverse, full of people who
don't normally come."
On a panel called "Cost of War: The Hu
manitarian Crisis in Iraq," members last
night discussed public health concerns re
lated to the U.S. invasion of Iraq.
The panel, which was organized by the
Coalition for Justice in the Middle East, was
a part of a four-week series focusing on Iraq.
Sophomore Olivia Sohns, vice president of
the student group, said it was intended to
counteract false mainstream portrayals of
the war in Iraq.
Panelists said that many Americans arc
unaware of the effects of the American in
vasion.

"Everyone who was supposed to serve
you has failed you," said Les Roberts, an
epidemiologist at John Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health. " The
greatest failure has been the press."
Roberts said he saw the press as a subset
of a larger American mindset: "Our press is
part of our culture, and our culture has col
lectively done this en masse."
Roberts traveled to Iraq last September
with a medical team to calculate some of
the public health issues that arose after the
invasion and published a study upon his re
turn in the British medical journal The
Lancet.
Roberts said the team estimated at least
1(X),(XX) civilians had died at the hands of

U.S. military since the invasion, compared
with the 16.(XM) deaths estimated by the Iraq
Body Count, a Web site that tracks how
many Iraqi civilians have died. He added
that violent deaths were much more com
mon after the U.S. occupation than before.
"If we believed that the people who in
vaded Iraq had a positive motive, than the
news of HX).(XX) deaths should produce a
response of contrition."
While Roberts said that Iraqis expressed
anger toward the U.S. military for their ac
tions in Iraq, he added that they were still
glad to see Saddam Hussein ousted.
"Every Iraqi I dealt with was ecstatic
Saddam was gone," he said. "Every
single one also hated the Americans
for what they had done during the
occupations."
Panel moderator Dr. Robert
Gould, an associate pathologist at
Kaiser Hospital and president of the
San Francisco Bay Area Physicians
for Social Responsibility, said that de
pleted uranium stores left behind by
the U.S. military have also significant
ly worsened public health in Iraq.
Gould said that Iraq has seen an
alleged 4(X) percent rise in cancer
rates since 1991, when the United
States first attacked the country.
He cited military technology as
another force that separates Ameri
cans from understanding the full im
pact of the war.
"We have incredibly highly capa
ble technical arms able to kill from a
distance, so we in the United States
are insulated and cannot tell the im
pacts of these weapons."
Zaid Albanna, an Iraqi who at
tended the panel, said he had seen
Iraqi perceptions of the United
States change dramatically between
the beginning of the invasion and a
year later, during which time he vis
ited Iraq.
"In 2(X)3 people were hopeful,"
Albanna said. "By 2004 they were in
absolute confusion. There was a lot
more anger, and less hope."
Antonia Juhasz, a member of the
International Forum on Globalization,
said that much of the anger had result-

Ed lrom poor reconstruction efforts by
America. She blamed San Francisco
based company Bechtel Corporation,
which was given $680million to rebuild
Iraq, for much of the problem.
She gave as an example the three
sewage plants in Baghdad, none of
which is properly working.
