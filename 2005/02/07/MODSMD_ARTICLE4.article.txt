# Police release intruder sketch
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A week alter separate intruders harassed female res
idents of Storey and Burbank houses, efforts to ramp up
campus security are intensifying.
Police suspect Kevin Brewer, a 39-year-old. a painter
from Stockton, Calif., of misdemeanor peeping. They
arrested Brewer as he exited Storey House on Jan. 28
and booked him into the Santa Clara County main jail in
San Jose.
A Storey resident had identified him as the man who
followed her into the women's bathroom and looked
into her stall.
Brewer was released from jail that same weekend,
and as of Friday no court date had been set. Police are
still investigating and cannot release further informa
tion.
The man. who entered an unlocked dorm room in
Burbank in Stern Hall, and groped a female student on
Jan. 29 remains at large, but Stanford police this past
weekend released two sketches based on descriptions
by the victim and a witness.
The sketches show a tall Hispanic man in his early- to
mid-30s and between 5'3" and 5'6" with a chubby build
and short black hair. The man is reported to have spo
ken English with a heavy Spanish accent.
Meanwhile, campus officials and dorm staff have
been working to raise awareness about security issues.

The Police released a sketch of a Hispanic man with a
chubby build and short black hair who reportedly groped
a female student on Jan. 29 and who still remains at large.
"differences |in math skills] remain
across cultures" not across gender.
The forum panelists also discussed
alternative reasons why women may be
outnumbered by men in the sciences.
Boaler said that she considers "the
stereotype threat" a critical obstacle.
Research shows that when a group of
individuals believe that they will do
worse a» a task —a math test for exam
ple—the stereotype in itself causes
ptx>r scores. Boaler believes that the
stereotype also impacts women's par
ticipation in math and sciences at a time
when there is a grave shortage of grad
uates in these fields.
Carol Winograd, an associate pro
fessor of medicine who spoke from the
audience, suggested that the minority
of women in the sciences might be due
to the "ton of feathers" theory, which
posits that a woman might not be able
to point to a specific incident that dis
suades her from pursuing math or sci
ence, but small events or insults eventu
ally build up and overwhelm her ability
to succeed in these subjects.
Laura Savidge, a senior majoring in
electrical engineering, agreed with the
feathers theory.
"There are little things that really
build up: being treated differently, hav
ing fewer women faculty role models.
Women hit a lot more brick walls after
they leave a place like Stanford," she
said.
According to Schiebinger, women
in the sciences have a mixed history.
The first person ever to win two
Nobel Prizes in Science was a woman
(Marie Curie). However, women are
traditionally seen as outsiders in the sci
entific and mathematical worlds. When
Mattel first introduced talking Barbie in
the early IWOs, one of her catchy phras
es was, "Math class is hard. This phrase
was pulled from her repertoire follow
ing complaints from women's groups.
Schiebinger also discussed the research
that the IRWCJ is planning to conduct
on dual career partners. The study will
focus primarily on heterosexual cou
ples in the academic world. Women
tend to marry men who have an equal
or higher level of education while men
seem to have more diverse choices.
Also, academic women who partner
with academic men tend to marry with
in their own field. Schiebinger believes
that these marriage patterns give
women fewer options, which makes it
more difficult for them to take advan
tage of different opportunities.
Schiebinger also complained about
the lack of women faculty in higher ed
ucation. Last year. Harvard offered
tenure to four women and 32 men, she
said.
Summers' words last month are
problematic because they "reinforce
old prejudices," Shiebinger explained.
"But the problem Is not only his
words, but his practices," she added.
There are many possible reasons
why women do not go into math, sci
ence and engineering fields, but in
nate ability is not one of them, the
panel members unanimously agreed.
However, the forum did not provide
definite answers to explain why
there are more men in technical
fields or suggestions about what can
be done to improve the number of
women in these areas.
Summers himself said on the ques
tion of innate ability, "I'd like to be
proven wrong on this one."

Police suspect Kevin Brewer, a 39-year-old. a painter
from Stockton, Calif., of misdemeanor peeping. They
arrested Brewer as he exited Storey House on Jan. 28
and booked him into the Santa Clara County main jail in
San Jose.
A Storey resident had identified him as the man who
followed her into the women's bathroom and looked
into her stall.
Brewer was released from jail that same weekend,
and as of Friday no court date had been set. Police are

"differences |in math skills] remain
across cultures" not across gender.
The forum panelists also discussed
alternative reasons why women may be
outnumbered by men in the sciences.
Boaler said that she considers "the
stereotype threat" a critical obstacle.
Research shows that when a group of
individuals believe that they will do
worse a» a task —a math test for exam
ple—the stereotype in itself causes
ptx>r scores. Boaler believes that the
stereotype also impacts women's par
ticipation in math and sciences at a time
when there is a grave shortage of grad
uates in these fields.
Carol Winograd, an associate pro
fessor of medicine who spoke from the
audience, suggested that the minority
of women in the sciences might be due
to the "ton of feathers" theory, which
posits that a woman might not be able
to point to a specific incident that dis
suades her from pursuing math or sci
ence, but small events or insults eventu
ally build up and overwhelm her ability
to succeed in these subjects.
Laura Savidge, a senior majoring in
electrical engineering, agreed with the
feathers theory.
"There are little things that really
build up: being treated differently, hav
ing fewer women faculty role models.
Women hit a lot more brick walls after
they leave a place like Stanford," she
said.
According to Schiebinger, women
in the sciences have a mixed history.
The first person ever to win two
Nobel Prizes in Science was a woman
(Marie Curie). However, women are
traditionally seen as outsiders in the sci
entific and mathematical worlds. When
Mattel first introduced talking Barbie in
the early IWOs, one of her catchy phras
es was, "Math class is hard. This phrase
was pulled from her repertoire follow
ing complaints from women's groups.
Schiebinger also discussed the research
that the IRWCJ is planning to conduct
on dual career partners. The study will
focus primarily on heterosexual cou
ples in the academic world. Women
tend to marry men who have an equal
or higher level of education while men
seem to have more diverse choices.
Also, academic women who partner
with academic men tend to marry with
in their own field. Schiebinger believes
that these marriage patterns give
women fewer options, which makes it
more difficult for them to take advan
tage of different opportunities.
Schiebinger also complained about
the lack of women faculty in higher ed
ucation. Last year. Harvard offered
tenure to four women and 32 men, she
said.
Summers' words last month are
problematic because they "reinforce
old prejudices," Shiebinger explained.
