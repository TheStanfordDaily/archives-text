# Forum questions Summers' insights
## 
### BETSY CONGDON KILLEEN HANSON 
In response to comments made
by Harvard President Lawrence
Summers, that women may be in
nately worse than men in math and
sciences, the Stanford Institute for
Research on Women and Gender, or
IRWG, sponsored a panel on Friday
with the Faculty Women's Forum to
discuss the issues raised.
In particular, the panel examined
whether or not Summers' words
were supported by scientific evi
dence.
"Summers just didn't have all the
facts. He should not have spoken
without informing himself of the nec
essary information," said Londa
Schiebinger, director of the IRWG.
"We want to address his comments
with data."
The panel event attracted about
100 faculty and students from across
campus and focused on "iniquities in
institutions of higher learning, teach
ing environments that encourage
women in engineering and math,
how gender analysis can bring new
insights to science and psychological
differences in brain processing be
tween men and women" according
to information on the event.
During the course of the discus
sion, the panelists presented and dis
sected different tests and studies per
formed on gender differences.
Ruth O'Hara, assistant professor
of psychiatry and behavioral sci
ences, discussed the study of gender
differences in brain imaging. She stat
ed that while males have six to eight
percent larger brains, there doesn't
appear to be a difference in amounts
of grey and white brain matter. Stud
ies using brain imaging remain too
small tomakeconclusionsabout gen
der differences in cognitive functions

and often have conflicting results.
"The jury is definitely still out
across a broad range of cognitive
tasks," O'Hara said.
Though differences in "innate
ability" have not been determined,
the panelists agreed that the dispro
portionate ratio of men to women in
math and science careers deserves
some further scrutiny. In engineer
ing, Sheri Sheppard, associate profes
sor of mechanical engineering noted
that only 9 percent of engineers are
women even though women make
up 50.5 percent of the general Amer
ican public.
Shepphard presented studies that
suggested that the men and women
who drop out of engineering degrees
tend to do so because of the fast pace,
heavy workload and poor teaching
quality of engineering courses. Be
cause men and women face the same
difficulties, these reasons do not ade
quately explain why there are so
many more men in engineering.
Because Summers commented
on men scoring higher on the math
portion of the SAT, Jo Boaler, asso
ciate professor of mathematics edu
cation. questioned the validity of
such a measure.

tificate for Secondary Education test,

passing at a higher rate and receiving
the highest grades. Boaler explained.
As a result, Boaler said she be
lieves that testing in the U.S„ doesn't
reflect women's actual aptitudes due
to the nature of the test.
Research shows, for instance, that
females are at a disadvantage when
tested with short questions, under
time pressure and in a multiple
choice format. Boaler argued that
