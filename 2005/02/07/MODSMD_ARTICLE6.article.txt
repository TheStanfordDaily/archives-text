# Friedman to speak on Middle East
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With free copies of The New York Times dis
tributed around campus each weekday, plenty in
the Stanford community turn to Thomas Fried
man's opinion columns for perspectives on Iraq,
the Israeli / Palestinian conflict and globalization.
Those who pick up tickets today at noon in White
Pla/.a or at the Graduate Community Center will
have the chance to hear his views in person.
Hillel at Stanford and the ASSU Speakers' Bu
reau arc co-sponsoring a speech by The Times's
foreign affairs columnist tomorrow night at 7:30
p.m. at Kresge Auditorium. A three-time Pulitzer
Prize winner. Friedman is known for his fiery, di
rect columns, which often not only point out prob
lems with U.S. foreign policy but also propose so
lutions.
ASSU Speakers' Bureau Director Josh
Meltzer, a senior, said he thinks people will be par
ticularly interested to hear Friedman's views on
Iraq in the wake of elections there.
"Iraq is still a topic that's on a lot
of people's minds," Meltzer said.
"He's taken pretty strong stances
on that, and people will be interest
ed to hear his thoughts on it
whether they agree with him or
not."
In his Feb. 3 column, Friedman
wrote that he was "unreservedly
happy" about the outcome of the
Iraqi elections. In the same column,
he wrote of the Iraq war, "President
Bush's basic gut instinct about the
need to do this is exactly right. His
thinking that this could be done on
the cheap, though, with little post
war planning, was exactly wrong."
Friedman is also the author of
the bestselling book on globaliza
tion "The Lexus and the Olive
Tree" (2000) and the 1989 National
Book Award winner "From Beirut
to Jerusalem."
Meltzer said a speech at Stan
ford by Friedman three years ago
was"a big success â€” he was really
popular on campus."
He added that he expects all the
tickets to be gone by 1 p.m. today,
but some people without tickets
may be admitted to the event on
Tuesday starting at 7:30 p.m. Doors
open at 7 p.m., and ticket holders
must arrive by 7:20 to be guaran
teed a seat.
Students picking up tickets
today can get one per SUID and
may bring up to two SUIDs.
