# Panel studies grad student diversity
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford administrators have
never been shy about trumpeting
the racial and gender diversity of
the school's undergraduate stu
dents. But what about the demo
graphics of graduate students and
faculty members?
Five panelists at last night's dis
cussion of graduate diversity, held at
the Graduate Community Center,
said that the University needs to
match the level of success that has
been reached with the undergradu
ate population.
The event was organized by ju
nior Victoria Carr and freshman
Lauren Falcao, who work for the
ASSU Executive Office, as a way to
bring attention to the work that is
being done within the graduate
community to promote racial and
gender diversity.
The panelists suggested that im
provements need to be made in the
graduate recruiting and admissions

process to raise the number of mi
norities, and more broadly that
there needs to be a greater sense of
urgency from all parts of the Univer
sity in confronting the problem.
According to the University,
there are stark contrasts in the level
of diversity in the undergraduate
and graduate populations. For ex
ample, 10 percent of the undergrad
uates are African American, com
pared with only 3 percent of gradu
ate students and 2.7 percent of facul
ty members, for example.
The administration has recog
niz.ed the problem in demographics,
but panelist Ayodele Thomas, assis
tant dean for multicultural student
affairs for the School of Humanities
and Sciences, said that top adminis
trators, including University Presi
dent John Hennessy and University
Provost John Etchemendy, need to
do more than just provide support
"behind closed doors."
Hennessy will attend a faculty
luncheon on Wednesday at the
GCC to discuss the issues raised last
night.
Another panelist, Linguistics
Prof. John Rickford, said that there
needs to be more awareness of the
problem at the faculty level because
selection of graduate students and
new faculty members occurs largely
within departments.
Rickford said there is currently
"no sense of urgency or even rele
vance on this issue" from faculty.
The University will be seeking
feedback from faculty on the admis
sions and hiring reports that will
soon be released to individual de
partments, according to Rickford.
Assistant Dean of Graduate Di
versity Claudia Guzman Schweik
ert, another panelist, said that it is
easier to explain the importance of
diversity to a professor studying
world literature than to a professor
working in a laboratory.
Nonetheless, Schweikert said
that there is a "compelling need for
diversity in science, in engineering
and in the corporate world." She be
lieves that more emphasis should be
placed on the practical benefits of
increased minority representation,
and that the argument for diversity
should not be framed as "doing the

right thing."
"You've got to be able to say to
people: If you want to produce more
Nobel Laureates and have your re
search be on the cutting edge, then
this is what you need to do,"
Schweikert said.
Another major topic in the dis
cussion was the link between low
minority demographics in the grad
uate population and among faculty.
Because a large proportion of grad
uate students end up entering acad
emia as faculty members, panelists
believed that increased diversity
among the former group would also
bring more diversity to the latter.
But attracting minority gradu
ate students can be more compli
cated than it might seem. For ex
ample, one audience member
pointed out that some prospective
students are put off by the relative
homogeneity of Palo Alto and the
surrounding area.
Thomas agreed that the sur
rounding area might not be enticing
for some students, although that
particular issue is out of the Univer
sity's control.
"Fora lot of people. Stanford's
location is a problem. People are
like. 'It doesn't snow in the south ei
ther,"' she said.
A follow-up panel will be held
on Wednesday at the noon at the
GCC, and will focus primarily on
diversity issues relevant to facul
ty members.

Thomas agreed that the sur
rounding area might not be enticing
for some students, although that
particular issue is out of the Univer
sity's control.
"Fora lot of people. Stanford's
location is a problem. People are
like. 'It doesn't snow in the south ei
ther,"' she said.
A follow-up panel will be held
on Wednesday at the noon at the
GCC, and will focus primarily on
diversity issues relevant to facul
ty members.
Stanford administrators have
never been shy about trumpeting
the racial and gender diversity of
the school's undergraduate stu
dents. But what about the demo
graphics of graduate students and
faculty members?
Five panelists at last night's dis
cussion of graduate diversity, held at
the Graduate Community Center,
said that the University needs to
match the level of success that has
been reached with the undergradu
ate population.
The event was organized by ju
nior Victoria Carr and freshman
Lauren Falcao, who work for the
ASSU Executive Office, as a way to
bring attention to the work that is
being done within the graduate
community to promote racial and
gender diversity.
The panelists suggested that im
provements need to be made in the
graduate recruiting and admissions

process to raise the number of mi
norities, and more broadly that
there needs to be a greater sense of
urgency from all parts of the Univer
sity in confronting the problem.
According to the University,
there are stark contrasts in the level
of diversity in the undergraduate
and graduate populations. For ex
ample, 10 percent of the undergrad
uates are African American, com
pared with only 3 percent of gradu
ate students and 2.7 percent of facul
ty members, for example.
The administration has recog
niz.ed the problem in demographics,
but panelist Ayodele Thomas, assis
tant dean for multicultural student
affairs for the School of Humanities
and Sciences, said that top adminis
trators, including University Presi
dent John Hennessy and University
Provost John Etchemendy, need to
do more than just provide support
"behind closed doors."
Hennessy will attend a faculty
luncheon on Wednesday at the
GCC to discuss the issues raised last
night.
Another panelist, Linguistics
Prof. John Rickford, said that there
needs to be more awareness of the
problem at the faculty level because
selection of graduate students and
new faculty members occurs largely
within departments.
Rickford said there is currently
"no sense of urgency or even rele
vance on this issue" from faculty.
The University will be seeking
feedback from faculty on the admis
sions and hiring reports that will
soon be released to individual de
partments, according to Rickford.
Assistant Dean of Graduate Di
versity Claudia Guzman Schweik
ert, another panelist, said that it is
easier to explain the importance of
diversity to a professor studying
world literature than to a professor
working in a laboratory.
Nonetheless, Schweikert said
that there is a "compelling need for
diversity in science, in engineering
and in the corporate world." She be
lieves that more emphasis should be
placed on the practical benefits of
increased minority representation,
and that the argument for diversity
should not be framed as "doing the

right thing."
"You've got to be able to say to
people: If you want to produce more
Nobel Laureates and have your re
search be on the cutting edge, then
this is what you need to do,"
Schweikert said.
Another major topic in the dis
cussion was the link between low
minority demographics in the grad
uate population and among faculty.
Because a large proportion of grad
uate students end up entering acad
emia as faculty members, panelists
believed that increased diversity
among the former group would also
bring more diversity to the latter.
But attracting minority gradu
ate students can be more compli
cated than it might seem. For ex
ample, one audience member
pointed out that some prospective
students are put off by the relative
homogeneity of Palo Alto and the
surrounding area.
Thomas agreed that the sur
rounding area might not be enticing
for some students, although that
particular issue is out of the Univer
sity's control.
"Fora lot of people. Stanford's
location is a problem. People are
like. 'It doesn't snow in the south ei
ther,"' she said.
A follow-up panel will be held
on Wednesday at the noon at the
GCC, and will focus primarily on
diversity issues relevant to facul
ty members.
