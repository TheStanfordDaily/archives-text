Stanford administrators have
never been shy about trumpeting
the racial and gender diversity of
the school's undergraduate stu

faculty members?
Five panelists at last night's dis

there needs to be a greater sense of
urgency from all parts of the Univer

there are stark contrasts in the level
of diversity in the undergraduate
and graduate populations. For ex

uates are African American, com

ate students and 2.7 percent of facul
ty members, for example.
The administration has recog

affairs for the School of Humanities
and Sciences, said that top adminis
trators, including University Presi
dent John Hennessy and University
Provost John Etchemendy, need to
do more than just provide support
"behind closed doors."
Hennessy will attend a faculty
luncheon on Wednesday at the
