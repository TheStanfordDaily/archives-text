# On this day in Stanford History...

On Feb H, 1994, The Daily published
a story uncovering Meyer Library as
the lair of Stanford's "Roleplayers."
Below is an excerpt.
"It's Saturday night, and the
study rooms of Meyer Library begin
their weekly transformations.
"In one room, a 1920s detective
investigates an abandoned ware
house in the outskirts of chicago. In
another room, six rabbits warily cir
cle an angry duck, preparing to fight
to the death for the rights to the
sunny side of the marsh. In the last
room. Snow White searches for her
Prince Charming through dark
forests and abandoned castles.
"Welcome to the world of role
playing, where a round-trip ticket
fora two-week African safari only
costs a few sheets of paper, a pencil,
a bag of dice and a good imagina
tion. Based on social interaction
and collective creativity, roleplay
ing groups at Stanford travel to dif
ferent worlds and times, meeting
monsters of the medieval period
and rewriting the outcome of Star
Trek episodes.
" The real challenge of roleplay
ing is to really play a role,' said fresh
man Jocelyn Goldfein. 1 like to play
characters that are reallv unlike me.

For example, I'm playing a high
priestess, but I'm not a religious per
son. But since I have to play the
character, I have to really get into
her head and find out why she does
what she does.'
"When graduate student Pierre
Uszynski came to Stanford seven
years ago as a graduate student, he
couldn't find a roleplaying group.
'We tried to formalize roleplaying,
so we started advertising fora group
of people to join in roleplaying
games. We posted notices in The
Daily and bulletin board and com
puter systems, and eventually found
enough players to start a game.
That's how the mailing list got start
ed,' Uszynski said.
"Roleplayers feel they have an
edge over other entertainment. As
sophomore Malachi Pound says, it's
easy, its fun, it's cheap, it never gets
old ... what more could you ask?' "
On Feb 8, 1V77, The Daily wrote a
story about the unsung heroes of
Stanford's dorms — the custodians.
Below is an excerpt:
"Every weekday in the dorms,
they polish furniture, vacuum car
pets and mop bathroom floors.
Fortv custodians, most of whom

have worked for the University for
10 or 15 years, clean Stanford's stu
dent residences.
"Most say they enjoy working
around students.
"'Everybody is nice—just like
my own children,' says Sawae Jeffer
son, a cleaning woman. 'In Naranja
they call me little mom.' Everybody
hugs me - boys, girls, 1 hug everyone.'
"Carrie Funderburk. who works
in Ujamaa, echoes Jefferson's senti
ments.
" 'One of the reasons 1 work
here,' she explains, 'is that 1 get to
know the kids. They are all very nice
- they obey you.'
"But Jefferson says some stu
dents don't care for working people.
" 'When they see you just mopped
the bathroom floor, they come right
in and walk on it anyway. If I catch
them, 1 tell them right away,' she says.
Most students listen to her.
Funderburk aggress that students
are usually polite and attentive...or
else 1 hit them over the head with a
mop,' she chuckles.
Arc students messy?
"Mary Powell, Soto custodian,
says student slovenliness is not a
problem. She doesn't 'get after' her
students. She feels it is her job to
clean up after them.
"Gladys Anderson, Trancos
housekeeper, says she thinks today's
students are tidier than those of the
past.
" 'Wilbur used to be all boys. It's
a lot neater since it went coed.'
The boys 'were something else.'
Powell says. 'I came in one day and
found a grand piano on the third
floor. I still don't know how they got
it up there."
" 'The boys are neater now 'cause
they want to make a good impres
sion on the girls,' concludes Powell."
