# Law School considers switching to quarters
## 
### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
The Law School is considering a
proposal to synchronize its academ
ic calendar with those of the other
schools by switching from the se
mester to the quarter system. The
potential change is in response to
the increasingly interdisciplinary
nature of the legal profession and is
primarily intended to more closely
integrate the law curriculum with
other academic programs.
If approved by a majority of the
law faculty in the spring, the propos
al will go into effect beginning Sep
tember 2(X)f>. It is one of the first
major initiatives pursued by Law
School Dean Larry Kramer since he
assumed his position in the fall.
"Legal services have become in
creasingly integrated with other
fields of knowledge, so providing our
law students with interdisciplinary
training is central in our curriculum,"
Kramer said. "But the current calen
dar is a serious impediment for our
law students to benefit from the ex
cellence of other departments on
campus."
The Law School is the only uni
versity division that follows semes
ters rather than quarters. Under its

current academic calendar, the Law
School begins instruction in early
September and concludes in mid-
May. Because academic programs
under the quarter system are run
between late September and mid-
June. law students who want to take
classes outside the Law School
must forgo part of their vacation
time and face different sets of ex
amination schedules.
A switch to the quarter system.
Kramer said, would afford law stu
dents much easier access to Stan
ford's other academic programs,
many of which — such as econom
ics, sociology and engineering —
are strongly allied with legal study.
The change would also significant
ly facilitate bringing faculty mem
bers from other disciplines into the
law school, he added.
However, law students do not
seem to have reached a general con
sensus on the issue.
"My sense is [that] a sizeable mi
nority, especially students who are in
joint-degree programs, support the
change," said second-year law stu
dent John Elias, who serves as the
co-chair of the Law Association
committee that solicits student input
