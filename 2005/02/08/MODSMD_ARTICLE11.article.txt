# Law School considers switching to quarters
## 
### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
The Law School is considering a
proposal to synchronize its academ
ic calendar with those of the other
schools by switching from the se
mester to the quarter system. The
potential change is in response to
the increasingly interdisciplinary
nature of the legal profession and is
primarily intended to more closely
integrate the law curriculum with
other academic programs.
If approved by a majority of the
law faculty in the spring, the propos
al will go into effect beginning Sep
tember 2(X)f>. It is one of the first
major initiatives pursued by Law
School Dean Larry Kramer since he
assumed his position in the fall.
"Legal services have become in
creasingly integrated with other
fields of knowledge, so providing our
law students with interdisciplinary
training is central in our curriculum,"
Kramer said. "But the current calen
dar is a serious impediment for our
law students to benefit from the ex
cellence of other departments on
campus."
The Law School is the only uni
versity division that follows semes
ters rather than quarters. Under its

current academic calendar, the Law
School begins instruction in early
September and concludes in mid-
May. Because academic programs
under the quarter system are run
between late September and mid-
June. law students who want to take
classes outside the Law School
must forgo part of their vacation
time and face different sets of ex
amination schedules.
A switch to the quarter system.
Kramer said, would afford law stu
dents much easier access to Stan
ford's other academic programs,
many of which — such as econom
ics, sociology and engineering —
are strongly allied with legal study.
The change would also significant
ly facilitate bringing faculty mem
bers from other disciplines into the
law school, he added.
However, law students do not
seem to have reached a general con
sensus on the issue.
"My sense is [that] a sizeable mi
nority, especially students who are in
joint-degree programs, support the
change," said second-year law stu
dent John Elias, who serves as the
co-chair of the Law Association
committee that solicits student input
regarding the calendar change.
"Most are withholding judgment,
as we're still at the early stage of dis
cussions and we need some time to
digest what the change actually
means."
Alumni of the Law School have
generally spoken in favor of
Kramer's proposal.
"The days when lawyers could
simply opine on narrow legal issues
from a position of isolation are
over," said Mark Chandler, Law
School Class of 1981, who serves as
vice president of legal services and
general counsel for Cisco Systems.
"Dean Kramer's move to integrate
the Law School's calendar with the

rest of the University is a key to
maintaining the relevance of Stan
ford's legal program for the future."
Penny Pritzker, who earned joint
degrees in both business and law in
1985, also supported the idea.
"My experience at Stanford as a
J.D.-M.B.A. would have been easier
as well as enhanced if the Law
School had been on the quarter sys
tem like that of the Business
School," Pritzker said. "It would
have been easier for me to coordi
nate my class schedule: I would have
been studying for exams at the same
time for each school and therefore
not had to miss activities at the other
school due to scheduling conflicts."
But those impacted by the change
note that there are potential down
sides. Switching to a quarter system
would complicate summer employ
ments at law firms, because their
start and end dates are typically de

fined and keyed to a semester system
— which is the norm at most law
schools nationwide, including Har
vard and Yale.
Stanford law students would have
to delay the start of their summer
jobs by one to two weeks. For third
year law students, the quarter system
could mean leaving school later and
thus having less time to prepare for
the bar exam.
In addressing these problems,
Kramer has worked to secure guar
antees from the top 60 law firms that
conduct on-campus interviews that
Stanford law students would be able
to spend the same amount of time as
students from other law schools de
spite their late start date. If the cal
endar change materializes, the Law
School may also offer third-year stu
dents the option of taking their final
exams early to allow for adequate
study ing time for bar exam review.

"I don't see any drawback associ
ated with the quarter system that
cannot be resolved," Kramer said.
The school administration will or
ganize a number of panel discussions
and town-hall meetings with stu
dents and faculty members in the
coming weeks before the proposal is
put to a faculty vote.
Marcus Cole, associate dean for
curriculum at the Law School who
strongly favors the calendar change,
said it is essential to appreciate the
benefits of the switch and to fully ad
dress students' and faculty members'
concerns. But it is even more impor
tant. he said, to identify the risks of
not implementing the proposal.
"If we fail to capitalize on our
strategic advantage of having top
notch academic programs around us.
then we run a real risk of rapidly de
clining into mediocrity," Cole said.

creasingly integrated with other
fields of knowledge, so providing our
law students with interdisciplinary
training is central in our curriculum,"
Kramer said. "But the current calen
dar is a serious impediment for our
law students to benefit from the ex
cellence of other departments on
campus."
The Law School is the only uni
versity division that follows semes
ters rather than quarters. Under its

current academic calendar, the Law
School begins instruction in early
September and concludes in mid-
May. Because academic programs
under the quarter system are run
between late September and mid-
June. law students who want to take
classes outside the Law School
must forgo part of their vacation
time and face different sets of ex
amination schedules.
A switch to the quarter system.
Kramer said, would afford law stu
dents much easier access to Stan
ford's other academic programs,
many of which — such as econom
ics, sociology and engineering —
are strongly allied with legal study.
The change would also significant
ly facilitate bringing faculty mem
bers from other disciplines into the
law school, he added.
However, law students do not
seem to have reached a general con
sensus on the issue.
"My sense is [that] a sizeable mi
nority, especially students who are in
joint-degree programs, support the
change," said second-year law stu
dent John Elias, who serves as the
co-chair of the Law Association
committee that solicits student input
regarding the calendar change.
"Most are withholding judgment,
as we're still at the early stage of dis
cussions and we need some time to
digest what the change actually
means."
Alumni of the Law School have
generally spoken in favor of
Kramer's proposal.
"The days when lawyers could
simply opine on narrow legal issues
from a position of isolation are
over," said Mark Chandler, Law
School Class of 1981, who serves as
vice president of legal services and
general counsel for Cisco Systems.
"Dean Kramer's move to integrate
the Law School's calendar with the

rest of the University is a key to
maintaining the relevance of Stan
ford's legal program for the future."
Penny Pritzker, who earned joint
degrees in both business and law in
1985, also supported the idea.
"My experience at Stanford as a
J.D.-M.B.A. would have been easier
as well as enhanced if the Law
School had been on the quarter sys
tem like that of the Business
School," Pritzker said. "It would
have been easier for me to coordi
nate my class schedule: I would have
been studying for exams at the same
time for each school and therefore
not had to miss activities at the other
school due to scheduling conflicts."
But those impacted by the change
note that there are potential down
sides. Switching to a quarter system
would complicate summer employ
ments at law firms, because their
start and end dates are typically de

fined and keyed to a semester system
— which is the norm at most law
schools nationwide, including Har
vard and Yale.
Stanford law students would have
to delay the start of their summer
jobs by one to two weeks. For third
year law students, the quarter system
could mean leaving school later and
thus having less time to prepare for
the bar exam.
In addressing these problems,
Kramer has worked to secure guar
antees from the top 60 law firms that
conduct on-campus interviews that
Stanford law students would be able
to spend the same amount of time as
students from other law schools de
spite their late start date. If the cal
endar change materializes, the Law
School may also offer third-year stu
dents the option of taking their final
exams early to allow for adequate
study ing time for bar exam review.

"I don't see any drawback associ
ated with the quarter system that
cannot be resolved," Kramer said.
The school administration will or
ganize a number of panel discussions
and town-hall meetings with stu
dents and faculty members in the
coming weeks before the proposal is
put to a faculty vote.
Marcus Cole, associate dean for
curriculum at the Law School who
strongly favors the calendar change,
said it is essential to appreciate the
benefits of the switch and to fully ad
dress students' and faculty members'
concerns. But it is even more impor
tant. he said, to identify the risks of
not implementing the proposal.
"If we fail to capitalize on our
strategic advantage of having top
notch academic programs around us.
then we run a real risk of rapidly de
clining into mediocrity," Cole said.
The Law School is considering a
proposal to synchronize its academ
ic calendar with those of the other
schools by switching from the se
mester to the quarter system. The
potential change is in response to
the increasingly interdisciplinary
nature of the legal profession and is
primarily intended to more closely
integrate the law curriculum with
other academic programs.
If approved by a majority of the
law faculty in the spring, the propos
al will go into effect beginning Sep
tember 2(X)f>. It is one of the first
major initiatives pursued by Law
School Dean Larry Kramer since he
assumed his position in the fall.
