# Asian-interest sorority hosts successful alumnae
## 
### KILLEEN HANSON 
For the last five years, the Alpha Kappa
Delta Phi sorority has sponsored outreach
events highlighting women activists. This
year, for the first time, aKDPhi is devoting
an entire month to those efforts. "Women
on Top," the title of each event, features
prominent Stanford alumnae who have suc
ceeded in their fields.
The month's events kicked off on Feb. 2
with a presentation by Carol Lam, Stanford
alumna and U.S. attorney in southern Cali
fornia. Lam spoke on the experience of Asian
Americans in legal professions and empha
sized the need to actively defy stereotypes.
Because aKDPhi is the largest Asian-
American interest sorority in the nation,
many of the events this month will be geared
toward Asian and Asian-American stu
dents. though coordinators stressed that all
activities are open to the general Stanford
community.
"How many Asians do you see in law or
in the media? Very few," said junior LiMin
Lam. "Society often pushes Asian Ameri
cans into passive careers. This month shows
us that's not necessary."
On Wednesday, the sorority will sponsor
a screening of documentaries by human
rights activist Ellen Bruno, who earned her
master's degree in documentary film from
Stanford in 1990.
The films grapple with the difficult situa
tions facing women in East Asian countries.
"Sacrifice" is the story of child prostitutes
from Burma. "Sainsara" documents he
struggle for survival and recovery of Cam
bodians and "Satya: A Prayer for the
Enemy" captures the resistance of Tibetan

Buddhist nuns.
Later this month, the group will host Juju
Chang, a correspondent for the television
news show "20/20" in New York, who will
speak on the condition of women working
in today's media. She has covered embassy
bombings in Kenya, as well as the TWA and
ValuJet plane crashes.
To cap off the month, the sorority will
sponsor a Tsunami benefit concert featur
ing Vienna Teng and Odessa Chen.
Past years' programs have proven incred
ibly successful, coordinators said. Three
years ago, the sorority sponsored a day of
speakers, and last year the day expanded to
a week. Thus stretching the week into a
month seemed like the natural thing to do.
"The month lets us contribute to the
community and to Stanford," Lam said, it
also strengthens us as a house."
Last year, the program, themed "Be
yond the Margins," focused on shattering
gender stereotypes. Among last years
speakers was Yuri Kochiyama. a well
known civil-rights activist who continues to
protest racial inequality and to support po
litical prisoners in the United States.
"It was really inspirational to hear
someone talk and tell us that there are
ways to be an activist out in the world."
Lam said. "It's so empowering to know
that we aren't limited to Stanford but can
affect the world at large."
Other events last year included a panel
on gay and lesbian issues.
"This is our chance to help empower
women and show the community what op
portunities are out there. Lam said. "I'm so
excited for this year; each event promises to
be really wonderful."
