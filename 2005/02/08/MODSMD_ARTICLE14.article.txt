## Finding the next social entrepreneur: interview with Bill Drayton 
### 
Bill Drayton is probably the best-known person in
social entrepreneurship. He has a vision and an or
ganization that is shaping the future of the "citizen
sector."
Drayton founded Ashoka to find, fund and support the
world's leading social innovators. From child-abuse hot
lines in India to treatment for AIDS patients in South
Africa, Ashoka has helped fund important social causes
across the world.
With Tony Wang from Solutions Magazine, we inter
viewed Drayton about Ashoka, social entrepreneurship,
and how students can get involved.
The Daily: What does Ashoka do? How did you come

up with the idea for Ashoka?
Bill Drayton: It's embarrassing
ly logical. What is the most power
ful lever you can imagine? A big
idea, but only if it's in the hands of
a truly outstanding entrepreneur. It
starts with the person and the idea,
and then grows to the institution.
All three are intertwined.
Ashoka helps launch the best
ideas, entrepreneurs and institu
tions we can find anywhere in the
world. We have to believe that the
combination of the idea and per-

son is going to change the pattern
in that field — health, environment, human rights, what
ever — at least on the continental scale. That's an unusual
idea and person, but they certainly exist.
TD: You came up with the idea as an undergraduate?
That's reassuring. What do you see for the future of the cit
izen sector and social innovation?
BD: It was an accident that the two halves of society's
operations split. Business became entrepreneurial and
competitive three centuries ago and the citizen sector
didn't. But now we have the same architecture, and we are
closing the productivity gap. So now the potential for rein
tegration is there.
Is the citizen sector going to integrate? Or is it going to
continue inertially on the path of division? Again, the
stakes are high and the results far from certain.
TD: What kind of integration are you envisioning? Do
you think civil organizations should focus mainly on inter
national integration?
BD: No, integration at all levels. I'll give you a concrete
example to make this manageable.
In Mexico, we just signed a contract between us, five
major citizen groups serving small farmers and a large pip
ing company. Previously, drip irrigation has only been
available through the commercial system to farmers with
50 hectares or more. We can now deliver drip irrigation to
five-hectare farms.
Suddenly, we have a triple win. There is a huge new
market for the piping company and they will make a ton of
money on this. Farmers will now have more income, and
therefore, citizen groups involved end up with happy
clients. Finally, the citizen groups also will probably get a
20-percent profit, which means they will never have to go
and ask money from government or foundations again.
That's just a very concrete example of what the world
could look like. Everyone wins, if we can overcome the
habit of division and start working together. At Ashoka,
we think that that is smarter, and we would like to help the
field move in that direction.
TD: A lot students want to become involved in the "cit
izen sector," in one way or another. But it's not clear how
to get involved, since there's no set career path for "social
entrepreneurs." Any advice?
BD: The fact that it's not clear is both a problem and a
huge opportunity. If you go into law, there is an oversup
ply relative to demand. In this area, it's the other way
around. This is by far the fastest growing sector. This is
where you'll have a big impact. And this is where the en
ergy in society is and will be fora long time. This is where
the real opportunities are to make a mark because there is
so much catching up to do. If you go to a dinner party now,
people are much more likely to be interested if you say you
are a social entrepreneur than an investment banker.
TD. Okay, there're a lot of opportunities. But it's not
easy to find them. It's obvious where to look fora job in in
vestment banking, but where do you look fora job being a
social entrepreneur?
BD: If there are 1.1 million charitable organizations in
the United States, surely you can find one with a job open
ing. If not. why not start your own?
The biggest barrier that anyone at any age has is the
"stuffed shirt syndrome." What do you think a law part
ner, who has spent 30 years in the same firm, is going to say
when you tell him that you're going to do something excit
ing? There is going to be a little twinge in his heart and he
will puff up and say, "No you can't do it. That's unwise,
young man."
The biggest problem is getting beyond the "you can't"
syndrome. The moment you figure that out, you're on
your way to flying. Anyone who cannot see problems
around him or herself is utterly blind. All the problems sit
ting there are an invitation for you to be creative, make use
of your skills and resources and find a solution.
Of course you can do it. It doesn't require brilliance.
It's just giving yourself permission and then being persis
tent. Persistent in seeing the problem or opportunity and
persistent in thinking about it until you have come up with
some interesting ideas that might change the pattern. It's
really a mindset, not anything in the objective world —
that is the problem.

izen sector," in one way or another. But it's not clear how
to get involved, since there's no set career path for "social
entrepreneurs." Any advice?
BD: The fact that it's not clear is both a problem and a
huge opportunity. If you go into law, there is an oversup
ply relative to demand. In this area, it's the other way
around. This is by far the fastest growing sector. This is
where you'll have a big impact. And this is where the en
ergy in society is and will be fora long time. This is where
the real opportunities are to make a mark because there is
so much catching up to do. If you go to a dinner party now,
people are much more likely to be interested if you say you
are a social entrepreneur than an investment banker.
TD. Okay, there're a lot of opportunities. But it's not
easy to find them. It's obvious where to look fora job in in
vestment banking, but where do you look fora job being a
social entrepreneur?
BD: If there are 1.1 million charitable organizations in
the United States, surely you can find one with a job open
ing. If not. why not start your own?
The biggest barrier that anyone at any age has is the
"stuffed shirt syndrome." What do you think a law part
ner, who has spent 30 years in the same firm, is going to say
when you tell him that you're going to do something excit
ing? There is going to be a little twinge in his heart and he
will puff up and say, "No you can't do it. That's unwise,
young man."
The biggest problem is getting beyond the "you can't"
syndrome. The moment you figure that out, you're on
your way to flying. Anyone who cannot see problems
around him or herself is utterly blind. All the problems sit
ting there are an invitation for you to be creative, make use
of your skills and resources and find a solution.
Of course you can do it. It doesn't require brilliance.
It's just giving yourself permission and then being persis
tent. Persistent in seeing the problem or opportunity and
persistent in thinking about it until you have come up with
some interesting ideas that might change the pattern. It's
really a mindset, not anything in the objective world —
that is the problem.

Bill Drayton is probably the best-known person in
social entrepreneurship. He has a vision and an or
ganization that is shaping the future of the "citizen
sector."
Drayton founded Ashoka to find, fund and support the
world's leading social innovators. From child-abuse hot
lines in India to treatment for AIDS patients in South
Africa, Ashoka has helped fund important social causes
across the world.
With Tony Wang from Solutions Magazine, we inter
viewed Drayton about Ashoka, social entrepreneurship,
and how students can get involved.
The Daily: What does Ashoka do? How did you come

up with the idea for Ashoka?
Bill Drayton: It's embarrassing
ly logical. What is the most power
ful lever you can imagine? A big
idea, but only if it's in the hands of
a truly outstanding entrepreneur. It
starts with the person and the idea,
and then grows to the institution.
All three are intertwined.
Ashoka helps launch the best
ideas, entrepreneurs and institu
tions we can find anywhere in the
world. We have to believe that the
combination of the idea and per-

son is going to change the pattern
in that field — health, environment, human rights, what
ever — at least on the continental scale. That's an unusual
idea and person, but they certainly exist.
TD: You came up with the idea as an undergraduate?
That's reassuring. What do you see for the future of the cit
izen sector and social innovation?
BD: It was an accident that the two halves of society's
operations split. Business became entrepreneurial and
competitive three centuries ago and the citizen sector
didn't. But now we have the same architecture, and we are
closing the productivity gap. So now the potential for rein
tegration is there.
Is the citizen sector going to integrate? Or is it going to
continue inertially on the path of division? Again, the
stakes are high and the results far from certain.
TD: What kind of integration are you envisioning? Do
you think civil organizations should focus mainly on inter
national integration?
BD: No, integration at all levels. I'll give you a concrete
example to make this manageable.
In Mexico, we just signed a contract between us, five
major citizen groups serving small farmers and a large pip
ing company. Previously, drip irrigation has only been
available through the commercial system to farmers with
50 hectares or more. We can now deliver drip irrigation to
five-hectare farms.
Suddenly, we have a triple win. There is a huge new
market for the piping company and they will make a ton of
money on this. Farmers will now have more income, and
therefore, citizen groups involved end up with happy
clients. Finally, the citizen groups also will probably get a
20-percent profit, which means they will never have to go
and ask money from government or foundations again.
That's just a very concrete example of what the world
could look like. Everyone wins, if we can overcome the
habit of division and start working together. At Ashoka,
we think that that is smarter, and we would like to help the
field move in that direction.
TD: A lot students want to become involved in the "cit
izen sector," in one way or another. But it's not clear how
