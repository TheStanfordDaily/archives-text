# Bacteria-powered cars?
## Researchers investigate hydrogen-producing bacteria 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Imagine using bacteria to fuel your
car. If Stanford researchers working on
biohydrogen generation have their way,
fossil fuels could someday be supplanted
by the hydrogen generated from geneti
cally engineered photosynthetic bacte
ria.
As part of the Global Climate and
Energy Project, scientists are research
ing methods for creating, storing and
using alternative energy sources, partic
ularly hydrogen.
James Swartz, professor of chemical
engineering, and Alfred Spormann, as
sociate professor of civil and environ
mental engineering, are leading re
searchers to investigate solar-powered
bacterial processes that create hydrogen.
The biohydrogen generation project
began approximately three years ago,
because of renewed interest in the po
tential for the biological production of
hydrogen.
Marcus Boyer, a graduate student in
Swartz's lab, said, "The idea has been
around for decades, but the tools have
only in recent times become available."
Boyer's group has been working
with the Synechocystis bacterium,
which, under natural conditions, uses
sunlight to split water into molecular
oxygen and residual protons and elec
trons. The lab plans to add a hydroge
nase enzyme to the bacteria, which
would combine electrons and protons
to create hydrogen.
The first major hurdle in the project,
and the one that the team is working on
now, is finding a hydrogenase enzyme
that can survive an oxygen-rich environ
ment within the bacteria. Researchers
are using protein evolution methods to
generate hydrogenases en masse and to
test them for oxygen tolerance.
"It's the figurative needle in the
haystack, but the catch is that there
might never have been a needle to begin
with." said Keith Gneshin. a former
member of the Swartz lab.
Still, there is reason to believe it is
possible. Boyer noted that accessory

proteins that the team just received from
the National Renewable Energy Labs
may help them better engineer an oxy
gen-tolerant hydrogenase. And a team
at UC Berkeley has had some success
with a sulfur deprivation cycle that may
inhibit oxygen production.
Once that happens, the team would
still have a lot more work to do to devel
op a hydrogen-producing bacterium.
The cells would have to be genetically
modified to help the hydrogenase steal

electrons, which the bacteria would oth
erwise use for their own metabolic pro
cesses.
According to Jim Stapleton, another
graduate student involved in Swartz's
lab. metabolic engineering would be
needed to make bacteria an efficient
producer of hydrogen. There's no way to
start on these steps until an oxygen-tol
erant hydrogenase has been found.
"Scientists often start with a system
and try to make it more efficient. We're

still trying to make the system, so we
don't know how efficient it will be,"
Boyer said.
Another possibility, which is being
research by Jacky Ng in Spormann's
lab, is the use of a filamentous
cyanobacteria, which has separate
compartments for splitting water and
for nitrogen fixation, which must also
occur without oxygen. Hydrogen pro
duction could potentially be made to
take place instead of the nitrogen fixa
tion process in this organism.
According to Boyer, however, this
process involves more steps and may
waste more energy than the biohydro
gen producing bacteria that he is work
ing on. Moreover, using the Synechocys
tis bacterium may also be superior to
biomass, which is a somewhat inefficient
process involving the use of agricultural
waste to create energy.
Despite the potential efficiency gains
of biohydrogen production, there are
still some doubts about the Stanford
team's research.
"The conception of biohydrogen that
my former group was pursuing derived
from an editorial describing bacterial hy
drogen production as theoretically not
impossible," Gneshin said. "But the
same has been said of cold fusion and
time travel. Furthermore, there are
many competing technologies fpr hydro
gen production that will require less re
search to make economical."
Gneshin pointed to research being
done to turn corn into hydrogen. And
Boyer acknowledged that improve
ments in solar cell technology could sur
pass biohydrogen processes for the best
use of solar energy.
Still, there are unique advantages to
the use of hydrogen as an energy source,
especially as technology develops to
more safely store and use it.
Hydrogen can be used in fuel cells,
which are hypothetically more efficient
than traditional engines. Hydrogen also
creates lower levels of greenhouse emis
sions. It is widely used in industry and hy
drogen car protoypes are already on the
road. Maybe someday everyone will run
on bacteria-produced hydrogen.
