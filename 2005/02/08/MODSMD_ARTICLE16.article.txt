# Impress your sweetheart...
## Tech tips for Valentine's Day 
### ANETO OKONKWO 
Last December, I celebrated my girl
friend's birthday by posting an advertise
ment on Thefacebook.com. For $ 14.1 was
able to share the day's excitement with a
captive audience of about 7,(XX) people.
With Valentine's Day around the
corner. I will be hard pressed to follow
suit with another innovative idea.
Next Monday, couples everywhere
will undoubtedly use Thefacebook.com
and other technologies to share their
love around the world. Furthermore,
gifts of chocolates, roses and stuffed an
imals will likely be supplemented with a
unique e-card, cool tech gadget or cre
ative text message.
These days, one can find everything
they need online: e-cards, gifts, flowers
and even personals sites for finding a
special someone. Last year. Nielsen /
Netßatings reported that gift and flow
er Web sites attracted 5.5 million
unique visitors and greeting card Web
sites reported 8.8 million users the week
before Valentine's Day.
Despite their popularity and conve
nience, technology-aided valentines
raise a special question: Are text mes
sages. e-cards and "pick and click" gifts
just as good as their physical counter
parts?
Most Stanford students concede that
one should only use technology-aided
valentines to supplement the real thing.
"I wouldn't mind receiving some
thing online, but 1 would prefer some
thing more personal," said junior
Melanie Kannokada.
With online valentines, one some
times trades personalization and heart
felt emotion for convenience and
speed.
"You need to send a real card so that
the receiver can display the card openly
to friends, but you should also send an
e-card," said junior Ben llegbodu.
llegbodu recommended using Beat
greets.com. a Web site that offers free
valentine e-cards featuring a wide range
of musical accompaniments from hip
hop group The Nappy Roots to cartoon
favorite Alvin and the Chipmunks.

The vastness and diversity of offer
ings are some of the understated advan
tages of shopping for Valentine's Day
gifts or e-cards online. Junior Kit Chen
enjoys a more outlandish approach to
celebrating Valentine's Day with the
"cute, cuddly, and horribly wrong" e
cards from Happytreefriends.com.
This Web site combines bunnies and
bloodshed fora creative twist on com
memorating St. Valentine.
Still other students claim that e
valentines serve them well in special
scenarios like mass mailings, budding
relationships and long-distance situa
tions. Popular Web sites such as Amer

icangreetings.com, Bluemountain.com
and Egreetings.com make it cheap and
easy to celebrate Valentine's Day with
family members back home or friends
studying abroad.
For gifts, Web sites such as 1-800-
flowers.com offer same-day delivery as
well as service to over 24 countries. Se
nior Dan Siroker commended 1-800-
flowers.com for its accessibility and effi
ciency, but highlighted the importance
of more traditional gift delivery.
"Traditional gifts are more tangible
and show that you put more time into the
preparation and planning," Siroker said.
