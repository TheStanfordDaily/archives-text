## Editorial Stanford must address grad diversity 
### 
Over the past live years, Stanford has drastically
changed the appearance of its undergraduate classes
by making diversity a priority in undergraduate ad
missions As a result, the University has received na
tional recognition as a leader in ethnic diversity.
However, Stanford's graduate schools have failed
to reflect the same kind of progressive change over
the past 20 years. That has caused community mem
bers and alumni to move past their excitement about
undergraduate life to address this problem.
Currently, the graduate student population is some
what reflective of the I Jniversity's pledge to affirmative
action — over the past 30 years, numbers have in
creased. Hut according to a report recently presented
to the Faculty Senate, progress has been uneven.
While Asian American graduate enrollment has
increased overall, in the Schools of Earth Sciences
and I.aw the numbers have not significantly changed
since the 1980s. In the two largest schools. Engineer
ing and Humanities & Sciences, Latino enrollment in
creased from2.l percent in 1983t04.1 percent in 1991;
since then, however, it dropped to 2.3 percent in 2003.
'I'he percentage ol African Americans in Business,
Engineering, H&S and Law began to increase in the
mid-1980s, but numbers decreased in recent years and
current enrollment levels are comparable to where
they were 20 years ago. Meanwhile, Native Ameri
cans continue to be underrepresented — although
the situation lias improved since 1983.
There are many reasons that explain the lack of mi-
A significant factor is the lack of mi
nority faculty. The issues of faculty diversity and grad
uate school diversity are closely connected. By not
producing potential professors of color. Stanford
hurts its chances of finding qualified faculty and thus
attracting more graduate students.
The ASSIi, at least, is promoting discussion about
the issue by hosting two panels. The first, on graduate
diversity, was last night; the second, on faculty diver
sity, is Wednesday. University President John Hen
nessy is scheduled to speak on Wednesday. We hope
that he will address the issues we raise and offer sug
gestions on how his administration will take an even
more active role.
Furthermore, the atmosphere for graduate students

of color is often characterized as isolated, due to the
lack of other minority students in particular fields.
Graduate admissions have also been affected by the
economy, job market, limited financial aid and unsat
isfactory retention of minority graduate students in
Ph.D. programs.
Among peer institutions, Stanford is neither a lag
gard nor a leader on this issue. Nevertheless, the Uni
versity has a long legacy of positive change, and it
should strive for excellence, not settle for mediocrity.
Hiding in the proud shadow of our accomplishments
in undergraduate diversity does not solve this cyclical
problem.
We suggest that Stanford increase its dedication to di
versity with groups such as the Task Force on Minority
Alumni Relations and the Office of Graduate Diversity.
Graduate schools should utilize Stanford's diverse
undergraduate applicant pool to create a "spillover
effect" by encouraging current Stanford students to
apply to the graduate programs and, in fact, accept
larger numbers of Stanford undergraduates into these
programs. Faculty should be active participants in the
admissions process and be encouraged to recruit stu
dents from all backgrounds. Furthermore, minority
alumni have the responsibility to represent their grad
uate institutions and be advocates of strides taken to
improve graduate diversity.
By focusing our resources on this issue, Stanford
will emerge from the pack as dedicated to diversity on
a campus-wide level.
More importantly, it will increase the pool of po
tential professors who are qualified and eager to teach
at an institution that in excels in areas beyond aca
demic research. In addition, Stanford will be produc
ing future alumni who will give back to their respec
tive programs and act as ambassadors for the Farm.
In 2001, Hennessey reaffirmed his commitment to
diversity, noting that institutional commitment to this
cause is insufficient, and that "effective action re
quires the personal involvement of all members ol the
Stanford community." We believe that the Stanford
community needs to diligently encourage diverse ap
plicants for graduate school and to create a hospitable
and supportive environment conducive to academic
excellence and cultural enrichment.
