## Give students voice in faculty selection 
### 
In a report on faculty diversity delivered to the.
Faculty Senate two weeks ago, Associate Vice
Provost lor Faculty Development Sally Dickson
highlighted the importance of establishing faculty
recruitment and retention committees that have di
verse memberships. However, in limiting member
ship to committees strictly to faculty members, the
University is missing the input of the most diverse
committee of faculty evaluators on campus: Stan
ford students.
Aside from a 3.8 percent increase in Asian-Amer
ican faculty, the proportion of Latino, African Amer
ican and Native-American faculty have shown little
improvement since IW3. Together, less than 20 per
cent of university faculty members are minority pro
fessors. and around 78 percent are male.
The efforts of University President John Hen
nessy. University Provost John Etchemendy and the
Faculty Recruitment Office in recruiting and retain
ing minorities in academia are certainly commend
able: there are outreach programs like the Minority
Alumni Conference, 2001 Campus Diversity Initia
tive, the Committee on Faculty Diversity and Stan
ford's collaboration with the California Pipeline Pro
ject to enhance dialogue among all faculty members
and to increase opportunities for campus involvement
at all levels. These programs all demonstrate the Uni
versity's commitment to fostering an atmosphere of
multiculturalism and acceptance. Nonetheless, the
task of increasing minority representation among fac
ulty is not one the University can undertake on its
own.
While the tenure status of each professor is for-

mally reviewed and approved by departments and the
administration, the true measure of a given profes
sor's contribution to Stanford is determined not just
by research accomplishments, but by his or her abili
ties in the classroom as well. For this reason, student
input — from quarterly evaluations — should be
given greater emphasis in faculty proceedings such as
the tenure review process. Further attention to the
opinions of Stanford's student body, one of the most
diverse in the nation, would only augment the array of
perspectives to address this issue.
Simultaneously, students must realize their poten
tial to be agents of change in making gains toward fac
ulty diversity by taking faculty evaluations more seri
ously. Because it is likely that most students at Stan
ford have taken at least one class with a female pro
fessor or a faculty member of minority background, it
is crucial to think of each evaluation as an opportuni
ty to make a statement about faculty diversity on cam
pus. This is not to say that students should exaggerate
their comments for the sake of diversity; more atten
tion should be focused on constructive comments or
giving well-deserved praise in order to provide the
University with a better understanding of a profes
sor's impact.
Comments like those made recently by Harvard
University President Lawrence Summers regarding
the lack of women and girls' lack of "innate ability" in
the areas of mathematics and sciences only further il
lustrate continuing problems with discrimination and
inequality, and should spur Stanford to continue ad
dressing the substantial need to increase opportuni
ties for minorities in academia.
