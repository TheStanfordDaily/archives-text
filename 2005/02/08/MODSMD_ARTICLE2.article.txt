# Real News, BCSC will look at black progress

### LAURA CARWILE 
The Real News, Stanford's old
est African-American publication,
will hold a panel discussion on the
major issues confronting black
Americans — particularly since the
landmark Brown v. Board of Edu
cation case — at 7 p.m. tonight at
the Law School.
The event, also sponsored by the
Black Community Service Center,
is part of Black History Month cele
brations. The panel discussion —
entitled "The State of the Black
Community 50 Years Since Brown:
Progress or Regress?"—is de
signed to inform the Stanford com

munity about the challenges and re
sponsibilities that the black commu
nity continues to face.
Issues of modern-day racism,
stereotyping and school segrega
tion will be the focus of much of
the discussion.
"We're bringing news in real
time, in person and in the context of
Black History Month," said senior
Khalilah Karim, an editor at The
Real News. "The questions range
from the effects of integration on
the Black community and the lack
of a unified voice among Black
America in politics, to the genera
tion gap and problems facing the
Black community."
The Real News wants to hold a
forum at Stanford to talk about chal
lenges faced by African-Americans
throughout the nation, as well as to
discuss how to pool resources to ad
dress the community's needs.
Tonight's panel will look at how
blacks in America have progressed
since "Brown v. Board of Educa
tion," as well as take a critical look at
what further improvements are
needed.

The theme of this year's Black
History Month is "Stories Told. Sto
ries Untold." Accordingly, Karim
said she hopes that stories will play a
large role in the overall dialogue.
"We also wanted to provide a
space for alumni to recount events
from the past at Stanford and na
tionwide and discuss how the legacy
of their era relates to the current
state of black America," she added.
In addition to experts on the
topic, the panel will also include
Stanford faculty members and
alumni, such as Law Prof. Rick
Banks and attorney Reginald Turn
er, Class of 1975.
Attendance at the forum is open
to the general public.
