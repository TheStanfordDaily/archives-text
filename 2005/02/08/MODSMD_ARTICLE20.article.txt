'Shameful and outrageous' to
dismiss criticism as anti-Semitism
Shame on Sheree Roth and D.J.
Hanson for their mean-spirited at
tack on Congressman Paul Findley
and Olivia Sohns of the Coalition
for Justice in the Middle East (Let
ters to the Editor. Jan. 31). Rather
than discussing the merit of Find
ley's views. Roth and Hanson pre
ferred to slander Findley, mischar
acterize his lecture and belittle
Sohns and her organization.
The 9/11 Commission warned
last year that "America's policy

choices have consequences," and
identified unconditional support for
Israel as a major source of resent
ment that poses a threat to our na
tional security.
Speaking of the United States tilt
toward Israel, former national secu
rity advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski
wrote in April. 2(M)2 of "a nearly
unanimous global consensus that
United States policy has become
one-sided and morally hypocritical."
In October 2(X)3 a European poll
found that 59 percent of Europeans
believe Israel represents the biggest
obstacle to Mideast and world peace.

Dismissing such sentiments as
mere anti-Semitism in an attempt to
silence criticism of Israel is shameful
and outrageous. There is no doubt
that nearly 40 years of illegal Israeli
occupation and colonization of Pales
tinian land have needlessly exacerbat
ed conditions in the Middle East and
increased resentment against the
West. It would be ridiculous not to
question the wisdom of our continued
support of such misguided and coun
terproductive Israeli policies.
