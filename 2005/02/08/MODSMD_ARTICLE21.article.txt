# Holt's Harangue
## One bad bunny, buster 
### 
So I opened the paper the other
day and stumbled on a story
about PBS â€” you know, the
government-funded channel behind
controversial programs like "Bar
ney the Dinosaur." It seems that
"Postcards from Buster," a spin-off
from world-renowned kids show

"Arthur," got
embroiled in
some controver
sy. Buster, al
though animat
ed, visits chil
dren all over the
country to high
light the differ
ences in Ameri
can families.
He's visited a

cowgirl's family in Texas, a Mormon
family in Utah and, most recently,
two lesbian families in Vermont.
The latter has caused a big up
roar. President George W. Bush's
Education Secretary Margaret
Spellings wrote a letter to PBS de
manding that the show be pulled.
In her letter, she said that PBS
should refund the money granted
to the station as part of the gov
ernment's Ready-to-Learn pro
gram. PBS chose to pull the show
from most areas in the nation (by
pure coincidence, all red states).
Spellings, in her letter, was quoted
as saying: "Congress and the De
partment's purpose in funding this
kind of program certainly was not
to introduce this kind of subject
matter to children, particularly
through the powerful medium of
television."
The secretary could be right
there. I mean j was completely
against PBS' earlier shows "Dora
the Explora's Guide to Insider
Trading" and "Arthur Explores
How Men Are Descended from
Apes and Why Creationism is a
Backwards, Silly Belief Clung to by
Religious Zealots." These are heavy
topics that 1 didn't feel television
should be broaching with such
young minds.
For example. Buster's own par
ents are divorced: what kind of mes
sage is that sending about the famly?
I wonder why Republicans like
Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh
aren't lambasting the show for that
(hmm, perhaps it's because com
bined they've had more wives than
Henry VIII).
The question remains: Is PBS
correct in promoting progressive
tolerance in a nation deeply divided
on such issues as sexual orientation?
To answer this question, let's look at
the most famous children's show of
all time: "Sesame Street." "Sesame
Street" started in 1969 with a racial
ly integrated cast. 1 don't know why
the government didn't pull its fund
ing immediately, because even then

you could see PBS was sliding into a
becoming a leftist propaganda tool,
espousing such liberal beliefs as
"tolerance" and "racial-equality."
Maybe the secretary would prefer
that other versions of "Postcards
from Buster," "Arthur" and "Sesame
Street" run. With Republicans in con
trol of the government, the Ready-to-
Learn program can be used to fund
only the shows that will educate chil
dren with good moral values.
And there's no place better to get
those moral values than from
prominent Republicans like Mar
garet Spellings.
Take, for instance, Ann Coul
ter's version of "Postcards from
Buster," in which Buster goes
around the country and only shows
WASP families who have a healthy
relationship with God. Coulter,
after all. believes that we should "in
vade their [Muslim] countries, kill
their leaders and convert them to
Christianity." She's all about unity.
In a very special episode of
"Sesame Street." Tom Ridge joins
the cast to announce that they have
not only a word or color of the day,
but also a threat level. Won't it be
cute when Grover says the threat
level is "red"? Grover will then ex
plain: "Red. Red is for fire-trucks,
for cardinals and for the cold-heart
ed communist bastards who are de
stroying freedom."
In Condi's special appearance on
"The Berenstain Bears," she teach
es the children that she has a strong
belief that grandma may or may not
have cookies, that grandma has the
ability to bake the cookies and
therefore we must go to the cup
board and take the ingredients be
fore she makes them.
Then, former Secretary of State
John Ashcroft will duet with Bar
ney: "I love you. you love me. two
chicks don't make a family."
If these scenarios seem creepy or
Orwellian. I remind you that the Re
publicans are in power and Rums
feld likes to sing. Some people might
suggest that conservatives should
not be promoting their backward,
intolerant views on children. Some
people may suggest that teaching
tolerance to children is a good thing
and has been PBS's mission ever
since Big Bird. Some people suggest
that ISpellings has done a horrific
thing in suggesting that a lesbian
family is anything less than a healthy
family. And you know what? Some
people are right.
My heart goes out to the kids
whose show didn't get put on the air
simply because of an ignorant per
son in Washington.

Chris doesn't think Sponge-Bob's
sexual orientation matters so long as
he is anti-communist. Send com
plaints to cholt@stanford.edu.
