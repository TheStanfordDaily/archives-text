# Tales of a 19th-Grade Nothing
## Death on a beach cruiser 
### 
I often tell visitors to Stanford that
they are currently on the safest
piece of real estate in California.
As evidence, I cite the time a pack
age containing a DVD player was
delivered to my door over the holi
day break and was subsequently left
sitting between the door and screen
for nearly two weeks. When 1 re
turned. it was still there, untouched.
I don't worry about locking my
doors or windows, and 1 don't take
the face off my car stereo. I walk
around at any hour by myself and
regularly see other people do the
same.
1 mean, come on. it's a campus
whose most notorious crime spree,
at least since I've been here', in
volved an individual doing ride-by
gropings. Not to diminish the sever
ity of that crime, but if you called
that in on the campus of the Univer
sity of Miami, the police probably
wouldn't stop laughing long enough
to hang up on you. And before you
send in a bunch of nonsense about
"gateway crimes," let me just pre
emptively admit to some ill-advised
touching of my own as a younger
man, which has thus far not led me
to any violent crimes.

But just as the majority of cam
pus is safer than a June afternoon in
Mayberry, 1 have discovered that
Stanford is also home to the most
dangerous piece of real estate in
the state. A place where I've come
to believe, I will ultimately be
killed. | As a caveat, I should men
tion that I was an undergrad at a
place where you weren't even al
lowed to walk on the grass, and ev
eryone wore the same part of pants.
Safety was more than a foregone
conclusion — it was as obvious as
Michael Jackson's pedophilia.]
But back to the site of my upcom
ing demise —I'm sure you all
know the place I'm talking about
(especially the grad students). ..
It's White Plaza, and quite
frankly, it scares me to death.
Here's a picture which will be all
too familiar to most of you — and
chillingly so: A young coed in "Juicy"
couture velour sweatsuit and plat
form white nip-Hops, riding a bike
visibly too big for her and not doing a
very good job. This on its own is
daunting enough, but the kicker is —
and this is important kids so pay at
tention — she's on her cell phone.
Never mind the mindless drivel she's

spilling into it, she's now only got one
hand on the handlebars that she
could barely control with two, and
the part of her brain not filled up with
malt hops residue and midterm anxi
ety which was previously devoted to
obstacle avoidance is now commit
ted to gossip and that cute TA from I-
Hum. They say death will come on a
pale horse... I say, she pedals a
Schwinn.
Now, I've seen campus police
stage elaborate sting operations to
ticket bicyclists who ride at night
without headlights, a group who I
never considered particularly
threatening, but these little death
toting sirens keep riding along with
out a care in the world. If this were
an editorial, I'd call fora crackdown
— but it's not, so I won't. Suffice to
say, if you need me. I'll be the grad
student walking briskly through the
Plaza in a cold sweat, head on a swiv
el. watching for death on a beach
cruiser.
