## Soto Tape Chronicles Jordi's alma mater: Foosball University, home of champs 
### 
You wouldn't know it from my perfor
mance on the playing field, hut I come
from an illustrious family of athletic
achievers. Two weeks ago 1 wrote about my
grandfather and his basketball prowess. The

lineage did not stop there. My
father was the three-time
foosball champion of Daven
port College at Yale Univer
sity from 1968 to 1970.
Those were important
years in sports: Roberto
Clemente was collecting
3,(XX) hits. Bo Schembechler
was just beginning his domi
nance of Ohio State and

UCLA was in the midst of winning seven
straight NCAA titles. My dad spent those mo
mentous times awake all night in ivy-wrapped
gothic halls, peering through his thick-framed
glasses at the green plastic table top with the 22
plastic men hound to metal rods, watching a
small white hall careen off the sideboards.
Games costa nickel, and the challengers paid
to play.
Despite his litany of other achievements in
life, my dad takes pride in his college successes,
and when we moved to Pittsburgh 10 years ago
his officemates gave him a foosball table as a
parting gift. We set it up in the third floor study
room, and I spent a good portion of my middle
school evenings challenging my dad in progres
sively more competitive and contentious
matches.
1 got better as we played, and 1 learned from
him. I learned how to pass the ball between
players to get an open look. I learned how to
control awkward bounces and how to shoot an
gled shots from the wing. He taught me that to
spin the rod is tantamount to cheating and that
the rods should be well greased with WD-40.
He taught me that keeping one hand on the
goalie condemns you to a defensive-minded
strategy and stifles offensive creativity.
I have played on all types of foosball tables,
from our standard one at home to the flimsy
ones in dorm lounges that shudder with even
the slightest jostling of a rod. I've played 1-2-
5-3, 3-2-4-3 and 1-3-4-3 formations. I've
played on old "futbolin" tables in Spain, in
which the men are made of heavy cast iron,
are painted in realistic Barcelona and Madrid
jerseys and have two legs so that you can shoot
with either foot.
As my Stanford career winds to a close and
1 realize that I don't know what to do with my
life, 1 understand that I should look fora career
that plays to my strengths. Also, I know that ad
vanced degrees can help keep doors open for
later opportunities. With that in mind, 1 un
leashed my research skills and came across the
perfect match for me: graduate study at Foos
ball University. Foos-U, as the locals call it, of
fers a complete all-around education in the
skills and strategy of the game.
At Foos-U you can major in history and
learn about U.S. serviceman Lawrence Patter
son. who discovered the game while stationed
in Germany in 1960. When the Berlin Airlift
crisis was resolved, Patterson returned home
and marketed his product in the United
States, and Canada. Soon after, the first table
soccer leagues were founded, and the rest is
historv.
