# Women shut down UK
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team was dominant
over the weekend, proving itself more than worthy of
its No. 1 ranking.
Posting a 4-0 shutout against No. 14 Kentucky (6-
1), the Cardinal (5-0) clinched a record eighth title at
the ITA National Women's Team Indoor Champi
onship.
For 18 years, Wisconsin's A.C. Nielsen Tennis
Center has been the host to 16 of the nation's top
teams. And every year, the fast-paced competition
has sent all but the best of the best packing - with
only four schools claiming the title.
Following Stanford's lead. Florida has claimed six
titles, and Georgia three. Duke holds just one, after a
win over the Gators in 2003.
With the odds stacked against them, unseeded
Kentucky tried to break into the elite winner's circle
in its first Team Indoor appearance since 1989. After
unseating second-seeded Clemson in the first round,
5-2, and edging past sixth-seed Duke in the quarter
finals, 4-3, the Wildcats had only hope to propel their
tiring squad.
In the end, it was Stanford's seasoned and com
fortable position as the top seed that eased it into vic
tory over flagging Kentucky.
As an appropriate tournament closer for the de
fending champion Cardinal, sophomore Theresa
Logar claimed the final point for the second year in
a row. Logar, who is now 8-0 at the event, defeated
the Wildcats' Kim Coventry (20-5) in straight sets,
6-3,6-1.
"We knew Kentucky pretty well," Stanford head
coach Lele Forood said in a press release. "We
played them in the NCAA round of 16 last year and
1 liked how we matched up with them. We came out
strong in doubles today and carried that momentum
into singles."
For Logar and Coventry, the stakes were raised,
as both moved up from the No. 5 singles position at
NCAA's to No. 3 at Team Indoor. Following up on
last year's unfinished battle, both competitors ap
proached the Team Indoor final as a level, but un
certain playing field.

Logar ended Saturday's semifinal against No. 13
Georgia on a resounding note, turning the tables on
Caroline Basu to post a 5-7,6-1,6-0 victory.
Coventry endured a more taxing three-setter in
the semifinal against Duke's Jenny Zika, as Zika
saved seven match points in a tiebreaker to force a
third set. Coventry came out on top, 6-4, 6-7 (10),
6-3.
Logar and three other Stanford singles players
quickly bounced back from hard-fought contests
against Georgia in what Forood described as a "real
dramatic match."
In the top singles slot, two-time defending NCAA
Singles Champion Amber Liu, a junior, struggled
against No. 10 Shadisha Robinson (22-4), coming
just a few points from dropping the third set, 6-3,2-6,
5-3, before Logar sealed the team's fate.
Stanford's No. 22 Erin Burdette (9-3), a senior,
weathered another setback after dropping a straight
set decision to Washington's unranked Dinka Hadz
ic in the quarterfinals, 6-2,6-4. Backed by a win over
Northwestern's top-ranked Audra Cohen in the
opening round, Georgia's No. 39 Natalie Frazier
looked to overpower Burdette at 6-2,6-7,1-0.
Much like Logar, sophomore Anne Yelsey tight
ened up her game to upset the Bulldogs' Jitka Schon
feldova at No. 6 singles, 3-6,6-1,6-1.
Pleased with the Stanford squad's strong showing
in doubles, Forood took the semifinal ups and downs
in stride.
"It doesn't feel like Team Indoors if we don't play
the Bulldogs," Forood said. "They put up a great
fight today."
The doubles tandem of Liu and Yelsey (5-2)
racked up an 8-3 victory over Kentucky's Coventry
and Joelle Schwenk (17-7)
Freshmen Whitney Deason and Lejla Hodzic (9-
1) appeared in top form, clinching an 8-2 decision
over Lara Maurer and Christine Simpson.
As for the Wildcats, who have steadily moved up
the rankings since a 2003 slump at No. 34, there is al
ways next year.
The Cardinal return to action on Thursday, fac
ing off against No. 41 Sacramento State (3-2) at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium. Match play begins
at 1:30 p.m.

the semifinal against Duke's Jenny Zika, as Zika
saved seven match points in a tiebreaker to force a
third set. Coventry came out on top, 6-4, 6-7 (10),
6-3.
Logar and three other Stanford singles players
quickly bounced back from hard-fought contests
against Georgia in what Forood described as a "real
dramatic match."
In the top singles slot, two-time defending NCAA
Singles Champion Amber Liu, a junior, struggled
against No. 10 Shadisha Robinson (22-4), coming
just a few points from dropping the third set, 6-3,2-6,
5-3, before Logar sealed the team's fate.
Stanford's No. 22 Erin Burdette (9-3), a senior,
weathered another setback after dropping a straight
set decision to Washington's unranked Dinka Hadz
ic in the quarterfinals, 6-2,6-4. Backed by a win over
Northwestern's top-ranked Audra Cohen in the
opening round, Georgia's No. 39 Natalie Frazier
looked to overpower Burdette at 6-2,6-7,1-0.
Much like Logar, sophomore Anne Yelsey tight
ened up her game to upset the Bulldogs' Jitka Schon
feldova at No. 6 singles, 3-6,6-1,6-1.
Pleased with the Stanford squad's strong showing
in doubles, Forood took the semifinal ups and downs
in stride.
"It doesn't feel like Team Indoors if we don't play
the Bulldogs," Forood said. "They put up a great
fight today."
The doubles tandem of Liu and Yelsey (5-2)
racked up an 8-3 victory over Kentucky's Coventry
and Joelle Schwenk (17-7)
Freshmen Whitney Deason and Lejla Hodzic (9-
1) appeared in top form, clinching an 8-2 decision
over Lara Maurer and Christine Simpson.
As for the Wildcats, who have steadily moved up
the rankings since a 2003 slump at No. 34, there is al
ways next year.
The Cardinal return to action on Thursday, fac
ing off against No. 41 Sacramento State (3-2) at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium. Match play begins

Lejla Hodzic and the Stanford women's tennis team won the USTA/ITA
National Team Indoor Championship Sunday, by defeating Kentucky 4-0
in Madison.
The Stanford women's tennis team was dominant
over the weekend, proving itself more than worthy of
its No. 1 ranking.
Posting a 4-0 shutout against No. 14 Kentucky (6-
1), the Cardinal (5-0) clinched a record eighth title at
the ITA National Women's Team Indoor Champi
onship.
For 18 years, Wisconsin's A.C. Nielsen Tennis
Center has been the host to 16 of the nation's top
teams. And every year, the fast-paced competition
has sent all but the best of the best packing - with
only four schools claiming the title.
Following Stanford's lead. Florida has claimed six
titles, and Georgia three. Duke holds just one, after a
win over the Gators in 2003.
With the odds stacked against them, unseeded
Kentucky tried to break into the elite winner's circle
in its first Team Indoor appearance since 1989. After
unseating second-seeded Clemson in the first round,
5-2, and edging past sixth-seed Duke in the quarter
finals, 4-3, the Wildcats had only hope to propel their
tiring squad.
In the end, it was Stanford's seasoned and com
fortable position as the top seed that eased it into vic
tory over flagging Kentucky.
As an appropriate tournament closer for the de
fending champion Cardinal, sophomore Theresa
Logar claimed the final point for the second year in
a row. Logar, who is now 8-0 at the event, defeated
the Wildcats' Kim Coventry (20-5) in straight sets,
6-3,6-1.
"We knew Kentucky pretty well," Stanford head
coach Lele Forood said in a press release. "We
played them in the NCAA round of 16 last year and
1 liked how we matched up with them. We came out
strong in doubles today and carried that momentum
into singles."
For Logar and Coventry, the stakes were raised,
as both moved up from the No. 5 singles position at
NCAA's to No. 3 at Team Indoor. Following up on
last year's unfinished battle, both competitors ap
proached the Team Indoor final as a level, but un
certain playing field.

Logar ended Saturday's semifinal against No. 13
Georgia on a resounding note, turning the tables on
Caroline Basu to post a 5-7,6-1,6-0 victory.
Coventry endured a more taxing three-setter in
the semifinal against Duke's Jenny Zika, as Zika
saved seven match points in a tiebreaker to force a
third set. Coventry came out on top, 6-4, 6-7 (10),
6-3.
