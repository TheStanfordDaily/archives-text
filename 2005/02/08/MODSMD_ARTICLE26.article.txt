# Wrestlers struggle against Fresno State, Devils
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford senior co-captain and defend
ing 157-pound NCAA champion Matt Gen
try had been a lock for team points for over
a year. This all changed on Friday, when
Gentry's consecutive win streak ended at
64; he lost a dual match against No. 17 Jim
Medeiros from Fresno State. Gentry's last
loss came in the 2003 NCAA tournament.
Like its captain, the Stanford wrestling
team (5-7-1, 1-4-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
had a harsh homecoming to Burnham
Pavilion after two-and-a-half months on
the road. The Cardinal fell to Fresno State
25-12 and then lost to No. 14 Arizona State
27-12.
Fresno State (8-6-1) came to the Farm
looking to avenge last year's loss to Stan
ford and win another match for their coach,
Dennis DeLiddo, who will retire after the
end of this season. The Bulldogs jumped
out to a 9-0 lead after a minor decision and
a Stanford forfeit at 133 pounds. Sopho
more Juston Johnson is still resting a nag
ging elbow injury that has kept him out of
the starting lineup for two weeks, and the
Cardinal have been forced to forfeit at least
one weight class in their past five dual
meets.
Freshman 141-pounder Rafael Chavez

Matt Gentry suffered his first loss in 65 matches on Friday as the Cardinal were defeated first by Fresno State and then by Arizona State.
got Stanford on the board in dra
matic fashion. Chavez was behind
for his entire match until he caught
Garrett Spooner's arm and then
flipped the Bulldog onto his back
and held him down for the pin. The
fantastic takedown-pin combina
tion ignited the Stanford bench
and switched the momentum in
the Cardinal's favor.
Another freshman, 149-pound
Josh Zupancic, continued the
comeback in his match. Zupancic
wrestled impressively, notching
two takedowns, including one at
the end of the match in his 5-1 vic
tory over Dan Cadwallader.
With the score tied 9-9, the
weekend's marquee matchup took

to the mat. Even though Stanford
wrestling fans are used to pencil
ing Gentry into the win column.
Cientry knew going in that
Medeiros would be one of his
toughest matches of the year. The
Bulldog is a familiar foe that had
pushed Gentry to double overtime
before.
The match was close through
out. In regulation Gentry scored
one point on an escape and
Medeiros was penalized one point
for stalling. Medeiros executed an
escape and was awarded one point
for riding time to tie the match as
regulation expired.
Medeiros took the bottom posi
tion to begin the extra frame. Gen
try successfully rode his opponent
for close to 30 seconds, but
Medeiros was able to pull a bril
liant two-point reversal to take the
4-2 lead. Gentry was able to get a
one-point escape, but he could not

get the two-point takedown he
needed to extend his consecutive
win streak any further*. The 4-3
loss foreshadowed the ensuing
Cardinal defeat.
After Gentry's loss, Fresno State
took control of the dual meet by win
ning three matches in a row to ex
tend its lead to 18-9. The Bulldogs
were victorious over key Stanford
wrestlers, including 164-pound
freshman Scott Loescher and 174-
pound junior co-captain Imad Khar
hush. The Cardinal got one more
victory out of 184-pound junior
Ryan Hagen, who won a 6-4 deci
sion. However. Fresno State took
both of the upper weight classes to
seal the match.
The next afternoon, Stanford
faced conference-leading Arizona
State (8-6-1, 5-0-0 Pac-10), the
odds-on favorites to win the Pac
-10 Championships later this
month. The Sun Devils dominated

the beginning of the meet, jumping
out to a 17-0 lead.
Stanford finally got on the
board when the Cardinal captains
rebounded from their losses the
night before. Kharbush pinned
Rick Ren/.i in one minute, while
Gentry recorded a 4-1 decision
over Brian Stith. Kharbush is now
14-3 in dual meets this year. Zu
pancic had a standout weekend,
garnering his second win in as
many days with a 3-1 decision.
Arizona State won the other
seven weight classes, including two
major decision victories for the
dominant Sun Devil upper
weights. No. 4 Cain Velasquez and
Ryan Bader.
Stanford has little time to re
group. ;is Cal Poly (3-10. 0-4), will
visit the Farm on Wednesday night
at 7 p.m. The Cardinal will close out
their regular season against UC-
Davis (4-4-1) on Saturday at 7 p.m.
