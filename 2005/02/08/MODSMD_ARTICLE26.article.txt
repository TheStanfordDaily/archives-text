# Wrestlers struggle against Fresno State, Devils

### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Stanford senior co-captain and defend
ing 157-pound NCAA champion Matt Gen
try had been a lock for team points for over
a year. This all changed on Friday, when
Gentry's consecutive win streak ended at
64; he lost a dual match against No. 17 Jim
Medeiros from Fresno State. Gentry's last
loss came in the 2003 NCAA tournament.
Like its captain, the Stanford wrestling
team (5-7-1, 1-4-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
had a harsh homecoming to Burnham
Pavilion after two-and-a-half months on
the road. The Cardinal fell to Fresno State
25-12 and then lost to No. 14 Arizona State
27-12.
Fresno State (8-6-1) came to the Farm
looking to avenge last year's loss to Stan
ford and win another match for their coach,
Dennis DeLiddo, who will retire after the
end of this season. The Bulldogs jumped
out to a 9-0 lead after a minor decision and
a Stanford forfeit at 133 pounds. Sopho
more Juston Johnson is still resting a nag
ging elbow injury that has kept him out of
the starting lineup for two weeks, and the
Cardinal have been forced to forfeit at least
one weight class in their past five dual
meets.
