## 
### LI TAO 
Three professional journalists
discussed the public's apparent dis
appointment in the American media
at a panel discussion at the Lucie
Stern Community Center in Palo
Alto Saturday morning.
Panelists included Phillip Davis,
Miami correspondent for National
Public Radio; Julia Powell, freelance
television and documentary produc
er for PBS Frontline and ABC News
;and Frances Robles, Bogota bureau
chief for the Miami 1 ierald. All three
speakers are currently at Stanford
on Knight Fellowships, which allow
professionals in the field to spend a
year attending classes at Stanford.
"Many news organizations are
run by businessmen, not journal
ists," Powell said. "It's a delicate bal
ance between what the reader needs
to know and what the reader wants
to know. You don't want to pander
to the audience."
Davis said that adjusting to tech
nology and competition from 24-
hour news outlets such as CNN
posed other challenges.
"NPR started out as a quirky, al
ternative news source," he said. "As
we grew, we tried to cover more
mainstream news and each of our
stories became shorter."
The panelists also addressed
more positive aspects of the modern
news business. Robles noted that
local news media in Nicaragua

helped uncover evidence of vote rig
ging several years ago.
"Foreign correspondents often
ignore local news, but it is important
to cover diversity," she said.
The panel members agreed that
American readers typically lack in
terest in international issues, and
sometimes journalists must opt to
cover interesting stories that might
not be newsworthy in order to ap
peal to the public.
Although Powell praised re
porters in Iraq who "face a danger
ous environment to provide a bal
anced view of the situation," she
warned against the current presiden
tial administration's tendency to
manage the flow of information.
The panelists said that journalists
are self-censoring themselves be
cause they do not want to make an
enemy of the White House.
The conference was sponsored
by the Palo Alto branch of the
American Association of University
Women in addition to various other
local organizations.
Relly Davidson, assistant for the
Knight Fellowship program, said
that the Knight Fellows often partic
ipate in panel discussions such as the
one on Saturday, which are open to
the general public.
James Bettinger, director of the
Knight Fellowship program, said
that the issues discussed in the
panel are also covered in classes
taught at Stanford.
