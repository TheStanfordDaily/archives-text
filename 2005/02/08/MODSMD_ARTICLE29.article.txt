# Study shows freshmen need to work
## 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
A record-high percentage of col
lege freshmen expect to work during
college, according to a recent report
released by the Higher Education
Research Institute.
The report, entitled "The Ameri
can Freshman: National Norms for
Fall 2(X)4," indicated that 47.2 per
cent of rising freshmen in 2(X)4 said
that there is a "very good chance"
that they will work during school to
help offset college expenses. This is
up from 47 percent in 2003 and a
record low of 35.3 percent in 1989.
While few freshmen expect to work
full time (6.3 percent), this number is
also at a record high.
The report indicates that more
women than men plan on working,
regardless of their family's econom
ic standing. For women, 53.3 per
cent said that there was a good
chance of them working, compared
with 39.6 percent of men â€” reveal
ing a growing gender gap.

At Stanford, approximately 500
students partake in the work-study
program, constituting 10 percent
of the student body. However this
is a subset of the total number of
students actually working, since
this figure does not include any
students who work off-campus or
have on-campus jobs not affiliated
with work-study programs.
While many Stanford students
work to help pay off educational
loans, others hold down a job to keep
spending money in their wallets.
Freshman Laura Holmes
cranked out espresso drinks for 10
to 15 hours per week at Starbuck's
during fall quarter.
She said that she took the job be
cause she needed money to pay for
her laptop, textbooks and basic liv
ing expenses. However, she also
worked because she wants to be
able to help her parents pay for tu
ition in the future.
"The way things worked out with
financial aid. my parents feel a little
bit tight." Holmes said. "I would like

to be able to save some money so
that year by year I could contribute
more toward my tuition."
Others, like freshman Sahaja
Acharya, work to fulfill the quarter
ly requirement that is part of their fi
nancial aid packages. Acharya cur
rently interns eight hours a week at
the Asian Liver Center on campus to
earn the $800 per quarter that is re
quired of her.
The report also indicates a steady
increase in the number of students
planning to rely on loans to cover
their first-year educational expens
es. This year, 29.6 percent of fresh
men plan on taking out at least
$3,000 in loans in comparison to 24.1
percent in 2001.
Mary Morrison, director of funds
management at the Financial Aid
Office, said that Stanford has rela
tively lax job requirements for stu
dents taking out loans.
"Students can decide how much
loan and how much job they want,"
she said. "For example, if a student
needs $5,000, they can borrow

$3,(XX) and earn $2,(XX), or they can
borrow the whole $S,(XX). We do
everything we can from keeping stu
dents from working more than 12 to
15 hours a week."
Even this amount of work hours
can be difficult for students on top of
a full-time study schedule. Holmes
opted not to hold down her job with
Starbuck's this quarter because of
the additional stress.
"I was just too busy with school
and everything," she said. "But 1
think that working for an off-cam
pus employer maybe a lot more
difficult because they wouldn't
schedule around my crazy hours.
And then I felt an obligation to
ward those 1 worked with so I
would go even when 1 had a big as
signment, and it probably wasn't
the best idea."
Acharya agrees that maintaining
a job and maintaining grades can be
taxing.
"During mid-terms and finals it's
a bit of a crunch," she said. "Really
quite a crunch."
