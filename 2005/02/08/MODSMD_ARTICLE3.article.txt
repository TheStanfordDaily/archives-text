# Students launch Roosevelt think tank
## 
### JENNIE KIM PAM SUD 
Following Election Day last November. Stan
ford students campaigning for Sen. John Kerry,
Democratic presidential candidate, were pre
sented with the challenging task of promoting
progressive political activism despite their can
didate's defeat.
In an effort to regroup, sophomore Ouinn
Wilhelmi and political science graduate student
Kai Stinchcombe began toying with the idea of
pioneering a think tank to facilitate the sharing
of research between students and academia, the
media and the government.
Three months of exchanging e-mails, making
conference calls and holding caffeine-fueled
meetings at the CoHo led to the founding of the
Roosevelt Institution, the nation's first student
run think tank, which will make its official debut
to the Stanford community at 9 p.m. in Tresid

der's Oak Lounge.
Titled "A Rendezvous with Destiny," the
event will introduce the Institution's mission,
showcase several student policy presentations
and include a video message from members of
the Institution's sister branch at Yale Universi
ty. A jazz band will perform and refreshments
will be served.
"Progressive students are already generating
smart, bold ideas in their classes everyday." said
Stinchcombe, president of the think tank. "The
Roosevelt Institution fills a huge, but relatively
simple, need by providing an infrastructure to
forward those ideas to the public, to influence
the decision makers."
Stinchcombe served as president of the Stan
ford Democrats in the fall.
Wilhelmi also added that "the Roosevelt In
stitution is about both influencing the current
national debate and about training the next gen

eration for leadership."
Named for three famous American progres
sives — Presidents Franklin Delano and
Theodore Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor
Roosevelt — the institution houses 12 issue-fo
cused research centers, with eight to 20 student
fellows working at each.
The name of tonight's event was taken from a
line in Franklin Roosevelt's 1932 victory speech.
"This generation of Americans has a ren
dezvous with destiny," he said.
Wilhelmi and Stinchcombe said they be
lieve that his statement applies to today's gen
eration as well.
The think tank already boasts 200 student
members or "fellows."
The directors of each center within the insti
tution will report to senior Mattie Hutton, the

center development director.
The Centers for International
Development, Democracy and
Health; Environment and Energy;
Progressive Religious Perspec
tives; and Science, Technology,
Bioethics and Space announced
their respective launches and com
pleted their inaugural policy pa
pers last week.
Each policy center hopes to re
cruit more student fellows and facul
ty supporters at tonight's event.
Hoover Institution fellows at
Stanford stressed the importance of
quality work in determining the stu
dent think tank's success.
"I think it's a great thing that
students want to become engaged
in the policy process," said Larry
Diamond, a Hoover senior fellow
and political science professor.
"While I don't dismiss the possibil
ity that (the Roosevelt Institution]
can produce innovative research
and policy that is creative in its rec
ommendations, they need a quality
control process in order to be taken
seriously."
Bill Evers. a Hoover research fel
low. said that i! Roosevelt Institution
fellows produce work "as good or
better than those produced by
Ph. D.sin professional think tanks,
then they will have an influence."
According to its founders, the

Roosevelt Institution is not affiliated
with any political party.
"We're not seeing progressive
ideas from any part of the political
spectrum," Stinchcombe said.
"We'd encourage leaders from any
party to adopt our proposals."
Wilhelmi, the executive director,
emphasized ideology over partisan
ship.
"Our ideology is progressive —
not just Democrats and Republi
cans but a new kind of politics
unique to our generation," he said.
"It's not about bigger government
or smaller government, but better
government. Not left, not right, but
forward."
The Roosevelt Institution aims
to create a national network of stu
dent think tanks that provide orga
nizational infrastructure to get stu
dent ideas into the public dis
course.
The branch at Yale was formed
independently, but chose to adopt
the same name as Stanford's chapter
last month and a centralized nation
al board of directors will manage the
Web site, publications and the ulti
mate ideology of the institution. The
national organization will also pro
vide financial support for each chap
ter.
Yet according to Wilhelmi, the
vast majority of work will be done on
the local-university level.
"Students nationwide came up
with a similar idea at the same time
we did and realized we'd be much
stronger working together than we
could ever be independently — it's

that kind of broad-based solidarity
that speaks to the potential of a pro
gressive student organization," Wil
helmi said.
Diamond said Roosevelt Institu
tion officers should focus on "a strat
egy of sustainability," and recom
mended that they hire "a skeletal
permanent staff" of administrators.
"They're students — they have
other commitments besides just
doing policy research." he added.
Wilhelmi said the Roosevelt In
stitution is currently operating on
"small private donations" and re
cently finished a business model to
present to private donors and grant
foundations.
Other Roosevelt Institution fea
tures include "a Hoover Watch team
to keep tabs on our more-conserva
tive cousin on campus and an Advi
sory Board of prominent policy advi
sors and mentors," said the sopho
more Vilas Rao, the public relations
director.
Officers are busy working on a
lull schedule of events for the rest of
the year.
"We're beginning a discussion se
ries that focuses on policy and pro
gressivism — where they intersect,
and how progressive research can in
form policy," said sophomore Kevin
Hilke, the event director.
Hilke added that a regular lun
cheon series featuring prominent fel
lows is also in the works. Both series
are scheduled to launch toward the
end of the quarter. A gala event fea
turing a keynote speaker is set for
April.
