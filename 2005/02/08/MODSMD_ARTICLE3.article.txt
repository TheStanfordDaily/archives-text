# Students launch Roosevelt think tank
## 
### JENNIE KIM PAM SUD 
Following Election Day last November. Stan
ford students campaigning for Sen. John Kerry,
Democratic presidential candidate, were pre
sented with the challenging task of promoting
progressive political activism despite their can
didate's defeat.
In an effort to regroup, sophomore Ouinn
Wilhelmi and political science graduate student
Kai Stinchcombe began toying with the idea of
pioneering a think tank to facilitate the sharing
of research between students and academia, the
media and the government.
Three months of exchanging e-mails, making
conference calls and holding caffeine-fueled
meetings at the CoHo led to the founding of the
Roosevelt Institution, the nation's first student
run think tank, which will make its official debut
to the Stanford community at 9 p.m. in Tresid

der's Oak Lounge.
Titled "A Rendezvous with Destiny," the
event will introduce the Institution's mission,
showcase several student policy presentations
and include a video message from members of
the Institution's sister branch at Yale Universi
ty. A jazz band will perform and refreshments
will be served.
"Progressive students are already generating
smart, bold ideas in their classes everyday." said
Stinchcombe, president of the think tank. "The
Roosevelt Institution fills a huge, but relatively
simple, need by providing an infrastructure to
forward those ideas to the public, to influence
the decision makers."
Stinchcombe served as president of the Stan
ford Democrats in the fall.
Wilhelmi also added that "the Roosevelt In
stitution is about both influencing the current
national debate and about training the next gen

eration for leadership."
Named for three famous American progres
sives — Presidents Franklin Delano and
Theodore Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor
Roosevelt — the institution houses 12 issue-fo
cused research centers, with eight to 20 student
fellows working at each.
The name of tonight's event was taken from a
line in Franklin Roosevelt's 1932 victory speech.
"This generation of Americans has a ren
dezvous with destiny," he said.
Wilhelmi and Stinchcombe said they be
lieve that his statement applies to today's gen
eration as well.
The think tank already boasts 200 student
members or "fellows."
The directors of each center within the insti
tution will report to senior Mattie Hutton, the
