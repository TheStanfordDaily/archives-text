# Zimbardo takes unique approach to human nature
## 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Covering the full spectrum of
human instinct — from evil and
terrorism to sexuality and relation
ships, — Psychology Prof. Philip
Zimhardo's winter quarter class
"Exploring Human Nature: A
Life-changing Experience," is a
class on campus that may prompt
students to reconsider how they
live their lives.
"The class goes to the heart of
the big issues that we face as hu
mans," said Sean Bruich. one of the
head teaching assistants for the
class. "It's an incredible opportuni
ty to bring science and the scientif
ic method to things normally re
served for religion or philosophy.
The class allows science to take a
look into pertinent, interesting,
poignant questions."
The course includes an optional
Wednesday section, during which
guest speakers discuss personal ex
periences relevant to class topics.
Speakers include Deborah Layton,
who was a member of Jim Jones' in
famous Peoples' Temple cult for
seven years until she left right before
the group committed mass suicide in
1978; James Breckenridge, an expert
on the psychology of terrorism; and
Veronica Monet, a former escort
who turned into an advocate for sex
workers' rights.
Some of these lecturers have been
the source of controversy on campus.
"There are really lots of rumors
about what we are doing in the class

and a lot are not quite true," Bruich
said. "For instance, there is a big dif
ference between bringing in strip
pers and bringing in somebody to
talk about sexuality. It's important
that people understand the educa
tional value of what we are doing."

Another unique element of the
class is the "self-change project,"
during which students have the op
portunity to modify a problematic
aspect of their lives with the help of
their teaching assistant.
Students can choose to conduct

projects in the areas of dating and re
lationships, fears and phobias, hope,
prejudice, shyness, strengths and
virtues or perspectives on the future.
"The self-change component
stems from Zimbardo's belief that
you can really use psychology to
change lives," Bruich said. "Psychol
ogy should really be applicable and
pulled into life to make a difference
beyond the classroom."
Projects range from sophomore
Jia Hou's attempt to increase her ac
ceptance of disagreements to senior
Bret Bechis' effort to "overcome the
fear of stalling on the highway." Nic
Markman decided to use the project
to create a more hopeful outlook for
his own future.
"As a senior I wanted to become
more optimistic about what I'm
doing next year," he said. "Given
that 1 do what I am supposed to. I
think that it can legitimately help."
Many of the students said they
consider themselves lucky to be able
to participate in the course.
"Being retired. I think Zimbar
do just wanted to make the most in
teresting, fun class he could,"
Markman said.
Bruich said that Zimbardo enjoys
teaching the course because many of
his students enjoy taking it.
"This is an incredible opportunity
for the students to take some of the
topics that Zimbardo really loves
and has done a lot of research on,"
Bruich said. "He spends so much
time working on classes, making
each lecture the best one he gives."
Zimbardo refused to comment.
