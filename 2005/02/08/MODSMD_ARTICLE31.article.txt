### JOHN MITCHELL THE DARTMOUTH 
(U-WIRE) HANOVER. N.H. — Applica
tions to most Ivy League schools swelled this year,
reaching record highs at several schools including
Dartmouth College.
More than 12.5(X) students applied for accep
tance into Dartmouth's Class of 2(X)9. marking an
8 percent increase in applications. The previous
high was 11,855 applicants for the Class of 2007,
but the slight drop for the Class of 2(X)8 was mir
rored in many other school's applicant pools.
Dean of Admissions Karl Furstenberg
characterized Dartmouth's rise in applica
tions as "solid."
While the College's recovery from last year's
drop is impressive. Brown University's resur
gence was even more so. This year, 16,798 stu
dents applied to Brown, which is well above the
school's previous all-time high.

"We are up about 10 percent for African-
American applications, (and] 5 percent for Latino
and Asian-American applications," Brown's Di
rector of Admissions Michael Goldberger said.
While the total number of minority applications
may have increased, the applicant pool grew more
than 10 percent, making Latino and Asian appli
cants an even smaller portion of the applicant class.
The increase in application numbers across the
Ivies has led many to speculate on how yield rates
might be affected.
"The yield on offers of admission will be very
competitive this year," Furstenburg said.
Goldberger, however, predicted that Brown
would see similar yield figures as it has in the past.
"My guess is we'll be similar to the last few years
— between 58 and 60 percent," Goldberger said.
Despite the higher numbers of applicants and
competition for their matriculation, Furstenburg
said the larger applicant pool would not signifi
cantly impact Dartmouth's admissions process.

Other Ivies also made impressive gains. In
particular. Harvard and Princeton universities
achieved institutional highs in applications.
Harvard received 22,717 applications for its
Class of 2009 and reported that record num
bers of applicants applied for early admission
fee waivers.
At Princeton, 16,077 students applied for ad
mission. topping the university's previous high of
15,725 applicants for its Class of 2007.
Yale received about 19,430 applications for the
Class of 2009. Yale's admissions office, however,
holds out hope that as applications continued to
trickle in.the university will surpass its record
high of 19,674.
The University of Pennsylvania received
record numbers of Early Decision applications
but has not yet made public its regular decision
numbers.
Cornell University has also not yet compiled
and released its applications statistics.
