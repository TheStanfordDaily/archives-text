# Cardinal gymnasts look to improve
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"If you build it..." is the slogan
on the No. 26 women's gymnastics
team's promotional poster this
seaso. The phrase is designed to re

fleet the increase in the program's
success over the past four years and
its hope to build on that success this
year.
Coincidentally, however, the slo
gan also reflects this season's score
board.

The Cardinal (2-1) opened their
season with a score of 192.425. They
have built on that score by about one
lull point at each successive meet --
earning a 193.125 two weeks ago and
a 194.675 this past weekend against
No. 14 Central Michigan.
At this rate, Stanford is on track
fora perfect team score six weeks
from now at the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships.
Theoretically that is.
Theory aside, the Cardinal's per
formance this past weekend was a
solid step forward. Although their
score was not enough to outdo the
Chippewas, who scored a 195.925, it
was over a point-and-a-half im
provement over last week's score.
That is a considerable jump, espe
cially since the team was on the
road.
"We made some nice, steady
progress this weekend, and we want
to continue to build and add more
difficulty and more skills to our rou
tines," head coach Kristen Smyth
said. "The team is committed to im
proving. They came back this week
end fired up to work hard and get
better."
The addition of junior captain
Natalie Foley and freshman Tabitha
Yim to the lineup helped to consid
erably boost the team's score.
Yim, whom Smyth predicts to be
one of the best athletes to grace the
mats at Stanford, made her debut in
collegiate competition on the un
even bars and the balance beam.
The fourth-place finisher at
Olympic Trials earned a season
high score for the team on beam
with a 9.825 to take second place on
the event.
Yim also put up a second-place
finish on bars. She scored a 9.85.
even though she completed a wa
tered-down double-tuck dismount
to protect her recuperating Achilles
tendon.
"Tabitha was phenomenal,"
Smyth said. "She did her routines
beautifully and was a great leader on
the floor, especially fora freshman.
She was very consistent, calm, and
confident, just like she is in practice."
Fellow freshman Liz Tricase won
the uneven bars for the third straight
meet with her high-power release
moves and excellent technique.
After scoring a 9.925, Tricase is now
ranked third in the nation on the un
even bars behind 2000 Olympians
Kristen Maloney of UCLA and de
fending collegiate bar champion
Elise Ray of Michigan.
Unfortunately, Tricase sprained
her ankle stretching before balance
beam, the last event of the evening
on Friday. Although the ankle is not
bruised or swollen. Smvth said it will

be about two weeks before Tricase
can return to the lineup.
Tricase is the fourth of the 11
gymnasts on the team to sprain her
ankle this season, following what
seems to be an eerie pattern set by
junior captain Jessica Louie, junior
Glyn Sweets and Foley.
"We've had some bad luck,"
Smyth said. "Not quite the icing on
the cake that we had wanted."
The good news, however, is that
Foley is set to return to competing
in the All-Around in next week
end's meet against No. 22 Arizona
State. Without Tricase. however,
the team will still lack sufficient
depth.
The lack of depth hurts Stanford
particularly on the vault. The Cardi
nal only put five girls up on vault for
the second straight meet this past
weekend and will do so again next
weekend. Usually six gymnasts com
pete on each event and the lowest
score is dropped.
They paid the price; vault was
Stanford's lowest scoring event of
the evening, with a total of 48.2.
Smyth hopes that score will increase
as the gymnasts upgrade the difficul
ty of their vaults and as eight-time
AU-American Foley returns to the
lineup.
Stanford made up some ground,
however, on the floor exercise. The
Chippewas outscored the Cardinal
on every other event except floor.
The two teams tied with a 48.95, a
season-high for Stanford.
"All of our floor routines have
10.0 start values and we've got some
really good performers with fun, up
beat routines," Smyth said. "We still
have room to upgrade our tumbling
and make floor really spectacular
this year.
Tricase led the team on floor with
a 9.85. Freshman Lauren Elmore
scored a 9.825, just a point of a toe
behind, with a routine set to high
power music from"The Matrix" and
"The Bourne Supremacy."
Elmore was the third consecu
tive freshman to finish first for the
Cardinal in the All-Around. She
recorded a career-best of 38.85 to
lake third in the meet. Her perfor
mance was particularly commend
able, because she faced the chal
lenge of starting Stanford on three
events. The starting position is not
only nerve-wracking, but tradition
ally low-scoring since it sets the
team's baseline score.
Elmore still has room to im
prove and plans to upgrade the dif
ficulty of her tumbling passes on
floor. The upgrades could be ready
for this weekend, when the Cardi
nal hit the road again to take on
Arizona State.

even though she completed a wa
tered-down double-tuck dismount
to protect her recuperating Achilles
tendon.
"Tabitha was phenomenal,"
Smyth said. "She did her routines
beautifully and was a great leader on
the floor, especially fora freshman.
She was very consistent, calm, and
confident, just like she is in practice."
Fellow freshman Liz Tricase won
the uneven bars for the third straight
meet with her high-power release
moves and excellent technique.
After scoring a 9.925, Tricase is now
ranked third in the nation on the un
even bars behind 2000 Olympians
Kristen Maloney of UCLA and de
fending collegiate bar champion
Elise Ray of Michigan.
Unfortunately, Tricase sprained
her ankle stretching before balance
beam, the last event of the evening
on Friday. Although the ankle is not
bruised or swollen. Smvth said it will

be about two weeks before Tricase
can return to the lineup.
Tricase is the fourth of the 11
gymnasts on the team to sprain her
ankle this season, following what
seems to be an eerie pattern set by
junior captain Jessica Louie, junior
Glyn Sweets and Foley.
"We've had some bad luck,"
Smyth said. "Not quite the icing on
the cake that we had wanted."
The good news, however, is that
Foley is set to return to competing
in the All-Around in next week
end's meet against No. 22 Arizona
State. Without Tricase. however,
the team will still lack sufficient
depth.
The lack of depth hurts Stanford
particularly on the vault. The Cardi
nal only put five girls up on vault for
the second straight meet this past
weekend and will do so again next
weekend. Usually six gymnasts com
pete on each event and the lowest
score is dropped.
They paid the price; vault was
Stanford's lowest scoring event of
the evening, with a total of 48.2.
Smyth hopes that score will increase
as the gymnasts upgrade the difficul
ty of their vaults and as eight-time
AU-American Foley returns to the
lineup.
Stanford made up some ground,
however, on the floor exercise. The
Chippewas outscored the Cardinal
on every other event except floor.
The two teams tied with a 48.95, a
season-high for Stanford.
"All of our floor routines have
10.0 start values and we've got some
really good performers with fun, up
beat routines," Smyth said. "We still
have room to upgrade our tumbling
and make floor really spectacular
this year.
Tricase led the team on floor with
a 9.85. Freshman Lauren Elmore
scored a 9.825, just a point of a toe
behind, with a routine set to high
power music from"The Matrix" and
"The Bourne Supremacy."
Elmore was the third consecu
tive freshman to finish first for the
Cardinal in the All-Around. She
recorded a career-best of 38.85 to
lake third in the meet. Her perfor
mance was particularly commend
able, because she faced the chal
lenge of starting Stanford on three
events. The starting position is not
only nerve-wracking, but tradition
ally low-scoring since it sets the
team's baseline score.
Elmore still has room to im
prove and plans to upgrade the dif
ficulty of her tumbling passes on
floor. The upgrades could be ready
for this weekend, when the Cardi
nal hit the road again to take on
Arizona State.

The women's gymnastics team faced No. 14 Central Michigan this past
weekend, posting an overall score of 194.675.
"If you build it..." is the slogan
on the No. 26 women's gymnastics
team's promotional poster this
seaso. The phrase is designed to re

fleet the increase in the program's
success over the past four years and
its hope to build on that success this
year.
Coincidentally, however, the slo
gan also reflects this season's score
board.

The Cardinal (2-1) opened their
season with a score of 192.425. They
have built on that score by about one
lull point at each successive meet --
earning a 193.125 two weeks ago and
a 194.675 this past weekend against
No. 14 Central Michigan.
At this rate, Stanford is on track
fora perfect team score six weeks
from now at the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships.
Theoretically that is.
Theory aside, the Cardinal's per
formance this past weekend was a
solid step forward. Although their
score was not enough to outdo the
Chippewas, who scored a 195.925, it
was over a point-and-a-half im
provement over last week's score.
That is a considerable jump, espe
cially since the team was on the
road.
"We made some nice, steady
progress this weekend, and we want
to continue to build and add more
difficulty and more skills to our rou
tines," head coach Kristen Smyth
said. "The team is committed to im
proving. They came back this week
end fired up to work hard and get
better."
The addition of junior captain
Natalie Foley and freshman Tabitha
Yim to the lineup helped to consid
erably boost the team's score.
Yim, whom Smyth predicts to be
one of the best athletes to grace the
mats at Stanford, made her debut in
collegiate competition on the un
even bars and the balance beam.
The fourth-place finisher at
Olympic Trials earned a season
high score for the team on beam
with a 9.825 to take second place on
the event.
Yim also put up a second-place
finish on bars. She scored a 9.85.
