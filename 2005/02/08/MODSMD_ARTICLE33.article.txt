The men's and women's track
teams continue to impress, earn
ing first-place finishes and setting
new Stanford records in a pletho
ra of indoor events. Their 2005 in
door seasons continued this past
Friday and Saturday at the Ar
mory Invitational in New York
City.
Two standout performances
included sophomore Janice
Davis' win in the 60-meter dash at
the Millrose Games and freshman
Erica McClain's win in the triple
jump at the Armory. The first
place finish in the triple jump was
McClain's second of the season,
and she set the school record yet
again with a jump of 44'11". Both
Davis and McClain currently hold
the best marks in the nation in
their respective events.
At the Armory, the teams
competed beautifully, securing
three first-place finishes and set
ting three new school records. The
highlight of the women's distance
running was freshman Laura Mot
taz's win in the 800-meter run with
a time of 2:12.33.
"This was Laura's second 8(X)
race ever," head women's coach
Edrick Floreal said. "She didn't

know she was going to be doing
the 8(X) at all this year. She's a hard
worker. She won by blowing ev
eryone away in the last 150 me
ters. She has no clue about the
race yet, just runs around and then
takes off at the end."
Stanford had tour women com
pete in the mile, and all made it
into the final round on Saturday.
The team produced the fourth,
sixth, ninth and lOth-place finish
ers in the championship race.
Those were sophomores Katy
Trotter and Arianna Lambie,
freshman Lauren Centrowitz and
senior Jeane Goff, respectively.
"This was their first time actu
ally doing it," Floreal said. "They
will improve the more and more
comfortable they are with the pac
ing. We still have a lot of work to
do with them." Floreal said.
All four earned provisional
NCAA qualifying marks in the
mile race. According to coach Flo
real, at this stage, "it's all about
hitting those NCAA marks." Goff
earned a provisional mark as well
in the 3.000-meter run. placing
sixth and running the 15-lap race
in 9:29.43.
The women's distance medley
team placed third in its relay event
and qualified for the NCAA's
with a time of 11:07.81, the third
fastest time in the nation. The
medley relay is composed of the
400-meter sprint, and the 800,
1200 and 1600-meter runs.

The Cardinal track teams both stood out at the Armory Invitational over
the weekend, where Stanford athletes claimed victory in a wide variety
of events.
The men's distance runners also
impressed the competition in New
York, placing well in the 800, mile
and 3,000-meter races. Redshirt
freshman Russel Brown made his
2005 debut in the mile, placing fifth
with a time of 4:04.94. Brown red
shitted his freshman indoor season
but has plenty of experience, as he
competed internationally with the
U.S. Junior National Track and
Field team.
Redshirt freshman Michael Gar
cia placed fifth in his first race of the
season as well, with a time of 1:50.82
in the 800-meter run. Sophomore
Jonathon Pierce finished sixth in the
3,000-meter run at the Armory.
On the sprinters' side, the com
petition was brutal, and only Davis
and two of the men's sprinters made
it into the finals.
Davis was on fire in the prelims.

setting a new school record in the 60-
meter dash of 7.32. two hundredths
of a second faster than her time in
the finals. Her time moved heron to
the 98th annual Millrose Games at
Madison Square Garden, where the
finals of the 60-meter dash took
place this year. Davis was the only
Stanford athlete to compete at the
elite collegiate and professional
meet, and showed she deserved to
be there when she took first place in
the 60-meter dash.
"It was a very, very good race,"
Floreal said. "Her will and desire to
be the best in the country is making
her more determined this year. Her
weakness is her acceleration from
the blocks, the first 30 meters. When
you're running the 60 everything is
about coming out of the blocks."
Along with the 60, Davis placed
fourth in the 200-meter dash, setting
a second school record in the finals
with a time of 23.82.
Freshman sprinter Wopamo Os
aisai made it into the finals of the

Redshirt freshman shot putter
Mike Macellari out-threw most of
the competition with his second
place throw of 53'-6 1/2".
As for McClain, the freshman
phenomenon has not "put every
thing together yet," Floreal said,
after her recent back-to-back wins.
"She's having a really good year
thus far, getting used to a complete
ly new coach and way of life," Flore
al said. "Living in a dorm room with
out mom and dad there to wake you
up takes getting used to."
