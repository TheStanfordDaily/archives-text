The men's and women's track
teams continue to impress, earn
ing first-place finishes and setting
new Stanford records in a pletho
ra of indoor events. Their 2005 in
door seasons continued this past
Friday and Saturday at the Ar
mory Invitational in New York
City.
Two standout performances
included sophomore Janice
Davis' win in the 60-meter dash at
the Millrose Games and freshman
Erica McClain's win in the triple
jump at the Armory. The first
place finish in the triple jump was
McClain's second of the season,
and she set the school record yet
again with a jump of 44'11". Both
Davis and McClain currently hold
the best marks in the nation in
their respective events.
At the Armory, the teams
competed beautifully, securing
three first-place finishes and set
ting three new school records. The
highlight of the women's distance
running was freshman Laura Mot
taz's win in the 800-meter run with
a time of 2:12.33.
"This was Laura's second 8(X)
race ever," head women's coach
Edrick Floreal said. "She didn't

know she was going to be doing
the 8(X) at all this year. She's a hard
worker. She won by blowing ev
eryone away in the last 150 me
ters. She has no clue about the
race yet, just runs around and then
takes off at the end."
Stanford had tour women com
pete in the mile, and all made it
into the final round on Saturday.
The team produced the fourth,
sixth, ninth and lOth-place finish
ers in the championship race.
Those were sophomores Katy
Trotter and Arianna Lambie,
freshman Lauren Centrowitz and
senior Jeane Goff, respectively.
"This was their first time actu
ally doing it," Floreal said. "They
will improve the more and more
comfortable they are with the pac
ing. We still have a lot of work to
do with them." Floreal said.
All four earned provisional
NCAA qualifying marks in the
mile race. According to coach Flo
real, at this stage, "it's all about
hitting those NCAA marks." Goff
earned a provisional mark as well
in the 3.000-meter run. placing
sixth and running the 15-lap race
in 9:29.43.
The women's distance medley
team placed third in its relay event
and qualified for the NCAA's
with a time of 11:07.81, the third
fastest time in the nation. The
medley relay is composed of the
400-meter sprint, and the 800,
1200 and 1600-meter runs.
