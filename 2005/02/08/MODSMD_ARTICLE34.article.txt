## 
### ABBY ZEITLIN STAFF WRITER 
The men's gymnastics team re
turned frustrated from last weekend's
Winter Cup, an individual meet spon
sored by the Federation ot Internation
al Gymnasts that does not count for the
NCAA ranking.
Eligibility for the meet, held in Las
Vegas, is contingent upon pre-qualilica
tion through membership on a national
team or by petition. Four of the Cardi
nal gymnasts pre-qualified, including
freshmen Chris Harper. Sho Nakamori
and David Sender, and sophomore
Jason Shen. The Cardinal also peti
tioned three men. although only sopho
more Dylan Carney was approved.
The Winter Cup used the new code
of points, which meant that the Cardinal
were trying to do difficult routines to
meet the new system. The competitions
are based on routine potential and how
often the athletes hit their routines. The
Cardinal Ux>k a risk this weekend, al
though the strategy did not pay off for
Sender or Nakamori.
Head coach Thorn Glielmi said
that he and the Cardinal are "keeping
our eye on the national team in Au

gust, and our performance now will
give us an advantage."
The team is now at a point where
they have assessed all strategies, and
Glielmi said that they "tire going to
slowly inch up [their] consistency and
confidence for the rest of the season."
Both Carney and Shen had strong
overall performances. Carney per
formed particularly well on the vault.
Although Shen's level of difficulty
was not as high as other team members',
he competed well.
Nakamori struggled on his best ex
ercise. the floor, after twisting his ankle
in the middle of his routine. Afterward,
he scratched the vault from his lineup to
avoid further injury.
Although the Cardinal did well
overall. Sender was the only team mem
ber to win an event. Sender was also the
only Cardinal member It) be awarded
one of the nine opening spots on the
U.S. National Team.
Despite Sender's win on the vault,
controversy shrouded his strongest
event, the rings. A problem with the
axle of points arose when he was not
given credit for his first skill. In total.
Sender lost four-tenths from the start
value, and in a sport where scoring

comes down to tractions of a point, each
tenth is a crucial difference.
Glielmi petitioned the score, but the
judges refused to amend it.
However, Sender graciously ac
knowledged that the "entire code of
points leaves much to be desired," and
that he is "going to go back to the gym
and work on the routines."
Sender was able to recover from his
disappointment on the rings to win the
vault with a score of 9.683, despite sus
taining an injury in warm-ups. In order
to have the vault score count, a gymnast
must perform two different routines.
Sender first performed a Yurchenko
with a two-and-a-half twist -- a round
off onto the board with a back hand
spring onto the vault and two-and-a
half twists in the air. Sender's second
vault was a Kasamatsu with a full twist,
which is a round off directly onto the
vault followed by two-and-a-half twists
in the air.
Sender s success in "staying really
clean" on the vault enabled him tograsp
the top spot in the competition and the
No. 13 spot in the national rankings.
The team reunites this week to pre
pare for the Nakamori Invitational this
Saturday night at Cal.
