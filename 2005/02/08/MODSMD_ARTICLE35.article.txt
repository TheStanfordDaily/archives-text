### MENAKA FERNANDO DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES —
While participating in a sacramental
ceremony in the Amazon basin of
South America during the late 1980s.
Dr. Charles Grob had a moment of
realization about the power of psy
chedelic substances used for thera
peutic purposes.
Grob, the director of the division
of child and adolescent psychiatry at
the Harbor-University of California
at Los Angeles Medical Center in
Torrance, Calif., was at the time in
vestigating the effects of the hallu
cinogenic concoction called
"ayahuasca" on a religious commu
nity in the Brazilian tropics — a sub
stance he had tried himself while in
Brazil.
Grob, who is currently conduct
ing a study of the effects of psilocy
bin — the chemical found in "magic
mushrooms" — on terminally ill
cancer patients, said he observed the
hallucinating Brazilian congrega
tion's heightened receptiveness to
accepting the priest's sermon of
leading a moral and responsible life.
Many of these congregants had
"risen from being at the bottom of
society and reformed their lives"
after attending the ceremonies,
Cirob said, leading him to be confi
dent in the potential benefits of psy
chedelic drugs.
Grob said the scene illustrates the
importance of subjects' states of
mind and the external environment
when administering psychedelic
drugs on patients — a philosophy
that Grob uses in his 2004 study of
psychedelics on cancer patients
nearing death.
Grob's study has attracted new
attention as a predecessor to a Har
vard Medical School study approved
in December by the Food and Drug
Administration that will test the ef
fects of the psychedelic drug
MDMA also on terminally ill cancer
patients. MDMA is better known as
the mind-altering drug ecstasy.
The research, having taken a hia
tus for over 20 years over the last
decade has seen a slow resurgence of
psychedelic research exciting the
lew psychiatrists that believe in hal
lucinogen-induced therapy across
the country.
Dr. John Halpern, the psychia
trist heading the study at Harvard,
says he embarked on the research
out of a blend of curiosity and a de
sire to help people. From past re
search and anecdotal experiences,
Halpern has confidence in the abili
ties of MDMA to ease the anxiety of
patients nearing death.
Halpern and a team of four doc
tors are currently waiting on a spe
cial Schedule 1 license from the
Drug Enforcement Agency to begin
administering the test. According to
the Controlled Substances Act of
1970, Schedule 1 drugs — which in
clude heroin, ecstasy, LSD, marijua

na and psilocybin, among other
drugs — have a high potential for
abuse and have no currently known
medical use.
Though Halpern's study has
needed to undergo "many layers of
approval," the psychiatrist says the
checks are all necessary and expects
DEA approval to come within the
next two months.
Once a study is approved, the psy
chiatric team faces the often difficult
task of recruiting subjects.
In Grob's case, finding suitable
patients has been challenging be
cause of the strict screening process
and reluctance on the patients' part
to undergo a study that acknowl
edges their unfortunate situations.
When a patient comes in to par
ticipate in Grob's study, they are
taken to a Harbor-UCLA hospital
room adorned with pink and lace
curtains and purple tie-dye decora
tions to create a comforting atmos
phere in which the hallucinogenic
psychotherapy can occur. Sitting in
his cluttered office surrounded by
marker-drawings by his daughter,
Grob emphasizes that the aim of the
treatment is in no way a physical
cure to the disease. It is aimed more
at easing feelings of depression and
anxiety as patients get closer to
death, he says.
Many in UCLA's psychiatry
community also believe in the value
of the study.
"We are all going to die. A lot of
people are sufficiently afraid of
dying so that the prospects of death
are stressful," said Mark Kleiman,
director of the Drug Policy Analysis
Program at UCLA. "This is an un
usually good time to think about
things that could be done to give
people an easier and mindful time of
it as they are dying," Kleiman said,
referring to the baby boomer gener
ation reaching old age.
A patient participating in Grob's
study undergoes two sessions ofdrug
administration — taking a capsule of
psilocybin during one session and a
placebo in a second session.
Though Grob's study allows the
evaluation of 20 patients, only three
have been tested. Two more were
scheduled to be studied, but died be
fore the screening process was over,
Grob said.
In the Harvard study. 12 patients
will be chosen to undergo MDMA
administration in conjunction with
psychotherapy, Halpern said. The
drug may allow the patients to mobi
lize and talk about issues that would
otherwise induce a panic reaction.
The drug could induce "a sense of
empathy, a feeling of well-being and
interconnectedness; and lack of
stress will allow the participant to
deepen the effects of psychothera
py," he said.
A similar study conducted by Dr.
Francisco Moreno at the University
of Arizona tested the effects of psilo
cybin psychotherapy on patients
with obsessive compulsive disorder.

The study was completed in Decem
ber and Moreno hopes to have the
data analyzed and published shortly,
he wrote in an e-mail.
"We are encouraged by the ob
servations and hope to continue this
line of research to favor the develop
ment of new therapeutics for this dis
abling disorder," he wrote.
There was a time when psychi
atric therapy was at "the cutting
edge" of scientific research, Grob
says, but had all but vanished from
the medical community's radar for
the last 25 years.
With its roots in Shamanistic tra
ditions and dating all the way back to
antiquity, psychedelic drugs were
discovered by Western scientists in
the 1940s — centuries after Euro
pean conquerors repressed their use
due to fears of pagan influence, all
according to an article written by
Grob.
But this widespread research ex
perienced a blow in the l%os and
'70s when hallucinogen use spread
rampantly among the youth of the
time and law officials began to curb
scientific uses of the substances.
With the force of law against them,
many researchers were encouraged to
stop their work until it eventually
faded as a legitimate science.
But, with FDA approval coming
to Dr. Michael Mithoefer, a psychia
trist in South Carolina, to test the ef
fects of MDMA on patients with
post traumatic stress disorder in
2001. psychedelic research seemed
to be re-emerging. "As the sleeping
giant of hallucinogen research
emerge ... it will perceive that the
world of psychiatry has vastly
changed from when it was put to
rest," Grob wrote in 199cS.
Most psychedelic researchers
agree that with the methodology and
technology available today, hallu
cinogenic therapy has the potential
to be grounded on sounder evidence
than in the past.
"I think the time is long overdue,"
said Dr. David Nichols, president of
the Heffter Research Institute,
which sponsors Grob's study.
"Why should psychedelics have
no medical utility?" he asks. " The
question is where and how we should
use it."
Though psychedelic research has
seen a new emergence in the last
decade, Halpern says studies in psy
chedelic therapy are rare in the
country — "I can count them all in
one hand."
And there is always the skeptic
who believes that the dangers that
hallucinogens pose to society far
outweigh the potential benefits.
Overall, most in academia are not
opposed to the learning opportunity
psychedelic research provides.
"No body knows whether it is a
good or not until the research is
done," Kleiman said.
And in the face of several barri
ers, Halpern emphasizes "you better
know what you are doing."

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES —
While participating in a sacramental
ceremony in the Amazon basin of
South America during the late 1980s.
Dr. Charles Grob had a moment of
realization about the power of psy
chedelic substances used for thera
peutic purposes.
Grob, the director of the division
of child and adolescent psychiatry at
the Harbor-University of California
at Los Angeles Medical Center in
Torrance, Calif., was at the time in
vestigating the effects of the hallu
cinogenic concoction called
"ayahuasca" on a religious commu
nity in the Brazilian tropics — a sub
stance he had tried himself while in
Brazil.
Grob, who is currently conduct
ing a study of the effects of psilocy
bin — the chemical found in "magic
mushrooms" — on terminally ill
cancer patients, said he observed the
hallucinating Brazilian congrega
tion's heightened receptiveness to
accepting the priest's sermon of
leading a moral and responsible life.
Many of these congregants had
"risen from being at the bottom of
society and reformed their lives"
after attending the ceremonies,
Cirob said, leading him to be confi
dent in the potential benefits of psy
chedelic drugs.
Grob said the scene illustrates the
importance of subjects' states of
mind and the external environment
when administering psychedelic
drugs on patients — a philosophy
that Grob uses in his 2004 study of
psychedelics on cancer patients
nearing death.
Grob's study has attracted new
attention as a predecessor to a Har
vard Medical School study approved
in December by the Food and Drug
Administration that will test the ef
fects of the psychedelic drug
MDMA also on terminally ill cancer
patients. MDMA is better known as
the mind-altering drug ecstasy.
The research, having taken a hia
tus for over 20 years over the last
decade has seen a slow resurgence of
psychedelic research exciting the
lew psychiatrists that believe in hal
lucinogen-induced therapy across
the country.
Dr. John Halpern, the psychia
trist heading the study at Harvard,
says he embarked on the research
out of a blend of curiosity and a de
sire to help people. From past re
search and anecdotal experiences,
Halpern has confidence in the abili
ties of MDMA to ease the anxiety of
patients nearing death.
Halpern and a team of four doc
tors are currently waiting on a spe
cial Schedule 1 license from the
Drug Enforcement Agency to begin
administering the test. According to
the Controlled Substances Act of
1970, Schedule 1 drugs — which in
clude heroin, ecstasy, LSD, marijua

na and psilocybin, among other
drugs — have a high potential for
abuse and have no currently known
medical use.
Though Halpern's study has
needed to undergo "many layers of
approval," the psychiatrist says the
checks are all necessary and expects
DEA approval to come within the
next two months.
Once a study is approved, the psy
chiatric team faces the often difficult
task of recruiting subjects.
In Grob's case, finding suitable
patients has been challenging be
cause of the strict screening process
and reluctance on the patients' part
to undergo a study that acknowl
edges their unfortunate situations.
When a patient comes in to par
ticipate in Grob's study, they are
taken to a Harbor-UCLA hospital
room adorned with pink and lace
curtains and purple tie-dye decora
tions to create a comforting atmos
phere in which the hallucinogenic
psychotherapy can occur. Sitting in
his cluttered office surrounded by
marker-drawings by his daughter,
Grob emphasizes that the aim of the
treatment is in no way a physical
cure to the disease. It is aimed more
at easing feelings of depression and
anxiety as patients get closer to
death, he says.
Many in UCLA's psychiatry
community also believe in the value
of the study.
"We are all going to die. A lot of
people are sufficiently afraid of
dying so that the prospects of death
are stressful," said Mark Kleiman,
director of the Drug Policy Analysis
Program at UCLA. "This is an un
usually good time to think about
things that could be done to give
people an easier and mindful time of
it as they are dying," Kleiman said,
referring to the baby boomer gener
ation reaching old age.
A patient participating in Grob's
study undergoes two sessions ofdrug
administration — taking a capsule of
psilocybin during one session and a
placebo in a second session.
Though Grob's study allows the
evaluation of 20 patients, only three
have been tested. Two more were
scheduled to be studied, but died be
fore the screening process was over,
Grob said.
In the Harvard study. 12 patients
will be chosen to undergo MDMA
administration in conjunction with
psychotherapy, Halpern said. The
drug may allow the patients to mobi
lize and talk about issues that would
otherwise induce a panic reaction.
The drug could induce "a sense of
empathy, a feeling of well-being and
interconnectedness; and lack of
stress will allow the participant to
deepen the effects of psychothera
py," he said.
A similar study conducted by Dr.
Francisco Moreno at the University
of Arizona tested the effects of psilo
cybin psychotherapy on patients
with obsessive compulsive disorder.

The study was completed in Decem
ber and Moreno hopes to have the
data analyzed and published shortly,
he wrote in an e-mail.
"We are encouraged by the ob
servations and hope to continue this
line of research to favor the develop
ment of new therapeutics for this dis
abling disorder," he wrote.
There was a time when psychi
atric therapy was at "the cutting
edge" of scientific research, Grob
says, but had all but vanished from
the medical community's radar for
the last 25 years.
With its roots in Shamanistic tra
ditions and dating all the way back to
antiquity, psychedelic drugs were
discovered by Western scientists in
the 1940s — centuries after Euro
pean conquerors repressed their use
due to fears of pagan influence, all
according to an article written by
Grob.
But this widespread research ex
perienced a blow in the l%os and
'70s when hallucinogen use spread
rampantly among the youth of the
time and law officials began to curb
scientific uses of the substances.
With the force of law against them,
many researchers were encouraged to
stop their work until it eventually
faded as a legitimate science.
But, with FDA approval coming
to Dr. Michael Mithoefer, a psychia
trist in South Carolina, to test the ef
fects of MDMA on patients with
post traumatic stress disorder in
2001. psychedelic research seemed
to be re-emerging. "As the sleeping
giant of hallucinogen research
emerge ... it will perceive that the
world of psychiatry has vastly
changed from when it was put to
rest," Grob wrote in 199cS.
Most psychedelic researchers
agree that with the methodology and
technology available today, hallu
cinogenic therapy has the potential
to be grounded on sounder evidence
than in the past.
"I think the time is long overdue,"
said Dr. David Nichols, president of
the Heffter Research Institute,
which sponsors Grob's study.
"Why should psychedelics have
no medical utility?" he asks. " The
question is where and how we should
use it."
Though psychedelic research has
seen a new emergence in the last
decade, Halpern says studies in psy
chedelic therapy are rare in the
country — "I can count them all in
one hand."
And there is always the skeptic

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES —
While participating in a sacramental
ceremony in the Amazon basin of
South America during the late 1980s.
Dr. Charles Grob had a moment of
realization about the power of psy
chedelic substances used for thera
peutic purposes.
Grob, the director of the division
of child and adolescent psychiatry at
the Harbor-University of California
at Los Angeles Medical Center in
Torrance, Calif., was at the time in
vestigating the effects of the hallu
cinogenic concoction called
"ayahuasca" on a religious commu
nity in the Brazilian tropics — a sub
stance he had tried himself while in
Brazil.
Grob, who is currently conduct
ing a study of the effects of psilocy
bin — the chemical found in "magic
mushrooms" — on terminally ill
cancer patients, said he observed the
hallucinating Brazilian congrega
tion's heightened receptiveness to
accepting the priest's sermon of
leading a moral and responsible life.
Many of these congregants had
"risen from being at the bottom of
society and reformed their lives"
after attending the ceremonies,
Cirob said, leading him to be confi
dent in the potential benefits of psy
chedelic drugs.
Grob said the scene illustrates the
importance of subjects' states of
mind and the external environment
when administering psychedelic
drugs on patients — a philosophy
that Grob uses in his 2004 study of
psychedelics on cancer patients
nearing death.
Grob's study has attracted new
attention as a predecessor to a Har
vard Medical School study approved
in December by the Food and Drug
Administration that will test the ef
fects of the psychedelic drug
MDMA also on terminally ill cancer
patients. MDMA is better known as
the mind-altering drug ecstasy.
The research, having taken a hia
tus for over 20 years over the last
decade has seen a slow resurgence of
psychedelic research exciting the
lew psychiatrists that believe in hal
lucinogen-induced therapy across
the country.
Dr. John Halpern, the psychia
trist heading the study at Harvard,
says he embarked on the research
out of a blend of curiosity and a de
sire to help people. From past re
search and anecdotal experiences,
Halpern has confidence in the abili
ties of MDMA to ease the anxiety of
patients nearing death.
Halpern and a team of four doc
tors are currently waiting on a spe
cial Schedule 1 license from the
Drug Enforcement Agency to begin
administering the test. According to
the Controlled Substances Act of
1970, Schedule 1 drugs — which in
clude heroin, ecstasy, LSD, marijua

na and psilocybin, among other
drugs — have a high potential for
abuse and have no currently known
medical use.
Though Halpern's study has
needed to undergo "many layers of
approval," the psychiatrist says the
checks are all necessary and expects
DEA approval to come within the
next two months.
Once a study is approved, the psy
chiatric team faces the often difficult
task of recruiting subjects.
In Grob's case, finding suitable
patients has been challenging be
cause of the strict screening process
and reluctance on the patients' part
to undergo a study that acknowl
edges their unfortunate situations.
When a patient comes in to par
ticipate in Grob's study, they are
taken to a Harbor-UCLA hospital
room adorned with pink and lace
curtains and purple tie-dye decora
tions to create a comforting atmos
phere in which the hallucinogenic
psychotherapy can occur. Sitting in
his cluttered office surrounded by
marker-drawings by his daughter,
Grob emphasizes that the aim of the
treatment is in no way a physical
cure to the disease. It is aimed more
at easing feelings of depression and
anxiety as patients get closer to
death, he says.
Many in UCLA's psychiatry
community also believe in the value
of the study.
"We are all going to die. A lot of
people are sufficiently afraid of
dying so that the prospects of death
are stressful," said Mark Kleiman,
director of the Drug Policy Analysis
Program at UCLA. "This is an un
usually good time to think about
things that could be done to give
people an easier and mindful time of
it as they are dying," Kleiman said,
referring to the baby boomer gener
ation reaching old age.
A patient participating in Grob's
study undergoes two sessions ofdrug
administration — taking a capsule of
psilocybin during one session and a
placebo in a second session.
Though Grob's study allows the
evaluation of 20 patients, only three
have been tested. Two more were
scheduled to be studied, but died be
fore the screening process was over,
Grob said.
In the Harvard study. 12 patients
will be chosen to undergo MDMA
administration in conjunction with
psychotherapy, Halpern said. The
drug may allow the patients to mobi
lize and talk about issues that would
otherwise induce a panic reaction.
The drug could induce "a sense of
empathy, a feeling of well-being and
interconnectedness; and lack of
stress will allow the participant to
deepen the effects of psychothera
py," he said.
A similar study conducted by Dr.
Francisco Moreno at the University
of Arizona tested the effects of psilo
cybin psychotherapy on patients
with obsessive compulsive disorder.

The study was completed in Decem
ber and Moreno hopes to have the
data analyzed and published shortly,
he wrote in an e-mail.
"We are encouraged by the ob
servations and hope to continue this
line of research to favor the develop
ment of new therapeutics for this dis
abling disorder," he wrote.
There was a time when psychi
atric therapy was at "the cutting
edge" of scientific research, Grob
says, but had all but vanished from
the medical community's radar for
the last 25 years.
With its roots in Shamanistic tra
ditions and dating all the way back to
antiquity, psychedelic drugs were
discovered by Western scientists in
the 1940s — centuries after Euro
pean conquerors repressed their use
due to fears of pagan influence, all
according to an article written by
Grob.
But this widespread research ex
perienced a blow in the l%os and
'70s when hallucinogen use spread
rampantly among the youth of the
time and law officials began to curb
scientific uses of the substances.
With the force of law against them,
many researchers were encouraged to
stop their work until it eventually
faded as a legitimate science.
But, with FDA approval coming
to Dr. Michael Mithoefer, a psychia
trist in South Carolina, to test the ef
fects of MDMA on patients with
post traumatic stress disorder in
2001. psychedelic research seemed
to be re-emerging. "As the sleeping
giant of hallucinogen research
emerge ... it will perceive that the
world of psychiatry has vastly
changed from when it was put to
rest," Grob wrote in 199cS.
Most psychedelic researchers
agree that with the methodology and
technology available today, hallu
cinogenic therapy has the potential
to be grounded on sounder evidence
than in the past.
"I think the time is long overdue,"
said Dr. David Nichols, president of
the Heffter Research Institute,
which sponsors Grob's study.
"Why should psychedelics have
no medical utility?" he asks. " The
question is where and how we should
use it."
Though psychedelic research has
seen a new emergence in the last
decade, Halpern says studies in psy
chedelic therapy are rare in the
country — "I can count them all in
one hand."
And there is always the skeptic
who believes that the dangers that
hallucinogens pose to society far
outweigh the potential benefits.
Overall, most in academia are not
opposed to the learning opportunity
psychedelic research provides.
"No body knows whether it is a
good or not until the research is
done," Kleiman said.
And in the face of several barri
ers, Halpern emphasizes "you better
know what you are doing."
