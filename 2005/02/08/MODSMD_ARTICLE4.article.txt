# Drama Dept. takes control of Roble Gym
## 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
The Drama Department will assume
possession of Roble Gym from the Depart
ment of Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation at the beginning of the next
academic year.
The Drama Department, which en
compasses the dance division, has always
been strapped for space. According to
Tony Kramer, the director of the dance
division, the department pitched the ini
tial idea for the transfer.
"As part of our desire to unify our depart
ment, we took this opportunity." Kramer said.
"The University realized that this was the best
use of the space."
The athletics program and the dance di
vision have shared the space for decades.
Roble Gym also currently contains the of
fices for varsity sailing and fencing and pro
vides space for both club sports and physical
education classes.
The Stanford Martial Arts Program, sum
mer youth camps and the Health Improve
ment Program also use the facilities. Right
now, the dance division uses five offices for its
staff and faculty and the large dance studio
houses all dance classes, rehearsals and nu
merous small performances.
With the new Arrillaga Family Recreation
Center slated to open across the street from
the Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center in
July, the Athletic Department will no longer
need to use space at Roble.
According to Assistant Athletic Director
Gary Migdol. the athletic groups will move to
this new facility. Burnham Pavilion and the
Arrillaga Family Sports Center.
Staff members in the Drama Depart
ment have been hoping to create a central
ized home for all drama and dance for
years. Drama Prof. Janice Ross views the
change as critical to the growth of perform
ing arts on campus.
"The Drama Department has long been
the only arts program on campus without its
own building and dedicated facility," Ross

said. "Both the dance and drama programs
are bursting at the seams and urgently in need
of increased office, rehearsal, classroom and
performance space."
In response to the growing need for space
the department created the Student Advisory'
Committee for the Promotion of the Per
forming Arts.
Chairman Ed Iskandar, Class of 2004, un
derscored the need for the performing arts
community to unite and call for greater re-

sources in order to reach its
full potential.
"We should all recog
nize how this change will
benefit the performing arts
community as a whole," he
said. "We're doing so much
excellent work already,
how excellent could we be
given the proper space to
rehearse and perform?"

Co-artistic director for the Stanford Shake
speare Society, is highly aware of the spatial
concerns. Currently, the Drama Department
only has about four rehearsal spaces avail
able. and those are reserved for department
productions, she said.
"If you're doing a show that isn't through
the Drama Department, you have to go to
Manzanita Dining or find random lounges to
rehearse in," Mason said.
Diana Movius. also Class of 2004 and a
member of the committee and former presi
dent of Cardinal Ballet, said that for the past
three years the group has had to go off campus
at least once a week to hold practice because
so many groups and choreographers were
using Roble Gym.
"With more space to practice, there will
definitely be more variation in the types of
performances that could be put on," Movius
said. "The dancers and audience alike will
have a better experience."
Those involved in the drama and dance
community are optimistic about the changes

that will take effect once the depart
ment fully controls the gym.
"Among the plans we have been
discussing are providing two offices in
Rohle designated specifically for the
student dance and drama groups and
their rehearsal equipment and an on
line scheduling system to facilitate
student groups reserving available re
hearsal space most efficiently," Ross
said.
According to Michael Ramsaur,
professor and director of production
for the Drama Department, the initial
move — which is expected to take
place in September — will entail
making offices and usable rehearsal
rooms. Plans lor the renovations to
the 73-year-old building have not
been set in stone; however, the de

partment has many hopes for the fa
cility's future.
"Drama views this move into
Rohle as the first step in a five-phase
plan to completely renovate Roble
and build additional theaters adjacent
to Roble to create a true performing
arts center," Ramsaur said.
Iskandar stressed that the per
forming arts community has out
grown its resources and is optimistic
that the Rohle complex will cater to
the varied needs of drama and dance
participants.
In addition, the committee mem
bers said they hope to form a commu
nication hub to represent students
concerns once the various performing
arts divisions unite under one roof.
"We aim to create a forum for dis
cussion, networking and understand
ing between our various communities
in order to raise the profile and the
caliber of the performing arts on our
campus," Iskandar said.
