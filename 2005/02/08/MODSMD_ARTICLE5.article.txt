# Committee aids female graduate chem students
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There's clearly a "chemical
bond" between the members of the
Stanford Chemistry Women's Com
mittee on Graduate Life, or WCGL,
a new organization working to im
prove the experience of female
chemistry graduate students and
postdoctoral scholars.
WCGL founders and chemistry
doctoral students Chrissy Brown,
Nahrain Kamber, Alice Lincoln and
Tracy Terry were motivated by the
dearth of female chemistry faculty
and lack of female mentorship op
portunities for graduate and postdoc
toral students.
The organization's members said
they believe WCGL has the potential
to represent the often unspoken con
cerns of students in the department.
"Female graduate students in the
chemistry department who might
not otherwise feel comfortable voic
ing their questions or concerns will
hopefully approach us with their
opinions and thereby find a voice
and a means to resolve their conflicts
or problems." said Jessica Chuang, a
fourth-year chemistry doctoral can
didate. "Our goal is not to highlight
any negative aspects of the current
situation of women in science nor to
find or fight perceived enemies, but
to move forward through a coopera
tive effort that includes students, fac
ulty and administration."
Many students said they are attract
ed by the sense of communitv provid
ed by WCGL.
"WCGL provides a sense of cama
raderie, a 'you're-not-in-this-alone' re
assurance in bringing together grad
students of different sub-disciplines
and different stages of advancement."
said Andrea Kurtz, a fourth-year
chemistry doctoral candidate. "1 like

the fact that members of the WCGL
are energetic, passionate and deeply
committed to improving the quality of
graduate students' lives and their ca
reer outlook."
But the impact of WCGL is not lim
ited to chemistry.
"Our 'Perspectives Evening Semi
nar Series' draws a broad audience
from many of Stanford's disciplines for
discussion of important but often over
looked issues like careers outside of
academia or industry." said Lincoln, a
third-year chemistry doctoral candi
date and a former chair of WCGL.
The organization will host anoth
er 'perspectives' panel discussion on
Feb. 22 featuring a scientific commu
nications writer, patent agent and cli
mate impacts scientist.
Lincoln said. "The energy 1 see
building in the chemistry department
is so encouraging. I would like to see it
spark a revolution in how graduate stu
dents think about themselves in rela
tion to the faculty and about their own
abilities to effect change."
Men make up about 15 percent of
the student-initiated group's active
membership. Terry attributes their
participation in part to the fact that
the WCGL discusses non-gender
specific concerns that affect all stu
dents' quality of life.
"I'm interested in promoting di
versity and equality within the de
partment. and 1 think WCGL has
made a lot of progress in that re
gard." said Noah Goldberg, a sec
ond-year doctoral candidate and
one of the male members.
The initial successes of the organi
zation include the Chemistry Depart
ment's sponsorship of the Distin
guished Women in Science, or DWIS
seminars and informal student men
toring dinners with chemistry faculty.
According to WCGL C hair C hrissy
Br< iwn.a third-year chemistry doctoral
candidate, there was initial concern
that female scientists would he insulted
to be invited as "distinguished women"
instead of'as distinguished scientists.
Brown recalled being amused that
one female professor — who others
thought might be insulted by the
name of the speaker series — said
that it was "about damn time" for
seminars like DWIS.
According to Lincoln, there has
been a "change in climate" within
the Chemistry Department as a re
sult of WCGL.
"Just two weeks after we pitched
the idea [for the faculty dinners],
the Chemistry Department enthu
siastically funded the first in a
scheduled series of five such din
ners this quarter," she said. "Such
an overwhelmingly positive re
sponse would never have happened
a year ago, and I attribute that
largely to the care we've taken in
building WCGL."
Members said they hope that the
WCGL compliments the efforts of and
collaborates with similar organizations
in other departments.
"When we began discussing form
ing a group we contacted the Me
chanical Engineering Women's
Group and others to find out what

types of issues they are addressing,
how they address them successfully
and how they work with their depart
ments," Terry said. "We have looked
more for positive examples to moti
vate and guide us than for negative
examples in departments that contin
ue to marginalize women."

Lincoln said she believes that orga
nizations similar to WCGL should be
started in other Stanford departments.
"Building a firm foundation for
such an organization takes an incredi
ble amount of work and likely won't
happen because they 'should' —
rather because a small group of moti

vated students simply decides it's time
for it to happen," she said. "I strongly
encourage grads in all departments to
take stock of their unique environ
ment and ask themselves: is my de
partment adequately diverse? I
would be surprised if many could say
yes. Now change that."
