# Committee aids female graduate chem students
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There's clearly a "chemical
bond" between the members of the
Stanford Chemistry Women's Com
mittee on Graduate Life, or WCGL,
a new organization working to im
prove the experience of female
chemistry graduate students and
postdoctoral scholars.
WCGL founders and chemistry
doctoral students Chrissy Brown,
Nahrain Kamber, Alice Lincoln and
Tracy Terry were motivated by the
dearth of female chemistry faculty
and lack of female mentorship op
portunities for graduate and postdoc
toral students.
The organization's members said
they believe WCGL has the potential
to represent the often unspoken con
cerns of students in the department.
"Female graduate students in the
chemistry department who might
not otherwise feel comfortable voic
ing their questions or concerns will
hopefully approach us with their
opinions and thereby find a voice
and a means to resolve their conflicts
or problems." said Jessica Chuang, a
fourth-year chemistry doctoral can
didate. "Our goal is not to highlight
any negative aspects of the current
situation of women in science nor to
find or fight perceived enemies, but
to move forward through a coopera
tive effort that includes students, fac
ulty and administration."
Many students said they are attract
ed by the sense of communitv provid
ed by WCGL.
"WCGL provides a sense of cama
raderie, a 'you're-not-in-this-alone' re
assurance in bringing together grad
students of different sub-disciplines
and different stages of advancement."
said Andrea Kurtz, a fourth-year
chemistry doctoral candidate. "1 like

the fact that members of the WCGL
are energetic, passionate and deeply
committed to improving the quality of
graduate students' lives and their ca
reer outlook."
But the impact of WCGL is not lim
ited to chemistry.
"Our 'Perspectives Evening Semi
nar Series' draws a broad audience
from many of Stanford's disciplines for
discussion of important but often over
looked issues like careers outside of
academia or industry." said Lincoln, a
third-year chemistry doctoral candi
date and a former chair of WCGL.
The organization will host anoth
er 'perspectives' panel discussion on
Feb. 22 featuring a scientific commu
nications writer, patent agent and cli
mate impacts scientist.
Lincoln said. "The energy 1 see
building in the chemistry department
is so encouraging. I would like to see it
spark a revolution in how graduate stu
dents think about themselves in rela
tion to the faculty and about their own
abilities to effect change."
Men make up about 15 percent of
the student-initiated group's active
membership. Terry attributes their
participation in part to the fact that
the WCGL discusses non-gender
specific concerns that affect all stu
dents' quality of life.
"I'm interested in promoting di
versity and equality within the de
partment. and 1 think WCGL has
made a lot of progress in that re
gard." said Noah Goldberg, a sec
ond-year doctoral candidate and
one of the male members.
The initial successes of the organi
zation include the Chemistry Depart
ment's sponsorship of the Distin
guished Women in Science, or DWIS
seminars and informal student men
toring dinners with chemistry faculty.
