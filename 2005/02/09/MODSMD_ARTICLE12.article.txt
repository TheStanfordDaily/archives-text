On Feb. 9, 1939, The Daily inter
viewed Stanford Junior, Hob Liv
ingston, about his ambitious plans to
navigate his five man crew in a trans
pacific race by yacht. Below is an ex
cerpt:
"From Treasure Island in San
Francisco Bay to Honolulu, 2100
miles. But Bob isn't intending to fly
there. Bob is planning something far
more interesting; planning to make
the long trip in June as a member of
the crew of a 36-foot yawl entered in
the bi-annual trans-Pacific Yacht
Race.
"The youngest of a crew of five.
Bob is making his first 'really gosh
darn big' sailing trip in the coming
Honolulu race.

"Leaving from Treasure Island
on June IS, they figure on a maxi
mum trip of 20 days. That is, if I can
find the islands,' Bob grimaced.
'One thing we expect to find of gen
uine help in navigating is the Clipper
radio beam. We can pick it up on our
radio and ride it into Honolulu.
"As the interview drew to a close.
"What are vou naming the boat.
Bob?'
" 'Lana Loa,' he said, it's Hawai
ian for smooth sailing, they say. 1
think I'll get on of those native hula
girls to tell me."
On Feb. 9,1953, The Daily cov
ered a story about four students from
the Free University of Berlin who

came to Stanford to discuss how the
World University Service, WUS,
helped them. Below is an excerpt:
"[The four students] will be
speaking on behalf of the Winter
Quarter Charity Drive, to be held
from Monday to Friday next week,
and they will stress the importance
of that part of the drive which will
raise funds for World University
Service.
"The four. Rudolf Geissler, Inge
Krauss. Rotrant Rosenfeld, and Kurt
Heilmann, will speak to as many stu
dents as possible through the living
residences and clubs. They will de
scribe the difficulties with which their
own Free University of Berlin was
founded in 1948, a year when the
Berlin blockade had all but crippled
the economy and morale of that city.
They will explain how WUS 'helped
them to help themselves.'
"And they will emphasize the
idea that World University Service
aid offers 'not just gifts to accept, but
gifts for self-help, gifts which provide
a foundation for students to expand
their educational facilities through
their own efforts and energy.
" 'We can't give money,' Geissler
will say, 'but we can give friendship,
using such means as correspondence
programs, exchange student
arrangements, and grants of scholar
ships to American students of the
Free University of Berlin."
