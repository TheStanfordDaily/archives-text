The Board of Trustees an
nounced an increase in tuition,
and the decision to improve stu
dent space on campus, according
to Chairman Burt McMurty, who
debriefed members of the media
yesterday.
The Board of Trustees decided
upon rates for the upcoming 2005-
2006 academic year, which show
an increase over this school year's
tuition, as well as housing and
board rates for undergraduates.
The undergraduate tuition rate
was changed to $31,200. which is a
4.5 percent increase from the
$29,847 that students had to pay
this year. Room rates also went
up, averaging from $5,012 to

$5,276, a change of 5.3 percent,
while standard board charges rose
3.7 percent.
Additionally, tuition for gradu
ate students rose overall with both
the Graduate School of Engineer
ing and the School of Law increas
ing by 4.5 percent. Rates for the
School of Medicine went up by
5.45 percent, while in the Gradu
ate School of Business, rates rose
by 8.8 percent for entering stu
dents and 5.8 percent for second
year students.
"Stanford is one of the few pri
vate universities with a need-blind
admission policy that accepts stu
dents regardless of their ability to
pay," the News Service reported.
"The money the University col
lects from tuition covers only 60
percent of the costs of educating

an undergraduate. Additionally,
46 percent of undergraduate stu
dents receive some form of need
based financial aid from the Uni
versity."
"The Board of Trustees would
like to make tuition lower, hut we
continually find that tuition repre
sents a source of unrestricted in
come that is of greatest demand at
the University," McMurty said.
"We are trying to keep tuition in
creases lower than they were in
the past. Moreover, our student
aid has been increasing dramati
cally over the years, increasing at
a more rapid rate than the tuition
increases."
McMurty also said that he con
sidered Stanford's financial aid
