### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Board of Trustees an
nounced an increase in tuition,
and the decision to improve stu
dent space on campus, according
to Chairman Burt McMurty, who
debriefed members of the media
yesterday.
The Board of Trustees decided
upon rates for the upcoming 2005-
2006 academic year, which show
an increase over this school year's
tuition, as well as housing and
board rates for undergraduates.
The undergraduate tuition rate
was changed to $31,200. which is a
4.5 percent increase from the
$29,847 that students had to pay
this year. Room rates also went
up, averaging from $5,012 to

$5,276, a change of 5.3 percent,
while standard board charges rose
3.7 percent.
Additionally, tuition for gradu
ate students rose overall with both
the Graduate School of Engineer
ing and the School of Law increas
ing by 4.5 percent. Rates for the
School of Medicine went up by
5.45 percent, while in the Gradu
ate School of Business, rates rose
by 8.8 percent for entering stu
dents and 5.8 percent for second
year students.
"Stanford is one of the few pri
vate universities with a need-blind
admission policy that accepts stu
dents regardless of their ability to
pay," the News Service reported.
"The money the University col
lects from tuition covers only 60
percent of the costs of educating

an undergraduate. Additionally,
46 percent of undergraduate stu
dents receive some form of need
based financial aid from the Uni
versity."
"The Board of Trustees would
like to make tuition lower, hut we
continually find that tuition repre
sents a source of unrestricted in
come that is of greatest demand at
the University," McMurty said.
"We are trying to keep tuition in
creases lower than they were in
the past. Moreover, our student
aid has been increasing dramati
cally over the years, increasing at
a more rapid rate than the tuition
increases."
McMurty also said that he con
sidered Stanford's financial aid
plan to he among one of the best in
the country.
"When we set tuition and finan
cial aid funding, we pay careful at
tention to maintaining the afford
ability of Stanford for students
from all financial backgrounds,"
he said. "Our data shows that
Stanford's financial aid program is
achieving this core goal."
McMurty acknowledged that
the Board of Trustees was con
cerned about overcrowded stu
dent residences, in comparison to
those of peer institutions. In par
ticular, the University has not
been able to accommodate all re
quests for freshman housing. The
Board of Trustees over the next
six to eight years will work to pro
vide additional space to accommo
date student housing needs.
The Board of Trustees also
plans to reclaim Old Union for
student use, McMurty said.

"We're planning to spend a
fair amount of money to renovate
Old Union and then we'll move
some of the administrative opera
tions to other places on campus,"
McMurty said. "We are seriously
trying to do what we know needs
to be done â€” providing more stu
dent space and paying attention
to student requests. When we talk
to students, a common complaint
is that there is not enough space
on campus to do activities. Re
claiming Old Union is going to be
very helpful."
The Board of Trustees heard
presentations on topics that in
cluded the accomplishments of
the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice and the status of new science
and engineering facilities. The
Board also discussed the acquisi
tion of property at Midpoint
Technology Park that will be used
as a second campus to house ad
ministrative operations and out
patient medical functions for the
School of Medicine, such as the
orthopedics department, and free
up more of the core campus for
academic use.
