# But that's not the point...
## How I learned to stop worrying and love being single 
### 
Two weeks ago. I went on a
date. This might not seem sur
prising to you unless you
know me.
1 hate the entire concept of dat
ing. You have to make awkward
conversation with someone you
don't know at all — or know very lit
tle about — and it's all based on a
shaky foundation, which is the possi
bility of making out later.
Stereotypically, Stanford stu
dents are either in long-term rela-

tionships or
they hook
up. I have
refused both
of these op
tions, at
least so far.
In fact, I
have pretty
much always
been — and
may forever
be — single.
Suppos
edly, we're

all better
when we find "our other half." I'm
just as much of a believer in this as
the next guy — which is why I'm oc
casionally (okay, often) neurotic
about my perpetually single state.
Some time ago, though. I found
something to comfort me on my sad
Saturday night alone. A writer
named Sasha Cagen invented a term
for people like me (and a Web site
— www.quirkyalone.net).
Turns out I'm a Quirkyalone —
someone who prefers to remain sin
gle, rather than settle just because it
seems like it's the thing to do. For
some people, a "dry spell" is a week
— for others, a month or a year. My
whole life is a dry spell. It is the Sa
hara desert. And 1 like it that way.
My date on Friday night was tall,
friendly and considerate. But I
would rather have gone out alone.
This isn't personal — I've turned
down quite a few guys who are all
those things you want in a date.
It's just that I'd rather stay single
until I meet someone who gets me or
who sends chills up my spine. In the
hierarchy of desirable situations,
being with someone I really like is
ideal, but being single is better than
settling.
But clearly this way of finding
your soul mate isn't so successful.
It's no wonder many of my more
pragmatic friends are skeptical
about my Quirkyaloneness. One of
my friends recently asked me, "So,
then, what are your ultimate plans
for finding someone?"
That question plays on my most
essential fears. Should I give up my
admittedly absurdly high standards?
Is dating the way to go? Or, because
no one actually goes on casual dates
at Stanford anyway, should I just
find the first guy who looks my way
and embark on a mediocre three
year relationship with him just so 1
can have someone to go to brunch
with on Sunday mornings? For now,
the answer is no.
Let me clarify, though. I'm not
opposed to coupledom. I want it.
But I'm just not willing to compro
mise my ideals for it. And in the
meantime, 1 have a solution to the
Saturday night loneliness.
Quirkyalones rely on their friends.
We go to Pub Night together and —
this is key — we leave pub night to
gether.
Occasionally we get together,
drink Boone's Farm and watch bad
TV. And we spend Valentine's Day
together.
"Quirkyalone Day" is coming up
— not surprisingly, it is on Feb. 14.
Yet despite my adamant
Quirkyalonedom, I am hesitant to
give up my Valentine's Day. At
heart, I am a hopeless romantic.
Isn't that the whole point of Valen
tine's Day? Being hopeless and ro
mantic at the same time?
I like to celebrate the downside
of V-Day while I'm waiting for the
ultimate upside. Last year to cele
brate. 1 bought myself flowers and
drank cheap red wine with my
friends. I'll probably spend this V-
Day in much the same way.
Sounds good, doesn't it? So go —
embrace your bitches (in the gangs
ta style), grab a bottle and enjoy
your singledom.

Isn't that the whole point of Valen

Two weeks ago. I went on a
date. This might not seem sur
prising to you unless you
know me.
1 hate the entire concept of dat
ing. You have to make awkward
conversation with someone you
don't know at all — or know very lit
tle about — and it's all based on a
shaky foundation, which is the possi
bility of making out later.
Stereotypically, Stanford stu
dents are either in long-term rela-

tionships or
they hook
up. I have
refused both
of these op
tions, at
least so far.
In fact, I
have pretty
much always
been — and
may forever
be — single.
Suppos
edly, we're

all better
when we find "our other half." I'm
just as much of a believer in this as
the next guy — which is why I'm oc
casionally (okay, often) neurotic
about my perpetually single state.
Some time ago, though. I found
something to comfort me on my sad
Saturday night alone. A writer
named Sasha Cagen invented a term
for people like me (and a Web site
— www.quirkyalone.net).
Turns out I'm a Quirkyalone —
someone who prefers to remain sin
gle, rather than settle just because it
seems like it's the thing to do. For
some people, a "dry spell" is a week
— for others, a month or a year. My
whole life is a dry spell. It is the Sa
hara desert. And 1 like it that way.
My date on Friday night was tall,
friendly and considerate. But I
would rather have gone out alone.
This isn't personal — I've turned
down quite a few guys who are all
those things you want in a date.
It's just that I'd rather stay single
until I meet someone who gets me or
who sends chills up my spine. In the
hierarchy of desirable situations,
being with someone I really like is
ideal, but being single is better than
settling.
But clearly this way of finding
your soul mate isn't so successful.
It's no wonder many of my more
pragmatic friends are skeptical
about my Quirkyaloneness. One of
my friends recently asked me, "So,
then, what are your ultimate plans
for finding someone?"
