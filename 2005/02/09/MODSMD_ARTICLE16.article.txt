# LIVE ON THE ROW, LEARN A LANGUAGE
## 
### NOAH WEISS STAFF WRITER 
Although the Housing Draw is
not until Spring quarter, many stu
dents are already scrambling to
find a way to get into a Row house.
Students who like Casa Ital
iana's prime location might think
getting priority is as easy as writing
that their favorite movie is "Life is
Beautiful."
Others who hear rave reviews of
La Maison Francaise's chef think
they only have to list creme brulee
as their favorite food. But not even
a love of wiener schnitzel a la hol
stein is enough to get in.
Since 1999, when Residential
Education reviewed drawing into
language theme houses, getting
priority into those residences has
become more difficult. To draw
priority level one into Haus Mit
teleuropa, students must have
done one of the following: taken
12 units of German; taught a con
versation class or mentored in
German; or traveled abroad for six
months in a German-speaking
country.
In Slavianskii Dom. the require
ments are just as strict. Students
must have fluency in a Slavic / East
European language or have 10
units from the Slavic Languages &
Literatures Department. Casa Ital
iana and La Maison Francaise have
similar prerequisites.
The language theme houses
program began in the late 19605. La
Maison Francaise opened first in
the Guthrie House. According to
the Review of Academic Theme
Houses in 1999, the "houses were
created in order to offer courses re
lated to their themes and to orga
nize social, cultural and recreation
al programs."
Jane Camarillo, director of resi

dential education, further ex
plained why the houses were
formed.
"The language houses were
started by students and faculty who
thought that a language house
would allow students to better ac
quire a language prior to study
abroad and would allow them to
continue the language upon their
return from abroad," she said.
As the houses developed, the
focus shifted from language im
mersion to "more cultural pro
gramming and later, more social
programming." Camarillo said.
To create enough programming
to have a culturally immersive
house, an army of staff members is
needed. Each house has a resident
fellow, faculty advisor, resident as
sistant, house manager and up to
five theme associates.
At each of the language theme
houses, staff members offer classes
that are required for residents to
take but are also open to the gener
al community.
Haus Mitteleuropa has offered
courses such as "European
Lifestyles," "New Horizons in Ger
man Science and Technology" and
"Great German and Austrian
Composers." Slavianskii Dom has
classes like "European Union
Eastward Enlargement" and"Beer
History and Culture in Central and
Eastern Europe." La Maison Fran
caise offers the popular viticulture
class.
In addition to the classes that
house members are required to
take, completion of a theme project
is required. In the fall, two resi
dents from Haus Mitteleuropa
made homemade pretzels for the
house's Oktoberfest that "ended
up tasting and looking remarkably
similar to the kind you get in
Bavaria," said House Manager

Alexandra Pocek, a senior.
The language, class and theme
projects requirements are integral
to the cultural learning process, but
they're also necessary to stay in the
house.
"If students do not fulfill their
special priority agreement. Resi
dential Education can re-assign the
student," Camarillo said.
Each house has its own unique
approach to programming.
"Every Monday night we hold
La Table Francaise as time for res
idents and French-speaking stu
dents from around campus to prac
tice their French," said Theme As
sociate Tiffany Early, a senior.
Haus Mitteleuropa has held
panels such as one commemorat
ing the 15th anniversary of the
Berlin Wall. La Casa ltaliana has
an annual house play during the
winter. This year house members
performed Goldoni's Ca' Nova
under the direction of visiting pro
fessors Elena Coda and Alessan
dro Tuzzato.
House staffs and residents also
organize trips to promote cultural
learning. Last year. La Casa ltal
iana went to the Museo Italo-
Americano and the International
Film Festival, while Slavianskii
Dom went to Cafe Prague, a brew
ery in San Francisco, and to the
Chagall exhibit at the Museum of
Modern Art in San Francisco.
The staff members all had very
positive reviews of the language
theme houses. They all agreed that
students had a wide range of learn
ing experiences.
"It's really as much as any one
person makes of it," Pocek said.
"Some residents go to many events
and actively speak German, while
others aren't as involved."
"1 feel like I have a better un
derstanding now of what life is and

was like in that part of the world,"
said Slavianskii Dom House Man
ager Matt Trainer, a junior. "It's in
teresting to become involved in an
other's culture's stories this way."
Even students who draw into
the house without priority partici
pate in the cultural offerings.
"One girl last year had no expo
sure to anything Slavic and ended
up learning enough of the language
in classes and at the Russian table
that she decided to do the Moscow
abroad program," Trainer said.
The resident staffs said they
make it a point to create an envi
ronment where both experienced
students who draw in priority and
students with no background who
draw with a high number can bene
fit from house activities.
"All our events, excluding high
er level conversation classes, pre
sume no prior knowledge or skills,"

said senior Raphael Ginsburg, a
program manager at Haus Mit
teleuropa. "They also tend to be in
troductory, and thus easily inte
grate those without extensive back
ground."
Since students can draw into the
houses without any previous expe
rience in the language, residents
usually speak in English to accom
modate those not fluent in the
house's language. Camarillo said
she acknowledges the difficulty of
integrating priority and non-priori
ty students.
"The area in which the lan
guage houses are weaker is in im
mersion in the language," Camaril
lo said. "Because the Draw and
priorities still determine who is
housed in the language and culture
houses, we cannot guarantee that
students are only speaking the lan
guage all the time."

sure to anything Slavic and ended
up learning enough of the language
in classes and at the Russian table
that she decided to do the Moscow
abroad program," Trainer said.
The resident staffs said they
make it a point to create an envi
ronment where both experienced
students who draw in priority and
students with no background who
draw with a high number can bene
fit from house activities.
"All our events, excluding high
er level conversation classes, pre
sume no prior knowledge or skills,"

said senior Raphael Ginsburg, a
program manager at Haus Mit
teleuropa. "They also tend to be in
troductory, and thus easily inte
grate those without extensive back
ground."
Since students can draw into the
houses without any previous expe
rience in the language, residents
usually speak in English to accom
modate those not fluent in the
house's language. Camarillo said
she acknowledges the difficulty of
integrating priority and non-priori
ty students.
"The area in which the lan
guage houses are weaker is in im
mersion in the language," Camaril
lo said. "Because the Draw and
priorities still determine who is
housed in the language and culture
houses, we cannot guarantee that
students are only speaking the lan
guage all the time."

Students living in Haus Mitteleuropa, the Central Europe theme house, are
required to participate in cultural programming, which includes attending
weekly theme classes
Although the Housing Draw is
not until Spring quarter, many stu
dents are already scrambling to
find a way to get into a Row house.
Students who like Casa Ital
iana's prime location might think
getting priority is as easy as writing
that their favorite movie is "Life is
Beautiful."
Others who hear rave reviews of
La Maison Francaise's chef think
they only have to list creme brulee
as their favorite food. But not even
a love of wiener schnitzel a la hol
stein is enough to get in.
Since 1999, when Residential
Education reviewed drawing into
language theme houses, getting
priority into those residences has
become more difficult. To draw
priority level one into Haus Mit
teleuropa, students must have
done one of the following: taken
12 units of German; taught a con
versation class or mentored in
German; or traveled abroad for six
months in a German-speaking
country.
In Slavianskii Dom. the require
ments are just as strict. Students
must have fluency in a Slavic / East
European language or have 10
units from the Slavic Languages &
Literatures Department. Casa Ital
iana and La Maison Francaise have
similar prerequisites.
The language theme houses
program began in the late 19605. La
Maison Francaise opened first in
the Guthrie House. According to
the Review of Academic Theme
Houses in 1999, the "houses were
created in order to offer courses re
lated to their themes and to orga
nize social, cultural and recreation
al programs."
Jane Camarillo, director of resi

dential education, further ex
plained why the houses were
formed.
"The language houses were
started by students and faculty who
thought that a language house
would allow students to better ac
quire a language prior to study
abroad and would allow them to
continue the language upon their
return from abroad," she said.
As the houses developed, the
focus shifted from language im
mersion to "more cultural pro
gramming and later, more social
programming." Camarillo said.
To create enough programming
to have a culturally immersive
house, an army of staff members is
needed. Each house has a resident
fellow, faculty advisor, resident as
sistant, house manager and up to
five theme associates.
At each of the language theme
houses, staff members offer classes
that are required for residents to
take but are also open to the gener
al community.
Haus Mitteleuropa has offered
courses such as "European
Lifestyles," "New Horizons in Ger
man Science and Technology" and
"Great German and Austrian
Composers." Slavianskii Dom has
classes like "European Union
Eastward Enlargement" and"Beer
History and Culture in Central and
Eastern Europe." La Maison Fran
caise offers the popular viticulture
class.
In addition to the classes that
house members are required to
take, completion of a theme project
is required. In the fall, two resi
dents from Haus Mitteleuropa
made homemade pretzels for the
house's Oktoberfest that "ended
up tasting and looking remarkably
similar to the kind you get in
Bavaria," said House Manager

Alexandra Pocek, a senior.
The language, class and theme
projects requirements are integral
to the cultural learning process, but
they're also necessary to stay in the
house.
"If students do not fulfill their
special priority agreement. Resi
dential Education can re-assign the
student," Camarillo said.
Each house has its own unique
approach to programming.
"Every Monday night we hold
La Table Francaise as time for res
idents and French-speaking stu
dents from around campus to prac
tice their French," said Theme As
sociate Tiffany Early, a senior.
Haus Mitteleuropa has held
panels such as one commemorat
ing the 15th anniversary of the
Berlin Wall. La Casa ltaliana has
an annual house play during the
winter. This year house members
performed Goldoni's Ca' Nova
under the direction of visiting pro
fessors Elena Coda and Alessan
dro Tuzzato.
House staffs and residents also
organize trips to promote cultural
learning. Last year. La Casa ltal
iana went to the Museo Italo-
Americano and the International
Film Festival, while Slavianskii
Dom went to Cafe Prague, a brew
ery in San Francisco, and to the
Chagall exhibit at the Museum of
Modern Art in San Francisco.
The staff members all had very
positive reviews of the language
theme houses. They all agreed that
students had a wide range of learn
ing experiences.
"It's really as much as any one
person makes of it," Pocek said.
"Some residents go to many events
and actively speak German, while
others aren't as involved."
"1 feel like I have a better un
derstanding now of what life is and

was like in that part of the world,"
said Slavianskii Dom House Man
ager Matt Trainer, a junior. "It's in
teresting to become involved in an
other's culture's stories this way."
Even students who draw into
the house without priority partici
pate in the cultural offerings.
