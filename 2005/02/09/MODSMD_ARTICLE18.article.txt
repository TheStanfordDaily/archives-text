## Editorial Housing changes need student input 
### 
On Monday, Vice Provost John Bravman an
nounced his proposal for far-reaching changes to un
dergraduate housing. While the plan will benefit
much of the Stanford community, we have serious
reservations regarding level of student representation
and the proposed relocation of Ujamaa to Florence
Moore Hall, or Flo Mo.
The proposal presents three major changes to un
dergraduate housing, including increasing the number
of all frosh houses, creating a year of housing where a
student is likely to have a single or a two-room double
and enhancing "academic support structures."
These changes will effectively end the Stanford hous
ing crunch, which has been an imposition on students for
too long, and Roble quads, Branner triples and Mir
rielees triples will become doubles.
Furthermore, the construction of singles and two
room doubles will improve Stanford's competitive
ness in attracting potential students. At Harvard, for
example, seniors rarely even consider the possibility
of living in a cramped one-room double; all seniors
have the option of a single.
Even though the proposal stands to benefit much of
the campus, the proposed changes to Ujamaa are un
acceptable.
The dorm has been a place that many members of the
Stanford community call home. Unfortunately, the small
size of the current Black Community Services Center, or
BCSC, prevents it from holding large meetings or hosting
speakers. The Ujamaa common room includes a stage,
and it allows the dorm to host events a typical common
room could not accommodate; during its history, the
dorm has housed protests against Apartheid and discus
sions with famous speakers. Moving Ujamaa to FloMo
without substantial changes to the RoMo dorms will pre
clude such a meeting and performance space.
Regardless of Ujamaa's relocation, a committee —

with representation from Ujamaa residents and BCSC
staff — should he formed to look into the issue.
In a similar vein, student representation in finalizing
the details of the proposal must receive increased im
portance. In his announcement. Bravman stressed that
the proposal was nothing more than a place to start a
discussion. Proposals with changes as far-reaching as
this one must be given to community members with
time to allow them to digest the information and for
those with passionate reactions to rationally approach
the issue.
Bravman's statement indicates that the University
administration understands this. Nonetheless, given
the breadth of the proposed changes, there must be a
firm commitment to student representation in all talks.
Prior to Monday night, students had not been formally
included in devising the proposal. In meeting with Uja
maa residents and staff members, as well as The Daily
and the ASSU, Bravman is taking the right steps to
ward making the project more inclusive.
But this is not enough. Housing is an issue that im
pacts students' daily lives and affects their decisions to at
tend Stanford. For such an important set of changes, stu
dents must be included in all levels of the decision mak
ing. Bravman should begin devising committees to delve
into the specifics. Moreover, a timeline should be estab
lished to put students, faculty members and administra
tors on these committees. While it is too late into the aca
demic year for committees to begin meeting, they can be
selected so that meetings can start in October.
Bravman's proposal has many interesting ideas that
could potentially allow Stanford students to flourish.
Community members ought to approach it with an open
and optimistic mind. Hopefully, Bravman will soon
come forth with plans to include students in this discus
sion and an appropriate timeline to demonstrate his
commitment to representation.

ward making the project more inclusive.
But this is not enough. Housing is an issue that im
pacts students' daily lives and affects their decisions to at
tend Stanford. For such an important set of changes, stu
dents must be included in all levels of the decision mak
ing. Bravman should begin devising committees to delve
into the specifics. Moreover, a timeline should be estab
lished to put students, faculty members and administra
tors on these committees. While it is too late into the aca
demic year for committees to begin meeting, they can be
selected so that meetings can start in October.
Bravman's proposal has many interesting ideas that
could potentially allow Stanford students to flourish.
Community members ought to approach it with an open
and optimistic mind. Hopefully, Bravman will soon
come forth with plans to include students in this discus
sion and an appropriate timeline to demonstrate his
commitment to representation.
