"Take your ideas out of the filing
cabinet," read a PowerPoint slide dur
ing Kai Stinchcombe's opening presen
tation at the Roosevelt Institution's in
augural event at Tresidder's Oak
Lounge last night.
About 4<K) students and Stanford
community members attended the
event, titled "A Rendezvous with Des
tiny," which marked the launch of the
Institution, the nation's first student
run think tank.
Stinchcombe, the Roosevelt Insti
tution's president and a graduate stu
dent in political science, said the orga
nization's mission is to tap "underuti
lized intellectual capital."
"We have a lot to offer our country
as Stanford students," he said. "We
write theses, collaborate on faculty
projects, form student groups and re
search issues we care about, but when
we just turn a paper in to a professor
and forget about it. we waste a tremen
dous amount of intellectual capital."
Executive Director Quinn Wilhelmi,
a sophomore, explained the Institution's
goals to the standing room-only crowd.
"By establishing Roosevelt, we are
preparing young leaders for the real
world and re-politicizing a generation
that has been turned off to the political
process," he said. "This is as much
about process as it is about product."
Student fellows from five of Roo
sevelt's 12 issue-focused centers pre
sented policy briefs from their respec

tive centers. Topics included improv
ing domestic environmental policy, the
rising AIDS epidemic among married
women in South Africa and reforming
elementary school education for
Liberian refugees in San Francisco.
Freshman Margot Isman, a Roo
sevelt Institution fellow, announced
that a number of other universities
have chapters of the organization in
the works, including Columbia and
Cornell. A chapter is already at Yale;
its officers made a video that was pre
sented at the event.
Following the program, attendants
were encouraged to network with
Roosevelt Institution fellows and offi
cers while a jazz band played.
Sophomore Jackie Bernstein said
she was impressed by the event.
"It was very professional and very
effective," she said. "I was really sur
prised by the turn-out â€” I thought it
would be 12 kids in a darkroom, but it
was so crowded I could barely squeeze
my way in the door."
A similar outreach event will proba
bly take place by the end of the quarter,
and Roosevelt Institution officers said
they were encouraged by the reception.
"Over 2(H) students signed up to
learn more about Roosevelt [Institu
tion] and to potentially take part in its
future," said Public Relations Director
Vilas Rao, a sophomore.
"Looking at how well the event
went, it's clear that our team is compe
tent and dedicated enough to take over
a country; let's make it our own,"
Stinchcombe said.
