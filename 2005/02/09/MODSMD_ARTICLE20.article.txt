# Techie Repairs the World
## My unfathomable alien intellect 
### 
It takes a certain amount of insanity fora man to stand
up and say that he has the answers. Such men are rarely
the ones most competent to lead. Morality, prudence and
justice are usually not counted amongst their virtues, and
they suffer too often from megalomania, dishonesty,

hypocrisy, greed and poor personal
hygiene.
I possess none of these virtues
and am guilty of all of those vices.
Yet I still have this to say: I have the
answers.
Science and its daughter. Technol
ogy, have been the answer to every
problem of note. Before proper agri
culture, hunger was the rule. Before
the printing press, tyranny was unfet
tered. Before penicillin, disease had

nearly free reign. Before alcohol, there were no week
ends. And Science's greatest contribution to the world
was not mere devices, but the scientific mindset. The idea
that the world can be measured, understood and fixed by
the magic of progress.
For an example, look at hunger. For years people
looked at China and India in horror. These benighted
people kept breeding. Overpopulation would choke
the world and most of its people would be doomed to
a lifetime of starvation. Their solutions were drastic
and ineffective. Governments forcibly limited child
birth through draconian measures, including arbitrary
sterilization. Others advocated, and still advocate, a
drastic redistribution of resources because there was
only enough in the world for everyone to have the bare
minimum.
But elsewhere in the world an lowan named Norman
Borlaug was working with Mexican officials to develop
the hybrid seeds that would usher in the Green Revolu
tion. With his seeds, crop yields would increase manyfold

all over the developed world. India and China became
self sufficient in terms of food production. By some esti
mates, over a billion lives were saved. Birthrates fell and
are falling, partly as a response to new prosperity. Yet
today many critics still protest the genetically engineered
crops that could take the* Green Revolution to the next
level.
Too many social critics see only four types of people
in the world. The cynical rich who oppose all progressive
measures; a large mass of self-satisfied apathetic drones;
a tremendous horde of the needy and disenfranchised;
and a few enlightened souls willing to do what needs to
be done. These critics believe that if they can stir up the
apathetic, then they'll have the power to unseat the cyn
ical rich and help the horde.
While this may be true for some problems, it is rarely
a sound model of the world. Even the cynical rich want
to help others, but the proposed means of helping usu
ally involves l a great personal cost and low chance of
success.
And so there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth
over starvation, sounding an "alert" to an "uncaring"
world. The problem was approached in the most obvious
fashion. But the most obvious way to transport some
thing from place to place is by picking it up. It takes sci
ence to find the easiest way.
That's what this column is about. It's about turning
the awesome power of the intellect (more specifically,
my intellect) on all the world's problems. When you want
something fixed, you go to a mechanic, a doctor or an en
gineer, not a political scientist. Get out of the way fuzzies,
a techie has come to save the day!

As a freshman, Rahul Kanakia's only qualification to write
a public affairs column is his unfathomable alien intellect.
