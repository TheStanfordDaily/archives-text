## Really real reality TV 
### 
I hate reality television. Why do
1 want to watch a bunch of less
than-attractive, less-than-intelli
gent, less-than-funny and, increas
ingly, less-than-twentysomething
people fight about whose turn it is
to go and buy the cheese wiz? There
are better uses of my time. There
are better uses of yours, too.
But there is one channel that
shows reality television every hour
of every day that 1 will watch, and so

j j
should you.
C-SPAN.
No, really. C
SPAN.
Actually
there are three
C-SPAN chan
nels. There's a
radio station
too, but I think
Stanford only
gets the first two

television channels. (And 1 pay how
much per month for cable?) When
Congress is in session, one can gen
erally see gavel-to-gavel coverage
of the House on C-SPAN one and
the Senate on C-SPAN two. I watch
the Senate.
And you should too; it has the
bigger stars.
How lucky are we. We live in one
of the most revered democracies in
the world and anybody with a tele
vision set gets to watch the political
process at the highest level. (How
ever, watch C-SPAN on Sundays
when it shows the British House of
Commons, and you'll want to move
over there in a second.)
It's not dorky. Really. It's excit
ing and dramatic and invigorating.
Just the other day, 1 stayed up
into the wee hours of the morning
watching a Senate Judiciary hearing
at which they voted on President
George W. Bush's nominee for at
torney general, Alberto Gonzalez.
The statements were impas
sioned. The press was out in full
force, and the hearing room gallery
was packed.
And then the clerk called the
roll.
The clerk read the names down
the line, from right to left. Every
Republican voted "Aye." Every
Democrat voted "No." Gonzalez
"made it out of committee" on a 10-
8 party line vote.
How could you not be watch
ing this?!? What could be more
exciting?
C-SPAN is like ESPN (another

reality channel I watch more than 1
should) for the politically con
scious. The arenas are the halls of
our government. The fans are the
reporters and those in the gal
leries. The games consist of ques
tions and answers, speeches and
debates.
And the best part: it's all com
mercial-free.
Why do more people watch
sports than politics? Who's on the
front page of the newspaper? It's
Indiana Senator and Chairman of
the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions Richard Lugar more often
than it's NBA star Kevin Garnett.
Condi gets more front-page action
than Michael Vick and Sammy Sosa
combined.
So why not watch the real thing?
Why wait to read what happened in
the next day's paper?
We have hit upon C-SPAN's one
Haw: the lack of a highlight reel.
When Allen Iverson goes off for
50 points, we hear about it. First we
see it on that little line on the bot
tom of the screen that gives us all
the important stats and then we see
the highlights later on.
Where's the political equiva
lent? More often than not, the
evening news shows clips from
press conferences and staged
events, so that doesn't count.
The way to get people to watch
the process itself is to create a
Sports Center equivalent for poli
tics (don't steal my idea). We need
witty anchors (I'll see if Aaron
Levine is still available) to set up
today's biggest political stars as
they swing for the fences â€” well,
there's no swinging allowed on the
floor of the Senate, but you get the
point.
This will inspire young children
to want to "be like Mike." Mike
DeWine, that is, the Republican
Senator from Ohio who was instru
mental in getting the CIA to release
... well, you've probably stopped
reading by now anyway.
It's my dream, that one day it will
be socially acceptable to call up a
friend and ask him (or her) if he (or
she) wants to come over, have a
beer and watch the FDA hearing.
Until then ...
