## Recognizing human rights and dignity: another perspective on Darfur 
### ERIC KRAMON LIJA McHUGH 
Since early 2(X)3, in the Darfur region of
Sudan, an estimated 215,(XK) civilians have
been killed and up to two million civilians have
been displaced by systematic violence in the re
gion. In addition, up to 200,000 people have
died from malnutrition and disease, placing the
two-year death toll at around 415,000.
Given the documented evidence of policies
of genocide that are being systematically im
plemented in Darfur, we, as editors at Six De
grees: A Stanford Journal of Human Rights,
feel the need to respond to "The Crisis in Dar
fur" event, which featured Sudanese Ambas
sador to the United States Khidir Haroun
Ahmed and members of the Sudanese govern
ment-sponsored "Give Peace A Chance"
coalition.
The event, which organizers advertised as
an opportunity to learn "how the international
community can help to alleviate the suffering
of the people of Darfur," showed a shocking

lack of urgency regarding the humanitarian cri
sis and was, at best, the presentation of an un
founded, highly one-sided approach to the
issue and, at worst, the recitation of rhetoric
produced by the Sudanese central govern
ment's propaganda machine.
Ahmed's narrative conflicted with that of
numerous well-respected international orga
nizations, NGOs and governments, includ
ing Human Rights Watch and Amnesty In
ternational. These groups have documented
evidence that the Sudanese government, led
by Omar Al-Bashir, is directly responsible
for the atrocities being committed in the
Darfur region.
In 2003, two rebel groups, the Sudanese
Liberation Army and the Justice and Equal
ity Movement began their uprisings in an ef
fort to end the political and economic
marginalization of Darfur. Bashir responded
with tactics described by Human Rights
Watch as a "scorched earth campaign against
civilians belonging to the same ethnicity as

members of [the] two rebel movements."
The government's multi-faceted response
has included methodical and indiscriminate
aerial bombardment of Darfur, along with
the arming and deployment of militia groups
recruited from nomadic tribes in the region.
These militia groups, generally referred to as
Janjaweed, have been given free rein in the
region to implement their policies, which in
clude the systematic rape of women, destruc
tion of entire villages and enslavement of
those whose lives they spare.
It should come as no surprise to anyone
who has followed Sudan's history of deadly
conflicts that the Al-Bashir government em
ploys tactics that primarily target civilians.
The Sudanese government used similar tac
tics during its two-decade long conflict with
the southern-based Sudanese People's Lib
eration Army, or SPLA.
This conflict, one of the longest and dead
liest in Africa's history, killed up to two mil
lion civilians and displaced another four mil

lion into refugee camps in neighboring coun
tries or internal displacement camps
throughout Sudan.
The recent peace agreement ending the
civil war between the SPLA and the central
government is a sign that, perhaps, Sudan is
beginning on a path towards peace. But as
long as mass violence continues in Darfur,
and militias and rebels continue to commit
grave abuses of human rights with impunity,
Sudan's prospects for peace remain small. It
is crucial that all actors — Sudanese and in
ternational — coordinate to stop the vio
lence and develop a plan that will give digni
ty back to the people of Sudan.
Whether the violence in Darfur consti
tutes genocide, crimes against humanity or a
"conflict between nomadic tribesmen and
farmers" (as described by the ambassador),
the scale of the violence and the clearly sys
tematic nature of the atrocities committed
demand action, a sense of urgency and, at the
very least, recognition of the tragedy result

ing from the violations of human life and dig
nity that continue. These sentiments were
noticeably missing from the event on Tues
day evening, an omission that is perhaps, for
many of us, even more saddening than the
presentation of distorted facts.
On Feb. 21, Six Degrees encourages ev
eryone in the Stanford community to get a
different perspective on Darfur by attend
ing the screening of "The New Killing
Fields," a documentary by Philip Cox of Na
tive Voice Films. Cox, one of the first to
smuggle himself into Sudan to get a first
hand look at the Darfur crisis, will give a
talk following the screening and will partic
ipate in a colloquium with other key speak
ers the following day.
