## Right in the Babymaker Super Bowl ads don't live up to hype 
### 
It makes me unreasonably angry when peo
ple are entertained by stupid things. So it
should probably go without saying that
Super Bowl Sunday is typically not one of my
good days. With the exception of the actual
football — which takes up maybe 30 percent of
the day's viewing experience — watching the
game is akin to pulling out my corneas with
tweezers.
The commercials, as any sports-deficient

material whore will tell you,
are the best part of the game.
However, I honestly can't
remember a year of Super
Bowl commercials as unfun
ny as this one, particularly
when you take into account
the fact that the best ad. de
picting the cause of Janet
Jackson's "wardrobe mal
function" during last year's
game, was cut by Budweiser

before the game because it was "offensive." Of
course, this made the fact that everyone was
laughing at the ads that did make it onto the air
even more unappealing.
Still, it's nice to see Christopher Reeve get
ting work as the frozen corpse in Ford's Mus
tang convertible ad. The similarity there was
just too great; I'm convinced some ad exec just
stole Superman's body from the cryogenic facil
ity (the Fortress of Solitude?) it was being
stored in and placed it in the driver's seat.
On an unrelated note, monkeys are funny.
Very little else needs to be said about this. 1 en
dorse any monkey-based humor. I think the
only Super Bowl commercial that 1 distinctively
remember from past years was 20 seconds of a
chimpanzee dancing on an orange crate in a
driveway, and I'm pretty sure it was for
E*Trade. That's effective advertising.
The best ad by far, though, was Fox's spot for
24("He'sJack Bauer! He's already foiled two ter
rorist plots to blow up America, but his supervi
sors don't trust him because he's a loose can
non!") that told viewers it cost $2.4 million. The
only way it could have been better would have
been if Fox had lit an enormous pile of cash on fire
in front of Kiefer Sutherland's smoldering mug.
I can't compliment Fox, though, since
they're responsible for Paris Hilton's "fame"
and for forcing me to tolerate 20 seconds of her
misshapen face on TV. One column is not
enough to describe my seething rage for her.
The less I see of Carson Daly, the better.
"Talentless hack" does not begin to describe
him, and you know you're scraping the bottom
of the barrel when you're making commercials
exploiting your image as a toadving tool eager
to lick P. biddy's butt.
What? Oh, right, the game. You have to
hand it to Terrell Owens, who came up big and
didn't appear to be hampered at all by his ankle.
You also have to haVid it to Freddie Mitchell. It
must have been hard finding a place to disap
pear to when hundreds of millions of people are
watching, hut he managed somehow.
But the Eagles, regardless of their efforts,
are left to ponder their inexplicable fourth
quarter clock management that gave them only
46 seconds to work with on what could have
been a game-tying drive. Head coach Andy
Reid, when asked about the gaffe, said only, "It
was the way things worked out." Somehow, I
don't think that will placate Eagles fans.
The one guy you have to be really happy for,
though, is Patriots running back Corey Dillon.
After spending seven years with Cincinnati, the
Devil's Island of professional sports franchises,
Dillon finally got his championship ring. He
signed with the Pats for less money than he
would have gotten from the Bengals, a team
about which he said, "I'd rather Hip burgers
than play in Cincinnati." Keep that Bengals
pride strong. Cincinnatians! You'rejust lOor 12
more rebuilding years away from a first-round
playoff loss!
Watching the game itself must have made
football purists everywhere get a little misty.

The Patriots went down early, didn't
panic and ground out another victo
ry with all the panache and flair of
Bea Arthur. This is the most boring
dynasty team ever. I keep waiting
for the big scandal to break — Tom
Brady misses practice because he
forgot to feed Mike Vrabel's ham
ster while he was on vacation.
So are the Patriots the best team
ever? Sure, why not. They're defi
nitely the best team we've seen in
the past decade, and as much as I
love the 49ers of the 1980s, they
never put together three of four. I
think the long-term success of the
Niners into the 19905, though, is the
defining streak, in which they won
10 or more games for 16 consecu
tive seasons and won almost as
many division titles. So there's
some work to be done, but over a
shorter time frame the Pats proba
bly have it.
So it appears justice has been
served. The only thing I'm angry
about now is that the Super Bowl
marks the beginning of the month
long span before March Madness
when only the NBA is left to enter
tain me. If you need me, I'll be play
ing NFL Blitz. As the 49ers.
