# Golf swings into season
## Men's team will kick offspring season against some of nation's top teams in Hawaii this week. 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While students on the Stanford campus endure
the rainy season of winter quarter, the men's golf
team kicks off its spring season in paradise today at
the Taylor Made Waikoloa Intercollegiate. Hosted
by the University of Hawaii-Hilo, the 54-hole
event will run through Friday.
Despite its island location, the Taylor Made has
been anything but a day at the beach for Stanford
teams in recent years. In its past three trips across
the Pacific, the Cardinal have failed to finish high
er than 11th as a team.
"I think it's a matter of dealing with wind and
Bermuda grass," head coach Conrad Ray said.
"We don't see either one very much back in Cali
fornia. We're working on getting ready for those
things this week."
The par-72 6,687-yard Waikoloa Kings Course
will challenge some of the best collegiate golfers
from across the country. Set amid volcanic rock
and garnished with palm trees, the Kings Course
can be either a generous host, surrendering a mul
titude of birdies, or a brutal test of endurance, de
pending on weather conditions.
Playing golf in Hawaii, the question is usually not
whether the wind will blow, but rather in which di
rection. The answer to the second question will de
termine whether players can attack the layout with
the aid of a tailwind or if they will fight headwinds
that lengthen the course beyond its listed yardage.
"It's been very calm so far this week, knock on
wood," Ray said. "But things can change really
quickly around here."
Highlighting the competition will be No. 3 Ok
lahoma State (Golfweek/Sagarin) and No. 8 Texas,
as well as Pacific-10 Conference rivals No. 9
UCLA, No. 11 USC, No. 15 Arizona State, Ore

gon, and Washington.
Defending champion No. 2 Georgia Tech, how
ever, will not be participating in this year's event.
Despite the recent struggles in Hawaii, the Car
dinal are happy with its off-season efforts and opti
mistic about its chances to contend this week.
"I think the guys have had a good off-season of
training," freshman Rob Grube said. "They're ex
cited to go out and show we're a better team than
our ranking shows."
Ray takes a lineup of Grube, sophomore Zack
Miller, junior Kyle Gentry and seniors Pat Phillips
and Kevin Blue.
The Cardinal begin the spring ranked 51st in the
nation and in reasonable position to make a run at
their first NCAA appearance since 19%. A strong
performance against the Taylor Made's elite field
will be a step in the right direction.
"It's a good opportunity for us," Ray said. "We've
got a team that has a lot of potential, and 1 think those
people close to the team know what we can do."
Briefly: The Stanford women's golf team shot a
307 on the second day of competition at the
Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge in Palos
Verdes, Calif. The Cardinal are in 13th place over
all heading into tomorrow's final round, with a
two-round total score of 622.
Pepperdine is atop the leaderboard with a two
day total of 592. UCLA and Duke are both one
stroke back.
Individually, sophomore Jennifer Tangtiphai
boontana shot a 77 yesterday and is tied for 30th
with a 153. Junior Kelly Husted is in 46th placed
after carding a 78 to bring her two-day total to 155.
Senior Wendra Liang is tied for 50th with a 156,
while sophomore Lauren Todd (158) and sopho
more Jenna Seki (167) are in 57th and 77th, respec
tively. Todd followed her opening-round 83 with a
team-best 75 yesterday.
Duke's Brittany Lang leads the field with a two
under par 144, while UCLA's Charlotte Mayorkas
and Eilieen Vargas are tied for second with a three
over par 145.
Final round play begins at 9 a.m. at the Palos
Verdes Golf Club.

that lengthen the course beyond its listed yardage.
"It's been very calm so far this week, knock on
wood," Ray said. "But things can change really
quickly around here."
Highlighting the competition will be No. 3 Ok
lahoma State (Golfweek/Sagarin) and No. 8 Texas,
as well as Pacific-10 Conference rivals No. 9
UCLA, No. 11 USC, No. 15 Arizona State, Ore

gon, and Washington.
Defending champion No. 2 Georgia Tech, how
ever, will not be participating in this year's event.
Despite the recent struggles in Hawaii, the Car
dinal are happy with its off-season efforts and opti
mistic about its chances to contend this week.
"I think the guys have had a good off-season of
training," freshman Rob Grube said. "They're ex
cited to go out and show we're a better team than
our ranking shows."
Ray takes a lineup of Grube, sophomore Zack
Miller, junior Kyle Gentry and seniors Pat Phillips
and Kevin Blue.
The Cardinal begin the spring ranked 51st in the
nation and in reasonable position to make a run at
their first NCAA appearance since 19%. A strong
performance against the Taylor Made's elite field
will be a step in the right direction.
"It's a good opportunity for us," Ray said. "We've
got a team that has a lot of potential, and 1 think those
people close to the team know what we can do."
Briefly: The Stanford women's golf team shot a
307 on the second day of competition at the

Sophomore Zack Miller and the men's golf team will begin its spring season
in sunny Hawaii at a tournament it has struggled at in recent years.
While students on the Stanford campus endure
the rainy season of winter quarter, the men's golf
team kicks off its spring season in paradise today at
the Taylor Made Waikoloa Intercollegiate. Hosted
by the University of Hawaii-Hilo, the 54-hole
event will run through Friday.
Despite its island location, the Taylor Made has
been anything but a day at the beach for Stanford
teams in recent years. In its past three trips across
the Pacific, the Cardinal have failed to finish high
er than 11th as a team.
"I think it's a matter of dealing with wind and
Bermuda grass," head coach Conrad Ray said.
"We don't see either one very much back in Cali
fornia. We're working on getting ready for those
things this week."
The par-72 6,687-yard Waikoloa Kings Course
will challenge some of the best collegiate golfers
from across the country. Set amid volcanic rock
and garnished with palm trees, the Kings Course
can be either a generous host, surrendering a mul
titude of birdies, or a brutal test of endurance, de
pending on weather conditions.
Playing golf in Hawaii, the question is usually not
whether the wind will blow, but rather in which di
rection. The answer to the second question will de
termine whether players can attack the layout with
the aid of a tailwind or if they will fight headwinds
that lengthen the course beyond its listed yardage.
"It's been very calm so far this week, knock on
wood," Ray said. "But things can change really
quickly around here."
Highlighting the competition will be No. 3 Ok
lahoma State (Golfweek/Sagarin) and No. 8 Texas,
