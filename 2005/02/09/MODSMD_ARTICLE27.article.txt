# Women's lacrosse starts fresh
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON 
As any athlete or sports fan has experienced first-hand,
the start of a new season brings a sense of optimism and end
less possibility. With no results available to dampen the
mood, players and die-hard fans alike are free to dream that
this is the year the team finally clicks, crushes their rivals and
wins a championship. Such is the feeling on this year's
women's lacrosse team.
"We want to make a strong impact in the league and re
gain our conference title," junior captain Megan Burker
said. "We're definitely excited and hopeful to make it to the
next step this year."
The women will working start toward that goal this Satur
day at Oregon.
"Oregon presents the challenge of a very quick, feisty
team that will be running on a lot of adrenaline," head coach
Michelle Uhlfelder said. "Our challenge is to control the
pace of the game and the momentum of the game, especial
ly considering we have a very young team."
Whether or not the Cardinal can realize their ambitions
will depend heavily upon the returning talent; 13 players are
back from last year's 9-9 squad.
"We have returners all over the field," Burker said.
"We're a strong group and a central force in leading the up
coming freshmen. Everyone in the sophomore, junior and
senior classes has been so helpful in teaching the freshmen
about making the adjustment to Division I."
Leading the team will be Burker and senior captains
Kelsey Twist and Nina Pantano.
"Their biggest impact so far has been their decision to
lead by example in terms of getting the young players to re
alize what the games are going to be like," Uhlfelder said.
"They bring game-like attitude and intensity to every prac
tice and get the freshmen to do that as well."
The Cardinal will also rely on new faces to reach new
heights. Eleven players on the roster are rookies â€” nine are
freshmen and two are sophomore walk-ons.
"The freshmen bring a lot of speed and a lot of energy,"
Burker said. "It's changed the whole dynamic of the team.
We're trying a lot of new things and we're excited to have a
fast group that can help us attack our weaknesses from last
year. They've even pushed the returners to make improve
ments."
Although the squad is composed of many new faces, ex
actly half the team hails from the state of Maryland, so many

players know each other from their high-school days.
"Maryland is a hotbed for lacrosse, so I think it's a natu
ral factor among a lot of teams," Uhlfelder said. "For our
team, I think it's just like Stanford in that there are so many
diverse interests and talents among our team that [the Mary
land effect] is diffused and watered-down. The background
and experience of everyone else still shines."
Perhaps, then, these geographic connections cannot fully
explain why the team has found it so easy to mesh with new
people and personalities.
"The greatest part about our team is that it's very fluid
between classes," freshman Katherine Fox said. "There's no
'Freshman, you carry the balls! Freshman, you get the
water!' Freshmen very much have the opportunity to show
up and play and are treated as equals right away. I think of
ourselves as a class only to an extent because the whole team
gets along so well."
Alongside Uhlfelder, two new assistant coaches. Kylee
Reade and Sarah Hughes, will be joining the Cardinal coach
ing staff this year. Reade and Hughes bring different struc
ture to practices and different schemes to games, fundamen
tally altering the structure of the team. The Cardinal will un
veil a more aggressive zone defense this year, in addition to
new wrinkles in terms of stick-work and technique.
One of Stanford's goals this season is to qualify for the
NCAA tournament. To reach the tournament, though, the
Cardinal would have to qualify as an at-large team, as the six
team Mountain Pacific Sports Federation is too small for an
automatic bid. No MPSF team has ever made the NCAA
tournament, so the Cardinal will have to perform well in
their national matchups and prove that they deserve a bid.
"In order to be the best in the country you have to play
the best, and we want the best competition possible," Fox
said.
These national tests will come against championship-cal
iber east-coast teams, including Loyola, Ohio State, Vander
bilt. Northwestern, Georgetown, Notre Dame and Duke,
where Uhlfelder was an assistant.
"We've played them every year since I've left them,"
Uhlfelder said. "The Duke game is certainly not a game on
which I spend a lot of taxing emotional energy, but they're a
great team and we look forward to the competition. It's one
of the highlights of our national schedule."
Many players are also focusing on April 1, when the

women will host Cal. The rivalry
may be even more heated than usual
as Stanford lost in the last six sec
onds to ( al. 11-10, in 2004's confer
ence title game, and will be looking
to gain an inside track in this year's
MPSF race.
"There's definitely a lot of
emotion in that game brought on

obviously by a long rivalry with
Cal, like the Stanford / Cal rivalry
in any sport," Uhlfelder said. "I
think history will play into it, but
we're going to approach that game
like every other game to be honest.
1 think the fact that we're half a
new team is a strength in that
there'll be a balance. Hall the kids
come out extremely hard and hall
the kids have no history, and have
only heard it through the
grapevine. In that case I think
youth can be a positive. It's a new
vear and a new team."
