# Women's water polo shoots for Pacific
## 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the members of the women's water
polo team, Friday's game against the Uni
versity of Hawaii marks the official renewal
of their pursuit of an NCAA title — a pur
suit that last year was cut dramatically short
in a last-second loss to Loyola Marymount
in the NCAA semifinals.
But featuring a roster composed of a tal
ented and experienced core complemented
by a rapidly improving freshman class, the
No. 3 Cardinal women stand well poised to
challenge last year's undefeated champion
USC and the rest of the NCAA for this
year's title.
The 2005 women's squad will be an
chored by the leadership of team captains
Kelty and Hannah Luber, along with junior
Scotti Shafer. The Luber twins return as the
senior members of the Cardinal's 2-meter
offense and defense, as Hannah averaged
more than one goal per game and Kelty es

tablished herself as a dominating force in
the defensive zone during the 2(X)4 season.
Shafer will draw upon her speed and cre
ativity to coordinate the Cardinal's offen
sive effort at the driver position.
Given the leadership base of the team
and the strength of its underclass members,
the loss of last year's seniors Shannon
Avrett, Lauren Faust and leading scorer
Wendy Watkins is not an issue of concern
for head coach John Tanner.
"Every team takes a unique form, so we
don't try to replace graduating players,"
Tanner said. "This year's team has great bal
ance."
That balance is clearly apparent in the
Cardinal's depth on both the offensive and
defensive sides. Returning for her third year
with the Cardinal is junior driver Laurel
Champion, who along with Shafer will be
counted on to create scoring opportunities
from the offensive perimeter. The four
freshman members of the team — Jenna
Scalmanini, Jacquelyn Gauthier, Megan

Nesland and Megan May — are all well on
their way to growing into key roles on the
team.
"Our frosh fit in very well," Tanner said.
"They have a wonderful attitude, work hard
and learn quickly."
The Cardinal s 2-meter position player
options are equally impressive. Junior Val
Riss and sophomore Julia McKinney both
bring an intimidating physical presence to
the Stanford defense, while former Canadi
an national team member Nancy El-
Sakkary contributes her powerful style of
play at the 2-meter mark to the Stanford at
tack.
The Stanford women's team will also
benefit at every position from the preseason
international competition of four of its
sophomores. Goalie Meridith McColl, 2-
meter defender Alison Gregorka, 2-meter
Christina Hewko and driver Katie Hansen
all recently returned home from sparkling
