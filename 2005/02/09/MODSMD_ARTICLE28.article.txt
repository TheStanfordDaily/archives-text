# Women's water polo shoots for Pacific
## 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the members of the women's water
polo team, Friday's game against the Uni
versity of Hawaii marks the official renewal
of their pursuit of an NCAA title — a pur
suit that last year was cut dramatically short
in a last-second loss to Loyola Marymount
in the NCAA semifinals.
But featuring a roster composed of a tal
ented and experienced core complemented
by a rapidly improving freshman class, the
No. 3 Cardinal women stand well poised to
challenge last year's undefeated champion
USC and the rest of the NCAA for this
year's title.
The 2005 women's squad will be an
chored by the leadership of team captains
Kelty and Hannah Luber, along with junior
Scotti Shafer. The Luber twins return as the
senior members of the Cardinal's 2-meter
offense and defense, as Hannah averaged
more than one goal per game and Kelty es

tablished herself as a dominating force in
the defensive zone during the 2(X)4 season.
Shafer will draw upon her speed and cre
ativity to coordinate the Cardinal's offen
sive effort at the driver position.
Given the leadership base of the team
and the strength of its underclass members,
the loss of last year's seniors Shannon
Avrett, Lauren Faust and leading scorer
Wendy Watkins is not an issue of concern
for head coach John Tanner.
"Every team takes a unique form, so we
don't try to replace graduating players,"
Tanner said. "This year's team has great bal
ance."
That balance is clearly apparent in the
Cardinal's depth on both the offensive and
defensive sides. Returning for her third year
with the Cardinal is junior driver Laurel
Champion, who along with Shafer will be
counted on to create scoring opportunities
from the offensive perimeter. The four
freshman members of the team — Jenna
Scalmanini, Jacquelyn Gauthier, Megan

Nesland and Megan May — are all well on
their way to growing into key roles on the
team.
"Our frosh fit in very well," Tanner said.
"They have a wonderful attitude, work hard
and learn quickly."
The Cardinal s 2-meter position player
options are equally impressive. Junior Val
Riss and sophomore Julia McKinney both
bring an intimidating physical presence to
the Stanford defense, while former Canadi
an national team member Nancy El-
Sakkary contributes her powerful style of
play at the 2-meter mark to the Stanford at
tack.
The Stanford women's team will also
benefit at every position from the preseason
international competition of four of its
sophomores. Goalie Meridith McColl, 2-
meter defender Alison Gregorka, 2-meter

performances at the Junior World
Championships in Perth, Australia.
Representing Stanford on the
U.S. National team, all four played
an integral part in helping Team
USA to an undefeated 6-0 record in
the tournament that culminated
with an intense victory over Russia
in the tournament final. Trailing 6-
4 at the half, the U.S. women netted
four unanswered goals in the third
period to take the lead and held on
to win by a score of 11-9. Hansen, a
major scoring threat all week long,
contributed a key goal in the gold

medal game that capped off a tour
nament performance that also in
cluded an incredible five-goal ef
fort against China.
But it was Hewko's game-win
ning goal in the final period of
Team USA's 5-4 semifinal victory
over host Australia that propelled
the U.S. women into the final. The
U.S. women shone in the defensive
end as well, shutting out the
Aussies during the second half of
the game. It was a successful effort
due largely in part to the com
manding play in the defensive zone
by Gregorka, who, in the words of
teammate McColl, "played one of
the best defensive games of her ca
reer."
McColl, who assumes the goal

tending duties for the Cardinal this
year, recorded strong perfor
mances in Team USA's victories
over Hungary in its tournament
opener and New Zealand in the
quarterfinals.
The Cardinal will look to these
four national team members to keep
up the level of play they exhibited at
the world championships.
This weekend offers the Cardi
nal the opportunity to see not only
where they stand at this early stage
of the season, but also where much
of their West coast competition
does as well. Hosting an eight-team
tournament at Avery Aquatic Cen
ter, the Cardinal will have the
chance to face off against a top
ranked UCLA team whose roster

features four members of this past
summer's Olympic team. Among
other teams participating will be
2004 NCAA champion USC, Cal
and Hawaii.
"Our focus this weekend is on
playing at a consistently high level
within each game and during the
course of the weekend," Tanner
said.
There is an unspoken desire in
every member of the team to get the
2005 season and NCAA title pursuit
started with a big splash.

does as well. Hosting an eight-team
tournament at Avery Aquatic Cen
ter, the Cardinal will have the
chance to face off against a top
ranked UCLA team whose roster

features four members of this past
summer's Olympic team. Among
other teams participating will be
2004 NCAA champion USC, Cal
and Hawaii.
"Our focus this weekend is on
playing at a consistently high level
within each game and during the
course of the weekend," Tanner
said.
There is an unspoken desire in
every member of the team to get the
2005 season and NCAA title pursuit
started with a big splash.
The Cardinal take on the Univer
sity of Hawaii Friday at 3 p.m. They
play Saturday at 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.,
then Sunday at 8:30 a.m., and again
that afternoon, time dependant
upon tournament placement.
For the members of the women's water
polo team, Friday's game against the Uni
versity of Hawaii marks the official renewal
of their pursuit of an NCAA title — a pur
suit that last year was cut dramatically short
in a last-second loss to Loyola Marymount
in the NCAA semifinals.
But featuring a roster composed of a tal
ented and experienced core complemented
by a rapidly improving freshman class, the
No. 3 Cardinal women stand well poised to
challenge last year's undefeated champion
USC and the rest of the NCAA for this
year's title.
The 2005 women's squad will be an
chored by the leadership of team captains
Kelty and Hannah Luber, along with junior
Scotti Shafer. The Luber twins return as the
senior members of the Cardinal's 2-meter
offense and defense, as Hannah averaged
more than one goal per game and Kelty es

tablished herself as a dominating force in
the defensive zone during the 2(X)4 season.
Shafer will draw upon her speed and cre
ativity to coordinate the Cardinal's offen
sive effort at the driver position.
Given the leadership base of the team
and the strength of its underclass members,
the loss of last year's seniors Shannon
Avrett, Lauren Faust and leading scorer
Wendy Watkins is not an issue of concern
for head coach John Tanner.
"Every team takes a unique form, so we
don't try to replace graduating players,"
Tanner said. "This year's team has great bal
ance."
That balance is clearly apparent in the
Cardinal's depth on both the offensive and
defensive sides. Returning for her third year
with the Cardinal is junior driver Laurel
Champion, who along with Shafer will be
counted on to create scoring opportunities
from the offensive perimeter. The four
freshman members of the team — Jenna
Scalmanini, Jacquelyn Gauthier, Megan

Nesland and Megan May — are all well on
their way to growing into key roles on the
team.
"Our frosh fit in very well," Tanner said.
"They have a wonderful attitude, work hard
and learn quickly."
The Cardinal s 2-meter position player
options are equally impressive. Junior Val
Riss and sophomore Julia McKinney both
bring an intimidating physical presence to
the Stanford defense, while former Canadi
an national team member Nancy El-
Sakkary contributes her powerful style of
play at the 2-meter mark to the Stanford at

The Stanford women's team will also
benefit at every position from the preseason
international competition of four of its
sophomores. Goalie Meridith McColl, 2-

Championships in Perth, Australia.
Representing Stanford on the
U.S. National team, all four played
an integral part in helping Team
USA to an undefeated 6-0 record in
the tournament that culminated
with an intense victory over Russia
in the tournament final. Trailing 6-
4 at the half, the U.S. women netted
four unanswered goals in the third
period to take the lead and held on
to win by a score of 11-9. Hansen, a
major scoring threat all week long,
contributed a key goal in the gold

medal game that capped off a tour
nament performance that also in
cluded an incredible five-goal ef
fort against China.
But it was Hewko's game-win
ning goal in the final period of
Team USA's 5-4 semifinal victory
over host Australia that propelled
the U.S. women into the final. The
U.S. women shone in the defensive
end as well, shutting out the
Aussies during the second half of
the game. It was a successful effort
due largely in part to the com
manding play in the defensive zone
by Gregorka, who, in the words of
teammate McColl, "played one of
the best defensive games of her ca
reer."
McColl, who assumes the goal

tending duties for the Cardinal this
year, recorded strong perfor
mances in Team USA's victories
over Hungary in its tournament
opener and New Zealand in the
quarterfinals.
The Cardinal will look to these
four national team members to keep
up the level of play they exhibited at
the world championships.
