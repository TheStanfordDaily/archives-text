## The 						Lopez twins choose Stanford 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The good and bad news has
come in twos of late for the Stan
ford men's basketball program.
With the Cardinal mired in a
two-game losing streak, Stanford
received a verbal commitment
Monday from twins Brook and
Robin Lopez, highly touted 6-
foot-11 juniors at San Joaquin
Memorial High School in Fresno,
Calif.
Due to NCAA rules, Stanford
head coach Trent Johnson can
not comment on recruits until
they sign letters of intent in
November. The Lopez twins will
suit up for the Cardinal begin
ning in the fall of 2006.
The announcement ensures
that Johnson's 2006 recruiting
class will be a special one, as the
Lopez twins will help form a
solid nucleus of underclassmen
with incoming 2005 recruits
Lawrence Hill, Mitch Johnson
and Anthony Goods.
Brook, the slightly more her
alded twin, was voted MVP at the
adidas Super 64 camp in I.as
Vegas last summer. He scored 14
points in the title game to lead his
EBO/E:A Sports Fresno-based

team past an Atlanta Celtics
squad that won the elite tourna
ment in 2003 behind NBA first
round picks Dwight Howard and
Josh Smith.
A true post who excels with
his back to the basket, Brook is
rated the No. 5 power forward
and No. 10 overall junior
prospect by rivals.com. Robin is
the No. 3 center and No. 26 over
all junior prospect according to
the recruiting news Web site. The
duo has led the Memorial Pan
thers to a 16-7 record this season,
including a 5-0 mark in North
Yosemite League play.
The twins made unofficial vis
its to UCLA and USC before de
ciding on Stanford and attended
the Cardinal's KK-69 thrashing of
Oregon at Maples Pavilion two
weeks ago. Hand-made signs in
the Sixth Man Club section ac
knowledged their presence.
Johnson is no stranger to
seven-foot twin posts. He was an
assistant with the Cardinal when
Jason and Jarron Collins manned
the frontcourt from 1998 to 2001,
an arrangement that worked out
well for Stanford.
The twins' mother, Deborah
Ledford, graduated from Stan
ford in 1971.
