# Bravman pitches housing overhaul
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to improve undergrad
uate students' residential experiences,
the University unveiled yesterday a
proposal that would fundamentally
change the undergraduate housing sys
tem in coming years.
The changes will provide 650 new
bed spaces for undergraduates, more
all-freshman housing, fewer occupants
per room in several residences and a
Housing Draw that places greater em
phasis on seniority.
The proposal, entitled "Improving
Undergraduate Housing at Stanford,"
was authored by Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education John Brav
man, who presented it twice yesterday
afternoon, to the University Board of
Trustees and to the ASSU executives.
The plan would be implemented
over the next two to six years, depend
ing on construction timelines and the
University's ability to raise enough
funds.
However, Bravman said that noth
ing in the proposal is final and that de
cisions will not be made before feed
back is collected from students and

other community members, a process
that could take months or even years.
"I expect it will be a vigorous and
honest debate that takes into account
the interests of the University at
large," he said in an interview with The
Daily. "I'm hoping to avoid flame-wars
on e-mail chat lists and angry letters to
The Daily."
Because the changes would relocate
Ujamaa House, from Lagunita to pos
sibly Florence Moore Hall, Bravman
met with residents for an hour and a
half on Monday night to go over the
proposal.
He told The Daily that the pro
posed changes to housing would:
• Meet demands for more all-fresh
man housing: Bravman said that hist
year, 3()0 to 400 incoming students who
listed a preference for all-freshman
housing were put elsewhere. He also
said he believes that most freshmen are
better served by all-freshman housing.
Bravman's proposal would turn the
dorms in Wilbur, Stern and Florence
Moore complexes, except for theme
dorms, into all-freshman housing.
• Create more desirable upperclass
housing: The proposal would convert
Branner,Toyon, Roble and Lagunita,
"the lour largest and most elegant un
dergraduate residence halls," as de
scribed in the proposal, for upper
class use.
• Restore academic program
spaces to residences: "Students tell us
all the time they don't have space to
study in their dorms." Bravman said.
The proposal would create, through
reorganization and construction,
more study and seminar spaces in res
idences all over campus.
• "Un-stuff" crowded dorm
rooms: Room occupancies would
he decreased at several residences
on campus. For example, Roble
quads would become doubles, and
the Mirrielees apartments would go
back to housing two people instead
of three.
• Simplify the Housing Draw
along fairer lines: Bravman called
the current Housing Draw a
"labyrinthine" system that can re
sult in some students living in Bob
or Xanadu, popular Row houses,

for three years and other students
living in Wilbur all four years. The
proposal calls for "generally esca
lating quality of housing over the
course of a student's time at Stan
ford."
According to Bravman, the Uni
versity has been looking into ways to
bring "systemic change" to its resi
dence program since IW7 when it re
ceived sweeping recommendations
from the Task Force on Residential
Programs and Student 1 lousing.
However, some of the more lar
reaching recommendations were set
aside because 650 more undergradu
ate bed spaces would be needed to
implement them.
Last winter, the University se
cured a donation from Charles
Munger fora large-scale graduate
housing project, which enabled
Bravman to gain a commitment
from the University to open up the
Crothers and Crothers Memorial
residences for undergraduate hous
ing — which would provide an extra
360 bed spaces.
To bridge the remaining gap be
tween needed and available beds,
Bravman went to the University ad
ministration and obtained support
for the construction of new housing
structures.

One of the main hurdles facing
Bravman's proposal is obtaining the
necessary funding. At around
$100,000 per bed space, Bravman
provided a rough estimate of $30 to
$35 million for the new housing alone.
The University will also need several
million more dollars to refit the
Crothers residences for undergradu
ates.
This funding must come either
from the University budget or, most
likely, from an outside donor.
Bravman emphasized that the
University would not pass on the cost
of new housing students. He said the
search for outside donors has already
started, but he noted the difficulty of
finding people who are willing to
make large contributions specifically
toward housing.
Before anything is finalized. Brav
man said that the University would
take time to bring both students and
the ASSIJ to the table for discussion.
"It's going to be a big, big multi
year effort," he said.
To this end. Director of Residen
tial Education Jane Camarillo said
her organization "will provide recom
mendations on the different popula
tions of student representatives who
should be engaged in the next phase
of planning."

bed spaces for undergraduates, more
all-freshman housing, fewer occupants
per room in several residences and a
Housing Draw that places greater em
phasis on seniority.
The proposal, entitled "Improving
Undergraduate Housing at Stanford,"
was authored by Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education John Brav
man, who presented it twice yesterday
afternoon, to the University Board of
Trustees and to the ASSU executives.
The plan would be implemented
over the next two to six years, depend
ing on construction timelines and the
University's ability to raise enough
funds.
However, Bravman said that noth
ing in the proposal is final and that de
cisions will not be made before feed
back is collected from students and

other community members, a process
that could take months or even years.
"I expect it will be a vigorous and
honest debate that takes into account
the interests of the University at
large," he said in an interview with The
Daily. "I'm hoping to avoid flame-wars
on e-mail chat lists and angry letters to
The Daily."
Because the changes would relocate
Ujamaa House, from Lagunita to pos
sibly Florence Moore Hall, Bravman
met with residents for an hour and a
half on Monday night to go over the
proposal.
He told The Daily that the pro
posed changes to housing would:
• Meet demands for more all-fresh
man housing: Bravman said that hist
year, 3()0 to 400 incoming students who
listed a preference for all-freshman
housing were put elsewhere. He also
said he believes that most freshmen are
better served by all-freshman housing.
Bravman's proposal would turn the
dorms in Wilbur, Stern and Florence
Moore complexes, except for theme
dorms, into all-freshman housing.
• Create more desirable upperclass
housing: The proposal would convert
Branner,Toyon, Roble and Lagunita,
"the lour largest and most elegant un
dergraduate residence halls," as de
scribed in the proposal, for upper
class use.
• Restore academic program
spaces to residences: "Students tell us
all the time they don't have space to
study in their dorms." Bravman said.
The proposal would create, through
reorganization and construction,
more study and seminar spaces in res
idences all over campus.
• "Un-stuff" crowded dorm
rooms: Room occupancies would
he decreased at several residences
on campus. For example, Roble
quads would become doubles, and
the Mirrielees apartments would go
back to housing two people instead
of three.
• Simplify the Housing Draw
along fairer lines: Bravman called
the current Housing Draw a
"labyrinthine" system that can re
sult in some students living in Bob
or Xanadu, popular Row houses,

for three years and other students
living in Wilbur all four years. The
proposal calls for "generally esca
lating quality of housing over the
course of a student's time at Stan
ford."
According to Bravman, the Uni
versity has been looking into ways to
bring "systemic change" to its resi
dence program since IW7 when it re
ceived sweeping recommendations
from the Task Force on Residential
Programs and Student 1 lousing.
However, some of the more lar
reaching recommendations were set
aside because 650 more undergradu
ate bed spaces would be needed to
implement them.
Last winter, the University se
cured a donation from Charles
Munger fora large-scale graduate
housing project, which enabled
Bravman to gain a commitment
from the University to open up the
Crothers and Crothers Memorial
residences for undergraduate hous
ing — which would provide an extra
360 bed spaces.
To bridge the remaining gap be
tween needed and available beds,
Bravman went to the University ad
ministration and obtained support
for the construction of new housing
structures.

One of the main hurdles facing
Bravman's proposal is obtaining the
necessary funding. At around
$100,000 per bed space, Bravman
provided a rough estimate of $30 to
$35 million for the new housing alone.
The University will also need several
million more dollars to refit the
Crothers residences for undergradu
ates.
This funding must come either
from the University budget or, most
likely, from an outside donor.
Bravman emphasized that the
University would not pass on the cost
of new housing students. He said the
search for outside donors has already
started, but he noted the difficulty of
finding people who are willing to
make large contributions specifically
toward housing.
Before anything is finalized. Brav
man said that the University would
take time to bring both students and
the ASSIJ to the table for discussion.
"It's going to be a big, big multi
year effort," he said.
To this end. Director of Residen
tial Education Jane Camarillo said
her organization "will provide recom
mendations on the different popula
tions of student representatives who
should be engaged in the next phase
of planning."
