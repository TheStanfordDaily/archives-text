# Bravman pitches housing overhaul
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to improve undergrad
uate students' residential experiences,
the University unveiled yesterday a
proposal that would fundamentally
change the undergraduate housing sys
tem in coming years.
The changes will provide 650 new
bed spaces for undergraduates, more
all-freshman housing, fewer occupants
per room in several residences and a
Housing Draw that places greater em
phasis on seniority.
The proposal, entitled "Improving
Undergraduate Housing at Stanford,"
was authored by Vice Provost for Un
dergraduate Education John Brav
man, who presented it twice yesterday
afternoon, to the University Board of
Trustees and to the ASSU executives.
The plan would be implemented
over the next two to six years, depend
ing on construction timelines and the
University's ability to raise enough
funds.
However, Bravman said that noth
ing in the proposal is final and that de
cisions will not be made before feed
back is collected from students and

other community members, a process
that could take months or even years.
"I expect it will be a vigorous and
honest debate that takes into account
the interests of the University at
large," he said in an interview with The
Daily. "I'm hoping to avoid flame-wars
on e-mail chat lists and angry letters to
The Daily."
Because the changes would relocate
Ujamaa House, from Lagunita to pos
sibly Florence Moore Hall, Bravman
met with residents for an hour and a
half on Monday night to go over the
proposal.
He told The Daily that the pro
posed changes to housing would:
• Meet demands for more all-fresh
man housing: Bravman said that hist
year, 3()0 to 400 incoming students who
listed a preference for all-freshman
housing were put elsewhere. He also
said he believes that most freshmen are
better served by all-freshman housing.
Bravman's proposal would turn the
dorms in Wilbur, Stern and Florence
Moore complexes, except for theme
dorms, into all-freshman housing.
• Create more desirable upperclass
