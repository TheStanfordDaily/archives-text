# East meets west at Pan-Asian music festival
## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
The inaugural Stanford Pan-Asian Music
Festival kicked off last night, beginning a
five-day long celebration of music, art and
culture.
The festival — a collaboration between
the Department of Music and the Asian Re
ligions and Cultures Initiative — is largely
the brainchild of Orchestral Studies Prof.
Jindong Cai.
"I realized that this was the place to host
such an event," Cai said, noting the diversity
of Stanford's student body and its ties to the
Asian population and arts foundations
around the Bay Area.
The focus of the festival is cross-cultural,
exploring how Eastern and Western cultures
meet and interact through music, Cai added.
"We hope that the festival will be a plat
form not only for artistic collaboration, but
for philosophical and spiritual understand
ing between the cultures of the West and
East," said Beth Youngdoff, a publicist for
the Music Department. "The arts, being by
their nature a mode of communication about
cultural variables and similarities, are per
haps more accessible for many than travel or
language study."
The festival began with a discussion and
book-signing at the Stanford Bookstore with
Cai and his wife Sheila Melvin, co-authors of
a book tilted "Rhapsody in Red: How West
ern Classical Music Became Chinese."
Following the talk was the Festival's first
concert, entitled "Masters of Asian Tradi
tions," held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The

concert featured performances by Xiaofen
Min on the pipa and Habib Khan on the sitar.
On Thursday, Oscar-winning documen
tary director Allen Miller will make an ap
pearance, and on Saturday an ensemble of
Japanese taiko drums will perform. The fes
tival will culminate with a performance by
the Stanford Symphony Orchestra that
night.
Festival organizers and participants are ex
ited about the multimedia nature of the per
formances, especially the visual experience.
"Music is interesting not only from a lis
tener's perspective," Stanford Symphony
Orchestra President Mamei Sun, a junior,
said. "Performers have a chance to be ex
posed to different types of music, and it's re
ally interesting how they blend instrumenta
tion and colors. Listeners can become more
involved in more than music, doing things
other than sitting down."
At Wednesday's event, "New Music from
Asia," musicians will play both Eastern and
Western instruments.
The performance will also feature an in
stallation of artwork by Chinese artist Yang
Jiechangon stage while the musicians play.
"The art is huge and will be really beauti
ful. covering the whole stage," Cai said.
According to Youngdoff, Miller's appear
ance will hopefully reach out to film and art
students. The discussion, titled "Still a Little
Mao in the Mozart," will focus on how West
ern music has influenced and been influ
enced by its exposure to the people of China.
This year's festival will serve a new pur
pose, Youngdoff said, to raise funds for
tsunami relief efforts through the student

group Stanford Students for Relief.
"The Music Department will be providing
spaces for SSR to receive donations at all fes
tival concerts and events," she said. "We've
included the donation information in all our
publicity and hope that our audiences will re
spond generously to the needs of those

whose lives were disrupted by this disaster."
In the future, Cai said he expects the Pan-
Asian Music Festival to become an annual
celebration.
"The general public is fascinated by what
we're going to present," he said. "We've had
an overwhelming response."
