### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
ASSU Undergraduate Senators last
night focused on the appropriation of
funds to various student groups includ
ing the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, the
Episcopal Lutheran Campus Ministry
and the Vessels of Light.
Candidates' timelines for the 2005
ASSU elections and the Faculty Senate's
change to the General Education Re
quirements were alsy announced.
Initially, the appropriations commit
tee recommended not to allocate any
funds to the Episcopal Lutheran Cam
pus Ministry based on the budget re
quest submitted by the organization.
Sophomore Karin Donhowe, the
treasurer of the religious group, said the
student group was refused the money
because of the large balance in its non-
ASSU-funded general account.
"We're on a five-year cycle with that
money and it works out to about $ 15(H)
per year, and we want to sustain the
money over that amount of time," she
said. "We use that money for...the in
terfaith retreat along with several other
religious groups on campus and that will
be happening in the spring."
Appropriations Committee Chair
Daniel Stringer, a junior, explained that
the budget request did not include all of
these costs. No members of the Senate
made a motion to amend the fund allo
cation to the religious group and instead
recommended that the group resubmit a
budget request containing all costs.
The Delta Sigma Theta sorority also
requested modifications made to their
budget.
"We're here to basically ask fora little
bit more money for our Winter Weekend
Program which is this weekend," a repre
sentative from the sorority said.
"Our argument for why we need
money for this is that a lot of our pro
gramming throughout the year is geared
toward serious issues," she added. "Win
ter Weekend is really a time for us to
show our other side and we're only ask
ing for help to subsidize it."
Additionally, Delta Sigma Theta re
quested extra lunds to create program
books for the 11th Annual Delta Gym
Spectacular, an event that recognizes the
contributions of black men to Stanford
and to the general community. The Senate
voted to increase lunding for this event
but not lor the Winter Weekend Program.
Elections Commissioner Troy Stein
metz, a sophomore, announced that the
information session for candidates for
this year's election will be on Thursday,
Feb. 17. Steinmetz addressed the Senate
"to encourage them to do whatever they
possibly can to get people to run."
