# Golfer rebuilds his game
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For many world-class golfers, a debil
itating back injury would spell the end of
a career. For Stanford alumnus and
four-time PGA Tour winner Notah
Begay, it marked the beginning of a jour
ney to a deeper understanding of his
craft.
Yesterday Begay, alongside personal
trainer Chris Frankel, shared the story of
his ongoing recovery with Orthopedic
Surgery Prof. Amy Ladd's "Anatomy of
Movement" class as part of the course's
ongoing study of human movement in its
many forms and applications.
A four-year letter winner for the
Stanford golf team, Begay was a mem
ber of the 1994 NCAA Championship
team. He was also teammates with
PGA Tour star Tiger Woods on the
1995 Stanford team that fell short of a
second consecutive championship in a
playoff with Oklahoma State.
Following a star-studded collegiate
career in which he set the record for the
best individual round in NCAA Cham
pionship history (10-under-par 62 in the
second round of the 1994 champi
onship) and was a three-time All-
American, Begay left the Farm to ply
his trade at the highest level.
The Stanford captain quickly went
from amateur star to PGA rookie
phenom. Then sophomore sensation.
After qualifying for the PGA Tour in
1998, Begay looked at home against
the toughest competition in the world,
notching four victories and collecting
more than $3 million in official prize
money during his first two years.
After reminding golf viewers that
Woods was not the only talented Stanford
alumnus on the tour, Begay began experi
encing pain in his lower back.
