# Golfer rebuilds his game
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For many world-class golfers, a debil
itating back injury would spell the end of
a career. For Stanford alumnus and
four-time PGA Tour winner Notah
Begay, it marked the beginning of a jour
ney to a deeper understanding of his
craft.
Yesterday Begay, alongside personal
trainer Chris Frankel, shared the story of
his ongoing recovery with Orthopedic
Surgery Prof. Amy Ladd's "Anatomy of
Movement" class as part of the course's
ongoing study of human movement in its
many forms and applications.
A four-year letter winner for the
Stanford golf team, Begay was a mem
ber of the 1994 NCAA Championship
team. He was also teammates with
PGA Tour star Tiger Woods on the
1995 Stanford team that fell short of a
second consecutive championship in a
playoff with Oklahoma State.
Following a star-studded collegiate
career in which he set the record for the
best individual round in NCAA Cham
pionship history (10-under-par 62 in the
second round of the 1994 champi
onship) and was a three-time All-
American, Begay left the Farm to ply
his trade at the highest level.
The Stanford captain quickly went
from amateur star to PGA rookie
phenom. Then sophomore sensation.
After qualifying for the PGA Tour in
1998, Begay looked at home against
the toughest competition in the world,
notching four victories and collecting
more than $3 million in official prize
money during his first two years.
After reminding golf viewers that
Woods was not the only talented Stanford
alumnus on the tour, Begay began experi
encing pain in his lower back.

of Movement class.
"Standing on the tee at the ninth
hole at |Augusta National Golf
Course], about six months after I
got hurt. I was trying to tee the ball
up and literally almost falling
down," Begay said. "I was almost
falling down after every shot, be
cause I was in so much pain in my
lower back."
What came to be diagnosed as
an annular tear in the lining of the
L4-L5 disc in his back robbed
Begay of not only his opportunity
to compete for tournament purses,
but to enjoy the game that he loved.
"A lot of that period in my ca
reer 1 don't remember," Begay
said. "I think 1 had to go to some
pretty dark places to get through
those rounds of golf."
Just as difficult as the physical
struggle was the mental battle
Begay waged on a daily basis.
"1 had so much confidence [be
fore the injury]," Begay said.
"Once you start to see the results
and once you start to see the out
comes become negative, then it
starts to eat into the mental side [of
your game]. 'Is it me. or is it the in
jury?"'
His search for an answer led him
to Frankel, a trainer at the Univer
sity of New Mexico with 25 years of
experience training mainly football

players and boxers.
Although Frankel had no prior
experience working with golfers,
he plunged himself into Begay's sit
uation. marveling at his client's de
termination and drive to improve
himself.
"He's phenomenal," Frankel
said. "He's demanding, but he tells
you what he expects and keeps you
at the top of your game. I have two
kids and a beautiful wife at home,
and wouldn't have left them [to
travel with Begay] if it weren't a
great working environment."
Frankel is quick to point out that
the pair's training session didn't
"fix" Begay's injury, but instead
"re-educated the muscles so the
game of golf isn't damaging."
The road to recovery has been a
humbling one, rebuilding Begay's
game "literally from the ground
up," as Frankel has pushed him to
improve his core strength and the
strength of "global muscles" that
could take pressure away from his
ailing back.
"It has been frustrating re-learn
ing a sit-up. I felt like a first-grader
doing it," Begay said. "I had no
choice but to check my ego at the
door."
In the scheme of Ladd's class,
Begay's story offers a concrete ex
ample of physiological advance
ments on collision course with the
needs of the world's top physical
competitors.
"Notah is a high-level profes
sional athlete, whom I know very

well," said Ladd. who met Begay
while serving as physician to the
Stanford golf team. "He was a nat
ural choice."
Though he is not yet back to
playing at his pre-injury level,
Begay has found a new balance and
peace within his game.
"When I come off the course, I
feel my left side and right side are
equally tired." Begay said. "It's a
great feeling.
Even greater is his feeling that
scientific research will continue to
mold his game as well as the world
of sport in general.
"You're starting to see science
play a larger role in terms of fitness
and in the innovation and improve
ment of equipment," Begay said.
Though nearly every sport has
felt the touch of science over the
years, perhaps none has changed so
profoundly as golf, with debates
ranging from whether Woods'
choice of a Nike driver holds him
back to how course architects
should respond to a new generation
of long-ball hitters.
Also on hand for the guest lec
ture was William Yanagisawa, a
teammate of Begay's from the class
of 1995.

said. "He's demanding, but he tells
you what he expects and keeps you
at the top of your game. I have two
kids and a beautiful wife at home,
and wouldn't have left them [to
travel with Begay] if it weren't a
great working environment."
Frankel is quick to point out that
the pair's training session didn't
"fix" Begay's injury, but instead
"re-educated the muscles so the
game of golf isn't damaging."
The road to recovery has been a
humbling one, rebuilding Begay's
game "literally from the ground
up," as Frankel has pushed him to
improve his core strength and the
strength of "global muscles" that
could take pressure away from his
ailing back.
"It has been frustrating re-learn
ing a sit-up. I felt like a first-grader
doing it," Begay said. "I had no
choice but to check my ego at the
door."
In the scheme of Ladd's class,
Begay's story offers a concrete ex
ample of physiological advance
ments on collision course with the
needs of the world's top physical
competitors.
"Notah is a high-level profes
sional athlete, whom I know very

well," said Ladd. who met Begay
while serving as physician to the
Stanford golf team. "He was a nat
ural choice."
Though he is not yet back to
playing at his pre-injury level,
Begay has found a new balance and
peace within his game.
"When I come off the course, I
feel my left side and right side are
equally tired." Begay said. "It's a
great feeling.
Even greater is his feeling that
scientific research will continue to
mold his game as well as the world
of sport in general.
"You're starting to see science
play a larger role in terms of fitness
and in the innovation and improve
ment of equipment," Begay said.
Though nearly every sport has
felt the touch of science over the
years, perhaps none has changed so
profoundly as golf, with debates
ranging from whether Woods'
choice of a Nike driver holds him
back to how course architects
should respond to a new generation
of long-ball hitters.
Also on hand for the guest lec
ture was William Yanagisawa, a
teammate of Begay's from the class
of 1995.
For many world-class golfers, a debil
itating back injury would spell the end of
a career. For Stanford alumnus and
four-time PGA Tour winner Notah
Begay, it marked the beginning of a jour
ney to a deeper understanding of his
craft.
Yesterday Begay, alongside personal
trainer Chris Frankel, shared the story of
his ongoing recovery with Orthopedic
Surgery Prof. Amy Ladd's "Anatomy of
Movement" class as part of the course's
ongoing study of human movement in its
many forms and applications.
A four-year letter winner for the
Stanford golf team, Begay was a mem
ber of the 1994 NCAA Championship
team. He was also teammates with
PGA Tour star Tiger Woods on the
1995 Stanford team that fell short of a
second consecutive championship in a
playoff with Oklahoma State.
Following a star-studded collegiate
career in which he set the record for the
best individual round in NCAA Cham
pionship history (10-under-par 62 in the
second round of the 1994 champi
onship) and was a three-time All-
American, Begay left the Farm to ply
his trade at the highest level.
The Stanford captain quickly went
from amateur star to PGA rookie
phenom. Then sophomore sensation.
After qualifying for the PGA Tour in
1998, Begay looked at home against
the toughest competition in the world,
notching four victories and collecting
more than $3 million in official prize
money during his first two years.
After reminding golf viewers that
Woods was not the only talented Stanford
alumnus on the tour, Begay began experi
encing pain in his lower back.

of Movement class.
"Standing on the tee at the ninth
hole at |Augusta National Golf
Course], about six months after I
got hurt. I was trying to tee the ball
up and literally almost falling
down," Begay said. "I was almost
falling down after every shot, be
cause I was in so much pain in my
lower back."
What came to be diagnosed as
an annular tear in the lining of the
L4-L5 disc in his back robbed
Begay of not only his opportunity
to compete for tournament purses,
but to enjoy the game that he loved.
"A lot of that period in my ca
reer 1 don't remember," Begay
said. "I think 1 had to go to some
pretty dark places to get through
those rounds of golf."
Just as difficult as the physical
struggle was the mental battle
Begay waged on a daily basis.
"1 had so much confidence [be
fore the injury]," Begay said.
"Once you start to see the results
and once you start to see the out
comes become negative, then it
starts to eat into the mental side [of
your game]. 'Is it me. or is it the in
jury?"'
His search for an answer led him
to Frankel, a trainer at the Univer
sity of New Mexico with 25 years of
experience training mainly football

players and boxers.
Although Frankel had no prior
experience working with golfers,
he plunged himself into Begay's sit
uation. marveling at his client's de
termination and drive to improve
himself.
"He's phenomenal," Frankel
said. "He's demanding, but he tells
you what he expects and keeps you
at the top of your game. I have two
kids and a beautiful wife at home,
