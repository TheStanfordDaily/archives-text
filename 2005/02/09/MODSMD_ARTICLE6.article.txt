Describing himself as it natural optimist,
Thomas Friedman said last night that he still be
lieves in the Iraq war and its potential to cat
alyze change in the Arab Muslim world.
"This is not about oil," The New York
Times' foreign affairs columnist told a sellout
crowd in Kresge Auditorium. "This is about
something really noble, crazy noble. It is the
first attempt in the modern history of the Arab
world for Arabs in their own country to forge
their own social contract, their own constitu
tion."
Friedman described his thinking on the Iraq
war as "tortured," because for him, it was a
"struggle between hope and experience."
He said his experience as a correspondent in
the Middle East told him that democratizing
Iraq would be a staggeringly difficult project, far
more so than the George W. Bush administra
tion predicted. But Friedman said that in the last
three years traveling the Middle East he was
won over by the hope of young people there
who desperately wanted a freer society.
"The war on terrorism is a war of ideas," he
said, echoing a theme that has long resonated in
his columns. Building on the recent Iraqi elec
tion "is actually the single most important thing
we could do in this war on terrorism," because if
a successful democracy can be established in
Iraq, "it can be done anywhere," he said.
That doesn't mean the United States is head
ed for more wars, though, he said.
"Promise not to tell the Iranians?" he joked
in a whisper. "We're not invading anybody. We
couldn't occupy Granada today."
Rather, "a successful Iraq is our Iran reform
policy," he argued. "The Shi'ite Muslims who will
assume the majority of Iraq's government posts
"are the same Shi'ites who live in Iran," he said,
and if Iraq succeeds it will ratchet up the pressure
