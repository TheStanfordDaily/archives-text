# Friedman sees pros to Iraq war
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Describing himself as it natural optimist,
Thomas Friedman said last night that he still be
lieves in the Iraq war and its potential to cat
alyze change in the Arab Muslim world.
"This is not about oil," The New York
Times' foreign affairs columnist told a sellout
crowd in Kresge Auditorium. "This is about
something really noble, crazy noble. It is the
first attempt in the modern history of the Arab
world for Arabs in their own country to forge
their own social contract, their own constitu
tion."
Friedman described his thinking on the Iraq
war as "tortured," because for him, it was a
"struggle between hope and experience."
He said his experience as a correspondent in
the Middle East told him that democratizing
Iraq would be a staggeringly difficult project, far
more so than the George W. Bush administra
tion predicted. But Friedman said that in the last
three years traveling the Middle East he was
won over by the hope of young people there
who desperately wanted a freer society.
"The war on terrorism is a war of ideas," he
said, echoing a theme that has long resonated in
his columns. Building on the recent Iraqi elec
tion "is actually the single most important thing
we could do in this war on terrorism," because if
a successful democracy can be established in
Iraq, "it can be done anywhere," he said.
That doesn't mean the United States is head
ed for more wars, though, he said.
"Promise not to tell the Iranians?" he joked
in a whisper. "We're not invading anybody. We
couldn't occupy Granada today."
Rather, "a successful Iraq is our Iran reform
policy," he argued. "The Shi'ite Muslims who will
assume the majority of Iraq's government posts
"are the same Shi'ites who live in Iran," he said,
and if Iraq succeeds it will ratchet up the pressure

for democratic reform there.
He said the fundamental prob
lem in the region is a "human-de
velopment crisis." The United
States has for too long treated the
Middle East as "a series of gas sta
tions." propping up autocratic
regimes in return for access to oil
Friedman said. But those regimes
make Faustian bargains with reli
gious leaders, he said, leaving the
general populace adrift in a sea of
radical ideology.
Despite his support for democ
racy in Iraq, Friedman distanced
himself from the neo-conserva
tive agenda.
"I'm not a neo-con. I'm a geo
green," he said. He blasted Bush
for making social security privati
zation his top priority. Instead, he
called for"a Manhattan Project
for sustainable, alternative, re
newable energy" drawing a spon
taneous ovation from the crowd.

"Lower oil prices means polit
ical reform." he explained. "Oil is
... precisely what is empowering
the worst forces in [the Arab Mus
lim) world."
He noted that the first Arab
country to run out of oil was the
tiny country Bahrain. And it is no
accident, he said, that Bahrain was
also the first country in the region
to hold a free and fair election.
Friedman's qualified support
of U.S. involvement in Iraq was
received with less enthusiasm by
what seemed to be a generally
anti-war crowd.
The last questioner said he
agreed with Friedman's comment
that humiliation was a major moti
vator for the Sept. 11 suicide
bombers, but pointedly asked
whether Friedman could deny that
U.S. sanctions and "support for Is
raeli aggression" were among the
sources of that humiliation.
Friedman paused a moment
before responding.
"If you want to play the blame
game, we could do it all night. But
it's, like, really fun — like people
should trv it more — to reallv root

for people when they do the right
thing," he said, referring to the
bravery of Iraqis who turned out
to vote on Jan. 30. "I would urge
you to enjoy it. get behind it, cele
brate it. They're trying to claim
their future."
Introduced by Stanford Israel
Alliance Co-president Adam
Eisen as "a voice of reason in an
overly partisan political dia
logue," Friedman did not shy
away from criticizing either side
of the Iraq debate. He jabbed the
Bush administration several
times, but also chided liberals for
underestimating the need and po
tential to change the political cul
ture of Arab Muslim countries.
Terrorist networks are "the
third great totalitarian challenge to
open societies in the last 100
years." after Soviet communism
and Nazism, he said. And they may
be more dangerous than the previ
ous two. he argued, because they
undermine the trust that provides
the foundation for free societies.
"One more 9/11 and that will be
the end of our open society as we
know it,"he said.
