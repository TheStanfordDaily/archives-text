# Who's your neighbor?

### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a statement to the University's Board of
Trustees in 1897, Jane Stanford wrote, "It is desir
able that the members of the faculty and the stu
dents should generally reside upon the grounds of
the University."
On the Upper Row, Jane Stanford's statement
has been honored — administrators, students and
faculty live in close proximity, often in adjacent
houses. Faculty and their families live in houses lo
cated behind Slavianskii Dom, Kairos and Phi Psi,
as well as in houses near Roth and 717 Dolores. The
Pearce Mitchell condominiums, located across the
street from Kairos, is also home to faculty.
Yet despite inhabiting the same blocks, resi

dents said there is often little interaction, negative
or positive, between students and faculty. Resi
dents of Durand said they know that Jane Camaril
lo, director of Residential Education, is one of their
neighbors in the Gardiner House (the large, white
house between Durand and Haus Mitteleuropa),
but rarely have much interaction with her.
"Most of my residents do know Dr. Jane is our
neighbor, but the communication about this issue
usually always stops there," said senior Freddie
Nunez, a resident assistant in Durand.
Shelley Goldman, professor of education said,
"The Row is actually a very quiet neighborhood.
We see students in passing and say 'hello,' but
rarely have any extended interactions with them."

In the interest of fostering the spirit of com
munity advocated by Jane Stanford in her mes
sage to the Board of Trustees, below is a brief
introduction to the faculty and administrators
who live among students on the Row.
The Gardiner House
Jane Camarillo has lived on the Row for
three years. She said she finds that residents of
the Row, both faculty and students, respect
each other; students warn other residents when
parties are scheduled and how late they will
last, and faculty are supportive of student tra
ditions — even those that take place late at
night.
"My faculty neighbors are pretty under
standing that a residential college campus of
students will have noise during parties and Pri
mal Scream." Camarillo said. "They take it
with good humor and appreciation of the need
to relax."
Living on campus is part of Camarillo's
job as director of residential education; she
is able to respond quickly to any emergen
cies and easily meet with students at night.
Besides being on hand to respond to situa
tions where the presence of a member of stu

dent affairs is helpful or necessary, Camaril
lo said living on the Row lets her connect
with students.
"In the first year, I was able to host in my
patio a series of focus groups with peer aca
demic advisors who live on the Row and ask
them about academic and advising resources
offered to upper-class students on the Row,"
Camarillo said.
Also living in Gardiner House are Political
Science Prof. Mike Tomz and his family, who
moved to the Row in the summer of 2000.
Tomz has two young daughters, ages two and
four, for whom life on the Row has offered
some unique opportunities.
"Living near students helps them under
stand who I teach," Tomz said. "And thus
makes it more fun to talk about my job at
home. My daughters like to see what the big
kids do on the Mayfield Playfield, the big field
across the street from our house. We've seen
some pretty amusing activities, including 'kick
the keg."'

Education Prof. Shelley Goldman spent
nine years in several different dorms before
moving to the Row. Although she enjoys life
on the Row, Goldman said she wishes there

was more faculty-student interaction, as there
is in the dorms.
"We actually think it is a shame that there is
so little interaction with Row students," Gold
man said. "It would go a long way if Residen
tial Education and the homeowners held some
events like block parties to increase the inter
actions. We miss our interactions with under
graduates a great deal and wish we knew our
neighbors better."
Goldman's residence, 615 Mayfield, has an
interesting historical background.
"[ItJ was in the first group of homes com
missioned by Lou Henry Hoover for junior fac
ulty and staff in the 1920s and it was designed
by Birge Clarke, who was a prominent Bay
Area architect," she said. "A history of the
house is currently being written up by the Stan
ford Historical Society."
In addition, former President John F.
Kennedy may have stayed in the cottage on the
property during his one semester at Stanford.

Although some say they have been disap
pointed with the lack of student-faculty in
teraction on the Upper Row, as dean of the
South Row, Elizabeth Bernhardt says she is
able to get to know students in a more re

laxed environment than in classes.
"It's fun to talk to students in an informal
context that doesn't have an agenda" Bern
hardt, a professor in German studies, said.,
"And it's super fun to talk to upperclassmen.
Sometimes i listen to the conversation and
think, 'Ok, my future is in this person's hands.
Do 1 feel comfortable about that?' I almost al
ways answer 'Yes.'"
As dean, Bernhardt provides academic
support for the residents of the Row — all
600 of them. She said one of her goals is ad
vising sophomores, who are new to the more
independent lifestyle of Row residents. Bern
hardt invites South Row residents to visit her
home several times a quarter.
As for day-to-day life on the Row, Bern
hardt said, "The student noise is kind of fun in
a weird way. Sometimes 1 feel like a character
in The Great Gatsby. 1 lie in bed and listen to
music, voices and laughing in the distance."
Bernhardt said she views the neighborhood
as an important social structure that can pro
vide support when necessary.
"I've come to respect the support system
within each house, particularly within the
sororities," she said. "I feel that if something
happened in the middle of the night, I could
go to any of my neighbors and they would
help me.

ditions — even those that take place late at
night.
"My faculty neighbors are pretty under
standing that a residential college campus of
students will have noise during parties and Pri
mal Scream." Camarillo said. "They take it
with good humor and appreciation of the need
to relax."
Living on campus is part of Camarillo's
job as director of residential education; she
is able to respond quickly to any emergen
cies and easily meet with students at night.
Besides being on hand to respond to situa
tions where the presence of a member of stu

dent affairs is helpful or necessary, Camaril
lo said living on the Row lets her connect
with students.
"In the first year, I was able to host in my
patio a series of focus groups with peer aca
demic advisors who live on the Row and ask
them about academic and advising resources
offered to upper-class students on the Row,"
Camarillo said.
Also living in Gardiner House are Political
Science Prof. Mike Tomz and his family, who
moved to the Row in the summer of 2000.
Tomz has two young daughters, ages two and
four, for whom life on the Row has offered
some unique opportunities.
"Living near students helps them under
stand who I teach," Tomz said. "And thus
makes it more fun to talk about my job at
home. My daughters like to see what the big
kids do on the Mayfield Playfield, the big field
across the street from our house. We've seen
some pretty amusing activities, including 'kick
the keg."'

Education Prof. Shelley Goldman spent
nine years in several different dorms before
moving to the Row. Although she enjoys life
on the Row, Goldman said she wishes there

was more faculty-student interaction, as there
is in the dorms.
"We actually think it is a shame that there is
so little interaction with Row students," Gold
man said. "It would go a long way if Residen
tial Education and the homeowners held some
events like block parties to increase the inter
actions. We miss our interactions with under
graduates a great deal and wish we knew our
neighbors better."
Goldman's residence, 615 Mayfield, has an
interesting historical background.
"[ItJ was in the first group of homes com
missioned by Lou Henry Hoover for junior fac
ulty and staff in the 1920s and it was designed
by Birge Clarke, who was a prominent Bay
Area architect," she said. "A history of the
house is currently being written up by the Stan
ford Historical Society."
In addition, former President John F.
Kennedy may have stayed in the cottage on the
property during his one semester at Stanford.

Although some say they have been disap
pointed with the lack of student-faculty in
teraction on the Upper Row, as dean of the
South Row, Elizabeth Bernhardt says she is
able to get to know students in a more re

laxed environment than in classes.
"It's fun to talk to students in an informal
context that doesn't have an agenda" Bern
hardt, a professor in German studies, said.,
"And it's super fun to talk to upperclassmen.
Sometimes i listen to the conversation and
think, 'Ok, my future is in this person's hands.
Do 1 feel comfortable about that?' I almost al
ways answer 'Yes.'"
As dean, Bernhardt provides academic
support for the residents of the Row — all
600 of them. She said one of her goals is ad
vising sophomores, who are new to the more
independent lifestyle of Row residents. Bern
hardt invites South Row residents to visit her
home several times a quarter.
As for day-to-day life on the Row, Bern
hardt said, "The student noise is kind of fun in
a weird way. Sometimes 1 feel like a character
in The Great Gatsby. 1 lie in bed and listen to
music, voices and laughing in the distance."
Bernhardt said she views the neighborhood
as an important social structure that can pro
vide support when necessary.
"I've come to respect the support system
within each house, particularly within the
sororities," she said. "I feel that if something
happened in the middle of the night, I could
go to any of my neighbors and they would
help me.
In a statement to the University's Board of
Trustees in 1897, Jane Stanford wrote, "It is desir
able that the members of the faculty and the stu
dents should generally reside upon the grounds of
the University."
On the Upper Row, Jane Stanford's statement
has been honored — administrators, students and
faculty live in close proximity, often in adjacent
houses. Faculty and their families live in houses lo
cated behind Slavianskii Dom, Kairos and Phi Psi,
as well as in houses near Roth and 717 Dolores. The
Pearce Mitchell condominiums, located across the
street from Kairos, is also home to faculty.
Yet despite inhabiting the same blocks, resi

dents said there is often little interaction, negative
or positive, between students and faculty. Resi
dents of Durand said they know that Jane Camaril
lo, director of Residential Education, is one of their
neighbors in the Gardiner House (the large, white
house between Durand and Haus Mitteleuropa),
but rarely have much interaction with her.
"Most of my residents do know Dr. Jane is our
neighbor, but the communication about this issue
usually always stops there," said senior Freddie
Nunez, a resident assistant in Durand.
Shelley Goldman, professor of education said,
"The Row is actually a very quiet neighborhood.
We see students in passing and say 'hello,' but
rarely have any extended interactions with them."

munity advocated by Jane Stanford in her mes
sage to the Board of Trustees, below is a brief
introduction to the faculty and administrators
who live among students on the Row.
