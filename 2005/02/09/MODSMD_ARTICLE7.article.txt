# Who's your neighbor?

In a statement to the University's Board of
Trustees in 1897, Jane Stanford wrote, "It is desir
able that the members of the faculty and the stu
dents should generally reside upon the grounds of
the University."
On the Upper Row, Jane Stanford's statement
has been honored â€” administrators, students and
faculty live in close proximity, often in adjacent
houses. Faculty and their families live in houses lo
cated behind Slavianskii Dom, Kairos and Phi Psi,
as well as in houses near Roth and 717 Dolores. The
Pearce Mitchell condominiums, located across the
street from Kairos, is also home to faculty.
Yet despite inhabiting the same blocks, resi

dents said there is often little interaction, negative
or positive, between students and faculty. Resi
dents of Durand said they know that Jane Camaril
lo, director of Residential Education, is one of their
neighbors in the Gardiner House (the large, white
house between Durand and Haus Mitteleuropa),
but rarely have much interaction with her.
"Most of my residents do know Dr. Jane is our
neighbor, but the communication about this issue
usually always stops there," said senior Freddie
Nunez, a resident assistant in Durand.
Shelley Goldman, professor of education said,
"The Row is actually a very quiet neighborhood.
We see students in passing and say 'hello,' but
rarely have any extended interactions with them."
