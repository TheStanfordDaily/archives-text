Improving Undergraduate Housing at Stanford
The University has been examining the proper relationship between residential programs, undergraduate education, and the system of housing assignments
since before it established the Residential Education program in the late 1960'5. More recently, in 1997, a formal review of housing was launched by then
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, Ramon Saldfvar. The Task Force on Residential Programs and Student Housing, co-chaired by Vice Provost
Saldfvar and former Vice Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya, forwarded the following recommendations to the University's leadership:
• Increase the number of all-frosh houses and enhance the academic programs therein;
• Create a "premier year" in the housing assignment draw and simplify the room selection process;
• Enhance academic support structures and think about different support levels for upper class houses;
• Create a freshman-sophomore residential cluster.
Although progress has been made toward these goals, we now have a convergence of resources and opportunities that will allow us to accomplish them more
fully and to address many other issues with our housing system.
What follows here is neither a final description of a plan, nor a detailed roadmap for its implementation. We expect this plan to evolve and to be phased in
over the next two to six years or longer. We are at the beginning of a long period of study, deliberation, and analysis, and there will be no opportunity for even
initial implementation in the 2005—2006 academic year. While there has already been much discussion and number crunching, some of which leads rather
inexorably to certain conclusions, there is much to be done.
Although our thinking about the future of undergraduate housing has been expansive, there are several characteristics of our current programs to which we
have absolute commitment. This is Stanford University; we are not attempting to be anyone else. With its support for and augmentation of the academic
mission of the University, its emphasis on community, service, and citizenship, and its essential role in providing personal support for all students, preemi
nence in Residential Education remains our key objective. We not only affirm, but celebrate, our resolute commitment to a variety of academic, ethnic, and
programmatic theme houses, to multiple opportunities for student leadership and service, and to a coupling of living, learning, advising, and mentoring.
Indeed, we have begun these discussions in large part because of our desire to invigorate further the totality of the residential experience at Stanford.
When the Munger Graduate Residences are completed, the 360 beds of Crothers and Crothers Memorial Halls will become available for undergraduate hous
ing. Coupled with the planned construction of one additional dorm in the Manzanita Park area and three additional row houses (or, alternatively, two addi
tional dorms) we now have within our grasp the long-sought opportunity to "un-stuff" mini-doubles, triples, and quads across the campus. But at the core
of the ambitious plan we have envisioned is the larger opportunity to examine the entire system of housing and re-conceptualize our current housing stock
to achieve (1) a more balanced freshman housing experience, (2) a superior upper-class experience marked by a guarantee of a generally escalating quality
of housing over the course of a student's time at Stanford, and (3) a restoration of academic program spaces to the residences. These three goals, joined by
the goals of un-stuffing the housing system and rationalizing The Draw, have been the impetus for our thinking.
Beyond the conversion of Crothers and Crothers Memorials for undergraduates, another element of our plan would have us convert the four largest and most
elegant undergraduate residence halls to upper-class use. With significantly lowered occupancies, these halls would be highly attractive within the Draw. It
is only through the combination of (1) these four conversions, (2) the conversion of Crothers and Crothers Memorial, and (3) the construction of approxi
mately 300 new bed spaces that we can simultaneously achieve our goals of both un-stuffing the system and providing an escalating quality of rooms for our
upperclassmen. To the extent that we do not implement these conversions, the number of new bed spaces needed to achieve our goals would grow beyond
our likely fundraising ability. As it is, raising the funds to construct 300 additional bed spaces would be a challenging task.
Thus, in an admitted break from the recent past, Branner, Toyon, Roble, and Lagunita would become three-class residences with no first year students, and
the three-room quads, two-room triples, and mini-doubles found in these complexes would be down-rated to double or single occupancies. One can easily
imagine, for instance, that a current Roble quad comprising two sleeping rooms and a common space between, which is currently used for four freshmen,
would become a very desirable rooming option for just two upperclassmen. In a similar fashion, our housing plan would also enable us to return Mirrielees
apartments to double occupancy rooms, to convert Branner triples to two-room doubles, and to recreate within many houses across campus the study and
seminar spaces that largely have been lost over the past fifteen or so years.
In Stanford's undergraduate housing program, the enduring value of cross-cultural theme houses is widely recognized, and particularly so for entering fresh
men. Within our proposals we would preserve all ethnic theme houses, but also establish premier upper-class spaces in Lagunita Court by down-rating the
mini-doubles to single occupancy rooms. As a result, Ujamaa House, to maintain its approximate size and four-class nature, would need to be recreated else
where, possibly in two houses of Florence Moore Hall. A new resident fellow home would be constructed along with a lounge and program space that would
match or exceed in size and function those found in the current location.
A primary goal in the proposed restructuring is to improve our service to freshmen, especially with regard to advising and personal support, providing to a
greater degree a common freshman year experience, and meeting the significant unmet demand for all-frosh housing. To accomplish these objectives, the
houses comprising Wilbur, Stern, and Florence Moore would become all-freshman, with the exception of Okada, Casa Zapata, and the possible new Ujamaa
at Florence Moore, each of which would remain as four-class houses. The Freshman-Sophomore College would be maintained in Governors Corner. It is also
possible that a four-class residence, in addition to Okada, Casa Zapata, and Ujamaa, would be established somewhere other than in Wilbur, Stern, or Florence
Moore. If so, it would be established with a "critical mass" of freshmen.
The last element of our plan entails a thorough redesign of the Housing Draw, in order to establish a simpler seniority system that better allocates the pre
mier spaces created in the housing system. We will also seek additional safeguards to prevent "gaming the system" and to create a greater sense of fairness
and equity across the entire student body.
The kinds of plans envisioned here are significant in many ways, and clearly affect both a number of long-standing traditions as well as the nature of the post
for some Resident Fellows. Such things have changed before, and they will change again; this has been Stanford's way. Branner Hall, for instance, was for
decades a four-class women's dormitory, and Wilbur Hall opened as a men's dormitory. Change is hard. It is in and of itself neither good nor bad. We seek a
stronger residences program in order to build a stronger Stanford, and as a capstone to the remarkable achievements of the past decade in Undergraduate
Education. Over the ensuing months and yes, years, we look forward to a full and vigorous discussion of these ideas.

would become a very desirable rooming option for just two upperclassmen. In a similar fashion, our housing plan would also enable us to return Mirrielees
apartments to double occupancy rooms, to convert Branner triples to two-room doubles, and to recreate within many houses across campus the study and
seminar spaces that largely have been lost over the past fifteen or so years.
In Stanford's undergraduate housing program, the enduring value of cross-cultural theme houses is widely recognized, and particularly so for entering fresh
men. Within our proposals we would preserve all ethnic theme houses, but also establish premier upper-class spaces in Lagunita Court by down-rating the
mini-doubles to single occupancy rooms. As a result, Ujamaa House, to maintain its approximate size and four-class nature, would need to be recreated else
where, possibly in two houses of Florence Moore Hall. A new resident fellow home would be constructed along with a lounge and program space that would
match or exceed in size and function those found in the current location.
A primary goal in the proposed restructuring is to improve our service to freshmen, especially with regard to advising and personal support, providing to a
greater degree a common freshman year experience, and meeting the significant unmet demand for all-frosh housing. To accomplish these objectives, the
houses comprising Wilbur, Stern, and Florence Moore would become all-freshman, with the exception of Okada, Casa Zapata, and the possible new Ujamaa
at Florence Moore, each of which would remain as four-class houses. The Freshman-Sophomore College would be maintained in Governors Corner. It is also
possible that a four-class residence, in addition to Okada, Casa Zapata, and Ujamaa, would be established somewhere other than in Wilbur, Stern, or Florence
Moore. If so, it would be established with a "critical mass" of freshmen.
The last element of our plan entails a thorough redesign of the Housing Draw, in order to establish a simpler seniority system that better allocates the pre
mier spaces created in the housing system. We will also seek additional safeguards to prevent "gaming the system" and to create a greater sense of fairness
and equity across the entire student body.
The kinds of plans envisioned here are significant in many ways, and clearly affect both a number of long-standing traditions as well as the nature of the post
for some Resident Fellows. Such things have changed before, and they will change again; this has been Stanford's way. Branner Hall, for instance, was for
decades a four-class women's dormitory, and Wilbur Hall opened as a men's dormitory. Change is hard. It is in and of itself neither good nor bad. We seek a
stronger residences program in order to build a stronger Stanford, and as a capstone to the remarkable achievements of the past decade in Undergraduate
Education. Over the ensuing months and yes, years, we look forward to a full and vigorous discussion of these ideas.

Improving Undergraduate Housing at Stanford
The University has been examining the proper relationship between residential programs, undergraduate education, and the system of housing assignments
since before it established the Residential Education program in the late 1960'5. More recently, in 1997, a formal review of housing was launched by then
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, Ramon Saldfvar. The Task Force on Residential Programs and Student Housing, co-chaired by Vice Provost
Saldfvar and former Vice Provost for Student Affairs James Montoya, forwarded the following recommendations to the University's leadership:
• Increase the number of all-frosh houses and enhance the academic programs therein;
• Create a "premier year" in the housing assignment draw and simplify the room selection process;
• Enhance academic support structures and think about different support levels for upper class houses;
• Create a freshman-sophomore residential cluster.
Although progress has been made toward these goals, we now have a convergence of resources and opportunities that will allow us to accomplish them more
fully and to address many other issues with our housing system.
What follows here is neither a final description of a plan, nor a detailed roadmap for its implementation. We expect this plan to evolve and to be phased in
over the next two to six years or longer. We are at the beginning of a long period of study, deliberation, and analysis, and there will be no opportunity for even
initial implementation in the 2005—2006 academic year. While there has already been much discussion and number crunching, some of which leads rather
inexorably to certain conclusions, there is much to be done.
Although our thinking about the future of undergraduate housing has been expansive, there are several characteristics of our current programs to which we
have absolute commitment. This is Stanford University; we are not attempting to be anyone else. With its support for and augmentation of the academic
mission of the University, its emphasis on community, service, and citizenship, and its essential role in providing personal support for all students, preemi
nence in Residential Education remains our key objective. We not only affirm, but celebrate, our resolute commitment to a variety of academic, ethnic, and
programmatic theme houses, to multiple opportunities for student leadership and service, and to a coupling of living, learning, advising, and mentoring.
Indeed, we have begun these discussions in large part because of our desire to invigorate further the totality of the residential experience at Stanford.
When the Munger Graduate Residences are completed, the 360 beds of Crothers and Crothers Memorial Halls will become available for undergraduate hous
ing. Coupled with the planned construction of one additional dorm in the Manzanita Park area and three additional row houses (or, alternatively, two addi
tional dorms) we now have within our grasp the long-sought opportunity to "un-stuff" mini-doubles, triples, and quads across the campus. But at the core
of the ambitious plan we have envisioned is the larger opportunity to examine the entire system of housing and re-conceptualize our current housing stock
to achieve (1) a more balanced freshman housing experience, (2) a superior upper-class experience marked by a guarantee of a generally escalating quality
of housing over the course of a student's time at Stanford, and (3) a restoration of academic program spaces to the residences. These three goals, joined by
the goals of un-stuffing the housing system and rationalizing The Draw, have been the impetus for our thinking.
Beyond the conversion of Crothers and Crothers Memorials for undergraduates, another element of our plan would have us convert the four largest and most
elegant undergraduate residence halls to upper-class use. With significantly lowered occupancies, these halls would be highly attractive within the Draw. It
is only through the combination of (1) these four conversions, (2) the conversion of Crothers and Crothers Memorial, and (3) the construction of approxi
mately 300 new bed spaces that we can simultaneously achieve our goals of both un-stuffing the system and providing an escalating quality of rooms for our
upperclassmen. To the extent that we do not implement these conversions, the number of new bed spaces needed to achieve our goals would grow beyond
our likely fundraising ability. As it is, raising the funds to construct 300 additional bed spaces would be a challenging task.
Thus, in an admitted break from the recent past, Branner, Toyon, Roble, and Lagunita would become three-class residences with no first year students, and
the three-room quads, two-room triples, and mini-doubles found in these complexes would be down-rated to double or single occupancies. One can easily
imagine, for instance, that a current Roble quad comprising two sleeping rooms and a common space between, which is currently used for four freshmen,
