# Forum relates Asian history to today
## 
### BONNIE SWIFT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On February 19, 1942, President
Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Exec
utive Order 9066 and with the
stroke of his pen incarcerated
120,(XM) Japanese Americans.
In recognition of the signing of
Executive Order 9066, a number of
student groups have organized an
event at 7:30 p.m. in Cubberly Audi
torium entitled "From 9066 to 9/11:
Community and Identity in Wartime
America." The event will also ad
dress the post-Sept. 11 detainment of
many Americans Middle Eastern
and South Asian descent. ,
Cultural and Social Anthropolo
gy Prof. Purnima Mankekar, chair
of the Asian American Studies Pro
gram, said. "It is most important
that we revisit the history of World
War II and connect events in the
past with what has happened in the
United States since September 11."
Speakers at the forum will in
clude Kiku Funabiki, who will share
her experience of being sent with
her family to an internment camp in
Heart Mountain, Wyoming.
Her husband. Wallace Funabiki.
was one of more than a dozen Stan
ford students of Japanese descent
who were taken from their studies
at the University and held for sever
al years in custody without charges.
None of those Japanese-American
students returned to Stanford to
complete their degrees, according
to Cindy Ng, the director of the
Asian American Activities Center.

"We wanted to include speakers
who could give us a variety of per
spectives about what happened
then, as well as perspectives on re
cent events," Mankekar said.
Participants include those with
backgrounds in law, academia and
community activism. Several have
first-hand experiences of the events
to be discussed.

There will be a performance by
Noopur, a Stanford South Asian
dance troupe, and Stanford's Asian
American Theatre Project will per
form an excerpt from their play,
"12-1-A," by Wakako Yamuchi.
The idea for the event came
from a Sept. 16 article in the San
Francisco Chronicle, in which Fred
Korematsu, who was detained in a

Japanese internment camp from
1942 to 1945, responded to claims
made by Fox News media personal
ity Michelle Malkin.
According to the article, Malkin
said that "some* Japanese Ameri
cans were spies during WWII and
that racial profiling of Arab Ameri
cans today is justified by the need to
fight terrorism."
However, in the 1980s a federal
commission found that "no Japanese
American had been involved in espi
onage or sabotage and that no military
necessity existed to imprison them."
Korematsu argued in the San
Francisco Chronicle that the cur
rent treatment of suspected terror
ists in the United States is equally
unjustified.
"We need voices speaking out to
prevent the violation of civil liber
ties," Ng said. Although the detain
ment and deportation happening
today in the United States is not on
the same scale as those of 1942, Ng
pointed out that current incarcera
tion may be more common than be
lieved because many are taking
place secretly.
"If one minority is harmed, all
groups are affected," Mankekarsaid.
More than 30 groups on campus
have come together to sponsor the
event.
The organizers said they hope
that those who attend the forum
will learn that building coalitions
across communities, rather than
within communities, is an essential
ingredient to protecting civil liber
ties.

The idea for the event came
from a Sept. 16 article in the San
Francisco Chronicle, in which Fred
Korematsu, who was detained in a

Japanese internment camp from
1942 to 1945, responded to claims
made by Fox News media personal
ity Michelle Malkin.
According to the article, Malkin
said that "some* Japanese Ameri
cans were spies during WWII and
that racial profiling of Arab Ameri
cans today is justified by the need to
fight terrorism."
However, in the 1980s a federal
commission found that "no Japanese
American had been involved in espi
onage or sabotage and that no military
necessity existed to imprison them."
Korematsu argued in the San
Francisco Chronicle that the cur
rent treatment of suspected terror
ists in the United States is equally
unjustified.
"We need voices speaking out to
prevent the violation of civil liber
ties," Ng said. Although the detain
ment and deportation happening
today in the United States is not on
the same scale as those of 1942, Ng
pointed out that current incarcera
tion may be more common than be
lieved because many are taking
place secretly.
"If one minority is harmed, all
groups are affected," Mankekarsaid.
More than 30 groups on campus
have come together to sponsor the
event.
The organizers said they hope
that those who attend the forum
will learn that building coalitions
across communities, rather than
within communities, is an essential
ingredient to protecting civil liber
ties.
