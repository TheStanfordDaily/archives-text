## Real News and BCSC host talk on state of Black America 
### NILA BALA STAFF WRITER 
"Progress is what's in this room.
Regression is what's not — that's the
simple answer," said Harvard I .aw
Prof. Charles Ogletree last night dur
ing a discussion regarding the state of
the black community. The event was
sponsored by The Real News, the old
est African-American student publi
cation at Stanford.
In light of the 50th year anniver
sary of the Brown v. Board of Educa
tion case, a seven-member panel
came together at the Law School to
discuss the theme "Progress or
Regress," moderated by Jan Baker-
Alexander, assistant dean of students
and director of the Black Community
Service Center.
The panel first looked at the issue
of integration, which a few of the
speakers, including Ogletree, said
they believed had not produced its in
tended results.
"The irony of Brown is that we're
more segregated now than 50 years
ago and the law tolerates it,"he said.
"The reason integration didn't suc
ceed is because after Brown, the
whites lied, followed by the black
middle class. All that was left was the
urban sprawl that we still see today."
I lowever, Stanford alumnus Regi
nald Turner, chief executive officer of
Momentum Management, took a
more optimistic view of the effects of
integration.
"As I look around this room and
this University, integration — in con
cept — has worked," he said. "An ex
amination of what life would be like
really provides the answer for
whether integration has been success
ful."
Broadening the discussion,
Yetunde Reeves, assistant principal
of McClymonds High School in
West Oakland, conveyed her expe
riences of working with her students
to reflect on whether the success of
Brown.
"Kids at McClymonds think their
situation is normal," Reeves said. "I
took them to the East side of Oak
land and they were shocked to see
the opportunities afforded to those
students: AP classes, electives and
other benefits. It's nice to see all
these people in the room, but you're
not mentoring and helping these
kids. We have to move beyond just
talking."
Reeves's comment moved the
panel toward a heated discussion of
the "ivory tower" mentality, and
whether such panels were even useful.
Opinions varied.
"When we sit here and discuss the
mindset of black people, we are mak
ing a mistake," lie said. "We are a
people, but also individuals and we

cannot allow society or our race to in
sist on a mindset."
While many of the questions led
to a discussion of abstract issues sur
rounding Brown v. Board of Educa
tion. panel members discussed how
to fix problems faced by the black
community.
Eva Paterson, president of the
Equal Justice Society, called attention
to the need to pool resources and
make race a political issue.
"Black people together would
make the seventh largest economy,"
she said. "We also need to put race
back on the national agenda. People
run from it and don't want to talk
about it."
Many panel members stressed that
Stanford students are in a unique po
sition to deal with the situation.
"You have to take advantage of
all the opportunities at Stanford."
said William McNeill, the managing
attorney for the Legal Aid Society-
Employment Law Center. "The nice
thing about this group of people is
that you might be able to fix these

problems."
While "many students said they
were very pleased with the event
and the issues it addressed, some
said they felt that the discussion was
too theoretical and would have liked
to hear more about what they could
do to help.
"It's important to have a panel
like this with open dialogue and
people from different disciplines,"
senior Dee Savery said. "The prob
lem. though, is that we don't have
people taking us to a new level and
really getting at the forefront of this
fight."
While viewing the event as a suc
cess, senior Khalilah Karim. one of
the managing editors of The Real
News, saw it as a beginning for fur
ther conversation.
"I was very pleased with the
turnout." she said. "The questions
were definitely not broad enough to
expose all the issues, but it got us
thinking, and gave us kernels to
take back to the community. It's a
starting point."
