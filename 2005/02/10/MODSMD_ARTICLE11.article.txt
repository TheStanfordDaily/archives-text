"Progress is what's in this room.
Regression is what's not — that's the
simple answer," said Harvard I .aw
Prof. Charles Ogletree last night dur
ing a discussion regarding the state of
the black community. The event was
sponsored by The Real News, the old
est African-American student publi
cation at Stanford.
In light of the 50th year anniver
sary of the Brown v. Board of Educa
tion case, a seven-member panel
came together at the Law School to
discuss the theme "Progress or
Regress," moderated by Jan Baker-
Alexander, assistant dean of students
and director of the Black Community
Service Center.
The panel first looked at the issue
of integration, which a few of the
speakers, including Ogletree, said
they believed had not produced its in
tended results.
"The irony of Brown is that we're
more segregated now than 50 years
ago and the law tolerates it,"he said.
"The reason integration didn't suc
ceed is because after Brown, the
whites lied, followed by the black
middle class. All that was left was the
urban sprawl that we still see today."
I lowever, Stanford alumnus Regi
nald Turner, chief executive officer of
Momentum Management, took a
more optimistic view of the effects of
integration.
"As I look around this room and
this University, integration — in con
cept — has worked," he said. "An ex
amination of what life would be like
really provides the answer for
whether integration has been success
ful."
Broadening the discussion,
Yetunde Reeves, assistant principal
of McClymonds High School in
West Oakland, conveyed her expe
riences of working with her students
