## Everything you always wanted to know about sex but can't ask 
### 
Like many renowned institutions
of higher learning, Stanford is often
accused of being overly theoretical
and intellectually elitist in its course
offerings. When it comes to sex educa
tion. however, the University is not
academic enough.
Stanford has not offered an intro
ductory human sexuality course since
the days of Hum Bio 10. better known
as Hum Sex. Started by Dr. Herant
Katchadourian in 1971. the course has
since then become an academic leg
end akin to Dr. William Dement's
Sleep and Dreams.
Known for its superb teaching, ca
sual tone and colorful PowerPoint
slides of STD symptoms, Hum Sex

fully embraced the
"facts not judg
ment" philosophy
of sex education.
It covered a va
riety of topics rang
ing lrom the details
of reproductive bi
ology to the social
meaning of gen
der, sexual identity

and behavior.
Most importantly, Hum Sex empow
ered students with a solid base of
knowledge to make their own choices
about sex.
After Katchadourian's retirement,
Hum Sex continued for one more year
and was taught by the visiting British
neuroanatomist Simon LeVay. Un
fortunately, 2(X)3 marked the 32nd
and final year of Hum Sex at Stanford.
We desperately need Hum Sex
back. Despite the pervasive "Stanford
students are too dorky to care about
sex" stereotype, I dare you to find one
student on this campus who doesn't
have an ounce of interest in the sub
ject. Sex is too fundamental to our na
ture to be ignored.
"Sexuality is an intrinsically biolog
ical phenomenon that we all have to
deal with," said senior Monica Sircar,
a former teaching assistant for Hum-
Sex. "We also have to deal with its so
cial. cultural and political ramifica
tions. There is enough of an incentive
for everyone to be taking Hum Sex."
The Sexual Health Peer Resource
Center is a great resource for peer
counseling and free condoms, but I
wouldn't go there to discuss the find
ings of the Kinsey report or the neuro
biology of multiple orgasms. Other
sex-related courses such as Humßio's
"Sexuality in Adolescence" or Sociol
ogy's "Sex and Love in Modern Soci
ety" emphasize narrower aspects of
sexuality and are not meant to be an
introduction to the field.
The sociology class concentrates
strictly on the social aspects of sexual
ity, such as interpersonal relation
ships. but leaves out the biological
foundations of sex. And although the
Humßio class does address sexual
physiology, its focus on a particular
age group imposes certain limitations
to students' perspectives.
The gap in the Stanford curriculum
is hardly due to diminishing student
demand. During the post-HumSex
years, enrollment in the student
taught SHPRC class has skyrocketed,
reflecting students' keen interest.
After all. there is a reason why this
year the I-HUM program deviated
from its traditional Socrates-Plato-
Aristotle approach fora course titled
"Sex: Its Pleasures and Cultures."
The more likely reason for the ab
sence of an introductory human sexu
ality class is that no one at Stanford
seems to be willing or able to teach it.
Katchadourian and LeVay may have
left big shoes to fill, but 1 doubt that a
university as prestigious as Stanford
would find it impossible to attract an
other top-notch sexuality expert.
Almost every secular college in the
country offers survey courses on
human sexuality — but not Stanford.
This obvious academic void hurts
both students' college experience and
the academic reputation of our school.
Students will only benefit if we
bring one of Stanford's most interest
ing and valuable classes back to life.
With an interdisciplinary effort on be
half of the University. Hum Sex could
be resurrected.
And with the "fulfills GER 4C"
label at the bottom of the syllabus. I
wouldn't be surprised to see students
camping out in the Main Quad to se
cure a spot in "Human Sexuality 2:
The Birds and the Bees Strike Back."

The Sexual Health Peer Resource
Center is a great resource for peer
counseling and free condoms, but I
wouldn't go there to discuss the find
ings of the Kinsey report or the neuro
biology of multiple orgasms. Other
sex-related courses such as Humßio's
"Sexuality in Adolescence" or Sociol
ogy's "Sex and Love in Modern Soci
ety" emphasize narrower aspects of
sexuality and are not meant to be an
introduction to the field.
The sociology class concentrates
strictly on the social aspects of sexual
ity, such as interpersonal relation
ships. but leaves out the biological
foundations of sex. And although the
Humßio class does address sexual
physiology, its focus on a particular
age group imposes certain limitations
to students' perspectives.
The gap in the Stanford curriculum
is hardly due to diminishing student
demand. During the post-HumSex
years, enrollment in the student
taught SHPRC class has skyrocketed,
reflecting students' keen interest.
After all. there is a reason why this
year the I-HUM program deviated
from its traditional Socrates-Plato-
Aristotle approach fora course titled
"Sex: Its Pleasures and Cultures."
The more likely reason for the ab

seems to be willing or able to teach it.
Katchadourian and LeVay may have
left big shoes to fill, but 1 doubt that a
university as prestigious as Stanford
would find it impossible to attract an

Almost every secular college in the
country offers survey courses on
human sexuality — but not Stanford.
This obvious academic void hurts
both students' college experience and
the academic reputation of our school.

Like many renowned institutions
of higher learning, Stanford is often
accused of being overly theoretical
and intellectually elitist in its course
offerings. When it comes to sex educa
tion. however, the University is not
academic enough.
Stanford has not offered an intro
ductory human sexuality course since
the days of Hum Bio 10. better known
as Hum Sex. Started by Dr. Herant
Katchadourian in 1971. the course has
since then become an academic leg
end akin to Dr. William Dement's
Sleep and Dreams.
Known for its superb teaching, ca
sual tone and colorful PowerPoint
slides of STD symptoms, Hum Sex

fully embraced the
"facts not judg
ment" philosophy
of sex education.
It covered a va
riety of topics rang
ing lrom the details
of reproductive bi
ology to the social
meaning of gen
der, sexual identity

and behavior.
Most importantly, Hum Sex empow
ered students with a solid base of
knowledge to make their own choices
about sex.
After Katchadourian's retirement,
Hum Sex continued for one more year
and was taught by the visiting British
neuroanatomist Simon LeVay. Un
fortunately, 2(X)3 marked the 32nd
and final year of Hum Sex at Stanford.
We desperately need Hum Sex
back. Despite the pervasive "Stanford
students are too dorky to care about
sex" stereotype, I dare you to find one
student on this campus who doesn't
have an ounce of interest in the sub
ject. Sex is too fundamental to our na
ture to be ignored.
"Sexuality is an intrinsically biolog
ical phenomenon that we all have to
deal with," said senior Monica Sircar,
a former teaching assistant for Hum-
Sex. "We also have to deal with its so
cial. cultural and political ramifica
tions. There is enough of an incentive
for everyone to be taking Hum Sex."
