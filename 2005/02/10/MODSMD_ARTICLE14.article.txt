# Growing Big and Strong:
## Are we loading our bodies with unnecessary supplements? 
### JESSICA LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At any time of day, there is bound to be a
bevy of fitness-conscious people working out
at the Arrillaga Weight Room or at Tresidder
Fitness Center. In addition to cardio ma
chines, free weights and weight machines,
many of these people may also be using prod
ucts outside of the weight room — sports sup
plements.
There are a variety of sports supplements
on the market, from those that claim to in
crease muscle mass and weight to those that
advertise enhanced athletic activity. They in
clude products that range from Gatorade and
Powerßars, sold at the local convenience
store, to creatine, which can be found at nutri
tional stores such as GNC.
But some question whether these sports
supplements are truly helpful, or even
healthy, for students and athletes.
An Unhealthy Dietary Addition?
Pat Kearny, a dietician and sports medicine
specialist at the Menlo Medical Clinic and at
the University's Behavioral Medicine Clinic,
said she believes that athletes should not reg
ularly use any sports supplements unless they
has particular dietary requirements.
"Athletes who do not have special needs
should not be using protein bars or shakes reg
ularly after or before their workouts," Kearny
said. "These supplements are processed
foods, which are high trans-fat acids and satu
rated fats and lack many nutrients."
"An athlete who has just worked out in a
gym can get more nutrients from eating half a
peanut butter sandwich after their workout
than eating a protein bar," she added. "All
they should eat is normal food and, at most,
have a bar or shake occasionally."
Still there are many students on campus
who believe that taking sports supplements
will help them meet their athletic goals.
Peter Porcino, a freshman who works out
regularly in the weight room, said that he usu
ally eats a Power Bar after a workout at the
gym.
"1 consistently eat Powerßars because I
need the extra protein," Porcino said. "I'm
vegetarian, so this is one way of balancing my
diet." 9
"The protein bars and shakes are very pop
ular with many guys who go to the weight
room regularly like me," he added. "I person
ally don't use shakes, but many guys I know
who work out as well use them."

Sports Supplements on Campus
Although many students use sports supple
ments to gain weight or increase muscle mass,
others use them to enhance athletic ability.
"Usually, the people who take supple
ments are ones who feel they can't get enough
protein in their diet or want to gain weight to
help them with their sport," said Tara Cogh
lin-Dickson, sports nutritionist at the Stanford
Sports Medicine Program.
She said she believes that Stanford athletes
mostly use only the sports supplements avail
able at local grocery stores. These include pro
tein and energy bars such as Go-Lean and
Powerßar and energy drinks such as Red Bull.
"A very small percentage, I'd say maybe
one percent, uses drugs such as creatine,"
Coghlin-Dickson said.
Creatine, an amino acid that functions as a
protein supplement, is believed by some to
quicken recovery from weight-lifting and help
increase speed in athletic activities.
Though creatine is not an artificial supple
ment — the body makes its own creatine in the
liver, kidneys and pancreas, and it is present in
many red meats — it still has some minor
known side effects. According to the Mayo
Clinic, a non-profit organization that provides
medical information to the public-, excess
amounts of creatine can cause stomachaches,
muscle cramps and diarrhea.

"Some athletes respond to creatine's posi
tive effects and some don't," Coghlin-Dickson
said. "Thus, supplements like this are not that
reliable for their effects. Most athletes just
take protein supplements such as protein bars,
shakes or powder."
However, not all sports athletes whose
sports emphasize weight training use supple
ments on a regular basis.
Molly Tokaz, a freshman on the crew team,
said that she has seen only some use of protein
bars among her fellow teammates, despite the
fact that crew is a "lightweight sport."
"To my knowledge, sports supplements are
not used on my crew team except for protein
bars, which only some people eat before prac
tice," she said.
Supplementing in Moderation
Coghlin-Dickson said that supplements
such as protein bars, shakes and powders do
not have the harmful and illegal nature of the
steroids that top professional players have
been known to take.
In contrast to Kearny's warning against
regular consumption of sports supplements,
Coghlin-Dickson said that protein bars were
not harmful if taken in moderation.
"An 'overdose' of protein bars, such as
having two instead of one after a workout
is nothing to be worried too much about,"

she said.
"Most protein bars and energy drinks are
well balanced in terms of nutrition. The
shakes have not just protein, but also carbo
hydrates, electrolytes and vitamins as well,"
she added.
Coghlin-Dickson also warned that though
these supplements are not harmful by nature,
they may have side effects, if taken in large
quantities, that an athlete would not want.
"If someone depends solely on protein
supplements for their dietary needs, these
supplements can be detrimental, resulting in
an unhealthy diet," she said. "Also, this per
son may gain a lot of weight that he or she does
not necessarily want."
But protein supplements are not the only
supplements athletes use.
"Athletes don't only take protein supple
ments, but vitamins and calcium supplements,
as well, to balance their diet," Coghlin-Dick
son said. "Here at Sports Medicine, we en
courage them to look at their needs and eat a
balanced healthy diet."
Protein vs. Energy Drinks
Protein also comes in powder form, which
can be mixed to create a liquid shake. And
other drinks such as Red Bull claim to provide
energy to maintain athletic activity.
"Protein powder, which is used to make a
shake, is popular because it is less expensive to
buy than a shake," Porcino said.
"Shakes are more expensive and are more
trendy and upscale. Many people use them
though, because they believe that protein bars
cannot be digested quickly enough," he
added.
Though many companies advertise energy
drinks as providing athletic benefits, many
students consume the drinks for academic rea
sons.
"1 don't use energy drinks to enhance my
workout, and neither do many guys 1 know
who also lift weights," Porcino said. "I think
energy drinks are used more as study supple
ments, rather than sports supplements. They
are like caffeine, whose main purpose is to
keep you awake."
Kearny said she believes that energy drinks
are not necessary unless an athlete needs them
for endurance.
"Energy drinks also lack vital nutrients
that can be obtained through normal food."
Kearny says. "An athlete should not use them
fora workout that is less than an hour and a
half."
