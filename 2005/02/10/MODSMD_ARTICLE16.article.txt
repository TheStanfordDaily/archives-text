# Spam on the increase, despite new law
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Everyone receives pesky e-mails that promote products that will en
large various body parts or giveaways that are just too good to he true. But
junk e-mail, popularly known as "spam," is not merely a nuisance but a

major burden on America's productivity, according to a recent
report issued by the Stanford Center for the Quantitative

Study of Society.

Released in December, the study surveyed the
Internet habits of more than SJKX) people and
concluded that regular Internet-users waste

an average of 10 full workdays dealing
with spam each year. Political Science

Prof. Norman Nie, who spearheaded
the study, said he believes that only a
major restructuring of Windows €

software will stem the flow of spam
Hut a major anti-spam activist
group disagrees, arguing that only
strong legislation will deter spam
mers.

Recent legal efforts, however,
have had little success curbing the .
problem. The Can Spam Act, ,
which went into effect in January
2(H)4. forced spammers to label the
messages they send and to allow re
cipients to "opt out" of the mass
mailings.

Yet, since the law was enacted,
spam has grown from around 50 to as
much as 80 percent of total e-mails sent

according to John Mozena, spokesperson
for the Coalition Against Unsolicited Com
mercial Email, an ad-hoc volunteer organization.

Many states — including California, whose 2003
statute estimated spam-related losses at $1.2 billion in

the state alone — have enacted their own anti-spam legisla
tion.

Some private companies have taken matters into their own hands, fil
ing lawsuits against spam rings that have infiltrated their customer and em
ployee networks. Microsoft is at the forefront of this crusade: it has filed
nine such lawsuits.
Most recently, 21-year-old Levon Gillespie was ordered by a Washing
ton state court to pay Microsoft $1.4 million. Gillespie's company was ac-

cused of avoiding U.S. anti-spam laws by using servers in China and other
countries to send the unsolicited e-mails worldwide.
Nie said that after conducting the study, he is convinced that neither
legislative nor private efforts will ever make a serious dent in spam net
works.

"It's a problem of the design of Windows, more than (legal| enforce
ment," he said. "Given the architecture [of Microsoft Win-

dows], anyone in a garage in Sri Lanka or wherever" can
mass-distribute spam.

He likened Microsoft's anti-spam lawsuits to
patching a dam.

"If it is interested in these 10 days of
lost productivity per year, Microsoft

needs to build a new architecture, so
that it looks more like Unix," Nie
said, referring to software designed,
he believes, to better control the

How of spam.
Some anti-spam crusaders
find Nie's proposal unrealistic.

Mozena said, "Spam is not a
technical problem, it's a social
problem, and you can't fix a so
cial problem with technical
tools."

He likened Nie's proposal
to failed Vietnam War tactics of
"destroying a village in order to

save it.
"E-mail was designed fora
c A a.: i 4 .'al-

tar more trusting environment with
the goal of getting the messages to
their intended recipients," Mozena said.

Not only would changing the struc
ture of e-mail upset this basic goal, hut it

would require a sweeping reorganization of e
mail systems, going far beyond Microsoft, he

added.
Mozena said that his group maintains that strong, en-

forceable legislation is the only way to combat spam. One of the
board members of his organization is also a leader of Microsoft's anti
spam campaign.
The number and ingenuity of spammers has made technical solutions
infeasible. Mozena added.
"Everything that has been deployed in terms of anti-spam technology,
there has been counter technology from spammers," he said.

software will stem the flow of spam
Hut a major anti-spam activist
group disagrees, arguing that only
strong legislation will deter spam
mers.

Recent legal efforts, however,
have had little success curbing the .
problem. The Can Spam Act, ,
which went into effect in January
2(H)4. forced spammers to label the
messages they send and to allow re
cipients to "opt out" of the mass
mailings.

Yet, since the law was enacted,
spam has grown from around 50 to as
much as 80 percent of total e-mails sent

according to John Mozena, spokesperson
for the Coalition Against Unsolicited Com
mercial Email, an ad-hoc volunteer organization.

Many states — including California, whose 2003
statute estimated spam-related losses at $1.2 billion in

the state alone — have enacted their own anti-spam legisla
tion.

Some private companies have taken matters into their own hands, fil
ing lawsuits against spam rings that have infiltrated their customer and em
ployee networks. Microsoft is at the forefront of this crusade: it has filed
nine such lawsuits.
Most recently, 21-year-old Levon Gillespie was ordered by a Washing
ton state court to pay Microsoft $1.4 million. Gillespie's company was ac-

cused of avoiding U.S. anti-spam laws by using servers in China and other
countries to send the unsolicited e-mails worldwide.
Nie said that after conducting the study, he is convinced that neither
legislative nor private efforts will ever make a serious dent in spam net
works.

"It's a problem of the design of Windows, more than (legal| enforce
ment," he said. "Given the architecture [of Microsoft Win-

dows], anyone in a garage in Sri Lanka or wherever" can
mass-distribute spam.

He likened Microsoft's anti-spam lawsuits to
patching a dam.

"If it is interested in these 10 days of
lost productivity per year, Microsoft

needs to build a new architecture, so
that it looks more like Unix," Nie
said, referring to software designed,
he believes, to better control the

How of spam.
Some anti-spam crusaders
find Nie's proposal unrealistic.

Mozena said, "Spam is not a
technical problem, it's a social
problem, and you can't fix a so
cial problem with technical
tools."

He likened Nie's proposal
to failed Vietnam War tactics of
"destroying a village in order to

save it.
"E-mail was designed fora
c A a.: i 4 .'al-

tar more trusting environment with
the goal of getting the messages to
their intended recipients," Mozena said.

Not only would changing the struc
ture of e-mail upset this basic goal, hut it

would require a sweeping reorganization of e
mail systems, going far beyond Microsoft, he

added.
Mozena said that his group maintains that strong, en-

forceable legislation is the only way to combat spam. One of the
board members of his organization is also a leader of Microsoft's anti
spam campaign.
The number and ingenuity of spammers has made technical solutions
infeasible. Mozena added.
"Everything that has been deployed in terms of anti-spam technology,
there has been counter technology from spammers," he said.
