# Credit union battles identity theft with Passmark
## 
### SARAH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
To combat climbing rates of
identity and personal information
theft, the Stanford Federal Credit
Union, or SFCU, recently adopted
the software program Passmark,
which assigns online bankers images
and phrases before they log in to
their accounts.
If an online SFCU user does not
go to the bank's Web site and does
not see the correct icon, he or she
will know that the Web site is likely
a fake. Every user is assigned a
unique "passmark."
"When you log on, you see a pic
ture and a pass phrase at random,"
said Sam Tuohey, vice president of
e-commerce and technology for the
SFCU. "If you think that's fine, you
can do that. Otherwise, you can up
load your own picture or browse the
images online."
Passmark is one of many new
software programs designed to pre
vent online spoofing and phishing,
two of the most common techniques
used by Internet thieves. Spoofed or
phishing e-mails appear to be sent
by popular vendors or banks and di
rect recipients to Web sites that ask
them to input account numbers,
passwords or credit card numbers.
According to Tuohey, a billion
such e-mails have been sent out over
the last five years, and in November
alone there were over 1,500 active
phishing Web sites reported.
The Passmark system already has
25,000 users, he added.
Tuohey also pointed out that a
user's passmark is not a secret like a
password, but rather is used as feed
back for users, allowing them to con
firm the validity of the Web site.
"I could tell you my passmark

right now, and there's nothing you
can do with that," he said.
However, the system's imple
mentation was not seamless. The
first day after Passmark went into ef
fect, the SFCU fielded 400 phone
calls from puzzled users. Yet after
Passmark's online directions were
revised the next day, the number of
calls fell to 15.
"It's all about communication,"
Tuohey said, noting that the pro
gram is counterintuitive to the logic
users have been taught to use on the
Internet. "Users are used to having
to re-enter information over and
over again. For passmark, they just
have to notice it. Once people un
derstood that, they didn't have any
problems."
SFCU chose the Passmark sys
tem because it is compatible with
any browser, relatively simple and
because the company that created
Passmark is local.
Computer Science Profs. John
Mitchell and Dan Boneh have come
up with a different type of anti
phishing software called Spoof-
Guard. This software is not connect
ed to a single Web site, but rather
appears as a toolbar used in con
junction with Internet Explorer to
monitor whether or not a Web site is
a fake.
Other banks have considered pro
viding their customers with a small
card that randomly generates num
bers to be checked against the same
number sequence on the real site.
However, this system is costly and re
quires increased support personnel.
Whatever the method, Tuohey
said he believes that using anti
phishing software is a precautionary
step all banks and many other Web
sites must take to protect their users
from scams.
