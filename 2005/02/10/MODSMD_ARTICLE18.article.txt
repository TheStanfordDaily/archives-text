### FRANCIE NEUKOM 
Three Graduate Student Council members dis
cussed their plans at last night's meeting to lobby
for tax reform to benefit graduate students during
their impending trip to Washington D.C.
Tom Lee. a graduate student in electrical engi
neering. law student and Daily reporter Jenny
Allen and Marcus Folch, a classics graduate stu
dent, will head to Congress to advocate for tax in
centives for graduate education, including a de
duction in student-loan interest rates and an in
crease in the income limit students may reach
while still benefiting from tax deductions.
The group will lobby to raise the limits for edu
cation IRAs — tax-advantaged savings accounts
that benefit graduates and undergraduates —
from $2,000 to $5,000. Additionally, the GSC
members will argue that room and board should be
written off as qualified educational expenses for
tax purposes.

Before the trip, the three-student envoy will
meet at UC Davis with other like-minded groups
from California schools to prepare for their ap
pearance on the Hill.
The GSC also discussed the Munger graduate
housing project. Members said the administra
tion will be substituting more expensive residen
tial space for cheaper housing in Crothers Hall.
Engineering students expressed concerns that
they would lose housing priority, and the GSC
made plans to form a committee to address the
problem.
GSC members also discussed the distribution of
the new Caltrain "Go Pass" stickers for free train
rides lor graduate students who live off-campus.
They reported that Caltrain had given out about
400 of the stickers to the GSC and the rate of stu
dent sign-ups were about what was expected. Still,
the GSC will soon have a committee meeting with
Caltrain to review the sales and decide if the stick
ers are worth the expense.
