# ASSU takes on faculty diversity

### JENNY BAER 
The ASSU organized a meeting of faculty, admin
istrators and students yesterday at lunchtime to ad
dress faculty diversity —or lack thereof —and to
brainstorm ways to make the teaching ranks more
representative of minorities and women.
Lawrence Neeley, a graduate student in mechani
cal engineering, posed the pivotal question: "Why is
there a lack of diverse faculty at this University if we
know that there are qualified people out there? Why
do students of color who are capable of pursuing fac
ulty careers choose not to?"
One reason is financial, said University President
John Hennessy, who attended the meeting.
"An academic career is the best career in the world
for the right person," he said. "But you clearly make
a financial sacrifice. They are life-long, demanding ca-

reers. I can't even remember the last time I worked a
40-hour week."
Donielle Newell, a graduate student at the School
of Education, cited persistent structural failures.
"There aren't enough students of color in gradu
ate student programs to become faculty," she said.
"But unless you have a diverse faculty, students
won't have the motivation to enter the graduate
programs."
Women are underrepresented in the faculty posi
tions as well, especially in science- and engineering
related fields, the panelists acknowledged.
"Chemistry is the poster child for undergraduate
leakage of women," Hennessy said.
Women account for just 36 percent of the total
graduate student population, and only one female

tion, according to those who spoke
at the meeting.
Stanford is a "hostile environment
for parents, especially single mothers
with children," said a female staff
member in the audience.
Those who spoke also acknowl
edged that the cost of full-time
child care is prohibitive for some
low-income female workers at the

University.
The participants outlined three im
portant goals for the University: to as
sist and improve faculty applicant
pools for minorities; to retain diverse
faculty members;and to Ux>k at strate
gies to improve the pipeline of minor
ity and female graduate students ap
plying for faculty positions.
English Prof. Paula Moya warned
that bias has not disappeared com
pletely.
"We operate with unconscious
and conscious biases where we do
and don't see certain kinds of things
in certain kinds of students," she
said, asking that students play an ac
tive role in changing current stan
dards. "We cannot confine this con
versation to ourselves and we can
not let it go."
