The ASSU organized a meeting of faculty, admin
istrators and students yesterday at lunchtime to ad
dress faculty diversity —or lack thereof —and to
brainstorm ways to make the teaching ranks more
representative of minorities and women.
Lawrence Neeley, a graduate student in mechani
cal engineering, posed the pivotal question: "Why is
there a lack of diverse faculty at this University if we
know that there are qualified people out there? Why
do students of color who are capable of pursuing fac
ulty careers choose not to?"
One reason is financial, said University President
John Hennessy, who attended the meeting.
"An academic career is the best career in the world
for the right person," he said. "But you clearly make
a financial sacrifice. They are life-long, demanding ca-

reers. I can't even remember the last time I worked a
40-hour week."
Donielle Newell, a graduate student at the School
of Education, cited persistent structural failures.
"There aren't enough students of color in gradu
ate student programs to become faculty," she said.
"But unless you have a diverse faculty, students
won't have the motivation to enter the graduate
programs."
Women are underrepresented in the faculty posi
tions as well, especially in science- and engineering
related fields, the panelists acknowledged.
"Chemistry is the poster child for undergraduate
leakage of women," Hennessy said.
Women account for just 36 percent of the total
graduate student population, and only one female
