## Editorial Don't let aid efforts dwindle 
### 
In the past month, Stanford students have joined
the rest of the world in an effort to aid victims of last
December's tsunami disaster. However, students
must not let their generosity wane as news coverage
fades and instead be vigilant enough to look beyond
"the crisis of the moment,"
The recent Dance Marathon — whose proceeds
went to AIDS organizations — and tsunami fundrais
ing efforts exemplified the giving nature of Stanford
students and our ability to mobilize ourselves cre
atively fora cause. Such efforts — which have includ
ed bake sales, performances and even homemade cal
endars featuring scantily clad frosh — are noble and
noteworthy, demonstrating a refreshing concern for
those outside "the bubble."
However, part of the reason these events have
drawn such attention is that they are unusual on
campus. It almost seems that we pay the most atten
tion when we feel compelled to do so by ghastly
newspaper headlines and photographs, rather than
sustaining our efforts over a long period of time. If
we truly want to do our best to make a difference,
we must remember that diseases and natural disas
ters have repercussions that cannot be addressed
with a single donation.
There are countless issues that demand our atten
tion. "The Crisis in Darfur," a talk given by the am
bassador from Sudan on Feb. I, was a perfect example
of an effort hy the Muslim Student Awareness Net
work to bring a neglected issue to the attention of
Stanford students. As many state and national news
papers have reported, the problem in Sudan has esca
lated — but it's also taken a backseat to other issues
that dominate the headlines.
In addition, there are numerous diseases that may
have been eradicated in the United States but still
plague countries around the world. There may not be
as many posters or movies about the thousands who
die from tuberculosis and malaria each year as there

are about AIDS victim, but that doesn't make the suf
fering from the diseases any less real.
It will be difficult to put into practice with our busy
schedules, but we must become involved on a regular
basis. While thousand-dollar donations to Southeast
Asia are wonderful, those of us who cannot write a
check for large sums have the power to donate $10 for
long-term treatment for tuberculosis and stop the
spread of an unnecessary disease. Instead of thinking
of "Sudan" and "Darfur" as buzzwords you keep
meaning to look up, attend a lecture on the issue.
And we can continue to volunteer. The large num
bers of volunteers, after the South Asian tsunami dis
aster, have forced organizations such as the Red Cross
to turn away service offers and encourage people to
donate money instead. But centers and groups for
hunger and homelessness still sorely lack in both
funds and manpower. Although it may seem more
pressing and appealing to spend time rebuilding a vic
tim's home in Southeast Asia, it is important to re
member that we can do the same fora homeless per
son right here in the Bay Area.
The true question is not whether we have the ca
pacity to care, but whether our concern can be sus
tained. It is obvious that we have the right intent, but
perhaps the direction needs to be refocused. For now,
those who want to contribute to the tsunami efforts
are asked only to send money, but there will most like
ly be opportunities to volunteer in the future. In the
meantime, we can direct our spirit of volunteerism to
ward other causes where a few dollars and hours of
your time will go just as far — or even farther — than
they would in Southeast Asia right now.
It is great to contribute what we can to a cause, and
even better if the contribution is sustained. In the
wake of disasters, natural and unnatural, we must
have the courage and compassion to change the things
we can and not just whatever crisis dominates the
headlines.
