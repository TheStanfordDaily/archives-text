# Writing in the Margins
## Feeling oppressed by small margins 
### 
I'm buying a different edition of
"King Lear" tomorrow. The window
for returns must be over, but refund
or not. I won't be forced to work with
in this prison. The Signet "King Lear"
is so claustrophobic that I do not
know where to set down my pen. The
editors probably thrust the words to
gether so that they could shove a
mound of critical essays at the back of
the book. "King Lear" ends after 140

pages, but the book continues fora couple years.
I'm sure that Sylvan Barnet and all the other schol
ars whose papers are added for my intellectual en
lightenment are intelligent and insightful. But I want
to be intelligent and insightful. 1 want to pen my own
critical response to "King Lear" on its pages. I have
this amazing power to work magic with my margina
lia. And this edition of "King Lear" refuses to let me
wave my wand.
My marginalia is really quite incredible. It adds layers
of meaning to the work that I am reading, and adds hours
of enjoyment to any long, boring, incoherent work of phi
losophy (that's you, Plato!). Like any good Stanford stu
dent, I know when to back up my claims, so I have pre
pared for you, my devoted followers, the best of my
marginalia from the works of Plato.
"Isn't this whole thing kind of, like, a really big char
acter issue?" (Apology. 27c)
"Socrates is such a conservative hippie!" (C'rito, 50c)
"So. Aristodemus is not really uninvited?" (Sympo
sium. 174e)
"Love is the most beautiful because he fits the ped

erastic ideal. See you at the gym!" (Symposium, 195b)
"Ewww! Socratic method!" (Symposium. 199 c)
"Gross!" (Symposium, I We)
"Socrates is such an asshole." (Symposium, 201 c)
"W IT?" (Republic, Book 11. 364b)
"It's as though Wal-Mart read Republic." (Republic,
Book 111, 387 c)
"St), basically Plato's saying he's AMAZING." (Re
public, Book VI. 4^4b)
As I have just proven, my marginalia is a vital source
of information. If nothing else, it reminds me where I
have read closely and where I have "skimmed." There
was a time when I did not write in my books. There was a
time when 1 wouldn't even flag or dog-ear pages. That
time is long past. I feel no attachment to the book as an
object, and I rail against any man who tries to make it dif
ficult for me to defile the virgin purity of my overpriced
paperbacks.
The idea that books shouldn't be beautiful objects is
one shared by my greatest benefactor. Stanford Uni
versity. The other day. I had the pleasure of exploring
the Rare Books collection at Green. 1 touched a 14th
century manuscript of Dante's "Inferno" and got far
too close to Plato than I should be allowed to (There's
a restraining order. Plato doesn't like how 1 treat
Socrates). If Stanford is willing to let me touch priceless
books, then Signet should produce copies of "King
Lear" that leave vast pastures for me to make my mark
on the play. I'm going to find a less oppressive publish
ing house tomorrow.
