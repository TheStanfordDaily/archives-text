Stanford community should demand im
mediate investment disclosure
We applaud the ASSU for recognizing
student concern about investment disclosure
and for taking the crucial first step toward
community oversight of the investment of
Stanford's endowment. We also commend
The Daily's editorial hoard for highlighting
the importance of transparency and account
ability in "Trustees should heed call for in
vestment transparency" (Feb. 4).
However, we would like to more firmly
recommend a push for full disclosure to af
ford students and other community mem
bers true investment oversight rather than
nominal involvement. As current students
and as alumni, we are ambassadors bearing
Stanford's name. We want not to be apolo
gists for an institution of privilege driven
only by profit at the expense of social good,
but rather to be proud representatives of an
institution that is, to quote the editorial
board, "held to high standards of ethical be
havior, given that the University as a com

munity of scholars is committed to improv
ing humanity."
While we recognize the responsibility of
the University's Board of Trustees to ensure
financial security and institutional sustain
ability. we do not agree with the editorial
board's assertion that disclosure is prema
ture. Ethics cannot wait, and while the Board
of Trustees is not charged with running a
"charitable organization," nor is it charged
with running a corporation. Stanford is, after
all, a nonprofit.
As an institution with national visibility.
Stanford has the opportunity to set an ethical
precedent in the academic community. How
ever, student, faculty and alumni support are
crucial for the success of this movement. We
invite all interested parties to sign the Stan
ford Coalition for Investment Disclosure's
online petitions in order to express the com
munity's commitment to ethical behavior
and to call upon the Board of Trustees to
promptly address the issue of disclosure. To

Letter writers missed sarcasm
Editor's note: Selena Simmons-l>uffin
and Jessica Schaffer first responded to
Niek tram's column "Schoolfor the (lift
ed" (Jan. 26) in their letter "The small
people thank Nick Fram" (Jan. 2N). A/nit
Patel wrote a letter on l : eb. I to criticize
Schaffer and Simmons-Duff in ("Letter
from the 'small people' is racist and in
sensitive").
Since the sarcasm of our letter to the edi
tor critiquing the pretentious tone and
elitism of Niek Fram's article apparently es
caped some Daily readers. Jess and I felt it

was our duty to explain our purpose in writ
ing the letter.
We were not attempting to mock diffi
cult lives similar to those described in the
letter, nor were we making a general, ran
dom. stereotypical portrayal of a Hispanic
by signing the letter Juan Doe — when one
speaks of day laborers in California, the im
plication is race, and we were playing off of
this statement in the original article to
make that point. The sarcasm of the letter
was, we thought, obvious and absurd
enough that it wouldn't be confused with
making a parody of real people and their
situations.
Our initial reasons for writing the article
still stand. First of all, the assumption that
those who got rejected from Stanford are
trudging through a lesser life is completely
absurd. It is well documented that Stanford's
admissions pool overlaps with schools of
equal caliber.
There is no reason why we, as Stanford
students and alumni, should feel that if we do
not succeed we have failed society. The idea

that destinies of hunger, cancer and
bankruptcy is "for other people, not you" im
plies that Stanford students are not only
guaranteed financial success, hut are im
mune from disease. Obviously, this is not the
case.
We were not arguing that social respon
sibility shouldn't exist, trying to be racist or
insensitive or saying that you shouldn't be
thankful for the opportunity to go to Stan
ford. Nick Fram no doubt was reminding us
to consider our good fortune in being here,
and I'm sure he had good intentions. But in
all fairness, writing an article about how
gifted the students here are and how inferi
or those who don't have the good fortune to
be here is unfair and ridiculous.
Amit Patel should know better than to
play around with words with such serious im
plications as the ones used against us in his
letter. I hope he finds a less confrontational
way to relay his opinions in the future.

still stand. First of all, the assumption that
those who got rejected from Stanford are
trudging through a lesser life is completely
absurd. It is well documented that Stanford's
admissions pool overlaps with schools of
equal caliber.
There is no reason why we, as Stanford
students and alumni, should feel that if we do
not succeed we have failed society. The idea

that destinies of hunger, cancer and
bankruptcy is "for other people, not you" im
plies that Stanford students are not only
guaranteed financial success, hut are im
mune from disease. Obviously, this is not the
case.
We were not arguing that social respon
sibility shouldn't exist, trying to be racist or
insensitive or saying that you shouldn't be
thankful for the opportunity to go to Stan
ford. Nick Fram no doubt was reminding us
to consider our good fortune in being here,
and I'm sure he had good intentions. But in
all fairness, writing an article about how
gifted the students here are and how inferi
or those who don't have the good fortune to
be here is unfair and ridiculous.
Amit Patel should know better than to
play around with words with such serious im
plications as the ones used against us in his
letter. I hope he finds a less confrontational
way to relay his opinions in the future.

Stanford community should demand im
mediate investment disclosure
We applaud the ASSU for recognizing
student concern about investment disclosure
and for taking the crucial first step toward
community oversight of the investment of
Stanford's endowment. We also commend
The Daily's editorial hoard for highlighting
the importance of transparency and account
ability in "Trustees should heed call for in
vestment transparency" (Feb. 4).
However, we would like to more firmly
recommend a push for full disclosure to af
ford students and other community mem
bers true investment oversight rather than
nominal involvement. As current students
and as alumni, we are ambassadors bearing
Stanford's name. We want not to be apolo
gists for an institution of privilege driven
only by profit at the expense of social good,
but rather to be proud representatives of an
institution that is, to quote the editorial
board, "held to high standards of ethical be
havior, given that the University as a com

munity of scholars is committed to improv
ing humanity."
While we recognize the responsibility of
the University's Board of Trustees to ensure
financial security and institutional sustain
ability. we do not agree with the editorial
board's assertion that disclosure is prema
ture. Ethics cannot wait, and while the Board
of Trustees is not charged with running a
"charitable organization," nor is it charged
with running a corporation. Stanford is, after
all, a nonprofit.
As an institution with national visibility.
Stanford has the opportunity to set an ethical
precedent in the academic community. How
ever, student, faculty and alumni support are
crucial for the success of this movement. We
invite all interested parties to sign the Stan
ford Coalition for Investment Disclosure's
online petitions in order to express the com
munity's commitment to ethical behavior
and to call upon the Board of Trustees to
promptly address the issue of disclosure. To

Letter writers missed sarcasm
Editor's note: Selena Simmons-l>uffin
and Jessica Schaffer first responded to
Niek tram's column "Schoolfor the (lift
ed" (Jan. 26) in their letter "The small
people thank Nick Fram" (Jan. 2N). A/nit
Patel wrote a letter on l : eb. I to criticize
Schaffer and Simmons-Duff in ("Letter
from the 'small people' is racist and in
sensitive").
Since the sarcasm of our letter to the edi
tor critiquing the pretentious tone and
elitism of Niek Fram's article apparently es
caped some Daily readers. Jess and I felt it

was our duty to explain our purpose in writ
ing the letter.
We were not attempting to mock diffi
cult lives similar to those described in the
letter, nor were we making a general, ran
dom. stereotypical portrayal of a Hispanic
by signing the letter Juan Doe — when one
speaks of day laborers in California, the im
plication is race, and we were playing off of
this statement in the original article to
make that point. The sarcasm of the letter
was, we thought, obvious and absurd
enough that it wouldn't be confused with
making a parody of real people and their
situations.
Our initial reasons for writing the article
still stand. First of all, the assumption that
those who got rejected from Stanford are
trudging through a lesser life is completely
absurd. It is well documented that Stanford's
admissions pool overlaps with schools of
equal caliber.
