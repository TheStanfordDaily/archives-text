# Let it be
## Bread is the new milk 
### 
I cringed when 1 heard about the
campaign that began last week to con
vince people that bread is healthy.
Enough of the milk mustaches: now
we'll have the bread heard.
The Grain Foods Foundation is
putting $4 million into a "public edu
cation" campaign to counteract re
cent doughy bread sales. One foun
dation member. Interstate Bakeries

Corporation, said
that low-carbo
hydrate diets
were a major rea
son it filed for
Chapter 11
bankruptcy last
year. Wheat Hour
consumption is
down from 147
pounds per per
son in 1997 to 136

pounds in 2(H)3. and bread consump
tion has been falling for years.
But breadmakers hope their ad
campaign will help sales rise like
bread dough after it's been punched
down.
Starting this month, advertise
ments are going up in New York and
Washington. D.C.. on the Internet,
in grocery stores and even in doc
tors' offices and fitness clubs. The
ads' tagline, "Bread, it's essential,"
prompted a rye, er. wry comment by
Michael Jacobson, the executive di
rector for the Center of Science in
the Public Interest. "I didn't know
bread was essential," he said. "A bil
lion people in China must be horri
bly deprived."
Indeed, the campaign is truthful,
but not completely unleavened. One
ad reads, "Whole grain foods help
stop hunger." That is true, though
other foods might help stop hunger
with fewer calories. Another ad reads,
"A balanced diet that includes grains
helps to prevent cataracts." Yet the
research supporting this claim fails to
distinguish what aspects of the bal
anced diet actually prevent cataracts.
(Chances are, it's not the grains.) A
third ad reads, "Your brain needs car
bohydrates to function properly," but
neglects to mention that carbohy
drates are available from non-bread
foods like fruits and vegetables.
Indeed, people lived without
bread for the majority of human his
tory. and started eating bread only
within the past few thousand years.
The bread industry isn't the first
to knead science into advertise
ments. For decades, all kinds of food
manufacturers have been feeding

the public advertisements in ihe
guise of health information.
Prominent among these "public
education" schemes was the $190
million milk mustache ad campaign,
which sought to reverse public con
cern about milk being fattening or
only for children. The now-famous
celebrity ads spoke of milk's nutri
tional content (nine essential vita
mins and minerals), the low-fat con
lent of skim milk and, most memo
rably, milk's supposed benefits for
bone strength. Milk was touted as a
good source of calcium, vitamin B
-12, riboflavin and, ironically, water.
When disguised as public health
education, even illogical and invalidat
ed reasons like these strongly influ
ence consumers. After the campaign
started, milk sales rose one billion
pounds, or 4 percent, in just one year.
Then the Physicians for Respon
sible Medicine filed a petition accus
ing the milk industry of false adver
tising. The federal panel that con
vened in response found that indeed,
many of the campaign's claims were
misleading.
Although the ads said that milk
enhanced sports performance, the
panel found that "there are are no
data to support the belief that milk
per se benefits sports performance."
Moreover, the panel found that
dairy food intake has not reliably
been linked to bone health.
In fact, milk consumption is actu
ally correlated with higher rates of
osteoporosis. Dairy consumption
doubled in Hong Kong between
1966 and 1989, and osteoporosis
rates tripled. The Japanese, who drink
about one-third as much milk as Amer
icans. have osteoporosis two-and-half
times less often. Among Americans,
those who drink the least milk (such as
Mexican- and African-Americans)
have lower osteoporosis rates. And the
correlation might be more than an arti
fact: protein like that in milk can con
tribute to osteoporosis by causing in
creased excretion of calcium in urine.
So bread and milk might not be as
healthy as their producers would have
us think. However, advertisers' goal
isn't public health — it's selling more
of their products. The real shame is
that the public gets so many advertise
ments in the sheep's clothing of health
education. A diet of processed food
advice is bad for our health.

about one-third as much milk as Amer
icans. have osteoporosis two-and-half
times less often. Among Americans,
those who drink the least milk (such as
Mexican- and African-Americans)
have lower osteoporosis rates. And the
correlation might be more than an arti
fact: protein like that in milk can con
tribute to osteoporosis by causing in
creased excretion of calcium in urine.
So bread and milk might not be as
healthy as their producers would have
us think. However, advertisers' goal
isn't public health — it's selling more
of their products. The real shame is
that the public gets so many advertise
ments in the sheep's clothing of health
education. A diet of processed food
advice is bad for our health.

I cringed when 1 heard about the
campaign that began last week to con
vince people that bread is healthy.
Enough of the milk mustaches: now
we'll have the bread heard.
The Grain Foods Foundation is
putting $4 million into a "public edu
cation" campaign to counteract re
cent doughy bread sales. One foun
dation member. Interstate Bakeries

Corporation, said
that low-carbo
hydrate diets
were a major rea
son it filed for
Chapter 11
bankruptcy last
year. Wheat Hour
consumption is
down from 147
pounds per per
son in 1997 to 136

pounds in 2(H)3. and bread consump
tion has been falling for years.
But breadmakers hope their ad
campaign will help sales rise like
bread dough after it's been punched
down.
Starting this month, advertise
ments are going up in New York and
Washington. D.C.. on the Internet,
in grocery stores and even in doc
tors' offices and fitness clubs. The
ads' tagline, "Bread, it's essential,"
prompted a rye, er. wry comment by
Michael Jacobson, the executive di
rector for the Center of Science in
the Public Interest. "I didn't know
bread was essential," he said. "A bil
lion people in China must be horri
bly deprived."
Indeed, the campaign is truthful,
but not completely unleavened. One
ad reads, "Whole grain foods help
stop hunger." That is true, though
other foods might help stop hunger
with fewer calories. Another ad reads,
"A balanced diet that includes grains
helps to prevent cataracts." Yet the
research supporting this claim fails to
distinguish what aspects of the bal
anced diet actually prevent cataracts.
(Chances are, it's not the grains.) A
third ad reads, "Your brain needs car
bohydrates to function properly," but
neglects to mention that carbohy
drates are available from non-bread
foods like fruits and vegetables.
Indeed, people lived without
bread for the majority of human his
tory. and started eating bread only
within the past few thousand years.
The bread industry isn't the first
to knead science into advertise
ments. For decades, all kinds of food
manufacturers have been feeding

the public advertisements in ihe
guise of health information.
Prominent among these "public
education" schemes was the $190
million milk mustache ad campaign,
which sought to reverse public con
cern about milk being fattening or
only for children. The now-famous
celebrity ads spoke of milk's nutri
tional content (nine essential vita
mins and minerals), the low-fat con
lent of skim milk and, most memo
rably, milk's supposed benefits for
bone strength. Milk was touted as a
good source of calcium, vitamin B
-12, riboflavin and, ironically, water.
When disguised as public health
education, even illogical and invalidat
ed reasons like these strongly influ
ence consumers. After the campaign
started, milk sales rose one billion
pounds, or 4 percent, in just one year.
Then the Physicians for Respon
sible Medicine filed a petition accus
ing the milk industry of false adver
tising. The federal panel that con
vened in response found that indeed,
many of the campaign's claims were
misleading.
Although the ads said that milk
enhanced sports performance, the
panel found that "there are are no
data to support the belief that milk
per se benefits sports performance."
Moreover, the panel found that
dairy food intake has not reliably
been linked to bone health.
In fact, milk consumption is actu
ally correlated with higher rates of
osteoporosis. Dairy consumption
doubled in Hong Kong between
1966 and 1989, and osteoporosis
rates tripled. The Japanese, who drink
about one-third as much milk as Amer
icans. have osteoporosis two-and-half
times less often. Among Americans,
those who drink the least milk (such as
Mexican- and African-Americans)
have lower osteoporosis rates. And the

tribute to osteoporosis by causing in
creased excretion of calcium in urine.
