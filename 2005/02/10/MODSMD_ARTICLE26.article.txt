## The
						Double Clutch Joy of sports TV threatened by Irish, inane fluff 
### 
It's getting really hard to turn on the TV these
days. Every time I want to check a score. 1 get
inundated with "Original Programming,"
shouting shows and all sorts of entertainment
Hull that seems designed to alienate me, the reg
ular sports fan. Witness:
Perp No. 1: Notre Dame Football on NBC
Let me disclaim the following section by say
ing that though 1 have little love for Notre Dame,
1 am not out to make more enemies after last
month's Trojan Band kerfuffle. 1 am, however,
going to tell it like it is. The truth is that Notre
Dame's approach to the growing coffers of col-

lege sports is, "Gimme it. it's
mine!"
The Fighting Irish have
elected to remain without a
conference affiliation in the
biggest money sport of foot
ball and have also bullied their
way to a favored position in the
Bowl Championship Series
system. In case you were won
derinu. their only BCS bowl

appearance was a 32-point loss to Oregon State.
But OSU shared the $12 million payout with the
rest of the Pac-10, while Notre Dame dragged the
entire bag of booty home to South Bend.
Why? Because they're Notre Dame.
They also have an exclusive deal with NBC
(NDC: Notre Dame Company?) to broadcast
every home game.
And that may ironically be the program's un
doing.
In a classic rob-Peter-to-pay-Paul situation,
Notre Dame must schedule tough year in and
year out to keep its personal TV contract, leading
to an abnormally high ratio of might-win games
to should-win games. With the greater parity of
modern college football, this is as much a reason
as anything else for the program's recent decline.
That said, if you want to watch your team play
Notre Dame in Soutli Bend, you will be forced to
turn on NBC and watch a four-hour advertise
ment for the school, complete with homer an
nouncers and Victory March bumper music.
The Fighting Irish earned the wrath of the
sports world when they tossed aside Tyrone
Willingham after three seasons. Ty had not ex
actly lit northern Indiana on fire, going 6-5 last
season, but he ran the program with the dignity
and class that we at Stanford were familiar with.
The Notre Dame brass struggled toexplain how
they could bag a guy with a record comparable
to the previous coach â€” who got five full years.
(I m also still waiting for an explanation for run
ning a fake punt against Stanford in 2003, when
Notre Dame was up by 50 points, but I doubt it
is forthcoming.)
Soon the rest of the college football world will
realize that Notre Dame needs them more than
they need Notre Dame, and the game will be bet
ter for it
Perp No. 2: Fox Sports
In a classic case of life imitating art. the Fox
