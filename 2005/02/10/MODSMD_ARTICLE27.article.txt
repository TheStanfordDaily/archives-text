# Card aim for Pac-10 sweep at Cal
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ever since November, the coaches and athletes of the women's
swim team have been working toward one thing and one thing
only. With six dual meet wins, a single preseason loss and some
spectacular performances under its belt. No. 5 Stanford is focused
on March 17. when the national champion will be crowned.
Not that the rest of the season does not matter to the Cardinal,
who will swim against No. 10 California on Saturday in the last dual
meet of the Pacilic-10 Conference season. With its only loss com
ing toTexas in the preseasthi, the Cardinal kx>k to be in good shape
to sweep the Pac-10 season.
Though finishing undefeated in conference competition would
be a great confidence booster heading into the postseason, only
two results will ultimately matter: the Pac-10 Championships in
two weeks and the NCAA Championships following that. Having
failed to crack the top three in the last two years, the team wants to
swim well when it faces national favorites Georgia and Auburn
next month.
"We will keep training as we get ready for NCAAs and Pac
-10s," head coach Richard Quick said. "And along the way we are
competing against Cal. We will swim to win it, but we won't inter
rupt our plans to prepare for the end of the season."
"We're not doing anything special for Cal," senior Lacey
Boutwell said. "We're sticking to our training regiment because
the end of the season is more important for as, and the Pac-10s and
NCAAs are the main goal."
The Bears should challenge Stanford to post fast times. When
these two teams met last year. Cal stunned the Cardinal with a 151-

149 victory, breaking a Stanford head-to-head winning streak dat
ing to 1976. The parity between the two teams was again evident at
the national championship meet in which the Cardinal edged Cal
by 1.5 points to place fifth overall.
"We definitely have a rivalry in swimming with Cal," Boutwell
said, 'it's a bit of a pride issue, after they beat lis last year, so we're
going to definitely get them back. We're training hard, trying to
mentally prepare for them, not let our guard down and be ready for
them."
The Golden Bears pose the greatest threat in the backstroke
and freestyle events, where they are led by the sister tandem of
Helen and Emily Silver. In the dual meets against No. 18 USC and

No. 11 UCLA two weeks ago, the two combined for nine individ
ual victories. Four other Cal swimmers and the freestyle relay team
also contributed wins in sweeping the weekend.
"They are a very gotxl team, and it will be an exciting meet,"
Quick said. "Like us, they're a very balanced team."
Though the Golden Bears will be tough opponents, Stanford
swimmers say they are confident about their own depth and talent.
"I think we have got enough talent on our team to win." fresh
man backstroker Brtx>ke Bishop said. "We are going to need ev
eryone to step up this weekend, and if we can do that, then it will

end well, and we should get a win over
them."
Stanford will lixik to add to its list of
national qualifying times in the final dual

meet of the season.
Already, the squad has tallied 30 "B"
qualifying times which are good enough
to be considered when determining the
national championship field, and four
"A" times, which guarantee a spot in the
championship. Iliree of the"A" times
came courtesy of freshman phenom Car
oline Bruce, in the 1(X)- and 200-yard
breaststrokc and the 200-vard individual

medley. Against UCL.A two weeks ago,
Bruce posted the fourth fastest time in
the nation in the 200-yard distance.
Sophomore Lauren Costella scored the
team's only other "A" time in the 1650-
yard freestyle last month.
Ideally, more swimmers will be able
to reach the"A" plateau this weekend
before the Pac-10 Championships in two
weeks. Nonetheless, the team members

are happy with the way they have been
training recently and hope to reach their
peak at the NCAA (Tiampionships.
"We're resting a little bit more now,"
Bishop added. 1 think everyone is ex
pecting to swim a lot faster."
In the diving pool, the Cardinal will
face a relatively inexperienced three-per
son squad: two freshmen and a senior
who was a national champion gymnast

before switching to diving last year. The
meet will be a good opportunity to focus
on establishing consistency and fine-tun
ing before the National Diving Champi
onships in four weeks.
Senior Ashlee Rosenthal and sopho
more Cassidy Krug have already quali
fied for NCAAs in both the one-meter
and three-meter springboard. The other
divers try to join them as double-quali

fiers if t hey can post the minimum scores
against Cal.
With the end of the season on the
horizon, the Stanford athletes are exactly
where they want to be.
"Everyone is looking great,"
Boutwell said. "We're starting the taper
ing aspect of our season so we're chang
ing things a little bit. So far everything is
looking really, really good."

onships in four weeks.
Senior Ashlee Rosenthal and sopho
more Cassidy Krug have already quali
fied for NCAAs in both the one-meter
and three-meter springboard. The other
divers try to join them as double-quali

fiers if t hey can post the minimum scores
against Cal.
With the end of the season on the
horizon, the Stanford athletes are exactly
where they want to be.
"Everyone is looking great,"
Boutwell said. "We're starting the taper
ing aspect of our season so we're chang
ing things a little bit. So far everything is
looking really, really good."
Ever since November, the coaches and athletes of the women's
swim team have been working toward one thing and one thing
only. With six dual meet wins, a single preseason loss and some
spectacular performances under its belt. No. 5 Stanford is focused
on March 17. when the national champion will be crowned.
Not that the rest of the season does not matter to the Cardinal,
who will swim against No. 10 California on Saturday in the last dual
meet of the Pacilic-10 Conference season. With its only loss com
ing toTexas in the preseasthi, the Cardinal kx>k to be in good shape
to sweep the Pac-10 season.
Though finishing undefeated in conference competition would
be a great confidence booster heading into the postseason, only
two results will ultimately matter: the Pac-10 Championships in
two weeks and the NCAA Championships following that. Having
failed to crack the top three in the last two years, the team wants to
swim well when it faces national favorites Georgia and Auburn
next month.
"We will keep training as we get ready for NCAAs and Pac
-10s," head coach Richard Quick said. "And along the way we are
competing against Cal. We will swim to win it, but we won't inter
rupt our plans to prepare for the end of the season."
"We're not doing anything special for Cal," senior Lacey
Boutwell said. "We're sticking to our training regiment because
the end of the season is more important for as, and the Pac-10s and
NCAAs are the main goal."
The Bears should challenge Stanford to post fast times. When
these two teams met last year. Cal stunned the Cardinal with a 151-

149 victory, breaking a Stanford head-to-head winning streak dat
ing to 1976. The parity between the two teams was again evident at
the national championship meet in which the Cardinal edged Cal
by 1.5 points to place fifth overall.
"We definitely have a rivalry in swimming with Cal," Boutwell
said, 'it's a bit of a pride issue, after they beat lis last year, so we're
going to definitely get them back. We're training hard, trying to
mentally prepare for them, not let our guard down and be ready for
them."
The Golden Bears pose the greatest threat in the backstroke
and freestyle events, where they are led by the sister tandem of
Helen and Emily Silver. In the dual meets against No. 18 USC and

No. 11 UCLA two weeks ago, the two combined for nine individ
ual victories. Four other Cal swimmers and the freestyle relay team
also contributed wins in sweeping the weekend.
"They are a very gotxl team, and it will be an exciting meet,"
Quick said. "Like us, they're a very balanced team."
Though the Golden Bears will be tough opponents, Stanford
swimmers say they are confident about their own depth and talent.
"I think we have got enough talent on our team to win." fresh
man backstroker Brtx>ke Bishop said. "We are going to need ev
eryone to step up this weekend, and if we can do that, then it will

end well, and we should get a win over
them."
Stanford will lixik to add to its list of
national qualifying times in the final dual

meet of the season.
Already, the squad has tallied 30 "B"
qualifying times which are good enough
to be considered when determining the
national championship field, and four
"A" times, which guarantee a spot in the
championship. Iliree of the"A" times
came courtesy of freshman phenom Car
oline Bruce, in the 1(X)- and 200-yard
breaststrokc and the 200-vard individual

medley. Against UCL.A two weeks ago,
Bruce posted the fourth fastest time in
the nation in the 200-yard distance.
Sophomore Lauren Costella scored the
team's only other "A" time in the 1650-
yard freestyle last month.
Ideally, more swimmers will be able
to reach the"A" plateau this weekend
before the Pac-10 Championships in two
weeks. Nonetheless, the team members

are happy with the way they have been
training recently and hope to reach their
peak at the NCAA (Tiampionships.
"We're resting a little bit more now,"
Bishop added. 1 think everyone is ex
pecting to swim a lot faster."
In the diving pool, the Cardinal will
face a relatively inexperienced three-per
son squad: two freshmen and a senior
who was a national champion gymnast

before switching to diving last year. The
meet will be a good opportunity to focus
on establishing consistency and fine-tun
ing before the National Diving Champi
onships in four weeks.
