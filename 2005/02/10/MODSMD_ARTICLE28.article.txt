### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Without giving up so much as a single set, the No. 7
Stanford men's tennis team (4-0) blanked St. Mary's
on Tuesday afternoon to remain undefeated in dual
matches this season. While the Cardinal increased
their win streak to four, the Gaels dropped to 2-5.
The men dominated again, sweeping all of the dou
bles matches for the third consecutive dual. The No. 2
doubles duo of senior Sam Warburg and junior KC
Corkery made quick work of the Gaels' Adam Fauvre
and J.j. Whitlinger, Stanford head coach John
Whitlinger's son. in an 8-2 victory.
"KC and Sam are playing as well as anybody,"
Whitlinger said. "I'd put them up against anybody in
the country right now; they're playing that well. It was
nice to see my son play out there against them."
At the No. 3 position, junior Jon Wong and sopho
more James Wan notched a win. 8-2. At the second
doubles position, senior Phil Sheng and sophomore
Eric McKean were down a break but recovered and
tallied an 8-5 victory.
"I think we have a lot to work on in terms of team
work." Sheng said. "I think we're two really good play
ers, but we're still trying to get used to playing with
each other."
Following a dominating performance in doubles,
singles play began, during which one spectator com
mented, "This isn't a match; it's a massacre." Indeed,
the Cardinal started and finished strong.
Warburg was in his element, and the Gaels' Martin
Marechal had no time to get into a rhvthin. Marechal

threw his hands up in the air and shrugged his shoul
ders a few times during the match, as if he was unsure
of what to do. On match point, the Gael came into the
net, only to be passed by a crosscourt forehand winner.
Warburg walked away victorious with a score of 6-0,6-
0.
Playing at the third singles position for the first time
this season. Sheng was the next match off the court.
The senior won 6-1,6-1, using an impressive display of
powerful forehands and aggressive volleys to finish off
points.
"I've been trying to be aggressive the whole year."
Sheng said. "It's something I've been working on. and
I definitely think I've been doing that, especially today
and the past couple matches. Confidence wise, (I've]
never felt better; it's my best start in four years. We
have a tough couple matches coming up, and hopeful
ly 1 can keep winning."
Whitlinger acknowledged Sheng's success and also
said he hopes that the run will continue.
"Phil's doing well," Whitlinger said. "It's great to
see. I keep telling him. This is going to be your year.'
Hopefully he believes that."
Corkery made quick work of his opponent in the
third match completed. After winning the first set 6-3,
Corkery served out the first game of the next set with
an ace and proceeded to victory, 6-3.6-3, at the No. 2
singles position.

completed their respective matches. Kao was up 6-0,5-
