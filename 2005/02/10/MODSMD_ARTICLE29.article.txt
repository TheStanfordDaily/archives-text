# Team to test out NCAA track
## 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's and women's track and field teams
are parting ways once again this weekend. Coming
off of their impressive times at the Armory Invita
tional in New York City, some of the top Cardinal
runners will be competing in another high profile
meet in Fayetteville, Ark., while a second group re
turns to Seattle. Wash, for the Husky Invitational.
"The team going to Arkansas is a select group,"
men's head coach Robert Weir said.
The meet is composed of two parts: the elite col
legiate and post-collegiate Tyson Invitational on
Friday and the Collegiate Invitational on Saturday.
The Arkansas contest will be aired on ESPN2 on
the West Coast at 6 p.m. Saturday.
The Arkansas meet is especially important be
cause it is held at the same track the runners will
run on at the NCAA championships in March.
This Friday and Saturday, the Cardinal will get the
chance to test the track and get used to the facility.
The irack at Arkansas is banked, which pro
duces fast times, making it a prime location for the
2004 NCAA Indoor Track and Field Champi
onship.
Many top level Stanford athletes will be making
their indoor season debut this weekend, including
junior middle distance runner Ryan Hall, who will
compete in Arkansas.
Hall, who finished first at the cross country
NCAA West Regional Championships earlier this
year and second at the Pac-10 Championships, was
named the NCAA West Regional Athlete of the
Year. He has not raced in an indoor track meet this
season because of a slight foot strain.
"He hasn't raced in quite a while." Weir said.
"His foot has been sore. He's going to be pretty
rusty. He's just going to try to get moving."
Hall will be running the distance medley relay
on Friday at the Tyson Invitational.
"This will give him the opportunity to race with
top level competition," Weir said.
Some of that competition includes teams from
the Southeastern Conference, Big 12 Conference
and other top track-and-field universities across

the country.
Redshirt freshman middle-distance runner
Russell Brown will race both days. He will run the
DMR with Hall and an open event Saturday as a
second priority.
Redshirt freshman distance runner Neftalem
Araia will open up his season as well, running the
3.0(X)-meter run on Friday.
"Because Nef has had less interruption in his
training he will run in the Tyson, Weir said. "The
Collegiate Invitational is definitely a lighter meet
than the Tyson."
Other men traveling to Arkansas include fresh
man sprinter Wopamo Osaisai and junior thrower
Michael Robertson, who is also breaking into com
petition this season with his specialty, the discus
throw.
Among the women in Arkansas, all eyes will be
on sophomore Janice Davis. Davis will race in the
4x400-meter relay Friday and the 2(X)-meter dash
Saturday.
"It's been a while since I've raced the 2()0,"
Davis said. "I'll have to get back into the swing of
things."
Davis currently holds the fastest time in the na
tion in the 60-meter dash and placed fourth in the
200 last weekend at Armory.
"I felt really confident," Davis said, referring to
the finals of the 60-meter dash she won last Satur
day at the Millrose Games.
When asked about her goals for the season,
Davis was confident and answered without hesita
tion: "Winning the NCAA champs in the 60."
"And to make the finals in the 200," Davis
added. "I'd love to win the 200, no doubt, but I like
to take things one step at a time."
Every sprinter has a routine to pump them up
before their events, and Davis has one that builds
her confidence and prepares her mentally before
the race.
"I listen to 'Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz' right
before the race over and over," she said. "That way
when you get to the track you have it in your head.
You're ready to kill the race."
