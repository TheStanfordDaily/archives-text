# SLAC not satisfied by announcement
## Hennessy OKs labor reforms 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
University President John
Hennessy last week issued a re
sponse to a report released by the
advisory committee he created in
2003 to examine University work
place policies. He accepted all of
the recommendations — includ
ing those regarding temporary
and casual employees and con
tracted workers — but some stu
dent labor activists said they were
dissatisfied with the announce
ment.
The recommendations includ
ed the four most crucial points re
lated to workplace policies —

wage parity for temporary and ca
sual workers; educational oppor
tunities; protection of the right to
organize; and collection of data
on subcontracted and directly
hired temporary workers.
The recommendation that tem
porary and casual workers be paid
Stanford's "living wage" for con
tracted workers of $ 11.35 was ac
cepted, but with the stipulation
that it only be applied to employ
ees who work more than 20 hours
a week.
Those who work more than 20
hours will now also be compensat
ed with days off and receive ac
cess to English as a second lan
guage classes. Hennessy said that
University Human Resources will
"collect annual data on temporary
and casual employees and ensure
compliance with University poli
cies."
Hennessy formed the advisory
committee in spring 2003 after a
week-long student hunger strike
and protests organized by the
Stanford Labor Action Commit
tee and the Coalition for Labor
Justice. The 13-member Presiden
tial Advisory Committee, com
prised of students, administrators,
faculty and a SLAC representa
tive, released its 111-page report
last summer.
Diane Peck, the executive di
rector of the Office of Human Re
sources and co-chair of the advi
sory committee, said she is
pleased that Hennessy accepted
many of the recommendations
and feels optimistic for the future.
"The committee worked very
diligently fora number of months
and came up with what we be
lieved to be fair recommenda
tions," Peck said. "And I'm sure
the people charged with carrying
out the recommendations will
work very diligently."
However, not everyone was so
positive.
Senior Anna Mumford, the stu
dent and labor alliance coordina
tor for SLAC, said she is very un
happy with Hennessy's response.
"While the general tone of his
response is pro-worker, there ap
pears to be a few specific or con
crete commitments to implement
changes to current policies,"
Mumford said. "In ceneral, 1

think this is an extremely vague
and meaningless document."
Junior Joseles de la Cruz, also
in SLAC, agreed, saying that the
timeline for changes was not spe
cific enough.
"The only sort of time frame
for these proposed changes is a
reference to a report to be issued
by Human Resources in Decem
ber 2006 on the progress in meet
ing these recommendations,"
Mumford added.
Peck explained that imple
menting some of the changes will
be time-consuming.
"It depends on the changes,"
Peck pointed out. "Forming a
committee, for example, is not too
difficult. But to begin a pilot pro
gram to see if we should begin a
comprehensive career advance
ment program would be a much
more involved project."
De la Cruz said that he felt the
president has yet to show a gen
uine concern for the issue or con
crete determination to effect
changes.
"Things are too vague," de la
Cruz said of Hennessy's response.
"There's a lot of referring to
Human Resources or different de
partments. It doesn't show that
the University is committed to
this."
In the announcement last
week, Hennessy agreed to most
of the recommendations. As
such, de la Cruz recognized that
perhaps his dissatisfaction is
rooted in the advisory commit
tee's report itself.
He said the committee "didn't
go far enough" with the recom
mendations because not enough
information was available.
"I do think [the administra
tion! is headed in the right direc
tion," de la Cruz added. "They
just need to take our concerns
more seriously."

Junior Joseles de la Cruz, also
in SLAC, agreed, saying that the
timeline for changes was not spe
cific enough.
"The only sort of time frame
for these proposed changes is a
reference to a report to be issued
by Human Resources in Decem
ber 2006 on the progress in meet
ing these recommendations,"
Mumford added.
Peck explained that imple
menting some of the changes will
be time-consuming.
"It depends on the changes,"
Peck pointed out. "Forming a
committee, for example, is not too
difficult. But to begin a pilot pro
gram to see if we should begin a
comprehensive career advance
ment program would be a much
more involved project."
De la Cruz said that he felt the
president has yet to show a gen
uine concern for the issue or con
crete determination to effect
changes.
"Things are too vague," de la
Cruz said of Hennessy's response.
"There's a lot of referring to
Human Resources or different de
partments. It doesn't show that
the University is committed to
this."
In the announcement last
week, Hennessy agreed to most
of the recommendations. As
such, de la Cruz recognized that
perhaps his dissatisfaction is
rooted in the advisory commit
tee's report itself.
He said the committee "didn't
go far enough" with the recom
mendations because not enough
information was available.
"I do think [the administra
tion! is headed in the right direc
tion," de la Cruz added. "They
just need to take our concerns
more seriously."
University President John
Hennessy last week issued a re
sponse to a report released by the
advisory committee he created in
2003 to examine University work
place policies. He accepted all of
the recommendations — includ
ing those regarding temporary
and casual employees and con
tracted workers — but some stu
dent labor activists said they were
dissatisfied with the announce
ment.
The recommendations includ
ed the four most crucial points re
lated to workplace policies —

wage parity for temporary and ca
sual workers; educational oppor
tunities; protection of the right to
organize; and collection of data
on subcontracted and directly
hired temporary workers.
The recommendation that tem
porary and casual workers be paid
Stanford's "living wage" for con
tracted workers of $ 11.35 was ac
cepted, but with the stipulation
that it only be applied to employ
ees who work more than 20 hours
a week.
Those who work more than 20
hours will now also be compensat
ed with days off and receive ac
cess to English as a second lan
guage classes. Hennessy said that
University Human Resources will
"collect annual data on temporary
and casual employees and ensure
compliance with University poli
cies."
Hennessy formed the advisory
committee in spring 2003 after a
week-long student hunger strike
and protests organized by the
Stanford Labor Action Commit
tee and the Coalition for Labor
Justice. The 13-member Presiden
tial Advisory Committee, com
prised of students, administrators,
faculty and a SLAC representa
tive, released its 111-page report
last summer.
Diane Peck, the executive di
rector of the Office of Human Re
sources and co-chair of the advi
sory committee, said she is
pleased that Hennessy accepted
many of the recommendations
and feels optimistic for the future.
"The committee worked very
diligently fora number of months
and came up with what we be
lieved to be fair recommenda
tions," Peck said. "And I'm sure
the people charged with carrying
out the recommendations will
work very diligently."
However, not everyone was so
positive.
Senior Anna Mumford, the stu
dent and labor alliance coordina
tor for SLAC, said she is very un
happy with Hennessy's response.
"While the general tone of his
response is pro-worker, there ap
pears to be a few specific or con
crete commitments to implement
changes to current policies,"
Mumford said. "In ceneral, 1

think this is an extremely vague
and meaningless document."
Junior Joseles de la Cruz, also
in SLAC, agreed, saying that the
timeline for changes was not spe
cific enough.
"The only sort of time frame
for these proposed changes is a
reference to a report to be issued
by Human Resources in Decem
