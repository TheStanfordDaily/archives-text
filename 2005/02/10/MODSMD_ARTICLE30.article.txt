# Co-captain anxious to be unleashed
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Caged animal" is a phrase one might use
to describe a hockey player hanging his stick
on the glass of a penalty box or a football
player poised on the line just before a play. A
gymnast in a glittery leotard and matching
hair ribbon is certainly not the first image to
come to mind.
Those were the first words, however, that
junior captain Natalie Foley of the No. 26
women's gymnastics team used to describe
herself after sitting out the first home meet
due to a sprained ankle.
"I felt like a caged animal sitting out,"
Foley said. "It made me feel so antsy. I can't
wait to come back. 1 am now even more mo
tivated and more driven."
Maybe she got the phrase from her dad. a
former Denver Bronco who still holds the
team record in interceptions. Or maybe gym
nasts are just much more fierce and competi
tive than their facade admits.
Either way, Foley is excited to run out of
her "cage" and return to the Ail-Around this
weekend as the Cardinal hit the road to take
on No. 20 Arizona. The eight-time All-
American, who was ranked eighth in the Ail-
Around during last year's regular season,
competed in all four events at nearly every
meet last year, but has yet to do so this year.
Foley's return comes just in time.
Freshman phenom Liz Tricase, who has
been leading on the scoreboard for Stanford
in the past three meets, sprained her ankle
stretching before her beam routine at last weekend's meet
and will be unable to compete this weekend.
Foley should be able to till Tricase's place in the lineup
and will add experience and leadership as well. On an 11 -
person team with six freshmen and no seniors, that leader
ship is indispensable.
As a sophomore last year, Foley enjoyed the luxury of
having five seniors to look up to for leadership and inspira
tion. As a junior, she faces the tough challenge of leading six
freshmen with help from only two other juniors, one of
whom is injured.
"Without a lot of upperclassmen, it is definitely chal
lenging to show (the freshmen) how everything works and
what it takes to be a great team," Foley said.
"But it is also exciting because instead of seniors we have
freshmen," she continued. "There are pros and cons that
each brings. Our seniors last year brought leadership, heart,
and experience. These freshmen bring diverse talent and a
lot of excitement."
The challenge of leading freshmen without seniors has
been coupled by the challenge of coping with injuries.
Foley's co-captain, Jessica Louie, is still recovering from a
severe ankle injury that she incurred on the first day of prac
tice.
"It's hard to lead while you're injured because you're
not working right alongside your teammates," Foley said.
"But if you're working just as hard as them and you're just
as sore as them and just as tired as them ... it's easier to say
things with authority and lead by example."
Now that Foley has recovered from her injury, she has
the opportunity to once again lead by example both at prac
tice and at meets. Her leadership style mirrors that of last
year's seniors. She particularly tries to pass on what she
learned from last season's captain, Caroline Fluhrer.
"Caroline just brought such an example in the way that
she cared about everyone on the team and put every ounce
of her energy into gymnastics," Foley said. "I try to pass on
a lot of the ways that she encouraged everyone gently and
being firm when she needed to be."
Foley also brings her own ingredient into leadership: her
competitive drive to win. Although regular season colle
giate gymnastics is based on scores rather than wins and
losses, Foley just can't stand to lose. Neither can her team.
Foley said that last weekend's loss to No. 14 Central
Michigan served as a wake-up call to the team.
"It was a team we felt we shouldn't have lost to," she
said. "So we had to ask ourselves what we need to do dif
ferently. We had to realize that just because we won third at
Nationals last year, that doesn't mean we can walk into a
meet and be handed a win. We need to fight to make things
perfect, stick our landings, hit our handstands on bars, and
compete with a lot more confidence and determination
than fear."
At this weekend's meet against the Wildcats, Foley
wants the team to put those words into action. If that hap
pens. then the freshmen's talents along with Foley's leader
ship, should give the team its first win on the road.
And given Foley's competitiveness, winning is, of
course, the ultimate goal.

learned from last season's captain, Caroline Fluhrer.
"Caroline just brought such an example in the way that
she cared about everyone on the team and put every ounce
of her energy into gymnastics," Foley said. "I try to pass on
a lot of the ways that she encouraged everyone gently and
being firm when she needed to be."
Foley also brings her own ingredient into leadership: her
competitive drive to win. Although regular season colle
giate gymnastics is based on scores rather than wins and
losses, Foley just can't stand to lose. Neither can her team.
Foley said that last weekend's loss to No. 14 Central
Michigan served as a wake-up call to the team.
"It was a team we felt we shouldn't have lost to," she
said. "So we had to ask ourselves what we need to do dif
ferently. We had to realize that just because we won third at
Nationals last year, that doesn't mean we can walk into a
meet and be handed a win. We need to fight to make things
perfect, stick our landings, hit our handstands on bars, and
compete with a lot more confidence and determination
than fear."
At this weekend's meet against the Wildcats, Foley
wants the team to put those words into action. If that hap
pens. then the freshmen's talents along with Foley's leader
ship, should give the team its first win on the road.
And given Foley's competitiveness, winning is, of
course, the ultimate goal.

Freshman Liz Tricase will be out for Friday's meet at Arizona with a sprained ankle. Junior co
captain Natalie Foley will have to fill in for head coach Kristen Smyth's squad.
"Caged animal" is a phrase one might use
to describe a hockey player hanging his stick
on the glass of a penalty box or a football
player poised on the line just before a play. A
gymnast in a glittery leotard and matching
hair ribbon is certainly not the first image to
come to mind.
Those were the first words, however, that
junior captain Natalie Foley of the No. 26
women's gymnastics team used to describe
herself after sitting out the first home meet
due to a sprained ankle.
"I felt like a caged animal sitting out,"
Foley said. "It made me feel so antsy. I can't
wait to come back. 1 am now even more mo
tivated and more driven."
Maybe she got the phrase from her dad. a
former Denver Bronco who still holds the
team record in interceptions. Or maybe gym
nasts are just much more fierce and competi
tive than their facade admits.
Either way, Foley is excited to run out of
her "cage" and return to the Ail-Around this
weekend as the Cardinal hit the road to take
on No. 20 Arizona. The eight-time All-
American, who was ranked eighth in the Ail-
Around during last year's regular season,
competed in all four events at nearly every
meet last year, but has yet to do so this year.
Foley's return comes just in time.
Freshman phenom Liz Tricase, who has
been leading on the scoreboard for Stanford
in the past three meets, sprained her ankle
stretching before her beam routine at last weekend's meet
and will be unable to compete this weekend.
Foley should be able to till Tricase's place in the lineup
and will add experience and leadership as well. On an 11 -
person team with six freshmen and no seniors, that leader
ship is indispensable.
As a sophomore last year, Foley enjoyed the luxury of
having five seniors to look up to for leadership and inspira
tion. As a junior, she faces the tough challenge of leading six
freshmen with help from only two other juniors, one of
whom is injured.
"Without a lot of upperclassmen, it is definitely chal
lenging to show (the freshmen) how everything works and
what it takes to be a great team," Foley said.
"But it is also exciting because instead of seniors we have
freshmen," she continued. "There are pros and cons that
each brings. Our seniors last year brought leadership, heart,
and experience. These freshmen bring diverse talent and a
lot of excitement."
The challenge of leading freshmen without seniors has
been coupled by the challenge of coping with injuries.
Foley's co-captain, Jessica Louie, is still recovering from a
severe ankle injury that she incurred on the first day of prac
tice.
"It's hard to lead while you're injured because you're
not working right alongside your teammates," Foley said.
"But if you're working just as hard as them and you're just
as sore as them and just as tired as them ... it's easier to say
things with authority and lead by example."
Now that Foley has recovered from her injury, she has
the opportunity to once again lead by example both at prac
tice and at meets. Her leadership style mirrors that of last
year's seniors. She particularly tries to pass on what she
learned from last season's captain, Caroline Fluhrer.
"Caroline just brought such an example in the way that
she cared about everyone on the team and put every ounce
