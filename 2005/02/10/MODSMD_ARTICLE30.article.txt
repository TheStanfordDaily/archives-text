# Co-captain anxious to be unleashed

### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Caged animal" is a phrase one might use
to describe a hockey player hanging his stick
on the glass of a penalty box or a football
player poised on the line just before a play. A
gymnast in a glittery leotard and matching
hair ribbon is certainly not the first image to
come to mind.
Those were the first words, however, that
junior captain Natalie Foley of the No. 26
women's gymnastics team used to describe
herself after sitting out the first home meet
due to a sprained ankle.
"I felt like a caged animal sitting out,"
Foley said. "It made me feel so antsy. I can't
wait to come back. 1 am now even more mo
tivated and more driven."
Maybe she got the phrase from her dad. a
former Denver Bronco who still holds the
team record in interceptions. Or maybe gym
nasts are just much more fierce and competi
tive than their facade admits.
Either way, Foley is excited to run out of
her "cage" and return to the Ail-Around this
weekend as the Cardinal hit the road to take
on No. 20 Arizona. The eight-time All-
American, who was ranked eighth in the Ail-
Around during last year's regular season,
competed in all four events at nearly every
meet last year, but has yet to do so this year.
Foley's return comes just in time.
Freshman phenom Liz Tricase, who has
been leading on the scoreboard for Stanford
in the past three meets, sprained her ankle
