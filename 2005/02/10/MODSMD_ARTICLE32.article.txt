## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team notched
its second home dual win of the season
last night against Cal Poly in front of a di
verse home crowd at Burnham Pavilion.
The 23-14 victory excited everyone
that filled the stands, from hecklers to
toddlers dressed in Stanford gear. While
it was a fairly dominant performance, the
Cardinal have many aspects to improve
upon.
"I really don't think this was our best
wrestling, and I don't think we were mov
ing that well," head coach Steve Buddie
said. "When we get leads, we cannot get
tense or shut down. We need to keep
pouring it on. Even so, we kept wrestling
and we closed out wins."
Stanford (6-7-1, 2-4-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference) opened the match with senior
Nathan Peterson at 125 pounds. Peter
son was dominant throughout his bout,
nearly pinning his opponent at the end of
the first period. After fighting off a take
down at the end of the second period, Pe
terson earned a two-point takedown in
the third period to seal an 11-3 major de
cision win and four team points.
After Cal Poly (3-11, 0-5) earned a
major decision of its own at 133, 141-
pound Stanford freshman Rafael Chavez
responded. The first period of Chavez's

match against Evan Melgares was in
tensely fought, but neither competitor
could establish position for any points.
Chavez had three impressive takedowns
en route to his 5-3 victory.
The Mustangs took a brief 8-7 lead in
team points after they got another major
decision win at 149 pounds. But Stanford
senior co-captain and NCAA defending
champion Matt Gentry regained the lead
for the Cardinal with a 13-6 major deci
sion win at 157. Gentry held onto the
major decision by thwarting his oppo
nent's escape attempt and emphatically
throwing him to the floor in the waning
seconds of the third period.
The Stanford middle-weights contin
ued to build momentum as freshman Scott
Loescher won a tight 8-7 decision with the
deciding point coming from riding time.
Junior co-captain Imad Kharbush fol
lowed with a 5-1 decision over Yuri kali
ka at 174 pounds to extend Stanford's
lead to 17-8.
"Imad was the highlight of the night
for me, because he was moving the best
and he got a great win over a very solid
opponent." Buddie said.
The Mustangs forfeited at 184 pounds
to all but assure a Stanford win. Junior
Ryan Hagen decided to wrestle up a weight
class to 197 to get experience against a larg
er opponent and fell 5-2.
Stanford knows that it must put out a

better effort this weekend to be successful,
especially during the early stages of bouts.
"We need to stop coming out flat
footed, and we need to get the intensity
way up because we've started slow the
past three meets," Hagen said. "We've
started slow in the first period and by the
third period we're making comebacks
that we shouldn't have to be making. We
should be putting them away."
While there is still work to be done,
the Cardinal will gladly take their elusive
second home victory.
"The home win is great because it
shows the crowd what we've been up to."
Hagen said. "They hear about us going
out and wrestling some of the top teams
in the nation. Now. after this past week
end where we had two bad duals, we got
to show them what we can do."
Stanford hopes that the performance
was enough to get a raucous crowd to fill
up Burnham Pavilion when the Cardinal
take on rival UC-Davis (4-4-1) on Satur
day at 7 p.m.
"We're very evenly matched and
we've developed a rivalry because
they're one of the closest teams in the
Bay Area," Buddie said. "I'm glad we're
having the dual meet here. We're going
to need to wrestle well and pick up bonus
points in matches where we should win."
Saturday will be the team's alumni night
and the last home dual meet of the season.

Stanford (6-7-1, 2-4-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference) opened the match with senior
Nathan Peterson at 125 pounds. Peter
son was dominant throughout his bout,
nearly pinning his opponent at the end of
the first period. After fighting off a take
down at the end of the second period, Pe
terson earned a two-point takedown in
the third period to seal an 11-3 major de
cision win and four team points.
After Cal Poly (3-11, 0-5) earned a
major decision of its own at 133, 141-
pound Stanford freshman Rafael Chavez
responded. The first period of Chavez's

match against Evan Melgares was in
tensely fought, but neither competitor
could establish position for any points.
Chavez had three impressive takedowns
en route to his 5-3 victory.
The Mustangs took a brief 8-7 lead in
team points after they got another major
decision win at 149 pounds. But Stanford
senior co-captain and NCAA defending
champion Matt Gentry regained the lead
for the Cardinal with a 13-6 major deci
sion win at 157. Gentry held onto the
major decision by thwarting his oppo
nent's escape attempt and emphatically
throwing him to the floor in the waning
seconds of the third period.
The Stanford middle-weights contin
ued to build momentum as freshman Scott
Loescher won a tight 8-7 decision with the
deciding point coming from riding time.
Junior co-captain Imad Kharbush fol
lowed with a 5-1 decision over Yuri kali
ka at 174 pounds to extend Stanford's
lead to 17-8.
"Imad was the highlight of the night
for me, because he was moving the best
and he got a great win over a very solid
opponent." Buddie said.
The Mustangs forfeited at 184 pounds
to all but assure a Stanford win. Junior
Ryan Hagen decided to wrestle up a weight
class to 197 to get experience against a larg
er opponent and fell 5-2.
Stanford knows that it must put out a

better effort this weekend to be successful,
especially during the early stages of bouts.
"We need to stop coming out flat
footed, and we need to get the intensity
way up because we've started slow the
past three meets," Hagen said. "We've
started slow in the first period and by the
third period we're making comebacks
that we shouldn't have to be making. We
should be putting them away."
While there is still work to be done,
the Cardinal will gladly take their elusive
second home victory.
"The home win is great because it
shows the crowd what we've been up to."
Hagen said. "They hear about us going
out and wrestling some of the top teams
in the nation. Now. after this past week
end where we had two bad duals, we got
to show them what we can do."
Stanford hopes that the performance
was enough to get a raucous crowd to fill
up Burnham Pavilion when the Cardinal
take on rival UC-Davis (4-4-1) on Satur
day at 7 p.m.
"We're very evenly matched and
we've developed a rivalry because
they're one of the closest teams in the
Bay Area," Buddie said. "I'm glad we're
having the dual meet here. We're going
to need to wrestle well and pick up bonus
points in matches where we should win."
Saturday will be the team's alumni night
and the last home dual meet of the season.

Senior Nathan Peterson defeated Cal Poly's Josh Obregon 11 -3 last night. The 125-pound Peterson
recorded three takedowns as the Cardinal won the dual meet.
The Stanford wrestling team notched
its second home dual win of the season
last night against Cal Poly in front of a di
verse home crowd at Burnham Pavilion.
The 23-14 victory excited everyone
that filled the stands, from hecklers to
toddlers dressed in Stanford gear. While
it was a fairly dominant performance, the
Cardinal have many aspects to improve
upon.
"I really don't think this was our best
wrestling, and I don't think we were mov
ing that well," head coach Steve Buddie
said. "When we get leads, we cannot get
tense or shut down. We need to keep
pouring it on. Even so, we kept wrestling
and we closed out wins."
