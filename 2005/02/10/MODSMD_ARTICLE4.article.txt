# Panel defines rape, discusses resources
## 
### ELAINE CHOI STAFF WRITER 
As a precursor to V-Day festivi
ties, which center around this week
end's presentation of "The Vagina
Monologues," a panel of sexual as
sault and rape counselors presented
a teach-in last night on the definition,
impact and responsibilities of rape.
According to Deputy Ali Foss
from the Stanford Department of
Public Safety, when a rape is first re
ported, the survivor is brought to the
police department and medical at
tention is the first priority. An offi
cer will then conduct a short inter
view before taking the survivor to
the hospital fora more thorough
exam.
A counselor at a rape crisis center
will join the survivor at the hospital
or police station for further support,
Foss added.
"While [Counseling and Psycho
logical Services] provides formal re
sponses, the critical resource for
many victims is their friends who are
unsure about what exactly hap
pened," said Alejandro Martinez,
director of counseling and psycho

logical services at Vaden Student
Health Center. "The organization is
invested in being present for stu
dents."
Sexual assault is defined under
California law as "the commission of
an unwanted sexual act, whether by
an acquaintance or by a stranger,
that occurs without indication of
consent of both individuals or that
occurs under threat or coercion."
Stephen Kane, a law student who
works at the local district attorney's
office, explained that under the law
there is a"he said, she said standard"
that complicates prosecution. The
standard is not whether the survivor
thought the incident was rape â€” it is
whether the alleged suspect thought
that the survivor considered it rape
at the time of the incident, he said.
In order to prevent ambiguity,
Kane offered advice from Susan Es
trich's book "Sex and Power."
"Instead of just saying no, say
rape," Kane said. "That way it's crys
tal clear. Then there is no question
about what the situation is. The best
way to prevent this tragedy is to stop
someone in their tracks."
One student in the audience ex
pressed concern about the confiden
tiality of victims and the potential
consequences of having his or her
identity revealed. In order to pro
tect victims, a rape shield law exists
to keep survivors anonymous and
their sexual histories private, the
panelists said.
"We maintain a low profile
geared for protection and to keep
the victim comfortable," Foss said.
"The identity of the victim will not
be released. You don't have to tell us
what you don't want us to know. Vic
tims may not want to give up infor
mation and we respect that-but we
also encourage prosecuting the per
petrator. We need to make an exam
ple out of people."
Another student asked how
much control a victim has in the legal
process of reporting and dealing
with sexual assault or rape cases.
"In many states, rape is a crime
against the state and thus [the gov
ernment can] force the victim to tes
tify," said Sarah Jarvis, the director
of Rape Trauma Services. "Howev
er, in California, nobody who has
been sexually assaulted can be
forced to testify."
Legal process is not necessarily
required and is up to the choice of
the victim. At Stanford, if the victim
reveals the name of the perpetrator,
then the residence dean is legally ob
ligated to report the assault.
"First, 1 tell the victim not to tell
me the name of the person," said
Anne Dowd, a residence dean.
"They can decide after talking about
the incident whether or not to reveal
the name. This way it empowers the
victim."

At the Vaden Student Health
Center, the assault is only reported if
treatment is provided. Usually no in
jury has occurred, so no report is
tiled unless the student decides to
pursue legal action.
Martinez explained the difficul
ties in prosecuting and reporting
such incidents on campus since many
of them occur between people in re
lationships. In a Stanford University
Health Needs Assessment Survey,
% percent of female students and 87
percent of male students said they
knew their offenders.
"Both experience trauma, but
both feel concern for the other,"
Martinez said. "They know that
what happened was wrong but this
is someone they know. They need to
focus on themselves and their

needs."
If the residential staff is in
formed of a sexual assault, the first
person who is contacted is the resi
dence dean, who works with the po
lice to develop the case. If a rape is
reported to the police, the residence
deans are notified first because of
their specific knowledge of on-cam
pus resources.
"The primary focus is on the vic
tim and empowering him or her to
make decisions," said Anne Dowd
of the Office of Student Affairs. "We
provide information on alternatives,
file judicial complaints, sit through
police investigations and provide
support to anyone being accused of
sexual assault."
Sophomore Dina Howard, who
attended the event, said she found

the session to be the most informa
tive she has ever been to on campus.
"I really enjoyed the format of it
being audience-driven rather than
having a speaker talking about a
specific agenda," Howard said.
"The most important thing I
learned was that in the court system
the court looks at whether the sus
pect thinks that what he or she was
doing could be culpable. Another
important thing was (for the victim j
to say 'rape' instead of 'no' so that
there is no ambiguous refusal."
The panel also included Sarah
Jarvis, director of Rape Trauma
Services in Palo Alto; Sally Baird.
head of sexual assault services at
Vaden; and Lieutenant Larry St.
Denis from the Stanford Depart
ment of Public Safety.
