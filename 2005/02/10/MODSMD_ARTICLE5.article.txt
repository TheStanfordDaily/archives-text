# What Dreams May Come. Sleep and the Brain
## 
### NEIL MUKHOPADHYAY 
Have you ever wondered why you feel tired all
the time, or why your dad snores so loudly?
These are the kinds of questions that Dr. Clete
Kushida. a researcher at the Stanford Sleep Clin-

ic, and Dr. William C.
Dement, a professor in
the Department of Psy
chiatry and Behavioral
Sciences, answered at a
colloquium sponsored
by Stanford Continuing
Studies on Saturday.
Sleepless at Stanford
Kushida, who has
been researching sleep
and associated disorders
for over 20 years, kicked
off the event by dis
cussing current research
and potential treatments
for many sleep disor
ders. He lectured on
such ailments as sleep
apnea, insomnia, nar
colepsy, sleepwalking
and Restless Leg Syn
drome.
Kushida defined in
somnia. which affects
nearly 50 percent of

American adults, as being more than just a prob
lem of not being able to sleep at night. The per
vasive disorder includes difficulty initiating and
maintaining a restorative sleep and is caused by
time zone changes, late-night work shifts and ir
regular sleep and waking times.

Insomnia is more
than just a nuisance. It
can result in poor job
performance and poten
tially dangerous fatigue,
according to Kushida.
Kushida's research
suggests that the disor
der can be linked to the
fact that the bedroom
environment becomes
associated with an awak
ened state.
Researchers believe
that there are both psy
chological and biological
causes for insomnia, but
the evidence remains in
conclusive.

Do you have a license for that?
Students who have neglected to register their bikes all year finally got around to it yesterday in White Plaza.

"If you look at this, it's called
'psycho physiological' and that basi
cally tells you that we don't have a
clue what's going on," Kushida
joked.
Kushida gave some advice that
many college students would find
surprising and even distasteful. He
warned against taking naps in the
middle of the day because they tend
to disrupt regular sleeping patterns
He also cautioned against exces
sive use of stimulants such as nico
tine and alcohol, which can also
make it difficult to sleep.
The Dangers of Sleepwalking
Kushida also spoke about anoth
er common nocturnal ailment —
sleepwalking. Although the thought
of bumbling sleepwalkers elicits
laughs, the effect on the victim can
be surprisingly severe. Sleepwalkers
have a 60 percent chance of injuring
themselves if they are not woken up
or otherwise stopped during the inci
dent, according to Kushida.
"We get patients coming in with
lots of cuts and bruises," Kushida
said. "They'll jump out of bed and
go straight for the window... we
also tell them that if they're travel
ing, to avoid getting rooms above
the first floor."
But in addition to causing harm
to the patient, sleepwalking can re
sult in surprisingly morbid conclu
sions and difficult legal situations for
family and even innocent by
standers.
"We actually get quite a few calls
asking fora number of us to be ex
pert witnesses in medical and legal
cases." Kushida said. "There have
been a number of cases when people
have actually committed violent acts
while sleep walking."
Kushida cited a case in which a
sleepwalking man stabbed his moth
er and brutally beat his father-in
law. The patient involved had a his
tory of sleep problems and was even

tually acquitted by a jury.
In another case that ended simi
larly, a man with a record of sleep
disorders who assaulted another in
dividual with a butcher knife and
rolling pin.
' Although the consequences of
sleepwalking are rarely so dire, the
condition remains a nuisance to
many. Kushida explained that, other
than taking certain medications and
being careful, there are no agreed
upon treatments for sleepwalking.
Paying Back the Sleep Debt
Dement shifted the focus of the
colloquium away from clinical sleep
disorders toward a question that stu
dents routinely ponder in their 9
a.m. lecture classes: Why are we per
petually tired and what can we do
about it?
Dement said that the only source
of tiredness is sleep debt, which is a
number that can be found by sub
tracting the amount of sleep gotten
in one night from the eight-hour rec
ommended daily average. This
amount can be added up over the
course of many days, creating cumu
lative sleep debt.
"Healthy young adults generally
feel tired all the time or nearly all the
time, and that's sleep deprivation,"
Dement said. "Whatever they call it,
being unmotivated or being tired,
that is all sleep debt.
"Ninety-five percent of Stanford
students believe you can get too
much sleep, and it's counter-produc
tive," he added.
In order to prove his hypothesis.
Dement set up the "Stanford Sum
mer Sleep Camp,"for which he and
his research team took over a resi
dence hall and restricted the inhabi
tants' sleep to five hours a night.
Each day the experiment continued,
the students' alertness level, mea
sured by the amount of time it took
to fall asleep in bed, progressively
decreased, suggesting a direct rela
tionship between sleep debt and
alertness.

"The larger your sleep debt the
more tired you will feel, the more
impaired you are, the more likely
you are to become drowsy," Dement
said. "Many students feel the best
sleeping occurs in lecture."
"Sleep debt does not just dissi
pate; it will continue to accumulate
until it is alleviated by extra hours of
sleep," he said.
Dement said that though he
could not say exactly how much
sleep debt constitutes a harmful
amount. "50 hours is bad, and half of
all college students have 50 hours or
more sleep debt."
Dement also said that many
tragedies, such as the 1989 Exxon-
Valdez oil spill and the 1986 Chal
lenger Space Shuttle explosion
could be attributed to excess sleep
debt.
After the sleep deprivation ex
periment. Dement attempted to
see what would happen when stu
dents were subjected to the oppo
site — 16 consecutive nights of
12.5 hours of sleep. This experi
ment yielded exactly the results he
was looking for: students with
sleep satiation reported feeling
great and exhibited above-average
reaction times.
Considering this evidence, the
question remains as to why students
sometimes still feel tired even after
getting 16 hours of sleep. Dement
said that students might be waking
up at a time of day in which they are
already accustomed to feeling tired,
what he terms a "sleep trough." He
said that dehydration could also be a
cause of tiredness.
"The key is maintaining consis
tent, sufficient sleep," he said.
Dement is currently working on a
nationwide "late to school" move
ment. which promotes starting pri
mary school later than the standard
8 a.m. The movement is based on
studies that show going to school
later could tremendously improve
academic performance and prevent
up to 175,000 absent days.
