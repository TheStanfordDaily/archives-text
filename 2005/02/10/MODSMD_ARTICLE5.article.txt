# What Dreams May Come. Sleep and the Brain
## 
### NEIL MUKHOPADHYAY 
Have you ever wondered why you feel tired all
the time, or why your dad snores so loudly?
These are the kinds of questions that Dr. Clete
Kushida. a researcher at the Stanford Sleep Clin-

ic, and Dr. William C.
Dement, a professor in
the Department of Psy
chiatry and Behavioral
Sciences, answered at a
colloquium sponsored
by Stanford Continuing
Studies on Saturday.
Sleepless at Stanford
Kushida, who has
been researching sleep
and associated disorders
for over 20 years, kicked
off the event by dis
cussing current research
and potential treatments
for many sleep disor
ders. He lectured on
such ailments as sleep
apnea, insomnia, nar
colepsy, sleepwalking
and Restless Leg Syn
drome.
Kushida defined in
somnia. which affects
nearly 50 percent of

American adults, as being more than just a prob
lem of not being able to sleep at night. The per
vasive disorder includes difficulty initiating and
maintaining a restorative sleep and is caused by
time zone changes, late-night work shifts and ir
regular sleep and waking times.

Insomnia is more
than just a nuisance. It
can result in poor job
performance and poten
tially dangerous fatigue,
according to Kushida.
Kushida's research
suggests that the disor
der can be linked to the
fact that the bedroom
environment becomes
associated with an awak
ened state.
Researchers believe
that there are both psy
chological and biological
causes for insomnia, but
the evidence remains in
conclusive.

Do you have a license for that?
Students who have neglected to register their bikes all year finally got around to it yesterday in White Plaza.
