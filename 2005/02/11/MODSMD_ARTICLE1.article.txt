# No. 4 women travel to Cal

### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The major league baseball season has the dog days of
August and the Kentucky Derby has its final stretch.
These are the times when the top competitors find their
second wind and the also-rans fade from contention.
As No. 4 Stanford (21-2. 12-1 Pacific-1() Conference)
gears up for tonight's game against California at Haas
Pavilion in Berkeley, Calif., it has been 14 weeks and 23

games since the Cardinal started
this year's journey toward the
postseason. Consider the final
lap of the regular season under
way.
Fora team that has spent
nearly the entire season ranked
in the nation's top 5 and has
shown itself to be the class of the
Pac-10, there is little left to do but
"take care of business" for the
rest of the regular season â€” code
for ' beat inferior teams."
Indeed, head coach Tara
VanDerveer admitted that her
philosophy changes a bit as the
conference schedule winds
down.
"Obviously staying healthy is
our number one objective," Van-
Derveer said. "Practices are
shorter, 'rest' is not a four-letter
word, we need people to make
sure they're eating right and get
ting their rest."
VanDerveer gave her play
ers an extra day of rest on Tues
day, and the team will enjoy an
other break this weekend, play-

ing one game instead of two.
Despite a season-ending ankle injury to sophomore
Eziamaka Okafor and recent hand injuries to freshmen
Jessica Elway and Cissy Pierce, VanDerveer's team re
mains generally healthy and, just as important, well
rested.
Stanford's outstanding depth has provided starters
like senior Kelley Suminski and junior Brooke Smith
ample rest while keeping the Cardinal's offense in high
gear.
"Any player in our 10-player rotation 1 think could be
starting on another team in the Pac-10," VanDerveer
said. "They're all doing very well."
As a result, no Stanford player is averaging more than
30 minutes per game, and the Cardinal currently have 10
players playing double-digit minutes.

Riding a 12-game winning streak, Stanford has not
lost since its trip to Eugene, Ore. in early January, but
don't expect this team to get complacent just because its
margin of victory, at 20.8 points per game, is the eighth
highest in the country.
"We're always improving, working on our press,
working on our rebounding," fifth-year senior Susan
King Borchardt said. "We're not even close to where we
want to be yet."
Now there's a scary thought.
VanDerveer and her coaching staff have their squad
learning new tricks, not falling into predictable patterns.
In their 67-53 victory over Arizona State last Saturday,
the Cardinal dusted off their full-court press defense,
forcing the Sun Devils into 18 turnovers and controlling
the pace of play.
"The key to a good press is the first trap, the first
time you do it and the effect it has on someone," fresh
man Candice Wiggins said. "Against [Arizona State]
the first trap we got we forced a turnover, and that gets
us going."
Tonight, Stanford looks to continue its domination
of the rival Golden Bears by notching its 10th straight
victory in the series and 12th straight on Cal's home
floor.
In the season's first contest between these two teams,
the Cardinal jumped on the Bears early, putting the
game out of reach by halftime. Despite playing just 17
and 16 minutes, respectively. Smith and Wiggins took
over the game, as Smith's 21 points led all scorers and
Wiggins' five steals helped keep Cal on the short end of
an 88-53 romp.
In this evening's rematch, the Bears will once again
face the sickening choice of whether or not to guard the
perimeter in a man-to-man scheme and risk a hammer
ing at the hands of Smith, senior T'Nae Thiel and sopho
more Kristen Newlin.
If Cal head coach Caren Horstmeyer instead opts to
commit more bodies to defending the post, rain could
begin to fall at Haas Pavilion when the Cardinal's guards
spot up for open shots from the outside.
In addition, look for Stanford to extend its posses
sions with strong play on the glass. The Cardinal out-re
bounded Cal 39-28 the first time around, and offensive
rebounding has been a point of emphasis for Van-
Derveer over the past week.
When the Bears have the ball, they will look for se
nior Leigh Gregory and her team-high 12.4 points per
game to lead the way. Unfortunately, the offense is de
void of weapons to draw attention from Gregory.
Senior Kristen Iwanaga is the nation's top free
throw shooter, but lives primarily off the three-point
shot, and will likely have trouble freeing up against a
Cardinal defense that won't need to respect an inside
threat.
