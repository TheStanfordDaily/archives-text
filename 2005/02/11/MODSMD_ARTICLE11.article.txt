### XIN XIE STAFF WRITER 
Last night's forum exploring the connec
tions between Japanese internment and post-
Sept. 11 America, blended both artistic and
intellectual elements, including dance and
spoken word in addition to speakers.
"The suspension of civil rights does not
only concern certain groups â€” it threatens all
of us," said Cindy Ng, director of the Asian
American Activities Center. "The speakers
raised important issues, and our hope is that

this is just the beginning. We cannot be silent,
but rather, we have to speak out and prevent
these detentions from happening again."
80 year-old Kiku Funabiki, labeled as an
"ex-con" by the government during World
War II because she was Japanese, said that
she was inspired by the survivors of the war
who spoke out in the 1980s.
"We survivors of World War II are quick
ly becoming an endangered species," Funabi
ki said. "Stories such as ours need to be
shared because these are things that cannot
be found in textbooks."

Funabiki told the tale of her grandfather
being incarcerated by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
"The only evidence presented in the brief
closed hearings was that he had contacts with
Japanese naval vessels, that he socialized with
Japanese naval officers and that he was an ar
dent Buddhist," Funabiki said. "Even though
they ruled that no information definitely con
nected him with sabotage, he was kept in cus
tody for the duration of the war."
