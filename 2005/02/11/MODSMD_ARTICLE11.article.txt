### XIN XIE STAFF WRITER 
Last night's forum exploring the connec
tions between Japanese internment and post-
Sept. 11 America, blended both artistic and
intellectual elements, including dance and
spoken word in addition to speakers.
"The suspension of civil rights does not
only concern certain groups â€” it threatens all
of us," said Cindy Ng, director of the Asian
American Activities Center. "The speakers
raised important issues, and our hope is that

this is just the beginning. We cannot be silent,
but rather, we have to speak out and prevent
these detentions from happening again."
80 year-old Kiku Funabiki, labeled as an
"ex-con" by the government during World
War II because she was Japanese, said that
she was inspired by the survivors of the war
who spoke out in the 1980s.
"We survivors of World War II are quick
ly becoming an endangered species," Funabi
ki said. "Stories such as ours need to be
shared because these are things that cannot
be found in textbooks."

Funabiki told the tale of her grandfather
being incarcerated by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
"The only evidence presented in the brief
closed hearings was that he had contacts with
Japanese naval vessels, that he socialized with
Japanese naval officers and that he was an ar
dent Buddhist," Funabiki said. "Even though
they ruled that no information definitely con
nected him with sabotage, he was kept in cus
tody for the duration of the war."

She added. "He had big dreams to
integrate into U.S. society, and all of a
sudden he was shackled and herded to
five different camps, and held for three
years."

Prof. Sylvia Yanagisako, who also
spoke at the event, placed the Japanese
incarcerations in the context of pre
sent-day discrimination against sus
pected terrorists following the World
Trade Center attacks. She said that
one-third of the world has been ren
dered suspect by U.S. authorities be
cause "they just happen to be born in a
criminal countrv."

Narinder Singh, a founder of the
Sikh Coalition, told the tragic tale of a
Middle-Eastern family who lost two
sons within the span of 11 months, but
who continued to believe in the rights
of Americans.
"One son contributed $75 towards a
fund for victims of Sept. 11. not know
ing that he would soon be one himself,"
Singh said. "But to the family, the lights
of freedom were so strong that it cut
across the darkness of their own expe
rience."
Students and speakers alike said
they found the event to be a positive,
enlightening experience.
"As a Muslim and its a South Asian,
I have seen people encounter hostility
due to their appearance or their be
liefs." said freshman Sanal Parvez. "1
think that the only way to end this is via
awareness, and an event like this helps

the cause because it brings together
speakers working for solidarity and
civil rights."
Several students who were person
ally affected by Sept. 11 shared their
perspectives.
"Alter 9/11.1 was accused of betray
ing my country in my own hometown,
right here in the Bay Area," said fresh
man Vijay Vanchinathan. "Although I
knew the attack was uneducated and
unprovoked, I was helpless because 1
was facing a larger, more powerful or
ganization bent on 'purifying' the na
tion."
Banafsheh Akhlaghi, an activist at
torney who spoke at the panel, said the
event communicated a powerful mes
sage.
"There really is a time to start lix)k
ing at unity as only occurring through
diversity," she said
