# V-Week provokes contrasting opinions
## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
At Stanford, the week before Feb. 14 is no
longer just about flowers and chocolate. In
stead, it has become a time when students
and other community members join others
around the world in raising awareness about
violence against women.
V-Week is part of an international effort
to raise awareness about rape and sexual as
sault and to promote positive body image
among women.

"There are 1,109 events going on for V
week in over 45 countries," said junior An
gela Rastegar, co-founder of Promoting
Women's Health and Human Rights, a
group founded this year that has contributed
to the week's activities, in conjunction with
the Women's Coalition and the Stanford V-
Day Group.
About 700 of these events take place on
college campuses nationwide. The flagship
of Stanford's V-Week observance is the per
formance of Eve Ensler's "The Vagina
Monologues," directed by junior Yana Ke

sala. The first of three performances took
place tonight.
"Ensler interviewed about 200 women,
from all different backgrounds, about their
relationship with their vaginas," said junior
Nicole Schuetz, a cast member. "Some parts
are really poignant and horrifying and other
parts are delightful and funny."
However, the play and surrounding
events have caused some students, who said
they miss the traditional meaning of Feb. 14,
to worry.
"Valentine's Day is divided be
tween hopeless romance and raging
feminism," said freshman Kat Lewin.
"Women use the wide availability of
chocolate in heart-shaped boxes as an
excuse to get together and whine
about men."
Kesala disagreed, noting that the
themes of "The Vagina Monologues"
are not mutually exclusive with ro
mance.

"'The Vagina Monologues' is a
feminist show, but only if you define
feminism as raising awareness about
women's issues and letting people
know that you can be your own
Valentine," Kesala said. "This show
is about loving yourself and under
standing that every part of the human
body is beautiful."
Although Schuetz performs a
monologue entitled "The Angry
Vagina," in whicli she rants about
tampons, gynecological exams and
thongs, she agrees that the show is not
opposed to the conventional spirit of
the holiday.
"One of the monologues is even
introduced as a storv about a woman

who had a good experience with a
man," she said. •
This year, 10 percent of the profits
made from"The Vagina Mono
logues" will be donated to "Women
of Iraq, Under Siege," an internation
al charity. The remaining 90 percent
will be donated to Rape Trauma Ser
vices of San Mateo.
"The V-Week activities are in
tended to raise public awareness
about rape and ending violence
against women," Schuetz said. "It is
about women feeling free to respect
their own bodies."
Apart from the performance of
" The Vagina Monologues," V-Week
activities included a button-selling

fundraiser, a teach-in about sexual as
sault, rape and violence and the dis
play of silent witnesses — the red cut
outs placed throughout White Plaza
that features testimonies of rape and
sexual assault.
"To find stories for the silent wit
nesses, we set up a box where stu
dents could contribute personal sto
ries about rape and violence, and we
searched the internet," Rastegar said.
"It was surprisingly and disappoint
ingly easy to find stories."
Junior Nicole Pierce, who is in
charge of coordinating the V-Week
festivities, helped make the silent wit
ness project a reality.
"The silent witnesses grab peo
ple's attention," Pierce said. "They
bring the point home — rape actually
happens, even on our campus."
Yet, some students had mixed
opinions about the display.
"They're pretty powerful and de
pressing, but they get their point
across," freshman Tina Christakos
said.
Freshman Julie Byren agreed that
the cut-outs are compelling, but did
not feel that they are appropriate to
display so close to Valentine's Day.
And Sophomore Laura Rodriguez
said she didn't think the silent wit
nesses effectively grabbed students'
attention.
The Stanford V-Day groups also
set up a fence with purple ribbons in
White Plaza to recognize people, both
on-campus and off. who have suffered
violent gender discrimination.
"People who have either been a
victim of sexual assault or who know
someone who has been a victim of
sexual assault can tie a purple ribbon
onto the fence," Kesala said.
The silent witnesses will remain in
White Plaza until today and will then
be moved to Kresge Auditorium for
the last two showings of "The Vagina
Monologues." tonight and tomorrow
at 8 p.m.

tampons, gynecological exams and
thongs, she agrees that the show is not
opposed to the conventional spirit of
the holiday.
"One of the monologues is even
introduced as a storv about a woman

who had a good experience with a
man," she said. •
This year, 10 percent of the profits
made from"The Vagina Mono
logues" will be donated to "Women
of Iraq, Under Siege," an internation
al charity. The remaining 90 percent
will be donated to Rape Trauma Ser
vices of San Mateo.
"The V-Week activities are in
tended to raise public awareness
about rape and ending violence
against women," Schuetz said. "It is
about women feeling free to respect
their own bodies."
Apart from the performance of
" The Vagina Monologues," V-Week
activities included a button-selling

fundraiser, a teach-in about sexual as
sault, rape and violence and the dis
play of silent witnesses — the red cut
outs placed throughout White Plaza
that features testimonies of rape and
sexual assault.
"To find stories for the silent wit
nesses, we set up a box where stu
dents could contribute personal sto
ries about rape and violence, and we
searched the internet," Rastegar said.
"It was surprisingly and disappoint
ingly easy to find stories."
Junior Nicole Pierce, who is in
charge of coordinating the V-Week
festivities, helped make the silent wit
ness project a reality.
"The silent witnesses grab peo
ple's attention," Pierce said. "They
bring the point home — rape actually
happens, even on our campus."
Yet, some students had mixed
opinions about the display.
"They're pretty powerful and de
pressing, but they get their point
across," freshman Tina Christakos
said.
Freshman Julie Byren agreed that
the cut-outs are compelling, but did
not feel that they are appropriate to
display so close to Valentine's Day.
And Sophomore Laura Rodriguez
said she didn't think the silent wit
nesses effectively grabbed students'
attention.
The Stanford V-Day groups also
set up a fence with purple ribbons in
White Plaza to recognize people, both
on-campus and off. who have suffered
violent gender discrimination.
"People who have either been a
victim of sexual assault or who know
someone who has been a victim of
sexual assault can tie a purple ribbon
onto the fence," Kesala said.
The silent witnesses will remain in
White Plaza until today and will then
be moved to Kresge Auditorium for
the last two showings of "The Vagina
Monologues." tonight and tomorrow
at 8 p.m.

In "Because he liked to look at it," senior Carlyn Reichel reclaims vagina love for herself and all other women.
At Stanford, the week before Feb. 14 is no
longer just about flowers and chocolate. In
stead, it has become a time when students
and other community members join others
around the world in raising awareness about
violence against women.
V-Week is part of an international effort
to raise awareness about rape and sexual as
sault and to promote positive body image
among women.

"There are 1,109 events going on for V
week in over 45 countries," said junior An
gela Rastegar, co-founder of Promoting
Women's Health and Human Rights, a
group founded this year that has contributed
to the week's activities, in conjunction with
the Women's Coalition and the Stanford V-
Day Group.
About 700 of these events take place on
college campuses nationwide. The flagship
of Stanford's V-Week observance is the per
formance of Eve Ensler's "The Vagina
Monologues," directed by junior Yana Ke

sala. The first of three performances took
place tonight.
"Ensler interviewed about 200 women,
from all different backgrounds, about their
relationship with their vaginas," said junior
Nicole Schuetz, a cast member. "Some parts
are really poignant and horrifying and other
parts are delightful and funny."
However, the play and surrounding
events have caused some students, who said
they miss the traditional meaning of Feb. 14,
to worry.
"Valentine's Day is divided be
tween hopeless romance and raging
feminism," said freshman Kat Lewin.
"Women use the wide availability of
chocolate in heart-shaped boxes as an
excuse to get together and whine
about men."
Kesala disagreed, noting that the
themes of "The Vagina Monologues"
are not mutually exclusive with ro
mance.

"'The Vagina Monologues' is a
feminist show, but only if you define
feminism as raising awareness about
women's issues and letting people
know that you can be your own
Valentine," Kesala said. "This show
is about loving yourself and under
standing that every part of the human
body is beautiful."
Although Schuetz performs a
monologue entitled "The Angry
Vagina," in whicli she rants about
tampons, gynecological exams and
thongs, she agrees that the show is not
opposed to the conventional spirit of
the holiday.
