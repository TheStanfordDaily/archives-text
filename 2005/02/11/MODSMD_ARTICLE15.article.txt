On Feb. 11, 1965, The Stanford
Daily covered a story about advanc
ing molecular research led by Stan
ford Professor William Little. Below
is an excerpt:
"The possibility of creating a new
organic molecule that would he su
perconducting at ordinary room
temperature or above is discussed by
Stanford University Prof. William
A. Little in the leading article of this
month's issue of Scientific Ameri
can.
"Superconductivity is a remark
able kind of electrical perpetual mo
tion that qccurs in certain metals
cooled to near absolute zero (-459
degrees Fahrenheit). When electric
current is induced in such metal, it
flows indefinitely without apprecia
ble loss of power.
"Powerful electromagnets as

strong as 25,000 gauss have been
built on the principle of supercon
ductivity.
"Potential uses [for superconduc
tivity) are lossless power lines, fric
tionless bearings, and superconduct
ing atom smashers. The main stum
bling block has been the require
ment of elaborate and expensive re
frigeration equipment.
"Little's proposed molecule, if it
can be produced, will eliminate the
refrigeration problem. But he em
phasizes that his idea is only a theory
— that although creation of such a
molecule seems possible, it may
eventually prove impossible."
On Feb. 11, 1%0, The Stanford
Daily published an article about the
advancement of U.S. research
through a nuclear submarine voyage

to the North Pole. Below is an ex
cerpt:
"The Navy announced yesterday
the fourth trip by U.S. atomic sub
marines to the North Pole.
"The submarine Sargo broke
through the ice at the top of the
world Tuesday afternoon and plant
ed the state flag of Hawaii, from
which the nuclear boat had sailed on
Jan. 18.
"The cruise to the pole, in the
midst of the arctic winter, re-empha
sized the ability of American nuclear
submersibles — including Polaris
missile subs — to take position at
any season in the international wa
ters above the Soviet Union.
"[The Navy] said the Sargo, like
the submarines Nautilus and Skate
before it, is engaged in collecting
oceanographic data, including infor
mation on the 'physical structure of
the ocean bottom and about sea and
ice conditions in the relatively un
known sea.'
"The direct line distance from
Pearl Harbor, the Sargo's home
port, to the North Pole is about 4,200
nautical miles. However, the Sargo.
in her explorations, traveled a longer
course.
"She was under the ice for 2,744
miles before arriving at the pole 14
days and 21 hours after submerging
at the edge of the pack in the Bering
Sea southwest of Alaska."
