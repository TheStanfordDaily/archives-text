# Mock Trial heads to national tourney
## 
### MIMA A. MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Mock Trial is on a roll
and will be sending two teams to na
tional competitions in lowa and Flori
da in upcoming weeks. The members
recently returned from a successful
showing at a regional tournament in
Portland. Oregon.
"Based on the tiebreakers used to
determine the final order. Stanford
teams finished Ist, 4th and sth," said
Mock Trial Co-president John Krzy
wicki. a senior.
"During a tournament, teams
from different schools compete
against one another by presenting
one side or the other of a case against
another sch(x>l presenting the oppo
site side," he said.
Each year, the team is given a case
to prepare for the competitive season.
The case this year is a civil suit in
which a patient recently released
from a mental institution severely in
jures a young, would-be pro golfer.
The mental patient commits suicide
before he can be brought to trial and
the golfer is suing the hospital for
being negligent in its release of the pa
tient.
"Judges do not take into consider
ation who would have won the case in
terms of how the verdict might have
turned out." Krzywicki said. "Only
the teams' performances are consid
ered."
Mock Trial members usually prac
tice two to three times per week to
prepare for tournaments. Although
most are interested in law careers,
one does not have to be pre-law to
participate in the program and learn
related analytical skills.
"Mock trial is an activity that en
hances public speaking and im
promptu thinking," said Co-Presi

dent Hanna Chiou, a senior who re
ceived an award for her performance
in Portland.
Krzywicki pointed out that al
though the team is comprised of many
political science and international re
lations students, there are others who
are majoring in human biology, En
glish and engineering.
"We wanted to extend the oppor
tunity to compete in Mtxk Trial to as
many undergraduates as possible,"
Chiou said.
Indeed, Stanford's Mock Trial
program is large enough to support
four teams, each composed of eight
members.
This is the first time that more than
one of Stanford's Mock Trial teams
will be competing at the national
level.
"They'll continue preparing as be
fore by meeting as a group and indi
vidually to work on exams, improve
witness performances and change
opening and closing arguments,"
Krzywicki said.
One team will be heading to Na
tionals in Des Moines, lowa, in the
second week of April and another will
be heading to St. Petersberg. Florida,
in three weeks.
"We are extremely excited about
the upcoming national tournaments,"
Chiou said. "We had a fantastic show
ing at Nationals last year and have
built Stanford's name within the com
petitive Mock Trial community."
In addition to team success, indi
vidual members received awards at
the Oregon tournament. Awards
were given to freshmen Diane
Cheng and Angela Du. In addition,
honors were awarded to freshmen
Vineeta Agarwala and Dawn
Maxcy; sophomore Shcrri Hansen;
and seniors Frances Lewis and Vali
cia Saucedo.
