## Teen soap operas: The rise of the bastard children 
### SHIVANI SRIVASTAVA 
Let me confess: I am a fan of teen soap op
eras.
I watch "The 0.C.," "Gilmore Girls," "One
Tree Hill," "Everwood" (until that one kid
woke up from that coma), "Jack & Bobby" and
"Who Wants to Marry My Dad."
That last one may not fit into the aforemen
tioned category, but hell. I watch it anyway.
I am a fan of shows about heartbreak, suf
fering and the occasional life-threatening
coma. I am a fan of shows with illegitimate chil
dren, transvestites, and even — yes, that's right
— illegitimate transvestite children. (Sadly, I
have yet to see the WB make this move.)
The evolution of the teen "you-lied-to
me-and-now-we-can't-be-together-because-
I-have-an-illegitimate-child-with-my-bisex
ual-girl friend-who's-partly-a-tr ansvestite
and-also-I'm-gay" soap opera has been a
staple in my life much as it has been for oth
ers.
Yet, like many others, I have been
mocked and ridiculed for my interest in such
"teen trash." These beloved WB dramas
have been criticized heavily for failing to ac
curately depict reality in a meaningful way
and for being stupid. These critics, however,
fail to recognize the true genius of the teen
soap opera.
The WB is often scoffed at for showing too
many "dysfunctional" relationships. Some
would deem this a flaw — I call it brilliance.
Aren't dysfunctional families a million
times more amusing to watch than normal
ones? If I had to choose between watching a
show about a normal family and watching a
show about a brooding, illegitimate son come
to terms with his estranged transvestite father
while still in a coma, I would choose the
transvestite. Partly because dysfunction is al
ways more entertaining, partly because I think
featuring transvestites are a new and promising
direction for teen soaps.
Another common criticism of teen dramas
is that they are outrageous or unrealistic. Per
sonally, I am shocked to hear such an accusa
tion. I know that when 1 first heard that Fox
was releasing a show about a poor kid with a
good heart going to high school in the superfi
cial world of Orange County, 1 expected that
the show would accurately reflect the life and
drama of 0.C.-ers and give me some valuable
insight into their lives.
I, for one, was shocked — and somewhat
disappointed — to find that my 0.C.-native
RA had not, in fact, borne any illegitimate chil
dren while in high school.
And yet. while many may knock the WB
for its melodrama and inability to reflect re
ality, those very traits make the shows so en
dearing. It's that outrageousness and those
unrealistic plot twists on shows such as "The
0.C." that are precisely what creates their ap
peal. I can always count on "The 0.C." for
entertainment.
Just when the show begins to lag. BAM.
Enter: illegitimate child. And not just any ille
gitimate child, but an illegitimate child who's
unknowingly dating an adopted member of her
estranged father's family. (This would make
Ryan his own adopted step-uncle if he and
Lindsay ever married. FYI.)
All in all, the appeal of the typical WB teen
drama is hard to resist — beautiful high school
kids sleeping around, lying to each other, be
coming drunken sluts and going to class in be
tween it all.
Seriously though. It's the mixing of semi
plausible relationships with that kind of pre
dictable unpredictability — that rollercoaster
of melodrama, that token illegitimate child —
that I find so endearing.
But why am 1 so entranced by high school
soaps when I'm hardly in high school any
more? Perhaps I am trying to fill a void in my
life by living vicariously through these soap
opera teens. Perhaps 1 am compelled to watch
them to make up fora lack of drama in my own
life. Perhaps I am simply too fond of illegiti
mate children.
Most likely, it's because high school dramas
manage to encompass absolutely everything
you could ever want: romance, comedy, poli
tics and social and economic-class warlare.
On the whole, there's nothing wrong with
investing yourself in love triangles, unrequited
love, hookups and breakups, pregnancy scares
and comas — it's perfectly natural.
And honestly, if Alias fans feel no shame in
announcing their Alias-pride, teen-soap
watchers should have no reason to be ashamed,
either. (At least "The 0.C." hasn't resorted to
introducing clones. Yet.)
Overall, teen shows will continue to come
and go and are most likely destined to be criti
cized and alienated for generations to come.
Eventually, though, I dream of the coming of a
show that will rise above the rest and prove to the
world the glory of the teen soap opera — the Mes
siah of the bastard-child-driven-WB. if you will.

Yet, like many others, I have been
mocked and ridiculed for my interest in such
"teen trash." These beloved WB dramas
have been criticized heavily for failing to ac
curately depict reality in a meaningful way
and for being stupid. These critics, however,
fail to recognize the true genius of the teen
soap opera.
The WB is often scoffed at for showing too
many "dysfunctional" relationships. Some
would deem this a flaw — I call it brilliance.
Aren't dysfunctional families a million
times more amusing to watch than normal
ones? If I had to choose between watching a
show about a normal family and watching a
show about a brooding, illegitimate son come
to terms with his estranged transvestite father
while still in a coma, I would choose the
transvestite. Partly because dysfunction is al
ways more entertaining, partly because I think
featuring transvestites are a new and promising
direction for teen soaps.
Another common criticism of teen dramas
is that they are outrageous or unrealistic. Per
sonally, I am shocked to hear such an accusa
tion. I know that when 1 first heard that Fox
was releasing a show about a poor kid with a
good heart going to high school in the superfi
cial world of Orange County, 1 expected that
the show would accurately reflect the life and
drama of 0.C.-ers and give me some valuable
insight into their lives.
I, for one, was shocked — and somewhat
disappointed — to find that my 0.C.-native
RA had not, in fact, borne any illegitimate chil
dren while in high school.
And yet. while many may knock the WB
for its melodrama and inability to reflect re
ality, those very traits make the shows so en
dearing. It's that outrageousness and those
unrealistic plot twists on shows such as "The
0.C." that are precisely what creates their ap
peal. I can always count on "The 0.C." for
entertainment.
Just when the show begins to lag. BAM.
Enter: illegitimate child. And not just any ille
gitimate child, but an illegitimate child who's
unknowingly dating an adopted member of her
estranged father's family. (This would make
Ryan his own adopted step-uncle if he and
Lindsay ever married. FYI.)
All in all, the appeal of the typical WB teen
drama is hard to resist — beautiful high school
kids sleeping around, lying to each other, be
coming drunken sluts and going to class in be
tween it all.
Seriously though. It's the mixing of semi
plausible relationships with that kind of pre
dictable unpredictability — that rollercoaster
of melodrama, that token illegitimate child —
that I find so endearing.
But why am 1 so entranced by high school
soaps when I'm hardly in high school any
more? Perhaps I am trying to fill a void in my
life by living vicariously through these soap
opera teens. Perhaps 1 am compelled to watch
them to make up fora lack of drama in my own
life. Perhaps I am simply too fond of illegiti
mate children.
Most likely, it's because high school dramas
manage to encompass absolutely everything
you could ever want: romance, comedy, poli
tics and social and economic-class warlare.
On the whole, there's nothing wrong with
investing yourself in love triangles, unrequited
love, hookups and breakups, pregnancy scares
and comas — it's perfectly natural.
And honestly, if Alias fans feel no shame in
announcing their Alias-pride, teen-soap
watchers should have no reason to be ashamed,
either. (At least "The 0.C." hasn't resorted to
introducing clones. Yet.)
Overall, teen shows will continue to come
and go and are most likely destined to be criti
cized and alienated for generations to come.
Eventually, though, I dream of the coming of a
show that will rise above the rest and prove to the
world the glory of the teen soap opera — the Mes
siah of the bastard-child-driven-WB. if you will.

Let me confess: I am a fan of teen soap op
eras.
I watch "The 0.C.," "Gilmore Girls," "One
Tree Hill," "Everwood" (until that one kid
woke up from that coma), "Jack & Bobby" and
"Who Wants to Marry My Dad."
That last one may not fit into the aforemen
tioned category, but hell. I watch it anyway.
I am a fan of shows about heartbreak, suf
fering and the occasional life-threatening
coma. I am a fan of shows with illegitimate chil
dren, transvestites, and even — yes, that's right
— illegitimate transvestite children. (Sadly, I
have yet to see the WB make this move.)
