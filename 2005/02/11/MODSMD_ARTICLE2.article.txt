# Men host Bears at Maples
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
"It's nice to be hack in California, I can tell you that
much," head coach Trent Johnson said as he sat down to
field questions from the local media at a luncheon on
Tuesday.
Fora Stanford team that is 10-2 in games played with
in the Golden State and 2-7 everywhere else, the lyrics to
"California Dreaming" just about sum things up. What's

more, the Cardinal (12-9, 6-5 Pa
cific- 10 Conference) are 6-1 at
home, and will play five of their
seven remaining games in Maples
Pavilion. On Saturday, Stanford
welcomes rival California (12-9,
5-6) to the Farm, where the Bears
have not won since 1993.
"It's always fun playing Cal at
home," senior center Rob Little
said. "1 always feel the Cal fans
get the better end of [the rivalry]
because their gym is so large com
pared to ours and it gets so much
louder in there."
Though outnumbered, the
Sixth Man Club should have no
problem outdoing their Berkeley
counterparts in front of a national
television audience, as Saturday's
game promises to have more of a
rivalry feel than Stanford's 74-58
win at Berkeley on Jan. 15.
With full sections of empty
seats and a depleted student sec
tion due partly to the fact that Cal
was not back in session, Haas
Pavilion felt more like a ghost
town than a raucous, visitors'

nightmare. The game marked the first time in 12 years that
the Bay Area rivals met with losing conference records.
Both teams are 4-2 since that game, with Cal playing
markedly better of late and coming off an 84-82 win at Ari
zona State. Some things, though, haven't changed.
Take Stanford's margin for error, which junior point
guard Chris Hernandez declared slim after scoring 19
points in the teams' first meeting to lead Stanford to its
second of six consecutive wins. The streak provided Stan
ford some breathing room, but two losses last weekend in
Arizona have put the pressure on once again.
"For me personally 1 try not to look at it like our backs
are against the wall," Hernandez said. "I'm more embar
rassed by getting swept last week; it's like a pride thing. I
just want to come out and win every game, no matter if our
backs are against the wall or if we've won eight in a row."

But with seven games left to play in the regular season,
Stanford's backs are against the wall and its Pac-10 title
hopes fading. The Cardinal are not alone, as five other
teams — including Cal — are within two games of each
other in the conference standings.
"Outside of Arizona and Washington, if you have a bad
weekend now you can drop three spots," Johnson said.
A win Saturday, coupled with a UCLA loss at Arizona
or Arizona State, would move Stanford into sole posses
sion of third place when the Bruins and USC come to town
next weekend.
"I can't really tell you why it started last time," Little
said. "We were 0-3, we were playing Arizona and it didn't
look like we had a chance in hell. 1 think that may be the
way people feel now. Our backs are against the wall and if
we want a postseason we really have no choice but to win."
Come Saturday that means limiting the effectiveness
of Cal junior forward Rod Benson, who leads the team in
Pac-10 play with 15 points and 7.5 rebounds per game.
Benson went off on the Cardinal back in January, scoring
a game-high 24 points to go along with 11 rebounds.
Junior forward Matt Haryasz, who had his string of
four consecutive double-doubles snapped in last Satur
day's loss to Arizona, will likely matchup against Ben
son, leaving Little to contend with Cal's revolving door
of big men DeVon Hardin, David Paris and Dominic
McGuire.
"(Cal's frontcourt is] as tough as Oregon, which has
four or five logs that they just roll in," Little said. "They're
all really athletic guys. They run the floor and get after
you, it's not like you're playing against a stiff. They can
block shots and they're pretty good offensively if you give
them an angle."
Another key for Stanford will be containing junior
shooting guard Richard Midgley, who is averaging 15
points per game and healthy again after battling a
sprained right shoulder. Midgley has come off the bench
the past three games, and starters Martin Smith — second
in the Pac-10 with a 2.78 assist-to-turnover ratio — and
Ayinde Übaka are also getting major minutes in the back
court.
With neither team favoring a particularly up-tempo or
slow-it-down style of play, the pace of Saturday's game
will come down to who knocks down shots early accord
ing to Hernandez.
"I think whichever team is feeling it early is going to
want to push it.and whichever team is struggling is going
to want to slow it down," said Hernandez, who was feeling
it early in the first game when he drained one of his five
three-pointers off the opening-tip.
Junior guard Dan Grunfeld suffered pain in his hip
after falling awkwardly late in Saturday's loss at Arizona,
but Johnson said Stanford's leading scorer (19.2 points per
game) practiced this week and shot the ball well.
Saturday's tip-off is scheduled for 12:30 p.m.

it early in the first game when he drained one of his five
three-pointers off the opening-tip.
Junior guard Dan Grunfeld suffered pain in his hip
after falling awkwardly late in Saturday's loss at Arizona,
but Johnson said Stanford's leading scorer (19.2 points per
game) practiced this week and shot the ball well.
Saturday's tip-off is scheduled for 12:30 p.m.

"It's nice to be hack in California, I can tell you that
much," head coach Trent Johnson said as he sat down to
field questions from the local media at a luncheon on
Tuesday.
Fora Stanford team that is 10-2 in games played with
in the Golden State and 2-7 everywhere else, the lyrics to
"California Dreaming" just about sum things up. What's

more, the Cardinal (12-9, 6-5 Pa
cific- 10 Conference) are 6-1 at
home, and will play five of their
seven remaining games in Maples
Pavilion. On Saturday, Stanford
welcomes rival California (12-9,
5-6) to the Farm, where the Bears
have not won since 1993.
"It's always fun playing Cal at
home," senior center Rob Little
said. "1 always feel the Cal fans
get the better end of [the rivalry]
because their gym is so large com
pared to ours and it gets so much
louder in there."
Though outnumbered, the
Sixth Man Club should have no
problem outdoing their Berkeley
counterparts in front of a national
television audience, as Saturday's
game promises to have more of a
rivalry feel than Stanford's 74-58
win at Berkeley on Jan. 15.
With full sections of empty
seats and a depleted student sec
tion due partly to the fact that Cal
was not back in session, Haas
Pavilion felt more like a ghost
town than a raucous, visitors'

nightmare. The game marked the first time in 12 years that
the Bay Area rivals met with losing conference records.
Both teams are 4-2 since that game, with Cal playing
markedly better of late and coming off an 84-82 win at Ari
zona State. Some things, though, haven't changed.
Take Stanford's margin for error, which junior point
guard Chris Hernandez declared slim after scoring 19
points in the teams' first meeting to lead Stanford to its
second of six consecutive wins. The streak provided Stan
ford some breathing room, but two losses last weekend in
Arizona have put the pressure on once again.
"For me personally 1 try not to look at it like our backs
are against the wall," Hernandez said. "I'm more embar
rassed by getting swept last week; it's like a pride thing. I
just want to come out and win every game, no matter if our
backs are against the wall or if we've won eight in a row."

But with seven games left to play in the regular season,
Stanford's backs are against the wall and its Pac-10 title
hopes fading. The Cardinal are not alone, as five other
teams — including Cal — are within two games of each
other in the conference standings.
"Outside of Arizona and Washington, if you have a bad
weekend now you can drop three spots," Johnson said.
A win Saturday, coupled with a UCLA loss at Arizona
or Arizona State, would move Stanford into sole posses
sion of third place when the Bruins and USC come to town
next weekend.
"I can't really tell you why it started last time," Little
said. "We were 0-3, we were playing Arizona and it didn't
look like we had a chance in hell. 1 think that may be the
way people feel now. Our backs are against the wall and if
we want a postseason we really have no choice but to win."
Come Saturday that means limiting the effectiveness
of Cal junior forward Rod Benson, who leads the team in
Pac-10 play with 15 points and 7.5 rebounds per game.
Benson went off on the Cardinal back in January, scoring
a game-high 24 points to go along with 11 rebounds.
Junior forward Matt Haryasz, who had his string of
four consecutive double-doubles snapped in last Satur
day's loss to Arizona, will likely matchup against Ben
son, leaving Little to contend with Cal's revolving door
of big men DeVon Hardin, David Paris and Dominic
McGuire.
"(Cal's frontcourt is] as tough as Oregon, which has
four or five logs that they just roll in," Little said. "They're
all really athletic guys. They run the floor and get after
you, it's not like you're playing against a stiff. They can
block shots and they're pretty good offensively if you give
them an angle."
Another key for Stanford will be containing junior
shooting guard Richard Midgley, who is averaging 15
points per game and healthy again after battling a
sprained right shoulder. Midgley has come off the bench
the past three games, and starters Martin Smith — second
in the Pac-10 with a 2.78 assist-to-turnover ratio — and
Ayinde Übaka are also getting major minutes in the back
court.
With neither team favoring a particularly up-tempo or
slow-it-down style of play, the pace of Saturday's game
will come down to who knocks down shots early accord
ing to Hernandez.
"I think whichever team is feeling it early is going to
want to push it.and whichever team is struggling is going
to want to slow it down," said Hernandez, who was feeling
