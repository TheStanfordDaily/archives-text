# V-Day wining and dining in Polo Alto
## 
### JENNIE BRODER 
Valentine's Day is one of those holidays
that is unnecessarily stressful for college
students on a tight budgets. First of all, the
campus setting isn't exactly conducive to
spending a night at home, cuddled in front
of a fireplace and relishing a home-cooked
meal.
So while Jessica Simpson could surprise
Nick with a home aglow with candles, or
chids and a string quartet, the average Stan
ford student is stuck trying to figure out how
to turn his or her double into a romantic
hideaway.
Although a good cleaning is known to do
wonders, chances are that it would take a lot
of effort, light dimmers and rose petals to cre
ate that intimate elegance that women idolize
in classic, chick-tlick fashion.
So unless you are one of the few people
on this campus who have a kitchen at your
personal disposal and some semblance of
privacy. I would focus the romance stage of
the evening off campus.
But that inevitably begs the question of
what exactly to do. and this inevitably leads
to what to do for dinner. Now I'm not biased
against the other meals of the day — a
Valentine's Day brunch would suit me just
fine, but something about dinner evokes a
sense of luxury and splendor not otherwise
associated with lunch or breakfast.
Eating provides us some of the most sen
sual experiences on a daily basis. I think
people forget this basic enjoyment involved
with eating, and Valentine's Day is the per
fect day to rediscover what a pleasurable
experience dinner can be.

Dinner can be. dare 1 say. sexy, intimate
and, when paired with the right wine, bor
derline euphoric. But where in Palo Alto
can one find such blissful experiences?
And more importantly, how do you live up
to that perennial question. "So where did
he/she take you on Valentine's Day?"
So 1 tried to think of restaurants in the
area best suited for each type of relationship
— practically married, "just hanging out," or
happily single. But basically I've come to re
alize that most of these restaurants, other
than the outrageously expensive or cheap,
are just fine for anybody who wants to share
a good meal in good company. As long as you
enjoy each other's conversation, throw con
ventions aside and dine away.
So if you want to show off:
Spago $$$$: The ultimate in refinery.
For the high rollers, but more importantly
those who want to show your girlfriend an
evening of luxurious food and a classy am
biance. Plus you will get major brownie
points, and I wouldn't worry that she'll be
expecting you to take her here on a regular
basis.
Zihibbo $$$$: Another classy choice
that's described as fun, upbeat and definite
ly impressive. The food is eclectic Mediter
ranean. with portions that are meant to be
shared. They have a quaint patio and bar
area that's perfect for relaxing under twin
kle lights.
Little Restaurants with big hearts:
St. Michael's Alley $$$: A quaint hide

away off the beaten path, this restaurant
serves creative Californian cuisine with em
phasis on French and Italian flavors. Can
dles and vintage chandeliers accent its ma
hogany interior to create a casual warmth.
With dishes such as a roasted red beet tart
with spinach and toasted walnuts and br
uschetta with goat cheese and a tomato
herb relish, you're sure to have a delectable
dining experience. (Note: they only have a
special four-course Valentine's Day menu
for $55 per person, not their regular menu.

Bistro Elan $$$: This charming bistro
serving rustic California-French cuisine is a
perfect for power-lunching as well as an in
timate dinner. Famous for their foie gras
and artisan breads. Bistro Elan both has the
energetic dining room and a quaint garden
in the back fora more serene ambiance.
Cafe Kiace $$: A tiny, hole-in-the-wall
trattoria near Page Mill Road, Cafe Riace
serves authentic Italian fare for very rea
sonable prices. The pastas, salads and meat
specials are all made fresh and served with
family-style warmth, creating a friendly and
relaxed environment. If you come here,
make sure to eat on the patio—filled with
fountains, hanging leaves and twinkle
lights, it makes fora very serene and ro
mantic atmosphere.
Great First Date/Low Key,
Yet Still Delicious Restaurants:
La Strada $$$: One of the newer restau
rants to grace the Palo Alto culinary scene,
La Strada serves authentically creative piz

zas and pastas that include a roasted winter
squash and ricotta cheese ravioli and deli
cately prepared meats.
Nola $$$: (535 Ramona Street): Al
though a perennial favorite in the Senior
Pub Night repertoire, Nola's actually is a
great place to go for dinner. The lively and
festive atmosphere makes for an easy, fun
ambiance devoid of awkward silences.
Great drinks accompany the Cajun-style,
Louisiana cuisine, which probably falls
short of Bourbon Street, but the ambiance
more than makes up for it.
Three Seasons $$$: Three Seasons
serves Vietnamese fusion dishes that are
full of clean flavors and fresh ingredients.
My favorite are the shellfish dishes, such as
the prawns and pineapple in a sweet, or
ange-caramel sauce, or the summer spring
rolls with crab, vermicelli rice noodles and
avocado with a soy-ponzu dipping sauce.
Again, the atmosphere is young and trendy
without being obnoxious, and a great op
tion over the cozy bistro.
And a word of caution — don't think of
these as exclusively Valentine's Day spots.
Honestly, the most romantic moments
often come when least expected, so keep in
mind these restaurants for "spontaneous
acts of romance" during the rest of the year.
Valentine's Day is about spending it with
the people you care about, not about trying
to live up to expectations. So if you want to
spend the afternoon relaxing at Zot's beer
garden with messy cheeseburgers and
quarts, go ahead. Or if you want share wine
over a dark chocolate mousse cake, go
ahead. Just savor the tastes and enjoy your
company, and you'll have a satisfying night.
