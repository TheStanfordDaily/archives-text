## Editorial GER changes are riot sufficient 
### 
The Faculty Senate's Feb. 3 decision to signifi
cantly alter the General Education Requirements,
popularly known as GERs, is an indication that the
University is evaluating and improving the curricu
lum — as it should. However, the new structure
lacks the changes that we feel are necessary to meet
the long-term goals of the requirements.
Under the new policy, which will go into effect
at the beginning of the 2005-2006 academic year,
the current Areas 2 and 3 will be combined into the
new Area 2, renamed Disciplinary Breadth, and
will include engineering and applied sciences, hu
manities, mathematics, natural sciences and ap
plied sciences. Students will have to take at least
one course in each sub-category.
The current Area 4 will be the new Area 3,
named Education for Citizenship, and will include
all three of its current sub-categories (Gender Stud
ies, American Cultures and World Cultures, which
will be renamed The Global Community) and will
add Ethical Reasoning as a fourth sub-category.
Students will have to take at least two classes in at
least two different sub-categories in the new Area
3; this requirement is virtually the same as it was
under the current policy.
While we applaud the Faculty Senate for re
viewing the GERs, we feel that the changes do not
alter the requirements in the correct way.
The addition of the Ethical Reasoning sub-cate
gory into the new Area 3 is at both a positive and a
negative change to the requirements. On the one
hand, we feel that Ethical Reasoning is an impor
tant part of the curriculum and that it is vital to a
complete liberal arts education.
However, we feel that by adding this sub-cate
gory to the new Area 3, the University is perpetuat
ing the tendency of students to neglect courses in

that area. The new sub-category will only make it
easier for those students who do not want to take
classes in culture and diversity — which are just as
necessary as classes in Ethical Reasoning — to
avoid that aspect of the curriculum.
We therefore recommend that the University
reevaluate its placement of the Ethical Reasoning
GER and preserve Area 3's emphasis on diversity
and culture.
In addition, we feel that the current changes will
not address the problems that prevent the current
system from fully meeting its goals.
The purpose of GERs is to force students to learn
about subjects that they otherwise might overlook
during the course of their Stanford careers. The
current system — and the new one — attempts to
do this by mandating that students take both
"fuzzy" and "techie" classes. However, determined
students can defeat the system by taking classes
that satisfy GERs but are so broad in scope that
they barely touch upon the intended subject.
It is relatively easy for natural science and
math-oriented students to take humanities cours
es that will allow them to slide through without
thinking critically or being intellectually chal
lenged. Likewise, humanities and social science
oriented students can take broad, GER-satisfying
math and science courses that, for some, amount
to nothing more than a review of high school
courses.
We believe that the new changes do not address
the underlying problems with the GER system. The
University must review the GER policy and evalu
ate each class in the curriculum to determine which
classes are both accessible to all students and nar
row enough in scope that they legitimately satisfy
the mission of the GERs.
