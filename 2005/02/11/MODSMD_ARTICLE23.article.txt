# Counting Sheep
## Don't stop thinking blue 
### 
So here I am sitting in front of what turns out to he a dis
mally small 12-inch Powerßook screen, trying my best to
figure out what makes me the authority on anything. I've
been sitting here for hours. And then, as often happens
when the what-the-hell-did-I-get-myself-into-this-time

feeling enters my head, my oral fixation
rears its ugly head. For the past year my
chew-toy of choice was my Live Strong
bracelet (which, incidentally, I wore
long before the bandwagon got rolling).
After a while the novelty of this yellow
ring of rubber faded, and I enjoyed a
brief hiatus from the bondage of my
Freudian fixation.
Then came the red AIDS relief
bracelets from dance marathon, replac
ing the token of support for the fight

against one deadly disease with the next. This proved to be
a satisfactory hit to alleviate the excruciating pain of my last
l-Hum paper — but then I promptly lost it. And yet as soon
as I 'd freed myself of this trendy $1 charity bracelet, anoth
er found its way in between my clenched teeth. This one,
though, I think I'll hold on to.
This new blue bracelet represents the fight against a very
different kind of disease (although arguably just as deadly):
conservatism. I don't wear this Live Strong knock-off,
"Thinkßlue — 11/04/08," because I'm still hitter about last
November. I wear it because it's important for Democrats
to look to the future and not become defeatists. So I guess
within the confines of my oral-fixation lies the authority I've
been seeking with which to be a columnist.
In retrospect I understand 1 was that really aggressive
liberal kid when November 2nd approached. You know the
type. I had multiple John Kerry pins on my backpack and a
poster on my dorm room door (all still there, by the way); 1

telephoned obviously over-courted Ohioans on Monday
and wore the "Beat Bush" Stanford Dems shirt to the polls
on that fateful Tuesday; and to top it all off, I actually cried
as cautious networks began calling the election late that
night.
If I was overzealous before the election, 1 was anything
but Wednesday morning. Well, actually, there was the lull
where I foolishly held onto the Ohio contention, but that
was short-lived. And then I slipped into the cardinal sin of
apathy. To me, the events that transpired during Bush's first
term constituted more than enough cause to replace him.
I'd been so thoroughly convinced that for once the
Democrats would actually win — I mean, who could possi
bly vote fora man who misled our country into a war to
"fight for freedom abroad" and at the same time endorsed
a Constitutional amendment to limit freedom of minorities
at home? I guess a little Swift Boat Veterans for Truth can
go a long way.
However, as the results began to sink in. I realized that I
am not. in fact, ideologically misaligned with America. In
truth I am only, albeit drastically, misaligned with 51 per
cent of the country. The other 4K percent (thank you
Nader) reminds me that there is continued support for lib
eral ideals. There are midterm elections to be won. mayoral
races to be run, and countless other local and statewide con
tests to be contested. So I'll continue going to Stanford
Dems meetings, I'll keep writing absurdly biased articles
and I'll go on wearing my Thinkßlue bracelet. And 1 rec
ommend all you progressives do the same. 1 don't, howev
er, encourage chewing said bracelets.
