## Stop OSP hand-holding 
### 
It is a sell-evident truth that the Stan
lord campus is dominated by an upper
middle-class sensibility. Of course, this
dominance is neither universal nor felt
consciously by all students. Still, it is
strong enough to extend even to the
Overseas Studies Program, or OSP,
centers. And it was there, at Stanford in
Santiago, that I first grasped the club
like affluence of this university.
There are two sides to the OSP's
silver spoon: class-training and hand-

holding. They are
related but must
be examined one
at a time. Class
training means the
education to
upper-mi d d Ie -
class ideals, and
one word, Bing,
sets the tone.
The Protean
reach of Peter and
Helen Bing's phi-

lanthropy makes for an intriguing study
in itself, but what matters here are the
Bing Cultural Enrichment Events, a se
ries of subsidized dinners, art outings
and weekend trips for OSP students.
Although hardly the only cultural
education an OSP student receives,
the Bing events still loom larger than
any other "Stanford-in" program
ming. Aspects of these outings may
vary between Stanford overseas pro
grams, but common to all ol them are
the mandated "elegant" attire, the jet
setting and the exaltation of ballet,
opera and orchestral music. On my
Bing trips, even the detours to artisan
fairs, tucked as they were between
five-star hotel-stays and day-long re
sort romps, left an unshakable sense of
looking down my nose.
As with the graduation-card apho
rism. "The world is in your hands," the
pleasant facade of the Bing education
belies an aggressive undercurrent that
reeks of entitlement.
Wealth, fame and even knowledge
may accrue to the superior-feeling trav
eler. But "cultural literacy" is a muddier
path with more lasting rewards, and it
must be undertaken with modesty and
an open mind — attributes the Bing
events don't quite encourage.
I hope these observations aren't
mistaken for ingratitude. I enjoyed my
Bing trips and 1 take the limits of phi
lanthropy seriously. 1 would hardly
call for scrapping the Bing events, and
still less would I desire to see a "slum
ming" alternative take their place.
What is needed is a point-counter
point presentation of what it means to
travel and study abroad; instead, we
have an upper-middle-class agenda,
unfettered and unquestioned.
Cultural literacy also requires a

thick skin, and it is the OSP's hand
holding that makes this rather less pos
sible. The hand-holding attitude be
gins at the top: OSP Director Amos
Nur has boasted of the "pampering"
that awaits Stanford-in-Beijing stu
dents. So too is the attitude vindicated
in the everyday life of an OSP student.
Talk to one, and you might hear
that a line-up of English-taught cours
es awaits students at Beijing; that
Berlin students be guaranteed pay or
credit for their internships; that "Stan
ford-in" administrators provide tran
sit passes, library cards and a host of
other trifles to their students. Only the
first of these things do 1 find truly ob
jectionable, but together they amount
to a pricey form of day-care.
The more the OSP holds its stu
dents' hands, the more it restricts their
grasp for cultural literacy. Allowing
students to request certain types of
host families enables better student
host relationships and deeper cultural
immersion. Allowing students to re
quest housing near other Stanford
friends, however, can only have the
opposite effect.
Housing students in well-policed
neighborhoods may head off the kinds
of horrific attacks that have befallen
members of other study abroad pro
grams; but exposing students to little else
enforces a rosy view of the host society.
When class-training and hand
holding converge, the rosy view is per
haps all a student gets. As the OSP's
class-training risks making superiority
seem natural and right, its hand-hold
ing cultivates dependency and inhibits
exploration. The cumulative effect is
the dulling of one's sense for contra
diction, conflict, and challenge—the
essentials of any education.
The salvaging of a decent educa
tion must begin querulously: What
about other social classes? Why can
we travel and others not? How can
Americans study in China without
speaking Chinese? Is that even right?
And yet, what Stanford overseas stu
dent ever hears these questions, let
alone is forced to ruminate on them?
Only the last of those questions is
easy to answer. And none of them
would prove less vexing if revised to a
South Bay context. Any "debate" of
the OSP will necessarily be a home
ward-looking exercise: we students
must face our local prejudices before
we take them abroad with us. Pater
nalism and coddling have, for too long,
vitiated the better ideals of the OSP. It
is high time fora change.

setting and the exaltation of ballet,
opera and orchestral music. On my
Bing trips, even the detours to artisan
fairs, tucked as they were between
five-star hotel-stays and day-long re
sort romps, left an unshakable sense of
looking down my nose.
As with the graduation-card apho
rism. "The world is in your hands," the
pleasant facade of the Bing education
belies an aggressive undercurrent that
reeks of entitlement.
Wealth, fame and even knowledge
may accrue to the superior-feeling trav
eler. But "cultural literacy" is a muddier
path with more lasting rewards, and it
must be undertaken with modesty and
an open mind — attributes the Bing
events don't quite encourage.
I hope these observations aren't
mistaken for ingratitude. I enjoyed my
Bing trips and 1 take the limits of phi
lanthropy seriously. 1 would hardly
call for scrapping the Bing events, and
still less would I desire to see a "slum
ming" alternative take their place.
What is needed is a point-counter
point presentation of what it means to
travel and study abroad; instead, we
have an upper-middle-class agenda,
unfettered and unquestioned.
Cultural literacy also requires a

thick skin, and it is the OSP's hand
holding that makes this rather less pos
sible. The hand-holding attitude be
gins at the top: OSP Director Amos
Nur has boasted of the "pampering"
that awaits Stanford-in-Beijing stu
dents. So too is the attitude vindicated
in the everyday life of an OSP student.
Talk to one, and you might hear
that a line-up of English-taught cours
es awaits students at Beijing; that
Berlin students be guaranteed pay or
credit for their internships; that "Stan
ford-in" administrators provide tran
sit passes, library cards and a host of
other trifles to their students. Only the
first of these things do 1 find truly ob
jectionable, but together they amount
to a pricey form of day-care.
The more the OSP holds its stu
dents' hands, the more it restricts their
grasp for cultural literacy. Allowing
students to request certain types of
host families enables better student
host relationships and deeper cultural
immersion. Allowing students to re
quest housing near other Stanford
friends, however, can only have the
opposite effect.
Housing students in well-policed
neighborhoods may head off the kinds
of horrific attacks that have befallen
members of other study abroad pro
grams; but exposing students to little else
enforces a rosy view of the host society.
When class-training and hand
holding converge, the rosy view is per
haps all a student gets. As the OSP's
class-training risks making superiority
seem natural and right, its hand-hold
ing cultivates dependency and inhibits
exploration. The cumulative effect is
the dulling of one's sense for contra
diction, conflict, and challenge—the
essentials of any education.
The salvaging of a decent educa
tion must begin querulously: What
about other social classes? Why can
we travel and others not? How can
Americans study in China without
speaking Chinese? Is that even right?
And yet, what Stanford overseas stu
dent ever hears these questions, let
alone is forced to ruminate on them?
Only the last of those questions is
easy to answer. And none of them
would prove less vexing if revised to a
South Bay context. Any "debate" of
the OSP will necessarily be a home
ward-looking exercise: we students
must face our local prejudices before
we take them abroad with us. Pater
nalism and coddling have, for too long,
vitiated the better ideals of the OSP. It
is high time fora change.

It is a sell-evident truth that the Stan
lord campus is dominated by an upper
middle-class sensibility. Of course, this
dominance is neither universal nor felt
consciously by all students. Still, it is
strong enough to extend even to the
Overseas Studies Program, or OSP,
centers. And it was there, at Stanford in
Santiago, that I first grasped the club
like affluence of this university.
There are two sides to the OSP's
silver spoon: class-training and hand-

holding. They are
related but must
be examined one
at a time. Class
training means the
education to
upper-mi d d Ie -
class ideals, and
one word, Bing,
sets the tone.
The Protean
reach of Peter and
Helen Bing's phi-

lanthropy makes for an intriguing study
in itself, but what matters here are the
Bing Cultural Enrichment Events, a se
ries of subsidized dinners, art outings
and weekend trips for OSP students.
Although hardly the only cultural
education an OSP student receives,
the Bing events still loom larger than
any other "Stanford-in" program
ming. Aspects of these outings may
vary between Stanford overseas pro
grams, but common to all ol them are
the mandated "elegant" attire, the jet
setting and the exaltation of ballet,
opera and orchestral music. On my
