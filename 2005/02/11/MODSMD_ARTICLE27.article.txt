Condoleezza Rice epitomizes Stanford's
tradition of diversity
I was deeply troubled by Rachelle Mar
shall's op-ed published in The Daily last
week ("Condoleezza Rice's Confirmation
Gives Stanford Nothing to be Proud of,"
Feb. 4) Marshall's contention that "Stanford
has nothing to be proud of in Rice's appoint
ment as Secretary of State" not only repre
sents a clear misunderstanding of accom
plishment, but also demonstrates an appar
ent ignorance for the Stanford tradition of
intellectual independence, diversity and ac
ceptance. Unfortunately, Marshall violated
a principal tenet of academia by allowing her
politics to cloud her rational judgment.
To be clear, I am a Democrat. During the
2(K)4 presidential election, 1 actively cam
paigned for Sen. John Kerry and other
Democratic candidates. Like Marshall, 1 be
lieve the Bush administration forced our
economy into tremendous debt, divided the
population along religious and moral differ
ences, compromised many of our civil liber
ties, and pursued an ideological and danger
ous foreign policy. Considering my politics, it

is my opinion that as national security advi
sor, Rice was one of the primary actors in the
development and execution of these policies.
And. like any member of the government,
she should he held accountable for violations
of legal and constitutional principles. How
ever. no one has charged Rice with violating
the law. Even in Marshall's list of accusa
tions, including Rice's association with the
abuse at Abu Ghraib, neither the American
criminal justice system nor the United States
Senate found Rice culpable of such involve
ment. From Marshall's perspective. Rice is
only guilty of maintaining a different under
standing of the law and international rela
tions.
While Stanford has provided me with
many incredible experiences and opportuni
ties for intellectual growth and professional
advancement during the last four years, I be
lieve Stanford's greatest impact on my life
has been the promotion and recognition of
diversity. Whether this suggests religious,
ethnic, cultural, sexual or political differ
ences, today's Stanford campus is well repre
sented. In a sense. Dr. Rice epitomizes this
Stanford tradition: she is a woman, she is an

African American, she is a scholar, and she is
an independent thinker. Though her inter
pretations of foreign policy do not align with
Marshall's, nor do they coincide with mine.
Rice has made extraordinary progress from a
professor in political science, to provost of
the University and now to secretary of State
of the United States. Despite her controver
sial opinions and her political loyalties.
Rice's biography has inspired many Stanford
students to work hard and dream big.
Dr. Rice, your accomplishments have
brought the Stanford tradition to the highest
levels of our government and throughout the
international community. You have made
me proud to be a student at such a world
class institution.

Red Cross didn't not turn away 'large
numbers' of volunteers
1 wish to clarify a statement made in The
Daily's editorial. "Don't let aid efforts dwin
dle" (Feb. 10). The American Red Cross and

its respective chapters have never turned
away "large numbers" of prospective volun
teers who wish to support much needed local
Red Cross services such as health, safety and
local disaster response programs.
The editorial board appears to be con
tused by what happened soon after the South
Asia tsunami disaster. 1. along with the local
Palo Alto Area chapter, received numerous
inquiries by persons wanting to "go over" to
South Asia to "help." Such prospective vol
unteers usually had never been affiliated
with the American Red Cross, nor had any
training that might be useful in the disaster
area, such as Family Tracing or Water Sani
tation — bit they expected to be sent over to
provide disaster relief. Such inquires were
common throughout the United States.
Sending manpower overseas is a poor uti
lization of resources, and the American Red
Cross tries very hard to be a good steward of
donated dollars.
Only highly trained individuals who have
had a reputable service record with the orga
nization are selected to ensure that resource
efficiency is maximized.
Ninety-seven percent of the people who

work for the American Red Cross are volun
teers, and people need to know that the
American Red Cross is actively recruiting in
dividuals who want to provide programs and
services for the local community. This in
cludes preparing the local community fora
disaster, local disaster response (e.g. house
fires), CPR / first aid education and emer
gency communications for the armed forces.
The Daily's reference is misleading be
cause the American Red Cross is not only in
volved internationally, but provides a di
verse array of important services for the local
community.

teers who wish to support much needed local
Red Cross services such as health, safety and
local disaster response programs.
The editorial board appears to be con
tused by what happened soon after the South
Asia tsunami disaster. 1. along with the local
Palo Alto Area chapter, received numerous
inquiries by persons wanting to "go over" to
South Asia to "help." Such prospective vol
unteers usually had never been affiliated
with the American Red Cross, nor had any
training that might be useful in the disaster
area, such as Family Tracing or Water Sani
tation — bit they expected to be sent over to
provide disaster relief. Such inquires were
common throughout the United States.
Sending manpower overseas is a poor uti
lization of resources, and the American Red
Cross tries very hard to be a good steward of
donated dollars.
Only highly trained individuals who have
had a reputable service record with the orga
nization are selected to ensure that resource
efficiency is maximized.
Ninety-seven percent of the people who

work for the American Red Cross are volun
teers, and people need to know that the
American Red Cross is actively recruiting in
dividuals who want to provide programs and
services for the local community. This in
cludes preparing the local community fora
disaster, local disaster response (e.g. house
fires), CPR / first aid education and emer
gency communications for the armed forces.
The Daily's reference is misleading be
cause the American Red Cross is not only in
volved internationally, but provides a di
verse array of important services for the local
community.

Condoleezza Rice epitomizes Stanford's
tradition of diversity
I was deeply troubled by Rachelle Mar
shall's op-ed published in The Daily last
week ("Condoleezza Rice's Confirmation
Gives Stanford Nothing to be Proud of,"
Feb. 4) Marshall's contention that "Stanford
has nothing to be proud of in Rice's appoint
ment as Secretary of State" not only repre
sents a clear misunderstanding of accom
plishment, but also demonstrates an appar
ent ignorance for the Stanford tradition of
intellectual independence, diversity and ac
ceptance. Unfortunately, Marshall violated
a principal tenet of academia by allowing her
politics to cloud her rational judgment.
To be clear, I am a Democrat. During the
2(K)4 presidential election, 1 actively cam
paigned for Sen. John Kerry and other
Democratic candidates. Like Marshall, 1 be
lieve the Bush administration forced our
economy into tremendous debt, divided the
population along religious and moral differ
ences, compromised many of our civil liber
ties, and pursued an ideological and danger
ous foreign policy. Considering my politics, it

is my opinion that as national security advi
sor, Rice was one of the primary actors in the
development and execution of these policies.
And. like any member of the government,
she should he held accountable for violations
of legal and constitutional principles. How
ever. no one has charged Rice with violating
the law. Even in Marshall's list of accusa
tions, including Rice's association with the
abuse at Abu Ghraib, neither the American
criminal justice system nor the United States
Senate found Rice culpable of such involve
ment. From Marshall's perspective. Rice is
only guilty of maintaining a different under
standing of the law and international rela
tions.
While Stanford has provided me with
many incredible experiences and opportuni
ties for intellectual growth and professional
advancement during the last four years, I be
lieve Stanford's greatest impact on my life
has been the promotion and recognition of
diversity. Whether this suggests religious,
ethnic, cultural, sexual or political differ
ences, today's Stanford campus is well repre
sented. In a sense. Dr. Rice epitomizes this
Stanford tradition: she is a woman, she is an

African American, she is a scholar, and she is
an independent thinker. Though her inter
pretations of foreign policy do not align with
Marshall's, nor do they coincide with mine.
Rice has made extraordinary progress from a
professor in political science, to provost of
the University and now to secretary of State
of the United States. Despite her controver
sial opinions and her political loyalties.
Rice's biography has inspired many Stanford
students to work hard and dream big.
Dr. Rice, your accomplishments have
brought the Stanford tradition to the highest
levels of our government and throughout the
international community. You have made
me proud to be a student at such a world
class institution.
