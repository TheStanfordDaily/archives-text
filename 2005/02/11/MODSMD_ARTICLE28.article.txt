## Jeff Dorman Sucks! Hoops genius lives at Stanford

In one word? Bailers. In two words? Rocket
sauce.
In three words? Senior Dream Team.
Taking the court for our first intramural bas
ketball game — a squad defined by toughness,
tenacity and other strong, polysyllabic words —
dominated the floor at Maples Pavilion.
Initially discouraged to see that our junior-in
training 1M representative had chosen "Senior
Dream Team" as our name, and not the more

appropriate Skillz the Killz,
Vote for Pedro or Purple Glit
ter Pandas, the Senior Dream
Team started out in fine style.
Entering the Pavilion to
the rocking tunes of the Chica
go Bulls' entrance music, the
Senior Dream Team attracted
all sorts of attention. A
'Thunder" Dan Majerle im
personator looked on us with

awe, professional photographers snapped ac
tion shots of our warmup and grad students of all
helmet sizes may have remarked, "Wow. maybe
if we didn't take recreational athletics so seri
ously, we could enjoy this too."
And while only a few grad students took this
idea to heart, the Senior Dream team took it to
the court. For our first game, we showed up to
shock the world.
Senior Joseph Chaudry, starting at point for
ward, made a strong intuitive leap (leap! ha) that
really set the tone for the season. In our first pos
session of our first game, Chaudry, seeing that
the normal Maples game baskets were tucked
away beside our court, drove that lane like Fred
Washington, releasing a monster slam on the
four foot hoop. The Senior Dream Team erupt
ed in laughter and applause. The Longshots, our
opponents, were confused.
For you see, friends, the Dream Team is not
your ordinary intramural squad. Made up en
tirely of seniors too grumpy to care about bas
ketball technique, fashion or skill, the Dream
Team employs numerous tactics to get an edge
on the opposition. For instance, each week, we
have a different theme. There was Hawaiian
Night, there was Ski Team, there was Ballaz!,
and there was Revenge of the Nerds. Oh, and
look out for JT Batson night! We'll be dressing
up little kids in huge jerseys, offering free books
fora successful halfcourt shot and wearing huge
curly wigs. I mean, let's be honest, who can resist
JT Batson?
But what is truly revolutionary' about the
Dream Team isn't our unhealthy infatuation
with the Sixth Man czar: it is our style of play.
Realizing that we are more worthless than a
long-distance relationship, we don't even play
five on defense.
Playing the patented 1-4 zone, we leave our
shortest, smallest and usually most beautiful
player (I'm talking to you, Joe Chaudry ... call
me) at the other end of the court, cherry picking
in his flip-Hops and flowery shirt. Get a re
bound? Chuck it down the court! A steal?
