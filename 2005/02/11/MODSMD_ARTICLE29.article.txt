# Hansen keeps head up in final season

Watching the NCAA Champion
women's volleyball team practice on a
Wednesday afternoon, the men's squad's
All-American setter Kevin Hansen hopes
that his career at Stanford will not end with
out such a title.
"After seeing these girls win the national
championship, it was kind of hopeful,"
Hansen said. "This is my last chance, along
with the other seniors, to get that far."
Unfortunately, the odds do not look
good for the fifth-year senior. The men's
team is currently 3-8 for the season, 2-6 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
The Cardinal have been falling in recent
polls and now stand at No. 11, having start
ed the season at No. 8.
"It's disappointing at times, but I still
love it — I still love playing volleyball,"
Hansen said. "1 would never say that I don't,
just because we've lost a few games. Not
many people get this opportunity to play,
and to be disappointed and upset about it is
not the right attitude to have."
When Hansen first arrived at Stanford,
this optimistic outlook served him well, as
he watched from the sidelines for his en
tire freshman year. Seniors Josh Lukens
and Brad Griffith had been starting setters
for four years, so Hansen redshirted that
season.
"After that, I felt more comfortable play
ing with the team, after training with them
fora year," Hansen said. "Then, when I
ended up starting for four years, that was
probably not what I envisioned at first. 1 was
pretty stoked that it happened."
Hansen had always known that he
wanted to play volleyball. He attributes
his love for the game to his two older sis
ters, both of whom played volleyball for
Princeton.
"I grew up going to their volleyball tour
naments and just kind of playing around
with the ball." he said. "1 kind of grew up on
the beach, too, so 1 played a lot of beach vol
leyball. I started to like it."
Hansen joined a club team in sixth grade
and has been playing ever since.
As a redshirt freshman, he proved to be
an all-around asset, ranking second on the
team in service aces, third in digs and hitting
percentage, and fourth in blocks.
With 4,318 career assists to date, Hansen
currently sits fourth on the Stanford career
assist list. He has been named All-MPSF
three times, and at the end of last season was
named a third-team All-American.
Despite his accomplishments, Hansen
does not think of himself as the star of the
team.
"I'm not really in that much of a spot
light, being a setter," he said. "It's nice just
being more focused on the team than the in
dividual. I don't really feel pressured at all. I
just want them to look good, more than my
self. That's kind of what I worry about
most."
What else is there to worry about?
Grades, of course. With three to four hours

Five years at Stanford hasn't changed setter Kevin Hansen's love for volleyball — he hopes to play in Europe next year.
