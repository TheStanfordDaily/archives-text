# Hansen keeps head up in final season
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Watching the NCAA Champion
women's volleyball team practice on a
Wednesday afternoon, the men's squad's
All-American setter Kevin Hansen hopes
that his career at Stanford will not end with
out such a title.
"After seeing these girls win the national
championship, it was kind of hopeful,"
Hansen said. "This is my last chance, along
with the other seniors, to get that far."
Unfortunately, the odds do not look
good for the fifth-year senior. The men's
team is currently 3-8 for the season, 2-6 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
The Cardinal have been falling in recent
polls and now stand at No. 11, having start
ed the season at No. 8.
"It's disappointing at times, but I still
love it — I still love playing volleyball,"
Hansen said. "1 would never say that I don't,
just because we've lost a few games. Not
many people get this opportunity to play,
and to be disappointed and upset about it is
not the right attitude to have."
When Hansen first arrived at Stanford,
this optimistic outlook served him well, as
he watched from the sidelines for his en
tire freshman year. Seniors Josh Lukens
and Brad Griffith had been starting setters
for four years, so Hansen redshirted that
season.
"After that, I felt more comfortable play
ing with the team, after training with them
fora year," Hansen said. "Then, when I
ended up starting for four years, that was
probably not what I envisioned at first. 1 was
pretty stoked that it happened."
Hansen had always known that he
wanted to play volleyball. He attributes
his love for the game to his two older sis
ters, both of whom played volleyball for
Princeton.
"I grew up going to their volleyball tour
naments and just kind of playing around
with the ball." he said. "1 kind of grew up on
the beach, too, so 1 played a lot of beach vol
leyball. I started to like it."
Hansen joined a club team in sixth grade
and has been playing ever since.
As a redshirt freshman, he proved to be
an all-around asset, ranking second on the
team in service aces, third in digs and hitting
percentage, and fourth in blocks.
With 4,318 career assists to date, Hansen
currently sits fourth on the Stanford career
assist list. He has been named All-MPSF
three times, and at the end of last season was
named a third-team All-American.
Despite his accomplishments, Hansen
does not think of himself as the star of the
team.
"I'm not really in that much of a spot
light, being a setter," he said. "It's nice just
being more focused on the team than the in
dividual. I don't really feel pressured at all. I
just want them to look good, more than my
self. That's kind of what I worry about
most."

Five years at Stanford hasn't changed setter Kevin Hansen's love for volleyball — he hopes to play in Europe next year.
of practice a day, plus a busy travel schedule,
Hansen admitted that doing schoolwork is
sometimes a struggle.
"When you're on the road, you really need
to make an effort to study, which I'm proba
bly the worst at," he said with a smile. "It's
been a little hard, but I've gotten a lot of prac
tice with it after four years. 1 think that for our
team, academics is probably the highest on
our list, and volleyball comes second. But it's
hard to balance that when you really want to
win. 1 joke around with these guys that we
need to focus more on volleyball than we do
on school."
Regardless of whether they're winning
or losing, the friendship they have as a team
is Hansen's favorite aspect of playing for
Stanford.
The guys even made an appearance at the
Donner house meeting on Wednesday, as
part of a slightly facetious campaign for dona
tions to let freshman Jesse Meredith travel
with the team.
"We, I think, are all best friends," Hansen
said. "Spending this much time together,
you're bound to be close. 1 think that's my fa
vorite part, just spending time with the guys
and playing a sport that we all love. In aca
demics, you're kind of an individual against
the whole class, but in team sports, you can re
ally depend on one another."
At the same time, this lack of indepen
dence is Hansen's least favorite thing about
volleyball.
"Often times, your teammates are going to
let you down, and it's hard to try to make up
for that." he said. "I think the most important
part about volleyball is that you kind of need
to work together and not focus on that one
mistake someone did. Rather, just move on
and deal with it as a team, rather than trying
to deal with it as an individual."
This has been an important principle for
the team to keep in mind recently. The Cardi
nal will trv to end a four-game losing streak

this Friday at home against the No. 9 Univer
sity of the Pacific (9-5,3-3 MPSF).
"We're pretty good at bouncing back and
going to the next week and having a good at
titude about working hard in practice,"
Hansen said. "I think everyone's just kind of
more - not disappointed - but just kind of
mad, angry. We're angry that we missed an
opportunity in Hawaii to get that game, and I
think we're going to take that anger and put it
toward UOP on Friday."
The two teams met earlier this season at
the Santa Barbara Tournament, where the
Cardinal defeated the Tigers in just three
games.
However. Hansen knows not to underesti
mate the team that prevented Stanford from
advancing to the postseason in 2(H)4.
"They're obviously going to be a lot bet
ter than when we first saw them," he said. "I
expect them to come out pretty well. Last
year we had a little bit of trouble handling
them at the end of the season, but 1 think
we're going to play pretty well. We've been
resting since we got back from Hawaii a lit
tle bit."
With regard to the future of the team this
season, Hansen is similarly optimistic. He be
lieves that the Cardinal have the talent to
hold their own in the conference, giving them
a definite shot at the playoffs.
"It's obviously really early; 1 mean, it's not
even halfway through the season yet, and
we've played some pretty tough teams,"
Hansen said. "We don't really worry about
whatever place we're in. We're low-ranked,
but it doesn't matter. We can play with any
one. Especially at the end of this season,
that's going to be pretty crucial."
For Hansen, the end of this season will be
the end of his career with the Stanford team.
However, he hopes that it will not be the end
of his entire volleyball career.
"I'm hoping to play professionally in Eu
rope," he said. "Who knows, if that works out
fora year, two years, we'll see. I'm not going
to say I'm looking toward the Olympics or
something like that; I mean, that's kind of a
long way away, but that's kind of my initial
plan: to get all the volleyball out of my system
before I call it quits."

the beach, too, so 1 played a lot of beach vol
leyball. I started to like it."
Hansen joined a club team in sixth grade
and has been playing ever since.
As a redshirt freshman, he proved to be
an all-around asset, ranking second on the
team in service aces, third in digs and hitting
percentage, and fourth in blocks.
With 4,318 career assists to date, Hansen
currently sits fourth on the Stanford career
assist list. He has been named All-MPSF
three times, and at the end of last season was
named a third-team All-American.
Despite his accomplishments, Hansen
does not think of himself as the star of the
team.
"I'm not really in that much of a spot
light, being a setter," he said. "It's nice just
being more focused on the team than the in
dividual. I don't really feel pressured at all. I
just want them to look good, more than my
self. That's kind of what I worry about
most."

Five years at Stanford hasn't changed setter Kevin Hansen's love for volleyball — he hopes to play in Europe next year.
of practice a day, plus a busy travel schedule,
Hansen admitted that doing schoolwork is
sometimes a struggle.
"When you're on the road, you really need
to make an effort to study, which I'm proba
bly the worst at," he said with a smile. "It's
been a little hard, but I've gotten a lot of prac
tice with it after four years. 1 think that for our
team, academics is probably the highest on
our list, and volleyball comes second. But it's
hard to balance that when you really want to
win. 1 joke around with these guys that we
need to focus more on volleyball than we do
on school."
Regardless of whether they're winning
or losing, the friendship they have as a team
is Hansen's favorite aspect of playing for
Stanford.
The guys even made an appearance at the
Donner house meeting on Wednesday, as
part of a slightly facetious campaign for dona
tions to let freshman Jesse Meredith travel
with the team.
"We, I think, are all best friends," Hansen
said. "Spending this much time together,
you're bound to be close. 1 think that's my fa
vorite part, just spending time with the guys
and playing a sport that we all love. In aca
demics, you're kind of an individual against
the whole class, but in team sports, you can re
ally depend on one another."
At the same time, this lack of indepen
dence is Hansen's least favorite thing about
volleyball.
"Often times, your teammates are going to
let you down, and it's hard to try to make up
for that." he said. "I think the most important
part about volleyball is that you kind of need
to work together and not focus on that one
mistake someone did. Rather, just move on
and deal with it as a team, rather than trying
to deal with it as an individual."
This has been an important principle for
the team to keep in mind recently. The Cardi
nal will trv to end a four-game losing streak

this Friday at home against the No. 9 Univer
sity of the Pacific (9-5,3-3 MPSF).
"We're pretty good at bouncing back and
going to the next week and having a good at
titude about working hard in practice,"
Hansen said. "I think everyone's just kind of
more - not disappointed - but just kind of
mad, angry. We're angry that we missed an
opportunity in Hawaii to get that game, and I
think we're going to take that anger and put it
toward UOP on Friday."
The two teams met earlier this season at
the Santa Barbara Tournament, where the
Cardinal defeated the Tigers in just three
games.
However. Hansen knows not to underesti
mate the team that prevented Stanford from
advancing to the postseason in 2(H)4.
"They're obviously going to be a lot bet
ter than when we first saw them," he said. "I
expect them to come out pretty well. Last
year we had a little bit of trouble handling
them at the end of the season, but 1 think
we're going to play pretty well. We've been
resting since we got back from Hawaii a lit
tle bit."
With regard to the future of the team this
season, Hansen is similarly optimistic. He be
lieves that the Cardinal have the talent to
hold their own in the conference, giving them
a definite shot at the playoffs.
"It's obviously really early; 1 mean, it's not
even halfway through the season yet, and
we've played some pretty tough teams,"
Hansen said. "We don't really worry about
whatever place we're in. We're low-ranked,
but it doesn't matter. We can play with any
one. Especially at the end of this season,
that's going to be pretty crucial."
For Hansen, the end of this season will be
the end of his career with the Stanford team.
However, he hopes that it will not be the end
of his entire volleyball career.
"I'm hoping to play professionally in Eu
rope," he said. "Who knows, if that works out
fora year, two years, we'll see. I'm not going
to say I'm looking toward the Olympics or
something like that; I mean, that's kind of a
long way away, but that's kind of my initial
plan: to get all the volleyball out of my system
before I call it quits."
Watching the NCAA Champion
women's volleyball team practice on a
Wednesday afternoon, the men's squad's
All-American setter Kevin Hansen hopes
that his career at Stanford will not end with
out such a title.
"After seeing these girls win the national
championship, it was kind of hopeful,"
Hansen said. "This is my last chance, along
with the other seniors, to get that far."
Unfortunately, the odds do not look
good for the fifth-year senior. The men's
team is currently 3-8 for the season, 2-6 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
The Cardinal have been falling in recent
polls and now stand at No. 11, having start
ed the season at No. 8.
"It's disappointing at times, but I still
love it — I still love playing volleyball,"
Hansen said. "1 would never say that I don't,
just because we've lost a few games. Not
many people get this opportunity to play,
and to be disappointed and upset about it is
not the right attitude to have."
When Hansen first arrived at Stanford,
this optimistic outlook served him well, as
he watched from the sidelines for his en
tire freshman year. Seniors Josh Lukens
and Brad Griffith had been starting setters
for four years, so Hansen redshirted that
season.
"After that, I felt more comfortable play
ing with the team, after training with them
fora year," Hansen said. "Then, when I
ended up starting for four years, that was
probably not what I envisioned at first. 1 was
pretty stoked that it happened."
Hansen had always known that he
wanted to play volleyball. He attributes
his love for the game to his two older sis
ters, both of whom played volleyball for
Princeton.
"I grew up going to their volleyball tour
naments and just kind of playing around
with the ball." he said. "1 kind of grew up on

need to focus more on volleyball than we do
on school."
Regardless of whether they're winning
or losing, the friendship they have as a team
is Hansen's favorite aspect of playing for
Stanford.
The guys even made an appearance at the
Donner house meeting on Wednesday, as
part of a slightly facetious campaign for dona
tions to let freshman Jesse Meredith travel
with the team.
"We, I think, are all best friends," Hansen
said. "Spending this much time together,
you're bound to be close. 1 think that's my fa
vorite part, just spending time with the guys
and playing a sport that we all love. In aca
demics, you're kind of an individual against
the whole class, but in team sports, you can re
ally depend on one another."
At the same time, this lack of indepen
dence is Hansen's least favorite thing about
volleyball.
"Often times, your teammates are going to
let you down, and it's hard to try to make up
for that." he said. "I think the most important
part about volleyball is that you kind of need
to work together and not focus on that one
mistake someone did. Rather, just move on
and deal with it as a team, rather than trying
to deal with it as an individual."
This has been an important principle for
the team to keep in mind recently. The Cardi
nal will trv to end a four-game losing streak

this Friday at home against the No. 9 Univer
sity of the Pacific (9-5,3-3 MPSF).
"We're pretty good at bouncing back and
going to the next week and having a good at
titude about working hard in practice,"
Hansen said. "I think everyone's just kind of
more - not disappointed - but just kind of
mad, angry. We're angry that we missed an
opportunity in Hawaii to get that game, and I
think we're going to take that anger and put it
toward UOP on Friday."
The two teams met earlier this season at
the Santa Barbara Tournament, where the
Cardinal defeated the Tigers in just three
games.
However. Hansen knows not to underesti
mate the team that prevented Stanford from
advancing to the postseason in 2(H)4.
"They're obviously going to be a lot bet
ter than when we first saw them," he said. "I
expect them to come out pretty well. Last
year we had a little bit of trouble handling
them at the end of the season, but 1 think
we're going to play pretty well. We've been
resting since we got back from Hawaii a lit
tle bit."
With regard to the future of the team this
season, Hansen is similarly optimistic. He be
lieves that the Cardinal have the talent to
hold their own in the conference, giving them
a definite shot at the playoffs.
"It's obviously really early; 1 mean, it's not
even halfway through the season yet, and
we've played some pretty tough teams,"
Hansen said. "We don't really worry about
whatever place we're in. We're low-ranked,
but it doesn't matter. We can play with any
one. Especially at the end of this season,
that's going to be pretty crucial."
For Hansen, the end of this season will be
the end of his career with the Stanford team.
However, he hopes that it will not be the end
of his entire volleyball career.
"I'm hoping to play professionally in Eu
rope," he said. "Who knows, if that works out
fora year, two years, we'll see. I'm not going
to say I'm looking toward the Olympics or
something like that; I mean, that's kind of a
long way away, but that's kind of my initial
plan: to get all the volleyball out of my system
before I call it quits."
