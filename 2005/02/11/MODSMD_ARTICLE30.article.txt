# No. 6 softball hosts Invite
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Five games, each about two hours long, completed in
one weekend? This might sound taxing at first, but for
the women on the No. 6 Stanford softball team (3-1) this
is hardly a wearing task. That's because these women
have been taking on multiple-game days long before
they were going to middle school dances. They will do
that again this weekend at the Stanford Invitational.
"It actually started when I was l()-and-under and we
had this big tournament where in one day we had to play
five games starting at 9 a.m. and our last game starting
at 11 p.m.," sophomore leftfielder Jackie Rinehartsaid.
With such tournaments continuing to getting bigger in
12-and-under and 14-and-under divisions, through high
school and summer ball, the squad is used to playing at
least two games a day.
"That's what a lot of us have been doing our whole
lives," junior right-hander Laura Severson said. "[ln]
ASA ball - American Softball Association - there are
tournaments with a hundred teams."
While the team has already experienced victories
and defeats this season, the Stanford Invitational will
give the Cardinal five new opportunities to build up
their season resume. Having to size up so many squads
within a week's notice might also seem daunting, but the
players give credit to their coaching staff for keeping
them up-to-date with scouting reports.
Stanford takes on five non-conference challengers
Friday through Sunday at Boyd and Jill Smith Family
Stadium.
"These tournaments where we bring some teams
we've never seen that we might see in the postseason is
really great," Rinehart said.
As for freshman pitcher Becky McCullough, the In
vitational will provide a little more than just fun.
"It's a good opportunity to get a lot of work in a
weekend," she said.
San Diego State (5-0) is up first on Friday. The
Aztecs take the circle with an arsenal of three strong
pitchers and a freshman class that accounts for 20 of 33
runs and 18 of 30 RBIs thus far.
