# No. 6 softball hosts Invite
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Five games, each about two hours long, completed in
one weekend? This might sound taxing at first, but for
the women on the No. 6 Stanford softball team (3-1) this
is hardly a wearing task. That's because these women
have been taking on multiple-game days long before
they were going to middle school dances. They will do
that again this weekend at the Stanford Invitational.
"It actually started when I was l()-and-under and we
had this big tournament where in one day we had to play
five games starting at 9 a.m. and our last game starting
at 11 p.m.," sophomore leftfielder Jackie Rinehartsaid.
With such tournaments continuing to getting bigger in
12-and-under and 14-and-under divisions, through high
school and summer ball, the squad is used to playing at
least two games a day.
"That's what a lot of us have been doing our whole
lives," junior right-hander Laura Severson said. "[ln]
ASA ball - American Softball Association - there are
tournaments with a hundred teams."
While the team has already experienced victories
and defeats this season, the Stanford Invitational will
give the Cardinal five new opportunities to build up
their season resume. Having to size up so many squads
within a week's notice might also seem daunting, but the
players give credit to their coaching staff for keeping
them up-to-date with scouting reports.
Stanford takes on five non-conference challengers
Friday through Sunday at Boyd and Jill Smith Family
Stadium.
"These tournaments where we bring some teams
we've never seen that we might see in the postseason is
really great," Rinehart said.
As for freshman pitcher Becky McCullough, the In
vitational will provide a little more than just fun.
"It's a good opportunity to get a lot of work in a
weekend," she said.
San Diego State (5-0) is up first on Friday. The
Aztecs take the circle with an arsenal of three strong
pitchers and a freshman class that accounts for 20 of 33
runs and 18 of 30 RBIs thus far.
A night game with Cal Poly (2-1) fol
lows, and next on the list is DePaul, which
is set to kick off the Cardinal's Saturday.
The Blue Demons (3-2) could still he
beaming from their 3-2 win over No. 4 Ok

lahoma. The Cardinal hats will face their
opponent's ace. Trade Adix (3-0), and her
glistening .89 ERA.
■DePaul is a pretty good team," Rine
hart said. "They're pretty scrappy. They'll
definitely play us differently than the two
teams we've played so far this season, so
they're someone to maybe look at for the
postseason."
Stanford will take on Kentucky on Sat
urday afternoon, as the Wildcats enter the

tournament still looking for their first win
(0-5).
No. 21 Long Beach State will be the
last to stand in the batter's box against
Stanford on Sunday. Melanie McCauley
leads the 49ers with a .529 average, while
senior righthanders Meredith Cervenka
(2-1) and Marcel Torres (2-0) head the
Long Beach pitching staff. Torres has
also banged out six homers this season.
"We don't focus on, "Oh my gosh,
there are five different teams,"' said Sev
erson, the Cardinal's ace with a 2-1
record and 16 Ks over 18 innings. "But
you do realize that you're playing a dif
ferent opponent every game so that
makes it fun.
"We're not looking at one team as in
'They're the ones to beat,"' Severson
added. "We just want to play well and be
consistent the whole weekend."
Rinehart expressed similar sentiments.
"If we look past one of them we won't
play well against another one," she said.
The Cardinal have had mixed results
against four of the five teams in their
most recent tilts. In 2003 Stanford split a
pair of two-game series against San
Diego State and Long Beach State, in al
most identical fashion with 2-0 losses and
closely contested 3-0 and 3-2 wins in
Southern California.
The Cardinal have won both of their
previous meetings with Kentucky, while
Stanford and DePaul will take the same
field for the first time in recent years on
Saturday.
"Hopefully all of them should be good
games and so we'll try to go equally to each
team," said McCullough, who will also be
taking the circle this weekend.
While one might think a game-filled
weekend is a toll on the body and mind,
Rinehart, who usually ignores the bumps
and bruises once on the field, said there's
no problem with a softball overload. Even
in their elementary school years the play
ers weren't overwhelmed.
"When you're that young, it was so ex
citing and [there was] so much excitement
and adrenaline out there that it was so
much fun to play five games in one day,"
Rinehart said.
"You seem to get over being sore a lot
quicker," she added with a smile.

that again this weekend at the Stanford Invitational.
"It actually started when I was l()-and-under and we
had this big tournament where in one day we had to play
five games starting at 9 a.m. and our last game starting
at 11 p.m.," sophomore leftfielder Jackie Rinehartsaid.
With such tournaments continuing to getting bigger in
12-and-under and 14-and-under divisions, through high
school and summer ball, the squad is used to playing at
least two games a day.
"That's what a lot of us have been doing our whole
lives," junior right-hander Laura Severson said. "[ln]
ASA ball - American Softball Association - there are
tournaments with a hundred teams."
While the team has already experienced victories
and defeats this season, the Stanford Invitational will
give the Cardinal five new opportunities to build up
their season resume. Having to size up so many squads
within a week's notice might also seem daunting, but the
players give credit to their coaching staff for keeping
them up-to-date with scouting reports.
Stanford takes on five non-conference challengers
Friday through Sunday at Boyd and Jill Smith Family
Stadium.
"These tournaments where we bring some teams
we've never seen that we might see in the postseason is
really great," Rinehart said.
As for freshman pitcher Becky McCullough, the In
vitational will provide a little more than just fun.
"It's a good opportunity to get a lot of work in a
weekend," she said.
San Diego State (5-0) is up first on Friday. The
Aztecs take the circle with an arsenal of three strong
pitchers and a freshman class that accounts for 20 of 33
runs and 18 of 30 RBIs thus far.
A night game with Cal Poly (2-1) fol
lows, and next on the list is DePaul, which
is set to kick off the Cardinal's Saturday.
The Blue Demons (3-2) could still he
beaming from their 3-2 win over No. 4 Ok

lahoma. The Cardinal hats will face their
opponent's ace. Trade Adix (3-0), and her
glistening .89 ERA.
■DePaul is a pretty good team," Rine
hart said. "They're pretty scrappy. They'll
definitely play us differently than the two
teams we've played so far this season, so
they're someone to maybe look at for the
postseason."
Stanford will take on Kentucky on Sat
urday afternoon, as the Wildcats enter the

tournament still looking for their first win
(0-5).
No. 21 Long Beach State will be the
last to stand in the batter's box against
Stanford on Sunday. Melanie McCauley
leads the 49ers with a .529 average, while
senior righthanders Meredith Cervenka
(2-1) and Marcel Torres (2-0) head the
Long Beach pitching staff. Torres has
also banged out six homers this season.
"We don't focus on, "Oh my gosh,
there are five different teams,"' said Sev
erson, the Cardinal's ace with a 2-1
record and 16 Ks over 18 innings. "But
you do realize that you're playing a dif
ferent opponent every game so that
makes it fun.
"We're not looking at one team as in
'They're the ones to beat,"' Severson
added. "We just want to play well and be
consistent the whole weekend."
Rinehart expressed similar sentiments.
"If we look past one of them we won't
play well against another one," she said.
The Cardinal have had mixed results
against four of the five teams in their
most recent tilts. In 2003 Stanford split a
pair of two-game series against San
Diego State and Long Beach State, in al
most identical fashion with 2-0 losses and
closely contested 3-0 and 3-2 wins in
Southern California.
The Cardinal have won both of their
previous meetings with Kentucky, while
Stanford and DePaul will take the same
field for the first time in recent years on
Saturday.
"Hopefully all of them should be good
games and so we'll try to go equally to each
team," said McCullough, who will also be
taking the circle this weekend.
While one might think a game-filled
weekend is a toll on the body and mind,
Rinehart, who usually ignores the bumps
and bruises once on the field, said there's
no problem with a softball overload. Even
in their elementary school years the play
ers weren't overwhelmed.
"When you're that young, it was so ex
citing and [there was] so much excitement
and adrenaline out there that it was so
much fun to play five games in one day,"
Rinehart said.
"You seem to get over being sore a lot
quicker," she added with a smile.

Sophomore Jackie Rinehart and the Stanford softball team has the challenge of facing
five teams in three days this weekend at home.
Five games, each about two hours long, completed in
one weekend? This might sound taxing at first, but for
the women on the No. 6 Stanford softball team (3-1) this
is hardly a wearing task. That's because these women
have been taking on multiple-game days long before
they were going to middle school dances. They will do
that again this weekend at the Stanford Invitational.
