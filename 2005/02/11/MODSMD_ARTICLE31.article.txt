# Diverse team, only one goal

### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
For the top-ranked Stanford women's tennis team (6-
0), season-long winning streaks and record-breaking vic
tories have become standard fare.
But to many outsiders, a team on a 36-match winning
streak, a team that shuts out the opponent in prestigious
tournament finals, is a boring team indeed.
So the Cardinal downed No. 14 Kentucky. 4-0, at the
National Team Indoor Championship last week? Been
there, done that. Remember their 4-1 assault on then-No.
9 UCLA at the 2(M)4 NCAAs?
Caught in the throes of the Cardinal's unparalleled re
cent success, however, is an incredible team spirit and
warmth that most overlook.
Yesterday, Stanford survived an innocuous tune-up
match against No. 41 Sacramento State(3-3) with a 5-2
victory. The four-and-a-half hour affair proved that
when the going gets tough and the modest number of
spectators dwindles away, members of the tight C ardinal
squad have each other for much-needed support.
Before going into the match, juniors Alice Barnes and
Amber Liu attempted to set the record straight about the
long misunderstood dynamics between them.
"When we were freshmen, a lot of people were not ex
pecting us to win." Barnes said. "The three key players
who had won the NCAA title year after year had gradu
ated. After a tough loss. 4-3. to Cal in the Team Indoor
quarterfinals, we were 3-1 after a 120-something winning
streak in the past few years. We know what it's like to
lose, and it's made me have more of an understanding
now that I'm an upperclassman. I'm always thinking
about team dynamics."
Barnes continued. "People were (also] looking for ri
valry, citing Amber playing No. 1 as a freshman. In real
ity, we're really close friends even though we're com
pletely different people."
The contrast between No. 12 Barnes (16-5) and Liu
(2-0) seems most striking when you consider their pro
fessional tennis plans. Liu, the two-time defending
NCAA Singles Champion, spends her summers and

much of the fall season competing in both satellite and
high-end tournaments. Barnes, meanwhile, has already
forsaken the professional world.
"1 got up to the $25,(XX) tournaments, but they're not
in the greatest places," Barnes said. "I didn't like all the
logistics of always traveling, and wanted to be back in
school."
Liu has also had her share of big-time letdowns. In all

three of her appearances at the U.S. Open, she was
knocked out in the first round. While losing 6-1, 6-1 to
Kim Clijsters raises nary an eyebrow, dropping matches
to legions of Maria Sharapova wannabes unleashes a
litany of criticism.
Regardless, Liu remains optimistic about her chances

Despite differing styles of play and long-term aspirations, juniors Alice Barnes and Amber Liu team up to lead
the top-ranked Stanford women.
after Stanford.
"Once I'm out of school I'll have better
time and energy to devote to the pro cir
cuit," Liu said. "It's tough right now be
cause people outside see my coming back to
school as giving up. You lose a lot of support
by not going pro earlier."
It would seem that a team with a No. 1
player that stays on the verge of leaving her
teammates for the ups and downs of the pro
lifestyle would be riddled with tension.
Barnes was quick to jump to Liu's defense.
"When Amber comes back each season,
she fits right back in with the team." Barnes
said. "I've never heard any criticism, and
not one of us is jealous of her success. I can't
emphasize enough how much of a rarity it is
to win two NCAA singles titles and come
back, to be such a star and still care about
the team. We're lucky to have that."
While Liu continues prepping for this
season on the sidelines with Stanford head
coach Lele Forood. Barnes was one of four
singles players yesterday who outlasted
Sacramento State in three sets.
In the No. 2 singles position, Barnes

dropped a 7-3 tiebreaker in the first set to
No. 61 Anna Erikson, before making a
steady turnaround to topple her, 6-7(3), 7-6,
6-2.
One court over at the No. 3 singles po
sition, a fiery Theresa Logar (17-3)
fought in sharp contrast to Barnes' qui
eter struggle.
After No. 35 Logar had her serve broken
to slip in the first set, 2-3, her frustration
rang out with every shot in the host of long
rallies her opponent, Roberta Fessenko,
had in store.
Logar challenged a line call, and at one
point was told by the referee not to bang her
racket on the ground.
It was Barnes' patience and deceptively
swift backhands that helped close out the
match, but it was Logar's relentless discon
tentment that fueled a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 come
back, ending the day in Stanford's favor.
Freshman Lejla Hodzic and senior Erin
Burdette unexpectedly dropped their
three-set decisions.
Playing at the No. 1 singles position, No.
22 Burdette appeared to overpower No. 17
Margarita Karnaukhova (11-2) in the first
set. Breaking Karnaukhova's serve to open
the match, Burdette stayed on the offensive
to go up 6-2.
Burdette also held serve to go up 5-1 in
the second set, when errors crept into her

game. Karnaukhova took just 15 minutes to
tie the showdown at 5-all, later emerging
with a 6-2,5-7,2-6 win.
At the No. 6 singles position, the Hor
nets' Cecilia Helland handed Hodzic a 3-6,
6-4,6-3 loss, adding a rare blemish to Hodz
ic's 16-4 record.
At the No. 4 and 5 singles spots, re
spectively, freshman Whitney Deason
(18-4) and No. 82 sophomore Anne
Yelsey (15-5) fared better. Deason de
feated Klara Petersson, 6-2, 6-0, while
Yelsey allowed Anna Karaveyeva just
one game in her 6-1, 6-0 conquest.
With no shortage of genuine praise,
Barnes sums up the 2005 team dynamic.
"I couldn't imagine us being closer,"
Barnes said. "The freshmen have won
every fair play award and everybody
works hard."
Liu added, "We have a really good team
leader. Alice is so modest, she's at every
workout, and her lifestyle on and off the
court makes her a great role model."
Keep the heart of the Stanford team in
mind as it begins Pacific-10 Conference
match play next week. The Cardinal will
face off against No. 75 Washington State
(2-4) and No. 9 Washington (6-1) next Fri
day and Saturday at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium. Both matches will begin at 1:30
p.m.
