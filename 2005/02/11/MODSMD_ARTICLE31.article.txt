# Diverse team, only one goal

For the top-ranked Stanford women's tennis team (6-
0), season-long winning streaks and record-breaking vic
tories have become standard fare.
But to many outsiders, a team on a 36-match winning
streak, a team that shuts out the opponent in prestigious
tournament finals, is a boring team indeed.
So the Cardinal downed No. 14 Kentucky. 4-0, at the
National Team Indoor Championship last week? Been
there, done that. Remember their 4-1 assault on then-No.
9 UCLA at the 2(M)4 NCAAs?
Caught in the throes of the Cardinal's unparalleled re
cent success, however, is an incredible team spirit and
warmth that most overlook.
Yesterday, Stanford survived an innocuous tune-up
match against No. 41 Sacramento State(3-3) with a 5-2
victory. The four-and-a-half hour affair proved that
when the going gets tough and the modest number of
spectators dwindles away, members of the tight C ardinal
squad have each other for much-needed support.
Before going into the match, juniors Alice Barnes and
Amber Liu attempted to set the record straight about the
long misunderstood dynamics between them.
"When we were freshmen, a lot of people were not ex
pecting us to win." Barnes said. "The three key players
who had won the NCAA title year after year had gradu
ated. After a tough loss. 4-3. to Cal in the Team Indoor
quarterfinals, we were 3-1 after a 120-something winning
streak in the past few years. We know what it's like to
lose, and it's made me have more of an understanding
now that I'm an upperclassman. I'm always thinking
about team dynamics."
Barnes continued. "People were (also] looking for ri
valry, citing Amber playing No. 1 as a freshman. In real
ity, we're really close friends even though we're com
pletely different people."
The contrast between No. 12 Barnes (16-5) and Liu
(2-0) seems most striking when you consider their pro
fessional tennis plans. Liu, the two-time defending
NCAA Singles Champion, spends her summers and

much of the fall season competing in both satellite and
high-end tournaments. Barnes, meanwhile, has already
forsaken the professional world.
"1 got up to the $25,(XX) tournaments, but they're not
in the greatest places," Barnes said. "I didn't like all the
logistics of always traveling, and wanted to be back in
school."
Liu has also had her share of big-time letdowns. In all

three of her appearances at the U.S. Open, she was
knocked out in the first round. While losing 6-1, 6-1 to
Kim Clijsters raises nary an eyebrow, dropping matches
to legions of Maria Sharapova wannabes unleashes a
litany of criticism.
Regardless, Liu remains optimistic about her chances
