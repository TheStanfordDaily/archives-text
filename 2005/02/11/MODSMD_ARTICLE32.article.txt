# Duo's debut sparks high hopes, Card to host KU

### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Lust weekend against Cal State-Fullerton,
with the score knotted at three in the bottom
of the seventh, Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess waved a new pitcher out of the
bullpen.
A lanky righthander trotted to the mound,
face expressionless, motions fluid as he tossed
his warmup pitches. Like he knew exactly
what he was doing, as though he'd been doing
it forever.
His steely, resolved glare does a good job
of hiding the truth, which is that long-limbed
freshman Nolan Gallagher has been a reliev
er for less than a month. I.ike many college
pitchers, (Jallagher was a starter before his ar
rival on the Farm. And even then, it's a safe
bet that he never faced an offensively power
ful team like the defending College World Se
ries Champion Titans.
Hut on the No. 6 Stanford baseball team (4-
2), opportunities for rookie pitchers abound,
especially when the squad is forced to rely
heavily on its hurlers instead of its inexperi
enced offense. Gallagher and fellow right
handed freshman Erik Davis have already put
in enough quality relief innings — 91/3 com
bined in the first two series of the year — to be
locks to throw more this weekend against
Kansas (6-0).
Though the pressure on a reliever is testing
and the challenge of fitting into a new system
as a freshman is even more daunting, Davis
and Gallagher both regard their early oppor
tunities as more of a blessing than a burden.
"It makes you feel really fortunate that the
coaches have that much confidence in you,"
Gallagher said "The whole staff and the
whole team are behind you. They're telling
me they have confidence in me when they
throw me in those games."
Of course, pitching time was never a guar
antee for the freshman duo, especially on a
staff that returned all of its starting pitchers.
But Gallagher and Davis both earned a
chance on the mound, and learned quickly
that being part of such an experienced pitch
ing staff was an advantage.
"(Sophomore starter] Jeff C iilmore has re
ally helped me," Davis said. "I think he's real
ly good in the way he attacks hitters, he's not
afraid of anybody. That's something I'd like to
pattern myself after."
Gallagher, who did not begin pitching until
last month after recovering from a stress frac
ture in his elbow, has also found a mentor on
the staff in ace Mark Romanc/uk.
"1 le comes up to me after I pitch and asks
me what 1 thought I could do better," Gal
lagher said. "He tells me what was going on
when he was in our position as a freshman."
So far. Marquess has been pleased with the
poise of his rookies. Davis' ERA took a shot
last Sunday as he battled a pinch-hitting,
sweep-hungry Titan team, but he finished the

game and preserved a Stanford win. Gal
lagher took the loss against Fullerton. allow
ing the run that broke the 3-3 tie, but pitched
a steady two innings and maintained a 1.80
ERA.
"They've done a good job," Marquess said.
"It's difficult for freshmen: it's an adjustment,
they're nervous, everything's magnified. But
they're going to help us, it's just a matter of
getting them out there enough so they can get
used to it."
Gallagher has seemingly put himself in line
for the Sunday starting job — current starter
Greg Reynolds has struggled the past two
weekends — but for now, the frosh duo is
content with their relief roles.
"I actually like relieving a little more than
starting," Davis said. "You are that one guy
that people look to when you need the win."
Of course, not every pitcher is so happy
with relief innings, and the Cardinal will face
off against one such hurler this weekend when
the Jay hawks arrive at Sunken Diamond fora
three-game series.
Kansasjunior Kodiak Ouick transferred to
the Jayhawks' baseball program after two
years at Stanford. The change was made in
part because Lawrence is close to his home
town of Kansas City, Mo., and in part because
Quick wanted a spot in a starting rotation.
"He felt he had a better opportunity to
start there," Marquess said. "And that's true.
I le would have been a reliever for us."
Quick got his wish and started the Jay
hawks' season opener against Hawaii-Hilo,
tossing a complete game shutout. Despite
being 2-0 with a 0.60 ERA, he is not listed as a
starter for this weekend's series.
Instead. Kansas will send lefthanders Sean
Land (0-0) and Mike Zagurski (1-0) and
righty Clint Schambach (1 -0) to the mound to
face Romanczuk (1-1), Gilmore (1-0) and a
yet-to-be-determined third starter.
The Jayhawks are coming off a six-game
sweep of Hawaii-Hilo and will certainly find
the Cardinal a more challenging opponent.
Junior Ritchie Price — son of Kansas head
coach Ritch Price — leads all everyday
starters with a .417 average at the plate with
fellow junior Matt Baty not far behind at .400.
Cardinal juniors Chris Minaker, Jed
Lowrie and John Mayberry, Jr. lead the Car
dinal on offense with all three batting well
above .350.
Despite this trio's hard hitting, and the
glimpses of power from other spots in the line
up, Stanford will rely heavily on its pitching
staff to get the team through, as always. Ro
manc/uk, Gilmore and Co. have seen the Jay
hawks before; Stanford swept the Jayhawks
last season. And as for the newcomers to the
Stanford staff?
"Fall workouts were about proving to my
self that I could get the job done," Davis said.
"If 1 can get out guys like John and Jed, then I
can get people from Fullerton, Kansas or
Fresno out too."

throw me in those games."
Of course, pitching time was never a guar
antee for the freshman duo, especially on a
staff that returned all of its starting pitchers.
But Gallagher and Davis both earned a
chance on the mound, and learned quickly
that being part of such an experienced pitch
ing staff was an advantage.
"(Sophomore starter] Jeff C iilmore has re
ally helped me," Davis said. "I think he's real
ly good in the way he attacks hitters, he's not
afraid of anybody. That's something I'd like to
pattern myself after."
Gallagher, who did not begin pitching until
last month after recovering from a stress frac
ture in his elbow, has also found a mentor on
the staff in ace Mark Romanc/uk.
"1 le comes up to me after I pitch and asks
me what 1 thought I could do better," Gal
lagher said. "He tells me what was going on
when he was in our position as a freshman."
So far. Marquess has been pleased with the
poise of his rookies. Davis' ERA took a shot
last Sunday as he battled a pinch-hitting,
sweep-hungry Titan team, but he finished the

game and preserved a Stanford win. Gal
lagher took the loss against Fullerton. allow
ing the run that broke the 3-3 tie, but pitched
a steady two innings and maintained a 1.80
ERA.
"They've done a good job," Marquess said.
"It's difficult for freshmen: it's an adjustment,
they're nervous, everything's magnified. But
they're going to help us, it's just a matter of
getting them out there enough so they can get
used to it."
Gallagher has seemingly put himself in line
for the Sunday starting job — current starter
Greg Reynolds has struggled the past two
weekends — but for now, the frosh duo is
content with their relief roles.
"I actually like relieving a little more than
starting," Davis said. "You are that one guy
that people look to when you need the win."
Of course, not every pitcher is so happy
with relief innings, and the Cardinal will face
off against one such hurler this weekend when
the Jay hawks arrive at Sunken Diamond fora
three-game series.
Kansasjunior Kodiak Ouick transferred to
the Jayhawks' baseball program after two
years at Stanford. The change was made in
part because Lawrence is close to his home
town of Kansas City, Mo., and in part because
Quick wanted a spot in a starting rotation.
"He felt he had a better opportunity to
start there," Marquess said. "And that's true.
I le would have been a reliever for us."
Quick got his wish and started the Jay
hawks' season opener against Hawaii-Hilo,
tossing a complete game shutout. Despite
being 2-0 with a 0.60 ERA, he is not listed as a
starter for this weekend's series.
Instead. Kansas will send lefthanders Sean

face Romanczuk (1-1), Gilmore (1-0) and a
yet-to-be-determined third starter.
The Jayhawks are coming off a six-game

the Cardinal a more challenging opponent.

dinal on offense with all three batting well
above .350.
Despite this trio's hard hitting, and the
glimpses of power from other spots in the line
up, Stanford will rely heavily on its pitching
staff to get the team through, as always. Ro

Freshman righthanders Nolan Gallagher and Erik Davis, like many Stanford rookies before
them, have wasted no time in contributing for the Cardinal.
Lust weekend against Cal State-Fullerton,
with the score knotted at three in the bottom
of the seventh, Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess waved a new pitcher out of the
bullpen.

of hiding the truth, which is that long-limbed
freshman Nolan Gallagher has been a reliev

handed freshman Erik Davis have already put
in enough quality relief innings — 91/3 com
bined in the first two series of the year — to be
locks to throw more this weekend against
Kansas (6-0).
