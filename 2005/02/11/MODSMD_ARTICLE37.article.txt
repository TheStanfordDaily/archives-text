## VILE OPPRESSION ENDS 
### TAM VO, BRENDAN MARTEN SAM TANZER INTERMISSION BUREAU CHIEFS 
We here at Intermission have endured
the tyranny of The Stanford Daily for
long enough. Shackled to our unwieldy
folding chairs and the burden of proper
journalistic practices, we had no choice
but to fuck...
shit up.
But why our anger? Why our outrage?
We have to dream of a better yester
day, as we don't even have an updated
calendar in our office.
We have to dictate articles over the
telephone because we have a non-func
tional computer.
We have to ALWAYS, ALWAYS re
mind people we exist so they include us in
the goddamn dinner order.
When were we relegated to this sorry

state of infantile dependence and servi
tude? We don't know, but we realized
that it is high time that Intermission
stop being the pathetic lapdog of The
Daily and started being its own best
friend.
Tain and Brendan tried to abandon
their posts. Tarn got "elected" sorority
president. Brendan got "busy" with
schoolwork. Victor got "Puerto Rican"
and ... well, "busy" with schoolwork as
well. Tom got "graduated." And thanks
to The Daily, we all got served.
All in all, it should have been a clean
sweep.
So we all submitted our notices of res
ignation. We thought we were finally
free.
But then, guilt and the inevitable del
uge of second thoughts kicked in. We re
alized that we weren't abandoning our
posts — we were abandoning our people,

our cause, our revolution. 11 we aban
doned our station, the last outpost of re
sistance against the capitalist scourge, all
would be lost.
And that would totally suck.
So we're back. We brought in fresh ed
itor blood. Sir Sam of Tanzer, upon the
tragic loss of Tom, and we've redoubled
our layout strength through the addition
of Betsy and Caley after "el" Victor de
cided to start attending class.
But we weren't going to return in just
any fashion: We were coming back on our
terms, in our style. Thus, the uprising. The
revolution. The newly created, free state
of Intermission. We've come a long way.
But we're still only at the beginning.
Many golf clubs have beeir swung.
Many file cabinets have been overturned.
Many lives have been lost.
But isn't it all worth it when you've got
freedom?

The forces of evil (The Stanford Daily, left) struggle to suppress the uprising of the Intermission insurgency (forces of good, right) Shortly after this
skirmish, the Intermissionaries retreated to their cubicle stronghold, from which ihey made their last stand (rather unlike that of Custer, in that they
didn't all die). The newly free Intermission was soon to be born!


A fight to the end: The Intermission insurgents barricade themselves in their office
while Daily staffers attempt a last charge on their position before yielding.
