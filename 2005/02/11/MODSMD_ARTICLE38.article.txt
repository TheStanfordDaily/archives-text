# 'Vagina' an experience that everyone should have
## 
### JEN BEICHMAN INTERMISSION VAGINA COMMENTATOR 
I'in having a crisis. For some rea
son, I agreed to review V-Week's pro
duction of "The Vagina Mono
logues." Tuesday night I saw a dress
rehearsal, and now I'm stuck trying to
write a review that doesn't make me
feel like I'm betraying my own vagina.
So here goes: The performance
runs like an emotional roller coaster,
but the peaks and drops don't always
flow and build as they should. Fve F.n
sler, of course, gets some of the blame
— in terms of emotional tone, the text
itself jumps all over the place. And de

spite the unevenness of some of the
monologues, there are several shining
moments of true affirmation and
humor that make me feel like I can
recommend the show to anyone who
doesn't mind sitting through some of
the less-than-perfect moments.
The show begins with three ac
tresses who are worried about vaginas
— worried enough to wonder which
character on "The 0.C." their vaginas
most resemble. In truth, it's this kind
of commentary that makes me the
MOST worried about vaginas. It's im
mature and superficial. Plus. I don't
even watch "The 0.C."
From this estrogen-laced begin
ning. we move straight into mono

loguc number one — man-bashing.
Apparently, men will always be shit.
I could easily go through each and
every tjionologue and point out flaws.
Hut that would be boring. Instead, I
will move to what might have been
the most poignant part of the show.
The middle section focuses on the
mutilation, abuse and rape of women
all over the world and the mysterious
and unspecified "he" behind it all.
There is no hope within the destruc
tion and horror. The mutilated
women lose all personal identity and
become markers fora cause. One of
the men who pours acid on his wife's
face is described as wanting "to make
her none." The subject matter in this

section is inherently disturbing, so it
has to be approached in a very sensi
tive manner. When it's done with
fever-pitch emotion, it becomes al
most too painful to watch.
After this section, the crowning
achievements of the entire enterprise
occur. Three monologues did an espe
cially good job of empowering and af
firming women and their vaginas.
And these three monologues alone
are worth the price of admission:
"Coochie Snorcher," "My Short
Skirt" and "Sex Worker." See the
show, if just for these monologues.
Even if they aren't much nicer to men
than the rest of them, they're well
worth the two hours of your time.

I want to encourage men to go to
this show because there's a part of me
that wants desperately for them to see
the world from a different perspec
tive. But an unambiguously positive
recommendation would be some
where along the lines of feeding chil
dren castor oil — apparently it's good
for you, but it's hard to tell if the dis
comfort is worth it. The show ab
solutely drips with disdain for the Y
chromosome. If I had a penis, it would
have shriveled up and died, or invert
ed itself in embarrassment. But still,
it's an experience everyone should
have. Seeing the"The Vagina Mono
logues," I mean — not the genital in
version.
