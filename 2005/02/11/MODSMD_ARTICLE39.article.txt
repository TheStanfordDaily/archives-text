## 'Hitch' a ride to another movie, okay? 
### FARIS MOHIUDDIN INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
In the world of cinema, February marks a
time when 1) Companies release leftover Hol
iday Movie Season crap and 2) New, but
equally crappy Valentine's Day romances
come out in full force. But fear not, Intermis
sion reader — though "Hitch" doesn't blaze
any new comedic or romantic horizons, it
doesn't quite collapse in a heap of flaming sen-

timentality, either.
Enter Will Smith
as Alex Hitchins,
the almost mythical
"date doctor" who
has the right pre
scription for all your
woman-problems.
No, he's not a suave
OBGYN, he's a self
described dating
consultant — he

hooks guys up with the otherwise unattainable
girls of their dreams. Hitch equips his clients with
all the tools needed to woo any woman in three
dates. He'll teach you how to dance, talk, dress
and yes, he'll even show you how to kiss. Sadly, the
image of Will Smith's lips meeting Kevin James'
will be etched in mv nightmares for the foresee

able future. And now
that I think about it,
Hitchins is really just a
socially acceptable
pimp — except that the
women never realize
they've been pimped
(nor do they get to keep
20 percent of the money
left on the dresser).
Hitchins' main pro
fessional endeavor re-

volves around
helping Albert
Brennaman snag
über rich socialite
Allegra Cole.
Kevin James'
portrayal of Al
bert Brennaman
is basically his
"King of Queens"
alter ego Doug

Heffeman... in a suit...
and glasses. James' activity for the movie consists
of breaking things, falling, spilling mustard on
himself and dancing in a fashion reminiscent ol
Soul Train on acid. Though his performance is
largely a one-note show, he consistently draws
the biggest laughs in the movie. Smith and James

rapport on camera even overshad
ows Smiths own romance.
Speaking of which, "Hitch" tran
sitions sluggishly into Hitchins'
problematic attempts to garner the
affections of Sara (Mendes). Sara,
a sassy gossip columnist, leaves a
lasting impression on Hitchins and
he resolves to win her over. The
film would like to suggest that
Hitch has met his match ... but
after a couple of awkward conver
sations and about 15 minutes of
screen time, she's won over too.

And who could blame her? Will Smith runs the
gamut of charming mannerisms that we've
known and loved since the days of "Fresh
Prince."
If "Hitch" suffers from anything, it's straining
to create conflict where it doesn't exist and
doesn't need to. Multiple plot lines are strung
throughout the course of the movie only to
crescendo in a misunderstanding that gets reme
died within five minutes.
"Hitch" missteps again when it delves into
Hallmark territory by suggesting that Hitchens'
clients got the girls on their own all along. 'Cuz
you know, if you be yourself, then no woman can
ever reject you... right? Right. The films con
certed effort to moralize Hitchens' profession
seems superfluous given that the movie's best
moments are completely devoid of such senti
mentality.
In all, "Hitch" features two immensely
likeable actors, a really hot actress and a
beautifully fitting springtime in a New York
backdrop. Although feeble plot progression
and character development take their toll,
"Hitch" remains reasonably pleasant
nonetheless. But if you want to be treated to
a REAL film — hours of subtle character
study and shocking plot twists around every
corner — go see "Pooh's Heffalump Movie"
instead.
