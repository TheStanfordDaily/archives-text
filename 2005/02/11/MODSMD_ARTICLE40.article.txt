# Intermission Trailer Park... real movies are just too long
## 
### NEIL MUKHOPADHYAY INTERMISSION MOVIE TRAILER CRITIC 
What's a broke-ass college student to do when
the price of a movie ticket hits $11? (Besides
download movies from Bit Torrent sources on-

line, that is.) Screen the trailers for this week's
box office releases and decide which are ac-

tually worth paying money

for. Unless your girlfriend
adamantly insists on see-

ing "Pooh's Heffalump
Movie" for Valentine's

Day, you'll be better off rent-

ing from Blockbuster this week
end. "But 1 have midterms!" you
whine. We here at Intermission saved
vou some time and watched the

trailers for you — and except for
"Ong Bak," we want those five

minutes of our lives back.

"Imaginary Heroes" - The
first warning sign is that the
title is immediately followed

by the director's name. It's not
just "Imaginary Heroes" — it's

"Imaginary Heroes: A Film by Dan Harris." I get
worried whenever a film uses a title like this.
Harris' latest flick stars Sigourney Weaver and
Jeff Daniels as the parents in a dysfunctional
family that's breaking up. From the looks of

the preview, it should end up somewhere

along the lines of "Garden State" meets

p —
"American Beauty." But as far as I'm
concerned, the only thing that should

involve breaking and Sigourney
Weaver are Aliens and her chest.

Dan Harris should have

put his talents to better

use and created a
Predator vs. Sigourney
Weaver movie. That

would have been sweet.

"Ong Bak"-The preview
for "Ong Bak" is only about
4() seconds long, which is

I significantly shorter than
I the standard three min
utes. But those 40 seconds
were more than enough for

me to ascertain that this is the
movie you should be watching on

Friday night. Here's
why: The preview features
someone getting kicked
extremely hard. In the
neck. I watched it eight
times. Over the years, I've
developed a general rule of
thumb with movies — the
more kicking, the better.
Examples include "Mortal

Kombat," "Mortal Kombat: Annihilation" and,
of course, "The Street Fighter Movie." Ong Bak
stars the up-and-coming martial arts star Tony
Jaa, who looks like he's going to fit right into the
venerable tradition of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan
and Jet Li. Bruce Lee went for the general hard
core-bad-ass strategy, Jackie Chan hit people
with crazy objects and Jet Li fought a computer
animated version of himself. Hard to beat, 1
know. But from this 40-second preview, 1 think
it's a safe bet that Jaa will just focus all his energy
on kicking people and things in the face. It's a
strategy I like.
"Pooh's HcfTalump Movie" - From the title of
this movie, I'd assume it's about Pooh's first
venereal disease. But apparently a Heffalump is

a big
purple elephant.

Watch as the mysteri-
ous Heffalump joins
the familiar cast of Pooh,

Tigger, Piglet, Roo and Eeyore. Shiver with de
light as the motley cast rediscovers yet again
what exactly friendship means. About 75 per
cent of the movie will be recycled footage of
Pooh bumbling around with his head in a honey
pot and asking Rabbit stupid questions. And
there will probably be some not-so-subtle un
dertones of racism — the Heffalump is, after all,
a PURPLE elephant. But if you've got any little
siblings or small illegitimate children, this movie
is probably a good bet for them.
Editor's Note: Due to the dismal state of the
movie industry during the months of January
through March, we've decided that reviewing
movie trailers is more economically efficient than
reviewing the actual movies. And less painful
than sitting through two hours of Winnie the
Pooh going on honey binges.
