# So you Wanna secede... You're in good company
## Fuck The Daily: A Declaration of Independence 
### 
When in the Course ofa newspaper's events il becomes neeessary for one section to dissolve the journalistic bands which
have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the written word, the separate and equal sta
tion to which the l.aws of the Associated Press entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that
they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Stanford Daily staffers are created equal, that they are endowed (quite well), that
among their rights are Irrelevance, Random Pirate References and the pursuit of Nonsensical Photo Captions. —That to secure
these rights, Newspapers are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the Staffers, —That whenever
any Form of Newspaper becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the Staffers to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a
new Newspaper, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely
to effect their Inability to Meet Deadline and Want of Sexual Innuendo.
Hut when a long train of I )eadlines and Forced Adherence to ()ther Various Newspaper Conventions, pursuing invariably the same
Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Capitalist I legemony, it is their right, il is their duty, to throw off such News
paper, and to provide new Fditors for their future security. —Such has been the patient sufferance of the section of Intermission;
and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Newspaper Production. The history of the pre
sent Editor in Chief of The Stanford Daily is a history of repealed injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the estab
lishment of an absolute Tyranny over Intermission. To prove this, let Mildly Persuasive Whining be submitted to a candid world.
Ihe Editor in (Tiiefhas maintained that she has the right to copy edit the Intermission section and dilute its purpose of Bourgeoisie Subversion.
T*he Editor in Chief has striven to impose an imperialist system of wage pay upon the Intermission section's employees, making
them Slaves to the Masters of Capital rather than Dutiful Servants to the Public Good.
'I"he Editor in Chief has striven to force the Editors to destroy the notion of the Public Domain by requiring that works copyright
ed under the Capitalist Regimes be properly attributed.
The Editor in Chief has abandoned all effort to provide all Orphans and Widows with a means to their betterment.
The Editor in Chief has ordered the suppression of Commas preceding Ands, and Ands.
The Editor in Chief has striven to keep Intermission sedate by containing its revolutionary Doctrine within Boxular layout.
The Editor in Chief has infected our ears with the Music of the Mainstream Bourgeoisie Society.
TTie Editor in Chief has actively prevented the Dissemination of the Commissionary Vanguard's Message of Revolution.
We, therefore, the Representatives of Intermission, in (leneral Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Editors of Intermissions Past
for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good Kditors of this Section, solemnly publish and de
clare, That Intermission is, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent, that it is Absolved from all Allegiance to The Stanford
Daily, and that all journalistic connection between them and The Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation, is and ought to be total
ly dissolved; and that as a Free and Independent Publication, they have full Power to levy Movie Reviews, conclude Party Snoop
ing, establish a Communist State, and to do ail other Acts and Things which Independent Publications may of right do.
And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Intermissionary Providence, we mutually pledge
to each other our Lives, our Golf Clubs and our sacred File-Cabinet-Packed Cubiele.
