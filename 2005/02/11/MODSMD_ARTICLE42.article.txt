## One more reason to keep your pants on And look ridiculously good while doing it... 
### DAISY CHUNG INTERMISSION STYLE CONSULTANT 
"Nothing comes between me and my
Calvins." But when I'm wearing Paper Denim
& Cloth, Yanuk, Earl Jean, or Citizens of Hu
manity, it's a lot harder for me to stick to a sin
gle brand of pants. It's not that Calvin is dear
er to my heart than any of the other makers
are. Really, I'm just looking for an excuse to
try out the ever-widening array of cuts and
washes that denim offers today.

Back in the '80s, Klein spent millions
sending the subliminal message that

brand loyalty was hot. But high-end
denim has adopted a more whimsi

cal philosophy in recent years.
Instead of marketing a
provocative image (Brooke
Shields was a tender 15 when

she did the Calvin Klein commer
cials), companies like Notify and James

create flattering silhouettes with angled back
pockets, couture-worthy cuts and precision
washes that have elevated denim to a new
height of übiquity.
These days, jeans are going where denim

has never gone before. Remember the MTV
movie awards two years ago? Half of the pre
senters were wearing denim. And it wasn't be
cause they couldn't be bothered to dress up
anymore — it's because they looked so damn
good in their Earls. The nice thing about
dressing down is that everyone can do it
(Abercrombie's Chanel-inspired pleated

miniskirt is of course the tasteless

antithesis of this phenome-

non). In fact, everyone
should do it. When asked
why she liked her Earls so
much, freshman Logan Mc-

Clure replied, "They were
the original low-rise jean. And
you only have to try half as hard

to look good."
Exactly. Probably the most

compelling draw is the fact that
quality jeans function as a below-

the-waist makeover. An illusory
lifting of the rear, nipping of the hips
and slimming of the leg — come on.

you know this sounds good. As if that's not
enough, they transition effortlessly between
almost any functions that might desire to at-

tend (except funerals — be
lieve me, I learned my les
son). Whether you're
strolling to the Quad or two
stepping at Kappa Sig, Sev
ens have got you covered.
All in all, new jeans are a
great investment —if you
can get past the initial stick
er shock. A quality pair
these days costs anywhere
from $80 to $300 dollars.
Actually, as a slightly tipsy
freshman divulged, "First
of all, that's not true. And

second of all, they've always cost that much."
It didn't make much sense at the time, but it
turns out she may actually have been right. If
you shop strategically, you can find some for
much less than what you'd pay at Blooming
dale's. I found Earls on sale for $40 on re
volveclothing.com. And high-end jeans have
actually cost that much fora long time. It's just
that they've never been worth it before.
Back in the day when you were forbidden
from wearing jeans to even semi-formal af
fairs, spending $150 only made sense if you

were living the "Dynasty" lifestyle. Now,
high-end denim makes you "love your butt"
(according to Yanuk's Web site) and dresses
up (or down) your everyday look with next to
zero effort. Here's to the fashion world re
penting for its atrocities over the years. Take
advantage of it while it lasts.
Editor's Note: Don't pay $140 for ripped and
frayed jeans when you can get the same "dis
tressed" look by using a cheese grater. Or hunt
for them at www.bluefly.com,www.yoox.com,
www.shopbop.com and eßay.





We were going to make a crack about cracks, but we'll just leave it at that.
