# Beep Beep: Not your little brother's Beep Beep, if you know what we mean
## 
### DREW PETERSON INTERMISSION CORN NUTS SPECIALIST 
Beep Beep is smarter than the av
erage Saddle Creek bear. The band is
so unlike any other from the label
that any notion I had of a "Saddle
Creek sound" was crashed by their
shockingly different style. In what
seems to be Omaha's latest proof that
Saddle Creek still finds voids to be
filled. Beep Beep provides a a post
punk Rockstar energy drink of an
album in its newly-released "Busi
ness Casual."
Beep Beep certainly does not lack
that originality that made the corner
stone of other Saddle Creek bands.
The sound is unlike what its mem
ber's backgrounds might suggest, with
bandmates hailing from The Faint
and Cursive. Chris Hughes' voice has
been described as a mix between
Conor Oberst, Beck, Robert Smith
and Karen O. The album has even

been compared to XTC, Hot Hot
Heat, Wire, Gang of Four or, believe
it or not. The Darkness. Who gets
compared to The Darkness? Beep
Beep's debut "Business Casual"
knocks you over, steals your money
and then helps you up like every
thing's cool.
Intermission recently chatted with
frontman Chris Hughes, who took a
break from downloading Internet |X)rn
to answer a few of our questions.
INTERMISSION: So, Beep Beep —
does your name have anything to do
with the noise that the Road Runner
makes?
CHRIS: No, it doesn't at all. Because
technically the Road Runner goes
"Meep Meep," not "Beep Beep."
INT: Oh. okay. So yeah, what is the
story behind the name Beep Beep?

CHRIS: The
truth is, it is the noise
Eric makes into his pillow when I'm
making love to him. It's just a little
joke we h;fTe with each other. There's
a lot of intimacy expressed between
Eric and I in the bedroom and it trans
lates to our music.
INT: 1 see. I have noticed some of the
sexual vibes to your lyrics. Can you
tell me about what some of the lyrics
mean?
CHRIS: Definitely a sexual vibe.
INT: Tell me about some of the lyrics.
Some songs talk about Internet porn,
for example.
CHRIS: About what?
INT: Um, Internet porn.

CHRIS: That particular
track is describing this girl

paying for college by posing
for Internet porn on web-

sites.

INT: So tell me about the

story behind Beep Beep and
how you guys got together.

CHRIS: Well,

Eric and 1

have
known i
each!
other
fora

while, and I've
known Joel even

longer, and we've
been in bands to-

gether in the past. And for whatever
reason Eric and I had, you know, been
in bands, but then we had not played
music fora while and then we started
fiddling around together with drum

ma
chines
and
stuff.

and de-

cided we

wanted to take

it further. It took us
a year or so to find
an actual drum
mer, because
there is a shortage

in Omaha. We met Michael Sweeney
through a mutual acquaintance, and
he started playing with us. And initial

ly we had a girl playing bass with us,
by the name of Katie Mews, but she
has since left us to go to graduate
school. That's when Joel stepped in to
take her place.
INT: So why Saddle Creek?
CHRIS: Well, we solicited our demo
to several labels, and in the end, all
things considered, we thought that
Saddle Creek would be the best thing
for us. They're our friends, you know,
they're located in our home town, we
really respect the way they run their
label, and. uh, they give us an equi
table split with the money.
INT: When you were writing "Busi
ness Casual," were you yet on the
label?
CHRIS: No, we didn't have the label
when we made it. Eric and I kinda
just... we went into credit card debt
and we just put the recording togeth
er piece mail, with staggered dates
over a long span of time. And we
used that recording to get us on a
label.
INT: Is Joel serving as your manager
now?
CHRIS: Well. Beep Beep doesn't
technically have a manager. Oh, did
you say band member?
INT: No.
CHRIS: Yeah, he's a band member.
Beep Beep doesn't technically have
management, it's run collectively like
a guild.
INT: Like a what?
CHRIS: It is. uh, run collectively.
INT: You've talked about Saddle
Creek not having "one particular
sound." How would you describe
Beep Beep's sound?
CHRIS: I'd probably describe our
sound as being annoying, cranky
post-punk with art rock tendencies.
INT: Is there a method to all the mad
ness of "Business Casual"?

CHRIS: I find there to be a method
to the madness. I find the song struc
tures to follow a formula that 1 iden
tify with and appreciate. So yeah, I
feel that when you red the lyrics
sheet it is pretty straight forward, it's
lyrical prose. I don't think its hidden
with any type of you know, abstract
writing.
INT: Clearly. So one of the reasons I
signed up for this interview was to ask
about your guilty pleasures. So Cindy
Lauper and Phil Collins, eh?
CHRIS: Oh, Phil Collins and Cindy
Lauper? They may have been at the
time that that was written, but since
then we have had many other guilty
pleasures.
INT: Like what?
CHRIS: Well right now I'm enjoying
Corn Nuts as my guilty pleasure.
INT: So that would be what you've
been chewing on between questions?
CHRIS: That's what I've been chew
ing on through this interview.
INT: What flavor, if you don't mind
me asking?
CHRIS: Original. See, there's no
tablecloth dinners when you're on the
road.
INT: I noticed that in a lot of your pic
tures you guys are wearing animal
masks. Would you consider yourself a
wild animal?
CHRIS: I think human beings are es
sentially wild animals. The only thing
that tethers us to society is clothing
and law, but beyond that we're basi
cally the same animals you see hump
ing in an alley.
Editor's Note: We caught Beep Beep
in a blatant lie. The official sound
made by the Looney Tunes character
Road Runner is indeed "Beep Beep"
not "Meep Meep." Check out
www.beepbeep.com if you don't be
lieve us. Also, Beep Beep the band is
playing at Bottom of The Hill in SF
this Saturday. Feb. 12.

used that recording to get us on a
label.
INT: Is Joel serving as your manager
now?
CHRIS: Well. Beep Beep doesn't
technically have a manager. Oh, did
you say band member?
INT: No.
CHRIS: Yeah, he's a band member.
Beep Beep doesn't technically have
management, it's run collectively like
a guild.
INT: Like a what?
CHRIS: It is. uh, run collectively.
INT: You've talked about Saddle
Creek not having "one particular
sound." How would you describe
Beep Beep's sound?
CHRIS: I'd probably describe our
sound as being annoying, cranky
post-punk with art rock tendencies.
INT: Is there a method to all the mad
ness of "Business Casual"?

CHRIS: I find there to be a method
to the madness. I find the song struc
tures to follow a formula that 1 iden
tify with and appreciate. So yeah, I
feel that when you red the lyrics
sheet it is pretty straight forward, it's
lyrical prose. I don't think its hidden
with any type of you know, abstract
writing.
INT: Clearly. So one of the reasons I
signed up for this interview was to ask
about your guilty pleasures. So Cindy
Lauper and Phil Collins, eh?
CHRIS: Oh, Phil Collins and Cindy
Lauper? They may have been at the
time that that was written, but since
then we have had many other guilty
pleasures.
INT: Like what?
CHRIS: Well right now I'm enjoying
Corn Nuts as my guilty pleasure.
INT: So that would be what you've
been chewing on between questions?
CHRIS: That's what I've been chew
ing on through this interview.
INT: What flavor, if you don't mind
me asking?
CHRIS: Original. See, there's no
tablecloth dinners when you're on the
road.
INT: I noticed that in a lot of your pic
tures you guys are wearing animal
masks. Would you consider yourself a
wild animal?
CHRIS: I think human beings are es
sentially wild animals. The only thing
that tethers us to society is clothing
and law, but beyond that we're basi
cally the same animals you see hump
ing in an alley.
Editor's Note: We caught Beep Beep
in a blatant lie. The official sound
made by the Looney Tunes character
Road Runner is indeed "Beep Beep"
not "Meep Meep." Check out

lieve us. Also, Beep Beep the band is
playing at Bottom of The Hill in SF
this Saturday. Feb. 12.

Get your Beep
Beep on on
Beep Beep is smarter than the av
erage Saddle Creek bear. The band is
so unlike any other from the label
that any notion I had of a "Saddle
Creek sound" was crashed by their
shockingly different style. In what
seems to be Omaha's latest proof that
Saddle Creek still finds voids to be
filled. Beep Beep provides a a post
punk Rockstar energy drink of an
album in its newly-released "Busi
ness Casual."
Beep Beep certainly does not lack
that originality that made the corner
stone of other Saddle Creek bands.
The sound is unlike what its mem
ber's backgrounds might suggest, with
bandmates hailing from The Faint
and Cursive. Chris Hughes' voice has
been described as a mix between
Conor Oberst, Beck, Robert Smith
and Karen O. The album has even

been compared to XTC, Hot Hot
Heat, Wire, Gang of Four or, believe
it or not. The Darkness. Who gets
compared to The Darkness? Beep
Beep's debut "Business Casual"
knocks you over, steals your money
and then helps you up like every
thing's cool.
Intermission recently chatted with
frontman Chris Hughes, who took a
break from downloading Internet |X)rn
to answer a few of our questions.
INTERMISSION: So, Beep Beep —
does your name have anything to do
with the noise that the Road Runner
makes?
CHRIS: No, it doesn't at all. Because
technically the Road Runner goes
"Meep Meep," not "Beep Beep."
INT: Oh. okay. So yeah, what is the
story behind the name Beep Beep?

CHRIS: The
truth is, it is the noise
Eric makes into his pillow when I'm
making love to him. It's just a little
joke we h;fTe with each other. There's
a lot of intimacy expressed between
Eric and I in the bedroom and it trans
lates to our music.
INT: 1 see. I have noticed some of the
sexual vibes to your lyrics. Can you
tell me about what some of the lyrics
mean?
CHRIS: Definitely a sexual vibe.
INT: Tell me about some of the lyrics.
Some songs talk about Internet porn,
for example.
CHRIS: About what?
INT: Um, Internet porn.

CHRIS: That particular
track is describing this girl

paying for college by posing
for Internet porn on web-

sites.

INT: So tell me about the

story behind Beep Beep and
how you guys got together.

CHRIS: Well,

Eric and 1

have
known i
each!
other
fora

while, and I've
known Joel even

longer, and we've
been in bands to-

gether in the past. And for whatever
reason Eric and I had, you know, been
in bands, but then we had not played
music fora while and then we started
fiddling around together with drum

ma
chines
and
stuff.

and de-

cided we

wanted to take

it further. It took us
a year or so to find
an actual drum
mer, because
there is a shortage

in Omaha. We met Michael Sweeney
through a mutual acquaintance, and
he started playing with us. And initial

ly we had a girl playing bass with us,
by the name of Katie Mews, but she
has since left us to go to graduate
school. That's when Joel stepped in to
take her place.
INT: So why Saddle Creek?
CHRIS: Well, we solicited our demo
to several labels, and in the end, all
things considered, we thought that
Saddle Creek would be the best thing
for us. They're our friends, you know,
they're located in our home town, we
really respect the way they run their
label, and. uh, they give us an equi
table split with the money.
INT: When you were writing "Busi
ness Casual," were you yet on the
label?
CHRIS: No, we didn't have the label
when we made it. Eric and I kinda
just... we went into credit card debt
and we just put the recording togeth
er piece mail, with staggered dates
over a long span of time. And we
used that recording to get us on a
label.
INT: Is Joel serving as your manager
now?
