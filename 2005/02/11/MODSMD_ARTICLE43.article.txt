# Beep Beep: Not your little brother's Beep Beep, if you know what we mean

### DREW PETERSON INTERMISSION CORN NUTS SPECIALIST 
Beep Beep is smarter than the av
erage Saddle Creek bear. The band is
so unlike any other from the label
that any notion I had of a "Saddle
Creek sound" was crashed by their
shockingly different style. In what
seems to be Omaha's latest proof that
Saddle Creek still finds voids to be
filled. Beep Beep provides a a post
punk Rockstar energy drink of an
album in its newly-released "Busi
ness Casual."
Beep Beep certainly does not lack
that originality that made the corner
stone of other Saddle Creek bands.
The sound is unlike what its mem
ber's backgrounds might suggest, with
bandmates hailing from The Faint
and Cursive. Chris Hughes' voice has
been described as a mix between
Conor Oberst, Beck, Robert Smith
and Karen O. The album has even

been compared to XTC, Hot Hot
Heat, Wire, Gang of Four or, believe
it or not. The Darkness. Who gets
compared to The Darkness? Beep
Beep's debut "Business Casual"
knocks you over, steals your money
and then helps you up like every
thing's cool.
Intermission recently chatted with
frontman Chris Hughes, who took a
break from downloading Internet |X)rn
to answer a few of our questions.
INTERMISSION: So, Beep Beep â€”
does your name have anything to do
with the noise that the Road Runner
makes?
CHRIS: No, it doesn't at all. Because
technically the Road Runner goes
"Meep Meep," not "Beep Beep."
INT: Oh. okay. So yeah, what is the
story behind the name Beep Beep?

CHRIS: The
truth is, it is the noise
Eric makes into his pillow when I'm
making love to him. It's just a little
joke we h;fTe with each other. There's
a lot of intimacy expressed between
Eric and I in the bedroom and it trans
lates to our music.
INT: 1 see. I have noticed some of the
sexual vibes to your lyrics. Can you
tell me about what some of the lyrics
mean?
CHRIS: Definitely a sexual vibe.
INT: Tell me about some of the lyrics.
Some songs talk about Internet porn,
for example.
CHRIS: About what?
INT: Um, Internet porn.

CHRIS: That particular
track is describing this girl

paying for college by posing
for Internet porn on web-

sites.

INT: So tell me about the

story behind Beep Beep and
how you guys got together.

CHRIS: Well,
