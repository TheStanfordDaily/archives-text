### ANASTACIA JUNQUEIRA-DEGARCIA INTERMISSIONCONCERT-GOER 
Kaki King, mercurial and efferves
cent. played two sets a week ago at
Cafe du Nord in San Francisco. At a
feisty five foot zero, the 24-year-old
solo artist hardly cuts an intimidating
figure. But from the first string she
plucked, the crowd was floored. As
King played through the songs from
her new album, to Make Us
Longer," her well-shaped fingers fret
ted, slapped and strummed every inch
of her guitar. The sound of her instru
ment splashed and roared through the
crowded cafe as she emitted intense
sonic energy. Amazingly, she kept her
tiny torso perfectly straight — the in
tensity of her playing was only visible
in her tautly stretched forearms and
her whirling dervish fingertips.
King's stage performance mixed
lyricism with sardonic cynicism. At
the moment the audience most craved
her warm delicate notes, King deliv
ered dissonance. She studded her per
formance with surprise and satire, giv
ing pith and weight to her writhing
melodic riffs.
King has described her composi
tions as "eclectic, unorthodox guitar
music." There arc no words in her
songs, but that doesn't diminish their
energy one bit. A frenzy of fingers
produces a cyclone of sound — it's
something you really have to see to

believe. In an interview with the artist.
I had the opportunity to get to know
the woman behind the sound.
INTERMISSION: You grew up in
Atlanta?
KING: Yeah.
INT: As a kid how did it feel to be a
girl guitarist?
KING: I remember impressing this
one boy at summer camp. He asked
me to play for him and as it turned out
I was better than him and he said, "I
can't think of you in the same way
now."
INT: What made you want to leave
the south for NYU?
KING: Growing up in the suburbs, I
was ready to be around creative
things. In New York City, your life is
completely surrounded by it, turned
over by it.
INT: Who are your favorite
philosophers?
KING: Schopenhauer, Heidegger
and Adorno — especially Adorno.
He's able to use really lofty language
and bring it all down so you under
stand it.
INT: What's the first sensation you

get when you're on stage?
KING: Some part of my brain shuts
down. I'm not totally there. My mind
is wandering, kind of other level of
brain waves. I make a prediction to
the muse, something snaps and it
comes. The more I think about it the
worse it is.
INT: Talk about the style of your
music.
KIN( J: Everything has to be prepared
and resolved. There's music that's just
happy. There is music that is just aton
al, dissonant — I try not to lean on ei
ther too much, but when something
gets too pretty or happy, I always have
to kill the joy somehow.
INT: Do you think you're on the mu
sical vanguard of Generation Y?
KING: Hopefully, yes. I mean I can
only hope that I am able to create in
teresting music and maintain a higher
degree of quality. At the same time, I
try to straddle both worlds-the eso
teric guitar world, where people are
extremely talented and where it's
hard to get credit and the more popu
lar accessible music world that appre
ciates it when I get dressed up to make
an appearance on the Letterman
show. I want to offer something with
content that is flashy, abstract and ac
cessible all at the same time.




Once would have been enough. Meh, but who is counting?

comes. The more I think about it the
worse it is.
INT: Talk about the style of your
music.
KIN( J: Everything has to be prepared
and resolved. There's music that's just
happy. There is music that is just aton
al, dissonant — I try not to lean on ei
ther too much, but when something
gets too pretty or happy, I always have
to kill the joy somehow.
INT: Do you think you're on the mu
sical vanguard of Generation Y?
KING: Hopefully, yes. I mean I can
only hope that I am able to create in
teresting music and maintain a higher
degree of quality. At the same time, I
try to straddle both worlds-the eso
teric guitar world, where people are
extremely talented and where it's
hard to get credit and the more popu
lar accessible music world that appre
ciates it when I get dressed up to make
an appearance on the Letterman
show. I want to offer something with
content that is flashy, abstract and ac
cessible all at the same time.




Once would have been enough. Meh, but who is counting?
