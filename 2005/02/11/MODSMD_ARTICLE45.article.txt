# Ani secedes from mainstream music
## 
### BONNIE JOHNSON INTERMISSION WRITER 
The Righteous Babe juggernaut
rolls on in defiance of capitalism,
patriarchy and major record labels,
and its figurehead is back with her
fourteenth full-length studio re
lease. "Knuckle Down" is the fol
low up to last winter's 100 percent
solo effort "Educated Guess," but
listeners will be glad to know that on
the new record, DiFranco has given
back some of the recording and pro
duction responsibilities to trusted
colleagues. She's a talented enough
songwriter that it's impossible for

her to miss completely â€”
"Educated Guess"

boasted its share of

sassy acoustic

hooks. But some
tracks crossed

the line be
tween raw /
gritty / 10-fi

and peaked
out I badly
recorded /
under-pro
duced.

On her
"Knuckle

Down,"
DiFranco lets

a few musician
friends back in

to join her, with
great results. Bar-

ing all of her teeth in a
huge, laughing smile on

the front cover,
she isn't con-

ceding a thing. Her work on this
album is as strong as ever, whether
it's the graceful orchestral touches
on "Studying Stones," the jazzy
tempest of "Manhole," or the quick,
bouncy riffs of "Lag Time" and
"Knuckle Down." Thankfully, there

is only one
spoken
word track,
"Parame-

ters," which, though well done, is
unspeakably grim. "Paradigm" is an
interesting song that closely follows
the folk tradition, featuring reminis
cences of DiFranco's immigrant
family's political participation that
come poignantly on the heels of her
"Vote Dammit" tour (here's the

part where you resist the urge to
sink irretrievably into a bottomless
depression). Though some other
tracks aren't as exciting, there are
no clunkers on this record.
DiFranco has exerted an incalcu
lable influence on both main
stream and underground music,
changing the ethics and aesthetics
of singer-songwriters for the better
while simultaneously inspiring an
enormous slew of underwhelming
imitators. 1 recently had occasion
to hear some of the latest buzz
bands from the genre she pio
neered ("radical urban folk" or
something like that), and frankly,

they made me want to bang

my head against a wall re
peatedly and thank

the, uh. Collective
Consciousness for

a copy of "Damn
the Torpedoes"

1 finally found
to put into my
headph ones.
So I had to ask
myself, what is
it that Ani
does right?
Here's
the answer:
Even in her

r early years of
amateurish
heavy-handed-

ness, DiFranco ap
proached her subject

matter with an intelli
gence, honesty and sensitiv-

ity that few
admirers

have mustered since. She's never
lost her sense of humor or her skill
for articulating age-old phenomena
in original and poetic ways. And in
recent years her sound and her
lyrics have not only grown more ma
ture and more thoughtful, but they

have also attained a
new level of intima
cy. "Knuckle Down"
doesn't match up to

the epic scope and scale of DiFran
co's critically underrated 2001 dou
ble-concept masterpiece, "Revel
ling / Reckoning." But it's more ac
cessible, and fans of the 2002 re
lease "Evolve" will likely feel at
home in this tight, manageable
album.
