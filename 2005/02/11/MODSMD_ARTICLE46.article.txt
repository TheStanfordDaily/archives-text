### ROXY SASS SEXCESSION GODDESS 
When Roxy thinks of seceding she
thinks of leaving "the man" behind and
wearing hot camouflage pants. I vet's try
some word association. You say "seces
sion," I think "withdrawal" â€” to re
move oneself, as from a bad class. Stamp
that W on your transcript for the "what
ever" sentiment that the sixth grader in

you feels, and stop wasting your time.
Same goes for relationships.
They're like a Stanford class. You can
always find yourself the three-unit,
mildly interesting twice-a-week vari
ety. Those are typical. Then there's
the easy A: easy access, easy ass. What
more could you ask for?
But ask Bush, and he'll admit easy
winnings aren't always the right way
to go. Talk to Clinton, and he'll tell

you that accessibility isn't the best op
tion either. So here come the five-unit
bitches. Sure there's boning and
maybe even bondage, but baby, you'd
better be careful with these. Before
you've figured out what hit you, you'll
go from cramming together lovingly
in your twin-size bed after cramming
F.con all night, to banging your head
against the wall from lack of time to
get vour work done, get you DONR,

and finally get some sleep. Five units
is a big commitment.
Or you may decide midway just to
change the grading basis, and go for
that tempting pass/fail option. Start
slacking and stop visiting during your
lunch break, but maintain those units
for extracurricular purposes. In other
words, you'll still get credit for being
"involved with someone" and you
won't lose that token date for special

dinner, but no one will ever really
know if it's a C+ or A- affair.
So, you busy Stanford bee, don't
fret if your coursework allows little
room to share your life with that spe
cial someone. It's either overrated or
X-rated anyway. Touch those jetting
thumbs together, flash a W, and se
cede from mainstream America's ex
pectations. It's Stanford. We can tai
lor our own majors and relationships.
