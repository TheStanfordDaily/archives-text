# Haryasz hits stride in season's home stretch
## Junior forward credits a more positive outlook for recent success 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
It's a familiar sight on the floor of Maples
Pavilion: junior forward Matt Haryasz shouting
and raising his arms, gesturing for the Sixth Man
Club to turn up the volume. He does it after the
lineups are announced, after he scores, after a
teammate scores, when a Cardinal run forces
the other team to call a timeout. It's the mo
ments when he's not trying to get the crowd in
volved that you know something is wrong.
"I feel like I'm probably the most emotional
guy on the court," Haryasz said. "I really get
fired up. That's just the way I play. I really get
into the game, and I try to get the crowd into it."
Lately, Haryasz has been giving the fans
something to cheer about. In his last six games
he averaged 15.2 points and 10.8 rebounds, a
streak that has included four consecutive dou
ble-doubles and a 20-point, 20-rebound per
formance against Oregon.
The spurt has come after an inconsistent first
half of the season, during which Haryasz's stat
line was as up and down as his pre-game ritual of
hopping around after his name is called. He
would generally follow a good game with a rela
tively poor one, scoring double-digit points in
consecutive games only once in the first 15 con
tests.
The low point came four weeks ago at Cali
fornia, when Haryasz played a season-low 11
minutes, riding the pine for most of the game
with four fouls.
"I personally really tried to look at things in
a more positive light (after the Cal game],"
Haryasz said. "I'm trying not to beat myself up
or get down on the way we're playing."
Head coach Trent Johnson has given
Haryasz more freedom to move around in the
offense, allowing him to score in the post as well
as on the perimeter, where his range extends to
20 feet. And. though he has fouled out twice in
the last four games, Haryasz has also been mak
ing an effort to stay out of foul trouble.
"I think that's big, because you can't put up
numbers if you're on the bench, you know?"

Haryasz said. "I don't try to think about not
fouling, I just try to think about being smart. If I
have to make a play, I will, but if I don't have to
foul I'll just go straight up, try to make my guy
miss the shot."
Johnson stressed that Haryasz has to adjust
to the way the referees are calling the game, to
prevent a bad call from getting under his skin.
"Matt, as we all know, is pretty emotional,"
Johnson said. "I think it's okay to be emotional
as long as you can settle down and understand
what we're trying to do. He gets a lot of fouls for
leaving his feet and being out of position some
times."
Haryasz's energy can work to his advantage.
He is one of the most active players on the
court; his average of 8.8 rebounds per game is
second in the Pacific-10 Conference. He is also
one of the most outgoing players 011 the team,
someone who helps to keep things loose in the
locker room.
But sometimes his exuberance can get the
best of him. Like when he yelled to the bench
during the game at Arizona on Saturday that
he needed the ball after making a couple of
shots.
"Like I told him. duh," Johnson said joking
ly. "We got a real good seat over here. We'll get
you the ball."
Johnson and the rest of the coaching staff are
trying to get Haryasz to channel his emotions on
the court.
"He's got to tell himself, 'Okay, okay. I've
got to settle down now,'" Johnson said. "'Just
because 1 scored off the block or hit my jump
shot doesn't mean I've got to go saluting the
Sixth Man Club.' So we have to call a timeout
and say, let's talk about it."
That is exactly the kind of thing that endears
Haryasz to the fans and to his teammates. It is
also the kind of thing that endears him to John
son. who described an exchange that they had
during Haryasz's big game against Oregon.
"He puts his arm around me," Johnson said,
"and I'm taking him out because he's got two
fouls in the first half. [Matt said.] 'Coach, why
don't you let me continue to kill these guys?' |I
replied,) 'Matthew, it's going to be all right. Will
you have a seat here? Sit down fora while, take
a rest.'
"That's what makes it fun," Johnson said.
"He's been positive and he's a great kid, he re
ally is. At times he's just got to settle down and
let the game come to him."
