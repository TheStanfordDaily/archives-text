# Kimyacioglu closing in on Stanford three-point record
## 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY STAFF WRITER 
Ever since the three-point line was introduced
in basketball, every good team has had at least one
deadly sniper from outside the arc. After 191 treys
and a spot at No. 4 all-time in the Stanford record
books for three-pointers, it's fair to say that the No.
4 women's basketball team's long distance plan has
a name: Sebnem Kimyacioglu.
A 5-foot-11 senior forward, Kimyacioglu has
been a key part of this year's high-powered Stan
ford team.
"Obviously the team has been doing amazingly
well, even with some early losses," Kimyacioglu
said. "In the beginning of the season we'd have
times where the posts would play well, and times
where the guards would play well, but now both
are clicking. It's hard to guard all our weapons."
Even though Kimyacioglu has contributed
more than two assists a game and shot over 30 per
cent from beyond the arc this season, she's a self
critic.
"Personally, I've had some struggles from the
field in terms of my shooting percentage," Kimya
cioglu said. "That's been kind pf a struggle for me
but I feel like I've been contributing in other
areas."
Kimyacioglu is a local player, having played
high school basketball in Mountain View, Calif, at
Pinewood School. There, she was named the 2(KK)-
01 Central Coast Section Player of the Year after
leading her team to the District II title. She aver
aged 21.2 points, 6.9 rebounds, four steals and four
assists a game as a senior to earn Nike Ail-Ameri
can honors.
Kimyacioglu brought high expectations with
her to Stanford.
"Sebnem is an outstanding outside shooter."
head coach Tara VanDerveer said upon Kimya
cioglu's arrival at Stanford. "She is a powerful,
strong fundamental player who fits into our system
very well."
After arriving on the Farm, Kimyacioglu had
the good fortune of playing with, and becoming
friends with, current WNBA player Nicole Powell.
"Nicole is just such an amazing player." Kimya
cioglu said. "When you watch her you have to stop

and watch the things she does because she's so tal
ented. She makes the people around her so much
better because she's such a great passer with great
vision."
This year's team has managed just fine with
out Powell so far, utilizing a more team-oriented
dynamic.
"Last year [Powell] was a dominant player, the
definite go-to player," Kimyacioglu said. "This
year I feel like we have a few dominant players, but
there is no one go-to player as everyone con
tributes."
Aside from bringing a solid basketball mind and
a hot three-point shooting hand to the team. Kimy
acioglu has fit in seamlessly as a teammate during
her run at Stanford.
"There are so many funny moments, our team
is just a bunch of goofs," Kimyacioglu said. "We
have a lot of fun, everyday in practice we're
laughing at something else. Even the coaches are
in on it."
After the conclusion of the season, Kimya
cioglu still won't be done with basketball. A dual
citizen of both the United States and Turkey, she
hopes to go to Turkey in the summer and play on
the Turkish national team.
"If all goes as planned hopefully I'll be playing
in the European championships in September,"
she said.
But leaving Stanford basketball for any either
program clearly won't be the same.
"I wouldn't change anything on this team,"
Kimyacioglu said. "The relationships I've formed
are going to last a really long time. I'm just going to
treasure those moments because even if I do pur
sue basketball in the future, it won't be the same.
It'll be a job, whereas this is just fun."
It's interesting to note that Kimyacioglu was
close to almost never pursuing basketball. A first
degree black-belt in Tae Kwon Do, Kimyacioglu
only had enough time for either Tae Kwon Do or
basketball, but not both.
"I 'dropped Tae Kwon Do in middle school
when I had to choose between it and basket
ball," said Kimyacioglu. "I'm very happy with
that decision."
Undoubtedly, so is the Stanford basketball
program.

LINDSAY COLEMAN/ The Stanford Daily
Senior forward Sebnem Kimyacioglu is a key component to the Stanford women's team-oriented game
plan, as she is one of the squad's most potent three-point shooters.
Ever since the three-point line was introduced
in basketball, every good team has had at least one
deadly sniper from outside the arc. After 191 treys
and a spot at No. 4 all-time in the Stanford record
books for three-pointers, it's fair to say that the No.
4 women's basketball team's long distance plan has
a name: Sebnem Kimyacioglu.
A 5-foot-11 senior forward, Kimyacioglu has
been a key part of this year's high-powered Stan
ford team.
"Obviously the team has been doing amazingly
well, even with some early losses," Kimyacioglu
said. "In the beginning of the season we'd have
times where the posts would play well, and times
where the guards would play well, but now both
are clicking. It's hard to guard all our weapons."
Even though Kimyacioglu has contributed
more than two assists a game and shot over 30 per
cent from beyond the arc this season, she's a self
critic.
"Personally, I've had some struggles from the
field in terms of my shooting percentage," Kimya
cioglu said. "That's been kind pf a struggle for me
but I feel like I've been contributing in other
areas."
Kimyacioglu is a local player, having played
high school basketball in Mountain View, Calif, at
Pinewood School. There, she was named the 2(KK)-
01 Central Coast Section Player of the Year after
leading her team to the District II title. She aver
aged 21.2 points, 6.9 rebounds, four steals and four
assists a game as a senior to earn Nike Ail-Ameri
can honors.
Kimyacioglu brought high expectations with
her to Stanford.
"Sebnem is an outstanding outside shooter."
head coach Tara VanDerveer said upon Kimya
cioglu's arrival at Stanford. "She is a powerful,
strong fundamental player who fits into our system
very well."
After arriving on the Farm, Kimyacioglu had
the good fortune of playing with, and becoming
friends with, current WNBA player Nicole Powell.
"Nicole is just such an amazing player." Kimya
cioglu said. "When you watch her you have to stop

and watch the things she does because she's so tal
ented. She makes the people around her so much
better because she's such a great passer with great
vision."
This year's team has managed just fine with
out Powell so far, utilizing a more team-oriented
dynamic.
"Last year [Powell] was a dominant player, the
definite go-to player," Kimyacioglu said. "This
year I feel like we have a few dominant players, but
there is no one go-to player as everyone con
tributes."
Aside from bringing a solid basketball mind and
a hot three-point shooting hand to the team. Kimy
acioglu has fit in seamlessly as a teammate during
her run at Stanford.
"There are so many funny moments, our team
is just a bunch of goofs," Kimyacioglu said. "We
have a lot of fun, everyday in practice we're
laughing at something else. Even the coaches are
in on it."
After the conclusion of the season, Kimya
cioglu still won't be done with basketball. A dual
citizen of both the United States and Turkey, she
hopes to go to Turkey in the summer and play on
the Turkish national team.
"If all goes as planned hopefully I'll be playing
in the European championships in September,"
she said.
But leaving Stanford basketball for any either
program clearly won't be the same.
"I wouldn't change anything on this team,"
Kimyacioglu said. "The relationships I've formed
are going to last a really long time. I'm just going to
treasure those moments because even if I do pur
sue basketball in the future, it won't be the same.
It'll be a job, whereas this is just fun."
It's interesting to note that Kimyacioglu was
close to almost never pursuing basketball. A first
degree black-belt in Tae Kwon Do, Kimyacioglu
only had enough time for either Tae Kwon Do or
basketball, but not both.
"I 'dropped Tae Kwon Do in middle school
when I had to choose between it and basket
ball," said Kimyacioglu. "I'm very happy with
that decision."
Undoubtedly, so is the Stanford basketball
program.
