## Branner cancels Zuckerberg talk 
### SHIRIN SHARIF MANAGING EDITOR 
Thefacebook.com creator Mark Zucker
berg has learned the hard way about the im
portance of planning in advance'.
He was forced to cancel his national Beirut
tournament after receiving criticism from
schools and advertisers about his alleged con
doning of underage drinking, and he was also
removed from a speaking engagement at
Branner Hall on Jan. 31.
Zuckerberg was scheduled to speak at
"Branner Presents," a monthly speaker series
at the all-freshman dorm, five days after The
Daily reported on Jan. 26 about Theface
book.conVs Beirut tournament.
Zuckerberg told The Daily that he re
ceived an e-mail about the cancellation and
was advised "to be more socially conscious"
in the future. When Zuckerberg asked for
clarification, he was told by junior Rob Liu,
the resident assistant in charge of the speaker
series, that the line was included in the e-mail
"for the benefit of the administration."

Zuckerberg would not provide a copy of the
e-mail to The Daily.
Resident assistants and Resident Fellow
Kennell Jackson, associate professor of histo
ry, have repeatedly refused requests to talk to
The Daily. Some residents have also refused
to comment because they said they had re
ceived instructions from their residence staff
not to talk to The Daily.
Jane Camarillo, director of Residential
Education, denied any direct involvement in
the decision to prevent Zuckerberg from
speaking on campus.
"I do not typically play a role in approving
speakers for any individual residence and did
not in this case, either," Camarillo said. She
added that the residence staff at Branner re
quested funding for the event but her office
denied the request because the event "did not
fall within the parameters of allocating that
funding."
Zuckerberg. when told about Camarillo's
statement, said that he was confused because
he had planned to speak tree of
charge.
"I wouldn't take money to do a
little talk like that." Zuckerberg
said. "It's weird that they're saying
they needed a budget."
A Branner RA. who asked to re
main anonymous, also said that no
funds were needed to bring Zucker
berg to campus, but later retracted
the statement in an e-mail written to
The Daily, stating that he "mis
spoke," and confirmed Camarillo's
story.
Camarillo explained that the de
cision to invite or cancel speakers is
left to program planners, who take
into consideration their students and
institutional objectives for program
ming.
"The staff at Branner are very
conscientious in keeping true to

their goals," Camarillo said.
A freshman resident who asked
to remain anonymous said that he
heard the talk was canceled because
of Thefacehook.corn's national
Beirut tournament.
"I think one of the RAs said that,
because the RF sees the tournament
as supporting binge drinking, he did
not want Mark to speak," he said.
Jackson would not confirm or
deny this statement.
Part of Zuckerberg's reasoning
for canceling the controversial
tournament was his desire to main
tain good relationships with uni
versities.
"The reason we were running the
tournament was because we thought
it was cool, so when there were lots
of problems with it we figured we
should just take it down before any
thing got out of hand," Zuckerberg
said. "We didn't want to pick any
battles with people."
By the time the tournament was
cancelled, on Jan. 29. a few thou
sand people had already signed up

— including more than 50 teams
from Stanford. All of their money
has been refunded, Zuckerberg
said.
The launch of the tournament it
self had been delayed due to legal
problems with the New York Attor
ney General. The state has a law
stipulating that an event giving away
prizes of over $5,000 per person has
to be registered in advance.
To be able to hold the national
tournament in New York, Zucker
berg had to reduce the prize monies
to $ 10,000 per team, which would in
clude prize money won in intra-col
lege tournaments.
"Our general take on it is that we
didn't plan far enough in advance,"
Zuckerberg said. "There were a lot
more people to take into account
than the people over 21 who would
be drinking."
Future site plans for Theface
book.com include a faster speed and
a new party feature that will allow
students to register parties and in
vite their friends.

Resident assistants and Resident Fellow
Kennell Jackson, associate professor of histo
ry, have repeatedly refused requests to talk to
The Daily. Some residents have also refused
to comment because they said they had re
ceived instructions from their residence staff
not to talk to The Daily.
Jane Camarillo, director of Residential
Education, denied any direct involvement in
the decision to prevent Zuckerberg from
speaking on campus.
"I do not typically play a role in approving
speakers for any individual residence and did
not in this case, either," Camarillo said. She
added that the residence staff at Branner re
quested funding for the event but her office
denied the request because the event "did not
fall within the parameters of allocating that
funding."
Zuckerberg. when told about Camarillo's
statement, said that he was confused because
he had planned to speak tree of
charge.
"I wouldn't take money to do a
little talk like that." Zuckerberg
said. "It's weird that they're saying
they needed a budget."
A Branner RA. who asked to re
main anonymous, also said that no
funds were needed to bring Zucker
berg to campus, but later retracted
the statement in an e-mail written to
The Daily, stating that he "mis
spoke," and confirmed Camarillo's
story.
Camarillo explained that the de
cision to invite or cancel speakers is
left to program planners, who take
into consideration their students and
institutional objectives for program
ming.
"The staff at Branner are very
conscientious in keeping true to

their goals," Camarillo said.
A freshman resident who asked
to remain anonymous said that he
heard the talk was canceled because
of Thefacehook.corn's national
Beirut tournament.
"I think one of the RAs said that,
because the RF sees the tournament
as supporting binge drinking, he did
not want Mark to speak," he said.
Jackson would not confirm or
deny this statement.
Part of Zuckerberg's reasoning
for canceling the controversial
tournament was his desire to main
tain good relationships with uni
versities.
"The reason we were running the
tournament was because we thought
it was cool, so when there were lots
of problems with it we figured we
should just take it down before any
thing got out of hand," Zuckerberg
said. "We didn't want to pick any
battles with people."
By the time the tournament was
cancelled, on Jan. 29. a few thou
sand people had already signed up

— including more than 50 teams
from Stanford. All of their money
has been refunded, Zuckerberg
said.
The launch of the tournament it
self had been delayed due to legal
problems with the New York Attor
ney General. The state has a law
stipulating that an event giving away
prizes of over $5,000 per person has
to be registered in advance.
To be able to hold the national
tournament in New York, Zucker
berg had to reduce the prize monies
to $ 10,000 per team, which would in
clude prize money won in intra-col
lege tournaments.
"Our general take on it is that we
didn't plan far enough in advance,"
Zuckerberg said. "There were a lot
more people to take into account
than the people over 21 who would
be drinking."
Future site plans for Theface
book.com include a faster speed and
a new party feature that will allow
students to register parties and in
vite their friends.
Thefacebook.com creator Mark Zucker
berg has learned the hard way about the im
portance of planning in advance'.
He was forced to cancel his national Beirut
tournament after receiving criticism from
schools and advertisers about his alleged con
doning of underage drinking, and he was also
removed from a speaking engagement at
Branner Hall on Jan. 31.
Zuckerberg was scheduled to speak at
"Branner Presents," a monthly speaker series
at the all-freshman dorm, five days after The
Daily reported on Jan. 26 about Theface
book.conVs Beirut tournament.
Zuckerberg told The Daily that he re
ceived an e-mail about the cancellation and
was advised "to be more socially conscious"
in the future. When Zuckerberg asked for
clarification, he was told by junior Rob Liu,
the resident assistant in charge of the speaker
series, that the line was included in the e-mail
"for the benefit of the administration."

Zuckerberg would not provide a copy of the
e-mail to The Daily.
