# Alumni host students for career advice over meals
## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
For the second consecutive year, the Stanford
Alumni Association and the Student Leadership
Society have organized lunches and dinners to
connect current Stanford students with alumni
working in various fields.
Natalie Siston, the program coordinator for
the Alumni Association's Student & Young
Alumni Outreach, said this networking event is a
great opportunity for students, both past and pre
sent.
"We are organizing these lunches ifnd dinners
because we recognize that we have this huge re
source of over 180.000 living alumni and about
60;()00 of them live right here in the Bay Area,"
she said. "We're always contacted by alumni say
ing that they want to meet students."
Students also have expressed interest in learn
ing from the experiences of former students, Sis
ton added.
Director of Student & Young Alumni Out
reach Victor Madrigal said students have a lot to
gain from attending these events.
"Students who avail themselves of these op
portunities to connect and network with alumni
are a step ahead," Madrigal said. "They've start
ed early on a support network that they can tap
for information, guidance, ideas and possibly
even job opportunities."
Alumni also get a lot out of these interactions,
he added.

'it is about reconnecting with the students at
Stanford," said Jorge Tapias, director of Student
& Alumni development, who held a dinner at his
home last year.
Alumni hosting and co-hosting events include
investment bankers, consultants, lawyers, teach
ers and freelance writers, student coordinators
said.
"We have a wealth of alumni from many dif
ferent career backgrounds, which is why this is
such an amazing chance for undergrads to learn
about different industries," said junior Stephanie
Tsai, a member of the Student Leadership Soci
ety. "For instance, Yahoo is hosting a lunch at
their offices. This is not an opportunity that pre
sents itself often."
The lunches will take place at local restaurants
and businesses while the dinner meetings will be
field at alumni homes. Siston stated that the
lunches and dinners vary slightly because many of
the alumni participants at a lunch are from the
same company, while at the dinners the alumni
represent a variety of career backgrounds.
"I would say the lunches might have more of
a career focus whereas the dinners might have
more of a life-after-Stanford focus," Siston said.
The informal nature of both the lunches and
the dinners is key to their success, Tsai said.
"The lunches and dinners provide an inti
mate and casual setting in which students and
alumni can converse and have a really meaning-
ful exchange," she said. "It's a more
comfortable situation for students es
pecially, who might otherwise be in
timidated by approaching alumni one
on one."
According toTapias, there was a lot
of discussion about the students'career
ambitions at the dinner he hosted last
year.
"We talked about careers, career

choices and how careers relate to ma
jors," he said. "Several students who at
tended were interested in academia
and my wife Molly is in a Ph.D. pro
gram so we discussed that."
Freshman Cathy Sun, who has al
ready signed up fora lunch, said she is
enthusiastic about talking with her
group of alumni.
"Just to get a sense of how they
found their place and how they realized
what their passion in life is," she said.
"It's just a really good opportunity to
get another person's perspective and
see how they progressed from where I
am today to where they are."
