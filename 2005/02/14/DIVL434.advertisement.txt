Tfre Blackboard and the Bottom Line
by Larry Cuban
"Ford Motor Company would not have survived the competition had it not been for an
emphasis on results. We must view education the same way," the U.S. Secretary of
Education declared in 2003.
Kut is he right? In this provocative new hook, Larry Cuban takes aim at the alluring cliche
that schools should be more businesslike, and shows that in its long history in
business minded America, no one has shown that a business model can be successfully
applied to education. Not only are schools by their nature not businesslike, Cuban
argues, but the attempt to run them along business lines leads to dangerous over
standardization of tests, and of goals for our children. Why should we think that there is
such a thing as one best school?
Larry Cuban is Professor of Education at Stanford University and past president of the
American Educational Research Association.

the lobotomist
I* <a tkr « .IJ mr> t*l l//«r
■HHHi
The lobotomy is probably the most controversial and infamous medical procedure in his
tory. Little is widely known about Walter Freeman, the man who brought its practice to
America, and a man that many call a monster. However, El-Hai has assembled a portrait
in The Lobotomist much different from Freeman's image today as an atrocious and even
criminal physician -• that of a brilliant doctor, determined to develop a treatment for
seemingly hopeless mental patients, whose many flaws drove him to continue using a
promising procedure much longer than he should have.
The Lobotomist is the result of F.l Hai's examination of thousands of letters, reports, and
medical records among Freeman's papers at George Washington University, as well as
interviews with Freeman's three living children.

Lot's Daughters by Robert Polhemus
Lot's Daughters explores the relationship of fathers and daughters and of older men and
younger females in history, life, art, and culture. This ambitious, daringly original book
shows how humanity has remembered and been formed by Lot's daughters how the
shocking biblical text describing the crucial relationship between that patriarch and his
daughters has haunted the human imagination and shaped history and behavior right
down to the present. Robert Polhemus terms this ongoing human drama the mutual
attraction between young females and older males the "Lot complex," and illustrates
his theory with a wide-ranging series of portraits that analyze and dramatize the lives
and work of famous men and women who, in very diverse ways, have made the world
care more deeply about the destiny of daughters.
Robert M. Polhemus is Chair of the English Department and Joseph S. Atha Professor in
Humanities at Stanford University.
