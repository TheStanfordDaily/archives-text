Blink brilliantly illuminates an
aspect of our mental lives that
we utterly rely on yet rarely
analyze - our ability to make
snap decisions or quick
judgments.
An exploration of heartfelt
community involvement
that leads beyond despair
to compassion and hope.

civilizations of the past to collapse
into ruin, and what can we learn
from their fates?
