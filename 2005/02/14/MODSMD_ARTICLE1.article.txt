# New quad to be built
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Construction of a new 8.2-acre
science and engineering quad,
called SEQ2, is scheduled to
begin in July, 2006, beginning
with the groundbreaking of a an
environment and energy build
ing. Construction on the quad
rangle is expected to be complet
ed in 2014.
The new structure will be built
next to the existing quad, or SEQ.
and will require at least the de
molition of the applied physics
building and the Gravity Probe B
project structure.
"The new quad will house four
buildings, two of which are re
placements for buildings which
will be torn down and two of
which will house new University
wide initiatives," said Jim Plum
mer, dean of the School of Engi
neering. "These initiatives are
the Institute for the Environment
and the new Bioengineering De
partment."
The project is projected to cost
between $375 million and $420

million, and will be funded by
long-term debt, gifts and re
serves. The University first la
beled construction of SEQ2 a top
priority three years ago, and since
then, the Department of Land
and Buildings has teamed with
the Development Office to de
sign a practical plan.
Students who regularly pass
through the current quad on the
way to classes and labs said there
is obvious need for the remodel
ing.
"The existing SEQ is defi
cient," said Christian Karega, a
junior majoring in management
science and engineering. "It does
not unify all the science and engi
neering departments. Many of
the buildings, such as physics and
chemistry, are outdated and there
is no single place where the sci
ence and engineering students
can get together."
Karega added that the current
space makes it difficult to estab
lish a sense of community among
engineering and science students.
