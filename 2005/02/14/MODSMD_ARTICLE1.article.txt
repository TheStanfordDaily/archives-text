# New quad to be built
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Construction of a new 8.2-acre
science and engineering quad,
called SEQ2, is scheduled to
begin in July, 2006, beginning
with the groundbreaking of a an
environment and energy build
ing. Construction on the quad
rangle is expected to be complet
ed in 2014.
The new structure will be built
next to the existing quad, or SEQ.
and will require at least the de
molition of the applied physics
building and the Gravity Probe B
project structure.
"The new quad will house four
buildings, two of which are re
placements for buildings which
will be torn down and two of
which will house new University
wide initiatives," said Jim Plum
mer, dean of the School of Engi
neering. "These initiatives are
the Institute for the Environment
and the new Bioengineering De
partment."
The project is projected to cost
between $375 million and $420

million, and will be funded by
long-term debt, gifts and re
serves. The University first la
beled construction of SEQ2 a top
priority three years ago, and since
then, the Department of Land
and Buildings has teamed with
the Development Office to de
sign a practical plan.
Students who regularly pass
through the current quad on the
way to classes and labs said there
is obvious need for the remodel
ing.
"The existing SEQ is defi
cient," said Christian Karega, a
junior majoring in management
science and engineering. "It does
not unify all the science and engi
neering departments. Many of
the buildings, such as physics and
chemistry, are outdated and there
is no single place where the sci
ence and engineering students
can get together."
Karega added that the current
space makes it difficult to estab
lish a sense of community among
engineering and science students.

Plans were released for the new engineering quad, SEQ2, which will fea
ture four buildings, including one for the department of bioengineering
"The Hewlett and Packard buildings
are nice but don't fully express the ex
citement of the science and engineer
ing departments," said Myles Sumlin, a
senior majoring in electrical engineer
ing. "There are a lot of great projects
[completed in these buildings] and this
campus has a history of making impacts
on the world in those fields. Unfortu
nately. the buildings aren't very attrac
tive."
Several graduate students also said
that the changes are necessary.
"I feel that except for Packard,
Hewlett, Gates and Durand, the other
buildings are very old and need infra
structural improvement, especially the
mbdular structures such as Redwood

on Via Ortega," said Soubhik Dawn, an
electrical engineering graduate stu
dent. "Personally, I feel that the new
SEQ is a great idea. But even then, I
feel that 1 will not be using it for any
thing else other than academic and ca
reer reasons."
According to Plummer, construction
will be handled to minimize any disrup
tion to residents in surrounding build
ings. Yet some are still concerned about
the potential disturbance.
"I am a little worried about the situa
tion during the construction process,"
Dawn said. "It will definitely cause a lot
of disturbance and inconvenience to stu
dents and researchers. And I guess it
might even cause students to not come to
Stanford from 2(X)6 to 2014, when the
construction is going on. So the new quad
might affect Stanford's performance
temporarily."
Despite potential drawbacks, many
others said they are excited by the plans

for SEO2.
"The new science and engineering
quad will be a fantastic addition to the
Stanford campus and will provide much
needed facilities for the newly estab
lished Department of Bioengineering,"
said Scott Delp, chair of the bioengineer
ing department. "It provides a model for
how campus planning should be done."
Karega concurred with Delp.
"I think the new quad is an excellent
idea," he said. "If I were a student when
it was finished. I would definitely take
advantage of the facility not only for
class but also to hang out or study."
Sumlin said he believes that the pro
ject continues to feed off the excitement
generated by the opening of the James
H. Clark Center in October 2003.
"The University is recognizing that
we are in a very important time in human
history and the biggest changes will be in
tech and science," Sumlin said. "Howev
er, it is the collaboration of these fields

that will make a difference. This is why
the University is promoting joint pro
jects between biology, engineering,
chemistry, medicine, psychology, com
puter science, etc."
He added, "I wish I was a few years
younger and could have the opportunity
to be here for all the changes."
In the long-run. Dawn said it is likely
the new quad will attract even more stu
dents to Stanford.
"Personally, I was impressed by the
Packard building when I decided to do
electrical engineering at Stanford," he
said. "And the new buildings will also at
tract the best faculty and staff to an al
ready prestigious university."
Paul Gurney, a doctoral candidate in
electrical engineering, said. "It will be
fun to watch the buildings go up over the
next eight years. New, high-tech build
ings and facilities really add to the feeling
that we're on the cutting edge here at
Stanford."
