On Feb. 14.1941, The Daily ran a
story about Melville Jacoby, a for
mer Stanford graduate who was ar
rested by Japanese soldiers while
working for the United Press. Below
is an excerpt:
"Melville J. Jacoby, who tucked a
master's degree from the Stanford
Division of Journalism into his pock
et in 1939 and traveled to the Orient
to become a United Press corre
spondent in Indo-China, returned to
the Farm for a short visit yesterday.
"While working for the press as
sociation Mr. Jacoby was arrested
with American Vice-Consul Robert
W. Rinden at Haiphong Nov. 21,
1940 by Japanese soldiers for pic
ture-taking, and became the subject
of a protest to Tokyo by Secretary of
State Cordell Hull.

"Mr. Jacoby yesterday related
the circumstances of his arrest to Dr.
Chilton R. Bush, head of the Divi
sion of Journalism.
"The Stanford journalist accom
panied the vice-consul from Hanoi
to observe seizure by Japanese
troops of warehouses, thwarting
movement of some $15,000,000
worth of American trucks, radio
gear and bar stuff to Free China.
"When he sought to take a pic
ture of the occupation, both he and
the government official were arrest
ed, but were later released with a de
mand they apologize. They didn't
and announced they were returning
to the United States.
"The newsman, who expects to
return to the Orient, said living con
ditions were 'tough.' Jacoby re-

ceived his BAin 1938 and is a mem
ber of the Stanford chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi."
On Feb. 14.1951, The Daily pub
lished an article about recent draft
law revisions made by the Selective
Service. Below are excerpts:
"The new ruling provides a 30-
day postponement of induction fol
lowing the end of the school year for
students subject to the draft.
"Students who have received
their induction notices and would
normally be drafted immediately
after finishing out the school year
may now have 30 days after the last
day of school this spring in which to
enlist.
"Selective Service officials
changed the rule because they felt
that the new policy will allow stu
dents to devote the entire final
month to studies without any enlist
ment problems hanging overhead.
"Enlistments may be in any spec
ified branch of the armed forces, in
cluding the Coast Guard.
"Meanwhile, Sen. Lyndon B.
Johnson (D-Tex.), warned the Sen
ate Armed Services Committee
today that there is a 'great and im
mediate' need for an 18-year-old
draft now if Congress wants to avoid
inducting veterans and fathers."
