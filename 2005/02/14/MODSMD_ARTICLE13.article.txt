## This Book Will Change My Life, Goddammit 
### 
I am a loser. It is official. I learned
this while browsing the self-help sec
tion of the public library. I wasn't re
ally looking there. It just bled into
the section on human behavioral bi
ology. That damn Dewey decimal
system tricked me into picking up
the book on underachievers and
reading profiles of awkward, mousy,
imperceptive, humorless people.
1 recognized myself in all of them.

As a for
mer home
schooler
and an
early-en
trance col
lege stu
dent — the
stereotypes
are all true
— I'm dou
bly victim
to these un
fortunate
social hand-

icaps.
Of course, while at Stanford, I've
finally lost some of the naivete 1 had
at 15. 1 no longer ask why my RA
burns so much incense or where they
get those funny-shaped. longish bal
loons at Flicks. Nonetheless, I'm a
long way from the top of the social
order.
So this New Year's, 1 resolved to
be cool. I've taken a lot of notes over
the years on what makes the cool
kids cool, and the one unifying fac
tor, it seems, is their willingness to
do whatever they want and worry
about selling it afterward.
Act first, think later. It's a psy
chological game: the stronger mind
will decide what's hip, and the weak
er mind will buy in.
I understand this principle, but
it's hard to apply. As a long-time
loser, I have a hard time altering my
mindset, and there are also limits on
how weak other people's minds can
be. For instance, no matter how
much confidence 1 tried to express
over standing on a fire hydrant and
directing pedestrian traffic, no one
thought it was cool. Live and learn, 1
guess.
1 figured a self-help book might
catch me up on my social develop
ment and 1 found one while sitting in
Urban Outfitters. 1 bought it partly
because I figure Urban Outfitters is
all about being young and hip, and
partly because when 1 sit in those
giant dish chairs I suddenly find my
self willing to buy anything. This in
cludes Shot Tac Toe, even though
I'm not cool enough to handle shots.
But what book did I get? That is
exactly what my friend Haps asked
me.
"This Book Will Change Your
Life," I said.
"Okay," she said, "but what
book?"
"This Book Will Change Your
Life" contains 365 pages of cool
graphics with random daily tasks -
my favorite is the page with a small
box and instructions to "lure a fly
here and swat it."
Doing such things, claim the au
thors. Benrik (that's Ben and Hen
rik — clever), will not only change
my life, but instigate a lifetime full of
change. Positive change, I hope,
though I'm starting to have my sus
picions.
Some of the days 1 checked off
right away, such as Day 18, "kill
something day," thanks to a recent
ant infestation. I've also done Day 8,
"addiction-free day," because I'm
not cool enough to have any addic
tions, though I hope 1 will soon. Day
30, "ignore today," was an easy one.
too.
Among the tasks I still have to
catch up on: Day 29, on which I will
read a dense, page-long sermon in a
deep Southern accent to someone at
a random phone number. Also. Day
22, on which I will try to convince
someone I don't know to meet up
with me in ten years' time.
If you don't know me, drop me a
line, in ten years, my life will have
changed and I'll be so cool. Preter
naturally cool, cool like Marlon
Brando, back when he was cool. I
have it on the word of Ben and Hen
rik. But you'll have to show up in ten
years to see.

giant dish chairs I suddenly find my

I'm not cool enough to handle shots.
But what book did I get? That is
exactly what my friend Haps asked
me.
"This Book Will Change Your
Life," I said.
"Okay," she said, "but what
book?"
"This Book Will Change Your
Life" contains 365 pages of cool
graphics with random daily tasks -
my favorite is the page with a small
box and instructions to "lure a fly
here and swat it."
Doing such things, claim the au
thors. Benrik (that's Ben and Hen
rik — clever), will not only change
my life, but instigate a lifetime full of
change. Positive change, I hope,

right away, such as Day 18, "kill

ant infestation. I've also done Day 8,
"addiction-free day," because I'm

30, "ignore today," was an easy one.
too.
Among the tasks I still have to
catch up on: Day 29, on which I will
read a dense, page-long sermon in a
deep Southern accent to someone at
a random phone number. Also. Day
22, on which I will try to convince
someone I don't know to meet up
with me in ten years' time.
If you don't know me, drop me a
line, in ten years, my life will have
changed and I'll be so cool. Preter
naturally cool, cool like Marlon

I am a loser. It is official. I learned
this while browsing the self-help sec
tion of the public library. I wasn't re
ally looking there. It just bled into
the section on human behavioral bi
ology. That damn Dewey decimal
system tricked me into picking up
the book on underachievers and
reading profiles of awkward, mousy,
imperceptive, humorless people.
1 recognized myself in all of them.

As a for
mer home
schooler
and an
early-en
trance col
lege stu
dent — the
stereotypes
are all true
— I'm dou
bly victim
to these un
fortunate
social hand-

icaps.
Of course, while at Stanford, I've
finally lost some of the naivete 1 had
at 15. 1 no longer ask why my RA
burns so much incense or where they
get those funny-shaped. longish bal
loons at Flicks. Nonetheless, I'm a
long way from the top of the social
order.
So this New Year's, 1 resolved to
be cool. I've taken a lot of notes over
the years on what makes the cool
kids cool, and the one unifying fac
tor, it seems, is their willingness to
do whatever they want and worry
about selling it afterward.
Act first, think later. It's a psy
chological game: the stronger mind
will decide what's hip, and the weak
er mind will buy in.
I understand this principle, but
it's hard to apply. As a long-time
loser, I have a hard time altering my
mindset, and there are also limits on
how weak other people's minds can
be. For instance, no matter how
much confidence 1 tried to express
over standing on a fire hydrant and
directing pedestrian traffic, no one
thought it was cool. Live and learn, 1
guess.
1 figured a self-help book might
catch me up on my social develop
ment and 1 found one while sitting in
Urban Outfitters. 1 bought it partly
because I figure Urban Outfitters is
all about being young and hip, and
partly because when 1 sit in those
giant dish chairs I suddenly find my
self willing to buy anything. This in
cludes Shot Tac Toe, even though
I'm not cool enough to handle shots.
But what book did I get? That is
exactly what my friend Haps asked
