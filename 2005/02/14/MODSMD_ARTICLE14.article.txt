Send any flowers to yourself recently? Find yourself spending an in
ordinate amount of time at your TA's office hours, just to have some
one-on-one contact with the opposite sex? Feel lonely, depressed,
worthless, dejected or all of the above?
Congratulations. You're single on Valentine's Day.
Not a holiday for the faint of heart, the "date-or-die" atti
tude that is usually associated with the day causes many a
Stanford student to end up as Hallmark-aisle road kill.
And as for those who say there's no dating at Stan
ford, look again, my friend. By Feb. 14. a campus de
fined by random hookups,
"just friends" and

Aretha Franklin-inspired mantras will have fallen victim to a national gim
mick dedicated to celebrating some Christian saint's torturous death.
While being the only person in your I-Hum class not to be serenaded by the
Mendicants today may be humiliating and devastating, most of us would
probably pick it over being beaten to death with clubs and having our heads
chopped off, like the original Valentine.
But have no fear single lads and ladies, you're in good company. Accord
ing to the incredibly trustworthy Thefacebook.com, there are over 1,(XX) male
and 1,()0() female singletons brave enough to declare their relationship status
on the Web site. On the other hand, the number of students from both sexes
who are in a relationship totals only a paltry 1,152.
Safety in numbers can never be overrated. If you think that you're the only
one who can't help but vomit every time you see those Stanford couples who
hold hands even while riding their bikes, think again.
With a little organization and a lot of romantic disillusionment, all 2,000+

of us can band together as prover

bial human bollards to block

ade any more BWIs (Bik

ing While Infatuated).

All kidding
aside, this Valen

tine's Day will
most likely not

make you feel
at your prime,

and while
physical
vengeance

may seem
like the best
solution,
here are ten
other ways to

make the
most of a day
that makes

you feel the
least:
10. Watch

"Fatal Attraction."

Add stalking and

murderous tendencies

to the equation, and it

will be hard for love not to

lose some of its luster.
9. Get the Mendicants

to serenade you with "One is the

Loneliest Number" in the middle

of your English seminar. Never un

derestimate pity's influence on grade

inflation.
8. Get completely decked out in Valen

tine's Day attire. Non-conformist conformity is

so retro.
7. Lose yourself in the glory of fermented grapes.
Alone and comatose is better than alone and miser
able.

6. Buy all the condoms at TresEx. If you're not
going to get any action, no one else should either.
5. Prank call the boys you liked in middle

school. If they don't answer, rest assured that
they're not out celebrating Valentine's Day
either; they're serving time in prison.

4. Write a rant about love and
have it published in The Daily. Trust
me, it works.
3. Get over yourself.
2. Get over yourself.
1. Get over yourself.
