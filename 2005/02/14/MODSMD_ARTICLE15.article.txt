Oh, Valentine's Day.
As if midterms week

wasn't enough,
here's one more

test to prove
you're able to

stick your com
mitments.

I'm not the
most senti
mental of
girls, so this
Hallmark
holiday
doesn't mean
much to me.

whether I
happen to be

in a relation
ship, as I am

now, or not. Usu
ally, the day after

Valentine's Day is
more special to me. I

get to buy a bunch of left
over chocolate on sale for

half price.
I have to admit, though, that

something about the prepackaged

professions of love that line the aisles of

every place of commerce for the month of
February does tug at my heartstrings, remind

ing me that I really do love my honey and should
take the time to show him how I feel.

My boyfriend doesn't seem to have anything
planned for us (Which means he's going to surprise me

with something, right? No, of course not), but to be fair, nei
ther do I. I've racked my brain for a unique way to celebrate V-

Day — and 1 refuse to give in to the cheesy cards and balloons
saturating Safeway right now — but 1 haven't come up with any
thing good.

I thought about baking. Baked goods are pretty sappy, but at least
making them myself would show some sincerity. It occurred to me.

though, that my boyfriend is a better baker than I am, so I scratched that
idea pretty quickly.

With baking out of the picture, 1 was left with nothing, so this week
end I scoured the campus for some last minute way to show my affection.
But damn it, I slept in on Friday. At the very least, I could've gone to
Spencer's Chill Session out in White Plaza to make a card — again,
cheesy, but still better than a Safeway card.
"Come on by for some of that construction paper, ribbons and Mr.
Sketch blueberry-flavored markers," the Class of 2005 e-mail said.
"Make a valentine for your chosen one and maybe they'll choo-choo
choose you too!"
Whatever, at least it would have been better than a card made from
printer paper and highlighters.
So Friday afternoon, I opted for something equally silly but a little
more suggestive — a "pleasure gram" from the Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center.
I made my way to Vaden, satisfied that I had decided on something to
show that at least I hadn't forgotten the holiday. To my dismay, they
were already sold out. At least I got to pick up my free goodies for the
quarter.

There
seemed to

be a lot of V-Day

related activities on

campus that catered to the

politically minded. Today at

noon, for instance, is Freedom to

Marry Day out in White Plaza. And the
Vagina Monologues, of course, can always

be counted on for a good reminder of how to love
the vagina. While I was glad to learn about both of
these events, they didn't really help me with what to
do for my boyfriend.

So now it's Valentine's Day. and I'm left empty-hand
ed and with no plans. Admittedly, I didn't try that hard to
come up with something. However, I won't mind if my
boyfriend doesn't either. As long as we get to spend time to

gether.
It seems like at Stanford, your time is the most valuable gift you
can give anyway. So even if we just curl up together in front of the TV
tonight with a bottle of two-buck chuck and a bag of M&Ms, I'm sure
we'll have a happy Valentine's Day.

I made my way to Vaden, satisfied that I had decided on something to
show that at least I hadn't forgotten the holiday. To my dismay, they
were already sold out. At least I got to pick up my free goodies for the
quarter.

There
seemed to

be a lot of V-Day

related activities on

campus that catered to the

politically minded. Today at

noon, for instance, is Freedom to

Marry Day out in White Plaza. And the
Vagina Monologues, of course, can always

be counted on for a good reminder of how to love
the vagina. While I was glad to learn about both of
these events, they didn't really help me with what to
do for my boyfriend.

So now it's Valentine's Day. and I'm left empty-hand
ed and with no plans. Admittedly, I didn't try that hard to
come up with something. However, I won't mind if my
boyfriend doesn't either. As long as we get to spend time to

gether.
It seems like at Stanford, your time is the most valuable gift you
can give anyway. So even if we just curl up together in front of the TV
tonight with a bottle of two-buck chuck and a bag of M&Ms, I'm sure
we'll have a happy Valentine's Day.
