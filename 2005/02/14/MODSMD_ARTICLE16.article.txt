# Student-designed wall memorializes deceased PA homeless
## 
### JESSICA ZHANG STAFF WRITER 
Homeless people may sometimes go un
noticed in the affluent Palo Alto community,
but the deceased will not be forgotten. The
Office of Religious Life has created an ini
tiative for a Stanford student to create a
memorial wall honoring homeless people
who have died in Palo Alto.
The wall will be located in the recently
created Opportunity Center of Palo Alto,
whose aim is to serve the area's homeless
population. The center seeks to provide a
range of social and medical services, as well
as both temporary and permanent living
space, for those in need.
It will have a variety of rooms, including a
community room for women and children
and a single adults' room.
In that community room for single adults,
there "is a sizable wall which has been left by
the architect for a memorial wall for home

less who have been known in the communi
ty and have died in recent years," said Scot
ty McLennan, dean of religious life.
"Those involved with the project will re
search who those [homeless people] are and
discover as many of them as possible and ap
propriately memorialize them," he said.
"What exactly that wall will look like and
how it will be designed and what will go on it,
we're not quite sure, but we wanted to begin
the work of doing the research."
Sociology Prof. Donald Barr, who has
been active in supporting the Opportunity
Center, proposed the idea for a student to do
such research and receive either indepen
dent study credit with him or have a paid po
sition administered through the Office of
Religious Life.
"The Opportunity Center is as much for
the members of our community who are on
the streets as it is for the homeless members
of our community who have died," Barr said.
Thus far, six students have shown interest

and applied. There is no set deadline, but the
Office for Religious Life said that it would
like to secure all applications by this week.
"[Barr] made the case that part of what
the Office of Religious Life does is commu
nity service and encourage people on cam
pus to be involved in public service as a part
of religious, spiritual, ethical life," McLen
nan said.
An advisory committee, most likely with
participation from Barr, will oversee this
project. Senior Crystal Trujillo, who has
worked with the Veteran's Administration
in the past, will serve as project director for
the memorial wall.
McLennan commends the town of Palo
Alto for providing services to the homeless.
"Palo Alto, to its credit, has been a hos
pitable place to homeless people," he said.
"In other cities, people are harassed and
pushed away by storeowners and police. It's
also credit to Palo Alto for building this Op
portunity Center because there are many

wealthy cities who say "not in my back
yard" to a variety of different social pro
grams."
The Office of Religious Life hosts a vari
ety of programs in public service that help to
highlight the connection between spirituali
ty and service.
"Our landmark program is one called
Spirituality and Service and we hire interns
each summer to work with the Urban Min
istry," McLennan said. "We cooperate with
the Haas Center and a program called the
United Campus Christian Ministries. Stu
dents work with the homeless through the
Urban Ministry."
Students participating in the program
also include those from the Peninsula Inter
face Action, a political action group, and the
Ecumenical Hunger Project in East Palo
Alto.
The Office hosts a variety of no
credit seminars through the Haas
Center on the relationship between
spirituality and service, and McLen
nan himself has preached and lec
tured on the issue of homelessness
during his sermons.
Before becoming a chaplain at
Tufts University in 1984, McLen
nan practiced law in a low-income
neighborhood in Boston. There,
he studied two governmental
policies, one on reduced federal

funding for low-income housing
and one on liquidated state men
tal facilities. His work on the is
sues inspired him to work on
homelessness.
McLennan says he would like to
see students get out of the Stanford
bubble and into local communities
to help alleviate problems such as
homelessness from perspectives of
both charity and justice.
"We want students to think
about our local community and the
one-to-one service that is so neces
sary and also to look at institutional
structures that created these prob
lems and to do policy and political
work that could end the problem at
the source," he said.

we're not quite sure, but we wanted to begin
the work of doing the research."
Sociology Prof. Donald Barr, who has
been active in supporting the Opportunity
Center, proposed the idea for a student to do
such research and receive either indepen
dent study credit with him or have a paid po
sition administered through the Office of
Religious Life.
"The Opportunity Center is as much for
the members of our community who are on
the streets as it is for the homeless members
of our community who have died," Barr said.
Thus far, six students have shown interest

and applied. There is no set deadline, but the
Office for Religious Life said that it would
like to secure all applications by this week.
"[Barr] made the case that part of what
the Office of Religious Life does is commu
nity service and encourage people on cam
pus to be involved in public service as a part
of religious, spiritual, ethical life," McLen
nan said.
An advisory committee, most likely with
participation from Barr, will oversee this
project. Senior Crystal Trujillo, who has
worked with the Veteran's Administration
in the past, will serve as project director for
the memorial wall.
McLennan commends the town of Palo
Alto for providing services to the homeless.
"Palo Alto, to its credit, has been a hos
pitable place to homeless people," he said.
"In other cities, people are harassed and
pushed away by storeowners and police. It's
also credit to Palo Alto for building this Op
portunity Center because there are many

wealthy cities who say "not in my back
yard" to a variety of different social pro
grams."
The Office of Religious Life hosts a vari
ety of programs in public service that help to
highlight the connection between spirituali
ty and service.
"Our landmark program is one called
Spirituality and Service and we hire interns
each summer to work with the Urban Min
istry," McLennan said. "We cooperate with
the Haas Center and a program called the
United Campus Christian Ministries. Stu
dents work with the homeless through the
Urban Ministry."
Students participating in the program
also include those from the Peninsula Inter
face Action, a political action group, and the
Ecumenical Hunger Project in East Palo
Alto.
The Office hosts a variety of no
credit seminars through the Haas
Center on the relationship between
spirituality and service, and McLen
nan himself has preached and lec
tured on the issue of homelessness
during his sermons.
Before becoming a chaplain at
Tufts University in 1984, McLen
nan practiced law in a low-income
neighborhood in Boston. There,
he studied two governmental
policies, one on reduced federal

funding for low-income housing
and one on liquidated state men
tal facilities. His work on the is
sues inspired him to work on
homelessness.
McLennan says he would like to
see students get out of the Stanford
bubble and into local communities
to help alleviate problems such as
homelessness from perspectives of
both charity and justice.
"We want students to think
about our local community and the
one-to-one service that is so neces
sary and also to look at institutional
structures that created these prob
lems and to do policy and political
work that could end the problem at
the source," he said.
Homeless people may sometimes go un
noticed in the affluent Palo Alto community,
but the deceased will not be forgotten. The
Office of Religious Life has created an ini
tiative for a Stanford student to create a
memorial wall honoring homeless people
who have died in Palo Alto.
The wall will be located in the recently
created Opportunity Center of Palo Alto,
whose aim is to serve the area's homeless
population. The center seeks to provide a
range of social and medical services, as well
as both temporary and permanent living
space, for those in need.
It will have a variety of rooms, including a
community room for women and children
and a single adults' room.
In that community room for single adults,
there "is a sizable wall which has been left by
the architect for a memorial wall for home

less who have been known in the communi
ty and have died in recent years," said Scot
ty McLennan, dean of religious life.
"Those involved with the project will re
search who those [homeless people] are and
discover as many of them as possible and ap
propriately memorialize them," he said.
"What exactly that wall will look like and
how it will be designed and what will go on it,
we're not quite sure, but we wanted to begin
the work of doing the research."
