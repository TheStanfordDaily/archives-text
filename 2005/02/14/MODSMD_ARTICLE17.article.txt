# Speaker tells women to reclaim Islam
## Islamic Awareness Month kicks off with event to address misconceptions of religion 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
Interpreting of the holy texts is one of the
most important ways for Muslim women to
assert their rights, said Ingrid Mattson, pro
fessor of Islamic Studies at Hartford Semi
nary, last night at an event titled "Clearing
the Path to God: Women Reclaiming Islam."
The talk was the first of a series of four
during Islamic Awareness Month designed
to raise awareness about misconceptions of
the Islamic religion, a collaboration be
tween the Muslim Student Awareness Net
work, or MSAN, and the Islamic Society of
Stanford University, or ISSU.
"We're essentially introducing the reli
gious community," said event coordinator
and MSAN officer All Kemal Okyay, a
fourth-year graduate student in electrical
engineering. "The talks will introduce what
Muslims believe, what we practice, and why
we do it. We hope this event will foster
greater understanding about Muslims and
Islam."
Sophomore Shelley Cheung, vice-presi
dent of MSAN, echoed Okyay.
"The goal for tonight's event is to clear
misconceptions that people may have about
Islam, specifically regarding Muslim
women," she said. "By far, the most common

stereotype is that we are oppressed by men.
However, very few people know about the ac
tivism of Muslim women and the power we
have to make change in our community."
Mattson served as an advisor to the
Afghan delegation to the United Nations
Commission on the Status of Women in 1995.
She was also elected vice-president of the Is
lamic Society of North America in 2001.
Speaking about the role of women in
Islam, Mattson particularly stressed about
their responsibility to overcome the gender
discrimination that has become associated
with their religious beliefs.
"Islam cannot be a spiritual resource if it
is a source of oppression," she said. "There
are people who use Islam to justify the op
pression of women. In many ways it
shouldn't be surprising to us in America
since security and patriotism are used to jus
tify all sorts of behaviors and actions."
More specifically, Mattson said that his
torical interpretation of the Koran plays a
large role in how Islamic law and normative
behavior are defined. In medieval Islamic
societies, she said, women were not seen as
capable of interpreting holy texts.
"The main obstacle for Muslim women in
claiming their places in Islam is the struggle
for them to be recognized as authoritative in
the interpretation of texts," Mattson said.
"The Koran gives examples of women who
chose the wrong path, but it also has exam
ples of women who chose the right path. It
depends on who's telling the story."
Mattson also discussed the judgment
often passed on Muslim women and the
lives they choose to live.

"If we really desire for Muslim women to
fully embrace the understanding and prac
tice of Islam, it's unfair for others to ques
tion if they are free agents or not," she said.
"It's frustrating to see assumptions often
being made that they can't choose their way
of life, what they practice or how they dress.
It's a patronizing and patriarchal view."
Okyay said that the next dinners will ad
dress equally controversial issues.
ISSU officer and event organizer Mehdi
Javanmard, a third-year graduate student in
electrical engineering, said that negative
views of Islam in American society show
that there needs to be greater efforts toward
educating the public about the religion.
Javanmard cited a December poll from
Cornell University in which almost half the
respondents said that the government
should restrict the civil liberties of Muslim
Americans in some way. Also, 27 percent of
respondents said that all Muslim Americans
should be required to register their location
with the federal government and 26 percent
said that mosques should be closely moni
tored by U.S. law enforcement agencies. In
addition, 22 percent of those polled said the
federal government should profile citizens
as potential threats based on Middle East
ern heritage or Muslim religion.
"This shows that a large number of
Americans are fearful of Islam and Mus
lims," Javanmard said. "Ever since Sept. 11,
Muslims in America have always been on
the defensive. We've been mostly focused
on explaining who we aren't. Islamic
Awareness Month is an opportunity for us
to tell the Stanford campus who we are."

ples of women who chose the right path. It
depends on who's telling the story."
Mattson also discussed the judgment
often passed on Muslim women and the
lives they choose to live.

"If we really desire for Muslim women to
fully embrace the understanding and prac
tice of Islam, it's unfair for others to ques
tion if they are free agents or not," she said.
"It's frustrating to see assumptions often
being made that they can't choose their way
of life, what they practice or how they dress.
It's a patronizing and patriarchal view."
Okyay said that the next dinners will ad
dress equally controversial issues.
ISSU officer and event organizer Mehdi
Javanmard, a third-year graduate student in
electrical engineering, said that negative
views of Islam in American society show
that there needs to be greater efforts toward
educating the public about the religion.
Javanmard cited a December poll from
Cornell University in which almost half the
respondents said that the government
should restrict the civil liberties of Muslim
Americans in some way. Also, 27 percent of
respondents said that all Muslim Americans
should be required to register their location
with the federal government and 26 percent
said that mosques should be closely moni
tored by U.S. law enforcement agencies. In
addition, 22 percent of those polled said the
federal government should profile citizens
as potential threats based on Middle East
ern heritage or Muslim religion.
"This shows that a large number of
Americans are fearful of Islam and Mus
lims," Javanmard said. "Ever since Sept. 11,
Muslims in America have always been on
the defensive. We've been mostly focused
on explaining who we aren't. Islamic
Awareness Month is an opportunity for us
to tell the Stanford campus who we are."
Interpreting of the holy texts is one of the
most important ways for Muslim women to
assert their rights, said Ingrid Mattson, pro
fessor of Islamic Studies at Hartford Semi
nary, last night at an event titled "Clearing
the Path to God: Women Reclaiming Islam."
The talk was the first of a series of four
during Islamic Awareness Month designed
to raise awareness about misconceptions of
the Islamic religion, a collaboration be
tween the Muslim Student Awareness Net
work, or MSAN, and the Islamic Society of
Stanford University, or ISSU.
"We're essentially introducing the reli
gious community," said event coordinator
and MSAN officer All Kemal Okyay, a
fourth-year graduate student in electrical
engineering. "The talks will introduce what
Muslims believe, what we practice, and why
we do it. We hope this event will foster
greater understanding about Muslims and
Islam."
Sophomore Shelley Cheung, vice-presi
dent of MSAN, echoed Okyay.
"The goal for tonight's event is to clear
misconceptions that people may have about
Islam, specifically regarding Muslim
women," she said. "By far, the most common

stereotype is that we are oppressed by men.
However, very few people know about the ac
tivism of Muslim women and the power we
have to make change in our community."
Mattson served as an advisor to the
Afghan delegation to the United Nations
Commission on the Status of Women in 1995.
She was also elected vice-president of the Is
lamic Society of North America in 2001.
Speaking about the role of women in
Islam, Mattson particularly stressed about
their responsibility to overcome the gender
discrimination that has become associated
with their religious beliefs.
"Islam cannot be a spiritual resource if it
is a source of oppression," she said. "There
are people who use Islam to justify the op
pression of women. In many ways it
shouldn't be surprising to us in America
since security and patriotism are used to jus
tify all sorts of behaviors and actions."
More specifically, Mattson said that his
torical interpretation of the Koran plays a
large role in how Islamic law and normative
behavior are defined. In medieval Islamic
societies, she said, women were not seen as
capable of interpreting holy texts.
"The main obstacle for Muslim women in
claiming their places in Islam is the struggle
for them to be recognized as authoritative in
the interpretation of texts," Mattson said.
"The Koran gives examples of women who
chose the wrong path, but it also has exam
ples of women who chose the right path. It
depends on who's telling the story."
Mattson also discussed the judgment
often passed on Muslim women and the
lives they choose to live.

"If we really desire for Muslim women to
fully embrace the understanding and prac
tice of Islam, it's unfair for others to ques
tion if they are free agents or not," she said.
