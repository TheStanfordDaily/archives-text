### BEA SANFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sometime in between chairing
both the English Department and
the Faculty Senate and teaching
classes, Stanford English Prof.
Robert Polhemus found time to
publish "Lot's Daughters: Sex, Re
demption, and Women's Quest for
Authority," a book that has been a
decade in the making.
The work explores "Lot com
plex," a condition named for the bib
lical story in which Lot's two daugh
ters sleep with their father in order
to preserve the family line. Polhe
mus also highlights other famous
pairings, including Monica Lewin
sky and Bill Clinton, to illustrate the
attraction between daughters and
fathers and between younger
women and older men.
The book is about "the empower
ment of the daughter's voice," Pol
hemus said.
Polhemus said that as he wrote he
felt "torn between the two worth
while and necessary duties" ofacad
emia and writing, but added that the

most hectic part was over now that
the book is published.
The New York Times gave "Lot's
Daughters" what Polhemus called
"a smashing review" upon its publi
cation last month.
"Polhemus doesn't invent the
Lot complex any more than Freud
invented the Oedipus complex,"
read the review. "What he does —
thoroughly and brilliantly — is iden
tify what has existed for millenniums
of recorded history, introducing di
verse examples of the archetypal
transaction between a young, some
times very young, woman and the
man who, if he isn't actually her fa
ther, is old enough to substitute."
Today, he spends much of his
time fielding calls from the Stanford
University Press on how many more
copies to print and when to schedule
publicity events.
While Polhemus said he was very
pleased with the book's initial suc
cess. he acknowledged that there is
"so much chance" in whether or not
a book becomes instantly popular.
