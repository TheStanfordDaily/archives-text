## 
### BEA SANFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sometime in between chairing
both the English Department and
the Faculty Senate and teaching
classes, Stanford English Prof.
Robert Polhemus found time to
publish "Lot's Daughters: Sex, Re
demption, and Women's Quest for
Authority," a book that has been a
decade in the making.
The work explores "Lot com
plex," a condition named for the bib
lical story in which Lot's two daugh
ters sleep with their father in order
to preserve the family line. Polhe
mus also highlights other famous
pairings, including Monica Lewin
sky and Bill Clinton, to illustrate the
attraction between daughters and
fathers and between younger
women and older men.
The book is about "the empower
ment of the daughter's voice," Pol
hemus said.
Polhemus said that as he wrote he
felt "torn between the two worth
while and necessary duties" ofacad
emia and writing, but added that the

most hectic part was over now that
the book is published.
The New York Times gave "Lot's
Daughters" what Polhemus called
"a smashing review" upon its publi
cation last month.
"Polhemus doesn't invent the
Lot complex any more than Freud
invented the Oedipus complex,"
read the review. "What he does —
thoroughly and brilliantly — is iden
tify what has existed for millenniums
of recorded history, introducing di
verse examples of the archetypal
transaction between a young, some
times very young, woman and the
man who, if he isn't actually her fa
ther, is old enough to substitute."
Today, he spends much of his
time fielding calls from the Stanford
University Press on how many more
copies to print and when to schedule
publicity events.
While Polhemus said he was very
pleased with the book's initial suc
cess. he acknowledged that there is
"so much chance" in whether or not
a book becomes instantly popular.

The publishing process itself was
full of surprises, Polhemus said. He
laughed as he related the story be
hind the cover's fishnet-stocking
clad legs, adding that "the cover was
a big decision to make."
Polhemus had initially suggested
a William Blake painting of Lot's
daughters to grace the cover of his
book. A few days later he received
an e-mail with the picture of the fish
net-stockings attached. Polhemus
said he forwarded the message to his
wife. Acting English Prof. Carol
Shloss, to get her opinion.
"I sent this to her and said, 'What
do you think of this?,'" he said. "She
said, 'It's kind of shocking. It may
trivialize your work. Go for it!"'
Yet Polhemus said he doesn't
think the cover image has taken
away from the book at all since its re
lease.
"The more attention you can get.

the better," he added.
Recalling another humorous
anecdote about the book's cover,
Shloss said that once during a
party, she changed into fishnet
stockings, a black miniskirt and a
pair of heels and went to greet the
guests dressed as the cover of her
husband's book.
"He's a fairly absent-minded per
son," said Shloss of Polhemus. "He
was busy greeting people. When I
entered the room, other people had
to point out to Rob that I was
dressed like his book cover."
Shloss herself is no stranger to aca
demic theorizing on father-daughter
relationships. In December 2003, she
published a biography of Lucia
Joyce, James Joyce's daughter, in
which she explored the facets of
Lucia's relationship with her father.
The book, "Lucia Joyce: To Dance in
the Wake," was a National Book
Critics Circle Award nominee.
"We met over our interest in fa
ther-daughter relations," said
Shloss, referring to her relationship
with Polhemus. "I've never known
him [when he wasn't] writing about

father-daughter relations."
When the two are not teaching
classes at Stanford, they spend time
on the coast of Maine, where they
can focus on their writing.
"Basically we just retreat from
the world." Shloss said. "We have
writing studios there, and you just
get up in the morning and make your
coffee and get to work on writing."
Shloss said that she and her Pol
hemus approach their work in very
similar ways.
"We've always been committed
to accessible language to engage our
readers," she explained. "I wasn't in
terested in writing for a very elite
group."
Polhemus said that writing books
on similar topics simultaneously
meant that both his and his wife's
books were heavily influenced by
each other.
"We are not only wed to one an
other, our books and ideas are wed
to one another," he added.
Polhemus will be formally pre
senting his book tomorrow at 6 p.m.
in the Art Alcove of the Stanford
Bookstore.
