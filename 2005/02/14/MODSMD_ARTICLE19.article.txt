### BEN WHALEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the number of applications to the
University increases each year. School of Edu
cation Lecturer Denise Clark Pope's new
book "Doing School: How We are Creating a
Generation of Stressed out, Materialistic and
Miseducated Students," critically examines
what students today must do to get into Stan
ford and other top colleges.
Pope, who completed her undergraduate
and doctoral work at Stanford, has taught at
both the high school and college level.
To write the book, Pope shadowed five
high school students for a year, talking to them
and exploring their opinions and anxieties
about both high school and college life.
"We knew kids' perspectives of high
school, but we didn't know their motivation."
said Pope. "What I found was that kids were
just doing' school. They literally didn't have
time to do all the work. Students would say.
We'd love to read the whole book, but we just
don't have time.' Or, 'Yeah we cheat and we
know it's wrong but there's no other choice
given the grades you need to get into a good
college."'
Pope said she believes that the number of
overworked and unhappy students is on the
rise at high schools and colleges across the na
tion.
" There is still no guarantee for anyone that
they will get into Ivy and top universities,"
Pope said. "If you look at the system sur
rounding college admissions and you admit
that it's crap, you can start working to change
it.
She cited as examples the climbing rate of
students developing ulcers and being placed
on suicide watch, as well as the spike in the
number of students using anti-depressants and
anti-anxiety medication in college.
Pope said she appreciates the strides Stan
lord's Office of Undergraduate Admission has
made in attempting to select well-rounded stu

dents who will fit in on campus, rather than fo
cusing chiefly on test scores and grades.
Citing Stanford's "duck syndrome" —
which refers to students who seem calm on the
surface but must paddle furiously to stay afloat
— Pope said she recognizes the University's
efforts, but that there is still a nationwide prob
lem that will require much work to remedy.
"You can't get out of this mentality," Pope
said. "Stanford freshman tell me they thought
that once they got into college they'd have a
life, but it's often not what they thought. Col
lege life is much more intense."
According to Arcadio Morales, the resi
dent dean in Governor's Corner, "duck syn
drome" does not define all students at Stan
ford.
"1 believe that for some students the calm
exterior is not necessarily an attempt to hide
the incessant paddling or a sign of complacen
cy, but a way to maintain focus and to keep an
eye on their goals," he said.
Some administrators said they have also
noticed some of the problems Pope brings to
light in her book.
Julie Lythcott-Haims. dean of freshmen
and transfer students, said she sees many stu
dents who might seem happy on the outside
but who are actually struggling to keep up with
the demanding environment.
"Students have told us that Stanford's laid
back culture makes them want to put up a fa
cade to make it look like they can easily bal
ance the complexities of college life and acad
emics," Lythcott-Haims said. "But with every
student erecting a facade it appears that no
one has to work hard to succeed, so a student
who is working hard just to keep up feels he or
she might not be as smart as the rest of the
class."
Pope noted that the cycle of compulsive
over-achieving and anxiety over grades con
tinues to manifest itself across the University.
"There's a good amount of cheating at
Stanford, despite the honor code," Pope said.
"It's not surprising, when students add in all

their extracurriculars on top of all the heavy
course loads. It's practically the same as what
was going on in high school."
Pope also said that some students admitted
they attend office hours only to forge a per
sonal relationship with the teacher in hopes of
receiving a higher grade at the end of the quar
ter.
When not at Stanford, Pope travels to local
high schools where she engages faculty, stu
dents and parents in "Stressed Out Students"
workshops.
Pope outlined a three-part strategy for how
parents and faculty members can help reduce
students' stress levels.
The first part involves working with the
school, changing the curriculum and develop
ing what she calls "plagiarism proof" assign
ments. This includes the abolishment of multi
ple-choice tests and book work that merely re
quires students to memorize lists of factual in
formation. Pope explained that these types of
assignments encourage cheating, and in some
cases parents even complete homework as
signments for their children.
Pope said it is also necessary to change stu
dents' use of time during school hours. She en
courages the high schools she visits not to as
sign homework on weekends or lengthy pro
jects over school breaks.
According to Pope, parent education is also
an important step in achieving this goal.
"The parents are more intense than the stu
dents a lot of times," Pope said. "These so
called 'helicopter parents' hover above their
kids, and they swoop down when they think
their kids need help."
Morales expressed similar concern about
the role of parents in causing additional stress
for many students.
"One of my biggest concerns is parental
pressure: Some students end up selecting ma
jors and taking classes at the parents' insis
tence, not necessarily because they themselves
are interested," he said. "But how can they
defy their parents who are paying the bill for

their education?"
Finally, Pope said she believes it is neces
sary not only for schools, but also for society as
a whole to change its definitions of both acad
emic and personal success.
"The messages we are sending our kids as
to what a successful person is, are really truly
different than what we believe in our hearts,"

she said. "So we really need to rethink our de
finitions of success and the paths to get there."
Tomorrow at noon in Margaret Jacks Hall,
Pope, Eric Roberts, a computer science pro
fessor. and Hilton Obenzinger, the associate
director for honors writing, will serve as pan
elists for an Everyday Ethics discussion enti
tled "Stress and Cheating."
