# VPSA could change after Awakuni leaves
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE DESK EDITOR 
The announcement of Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Gene Awakuni's departure and the delay in the
search for his replacement have raised concerns among
students and community center leaders about the future
of the Office of the Vice Provost for Student Affairs,
which includes the office of the Dean of Students, Office
of Student Activities and the University's community
centers.
His exit will leave a void in the team responsible for
improving student space, and University administrators
said they are still determining the future of the position.
Awakuni, who will leave Stanford in March to be
come chancellor at the University of Hawaii's West
O'ahu campus, was influential in expanding student
space during his three years at the University. He was
most noted for his work on the renovation of the first
floor of Tresidder Memorial Union and the upcoming
overhaul of Old Union to return it to its traditional role
as a student hub.
There have been rumors that the office headed by
Awakuni will be dissolved and his responsibilities will be
transferred to John Bravman, vice provost for under
graduate education. However, University administra
tors said that a decision regarding the Office of the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs has not yet been made.
In an interview with The Daily, University Provost
John Etchemendy said that the administration was cur
rently re-evaluating the structure of the Office of VPSA.
"We've been talking to all of the people at the next
level down in the organization and talking to people who
have a lot of interaction with Student Affairs, trying to
decide what the right thing to do would be," he said.
"Student Affairs has morphed through the years, and it
has been in different forms ... 1 thought that this was a
good opportunity to think about whether we had the
right structure or what it should be."
Etchemendy added that it is normal for the Universi
ty to reevaluate the organization of offices when admin
istrators step down.
Etchemendy also put to rest the rumors of combining
the Offices of the VPSA with the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education, and said that
such a move would create "too large an organization to
be really effective."
"The Vice Provost for Student
Affairs deals with undergrads and
grads, whereas the VPUE focuses
only on undergraduates,"
Etchemendy said. "[Combining the
two| is probably not a way that we
would go."
In addition, concerns were raised
regarding the management and fu
ture of the various community cen
ters on campus, all currently gov

erned by Student Affairs.
"It's very likely that we will de
cide on an interim arrangement."
Etchemendy said concerning the
centers. "We will do something, but
I don't believe in rushing. The com
munity centers report to the Dean
of Students, and the Dean of Stu
dents reports to the VPSA. They
will remain under the Dean of Stu
dents."
According to Chris Clarke, assis
tant director of El Centro Chicano,
the community center directors re
cently met with Etchemendy to dis
cuss some of these issues.
"After Gene Awakuni an
nounced his departure. Provost
Etchemendy met with the directors
of each of the community centers to
gather input about the centers'
needs vis-a-vis the soon to be vacant
position," said Ben Davidson, direc
tor of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual

and Transgender Community Re
sources Center.
Many directors said that they
were unsure, citing the need to first
see how the related offices are re
structured.
"It would be hard to say how this
[dissolution of VPSA] would affect
the Women's Community Center as
it would involve speculation," said
Laura Harrison, director of the
Women's Community Center. "It
would depend on what the proposed
re-organization would look like."
Though the administration has
still not formed a search committee
to fill the pending vacancy in the
VPSA, Stanford is still exploring its
various options, Etchemendy said.
"We don't have a committee," he
added. "But we have been talking to
organizations, people outside of or
ganizations and students on this
matter."
