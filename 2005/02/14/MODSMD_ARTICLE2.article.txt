# VPSA could change after Awakuni leaves

### ALIYYA HAQUE DESK EDITOR 
The announcement of Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Gene Awakuni's departure and the delay in the
search for his replacement have raised concerns among
students and community center leaders about the future
of the Office of the Vice Provost for Student Affairs,
which includes the office of the Dean of Students, Office
of Student Activities and the University's community
centers.
His exit will leave a void in the team responsible for
improving student space, and University administrators
said they are still determining the future of the position.
Awakuni, who will leave Stanford in March to be
come chancellor at the University of Hawaii's West
O'ahu campus, was influential in expanding student
space during his three years at the University. He was
most noted for his work on the renovation of the first
floor of Tresidder Memorial Union and the upcoming
overhaul of Old Union to return it to its traditional role
as a student hub.
There have been rumors that the office headed by
Awakuni will be dissolved and his responsibilities will be
transferred to John Bravman, vice provost for under
graduate education. However, University administra
tors said that a decision regarding the Office of the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs has not yet been made.
In an interview with The Daily, University Provost
John Etchemendy said that the administration was cur
rently re-evaluating the structure of the Office of VPSA.
"We've been talking to all of the people at the next
level down in the organization and talking to people who
have a lot of interaction with Student Affairs, trying to
decide what the right thing to do would be," he said.
"Student Affairs has morphed through the years, and it
has been in different forms ... 1 thought that this was a
good opportunity to think about whether we had the
right structure or what it should be."
Etchemendy added that it is normal for the Universi
ty to reevaluate the organization of offices when admin
istrators step down.
Etchemendy also put to rest the rumors of combining
the Offices of the VPSA with the Office of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education, and said that
such a move would create "too large an organization to
be really effective."
