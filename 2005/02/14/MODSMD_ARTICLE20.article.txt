In "Copy center embezzler sentenced to three
years." published on Feb. 4, The Daily inaccurate
ly included a photo of the FedEx / Kinko's that re
placed the Pulse Copy Center in Tresidder Memo
rial Union. FedEx / Kinko's was not in any way as
sociated with the embezzlement case discussed in
the article. FedEx / Kinko's took over the space in
which Pulse Copy Center used to operate.
In "Forum relates Asian history to today," pub
lished on l-eb. 10, The Daily inaccurately reported
that Kiku Funabiki's husband's name is Wallace,
when it actually Walter. The article also said that no
Japanese students returned to Stanford to com
plete their degrees, when Walter Funabiki did re
turn to complete both undergraduate and graduate
degrees, along with several other students who
were interned during World War 11. The caption on
the picture accompanying the article also stated
that the jacket being viewed belonged to Kiku Fun
abiki's husband when it belonged to her father.
