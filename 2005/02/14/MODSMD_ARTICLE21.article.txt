## Editorial Roosevelt Institution is a welcome change 
### 
A large crowd gathered last Tuesday night for the
opening of the Roosevelt Institution, the latest
Democratic movement attempting to ignite political
passion on campus. The Roosevelt Institution repre
sents a welcome change from what has occasionally
amounted to partisan bickering instead of productive
work.
The student think tank, as founders call it, will
unite groups from Stanford, Yale and perhaps more
schools over discussions of progressive views on na
tional and international policies. Though some of the
group's focus remains to be determined, its goal is to
compete with the clout of well-established conserva
tive think tanks such as the Hoover Institution by re
searching and promoting ideas on topics from gay
marriage to educational policy.
Coming off a defeat in the presidential election,
and with no immediate electoral or protest-worthy
national issues, the progressives on campus are right
to aim for broader, long-term goals. According to the
new group's leaders, they hope to prove that students
can be just as influential as Ph. D.'sand can offer a
new, fresher perspective on everything from interna
tional development to religion. Studying issues, writ
ing policy papers and advocating well-formed points
of view will take hard work and more organization
than just putting together a protest, and it will surely
require more sustained attention than similar groups
often receive from their organizers. But the goals are
noble and many seem to be within reach.

There will undoubtedly be many unforeseen ob
stacles. Running a think tank with students is chal
lenging, as Hoover Senior Fellow Larry Diamond
pointed out, because no one is focusing on the ideas
full-time. While Stanford students are capable of
heroic efforts in apportioning their time and excelling
around the clock, a small permanent staff will proba
bly be necessary.
And then there is the question of money. Students
must remember that extensive fundraising outside
traditional channels will be necessary to create a sus
tainable group.
We hope that despite these obstacles, the new
Roosevelt Institution can develop several areas of
deep expertise that will outlast the current set of stu
dents and perhaps grow into something influential on
a larger scale.
One of the best parts of this week's discussion has
been the lack of criticism of the Hoover Institution.
Instead of bashing I loover, progress is being made to
challenge it on intellectual grounds, a more produc
tive and worthy avenue. Over the past two years,
there has been an unsuccessful movement of students
and faculty to sever Hoover's affiliation with the Uni
versity, focusing on alleged ideological discrimination
in the Hoover Institution's hiring practices. This issue
is a non-starter with Stanford administrators, and
small student protests are unlikely to sway anyone. A
permanent counter-institution, with its own ideas and
goals, is a better objective.
