# A 						Break From the Bubble

OK. 1 lied. Not every one of my columns will be seri
ous.
Actually. I take that back. Valentine's Day has gotten
me thinking about a very serious question: What does
the gay guy best friend (GGBF) do when his girlfriends

go out and get serious boyfriends?
As a GGBF, I have found myself
in just such a quandary. Recently, in
explicably, many of my closest female
friends have landed themselves
beaus.
This has launched me into a self
identity crisis. My GGBF services —
as escort to weddings and other social
gatherings, as cock-blocker at frat par
ties and as co-complainer about how

much Stanford guys suck (yes. I am quite aware I am one)
— are no longer needed. They now have legitimate es
corts, no need to go out to frats anymore or to think Stan
ford guys suck — at least not their Stanford guys.
What does this leave me to do? Go out and get a
boyfriend of my own? Like that's going to happen.
And since I don't know much about "grooming,"
"fashion," "culture," "design," or "food & wine" (other
than that it's best to pour the cereal first, then the milk),
that rules out a career as the next Queer Eye.
Fortunately, like any self-respecting gay guy, 1 have a
lot of female friends. They can't all get coupled at once...
can they? The way it's been going lately, I'm about to be
come the 9th wheel on the eight-wheeler to coupledom.
To fill my extra time. I've found a solution. Since 1
want to work on promoting human and civil rights issues

abroad, I'm going to need a lot of money. And since 1
certainly won't he making it as a humble American Stud
ies major, 1 have resolved myself to take a hit for the
team: I'm going to become a trophy husband. 1 might as
well put my skills as the perfect sham boyfriend to some
practical use.
It worked for David Guest with Liza Minnelli (at
least for a while), and it's a lot easier to make the world
a better place when you have egregious quantities of
cash. Quite frankly, a life of working out. tanning, and
schmoozing with important people is a lot less strenuous
than attempting to be a legitimate student. Besides,
making it on your own is highly overrated. Just ask Paris
Hilton.
Hopefully, by the time my friends are heads of relief
agencies and global non-profits (and married, of
course), I will be leading the life of a comfortable trophy
husband with access to a large bank account with which
to finance their altruistic exploits.
In the mean time, I'll still have plenty of fun with my
taken female friends. But it isn't quite the same — the
dynamic's changed. Maybe it's the first sign we're all
growing up.
And straight guys, don't think this doesn't apply to
you, too: Maybe not now, but someday soon, your boys
are going to start choosing "'hos' before bros,'" as the
saying goes. (I grudgingly wish all my coupled friends —
and everyone else — a happy Valentine's Day)
