## Grad School: Where Parties Go to Die (ver. 2.0) 
### 
Today is Valentine's Day. Well
actually that's a lie. In fact, it's the
Friday before Valentine's Day.
However, you're reading this on
Valentine's Day and the fact that I
have to write it in advance means
that the strictures of journalistic in
tegrity are being

com promised.
Sorry.
Having gotten
that out of the
way (interests of
full disclosure
and so on) I
should move on
to explaining why
I've decided to
revisit a theme
(see "Grad
School: Where
Parties Go to

Die," Oct. 26,2004).
Firstly, I'm lazy.
Secondly, and more relevantly,
it's because I'm going to a Valen
tine's Day party at the Graduate
Community Center tonight — by
tonight I mean on Friday, not Mon
day (isn't this confusing) — and the
party is going to suck.
Incidentally, I did try to find a
more elegant word than "suck," but
somehow nothing else quite conveys
the depth of feeling.
Now, the more observant among
you will have noticed that I'm com
plaining about a grad school event I
haven't been to yet. That is an excel
lent point, so I will stop writing for
now. However, what follows was
written after the fact, and 1 bet that
the suckiness of the party will be on
par with expectations.
(Navgoes to the party.)
Well it's the morning (actually af
ternoon) after and it turns out 1 was
right. In fact, much to my surprise, I
think 1 may even have been overly
optimistic.
Leaving aside the horrendously
bad organization and the horribly
crammed rooms, the worst thing was
the cringe-inducing enthusiasm for
the party's premise.
On arrival one was given a glow
ing pendant to affix to one's outfit in
order to make a declaration of ro
mantic status through a choice of
color.
Red translated as "I'm at
tached, and yet I still choose to
come here." Purple meant that the
wearer was sort of available (1 ac
tually have no idea what that
means). Finally, the masses of male
electrical engineers were wearing

radioactive green, because there's
just no better color to say: "Please
hook up with me."
In retrospect, the theme of the
affair should have set off more than
the usual alarm hells. After all. the
Hallmark Holiday is centred
around secret passion (difficult
under the spot lights of the Com
munity Center) and expressions of
existing love (taking your signifi
cant other to a grad school event
can be many things, but not a sign of
affection).
For most people, today (that is to
say Monday) is a little bit of a
washout. In fact, if you have time
and the inclination to read this on
Valentine's Day, it's a safe bet that
hoards of handsome men / beautiful
women haven't been chasing you.
A vague, yearly sense of disap
pointment is not, however, the limit
of my issues with Feb. 14. 1 dislike
manufactured holidays in general —
it's always difficult to perform under
such pressure — but today is note
worthy even in such company.
1 can't help but feel Valentine's
Day has been carefully constructed
for the purposes of irritating me.
Suddenly, public displays of affec
tion are accepted (even. 1 suppose,
expected). Whereas a week ago
heavy petting in White Plaza would
have been frowned upon, today it's
par for the course.
Speaking of courses, navigating
the muddy streams of undergradu
ates that flow between campus
buildings is difficult at the best of
times, but when hands are held and
waists are clasped the struggle is all
the greater.
Of course, there are some re
deeming features to having a day for
romance. If you're lucky, some
young chap will make a fool himself
with an overblown public gesture,
which is always good for a laugh.
Also, given how irritating they are, I
suppose it's not such a bad thing to
have couples out of the way for a
night.
As a final word, though, the im
portant thing is that whether it's a
bottle of gin or a shapely leg that you
find yourself caressing this evening,
you would do well to remember that
neither will last forever.

Need a date tonight? Nav suggests
Jack Bauer, he'll be on at 9 p.m. on
Fox and will he sure to keep you all ex
cited. Alternatively, e-mail
navins@stanford.edu, and you can be
ignored by one more person.
