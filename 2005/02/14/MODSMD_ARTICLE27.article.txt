# Op-Ed
## Both sides of the Sudan crisis will be heard 
### Rania Eltom 
As president of the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network, or
MSAN. at Stanford University, I
would like to respond to the many
concerned community members
upset over our hosting of Sudan's
Ambassador to Sudan, Khidir
Haroun Ahmed.
First and foremost, I'd like to
thank our co-sponsors for support
ing the beginnings of dialogue on the
tragic crisis in Sudan — the Stanford
African Student Association, the
Organization of Arab Students at
Stanford University, the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, the Center for
African Studies, the Stanford Politi
cal Science Association, the Stan
ford Journal for African Studies and
the Society for International Affairs

at Stanford. Furthermore, I'd also
like to thank the ambassador for
speaking on behalf of the govern
ment of Sudan and fur illustrating
some of the government's faults in
this conflict. It is not everyday that
we are offered the opportunity to
confront government officials with
difficult questions, and his willing
ness to come and answer these ques
tions supports the essence of this in
stitution of higher learning.
As a native of Sudan, with exiled
family members from the Sudanese
government. I am not supportive of
any regime that oppresses and kills
its own civilians. Nonetheless, I am
not in support of toppling regimes,
instituting sanctions that only affect
civilians, or invading countries. For
this reason, I support and will con
tinue to support 'dialogue' between

both sides of this conflict — which,
in no way is an attempt to 'distort the
facts'. 1 realize that objectivity is dif
ficult to find when most people 'in
terested' in the conflict are motivat
ed by stereotypes of Muslims and
'Arabs'. 'Dialogue* and 'awareness'
programs are monologues and pro
paganda, respectively, at this Uni
versity. and in the case for Darfur,
MSAN will not deliver a one-sided
view.
MSAN will host a series of events
on Darfur. On March 3. John Pren
dergast, a hard-line critic of the Su
danese government, will address the
Stanford community on our behalf,
and Adam Shapiro, a well known
human rights activist, will screen his
new documentary on Darfur next
month. Sudan will always be on our
agenda, and we aim to foster dia

logue on our campus with different
speakers on the issue.
Our bringing Ambassador
Ahmed is not a reflection of our sup
port for the government — our
bringing him is only our effort to rep
resent a vast array of opinions on the
Darfur crisis. We firmly believe that
the road to peace is not limited to
war and sanctions. Just as we are in
staunch opposition to the Sudanese
government's policies and action, we
are against those of the rebels, and as
we welcomed a speaker on behalf of
the government, we would welcome
a speaker on behalf of the rebels.
Peace can only be achieved when
both the government and the rebels
of Darfur agree to a peace deal to
seal the era of war that Sudan has ex
perienced since colonization by the
British.
With well over 2 million people
dead from a devastating civil war
and close to 300,000 dead in Darfur,
let's agree that the rhetoric we argue
over while discussing Darfur won't
save anyone. The immediate need to
support and protect the humanitari
an aid groups from both government
forces and rebel attacks is eminent.
With crimes against humanity com
mitted by both sides, justice is clear
ly in short supply, and though the
perpetrators different, the victims
are the same and true sufferers of
this war. Let's unite to bring imme
diate and necessary aid to the vic
tims who have not the luxury of
voice and debate in this conflict.

'Arabs'. 'Dialogue* and 'awareness'
programs are monologues and pro
paganda, respectively, at this Uni
versity. and in the case for Darfur,
MSAN will not deliver a one-sided
view.
MSAN will host a series of events
on Darfur. On March 3. John Pren
dergast, a hard-line critic of the Su
danese government, will address the
Stanford community on our behalf,
and Adam Shapiro, a well known
human rights activist, will screen his
new documentary on Darfur next
month. Sudan will always be on our
agenda, and we aim to foster dia

logue on our campus with different
speakers on the issue.
Our bringing Ambassador
Ahmed is not a reflection of our sup
port for the government — our
bringing him is only our effort to rep
resent a vast array of opinions on the
Darfur crisis. We firmly believe that
the road to peace is not limited to
war and sanctions. Just as we are in
staunch opposition to the Sudanese
government's policies and action, we
are against those of the rebels, and as
we welcomed a speaker on behalf of
the government, we would welcome
a speaker on behalf of the rebels.
Peace can only be achieved when
both the government and the rebels
of Darfur agree to a peace deal to
seal the era of war that Sudan has ex
perienced since colonization by the
British.
With well over 2 million people
dead from a devastating civil war
and close to 300,000 dead in Darfur,
let's agree that the rhetoric we argue
over while discussing Darfur won't
save anyone. The immediate need to
support and protect the humanitari
an aid groups from both government
forces and rebel attacks is eminent.
With crimes against humanity com
mitted by both sides, justice is clear
ly in short supply, and though the
perpetrators different, the victims
are the same and true sufferers of
this war. Let's unite to bring imme
diate and necessary aid to the vic
tims who have not the luxury of
voice and debate in this conflict.
