## Residential Education must be held accountable 
### 
I wish, for once, that Residential
Education would stop lying to the
student body and make a statement
it can be held accountable to. The
continual changing of policies with
out so much as a semblance of de
bate within the student body or even
a public justification from Res Ed is
a disservice to Stanford and sends
the wrong message to students.
If Res Ed didn't want Zucker
berg to speak in a freshmen dorm
("Branner staff cancel Zuckerberg
talk," Feb. 11) because of a connec
tion to underage drinking (a valid
point), then say so. At least be hon
est. But to issue vague statements
and put the clamp down on staff who
rely on honesty and openness to do
the job entrusted to them endangers
the fabric of the student community
and continues to make painfully
clear how out of touch the people in

Res Ed are with the student body.
The power to make decisions in
volves taking accountability for
your actions. Stop treating us like
children and give us a straight an
swer.

Stonewalling' The Daily makes
Branner staff look amateurish
Editor's note: Murk Thoma is a for
mer Daily editor.
In response to Shirin Sharif's ar
ticle, "Branner staff cancel Zucker
berg talk" (Feb. 11), I hope that the
staff at Branner realizes how ama
teurish it looks when it stonewalls
attempts by The Daily to attain even
the most pedestrian information.
It is surprising that Branner Res-
ident Fellow Kennell Jackson, as a man ac
complished in academic discourse, so will
ingly ignores those who want to understand
his opinions and actions.
For not the first time in his tenure as a
resident fellow, he repeatedly refused re
quests for comment and told both his assis
tants and students to keep their mouths
shut. My question is, why?
Why all the secrecy over canceling a talk
for a very obvious (and understandable)
reason â€” namely, that the speaker seems
not to be actively opposed to underage
drinking?
From Jackson to the recanting, anony
mous resident assistant, this is a typical,
wide-ranging Stanford effort to keep under
wraps something that it is neither fully con
cealable nor particularly salacious.
1 can understand the University's unwill
ingness to disclose something of import
(such as its investment information), but
why, precisely, is it so imperative that the

community not know the official reason
why Zuckerberg's talk was canceled?
Even if there are certain facts which have
not come to light and which might need to
be kept secret, Jackson and his staff have no
legitimate reason not to talk with Sharif and
answer those questions which would not
compromise the privacy of the issue or indi
vidual in question.

Preserve four-class housing
Editor's note: Wenkai Tai is a member of
The Daily's editorial board.
On behalf of the residents of Francos, a
four-class dorm in Wilbur, we would like to
express our concern over proposed changes
to undergraduate housing that would dras
tically reduce the number of four-class
dorms on campus ("Bravman pitches hous
ing overhaul," Feb 9).
We feel that both freshmen and upper
classmen benefit from the experience of liv
ing in a four-class dorm. Freshmen bring en
ergy and enthusiasm to the dorm, while up

perclassmen offer freshmen valuable advice
about classes and life in general. To that
end, we believe that separating freshmen
and upperclassmen will not necessarily re
sult in an enhanced freshman experience or
"more desirable upperclass housing," as
Vice Provost of Undergraduate Education
John Bravman described.
Although some of us might have pre
ferred to stay in an all-frosh dorm in our
freshman year, we feel that it is important
that future Stanford students are given the
option to stay in non-themed, four-class
dorms.
We believe that the University could do
more to gauge student interest in four-class
housing and provide housing options for
those drawn to the unique experience of liv
ing in a four-class dorm.
We hope that four-class residences will
continue to provide an opportunity for
Stanford students of all classes to meet and
interact with one another.
