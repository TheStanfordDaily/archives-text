## Residential Education must be held accountable 
### 
I wish, for once, that Residential
Education would stop lying to the
student body and make a statement
it can be held accountable to. The
continual changing of policies with
out so much as a semblance of de

a public justification from Res Ed is
a disservice to Stanford and sends
the wrong message to students.
If Res Ed didn't want Zucker
berg to speak in a freshmen dorm
("Branner staff cancel Zuckerberg
talk," Feb. 11) because of a connec
tion to underage drinking (a valid
point), then say so. At least be hon

and put the clamp down on staff who
rely on honesty and openness to do
the job entrusted to them endangers
the fabric of the student community
and continues to make painfully
clear how out of touch the people in

Res Ed are with the student body.
The power to make decisions in
volves taking accountability for
your actions. Stop treating us like
children and give us a straight an
swer.

the most pedestrian information.
It is surprising that Branner Res-
