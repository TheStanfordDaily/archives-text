## Fade Into Bolivian The 						high hilarity of Jose Canseco 
### 
Having failed in his comeback attempts with
Tampa Bay and Montreal (the fact that he
was unable to make the 2002 Montreal
Expos roster shows how far the stock of the former
Bash Brother has fallen), on Feb. 14, Jose Canseco
will release his tell-all book: "Juiced: Wild Times,
Rampant Roids, Smash Hits, and How Baseball
Got Big." While I haven't read the book — since I
don't have an advance copy — let me analyze its
three major claims.
However, before evaluating his claims, allow
me to do a brief character analysis of Canseco.
Simply put, this is a bankrupt man with equally
strong urges to beat his wife and to be an en
trepreneur. 1 think we all remember the ball
bouncing off his head and his failed 1993 pitching

attempt with the Texas
Rangers (his line: 1 inning
pitched, 2 hits, 3 88, and 3 runs
allowed; so basically, he was
way better than former Giant
William Van Landingham).
But, let's rewind to 2003 when
Canseco was sentenced to two
years of house arrest (sidenote:
Can anybody explain to me
why Canseco was still using

steroids when he was on house arrest? Honestly, I
don't get it — did the guy seriously believe he
could make another comeback?) for his involve
ment in a 2001 fight at a nightclub in Miami. Un
able to leave his house, Canseco began soliciting
bids on his Web site (opening bid: $2,500) to spend
the afternoon with Jose at his home in South Flori
da. during which possible activities included "pri
vate power-hitting instruction, private martial arts
instruction, workout with Jose and cook out by the
pool." Sweet!
Canseco's been strongly hyping this book since
he first announced it at the beginning of the 21st
century as a tell-all book that would claim that 85
percent of MLB players use steroids. Despite his
2003 retirement from baseball, apparently people
still care about Canseco; his book ranks 11th on
Amazon.corn's Sales Ranking. Anybody who
wants to be my Valentine would make a favorable
impression by purchasing this book for me. Now
on to his claims...
Claim 1: Canseco injected anabolic steroids
into the asses of Mark McGwire and Jason Giambi
in bathroom stalls of the Oakland Coliseum.
Having been in the stalls of the Oakland Coli
seum, I find it implausible that men with such large
asses all fitting together. And yet, all three of the
preceding men are admitted steroid users (yes,
Andro is one. even if it was technically legal under
MLB rules). From the numerous games I've at
tended at the Coliseum, I can only hope that I've
been so lucky as to use the same hallowed the
bathroom stalls where McGwire, Giambi and
Canseco injected themselves.
Claim 2: Canseco introduced steroids to Pudge
Rodriguez, Rafael Palmeiro and Juan Gonzalez, a
practice Texas Rangers' Managing Partner
George W. Bush obliviously allowed.
As a sportswriter for The Daily, I'm contractu
ally obligated to insert a WMD joke at this time.
On this point, I'm inclined to believe Canseco as el
Presidente George strikes me as the kind of guy
who could be certain that Saddam was hoarding
WMD's 10,000 miles away, and be absolutely un
aware that Rafael Palmeiro's need for Viagra was
caused by his rampant steroid use.
Claim 3: Canseco never scored with Madonna
and was only able to reach second base.
Talk about your spurious claims to include in
the book. So let's see: Vanilla Ice scores with
Madonna but 1988 American League MVP Jose
Canseco can't? And yet Canseco decides to write
about this in his book? I'm pretty sure that we can
chalk this one up to Canseco's shrunken testicles,
although I doubt that Canseco admits to this.
Finally, I'd like to point out that even though
Jose's twin brother Ozzie was allegedly caught
with steroids during a Charlotte County traffic
stop, he still sucks. Apparently Ozzie and Arman
do Rios were using the same type of steroids.
