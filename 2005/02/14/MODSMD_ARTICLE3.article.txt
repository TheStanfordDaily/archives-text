# Housing changes spark discussion
## Ujamaa residents worry that relocation of dorm could disrupt programming 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Since Vice Provost John Bravman
proposed a major housing overhaul last
Tuesday, e-mail lists and dining halls
have been buzzing with reactions.
Among the most contentious changes
are the proposed relocation of Ujamaa to

Florence Moore Hall and Branner Hall's
switch from an all-freshman dorm to
upper-class housing.
Ujamaa residents, with the support of
the Black Student Union, have slated two
meetings for the coming weeks to formu
late their response to the proposal.
"In moving Uj to FloMo, Uj loses so
many of the positive things that encour
age people to get involved with and stay
involved in Stanford's Black communi
ty," said Ujamaa resident Maccarin Mor
ton, a sophomore.
"It loses much more than its singles,"
he added, citing the theme programming
and appeal to black admits that he be
lieves the house stands to lose.

Ujamaa resident Khalilah Karim, a se
nior. agreed, saying that enactment of
the proposal would have "far reaching ef
fects not only for future and current stu
dents, but for alumni."
She said she worries that Ujamaa re
unions will lack their nostalgic quality if
the residence is moved to a strange
house.
"[Ujamaa] is not just the black house -
it is part of our legacy, our culture at
Stanford," she said.
However, the decision to relocate
Ujamaa is not yet final. At a meeting
held at Ujamaa last week, Bravman
promised that "students would
have valuable and meaningful
input into where [the dorm | will he
relocated," said resident Ochuko
Metitiri, a junior.
"Nobody is completely against
change," Metitiri added. "We just
would like to see that proper con
sideration is taken in the whole
process as well as to ensure that
the move will not destroy (he spir
it of the dorm."

Plans to reform Branner were
also met with mixed feelings.
Branner freshman Karina Liu said
she feels an attachment to Bran
ner's all-frosh legacy.
"1 think Branner should stay a
freshman dorm," she said. "That's
just how I associate it."
Senior J.P. Schnapper-Cast
eras, a former resident assistant at
Branner, also said he values his ex
perience at the all-frosh dorm.
However, he added that "if [the
overhaul] allows more people to
have the all-frosh experience, I
think the changes could he a good
thing."
Schnapper-Casteras said here

grets that three to four hundred in
coming freshmen were denied the
all-frosh housing they requested
last year.
"Bravo for Bravman trying to
make [freshman housing] more
fair," he said.
Trancos Resident Fellow Jen
nifer Lane said that many fresh
men enjoy four-class housing.
"Students with whom 1 have
spoken stress the importance of
cross-class friendships," she said.
One such student is sophomore
Cheng Boon Yap, who worried
that the changes would "diminish
four-class interaction," something
he enjoyed while living in Stern

last year.
Bravman said that the respons
es he has gotten so far have been
overwhelmingly positive. He said
students stopped him on the street
to express their support.
However, Lane, speaking on
behalf of her fellow RFs, Said she
hopes that the University continue
to look into the changes before fi
nalizing them.
"We would ask that the plan
ners please hold a number of
meetings with ResEd, student
staff. Resident Fellows and with
students in general to truly ex
plore this issue before locking any
thing into place," she said.
