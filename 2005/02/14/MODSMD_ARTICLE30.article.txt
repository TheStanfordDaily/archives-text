# Smith, Stanford humiliate Bears
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Brooke Smith is a thorn in our
side," California head coach Caren
Horstmeyer said after No. 4 Stanford
humiliated the Bears 91-50 at Haas
Pavilion Friday night. "Our goal was
not to let her get the ball, but you
know she did a good job of that, and
she seemed pretty confident against
us."
Identifying the problem is one
thing. Fixing it was something com
pletely different for Horstmeyer's
crew. For the second time this year,
Stanford (21-2, 12-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference) dominated California (9-13,
3-10) inside. The loss was Cal's worst
since the team lost to Stanford by 51 at
Maples Pavilion during the 1996-97
season.
In Stanford's trouncing of Cal ear
lier in the season, the Cardinal domi
nated the game from the inside out,
led by Smith's 21 points in 17 minutes.
One might have expected the Bears to
make life difficult on Smith the second
time around by double-teaming her
and fronting the post occasionally.
Instead, Stanford's rival to the
north practically rolled out the wel
come mat for Smith and her 61.3 per
cent field goal shooting.
Over a stretch of six Stanford pos
sessions at the beginning of the game.
Smith scored on four of them,
matched up one-on-one each time.
Failing to bring help against Smith,
the Bears surrendered eight quick
points.
In 14 first-half minutes, Smith
scored 12 points, shooting 6-for-7
from the floor. She finished with 20
points on 10-for-12 shooting on the
night.
Despite Stanford's focus on scor
ing inside, the Bears' defense often
appeared to lose track of its assign
ments near the basket. When it hap
pened, Stanford's sharp passing made

it hurt by creating 22 assists, led by se
nior Kelley Suminski and freshman
Candice Wiggins, who dished out five
apiece.
Wiggins, the Cardinal's leading
scorer (17.0 points per game), contin
ued to build her Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year resume, racking up a game
high 24 points, seven rebounds and
the aforementioned five dimes. Wig
gins has scorched the Bears for 21
points per game this season on a total
15-for-21 shooting.
"What can you say about Can
dice?" head coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "She makes a lot happen for us
out there."
All the sharing by Stanford's of
fense added up in the paint, where Cal
surrendered an unofficial 53 total
points. The Bears had just 29 in the
paint.
The Cardinal also controlled the
glass, a goal of VanDerveer's since the
beginning of the week. Stanford out
rebounded Cal 41-34, but the contest
was actually more lopsided, as several
of the Bears' rebounds came with less
than three minutes to play and the
game well out of reach.
Carrying the load for Stanford was
senior T'Nae Thiel, who had 11 re
bounds in 23 minutes of play.
Thiel currently ranks 10th in Stan
ford history with 648 rebounds. She
needs just seven more boards to move
past Cardinal great Jennifer Azzi and
into ninth place all-time.
Cal struggled to put together solid
possessions on offense without a de
pendable weapon to distract from star
senior forward Leigh Gregory.
Although forward Kiki Williams
briefly auditioned for that role, hitting
her first three field goal attempts from
beyond the three-point arc, she quick
ly faded and failed to score for the rest
of the game.
Without a perimeter threat and

91 -50 pounding of Cal at Haas Pavilion in Berkeley. It was Stanford's 12th straight win at Cal.
without a dependable presence in the
paint, the Bears tried to create jump
shots against a Cardinal defense that
has given up a paltry 56 points per
game this season.
The result was an abysmal 20 per
cent field goal percentage for the
Bears in the second half and 23.3 per
cent for the night - their worst perfor
mance of the year.
"Stanford has not been known as a
defensive team," Horstmeyer said.
" I've watched a lot of their games, and
their defense is the reason they're able
to beat people by so many points. I re
ally feel that their strength this year is
defense."
An impressive recommendation,
considering Stanford's offense is
ranked seventh in the country in scor
ing.
Not only did the Cardinal outplay
their opponent on the defensive side
of the ball, but they out-planned the
Bears as well.
" I said. 'We're going to just bring in
a little wrinkle,"' VanDerveer said.
"So we went with our half-court trap,
which we have not played at all. all
year. We turned it over three times in
a row, scored, and that just gave us
that cushion."
The win was Stanford's 13th in a
row and the Cardinal currently holds a
three-game edge over USC for the
Pac-lOlead.
The Cardinal now begin prepara
tion for their final conference road trip
this weekend when they visit UCLA
and USC.
