# Offense powers softball

### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
It's supposed to be hard to hit a home run.
It's supposed to be something special to send
the ball 220 feet and out of the park. But the
No. 6 Stanford women's softball team (6-1)
made it seem so easy this weekend that it near
ly took the fun out of gathering at the plate to
congratulate a teammate on a successful swing.
Almost.
In their first two games of the Stanford Invi
tational tournament this weekend, Stanford
batters sent the ball over the wall a whopping
seven times. Freshman rightfielder Anna
Beardman hit her first collegiate home run, a
three-run drive, in the second inning of the
Cardinal's 18-0 victory over DePaul. Not satis
fied with one, she followed it up with a solo
blast in the third inning against Kentucky in the
Cardinal's second game, a contest that ended
in a 14-3 Stanford win.
Freshman third baseman Michelle Smith
added two home runs of her own, one in each
game, and finished the day with four RBIs.
Not to be outdone by the newcomers, junior
centerfielder Catalina Morris sent two out of
the park as well, hitting a three-run homer
against DePaul and a solo shot against Ken
tucky.
Though she only sent it out of the park once,
sophomore left fielder Jackie Rinehart made

her swing count, hitting a grand slam in the bot
tom of the third to give Stanford a 10-run lead
over Kentucky.
The offense was less potent against No. 21
Long Beach State on Saturday, but the Cardi
nal gutted out a 3-1 win to sweep the weekend.
"As a coach you wish every game was a
blowout," head coach John Rittman said. "Bui
it's good for us to play close games like that.
They're a very good team."
Stanford had an easier time than was ex
pected this weekend because of two Friday
rainouts. A game against Cal Poly and a
much-anticipated matchup with undefeated
San Diego State were both cancelled because
of the weather and neither could be resched
uled.
"You want to play," Rittman said. "You
never want to get rained out, whether it's tee
ball, Little League, whatever. We were really
prepared, ready to go, but there was nothing
we could do."
The team had hoped to reschedule one
game to make a Sunday double-header, but
Cal Poly opted not to stay.
The Saturday games against DePaul and
Kentucky were less of a challenge than the
Cardinal had hoped for, but they took advan
tage of the opportunity to give many players
game experience. No. 21 Long Beach State, the
