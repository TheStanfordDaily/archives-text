# Offense powers softball

### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
It's supposed to be hard to hit a home run.
It's supposed to be something special to send
the ball 220 feet and out of the park. But the
No. 6 Stanford women's softball team (6-1)
made it seem so easy this weekend that it near
ly took the fun out of gathering at the plate to
congratulate a teammate on a successful swing.
Almost.
In their first two games of the Stanford Invi
tational tournament this weekend, Stanford
batters sent the ball over the wall a whopping
seven times. Freshman rightfielder Anna
Beardman hit her first collegiate home run, a
three-run drive, in the second inning of the
Cardinal's 18-0 victory over DePaul. Not satis
fied with one, she followed it up with a solo
blast in the third inning against Kentucky in the
Cardinal's second game, a contest that ended
in a 14-3 Stanford win.
Freshman third baseman Michelle Smith
added two home runs of her own, one in each
game, and finished the day with four RBIs.
Not to be outdone by the newcomers, junior
centerfielder Catalina Morris sent two out of
the park as well, hitting a three-run homer
against DePaul and a solo shot against Ken
tucky.
Though she only sent it out of the park once,
sophomore left fielder Jackie Rinehart made

her swing count, hitting a grand slam in the bot
tom of the third to give Stanford a 10-run lead
over Kentucky.
The offense was less potent against No. 21
Long Beach State on Saturday, but the Cardi
nal gutted out a 3-1 win to sweep the weekend.
"As a coach you wish every game was a
blowout," head coach John Rittman said. "Bui
it's good for us to play close games like that.
They're a very good team."
Stanford had an easier time than was ex
pected this weekend because of two Friday
rainouts. A game against Cal Poly and a
much-anticipated matchup with undefeated
San Diego State were both cancelled because
of the weather and neither could be resched
uled.
"You want to play," Rittman said. "You
never want to get rained out, whether it's tee
ball, Little League, whatever. We were really
prepared, ready to go, but there was nothing
we could do."
The team had hoped to reschedule one
game to make a Sunday double-header, but
Cal Poly opted not to stay.
The Saturday games against DePaul and
Kentucky were less of a challenge than the
Cardinal had hoped for, but they took advan
tage of the opportunity to give many players
game experience. No. 21 Long Beach State, the
only other ranked team in the tour
nament, was by far the toughest op
ponent of the weekend.
Against a weak DePaul team,
Stanford's bench players got action
on the field and in the batter's box.
Even with few starters finishing the
game, the defense was nearly flaw
less and the offense was on fire. The
game was called at the end of the
fifth inning according to the mercy
rule, with a score of 18-0.
Twelve members of the Cardinal
roster had hits and eight had at least
one RBI en route to the command
ing victory.
"We've had a couple of games
where we've scored a lot of runs, got
a lot of people some action,"
Rittman said. "That's really good for
us. Everybody is getting an opportu
nity to produce and we're seeing a lot
of different combinations and, as a
coach you like to see that early in the
season."
Stanford pitchers junior Laura
Severson and freshman closer Lau
ren Nydam yielded only three hits
over five innings, and three straight
outs in the bottom of the fifth pre
served the shutout.
Stanford stayed hot going into the
day's second game, tallying five runs
in the first inning alone. Rinehart
started the scoring by reaching home
on a wild pitch from Kentucky
starter Meghan Cooper. Senior Leah
Nelson and freshman Tricia Ag
gabao had back-to-back RBIs and
Smith followed with a two-run
homer over the left field wall.
Kentucky's Katie Campbell got in
on the home run action in the first,
sending the ball deep to center field
to keep it close. Morris' solo homer
and an RBI single from Nelson gave
Stanford the 7-2 lead after two in

nings.
The Stanford bats would not be
quieted, and after some defensive
confusion left the bases loaded
halfway through the bottom of the
third, Rinehart took advantage,
sending the ball deep over the cen
terfield wall for the first grand slam
of her collegiate career.
"It was my first home run at all,"
she said. "It was awesome for it to be
a grand slam."
Moments later, Beardman's
homer made the score 12-2.
Stanford started the fourth with
six subs brought onto the field. Hav
ing yielded only one hit and two runs,
freshman righthander Becky McCul
lough got the rest of the afternoon
off and Nydam came in for the
fourth, and sophomore Danika
Dukes finished the game. Dukes
gave up one run in the fifth before
the mercy rule ended the game.
On Sunday, Stanford put up the
first run of the game when Rinehart
scored in the top of the third on an
RBI single by Nelson. Aggabao
added an RBI to give the Cardinal a
2-0 lead.
Nelson recorded her second RBI
of the game in the fifth, scoring Lau
ren Lappin, who had advanced to
third after the umpire ruled that she
was intentionally tripped rounding
second on a steal.
"I stole second and the ball went
past the second baseman," Lappin
explained. "I don't know if she
meant to trip me, but as I got up to
run to third, her foot caught my back
leg and I fell. It was an umpire's deci
sion and so I got the extra base."
With a 3-0 lead, Stanford ace Sev
erson went to the bench with the win.
She gave up only one hit and no runs
in six innings pitched. Nydam came
in to close out the game and gave up
one run in the bottom of the seventh.
The Cardinal finished the week
end a perfect 3-0 to bring their record
on the season to 6-1
