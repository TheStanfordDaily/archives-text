# Stanford defeats Kansas, 7-6
## Sorgi's double bails out Cardinal 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It didn't look like the No. 6 Car
dinal were going to need any late-in
ning heroics to complete a sweep of
Kansas (6-3) on Sunday afternoon.
But after the bullpen faltered in the
ninth inning, sophomore third base
man Adam Sorgi was ready to pro
vide them.
Sorgi doubled in junior John
Mayberry, Jr. with the winning run
and Stanford escaped with a 7-6 vic
tory after winning both games of
Saturday's doubleheader, 7-3 and 9-
2.
Stanford (7-2) coasted into the
final frame \vith a 6-1 lead, but Car
dinal pitchers could not find the
strike zone, allowing five runs to
cross the plate on four hits, three
walks and a hit batsman.
"They're not going to get [the
runs] if we make them hit," Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess said.
"They had four baserunners who
didn't earn it. That's what's disap

pointing to me."
Junior hurler Matt Manship
struck out pinch-hitter Jake Kau
zlarich with the bases loaded to pre
vent Kansas from taking the lead as
the game headed into the bottom of
the ninth inning.
Kansas pitcher Logan Murphey
pitched carefully to Mayberry, giv
ing him a free pass. Shortstop Chris
Minaker flied out to left, setting the
stage for Sorgi.
"I was looking for a fastball to
drive," Sorgi said. He laid off the
first one, but hit Murphey's 2-1 of
fering deep into the gap in right-cen
ter. "1 knew they were playing deep
to prevent a double, but I thought it
might be able to carry." The ball
nicked off the top of Kansas right
fielder A.J. Van Slyke's out
stretched glove and Mayberry beat
the throw to the plate.
The Cardinal came away with the
win, but it was in a more dramatic
fashion than they had hoped.
"I hope they do (learn from it)," Marquess said.
"Even when you lose you learn from it, that's why
you play the games. We were very fortunate."
The Cardinal jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the
first game of Saturday's doubleheader (Friday's
game was postponed by rain) on an RBI single by
Mayberry and a sacrifice fly by Sorgi in the first in
ning.
Junior Mark Romanczuk (2-1) pitched his way
into and out of trouble in the first four frames,
stranding six men on base. But he settled down
and retired 10 of the final 11 batters he faced. Ro
manczuk made his mistakes in the right spots, al
lowing only two runs - both on solo shots by
Kansas centerfielder Gus Milner - over 7 1/3 in
nings.
A two-run homer by junior Chris Lewis, his
third of the season, gave Stanford a 5-1 lead in the
fifth inning. They added two runs to the cushion in
the sixth on doubles by sophomore Jim Rapoport
and junior John Hester, who finished with three
hits apiece.
Sophomore hurler Greg Reynolds, who was
moved out of the starting rotation after two sub
par outings, came on in relief of Romanczuk and
closed the game out and allowed one run.
The Cardinal bats waited until the sixth inning
to do their damage in the second part of the twin
bill.
Kansas starter Clint Schambach had hitters
guessing through the first five innings, holding
Stanford to one hit. But they chased Schambach in
the sixth, tagging him with four runs and putting
seven up on the board before the Jayhawks could
get out of the inning.
Hester hit a ground ball double down the third
base line, driving in two. Two batters later. Mayber
ry sent Michael Fitch's 2-1 fastball deep over the
wall in left field for a three-run shot. By the time
Kansas got the first out of the inning, Stanford had

already put six runs on the board. The Cardinal
added another on freshman Michael Taylor's sacri
fice fly to center field.
Marquess said that a big inning like that one,
though a regular feat for last year's squad, will not
be typical this year.
"We're not as good on offense as we were last
year," Marquess said. "But hopefully we'll be able
to string some hits together like that."
Junior hurler Jeff Gilmore (2-0) made the lead
stand up, allowing only two runs, both in the first
frame, and scattering four hits and two walks over
seven innings.
Sophomore Matt Leva came on to seal the vic
tory, escaping a no-out, bases-loaded jam in the
eighth inning.
The Cardinal pitching was stellar on Sunday
until the top of the ninth. Freshman Nolan Gal
lagher got the start and pitched with composure
and good command of the strike zone, holding the
Jayhawks scoreless and allowing seven hits and a
walk over five innings.
Junior Jed Lowrie hit a towering home run. his
fourth of the year, in the fourth inning. The Cardi
nal scored four runs with two outs in the fifth.
Lowrie doubled in a run and Mayberry hit his
third home run of the year, a two-run run shot that
landed in almost the same place as his homer the
night before.
Sophomore Blake Holler pitched three solid
innings in relief of Gallagher, allowing only one
unearned run. But ran into trouble in the top of
the ninth, allowing two singles and a double be
fore being pulled for freshman Eric Davis.
Davis struggled with his control, walking two,
allowing a hit that skipped under Mayberry's
glove at first and throwing a wild pitch before
Manship took over with the Cardinal still leading
6-4 and the bases loaded.
But Manship had trouble finding the plate as
well. He hit Milner with a sweeping curveball,
forcing in a run. He got Ryne Price to pop out to
short and went to a 3-2 count on Andy Scholl be
fore walking him to force in the tying run. Then
Manship got Kauzlarich to strike out swinging,
setting the stage for Sorgi.

Saturday's doubleheader, 7-3 and 9-
2.
Stanford (7-2) coasted into the
final frame \vith a 6-1 lead, but Car
dinal pitchers could not find the
strike zone, allowing five runs to
cross the plate on four hits, three
walks and a hit batsman.
"They're not going to get [the
runs] if we make them hit," Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess said.
"They had four baserunners who
didn't earn it. That's what's disap

pointing to me."
Junior hurler Matt Manship
struck out pinch-hitter Jake Kau
zlarich with the bases loaded to pre
vent Kansas from taking the lead as
the game headed into the bottom of
the ninth inning.
Kansas pitcher Logan Murphey
pitched carefully to Mayberry, giv
ing him a free pass. Shortstop Chris
Minaker flied out to left, setting the
stage for Sorgi.
"I was looking for a fastball to
drive," Sorgi said. He laid off the
first one, but hit Murphey's 2-1 of
fering deep into the gap in right-cen
ter. "1 knew they were playing deep
to prevent a double, but I thought it
might be able to carry." The ball
nicked off the top of Kansas right
fielder A.J. Van Slyke's out
stretched glove and Mayberry beat
the throw to the plate.
The Cardinal came away with the
win, but it was in a more dramatic
fashion than they had hoped.
"I hope they do (learn from it)," Marquess said.
"Even when you lose you learn from it, that's why
you play the games. We were very fortunate."
The Cardinal jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the
first game of Saturday's doubleheader (Friday's
game was postponed by rain) on an RBI single by
Mayberry and a sacrifice fly by Sorgi in the first in
ning.
Junior Mark Romanczuk (2-1) pitched his way
into and out of trouble in the first four frames,
stranding six men on base. But he settled down
and retired 10 of the final 11 batters he faced. Ro
manczuk made his mistakes in the right spots, al
lowing only two runs - both on solo shots by
Kansas centerfielder Gus Milner - over 7 1/3 in
nings.
A two-run homer by junior Chris Lewis, his
third of the season, gave Stanford a 5-1 lead in the
fifth inning. They added two runs to the cushion in
the sixth on doubles by sophomore Jim Rapoport
and junior John Hester, who finished with three
hits apiece.
Sophomore hurler Greg Reynolds, who was
moved out of the starting rotation after two sub
par outings, came on in relief of Romanczuk and
closed the game out and allowed one run.
The Cardinal bats waited until the sixth inning
to do their damage in the second part of the twin
bill.
Kansas starter Clint Schambach had hitters
guessing through the first five innings, holding
Stanford to one hit. But they chased Schambach in
the sixth, tagging him with four runs and putting
seven up on the board before the Jayhawks could
get out of the inning.
Hester hit a ground ball double down the third
base line, driving in two. Two batters later. Mayber
ry sent Michael Fitch's 2-1 fastball deep over the
wall in left field for a three-run shot. By the time
Kansas got the first out of the inning, Stanford had

already put six runs on the board. The Cardinal
added another on freshman Michael Taylor's sacri
fice fly to center field.
Marquess said that a big inning like that one,
though a regular feat for last year's squad, will not
be typical this year.
"We're not as good on offense as we were last
year," Marquess said. "But hopefully we'll be able
to string some hits together like that."
Junior hurler Jeff Gilmore (2-0) made the lead
stand up, allowing only two runs, both in the first
frame, and scattering four hits and two walks over
seven innings.
Sophomore Matt Leva came on to seal the vic
tory, escaping a no-out, bases-loaded jam in the
eighth inning.
The Cardinal pitching was stellar on Sunday
until the top of the ninth. Freshman Nolan Gal
lagher got the start and pitched with composure
and good command of the strike zone, holding the
Jayhawks scoreless and allowing seven hits and a
walk over five innings.
Junior Jed Lowrie hit a towering home run. his
fourth of the year, in the fourth inning. The Cardi
nal scored four runs with two outs in the fifth.
Lowrie doubled in a run and Mayberry hit his
third home run of the year, a two-run run shot that
landed in almost the same place as his homer the
night before.
Sophomore Blake Holler pitched three solid
innings in relief of Gallagher, allowing only one
unearned run. But ran into trouble in the top of
the ninth, allowing two singles and a double be
fore being pulled for freshman Eric Davis.
Davis struggled with his control, walking two,
allowing a hit that skipped under Mayberry's
glove at first and throwing a wild pitch before
Manship took over with the Cardinal still leading
6-4 and the bases loaded.
But Manship had trouble finding the plate as
well. He hit Milner with a sweeping curveball,
forcing in a run. He got Ryne Price to pop out to
short and went to a 3-2 count on Andy Scholl be
fore walking him to force in the tying run. Then
Manship got Kauzlarich to strike out swinging,
setting the stage for Sorgi.
