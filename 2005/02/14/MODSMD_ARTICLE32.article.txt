# Stanford defeats Kansas, 7-6
## Sorgi's double bails out Cardinal 
### SEAN HOWELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It didn't look like the No. 6 Car
dinal were going to need any late-in
ning heroics to complete a sweep of
Kansas (6-3) on Sunday afternoon.
But after the bullpen faltered in the
ninth inning, sophomore third base
man Adam Sorgi was ready to pro
vide them.
Sorgi doubled in junior John
Mayberry, Jr. with the winning run
and Stanford escaped with a 7-6 vic
tory after winning both games of
Saturday's doubleheader, 7-3 and 9-
2.
Stanford (7-2) coasted into the
final frame \vith a 6-1 lead, but Car
dinal pitchers could not find the
strike zone, allowing five runs to
cross the plate on four hits, three
walks and a hit batsman.
"They're not going to get [the
runs] if we make them hit," Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess said.
"They had four baserunners who
didn't earn it. That's what's disap

pointing to me."
Junior hurler Matt Manship
struck out pinch-hitter Jake Kau
zlarich with the bases loaded to pre
vent Kansas from taking the lead as
the game headed into the bottom of
the ninth inning.
Kansas pitcher Logan Murphey
pitched carefully to Mayberry, giv
ing him a free pass. Shortstop Chris
Minaker flied out to left, setting the
stage for Sorgi.
"I was looking for a fastball to
drive," Sorgi said. He laid off the
first one, but hit Murphey's 2-1 of
fering deep into the gap in right-cen
ter. "1 knew they were playing deep
to prevent a double, but I thought it
might be able to carry." The ball
nicked off the top of Kansas right
fielder A.J. Van Slyke's out
stretched glove and Mayberry beat
the throw to the plate.
The Cardinal came away with the
win, but it was in a more dramatic
fashion than they had hoped.
