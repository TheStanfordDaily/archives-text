She has already qualified for the NCAA
Championships in three events, holds the
third best time in Stanford history in two of
them and recently recorded the fourth
fastest time in the nation in her signature
race, but Caroline Bruce just keeps getting
faster.
In the final dual meet of the Pacific-10
Conference season. No. 5 Stanford (7-1,5-0
Pac-10) beat No. 9 California, 172-128, for a
perfect conference record. At the helm was
Bruce, a freshman and 2004 Olympian, who
has emerged as the most consistent contrib
utor on a loaded Stanford squad. It was a
fast meet across the board, with twelve sea
son-high times for the Cardinal, and Bruce
led the charge.
Two weeks ago, her time of 1:01.24 in the
100-yard breaststroke put her in fourth
place nationally. Against Cal, she pared
that down to 1:01.19. her season high, which
is still fourth best in the country.
After the 100-yard breaststroke, Bruce
just kept getting better. Not satisfied with a
season high, she recorded a career high in
her next race, moving into third place na
tionally with a time of 2:11.08 in the 200-

yard breaststroke.
She rounded out the day with a victory in
the 200-yard individual medley, an event in
which she swam the fifth fastest time in the
nation at the Speedo Cup in November.
Though not a new high, her time against Cal
was again an "A" standard time. Junior and
fellow Olympian Kristen Caverly finished
second, also with an NCAA "A" time.
Caverly's fourth-place finish in the 100-yard
breaststroke was gwxl for a "B" qualifica
tion.
Bruce tallied a fourth win on the day,
swimming the breaststroke leg of the 200-
yard medley relay alongside freshman
Brooke Bishop, junior Dana Kirk and se
nior Lacey Boutwell. The NCAA "B" time
is the nation's seventh fastest of the season.
Kirk had one of her best meets of the
season, coming away with victories in both
the 100- and 200-yard butterfly, both in
NCAA "B" time. Kirk, a 2004 Olympian,
has been slowed down this season by injury,
but is showing signs of improvement re
cently.
"She's coming along well," head coach
Richard Ouick said. "She's struggling a lit
tle with a sore back so she's swimming pret
ty well considering that. I'm pleased with
where she is right now."

Bishop, who swam the backstroke leg of
the winning relay team, was Stanford's top
finisher in both backstroke races, with a win
in the 100-yard race and a second-place fin
ish in the 2(X)-yard distance behind Cal's
Helen Silver. Both times were season bests
for Bishop, and her second-place finish was
in NCAA "B" time.
Silver, a junior, and her freshman sister
Emily were the only individual winners for
the Golden Bears. Helens one win was in
the backstroke, while Emily swept the short
and middle distance freestyle, claiming the
top spot in the 50-, 100- and 2(X)-yard races.
Though Stanford did not come away
with a victory in any of these races, four
Stanford swimmers reached the "B" stan
dard and Boutwell and freshman Elizabeth
Durot both recorded season-high times in
the 200-yard freestyle.
Cal's fifth and final victory came in the
400-yard freestyle medley; the Cardinal
have struggled in this event all season, win
ning it only against UCLA. Though Stan
ford did not come away with a win this
weekend, the relay team did finish in sea
son-best time.
Though the freestyle relay is a weak

2004 Olympian Dana Kirk and the No. 5 Stanford women's swimming and diving team maintained
their perfect Pac-10 record over the weekend, demolishing Cal 172-128.
point, the individual long distance
races are a strength of the Stanford
squad, whose members swept the top
three spots in both the S(X)-yard and
l(XX)-yard free. In the 500-yard race,
Durot finished first, followed by
sophomores Desiree Stahley and Mor
gan Hentzen. Durot and Stahley both
finished in NCAA "B" time. In the
1000-yard free, it was Stahley claiming
the top spot with junior Lauren Costel
la and Hentzen right behind. Stahley
and Hentzen both swam season bests
in that race.
"1 thought that the distance swim
mers really set the tone for the meet,
going 1-2-3 in both events," head
coach Richard Quick said. "And the
divers went 1 -2-3 and that really hurt
Cal a lot."
Senior Ashlee Rosenthal, the vet
eran leader of the Cardinal diving
squad and a national title contender,
finished at the top of the standings in
both the one-meter and three-meter
springboard competition, the third
time this season that she has won both
events. In the one-meter, she was fol
lowed by sophomore Cassidy Krug,
another late-season contributor, and
freshman Katie Lampe. In the three
meter competition, Lampe moved up
into second with junior Sara Bowling
in the third spot.
With this win, Stanford finishes

with a perfect conference record, with
victories over five ranked teams in
cluding previously unbeaten Arizona.
The victory puts the Cardinal in a com
manding position going into the Pac
-10 Championships in two weeks,
though all teams start with a clean state
at the conference meet.
"It think it does give us a boost
going into the Pac-10 Champi
onships," Quick said. "However, in
swimming, the whole deal comes
down to the championships. So I'm
pleased with where we are, but we
need to be able to compete up and
down the lineup at Pac-lOs."
With only ten days between now
and the conference meet, team mem
bers are planning to balance work and
rest.
"We're in the taper phase of our
season," Quick said. "Except for a
handful of people who are already
qualified for NCAAs, we'll be getting
ready for Pac-lOs."
Bruce has already reached the "A"
standard in her three events, giving her
automatic spots in the national finals.
Lauren Costella has one "A" mark in
the 1650-yard freestyle. Caverly's time
in the 200IM on Saturday was good for
an automatic qualification as well.
While many other swimmers have
reached the "B" standard and thus will
be considered for qualification, it
would be ideal to get a few more guar
anteed berths at the Pac-10 meet.
The Cardinal has next weekend off
to finish training before heading to
Federal Way, Wash, for the Pac-10
Championships Feb. 24-26.
