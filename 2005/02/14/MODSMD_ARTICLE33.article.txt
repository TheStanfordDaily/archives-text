She has already qualified for the NCAA
Championships in three events, holds the
third best time in Stanford history in two of
them and recently recorded the fourth
fastest time in the nation in her signature
race, but Caroline Bruce just keeps getting
faster.
In the final dual meet of the Pacific-10
Conference season. No. 5 Stanford (7-1,5-0
Pac-10) beat No. 9 California, 172-128, for a
perfect conference record. At the helm was
Bruce, a freshman and 2004 Olympian, who
has emerged as the most consistent contrib
utor on a loaded Stanford squad. It was a
fast meet across the board, with twelve sea
son-high times for the Cardinal, and Bruce
led the charge.
Two weeks ago, her time of 1:01.24 in the
100-yard breaststroke put her in fourth
place nationally. Against Cal, she pared
that down to 1:01.19. her season high, which
is still fourth best in the country.
After the 100-yard breaststroke, Bruce
just kept getting better. Not satisfied with a
season high, she recorded a career high in
her next race, moving into third place na
tionally with a time of 2:11.08 in the 200-

yard breaststroke.
She rounded out the day with a victory in
the 200-yard individual medley, an event in
which she swam the fifth fastest time in the
nation at the Speedo Cup in November.
Though not a new high, her time against Cal
was again an "A" standard time. Junior and
fellow Olympian Kristen Caverly finished
second, also with an NCAA "A" time.
Caverly's fourth-place finish in the 100-yard
breaststroke was gwxl for a "B" qualifica
tion.
Bruce tallied a fourth win on the day,
swimming the breaststroke leg of the 200-
yard medley relay alongside freshman
Brooke Bishop, junior Dana Kirk and se
nior Lacey Boutwell. The NCAA "B" time
is the nation's seventh fastest of the season.
Kirk had one of her best meets of the
season, coming away with victories in both
the 100- and 200-yard butterfly, both in
NCAA "B" time. Kirk, a 2004 Olympian,
has been slowed down this season by injury,
but is showing signs of improvement re
cently.
"She's coming along well," head coach
Richard Ouick said. "She's struggling a lit
tle with a sore back so she's swimming pret
ty well considering that. I'm pleased with
where she is right now."

Bishop, who swam the backstroke leg of
the winning relay team, was Stanford's top
finisher in both backstroke races, with a win
in the 100-yard race and a second-place fin
ish in the 2(X)-yard distance behind Cal's
Helen Silver. Both times were season bests
for Bishop, and her second-place finish was
in NCAA "B" time.
Silver, a junior, and her freshman sister
Emily were the only individual winners for
the Golden Bears. Helens one win was in
the backstroke, while Emily swept the short
and middle distance freestyle, claiming the
top spot in the 50-, 100- and 2(X)-yard races.
Though Stanford did not come away
with a victory in any of these races, four
Stanford swimmers reached the "B" stan
dard and Boutwell and freshman Elizabeth
Durot both recorded season-high times in
the 200-yard freestyle.
Cal's fifth and final victory came in the
400-yard freestyle medley; the Cardinal
have struggled in this event all season, win
ning it only against UCLA. Though Stan
ford did not come away with a win this
weekend, the relay team did finish in sea
son-best time.
Though the freestyle relay is a weak
