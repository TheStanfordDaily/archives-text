# Davis too much for grapplers
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Even with six seniors taking the mat at Burnham
Pavilion for the last time, the Stanford wrestling
team (6-8-1.2-5-1 Pacific-10 Conference) once again
could not make up a six-point forfeit. The Cardinal
lost 21-14 to Bay Area rival and Pac-10 foe UC-
Davis (5-4-1, 4-3-1). Stanford's graduating class ac
counted for 11 of the Cardinal's 14 team points.
The dual meet came down to the last match on
Saturday night, with the Aggies leading the Cardinal
18-14. Stanford junior co-captain Imad Kharbush
took on Ronnie Silva, a highly regarded wrestler in
the Pac-10, needing a major decision to tie and a
technical fall or pin for the team win.
Since Kharbush needed to earn bonus points, he
could not afford to wrestle tentatively. After three
periods of exciting wrestling, including multiple
near-pins, Silva took the match in an 11-8 decision
and assured a UC-Davis victory. The Aggies' 174-
pounder will also reap the benefits of the win in the
Pac-10 tournament; Silva will be the top seed, while
Kharbush will be the second seed.
The meet started with a trade-off of decisions in
the first four weight classes. Stanford senior Ryan
Hagen dropped a 6-1 decision to Brandon Bear, a
top-five 184-pounder in the Pac-10. Hagen returned
to wrestling at 184 pounds after bumping up a weight
class to 197 on Wednesday to get a preparation
match for Bear.

The Cardinal then countered at 197 pounds as ju
nior Larry Ozawara recorded a comeback win over
Reed Shelger. Ozawara tied the match final period
of regulation and then recorded a two-point take
down for a 7-5 win in overtime. After Stanford se
nior heavyweight Shawn Ritzenthaler lost 8-4 to
Aggie Flvnn Ficker, his teammate, senior 125-
pounder Nathan Peterson, tied the team score with
a 4-2 victory of his own over Pancho Manriquez.
Continuing a theme that has plagued the Cardinal
all season, Stanford was forced to forfeit six team
points as they had no wrestler to compete at 133
pounds. Juston Johnson has not returned to the start
ing lineup since he was sidelined with an elbow injury.
The pin proved costly, as the Cardinal would
never take the lead or tie UC-Davis for the rest of
the dual meet.
Senior Chris Hay worth made up some of the for
feit with a 7-6 win at 141. Hayworth pulled an acro
batic reversal to propel himself over Jeff Bristol in
the final frame. The fifth Stanford senior competing
on the night, Luis Vendrell, dropped a 12-5 major
decision at 149 that gave UC Davis a six-point team
lead, 15-9.
One of Stanford's most accomplished wiestlers
in school history, senior co-captain Matt Gentry
wrestled on the Farm for the last time in his career.
The defending NCAA champion at 157 pounds
gave the home crowd reason to cheer once more as
he put on a free clinic in his match against Jesse
Padilla. Gentry earned the 15-0 technical fall early in

the second period. The Cardinal senior will try to
build on the past two wins going into the Pac-10 tour
nament. Already the only Stanford wrestler to win
an NCAA-title, Gentry hopes to make it back-to
back titles this March.
The meet was within one point with two weight
classes to go. Stanford freshman Scott Loescher
dropped a 15-8 decision to UC-Davis' Frank Rich
mond. The Aggies' 4 point lead then proved to be in
surmountable as Kharbush fell in his showdown
with Silva.
Stanford wrestlers say that their team record
does not reflect the successes that they have had on
the mat individually and in the practice room. Head
coach Steve Buddie has cited tough practices all
year, but injuries have forced the Cardinal to forfeit
at least one weight class in multiple duals this year.
The six-point handicap often proved to be a chal
lenge too tough to overcome.
Even with the graduation of six seniors, Stanford
looks poised for a strong regular season next year.
There have been great efforts from freshmen Josh
Zupancic and Rafael Chavez throughout the year,
along with many other underclassmen.
Both Stanford and UC-Davis will get their sec
ond chance against Pac-10 foes when all teams will
meet in San Luis Obispo on Feb. 27 and 28 for the
Pac-10 Championships. Based upon the results from
the tournament, the Cardinal will send their best to
St. Louis on March 17-19 for the NCAA Division-I
Wrestling Championships.
