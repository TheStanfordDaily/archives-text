# Stanford wins, loses Grunfeld for season
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Junior guard Dan Grunfeld dove head
first after a loose ball in the first half of Stan
ford's 71-56 win over Cal on Saturday.
Though the ball bounced out of play. Grun
feld's pure hustle effort drew cheers from
the Maples Pavilion crowd as he grimaced,
picked himself up and made his way back
down the court.
The next time Stanford's leading scorer
hit the floor he didn't get up so easily.
After taking a pass from junior point
guard Chris Hernandez, Grunfeld's right
knee gave way as he went up for a layup that
was blocked by Cal's Richard Midgley.
Stanford fans, who initially booed what
they felt was a no-call on a clear foul, grew
silent as Grunfeld, clutching his right knee
as play continued, lay motionless on the
baseline. Fans then held their breaths when

Grunfeld was helped to the training room
with 15:16 to play in the game.
An MRI taken at Stanford Medical Cen
ter after the Cardinal's 12th straight win over
Cal at home confirmed the worst: Grunfeld
will miss the remainder of the season with a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right
knee. No date has been set for the surgery,
which will sideline Grunfeld for six months.
What transpired after he left the floor
with the Cardinal nursing a slim four-point
lead was a testament to the resiliency and
closeness of this year's Stanford team.
"You want to fire up a team, take out
one of their guys," said junior forward and
Grunfeld's roommate Matt Haryasz, who
finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds.
"That's my boy. That's my best friend. I got
fired up after that and I think everybody
else did too. We had to take it to them."
