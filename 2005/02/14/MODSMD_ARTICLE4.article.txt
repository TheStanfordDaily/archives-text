# Stanford wins, loses Grunfeld for season
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Junior guard Dan Grunfeld dove head
first after a loose ball in the first half of Stan
ford's 71-56 win over Cal on Saturday.
Though the ball bounced out of play. Grun
feld's pure hustle effort drew cheers from
the Maples Pavilion crowd as he grimaced,
picked himself up and made his way back
down the court.
The next time Stanford's leading scorer
hit the floor he didn't get up so easily.
After taking a pass from junior point
guard Chris Hernandez, Grunfeld's right
knee gave way as he went up for a layup that
was blocked by Cal's Richard Midgley.
Stanford fans, who initially booed what
they felt was a no-call on a clear foul, grew
silent as Grunfeld, clutching his right knee
as play continued, lay motionless on the
baseline. Fans then held their breaths when

Grunfeld was helped to the training room
with 15:16 to play in the game.
An MRI taken at Stanford Medical Cen
ter after the Cardinal's 12th straight win over
Cal at home confirmed the worst: Grunfeld
will miss the remainder of the season with a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right
knee. No date has been set for the surgery,
which will sideline Grunfeld for six months.
What transpired after he left the floor
with the Cardinal nursing a slim four-point
lead was a testament to the resiliency and
closeness of this year's Stanford team.
"You want to fire up a team, take out
one of their guys," said junior forward and
Grunfeld's roommate Matt Haryasz, who
finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds.
"That's my boy. That's my best friend. I got
fired up after that and I think everybody
else did too. We had to take it to them."

Junior guard Dan Grunfeld reacts after tearing the ACL in his right knee on a layup at
tempt early in the second half of Stanford's 71 -56 win over Cal on Saturday.
While replays showed that
Midgley's block was clean and his
contact with Grunfeld incidental.
Stanford (13-9,7-5 Pacific-10 Con
ference) extended the lead to nine
two minutes after Grunfeld went
down and played inspired basket
ball until the final buzzer merciful
ly sounded.
The Golden Bears (12-10, 5-7)
closed to within three when Rod Ben
son converted a lay-up with 8:25 to
play, but Stanford sophomore guard
Fred Washington answered on the
other end with two of his six points.
Hernandez drained a three-pointer
less than a minute later to put Stan
ford ahead 55-48 and the lead would
not dwindle below five points there
after.
Stanford turned to a zone defense

to slow Benson and fellow post David
Paris. The duo combined for 21 points
in the first half, getting open for easy
lay-ups and dunks, but combined for
just 12 points after the break.
The zone's effectiveness was com
pounded by the Bears' struggles from
long range. Midgley, Cal's leading
scorer, shot 1-for-11 from the field
and l-for-8 from beyond the arc. Cal
hit just 3-of-16 three-pointers as a
team.
The Cardinal won the rebounding
battle, 45-39, as senior center Rob
Little tallied a double-double with 11
points and 10 boards. Little and fel
low senior Nick Robinson will end
their careers with a 6-2 record in reg
ular season meetings with Cal.
Grunfeld's diagnosis after the
game wasn't immediately known, as
he had to wait for the swelling in his
knee to go down before getting the
MRI. Before addressing the media,
head coach Trent Johnson visited the
training room, where Grunfeld told
him, "Great win, coach."

"Naturally these guys are down."
Johnson said. "This is a close group
and they all know how hard Danny
worked. But we also know there are
games to play. Someone is going to
have to step up offensively and defen
sively to keep this thing moving in the
right direction."
In addition to the starters, the
Cardinal's shrinking bench will have
to play an increased role in Stan
ford's postseason push. While fresh
man Peter Prowitt was limited to five
minutes due to foul trouble, fellow
freshman Taj Finger, junior Jason
Haas and Washington all played well
in significant second-half minutes.
Freshman walk-on Kenny Brown
could see some minutes over the final
six games as well.
"When a player goes down, your
team is faced with a choice." Cal head
coach Ben Braun said. "It's cither
going to step up, or it's going to look
around and go, 'Now what?'"
The Cardinal chose the former on
Saturday, moving them into sole pos

session of third place in the Pac-10 by
virtue of UCLA's loss at home to Ari
zona. The question now becomes how
Stanford will respond Thursday at
home against USC, as the harsh reali
ty of losing one of its best men sinks in
throughout the week.
From a purely statistical stand
point. Grunfeld's scoring will be the
hardest thing to replace. He was the
third-leading scorer in the Pac-10, av
eraging 17.9 points per game, and was
well on his way to another solid game
when he left with 16 points and three
rebounds.
A two-minute stretch during the
first half epitomized Grunfeld's of
fensive value. With Stanford trailing
13-7, he corralled a defensive re
bound and used two behind-the
back dribbles to drive the length of
the court for an easy layup. On Stan
ford's next possession, Grunfeld hit a
floater in the lane and a minute later
he drained a three-pointer to give
Stanford a 14-13 lead. Seven points,
three different ways.

While replays showed that
Midgley's block was clean and his
contact with Grunfeld incidental.
Stanford (13-9,7-5 Pacific-10 Con
ference) extended the lead to nine
two minutes after Grunfeld went
down and played inspired basket
ball until the final buzzer merciful
ly sounded.
The Golden Bears (12-10, 5-7)
closed to within three when Rod Ben
son converted a lay-up with 8:25 to
play, but Stanford sophomore guard
Fred Washington answered on the
other end with two of his six points.
Hernandez drained a three-pointer
less than a minute later to put Stan
ford ahead 55-48 and the lead would
not dwindle below five points there
after.
Stanford turned to a zone defense

to slow Benson and fellow post David
Paris. The duo combined for 21 points
in the first half, getting open for easy
lay-ups and dunks, but combined for
just 12 points after the break.
The zone's effectiveness was com
pounded by the Bears' struggles from
long range. Midgley, Cal's leading
scorer, shot 1-for-11 from the field
and l-for-8 from beyond the arc. Cal
hit just 3-of-16 three-pointers as a
team.
The Cardinal won the rebounding
battle, 45-39, as senior center Rob
Little tallied a double-double with 11
points and 10 boards. Little and fel
low senior Nick Robinson will end
their careers with a 6-2 record in reg
ular season meetings with Cal.
Grunfeld's diagnosis after the
game wasn't immediately known, as
he had to wait for the swelling in his
knee to go down before getting the
MRI. Before addressing the media,
head coach Trent Johnson visited the
training room, where Grunfeld told
him, "Great win, coach."

"Naturally these guys are down."
Johnson said. "This is a close group
and they all know how hard Danny
worked. But we also know there are
games to play. Someone is going to
have to step up offensively and defen
sively to keep this thing moving in the
right direction."
In addition to the starters, the
Cardinal's shrinking bench will have
to play an increased role in Stan
ford's postseason push. While fresh
man Peter Prowitt was limited to five
minutes due to foul trouble, fellow
freshman Taj Finger, junior Jason
Haas and Washington all played well
in significant second-half minutes.
Freshman walk-on Kenny Brown
could see some minutes over the final
six games as well.
"When a player goes down, your
team is faced with a choice." Cal head
coach Ben Braun said. "It's cither
going to step up, or it's going to look
around and go, 'Now what?'"
The Cardinal chose the former on
Saturday, moving them into sole pos

session of third place in the Pac-10 by
virtue of UCLA's loss at home to Ari
zona. The question now becomes how
Stanford will respond Thursday at
home against USC, as the harsh reali
ty of losing one of its best men sinks in
throughout the week.
From a purely statistical stand
point. Grunfeld's scoring will be the
hardest thing to replace. He was the
third-leading scorer in the Pac-10, av
eraging 17.9 points per game, and was
well on his way to another solid game
when he left with 16 points and three
rebounds.
A two-minute stretch during the
first half epitomized Grunfeld's of
fensive value. With Stanford trailing
13-7, he corralled a defensive re
bound and used two behind-the
back dribbles to drive the length of
the court for an easy layup. On Stan
ford's next possession, Grunfeld hit a
floater in the lane and a minute later
he drained a three-pointer to give
Stanford a 14-13 lead. Seven points,
three different ways.
Junior guard Dan Grunfeld dove head
first after a loose ball in the first half of Stan
ford's 71-56 win over Cal on Saturday.
Though the ball bounced out of play. Grun
feld's pure hustle effort drew cheers from
the Maples Pavilion crowd as he grimaced,
picked himself up and made his way back
down the court.
The next time Stanford's leading scorer
hit the floor he didn't get up so easily.
After taking a pass from junior point
guard Chris Hernandez, Grunfeld's right
knee gave way as he went up for a layup that
was blocked by Cal's Richard Midgley.
Stanford fans, who initially booed what
they felt was a no-call on a clear foul, grew
silent as Grunfeld, clutching his right knee
as play continued, lay motionless on the
baseline. Fans then held their breaths when

Grunfeld was helped to the training room
with 15:16 to play in the game.
An MRI taken at Stanford Medical Cen
ter after the Cardinal's 12th straight win over
Cal at home confirmed the worst: Grunfeld
will miss the remainder of the season with a
torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right
knee. No date has been set for the surgery,
which will sideline Grunfeld for six months.
What transpired after he left the floor
with the Cardinal nursing a slim four-point
lead was a testament to the resiliency and
closeness of this year's Stanford team.
"You want to fire up a team, take out
one of their guys," said junior forward and
Grunfeld's roommate Matt Haryasz, who
finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds.
"That's my boy. That's my best friend. I got
fired up after that and I think everybody
else did too. We had to take it to them."
