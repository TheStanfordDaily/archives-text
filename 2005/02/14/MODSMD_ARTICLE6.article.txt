# Amazon CEO speaks on innovation
## 
### NOAH WEISS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"When Jeff was an undergrad at Princeton
[in the 1980s], 1 was on the faculty and Jeff did
not take my database class," said Computer
Science Prof. Hector Garcia-Molina, who is
now at Stanford, in introducing Amazon.com
Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff
Bezos. "Just imagine where he would have
been today if he had taken my database class."
Bezos joked back, "It was one of my sin
cere regrets. Sometimes as an undergrad you
make the wrong choices."
Yet even though Bezos missed out on
Garcia-Molina's database class, he has capi
talized on the power of databases to create
Amazon, the world's largest store.
While a large Barnes & Noble might have
25,(XX) books and a large electronics store
might have 7,(XX) products, Amazon sells
tens of millions of products ranging from
hardcover editions of "Crime and Punish
ment" to iPods to diapers. They company's
distribution centers have over a million items
ready for instant shipment to any one of its 47
million customers. One of its warehouses is
more than a hundred times larger than any
Circuit City.
Hundreds of attendees gathered at Bloch
Lecture Hall on campus Saturday morning to
hear Bezos discuss how he created the online
bookstore in 1994 and remained on the cut-

ting-edge ever since.
'When I first wanted to name the compa
ny, I told my lawyer 'Cadabra,'" Bezos said.
"He said. 'Cadaver?' I knew that name was
dead from the start."
Shortly after, Bezos opened Amazon, ini
tially coding the homepage all by himself —
quickly noting that it lacked a search box.
Realizing that running a store with a mil
lion books was more than a one-man task,
Bezos posted his first job listing:
"You must have experience designing and

building large and complex — yet maintain
able — systems, and you should be able to do
so in about one-third of the time most com
petent people think possible."
This ad encompassed Amazon's corpo
rate culture: Get really smart people together
to innovate at an unfathomably fast pace.
That's why Amazon has the "two-pizza"
team policy, Bezos said.
Every team should only be as large as the
number of people two pizzas can feed, which
means that depending on the size and ap
petites of the workers, teams vary from five to
seven people.
"Innovation is a big part of the DNA at
Amazon.com," Bezos said. "The cost of ex
perimentation is lower in smaller teams."
The cost of experimentation is also re
duced due to the low amount of capital need
ed by each team to develop new technologies.
Unlike at a manufacturing company, where
engineers have to build huge and costly ma
chines to try new techniques, at Amazon soft
ware engineers only need relatively cheap
computer resources, according to Bezos.
Amazon is organized to minimize the
amount of corporate infrastructure teams
have to rely on. The goal is to "let people ex
periment without ever having to check in
with the higher authorities," Bezos said.

morning.
trical engineer at Princeton, Bezos
said he placed an almost fanatical em
phasis on data collection and perfor
mance metrics.
"Most companies aren't data ori
ented enough; they make too many
decisions on intuition," Bezos said.
According to Bezos, when the
data can't answer the question "you
want high decision senior level peo
ple who can make intuitive judg
ments in a very effective way" to fall
hack on.
Almost every feature on Amazon,
other than the general site navigation,
is essentially a new function devel
oped by a two-pizza team.
Teams often play off each others'
developments. For example, after
one team added a wish list function,
another team built a way to view the
most desired products across all the
customer wish lists. Bezos said the re
sults are often surprising.
The most-wished-for product in
the health and personal care category
is the Philips Heart Start Home Auto
mated External Defibrillator, which
is priced at $ 1,495, he said. Second on
the list is a Panasonic Nose and Ear
Groomer.
Bezos then pointed out the func
tion that allows customers to sort the
most-wished-for list by gender. When
sorted for men, the nose and ear

groomer soars to the top of the list.
"So I think we know where all the
nose and ear hair is," Bezos said.
"And I don't think it's on the
women."
While most features are tested ex
tensively and tweaked to increase
sales, there are a few notable excep
tions. One such feature is Instant
Order Update, which warns the cus
tomer that he or she had previously
purchased the item.
Bezos said he once wanted to buy
a Disney video on space exploration,
but he was foiled by the Instant Order
Update warning.
"I would've bought a second copy
and 1 would've been happy with it,"
Bezos said. "We've tested |the Instant
Order Update], and it hurts sales."
Throughout his talk, Bezos would
stop mid-sentence as soon as he saw a
raised hand in the audience.
In response to a question on Ama
zon's global expansion, Bezos ob
served that most of what customers
want and how they act is universal.
"Customers want selection, low
price and convenience," Bezos said.
"You don't go to Japan and they say,
'Wow I wish we could pay more.'"
In response to a student asking
about incentives offered to encourage
innovation, Bezos launched into an
impassioned speech.
"Selection of the people is the key
thing." Bezos said. "This may sound
tautological but it's actually not. Peo
ple who love to invent want to do that.
Their natural enemy is learned help
lessness. Most people wake up in the

morning and don't think, 'How can
the shower experience be made bet
ter?' You're not going to incent some
one who doesn't like to invent to in
vent."
Bezos added that it is important to
figure out ways to disproportionately
reward the company's best perform
ers, and that it's critical to find the best
people even if the system isn't very
egalitarian.
Helping Bezos find those people is
Robin Elzinga, one of Amazon's col
lege technical recruiters.
In the last two years, Amazon has
more than doubled the size of its in
ternship program. And next week.
Amazon will interview 48 Stanford
students for summer positions.
"Our internship program is the
number one source to hire gradu
ates," Elzinga said. "We probably
hire 30 to 40 percent of our new grad
population out of the internship pop
ulation and we'd really like to see that
grow."
Amazon recently hired seven
Stanford students for full-time posi
tions.
Echoing Elzinga's comments,
Bezos ended his talk by comparing
technological development to moun
taineering, and each area of innova
tion to a new hill.
"You may climb to the top of the
hill but it might not be the global opti
ma," Bezos said. "You have to be
continuously hoping you can get to
completely new mountain ranges
where you can climb up the hill
again."

rate culture: Get really smart people together
to innovate at an unfathomably fast pace.
That's why Amazon has the "two-pizza"
team policy, Bezos said.
Every team should only be as large as the
number of people two pizzas can feed, which
means that depending on the size and ap
petites of the workers, teams vary from five to
seven people.
"Innovation is a big part of the DNA at
Amazon.com," Bezos said. "The cost of ex
perimentation is lower in smaller teams."
The cost of experimentation is also re
duced due to the low amount of capital need
ed by each team to develop new technologies.
Unlike at a manufacturing company, where
engineers have to build huge and costly ma
chines to try new techniques, at Amazon soft
ware engineers only need relatively cheap
computer resources, according to Bezos.
Amazon is organized to minimize the
amount of corporate infrastructure teams
have to rely on. The goal is to "let people ex
periment without ever having to check in
with the higher authorities," Bezos said.
Trained as a computer scientist and elec-

Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO ofAmazon.com,
addressed a packed hall on Saturday
morning.
trical engineer at Princeton, Bezos
said he placed an almost fanatical em
phasis on data collection and perfor
mance metrics.
"Most companies aren't data ori
ented enough; they make too many
decisions on intuition," Bezos said.
According to Bezos, when the
data can't answer the question "you
want high decision senior level peo
ple who can make intuitive judg
ments in a very effective way" to fall
hack on.
Almost every feature on Amazon,
other than the general site navigation,
is essentially a new function devel
oped by a two-pizza team.
Teams often play off each others'
developments. For example, after
one team added a wish list function,
another team built a way to view the
most desired products across all the
customer wish lists. Bezos said the re
sults are often surprising.
The most-wished-for product in
the health and personal care category
is the Philips Heart Start Home Auto
mated External Defibrillator, which
is priced at $ 1,495, he said. Second on
the list is a Panasonic Nose and Ear
Groomer.
Bezos then pointed out the func
tion that allows customers to sort the
most-wished-for list by gender. When
sorted for men, the nose and ear

groomer soars to the top of the list.
"So I think we know where all the
nose and ear hair is," Bezos said.
"And I don't think it's on the
women."
While most features are tested ex
tensively and tweaked to increase
sales, there are a few notable excep
tions. One such feature is Instant
Order Update, which warns the cus
tomer that he or she had previously
purchased the item.
Bezos said he once wanted to buy
a Disney video on space exploration,
but he was foiled by the Instant Order
Update warning.
"I would've bought a second copy
and 1 would've been happy with it,"
Bezos said. "We've tested |the Instant
Order Update], and it hurts sales."
Throughout his talk, Bezos would
stop mid-sentence as soon as he saw a
raised hand in the audience.
In response to a question on Ama
zon's global expansion, Bezos ob
served that most of what customers
want and how they act is universal.
"Customers want selection, low
price and convenience," Bezos said.
"You don't go to Japan and they say,
'Wow I wish we could pay more.'"
In response to a student asking
about incentives offered to encourage
innovation, Bezos launched into an
impassioned speech.
"Selection of the people is the key
thing." Bezos said. "This may sound
tautological but it's actually not. Peo
ple who love to invent want to do that.
Their natural enemy is learned help
lessness. Most people wake up in the

morning and don't think, 'How can
the shower experience be made bet
ter?' You're not going to incent some
one who doesn't like to invent to in
vent."
Bezos added that it is important to
figure out ways to disproportionately
reward the company's best perform
ers, and that it's critical to find the best
people even if the system isn't very
egalitarian.
Helping Bezos find those people is
Robin Elzinga, one of Amazon's col
lege technical recruiters.
In the last two years, Amazon has
more than doubled the size of its in
ternship program. And next week.
Amazon will interview 48 Stanford
students for summer positions.
"Our internship program is the
number one source to hire gradu
ates," Elzinga said. "We probably
hire 30 to 40 percent of our new grad
population out of the internship pop
ulation and we'd really like to see that
grow."
Amazon recently hired seven
Stanford students for full-time posi
tions.
Echoing Elzinga's comments,
Bezos ended his talk by comparing
technological development to moun
taineering, and each area of innova
tion to a new hill.
"You may climb to the top of the
hill but it might not be the global opti
ma," Bezos said. "You have to be
continuously hoping you can get to
completely new mountain ranges
where you can climb up the hill
again."
"When Jeff was an undergrad at Princeton
[in the 1980s], 1 was on the faculty and Jeff did
not take my database class," said Computer
Science Prof. Hector Garcia-Molina, who is
now at Stanford, in introducing Amazon.com
Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff
Bezos. "Just imagine where he would have
been today if he had taken my database class."
Bezos joked back, "It was one of my sin
cere regrets. Sometimes as an undergrad you
make the wrong choices."
Yet even though Bezos missed out on
Garcia-Molina's database class, he has capi
talized on the power of databases to create
Amazon, the world's largest store.
While a large Barnes & Noble might have
25,(XX) books and a large electronics store
might have 7,(XX) products, Amazon sells
tens of millions of products ranging from
hardcover editions of "Crime and Punish
ment" to iPods to diapers. They company's
distribution centers have over a million items
ready for instant shipment to any one of its 47
million customers. One of its warehouses is
more than a hundred times larger than any
Circuit City.
Hundreds of attendees gathered at Bloch
Lecture Hall on campus Saturday morning to
hear Bezos discuss how he created the online
bookstore in 1994 and remained on the cut-

ting-edge ever since.
'When I first wanted to name the compa
ny, I told my lawyer 'Cadabra,'" Bezos said.
"He said. 'Cadaver?' I knew that name was
dead from the start."
Shortly after, Bezos opened Amazon, ini
tially coding the homepage all by himself —
quickly noting that it lacked a search box.
Realizing that running a store with a mil
lion books was more than a one-man task,
Bezos posted his first job listing:
"You must have experience designing and

building large and complex — yet maintain
able — systems, and you should be able to do
so in about one-third of the time most com
petent people think possible."

sults are often surprising.
The most-wished-for product in
the health and personal care category
is the Philips Heart Start Home Auto
mated External Defibrillator, which
is priced at $ 1,495, he said. Second on
the list is a Panasonic Nose and Ear
Groomer.
Bezos then pointed out the func
tion that allows customers to sort the
most-wished-for list by gender. When
sorted for men, the nose and ear

groomer soars to the top of the list.
"So I think we know where all the
nose and ear hair is," Bezos said.
"And I don't think it's on the
women."
While most features are tested ex
tensively and tweaked to increase
sales, there are a few notable excep
tions. One such feature is Instant
Order Update, which warns the cus
tomer that he or she had previously
purchased the item.
Bezos said he once wanted to buy
a Disney video on space exploration,
but he was foiled by the Instant Order
Update warning.
"I would've bought a second copy
and 1 would've been happy with it,"
Bezos said. "We've tested |the Instant
Order Update], and it hurts sales."
Throughout his talk, Bezos would
stop mid-sentence as soon as he saw a
raised hand in the audience.
In response to a question on Ama
zon's global expansion, Bezos ob
served that most of what customers
want and how they act is universal.
"Customers want selection, low
price and convenience," Bezos said.
"You don't go to Japan and they say,
'Wow I wish we could pay more.'"
In response to a student asking
about incentives offered to encourage
innovation, Bezos launched into an
impassioned speech.
"Selection of the people is the key
thing." Bezos said. "This may sound
tautological but it's actually not. Peo
ple who love to invent want to do that.
Their natural enemy is learned help
lessness. Most people wake up in the

morning and don't think, 'How can
the shower experience be made bet
ter?' You're not going to incent some
one who doesn't like to invent to in
vent."
Bezos added that it is important to
figure out ways to disproportionately
reward the company's best perform
ers, and that it's critical to find the best
people even if the system isn't very
egalitarian.
Helping Bezos find those people is
Robin Elzinga, one of Amazon's col
lege technical recruiters.
In the last two years, Amazon has
more than doubled the size of its in
ternship program. And next week.
Amazon will interview 48 Stanford
students for summer positions.
"Our internship program is the
number one source to hire gradu
ates," Elzinga said. "We probably
hire 30 to 40 percent of our new grad
population out of the internship pop
ulation and we'd really like to see that
grow."
Amazon recently hired seven
Stanford students for full-time posi
tions.
Echoing Elzinga's comments,
Bezos ended his talk by comparing
technological development to moun
taineering, and each area of innova
tion to a new hill.
"You may climb to the top of the
hill but it might not be the global opti
ma," Bezos said. "You have to be
continuously hoping you can get to
completely new mountain ranges
where you can climb up the hill
again."
