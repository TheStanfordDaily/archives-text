# Amazon CEO speaks on innovation

"When Jeff was an undergrad at Princeton
[in the 1980s], 1 was on the faculty and Jeff did
not take my database class," said Computer
Science Prof. Hector Garcia-Molina, who is
now at Stanford, in introducing Amazon.com
Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff
Bezos. "Just imagine where he would have
been today if he had taken my database class."
Bezos joked back, "It was one of my sin
cere regrets. Sometimes as an undergrad you
make the wrong choices."
Yet even though Bezos missed out on
Garcia-Molina's database class, he has capi
talized on the power of databases to create
Amazon, the world's largest store.
While a large Barnes & Noble might have
25,(XX) books and a large electronics store
might have 7,(XX) products, Amazon sells
tens of millions of products ranging from
hardcover editions of "Crime and Punish
ment" to iPods to diapers. They company's
distribution centers have over a million items
ready for instant shipment to any one of its 47
million customers. One of its warehouses is
more than a hundred times larger than any
Circuit City.
Hundreds of attendees gathered at Bloch
Lecture Hall on campus Saturday morning to
hear Bezos discuss how he created the online
bookstore in 1994 and remained on the cut-

ting-edge ever since.
'When I first wanted to name the compa
ny, I told my lawyer 'Cadabra,'" Bezos said.
"He said. 'Cadaver?' I knew that name was
dead from the start."
Shortly after, Bezos opened Amazon, ini
tially coding the homepage all by himself —
quickly noting that it lacked a search box.
Realizing that running a store with a mil
lion books was more than a one-man task,
Bezos posted his first job listing:
"You must have experience designing and

building large and complex — yet maintain
able — systems, and you should be able to do
so in about one-third of the time most com
petent people think possible."
This ad encompassed Amazon's corpo
rate culture: Get really smart people together
to innovate at an unfathomably fast pace.
That's why Amazon has the "two-pizza"
team policy, Bezos said.
Every team should only be as large as the
number of people two pizzas can feed, which
means that depending on the size and ap
petites of the workers, teams vary from five to
seven people.
"Innovation is a big part of the DNA at
Amazon.com," Bezos said. "The cost of ex
perimentation is lower in smaller teams."
The cost of experimentation is also re
duced due to the low amount of capital need
ed by each team to develop new technologies.
Unlike at a manufacturing company, where
engineers have to build huge and costly ma
chines to try new techniques, at Amazon soft
ware engineers only need relatively cheap
computer resources, according to Bezos.
Amazon is organized to minimize the
amount of corporate infrastructure teams
have to rely on. The goal is to "let people ex
periment without ever having to check in
with the higher authorities," Bezos said.
