# Bush budget could cut Upward Bound
## Program will lose funding if Congress approves the president's proposal 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A prominent Stanford tutoring pro
gram may soon be abandoned to make
room for President George W. Bush's No
Child Left Behind education law.
Upward Bound, a nationwide college
preparation program with a local branch
run out of the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice. is on the chopping block in the presi
dent's budget proposal for next year. If the
proposal is approved. Stanford Upward
Bound stands to lose its entire $350,000
yearly operating budget.
Bush is proposing to eliminate many
Department of Education programs in
order to make way for $8 billion more
funding for No Child Left Behind. In the
three years since that program was signed
into law, it has been widely criticized as
being severely under-funded.
Stanford Upward Bound currently

serves 76 students at four lower-income
high schools in the surrounding high
schools, according to Assistant Director
Brian Aguilar. The tutoring is provided by
roughly 40 Stanford student volunteers.
Aguilar said that word circulated with
in the education community that large
cuts would he included in the national
budget even before the proposal was re
leased publicly, and that work is already
underway at the local, regional and na
tional levels to save Upward Bound and
programs like it.
"Efforts will be made by the staff here
and at the Haas Center to make sure that
students that are served by these pro
grams continue to be served and that the
college students who are participating
continue to be a part of it," Aguilar said.
Staff members at the Haas Center have
indicated that they want to keep the pro
gram running, according to Aguilar, but at
the moment most efforts are targeted at
the national level, where Bush's budget
still needs to be approved by Congress.
Aguilar said that he would be advising
students, staff and administrators who
want to get involved to contact lawmakers

in Washington, D C.
" The difficulty is in not knowing
how long this budget process is
going to drag out," he said. "A lot
of the decision making about this is
going to take place in D.C."
Upward Bound is part of a clus
ter of programs, called TRIO, that
were created to provide education
al opportunities for low-income
and disabled Americans. Talent
Search — another TRIO program
that identifies and assists students
from low-income backgrounds
who have the potential to take ad
vantage of higher education —
would also be eliminated under the
proposal.
Cutting Upward Bound would
free up $312 billion in the Depart
ment of Education's budget. The
official budget summary claimed
that "the program has limited over
all impact because services are not
sufficiently well targeted to higher
risk students."
Upward Bound and Talent
Search currently serve about
455,000 students nationwide.
The local impact at Stanford
could be significant.
As Aguilar points out, "There
are a number of alumni who were
formerly a part of these TRIO pro
grams who currently either work at
or are actually students at Stan
ford."
Senior Maria Anaya received
tutoring through Stanford Upward
Bound when she was a student at
Sequoia High School in Redwood
City. Now she is the head tutoring
coordinator for the program on
campus.
Neither of Anaya's parents at
tended college, and she said that
Upward Bound provided her with
academic support throughout high
school. In particular, she said that
her tutors were critical in guiding
her through the application
process for Stanford and other col
leges.
"My favorite part about being
program coordinator is seeing a lot
of the students apply to college and
hearing that they got in," Anaya
said. "I just found out that one of
the students got into Santa Clara
University and that made me really
happy."
