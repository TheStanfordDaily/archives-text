afternoon, lielow is an excerpt:
" The last quarter-final game of
the intramural basketball tourna
ment will be played this afternoon,
when Sigma Chi meets Phi Kappa
Psi at 5:10 in the gym. This encounter
should prove to be one of the best of
the whole mural season, as both
quintets are composed of flashy
players who can sink in buckets with
great rapidity.
"Weaver, at forward for the Phi
Psi's, is one of the best shots seen
around these parts in a long time and
is high-point man of the mural tour
ney to date. Sigma Chi also has a
couple of 'eagle eyes' in Elliot, lanky
center, and Joujon-Rouche, speedy
forward.
"The winner of today's lilt will
qualify to meet Kappa Alpha, last
year's mural basketball title-holder,
in the semifinals to be played off
Monday night in the gym. Breakers
and Encina 4W Independents have

also advanced to the semi-finals and
will tangle on Monday night."

"Reports that the National Stu
dent Association (NSA) has been in
part subsidized from the 'early
1950's' until recently by the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
were confirmed yesterday by the
State Department. Officials admit
ted privately that the subsidy was ini
tiated in and that it had been
approved at 'high levels of govern
ment.'
"Spokesmen explained that the
program of secret aid was begun at a
time when Communist countries
were providing heavy financial sup
port permit members of Communist
youth organizations to travel and
participate in international events,
while American student groups
lacked such funds.
