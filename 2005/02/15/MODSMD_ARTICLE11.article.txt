# Mock weddings highlight demand for legalization of gay marriage
## 
### JENNY BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
To promote the need for legal recognition
of same-sex marriage, Stanford's Queer-
Straight Alliance, or OSA. held a "Freedom
to Marry Day" rally yesterday in White Plaza
that featured mock gay weddings complete
with cake.
Joanne Sanders, associate dean of reli
gious life, officiated the mock weddings, as
participants celebrated, accompanied by the
Stanford Band.
Senior l ess Williams said the purpose of
the rally was simply "to make people stop
and think."
Senior Hannah Leslie, the head of OSA,
said that now is an important time to raise
awareness since marriage had become such a
hot-button issue, especially during the presi
dential election.
Stanford is a very tolerant environment
for same-sex couples, Leslie added, citing the
school's domestic partner policy for its facul
ty and staff, which grants couples many of
the same benefits as those who are married,
as an example.
"OSA groups encourage people to be
more openly appreciative of people of all
sexual orientations," Leslie said. "People are
tolerant, but have unconscious homopho
bias. They need to be aware that not every
body is going to celebrate Valentine's Day
within the heterosexual mode of life."
Sanders said the event held a lot of per
sonal significance.
"I am openly gay and have a partner of 12
years and it would mean the world to us if we

could have the freedom to marry," she said.
She added that she was not aware of any
vocal opposition to the rally or her perfor
mance in it. even hy the Stanford religious
community.
"All of our events are welcoming and af
firming to the L.GBT community," she said,
adding that Memorial Church performs
blessings for same-sex couples.
The event held personal significance for
other community members as well, including
sophomore Johanna Sophie Santos Bassetti,
a Daily photographer, who took mock mar
riage vows with her friend, senior Shannon
Wood. The "newlyweds" danced around
White Plaza to the Band's rendition of "All
Right Now."
"It was a very rewarding experience,"
Bassetti said. "We've been friends fora long
time and we love each other very much. The
wedding, although symbolic, was also a show
of our friendship. 1 hope that with this, more
students understand that two people of any
sexual orientation deserve the same kind of
rights."
"For most students, it's a fun and celebra
tory event to bring awareness," Leslie said.
The rally coincided both with Valentine's
Day and the dates of last year's same-sex
marriages in San Francisco.
Freshman Laura Mesa, who attended the
event, stated that, "We need people to un
derstand. especially with what's been going
on in San Francisco and Massachusetts —
that people in love should be able to be mar
ried regardless of their sexual orientation.
It's a human rights issue."
Sophomore Anna Rafferty said that the

rally was important particularly in light of the
anniversary of the marriages in San Francisco.
"Even though Bush has been reiterating
that we need an amendment (banning gay
marriage], we need to show that this is an
important cause," she said. "Not just for

same sex marriages, but to show that mar
riage benefits in ways that are not always
rational."
According to freshman Helen Kwong, a
member of QSA, the University's accepting
atmosphere is no reason for same-sex mar

riage advocates to become complacent.
"Stanford is a tolerant campus, hut we
want to move towards appreciation and
recognition of rights and be active instead of
silent," she said. "It's a big step from campus
toleration to appreciation."

wedding, although symbolic, was also a show
of our friendship. 1 hope that with this, more
students understand that two people of any
sexual orientation deserve the same kind of
rights."
"For most students, it's a fun and celebra
tory event to bring awareness," Leslie said.
The rally coincided both with Valentine's
Day and the dates of last year's same-sex
marriages in San Francisco.
Freshman Laura Mesa, who attended the
event, stated that, "We need people to un
derstand. especially with what's been going
on in San Francisco and Massachusetts —
that people in love should be able to be mar
ried regardless of their sexual orientation.
It's a human rights issue."
Sophomore Anna Rafferty said that the

rally was important particularly in light of the
anniversary of the marriages in San Francisco.
"Even though Bush has been reiterating
that we need an amendment (banning gay
marriage], we need to show that this is an
important cause," she said. "Not just for

same sex marriages, but to show that mar
riage benefits in ways that are not always
rational."
According to freshman Helen Kwong, a
member of QSA, the University's accepting
atmosphere is no reason for same-sex mar

riage advocates to become complacent.
"Stanford is a tolerant campus, hut we
want to move towards appreciation and
recognition of rights and be active instead of
silent," she said. "It's a big step from campus
toleration to appreciation."
