# Dirty endoscopes provoke TB worries
## 
### BEA SANFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Hospital mailed letters to 92 patients
last week notifying them that they may have been ex
posed to tuberculosis.
The danger arose when three fiber-optic endo
scopes were cleaned using "alternative procedures"
while a sterilizing machine was out of order, reported
the San Jose Mercury News on Feb. 10.
The cleaning process sterilized the endoscopes suf
ficiently to destroy all kinds of bacteria except for tu
berculosis, which is particularly strong.
Stanford doctors emphasized that the chances of
any patient actually contracting tuberculosis were
very slim, especially since no cases have yet been re
ported, according to Sarah Sherwood, a Stanford Hos
pital spokeswoman.
However, the letters urged patients to come to the
Stanford Hospital fora free evaluation to ensure they
were not at risk.

So far no sign of tuberculosis has turned up. Sher
wood said.
"We're getting responses now." she added. "We're
well into the 92 letters," Sherwood said. "So far there
are actually no cases of tuberculosis, as we expected."
Sherwood said she thought the media did a good
job of letting people know that the chances of anyone
contracting tuberculosis were slim.
"I think the media coverage so far has helped peo
ple see that the risk is extremely low," she said.
The Steris machine, which is usually used cleans en
doscopes, was working off and on during the first few
weeks of December, according to the San Francisco
Chronicle. Surgical patients who received anesthetics
with those endoscopes during that time are the ones at
risks of catching tuberculosis.
Endoscopes are used only for patients who are
overweight or who have neck problems, and these pa
tients would only have been exposed to tuberculosis if
someone previously using the endo
seope happened to have the disease.
If anyone did contract the respi
ratory disease, they most likely
would be showing signs by now, re
ported the San Jose Mercury News,
which added that common symp
toms involve "persistent coughing
that may produce bloody spit, lever,
fatigue, night sweats, loss of weight
and appetite, painful breathing and
pain in the spine or large joints."
On Dec. 17, an operating room
supervisor realized the potential for
a problem and changed the steriliz
ing procedure. A research team
took a month-and-a-half to com
plete an investigation into the mat
ter, which led to the release of letters
this week.
According to the Mercury
News, associate chief of staff Dr.
Joseph R. Hopkins emphasized
that anyone not receiving a letter
from the Stanford Hospital had no
cause for concern.
