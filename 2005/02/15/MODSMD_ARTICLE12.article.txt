The Stanford Hospital mailed letters to 92 patients
last week notifying them that they may have been ex

The danger arose when three fiber-optic endo
scopes were cleaned using "alternative procedures"

the San Jose Mercury News on Feb. 10.

well into the 92 letters," Sherwood said. "So far there
are actually no cases of tuberculosis, as we expected."
Sherwood said she thought the media did a good
job of letting people know that the chances of anyone
contracting tuberculosis were slim.
"I think the media coverage so far has helped peo
ple see that the risk is extremely low," she said.
The Steris machine, which is usually used cleans en
doscopes, was working off and on during the first few
weeks of December, according to the San Francisco
Chronicle. Surgical patients who received anesthetics
with those endoscopes during that time are the ones at
risks of catching tuberculosis.
Endoscopes are used only for patients who are
overweight or who have neck problems, and these pa
tients would only have been exposed to tuberculosis if
