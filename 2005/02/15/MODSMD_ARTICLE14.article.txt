A professor at Stanford once predicted that hair
cuts would be outsourced to India. You might walk
into an empty barbershop, then sit quietly while
someone 10,000 miles away gave you a new hairdo
for 20 cents — operating the appropriate scissors
and razors via the Internet. 1 remember being skep
tical and double-checking whether my professor ac
tually had any hair. (He did.)
Nothing of the sort has ever happened, of course.
When Sen. John Kerry railed against the outsourc
ing of American jobs in last year's presidential cam
paign, he didn't have Ohio's hair stylists' voting bloc
in mind.
But maybe my professor was on to something. Su
percuts doesn't run a sweatshop full of barbers in Cal
cutta, but many computer companies do operate low
cost technical support centers in Bangalore.
And delicate surgeries increasingly take place
with doctors controlling instruments by computer. I
can even design my business card online using a Java
applet and someone, somewhere, etches it on paper
and ships it to me.
All of which leads me to wonder how many crazy
but innovative ideas disappear fora while and then
re-surface in new ways.
Here's an example: In 2000, just before the dot
com bubble burst, I took some time off from Stan
ford to work as a venture capitalist on behalf of a
Japanese company, Casio. (It says something
about those days in the Valley that people took me
seriously.)
Over the summer one start-up, zßox, came to us
for an emergency loan. Its business plan was to dis
tribute a new kind of mailbox to as many people as
possible. In exchange for receiving advertisements
in their new zßoxes, consumers would get free ship
ping from participating companies — say, eToys or
Pets.com.
The problem was, due to federal laws protecting
the postal service, zßoxes couldn't actually be put up
in front of houses. They'd have to be around the
side. Nor was it clear that any companies were inter
ested in signing up for what could turn into a very
costly program. And who would handle the actual
deliveries to the zßoxes? Someone suggested Domi
no's Pizza people during less busy hours of the day.
No loan was granted, the company sank and these
days you couldn't even find it with a Google search.
zßoxes? Crazy idea? Perhaps. But last week, Ama
zon.com announced Amazon Prime, a new service in
which consumers pay about $70 a year to receive un
limited, free second-day shipping.
Best of all, it comes to your front door. Maybe the
folks at /.Box were on the right track but were too
obsessed with the box itself when the real value of
the idea was to get consumers addicted to free ship
ping from certain companies, making them more
loyal customers.
Or maybe Amazon is crazy, too.
Other ideas may not be as crazy; they are just
badly marketed. During one of my first days at
Casio, someone showed me what looked like an old
television set in an empty office. "It's a two-way
TV." he explained.
To me, a two-way TV is one you can talk through
to someone else, like a videophone. I think I've seen
one at Epcot Center and there's probably a proto
type at a lab on campus somewhere.
However, this two-way TV literally showed TV
in two different ways. You could watch it like a nor
mal TV or you could roll down the screen and turn it
into a projector for home theater use.
It would be perfect for life in places where space
is at a premium, like dorm rooms: watch "Gilmore
Girls" privately, then show "American Idol" on the
wall for all your friends. However, it flopped, and I
haven't heard of anything like it since. Maybe if it
had been called a convertible TV, it would have
gone somewhere.
Before encountering all of this, I used to think
that most innovations inevitably succeeded. When I
heard that Kodak and Fuji were launching APS film
to replace 35 mm, I started counting down the days
until everyone had APS cameras.
But what really happened? People started buying
digital ones instead. Today, no one knows what APS
stands for — it's gone the way of Crystal Pepsi and
the Commodore Amiga, two other favorite flops of
mine.
Insights like these don't exactly qualify me to
write a column on innovation. My days with Casio
weren't a smashing success, either: Eventually, the
company shut down its Silicon Valley office.
I then returned to Stanford after spending some
time addicted to coverage of the Florida recount.
But I have some credentials: 1 like gadgets, I ma
jored in STS and I've sort of managed a technology
lab. I also used to read lots of science fiction and still
sometimes try to write it. My rental car today had
satellite radio in it — and I was thrilled.
That said, just because I like gadgets doesn't
mean that I always embrace the latest as the great
est. Case in point: Should those remote barbers ever
hit it big, I think I'll just grow out my hair or buy my
own set of clippers at \Val-Mart.
If someone's going to slice off my ear by accident,
I'd rather it be me than someone on another conti
nent, thank you very much. Though it occurs to me
that when 1 call 911 in hopes of getting it re-attached,
I could very well be talking to an operator in Kaza
khstan.
