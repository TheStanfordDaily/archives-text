# Global warming: A heated battle
## World to celebrate Kyoto Protocol start 
### MICHELLE KELLER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For many environmentalists, Feb. 16
will he a day to pop open a bottle of cham
pagne as the Kyoto Protocol, the first sig
nificant international accord created to
mitigate global warming, finally takes ef
fect.
The one important guest missing from
the celebration will be the biggest emitter
of greenhouse gases — the United States.
Although the United States signed the
1997 Kyoto Protocol during former Presi
dent Bill Clinton's administration, in
2(H) 1, Congress decided not to ratify the
agreement. Despite the absence of the
United States, however, environmental
leaders around the world are in high spir
its.
"This is the most important global en
vironmental agreement to come into
force," said Human Biology Prof. Armin
Rosencranz.
The legally-binding Protocol requires
36 countries to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions at least five percent from their
1990 levels between 2008 and 2012, the
first commitment period.
"Although the Kyoto [Protocol] tar
gets seem small, when one considers how
quickly carbon emissions have increased
since 1990 — over 20 percent in the Unit
ed States — an undertaking to reduce
even five percent from 1990 levels is
huge," Rosencranz said. "And it's a be
ginning: like Confucius said, 'A journey of
a thousand miles begins with a single
step.'"
Global warming: The reality
The recent movie "The Day After To
morrow" caused some to think that the ef
fects of global warming will be sudden and
catastrophic. While Los Angeles is un
likely to be swallowed by a tidal wave in
the near future, gradual warming over the
next century will create irreversible
changes that may have significant eco
nomic consequences.
Since the Industrial Revolution, high
concentrations of gases, such as carbon
dioxide and methane, have accumulated
in the atmosphere as the result of burning
fossil fuels. These gases have created a
layer that traps solar radiation and warms
the earth like a greenhouse.
Global temperatures are predicted to
increase 1.8 to 5.8 degrees Celsius over
the next century, according to the Inter
governmental Panel on Climate Change,
a body created by the United Nations to
assess scientific, technical and socio-eco
nomic information relevant to climate

change.
The effects of global warming are still
uncertain, but geologists predict that sea
levels will increase, possibly flooding
coastal regions. Rising temperatures may
also disrupt many ecosystems, leading to
an extensive decrease of biodiversity.
As a result of the many consequences
of global warming, international leaders
have congregated for many years to work
on an agreement to curb greenhouse gas
emissions. After holding numerous con
ferences, scientists and politicians created
the Kyoto Protocol in 1997.
Skeptical Environmentalists?
Not everyone believes that human ac
tivity has led to global climate change.
Bjorn Lomborg, author of "The Skeptical
Environmentalist: Measuring the Real
State of the World." claims that there is so
much uncertainty in climate data that en
vironmental groups and governments are
misleading people with worst-case scenar
ios. In his book, Lomborg writes that the
money spent implementing the Kyoto
Protocol would be better spent on im
proving conditions for the world's poor.
Biology Prof. Stephen Schneider, co
director of the Stanford Center for Envi
ronmental Science and Policy, writes on

his Web site that the media and many gov
ernments — particularly George W.
Bush's administration — are willing to en
tertain the claims of contrarians such as
Lomborg.
"[Tjhese contrarians are given dispro
portionate representation in the media
and by certain governments, especially
the Bush administration, so far." Schnei
der said.
Reducing emissions around the world
The Kyoto Protocol allows parties to
reduce their emissions through three dif
ferent methods: the cap-and-trade sys
tem, the Clean Development Mechanism
and joint implementation. The cap-and
trade system will grant each country "car
bon credits," which they can buy and sell
in a controlled market.
The Clean Development Mechanism
and joint implementation both allow de
veloping countries to become involved:
Developed nations can implement clean
er-burning projects in developing and still
have them count as part of their green
house gas reductions.
For now, only developed countries and
economies in transition (such as the for
mer Soviet bloc) are required to reduce
emissions. However, thus far, the United

States has refused to ratify the Protocol
unless developing countries are involved
in cutting emissions. Large developing na
tions, such as India and China, are pre
dicted to be major emitters of greenhouse
gases in the next few decades.
"[China and India] are going to engage
in vast economic expansion," said British
Prime Minister Tony Blair recently, ac
cording to the Associated Press. "The
question is can they do so in a way that is
environmentally sustainable? That is
where we need the dialogue. They need
access to the latest science and technology
to do that." The United Kingdom has rat
ified the Protocol and is committed to a
12.5 percent reduction of greenhouse
emissions.
While the United States will not partic
ipate in the first commitment period of
the Protocol, Rosencranz predicts that
the United States will eventually join the
effort to mitigate global warming.
"The United States can't stay out,"
Rosencranz said. "Post-2012, the U.S. will
undoubtedly want to participate. Mean
while, U.S. corporations as well as indi
vidual U.S. states will continue to be ac
tively engaged in reducing carbon emis
sions. The federal government will simply
follow their lead."
