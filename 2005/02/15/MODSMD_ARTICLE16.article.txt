# Students download music legally
## 
### AMANDA MITCHELL 
Downloaded music reigns as an
indispensable part of freshman
Kaitlin Arena's daily life. Her
iPod, full of digitized tunes, ac
companies her everywhere from
the gym to the laundry room to
the library.

The proliferation ot portable
music players like the iPod has
played a significant role in the rising
popularity of music that can be down-

loaded legally. The number of songs down
loaded from legal Web sites grew tenfold
between 2(X)3 and 2004. encompassing 200
million tracks from 230 online stores, accord
ing to the Associated Press.

Yet, the average Stanford student still relies on
other methods, such as illegal downloading or CD
purchasing.
"Sites like iTunes [online store) and Napster still
charge about $1 per song or $10 per album, and
when I buy online, I don't get the artist packaging

which is what I really want," said junior Dave Black
man, who started the our Tunes campus-based music
sharing network.
"I have the songs already off of peer-to-peer ser
vices, but I've started buying CDs to support somewhat
independent artists," Blackman said. "That lets me
show my allegiance to an artist, whereas buying from
Napster or iTunes [online store] gives me electronic
files that I can't show off or lend. I feel like in buying
music online, I'm paying roughly the same price fora
lower quality of music."
Freshman Nick Jackson also prefers music on CDs
to music downloaded off the Internet.
"I've purchased four or five songs from iTunes [on
line store], but I usually buy CDs," Jackson said.
"There's just more of a sense of ownership,"
Other students mainly get their music illegally.
"I've never bought digital music legally because 1
can get a wide range for free," said a freshman who
asked to remain anonymous. "I need certain obscure
tracks for dancing and choreography, and I can usually
find whatever I want on Lime Wire or Kazaa. Also, I
spent so much money on my iPod and laptop that I feel

I should try to get as much out of my original invest
ments as possible."
Despite the 7,000 lawsuits the International Federa
tion of the Phonographic Industry, or IPFI. has filed,
according to the BBC News, most students feel com
fortable using our Tunes.
"Though everyone is rightly paranoid about getting
caught for file sharing, iTunes sharing is allowed, and so
our Tunes on top of it feels fine to people," Blackman
said. The Apple iTunes program allows users to share
music files but not download them.
"It's also easier and faster than anything else; since
all hosts are local, searches and downloads are almost
instantaneous." Blackman added.
Liz Vrolyk, a junior, said she uses our Tunes almost
exclusively.
"I have never actually paid for music online, but 1 do
know plenty of people who have," Vrolyk said. "Be
sides our Tunes, my friends and I get a lot of our music
by plugging our iPods into each other's computers."
The growth of legal online music purchases,
which some analysts say could make up 25 percent
of record company revenue by 2010, has surprised

many students.

"I find it hard to believe
when it's so easy to find music

elsewhere," Arena said, re
sponding to that statistic.

These Web sites, which
usually charge a monthly sub
scription fee of about $10 and

a per-song download rate of
between 50 cents to one dollar,
range from the infamous and

newly legal Napster to a service for
AOL subscribers to the iTunes online
music store.

"I think their increasing popularity is

a sign that people are willing to pay for their
music, particularly if it's harder to find," Vrolyk

said. "Many people also have a certain residual
guilt, especially older people, and are willing to in
vest a small amount in legal online sites to feel bet
ter about their purchasing methods."
And others just find it more convenient.

"I've purchased 99 songs from the lTunes on
line store, mainly because it's a fast reliable site with
fast downloading capabilities." said junior Nick
Miyake. "Sometimes it takes half an hour to download
something illegally, so I'm willing to pay what I consid
er a reasonable amount for faster service."
Students said they like the ease of use that comes
with the iTunes store.
"1 really like the compatibility of the iTunes store
with my other Mac products," Miyake said. "There
aren't many restrictions on the iTunes store and quali
ty is guaranteed, while other sites have lots or do not
support Macs. Its music is easy to integrate, and there's
a wide selection."
The continuing growth of the iPod and the impend
ing popularity of cell phones with digital music capabil
ities will lead to an even greater demand for digital
download sites, IFPI officials predict. Miyake believes
this demand may create a market for the estimated 50
percent increase in downloaded songs for 2005.
"The i Pod is becoming so popular; if legal sites main
tain reasonable rates and fast service, I think that sites
like iTunes [online store] and Napster will be options
that many people will use," Miyake said.

man, who started the our Tunes campus-based music
sharing network.
"I have the songs already off of peer-to-peer ser
vices, but I've started buying CDs to support somewhat
independent artists," Blackman said. "That lets me
show my allegiance to an artist, whereas buying from
Napster or iTunes [online store] gives me electronic
files that I can't show off or lend. I feel like in buying
music online, I'm paying roughly the same price fora
lower quality of music."
Freshman Nick Jackson also prefers music on CDs
to music downloaded off the Internet.
"I've purchased four or five songs from iTunes [on
line store], but I usually buy CDs," Jackson said.
"There's just more of a sense of ownership,"
Other students mainly get their music illegally.
"I've never bought digital music legally because 1
can get a wide range for free," said a freshman who
asked to remain anonymous. "I need certain obscure
tracks for dancing and choreography, and I can usually
find whatever I want on Lime Wire or Kazaa. Also, I
spent so much money on my iPod and laptop that I feel

I should try to get as much out of my original invest
ments as possible."
Despite the 7,000 lawsuits the International Federa
tion of the Phonographic Industry, or IPFI. has filed,
according to the BBC News, most students feel com
fortable using our Tunes.
"Though everyone is rightly paranoid about getting
caught for file sharing, iTunes sharing is allowed, and so
our Tunes on top of it feels fine to people," Blackman
said. The Apple iTunes program allows users to share
music files but not download them.
"It's also easier and faster than anything else; since
all hosts are local, searches and downloads are almost
instantaneous." Blackman added.
Liz Vrolyk, a junior, said she uses our Tunes almost
exclusively.
"I have never actually paid for music online, but 1 do
know plenty of people who have," Vrolyk said. "Be
sides our Tunes, my friends and I get a lot of our music
by plugging our iPods into each other's computers."
The growth of legal online music purchases,
which some analysts say could make up 25 percent
of record company revenue by 2010, has surprised

many students.

"I find it hard to believe
when it's so easy to find music

elsewhere," Arena said, re
sponding to that statistic.

These Web sites, which
usually charge a monthly sub
scription fee of about $10 and

a per-song download rate of
between 50 cents to one dollar,
range from the infamous and

newly legal Napster to a service for
AOL subscribers to the iTunes online
music store.

"I think their increasing popularity is

a sign that people are willing to pay for their
music, particularly if it's harder to find," Vrolyk

said. "Many people also have a certain residual
guilt, especially older people, and are willing to in
vest a small amount in legal online sites to feel bet
ter about their purchasing methods."
And others just find it more convenient.

"I've purchased 99 songs from the lTunes on
line store, mainly because it's a fast reliable site with
fast downloading capabilities." said junior Nick
Miyake. "Sometimes it takes half an hour to download
something illegally, so I'm willing to pay what I consid
er a reasonable amount for faster service."
Students said they like the ease of use that comes
with the iTunes store.
"1 really like the compatibility of the iTunes store
with my other Mac products," Miyake said. "There
aren't many restrictions on the iTunes store and quali
ty is guaranteed, while other sites have lots or do not
support Macs. Its music is easy to integrate, and there's
a wide selection."
The continuing growth of the iPod and the impend
ing popularity of cell phones with digital music capabil
ities will lead to an even greater demand for digital
download sites, IFPI officials predict. Miyake believes
this demand may create a market for the estimated 50
percent increase in downloaded songs for 2005.
"The i Pod is becoming so popular; if legal sites main
tain reasonable rates and fast service, I think that sites
like iTunes [online store] and Napster will be options
that many people will use," Miyake said.

Downloaded music reigns as an
indispensable part of freshman
Kaitlin Arena's daily life. Her
iPod, full of digitized tunes, ac
companies her everywhere from
the gym to the laundry room to
the library.

The proliferation ot portable
music players like the iPod has
played a significant role in the rising
popularity of music that can be down-

loaded legally. The number of songs down
loaded from legal Web sites grew tenfold
between 2(X)3 and 2004. encompassing 200
million tracks from 230 online stores, accord
ing to the Associated Press.

Yet, the average Stanford student still relies on
other methods, such as illegal downloading or CD
purchasing.
"Sites like iTunes [online store) and Napster still
charge about $1 per song or $10 per album, and
