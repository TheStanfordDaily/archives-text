## Editorial University should explain Zuckerberg situation 
### 
When the University decided on Jan. 31 to cancel
1 hetacehook.com creator Mark Zuckerberg's sched
uled talk at Branner Hall, it should have provided stu
dents with a legitimate reason for the cancellation.
Instead, the University refused to justify its deci
sion and, consequently, angered many students. Fur
thermore, the resident assistants and the resident fel
low at the all-freshman dorm have refused to com
ment on the situation. Similarly, residents have also
been silent on the issue — reportedly, they received
instructions from their residence staff not to talk to
The Daily about the cancellation.
Rumors have circulated that the talk was can
celed because of Zuckerberg's alleged condoning of
underage and binge drinking, as evidenced by The
facebook.corn's proposed national Beirut tourna
ment, which Zuckerberg canceled on Jan. 29 after
receiving complaints from numerous colleges and
universities.
I'here was also confusion over the funding for the
event. Director ol Residential Education Jane Ca
marillo said her department denied requests for fund
ing by Branner's staff because the event "did not fall
within the parameters of allocating that funding."
Zuckerberg, however, said that he had planned to
speak for free, and because he lives nearby there
would not have been any transportation costs.
Zuckerberg should have been allowed to speak at
Branner. The University's decision not to let him do
so was an overreaction, regardless of one's opinion of
the University's newly instituted alcohol policy, which

does not allow freshman dorms to serve alcohol at
their events.
Though University administrators may have felt
that Zuckerberg condoned underage drinking, he was
not going to come to Branner and hand out free cups
of beer or tell students that they had to drink to be
cool.
The decision also represents unwarranted and un
necessary censorship of the types of speakers allowed
on campus. Plenty of controversial people come to
Stanford every year and give controversial talks that
incite students in different ways, and it is likely that
Zuckerberg's talk would have been modest in com
parison.
Even if the University felt it was necessary to can
cel the talk, it should have publicly announced its rea
sons for doing so. The University's decision to bite its
tongue does not help the matter in any way. Leaving
students in the dark in this situation only creates prob
lems.
In canceling Zuckerberg's talk, the University re
acted in an oppressive manner. The lack of dialogue
between the University and the student body in this
situation is distressing, and it damages an often-frag
ile relationship.
Instead of covering up its tracks, the University
needs to be candid with its students, explaining to
them the rationale behind its decision. Doing this
would go a long way in strengthening the rapport be
tween the University's administration and the stu
dents.
