# Holt's harangue
## Indiana Jones and the Viennese Ball 
### 
... Would be a great title lor a movie, wouldn't it? In
diana can try to find some rare artifact but ail of a sudden
gets caught in a Nazi-era gala, where he is humorously
chased by bumbling Germans as he dances around the
ballroom, switching partners. The climactic scene would
be when he dances with Hitler, and just when they are

about to catch him, Jones flings
Hitler into a well-placed multi-tiered
cake. He then leaves with a beautiful
woman and the artifact in hand.
Sound like a weird daydream?
Well, that's basically what went on in
my head when I first went to the Vi
ennese Ball this past Friday. 1 also
thought, "I should have taken social
dance." Oh well.
Stepping onto the dance floor and
seeing all the students dressed in their

finest was when I realized dating at Stanford had reached
a new low. Most students at Viennese had to mail order
attractive people for their "dates." You may think I'm
yanking your chain, but for those who went to the Ball,
ask yourselves: Have you ever seen any of these people
in any of your classes? Where could they have learned to
dance and still have time to fill GERs? Why do most of
them have Russian accents?
Me. I hired a mail-order date from Siberia named
Ulga. She was big and mean and didn't understand my
"stoopid American" sense of humor. She insisted on
leading, too.
I'hat was fine, because I've never taken dance lessons.
Somehow social dance couldn't lure me to its ranks with
its y a.m. start time. So I spent most of the night staring at
my hypnotically shiny black shoes and assuring Ulga that
she could get her green card for this.
Step, step, rock-step. Rock, step, crash into person
next you. Step, rock, tumble to floor (broken shoe heel).
Rock rock rock (Ulga holding me after 1 grew sleepy).

The Viennese Ball, if you hadn't heard, is very Ger
man. You could tell that immediately because it started
on time. The opening ceremony speaker slipped into
German sporadically. I didn't understand what he was
saying, which could have been life-saving information
for all 1 know:
"Welcome to the Viennese Ball. (Translated from
German: if you touch the ice sculpture, we will feed you
to the dogs)."
"Please enjoy the festivities. (Translation: take a look
at the fat guy in the cummerbund. Keep him away from
the buffet)
"We welcome all of our guests. (Translation: The fuhrer
demands Doctor Indiana Jones be stopped at all costs)."
The waltz itself is an exercise in German competition.
On the inside of the dancing floor you have the slower,
VW-like couples. On the outside you have the BMWs
and Mercedes speeding around the floor, trying to out
pace opposing couples faster than you can say
"blitzkrieg." While dancing on the outside lane, my date
and 1 were cut off by a really mean couple. Determined
not to be outdone, Ulga kicked our floating waltz into
high gear, throwing me like a ragdoll and scuffing up my
nice shiny shoes. As we finally passed the evil couple, we
turned into their lane, forcing them off the floor and into
the stands where they exploded in a flaming hulk. The
fans went wild and we got the checkered flag. Ulga lifted
me like I was a trophy.
Exhausted and nearly asleep, the rest of the guests
and 1 headed for the buses back to campus. Thankfully, I
was able to slip away from my date before I could fulfill
her wishes to "make me a man." She was probably a Ger
man operative, anyway. Indiana Jones will ride again.

Chris encourages the readers to substitute the word "arti
fact" for the word "ass" in the beginning paragraph. To re
mind Chris that there were no Nazis at Viennese Hall, send
complaints to cholt@stanford.edu.

ask yourselves: Have you ever seen any of these people
in any of your classes? Where could they have learned to
dance and still have time to fill GERs? Why do most of
them have Russian accents?
Me. I hired a mail-order date from Siberia named
Ulga. She was big and mean and didn't understand my
"stoopid American" sense of humor. She insisted on
leading, too.
I'hat was fine, because I've never taken dance lessons.
Somehow social dance couldn't lure me to its ranks with
its y a.m. start time. So I spent most of the night staring at
my hypnotically shiny black shoes and assuring Ulga that
she could get her green card for this.
Step, step, rock-step. Rock, step, crash into person
next you. Step, rock, tumble to floor (broken shoe heel).
Rock rock rock (Ulga holding me after 1 grew sleepy).

The Viennese Ball, if you hadn't heard, is very Ger
man. You could tell that immediately because it started
on time. The opening ceremony speaker slipped into
German sporadically. I didn't understand what he was
saying, which could have been life-saving information
for all 1 know:
"Welcome to the Viennese Ball. (Translated from
German: if you touch the ice sculpture, we will feed you
to the dogs)."
"Please enjoy the festivities. (Translation: take a look
at the fat guy in the cummerbund. Keep him away from
the buffet)
"We welcome all of our guests. (Translation: The fuhrer
demands Doctor Indiana Jones be stopped at all costs)."
The waltz itself is an exercise in German competition.
On the inside of the dancing floor you have the slower,
VW-like couples. On the outside you have the BMWs
and Mercedes speeding around the floor, trying to out
pace opposing couples faster than you can say
"blitzkrieg." While dancing on the outside lane, my date
and 1 were cut off by a really mean couple. Determined
not to be outdone, Ulga kicked our floating waltz into
high gear, throwing me like a ragdoll and scuffing up my
nice shiny shoes. As we finally passed the evil couple, we
turned into their lane, forcing them off the floor and into
the stands where they exploded in a flaming hulk. The
fans went wild and we got the checkered flag. Ulga lifted
me like I was a trophy.
Exhausted and nearly asleep, the rest of the guests
and 1 headed for the buses back to campus. Thankfully, I
was able to slip away from my date before I could fulfill
her wishes to "make me a man." She was probably a Ger
man operative, anyway. Indiana Jones will ride again.

Chris encourages the readers to substitute the word "arti
fact" for the word "ass" in the beginning paragraph. To re
mind Chris that there were no Nazis at Viennese Hall, send
complaints to cholt@stanford.edu.
