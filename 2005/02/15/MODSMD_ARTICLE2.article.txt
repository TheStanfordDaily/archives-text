## Residents voice their opposition

University Provost John
Etchemendy held a meeting
yesterday to discuss the size and
location of the planned Munger
graduate housing project and to
give community members an
opportunity to air their con
cerns about the proposed ex
pansion of Campus Drive and
other facets of the construction.
The plans call for four gradu-

ate student dormitories to be built between the Law
School and Campus Drive that would create 600 new
bed spaces for graduate students.
The buildings would range from three to five sto
ries in height and would possibly require the expan
sion of Campus Drive from two to four lanes. The
project will be funded by a $43.5 million donation
from Charles Munger. vice-chairman of Berkshire
Hathaway. Warren Buffett's investment group.
Etchemendy listed the benefits of the project, the
first being a much-needed increase of graduate stu
dent housing.
