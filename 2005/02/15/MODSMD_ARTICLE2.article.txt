# The 						Munger dorm
## Residents voice their opposition 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
University Provost John
Etchemendy held a meeting
yesterday to discuss the size and
location of the planned Munger
graduate housing project and to
give community members an
opportunity to air their con
cerns about the proposed ex
pansion of Campus Drive and
other facets of the construction.
The plans call for four gradu-

ate student dormitories to be built between the Law
School and Campus Drive that would create 600 new
bed spaces for graduate students.
The buildings would range from three to five sto
ries in height and would possibly require the expan
sion of Campus Drive from two to four lanes. The
project will be funded by a $43.5 million donation
from Charles Munger. vice-chairman of Berkshire
Hathaway. Warren Buffett's investment group.
Etchemendy listed the benefits of the project, the
first being a much-needed increase of graduate stu
dent housing.

"In 2(HX), there were graduate
students who were forced to live in
their cars," he said. " This is unac
ceptable. This project would bring us
closer to our goal of providing hous
ing for 85 percent of all graduate stu
dents."
According to Etchemendy, the
new housing would also benefit un
dergraduates because it would allow
the conversion of Crothers hall into
an undergraduate residence to ease
the housing crunch.
The new Munger buildings,
though adjacent to the Law School,
would house a variety of graduate
students, including law, medical and
doctoral students.
" This project would create link
age between academic space and
housing and would ensure commu
nication within the graduate com
munity," he said.
But many audience members, in
cluding residents who live close to
the projected construction site, said
they were worried about the project.
"People in the residential com
munity have tried to be very con
structive, but we feel like our con
cerns haven't been addressed," said
one resident in the audience. "My
main concern is the large size of the
buildings, the high density of the
area and the increase in traffic."
In response, Etchemendy said
that in accordance with the General
Use Permit, the development of the
central campus will naturally result

in areas of higher density.
" The CHIP puts growth boundary
requirements on our aeademie de
velopment and any less dense devel
opments are simply a waste of pre
eious aeademie space," he said. "As
it is, we have already addressed
many of the community's concerns
and significantly reduced the pro
posed height and length of the build
ings, but we can only do this to a cer
tain point."
Etchemendy also cited a current
traffic study being conducted by the
University, which demonstrates that
the project will only result in an in
crease of about 30 cars and a negligi
ble delay during peak hours.
Another member of the audience
proposed that the project be moved
down to replace Wilbur field. Hut
1 tchemendy quickly dismissed that
idea.
"Wilbur field is a principal recre
ation site for two of the major under
graduate dormitory complexes —
Stern and Wilbur — and is widely
used," 1 {tchemendy said. "Moving the
project to the field is not an option."
Other audience members ques
tioned why the entire project or at
least part of the project could not be
moved to Escondido Village.
"You have to understand that the
key point of this project is to create a
magnificent learning environment
for graduate students," said Kath
leen Sullivan, former dean of the
1 .aw School. "It is about putting stu
dents next to their classes so we can
create a dialogue about the law that
will be continued from the law
school to the dormitory. The acade
mic value of this project cannot work
if we move it to Escondido Village."

Sullivan said that as both a law
professor and a nearby resident she
understands both sides of the argu
ment, but the potential aeademic
value of the projeet overshadows
any ineonvenienees it eould eause.
Deborah Ilensler, another law
professor and eampus resident af
fected by the plans, agreed with Sul
livan.
"Compared to other universities,
such as Harvard or Yale, Stanford
has no law campus," she said. " This
project will help Stanford compete
with these other top law schools be
cause this is one of the first things
students look for when deciding
which law school to attend."
Law School Dean Larry Kramer
said that the 1 .aw School is starved
for both academic and residential
space and that new housing will cre
ate an important sense of communi
ty for these students.
1 imily I .eslie, a house manager at
('hi Theta Chi, located across the
street from the proposed site, pro
vided the undergraduate prospec
tive at the meeting.
"The most important part of our
undergraduate experience is the em
phasis on community building," she
said. "This building will isolate sev
eral co-ops from central campus.
This will have a great effect on un
dergraduate life."
Ltchemendy said that even if the
project fails something else will be
buiit in the slated area eventually.
" The University needs to use its
space wisely, so something will be
built here, and Campus Drive will
eventually have to be expanded," he
said. "It's really just a matter of what
and when."
