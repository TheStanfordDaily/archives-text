Hennessy's response to PAC is insufficient
Last Thursday, University President John Hen
nessy told a group of frosh in Branner Hall that he
was "dotting the i's and crossing the t's" of his re
sponse to the recommendations of the Presiden
tial Advisory Committee on Workplace Policies
(PAC). We are disappointed to find that his re
sponse. released this Tuesday, appears to contain
little more than those dots and crosses.
The Stanford Labor Action Coalition (SLAC)
has long advocated the adoption of a comprehen
sive labor Code of Conduct. Among this code's
provisions are guarantees for (1) worker educa
tion programs, (2) wage parity for temporary,
part-time and sub-contracted workers, (3) the
right to organize, and (4) a living wage policy
based on California Budget Project (CBP) stan
dards.
The University was inattentive toward the cam
paign until a week-long fast by six students in
spring 2003 compelled the formation of the PAC.
Though the recommendations of the committee's
June 2(H)4 report fell short of the vision of the
Code of Conduct, SLAC hoped that Hennessy's
final decisions would represent a substantial im
plementation of the PAC's proposals.
What we have, in Hennessy's response, is but a
shadow of his committee's recommendations and
a mere ghost of the Code of Conduct. Among its

major shortcomings, Hennessy's response fails to
provide universal wage parity. Contrary to the
Daily article "Hennessy OKs Labor Reforms"
(Feb. 10) and contrary to the recommendations of
the PAC, wage parity is extended only to laborers
who work more than 20 hours per week. Further,
Hennessy does not expand to new workers his
"living wage," which itself falls short of CBP mea
sures and is already drastically under-implement
ed on campus.
Finally, Hennessy's response mandates that a
"follow-up report" be issued to the public on Dec
31, 2(X)6. This casual evaluation looms a yawning
23 months away. That will be 29 months from the
appearance of the PAC report, 33 months from
the formation of the committee and 42 months
from the student fast that got it all started. 42
months of many more that workers on our campus
have gone without basic assurances of labor jus
tice.
Forty-two months, by the way, equals three
and-a-half years. By then, nearly every student
who can remember the fast will have graduated.
Hennessy's final decisions are not just slow, they
are grossly insufficient given the pressing needs of
campus laborers. Workers deserve better, and
they deserve it now.
