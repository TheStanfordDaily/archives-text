# Tales of a 19th-grade nothing
## The 						games these kids play 
### 
Stanford is an academic beacon
whose influence can be seen and felt
for miles and miles. There are actu
ally seminars held at California high
schools on how to get your son or
daughter into Stanford. I've often
heard the words "best and brightest"
thrown around casually, but one re
ally might expect that this is the
place where those individuals might

truly be found.
Think it's a
place where
you'd never ex
pect silly games
to be played,
right? Wrong.
Stanford kids
may not play the
same sort of games
that other college
kids do, hut theirs

■ just as ridiculous. Here are some
mat I've seen:
• "I'm a bigger slacker than you
are!" This is, by far, Stanford's fa
vorite game. In a school lull of band
kids, valedictorians and other such
type-A, overachiever geeks, the
claim is laughable if not just plain
sad. I cannot count the number of
times I've overheard students brag
ging about how hard they're not
working, that they just started
studying last night or how close
they are to failing right out of
school. Of course, you almost al
ways see those same students
studying in the library, sneaking off
to read ahead for class, finishing
their paper a week early or sending
off an application fora White
House internship. All the while
avoiding seeing anyone they know
and answering any queries over
their whereabouts with an IM away
message which reads, "Out party
ing! Don't call before noon, LOL."
Seriously, this campus is more clos
eted than Ricky Martin — the only
difference being that everyone
here is ashamed of being smart and
working hard. Listen: It's Stanford!
And everyone here is hard-work
ing and smart, OK?!
• "1 can wear flip-flops in cold
weather when you can't!" This is al
ways a fun one to watch. Now 1
know this is California, but accord
ing to my limited geographical
skills, this is northern California.

and it is not sunny all the time.
There is an identifiable winter, and
when the temperature is below 50
degrees, footwear that involves
socks is a pretty solid idea. But stroll
around campus on a brisk January
morning and you're likely to see
more than a few students smiling
their way through the early stages of
frostbite on their toes. Honestly
folks, despite the proliferation of
Abercrombie, Rainbow and Hollis
ter, few, if any, of us are actually
surfers and the ability to get sand
easily out of our footwear isn't that
big of a deal — especially when bal
anced against our health. Tell you
what, I'll just assume that you re
tough or that you have a fantastic
pedicure so you can go ahead and
put your dang shoes on, deal?
• "My skateboard's longer than
yours!" Okay, maybe 1 missed this.
Maybe this makes me old, but didn't
skateboards just use to be about two
feet long and something the slacker
kin your neighborhood would
spend too much lime trying to jump
over things with? Now you've got a
device that needs a runway to stop
and start and has about as much
functionality going uphill as if it had
square wheels. Yet, the erstwhile
young riders continue, year after
year, to show up with longer and
longer boards, soon to be even taller
than they are. And accordingly, I
imagine, as they get harder and
harder to control, I'll have someone
else to be looking out for in White
Plaza. Fantastic.
• Due to space constraints, I'll
simply name some of the others
(which I promise to cover in later
columns: We don't care about our
non-basketball teams very much;
Our band is worse than yours; 1 can
have all my meaningful interactions
electronically; and the ever popular
(and reversible) the girls (guys) here
are amazing, but there are NO cute
guys (girls). Remember kids, it's not
whether you win or lose, it's how
dumb the game you're playing is.
