## Jeff Dorman Sucks! Refs let rivalry game get rough 
### 
Tiger Woods was handed a simple piece of
white paper in the second half of Satur
day's Stanford-Cal basketball game.
There couldn't have been more than three sen
tences on it, just a watered-down message to the
extra special friends of Stanford Athletics. The
Sixth Men beside me peeked over Tiger's shoul
ders, calling out to the goll wonder to pass it back
like an Art History attendance sheet.
I was standing live feet behind Woods and

caught a glance.
In a large, bland font, the
message read something like
this: Dan Grunfeld has been
taken back to the Training
Room. He is undergoing an
extensive evaluation on his
right knee by the Stanford
Training staff. He will not re
turn to the game.
It should have read this:
Dan Grunfeld has had his

spectacular breakout season cut short. The next
15:24 of the second hall' is the start of Stanford
Basketball's second season of the year. Bring it
on.
Ask me what happened with 15:23 left, and 1
couldn't tell you. My eyes were trained on the
baseline, watching Richard Midgley rise from
Dan Grunfeld, who sat clutching his right knee.
Upon first glance, I thought that he had merely
knocked knees with the overrated Englishman,
and would hobble his way back down the court.
He'd be good in a few minutes and ice down
after the game; the only reminder of the collision
would be a bruise he'd forget about sometime
soon after.
But when Tomoo Yamada and Jon Surface,
athletic trainers, rushed on the court while play
continued on the other end, 1 knew the reassur
ances of a Stanford Events Services employee
were nothing more than blatant lies. You don't
go back to the training room to "tough it out".
You go to the training room because something
terrible has happened, because MRIs are in
order, and that's when they start printing out
pages for Tiger.
The MRI confirmed what we already knew -
a torn ACL. The end of Grunfeld's season. Our
top scorer. Our breakout performer. Our
biggest surprise. My girlfriend's secret fantasy. It
was all gone without so much as a whistle.
Burlet me back up. Let me set (he stage.
From the opening warniups. it was obvious
that this would not be any normal game. As Cal
was warming up, their big men took turns throw
ing down huge dunks right in front of the Sixth
Man Club. I'his is technically legal more than 30
minutes prior to the game, but certainly frowned
upon by those that "respect the game".
The Cal Straw Hat hand occupied a large
amount of the uppermost seating in Maples, fre
quently drowning out the Stanford Band. This,
while slightly comical, was certainly antagonis
tic. I mean, I've seen Drumline; I know what's
U P- ...
Now, while nothing I've mentioned is violent
or completely inappropriate, the point is, people
were psyched up. and without proper control of
the game by the officials, things could easily gel
out of hand.
The officials failed in their task from the
opening whistle.
From our very first possession, Cal's Martin
Smith acted like a foolish little moron. Starting
at point guard, he constantly reached in. but was
curiously granted a free pass by Pac-1() officials
who typically call hand checks. Smith continued
this play throughout, and the officials continued
