slow, but as they progress, the pace
starts to pick up. The next thing you

force, it's the end of the weekend,
you have no idea what hit you and
the weekend is a blur. That was the
story this weekend as the No. 7 Stan

two teams back to Arizona with a
pair of losses despite a slow start on
Friday.
The Cardinal began play on Fri
day against No. 33 Arizona and man

doubles position with an 8-5 victory
over Arizona. The Wildcats quickly
responded with a defeat of the same
score at the second doubles position
against senior Phil Sheng and sopho
more Eric McKean. However, at the
third spot, junior Jon Wong and
sophomore James Wan were able to
clinch an 8-1 victory to secure the
doubles points for Stanford.
The Cardinal began their singles
contests and were trailing in half of
the matches and tied up in the others
before the rain forced an early stop
to the day.
Under a clear skv on Saturday,

the team notched its fifth consecu
tive win.
Defending NCAA doubles
champions Warburg and Corkery
matched lip against former NCAA
doubles champion Andy Colombo
and his partner, Jonathan Kinsella.

Wan were handed their first defeat

tiebreaker.
In singles, Stanford's top three
players remained undefeated this
season and won the next three points
to decide the match against Arizona
State.

Warburg managed to break the Sun
Devil's serve. Warburg then served
out the first set 6-3 and won the sec
ond set 6-2.
Despite cracking his racquet on
the first point of his match, Corkery
won the first set without giving up a
single game to his opponent. How
ever. the junior quickly got down 0-3
in the second set. Corkery bounced
back to win the set, 6-4, and the
match.

letting the lead slip away," Corkery
said. "But I was able to refocus and

Sam Warburg and the No. 7 Stanford tennis team easily handled Arizona State and Arizona over the
weekend, winning 5-2 and 7-0
calm myself back down and win the
match."
The third singles match to finish
coincidentally featured the number
three singles position. Sheng picked
up a fifth consecutive singles win in
dual matches and the deciding win
for the Cardinal.
The second half of the singles
lineup had a harder time against the
Sun Devils, as all three matches split
sets. Wan and Kao played super
tiebreakers in lieu of third sets, be
cause the match had been decided at
that point. Wan picked up a win but
Kao, a loss. McKean was handed a
defeat at the sixth position in a full
third set, 7-6,4-6,6-1.
"Arizona State has some guys
who have been there awhile and
guys that are tough to play against,"

head coach John Whitlinger said.
"It's always great to win that doubles
point so you have to only win three
singles; I felt pretty good after win
ning the doubles point. [Arizona
State] is pretty tough up and down
the lineup."
On Sunday, the Cardinal com
pleted their match against Arizona
and won all six of the singles chal
lenges. Despite the fact that the Car
dinal were trailing half of the match
es when play resumed on Sunday,
Stanford quickly recovered and won
five out of six of the first sets.
"Everybody started off really
well and got a break really early,"
Corkery said. "(The rain delay] actu
ally worked out for our benefit."
While Corkery gave up the first
set, he collected the following two
sets to complete the sweep of the
Wildcats with a 4-6,6-3,6-3 win.
"The guys stepped it up a level on
Sunday," Whitlinger said. "We chal
lenged them a little bit and they re
sponded. That was nice to see how

they figured out what to do and they
didn't get upset and start losing it
mentally. They stayed focus and
stayed in the match and won. They
weren't going to lose that match."
Corkery agreed that despite
starting slow on Friday, Stanford
only improved with every match this
weekend as the team gained more
experience.
"1 feel like everyone played bet
ter everyday as the weekend pro
gressed." Corkery said. "Friday, 1
feel like we struggled some; we
didn't play our best. I feel like Satur
day, people started playing better,
and then Sunday, as we were kind of
in a rhythm and used to playing
matches, everybody was able to play
well. There's a match toughness that
comes with playing matches two
days in a row." «
Hopefully, that toughness and
momentum will carry the team
through the upcoming National In
door Team Championship held in
Chicago, 11., from Feb. 17 to 20.
