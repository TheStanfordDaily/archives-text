# Oregon's D-I debut spoiled by Cardinal
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON 
In the days before its season-opener at
Oregon, the Stanford women's lacrosse
team set lofty goals.
"We are looking to set our own stan
dard of play in our first game against Ore
gon," senior co-captain and midfielder
Kelsey Twist said prior to the Saturday
matchup. "We want to prove to ourselves
that we can he ready to play tough from the
first whistle, and not let the scoreboard dic
tate our performance. This spring is Ore
gon's first season as a Division I team and
we hope to show them what top D-I com
petition is really like."
The Cardinal can consider the mission
accomplished as they rolled to a dominant
19-6 victory.
"Once we got the momentum in the
game, we held it," head coach Michelle
Uhlfelder said. "Our offense played at a
great pace and our shooting percentage
was very good. We had some really good
defensive stops."
The first few minutes gave no indication
of Stanford's impending offensive explo
sion, as Oregon jumped to 2-0 and 4-2
leads.

"We didn't get the first live draws and
they got two goals off of that," Uhlfelder
said. "You have to get the draw - draws
keep possession and you need to have that.
They had a lot of chances at the net and
were going top speed off'of adrenaline."
However. Stanford quickly managed to
respond, jumping to a 10-4 halftime lead,
and Oregon never threatened again.
"I think once our team got the ball on
the attack it was just a matter of exposing
Oregon's weaknesses," junior attacker
Sarah Bach said. "They were really good
for their first year and first game, hut it was
a matter of maturity and we decided just to
score and win once the game was close."
The final score of 19-6 would include of
fensive contributions from many players,
some familiar and some new. Sophomore
midfielder Elizabeth Piselli led all Stanford
scorers with five goals.
"Our offense was moving really well
and really smoothly which was something
we've had trouble with in the past," Piselli
said. "Everything was just working and it fi
nally felt good to break through a barrier of
not being able to score last year. The team
was working really well and everyone was
hustling."
Piselli's five goals tie for the
third-highest single-game goal
total in school history, and are
made all the more remarkable be
cause Piselli is coming off a fresh
man year in which she scored only
three goals all season.
"Last year, it was tough," Piselli
said. "It was a confidence problem.
This year I feel more confident in
my skills. I'm sick of not being con
fident. I remember being a kid and
just being so confident and so
happy and I'm trying every day in
practice to put myself in that mind
set. I hope my confidence has
turned around for the rest of the
year."
Senior midfielder Nina Pantano
said she believes Piselli has found
that confidence.
"Last season at the beginning of
the year she was struggling, maybe
with her own confidence, but she
came on at the end of the season
and 1 knew to expect [Piselli to play
well] this year." Pantano said.
"She's our fastest player running
up and down the field. I'm really
happy she has the confidence to
know that if she runs up the field it's
hard to stop her. I know it's not
going to take a couple of games like
it did last season - she's ready to
go."
Bach also played one of the bet
ter games of her career, adding four
scores to the final tally of 19.
"Sarah really had a big role in
changing the momentum for us,"
Uhlfelder said. "She put the first
couple of goals in the net, created
space for herself in the scoring area

and had a couple of great fakes
freezing the goalkeeper and then
shooting around her."
Pantano also netted four scores,
combining with Bach and Piselli to
account for 13 goals.
"I kind of get on a roll," Pantano
said. "Once 1 get scoring it's so easy
to keep scoring. Two of my goals
were very similar eight-meter
shots. I kind of stood and cranked
them. I shoot high a lot, which isn't
always good, but if the shots are fast
enough they'll go in. The other two
were on fast breaks. [Junior attack]
Megan Burker and I had a really
great give-and-go and I think those
goals are more exciting because
I'm connecting on my passes."
"Nina played hard," Uhlfelder
said. "She definitely found herself
successful in the eight-meter arc. I
remember one goal where she used
her strength and muscle to blow by
the goalkeeper. She plays with a lot
of confidence and is a good target
for her teammates."
Bach had a simpler explanation
for Pantano's success.
"Once Nina starts shooting,
goalies get scared," Bach said.
Burker's three scores, freshman
attack Daphne Patterson's two
scores and senior co-captain mid
fielder Kelsey Twist's one goal
completed the Stanford scoring.
"We had a lot of opportunities
to receive the ball in the sweet spot
of the eight-meter arc and we had a
lot of opportunities to go at full
speed to the goal," Uhlfelder said.
"Honestly, the biggest factor was
the movement of the rest of our at
tack. 1 thought all seven in the at
tacking end did a good job threat
ening and moving."
Stanford's next test comes this
upcoming weekend, as the Cardi
nal will travel to UC-Davis and
Saint Mary's.

third-highest single-game goal
total in school history, and are
made all the more remarkable be
cause Piselli is coming off a fresh
man year in which she scored only
three goals all season.
"Last year, it was tough," Piselli
said. "It was a confidence problem.
This year I feel more confident in
my skills. I'm sick of not being con
fident. I remember being a kid and
just being so confident and so
happy and I'm trying every day in
practice to put myself in that mind
set. I hope my confidence has
turned around for the rest of the
year."
Senior midfielder Nina Pantano
said she believes Piselli has found
that confidence.
"Last season at the beginning of
the year she was struggling, maybe
with her own confidence, but she
came on at the end of the season
and 1 knew to expect [Piselli to play
well] this year." Pantano said.
"She's our fastest player running
up and down the field. I'm really
happy she has the confidence to
know that if she runs up the field it's
hard to stop her. I know it's not
going to take a couple of games like
it did last season - she's ready to
go."
Bach also played one of the bet
ter games of her career, adding four
scores to the final tally of 19.
"Sarah really had a big role in
changing the momentum for us,"
Uhlfelder said. "She put the first
couple of goals in the net, created
space for herself in the scoring area

and had a couple of great fakes
freezing the goalkeeper and then
shooting around her."
Pantano also netted four scores,
combining with Bach and Piselli to
account for 13 goals.
"I kind of get on a roll," Pantano
said. "Once 1 get scoring it's so easy
to keep scoring. Two of my goals
were very similar eight-meter
shots. I kind of stood and cranked
them. I shoot high a lot, which isn't
always good, but if the shots are fast
enough they'll go in. The other two
were on fast breaks. [Junior attack]
Megan Burker and I had a really
great give-and-go and I think those
goals are more exciting because
I'm connecting on my passes."
"Nina played hard," Uhlfelder
said. "She definitely found herself
successful in the eight-meter arc. I
remember one goal where she used
her strength and muscle to blow by
the goalkeeper. She plays with a lot
of confidence and is a good target
for her teammates."
Bach had a simpler explanation
for Pantano's success.
"Once Nina starts shooting,
goalies get scared," Bach said.
Burker's three scores, freshman
attack Daphne Patterson's two
scores and senior co-captain mid
fielder Kelsey Twist's one goal
completed the Stanford scoring.
"We had a lot of opportunities
to receive the ball in the sweet spot
of the eight-meter arc and we had a
lot of opportunities to go at full
speed to the goal," Uhlfelder said.
"Honestly, the biggest factor was
the movement of the rest of our at
tack. 1 thought all seven in the at
tacking end did a good job threat
ening and moving."
Stanford's next test comes this
upcoming weekend, as the Cardi
nal will travel to UC-Davis and
Saint Mary's.

Senior midfielder Nina Patano scored four goals for the Cardinal as they routed Oregon in its
Division I debut, 19-6.
In the days before its season-opener at
Oregon, the Stanford women's lacrosse
team set lofty goals.
"We are looking to set our own stan
dard of play in our first game against Ore
gon," senior co-captain and midfielder
Kelsey Twist said prior to the Saturday
matchup. "We want to prove to ourselves
that we can he ready to play tough from the
first whistle, and not let the scoreboard dic
tate our performance. This spring is Ore
gon's first season as a Division I team and
we hope to show them what top D-I com
petition is really like."
The Cardinal can consider the mission
accomplished as they rolled to a dominant
19-6 victory.
"Once we got the momentum in the
game, we held it," head coach Michelle
Uhlfelder said. "Our offense played at a
great pace and our shooting percentage
was very good. We had some really good
defensive stops."
The first few minutes gave no indication
of Stanford's impending offensive explo
sion, as Oregon jumped to 2-0 and 4-2
leads.

"We didn't get the first live draws and
they got two goals off of that," Uhlfelder
said. "You have to get the draw - draws
keep possession and you need to have that.
They had a lot of chances at the net and
were going top speed off'of adrenaline."
However. Stanford quickly managed to
respond, jumping to a 10-4 halftime lead,
and Oregon never threatened again.
"I think once our team got the ball on
the attack it was just a matter of exposing
Oregon's weaknesses," junior attacker
Sarah Bach said. "They were really good
for their first year and first game, hut it was
a matter of maturity and we decided just to
score and win once the game was close."
The final score of 19-6 would include of
fensive contributions from many players,
some familiar and some new. Sophomore
midfielder Elizabeth Piselli led all Stanford
scorers with five goals.
"Our offense was moving really well
and really smoothly which was something
we've had trouble with in the past," Piselli
said. "Everything was just working and it fi
nally felt good to break through a barrier of
not being able to score last year. The team
was working really well and everyone was
hustling."
Piselli's five goals tie for the
third-highest single-game goal
total in school history, and are
