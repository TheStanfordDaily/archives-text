In the days before its season-opener at
Oregon, the Stanford women's lacrosse
team set lofty goals.
"We are looking to set our own stan
dard of play in our first game against Ore
gon," senior co-captain and midfielder
Kelsey Twist said prior to the Saturday
matchup. "We want to prove to ourselves

first whistle, and not let the scoreboard dic

The final score of 19-6 would include of
fensive contributions from many players,
some familiar and some new. Sophomore
midfielder Elizabeth Piselli led all Stanford
scorers with five goals.
"Our offense was moving really well
and really smoothly which was something
