## Seyi shows going pro ain't easy 
### 
The Stanford soccer media guide de
scribes senior Seyi Abolaji as a versa
tile midfielder and defender who has
steadily improved over the course of his col
lege career. Those of us who know him out
side of soccer would describe him as kind and
sincere. We would talk about how he re
members people's names, even after he has
met them only once. We would talk about
how he asks about our families and always
has a smile on his face.
After a successful season. Seyi. who still
has a year of eligibility left because of a med
ical redshirt, decided to leave the Farm and
try his luck at professional soccer in Europe.
It is an unusual career path fora Stanford stu
dent. (Ryan Nelson, class of 2001, is playing
for Blackburn in the English Premier
League.) We hear about the occasional bas
ketball or football player who makes the leap
to the next level, and we have seen numerous
alumni perform in the Olympics. But playing
soccer in professional European leagues is all
but a mystery to most of us.
I talked to Sevi over lunch last week, and

he agreed to let me tell his story. Seyi wants
to forego his final season on the Farm be
cause, as he puts it, staying would be too safe
and comfortable. Though he has learned a
lot during his time at Stanford - and he is
grateful to his coaches and teammates - he
realizes that he will need to take some risks if
he hopes to make it big someday. The older
players who mentored him in his early years
at Stanford - storied names like Dunivant,
Levesque, Maliza and Wilson - have all
moved on to the next stage of their lives, and
it is time for him to do the same, Seyi said.
When it comes to professional soccer,
youth is a valuable asset. Most big-time soc
cer stars in Europe (and increasingly in
America) get their professional starts in their
teens. In Spain, all professional teams have
youth development academies, and kids as
young as 12 live and study at the soccer
schools.
Like many competitive businesses, profes
sional soccer is tough for beginners. Without
