# Soto Tape Chronicles
## Seyi shows going pro ain't easy 
### 
The Stanford soccer media guide de
scribes senior Seyi Abolaji as a versa
tile midfielder and defender who has
steadily improved over the course of his col
lege career. Those of us who know him out
side of soccer would describe him as kind and
sincere. We would talk about how he re
members people's names, even after he has
met them only once. We would talk about
how he asks about our families and always
has a smile on his face.
After a successful season. Seyi. who still
has a year of eligibility left because of a med
ical redshirt, decided to leave the Farm and
try his luck at professional soccer in Europe.
It is an unusual career path fora Stanford stu
dent. (Ryan Nelson, class of 2001, is playing
for Blackburn in the English Premier
League.) We hear about the occasional bas
ketball or football player who makes the leap
to the next level, and we have seen numerous
alumni perform in the Olympics. But playing
soccer in professional European leagues is all
but a mystery to most of us.
I talked to Sevi over lunch last week, and

he agreed to let me tell his story. Seyi wants
to forego his final season on the Farm be
cause, as he puts it, staying would be too safe
and comfortable. Though he has learned a
lot during his time at Stanford - and he is
grateful to his coaches and teammates - he
realizes that he will need to take some risks if
he hopes to make it big someday. The older
players who mentored him in his early years
at Stanford - storied names like Dunivant,
Levesque, Maliza and Wilson - have all
moved on to the next stage of their lives, and
it is time for him to do the same, Seyi said.
When it comes to professional soccer,
youth is a valuable asset. Most big-time soc
cer stars in Europe (and increasingly in
America) get their professional starts in their
teens. In Spain, all professional teams have
youth development academies, and kids as
young as 12 live and study at the soccer
schools.
Like many competitive businesses, profes
sional soccer is tough for beginners. Without

an inside c< >nnection or a good word of
recommendation it is nearly impossi
ble to get a good tryout opportunity.
Seyi was lucky - he had a connection.
While recovering from surgery on
a partially detached patella tendon in
2(H)3, Seyi befriended a Turkish man
who agreed to watch him play this sea
son. This pseudo-agent knew a statisti
cian in Turkey who worked in the
same broadcast booth as a former soc
cer legend, Okan. Known as "the
Devil" for his cleverness and grit,
Okan is the Michael Jordan equiva
lent in his country. In the late 1980s
and early 1990s he was the national
soccer star, and he is still revered
today.

Okan agreed to do the statistician a
favor and arranged a tryout for Seyi
with lstambulspor, one of the last
place teams in the top division of
Turkish soccer. Though Seyi was hop
ing fora better club, he saw this as a
first step and a way to get his foot in the
door.
Seyi packed up at the end of fall
quarter and left for Turkey for his trial.
As his first evaluation, Okan invit
ed Seyi to play a six-on-six scrimmage
with several other retired soccer
greats. None of us who have seen Seyi
on the field would be surprised to
learn that he impressed them all with
his skills. He played so well that Okan
decided to set him up with Malatias
por. a much better club, whose coach is
a former teammate of Okan's.
This all happened over the course
of one week during winter break. In a
few days, Seyi went from being an un
known Nigerian kid with a dream to a

star soccer recruit because Okan's
good recommendation carries a lot of
weight in Turkish soccer circles.
It seemed like everything was
going to work out. Seyi's big tryout
was scheduled to begin Jan. 5. He can
celled his ticket home and made plans
to move to Antalya, site of the midsea
son camp.
All the excitement pushed the ad
vice of his mentor, former Stanford
soccer standout Corey Woolfolk. to
the back of his mind. Woolfolk, who
has seen highs and lows over the
course of his professional career in
America, told Seyi: take everything
one step at a time. Your luck can
change on a dime, so you must focus
only on what you can control.
The day before he was to leave for
his tryout, Seyi called Okan to finalize
last-minute details but no one an
swered. Okan did not pick up his
phone the entire day. That night, Seyi

learned thai Okan had skipped town
because of gambling debts and was un
traceable.
Without Okan, Seyi was back to
where he started: unknown and with
no prospects fora tryout with a club.
Malatiaspor would not let him play if
Okan wasn't there to talk the coach
into it. With this sudden reversal of
fortune, Seyi returned home to the
Farm.
After months of training and trav
eling, Seyi is back on campus. He will
complete his degree in history this
quarter. He considers himself wiser
because of his experience, and he
hasn't given up on his dream of some
day playing in Europe.

Next week, in part 2of Seyi's story, Jorili
will talk to Seyi about his still-intact pro
fessional aspirations, and the next steps
on his journey. E-mail Jordi at
