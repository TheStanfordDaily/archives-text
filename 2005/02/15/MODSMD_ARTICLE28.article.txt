# Cardinal nab four wins
## 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Long. That's the best way to describe the past
weekend for the No. 3 Stanford women's water
polo team. Starting with Friday afternoon's 9-5
victory against Hawaii and concluding Sunday
with a dominant 11-4 win over Indiana, the
weekend's five games held a little bit of every
thing for the Cardinal as they began their 2005
NCAA title hunt.
Stanford began its season against No. 7
Hawaii, a team marked by its height and physi
cal style of play according to Stanford head
coach John Tanner. Anticipating the challenge.
Stanford countered with speed, finding open
ings on the offensive end and swarming to the
ball on defense.
After losing the opening sprint and giving up
a quick breakaway goal to Hawaii, the Cardinal
responded with goals from junior captain Scotti
Shafer on two consecutive drives. The first was a
tip-in off a pass from junior driver Laurel Cham
pion and the second an outside lob shot to the far
corner of the net.
But after Hawaii managed to put away a
blocked shot rebound to tie the score at 2-2 on its
next possession, the Cardinal took control of the
game on the strength of five unanswered goals,
two coming from sophomore Katie Hansen,
who finished the day with a hat trick. Hawaii
never recovered, and the Cardinal cruised to
record their first win of the season by a comfort
able 9-5 margin.
Saturday and Sunday, the Cardinal hosted
the eight-team Stanford Invitational. In the two
bracket format, each team was slated to play
three games against the other members of its

bracket and then a placement game Sunday af
ternoon.
The Cardinal's first game came against No. 11
San Jose State. In another dominating offensive
/one effort. Hansen notched four goals. In addi
tion, the efforts of junior two-meter Nancy El-
Sakkary (2 goals), sophomore two-meter
Christina Hewko (2 goals) and Shafer (1 goal)
provided the Cardinal more than enough of
fense to handle the Spartans in a 9-3 final.
But the marquee matchup of the weekend for
the Cardinal came in their Saturday evening
showdown against No. 1 UCLA. Facing a Bruins
rosier featuring four members of this past sum
mer's U.S. Olympic team, the Cardinal came out
confident and prepared to challenge.
In the first quarter the two teams played each
other equally, with the only score coming on a
UCLA tip-in during a six-on-five advantage. But
a blind backhand from El-Sakkary on the Cardi
nal's first drive of the second period tied the
match.
UCLA retook the lead, converting on its
counterattack with a shot past diving junior
goalie Meridith McColl, and pushed its lead to 3-
1 on a breakaway goal from junior driver Thalia
Munro.
But Stanford managed to swing the momen
tum and battled back to a tie. A lob shot from se
nior captain Kelty Luber made it 3-2, and then
McColl came up with a big save to start a Stan
ford counterattack. McColl sent an outlet to
Shafer, who managed to draw an ejection to give
the Cardinal a six-on-five advantage. On the en
suing play, Shafer and Luber swung the ball
across to an open Hansen, who buried the shot

to bring the Cardinal back even.
UCLA responded late in the pe
riod on another Munro goal with
1:48 left in the period to reclaim the
momentum and went into the half
up 4-3. After two more goals within
the first three minutes of the third
period, the Bruins seemed to be
rolling to an insurmountable lead.
But the Cardinal rallied once
again, this time facing a 6-3 deficit.
With less than three minutes left in
the third, it was Champion working
a pass inside to a cutting Shafer dur
ing a six-on-five advantage to bring
Stanford within two. The third peri
od wound down with the Cardinal
playing smothering defense on the
UCLA ball-handlers, an effort high
lighted by sophomore Alison Gre
gorka, who helped force turnovers
on UCLA's last two possessions of
the period.
The Cardinal's next scoring op
portunity came in dramatic fashion.
After Shafer and Champion forced a
turnover, the Cardinal transitioned
to work the ball inside to senior cap

tain Hannah Luber, who battled to
free herself from her defender long
enough to send a sweep-shot over
the head of the UCLA goalie to re
duce the deficit to 6-5.
The score stood unchanged as the
clock ticked down to two minutes. In
a fierce effort to tie the game, the
Cardinal offense dominated the
final 120 seconds, sending four shots
off the crossbar of the UCLA net,
the final one coming from the hand
of Hansen with two seconds remain
ing.
Despite the final outcome, the
Cardinal's effort, especially in the
final minutes, showed that they are
capable of competing with the very
best and are legitimate NCAA title
contenders.
Sunday's games seemed almost
anti-climactic, as McColl held a
shutout into the final three minutes
of the Cardinal's 11-1 win over UC-
Davis, and the Cardinal defense
emerged to dominate No. 10 Indiana
in the tournament's third-place
game Sunday afternoon. Forcing
four shot-clock violations over the
course of the game, and holding the
Hoosiers shotless in the third period,
the Cardinal capped off their im
pressive tournament effort with an
11-4 win.

Stanford within two. The third peri
od wound down with the Cardinal
playing smothering defense on the
UCLA ball-handlers, an effort high
lighted by sophomore Alison Gre
gorka, who helped force turnovers
on UCLA's last two possessions of
the period.
The Cardinal's next scoring op
portunity came in dramatic fashion.
After Shafer and Champion forced a
turnover, the Cardinal transitioned
to work the ball inside to senior cap

tain Hannah Luber, who battled to
free herself from her defender long
enough to send a sweep-shot over
the head of the UCLA goalie to re
duce the deficit to 6-5.
The score stood unchanged as the
clock ticked down to two minutes. In
a fierce effort to tie the game, the
Cardinal offense dominated the
final 120 seconds, sending four shots
off the crossbar of the UCLA net,
the final one coming from the hand
of Hansen with two seconds remain
ing.
Despite the final outcome, the
Cardinal's effort, especially in the
final minutes, showed that they are
capable of competing with the very
best and are legitimate NCAA title
contenders.
Sunday's games seemed almost
anti-climactic, as McColl held a
shutout into the final three minutes
of the Cardinal's 11-1 win over UC-
Davis, and the Cardinal defense
emerged to dominate No. 10 Indiana
in the tournament's third-place
game Sunday afternoon. Forcing
four shot-clock violations over the
course of the game, and holding the
Hoosiers shotless in the third period,
the Cardinal capped off their im
pressive tournament effort with an
11-4 win.
Long. That's the best way to describe the past
weekend for the No. 3 Stanford women's water
polo team. Starting with Friday afternoon's 9-5
victory against Hawaii and concluding Sunday
with a dominant 11-4 win over Indiana, the
weekend's five games held a little bit of every
thing for the Cardinal as they began their 2005
NCAA title hunt.
Stanford began its season against No. 7
Hawaii, a team marked by its height and physi
cal style of play according to Stanford head
coach John Tanner. Anticipating the challenge.
Stanford countered with speed, finding open
ings on the offensive end and swarming to the
ball on defense.
After losing the opening sprint and giving up
a quick breakaway goal to Hawaii, the Cardinal
responded with goals from junior captain Scotti
Shafer on two consecutive drives. The first was a
tip-in off a pass from junior driver Laurel Cham
pion and the second an outside lob shot to the far
corner of the net.
But after Hawaii managed to put away a
blocked shot rebound to tie the score at 2-2 on its
next possession, the Cardinal took control of the
game on the strength of five unanswered goals,
two coming from sophomore Katie Hansen,
who finished the day with a hat trick. Hawaii
never recovered, and the Cardinal cruised to
record their first win of the season by a comfort
able 9-5 margin.
Saturday and Sunday, the Cardinal hosted
the eight-team Stanford Invitational. In the two
bracket format, each team was slated to play
three games against the other members of its

bracket and then a placement game Sunday af
ternoon.
The Cardinal's first game came against No. 11
San Jose State. In another dominating offensive
/one effort. Hansen notched four goals. In addi
tion, the efforts of junior two-meter Nancy El-
Sakkary (2 goals), sophomore two-meter
Christina Hewko (2 goals) and Shafer (1 goal)
provided the Cardinal more than enough of
fense to handle the Spartans in a 9-3 final.
But the marquee matchup of the weekend for
the Cardinal came in their Saturday evening
showdown against No. 1 UCLA. Facing a Bruins
rosier featuring four members of this past sum
mer's U.S. Olympic team, the Cardinal came out
confident and prepared to challenge.
In the first quarter the two teams played each
other equally, with the only score coming on a
UCLA tip-in during a six-on-five advantage. But
a blind backhand from El-Sakkary on the Cardi
nal's first drive of the second period tied the
match.
UCLA retook the lead, converting on its
counterattack with a shot past diving junior
goalie Meridith McColl, and pushed its lead to 3-
1 on a breakaway goal from junior driver Thalia
Munro.
But Stanford managed to swing the momen
tum and battled back to a tie. A lob shot from se
nior captain Kelty Luber made it 3-2, and then
McColl came up with a big save to start a Stan
ford counterattack. McColl sent an outlet to
Shafer, who managed to draw an ejection to give
the Cardinal a six-on-five advantage. On the en
suing play, Shafer and Luber swung the ball
across to an open Hansen, who buried the shot

to bring the Cardinal back even.
UCLA responded late in the pe
riod on another Munro goal with
1:48 left in the period to reclaim the
momentum and went into the half
up 4-3. After two more goals within
the first three minutes of the third
period, the Bruins seemed to be
rolling to an insurmountable lead.
But the Cardinal rallied once
again, this time facing a 6-3 deficit.
With less than three minutes left in
the third, it was Champion working
