## Track teams shine at Tyson 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's not very often that three track and field school
records are broken in one weekend, but that is exactly
what happened last Friday and Saturday. It was a fast
weekend for the Stanford men's and women's track
teams, as three of the Cardinal's top sprinters set new
high marks in the school record books.
All three records were set at the Tyson Invitation
al in Fayetteville, Ark. The race brought together
some of the best track and field teams in the nation, in
cluding Texas Tech, Florida State and Kansas. Stan
ford fared well, producing top-ranked relay teams and
a few top individual finishes.
Twenty-three athletes traveled to Arkansas to
compete in Friday's elite races and Saturday's colle
giate invitational. The Tyson meet proved to be com
petitive enough to bring out the fastest times from the
top Cardinal athletes.
"The competition in Arkansas was fierce and in
tense," head men's coach Robert Weir said. "It was an
ideal meet for the runners competing. Everybody
knew the competition would be stiff."
There was no doubt the competition was tough.
Freshman sprinter Wopamo Osaisai set a new school
record in the 60-meter dash with his time of 6.87, but
failed to make the finals. He finished 19th in the pre
lims.
"It was very impressive," Weir said. "He set the
freshman as well as the school record."
Sophomore Janice Davis was unstoppable, leading
the 4x400 meter relay to a second-place finish on Fri
day with a time of 3:34.92 and breaking her own school
record in the 200-meter dash with a sixth-place finish
of 23.70.
"Every time she runs she expects to be better,"
head women's coach Edrick Floreal said. "She just
needs the races with the right competitors."
The 4x400 meter relay was made up of senior
Christine Moschella, Davis and sophomores Ashley
Freeman and Ashley Purnell.
Freeman followed Friday's relay with a fifth-place
finish in the championship heat of the 800-meter run
on Saturday with a time of 2:11.25.
Senior Nick Sebes set a new school record in the
400-meter dash, finishing fifth in the championship
heat. He slashed the old record of 47.06 set by Rene
Rodriguez in 1994.
Other notable finishes at the Arkansas meet in
cluded redshirt freshman Michael Garcia's sixth-place
finish in the championship heat of the 800-meter run.
He finished in 1:51.62. Redshirt freshman Russel
Brown ran the 800 unseeded and finished fourth with
a time of 1:50.83. Senior Evan Fox also ran unseeded,
finishing eighth in 1:51.70.
Garcia and Brown, sprint sensation Sebes and
sophomore Joaquin Chapa all combined to use their
individual talents to bring the Cardinal's distance
medley relay (DMR) team to a third-place finish of
