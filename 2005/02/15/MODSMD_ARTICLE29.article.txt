# Stanford sets three records
## Track teams shine at Tyson 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's not very often that three track and field school
records are broken in one weekend, but that is exactly
what happened last Friday and Saturday. It was a fast
weekend for the Stanford men's and women's track
teams, as three of the Cardinal's top sprinters set new
high marks in the school record books.
All three records were set at the Tyson Invitation
al in Fayetteville, Ark. The race brought together
some of the best track and field teams in the nation, in
cluding Texas Tech, Florida State and Kansas. Stan
ford fared well, producing top-ranked relay teams and
a few top individual finishes.
Twenty-three athletes traveled to Arkansas to
compete in Friday's elite races and Saturday's colle
giate invitational. The Tyson meet proved to be com
petitive enough to bring out the fastest times from the
top Cardinal athletes.
"The competition in Arkansas was fierce and in
tense," head men's coach Robert Weir said. "It was an
ideal meet for the runners competing. Everybody
knew the competition would be stiff."
There was no doubt the competition was tough.
Freshman sprinter Wopamo Osaisai set a new school
record in the 60-meter dash with his time of 6.87, but
failed to make the finals. He finished 19th in the pre
lims.
"It was very impressive," Weir said. "He set the
freshman as well as the school record."
Sophomore Janice Davis was unstoppable, leading
the 4x400 meter relay to a second-place finish on Fri
day with a time of 3:34.92 and breaking her own school
record in the 200-meter dash with a sixth-place finish
of 23.70.
"Every time she runs she expects to be better,"
head women's coach Edrick Floreal said. "She just
needs the races with the right competitors."
The 4x400 meter relay was made up of senior
Christine Moschella, Davis and sophomores Ashley
Freeman and Ashley Purnell.
Freeman followed Friday's relay with a fifth-place
finish in the championship heat of the 800-meter run
on Saturday with a time of 2:11.25.
Senior Nick Sebes set a new school record in the
400-meter dash, finishing fifth in the championship
heat. He slashed the old record of 47.06 set by Rene
Rodriguez in 1994.
Other notable finishes at the Arkansas meet in
cluded redshirt freshman Michael Garcia's sixth-place
finish in the championship heat of the 800-meter run.
He finished in 1:51.62. Redshirt freshman Russel
Brown ran the 800 unseeded and finished fourth with
a time of 1:50.83. Senior Evan Fox also ran unseeded,
finishing eighth in 1:51.70.
Garcia and Brown, sprint sensation Sebes and
sophomore Joaquin Chapa all combined to use their
individual talents to bring the Cardinal's distance
medley relay (DMR) team to a third-place finish of
9:33.49. Brown opened the race with
the 1200-meter run, Sebes followed
with the 400, Garcia was next with
the 800 and Chapa finished with the
mile. The team's DMR time was .49
seconds from the NCAA automatic
qualifying time.
"Our DMR is one of the top
ranked teams in the country," Weir
said. "We are one of the contenders
for the NCAA."
The team's success this weekend
was good news for Stanford, as the
main goal of these meets is to quali
fy athletes for the NCAA's in
March.
"We finally have some people
now who are getting qualified for
nationals," Weir said. "It's a big
turnaround because we don't have
the strength or depth of previous
years."
Both redshirt freshman Neftalem
Araia and junior Ryan Hall compet
ed in the 3000-meter run. Araia ran
on Friday, among both professional
and collegiate runners, while Hall
ran Saturday, finishing fourth in the
championship division with a
NCAA provisional mark of 8:02.63.
Araia did not fare as well as expect
ed, finishing 11th with a time of
8:14.08.
"The race did not go as well for
him," Weir said. "We have to reeval
uate him and get him ready for the
next meet. I have no idea why he was
so flat in the race. Everything points
to him running a lot faster than he
did."
At the Husky Classic in Seattle,
junior Alicia Craig started off her
season with instant success. She won
the 5000-meter run with a NCAA
automatic qualifying time of
15:54.72. Junior Anita Siraki was not
far behind, finishing sixth with an
NCAA automatic mark of 16:07.18.
The 5000-meter run is a 25-lap race
on an indoor track.
Junior Sarah Hopping earned a
personal best in the weight throw,
placing sixth with a distance of 56'8
1/2", and freshman Garrett Heath
ran a personal best in the mile with a
time of 4:08.17.
The indoor track season is in
full swing as both teams head to
Seattle next weekend for the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Championships.
