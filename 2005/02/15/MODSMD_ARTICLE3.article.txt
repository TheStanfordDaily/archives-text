# Law School antidiscrimination policy upheld by court
## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
The Solomon Amendment, which
cuts off federal funding to schools that
prohibit military recruiters on campus,
was recently struck down by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Third District.
The decision could quell the dispute be
tween the Stanford Law School's antidis

crimination policy and the military.
The Law School is part of the Forum
for Academic and Institutional Rights,,
or FAIR, which brought the case against
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.
FAIR is a coalition of law schools, stu
dents and professors from across the
country that supports educational institu
tions in opposing discrimination.
The case. FAIR v. Rumsfeld, is now

pending consideration from the U.S.
Supreme Court, said Law Prof. George
Fisher, a member of the FAIR board.
In the meantime, the Third Circuit
Court stayed enforcement of its own rul
ing so that the amendment will remain a
law until the Supreme Court agrees to
hear the case or affirms the lower court's
judgment.
"For our purposes at the Law School,

that means that we're back to where we
were before the court ruled," Fisher said.
According to its Web site, Stanford
Law School has a longstanding policy
against discrimination on the grounds of
race, ethnicity, national origin, gender,
religion, age. disability, veteran status or
sexual orientation.
