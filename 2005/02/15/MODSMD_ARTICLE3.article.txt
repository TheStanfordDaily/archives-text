# Law School antidiscrimination policy upheld by court
## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
The Solomon Amendment, which
cuts off federal funding to schools that
prohibit military recruiters on campus,
was recently struck down by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Third District.
The decision could quell the dispute be
tween the Stanford Law School's antidis

crimination policy and the military.
The Law School is part of the Forum
for Academic and Institutional Rights,,
or FAIR, which brought the case against
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.
FAIR is a coalition of law schools, stu
dents and professors from across the
country that supports educational institu
tions in opposing discrimination.
The case. FAIR v. Rumsfeld, is now

pending consideration from the U.S.
Supreme Court, said Law Prof. George
Fisher, a member of the FAIR board.
In the meantime, the Third Circuit
Court stayed enforcement of its own rul
ing so that the amendment will remain a
law until the Supreme Court agrees to
hear the case or affirms the lower court's
judgment.
"For our purposes at the Law School,

that means that we're back to where we
were before the court ruled," Fisher said.
According to its Web site, Stanford
Law School has a longstanding policy
against discrimination on the grounds of
race, ethnicity, national origin, gender,
religion, age. disability, veteran status or
sexual orientation.
This policy came into conflict
with federal law when the Solomon
Amendment was enacted in IW4.
The military maintains a "Don't
Ask. Don't Tell" policy regarding
gay and lesbian service members, a
policy that most law schools view as
discriminatory. Most of these law
schools forbid employers they view
as discriminatory from recruiting on
campus and have been torn between
violating their own nondiscrimina
tion policies and losing critical feder
al funding.
Even so. the argument heard be
fore the Court of Appeals focused
more on First Amendment free
doms of speech and expression than
discrimination.
"The courts must decide whether
nondiscrimination policy is consid

ered speech," said Dan Shih. presi
dent of OUTLAW, a gay and les
bian organization at the Law School.
"The idea is that if the government
can impose First Amendment free
speech restrictions, then that is too
much power.
According It) Fisher, the Law
School has successfully avoided the
issue by allowing student interest to
dictate which recruiters are invited
to campus.
"If a sufficient interest was shown
by our students in seeing military re
cruiters then the school would have
to address the question whether to
invite recruiters to campus," Fisher
said. "The rule at the Law School
without regard to Solomon is that
because of space constraints we can
only invite employers with sufficient
student interest.
According to Fisher, the Law
School has not invited military re
cruiters to campus simply because
students have not expressed enough
interest.

However, the policy has not pre
vented the military from recruiting
Stanford students.
"The policy hasn't been a burden
on people who are interested in the
military." Shih said. "It's really easy
for anyone who wants to be recruit
ed."
Other law schools have banned
military recruiters from campuses
entirely. Last week, Yale joined
Harvard in denying recruiting re
sources to military officials until dis
crimination against gay and lesbians
ends.
Stanford Law School, on the
other hand, has repeatedly stated
that it will not ban the military from
recruiting students.
?No step [the Law School) will
take will forbid military recruitment
of our students,? according to a
statement on the school?s Web site.

been and remain free to interview
with the JAG Corps both on and off
the Stanford campus."

School has not invited military re
cruiters to campus simply because
students have not expressed enough
interest.

However, the policy has not pre
vented the military from recruiting
Stanford students.
"The policy hasn't been a burden
on people who are interested in the
military." Shih said. "It's really easy
for anyone who wants to be recruit
ed."
Other law schools have banned
military recruiters from campuses
entirely. Last week, Yale joined
Harvard in denying recruiting re
sources to military officials until dis
crimination against gay and lesbians
ends.
Stanford Law School, on the
other hand, has repeatedly stated
that it will not ban the military from
recruiting students.
?No step [the Law School) will
take will forbid military recruitment
of our students,? according to a
statement on the school?s Web site.
'.'Stanford Law School students have
been and remain free to interview
with the JAG Corps both on and off
the Stanford campus."
