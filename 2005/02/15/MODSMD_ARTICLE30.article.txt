# No. 1 too much for men's gym

### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When facing the top-ranked
team in the nation, falling behind
early can crush any chance at vic
tory. The No.B Stanford men's
gymnastics team (3-3) found that
out the hard way last weekend as
it faced No.l Ohio State and N0.7
Cal at the Nakamori Invitational
in Berkeley.
The Cardinal struggled at the
outset, failing to perform a single
strong routine on either the high
bars or the pommel horse. De
spite the slow start, Stanford was
able to make it close, but couldn't
overcome the early deficit. The
Buckeyes won the event with a
score of 215.350. Second place
went to the Bears with a score of
214.450 and the Cardinal came in
at a close third with 213.950.
Despite the Cardinal's disap

pointing performance on the early
events, they bounced back in the
last two disciplines, competing at
ninety percent.
"I was impressed with them
coming back after floundering for
four events, and that they realized
they needed to step it up and do
what they are capable of doing,"
head coach Thom Glielmi said.
It was a good sign for the Car
dinal that the men could come
back after faltering early, but the
men know that they need to per
form better from the start to the
finish.
Despite stepping up the inten
sity in practice last week, Glielmi
said that the team was not mental
ly prepared. He emphasized the
difficult transition many are going
through from competing as indi
viduals to competing as a team.
Freshman David Sender did not
have his best overall meet this week
end, but true to his reputation, he
performed well on the rings, grab
bing third place with a 9.350.
"Well, you win some, and you
lose some," Sender said.
Sophomore Alex Schorsch also
did well on the rings, grabbing sec
ond place with a 9.450.
Freshman Jason Shen had a solid
weekend, earning the only first
place spot the Cardinal won at the
competition. He tied for first on the
vault with a 9.5(X).
Freshman Sho Nakamori per
formed well at a competition named
after his late father. On Nakamori's
strongest event, the floor exercise,
he did well, although he missed on
his dismount. Despite that, he won
second place with a 9.150. Nakamori
also had a strong routine on the par
allel bars, placing second with a
9.300.
"Sho had a great routine, but he
just needs to learn to put an excla
mation point on it by doing a sharp
dismount," Glielmi said.
Senior captain Kelly Lang was
injured this week and could not
compete at the event. His absence
hurt the team on the parallel bars,
the high bars and the floor exercise,
his three strongest disciplines. I low
ever, Lang's leadership was the as
pect that the team needed - and
missed - the most.
"There is a lot to be said for an
athlete who can step up to stop the
bleeding and that athlete has yet to
emerge on this team," Glielmi said.
The Cardinal are a very young
team, with seven athletes who are
new to the team format. Glielmi
said that he is looking for any of the
Cardinal to step up.
"The athlete that emerges as the
team leader is usually throwing up
five or six events," Glielmi said.
Glielmi said he looks hopefully
toward the next few weeks and
chalks up this weekend's meet to a
learning experience that any young
team needs to have before they can
emerge as a force to be reckoned
with.
The Cardinal look to bounce
back this weekend as they travel to
Colorado to face off against No. 19
Air Force.
