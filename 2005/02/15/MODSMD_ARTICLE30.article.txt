# No. 1 too much for men's gym

When facing the top-ranked
team in the nation, falling behind
early can crush any chance at vic
tory. The No.B Stanford men's
gymnastics team (3-3) found that
out the hard way last weekend as
it faced No.l Ohio State and N0.7
Cal at the Nakamori Invitational
in Berkeley.
The Cardinal struggled at the
outset, failing to perform a single
strong routine on either the high
bars or the pommel horse. De
spite the slow start, Stanford was
able to make it close, but couldn't
overcome the early deficit. The
Buckeyes won the event with a
score of 215.350. Second place
went to the Bears with a score of
214.450 and the Cardinal came in
at a close third with 213.950.
Despite the Cardinal's disap

pointing performance on the early
events, they bounced back in the
last two disciplines, competing at
ninety percent.
"I was impressed with them
coming back after floundering for
four events, and that they realized
they needed to step it up and do
what they are capable of doing,"
head coach Thom Glielmi said.
It was a good sign for the Car
dinal that the men could come
back after faltering early, but the
men know that they need to per
form better from the start to the
finish.
Despite stepping up the inten
sity in practice last week, Glielmi
said that the team was not mental
ly prepared. He emphasized the
difficult transition many are going
through from competing as indi
viduals to competing as a team.
