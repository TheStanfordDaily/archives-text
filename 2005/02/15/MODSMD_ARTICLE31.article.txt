# Volleyball downs Pacific 3-0 at home
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Disappointed Pacific setter Mitch
Hazelett lay facedown on the floor of
Burnham Pavilion after the men's volley
ball match last Friday evening. The No. 11
Cardinal took down the No. 9 Tigers in
just three games - marking Stanford's first
victory over a higher-ranked team this
season.
The Cardinal also ended a four-game
losing streak and dropped Pacific (9-6.3-4
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) to a

losing record in MPSF play.
However, it was no runaway victory for
Stanford in game one, as the Cardinal (4
8, 3-6 MPSF) fell behind by as much as
four points halfway through the game.
After using its second timeout of the
match at 22-25. Stanford rallied to tie the
game, 26-26.
A Pacific timeout did not detract from
the Cardinal's momentum. The Tigers
could not score another point as Stanford
junior Ben Reddy nailed two service aces.
Senior Craig Buell then secured the win,
30-26, with a solo block and an unassisted

"We were fortunate to win game one,"
head coach Don Shaw said. "We didn't
play very well, and we squandered a lot of
point-scoring opportunities. We really
dug ourselves into a hole. Fortunately,
Ben got hot; they couldn't handle his
serve, and we were able to make up a lot
of points in a hurry. That's something we
don't do very often, but when we do, it's a
pleasant surprise."
The Cardinal squad could not suppress
its amused laughter when the announcer
reported that its hitting percentage in

game one had been a -.059. Pacific's hit
ting percentage, .049, had been only
marginally better.
"Pulling out game one was key," Shaw
said. "In these matches, especially with
teams that are kind of evenly matched as
far as ranking and all that, that first game
can be critical. Winning the first game
helped us gain momentum."
After the first point of game two, Stan
ford never let Pacific take the advantage.
Instead, the Cardinal were the team with
the four-point lead, and that gap
only increased as the game wore
on. Another service ace late in the
game, this time by junior William
Clayton, boosted Stanford to an
easy 30-21 win.
"We definitely picked up the
quality of our play in games two
and three," Shaw said.
Game three started out much
like the second, as the Cardinal
jumped out to a comfortable ad
vantage. However, midway
through the game. Pacific tried to
emulate what Stanford had done
in the first set and swing the mo
mentum. They almost succeeded,
as Pacific tied it up at 23-23 and
stayed with the Cardinal through
25-25.
"Pacific played better in game
three, 1 thought," Shaw said. "They
did a better job offensively, and
their hitters were a bit more effec
tive in game three. I felt like we got
careless serving and gave up
chances to score points. It seemed
like whenever we served the ball in,
we were effective. They weren't
passing all that well. We just need
ed to get the ball in play."
Stanford found a way to do that,
pulling away once again. Buell, re
peating his game-winning perfor
mance of the first game, had anoth
er solo block and a kill to close out
the match with a 30-27 victory.
"In game three, there was a lot
of confidence on the court," Buell
said. "We knew we could beat
them. That kind of showed in our
play. We pulled it out great."
Buell ended the match with a
.611 hitting percentage, having
notched a team-leading 13 kills.
"Pacific really missed their
libero," said Shaw, referring to se
nior Mike Gawlik, who became the
Tigers' all-time dig leader last April
in a five-game defeat of the Cardi
nal. Gawlik watched the match Fri
day on crutches.
"He's a great player, and they
are trying to find a working combi
nation without him," Shaw said.
"They still haven't found it yet. So
we were fortunate in that regard."
The victory was a big one for the
Cardinal, as their recent string of

losses was starting to wear on the
team.
"We're back on the winning
track," Shaw said. "We lost four in
a row there, and a couple of them
were tight games that we actually
could have won, so we were a little

frustrated. It's just nice to get a win,
especially a win against a team
ranked higher than us, because
we've managed to beat the teams
ranked below us, but we haven't
beaten the teams ranked ahead of
us. So, that's one, and hopefully we

can get another one next week,
maybe two."
Stanford hits the road this week
for its next two matches. The Car
dinal will play No. 1 UCLA this
Thursday, then challenge No. 10
UC-lrvine on Saturday.

Senior setter Kevin Hansen sets up junior Chris Ahlfeldt fora kill. No. 11 Stanford defeated a higher ranked team
for the first time this season, upsetting No. 9 Pacific at Burnham Pavilion on Friday night.
Disappointed Pacific setter Mitch
Hazelett lay facedown on the floor of
Burnham Pavilion after the men's volley
ball match last Friday evening. The No. 11
Cardinal took down the No. 9 Tigers in
just three games - marking Stanford's first
victory over a higher-ranked team this
season.
The Cardinal also ended a four-game
losing streak and dropped Pacific (9-6.3-4
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) to a

losing record in MPSF play.
However, it was no runaway victory for
Stanford in game one, as the Cardinal (4
8, 3-6 MPSF) fell behind by as much as
four points halfway through the game.
After using its second timeout of the
match at 22-25. Stanford rallied to tie the
game, 26-26.
A Pacific timeout did not detract from
the Cardinal's momentum. The Tigers
could not score another point as Stanford
junior Ben Reddy nailed two service aces.
Senior Craig Buell then secured the win,
30-26, with a solo block and an unassisted

"We were fortunate to win game one,"
head coach Don Shaw said. "We didn't
play very well, and we squandered a lot of
point-scoring opportunities. We really
dug ourselves into a hole. Fortunately,
Ben got hot; they couldn't handle his
serve, and we were able to make up a lot
of points in a hurry. That's something we
don't do very often, but when we do, it's a
pleasant surprise."
The Cardinal squad could not suppress
its amused laughter when the announcer
reported that its hitting percentage in

game one had been a -.059. Pacific's hit
ting percentage, .049, had been only
marginally better.
"Pulling out game one was key," Shaw
said. "In these matches, especially with
teams that are kind of evenly matched as
far as ranking and all that, that first game
can be critical. Winning the first game
helped us gain momentum."
After the first point of game two, Stan
ford never let Pacific take the advantage.
Instead, the Cardinal were the team with
the four-point lead, and that gap
only increased as the game wore
on. Another service ace late in the
game, this time by junior William
Clayton, boosted Stanford to an
easy 30-21 win.
"We definitely picked up the
quality of our play in games two
and three," Shaw said.
Game three started out much
like the second, as the Cardinal
jumped out to a comfortable ad
vantage. However, midway
through the game. Pacific tried to
emulate what Stanford had done
in the first set and swing the mo
mentum. They almost succeeded,
as Pacific tied it up at 23-23 and
stayed with the Cardinal through
25-25.
"Pacific played better in game
three, 1 thought," Shaw said. "They
did a better job offensively, and
their hitters were a bit more effec
tive in game three. I felt like we got
careless serving and gave up
chances to score points. It seemed
like whenever we served the ball in,
we were effective. They weren't
passing all that well. We just need
ed to get the ball in play."
Stanford found a way to do that,
pulling away once again. Buell, re
peating his game-winning perfor
mance of the first game, had anoth
er solo block and a kill to close out
the match with a 30-27 victory.
"In game three, there was a lot
of confidence on the court," Buell
said. "We knew we could beat
them. That kind of showed in our
play. We pulled it out great."
Buell ended the match with a
.611 hitting percentage, having
notched a team-leading 13 kills.
"Pacific really missed their
libero," said Shaw, referring to se
nior Mike Gawlik, who became the
Tigers' all-time dig leader last April
in a five-game defeat of the Cardi
nal. Gawlik watched the match Fri
day on crutches.
"He's a great player, and they
are trying to find a working combi
nation without him," Shaw said.
"They still haven't found it yet. So
we were fortunate in that regard."
The victory was a big one for the
Cardinal, as their recent string of

losses was starting to wear on the
team.
"We're back on the winning
track," Shaw said. "We lost four in
a row there, and a couple of them
were tight games that we actually
could have won, so we were a little

frustrated. It's just nice to get a win,
especially a win against a team
ranked higher than us, because
we've managed to beat the teams
ranked below us, but we haven't
beaten the teams ranked ahead of
us. So, that's one, and hopefully we

can get another one next week,
maybe two."
Stanford hits the road this week
for its next two matches. The Car
dinal will play No. 1 UCLA this
Thursday, then challenge No. 10
UC-lrvine on Saturday.
