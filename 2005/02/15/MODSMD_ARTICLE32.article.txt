# Women can't tame Wildcats
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 18 Arizona women's gymnastics team re
mained undefeated at home when the Wildcats (10-4,3-
1 Pacific-10 Conference ) took down No. 26 Stanford (1-
3, 1-2 Pac-10) last Friday, 195.225 to 193.725.
Stanford held its own on balance beam and uneven
bars, hitting all six routines, but lost the meet on what
had looked to be one of its best events of the season:
floor exercise.
Floor exercise was Stanford's highest scoring event in
two out of its three meets leading up to last weekend.
The team had scored a 48.70, a 48.10 and a 48.95 in those
three meets on floor. This weekend, however, the team
tumbled to only 47.925 points compared to Arizona's
49.075.
The reason? Like many a Stanford student, the
women were trying too hard.
"They had so much energy and enthusiasm on floor
that they didn't know what to do with it," head coach
Kristen Smyth said. "The energy will be an asset rather
than a problem in the future if we can learn how to chan
nel it."
If not channeled appropriately, extra energy on floor
means extra power on tumbling passes, which results in
extra rotations. Extra rotations, in turn, result in large
deductions on falls (0.50 points) and steps on landings
(0.10 points or more). The extra energy can also decrease
focus on the details in dance moves, opening the door for
even more deductions on bobbles on turns and jumps.
Freshman Alex Pintchouk started the team on floor
exercise by over-rotating her first tumbling pass. She fell
and took a step out of bounds, leaving her with a 9.175.
Junior captain Natalie Foley and freshman Lauren El
more also over-rotated their tumbling passes and bob
bled on a couple dance moves to score 9.5 and a 9.55, re
spectively.
The team's highest score on floor, good for only sixth
place in the meet, was a 9.725 by freshman Stephanie
Gentry. That score could have been topped by freshman
Tabitha Yim, who debuted on floor after recuperating
from an Achilles tendon injury. Yim, however, watered
down her last tumbling pass, which lowered the start
value of her routine from a 10.0 to a 9.8, leaving her with
a 9.575 rather than what could have been a 9.775.
The low scores on floor exercise, coupled with a lack
of depth on vault, cost Stanford the meet. The meet con
tinues the Cardinal's winless streak on the road and
breaks the Cardinal's streak of improving their team
score at each successive meet.
Although the team score dropped nearly a full point
from the previous weekend's score of 194.675, Smyth
said that her gymnasts showed considerable improve
ment which the score does not reflect.
"Our goal was to hit six for six routines on bars and
beam and we did that," Smyth said. "The team actually
set a season-high mark on the uneven bars, edging out
the Wildcats on that event with a 48.925. Yim won bars
with a 9.925, which ranks her fourth in the nation on bars,
one spot behind injured teammate Liz Tricase.

well, tying Arizona with a 48.775.
Yim led the way, earning a 9.875 to
win the event. Foley was right be
hind with a 9.85. The two gymnasts
are now tied at a fifth place nation
al ranking on beam.
"We also made great improve
ments on the team's chemistry -
there was a lot of great energy and
excitement about the meet," Smyth
said. "We gelled as a whole team
rather than having certain individu
als put in great performances here
and there."
The team's chemistry was given
a boost by the return of their co
captain, eight-time All-American
Foley, to the All-Around. After

battling an ankle injury in the first
month of the season. Foley posted
a 38.875 to finish third in the All-
Around behind Arizona seniors
Monica Bisordi and Jamie Schnell.
"Having Nat back in the Ail-
Around helped so much," Smyth
said. "She is such a tremendous
leader in her gymnastics and on the
floor of the meet."
Foley and her teammates return
home on Friday to face defending na
tional champion No. 9 UCLA. The
meet promises to showcase some of
the highest caliber gymnastics in the
nation, including several Olympians
on UCLA's team, as well as Yim in
her first competition at home.
The last time the Bruins came to
the Farm, the meet ended in a tie.
If Stanford has a shot at victory, it
will need to be near perfect.

(0.10 points or more). The extra energy can also decrease
focus on the details in dance moves, opening the door for
even more deductions on bobbles on turns and jumps.
Freshman Alex Pintchouk started the team on floor
exercise by over-rotating her first tumbling pass. She fell
and took a step out of bounds, leaving her with a 9.175.
Junior captain Natalie Foley and freshman Lauren El
more also over-rotated their tumbling passes and bob
bled on a couple dance moves to score 9.5 and a 9.55, re
spectively.
The team's highest score on floor, good for only sixth
place in the meet, was a 9.725 by freshman Stephanie
Gentry. That score could have been topped by freshman
Tabitha Yim, who debuted on floor after recuperating
from an Achilles tendon injury. Yim, however, watered
down her last tumbling pass, which lowered the start
value of her routine from a 10.0 to a 9.8, leaving her with
a 9.575 rather than what could have been a 9.775.
The low scores on floor exercise, coupled with a lack
of depth on vault, cost Stanford the meet. The meet con
tinues the Cardinal's winless streak on the road and
breaks the Cardinal's streak of improving their team
score at each successive meet.
Although the team score dropped nearly a full point
from the previous weekend's score of 194.675, Smyth
said that her gymnasts showed considerable improve
ment which the score does not reflect.
"Our goal was to hit six for six routines on bars and
beam and we did that," Smyth said. "The team actually
set a season-high mark on the uneven bars, edging out
the Wildcats on that event with a 48.925. Yim won bars
with a 9.925, which ranks her fourth in the nation on bars,
one spot behind injured teammate Liz Tricase.

well, tying Arizona with a 48.775.
Yim led the way, earning a 9.875 to
win the event. Foley was right be
hind with a 9.85. The two gymnasts
are now tied at a fifth place nation
al ranking on beam.
"We also made great improve
ments on the team's chemistry -
there was a lot of great energy and
excitement about the meet," Smyth
said. "We gelled as a whole team
rather than having certain individu
als put in great performances here
and there."
The team's chemistry was given
a boost by the return of their co
captain, eight-time All-American
Foley, to the All-Around. After

battling an ankle injury in the first
month of the season. Foley posted
a 38.875 to finish third in the All-
Around behind Arizona seniors
Monica Bisordi and Jamie Schnell.
"Having Nat back in the Ail-
Around helped so much," Smyth
said. "She is such a tremendous
leader in her gymnastics and on the
floor of the meet."
Foley and her teammates return
home on Friday to face defending na
tional champion No. 9 UCLA. The
meet promises to showcase some of
the highest caliber gymnastics in the
nation, including several Olympians
on UCLA's team, as well as Yim in
her first competition at home.
The last time the Bruins came to
the Farm, the meet ended in a tie.
If Stanford has a shot at victory, it
will need to be near perfect.
The No. 18 Arizona women's gymnastics team re
mained undefeated at home when the Wildcats (10-4,3-
1 Pacific-10 Conference ) took down No. 26 Stanford (1-
3, 1-2 Pac-10) last Friday, 195.225 to 193.725.
Stanford held its own on balance beam and uneven
bars, hitting all six routines, but lost the meet on what
had looked to be one of its best events of the season:
floor exercise.
Floor exercise was Stanford's highest scoring event in
two out of its three meets leading up to last weekend.
The team had scored a 48.70, a 48.10 and a 48.95 in those
three meets on floor. This weekend, however, the team
tumbled to only 47.925 points compared to Arizona's
49.075.
The reason? Like many a Stanford student, the
women were trying too hard.
"They had so much energy and enthusiasm on floor
that they didn't know what to do with it," head coach
Kristen Smyth said. "The energy will be an asset rather
than a problem in the future if we can learn how to chan
nel it."
If not channeled appropriately, extra energy on floor
means extra power on tumbling passes, which results in
extra rotations. Extra rotations, in turn, result in large
deductions on falls (0.50 points) and steps on landings
(0.10 points or more). The extra energy can also decrease
focus on the details in dance moves, opening the door for
even more deductions on bobbles on turns and jumps.
