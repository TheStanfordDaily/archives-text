challenge and I am looking forward to working
with Coach Harris, his staff and the Stanford
football program," Hayes said in a release.
"We are very fortunate to have someone of
Tom's caliber join our staff," Harris said. "He
brings with him the experience and knowledge of
the 3-4 defense, which we are committed to here
at Stanford. He is an outstanding coach and teach
er and will be an invaluable addition to our staff."
During his nine years at UCLA, from 1980 to
1988, the Bruins played in eight bowl games and

won the Rose Bowl three times.
Hayes was a three-year starter as a defensive
back at lowa and served as the Hawkeyes' sec
ondary coach from 1977-78.
