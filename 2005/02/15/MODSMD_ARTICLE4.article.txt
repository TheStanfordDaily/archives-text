# Iraq experts discuss recent elections
## 
### SARAH LUSTBADER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Contrasting sharply with the optimism ex
pressed by New York Times columnist Thomas
Friedman at an on-campus talk last week. Se
nior Hoover Fellow Larry Diamond and Wash
ington Post foreign correspondent Rajiv Chan
drasekaran presented a more cynical analysis of
the recent Iraqi elections at a talk held yester
day. The two focused on the impact the elections
will have on the political future of the country
and relations among the country's religious and
ethnic groups.
Diamond, a professor of political science and
sociology, served as an adviser early last year to
the American-led Coalition Provisional Au
thority, which led Iraq before the interim Iraqi
government took control. Chandrasekaran,
Class of 1994, has served as the Washington Post

bureau chief at several locations including
Baghdad, where he has been stationed for the
past two years. He is now on leave to write a
book about the American occupation in Iraq.
Chandrasekaran began by praising the
turnout of 8.5 million voters — 58 percent of all
eligible — which he called "very impressive,"
given the violent atmosphere. He noted that the
prevalent images of proud voters seen in the
American media mostly came from Baghdad
and the Kurdish north, where voter participa
tion was high, not from Sunni-controlled territo
ry where turnout was as low as two percent in
some places and those who voted consisted
chiefly of Shiite and Kurdish minorities.
Diamond expressed grave concern over the
results of the election, which he called "an iden
tity referendum."
"There's a reason why scholars counsel

against early elections," he said, adding
that before an increase in the number
of political actors and the emergence of
political and party structures, an elec
tion is likely to be only an "ethnic cen
sus."
"I actually think the election has
given us the best statistical insight in
the last 20 years of precisely what the
population balance is there," he added.
Both speakers emphasized that
American failure to support moderate
political groups resulted in a severe

blow to secular and liberal forces.
"Liberals were just crushed," Dia
mond said. "It was a failure of the
United States to support [moderate
candidates] ;ind a lack of campaign
funds. 1 had advocated for it. but
there was no provision for media
time, no ability to move around and
campaign."
Chandrasekaran noted that while
the Shiite political leaders tolerated
Sunni and Kurd voices, secular, mod
crate Shiites were the first to be si
lenced.
According to C "handrasekaran, Shi
ites want what they believe is rightfully
theirs — a majority rule. 'ITiey want
the new constitution to be guided by
Islam and Shariah law and oppose fed

eralism on a philosophical level.
Sunnis, on the other hand, support
U.S. withdrawal, the release of Iraqi
prisoners and a halt to de-Baathifica
tion.
Kurds want autonomy and there
fore support federalism and oppose
Shariah law. Their most controversial
demand is to gain control of the oil-rich
city of Kirkuk.
Because the United Iraqi Alliance
the Islamist Shiite group that now
occupies about half of the seats in the
National Assembly — will now have
to negotiate to form a two-thirds coali
tion, Diamond said.
Chandrasekaran agreed that this
period will be crucial.
"We'll be entering a period of

smoky back-room politics," Chan
drasekaran said. "We're going to see a
lot of compromise."
Both speakers mentioned the
strong possibility of a Kurd-Shiite al
liance, which Chandrasekaran suggest
ed might make Shiites more amenable
to federalism, as well as limiting the
role of Islam in the constitution.
They also addressed the issue of
Sunni inclusion in the new govern
ment. Diamond estimated that one
half of the Sunnis who did not vote de
cided to stay home due to violent in
timidation. and the rest sympathized
with the boycott — a decision that
many have begun to regret.
Chandrasekaran took a more opti
mistic view, predicting that Sunni in

elusion will lend a greater sense of le
gitimacy to the government.
" I I'Sunnis are given a position, ordi
nary Sunnis might feel represented,"
he said. "If people start to cooperate
with the government and rat out their
neighbors [we can fight insurgencies]
through a flow of intelligence."
Even though Diamond argued that
the election left Iraq more polarized
and divided along ethnic lines, he did
not eliminate the possibility that wise
governance could lead to compromise
and a share of power.
"I don't know how it's going to
come out," Diamond said. "There is a
wide range of options from political
compromise to a protracted stalemate
— and on the other end, civil war."

Islam and Shariah law and oppose fed

eralism on a philosophical level.
Sunnis, on the other hand, support
U.S. withdrawal, the release of Iraqi
prisoners and a halt to de-Baathifica
tion.
Kurds want autonomy and there
fore support federalism and oppose
Shariah law. Their most controversial
demand is to gain control of the oil-rich
city of Kirkuk.
Because the United Iraqi Alliance
the Islamist Shiite group that now
occupies about half of the seats in the
National Assembly — will now have
to negotiate to form a two-thirds coali
tion, Diamond said.
Chandrasekaran agreed that this
period will be crucial.
"We'll be entering a period of

smoky back-room politics," Chan
drasekaran said. "We're going to see a
lot of compromise."
Both speakers mentioned the
strong possibility of a Kurd-Shiite al
liance, which Chandrasekaran suggest
ed might make Shiites more amenable
to federalism, as well as limiting the
role of Islam in the constitution.
They also addressed the issue of
Sunni inclusion in the new govern
ment. Diamond estimated that one
half of the Sunnis who did not vote de
cided to stay home due to violent in
timidation. and the rest sympathized
with the boycott — a decision that
many have begun to regret.
Chandrasekaran took a more opti
mistic view, predicting that Sunni in

elusion will lend a greater sense of le
gitimacy to the government.
" I I'Sunnis are given a position, ordi
nary Sunnis might feel represented,"
he said. "If people start to cooperate
with the government and rat out their
neighbors [we can fight insurgencies]
through a flow of intelligence."
Even though Diamond argued that
the election left Iraq more polarized
and divided along ethnic lines, he did
not eliminate the possibility that wise
governance could lead to compromise
and a share of power.
"I don't know how it's going to
come out," Diamond said. "There is a
wide range of options from political
compromise to a protracted stalemate
— and on the other end, civil war."
Contrasting sharply with the optimism ex
pressed by New York Times columnist Thomas
Friedman at an on-campus talk last week. Se
nior Hoover Fellow Larry Diamond and Wash
ington Post foreign correspondent Rajiv Chan
drasekaran presented a more cynical analysis of
the recent Iraqi elections at a talk held yester
day. The two focused on the impact the elections
will have on the political future of the country
and relations among the country's religious and
ethnic groups.
Diamond, a professor of political science and
sociology, served as an adviser early last year to
the American-led Coalition Provisional Au
thority, which led Iraq before the interim Iraqi
government took control. Chandrasekaran,
Class of 1994, has served as the Washington Post

bureau chief at several locations including
Baghdad, where he has been stationed for the
past two years. He is now on leave to write a
book about the American occupation in Iraq.
Chandrasekaran began by praising the
turnout of 8.5 million voters — 58 percent of all
eligible — which he called "very impressive,"
given the violent atmosphere. He noted that the
prevalent images of proud voters seen in the
American media mostly came from Baghdad
and the Kurdish north, where voter participa
tion was high, not from Sunni-controlled territo
ry where turnout was as low as two percent in
some places and those who voted consisted
chiefly of Shiite and Kurdish minorities.
Diamond expressed grave concern over the
results of the election, which he called "an iden
tity referendum."
"There's a reason why scholars counsel

that before an increase in the number
of political actors and the emergence of
political and party structures, an elec
tion is likely to be only an "ethnic cen
sus."
"I actually think the election has
given us the best statistical insight in
the last 20 years of precisely what the
population balance is there," he added.
Both speakers emphasized that
American failure to support moderate
political groups resulted in a severe

blow to secular and liberal forces.
"Liberals were just crushed," Dia
mond said. "It was a failure of the
United States to support [moderate
candidates] ;ind a lack of campaign
funds. 1 had advocated for it. but
there was no provision for media
time, no ability to move around and
campaign."
Chandrasekaran noted that while
the Shiite political leaders tolerated
Sunni and Kurd voices, secular, mod
crate Shiites were the first to be si
lenced.
