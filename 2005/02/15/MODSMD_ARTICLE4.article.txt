Diamond, a professor of political science and
sociology, served as an adviser early last year to
the American-led Coalition Provisional Au

government took control. Chandrasekaran,
Class of 1994, has served as the Washington Post

bureau chief at several locations including
Baghdad, where he has been stationed for the
past two years. He is now on leave to write a
book about the American occupation in Iraq.
Chandrasekaran began by praising the
turnout of 8.5 million voters — 58 percent of all
eligible — which he called "very impressive,"
given the violent atmosphere. He noted that the
prevalent images of proud voters seen in the
American media mostly came from Baghdad
and the Kurdish north, where voter participa

some places and those who voted consisted
chiefly of Shiite and Kurdish minorities.
Diamond expressed grave concern over the
results of the election, which he called "an iden
tity referendum."
