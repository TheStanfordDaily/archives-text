# Univ. cuts medical and retirement benefits for future faculty and staff
## 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
To cut costs. University President John
Hennessy and University Provost John
Etchemendy announced last week that
Stanford is decreasing its medical and re
tirement plan benefits for future faculty and
staff. This decision came after eight months
of discussion with employees and adminis
trators about how to control benefit costs,
which have risen by almost 50 percent in the
last five years.
Currently. Stanford provides the equiva
lent of the least expensive Medicare supple
ment plan for all eligible employees. When
the changes are implemented in 2006, Stan
ford's contributions will be tied to the
length of time an employee has worked at
the University.
Current retirees and those eligible to re
tire within five years will not be affected by
any of these changes. Employees eligible
for retirement benefits must have worked at
Stanford for at least 10 years. They can start
receiving their benefits when the sum of
their age and the number of years of service
at Stanford totals 75.
According to Randy Livingston, Stan
ford vice president of business affairs, the
plan was developed by various people in
human resources, the University Cabinet,
the Faculty Senate and the Board of
Trustees. In addition, Etchemendy hosted
two town hall meetings where anyone inter
ested could review and comment on the

proposed plan.
Economics Prof. John Pencavel said he
supports the University's decision.
"From what I know, unless changes are
made now. the costs of future retiree med
ical benefits could present the University
with a heavy financial burden that would
have to be addressed by cutting expendi
tures substantially elsewhere," Pencavel
said. "It is prudent for the Provost to antici
pate these problems and to deal with them
in this reasonable way."
Donald Barr. associate professor of So
ciology. said he also sees these changes as
necessary in light of rising health care costs.
"Stanford as an employer is not immune
to the broad changes in health care." Barr
said. "It is getting more expensive and the
costs of providing health care are becoming
more than employers can bear. Reducing
benefits is all an employer can do while the
government seeks out more systematic re
forms."
Since 1999, the University's contribu
tions to retiree medical benefits have risen
by 438 percent, according to the Stanford
News Service.
Livingston cited a national survey on re
tiree medical benefits conducted by Mer
cer, a private consulting firm. According to
the 2(K)3 data, 53 percent of universities in
the United States offer their Medicare-eli
gible retirees a supplemental health plan.
Only 25 percent of California employers

have any sort of health plan for their
Medicare-eligible workers.
" This means that about half the
universities offer no retiree plan at
all," Livingston said. "Of the re
mainder, several have taken steps in
the past few years to reduce the ben
efits, including Princeton, Duke and
Emory. Many companies that previ
ously offered retiree health plans
are eliminating them or reducing the
benefits."
On top of the medical plan
changes, Ltchemendy also an
nounced changes to the University's
contributions to employee retire
ment accounts.
Currently, employees who have
worked at the University for over
one year are eligible to have five per
cent of their salary set aside in their
retirement accounts. Under the new
plan, contributions will start at one
percent and increase by one percent
annually until the sixth year, when
contributions top out at five percent.
These changes will only affect em
ployees hired after .lan. 1,2(X)6.
