• Report dripping sinks or other water leaks to your
Housing Supervisor or by calling 3-2281 for

while washing dishes, produce, or defrosting food.
• Run only full loads of laundry or dishes.
• Minimize use of garbage disposals.
• Keep a bottle of drinking water in the refrigerator
rather than running tap water to cool it for drinking.
