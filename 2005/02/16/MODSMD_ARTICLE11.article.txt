On Feb. 16,1954, The Daily run an
article about the threat posed by the
increasing strength of Korean Com
munist forces. Below is an excerpt:
"U.S. Eighth Army Commander
Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor said today
that the communists still have an esti
mated one million-man army in
North Korea and are doing every
thing they can to strengthen their po
sition.
"Taylor told a press conference
the Chinese and North Korean Reds
'are training very actively and the
communist threat still is with us.'
"The Reds have made 'no essen
tial change' in their ground strength
since the truce was signed nearly
seven months ago.
" The Eighth Army, Taylor said, is
being used as a 'laboratory' to test
new weapons, but he did not elabo
rate.
"The general said he was not con
sulted on the South Korean offer to
send an infantry division to aid the
French in their light against the reds
in Indochina.
On Feb. 16, 1931, The Daily cov

ered a story about the differences be
tween the Chinese and American edu
cation systems. Below is an excerpt:
" 'Death is a common penalty
professors pay for unguarded speech
in Chinese schools, for China must
still use militaristic measures in her
education,' stated Henry L.in, a trans
fer student from Wuchang Universi
ty to Stanford, in a discussion of Chi
nese schools Thursday. Lin was the
honored guest at the regular fellow
ship tea sponsored by local members
of the National Students' Federation
of America.
"Although China is in a revolu
tionary state, there is no military
training in her colleges, Lin said. The
students themselves take no active
part on either side of the conflicting
forces. " ' Their work is the study of
the political situation and the spread
ing of propaganda,' Lin said.
"University education in the Ori
ent is much like the American sys
tem, according to Lin, for China in
her changing has copied our ways."
