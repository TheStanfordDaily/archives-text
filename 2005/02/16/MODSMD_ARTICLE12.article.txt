# ASSU Senate approves ballot requests
## 
### DAVID KUO 
Special fees dominated the
discussion at last night's ASSU
Undergraduate Senate meeting.
Most of the meeting was spent
approving various student groups
for placement on the special-fees
ballot for the spring election.
The Senate approved 16 stu
dent groups in total, the majority of

which were returning groups such
as the Stanford Solar Car Project
and Barrio Assistance. Senate
members met with these groups
this past Saturday in committee
meetings before presenting the
budgets of the student groups to
the full Senate during last night.
The budgets that were voted on
and approved last night will be put
on the spring ballot for the student

body to vote on.
General fees, which fund most
student groups, were also dis
cussed at the Senate meeting.
Due to the increasing number of
student groups applying for gen
eral fees, the Senate plans to re
evaluate its funding policies and
to increase the amount of money
available for allocation through
general fees.
