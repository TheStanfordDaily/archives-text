# But that's not the point...
## To Be or Not to Be an Indie Snob? 
### 
I'll admit it: I'm a wannabe indie
snob. 1 go to independent movie
houses wearing outfits that include
careful mismatching of clothes
bought from Savers.
1 mock people who listen to any
music more recognizable than the

Shins (unless it's
done ironically). I
often say, "I liked it
before it was cool
to like it!" 1 went
on a long rant when
Conor Oberst, who
fronts the ultimate
indie angst band
Bright Eyes, was
featured in Ellegirl

magazine as its "New Crush."
But wait — Ellegirl featured
Conor Oberst? There is clearly a
societal phenomenon at work here:
The "scene kid" and the "indie
snob" are becoming brands now.
Ellegirl is only capitalizing on the
trend that is the anti-trend.
The movie "Garden State" is the ul
timate example of indie-gone-main
stream. Roughly 12 people watched
"Scrubs" two years ago. Now, every
one 1 know watches it. This is all be
cause of "Garden State."
When "Garden State" played at
Flicks, it practically filled
MemAud, which, for Flicks, is say
ing something. And I'm almost pos
itive that a significant portion of
the people who love "Garden
State" do so thinking that it is a
unique movie that speaks to them
personally. 1 thought it was the first
time 1 saw it, too and then when ev
eryone else liked it I started to
worry. (See what I mean by snob?)
The deal with "Garden State" is
that it's not that innovative or cre
ative. It's a good movie, but it's not
totally new.
Last week, I was watching a
rerun of "Dawson's Creek," and I
realized that in the series finale,
Pacey says something to Joey that is
almost exactly what Andrew says to
his dad at the end of "Garden
State." With the same inflection.
"Dawson's Creek" is schmaltzy
crap — and we all know it. "Garden
State" is just another nostalgia flick
for those in their mid-20s, and it
tugs on all our heartstrings because
it's about our generation and all
that jazz. It's good, but it's too ac
cessible to be indie.
It's hard to let go of my desire to
hate "Garden State" just because
everyone else understands it as well
as 1 do. Some of you might recog
nize this feeling - those who lis
tened to Death Cab way back when
"The Photo Album" came out in
stead of only after Seth mentioned
it on "The OC" (another show that
is capitalizing on indie snobbish
ness becoming cool).
But I've come to the point where
I love "Garden State" anyway, kind
of the like the way 1 still love
"You've Got Mail," and I guess I'm
writing this column just to make
sure you know I'm trying not to be
a snob anymore.
The ironic part for me about all
of this is that everyone who has a
tinge of snobbishness about them
has been complaining about the
ending of "Garden State" since it
came out. They argue that it was
stupid to end the movie as though
kissing in the baggage claim solves
everything.
I've always loved this ending,
precisely because it throws out any
•pretense of being anything other
than a romantic comedy with cool
cinematography. And also because
I think that is what our generation
is about.
Because we all struggle with try
ing to make our impact in one way
or another — we knew that already.
The point of "Garden State,"and
the point of this article, is that in the
end you just have to go with your
gut.
I love the Olsen twins. I love
quite a few bands that you probably
haven't heard of unless you're an
Intermission writer. I also really
like country music (at least when
I've had a few drinks). I own the
"Lizzie Maguire" movie. I just ad
mitted that. And that's fine with
me.

itive that a significant portion of
the people who love "Garden
State" do so thinking that it is a
unique movie that speaks to them
personally. 1 thought it was the first
time 1 saw it, too and then when ev
eryone else liked it I started to
worry. (See what I mean by snob?)
The deal with "Garden State" is
that it's not that innovative or cre
ative. It's a good movie, but it's not
totally new.
Last week, I was watching a
rerun of "Dawson's Creek," and I
realized that in the series finale,
Pacey says something to Joey that is
almost exactly what Andrew says to
his dad at the end of "Garden
State." With the same inflection.
"Dawson's Creek" is schmaltzy
crap — and we all know it. "Garden
State" is just another nostalgia flick
for those in their mid-20s, and it
tugs on all our heartstrings because
it's about our generation and all
that jazz. It's good, but it's too ac
cessible to be indie.
It's hard to let go of my desire to
hate "Garden State" just because
everyone else understands it as well
as 1 do. Some of you might recog
nize this feeling - those who lis
tened to Death Cab way back when
"The Photo Album" came out in
stead of only after Seth mentioned
it on "The OC" (another show that
is capitalizing on indie snobbish
ness becoming cool).
But I've come to the point where
I love "Garden State" anyway, kind
of the like the way 1 still love
"You've Got Mail," and I guess I'm
writing this column just to make
sure you know I'm trying not to be
a snob anymore.
The ironic part for me about all
of this is that everyone who has a
tinge of snobbishness about them
has been complaining about the
ending of "Garden State" since it
came out. They argue that it was
stupid to end the movie as though
kissing in the baggage claim solves
everything.
I've always loved this ending,
precisely because it throws out any
•pretense of being anything other
than a romantic comedy with cool
cinematography. And also because
I think that is what our generation
is about.
Because we all struggle with try
ing to make our impact in one way
or another — we knew that already.
The point of "Garden State,"and
the point of this article, is that in the
end you just have to go with your
gut.
I love the Olsen twins. I love
quite a few bands that you probably
haven't heard of unless you're an
Intermission writer. I also really
like country music (at least when
I've had a few drinks). I own the
"Lizzie Maguire" movie. I just ad
mitted that. And that's fine with
me.

I'll admit it: I'm a wannabe indie
snob. 1 go to independent movie
houses wearing outfits that include
careful mismatching of clothes
bought from Savers.
1 mock people who listen to any
music more recognizable than the

Shins (unless it's
done ironically). I
often say, "I liked it
before it was cool
to like it!" 1 went
on a long rant when
Conor Oberst, who
fronts the ultimate
indie angst band
Bright Eyes, was
featured in Ellegirl

magazine as its "New Crush."
But wait — Ellegirl featured
Conor Oberst? There is clearly a
societal phenomenon at work here:
The "scene kid" and the "indie
snob" are becoming brands now.
Ellegirl is only capitalizing on the
trend that is the anti-trend.
The movie "Garden State" is the ul
timate example of indie-gone-main
stream. Roughly 12 people watched
"Scrubs" two years ago. Now, every
one 1 know watches it. This is all be
cause of "Garden State."
When "Garden State" played at
Flicks, it practically filled
MemAud, which, for Flicks, is say
ing something. And I'm almost pos
itive that a significant portion of
the people who love "Garden
State" do so thinking that it is a
unique movie that speaks to them
personally. 1 thought it was the first
time 1 saw it, too and then when ev
eryone else liked it I started to
