112 J / lash of mauve. Splash of puce. Swirl of gown. Students letting loose.
On the merry-go-round of the Viennese Ball 2005. It began with an
artfully choreographed opening ceremony and continued with per-
I formances featuring Stanford talent jiving to the Cabaret Charleston
and waltzing to the Esmeralda Polka.
The dance and music were complemented by a blush of romance - in the
lobby were an ice sculpture, in which the Ball's logo was engraved, and rose bou
tonnieres. It all made fora picture-perfect evening for the hundreds who attended
the 28th annual Viennese Ball at the Hyatt Regency in Burlingame last Friday.
Students left their "Stanford" hooded sweatshirts and warm ups in their closets -
the night called strictly for ballroom formal wear.
The ladies modeling a spectrum of shades in strapless, vintage and contemporary
dresses were deserving of a Hollywood red carpet. Many female Cardinals pulled
their hair back in intricate updos, while others just let their hair hang loose.
The men, decked out in tuxedos, suits and even top hats, maintained the dignity
expected of gentlemen. Those few rejecting the penguin shuffle sported Tommy Ba
hamas and Mickey Mouse gloves.
"I love seeing everyone dressed up, and I love watching the performances," said
Swingtime dance performer Tiffany Cartwright, a sophmore. "There are so many tal
ented dancers at Stanford."
According to senior Howard Shen, the chair of the Ball's steering committee, tra
ditionally men wear tuxes and women wear gowns.
"There is, of course, a lot of variation, especially among women," Shen said.
"Most men wear either tuxedos or formal suits. For women, I've seen attire from
homemade Victorian gowns and prom dresses to ballroom dance competition dress
es, evening wear and cocktail dresses."
"1 enjoy the Ball for many different reasons, including a great love of the waltz,"
he continued. "I always wear a tuxedo to the Ball. Students so rarely get a chance to
dress up so extensively that I always take the chance to do so during the Ball."
The novelty of the evening and its attire was on the mind of many attendees.
Junior Louise Nutt, co-chair of Austria Week, said, "The Viennese Ball lets you
be ridiculous because a girl can go beyond formalwear into princess land."
"I enjoy the Ball because I get to dance, of course," Nutt continued. "When I
chose my dress, I made sure it was one in which I would be able to dance in — that
would not actually touch the floor. I think flimsy straps or strapless dresses are kind
of a bad idea. It sucks to have to keep pulling up your straps when you're twirling."
One first-year graduate student in computational mathematics, Wael Salloum,
decided that after four years of tuxedo wearing, he would go tropical and sport a blue
inohawk to match the colorful dress of his date, Kathleen Torres, Class of 2003. Tor
res noted that the focus of the evening for her was mingling and dancing.
"My favorite parts of the Viennese Ball are the performances and waltzing with
my date," Salloum said.
Dancing included performances by the opening committee. Cardinal Ballet, the
Academy of Danse Libre, Knotts Dance Company, Stanford Ballroom Dance Team,
Swingtime, Decadance and Los Salseros de Stanford from 8:30 p.m. until 2 a.m.
Attendees had the option to test out the dance floor in either a waltz room or
swing room.
"Richard Powers [who teaches all the social dance classes on campus] has done a
wonderful job building a vibrant dance community," said Irene Yeh, a second-year
Master's student in East Asian Studies. She had taken Social Dance 1; her partner,
senior Jonathan Cheek, had over five Stanford dance classes to his commendation.
Stephanie Chiang, class of 2003, with her dance partner Kari Doyle, Class of 2004,
proved that two girls who know how to lead could get into the "swing of things" after
they were declared one of winning teams for the swing competition.
"It is important that Stanford continues [the Viennese Ball] tradition," Chiang
said. "We have a flourishing dance program and I look forward to dancing in the
swing competition next year."
Junior Gisselle Gaitan, a performer for Los Salseros, said she appreciated the ex
posure of salsa at the event.
"I am pleased that salsa is incorporated into the Viennese Ball performances, but
would love to see more of it included in the dance list," she said.
Veteran Ball goers noted that the event was not as crowded as previous ones, but
that the skill level was much higher than in the past, leaving many eager to attend
Stanford's most elegant tradition next year.
Thomas Lee, a third-year Ph.D. candidate in electrical engineer-

ing, attended his ninth Ball last Friday

"I've always enjoyed vintage clothing and cus-

Toms," he said. "The Viennese Ball is the one time
of year when I get to experience it."
