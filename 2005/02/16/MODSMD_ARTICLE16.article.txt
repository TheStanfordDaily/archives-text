## Editorial Hennessy takes positive step on labor 
### 
As an academic leader, Stanford should try to take a
treat its workers fairly and with the respect that they de
serve. University President John Hennessy's statement
last week — supporting workers' rights and changing
Stanford's policy accordingly — did just that. However,
none of this would have been possible without relentless
pressure from students in the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition, or SLAC.
Following a weeklong hunger strike by six students
in the spring of 2(X)3, Hennessy formed an advisory
committee on workplace policies. 'Hie committee met
throughout the 2003-2004 academic year and submitted
its conclusions to Hennessy in a 111-page report. Last
week, Hennessy at least partially accepted all of the
committee's recommendations.
Every worker on this campus is an important part of
the community, regardless of whether or not they are
contracted. Without the hard work of office staff and
janitors, this campus would not be able to function. Pre
viously, the lowest-paid University-employed workers
received the "living wage" of $11.35 without health ben
efits, whereas workers supplied through third-party
contractors were paid substantially less — in some cases
for comparable work.
Hennessy's change should address this disparity.
Just as important, the forthcoming changes will provide
temporary and contracted laborers with days off and ac
cess to English classes. Providing these services to more
workers will assist in improving the work environment
and providing opportunities for career advancement.
'Hie committee also recommended the creation of a
community worker advocate position, which would
focus solely on reaching out to laborers and advocating
for temporary and casual workers. Hennessy decided
instead to create a pilot project within the ombudsper
son's office. Unfortunately, adding more to the om
budsperson's plate rather than creating a new position
is not sufficient. The worker advocate position may
have been the most important recommendation in
terms of long-term workers' rights and Hennessy needs
to reconsider his initial position.
According to SLAC, while Hennessy's statement is
symbolically powerful, the wage changes lack tangible
impact. Hennessy's new policies will only affect those
contracted laborers who work more than 20 hours per

week, and unfortunately. University administrators say
they do not know how many workers will be impacted
because the number of hours-per-week are not tracked.
To solve this issue, one of the adopted recommendations
is to begin tracking the number of hours worked by con
tracted laborers. In addition, there are concerns that
Stanford will allow contractors to limit the number of
employees working over 20 hours per week — which
would be counterproductive and harmful to workers.
Until those numbers become available, SLAC's
criticisms are salient. The new policies are not impor
tant unless it affects a significant percentage of con
tracted workers. The University ought to work with the
labor contractors to identify the number of workers im
pacted by the changes and truly quantify the size of the
change. Once those numbers are released, the Univer
sity can ensure that it has a worker policy it can be
proud of.
'ITiat said, SLAC's retorts to Hennessy's response
have been characteristically extreme. Comments such as
calling the president's response "a shadow of his com
mittee's recommendations and a mere ghost of the Code
of Conduct" do not serve to create meaningful dialogue.
While SLAC has significantly helped workers on this
campus through advocacy initiatives and creating open
dialogues, it has burnt too many bridges in the process.
Following every SLAC victory, instead of applauding
those it has worked with. SEAC' issues new demands and
criticizes the steps already being taken.
There is a time and a place for making new demands,
and pushing for improvements is necessary to better this
University. However, SLAC's consistently adversarial
position hurts its political capital with administration
and students alike. As an organization. SLAC ought to
set a yearly agenda and avoid deviating from it. In addi
tion, while SLAC's radicalism is often necessary, it
ought to be wary that too much radicalism will also turn
many of its supporters away.
Together, the University and SLAC ought to
work to better understand (he tangible impacts of the
labor changes and cooperatively find the best solu
tions for University workers. The necessary task of
identifying the laborers affected by the policy change
provides a meaningful opportunity to begin such co
operation.
