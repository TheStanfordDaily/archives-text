# Techie Repairs the World
## Belief in God â€” so wrong, yet so right 
### 
As an atheist, I can state with
only slight sarcasm that I am totally
in favor of a state-imposed religion,
one founded on Christian evangeli
cal doctrines and taught to children
at a very young age in public school,
from pre-school onward. Such an in
stitution, despite a small erosion of
individual freedom of thought,
would greatly benefit society at
large.

Personally, I know that there is no God, and religion
is a lie. 1 have sound reasons for my belief. But they prob
ably wouldn't convince you. Because my atheism is root
ed in upbringing, not reason. My grandfather was a com
munist who raised his child to think of religion as the opi
ate of the masses, so faith was never discussed in my
home.
Other people, like my roommate, are very religious.
He was indoctrinated at a very early age to believe in
some sort of God that would cast him into hell unless he
accepted Jesus as his savior and acted in a commensurate
manner.
Now whose parents have done their children a greater
service? I can never believe in God. No matter how
much 1 try, the concept always seems ridiculous. I believe
that life is meaningless and my consciousness will end
with my death. I'm pretty amoral, only obeying the law
because of the punishments that might accrue. I can def
initely be a bastard and feel little remorse when acting in
such a manner.
My roommate, on the other hand, believes strongly in
obeying the law. He believes his life has a purpose. He is
a friendly guy. He enjoys community service. He reads
the Bible regularly and experiences a constant connec
tion with something transcendent and beautiful. His

faith may be a ridiculous delusion, but it has a much more
positive impact on his life than my atheism has on mine.
Even though, ironically enough, there really is no God,
and I'm right.
There's only one way to make sure that the people
around us are more like my roommate than me, and
that's to get them when they're young. We already in
doctrinate our kids in school. We teach them to love their
country, hug trees, share, work hard and be honest. We
brainwash them when they're young because we know
that if they followed their self-interest (as human beings
tend to do), these virtues would never develop.
But the rampant secularism in our schools hinders
this effort, because we can offer them no good reason
why they should do these things except that it is "wrong"
or "people will like them better." Instead, we hope that
someone else will teach them that there is a wrathful
God. But somehow it doesn't work. Too many people
grow up with no belief or a belief in a God who will al
ways forgive them and let them get away with anything.
If people really believed they would be thrown into a
lake of fire for lying, drug use or adultery, they certainly
wouldn't do these things. The benefit of temporary grat
ification would be outweighed by the cost of eternal
damnation.
Furthermore, a strong belief in God would have a
salutary effect on the youths themselves. If they felt that
mortal life was just the first step into an eternal afterlife
of intimate union with God. there probably wouldn't be
widespread despair and hopelessness. They'd no longer
have to pursue happiness. It would be handed to them.
And all it would cost is a little liberty.
