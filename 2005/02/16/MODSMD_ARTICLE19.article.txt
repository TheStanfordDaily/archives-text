Mock weddings in White Plaza
were counterproductive
As a strong supporter both of mar
riage rights for same-sex couples and of
the sacred institution of marriage, I was
dismayed to read about the mock wed
dings performed in White Plaza on Mon
day ("Mock weddings highlight demand
for legalization of gav marriage," Feb.
15).
Admittedly, I did not attend the rally,
so I am relying on The Daily's reporting
of the event. However, it seems that
mocking a wedding disrespects the ritual
and the institution of marriage and is thus
counterproductive to the cause of equal

marriage rights. How are we to convince
people that same-sex couples will respect
and cherish the institution of marriage if
we perform fake weddings in White Plaza
to celebrate friendship? (Celebrating
friendship is certainly not a bad thing, but
using a wedding ceremony to do so di
lutes the meaning of the ceremony.)
There is a better way to "make people
stop and think" about the importance of
equal marriage rights: hold meaningful
wedding ceremonies between same-sex
couples who are ready to commit to shar
ing a life together. Educate people about
the love these couples share, the children
they raise and the injustice they face from
being denied the recognition, rights, and

responsibilities of civil marriage. But
please don't make fun of the very institu
tion you hope to expand and enrich.

Criticism of Branner unwarranted
As a former Branner resident. I do not
feel that Mark Thoma's criticism of the
Branner staff and Resident Fellow Ken
nell Jackson (" 'Stonewalling' The Daily
makes Branner staff looking amateurish,"
Feb. 14) were warranted. Branner,
through Jackson, has a long-standing cate
gorical rule amongst staff members
against speaking to the press. One reason

for this is that Jackson realizes that on the
Stanford campus "Branner" is akin to a
brand name. I would hesitate to call Jack
son a "martyr," but those who know the
long-tenured RF personally will probably
agree with me that he is willing, even
eager, to have his own name dragged
through the mud in order to keep Bran
ner's name from being exposed to nega
tive publicity. Moreover, this has long
been his stance with respect to The Daily.
It has nothing to do with the Zuckerberg
issue or some widespread conspiracy to
crack down on campus drinking.
