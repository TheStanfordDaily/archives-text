# Phone, Internet costs combined into one bill
## 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ STAFF WRITER 
Student in-room network connection and
landline telephone fees will be bundled into
one new telecommunications bill, which all
Stanford students, except Schwab residents,
will be required to pay by fall of next acade
mic year, according to a new plan unveiled
by Residential Computing and Internet
Technology Systems and Services, or ITSS.
According to the Residential Computing
Web site, the new fee is $48 per quarter and
will combine both in-room network connec
tion and telephone services. The current sys
tem. which separates the fees, charges stu
dents $42 for the phone and $36 for the net
work connection.
The new plan will allow students to sub
scribe to in-room network services and a
land-line telephone service without paying a
$33 activation fee. Currently, students pay
$12 a month per network connection, and
this fee will increase $2 a month, according to
Residential Computing.
The system will also provide all affected
students with land-line telephones, even if
they do not want them.
Students who use more than one in-room
network connection will benefit most from

the plan. However, students who do not
need an in-room network connection or
land-line telephone services in their rooms
will be charged $144 more for the whole
year.
Junior Kory Vargas Caro, vice president
of the ASSU. is concerned that some stu
dents will be over-charged under the new
plan.
"I think many students will object to the
bundling of phones and internet since most
students use cell phones and don't use land
line phones," he said.
According to Residential Computing, 50
percent of undergraduates and 75 percent of
graduate students have land-line phones.
Accordingly, a thin majority of students will
save money under the new system.
Sophomore Ouinn Wilhelmi said he
thought the new system was worth minimal
overcharges.
"It seems that in aggregate the plan will
save Stanford students a big chunk of
change," he said. "1 guess the liberal weenie
side of me says whatever's good for the col
lective is good for the individual."
Bundling in-room network connection
and land-line phone fees will benefit the
University by providing simplicity
and cost efficiency, as well as reduc
ing administrative costs, the
ResComp Web site states. The fee
will also increase revenues, which
will help reimburse losses due to de
clining land-line phone subscrip
tions.
According to ResComp, the in
crease in land-line telephones will
also enhance student safety and secu
rity, since they work with the Door
King system that allows students to
buzz visitors into their dormitories.
Emergency calls can also be traced
on land-line phones and not on most
cell phones.
Despite these advantages, the
new bundled fee may not be perma
nent and is subject to change with
time, said Richard Holeton, head of
ResComp.
"This plan seems to be clearly the
best path in the short term, but it's al
ways subject to reevaluation, particu
larly as technologies continue to
evolve and after we achieve more
stable funding for student network
ing on campus." he said.
The fee will undergo reevaluation
after one year with the help of the
Student Technology Assessment
Committee, a newly-formed group
devised by the ASSU. Comprised of
both undergraduate and graduate
students, the committee will examine
issues concerning cell phone and in
ternet use, downloadable music,
cable television and land-line
phones.
"We hope to look at students'
technology needs across-the-board,"
Vargas Caro said. "Since many of us
see this as a quick fix, we want to find
out what students really want so that
they have the best plan."

and cost efficiency, as well as reduc
ing administrative costs, the
ResComp Web site states. The fee
will also increase revenues, which
will help reimburse losses due to de
clining land-line phone subscrip
tions.
According to ResComp, the in
crease in land-line telephones will
also enhance student safety and secu
rity, since they work with the Door
King system that allows students to
buzz visitors into their dormitories.
Emergency calls can also be traced
on land-line phones and not on most
cell phones.
Despite these advantages, the
new bundled fee may not be perma
nent and is subject to change with
time, said Richard Holeton, head of
ResComp.
"This plan seems to be clearly the
best path in the short term, but it's al
ways subject to reevaluation, particu
larly as technologies continue to
evolve and after we achieve more
stable funding for student network
ing on campus." he said.
The fee will undergo reevaluation
after one year with the help of the
Student Technology Assessment
Committee, a newly-formed group
devised by the ASSU. Comprised of
both undergraduate and graduate
students, the committee will examine
issues concerning cell phone and in
ternet use, downloadable music,
cable television and land-line
phones.
"We hope to look at students'
technology needs across-the-board,"
Vargas Caro said. "Since many of us
see this as a quick fix, we want to find
out what students really want so that
they have the best plan."
