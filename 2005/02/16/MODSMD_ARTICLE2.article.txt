Student in-room network connection and
landline telephone fees will be bundled into
one new telecommunications bill, which all
Stanford students, except Schwab residents,
will be required to pay by fall of next acade
mic year, according to a new plan unveiled
by Residential Computing and Internet
Technology Systems and Services, or ITSS.
According to the Residential Computing
Web site, the new fee is $48 per quarter and
will combine both in-room network connec
tion and telephone services. The current sys
tem. which separates the fees, charges stu
dents $42 for the phone and $36 for the net
work connection.
The new plan will allow students to sub
scribe to in-room network services and a
land-line telephone service without paying a
$33 activation fee. Currently, students pay
$12 a month per network connection, and
this fee will increase $2 a month, according to
Residential Computing.
The system will also provide all affected
students with land-line telephones, even if
they do not want them.
Students who use more than one in-room
network connection will benefit most from

the plan. However, students who do not
need an in-room network connection or
land-line telephone services in their rooms
will be charged $144 more for the whole
year.
Junior Kory Vargas Caro, vice president
of the ASSU. is concerned that some stu
dents will be over-charged under the new
plan.
"I think many students will object to the
bundling of phones and internet since most
students use cell phones and don't use land
line phones," he said.
According to Residential Computing, 50
percent of undergraduates and 75 percent of
graduate students have land-line phones.
Accordingly, a thin majority of students will
save money under the new system.
Sophomore Ouinn Wilhelmi said he
thought the new system was worth minimal
overcharges.
"It seems that in aggregate the plan will
save Stanford students a big chunk of
change," he said. "1 guess the liberal weenie
side of me says whatever's good for the col
lective is good for the individual."
