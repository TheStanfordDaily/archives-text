# Let it be
## Dems win on Social Security? Democrats bet the farm on keeping the status quo 
### 
The outcome of the social securi
ty debate will not hinge on which
proposal is most economically
sound, but by which party's political
tactics will prevail. And, for the first
time in recent memory, the
Democrats may have embarked as
the winner.
The Democrats have bet the

farm, for now, on
keeping the sta
tus quo. For
decades, insiders
and pundits re
ferred to social
security as the
third rail of na
tional politics:
you touch it, you
die.

But a rejuvenated President
George W. Bush (who can count
down the minutes to his political
death four years from now) doesn't
care and may actually be doing the
Democrats a favor by introducing
the issue to voters now.
Putting it out there now makes
congressional Republicans who side
with the President vulnerable in the
midterm elections next year. If
Democrats can hold the hard line
between now and then, they could
stand to pick up seats.
Bush is popular, but when he's up
against the AARP and more than
seventy years of conventional wis
dom, well, I'm not sure even Lindsay
Lohan could sell this idea. And she's
popular.
So the Democratic plan hinges to
a large extent on picking up seats in
2(H)6. This would give them momen
tum — momentum they need going
into 2008.
Democratic victories, even if they
do not take back majorities, would
help their position immensely. It
would demonstrate to Republican
lawmakers that the people side with
them on this issue. They could then
force concessions from Republican
lawmakers on key sticking points,
such as raising payroll taxes and re
ducing benefits. But most impor
tantly, social security would become
their issue.

1 give Bush a lot of credit over the
past four years for his ability to set
the agenda and run with it. He took
education away from the Democrats
by enacting his No Child Left Be
hind act. Not many remember that
Sen. Joe Lieberman, a former
Democratic presidential candidate,
introduced legislation to create a de
partment of homeland security long
before Bush did. But after Sept. 11,
Bush was not about to let another
politician become the hero, and he
took Lieberman's bill and made it
his own.
The Democrats can do this with
social security by sticking to their
plan for now and gradually compro
mising down the road.
I'm fine with social security re
form. The way the demographics
shake out. the current system cannot
continue to operate indefinitely. By
2042, the government needs to have
enacted changes to ensure its long
term viability.
But that's 37 years away.
I would prefer that history not tell
the story that Bush was the one who
saved social security. Yes, this is par
tisan, and 1 know a number of you
out there, regardless of your political
beliefs, dislike partisanship above all
else.
But any way that social security re
form is done will be partisan — that's
the nature of the political game.
So given the choices, 1 would
rather have the Democrats win this
battle. 1 don't just say this because of
who 1 usually vote for; I say this be
cause America is in danger of losing
its system of checks and balances.
It's unsafe for one party to control all
three branches of government fora
variety of reasons, and social securi
ty might be the one issue that can
catapult the minority party back into
a position of national strength.
This would be good for
Democrats, but it would also be bet
ter for America.
Hopefully, Democrats realize
that by sticking to their guns now
and taking this issue away from the
GOP, they have a good shot at long
term party revitalization.
All I'm asking for is a little bit of
vision, folks. Social security isn't
going anywhere.
