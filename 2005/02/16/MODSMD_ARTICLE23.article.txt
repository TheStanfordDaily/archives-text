### NANCY WANG STAFF WRITER 
Islam Awareness Month kicked
off last Sunday with the first of four
dinner and lecture events in a series
titled "A Taste of Islam 2005." Orga
nizers from both the Muslim Student
Awareness Network, or MSAN, and
the Islamic Society of Stanford Uni
versity, or ISSU, said they hope that
the events will dispel misconceptions
that people may have about the reli
gion and highlight the diversity of Is
lamic cultures.
Each of the dinners in the series
will spotlight different Islamic coun
tries, including Egypt, China.
Ethiopia and the United States. Or
ganizers said they hope the themed
dinners will help defy media portray
als that all Muslims are Arabs and
vice versa.
The first speaker event addressed
the role of women in the religion,
and the events to come will address
the concept of Jihad, what it means
to be Muslim and the Muslim-Amer
ican experience.

Sophomore Shelley Cheung,
vice president of MSAN and an or
ganizer of Islam Awareness Month,
cited a poster for the month's
events at Tresidder Memorial
Union that was graffitied to say
"Terrorism = Jihad," to stress that
there are still many myths about
the Islamic faith that need to be
countered.
"I was extremely saddened by
this incident but optimistic that
Islam Awareness Month will change
the perspectives of many here in our
Stanford community in a positive
manner," Cheung said.
MSAN began organizing Islam
Awareness weeks in 1997 and
since then, it has not only become
an annual tradition, but has ex
panded to encompass more infor
mation.
"Islam Awareness Month was
started by MSAN as an effort to in
crease knowledge in the communi
ty about the different aspects of
Islam often unheard of, miscon
strued or simply misunderstood,"
said senior Rania Eltom, president

of MSAN.
In the past, the month has in
cluded Arabic calligraphy work
shops, dorm talks, art exhibits, cul
tural displays and ethnic-themed
dinners.
This upcoming Sunday, a free
Ethiopian dinner will be served in
conjunction with a speech by
Hisham Abdallah entitled "Jihad or
Terrorism? (Misconceptions creat
ed by the Media)."
Organizers said they hope that
students attending the events will
walk away with a new understanding
and perspective on Islam.
"In the absence of courses about
Islam, the only way Stanford stu
dents learn about Islam is through
modern-day media, which paints the
picture of Islam as a violent, intoler
ant and anti-modern religion," said
sophomore Omar Shakir, a member
of MSAN.
"Our aim is to counteract these
images and convey to the Stanford
community why it is that we, along
side 1.3 billion people worldwide,
are Muslims."
