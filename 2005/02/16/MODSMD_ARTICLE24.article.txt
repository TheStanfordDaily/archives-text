# Student organization celebrates Kyoto Protocol
## 
### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE 
To commemorate the taking effect of the Kyoto
Protocol, completed exactly six years and 11 months
today. Students fora Sustainable Stanford will turn
White Plaza into a forum on global warming and re
lated issues from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
"The [Kyoto Protocol] is the first binding interna
tional regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in his
tory," said freshman Seth Silverman, member of the
student organization, adding that the agreement re
quires nations that signed to cut greenhouse gas emis
sions between 2(X)8 and 2012 by at least five percent.
Silverman also said this commitment period will
be followed by subsequent commitments, and more
stringent emission reduction standards â€” all of
which the United States is exempt from.
"Many thought that the Kyoto Protocol was
dead, especially after George W. Bush became
president and said that the United States would stop
negotiating in the Kyoto agreement," Silverman
said. "(To survive] the protocol needed 55 ratifying

nations responsible for at least 55 percent of the
world's emissions."
The Protocol was revived on Nov. 18,2(X)4, when
it was ratified by Russia.
Members of Students fora Sustainable Stan
ford said they hope to educate students on what
they can do individually to lower greenhouse gas
emissions and to discuss the position of the United
States on these issues within the international
community.
" We hope to show a visual depiction of how much
the United States contributes to international green
house gases and how detrimental these gases are to
the environment," said sophomore Becca Miller, co
organizer of the event. "There are about 30 students
actively involved in Students fora Sustainable Stan
ford. |but] we hope that many, many more will take a
moment to stop and look at our display."
Sophomore Emma Yuen, a leader of Students
fora Sustainable Stanford, said that it is especially
important for students to understand the funda
mentals of global warming since the University

plays a key role in national climate change research.
"Many faculty members and students are work
ing to reduce carbon emissions in all different disci
plines with new technologies, regulations, conserva
tion measures and even new philosophies about
human responsibilities when we change the living
conditions on earth," Yuen said.
She added that the United States, "with only
four percent of the world's population, is responsi
ble for 30 percent of historic carbon dioxide emis
sions, which makes it both the largest per capita
emitter and the largest overall greenhouse gas emit
ter in history and in the world today."
Yuen said she believes the United States will
face consequences in the future for not participating
in the Kyoto Protocol.
"The [protocol] is not perfect, but refusing to
adopt significant measures that reduce global
warming will foster ill will from [participating! coun
tries," she said." 11 America does not work to reduce
climate change, we risk the health of our country,
the world and our future."
