# Schwarzenegger cuts funding for California schools
## 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ STAFF WRITER 
Citing California's budget constraints Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger recently announced his in
tention to amend Proposition 98 and suspend the
$2.3 billion dollars that he promised to give Califor
nia schools this year, a move which has raised con
cerns among Stanford students and faculty alike.
Prop. 98, approved by voters in 1998, helps to
buffer primary and secondary education from state
budget cuts by guaranteeing schools a 40 percent
share of growing state revenues.
Schwarzenegger's proposed modifications will
allow him to hold back a portion of the funding that
would normally be allotted to schools. He failed to give
this money to sch(X)ls last year, and instead promised
he would reinvest the money in education this year.
Withholding these funds will impact over 9,087
public schools and the education of nearly 6 million
children, according to an article in The San Francis
co Chronicle on Feb. 1.
These numbers have raised public concern, es
pecially in since California ranks 48th in the nation
for fourth and eighth grade standardized test scores.

according to a study conducted by the Rand Corpo
ration, which conducts independent research on
policy issues.
Schwarzenegger's proposed education budget
will also reduce per-pupil spending to $h,716 nearly
$600 less than the national average.
Several Stanford students said they are frustrat
ed by the announcement of the budget cuts.
"This is terribly disappointing from a governor
who campaigned on his
commitment to education," said Gilbert Martinez,
a fourth-year doctoral candidate in biochemistry.
"This sends a sad message about our commitment
to the most vulnerable citizens, children."
Eric Kramon, a fifth-year co-terminal student in
international and comparative education, also ex
pressed disappointment with the governor's pro
posed education cutbacks.
"The governor is yet another example of a politi
cian who talks a big game about education and the
importance of youth but does not step up to the
plate when it comes time to give the education sec
tor the funds it desperately needs," Kramon said. "If
the Republican Party truly wants to leave no child
behind, it should begin by providing adequate fund

ing for the education system."
According to the Schwarzenegger's Web site,
budget constraints forced him to make a decision
between reducing funding for education and lower
ing spending for health and human services.
By holding back education funds, Schwarzeneg
ger said he would protect services for Californians
with disabilities from budget reductions. His plan
also calls fora $1.2 million increase in teacher's
medical and retirement benefits by 2(X)6.
Still, Education Prof. Martin Carnoy said he is
not impressed, but rather concerned with how the
governor's plan will affect California's already
poorly funded schools.
"The quality of education in the state — already
low — is going to be hurt, no doubt about it,"he said.
Carnoy also said that Schwarzenegger struck
down a proposed increase on automobile registra
tion fees last year, giving Californians a small
amount of money each, but costing the state a total
of $8 billion within the last two years — money that
could have been better spent on education.
"I am willing to pay higher registration fees for
my car in return for better schools," Carnoy said.
"Why doesn't he put that on the ballot?"
