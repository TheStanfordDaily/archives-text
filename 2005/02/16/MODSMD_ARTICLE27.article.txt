For freshmen, it was like Admit Weekend again - only

The event, entitled "Celebr'oB," included speeches by
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education John Bravman,
University provost John Etchemendy and Dean of Fresh
men and Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-Haims, as well as
performances by the Spoken Word Collective and the Stan
ford Improvisors.
"The purpose of the mid-year convocation was to gather
the entire freshman class half-way through the school year,"
said Lythcott-Haims. "We wanted to acknowledge how far
they've come and forecast what lies ahead."
In his speech, Bravman assured students that failure and
victory can both serve as avenues toward knowledge.
"You have all seen intellectual victory and defeat," Brav
man said. "We grow, we learn and we stretch our minds
through failure."

of the college experience â€” the clock. the calendar and caf

"I joked before that these three C's are not your first
three grades in Chemistry," Bravman quipped. "But now
maybe they are."
Etchemendy stressed the importance of exploring vari
ous intellectual fields to broaden one's horizons before set

some classes and subjects you're not going to
major in," Etchemendy advised. "Find some classes that do
not satisfy any requirements and take them."
Lythcott-Haims spoke of the importance of seeking help
in such an intense and challenging learning environment.
"For starters, just give up the idea that there is shame in
asking for help," Lythcott-Haims said. "The only shame is in
not taking advantage of it all."
Students also had an opportunity to offer their per
spectives on Stanford, via artistic performances and ex
pression.
Freshman William Von Hoene gave his spoken-word ren
dition of his love for Stanford. The SIMPS, Stanford's impro

asking audience members for ideas for skits.
