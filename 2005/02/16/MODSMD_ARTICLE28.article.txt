## Right in the Babymaker NBA's image is pure madness 
### 
Don't get me wrong, I've always liked
basketball. I grew up with a hoop in
the driveway, and 1 always run the
house March Madness pool. I just hate the pro
game. So when February rolls around and
"NBA" pops to the top of the queue on the
lett-hand side of the ESPN.com homepage,
you'll have to forgive me for diverting myself
with NFL Blitz, webtender.com and the col
lege game until spring training starts.

I grew up in the orbit of
Los Angeles, where the
Lakers are afforded more
attention than any profes
sional sports franchise de
serves, ostensibly due to
the city's lack of a football
team. Still, rooting for the
Lakers is repulsive to me.
Imagine cheering for the
Yankees. Now imagine
Derek Jeter is a confirmed

philanderer, a bad teammate and an alleged
rapist.
Thing is. nobody seems to care. We've got
ten to the point now where whatever happens
off the court is supposed to be just another
part of the players' lives, as if it were expected.
Granted, the word "rape" still tends to give
even the most jaded NBA fans pause, but un
less it's a big star's face on Sports Center with
the word "arrested" beneath it, the story tends
to slide.
The Pacers-Pistons brawl was a supposed
watershed moment after which nothing would
be the same. But was anyone really surprised?
Forty percent of NBA players have criminal
records. Read that again. That means that on
average, there are four guys on the court at
any given time who have committed a crimi
nal offense. So when Stephen Jackson and
Ron Artest turned into "Bad Dudes" for the
original NES. I wasn't shocked. Even when
everyone got all weepy over the Pistons'
championship last year as the triumph over
the big, bad Lakers, you knew there was a
time bomb ticking somewhere.
There's a lot of hand-wringing going on
lately, as if David Stern were wondering why
so many of his players are acting like crimi
nals. You know why? Because they are crimi
nals. No matter how many United Way ads I
see, my spokesman for the NBA will still be
Zach Randolph, about whom his high school


Dan McCarthy
coach once said. "I just don't want
the day to come where I pick up that
paper and it says (Zach) shot some
one or that he was shot. Every day
that goes by that I don't see that, I
feel good." Whether the NBA likes
it or not (and it's not entirely clear),
its players have portrayed them
selves to the community at large as
ignorant (Jason Williams), violent

(Ron Artest) and promiscuous
(Shawn Kemp).
The NBA consciously made the
decision to market itself as a sport of
rebellion and free expression, em
phasizing the "street" aspects of the
game over fundamental play in its
advertising to the point where the
midrange jumper has become more
extinct than tasteful uniforms (with
apologies to the Celtics). Nowhere
was this more apparent than this
summer in Athens, though, where —
let's not mince words — the U.S.
men's basketball team embarrassed
itself with a bronze medal. The NBA

has become, for lack of a better
word, Sprewellian.
It's not quite that simple, though.
When people spout opinions of
NBA players — for example,
"They're all thugs" — there tends to
be a backlash that it's racism — that
people don't like to see rich black
athletes succeed in a forum that tol
erates misbehavior. But the NBA
seems to encourage this view by
doing virtually nothing about its of
fenders and creating a product that is
an enclave of young black men per
forming in an arena full of older
white men. At some point, the NBA

has to do more than just stare con
tritely at the floor and promise that it
will never happen again — essential
ly, that it will control the players
rather than changing their nature.
The NBA dug its own grave when
it sensationalized a sport that sur
vives best on subtlety. Glass-shatter
ing throwdowns and cults of person
ality put butts in the seats; the pick
and-roll doesn't. Therefore, the
NBA is more than content to let peo
ple like Latrell Sprewell, who proba
bly has his own wing in Hell named
after him at this point, be its face.
Watching NBA games in the

past five years has still been fun —
fun in the same way that watching
the McDonald's High School All-
American Slam Dunk contest is
fun. You stumble across ESPN2 at
three in the afternoon and see
some skinny 17-year-old future
multimillionaire on a court by him
self, playing to a crowd of about a
thousand people all screaming
"Oh, SHEEEEEIIITT!" every 10
seconds. Snap him up now, profes
sional basketball — there's your
savior. Just hope he doesn't kill
anyone intentionally before his ca
reer starts, but even if he does, it'll

make fora nice "Repentance /
Comeback"-themed piece in
Sports Illustrated.
So that's it. Let me know when
someone a) stabs an opposing play
er on the court, b) scores 200 points
in a game on 90-for-600 shooting,
or c) releases a rap album at half
time. Until then.

Dan McCarthy, a junior, is elated
that when he now hears the term
"battery," he will think of pitchers
and catchers reporting and not an
other NHA player's police record. E
