## Right in the Babymaker NBA's image is pure madness 
### 
Don't get me wrong, I've always liked
basketball. I grew up with a hoop in
the driveway, and 1 always run the
house March Madness pool. I just hate the pro
game. So when February rolls around and
"NBA" pops to the top of the queue on the
lett-hand side of the ESPN.com homepage,
you'll have to forgive me for diverting myself
with NFL Blitz, webtender.com and the col
lege game until spring training starts.

I grew up in the orbit of
Los Angeles, where the
Lakers are afforded more
attention than any profes
sional sports franchise de
serves, ostensibly due to
the city's lack of a football
team. Still, rooting for the
Lakers is repulsive to me.
Imagine cheering for the
Yankees. Now imagine
Derek Jeter is a confirmed

philanderer, a bad teammate and an alleged
rapist.
Thing is. nobody seems to care. We've got
ten to the point now where whatever happens
off the court is supposed to be just another
part of the players' lives, as if it were expected.
Granted, the word "rape" still tends to give
even the most jaded NBA fans pause, but un
less it's a big star's face on Sports Center with
the word "arrested" beneath it, the story tends
to slide.
The Pacers-Pistons brawl was a supposed
watershed moment after which nothing would
be the same. But was anyone really surprised?
Forty percent of NBA players have criminal
records. Read that again. That means that on
average, there are four guys on the court at
any given time who have committed a crimi
nal offense. So when Stephen Jackson and
Ron Artest turned into "Bad Dudes" for the
original NES. I wasn't shocked. Even when
everyone got all weepy over the Pistons'
championship last year as the triumph over
the big, bad Lakers, you knew there was a
time bomb ticking somewhere.
There's a lot of hand-wringing going on
lately, as if David Stern were wondering why
so many of his players are acting like crimi
nals. You know why? Because they are crimi
nals. No matter how many United Way ads I
see, my spokesman for the NBA will still be
Zach Randolph, about whom his high school
