## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
It's that time again. Midterms have officially con
sumed the lives of many a Stanford student. The mem
bers of the No. 7 Stanford men's tennis team are no ex
ception, as the Cardinal (6-0) gear up for their own
midterm, the National Team Indoor Championship to
morrow through Sunday in Chicago.
The 16-team tournament, which Stanford is compet
ing in for the 30th time, features 12 of the top 13 teams in
the latest ITA poll. The Cardinal will get their first look
at teams ranked in the top 10. Top-ranked Baylor, fol
lowed by UCLA. Florida, Georgia and Illinois round out
the top five in the polls and are seeded accordingly at
Team Indoor this weekend.
Stanford is one of eight teams to win the Team Indoor
title, winning a record 12 times. The Cardinal last won the
title in 2CK)2 and lost in the semifinals last year.
Ranked fifth in 2(XV4, Stanford defeated No. 13 Texas
in the first round and then proceeded to upset No. 4 Van
derbilt in the quarterfinals. However, the Cardinal then

lost 4-2 to last year's top seed. Illinois. The Illini went on
to capture their second title in as many years.
Only four Stanford team members have competed in
the Indoor Championship before.
Last year, when the tournament was held in Seattle,
both senior Sam Warburg and sophomore James Wan
went undefeated in singles at the No. 2 and No. 6 posi
tions, respectively. Senior Phil Sheng and junior KC
Corkery have also competed in the tournament. On the
other hand, junior Jon Wong, sophomore Eric McKean
and freshman Phil Kao are new to the tournament but
look to make an impact in their debuts.
"We're undefeated right now," Corkery said. "We've
played some good teams but definitely haven't played a
top-10 team in the country yet. Not to say that the teams
we've played were bad; they were definitely challenges
we faced. But I feel like we're going to see how we stack
up against some of the top teams in the country and hope
fully come out of it, win or lose, with an idea of what we
need to improve on and what we need to look forward to

Sam Warburg and the unbeaten men's tennis team will face the top five teams in the nation when they travel to
the National Team Indoor Championship in Chicago tomorrow. Warburg was unbeaten in last year's tourney.
as NCAAs comes around at the end of
the year."
This year, the Cardinal will need
to focus on doubles, as grabbing this
first point is much like knowing the
answer to the first question on an
exam. It builds confidence and re
lieves some pressure for the remain
der of the test. Having to win only
half of the six singles matches is a less
daunting task than having to win
four.
In last year's tournament. Stanford
lost the doubles point in all three of its

matches. However, the Cardinal have
won the doubles point in all of their
dual matches this season.
"It's important, that first point of
the match; it sets the tone, takes the
pressure off some guys when we have
that point up on the board," Corkery
said. "We're going to continue to
work hard on our doubles; it's been
kind of a mainstay of the program.
Since I've known it, Stanford has been
really strong at doubles and it's always
been that way. We're going to try to
keep that tradition together, because
it makes a big difference knowing you
only have to win half of the singles."
First-round play begins tomorrow
as the Cardinal take on No. 9 Virginia
(5-0) at noon CST.
"Virginia will be a touuh match,"

head coach John Whitlinger said.
"It'll tell us a lot about ourselves. Vir
ginia's a very good team; they had a
great season last year. I don't think
they lost anybody from last year's
team and also got a couple new play
ers in this year who are very good. It's
going to be a big test, but I like the way
our guys are playing and competing so
it's going to be at un match to watch."
Should Stanford defeat the Cava
liers. the team will face the winner of
the match between No. 2 UCLA and
No. 25 Oklahoma State.
"Regardless, they're going to get
better and better with each match."
Whitlinger said. "This weekend is
the first taste of real high-level com
petition. They will be better for it
down the road."
