## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
It's that time again. Midterms have officially con
sumed the lives of many a Stanford student. The mem
bers of the No. 7 Stanford men's tennis team are no ex
ception, as the Cardinal (6-0) gear up for their own
midterm, the National Team Indoor Championship to
morrow through Sunday in Chicago.
The 16-team tournament, which Stanford is compet
ing in for the 30th time, features 12 of the top 13 teams in
the latest ITA poll. The Cardinal will get their first look
at teams ranked in the top 10. Top-ranked Baylor, fol
lowed by UCLA. Florida, Georgia and Illinois round out
the top five in the polls and are seeded accordingly at
Team Indoor this weekend.
Stanford is one of eight teams to win the Team Indoor
title, winning a record 12 times. The Cardinal last won the
title in 2CK)2 and lost in the semifinals last year.
Ranked fifth in 2(XV4, Stanford defeated No. 13 Texas
in the first round and then proceeded to upset No. 4 Van
derbilt in the quarterfinals. However, the Cardinal then

lost 4-2 to last year's top seed. Illinois. The Illini went on
to capture their second title in as many years.
Only four Stanford team members have competed in
the Indoor Championship before.
Last year, when the tournament was held in Seattle,
both senior Sam Warburg and sophomore James Wan
went undefeated in singles at the No. 2 and No. 6 posi
tions, respectively. Senior Phil Sheng and junior KC
Corkery have also competed in the tournament. On the
other hand, junior Jon Wong, sophomore Eric McKean
and freshman Phil Kao are new to the tournament but
look to make an impact in their debuts.
"We're undefeated right now," Corkery said. "We've
played some good teams but definitely haven't played a
top-10 team in the country yet. Not to say that the teams
we've played were bad; they were definitely challenges
we faced. But I feel like we're going to see how we stack
up against some of the top teams in the country and hope
fully come out of it, win or lose, with an idea of what we
need to improve on and what we need to look forward to
