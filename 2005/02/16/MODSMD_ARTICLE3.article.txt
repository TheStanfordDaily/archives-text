# $9 million to fund climate research

### ADAM WIDMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
To support research in fuel-cell technology, fuel effi
ciency and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,
Stanford's Global Climate Energy Project, or GCEP. re
cently awarded research grants totaling $9 million to fac
ulty members at the University and their collaborators at
other institutions.
"GCEP is working on the underlying science and en
gineering that will make possible ways to reduce green
house emissions," said Petroleum Engineering Prof.
Franklin Orr. director of GCEP. "With the new projects,
we will have 31 research groups funded to do research on
a variety of energy topics."
Founded in 2(X)2, GCEP's major objectives are to re
search strategies for cutting emissions of harmful gases,
to find ways to create and maintain a high-efficiency en
ergy supply and to assess the barriers that stand between
hypothetical technologies and practical applications, ac
cording to its Web site.
"Our mission is to conduct fundamental research on
technologies that will permit the development of global
energy systems with significantly lower greenhouse gas
emissions," said Maxine Lym, the project's communica
tion manager.
According to Orr. the distribution of new funds is not
related to any domestic or international political issues.
The new research efforts will be funded over a span of
three years and will apply to seven GCEP projects in
volving faculty from a range of departments, from chem
istry to genetics.
"We have research underway on photovoltaics that
will be less expensive to manufacture, on fuel cells that
will allow more efficient electricity production, on ad
vanced combustion that will allow more efficient use of
fuels, on hydrogen production from biological systems
and so on." Orr said. "Somewhere around 80 graduate
students and 15 post-docs are involved in the research."
The funds will be distributed to researchers on other
campuses. Support will go to researchers at the Energy
Research Centre of the Netherlands, the Delft Universi
ty of Technology, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technol
ogy Zurich, the Carnegie Institution of Washington and
the University of Montana.
