# Cardinal try to stay perfect at Big Swim
## The
						unbeaten men's team hopes to hand Berkeley its first loss 
### SAMUEL CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford football team had a shot to
upset BCS hopeful Cal at Big Game. The
Cardinal men's and women's basketball
teams each swept the Bears this season. But
none of these games featured two undefeat
ed top-five squads entering their respective
final regular season competitions. This mar
quee event is set to occur in the pool for the
annual Big Swim when the No. 2 Stanford
men's swimming and diving team (6-0, 3-0
Pacific-10 Conference) visits Berkeley to
take on No. 4 California (8-0,3-0) Saturday.

"There is a great sense of excitement for
this meet," senior co-captain Jayme Cramer
said. "Everyone on the team always gets
fired up to race our nemesis from across the
bay."
Though the Stanford swimmers consis
tently say that their preparation for this meet
is no different from their preparation for any
other matchup, the anxiety is definitely pre
sent, as the Cardinal seniors seek perfection.
Stanford's non-senior swimmers plan on
supporting that ambition with some fast
times.
"This year's senior class has never lost a
dual meet," noted freshman Daniel Beal.

"Keeping the streak alive for our seniors is
motivation enough to swim fast."
The strong motivation for swimming at
the highest level, though, is not unilateral.
Cal has come on strong in recent months be
hind the efforts of 2004 Olympians Hen
rique Barbosa, Milorad Cavic and Duje Dra
ganja. This trio and a strong supporting cast
hope to put an end to Stanford's dual-meet
winning streak, which currently stands at 38.
Following three consecutive years of
domination, when Stanford cruised to victo
ries of 180-103,195.5-104.5 and 173-112 from
2001 until 2(X)3, Cal put up a strong effort in
last season's regular season finale, when

both teams again had a chance to finish the
season undefeated. However, Stanford
closed out the meet with a stronger perfor
mance, squeezing out a 126-117 victory, pro
viding the momentum the Cardinal used to
win their 23rd consecutive Pac-10 title.
The Bears are seeking to achieve a rare
Big Swim victory; a win Saturday would
mark Cal's 14th triumph in the 107 all-time
meetings between the two schools.
Coming in with different strengths,
many expect this to be one of the closest
scoring meets in the history of the rivalry.
