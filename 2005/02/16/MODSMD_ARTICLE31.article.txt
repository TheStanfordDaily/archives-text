# Card travel to Westwood
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If numbers told the whole story,
this one would be brief.
Tomorrow evening, the No. 11
men's volleyball team will take on
No. 1 UCLA.
The Bruins have won all but one
of their matches this season and enter
tomorrow's contest with a 12-1 over
all record (8-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation).
The Bruins' lone loss came to de
fending national champion and No. 6
BYU. UCLA came back the next
evening and blanked the Cougars 3-0
- one of their eight shutouts this sea
son. Thus, the Bruins have defeated
every team they have played this sea
son.
In comparison, the Cardinal are 4-
8 overall (3-6 MPSF). Their only vic
tories have been shutouts; they have
yet to win a match in which they have
lost a game. If this trend continues,
Stanford will have to come out par
ticularly strong against UCLA if it
hopes to upset the conference leader.
The fact that this will be a home
game for the Bruins does not help the
Cardinal's cause. UCLA is undefeat-

Ed at home this season.
However, Stanford head coach
Don Shaw insists that the numbers
do not always dictate the outcome.
"We always have a chance to
win," Shaw said. "We don't ever go
into a match thinking we don't have a
chance. We've always played them
pretty well; played them tough."
Shaw referred to a match against
the Bruins last season, where the
Cardinal faced a situation very simi
lar to the one they will face tomor
row. Stanford, ranked just as they are
now at No. 11, faced a No. 2 UCLA
squad and pulled off a major upset,
downing the Bruins 3-1.
However, that was a home game
for Stanford. Their next meeting with
UCLA that season was an away
game that ended in a 3-2 loss. By that
point, the Cardinal had fallen to No.
12, and the Bruins had climbed to No.

The players echoed Shaw's senti
ment that numbers and ranking real
ly don't tell the whole story. The Car
dinal said they believe that if they
fight for every point and work to
gether well as a team, they have a
shot at defeating the Bruins.
"It'll be a big challenge, but hope

fully we can pull off an upset," senior
Craig Buell said. "1 think they don't
have much respect for us because
we've got a poor record and we could
really surprise them. We've definite
ly done it before."
Stanford will have to watch out
for Bruin redshirt senior Paul John
son, a third-team All-American just
like the Cardinal's own redshirt se
nior Kevin Hansen. Johnson leads
UCLA with 150 kills, 17 service aces
and an impressive .486 hitting per
centage.
The Cardinal squad, on the other
hand, has a wider base of team lead
ers. Buell has provided much of Stan
ford's offense this season, with 125
kills and a .416 hitting percentage.
But Buell has received help from fel
low senior David Vogel, who leads
the team in both kills (127) and digs
(91) and junior Ben Reddy. who has
124 kills this season.
"We'll give them a good match,"
Shaw said. "If they're not ready to
play us, then they might pay the
price."
Following the game tomorrow,
the Cardinal will travel to UC-Irvine
(5-8, 3-5 MPSF) to play the No. 10
Anteaters Saturday.

lost a game. If this trend continues,
Stanford will have to come out par
ticularly strong against UCLA if it
hopes to upset the conference leader.
The fact that this will be a home
game for the Bruins does not help the
Cardinal's cause. UCLA is undefeat-

Ed at home this season.
However, Stanford head coach
Don Shaw insists that the numbers
do not always dictate the outcome.
"We always have a chance to
win," Shaw said. "We don't ever go
into a match thinking we don't have a
chance. We've always played them
pretty well; played them tough."
Shaw referred to a match against
the Bruins last season, where the
Cardinal faced a situation very simi
lar to the one they will face tomor
row. Stanford, ranked just as they are
now at No. 11, faced a No. 2 UCLA
squad and pulled off a major upset,
downing the Bruins 3-1.
However, that was a home game
for Stanford. Their next meeting with
UCLA that season was an away
game that ended in a 3-2 loss. By that
point, the Cardinal had fallen to No.
12, and the Bruins had climbed to No.
1.
The players echoed Shaw's senti
ment that numbers and ranking real
ly don't tell the whole story. The Car
dinal said they believe that if they
fight for every point and work to
gether well as a team, they have a
shot at defeating the Bruins.
"It'll be a big challenge, but hope

fully we can pull off an upset," senior
Craig Buell said. "1 think they don't
have much respect for us because
we've got a poor record and we could
really surprise them. We've definite
ly done it before."
Stanford will have to watch out
for Bruin redshirt senior Paul John
son, a third-team All-American just
like the Cardinal's own redshirt se
nior Kevin Hansen. Johnson leads
UCLA with 150 kills, 17 service aces
and an impressive .486 hitting per
centage.
The Cardinal squad, on the other
hand, has a wider base of team lead
ers. Buell has provided much of Stan
ford's offense this season, with 125
kills and a .416 hitting percentage.
But Buell has received help from fel
low senior David Vogel, who leads
the team in both kills (127) and digs
(91) and junior Ben Reddy. who has
124 kills this season.
"We'll give them a good match,"
Shaw said. "If they're not ready to
play us, then they might pay the
price."
Following the game tomorrow,
the Cardinal will travel to UC-Irvine
(5-8, 3-5 MPSF) to play the No. 10
Anteaters Saturday.
