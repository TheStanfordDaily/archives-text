# Golf teams swing into spring season
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last week, both the men's and
women's golf teams kicked off their
spring seasons, as the men traveled
west to Hawaii lor the Taylor Made
Waikoloa Intercollegiate and the
No. 19 women (Golfweek / Sagarin
Rankings) headed south to Palos
Verdes, Calif., for the Northrop
Grumman Regional Challenge.
Both teams competed against elite
fields; the men took eighth place
and the women finished 12th.
On a course noted for its violent
winds and tough scoring conditions,
the Stanford men's team was sur
prised to find nothing of the sort at
the par-72 6,791-yard Waikoloa Vil
lage Course last week.
"The wind can really get going
up there," head coach Conrad Ray
said. " This time it was not as much
of a factor as we thought it would
he."
The 21 teams at the event, which
included nine squads ranked in na
tion's Top 25, were more than ready
to take advantage of the friendly
conditions and turned the tourna
ment into a hirdie bonanza.
Consider this: The Cardinal's
three-day total of 831 was 33 under
par, but garnered Stanford nothing
more than an eighth-place finish. In
any of the past three years, a team
score of 33 under par would have
claimed the team title by at least 10
strokes.
"If you look at the field and the
teams we beat, it was a pretty good
showing, really," Ray said. "All in
all. I was pretty satisfied."
No. 1 Oklahoma State, with a
team score of SOI (63 under par),
won this year's team competition by
seven strokes over No. 3 Georgia
Tech. Three Cowboys found their
way into the top five individual
spots, including the event medalist,
sophomore Tyler Leon, who carded
scores of 64-66-65 en route to his
first career victory.
Stanford freshman Rob Grube
continued his stellar rookie cam
paign. firing a pair of 67s over the
first two days of the event and fin
ishing at 14-under-par 202 for the
week, good for seventh place indi
vidually. It is Grube's third top-10
performance in six events on the
year.
"Mentally it was tough to know
that making pars on the holes was
not good enough, but the team was
patient," Grube said. "Patience is a
great part of scoring well on easier
courses, because forcing the issue
results in bogeys."
Senior Pat Phillips shot a career
low 66 in the final round, propelling
himself to a total of 209 and a 37th

place finish, his best of the year. Fel
low senior Kevin Blue was just one
stroke behind Phillips at 210 and
tied for 42nd.
Junior Kyle Gentry started the
week out hot, with a four-under-par
68 in his opening round, but settled
for even par in his final two rounds
and tied for 56th individually.
Sophomore Zack Miller was just
two over par, but lost ground to the
field in the benign conditions, and
his 218 left him in 96th place overall.
The Cardinal women faced an
even tougher field this weekend in
Palos Verdes. Twelve out of the 15
teams in the Northrop were ranked
in the Top 25. headlined by No. 1
Duke, No. 2 UCLA and No. 4
Washington.
"It's great to see what we're up
against," sophomore Lauren Todd
said of the field. "It allows us to
know where we need to be by the
end of the season."
The par-71 5,912-yard Palos
Verdes Golf Club gave the best
players in the country all they could
handle. Not a single player finished
under par for the weekend.
"Palos Verdes is one of the
toughest courses we play all year,"
junior Kelly Husted said. "The
greens are small and hard to hit, and
the wind is usually strong."
Duke junior Brittany Lang won
the individual title at even par and
cleared the field by four shots. No. 6
Pepperdine claimed top team hon
ors by two strokes over the defend
ing national champions, UCLA.
Husted led the way for Stanford,
carding a three-over-par 74 in her
final round to climb the leader
board into a tie for 25th place over
all. It is Husled's fourth top-25 fin
ish in live events this year, and she is
putting together by far her best year
on the Farm.
Husted was followed by sopho
more Jenni Tangtiphaiboontana.
The team's most consistent player
during the fall season, Tangtiphai
boontana never quite got it going
last weekend, shooting scores of 76-
77-78 to finish tied for 36th.
For Todd, it was a weekend of
"what if." She played solidly in her
second and third rounds, posting
scores of 75 and 76. respectively, but
was hamstrung by a 12-over-par 83
in her opening round. She was un
able to recover from her early diffi
culties and tied for 47th place.
"Eliminating big numbers is def
initely going to be important," Todd
said. "That was certainly empha
sized by this field at such a hard golf
course."
Senior Wendra Liang finished a
shot back of Todd in 48th place,
while sophomore Jenna Seki's final
round 89 dropped her to 80th place.

paign. firing a pair of 67s over the
first two days of the event and fin
ishing at 14-under-par 202 for the
week, good for seventh place indi
vidually. It is Grube's third top-10
performance in six events on the
year.
"Mentally it was tough to know
that making pars on the holes was
not good enough, but the team was
patient," Grube said. "Patience is a
great part of scoring well on easier
courses, because forcing the issue
results in bogeys."
Senior Pat Phillips shot a career
low 66 in the final round, propelling
himself to a total of 209 and a 37th

place finish, his best of the year. Fel
low senior Kevin Blue was just one
stroke behind Phillips at 210 and
tied for 42nd.
Junior Kyle Gentry started the
week out hot, with a four-under-par
68 in his opening round, but settled
for even par in his final two rounds
and tied for 56th individually.
Sophomore Zack Miller was just
two over par, but lost ground to the
field in the benign conditions, and
his 218 left him in 96th place overall.
The Cardinal women faced an
even tougher field this weekend in
Palos Verdes. Twelve out of the 15
teams in the Northrop were ranked
in the Top 25. headlined by No. 1
Duke, No. 2 UCLA and No. 4
Washington.
"It's great to see what we're up
against," sophomore Lauren Todd
said of the field. "It allows us to
know where we need to be by the
end of the season."
The par-71 5,912-yard Palos
Verdes Golf Club gave the best
players in the country all they could
handle. Not a single player finished
under par for the weekend.
"Palos Verdes is one of the
toughest courses we play all year,"
junior Kelly Husted said. "The
greens are small and hard to hit, and
the wind is usually strong."
Duke junior Brittany Lang won
the individual title at even par and
cleared the field by four shots. No. 6
Pepperdine claimed top team hon
ors by two strokes over the defend
ing national champions, UCLA.
Husted led the way for Stanford,
carding a three-over-par 74 in her
final round to climb the leader
board into a tie for 25th place over
all. It is Husled's fourth top-25 fin
ish in live events this year, and she is
putting together by far her best year
on the Farm.
Husted was followed by sopho
more Jenni Tangtiphaiboontana.
The team's most consistent player
during the fall season, Tangtiphai
boontana never quite got it going
last weekend, shooting scores of 76-
77-78 to finish tied for 36th.
For Todd, it was a weekend of
"what if." She played solidly in her
second and third rounds, posting
scores of 75 and 76. respectively, but
was hamstrung by a 12-over-par 83
in her opening round. She was un
able to recover from her early diffi
culties and tied for 47th place.
"Eliminating big numbers is def
initely going to be important," Todd
said. "That was certainly empha
sized by this field at such a hard golf
course."
Senior Wendra Liang finished a
shot back of Todd in 48th place,
while sophomore Jenna Seki's final
round 89 dropped her to 80th place.

The women's golf team finished 1 2th at tbe Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge in a stiff field lhat included 12 top-25 teams.
Last week, both the men's and
women's golf teams kicked off their
spring seasons, as the men traveled
west to Hawaii lor the Taylor Made
Waikoloa Intercollegiate and the
No. 19 women (Golfweek / Sagarin
Rankings) headed south to Palos
Verdes, Calif., for the Northrop
Grumman Regional Challenge.
Both teams competed against elite
fields; the men took eighth place
and the women finished 12th.
On a course noted for its violent
winds and tough scoring conditions,
the Stanford men's team was sur
prised to find nothing of the sort at
the par-72 6,791-yard Waikoloa Vil
lage Course last week.
"The wind can really get going
up there," head coach Conrad Ray
said. " This time it was not as much
of a factor as we thought it would
he."
The 21 teams at the event, which
included nine squads ranked in na
tion's Top 25, were more than ready
to take advantage of the friendly
conditions and turned the tourna
ment into a hirdie bonanza.
Consider this: The Cardinal's
three-day total of 831 was 33 under
par, but garnered Stanford nothing
more than an eighth-place finish. In
any of the past three years, a team
score of 33 under par would have
claimed the team title by at least 10
strokes.
"If you look at the field and the
teams we beat, it was a pretty good
showing, really," Ray said. "All in
all. I was pretty satisfied."
No. 1 Oklahoma State, with a
team score of SOI (63 under par),
won this year's team competition by
seven strokes over No. 3 Georgia
Tech. Three Cowboys found their
way into the top five individual
spots, including the event medalist,
sophomore Tyler Leon, who carded
scores of 64-66-65 en route to his
first career victory.
