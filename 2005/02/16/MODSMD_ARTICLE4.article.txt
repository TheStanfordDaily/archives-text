# Old Union to be renovated as student hub
## 
### SARAH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
The University is planning a
$24 million renovation of Old
Union and the surrounding areas
to create a more extensive stu
dent center by increasing the
lawn space in the area, opening
up Old Union to White Plaza and
replacing the administrative of
fices that currently occupy Old
Union with spaces for student
groups.
"I think that it will greatly im
prove campus life by providing a
much more defined center of stu
dent life in the core of campus,"
said Eric Allison, a graduate stu
dent in aeronautics and astronau
tics who graduated in 2002, and a
member of the Student Activities
Space Task force. "It will provide
a signature location that people
will associate with student life
and Stanford."
The task force was created in
2002 by Gene Awakuni. vice
provost for student affairs, to
produce recommendations for
how to best manage the space in
this region of campus and in
cludes students, faculty members
and administrators.
While a timeline for the
changes hasn't yet been released,
the task force has compiled a pro
posal with five general recom
mendations for the renovation.
First, the task force proposed
the creation of a "primary event
zone" between Tresidder Memo
rial Union and the post office,
which will include an outside
stage as an extension of Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
The proposal also addressed
the need for more green space,
prompting the construction of
more efficient pathways and
open space. The task force sug
gested alleviating hike and
pedestrian traffic through White

Plaza by installing better bike
racks and linking pathways more
directly with those in the Main
Quad.
The task force also expressed
a need for improved bike paths
across campus from east to west,
to make Santa Teresa Street
more accessible. Finally, the
group recommended upgrading
the areas where students enter
White Plaza in order to make the
space look more well-defined.
The plans urge the need for
restaurants in Old Union, includ
ing food venues that will be open
late at night.
According to Laura Gold
stein. a facilities service adminis
trator. the offices inside Old
Union will also change. The reg
istrar will move to a different lo
cation. and the Offices of Finan
cial Aid and Undergraduate Ad
mission will relocate to the
Bakewell Building near the Ford
Center. The ASSU, the Office of
Religious Life and other shared
offices for student groups will re
locate to Old Union.
Both the Native American
Cultural Center and the Asian
American Activities Center in
the Old Union Clubhouse as well
as El Centro Chicano in the
Nitery will remain where they
are.
"There was a feeling from the
task force that Tresidder and Old
Union should be more connect
ed," said Cathy Blake, assistant
director of campus planning and
designing.
The idea for the renovation
was first formulated in 2002, and
the task force was immediately
created to develop recommenda
tions.
The current proposal has been
approved by the Board of
Trustees three times — most re
cently on Feb. 7 — but the plan
still needs to be approved by the

Board two more times before it
can be implemented.
According to members of the
task force, the new plan was de
signed to increase interactions
between graduate students and
undergraduates.
"1 was very interested in the
way graduate student interests
were represented in the process."
Allison said. "I wanted to think
about how graduate and under
graduate interests can be com
bined in a way that makes sense
to everyone. 1 think that one of
the most important features of
the plan is that at least part of the
space created will be somewhere
that all students can feel at
home."
Main project coordinators
said they have not heard any neg
ative reactions yet.
"So far the response has been

very positive," Awakuni said. "I
think because everyone realizes
how much potential this has to
enhance student activities and
student life on campus."
However, some students said
they questioned whether the
changes are worth the cost, effort
and disturbance of construction.
"1 don't see what the big deal
is about centralizing campus
around Old Union." said fresh
man Koji Gardiner after hearing
about the plan. "It seems like if
they're going to have food places
at Tresidder, they should have
them all in one place."
Despite his impending depar
ture, Awakuni has remained inti
mately involved with the renova
tion project since its inception.
He said his role in the plans will

not impact the search for his re
placement, adding that he is looking
forward to seeing the results, even
though he won't be at Stanford.
"The Old Union complex is a
wonderful, central, historic part of
the Stanford campus," Awakuni
said. " This renovation and the relat
ed improvements to White Plaza
and the surrounding open space
offer a terrific opportunity to make
this even more the focus of campus
life."
