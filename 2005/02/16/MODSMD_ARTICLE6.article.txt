# New group to evaluate student-group funding
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In response to student groups'
demand that reforms be made to the
way in which all funding used by stu
dent groups is distributed, the
newly-assembled Student Activities
Funding Study Group, or SAFSG,
will soon distribute a survey to those
concerned to compile a report on
student activities funding.
The committee conducting the
survey is co-chaired by junior Kory
Vargas Caro, vice president of the
ASSU, and Nanci Howe, associate
dean of students and director of stu
dent activities.
"Our group expects to have a re
port by the end of this school year
that will detail the current status of
group funding, the needs of student
groups, the challenges to student
group funding and our recommen
dations," Vargas said. "We intend to
have the survey ready and out in the
next two or three weeks. We hope
this survey will highlight the major
student group funding needs."
He added that the information
collected will also help identify the
major challenges standing in the way
of reform.
According to Vargas, the
SAFSG, comprised of administra
tors and students, was the brain child
of Dean of Students Greg Board
man and was approved by Gene
Awakuni, vice provost for student
affairs.
"I am under the impression that
this group came about in response to
the special fees crisis of last year,"
Vargas said, referring to last year's
election, in which several student

groups lost special fees funding.
Howe echoed this sentiment.
"There is interest in looking at is
sues of student funding because
many student groups have had diffi
culty receiving the level of funding
they feel they need," she said. "This
was also exacerbated by in increase
in the number of students receiving
special fee refunds last year - result
ing in less money to special fee
groups. We are not especially fo
cused 011 funding policies since there
are few policies that address student
group funding."
However, senior Josh Shipp, for
mer ASSU senate chair and member
of SAFSG, said that Boardman had
organized the group in order to eval
uate student group funding and not
student fees.
"(The group] was put together in
a climate of uncertainty regarding
ASSU fee refunds, but we're exam
ining all issues regarding how stu
dent groups get funding, which in
cludes University department fund
ing, The Stanford Fund and ASSU
Funding," Shipp said.
In a paper generated by the Har
vard Undergraduate Council in
2004, the average student activities
fee at Stanford and the University's
peer institutions is approximately
$200 per year.
Surveyed annual fees ranged
from $60 at Princeton to $540 at
Dartmouth; Stanford's fee was $90.
The report went on to point out that
Boston University, Boston College,
Brown University, Columbia, Cor
nell, Dartmouth, MIT, Northeast
ern. Princeton, Tufts and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania all required
