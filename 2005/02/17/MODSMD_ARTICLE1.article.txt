# Men start stretch run against USC
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal will begin life with
out their leading scorer, junior
guard Dan Grunfeld, against South
ern California tonight. He will he re
placed in the starting lineup by
sophomore Fred Washington, who
will get to play against his hometown
schools, USC and UCLA, after

watching
much of the
Stanford's
first meet
ings with
those teams
from the
bench.

Trent John
son after the
Cardinal's
trip to Los
Angeles a
month ago,
during which
Washington
played only
12 combined
minutes
against the
Trojans and
Bruins. He
had expected

to play significant minutes this year,
but Grunfeld beat him out for the
starting shooting guard spot.
"He told me he felt like he
couldn't do anything right," said
Johnson at the time, additionally
joking that he told Washington he
(Johnson) would "shut up" and let
Washington play his game.
"After we talked, we got things
straightened out," Washington said.
"I feel like everything's very com
fortable for me now."
This time around, Washington
will get plenty of playing time
against the Los Angeles-area
schools when the Cardinal (13-9,7-5
Pacific-10 Conference) play USC
(11-14, 3-10) on Thursday and
UCLA (13-8, 7-6) on Sunday at
Maples Pavilion.
"I'm not nervous because I
played against most of these guys in
high school," Washington said.
The sophomore will play the
small forward position, with senior
jack-of-all-trades Nick Robinson
sliding over to shooting guard to
play alongside junior Chris Hernan
dez in the backcourt. Because of his
superior ball-handling abilities and
because Johnson likes the matchup,
Robinson, regarded as the team's
best defender, will go head-to-head
with Nick Young, USC's athletic
freshman shooting guard.

who has played more minutes than any Cardi
nal reserve of late, will remain on the bench to
spell Hernandez.
At 6-foot-5, Washington has the best leap
ing ability of anyone on the team and might be
its most athletic player, but is known to play
out of control at times. Washington will have
to work through his miscues, if only because
Johnson's options are limited. The only other
shooting guard on the team, walk-on fresh
man Kenny Brown, has not seen game action,
though he might this weekend.
"Fred is going to have to work on being
more comfortable, more relaxed," Johnson
said. "He's going to have to work on slowing
down and making good decisions."
Johnson said he does not want Washington
to try to emulate Grunfeld's one-of-a-kind
game, or to worry about making up for some
of Grunfeld's 17.9 points per game. Instead,
Johnson said that he wanted Washington to
focus on the things he can control - his de
fense, rebounding and ballhandling - and let
the rest of the game come to him.
"We have to look at it in terms of the things
that we can control and do better," Johnson
said about the team as a whole. "We're not
going to have a guy who's going to step in and
have Danny's knack or step in and shoot the
ball from the perimeter [as well as Grunfeld
did]. But we've got a nucleus of guys on this
team that can step in and be better defensive
ly, and that's where we've got to step it up."
Washington will have his hands full on de
fense, matching up against Lodrick Stewart,
the Trojans' leading scorer with 13.6 points
per game and a 43 percent shooting percent
age from behind the arc.
The Cardinal will also have to find a way to
contain freshman point guard Gabriel Pruitt,
who torched Stanford for 23 points on 8-of-l 1
shooting the last time the teams met.
"They just worry me to Johnson
said, "It's pretty evident that we couldn't
guard [Pruitt] over there. They have always
caused problems for us in terms of coming
with full-court pressure, half-court pressure,
traps. They do a really good job of getting you
out of rhythm and forcing you to play a little
faster, - at least they have with us - a little
faster than we want to play."
Grunfeld scored 20 points against USC in
the teams' first meeting and will be missed not
only for his scoring touch but also for his fear
less style of play. The team will have to find a
way to keep up its intensity in Grunfeld's ab
sence. And it all starts with Washington.

who has played more minutes than any Cardi
nal reserve of late, will remain on the bench to
spell Hernandez.
At 6-foot-5, Washington has the best leap
ing ability of anyone on the team and might be
its most athletic player, but is known to play
out of control at times. Washington will have
to work through his miscues, if only because
Johnson's options are limited. The only other
shooting guard on the team, walk-on fresh
man Kenny Brown, has not seen game action,
though he might this weekend.
"Fred is going to have to work on being
more comfortable, more relaxed," Johnson
said. "He's going to have to work on slowing
down and making good decisions."
Johnson said he does not want Washington
to try to emulate Grunfeld's one-of-a-kind
game, or to worry about making up for some
of Grunfeld's 17.9 points per game. Instead,
Johnson said that he wanted Washington to
focus on the things he can control - his de
fense, rebounding and ballhandling - and let
the rest of the game come to him.
"We have to look at it in terms of the things
that we can control and do better," Johnson
said about the team as a whole. "We're not
going to have a guy who's going to step in and
have Danny's knack or step in and shoot the
ball from the perimeter [as well as Grunfeld
did]. But we've got a nucleus of guys on this
team that can step in and be better defensive
ly, and that's where we've got to step it up."
Washington will have his hands full on de
fense, matching up against Lodrick Stewart,
the Trojans' leading scorer with 13.6 points
per game and a 43 percent shooting percent
age from behind the arc.
The Cardinal will also have to find a way to
contain freshman point guard Gabriel Pruitt,
who torched Stanford for 23 points on 8-of-l 1
shooting the last time the teams met.
"They just worry me to Johnson
said, "It's pretty evident that we couldn't
guard [Pruitt] over there. They have always
caused problems for us in terms of coming
with full-court pressure, half-court pressure,
traps. They do a really good job of getting you
out of rhythm and forcing you to play a little
faster, - at least they have with us - a little
faster than we want to play."
Grunfeld scored 20 points against USC in
the teams' first meeting and will be missed not
only for his scoring touch but also for his fear
less style of play. The team will have to find a
way to keep up its intensity in Grunfeld's ab
sence. And it all starts with Washington.
The Cardinal will begin life with
out their leading scorer, junior
guard Dan Grunfeld, against South
ern California tonight. He will he re
placed in the starting lineup by
sophomore Fred Washington, who
will get to play against his hometown
schools, USC and UCLA, after
