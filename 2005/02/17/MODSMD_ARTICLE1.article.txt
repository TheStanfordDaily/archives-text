### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal will begin life with
out their leading scorer, junior
guard Dan Grunfeld, against South
ern California tonight. He will he re
placed in the starting lineup by
sophomore Fred Washington, who
will get to play against his hometown
schools, USC and UCLA, after

watching
much of the
Stanford's
first meet
ings with
those teams
from the
bench.
Wash
ington sat
down fora
talk with
head coach
Trent John
son after the
Cardinal's
trip to Los
Angeles a
month ago,
during which
Washington
played only
12 combined
minutes
against the
Trojans and
Bruins. He
had expected

to play significant minutes this year,
but Grunfeld beat him out for the
starting shooting guard spot.
"He told me he felt like he
couldn't do anything right," said
Johnson at the time, additionally
joking that he told Washington he
(Johnson) would "shut up" and let
Washington play his game.
"After we talked, we got things
straightened out," Washington said.
"I feel like everything's very com
fortable for me now."
This time around, Washington
will get plenty of playing time
against the Los Angeles-area
schools when the Cardinal (13-9,7-5
Pacific-10 Conference) play USC
(11-14, 3-10) on Thursday and
UCLA (13-8, 7-6) on Sunday at
Maples Pavilion.
"I'm not nervous because I
played against most of these guys in
high school," Washington said.
The sophomore will play the
small forward position, with senior
jack-of-all-trades Nick Robinson
sliding over to shooting guard to
play alongside junior Chris Hernan
dez in the backcourt. Because of his
superior ball-handling abilities and
because Johnson likes the matchup,
Robinson, regarded as the team's
best defender, will go head-to-head
with Nick Young, USC's athletic
freshman shooting guard.
