# GSC discusses changes to graduate housing

### FRANCIE NEUKOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
discussed last night changes to grad
uate summer housing policy and
plans fora new children's playroom
in the Graduate Community Center.
Rodger Whitney, executive di
rector of student housing, and Todd
Benson, director of housing assign
ment services, attended the meeting

to clarify the changes in housing pol
icy and get feedback from GSC
members.
Though most graduate students
are on 12-month contracts that end
in mid-August, many chose to leave
University housing at the end of
spring quarter, preferring off-cam
pus leases, Benson said.
This causes 1,500 vacancies —
about one-third of all graduate
housing spaces — and costs Resi

dential and Dining Enterprises
around $2.2 million in revenue each
year. Some of the loss is covered by
off-campus subsidized housing pro
grams, which reimburse Residen
tial and Dining Enterprises, but this
program is anticipated to end at the
conclusion of the 2006-2007 aca
demic year.
In effect, students remaining in
University housing all 12 months of
the year would be subsidizing stu

dents who leave for the summer.
With this significant loss of rev
enue, Residential and Dining En
terprises will be pressured to in
crease graduate housing rates
more than necessary. To avoid this,
they have decided to implement
new measures to encourage year
round student occupancy in cam
pus residences.
First-year graduate students and
those with priority years remaining
will receive preference in the gradu
ate housing lottery as before, but pri
ority will also be given to students
who commit to 12-month leases for
on-campus housing. This will help
ensure maximum occupancy during
the summer months.
These students may also sublet

their bed spaces during the summer
to any non-undergraduate Stanford
affiliate by signing a subletting
agreement at the Escondido Village
office.
If students cancel or move out of
their summer contract after receiv
ing priority in the lottery, their au
tumn contracts will be automatically
cancelled and they will have to reap
ply for housing after all other matric
ulated students on the waiting list
have been housed.
During the meeting, GSC mem
bers also addressed building a chil
dren's playroom in the Graduate

Community Center. When the cen
ter was first built, administrators
originally planned for the Sydney
Room on the second floor to be used
as a playroom for graduate students'
children, but adequate supplies were
not available to transform the room
appropriately.
Now GSC members want to con
vert the room back to its intended
use and plan to contribute $2.(HK) to
the cause, a donation that will be
matched by the Graduate Life Of
fice. This money will go toward buy
ing new toys, books, games and
media.
