## TIPS plans campus improvements 
### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Team to Improve Productivity at
Stanford, or TIPS, a group comprised of
Stanford faculty and staff members inter
ested in improving the general quality of
life on campus, held its monthly meeting
yesterday to spread the word about new
resources and services.
Despite its 17-year history, TIPS is not
well-known on campus.
"The group was founded in the 1980s
when the University was making the tran
sition from paper to electronic services.
We're composed mostly of administrative
staff, representing different depart
ments," explained coordinator Jane Mar
cus, an academic consultant at Informa
tion Technology Systems and Services.
"TIPS meeting attendees represent all
areas of the University," said Sandy Costa,
TIPS co-chair "They provide an excellent
forum for presenting information and get
ting feedback from administrative staff

with very diverse needs and experience."
The meeting featured presentations by
Stanford's Work Life Office, the Diversity
and Access Office and the Office of Ac
cessible Education.
Representatives talked about the mis
sions of their groups and various services
they make available to members of the
campus community.
The first speaker was Teresa Rasco, di
rector of Stanford's Work Life Office,
which deals with issues surrounding the
balance of work and home-life.
Rasco explained that the office specializes
in offering childcare, elder-care and par
ent education to faculty, students and
staff.
"One of the things we're dealing with
right now is a company morale issue at
Stanford," Rasco said. "Even though it's a
wonderful place to work, we want to make
sure that we're supported in a way that
makes it good for us to be fully engaged at
work as well as at home."
Rosa Gonzalez, director of the Diversity

and Access Office, outlined the office's mis
sion to enforce affirmative action policies
and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
"Our job involves taking snapshots and
seeing who's in our workforce and where
they are," she said. "The purpose is to
identify areas that may be a problem in
terms of why is this particular ethnic group
not being promoted?"
The meeting wrapped up with a multi
media presentation by Shelley Haven,
technology coordinator for the Office of
Accessible Education. She showed the au
dience a video clip spotlighting the prob
lems faced by blind students working with
computers and the different programs
available to help them navigate on the
web.
"We're moving more and more to
wards online activities, online web-based
forums and research." Haven said. "We're
building more virtual buildings. Just as we
do with our physical buildings, we need to
make sure that people with disabilities
have access."
