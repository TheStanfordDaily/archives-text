As she was buzzed in through the
barred doors on the seventh floor of
San Francisco County Jail, sopho
more Cammie Lee heard shouting
down the hall, an argument between
a deputy and an inmate.
She was led to a small room with
two plastic chairs, a small table and a
red emergency button on the wall.
The deputy led the large man he'd
been arguing with into the room.
"Do you want me to remove his
handcuffs?" asked the deputy. The
inmate continued to swear at him.
Lee hesitated at first, and then, won
dering how the man would write
with handcuffs on, said she thought it
would be a good idea.
The deputy removed the hand
cuffs and reminded Lee to keep the

inmate under control until he could
put the handcuffs hack on when they
were done.
'Here's this huge big guy, spew
ing curses at the deputy," Lee told
The Daily after the fact. "He's ask
ing me to do this and I'm sitting there
like 'uh huh.' little me trying to keep
him inside until he gets handcuffed
again."
At first, the inmate was uncoop
erative.
"He said 'you're not my attorney
â€” 1 thought they brought me up
here to see my attorney,' " Lee said.
"So I explained 'I'm your GED tutor
and I'm here to work on some math
problems with you."'
At first the inmate refused, but
Lee suggested he try two problems.
