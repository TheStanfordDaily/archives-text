As she was buzzed in through the
barred doors on the seventh floor of
San Francisco County Jail, sopho
more Cammie Lee heard shouting
down the hall, an argument between
a deputy and an inmate.
She was led to a small room with
two plastic chairs, a small table and a
red emergency button on the wall.
The deputy led the large man he'd
been arguing with into the room.
"Do you want me to remove his
handcuffs?" asked the deputy. The
inmate continued to swear at him.
Lee hesitated at first, and then, won
dering how the man would write
with handcuffs on, said she thought it
would be a good idea.
The deputy removed the hand
cuffs and reminded Lee to keep the

inmate under control until he could
put the handcuffs hack on when they
were done.
'Here's this huge big guy, spew
ing curses at the deputy," Lee told
The Daily after the fact. "He's ask
ing me to do this and I'm sitting there
like 'uh huh.' little me trying to keep
him inside until he gets handcuffed
again."
At first, the inmate was uncoop
erative.
"He said 'you're not my attorney
— 1 thought they brought me up
here to see my attorney,' " Lee said.
"So I explained 'I'm your GED tutor
and I'm here to work on some math
problems with you."'
At first the inmate refused, but
Lee suggested he try two problems.

Students discuss their experiences tutoring jail inmates among other incarcera
tion issues including political stances on prison reform and capital punishment.
"1 gave him some simple fractions
and he did them really quickly," she
said. "I think it built up his confi
dence."
The tutoring session continued for
an hour.
This was one of Lee's first experi
ences as a tutor with Stanford Be
yond Bars, or SBB. a new campus or
ganization she founded with two
other students.
Every week, Lee meets with her
tutee to review basic math and read
ing skills.
SBB is comprised of both gradu
ates and undergraduates committed
to addressing educational and other
issues facing inmates, Lee said.
The group organizes student volun
teers to visit the San Francisco jail
under the auspices of the Northern
California Service League, a local
non-profit, and tutor inmates for the
General Education Development, or
high school equivalency test.
SBB has also promoted debate
and discussion among students about
California's incarceration system.
Just this month. SBB was award
ed an $850 Youth Venture grant
from MTVU, a segment of MTV
that helps students initiate service
projects.
SBB's tutoring program fulfills
several roles for inmates with differ
ent needs. According to a study con
ducted by the U.S. Department of
Justice, over 41 percent of inmates in
state and federal prisons in 1997 had
not completed 12th grade or its
equivalent. In contrast, 18 percent of
the general population has not fin
ished high school.
For some at the San Francisco
County Jail, the program provides di
version for inmates whose days are
otherwise spent interacting with
other inmates and guards.
"My tutee is a career criminal in
his fifties," senior Gregory Eastman,
a tutor, said. "He is a bright individu
al that sometimes will struggle re
membering specifics of math formu
las, but is a quick learner. For him, the
tutoring seems to be more about a
chance to interact with another indi
vidual and keep his mind active
rather than to acquire skills."
Senior Nicole Miller, co-founder
of SBB, said that her tutee suffered
from an aneurism six years ago and

lost his ability to walk or speak.
Though he achieved post-secondary
education, he is now hack at the level
of a first grader, she said.
"It's really about giving confi
dence and a lot of positive reinforce
ment." Miller said. "The goal is not
the GED but to function and read in
normal society."
Re-integration into society can be
problematic for some inmates, espe
cially those with limited education,
according to members of SBB.
"If they don't get an education
and GED tutoring, they'll go right
back out and commit crimes," Lee
said.
SBB's partner organization.
Northern California Service League,
or NCSL, also focuses on the transi
tional period after leaving jail with an
eye toward reducing crime in the
long-term.
Founded by former California
Supreme Court Justice Raymond Pe
ters. the NCSL provides job develop
ment and placement, substance
abuse counseling and transitional
housing for mothers.
"I'm a product of the system,"
NCSL Director Yolanda Robinson
said. "1 promised myself when I got
out that 1 would never go back in
jail. And it's hard when you need a
job, but I've been here fifteen years
now."
The SBB program was inspired by
the work of Stanford graduate Will
Edwards, the only tutor volunteering
for NCSL when he presented his
work at the Haas Center last year.
The presentation led to continued
discussion among a small group of
students and eventually to the forma
tion of SBB.
At meetings, SBB members share
stories about their tutoring sessions,
plan upcoming speaker series and
discuss various articles related to Cal
ifornia's incarceration system and the
death penalty.
The group members also hold film
screenings, host letter writing cam
paigns and keep reflection logs about
their tutoring sessions.
While the challenges facing policy
makers, let alone students, on these
issues are daunting, there are success
es to celebrate, SBB members said.
At the last meeting, students re
joiced at the appointment of Jeanne
Woodford to be the new director of the
California Department of Corrections
by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in
2(XW.
Woodford began as a prison guard
and became San Quentin's first fe

male warden. Her focus has always
been on rehabilitation and education,
a set of priorities she now plans to
take to the state level to reduce the
number of inmates who return to
crime after their release.
Lee said many people question
why she decided to tutor criminals
specifically.
"You have to be careful not to be
come- too partial, especially when
you're serving them, helping them
out." she said. "Maybe it's human na
ture to think of them as disadvan
taged. Yes, the situations they've
come from might be horrible, but
they've also done horrible acts."
Opinions on this issue vary among
tutors.
"I wanted to tutor with SBB," ex
plained Smith, "because the people
who end up in jail are overwhelming
ly people who have lived their lives in
very unfavorable circumstances, cir
cumstances over which they had little
or no control."
Tutoring, Smith added, will pro
vide inmates with intellectual tools
that can improve their situations.
Most tutors had never been to a
jail before but said they never felt
threatened in any way during their tu
toring hours.
"I was surprised at the hypocrisy
in the security," Eastman said. "It
was very intimidating going through
several locked gates with heavy iron
bars."
On the seventh floor of the jail,
students work with the "maximums,"
or those inmates with the highest de
gree offenses.
Smith said that he does not ask
about what his tutee did to end up in
jail. He said that his attitude is in
keeping with general SBB policy,
which encourages tutors to stay fo
cused on their curriculum, rather
than their tutees' lives because the tu
tors are not trained counselors.
"People always ask me what my
tutee did to get put in jail," Smith
said. "If he's a violent criminal, a
rapist or a murderer, how can 1 work
with him? My feeling is that what a
person has already done matters less
in determining how we should treat
them than what they are now doing
or trying to do."
Smith added that even though the
penal system takes a very difference
stance on the issue, the SBB effort is
about delivering the service to the
people who want help.
"It is easy to see that people who
have done some very bad things may
actually need the most help," he said.

who end up in jail are overwhelming
ly people who have lived their lives in
very unfavorable circumstances, cir
cumstances over which they had little

Tutoring, Smith added, will pro

Most tutors had never been to a

"I was surprised at the hypocrisy
in the security," Eastman said. "It
was very intimidating going through
several locked gates with heavy iron
bars."
On the seventh floor of the jail,
students work with the "maximums,"
or those inmates with the highest de

Smith said that he does not ask
about what his tutee did to end up in
jail. He said that his attitude is in
keeping with general SBB policy,
which encourages tutors to stay fo
cused on their curriculum, rather
than their tutees' lives because the tu
tors are not trained counselors.
"People always ask me what my
tutee did to get put in jail," Smith
said. "If he's a violent criminal, a
rapist or a murderer, how can 1 work
with him? My feeling is that what a
person has already done matters less
in determining how we should treat
them than what they are now doing
or trying to do."
Smith added that even though the
penal system takes a very difference
stance on the issue, the SBB effort is
about delivering the service to the
people who want help.
"It is easy to see that people who
have done some very bad things may
actually need the most help," he said.
As she was buzzed in through the
barred doors on the seventh floor of
San Francisco County Jail, sopho
more Cammie Lee heard shouting
down the hall, an argument between
a deputy and an inmate.
She was led to a small room with
two plastic chairs, a small table and a
red emergency button on the wall.
The deputy led the large man he'd
been arguing with into the room.
"Do you want me to remove his
handcuffs?" asked the deputy. The
inmate continued to swear at him.
Lee hesitated at first, and then, won
dering how the man would write
with handcuffs on, said she thought it
would be a good idea.
The deputy removed the hand
cuffs and reminded Lee to keep the

inmate under control until he could
put the handcuffs hack on when they
were done.
'Here's this huge big guy, spew
ing curses at the deputy," Lee told
The Daily after the fact. "He's ask

like 'uh huh.' little me trying to keep
him inside until he gets handcuffed
again."
At first, the inmate was uncoop

"He said 'you're not my attorney
— 1 thought they brought me up
here to see my attorney,' " Lee said.
"So I explained 'I'm your GED tutor
and I'm here to work on some math
problems with you."'
At first the inmate refused, but
Lee suggested he try two problems.

General Education Development, or
high school equivalency test.
SBB has also promoted debate
and discussion among students about
California's incarceration system.
Just this month. SBB was award
ed an $850 Youth Venture grant
from MTVU, a segment of MTV
that helps students initiate service
projects.
SBB's tutoring program fulfills
several roles for inmates with differ
ent needs. According to a study con
ducted by the U.S. Department of
Justice, over 41 percent of inmates in
state and federal prisons in 1997 had
not completed 12th grade or its
equivalent. In contrast, 18 percent of
the general population has not fin

At the last meeting, students re
joiced at the appointment of Jeanne
Woodford to be the new director of the
California Department of Corrections
by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in
2(XW.
Woodford began as a prison guard
and became San Quentin's first fe

male warden. Her focus has always
been on rehabilitation and education,
a set of priorities she now plans to
take to the state level to reduce the
number of inmates who return to
crime after their release.
Lee said many people question
why she decided to tutor criminals
specifically.
"You have to be careful not to be
come- too partial, especially when
you're serving them, helping them
out." she said. "Maybe it's human na
ture to think of them as disadvan
taged. Yes, the situations they've
come from might be horrible, but
they've also done horrible acts."

work at the Haas Center last year.
The presentation led to continued
discussion among a small group of
students and eventually to the forma
tion of SBB.
At meetings, SBB members share
stories about their tutoring sessions,
plan upcoming speaker series and
discuss various articles related to Cal
ifornia's incarceration system and the
death penalty.
The group members also hold film
screenings, host letter writing cam
paigns and keep reflection logs about
their tutoring sessions.
While the challenges facing policy
makers, let alone students, on these
issues are daunting, there are success
es to celebrate, SBB members said.
At the last meeting, students re
joiced at the appointment of Jeanne
Woodford to be the new director of the
California Department of Corrections
by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in
2(XW.
Woodford began as a prison guard
and became San Quentin's first fe

male warden. Her focus has always
been on rehabilitation and education,
a set of priorities she now plans to
take to the state level to reduce the
number of inmates who return to
crime after their release.
Lee said many people question
why she decided to tutor criminals
specifically.
"You have to be careful not to be
come- too partial, especially when
you're serving them, helping them
out." she said. "Maybe it's human na
ture to think of them as disadvan
taged. Yes, the situations they've
come from might be horrible, but
they've also done horrible acts."
Opinions on this issue vary among
tutors.
"I wanted to tutor with SBB," ex
plained Smith, "because the people
who end up in jail are overwhelming
ly people who have lived their lives in
very unfavorable circumstances, cir
cumstances over which they had little
or no control."
Tutoring, Smith added, will pro
vide inmates with intellectual tools
that can improve their situations.
Most tutors had never been to a
jail before but said they never felt
threatened in any way during their tu
toring hours.
"I was surprised at the hypocrisy
in the security," Eastman said. "It
was very intimidating going through
several locked gates with heavy iron
bars."
On the seventh floor of the jail,
students work with the "maximums,"
or those inmates with the highest de
gree offenses.
Smith said that he does not ask
about what his tutee did to end up in
jail. He said that his attitude is in
keeping with general SBB policy,
which encourages tutors to stay fo
cused on their curriculum, rather
than their tutees' lives because the tu
tors are not trained counselors.
"People always ask me what my
tutee did to get put in jail," Smith
said. "If he's a violent criminal, a
rapist or a murderer, how can 1 work
with him? My feeling is that what a
person has already done matters less
in determining how we should treat
them than what they are now doing
or trying to do."
Smith added that even though the
penal system takes a very difference
stance on the issue, the SBB effort is
about delivering the service to the
people who want help.
"It is easy to see that people who
have done some very bad things may
actually need the most help," he said.
As she was buzzed in through the
barred doors on the seventh floor of
San Francisco County Jail, sopho
more Cammie Lee heard shouting
down the hall, an argument between
a deputy and an inmate.
She was led to a small room with
two plastic chairs, a small table and a
red emergency button on the wall.
The deputy led the large man he'd
been arguing with into the room.
"Do you want me to remove his
handcuffs?" asked the deputy. The
inmate continued to swear at him.
Lee hesitated at first, and then, won
dering how the man would write
with handcuffs on, said she thought it
would be a good idea.
The deputy removed the hand
cuffs and reminded Lee to keep the

inmate under control until he could
put the handcuffs hack on when they
were done.
'Here's this huge big guy, spew
ing curses at the deputy," Lee told
The Daily after the fact. "He's ask
ing me to do this and I'm sitting there
like 'uh huh.' little me trying to keep
him inside until he gets handcuffed
again."
At first, the inmate was uncoop
erative.
"He said 'you're not my attorney
— 1 thought they brought me up
here to see my attorney,' " Lee said.
"So I explained 'I'm your GED tutor
and I'm here to work on some math
problems with you."'
At first the inmate refused, but
Lee suggested he try two problems.

Students discuss their experiences tutoring jail inmates among other incarcera
tion issues including political stances on prison reform and capital punishment.
"1 gave him some simple fractions
and he did them really quickly," she
said. "I think it built up his confi
dence."
The tutoring session continued for
an hour.
This was one of Lee's first experi
ences as a tutor with Stanford Be
yond Bars, or SBB. a new campus or
ganization she founded with two
other students.
Every week, Lee meets with her
tutee to review basic math and read
ing skills.
SBB is comprised of both gradu
ates and undergraduates committed
to addressing educational and other
issues facing inmates, Lee said.
The group organizes student volun
teers to visit the San Francisco jail
under the auspices of the Northern
California Service League, a local
non-profit, and tutor inmates for the
General Education Development, or
high school equivalency test.
SBB has also promoted debate
and discussion among students about
California's incarceration system.
Just this month. SBB was award
ed an $850 Youth Venture grant
from MTVU, a segment of MTV
that helps students initiate service
projects.
SBB's tutoring program fulfills
several roles for inmates with differ
ent needs. According to a study con
ducted by the U.S. Department of
Justice, over 41 percent of inmates in
state and federal prisons in 1997 had
not completed 12th grade or its
equivalent. In contrast, 18 percent of
the general population has not fin
ished high school.
For some at the San Francisco
County Jail, the program provides di
version for inmates whose days are
otherwise spent interacting with
other inmates and guards.
"My tutee is a career criminal in
his fifties," senior Gregory Eastman,
a tutor, said. "He is a bright individu
al that sometimes will struggle re
membering specifics of math formu
las, but is a quick learner. For him, the
tutoring seems to be more about a
chance to interact with another indi
vidual and keep his mind active
rather than to acquire skills."
Senior Nicole Miller, co-founder
of SBB, said that her tutee suffered
from an aneurism six years ago and

lost his ability to walk or speak.
Though he achieved post-secondary
education, he is now hack at the level
of a first grader, she said.
"It's really about giving confi
dence and a lot of positive reinforce
ment." Miller said. "The goal is not
the GED but to function and read in
normal society."
Re-integration into society can be
problematic for some inmates, espe
cially those with limited education,
according to members of SBB.
"If they don't get an education
and GED tutoring, they'll go right
back out and commit crimes," Lee
said.
SBB's partner organization.
Northern California Service League,
or NCSL, also focuses on the transi
tional period after leaving jail with an
eye toward reducing crime in the
long-term.
Founded by former California
Supreme Court Justice Raymond Pe
ters. the NCSL provides job develop
ment and placement, substance
abuse counseling and transitional
housing for mothers.
"I'm a product of the system,"
NCSL Director Yolanda Robinson
said. "1 promised myself when I got
out that 1 would never go back in
jail. And it's hard when you need a
job, but I've been here fifteen years
now."
The SBB program was inspired by
the work of Stanford graduate Will
Edwards, the only tutor volunteering
for NCSL when he presented his
work at the Haas Center last year.
The presentation led to continued
discussion among a small group of
students and eventually to the forma
tion of SBB.
At meetings, SBB members share
stories about their tutoring sessions,
plan upcoming speaker series and
discuss various articles related to Cal
ifornia's incarceration system and the
death penalty.
The group members also hold film
screenings, host letter writing cam
paigns and keep reflection logs about
their tutoring sessions.
While the challenges facing policy
makers, let alone students, on these
issues are daunting, there are success
es to celebrate, SBB members said.
