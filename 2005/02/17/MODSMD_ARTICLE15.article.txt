On Feb. 17, 1925, The Daily covered the visit of three Ox
ford debaters who apparently had plenty to say about the
Stanford campus. Below is an excerpt:
"Probably few of the universities visited by the
three Oxford debaters during their tour of America
were quite prepared for exactly what they found in the
Oxford men, both on the platform and off. The radi
cally different approaches that the debaters found to
questions that are considered almost daily in this coun
try started new lines of thought among many who were
privileged for the first time to view some actual English
education in action.
"Take the fraternity problem, for example. It is a
much debated question here, and yet everyone will
agree that there is much to be said for fraternities. But
the thfee Englishmen were unanimous in condemning
them. J. D. Woodruff, the leader of the Oxford team, ex
pressed their idea when he said "The college fraternities
seem to exist to force their members into a mould. The
pressure on the individual is tremendous. Every tangent
and every angle that would make him stand out as an in
dividual is removed. One fraternity man told me that
they took in only the boys who gave promise of doing
something big.' That to me seems appalling. It implies a

scramble fora certain sort of success that crowds out
some of the finest values of living.'
"They enjoyed contrasting the American plan of univer
sity with that of Oxford. 'There is genial tolerance at Ox
ford,' said Woodruff, 'for students who would rather talk
than work. American colleges are over-organized, and stu
dents are too earnest for high scholarship. It is a great mis
take to do everything too well. There are many things that,
although they are worth doing, are not worth doing well.'
"M. C. Hollis, another member of the team, be
lieves that American education 'hinders freedom and
spontaneity. You work so hard you get all tired. Few
persons have a taste for scholarship, which is no more
importance in itself than a taste for doughnuts or cab
bage. It is a mistake fora college to try to force edu
cation on a student.'
"The most striking thing about the conversation of the
Oxford men was their general culture. Probably it would be
difficult to find vie men on the Stanford campus, faculty in
cluded, who had the same degree of broad knowledge as
Hollis, Woodruff and Macdonald. They could talk with
equal facility about Herbert Spencer, 'Ben-Hur,' or the
French military railroad across Africa. And on all subjects
they would have something worth while to say.
"Another particularly distinguishable thing about
the Englishmen, with the exception of Macdonald
again, was their careless disregard for their appear
ance. Woodruff continually pushed his hair full over
his face, with little care whether he gets it back where
it should be or not. Neither Hollis nor Woodruff were
disturbed in the least when they walked in to a dinner
party where everyone dressed formally and they wore
suits that had passed the margin of utility several
months before. Mac Donald was not so. He dressed
well and always looked what Americans would term
appropriate to the occasion."
