## 
### LI TAO 
Twenty-live members of the Contemporary Collec
tors' Circle, or CCC, of the Cantor Center for the Visu
al Arts traveled to New York last weekend for the
opening of Christo and his wife Jean-Claude's "The
Gates," a temporary work of art on exhibit in Manhat
tan's Central Park for just two weeks.
The project consists of 7.5(H) vinyl gates — from
which saffron orange-colored fabric hangs — that line
the walkways of the park.
The CCC. led by Program Coordinator Ruth Got
tlieb and Membership Chair Ruth Halperin, Class of
1447, left for New York last Wednesday and returned
Tuesday night.
Halperin said that members of the CCC appreciated
the work because it obviously took many years to turn
the idea for the piece into a reality.
During the short visit, members explored the newly
lined pathways of Central Park. In addition to "The
Gates," members visited museums such as the newly
renovated Museum of Modern Art.
"If the artist says it's art, it's art," Halperin said in re
sponse to critics who question the artistic merit of "The

Gates." "Who am I lo say yes or no?"
She added that many passersby stopped to look at
the Hags and gathered to talk to each other.
"It brought people together in a wonderful way,"
Halperin said.
The CCC is a membership group that supports the
contemporary art program at the museum, said Mona
Duggan, associate director.
Among other activities, the CCC plans various pro
grams and trips for its members.
In addition to "The Gates," the CCC has visited
other Christo projects including "The Umbrellas" and
"Running Fence."
Javacheffs work often involves large-scale land
scapes. "The Umbrellas" and "Running Fence" were
no exception, involving massive structures temporarily
erected along several California freeways.
Before the display of "The Umbrellas," the museum
sponsored a summer show in which Christo was one of
the participants.
The CCC is organizing a trip to Spain and London
this fall. The group will visit new museums and exhibi
tions in London and Madrid. Also planned is a trip to
China to view contemporary art.
