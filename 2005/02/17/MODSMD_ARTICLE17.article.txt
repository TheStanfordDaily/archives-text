# Bush increases Pell Grants by $500
## Maximum grant will be $4,550 by 2010, a 12 percent rise 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
To ease the shock of climbing tu
itions, President George W. Bush
announced Monday his plan to raise
the maximum Pell Grant award by
$500 over the next live years. In
front of a crowd of more than 1,500
Florida Community College stu
dents listening, Bush promised to
work with Congress to make the
"Pell Grants work better" and to fix
a persistent shortfall in the nation's
chief college aid program.
His plan would put the maximum
grant at $4,550 by 2010, up 12 per
cent from the $4,050 offered today.
"We need to reform student
loans and make getting them more
effective," Bush said. "We have a
$4.3 billion shortfall in the Pell grant.
We need to close that deficit."
Pell Grants, the government's
largest form of financial aid. help
low-income students afford col
lege. An estimated two million
students, or about one-third of
all community college students
receive Pell Grants. The grants
range from $400 to $4,050. de
pending on students' financial
need, their cost to attend school
and whether they are enrolled
part-time or full-time.
Stanford Economics Prof. Roger
Noll said the president's move was a
band-aid rather than a remedy to the
struggling grant program.

"The Pell Grant program has
been a very popular program for
many years, but has been declining
in its effect because of rising tuition
and inflation," Noll said. "The real
question is what would it take to re
turn it to what it was 10 years ago,
and what is proposed is not going to
be sufficient."
Even if the grants are increased
by $ 1 (K) a year, per student, this will
be insufficient to cover even the av
erage three percent inflation rate, he
explained.
In addition, tuition has been ris
ing steadily. In 2004, the average in
state tuition at public, four-year col
leges rose 10.5 percent from 2(X)3
rates to $5,132, according to the Col
lege Board.
At a high-tuition school like Stan
ford. where tuition is upwards of
$31,(XX) and rising, the president's
plan is expected to make little differ
ence for students.
"The additional $500 per recipi
ent really won't make much of a
difference since we've already
committed to meet full need," said
Karen Cooper, director of financial
aid. "For the individual recipients,
it will mean that an additional $500
of their funding will come from the
federal government rather than
Stanford but it won't have an im
pact on the bottom line in the ma
jority of cases."
Senior Alice Brathwaite, a recip
ient of a Pell Grant agreed that $1(X)
a year is not significant change for
her.
"An extra $ 1 (X) wouldn't change
my world or anything," Brathwaite
said. "But it is definitely not a bad
thing."
While $500 for each recipient

may seem insignificant, the accu
mulated cost is more than the na
tional budget can absorb according
Bush's budget proposal. As a re
sult, Bush plans to reduce or elimi
nate the Perkins Loan Program,
which loans tuition money —
rather than grant it — to a broader
category of students.
During the 2003-2004 academic
year, over 3,000 Stanford students
borrowed $11.9 million from the
Perkins Loan program, a no-interest
federal program, to cover education
al costs. Most undergraduate stu
dents will be able to borrow from the
federal Stafford Loan program in
stead, but unlike the Perkins Loan
program, the Stafford Loan pro
gram charges interest although at a
subsidized rate.
However, graduate students
who tend to borrow from both pro
grams will be forced to even less-fa
vorable private loans as their only
alternative.
"Imagine the master's candidate
that is not getting funding from their
department. They typically take the
maximum $6,(HK) from Perkins and
$12,(XX) from Stafford. Even if they
increase the maximum of Perkins,
there is still a big difference," said
Cooper. "I think a much bigger dif
ference than the $S(X) for the under
graduate."
The president's plan is seen as a
message to lower-class families that
the administration has a commit
ment to higher-education rather
than real economic policy change,
Noll said.
"Even $ 1(H) a year is something
though. Take what you can get," he
added. "Don't let the best be the
enemy of the good."
