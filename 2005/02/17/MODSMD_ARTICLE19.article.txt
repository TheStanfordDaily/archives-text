## An Idiot's Guide to Bush's Healthcare Reforms 
### 
"Very impressive." That's what President
George W. Bush said on January 27 after doctors at
the Cleveland Clinic demonstrated some of the new
technology they are developing to promote infor
mation technology in the medical field.
According to Bush, computerizing medical
records would save money and lives and, despite
the massive national deficit, he has allotted $125
million toward the cause in his recently released
budget proposal.
Bush has also pushed fora cap of $250,000 on
pain-and-suffering compensation for medical mal
practice. All this in the hopes of improving the
American medical system and lowering the cost of
healthcare in upcoming years.
Now I'll admit that when it comes to all things po
litical, I'm no expert. So all the recent news about
Bush's healthcare reforms, budget cuts. Medicare
prescription drug benefits and medical technology
initiatives left me more than a little bit confused.
That's why I decided to do a little reading on the
subject and share my findings with any of you who
might also find it just a little bewildering. After
reading a slew of newspaper articles and govern
ment public information. I present the situation, at
least so far as I have come to understand it:

At around $1.6 trillion, our
domestic health expenditures
are enormous, but the system
is less than ideal. According to
the non-partisan research in
stitution Alliance for Health
Reform, 45 million Americans
are uninsured, and the num
ber of those without coverage
is increasing at a rate of
100,000 people a month.
Another research group.
The Institute of Medicine, says

the lack of coverage is respon
sible for the deaths of 18,000 people each year.
Obviously, something has to be done.
In hopes of doing something, Bush pushed for
the Medicare Prescription Drug Act in 2003, which
would provide prescription drug coverage to se
niors and the disabled beginning in 2006.
Unfortunately, last week's budget proposal put
a price tag on the program of a whopping $720 bil
lion over 10 years — and that's just the low esti
mate. Congress initially passed the act based on a
cost estimate of only $400 billion over 10 years.
Medicare oversees the largest healthcare pro
grams in the world and already consumes $500 bil
lion of federal spending annually. The current issue
of Stanford Medicine Magazine features an inter
view with Dr. Mark McClellan on the state of
healthcare in America. McClellan, an associate
professor of economics and medicine at Stanford
and Medicare's chief administrator, said that Medi
care will only be sustainable if major changes are
made to make the system more efficient, preven
tion-oriented and affordable.
Those of you who have been reading very close
ly may have noticed that these healthcare provi
sions will do nothing to help the massive federal
deficit, projected to reach a record $427 billion this
year. As the 76 million baby-boomers enter retire
ment age, the expansion of Medicare could draw on
resources that Bush would also need to make tax
cuts permanent and overhaul Social Security.
In a document released five days after the bud
get proposal was released, the president detailed
his proposed cuts and reductions in spending. Much
of them were in the areas of education, health and
law enforcement. Beyond the Medicaid reductions
that were officially listed in the budget, the Bush ad
ministration plans to cut over $1 billion more from
healthcare spending. Perhaps in his zeal to provide
full drug coverage to seniors. Bush has lost sight of
the bigger picture of health and well-being in this
country.
While the president's proposed cuts would only
reduce the deficit by about 5 percent, the budget
does not include allowances for raising taxes or
abolishing the tax cuts that were implemented dur
ing the president's last term.
I don't want to say that tax cuts that favor the
wealthy or benefits for special interest groups are
more important to the president than education or
health issues — but doesn't it look a little bit like that?
On top of this. Bush's budget does not include
the gargantuan costs of the Iraq war. To date, about
$220 billion have been spent on the war and the
president has requested an additional $80 billion.
This makes me think that maybe we could afford
to provide Medicare prescription drug benefits,
medical information technology and quality health
care for all Americans, and even feed and vaccinate
several developing countries while we're at it.
Maybe the problem is not a lack of money, but
rather a misplaced sense of priorities, with health
being stomped down into the cracks by the power
ful boots of military spending.
Now please don't write a dozen letters to the ed
itor arguing about the ethics of the war in Iraq. I'm
just sharing some potential factors to consider in
tackling the healthcare situation. Make of them
what you will.
So that's what I can make out from all the eco
nomic/political inumbo-jumbo. I think what it basi
cally comes down to is that our healthcare system is
failing us and the poor economy is making the prob
lem worse, but I'm not really sure what should be
done about it.
Like most Americans. I'm just waiting for the
day when the goals put forth by the Bush adminis
tration and many prior administrations — to pro
vide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare
to everyone — become a reality.
Now that would be very impressive.

system ranks 37th in the world (between Costa Rica

to provide Medicare prescription drug benefits,
medical information technology and quality health
care for all Americans, and even feed and vaccinate
several developing countries while we're at it.
Maybe the problem is not a lack of money, but
rather a misplaced sense of priorities, with health
being stomped down into the cracks by the power
ful boots of military spending.
Now please don't write a dozen letters to the ed
itor arguing about the ethics of the war in Iraq. I'm
just sharing some potential factors to consider in
tackling the healthcare situation. Make of them
what you will.
So that's what I can make out from all the eco
nomic/political inumbo-jumbo. I think what it basi
cally comes down to is that our healthcare system is
failing us and the poor economy is making the prob
lem worse, but I'm not really sure what should be
done about it.
Like most Americans. I'm just waiting for the
day when the goals put forth by the Bush adminis
tration and many prior administrations — to pro
vide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare
to everyone — become a reality.
Now that would be very impressive.

"Very impressive." That's what President
George W. Bush said on January 27 after doctors at
the Cleveland Clinic demonstrated some of the new
technology they are developing to promote infor
mation technology in the medical field.
According to Bush, computerizing medical
records would save money and lives and, despite
the massive national deficit, he has allotted $125
million toward the cause in his recently released
budget proposal.
Bush has also pushed fora cap of $250,000 on
pain-and-suffering compensation for medical mal
practice. All this in the hopes of improving the
American medical system and lowering the cost of
healthcare in upcoming years.
Now I'll admit that when it comes to all things po
litical, I'm no expert. So all the recent news about
Bush's healthcare reforms, budget cuts. Medicare
prescription drug benefits and medical technology
initiatives left me more than a little bit confused.
That's why I decided to do a little reading on the
subject and share my findings with any of you who
might also find it just a little bewildering. After
reading a slew of newspaper articles and govern
ment public information. I present the situation, at
least so far as I have come to understand it:

At around $1.6 trillion, our
domestic health expenditures
are enormous, but the system
is less than ideal. According to
the non-partisan research in
stitution Alliance for Health
Reform, 45 million Americans
are uninsured, and the num
ber of those without coverage
is increasing at a rate of
100,000 people a month.
Another research group.
The Institute of Medicine, says

the lack of coverage is respon
sible for the deaths of 18,000 people each year.
Obviously, something has to be done.
In hopes of doing something, Bush pushed for
the Medicare Prescription Drug Act in 2003, which
would provide prescription drug coverage to se
niors and the disabled beginning in 2006.
Unfortunately, last week's budget proposal put
a price tag on the program of a whopping $720 bil
lion over 10 years — and that's just the low esti
mate. Congress initially passed the act based on a
cost estimate of only $400 billion over 10 years.
Medicare oversees the largest healthcare pro
grams in the world and already consumes $500 bil
lion of federal spending annually. The current issue
of Stanford Medicine Magazine features an inter
view with Dr. Mark McClellan on the state of
healthcare in America. McClellan, an associate
professor of economics and medicine at Stanford
and Medicare's chief administrator, said that Medi
care will only be sustainable if major changes are
made to make the system more efficient, preven
tion-oriented and affordable.
Those of you who have been reading very close
ly may have noticed that these healthcare provi
sions will do nothing to help the massive federal
deficit, projected to reach a record $427 billion this
year. As the 76 million baby-boomers enter retire
ment age, the expansion of Medicare could draw on
resources that Bush would also need to make tax
cuts permanent and overhaul Social Security.
In a document released five days after the bud
get proposal was released, the president detailed
his proposed cuts and reductions in spending. Much
of them were in the areas of education, health and
law enforcement. Beyond the Medicaid reductions
that were officially listed in the budget, the Bush ad
ministration plans to cut over $1 billion more from
healthcare spending. Perhaps in his zeal to provide
full drug coverage to seniors. Bush has lost sight of
the bigger picture of health and well-being in this
country.
While the president's proposed cuts would only
reduce the deficit by about 5 percent, the budget
does not include allowances for raising taxes or
abolishing the tax cuts that were implemented dur
ing the president's last term.
I don't want to say that tax cuts that favor the
wealthy or benefits for special interest groups are
more important to the president than education or
health issues — but doesn't it look a little bit like that?
On top of this. Bush's budget does not include
the gargantuan costs of the Iraq war. To date, about
$220 billion have been spent on the war and the
president has requested an additional $80 billion.
This makes me think that maybe we could afford
to provide Medicare prescription drug benefits,
medical information technology and quality health
care for all Americans, and even feed and vaccinate
several developing countries while we're at it.
