# Redshirt Bodensteiner still a baller
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Most basketball players (or ath
letes in any sport) will tell you that all
the hard work and training they en
dure is more than worth it when they
step out on the court and perform to
the highest level in real competition.
Hundreds of 94-foot sprints and
shooting drills are a pleasure in ret
rospect when the game-winning shot
hits nothing but net.
But what if there were no game
day?
What if you went from practice
and the weight room on Monday, to
practice on Tuesday, to full practice
and an individual workout on
Wednesday? You'd be junior Clare
Bodensteiner, redshirting for the
No. 4 Stanford women's basketball
team.
Thursday: gameday. But not for
Bodensteiner. She shows up to the
arena at 11 a.m. for extra shooting
and stays to shoot around with the
rest of the team until 1 or 2 p.m.
On the road, the rest of the team
heads back to the hotel after
shootaround. Bodensteiner? She
hits the gym fora little extra condi
tioning.
After cheering her teammates on
to another victory Thursday night,
Friday means travel and another
workout. Saturday would be another
"gameday," but Bodensteiner has
extra shooting and workout again.
She travels home with her team Sat
urday night and has earned her day
off for the week on Sunday.
Wasn't it just Monday?
After watching the former all
state high school player spend her
first two years behind a host of tal
ented guards, head coach Tara Van-
Derveer approached Bodensteiner
about taking her junior year off to
get stronger and prepare for the de
parture of two senior starters at her
position. She would be Van-
Derveer's first non-injury redshirt in
19 years at Stanford.
"Tara talked to me about it last
spring, so I had spring, summer and
fall to think about it," Bodensteiner
said. "Looking at things, we have a
lot of guards; [guard Susan King
Borchardt] decided to come back for

her senior year; and 1 can do a lot of
things with my fifth year academical
ly, so that had a lot of influence on
whether I wanted to stay [fora fifth
year] or not."
On a team that exudes unselfish
ness, Bodensteiner may be the most
shining example. To wit, her own
willingness to help the Stanford pro
gram has been instrumental in mov
ing her down the depth chart.

"Clare sees the big picture," Van-
Derveer said. "She was hostess [dur
ing recruitment] for [freshman] Can
dice [Wiggins], hostess for [fresh
man[ Cissy [Pierce] and she was talk
ing to Susan about coming back, and
those three people play ahead of her.
She is an incredibly unselfish young
lady."
Yet, characteristically, Boden
steiner tells it as if she's getting the

best of this deal.
"My whole job the whole year is
just to work hard in practice, and
anybody can do that," Bodensteiner
said. "I've got it easy this year. The
last two years, I'm sitting there in the
game, wondering 'When am I going
to go in?' 'Am I going to go in?' Just
sitting back and seeing things from a
different perspective has been great,
and I'll get an extra spring and fall
that the ordinary student-athlete
wouldn't have."
As Bodensteiner has discovered,
however, a redshirt year brings chal
lenges of its own. While she practices
dribbling with medicine balls and
sweats through an extra set of sit
ups, her teammates answer ques
tions about the road to the Final
Four.
Removed from the spotlight of a
top-five team, Bodensteiner's hours
of work will go unnoticed by all but
her teammates until she steps on the
court next fall.
"One of the most challenging
things about being a redshirt is that
you can become anonymous, be
cause you're never going to get in the
game," said Beth Burns, the team's
strength coach and Bodensteiner's
near-constant companion in her year
of training. "Clare's never going to
be anonymous. You can see the re
spect she garners from everybody
and the energy that she brings."
Think a redshirt can't make an
impact on gameday? Watch the Car
dinal at Maples Pavilion and wait for
the media timeouts. Ask for your
money back if Bodensteiner isn't the
first one to start slapping high-fives,
get up on her feet and run out on the
court like her folding chair is on fire.
Sophomore Brooke Smith, Bo
densteiner's roommate, remembers
her NCAA-mandated redshirt last
season after transferring from Duke.
"Probably right about now is
where it seems like, 'Okay, it was
fun, let's move on, 1 want to play
now,"' Smith said. "But she does
whatever she's doing with all her en
thusiasm, and she knows what she's
putting this year in for."
Meanwhile, Bodensteiner is dis
covering the joys —or pains —of
