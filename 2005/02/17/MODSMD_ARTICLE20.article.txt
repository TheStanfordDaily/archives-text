# So You Want to be Pre-Med...
## 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's something many of us have considered
pursuing at some point in our lives. We
played Operation as children. We pre
tended to be doctors and took care of our
"sick" parents, pets and siblings. We want
ed to be physicians and came to Stanford
with the intent of being pre-med.
It is rumored that approximately 40 to
50 percent of each entering freshman class
plans on following the pre-med track at
Stanford, but that this number declines
steadily as students near graduation; how
ever, no formal statistics exist. The fact is
that being a pre-med at Stanford is quite
different from being a pre-med at many
other schools.
At Stanford, there is no established
pre-medical program and students never
officially declare their pre-med status. In
stead, the "program" is a list of suggested
courses that most medical schools require.
To help get the most out of such a set-up,
pre-med students are offered assistance
through the Stanford Pre-Medical Associ
ation, or SPA, which is affiliated with the
Undergraduate Advising Program.
If you are pre-med, the SPA may be
your one-stop shop for all things related to
the pre-med experience at Stanford. The
pre-med curriculum can be a difficult one
to navigate, but the SPA will help you out
by telling you which courses you should be
taking. If you're considering overseas
studies or summer school, the SPA will
also give you advice on how to time your
studies and what courses to take.
If you have one medical school in mind,
the SPA can connect you to it. The associ
ation puts you in touch with Stanford
alumni who are willing to talk about their
pre-med and medical-school experiences.
If you want more facts and statistics, the
SPA also has a statistical summary of Stan
ford students who have applied to medical
school in past years. This information in

eludes the number of students who applied
and how many were accepted or rejected
from each individual institution.
All this is in addition to the SPA's re
sources on a wide variety of special oppor
tunities and programs that will give you ex
posure to the fields of health and medicine.
If you're looking fora pre-med summer
school program or a research opportunity
in the Bay area, the SPA is the first place
you should look.
Looking at the pre-med path through
the eyes of three current Stanford stu
dents—one just starting out, one in the
middle and one at the end of the track—
shows the diversity of experiences that stu
dents have in their journeys to become
physicians.
As a freshman who is just in the middle
of her second quarter at Stanford, Nada
Boutros says she is more than a little over-

whelmed. Planning to
major in Human Biolo
gy, Boutros says she al
ready sees obstacles in
front of her.
"There is so much com-

petition here," Boutros said. "People who
come to Stanford as pre-meds are so in
tense. They're intense in terms of classes,
in terms of extracurriculars, in terms of ev
erything."
"They put a lot of pressure on them
selves, and if you don't immediately put
pressure on yourself, you freak out be
cause of the other people around you," she
added.
Fellow freshman Julie Kolibachuk
said, "I saw a friend, a freshman, with an
MCAT book and I was a little unnerved."
Jonson Yee is a junior at Stanford ma
joring in Chemical Engineering. As if his
academic course load wasn't tough
enough, Yee says he is also frustrated with
the pre-med program —not only at Stan
ford, but at colleges in general.
He said he did not think that Stanford
fostered a healthy and supportive environ

ment for pre-med students. Yee added
that his pre-med experience became less
than stellar once he started the biology and
chemistry core curricula at the University.
"[These cores] are designed to weed
out pre-meds," he said. "Why would you
want to weed out pre-meds? I understand
getting into medical school is competitive,
but a lot of freshmen come here enthusias
tic about becoming physicians and become
disillusioned along the way. It's discourag
ing."
Senior Laurel Anderson, who is near
ing the end of her pre-med experience at
Stanford, did not come to Stanford with
the intention of going to medical school.
While she had a lot of exposure to the
medical field as a child, it was not until she
interned at a hospital after her sophomore
and junior years at Stanford that she ce
mented her career goals.
One reason she says that she did not de
cide to be pre-med from the start was that
she wanted to avoid the pre-med stereo
type.
"Some people are very intense about
the whole process, which can make it more
stressful than it needs to be," she said.
"And unfortunately it sometimes feels like
many professors are anti-premed and
want to weed out those who aren't com
pletely motivated from their large classes."
Anderson says that she sees the flexi
bility Stanford students have with the Uni
versity's unconventional pre-med pro
gram.
"[Pre-med students at Stanford] have a
lot of flexibility in choosing their own ma
jors and interests," she said. "Many people
who are pre-med have majors that do not
relate to the sciences at all."
And while there are a lot of classes to
take, Anderson said she feels that if stu
dents plan ahead and take all of the se
quences on track, the requirements will be
fulfilled quickly.
But those majoring in the sciences have
an advantage because most of the required
pre-med courses fall into their majors.
While it is possible to major in the human
ities and follow the pre-med track, the re
quirements can take all four years as an un
dergraduate to complete.
