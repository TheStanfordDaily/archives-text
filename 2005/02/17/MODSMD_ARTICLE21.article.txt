# Type A: Not just a personality
## trait 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The phrase "Type A" is often used to describe some
one who is fast-moving, aggressive, inconsiderate and a
stickler for detail.
This popular conception of "Type A" has its origins
in studies from the 1960s that found a connection be
tween people exhibiting these behaviors and an in
creased risk of heart disease.
"Type A" is not a personality type," Dr. Wesley
Alles, director of the Stanford Health Improvement
Program, said. "It is a chronic-progressive disease that
produces excessive risk for disease, especially heart dis
ease and Type 2 diabetes."
"Type A" disease was originally discovered when
cardiologists Dr. Meyer Friedman and Dr. Ray
Rosenman became aware of the fact that their uphol
stered chairs in the lobby would wear out more
quickly than chairs in the offices of physicians in
other fields. Friedman and Rosenman discovered
that their patients would shred the waiting room
chairs while waiting for their appointments. The car
diologists originally called the phenomenon "coro
nary prone behavior pattern."
"[Friedman and Rosenman] coined the term 'Type
A' in the early 1960s to describe a collection of traits
that they found in some individuals," Biology Prof.
Robert Sapolsky wrote in his book "Why Zebras Don't
Get Ulcers." "[TJhey characterized 'Type-A' people as
immensely competitive, overachieving, time-pressured
and hostile."
Because people with these traits seemed more
prevalent in their cardiology clinic than in other clinics,
Friedman and Rosenman linked these behaviors with
an increased risk of heart disease.
However, other doctors were skeptical of the causal
relationship between "Type-A" behavior and heart dis
ease. Many thought that heart disease was a cause, and
not a result, of "Type-A" behaviors.
"In the beginning there was much disbelief of the ex
istence of such a condition, especially by physicians, but

there have been many, many studies on 'Type-A' char
acteristics and its impact on disease states," Alles said.
Friedman and Rosenman completed one such
study that showed that the presence of "Type-A"
characteristics preceded heart disease. Other re
searchers were unable to replicate these findings,
but new studies determined that hostility, a charac
teristic related to "Type A," was a key factor in pre
dicting heart disease.
"[WJhen scientists re-analyzed some of the original
'Type-A' studies and broke the constellation of traits into
individual ones, hostility popped out as the only significant
predictor of heart disease," Sapolsky wrote in his book.
"These various studies have suggested that a high degree of
hostility predicts coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis,
hemorrhagic stroke and higher rates of mortality with
these diseases."
However, Sapolsky added, studies have also shown
that hostility leads to an increased risk of other diseases
as well.
What distinguishes "Type-A" behavior is that it
stems from what Sapolsky called a feeling of "time
pressuredness," which ultimately is a symptom of inse
curity.
"There's no time to savor anything you've accom
plished, let alone enjoy anything that anyone else has
done, because you must rush off to prove yourself all
over again and try to hide from the world for another
day what a fraud you are," Sapolsky wrote in his book.
According to Sapolsky, Friedman and Rosenman's
work also suggests that insecurity predicts cardiovascu
lar trouble better than hostility, "although theirs ap
pears to be a minority view in the field."
Alles elaborated on "Type A" disease as an interior
struggle with insecurity.
"It's not that 'Type-A' people are insecure, it's that
they engage in a lot of struggle to maintain security and
self esteem," he said. "So 'Type A' is definitely a be
havior pattern that is learned and reinforced — it is not
inherited.!
"The key characteristic is struggle, especially strug
gle around issues that don't seem to produce struggle
among others," he added.
People are classified as "Type-A" by "using a struc
tured interview and video-tape that looks for signs and
symptoms," said Alles. "The structured interview as
signs specific point values to specific observations."
There is also a cut-off point that distinguishes "Type-
A" people from other types, such as "Type-B" people."
Alles suggested looking at these types as a "continu
um," rather than as a set of distinct categories since the
higher a person's score, the worse his or her symptoms
are likely to be. Other types of tests used to track
"Type-A" behavior, such as those conducted on paper.

are not as accurate.
"Type-A" behavior is detrimental for immediate
reasons such as other people's reactions to "Type A"-
related hostility. But it is also harmful in the long run
because of its physiological effects such as an increased
risk for Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
Cardiovascular disease in particular has long been a
pressing issue in America. Statistics from the American
Heart Association estimated that 70,100,000 Ameri
cans had one or more cardiovascular diseases in 2002.
Fortunately, there is a way for individuals who have
"Type A" to cope. Alles suggested that "Type-A" indi
viduals undergo behavior modification that employs
"group support, cognitive re-structuring, acceptance,
affection, serenity and self esteem to counter the un
necessary struggle."
But both Sapolsky and Alles agreed that someone
with "Type-A" traits needs to be willing to make the ef
fort to change their behaviors in order to overcome this
problem.
"Rather than coping with 'Type A,' it is much better
for an individual to determine what produces the inse
curity and to deal productively with it," Alles said.
As for the prevalence of "Type-A" people at Stan
ford, Alles said that the number is probably the same as
at any other university.
"People are 'Type-A' not because they are Stanford
students, but because of insecurity," he said. "I don't
believe Stanford attracts more 'Type-A' applicants
than other schools. [Being] 'Type-A' does not mean
[being a] hard worker or [having a] high intellect, the
two characteristics that I believe do attract a specific
kind of person to Stanford."

Get Ulcers." "[TJhey characterized 'Type-A' people as
immensely competitive, overachieving, time-pressured
and hostile."
Because people with these traits seemed more
prevalent in their cardiology clinic than in other clinics,
Friedman and Rosenman linked these behaviors with
an increased risk of heart disease.
However, other doctors were skeptical of the causal
relationship between "Type-A" behavior and heart dis
ease. Many thought that heart disease was a cause, and
not a result, of "Type-A" behaviors.
"In the beginning there was much disbelief of the ex
istence of such a condition, especially by physicians, but

there have been many, many studies on 'Type-A' char
acteristics and its impact on disease states," Alles said.
Friedman and Rosenman completed one such
study that showed that the presence of "Type-A"
characteristics preceded heart disease. Other re
searchers were unable to replicate these findings,
but new studies determined that hostility, a charac
teristic related to "Type A," was a key factor in pre
dicting heart disease.
"[WJhen scientists re-analyzed some of the original
'Type-A' studies and broke the constellation of traits into
individual ones, hostility popped out as the only significant
predictor of heart disease," Sapolsky wrote in his book.
"These various studies have suggested that a high degree of
hostility predicts coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis,
hemorrhagic stroke and higher rates of mortality with
these diseases."
However, Sapolsky added, studies have also shown
that hostility leads to an increased risk of other diseases
as well.
What distinguishes "Type-A" behavior is that it
stems from what Sapolsky called a feeling of "time
pressuredness," which ultimately is a symptom of inse
curity.
"There's no time to savor anything you've accom
plished, let alone enjoy anything that anyone else has
done, because you must rush off to prove yourself all
over again and try to hide from the world for another
day what a fraud you are," Sapolsky wrote in his book.
According to Sapolsky, Friedman and Rosenman's
work also suggests that insecurity predicts cardiovascu
lar trouble better than hostility, "although theirs ap
pears to be a minority view in the field."
Alles elaborated on "Type A" disease as an interior
struggle with insecurity.
"It's not that 'Type-A' people are insecure, it's that
they engage in a lot of struggle to maintain security and
self esteem," he said. "So 'Type A' is definitely a be
havior pattern that is learned and reinforced — it is not
inherited.!
"The key characteristic is struggle, especially strug
gle around issues that don't seem to produce struggle
among others," he added.
People are classified as "Type-A" by "using a struc
tured interview and video-tape that looks for signs and
symptoms," said Alles. "The structured interview as
signs specific point values to specific observations."
There is also a cut-off point that distinguishes "Type-
A" people from other types, such as "Type-B" people."
Alles suggested looking at these types as a "continu
um," rather than as a set of distinct categories since the
higher a person's score, the worse his or her symptoms
are likely to be. Other types of tests used to track
"Type-A" behavior, such as those conducted on paper.

are not as accurate.
"Type-A" behavior is detrimental for immediate
reasons such as other people's reactions to "Type A"-
related hostility. But it is also harmful in the long run
because of its physiological effects such as an increased
risk for Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
Cardiovascular disease in particular has long been a
pressing issue in America. Statistics from the American
Heart Association estimated that 70,100,000 Ameri
cans had one or more cardiovascular diseases in 2002.
Fortunately, there is a way for individuals who have
"Type A" to cope. Alles suggested that "Type-A" indi
viduals undergo behavior modification that employs
"group support, cognitive re-structuring, acceptance,
affection, serenity and self esteem to counter the un
necessary struggle."
But both Sapolsky and Alles agreed that someone
with "Type-A" traits needs to be willing to make the ef
fort to change their behaviors in order to overcome this
problem.
"Rather than coping with 'Type A,' it is much better
for an individual to determine what produces the inse
curity and to deal productively with it," Alles said.
As for the prevalence of "Type-A" people at Stan
ford, Alles said that the number is probably the same as
at any other university.
"People are 'Type-A' not because they are Stanford
students, but because of insecurity," he said. "I don't
believe Stanford attracts more 'Type-A' applicants
than other schools. [Being] 'Type-A' does not mean
[being a] hard worker or [having a] high intellect, the
two characteristics that I believe do attract a specific
kind of person to Stanford."

The phrase "Type A" is often used to describe some
one who is fast-moving, aggressive, inconsiderate and a
stickler for detail.
This popular conception of "Type A" has its origins
in studies from the 1960s that found a connection be
tween people exhibiting these behaviors and an in
creased risk of heart disease.
"Type A" is not a personality type," Dr. Wesley
Alles, director of the Stanford Health Improvement
Program, said. "It is a chronic-progressive disease that
produces excessive risk for disease, especially heart dis
ease and Type 2 diabetes."
"Type A" disease was originally discovered when
cardiologists Dr. Meyer Friedman and Dr. Ray
Rosenman became aware of the fact that their uphol
stered chairs in the lobby would wear out more
quickly than chairs in the offices of physicians in
other fields. Friedman and Rosenman discovered
that their patients would shred the waiting room
chairs while waiting for their appointments. The car
diologists originally called the phenomenon "coro
nary prone behavior pattern."
"[Friedman and Rosenman] coined the term 'Type
A' in the early 1960s to describe a collection of traits
that they found in some individuals," Biology Prof.
Robert Sapolsky wrote in his book "Why Zebras Don't
