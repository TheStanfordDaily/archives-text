## Editorial Be honest about tuition increases 
### 
More than $10,000 a quarter. It's a milestone.
Think about it fora second. That's $I,(KX) a week,
or $S(X) per unit — more if you take less than 20 units
each quarter. Your 1-Hum experience just set you
back over $7,500.
It's 12 times tuition 35 years ago, five times tuition
25 years ago and double tuition 15 years ago.
Tuition keeps jumping and Stanford students have
virtually no say in how much they have to pay each
quarter. We debate ASSU special fees, laundry costs
and Internet bills, but they make up just a small per
centage of the additional $1,353 that students will
have to pay next year just to attend Stanford. Our
"cost of living" initiatives are just a fraction of housing
costs every quarter, and the much-debated cost of
textbooks is less than the increase in tuition that we
barely talk about.
Each year, the University's Board of Trustees
buries news about the tuition increase among many
other announcements. This year The Daily was com
plicit, burying the story on page two. And each year
the Board seems to explain the increase with fewer
words and less regret. We acknowledge and under
stand the need for an increase in tuition, even a fairly
large annual one, but these increases must come with
both explanations and signs that the Board is doing all
it can to minimize costs.
Echoing last year's Daily editorial board, we call
fora fuller explanation and justification of tuition in
creases. Staff and faculty salaries are not rising as fast
as tuition; building concerns were cited, but outside
donors pay for many new buildings and renovations;
and the endowment is recovering from economic
downturns quite nicely — though the smoothing for
mula the University uses means we still aren't seeing
all those benefits.
Increasing health care costs for faculty and staff are
a likely culprit, as they have prompted many of the
University's budget crunches.
We understand that future improvements to hous
ing and student space are expensive, and we support
them, but students would be more likely to accept
large annual increases in tuition if we had a better

sense of where our money was going.
Need-based financial aid blunts the impact of tu
ition increases for many students, and costs are in
evitably rising for the University. But citing tuition as
the main source of unrestricted income - the primary
explanation this year — implies that administrators
see students only as paying customers or even just tu
ition conduits.
And undergraduates on financial aid, a large per
centage but barely a majority, shouldn't be indifferent
to tuition increases either. Two years ago, financial
aid per-student decreased, but you wouldn't know it
from the tuition announcements. The University re
ported in September that the self-help portion of fi
nancial aid was jumping to $750. This meant that by
next February, the Board could ignore the issue of fi
nancial aid when raising tuition again.
For all the University's talk of diversity and expan
sion of opportunities for graduate students, tuition in
creased faster at the Graduate School of Business (8.8
percent) and the Medical School (5.45 percent) than it
did for undergraduates.
Our tuition increases are in line with those of other
peer universities, but Stanford's most notable and
successful moves have come when it has broken ranks
with others, not followed the crowd.
In order to promote real dialogue about the largest
bill many students will ever pay, the University should
be more open and understanding about tuition in
creases. If it acknowledged that tuition will increase
every year, probably around the historic baseline of
five percent, Stanford would at least encourage stu
dents to plan ahead.
Also, the University must note moves by Harvard
and Princeton to make financial aid more transparent
and generous to low-income students. Stanford may
not have the money fora similar initiative. But the
University should focus on continuing the efforts
begun with the Campaign for Undergraduate Educa
tion, and perhaps return to the late-'9os trend of re
ducing student contributions to financial aid by a
small amount every time tuition increases.

large annual increases in tuition if we had a better

sense of where our money was going.
Need-based financial aid blunts the impact of tu
ition increases for many students, and costs are in
evitably rising for the University. But citing tuition as
the main source of unrestricted income - the primary
explanation this year — implies that administrators
see students only as paying customers or even just tu
ition conduits.
And undergraduates on financial aid, a large per
centage but barely a majority, shouldn't be indifferent
to tuition increases either. Two years ago, financial
aid per-student decreased, but you wouldn't know it
from the tuition announcements. The University re
ported in September that the self-help portion of fi
nancial aid was jumping to $750. This meant that by
next February, the Board could ignore the issue of fi
nancial aid when raising tuition again.
For all the University's talk of diversity and expan
sion of opportunities for graduate students, tuition in
creased faster at the Graduate School of Business (8.8
percent) and the Medical School (5.45 percent) than it
did for undergraduates.
Our tuition increases are in line with those of other
peer universities, but Stanford's most notable and
successful moves have come when it has broken ranks
with others, not followed the crowd.
In order to promote real dialogue about the largest
bill many students will ever pay, the University should
be more open and understanding about tuition in
creases. If it acknowledged that tuition will increase
every year, probably around the historic baseline of
five percent, Stanford would at least encourage stu
dents to plan ahead.
Also, the University must note moves by Harvard
and Princeton to make financial aid more transparent
and generous to low-income students. Stanford may
not have the money fora similar initiative. But the
University should focus on continuing the efforts
begun with the Campaign for Undergraduate Educa
tion, and perhaps return to the late-'9os trend of re
ducing student contributions to financial aid by a
small amount every time tuition increases.

More than $10,000 a quarter. It's a milestone.
Think about it fora second. That's $I,(KX) a week,
or $S(X) per unit — more if you take less than 20 units
each quarter. Your 1-Hum experience just set you
back over $7,500.
It's 12 times tuition 35 years ago, five times tuition
25 years ago and double tuition 15 years ago.
Tuition keeps jumping and Stanford students have
virtually no say in how much they have to pay each
quarter. We debate ASSU special fees, laundry costs
and Internet bills, but they make up just a small per
centage of the additional $1,353 that students will
have to pay next year just to attend Stanford. Our
"cost of living" initiatives are just a fraction of housing
costs every quarter, and the much-debated cost of
textbooks is less than the increase in tuition that we
barely talk about.
Each year, the University's Board of Trustees
buries news about the tuition increase among many
other announcements. This year The Daily was com
plicit, burying the story on page two. And each year
the Board seems to explain the increase with fewer
words and less regret. We acknowledge and under
stand the need for an increase in tuition, even a fairly
large annual one, but these increases must come with
both explanations and signs that the Board is doing all
it can to minimize costs.
Echoing last year's Daily editorial board, we call
fora fuller explanation and justification of tuition in
creases. Staff and faculty salaries are not rising as fast
as tuition; building concerns were cited, but outside
donors pay for many new buildings and renovations;
and the endowment is recovering from economic
downturns quite nicely — though the smoothing for
mula the University uses means we still aren't seeing
all those benefits.
Increasing health care costs for faculty and staff are
a likely culprit, as they have prompted many of the
University's budget crunches.
We understand that future improvements to hous
ing and student space are expensive, and we support
them, but students would be more likely to accept
large annual increases in tuition if we had a better

sense of where our money was going.
