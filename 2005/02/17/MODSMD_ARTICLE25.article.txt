# Let it be
## To spend or not to spend

My dad sent me this e-mail for
Valentine's Day (reprinted with his
permission):
Hi Andrea,
I read a sarcastic article by some
woman about how we have over-com
mercialized a day that was originally
intended to be a day for lovers to be es
pecially attentive to each other. Now
it's all been fed into the machine of
consumerism, kind of like Christmas.

I'm beginning to feel iconoclastic about just about every
holiday, including Independence Day, which to me repre
sents, through the display of fireworks, this country's ad
diction to wars.., Anyway, I hope you have a nice Valen
tines Day.
Love,
Dad
Wow, if that doesn't merit a Zoloft prescription, what
does? My dad's been depressed for as long as I can re
member, but this e-mail reminded me of the fact again.
In my experience, anti-consumerism and depression
often accompany each other. Every time I've been de
pressed, I've also shunned consumption â€” and vice
versa. The happiest people I know tend to spend money
with the greatest abandon.

I'm wondering, which way does the causation arrow
point? Does being depressed turn people into anti-con
sumers, perhaps because they feel undeserving? Or does
noticing our society's spending obsession cause people
to become depressed?
For the first hypothesis, it's possible that depressed
people might be sad due to "chemical imbalances," but
in the attempt to explain their sadness, settle on con
sumerism. 1 think I've done something similar before.
Sometimes when I've been sad, I've told myself, "I'm sad
because, hmm, let's see ... because people are starving
in Africa. That's it, right?"
It's also possible that depressed people feel like they
don't deserve having large amounts of money spent on
them. The Catch-22 of depression is that therapy, which
putatively treats depression (I'm going to question this
in a future column), costs a lot of money, so the people
who need it most tend to deny it to themselves.
But does my Dad really feel like he doesn't deserve
the $2 Valentine's card I sent him? Wal-Mart and dollar
stores have made consumer goods so cheap that even
Schopenhauer couldn't have felt too guilty about getting
a present or buying something.
Yet the sadness remains, even when the purchase is
