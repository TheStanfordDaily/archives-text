# Writing in the Margins
## There's nothing like the first time 
### 
I went to Kepler's for the first time
the other night. The voyage came
loaded with anticipation and expecta
tion. I visited the Web site a few times
before I went, trying to get a feel for
Kepler's, trying to understand an in
dependent bookstore.
I am a decidedly bourgeois reader.
My books come to me by way of
Barnes and Noble and Borders. I've
become used to Barnes and Noble and

Borders; 1 enjoy the anonymity of it all. Even though 1 visit
the Barnes and Noble near my house frequently, no one
there knows my name, and it's rare to see the same face
twice. I don't mind the anonymity because 1 don't like ask
ing for help, receiving help or taking part in idle chatter.
Kepler's Web site offers all the kind promises that I
fear. There is a page devoted to what the staff is reading;
it is entitled "What We're Reading." and instead of just
a list of some titles with blurbs by random employees, I
found myself staring at a gentle world of visible faces
with lists and blurbs for each face, written by the faces

themselves. I met Nancy, Darryl, Andy and others. 1
praise this friendliness in my mind, but in my heart, that
endless abyss, I worry about what I'll do to such a wel
coming ecosystem.
Kepler's resides in a little shopping center, Menlo
Center. It's a big bookstore, with lots of windows and lots
of subterranean parking. Kepler's also has lots of books.
The literature section spans the majority of the back of
the store, with letters jutting out from the shelves, almost
to assure customers that it is. in fact, alphabetized. In the
science section, a skeleton hangs down from the ceiling,
and some of the shelves form labyrinths.
Yet, for all of its floor-to-ceiling bookcases and
mazes, there's a lot of open space at Kepler's. There's a
gaudy magazine rack and music plays loudly overhead.
An ocean of display tables takes up the majority of the
open space, offering current fiction, nonfiction, literary
nonfiction, current events, bargain books, sports books
and, you know, books. It's easy to forget that this isn't
Barnes and Noble.

And then, while leafing through
J.M. Coetzee's Nobel acceptance
speech, I noticed Nancy putting
books on one of the tables. I wonder
what she would say about Dante's
"Inferno." I read it a while ago, and
it's on her "What We're Reading"
page. I consider whether or not she
has read the whole Divine Comedy.
I wonder what it's like being a part
of the Kepler's community.
I think about whether or not the
people I followed to Kepler's know
Nancy. I'm sure they must. It shows
in the way they touched the paper
backs, not the glossy ones, but the
matte ones, with their sandy texture,
and how they opened books and
smelled the pages. I saw it in the way
they inhaled and inhaled. The way
they wandered, smiled and told the
books, quietly and silently, that they
loved them. They seemed to know
the books, and Kepler's. I wonder if
I'll ever be a part of Kepler's.
