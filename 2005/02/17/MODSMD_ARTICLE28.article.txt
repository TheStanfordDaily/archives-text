## Cultural literacy in OSPs is our responsibility 
### BRISTIN JONES 
Christopher Vaughan was right
when he wrote that the Overseas
Studies Program, or OSP, centers
aren't teaching true cultural literacy
("Stop OSP hand-holding," Feb.
11). But the reason isn't because of
Stanford's "upper-middle-class sen
sibility" or the opulence of Bing Cul
tural Enrichment Events. OSP is not
teaching true cultural literacy be
cause it is not something that any
group event, classroom lecture or
field trip can teach. Here at Stanford
in Florence this quarter, I have real
ized cultural literacy must be experi
enced at the initiative of the student.
Cultural literacy comes from
making the transition from tourist to
traveler. On our first day of orienta
tion, our program director stressed
the difference between these two
seemingly similar words. A tourist
goes abroad without ever mentally
leaving home, while a traveler goes
abroad and mentally acclimatizes to
the new environment.
Cultural literacy comes from
making mistakes and slowly but
surely learning from them, like get
ting lost in the same exact way for
the third time and in doing so, final
ly figuring out how Piazza della In
dipendenza connects to Piazza della
Liberta. Or short-circuiting the elec
tricity in the entire house by turning
on the tea boiler while the dishwash
er is going.
Cultural literacy comes from
learning what the locals do and giv
ing it a try. Our academic and stu
dent services coordinator recom
mended we find a cafe near our
house and that we make a habit of
having a cappuccino at the bar and
browsing the newspaper. It's a very
Italian thing to do Going into a cafe
as part of a regimented excursion
just wouldn't be the same. It's some
thing 1 have to do, and am glad to do,
alone.
Cultural literacy is about making
a bella figura, a good impression. To
Italians, making a bella figura is es
sential, and unfortunately years of
American students using their time
in Florence as an extended study
break and drinking fest have led to
the stereotype of the bad, or cattivo,
American. At first I found myself
trying to blend in. something 1 had
never been concerned with back in
the United States. What shoes do

they wear? How do they tie their
scarves? I, too, have become disgust
ed at the sight of big groups of
American students, usually obnox
iously loud and inebriated.
But 1 have learned my role here
as a Stanford student is not so much
to blend in but to show by way of ex
ample that not all Americans are
like that. Just today when the
salesclerk ran out the door after me
to make sure I hadn't stolen the shirt
I had tried on, I politely pointed to
the shirt I had returned to the rack
and she apologized, but since she
could tell I was American, she had to
double-check.
Cultural literacy is about meeting
local people outside your host fami
ly and language partners. Whether
or not this is through Stanford-facil
itated means, such as internships or
volunteer programs, is not impor
tant. Some of my most valuable mo
ments here in Florence have been
training and hanging out with the
Firenze Triathlon team. What is im
portant is witnessing the local cul
ture in an uncensored setting.
Before arriving in Florence, I was
worried my experience would be too
regimented. I had spent the summer
traveling by myself in Spain on a re
search grant, so I was used to being
independent. Sure, OSP holds your
hand at first, and although I initially
thought this was restrictive, 1 have
realized it's just a way of jump-start
ing us into the culture. Sure, I could
have bought a bus pass for myself at
a tabaccheria, but not having to buy
one allowed me to start using it right
away. Sure, my art history class
could be taught in Italian, but having
the artwork explained to me in En
glish helps me concentrate on com
prehending the significance of the
work instead of concentrating on
comprehending what the professor
is saying.
Cultural literacy comes from let
ting go of OSP's hand. It is up to the
student to let go when he or she feels
comfortable, which may take longer
for students who have not traveled
abroad before or who are less famil
iar with the language. But it is up to
the student, not OSP. to take this
step.
Last but not least, cultural litera
cy comes from turning social privi
leges into social responsibility.
Rather than being an OSP phe-
nomenon, the social privileges expe
rienced at Stanford abroad pro
grams simply parallel the privileged
nature of being able to attend Stan
ford in the first place. I remember
during freshman orientation dis
cussing the moral dilemma of paying
$40,000 a year when this money
could be going to help those in need.
But what if this money and these
experiences are an investment, not
preparing us fora social class but
helping us come in contact with
other students concerned with social
inequalities and helping others?
Stanford, at home and abroad, gives
us amazing opportunities and it's

our job as students to take advan
tage of these resources and convert
them into positive actions.
We all know that not all the learn
ing or personal growth that we experi
ence on the Stanford home campus
happens in the classroom or is directly
facilitated by Stanford professors and
staff. Likewise, there are some things,
like cultural literacy, that OSP just
cannot (or even should not) teach.
I wholeheartedly agree that inves
tigating OSP options for providing a
more realistic and well-rounded in
ternational view would be a worth
while endeavor. But if after my quar
ter in Florence I am not a culturally
literate Stanford student, I will not
blame OSP or Mrs. Bing's generosity
for my own shortcomings.
