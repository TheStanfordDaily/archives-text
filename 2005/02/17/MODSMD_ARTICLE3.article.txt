# Assistant Hepp relishing new role
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Few can say that their first col
lege basketball coaching job came
at a major Division I program at
the ripe old age of 25. Even fewer
can tell friends they played bas
ketball at North Carolina. Stan
ford first-year assistant coach L.J.
Hepp, now 26, can say both.
Hepp's path to the college bas
ketball coaching ranks began ap
propriately enough on Tobacco
Road. Although he was a better
shortstop than shooter at
Leesville Road High School in
Raleigh, N.C., Hepp declined sev
eral baseball scholarship offers
and walked onto the junior varsity
squad as a freshman at Chapel
Hill. To cut costs, most schools did
away with non-varsity programs
after freshmen were permitted to
play varsity in 1974, but legendary
Tar Heel head coach Dean Smith
made sure the program, which al
lows walk-ons to play for two
years before some move up to var
sity, remained a fixture at UNC.
"He thought there was tremen
dous value there in letting his as
sistant coaches act as head coach
es and essentially training your
walk-ons for two years," said
Hepp, who was coached by the
leading scorer in UNC history and
current Detroit Pistons assistant
Phil Ford. "It allows you to get a
true feel fora kid's personality, his
work ethic, how he does in the
classroom."
While Hepp had no legitimate
shot at bumping the likes of Ed
Cota and Brendan Haywood from
the varsity roster, the experience
laid the groundwork for his future
career in college basketball. An
uninspiring internship at Banc of
America in Charlotte the summer
after his junior year sold the busi
ness major on pursuing coaching.
"I realized I wanted to do
something I was passionate
about," Hepp said. "I didn't want
to go to work just fora paycheck."
He got his first chance when
Matt Doherty accepted the North
Carolina head coaching job and
assigned assistant coach Doug

Wojcik the duty of overseeing the
JV team during Hepp's senior
year. Hepp showed Wojcik the ins
and outs of the program as the as
sistant JV coach. He observed
Doherty's practice before helping
run the JV practice, handled
scheduling and organized tryouts
for the JV team — all the while
keeping up with his schoolwork.
"1 didn't have much of a social
life," Hepp said.
While pursuing a graduate de
gree in Sports Administration,
Hepp served as a Graduate Assis
tant on Doherty's staff for the
next two years. His responsibili
ties ranged from giving campus
tours to recruits to filming games
and helping develop scouting re
ports. He also wrote a thesis dur
ing his second year, examining the
correlation between the position a
player is taken in the draft and his
future success.
Former Stanford All-Ameri
can and NBA first-round pick
Josh Childress took a look at it last
year.
"When he got the feel that he
was a top-10, it was a no-brainer in
a lot of ways," said Hepp, who has
data based on a sample of all play
ers drafted in the 1980s to back it
up.
With no guarantees of a job
after Doherty was let go by North
Carolina following a tumultuous
8-20 season, Hepp faxed his re
sume to a number of schools, in
cluding Stanford, which had an
opening fora video coordinator.
At a coach's convention at the
Final Four in New Orleans, Hepp
interviewed with then-Stanford
assistant coach Russell Turner
and former assistant athletic di
rector Jamie Zaninovich.
"I asked him, 'How did you
guys manage to screw up the best
job in college basketball?'," said
Turner, who coached at ACC
rival Wake Forest before coming
to Stanford. "He handled that
pretty well. He was a personable
and bright person, and he came
from a place where college bas
ketball is more woven into the
fabric of your everyday life. I

thought that was good for our staff."
Two days later Montgomery of
fered Hepp the spot over a three
hour breakfast. '
"It was an unbelievable entry
level coaching job," said Hepp, who
estimated he spent 10 to 12 hours a
day watching or editing tape last sea
son. He would splice together pack
ages of every single shot a player
took during the season on occasion.
March Madness took on a whole
new meaning. With the assistance of
sophomore manager Josh Johnson -
and seven satellites - Hepp taped
every game that was broadcast in
February. By the time the brackets
were announced on Selection Sun
day, Hepp had at least one tape of
every team in the tournament and
two of the Cardinal's obscure first
round opponent, Texas-San Anto
nio.
Hepp was less prepared for the
shocking news after the season that
Montgomery was leaving Stanford
to take the head coaching position
with the NBA's Golden State War
riors. He was grateful to hear that
Trent Johnson — introduced as the
Cardinal's new head coach one week
later — was retaining the staff of his
predecessor and good friend. With
Turner joining Montgomery in Oak
land, Johnson had an assistant
coaching vacancy to fill. Rather than
hire a more experienced candidate,
he looked to Hepp.
"I'm incredibly fortunate and
lucky, but I worked as hard as I
could, knowing that if something like
that happened, I put myself in the
best position to be the guy," Hepp
said.

While Hepp still docs some video
work, he spends the majority of his
time recruiting — attending AAU
games during the summer and high
school games during the season.
Hepp said he relishes the opportuni
ty to build relationships with
prospective student-athletes in addi
tion to the Stanford team. While
being young certainly has its advan
tages — Hepp is probably one of a
handful of coaches who know how to
use text messages to communicate
with recruits because phone calls are
prohibited — he admits that his age
is a bit of a double-edged sword.
"I think the biggest challenge is
the relationship with the players,"
Hepp said. "Going from L.J. the
video guy to L.J. the coach is a chal
lenge because of my age. It's some
thing I think about often."
The man he replaced sees the
value of having young blood in the
Cardinal coaching ranks.
"He does a good job connecting
to the players and has a sense of the
pulse of the team," Turner said. "His
ability to bridge the generation gap a
little bit on the staff is important."
Hepp has also earned the respect
of the Cardinal players, including
former Stanford guard and Hepp's
housemate Matt Lottich.
"Last year L.J. brought a differ
ent light to Stanford basketball,"
Lottich said. "All that video stuff
was new to us. He was also a nice guy
and fit in well with our program.
Video was never really fun to watch,
but it was fun to go in there and hang
out with L.J."
Senior center Rob Little says
Hepp has nothing to worry about in
his new role.
"Basketball is basketball; age real
ly plays no factor if you know what
you are talking about," Little said.
"L.J. has been around enough coach
es and two very credible programs in

North Carolina and Stanford, so he
has had two great examples of how to
do things the right way."
Little's thoughts echo the over
flowing gratitude that Hepp has for
all the teachers and coaches who
have already mentored him through
out his short career. He keeps in
touch with most of them and one of
the first things he did upon arriving

at Stanford was to write Dean Smith
a thank-you letter for keeping the J V
program around.
"From my coaches at Carolina to
Coach Montgomery and Coach
Johnson ... all those people have
taken an interest in me," Hepp said.
"They have all helped me become a
better coach. That's what's special
about each situation; you draw

lessons from them on a life and per
sonal level."
Virginia Commonwealth's Jeff
Capel, the youngest head coach in
Division I college basketball, turned
30 last week. Might Hepp carry that
distinction in the near future?
"In the past, I looked at my career
path like a great pool player, setting
up their second shot while they're

making their first shot," Hepp said.
"With the opportunity that I have
right now, the only thing I'm hungry
for is to help Coach Johnson and
Stanford be as successful as we can
be here. I've got a tremendous
amount of respect for the opportuni
ty that I have and I haven't spent a
second thinking about my next
move."
