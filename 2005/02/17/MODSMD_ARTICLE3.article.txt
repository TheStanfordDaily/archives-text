# Assistant Hepp relishing new role
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Few can say that their first col
lege basketball coaching job came
at a major Division I program at
the ripe old age of 25. Even fewer
can tell friends they played bas
ketball at North Carolina. Stan
ford first-year assistant coach L.J.
Hepp, now 26, can say both.
Hepp's path to the college bas
ketball coaching ranks began ap
propriately enough on Tobacco
Road. Although he was a better
shortstop than shooter at
Leesville Road High School in
Raleigh, N.C., Hepp declined sev
eral baseball scholarship offers
and walked onto the junior varsity
squad as a freshman at Chapel
Hill. To cut costs, most schools did
away with non-varsity programs
after freshmen were permitted to
play varsity in 1974, but legendary
Tar Heel head coach Dean Smith
made sure the program, which al
lows walk-ons to play for two
years before some move up to var
sity, remained a fixture at UNC.
"He thought there was tremen
dous value there in letting his as
sistant coaches act as head coach
es and essentially training your
walk-ons for two years," said
Hepp, who was coached by the
leading scorer in UNC history and
current Detroit Pistons assistant
Phil Ford. "It allows you to get a
true feel fora kid's personality, his
work ethic, how he does in the
classroom."
While Hepp had no legitimate
shot at bumping the likes of Ed
Cota and Brendan Haywood from
the varsity roster, the experience
laid the groundwork for his future
career in college basketball. An
uninspiring internship at Banc of
America in Charlotte the summer
after his junior year sold the busi
ness major on pursuing coaching.
"I realized I wanted to do
something I was passionate
about," Hepp said. "I didn't want
to go to work just fora paycheck."
He got his first chance when
Matt Doherty accepted the North
Carolina head coaching job and
assigned assistant coach Doug

Wojcik the duty of overseeing the
JV team during Hepp's senior
year. Hepp showed Wojcik the ins
and outs of the program as the as
sistant JV coach. He observed
Doherty's practice before helping
run the JV practice, handled
scheduling and organized tryouts
for the JV team â€” all the while
keeping up with his schoolwork.
"1 didn't have much of a social
life," Hepp said.
While pursuing a graduate de
gree in Sports Administration,
Hepp served as a Graduate Assis
tant on Doherty's staff for the
next two years. His responsibili
ties ranged from giving campus
tours to recruits to filming games
and helping develop scouting re
ports. He also wrote a thesis dur
ing his second year, examining the
correlation between the position a
player is taken in the draft and his
future success.
Former Stanford All-Ameri
can and NBA first-round pick
Josh Childress took a look at it last
year.
"When he got the feel that he
was a top-10, it was a no-brainer in
a lot of ways," said Hepp, who has
data based on a sample of all play
ers drafted in the 1980s to back it
up.
With no guarantees of a job
after Doherty was let go by North
Carolina following a tumultuous
8-20 season, Hepp faxed his re
sume to a number of schools, in
cluding Stanford, which had an
opening fora video coordinator.
At a coach's convention at the
Final Four in New Orleans, Hepp
interviewed with then-Stanford
assistant coach Russell Turner
and former assistant athletic di
rector Jamie Zaninovich.
"I asked him, 'How did you
guys manage to screw up the best
job in college basketball?'," said
Turner, who coached at ACC
rival Wake Forest before coming
to Stanford. "He handled that
pretty well. He was a personable
and bright person, and he came
from a place where college bas
ketball is more woven into the
fabric of your everyday life. I
