Kanakia's take on religion is offensive
Wednesday's column about the moral usefulness
of religion ("Belief in God — so wrong, yet so
right," Feb. 16), in addition to being written in an
overzealously insulting and apathetic manner, is
based upon a number of false premises and supposi
tions. A priori, Kanakia presupposes that all "be
lievers" are inherently good and nice people that are
only capable of doing the "right thing." As any de
cent appraisal of the past would rapidly establish,
this is hogwash. Secondly, the writer extends his own
failure in finding God to a general model for all
human beings raised in an atheistic environment; 1
personally am living testimony to the contrary. Fur
thermore, he quite wrongly assumes also that any
person "indoctrinated" to believe in God will con
tinue his faith until his death, a grossly erroneous as
sessment.
Also, Kanakia equates the "rampant secularism" of

the educational system with amoral atheism, whereas
in truth secularism is a means of acceptance for all
creeds and religions; in exactly this system, year after
year. God-fearing graduates — individuals neither
brainwashed to believe in God nor ridiculed not to —
are produced.
Furthermore. Kanakia writes about religion in a
very childish and superficial manner; the fear of pun
ishment, for example, is hardly the driving motivation
behind one's religious thought. Furthermore, it is
rather upsetting that anyone would write about an es
sential cornerstone in many people's lives in such a sar
castic, derisory and disrespectful manner, even if it was
meant as an attempt at dry humor. Perhaps it would
have been preferable if Kanakia had maintained a
semblance of civility and respect toward those with
convictions contrary to his own.
