# The 						Double Clutch
## A 						voice behind Stanford's calls 
### 
I called a fellow for an interview last week, and
when he finally answered, I almost hung up.
I didn't recognize his voice.
That's because Steve Frost has two voices -
an even-tempered one he uses in real life and the
bellowing roar he uses as the public address an
nouncer for Stanford basketball and football.
"Even my friends have come to games and
not recognized it was me talking," he said.
Frost is true Cardinal - he graduated from
Stanford in 19%, earned two varsity letters in
football and even works at Google.
I was curious about Steve's story because I
was a basketball announcer in my younger years
at a small technical college just north of Boston.
I asked the coaches, whom I knew vaguely, if
they might like my voice for the winter. What
followed was a raucous season of controlled

yelling ("goin' LONG dis
tance"), ridiculous idioms
("like a penguin with a hot
herring!"), kicking the scor
er's table and cheering from
the microphone.
There are people on cam
pus who were witness to this
act, and they shall remain
nameless. (Hi, Lauren.) In my
proudest moment, I was al
most assessed a technical foul

for playing Arnold Schwarzenegger sound clips
through the PA system ("Hey ref, that wasn't a
foul!" "STOP WHINING!").
Frost's path to the microphone was a bit
more circuitous: The old announcer retired in
1994, and they had a contest to determine the
successor.
"I came in second, but I ended up substitut
ing for the winner on a few occasions," Frost
said.
He caught the eye (or ear) of the right people
and spent two seasons announcing for the
women's team as Tara VanDerveer continued
to build her legendary program.
From there, it was only a matter of time until
the men's gig opened up and Steve became the
biggest voice in town. He came on board follow
ing the 1998 Final Four season, just as the pro
gram was reaching critical mass with superstars
like Mark Madsen and Art "Poppin' a Three"
Lee.
The assistant athletic director for football in
stalled him later in Stanford Stadium, and he's
been entrenched in the Stanford sports scene
ever since.
Frost loves having a hobby that doesn't cost
him money. Not only does he have the best bas
ketball seat in the house, but because he has the
chance to interact with players and officials and
clock the tempo of the event he is "part of the
game," he says.
Football is a bit different. Frost helps set the
atmosphere, but the role of the announcer in a
stadium is a bit more transparent.
To help him spot players and coordinate the
task. Frost has a special teammate with him in
the pressbox - his wife Andrea Paz Frost, Class
of 1998, who works on campus as the Director of
Visitor Relations for Undergraduate Admis
sions.
Frost is an example of someone who is special
in sports - college sports in particular: a homer
who can still be classy, and a charm the fans can


Cristopher
Anderson
count on; a guy who loves his school,
hut doesn't degrade the opposition -
and doesn't come on the mic sound
ing like he just stepped out of the beer
garden.
Actually, Frost got in a bit of heat
at Big Game one year when he made
disparaging comments about Cal as
the Axe was paraded around the field.
As he recalled, it went something like
"in case you haven't seen it in a while,
this is the Axe." Mind you, this was in
the midst of seven straight wins
against the Bears.
(Another hilarious example of
home cooking that comes to mind is
Washington State stadium announcer
Glenn Johnson, known for saying
'That's another Cougar...' and let
ting the crowd fill in, 'FIRST
DOWN!')
Frost ranks among his top memo
ries fullback Casey Moore's coast-to

coast touchdown run in the 1999 Big
Game. That win sealed Stanford's
first Rose Bowl appearance since
1971 (when they were still called the
Indians).
Another of his favorite moments
came when he didn't say anything.
Last year's game-winning three
against Arizona was reviewed by the
officials, and by the time Frost was
able to say "three-pointer by Nick
Robinson," bedlam had overrun
Maples.
In case you were wondering (or
had a taste for trivia). Frost is the
older brother of Scott Frost, the
jackrabbit quarterback who trans
ferred to his home in Nebraska and
won a share of the 1997 national
championship. He's now making a
crack at his own broadcasting career,
but he'll need a few years to catch up
with his big bro.

Christopher Anderson failed in his
quest to become the first announcer in
NCAA history to he ejected from a con
test. E-mail him at cpanders@stan
