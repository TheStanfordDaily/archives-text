### DANIEL NOVINSON 
The record of the women's
lacrosse team is 1-0. One win on the
season, one win in the conference.
The Cardinal will look to give some
companionship to their lone victor)'
as they visit Saint Mary's on Friday
and UC-Davis on Sunday.
If recent results are any indica
tion, the Cardinal have ample reason
to be optimistic heading into their
season's second and third matchups.
Last season, the women demolished
Saint Mary's and UC-Davis,
outscoring the two Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation members a com
bined 45-16 over three meetings. The
dominance over MPSF opponents
has continued into this year and was
demonstrated in last Saturday's sea
son opener: the Cardinal had their
way with Oregon, dismantling the
first-year program 19-6.
"I think we need to play like we
played against Oregon on Saturday,
except start off better," said sopho
more midfielder Elizabeth Piselli.
who scored a career-high five goals
after her team fell behind the Ducks
2-0. "This weekend I'd like to see us
start off really well and have the ball
in their end. Possession is nine-tenths
of the battle. It's all about our mental
game, because we have the talent. If
we're mentally in the game there's
no stopping us, and we'll definitely
be able to keep up."
Although somewhat more re

served in her optimism, even head
coach Michelle Uhlfelder couldn't
help but express confidence in her
team.
' Having seen the game tape from
Oregon, there's something you can
see on tape that was very compli
mentary. to our team in a lot of as
pects, especially considering what a
lot of our individual players' goals
were," Uhlfelder said.
"We're pleased attackers arc get
ting to net and getting their shot off,"
she added. "We're pleased with our
youth and how tough they are. We
want to work things that are present
ed in practice and work on putting
them into full speed against another
team. We want to get better every
day and see how good we can be.
That's a tough goal."
First on the slate is a Friday after
noon game against Saint Mary's, a
team the Cardinal defeated 13-9 last
year. Last season, the Gaels went 4-
12 overall and 0-4 in the MPSF. They
open this season against Stanford.
"When we play Saint Mary's, we
face very tough athletes who get the
ball up the field very well and can
muscle the ball to the cage,"
Uhlfelder said. "Focusing on con
taining speed and defending the fast
break will be our preparation for this
year."
The only returning Gael with
over 20 points last season, sopho-
