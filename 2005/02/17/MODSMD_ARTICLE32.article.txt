# Women's lacrosse set for road swing
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON 
The record of the women's
lacrosse team is 1-0. One win on the
season, one win in the conference.
The Cardinal will look to give some
companionship to their lone victor)'
as they visit Saint Mary's on Friday
and UC-Davis on Sunday.
If recent results are any indica
tion, the Cardinal have ample reason
to be optimistic heading into their
season's second and third matchups.
Last season, the women demolished
Saint Mary's and UC-Davis,
outscoring the two Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation members a com
bined 45-16 over three meetings. The
dominance over MPSF opponents
has continued into this year and was
demonstrated in last Saturday's sea
son opener: the Cardinal had their
way with Oregon, dismantling the
first-year program 19-6.
"I think we need to play like we
played against Oregon on Saturday,
except start off better," said sopho
more midfielder Elizabeth Piselli.
who scored a career-high five goals
after her team fell behind the Ducks
2-0. "This weekend I'd like to see us
start off really well and have the ball
in their end. Possession is nine-tenths
of the battle. It's all about our mental
game, because we have the talent. If
we're mentally in the game there's
no stopping us, and we'll definitely
be able to keep up."
Although somewhat more re

served in her optimism, even head
coach Michelle Uhlfelder couldn't
help but express confidence in her
team.
' Having seen the game tape from
Oregon, there's something you can
see on tape that was very compli
mentary. to our team in a lot of as
pects, especially considering what a
lot of our individual players' goals
were," Uhlfelder said.
"We're pleased attackers arc get
ting to net and getting their shot off,"
she added. "We're pleased with our
youth and how tough they are. We
want to work things that are present
ed in practice and work on putting
them into full speed against another
team. We want to get better every
day and see how good we can be.
That's a tough goal."
First on the slate is a Friday after
noon game against Saint Mary's, a
team the Cardinal defeated 13-9 last
year. Last season, the Gaels went 4-
12 overall and 0-4 in the MPSF. They
open this season against Stanford.
"When we play Saint Mary's, we
face very tough athletes who get the
ball up the field very well and can
muscle the ball to the cage,"
Uhlfelder said. "Focusing on con
taining speed and defending the fast
break will be our preparation for this
year."
The only returning Gael with
over 20 points last season, sopho-
more midfielder Jackie Spencer, netted
43 goals in 2<X)4 and will draw plenty of
attention from this year's Cardinal de
fense.
"1 recall Jackie using her speed very
well," Uhlfeldersaid. "She's dangerous
out of the midfield because she can pick
up a ball, run past a few people and pre
sent problems for low-defenders, creat
ing a fast break. She comes up with a lot
of their 50/50 balls and comes up with
lots of ground balls."
After a day of rest, Stanford will visit
a Davis team that the Cardinal defeated
154 and 17-3 in two meetings last year.
I Respite these lopsided results, I Jhlfelder
insists that the Cardinal must prepare
carefully for the 2005 Davis squad.
"1 think each year Davis has be
come an increasingly more disciplined
team and presents a lot more variety in
their offenses," Uhlfelder said. "They
really work on backdoor cuts and feed
ing backdoor, and that's tough. T*hey
thread the needle pretty well, and
they've always had good athletes and
good speed in the midfield."
This upcoming weekend and con
tinuing throughout the course of the
season, much of Stanford's success will
depend upon the play of their goal
keepers. LX-spile lacking the experi
ence of junior Kate Horowitz and
sophomore C'arly Posner, freshman
Shane got the starting nod in the
cage against Oregon and played for all
but the final nine minutes of the 60-
minute match.
"Our staff fell Laura had a good
week prior and, overall, was the most
complete package in terms of saves and
controlling the clears," Uhlfelder said.
"She saves tough shots and makes the
stops she should make."
Shane's teammates certainly under
stand Uhlfelder's decision.
"Shane is great all-around in the
cage," junior attacker Sarah Bach said.
"She'll bait you low and stop you high.
She's left-handed, which switches you

up. She's one of the best-conditioned,
fastest girls on our team. She just goes
to the action - she's always on top of ev
erything. She's kind of fearless in terms
of coming out of the crease."
Despite that, the coaches have not
settled on a goalie for any future games,
not even for this weekend.
"Our goalies will all continue to
compete each week," Uhlfelder said.
"We're not a program that sets things in
stone."

What is known is that whoever ends
up between the pipes will have the con
fidence and support of her teammates.
"What's great about the goalies this
year is that they're really becoming
more vocal in the cage, which is some
thing we really haven't had in the past,"
Piselli said. "They're so well-condi
tioned - they're not typical goalies that
will sit in the crease. II we have the ball,
we're as happy to have it in their stiek as
in anyone else's."
