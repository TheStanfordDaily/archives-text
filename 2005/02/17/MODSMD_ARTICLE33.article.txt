## Tampa-bound team a target 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There's no doubt in anybody's
mind that when it comes to Softball
the Pacific-10 Conference is tops.
With five teams in the nation's top 10,
including No. 1 Arizona and No. 2
California, the Pac-10 season will be
by far the toughest competition on the
schedule for No. 6 Stanford (6-1).
The competition at this weekend's
USF Tournament in Tampa, Fla., will
not be as tough as in the Pac-10, but
several teams will try hard to take out
the lone West Coast squad in the field.
"Whenever the Pac-10 teams ven
ture out to a tournament like this,
whether it's Stanford or UCLA or
Washington, we have a target on our
backs and people come after us,"
head coach John Rittman said. "They
want to beat you if you're in the Pac
-10."
Stanford will face five teams, some
familiar, some new. With five more
tournaments on the schedule before
the start of conference play, Stanford
will look for solid performances from
the entire roster and will continue to
give everyone, especially the fresh

men, as much experience as possible.
"Right now, we're probably going
to utilize everybody," Rittman said of
his pitching staff. "[Laura] Severson is
obviously going to start and [Becky]
McCullough. We'd like to get [Lau
ren] Nydam some starts. Danika
[ Dukes] is looking good and will prob
ably continue in relief."
Severson, the Cardinal's junior
ace, started in two games last week
end and allowed five hits and no runs
in nine innings, while striking out four
batters. Last year, Severson had the
second highest win total - behind
graduated All-American Dana
Sorensen - and finished the season
13-8 with a 2.30 ERA and 113 strike
outs. So far this season, Severson is 4-
1 with a team-best 1.04 ERA.
Severson is joined in the circle by
two talented freshmen. McCullough
has two wins on the season, allowing
only six earned runs in seven innings.
Nydam has yet to start a game but has
allowed only one run in four innings
of relief.
Dukes, a sophomore, has pitched
three innings this season, giving up no
earned runs.
The games in the last few weeks

have given ample opportunity to get
players off the bench and into the
game, and everyone has been produc
ing at a high level.
"Everyone has been adjusting, es
pecially the freshmen, getting used to
college pitching and our game sched
ule," senior catcher Leah Nelson said.
There is a talented crew of fresh
men who have joined a team that lost
only two seniors to graduation last
year: Sorensen and fellow All-Ameri
can, catcher Jessica Allister.
"We only had two seniors and they
were really important," Nelson said.
"A lot of the other infielders and out
fielders have stayed and we've added
some new ones, so it's been fun.
We've got a lot of diversity and depth
on the team. We've got people who
can do everything. 1 think we've real
ly gotten stronger, even though we
don't have our All-Americans."
The new players have immediately
made an impact on the team. Third
baseman Michelle Smith was named
Pac-10 Player of the Week on Mon
day after tallying two home runs and a
triple with four RBI in three games
