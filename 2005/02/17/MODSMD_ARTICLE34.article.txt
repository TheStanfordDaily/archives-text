# Pac-10 play to begin
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
While the weather shows no signs of co
operating for tennis at Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium, the top-ranked Stanford
women (6-0) have no plans of caving to
their competitors in a weekend double
header.
On Friday, Stanford will open Pacific-10
Conference match play when it takes on
No. 75 Washington State (2-5). Saturday
brings a showdown against Washington (7-
1), currently ranked at No. 8
Juniors Alice Barnes and Amber Liu
beam with confidence at the Cardinal's
prospects.
"In singles, we have a deep lineup that
other schools lack," Liu said.
Liu holds the No. 1 singles position with
a 4-0 record. Two weeks ago at the Nation
al Team Indoor Tournament in Madison,
Wis., Liu matched serves and returns with
some of the nation's other top players, in
cluding Georgia's No. 10 Shadisha Robin
son (22-4) and Washington's No. 13 Dea
Sumantri (18-6).
While her match against Robinson went
unfinished, a resounding 7-6, 6-1 victory in
her first showing against Sumantri bodes
well for Saturday's match.
As the Huskies' lone ranked singles
competitor, Sumantri is a stable force on a
team saddled with the challenge of inte
grating four new recruits. Last week in non
conference play, Sumantri notched a 6-3,6-
4 win over Oregon's No. 31 Daria Panova.
Panova dominated the singles circuit for
much of the 2004 season by claiming back
to-back titles at Stanford's own ITA North
west Championship and the Husky-hosted
Pac-10 Indoor Tournament.
The conquests of Panova and Sumantri,

however, come to an end when the Cardi
nal step on the court.
This year, Panova deferred in the Pac
-10 Indoor quarterfinals to Stanford's
Erin Burdette (13-6), who is ranked at
No. 22. Burdette emerged as the champi
on. outlasting Sumantri in three sets, 6-3,
2-6, 6-2.
And much like Saturday's scheduled
forecast, Washington's chances of a bright
day on the court look gloomy. The Huskies
find their chances of success obscured by a
0-16 record against Stanford.
To further hamper the Huskies'
chances, they have the added disadvan
tage of playing California (3-0) the day
before.
C'al's recent scant team efforts against
lower echelon teams, such as Hawaii and
No. 74 Cal Poly, shouldn't fool anyone.
Stanford's cross-Bay rival has an ace up its
sleeve - No. 3 Suzi Babos.
Babos. a freshman, won her first 15 col
legiate matches and now holds an impres
sive 19-2 record. Florida's No. 2 Megan
Bradley finally put a stop to Babos' quest
for three consecutive individual titles,
handing her a 6-2,6-2 defeat at the ITA In
vitational Indoor Tournament last Novem
ber.
Burdette has had a week to recover from
a leg strain, which took its toll on her in a
match against No. 17 Margarita Kar
naukhova of Fresno State. Karnaukhova
climbed to 11 -3 as she saved match points in
second-set rut. 5-1, to pull out a 2-6,7-5,6-2
win.
While the Huskies try their luck with a
weak doubles lineup against Cal, Washing
ton State will need its best performance of
the season to overcome the Cardinal.
"In addition to our strong singles, we
also have a solid No. 3 doubles pair that a

lot of schools aren't expecting," Barnes
said.
Standing at 2-5 and lacking any ranked
team members, the Cougars' can add Stan
ford's formidable freshman duo of Whitney
Deason and Lejla Hodzic to a list of wor
ries.
Perhaps even more troublesome is the
title-winning Liu hunting down every shot

from their No. 1 singles player, Orsolya Sal
lai (6-8).
Or the thought of the Cougar's No. 2 sin
gles player, Ekaterina Burduli who will
face No. 12 Barnes (16-5), her biggest op
ponent yet.
Match play begins at 1:30 p.m. tomor
row. Stanford will play Washington on Sat
urday at 1:30.

Stanford will send freshman Lejla Hodzic and her doubles partner Whitney Deason up
against an easy Cougars lineup. The No. 8 Huskies, however, might be tougher to tame.
