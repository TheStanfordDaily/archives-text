# Card seek momentum against Matadors
## 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coming off a solid season-opening victory over
Hawaii and a third-place finish in last weekend's
Stanford Invitational tournament, the No. 3
women's water polo team (4-1, 1-0 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) looks to build its momen
tum this Saturday against No. 17 Cal State-
Northridge.
Despite last weekend's encouraging signs, the
Cardinal do not expect to become content with
similar efforts as the season wears on.

"We were pleased with our performance and
level of play, but we're working on a lot of things,"
head coach John Tanner said.
The biggest setback of the weekend for the
Cardinal came when their effort against top
ranked UCLA fell one goal short in a 6-5 loss.
"We were disappointed not to pull it out, espe
cially considering the quality chances we had in
the last minute," Tanner said.
Despite a showing that demonstrated the Car
dinal's ability to compete with one of the best
teams in the nation, the game also exposed weak
nesses that Tanner and the Cardinal hope to over

come in upcoming weeks.
"There are a lot of areas we can improve, but
that's not surprising considering it's so early in the
year," Tanner said.
At times, the Cardinal's play last weekend
might have left one wondering just how much
more they were capable of improving. The offense
averaged nine goals per game, while the defense
posted strong performances in all five games,
holding No. 10 Indiana shotless for an entire peri
od and No. 12 UC-Davis scoreless until the final

Junior driver Val Riss and the Cardinal should fare well this Saturday. Despite five strong outings the women are still looking to improve on the early season.
