# Cardinal look to clinch Pac-10 title

The saying goes, "All I needed to learn, I
learned in kindergarten." And what's the most im
portant thing most people ever learn at the age of
five? Sharing.
The No. 4 Stanford women's basketball team
(22-2, 13-1 Pacific-10 Conference) will travel to
Southern California (16-8, 10-5 Pac-10) Friday in
hopes of claiming the outright Pac-10 title.
The Cardinal have already claimed a share of the
Pac-10 title, and realistically, their fears of not gain
ing sole possession at the top of the conference are
small. USC is second in the conference with five loss
es. Therefore, to tie for the conference lead the Tro-

Jans must win out and
have Stanford lose all of
its remaining games.
With the way Stanford
has been playing, that
possibility is as thin as
the shoelace on Stanford
guard Candice Wiggin's
foot. The Cardinal are
on a 13-game winning
streak and show no signs
of slowing down. The
Stanford women are
coming off a 91-50 drub
bing of the California.
Wiggins, a freshman,
scored 24 points and ju
nior center Brooke
Smith added 20.
Aside from the
strong offensive contri
butions that the Cardi
nal expected from all
their players, Stanford
displayed an excellent
defensive effort. The
Cardinal limited the
Bears to 23.3 percent

shooting from the field.
"Stanford has not been kniftvn as a defensive
team," Cal head coach Caren Horstmeyer said
after the game. "I've watched a lot of their games,
and their defense is the reason they're able to beat
people by so many points. I really feel that their
strength this year is defense."
The Cardinal put up a very similar perfor
mance in their first meeting with the Trojans, run
ning over USC 94-58. Wiggins, a favorite for Pac
-10 Freshman of the Year, had 23 points in the
game and sophomore Kristen Newlin added 14
points from the inside.
"That's a finely tuned machine right now," said
Trojan head coach Mark Trakh after the teams'
first meeting. "Where do you beat them? They
have talent and are extremely well-coached.
They're going to be good anywhere. That's the
best team we've played all year."
It looks like cruel fate for of all the Pac-10
teams, including USC, that they must face Stan
ford's finely tuned machine twice in the season.
The Women of Troy are coming off back-to
back losses in the Grand Canyon State, falling 49-
45 to Arizona State and 87-74 to Arizona. The
Trojans never seemed to have both their offensive
and defensive weapons clicking at the same time.
USC doesn't have a true "go-to" scorer, but
freshman Brynn Cameron has been impressive of
late. She leads the team in scoring with 9.8 points per
game and is 25th in the nation with a 41.7 percent
three-point field goal percentage. USC has had eight
different leading scorers in 22 games played.
If the Trojans employ the strategy of pressing the
Cardinal offense hard early (as they did in the first
meeting), Stanford should have little trouble. The
quickness of the Stanford backcourt allowed the Car
dinal to easily break the press for transition points.
Tip-off tomorrow is set for 7 p.m. Stanford will
face UCLA at 11 a.m. on Sunday.
