## 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Appointed Tuesday as the interim vice
provost for student affairs, current Dean of
Students Greg Boardman will soon have a
handful of extra offices under his control.
Boardman will replace Gene Awakuni to
oversee the Office of Residential Education,
the Vaden Student Health Center, the Office of
Accessible Education and the Graduate Life
Office, among others. Boardman's responsibil
ities will be expanded to include all of these, in
addition to his current duties as Dean of Stu
dents.
Boardman said he will relocate to the Office
of the Vice Provost for Student Affairs a few
days before March 1, when Awakuni is slated
to leave.
It has taken the University over six weeks
to choose a replacement for Awakuni. who
announced at the beginning of December
that he would be assuming the chancellor
ship at the University of Hawaii-West O'ahu
campus.
University Provost John Etchemendy ap
pointed Boardman to the interim post this
week. It is slated to last about a year. Board
man said, while top-level administrators as
sess how the Office of the Vice Provost for

Student Affairs needs to he restructured "for
the long-term benefit of students."
Boardman sees the interim period as a tran
sition both personally and for the University's
administration.
He could not comment on the possible
changes the Office of the Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs may undergo through the course
of the planned restructuring. But Etchemendy
has denied rumors that the office will be
merged with the office of the Vice Provost of
Undergraduate Education, led by John Brav
man.
Boardman has served as Dean of Students
since he came to Stanford in December 2003.
"This is the first opportunity I have had to
serve as vice provost," he said.
Yet his previous experience at Tulane Uni
versity, where he served as assistant vice presi
dent for student affairs, has left him "very pre
pared" to assume leadership of the new office,
he said.
"I've been in student affairs for over 25
years and my previous role at Tulane had simi
lar responsibilities," Boardman added.
Among the other offices that will fall under
Boardman's control in March are the Career
Development Center, community centers, the
Haas Center for Public Service and the office of
the Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Students.
