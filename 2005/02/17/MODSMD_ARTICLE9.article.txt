# RA financial aid reformed
## 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
The Financial Aid Office is restructuring
the system used to calculate compensation for
resident assistants and college assistants to en
sure that the RAs and CAs who receive finan
cial aid are being paid for their work. The
changes will go into effect at the start of fall
quarter of the 2005-2006 academic year.
Currently, some RAs and CAs are not paid
their full stipend or not receiving any pay at all
because of their financial aid packages. Until
the 2004-2005 academic year, federal regula
tions mandated that compensation for RAs
and CAs be classified as a direct resource with
respect to financial aid eligibility.
This changed last fall when the University
took advantage of a change in federal regula
tions that allowed pay for RAs and CAs to be
categorized as student employment with re
spect to financial aid eligibility.
Residential Education and the Financial
Aid Office worked on changing the catego
rization of RA stipends for six months and
completed the project in October.
This change should effectively guarantee
that all RAs who receive financial aid will be

paid the regular amount for their RA
stipend.
"Since the RA salary went into the financial
aid calculations, some RAs who are getting fi
nancial aid don't get any extra money for being
an RA though they're doing all this work,"
Cedro RA JT Batson, a senior, explained.
Batson, who also worked as an RA during
the 2(X)3-2(K)4 academic year, served on a focus
group of RAs formed by Associate Director of
Residential Education Josh Schiller as part of
the six-month-long project.
"While we're not RAs just for that money,
the.Xact.that we get the stipend does, hefp at
tract people," Batson said. "Why would some
one be an RA if they're not paid when they
could just get another job on campus?"
Batson explained some RAs who don't re
ceive any payment could actually lose money
because of the many out of pocket expenses
that RAs must pay as part of their everyday
job. According to Batson, the focus groups re
vealed that this is a common occurrence.
Batson said that he hopes the situation will
improve for RAs and CAs beginning next
year.
"Josh has taken steps to make things better,
so we'll see how that works out," Batson said.
