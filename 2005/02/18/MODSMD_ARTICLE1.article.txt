### JESSICA ZHANG STAFF WRITER 
Much of the discussion at yesterday
afternoon's faculty senate meeting was
dominated by issues pertaining to gradu
ate students. The revised design of the
Munger Graduate Residences, the re
newal of the Master of Liberal Arts de
gree and a report on Graduate Student
Survey results were on the agenda.
At the start of the meeting. Universi
ty Provost John Etchemendy addressed
the plans for the Munger graduate resi
dence project, which will be located be
hind the Law School along Salvatierra
Walk and Campus Drive. He presented
a series of finalized plans regarding the
spacing between the three new build
ings.
Project leaders will increase the
amount of area originally set aside for
the residences, shorten one of the build
ings and reduce the height of the build
ings without decreasing the number of
floors.
"1 think this will impact the aesthetic
improvement of the area along Campus
Drive," Etchemendy said.
Eamonn Callan, chair of the Commit
tee on Graduate Studies, presented a re
port recommending that the Master of
Liberal Arts, or MLA. program be re
newed for another five-year period be
ginning on Sept. 1,2006. â€¢
Following discussion of the adminis
trative costs of the program and the need
to increase its diversity, the Senate voted
unanimously to renew the MLA program.
Next, the Committee on Graduate
Studies, along with education graduate
student Luke Miller, presented its final
report of the 2004 Graduate Student
Survey. The questionnaire addressed
nine areas of graduate life, including
coursework. academic advising, career
preparation, dissertation preparation
and Stanford's overall academic envi
ronment.
Miller said 32 percent of graduate stu

dents completed the survey, and ratings
of the nine areas varied across the differ
ent graduate schools.
For example, six out of the ten
schools had more than 75 percent of its
students reporting satisfaction with
coursework. Results also revealed that
satisfaction rates were higher for general
career preparation than for academic ca
reer preparation.
Miller acknowledged that there is
room for improvement in Stanford's
graduate programs but showed that the
students' responses indicate overall sat
isfaction with their experiences.
According to Miller, the survey re
sults indicated that, given the choice, be
tween 84 percent and 94 percent of stu
dents would choose to attend Stanford
again.
"We were looking at the satisfaction
rates and surprised at how high they
were," Miller said. "We thought they
would be lower."
Miller, Callan and others on this com
mittee stressed that these results are only
a first attempt at gauging graduate stu
dents' satisfaction.
"I'd like to ask people to think for the
future," said Grace Chang, former chair
of the Graduate Student Council."This
is a great data set. but if you make all the
proposed changes, you don't know what
will happen or if people will be more sat
isfied or less satisfied."
Following discussion of the survey re
sults, Dean of Religious Life Scotty
McLennan addressed the possible forms
that dialogue on religion and spirituality
can take in university classrooms.
McLennan said that often there is not
enough opportunity for professors at
universities nationwide to address mat
ters such as evil, suffering, death and the
significance of life in discussions of
course material.
According to a UCLA survey, 56 per
cent of students said that professors
never provided an opportunity for
students to discuss the purpose and
meaning of their lives.
"What is liberal education all
about?" McLennan asked his audi
ence. "What is education itself
about? Does it have to do with de
velopment of character? With per
sonal values and ethics?"
While many who attended the
meeting agreed that forging reli

gious life with intellectual life was
necessary, Humanities Prof. Robert
Polhemus, chair of the Faculty Sen
ate, said he was apprehensive about
religion's influence on how classes
are conducted.
"Spirituality, religion and ethics
are sometimes contradictions," Pol
hemus said. "I'm nervous about hav
ing religion influence what should
go on in the classroom."
Responding to these concerns,
McLennan said that it is important
for faculty members to talk to each
other about how to better address
spiritual and religious topics with
students.
