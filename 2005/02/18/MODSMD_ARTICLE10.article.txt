On Feb. IS, 1954, The Daily published an article about the
burgeoning theatrical performances of students on campus
in the Winter One Act plays, This date marks the beginning
of Ram's Head Winter One Acts. Below is an excerpt:
"The curtain will rise on the first performance of
Ram's Head Winter One-Acts tonight at 8:15 in the Lit
tle Theatre.
" 'The Intrusion,' by Lee Mendelson, is the story of a
completely naive secretary and what happens when she
tangles with a modern super-efficient office. Mendelson,
a creative writing major, worked with Ram's Head on
Big Game Gaieties last fall.
" The Sheriff,' the first play of journalism major
James Arnold, is a drama of 'right versus law' set in the
old West.
"[The] director is Dave Woods."
"The show will be repeated Friday and Saturday
nights. A few tickets are still available at the Memorial
Hall box office. Admission is $1."

On Feb. 18, 1958, The Daily ran an article about the
rate of continuation for students throughout four years oj
undergraduate education at Stanford. Below is an ex
cerpt:
" The annual Registrar's report, which was recently
made to president Wallace Sterling and provost Freder
ick E. Terman, stated that of the 1,268 freshmen who en
tered Stanford in the 1956 autumn quarter 89.4 percent
are now continuing as sophomores.
"The Class of 1957 showed a four year survival rate of
77.4 percent, highest since records were started in 1921.
" 'The main factor in these high survival rates,' com
mented Dr. Harvey Hall, registrar, 'is that greater com
petition for the limited number of places in the freshman
class is constantly raising our standards of admission.
Thus we are getting a higher quality of student with a
better chance of continuing to an A.B. degree.' "
