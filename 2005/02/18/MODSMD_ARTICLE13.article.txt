# But that's not the point...
## Left Handers: The Persecuted Minority No One Ever Talks About 
### 
What if two people could not sit next
to each other because of the way that
they were born? What if the segregation
of simple tools, such as scissors or power
saws, still existed in this day and age?
This is the harsh reality our society
faces today. Although we may believe
society is fair and just for all, it continues
to ostracize and subjugate a minority of
society: the Other, the Freak, the Left
hander.
I, for one, was disappointed to find
that left handers have been shut out of
most historians' lists of the most perse
cuted peoples in the world. Left handers
might not be able to top the Jews in that
area, but come on — they could have at

least gotten it to
gether enough to
make it up there
with the gypsies.
We (and by
"we," I refer to my
self) have suffered a
long history of
abuse and oppres
sion, comparable to
(though, of course,
not equal to) that

faced by Jews or Celine Dion fans.
Now, those close to me who may have
observed my handedness, may point out
that 1 am not, in fact, left-handed. In re
ality, and much to my shame, I am a
member of the right-handed ruling elite
who have been oppressing left handers
for eons.
However, when I fractured my right
hand as a child, I was temporarily forced
to live the difficult life of a left hander.
I've experienced first hand the sufferings
of these people, or "lefties" as they are
dubbed.
Even though I was only a temporary
lefty, I still faced anti-lefty prejudice in
the form of pens that smeared all over
my hand as I wrote, guitars that were
strung backwards, scissors that cramped
my hand, buttons that just wouldn't co
operate.
We live in a right-handed world.
With that fateful fracture, not only
did I lose the usage of my right hand, I
lost the privileges that come with being a
part of the right-handed ruling elite. No
longer could 1 take notes easily and pain
free — but now my hand was sore from
ramming into binder rings. No longer
was I able to sit freely and in whatever
seat 1 chose, but rather, I was confined to
sit only at the ends of rows, away from
other students.
But scissors and binders aren't the
only sources of prejudice against left
handers. Lefties have suffered a long his
tory of oppression and alienation. "Left"
was generally synonymous with "evil,"
and in most societies left-handed chil
dren were forced to learn to write with
their right hand.
Language isn't exactly sympathetic to
lefties, either. Having two left feet is an
insult to your dancing skills; left-handed
oaths are promises you don't intend to
keep; and leftovers are generally not ap
petizing.
The words "dexterous" and "adroit"
are both derived from the Latin and
French words for "right," respectively.
And the Latin words for "left"? Try "sin
ister." Even in sign language, raising
your right hand means "powerful" and
"brave," but covering your right hand
with your left means "death" and "buri
al." Will there ever be an end to the hos
tilities?
Unlike most other persecuted mi
norities, lefties have been suffering their
fate silently for years now. It's time to
end the silence. It's time to end the dis
crimination.
Where are the lawsuits? Where is the
media coverage? We need more publici
ty surrounding the trials and tribulations
of these people.
We must work to end the gross stereo
types surrounding left handers — that
they are inherently "evil" or biological
"freaks." Lefties are in no way evil or im
moral. In fact, they are generally charac
terized by diligence, pureness, and chasti
ty. I will admit, however, that initially I
did think there was something somewhat
freakish about writing with your left
hand. But that's a freakishness that I have
learned to both honor and respect.
So go ahead, world. Try to make the
"weirdos" conform to your right-handed
ways. The lefties have lived too long a
life adjusting to right-handed scissors to
surrender to the norm. I may be a right
hander, but I have the heart of a lefty.

"freaks." Lefties are in no way evil or im
moral. In fact, they are generally charac
terized by diligence, pureness, and chasti
ty. I will admit, however, that initially I
did think there was something somewhat
freakish about writing with your left
hand. But that's a freakishness that I have
learned to both honor and respect.
So go ahead, world. Try to make the
"weirdos" conform to your right-handed
ways. The lefties have lived too long a
life adjusting to right-handed scissors to
surrender to the norm. I may be a right
hander, but I have the heart of a lefty.
Left handers of the world, UNITE!

What if two people could not sit next
to each other because of the way that
they were born? What if the segregation
of simple tools, such as scissors or power
saws, still existed in this day and age?
This is the harsh reality our society
faces today. Although we may believe
society is fair and just for all, it continues
to ostracize and subjugate a minority of
society: the Other, the Freak, the Left
hander.
I, for one, was disappointed to find
that left handers have been shut out of
most historians' lists of the most perse
cuted peoples in the world. Left handers
might not be able to top the Jews in that
area, but come on — they could have at

least gotten it to
gether enough to
make it up there
with the gypsies.
We (and by
"we," I refer to my
self) have suffered a
long history of
abuse and oppres
sion, comparable to
(though, of course,
not equal to) that

faced by Jews or Celine Dion fans.
Now, those close to me who may have
observed my handedness, may point out
that 1 am not, in fact, left-handed. In re
ality, and much to my shame, I am a
member of the right-handed ruling elite
who have been oppressing left handers
for eons.
However, when I fractured my right
hand as a child, I was temporarily forced
to live the difficult life of a left hander.
I've experienced first hand the sufferings
of these people, or "lefties" as they are
dubbed.
Even though I was only a temporary
lefty, I still faced anti-lefty prejudice in
the form of pens that smeared all over
my hand as I wrote, guitars that were
strung backwards, scissors that cramped
my hand, buttons that just wouldn't co
operate.
We live in a right-handed world.
With that fateful fracture, not only
did I lose the usage of my right hand, I
lost the privileges that come with being a
part of the right-handed ruling elite. No
longer could 1 take notes easily and pain
free — but now my hand was sore from
ramming into binder rings. No longer
was I able to sit freely and in whatever
seat 1 chose, but rather, I was confined to
sit only at the ends of rows, away from
other students.
But scissors and binders aren't the
only sources of prejudice against left
handers. Lefties have suffered a long his
tory of oppression and alienation. "Left"
was generally synonymous with "evil,"
and in most societies left-handed chil
dren were forced to learn to write with
their right hand.
Language isn't exactly sympathetic to
lefties, either. Having two left feet is an
insult to your dancing skills; left-handed
oaths are promises you don't intend to
keep; and leftovers are generally not ap
petizing.
The words "dexterous" and "adroit"
are both derived from the Latin and
French words for "right," respectively.
And the Latin words for "left"? Try "sin
ister." Even in sign language, raising
your right hand means "powerful" and
"brave," but covering your right hand
with your left means "death" and "buri
al." Will there ever be an end to the hos
tilities?
Unlike most other persecuted mi
norities, lefties have been suffering their
fate silently for years now. It's time to
end the silence. It's time to end the dis
crimination.
Where are the lawsuits? Where is the
media coverage? We need more publici
ty surrounding the trials and tribulations
of these people.
We must work to end the gross stereo
types surrounding left handers — that
they are inherently "evil" or biological
"freaks." Lefties are in no way evil or im
moral. In fact, they are generally charac
terized by diligence, pureness, and chasti
ty. I will admit, however, that initially I
did think there was something somewhat
freakish about writing with your left
