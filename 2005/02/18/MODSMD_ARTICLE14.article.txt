# Cracking down on DUIs . . . Stanford gets tough
## 
### EMMA VAUGHN STAFF WRITER 
During the 19705, getting pulled over for
drunk driving was a common occurrence for
college students. The driver would be lightly
reprimanded, asked to be more careful in the
future and then offered a ride home. Seldom
would the person be brought into court or even
asked to show his or her license and registra
tion.
Today, the consequences of driving-under
the-influence infractions, commonly known as
DUIs, are much more significant. Offenders
could pay thousands of dollars spent on court
and legal fees, face jail time ranging from one
night to five years, spend numerous hours in al
cohol-education courses. And, of course,
there's an ever-permanent mark on your
record.
Drunk driving is the nation's most frequent
ly committed violent crime — 59 people are in
jured every hour.
Last year at Stanford, the Judicial Affairs
Office dealt with 27 student DUI cases. Of
these cases, 10 were committed by graduate
students and the remaining 17 were committed
by undergraduates. This year, there have been
three cases reported for the fall quarter and
three more being dealt with for the winter.
The Judicial Affairs Office only started to
consider and document DUIs as a violation of
the Fundamental Standard two years ago when
it received complaints about the University's
leniency toward the issue.
These complaints stemmed from a particu
larly public DUI case that occurred in 2002.
Local newspapers covered the case and quoted
a resident dean who said the University did not
respond adequately, or very much at all, to
DUIs.

"The deans comments caused angry reac
tions throughout the campus," said Laurette
Beeson, assistant dean of Judicial Affairs Of
fice. "At that point the University realized that
a lot of DUIs were occurring and not getting re
ported."
Beeson and other members of the Judicial
Committee have the responsibility of dealing
with student DUIs and their violation of the
University Fundamental Standard, which
states, "Students at Stanford are expected to
show both within and without the University
such respect for order, morality, personal
honor and the rights of others as is demanded
of good citizens. Failure to do this will be suffi
cient cause for removal from the University."
After the new DUI policy was enacted two
years ago, Associate Dean of Students Morris
Graves started receiving a weekly log of the po
lice activities, which he then reported to the Ju
dicial Affairs Office.
"He gives us the report, and if it is serious —
which DUIs usually are — it will go to panel,"
Beeson said. "In most cases the panel believes
that the student should get suspended, but they
also realize that the individual is going through
a huge legal ordeal. So if it is not egregious, we
usually give them a suspended suspension."
A suspended suspension puts students on
University parole so that if they violate it, they
are suspended fora quarter. However, Stan
ford's procedure is minimal compared to the
legal process the individual will have to endure
with the county court.
"If it's your first offense in this county,
you're likely to get a jail sentence of six days
and a substantial fine," said Jay Boyarsky, su
pervising deputy district attorney for North
Santa Clara County. "On top of that, there are
penalties and assessments. You could also get
your Driver's license suspended or be required

to take alcohol education classes. We're talking
thousands of dollars, not including the legal
fees you have to consider."
Along with the financial and legal burdens,
DUIs can have significant consequences for
one's future professional life.
"It's not something you can just white-out
from your record," said Deputy Ken Bates of
the Stanford Police Department. "One of the
questions that they often ask you in job inter
views is, 'Have you ever been arrested?' No
one wants to say yes to that question."
However, despite such severe consequences,
students continue to drive under the influ
ence—sometimes they are pulled over, but
more often they are not. Boyarsky said that stu
dents in universities like Stanford often do not
consciously realize that normal laws apply to
them too.
"People think, 'It's the Farm. It's Utopia.
That could never happen here,'" Boyarsky
said. "But if something illegal is going on, police
will make an arrest and bring it here to the
court. The same rules apply at Stanford as they
do in the rest of the country."
Beeson said she believes that many students
drive under the influence out of convenience.
"Often people just want to go back to their
dorm room from a party, and they figure that
because the distance is so short, it will be fine,"
Beeson said. "People just don't realize how
much of their thought process is impaired when
they are intoxicated."
DUIs in California are generally considered
to be a misdemeanor, but if anyone is injured in
the accident, it immediately becomes a felony.
This is true even if the driver is the only one af
fected.
"If you're driving under the influence and
you hit a tree and hurt your wrist, the case is in
stantly considered a felony," Bates said. "Even
if you are the only one in the car."
Although it seems that many students are
involved in drunk driving incidents, the num
ber of DUIs at Stanford and across the country
has actually been rapidly declining.
In the fall of 2003, the Stanford Judicial Af

fairs Committee dealt with 11 cases involving
drunk driving, but in 2004 that number de
creased to three. Since 1993, the total number
of fatal accidents related to alcohol in Califor
nia has decreased by more than 15 percent, ac
cording to the Mothers Against Drunk Driv
ing.
The police department offered explana
tions for the decline in DUIs, including educa
tion and stricter enforcement.
"The decrease is primarily a result of educa
tion," Bates said. "People are much more
aware of the consequences. They realize that a
DUI can have a snowball effect that will affect
you personally, professionally and monetari
ly."
Boyarsky cited the stricter and more atten
tive law enforcement program as a deterrent
for students driving drunk.
"In the last decade, there has been a huge at
titude shift," Boyarsky said. "There is enor
mous public support for DUI enforcement,
and because of that, law enforcement is pretty
aggressive and has started to take it really seri
ously."
On campus, many individuals and student
groups have taken an active role in fighting
against drunk driving.
"People are usually really responsible about
it," said sophomore Michael Lazar, who lives in
the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon. "In our
house, we have a program which designates at
least one sober driver every night of the week
end, who gives his number out to everyone."
In addition to student efforts, the Universi
ty also provides the 5-SURE service, which of
fers alternative means of transportation for stu
dents too intoxicated to get behind the wheel.
"I think that there is definitely a danger of
drunk driving because our campus is a mix be
tween urban and rural," said sophomore Becca
Schwartz. "There are distances that are small
enough so that people think it is okay to drive
after they've had a few drinks, but far enough
so that they'd rather drive."
