### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
More than 150 Stanford students will get together this
weekend for their own version of "Extreme MakeoverHome
Edition" by renovating the home of an East Palo Alto woman.
The woman whose house is being renovated is 30-year-old
Dorothy Conner, who recently lost both legs to diabetes and
has been unable to go into her backyard because her
wheelchair could not fit through the back door.
According to a press release, Conner has worked at the
Runnymede School Ravenswood School District, Drew
Health Foundation and Stanford Hospital. She has also helped
the poor, fed the hungry and opened her home to the homeless.
Mosaic, a coalition of Christian groups at Stanford, started
the "2nd Mile Project" to help Conner regain access to her
backyard. However, once the group shared the idea with the
community surrounding East Palo Alto, local businesses and
contractors, a larger project emerged.
Now, the project plans on renovating the entire house.
Local donations from contractors and businesses have donat
ed materials for carpeting, flooring, painting, new landscaping
and wheelchair accessible decks for the house.
Ron Sanders, a minister for Campus Crusade for Christ at
Stanford who is actively involved in the project, said that the
idea spread by word of mouth.
"We approached some business who we thought would be
helpful, and they were excited about giving items at reduced

costs," Sander said.
Starting this past Monday, different contractors set up the
house for the students to come in and do the manual labor over
the weekend. There will be three shifts on Saturday that will
last for four hours each, and then two shifts of the same dura
tion on Sunday. During these shifts, the students will be paint
ing, cleaning and working on the backyard. After fiill days Of
working on Saturday and Sunday, the finished house will be
presented to Conner on Sunday at 5 p.m.
The visionary for the project was Steve Stenstrom. a former
Stanford and San Francisco 49er quarterback who serves an
advisor to Mosaic. He envisioned the idea over the summer to
do a makeover of a local home, and the idea snowballed from
there.
"We talked to a former social worker in the fall, found out
about Mrs. Conner's need, got in contact with her, and we've
been organizing the details since then," Stenstrom said.
One of the reasons Stenstrom organized the project was so
that he could give current Stanford students the sam<J experi
ence he and his wife had as undergraduates many yea|s ago.
"When 1 was an undergraduate at Stanford, our mo&tmem
orable experiences were when we got away from campus to get
involved in the community, doing projects to serve people," he
said. "Our biggest goal with this project is to be serving people,
loving people and giving students the opportunity to get out of
their busy schedules and to keep life in perspective. 3

first participants in the project. She said that students involved
