## Editorial Finding safety under blue lights 
### 
Reacting to the recent assaults by intruders on
campus, the Department of Public Safety is trying to
find ways to ensure the security of students, faculty
and staff. There is an increased police presence on
campus, the ASSU is considering expanding the
Door King system and the community has become
more vigilant. That said, the Blue Light Emergency
Phone system remains one facet of campus security
that needs improvement.
From to 2(HM) to 2004, the number of blue light
phones on campus increased from 47 to 97. In the
event of an emergency, pedestrians are supposed to
be able to access these blue light phones in order to re
port suspicious activity and receive police assistance
while standing in well-lit areas. Theoretically, a stu
dent standing at one blue light phone should be able
to see the next one no more than a quarter of a mile
away. If one blue light phone is broken or the student
is forced to run to the next phone, he or she can do so
while staying along police-suggested travel routes.
While this system is sound in concept, its execution
has been deeply flawed.
The most prevalent problem is the widespread be
lief that these blue light phones do not work. Students,
faculty and staff who perceive an inactive emergency
system are less likely to use it during an emergency,
and if given the choice may run to the nearest build
ing. While running to a populated area may seem log
ical, the blue light phones directly connect to the po
lice. Should a victim need to keep running after press
ing the emergency button, the police can track which
phone was activated and respond accordingly. The
Department of Public Safety checks the status of the
blue light phones twice a month and follows up with
the proper maintenance. Nevertheless, the belief that
the blue light phones do not work deters people from
using them and this needs to be addressed regularly by

public safety officials to equip pedestrians and bicy
clists with a line of defense when traveling on campus.
Furthermore, campuswide suspicion that the blue
light phones are ineffective may increase the recklessness
and willingness of criminals to commit illegal actions.
Another problem is the number and location of
blue light phones on campus. These 97 phones are lo
cated along the police-suggested travel routes — not
necessarily the most traveled routes on campus for
students. A student traveling from the Mudd Chem
istry building and walking past the Gates, Sequoia and
Green Science buildings to a dorm in Lagunita would
never walk within 1(K) feet of a blue light phone, ac
cording to the 2(XX) security almanac and blue light lo
cation map. Judging from this map — which, unfortu
nately, is the only one available to students — it seems
that more blue light phones must be constructed so
that, as theory goes, a student at one blue light tower
can see the next one.
Given the openness and accessibility of our cam
pus, these are serious issues. Community members
should be able to see blue light phones along their
normal travel routes, not just routes suggested by the
police. Furthermore, students and staff walking late at
night need to be aware of their travel routes and en
sure that those routes are well lit. Other suggestions
for safety include traveling with someone, remaining
alert, wearing non-constricting clothes and carrying a
noisemaker like a whistle.
The Department of Public Safety needs to release
more information about blue light phones, including
their current locations, benefits to using them, how to
use them responsibly and annual reports on their
maintenance and upkeep. Combining personal safety
with an improved system of blue light emergency
phones will be an important step in ensuring and im
proving campus safety.
