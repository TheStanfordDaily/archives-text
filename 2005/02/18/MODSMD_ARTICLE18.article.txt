# Counting Sheep
## Selective Service 
### 
Six months, 17 days. That's how
long I've been 18 years old. $25(),(KK)
and five years in prison. As of now,
that's what I owe the federal govern
ment for evading the draft. 1 am a
hardnosed liberal, aren't I?
OK, OK, so maybe I'm not actual
ly a draft-dodger. After all, last time I
checked. President Bush isn't looking
to commit political suicide, and a
quarter of a million dollars makes me

weak in the knees. To be quite honest, my apparent re
fusal to register for Selective Service is grounded for the
most part in laziness, not dissent.
I recently logged onto www.sss.gov to do a little re
search, under mounting pressure from my big brother
and a five-year incarceration. And as I navigated the ex
cessively draft-happy Web site I became increasingly,
well, draft-unhappy. However, during the nervous hour
or so I spent surfing the Selective Service System, or SSS,
1 did gain a better understanding of what exactly it is that
I'm avoiding.
The most notable facet of the System (the strategic
third "S" in "SSS" conveniently differentiates it from the
Nazi secret police), is its striking similarity to the College
Board's Web site. You've got your exceptionally ecstat
ic models representing everyone from the ambiguous
blonde Asian to the Texan jock, from the token black
guy to the gawky musician. And not to be outdone,
you've got the pensive kid and the stock kid from Guam.
The only ones missing are, of course, the women.
But the uncanny resemblance to the profoundly de
tested collegeboard.com accounts for only a small por
tion of my distaste for the SSS - after all, the Board didn't
hinder my getting to where 1 am today. I guess what re
ally bugs me, go figure, is what the Selective Service
stands for - all the baggage that the draft carries, and the

idea that upon registration there's a chance I'll be lug
ging that baggage around.
The most ominous page I found on the Web site dis
cussed "how the draft has changed since Vietnam." Most
notably, "If a draft were held today, there would be
fewer reasons to excuse a man from service." Great.
Prior to a full-time student "could qualify fora stu
dent deferment if he could show he was ... making satis
factory progress toward a degree ... Under the current
draft law, a college student can have his induction post
poned only until the end of the current semester."
And thus it seems that the far-reaching tentacles of
the draft could penetrate even the durable walls of our
Stanford bubble. It is becoming increasingly apparent
that a reinstatement of the draft - the first in over 30
years - is not all that unlikely. Take the American gov
ernment's recent claims of Iranian nuclear aspirations,
coupled with North Korea's declaration of nuclear mis
sile possession, not to mention the perpetual degenera
tion of the war in Iraq.
I am not, however, an alarmist or a pessimist; I am an
idealist - a pragmatist at best. If ultimately there is a draft
in Bush's second term, which I personally wouldn't bet
on. 1 know that I will not take part. I'll be a happy Swiss
in Switzerland. However, 1 know that not everyone is
blessed with dual citizenship. Even more pressingly, I am
aware that many, including myself, are privileged or
wealthy enough to avoid the draft, as exemplified by
Bush in Vietnam. But I guess we'll cross that bridge
when we get there.
The idealistic part of me would be content to contin
ue avoiding registration - most likely, though, by the
time this gets printed I'll have given in to simple pragma
tism and, you know, legality.
