## University avoids meaningful dialogue on labor issues 
### ALEXANDRA GOLDMAN 
The Stanford Labor Action Coalition
would like to respond to The Daily editori
al entitled "Hennessy takes positive step
on labor" (Feb. 16).
First, we would like to clarify that Uni
versity President John Hennessy was not
supposed to "accept" the recommenda
tions of the Presidential Advisory Com
mittee, as The Daily suggests in its editori
al. Instead, he was supposed to transform
the committee's suggestions into meaning
ful policy. He has failed to make any poli
cy commitments and even his ideological
statements are vague.
Second, The Daily writes that all Uni
versity-employed workers on this campus

earn at least $ 11,35/ hr. This is not true.
Many directly hired workers on this cam
pus, especially those who work less than
20-hours-per-week, are paid less than
$ 11.35. For example, temporary workers at
Wilbur Dining earn only $8/hr. Addition
ally, even a single worker cannot live on
$11.35/ hr in Santa Clara County without
federal assistance, according to the Cali
fornia Budget Project, and the task of sup
porting a family on this "living wage" is
nearly impossible. The Daily also writes
that Hennessy's response should fix the
problem of the wage disparity between
University-hired employees and sub-con
tracted employees, but Hennessy's re
sponse makes no pretense of changing the
"living wage" policy in order to extend it to

the many sub-contracted workers on cam
pus. Additionally, he avoids answering
questions of wage parity altogether, and
makes no indication that he plans to ex
tend his "living wage" policy to sub-con
tracted workers.
Third, The Daily also writes that Hen
nessy's "forthcoming changes will provide
temporary and sub-contracted workers
with days off and access to English class
es." The president did not say this. Instead,
he writes that the University will provide
temporary workers with ESL classes and
days off to the same extent that these ser
vices are provided under the living wage
policy. There are no educational services
provided under the existing living wage
policy offered to sub-contracted workers.

As the University is still unaware of how
many sub-contracted workers there are on
campus, they are clearly unable to offer
services to all of them. We can therefore
assume that Hennessy's statement does
not carry much weight.
Finally, The Daily writes that SLAC's
"characteristically extreme" response
has not helped create "meaningful dia
logue." We want to emphasize our re
peated attempts to engage in "meaning
ful dialogue" with the administration. We
contact the administration several times
each month in attempts to talk with them
aboot labor concerns; however our at
tempts are usually thwarted. We feel that
it is the University who refuses to engage
in "meaningful dialogue" with us, rather

than vice versa.
The overarching tone of The Daily's ed
itorial assumes that Hennessy agreed to
implement the recommendations that his
advisory committee produced, hut in few
places does his response make any com
mitments to changing actual University
policies, and nowhere does he establish
when or how those recommendations will
be enacted. Currently, the only concrete
information we have is that by December
2006, human resources will produce a re
port â€” although it is unclear what connec
tions this report has to actual policy imple
mentation.
