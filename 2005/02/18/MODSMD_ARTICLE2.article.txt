# Washington leads Card against USC
## Men win first game without Grunfeld 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
As the Cardinal prepared for life without Dan
Grunfeld, they knew they would need something spe
cial from sophomore forward Fred Washington, who
started in Grunfeld's place. But they didn't expect this.
Washington led Stanford to a 71-62 victory over
the Trojans on a night when he seemed to spend more
time above the rim than not. scoring 22 points on a se
ries of acrobatic moves, including five dunks, against a
team comprised of a number of players that Washing
ton played against at Bishop Montgomery high school
in Los Angeles.
"I just attacked them whenever 1 got the chance,"
Washington said. "I wasn't trying to force it. 1 was just
trying to let the game come to me. I was looking to get
past my man, and get an easy dunk."
Head coach Trent Johnson said that USC's aggres
sive defensive scheme gave Washington opportunities
to get to the basket more easily.
"Going into this game we knew if USC came with
the multiple traps and presses that Fred had a chance
to have a pretty good game, just because they have
open lanes and one of the things he's good at is at
tacking the rim," Johnson said.
During an eight-point run that put the Cardinal
up 63-49 with six and a half minutes to play, Wash
ington dunked on a cross-court pass from junior
Chris Hernandez and assisted on consecutive layups
by junior Matt Haryasz and freshman Taj Finger.
But USC scored 13 unanswered points, including
three-pointers by Dwayne Shackleford. Gabe Pruitt
and Lodrick Stewart, and cut the lead to 65-62 with
2:39 to play.
Then Stanford's veterans took over. Haryasz made
four consecutive free throws and senior Nick Robin
son sealed the win with a layup with 45 seconds to go.
Haryasz converted all nine of his attempts from the
line-and scored 17 of his game-high 23 points in the
second half. He also grabbed 11 rebounds in 38 min
utes of work and did not commit a foul for the first
time this season.

Sophomore Fred Washington, who replaces the injured Dan Grunfeld, dropped 22
points on the unsuspecting Trojans in Stanford's 71 -62 win last night.
The first half belonged to Wash
ington. He took a pass in transition
from Hernandez and threw down
the game's first points on a one
handed dunk over USC forward
Jeff McMillan. Three minutes
later, he glided in fora two-handed
dunk on a cross-court pass from
Hernandez.
While USC had no answer for
Washington, Stanford could not
stop USC freshman Gabe Pruitt in
the first half. Pruitt made six of nine
attempts from beyond the arc -
many of them unguarded - on his
way to 18 first-half points.
"It was a combination of him hit
ting good shots and us not really
getting into him," Hernandez said.
"We were like, 'Let's see you do it
again.'"
Hernandez and junior point
guard Jason Haas stepped up their
defense on Pruitt in the second half,
limiting him to five points and only
one field goal after Johnson talked
about the importance of defensive
intensity at the break.
The rest of the team followed in
Washington's high-flying act, scor
ing many of its points on layups or
fastbreaks. The Trojans were not
able to slow Stanford's transition
game or stop the Cardinal inside.
Stanford outscored the Trojans 46-
20 in the paint and had 16 fastbreak
points.
"1 think it was a combination of
people working hard, like Fred or
Matt, having Nick [Robinson] run
ning the floor, and USC just not get
ting back in transition," Hernadez
said. "1 just thought our effort was a
little better than theirs."
While Hernandez struggled

from the floor, scoring just four
points on 2-for-ll shooting, he
grabbed six rebounds and dished
out six assists, including four to
Washington in transition.
"Fred's got a lot of talent, a lot of
things he's been hiding," Hernan
dez said. "He put them on display
tonight."
The Cardinal ran their way back
into the game in the first half after
freshman Nick Young made a
three-pointer to put the Trojans up,
25-16. Senior center Rob Little
made a jumper and Washington
made a shot in the lane as he was
fouled before freshman Taj Finger
sprinted down the right side, took a
pass from Hernandez and convert
ed a three-point play.
A moment later, Washington
made a steal and started the break,
passing to Haryasz fora dunk that
tied the score.
But Pruitt made two consecutive
threes, and USC took a 35-32 lead
into the half.
The Sixth Man Club was chant
ing Grunfeld's name when he
walked onto the Maples Pavilion
floor on crutches before the game.
After the game, they were chanting
"Freddie Washington."
"I'm glad I'm starting, but 1 wish
it were under different circum
stances," Washington said.
As the Cardinal prepares to play
UCLA on Sunday, it was nice to get
the first win without Grunfeld
under their belts.
"Everyone wanted to get this
one, not just for Danny, but for the
team," Haryasz said. "From now on
out every game is going to mean a
lot to us."

said. "1 just thought our effort was a

While Hernandez struggled

from the floor, scoring just four
points on 2-for-ll shooting, he
grabbed six rebounds and dished
out six assists, including four to
Washington in transition.
"Fred's got a lot of talent, a lot of

The Cardinal ran their way back
into the game in the first half after
freshman Nick Young made a
three-pointer to put the Trojans up,

made a shot in the lane as he was
fouled before freshman Taj Finger
sprinted down the right side, took a
pass from Hernandez and convert

Junior Dan Grunfeld, who tore his ACL against Cal last weekend, looks on during Stan
ford's 71 -62 victory over USC.
As the Cardinal prepared for life without Dan
Grunfeld, they knew they would need something spe
cial from sophomore forward Fred Washington, who
started in Grunfeld's place. But they didn't expect this.
Washington led Stanford to a 71-62 victory over
the Trojans on a night when he seemed to spend more
time above the rim than not. scoring 22 points on a se
ries of acrobatic moves, including five dunks, against a
team comprised of a number of players that Washing
ton played against at Bishop Montgomery high school
in Los Angeles.
"I just attacked them whenever 1 got the chance,"
Washington said. "I wasn't trying to force it. 1 was just
trying to let the game come to me. I was looking to get
past my man, and get an easy dunk."
Head coach Trent Johnson said that USC's aggres
sive defensive scheme gave Washington opportunities
to get to the basket more easily.
"Going into this game we knew if USC came with
the multiple traps and presses that Fred had a chance
to have a pretty good game, just because they have
open lanes and one of the things he's good at is at
tacking the rim," Johnson said.
During an eight-point run that put the Cardinal
up 63-49 with six and a half minutes to play, Wash
ington dunked on a cross-court pass from junior
Chris Hernandez and assisted on consecutive layups
by junior Matt Haryasz and freshman Taj Finger.
But USC scored 13 unanswered points, including
three-pointers by Dwayne Shackleford. Gabe Pruitt
and Lodrick Stewart, and cut the lead to 65-62 with
2:39 to play.
Then Stanford's veterans took over. Haryasz made
four consecutive free throws and senior Nick Robin
son sealed the win with a layup with 45 seconds to go.
Haryasz converted all nine of his attempts from the
line-and scored 17 of his game-high 23 points in the
second half. He also grabbed 11 rebounds in 38 min
utes of work and did not commit a foul for the first
time this season.

Sophomore Fred Washington, who replaces the injured Dan Grunfeld, dropped 22
points on the unsuspecting Trojans in Stanford's 71 -62 win last night.
The first half belonged to Wash
ington. He took a pass in transition
from Hernandez and threw down
the game's first points on a one
handed dunk over USC forward
Jeff McMillan. Three minutes
later, he glided in fora two-handed
dunk on a cross-court pass from
Hernandez.
While USC had no answer for
Washington, Stanford could not
stop USC freshman Gabe Pruitt in
the first half. Pruitt made six of nine
attempts from beyond the arc -
many of them unguarded - on his
way to 18 first-half points.
"It was a combination of him hit
ting good shots and us not really
getting into him," Hernandez said.
"We were like, 'Let's see you do it
again.'"
Hernandez and junior point
guard Jason Haas stepped up their
defense on Pruitt in the second half,
limiting him to five points and only
one field goal after Johnson talked
about the importance of defensive
intensity at the break.
The rest of the team followed in
Washington's high-flying act, scor
ing many of its points on layups or
fastbreaks. The Trojans were not
able to slow Stanford's transition
game or stop the Cardinal inside.
Stanford outscored the Trojans 46-
20 in the paint and had 16 fastbreak
points.
