# Washington leads Card against USC
## Men win first game without Grunfeld 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
As the Cardinal prepared for life without Dan
Grunfeld, they knew they would need something spe
cial from sophomore forward Fred Washington, who
started in Grunfeld's place. But they didn't expect this.
Washington led Stanford to a 71-62 victory over
the Trojans on a night when he seemed to spend more
time above the rim than not. scoring 22 points on a se
ries of acrobatic moves, including five dunks, against a
team comprised of a number of players that Washing
ton played against at Bishop Montgomery high school
in Los Angeles.
"I just attacked them whenever 1 got the chance,"
Washington said. "I wasn't trying to force it. 1 was just
trying to let the game come to me. I was looking to get
past my man, and get an easy dunk."
Head coach Trent Johnson said that USC's aggres
sive defensive scheme gave Washington opportunities
to get to the basket more easily.
"Going into this game we knew if USC came with
the multiple traps and presses that Fred had a chance
to have a pretty good game, just because they have
open lanes and one of the things he's good at is at
tacking the rim," Johnson said.
During an eight-point run that put the Cardinal
up 63-49 with six and a half minutes to play, Wash
ington dunked on a cross-court pass from junior
Chris Hernandez and assisted on consecutive layups
by junior Matt Haryasz and freshman Taj Finger.
But USC scored 13 unanswered points, including
three-pointers by Dwayne Shackleford. Gabe Pruitt
and Lodrick Stewart, and cut the lead to 65-62 with
2:39 to play.
Then Stanford's veterans took over. Haryasz made
four consecutive free throws and senior Nick Robin
son sealed the win with a layup with 45 seconds to go.
Haryasz converted all nine of his attempts from the
line-and scored 17 of his game-high 23 points in the
second half. He also grabbed 11 rebounds in 38 min
utes of work and did not commit a foul for the first
time this season.
