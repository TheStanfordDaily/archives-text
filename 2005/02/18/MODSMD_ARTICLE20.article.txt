## The 						sun never sets on Stanford 
### 
There is an astonishing poster that
was produced in the mid-IWOs by the
Overseas Studies Program, or OSP. It
hung for several years in the "Stanford
in" centers, faded out of use, and has
been almost universally forgotten.
Across a map of Europe, with inset
maps of Japan and Chile, there ap-

peared flags and
descriptive blurbs
of each of the past
and present centers
— favorite class,
most popular stu
dent hang-out and
the like. The
poster's title? "The
Sun Never Sets on
Stanford."
I hope it is clear

what the astonishing element was.
"His Majesty's dominions, on which
the sun never sets," was the Scot
Christopher North's 1829 phrase for
the time-zone-spanning holdings of
the British Empire. In its later, collo
quial form, "The sun never sets on the
British Empire" became a benediction
for the "civilizing mission" whose ir
ruptive forces continue to be felt, in
blood and tears and "border" disputes,
across the globe.
The poster's long life-span — ended
only upon student complaint in Novem
ber 2003 — is a regrettable testimony to
the subtle power of Anglo-derived dis
course. The poster should never have
been made, much less left up for years.
More important, the poster sheds light
on the subtle hubris that lurks behind all
forms of study abroad.
While most of the OSP's outreach
materials are as cheerful as any form of
advertising, they're marked by minor
exaggerations and overstatements.
"Exploring the Southern Hemi
sphere" and "Global Intern," for in
stance, are two student interview titles

in the 2004 outreach brochure. Grand
opportunities certainly await OSP stu
dents, but a few months of study in
Chile and Australia conform to "Ex
ploring the Southern Hemisphere" no
more than a brief position in Germany
renders one a "Global Intern."
These seemingly innocuous phrases
deserve our attention not because they
dominate OSP outreach, but because
they are the seeds from which an over
simplified worldview grows. A student
who believes she has seen the "hemi
sphere" or what a country is "really
like" in 10 weeks is ripe to draw unwar
ranted conclusions. This is how myths
and misconceptions spread, how aspira
tions to cultural literacy are under
mined.
"The measure of an education,"
Christopher Hitchens once wrote, "is
that you acquire some idea of the ex
tent of your ignorance." It is fine not to
know everything; but it is dangerous to
think you know something when you
don't.
"What's China Really Like?" asks
a Stanford Magazine piece on the new
Beijing program. It's a fair question.
But with most classes taught in En
glish, with the likelihood of some de
gree of the social and linguistic isola
tion typical of "Stanford-in" centers
and with a mere 10 weeks introduc
tion, one hopes that the "21st-century
pioneer class" enters with realistic ex
pectations and an open mind.
The poster was regrettable, and
thankfully, it is now behind us. In a lit
tle over a month, another few dozen
Stanford students will leave to study
abroad. They should be as humbled by
what they can't do as they are ener
gized by what they can.
