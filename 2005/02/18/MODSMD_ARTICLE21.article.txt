Labor action coalition should be ap
plauded, not demonized
The Daily's editorial "Hennessy
takes positive step on labor" (Feb. 16)
rightfully applauds the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition, or SLAC, for its im
portant efforts and successes, but
wrongfully criticizes it for its perceived
"radicalism," which the editorial sug
gests is part of SLAC's history of
"burning bridges." This is absurd and
demonstrates a poor understanding of
what it has taken for SLAC to fight for
change on this campus. While I am not
a member of SLAC, 1 am both sympa
thetic to and appreciative of its efforts
to call for fair labor practices.
It is SLAC's "characteristically ex
treme" activities that have gotten this
campus to a stage where a code of con
duct, living wage, equal pay, educa
tional opportunities and other im
provements are being considered by
University President John Hennessy.
It shouldn't take a week-long hunger
strike by six students to get the presi
dent of a wealthy and prestigious insti
tution like Stanford to think about its
labor practices and set up a clear code
of conduct.
Quite frankly, that is embarrassing.
Despite The Daily's criticism of "too
much radicalism," SLAC has had to
fight resistance, delays, a systematic ef
fort by Hennessy to ignore the issue.

underhanded efforts to avoid commit
ting to fair labor practices and a disin
terested student body. So, given the
history of this conflict, it is understand
able that SLAC be a bit skeptical of a
vague commitment to general princi
ples in Hennessy's response.
Hennessy's report in response to
the committee's recommendations
was released weeks late and only after
SLAC launched a blitz campaign to
demand Hennessy's response. The
Daily should be joining SLAC in de
manding transparency and fair labor
policies, rather than undermining its
efforts. The members of SLAC have
sacrificed a lot to restore morality to
the labor policies of this school. They
should be applauded, not demonized.

Freshman, Undeclared
Housing plan needed more
student input
Last week. Vice Provost for Under
graduate Eduction John Bravman un
veiled a proposal for major changes in
undergraduate housing. In planning
for these changes, the University has
not shown respect for student input
and student needs. The University
needs to get student input before an
nouncing a proposal for major changes
in undergraduate housing.

Before announcing this proposal,
the University needed to do extensive
research to find out how students real
ly want to live. Many students 1 know
do not or did not enjoy living in all
freshman dorms. Changing the hous
ing system to accommodate more all
freshman dorms may hurt the students
who do not want to live in them. All
freshman dorms may alienate fresh
men who do not want to live in a heavy
drinking environment. These dorms
may also hurt freshmen who may ben
efit from the day-to-day peer mentor
ship of upperclass students who have
had more experience at Stanford. All
freshman dorms take away the choice
that students would otherwise have. In
drawing up the housing proposal, the
university has not shown evidence of
obtaining or incorporating the views of
these students.
