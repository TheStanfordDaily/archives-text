# Groups continue tsunami support efforts

### MICHAEL TAMKIN 
Since the devastating tsunamis hit Southeast
Asia in December, undergraduates, graduate stu
dents and faculty have pitched in to aid the relief
effort. Through fundraising events, campus ad
vertisements and a provocative calendar, stu
dents have raised funds to help survivors.
One such organization is Stanford Students for
Relief, or SSR, which aims to collect $100,000 for
Save the Children's Tsunami Relief Fund. Com
prised of 15 student groups, SSR members said
their efforts have been successful.
A recent benefit event was held Feb. 11 in San
Francisco at the Velvet Lounge Club. Entitled
"Hearts Out to the World," the event was orga
nized by medical students Aadel Chaudhuri,
Nirav Kamdar and Gabriel Brat, who serves as
co-chair of SSR.
"Gabriel and 1 were looking fora way to make
a large impact on tsunami relief," Chaudhuri said.
"We spent weeks thinking of a way to make a big
impact and Nirav Kamdar suggested a party in
one of San Francisco's major party venues."
The benefit was also coordinated with medical
students from UC San Francisco.
"From our counts, nearly S(H) people attended
the party specifically for tsunami relief," Chaud
huri said.
In addition to the money raised, a huge Valen
tine's Day card for the tsunami survivors was de
signed by the attendees.
"Messages on the card include: 'Fortunately

the world is able to unite for such a cause,' Wish
ing you a quick recovery' and 'We all love you,' "
Chaudhuri said.
While this particular event was aimed solely at
graduate students, different efforts by SSR and
other Stanford groups have attracted attention.
The members of Larkin in Stern Hall, for in
stance, created "The Freshman 12: A Calendar,"
whose proceeds will be given to Save the Chil
dren's Tsunami Relief Fund through SSR.
According to co-creator and Larkin freshman
Joel Lewenstein, the calendar, which features
semi-nude pictures of Larkin freshmen, has
proved to be extremely popular.
"We've sold close to 500 calendars," Lewen
stein said. "We keep printing more as orders
come in and we're hoping to make one more big
push and raise some more money before calling it
quits."
The calendars, which, sell for $10 each, have
attracted much interest in the tsunami cause on
campus.
"So far we've raised $2,500," Lewenstein said.
"The national press coverage we've gotten is
amazing. We've been getting orders from coast to
coast and even as far away as Thailand."
Despite the tremendous amount of work that
went into the making of the calendar, Lewenstein
said that "all the response from on-campus as well
as off-campus people has been overwhelmingly
positive. It's all been worth it."
Separate from SSR, several students at the
Graduate School of Business have encouraged

their classmates to donate to the Red Cross in
honor of business student James Hsu, who died in
the Tsunami disaster.
Through e-mails and advertisements posted in
the main quad of the GSB, the students were able
to successfully raise substantial funds.
"It was all through communications," said
GSB student Jina Sohn. "We had a couple e-mails
sent out by GSB Dean Robert Joss, and we set up
a table in the common area for posters and lap
tops to make it easier for people to donate direct
ly to the Red Cross."
"Originally we had a goal of $50,(MX), and we
exceeded that," Sohn said. "We raised more than
$100,000."
The GSB students participating in the effort
said they plan to end the drive soon because the
Red Cross has begun encouraging people to do
nate to other organizations.
Sohn added that the students "felt much more
close to our effort because it was in honor of one
of our class' students."
In the meantime, SSR plans to continue raising
money for tsunami victims, and will be hosting the
last film of a Southeast Asian benefit festival
tonight in Fairchild Auditorium at the School of
Medicine.
SSR is also planning a fundraising concert with
Alpha Kappa Delta Phi to take place on Feb. 25
at Kresge Auditorium. Additionally, SSR will be
sponsoring a lecture panel featuring four Stan
ford Nobel laureates on March 1, also at Kresge.
