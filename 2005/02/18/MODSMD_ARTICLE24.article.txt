# New student group tackles Darfur crisis
## 
### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students Taking Action Now: Darfur, or
ST AND, a group committed to taking action to ad
dress political and social conflicts and alleged eth
nic cleansing currently taking place in Sudan, met
for the first time Wednesday to outline their goals.
The group was founded after 12 Stanford un
dergraduates returned from a national student
leadership conference focused on the Sudan crisis
in Washington, D.C. last weekend. Thirty students
attended the group's first meeting.
STAND'S leaders began by listing ways stu
dents can voice their opinions on the situation,
stressing that measures must be taken immediate
ly to increase awareness about the crisis in Darfur;
raise money to help victims and refugees; and de
mand political action to bring a swift and sustain
able solution to the catastrophe.
To achieve these objectives, STAND organized
students into committees to attack each of these
goals. They also made plans to sell "Save Darfur"
bracelets and contact relevant government offi
cials.
Also on Wednesday, the students who attended
the meeting wrote letters to California Congress
woman Nancy Pelosi (D-Bth District) advocating
specific policy changes, with "Stop the Genocide"
written across the backs of the envelopes. This,
STAND members said, would be one of many let
ter-writing sessions.
The group's leaders strongly advocated letter
writing as a way to create political pressure and
make change. Sophomore Chrissie Coxon. co
founder of STAND, recalled what one speaker at
the D.C. conference emphasized the importance
of writing letters to members of Congress.
"One letter and its goes in a folder." the speak
er said. "Five letters and it goes in an Excel spread

sheet. 10 letters and it goes on the agenda for the
next meeting. More than that and they decide what
to do about it."
Group members said they hope to recruit 50
students who will commit to writing one letter
every day until the crisis ends. At first, student or
ganizers were skeptical about the success of such a
campaign and said they feared they would not find
the support the effort requires.
"When we suggested it, people were initially re
sistant to it," Coxon said. "There's no way in hell
we can recruit people to do something every day,
they said. But my perspective was that there are
people who are struggling to stay alive on a daily
basis and the very least a Stanford student can do
is pick up a pen and write about this reality. Sure, it
is kind of a burden to take on this commitment
until the end of a genocide but the end of a geno
cide is worth it."
The visit of Sudanese Ambassador to the U.S.
Khidir Haroun Ahmed on Feb. 1, in part, sparked
debate among students on campus about whether
the conflict in Sudan constitutes genocide.
While such controversy draws attention to the
issue, some students say they are wary of the spot
light.
"At the D.C. conference, Sudanese intellectu
als including Omer Ismail [co-founder of the Dar
fur Peace and Development Organization] and Ali
Ali-Dinar [outreach director of the African studies
program at the University of Pennsylvania] were
very adamant that it does not matter what the
United Nations and the international community
calls it," said STAND co-founder Christina Ca
cioppo, a freshman. "Hundreds of thousands of
people are dying and are displaced and we're argu
ing about what to call and what to not call it and
doing nothing."
Many students who attended Wednesday's
STAND meeting said they were actually moved by

the lack of attention devoted to the issue.
"I came because how could you not?" said
sophomore Julie Veroff. "There's so many things
going on and you definitely wonder â€” how could
you possibly prioritize? But coming from a family
of Holocaust survivors I've always been encour
aged to take action in whatever way possible. And
the idea of being indifferent and not doing any
thing is appalling to me."
Several students said they shared Veroff s frus
tration with apathy and inaction concerning the
pressing situation in Darfur.
"I couldn't believe how quiet our campus is about
this issue because it's time sensitive and important
that we act right now," said sophomore Elissa Test,
who helped organize the event."The more I
learned, the more I was appalled and the more I
thought that we should all work to make things
better in Sudan."
The conference in D.C. was attended by over
400 students from 92 colleges.
Group members will participate in the "100
Days of Action" campaign sponsored by Swarth
more College, during which a hundred campuses
around the country will be responsible to take di
rect action each day, either by writing members
of Congress, an article fora local newspaper or
staging a protest.
Samuel Akau, a junior from southern Sudan,
said he believed that it is possible for students to
make a real difference in the Darfur crisis.
"I think there's definitely something Stanford stu
dents can do what with the peace that has been
going on right now with the south," he said. "It's
about awareness, because that would not have
happened until Americans became aware. And if
Stanford students become vocal and contact their
leaders, its possible to take the same positive steps
as the northern and the southern government have
been taking."
