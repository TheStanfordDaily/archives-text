## Jeff Dorman Sucks! Rethinking our hoops image... less brain, more absolute lunacy 
### 
My name is Spencer Porter, and yester
day was the longest day of my life.
1 dragged myself out of bed for my 9 a.m.

class, got a parking ticket
for being "parked in land
scape" ( . . . apparently
Georgia O'Keefe wanted
to paint the Suites lot),
scored a honey of a grade
on my quiz (56 percent)
and then got a computer
programming language for
a midterm score (C+). My
eyes were blurry, my bike
wouldn't change gears and

my car had a huge yellow tag on the wind
shield.
Jack Bauer lights with Baruz and CTU, 1
fight with Parking and Transportation Ser
vices.
But the worst of it was that 1 got rejected by
Bill Simmons, ESPN.com columnist, in his
Be-My-Intern contest. But because my edi
tors are all over my tail for not writing about
sports in a sports column, I'll have to get back
to this later. In the meantime, here are some
random thoughts on Stanford basketball and
beyond:
To begin, let me address the response I got
from my last column, most of which came
from Cal alumni who apparently spend a lot of
time perusing The Stanford Daily's website.
First off, get a life. If you are deriving pleasure
in your existence from quoting me out of con
text on Internet message boards, you have
much bigger problems than my interpretation
of a basketball game's officiating. I mean, one
guy sent me an e-mail that said. "You are an
idiot." That was it. Seriously, get a life and
don't bother mine.
More importantly, though, "Dragostea


Spencer Porter
Din Tei," otherwise known as "The
Greatest Dance Song Ever,"
should immediately .replace "All
Right Now" as Stanford's fight
song. You've seen the video, a fat
man on his Web cam. singing along
with the stupidest song of the year.
But just picture the Sixth Man Club
in Maples, all in unison, "A Five!
Six! Seven! Eight! Woo! Vrei sa
pleci dar nu ma, nu ma iei, Nu ma.
nu ma iei, nu ma, nu ma, nu ma iei.
Chipul tau si dragostea din tei, Mi
amintesc de ochii tai." "All Right
Now" has overstayed its welcome.
Time to get some Romanian hip
hop in the mix.
But right now, I'm really hating
our athletes always being called
cerebral - Who is intimidated by
cerebral guys? X-Men? Or was that
Cerebro? Who cares? The point is,
I'd be much more scared of a team of
"raving loons" than "intelligent
players." In that vein, can Fred
Washington start calling himself
"Tha Nasty Ass-Blaster"? It would
kill the stereotype immediately, and

let's be honest, he's the only guy on
the team that could pull it off. I'm
sure Peter Prowitt wants a nickname
like this, hut the youngster needs
time, and you have to earn this stuff.
Peter, you throw down a nasty dunk
or put up some huge blocks, and
you'll get a nickname. In the mean
time, "Tha Nasty" is my new nick
name for Fred.
As for the team, even with Grun
feld out, we still have a shot to make
the tournament, especially if Tha
Nasty can use his speed and quick
ness to drive the lane. We seem to
have problems against athletic big
men, so our best defense against
guys like Ike Diogu and Channing
Frye must be our offense. With Tha
Nasty driving at them, they'll be
forced to foul or let us get a good
look at the basket.
Chris Hernandez should never,
ever be subbed. I don't care if he is
playing with four fouls in the first
half, I want him in every minute of
every game.
Moving quickly to baseball, Tony
La√üussa is far dirtier than Jose
Canseco. Managers who knowingly
allowed their players to take
steroids should have an asterisk by
their names too.
Of course Rob Little would beat

Pete Prowitt in a fight! Prowitt
would foul out by the third round
(bada-boom).
"Million Dollar Baby" is better
than "Rocky" I, 11, 111 and V. but I'm
not convinced that any sports film
can truly overcome "Rocky IV" in
terms of socio-political impact. I
mean, "MDB" does great strides to
show a female boxer make her mark
and get her shot, but it's not exactly
ending the Cold War during the cli
mactic scene.
Taj Finger claimed that redshirt
shooting guard Kenny Brown hooks
up the most on the team. No way,
not with Tha Nasty Ass-Blaster on
the roster!
To the guy who sneered "Cell
phones are distractions!" as I was
walking my bike back home with
phone in hand: You are a jerk. You
know what also was a distraction?
The bike accident I got into 30 sec
onds before your comment. It's rain
ing, I just got impaled by my handle
bar and some helmeted jerk has de
cided to let me know of his feelings
on technology. Thanks buddy, I
needed to hear that.

Spencer Porter, a senior, is still work
ing on his own nickname. Send him
suggestions at porters@stanford.edu.
