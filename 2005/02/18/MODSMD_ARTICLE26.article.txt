# Stanford squash teams making strides

### ALEXIS PETERSON 
Today, the Stanford women's
squash team enters the first day
of competition at the Howe Cup
Nationals at Princeton. There, at
the largest gathering of female
squash players in the world,
Stanford has the chance to show
just how far it has come in four
years.
How far is that? Going into
Nationals, the Stanford women
are ranked 20th. Last year, they
finished at No. 28. And four
years ago, a women's team did
not even exist.
Suzi Smith is a senior and a
mainstay of the program. During
her freshman year she had to
play for the men's team. A lead
er in a budding women's pro
gram, she played an important
role this year as the team's No. 3
player. Sidelined for Nationals
with a chronic back problem.
Smith's commanding presence
will be missed.
Without its No. 3, the squash
team will be forced to have its No.
4 player step up. Stanford's No. 4
will play the competition's No. 3,
causing a chain reaction down the
team's ranking ladder. The real
question is how this will ultimate
ly impact the team's perfor
mance.
Coach Mark Talbott, often
acknowledged as the greatest
player in American history and
arguably the best college coach
around, remains unfailingly
positive.
"We have pretty good
depth," Talbott said. That's one
of our strong points. Our six,
seven, eight, nine and 10 are all
about equal."
The women have demon
strated this depth throughout the
season. At Yale's round robin
tournament in January (where
the women earned their current
rank), the team turned heads
with its performance. Stanford
nearly beat Bowdoin, the No. 12

team in the country, but lost 5-4
in what senior Maisy Samuelson
called "a heart-breakingly close
match."
"The fact that Stanford al
most beat the No. 12 team in the
country is amazing to me - espe
cially given that the team was en
tirely student-run until this
year," said Samuelson, who is
the team president, as well as its
No. 2 player.
Samuelson's positive feelings
are echoed by her teammates. As
the team's potential continues to
grow, the women have their
sights set on beating Middlebury,
the team favored by the rankings
to win Stanford's division.

"1 think we can do it," junior
Cate Crowley said. "As long as
every team member plays well,
we'll be happy. We've made in
credible improvements - each
person individually and the team
as a whole."
In a very similar situation, the
Stanford men's team is currently
ranked 19th nationally. Having
graduated four seniors last year,
it might have been easy to expect
this year to be a rebuilding year.
And it was. But only if by "re
building" you mean "beating Cal
repeatedly."
It was not once, but twice that

Senior Chris Fesenmaier and the No. 19 men's squash team, despite
the youth of the program, have had a strong season so far. The
women's team heads to nationals today.
