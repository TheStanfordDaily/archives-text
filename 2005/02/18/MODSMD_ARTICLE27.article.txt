# No. 8 Cardinal to face Air Force
## 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the hope of soaring past the
competition, the No. 8 men's gymnas
tics team travels to Colorado this week
end to compete against No. 19 Air
Force.
In the last couple of weeks, the Car
dinal have faced some of the toughest
competition in the NCAA, including
top-ranked Ohio State and archrival
No. 7 California. Stanford continues to
trail the Bears in the rankings by 0.175

points.
As the Cardinal enter the heart of
their season, head coach Thorn Glielmi
said he is hoping that this meet will be a
bit of a rest and boost his team's confi
dence.
"We are not expecting too much of a
challenge, but in a sport like gymnastics
we are always challenging ourselves,"
Glielmi said.
The Cardinal have already competed
against the Falcons at the Cardinal
Open. Air Force came in fourth behind
both Cal and Stanford.

The Cardinal suffered a disappoint
ing loss last weekend at the Nakamori
Invitational in Berkeley, but returned
to the gym to work on their mental
preparation for this weekend's meet.
Although they are physically prepared,
the Cardinal gymnasts said they still
have much to work on for competitions
ahead. After last week's meet, Gliel
mi said he wanted to put more focus on
understanding that the men are part of a
team, not just performing as individuals.
"They need to know that every
score counts, every tenth matters,"
Glielmi said.

Hopefully this lesson strikes u
cord with the men, and they can
locus this weekend on putting up hit
routines.
Glielimi played around with the
lineup for this weekend's meet. He
said he is planning on resting some
of his athletes who have been com
peting and training hard, and he

hopes to give some of his men who
are on the cusp of breaking into the
lineup a chance to compete.
"Our main focus is for them to go
out there and do their job," Glielmi
said.
The Cardinal compete this Satur
day at noon at the U.S. Air Force
Academy in Colorado.
