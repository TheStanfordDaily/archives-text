# Baseball faces test at No. 4 UT
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Junior shortstop Chris Minaker and sophomore third
baseman Adam Sorgi take a good deal of pride in their de
fense. Exhibit A: Sorgi walks over to Minaker after practice
on Wednesday and grins when he overhears Minaker talking
about the job they have done on the left side of the infield.
"Left side," Sorgi says.
"Strong side," Minaker responds, and they bang their
forearms together.
Thatt is their motto this year, which is fitting because the rest
of the team is also focusing on defense after losing five big
bats from last year's lineup. That team was built for scoring
runs, pounding 96 homers - six shy of the Stanford single
season record - and consistently burying teams with a bar
rage of runs, crossing the plate 8.3 times per game and giving
the pitchers a big cushion. This team is less prolific, and it will
put the maxim that pitching and defense win championships
to the test.
What better team to try out the model against than No. 4
Texas (7-0) and head coach Augie Garrido, the winningest
coach in NCAA Division I history and the owner of four na
tional championships, one from each decade since the 19705.
The Cardinal will travel to Austin this weekend to contend
with the Longhorns and their rowdy fans.
"I've know Augie for 35 years," Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess said. "He's a good friend, and we've always
played his teams, when he was at San Francisco State, Cal
Poly, Cal State Fullerton and now Texas. It is always a great
test to play his teams, especially [in Texas]."
The Cardinal cannot afford to make any miscues in the
field against a Texas team that allows a scant 2.6 runs per
game.
Stanford's infielders have gotten a lot of dirt on their jer
seys from making diving plays, but their fielding record is
near spotless. The infielders have committed only one error
this year, and Sorgi and Minaker have shored up the left side
of the diamond.
"I think we are real steady," Sorgi said. "We try to make
the everyday plays."
But they routinely make spectacular plays as well. Sorgi

championship in their 2004 campaign.
contest against Kansas. In the same
game. Minaker dove to his right to
stop a grounder and got his man at
first.
"Our goal each and every time
out there is to be the best left side
there is," Minaker said.
"Nothing gets by," Sorgi added.
They are playing together now,
but at this time last year Sorgi and
Minaker were competing against
each other for the starting job at
shortstop. Minaker eventually won
out, but Sorgi got his chance at third
this year, replacing Jonny Ash, one
of the five position players to enter
the MLB draft. It helps that Minaker
and Sorgi both have experience at
shortstop, a position that traditional
ly requires more range, because they
can cover more ground on the left
side of the infield.
"Adam has more range than
Jonny had, which allows me to play

more up the middle," Minaker said.
Minaker covers plenty of ground
himself, a fact has allowed Sorgi to
play in at third.
The adjustment from shortstop to
third is a difficult one to make at the
college level because the hall jumps
off the bat fast and there is very little
reaction time at third. Marquess said
he thought it was the hardest posi
tion to play and that it is difficult
enough to make the transition from
high school third base to that posi
tion in college ball, let alone to make
the adjustment from shortstop.
"It's a totally different 'look
from shortstop," Marquess said.
"The ball just comes up on you so
much quicker [at third). It's re
markable how quickly he's made
the adjustment."
Sorgi said that there wasn't much
preparation he could do to get ready
to play third base.
"You have a lot of adrenaline in
the game, and you just make the play
any way you can," he said. "There's
more instinct. You can't wait for the
hop you want, it all happens in a mat
ter of seconds and you just have to

get lucky."
He also said that Minaker has
helped to ease the transition.
"It was a big adjustment from
shortstop to third base, but 1 think it
helps that we have good chemistry
with each other," he said. "1 feel real
solid with him at short, and 1 think he
feels the same way with me."
Sorgi might not be feeling as com
fortable this weekend, when Texas
fans along the third base line will be
out en masse to heckle him.
"They do their research on third
basemen," Sorgi said. "They will
know everything about me."
"They're hostile," Minaker said.
"The scary part is that it's not just
kids, it's a lot of 45-year-old Texans."
Stanford will not be able to si
lence the crowd. But Minaker and
Sorgi, and the rest of the Cardinal de
fense, will do what they can to dead
en the impact of the Longhorn bats.
In a battle of teams with stellar pitch
ing. one or two runs could make the
difference between a series victory
and a loss.
Friday's game will begin at 12:30
p.m. PST.
