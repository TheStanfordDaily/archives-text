# Baseball faces test at No. 4 UT

### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Junior shortstop Chris Minaker and sophomore third
baseman Adam Sorgi take a good deal of pride in their de
fense. Exhibit A: Sorgi walks over to Minaker after practice
on Wednesday and grins when he overhears Minaker talking
about the job they have done on the left side of the infield.
"Left side," Sorgi says.
"Strong side," Minaker responds, and they bang their
forearms together.
Thatt is their motto this year, which is fitting because the rest
of the team is also focusing on defense after losing five big
bats from last year's lineup. That team was built for scoring
runs, pounding 96 homers - six shy of the Stanford single
season record - and consistently burying teams with a bar
rage of runs, crossing the plate 8.3 times per game and giving
the pitchers a big cushion. This team is less prolific, and it will
put the maxim that pitching and defense win championships
to the test.
What better team to try out the model against than No. 4
Texas (7-0) and head coach Augie Garrido, the winningest
coach in NCAA Division I history and the owner of four na
tional championships, one from each decade since the 19705.
The Cardinal will travel to Austin this weekend to contend
with the Longhorns and their rowdy fans.
"I've know Augie for 35 years," Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess said. "He's a good friend, and we've always
played his teams, when he was at San Francisco State, Cal
Poly, Cal State Fullerton and now Texas. It is always a great
test to play his teams, especially [in Texas]."
The Cardinal cannot afford to make any miscues in the
field against a Texas team that allows a scant 2.6 runs per
game.
Stanford's infielders have gotten a lot of dirt on their jer
seys from making diving plays, but their fielding record is
near spotless. The infielders have committed only one error
this year, and Sorgi and Minaker have shored up the left side
of the diamond.
"I think we are real steady," Sorgi said. "We try to make
the everyday plays."
But they routinely make spectacular plays as well. Sorgi

Junior pitcher Mark Romanczuk will pitch tonight's game
against the Longhorns, who narrowly missed a national
championship in their 2004 campaign.
