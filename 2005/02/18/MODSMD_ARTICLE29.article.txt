# Despite injury, Yim still closing in on Olympic dream
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Freshman Tabitha Yim was a three-year
old bundle of energy who could not sit still
when she started a gymnastics class with her
brother. Five years later, she had fallen in
love with the sport and her coaches realized
that she had serious potential. As a teenag
er, Yim shortened her time at school to prac
tice gymnastics twice a day.
I ler father's dream was that someday she
would go to the Olympics.
Howard Yim passed away when Tabitha
was 13, but his dream remained alive. After
finishing fourth at Olympic trials this past
summer, it was within her grasp.
Then just two weeks before the Games,
Yim ruptured her Achilles tendon at team
selection camp. With the tendon went the
dream - a crushing setback for an IK-year
old who had just graduated from high
school.
"I cried the day it happened," Yim said.
"But I was fine the day afterward. 1 got
about 30 bouquets of flowers and my broth
er joked that they ought to be addressed to
him since 1 wasn't even sad."
That kind of resiliency did not just come
from 16 years of learning to get up after
falling off the balance beam.
Yim said her resiliency springs from
Christianity. She not only shared a dream
with her father, a Christian minister, but also
a faith that everything happens fora good
reason.
That faith was not shaken but reinforced
when her Olympic hopes vanished. Yim
does not think it's a coincidence that she
ruptured her Achilles tendon at 12:12 p.m.
and that her father was born on the 12th day
of the 12th month.
"I believe God has a plan for me," Yim
said. "Something good will come out of
what happened and 1 don't know what it is
yet, but I'm sure it's something really great.
.. I at least got to spend my last summer be
fore college relaxing with my friends and
family and going on a cruise with them."
Now that Yim's Achilles has sufficiently
healed, she is leading the No. 26 Cardinal (1 -
3,1-2 Pacific-10Conference) on the balance
beam and uneven bars. She won both events
at last weekend's meet against Arizona and
has the potential to do so again against de

fending national champion No. 9 UCLA
today at Maple's Pavilion.
The meet will showcase high-caliber
gymnastics and a hot rivalry. UCLA has
three Olympians on its team - freshman
Tasha Schwikert, senior Kristen Maloney
and senior Kate Richardson of Canada -
and a couple more gymnasts who competed
at Olympic trials against Yim and Stanford
freshman LizTricase this past summer.
Last year, the Cardinal edged out the
Bruins to win the Pac-10 Championship, but
lost to the Bruins in their dual meet and at
Nationals. When UCLA came to the Farm
two years ago, the meet ended in a tie. Not
quite Red Sox versus Yankees, hut it's about
as close to a rivalry as you can get in the
world of collegiate gymnastics.
"We're really pumped up and excited to
compete against UCLA. We know some
girls on their team and there's a good rivalry
there," said Yim, who is currently tied with
Maloney for the third place national ranking
on beam.
Since Tricase is limited due to an ankle
injury andYim is still not competing on
vault, Stanford will be fighting an uphill bat
tle fora team win on tonight. The Cardinal
have an average team score of 193.5 com
pared to UCLA's 195.4. Yim, however, re
mains focused on a team win much more
than any individual victories.
"Everything means so much more when
you're representing Stanford as a team. 1
just hate when we lose," Yim said. "My
teammates are like sisters. They are what
motivate my gymnastics... always think, 'If
they can do it. I can do it, and they're count
ing on me to do it!"'
Yim's sense of team spirit is surprisingly
strong for an athlete who mastered two indi
vidual spirts - gymnastics and figure skating
- and spent most of her time training on her
own. During high school, Yim would wake
up at 4:45 a.m. to skate, attend a couple of
classes at school, and then go for two gym
nastics workouts in the afternoon.
Instead of retreating into herself and her
individual activities, however, Yim did the
opposite and continues to do so. She has
looked to her family and church community
for support and now looks to her teammates
as well.
"Tabitha is always looking outside her
self to help other people," said junior cap

tain Natalie Foley. "She is always the first
person to jump to help someone else, to
move mats, to move the bars. She has an
amazing sense of service and isjust really fun
to be with, too."
Yim said she always fed off the loud
cheers from her mother, father and brother
at meets. Her brother would give her
peptalks before competitions and, during
meets, shout "That's my sister!" from the
bleachers.
When Olympic trials were held just 15

minutes from her home in Anaheim, Yim's
mother rented a box in the arena and invit
ed all of Yim's grandparents, aunts, uncles,
cousins, godparents and friends from
church.
"It was the best competition 1 ever had
because it was in front of all my family," Yim
said. "It was such a good way to end."
Sure enough, Yim's mother, brother and
godparents are traveling to Stanford this
weekend to watch Yim make her debut on
the Farm.

and a couple more gymnasts who competed
at Olympic trials against Yim and Stanford
freshman LizTricase this past summer.
Last year, the Cardinal edged out the
Bruins to win the Pac-10 Championship, but
lost to the Bruins in their dual meet and at
Nationals. When UCLA came to the Farm
two years ago, the meet ended in a tie. Not
quite Red Sox versus Yankees, hut it's about
as close to a rivalry as you can get in the
world of collegiate gymnastics.
"We're really pumped up and excited to
compete against UCLA. We know some
girls on their team and there's a good rivalry
there," said Yim, who is currently tied with
Maloney for the third place national ranking
on beam.
Since Tricase is limited due to an ankle
injury andYim is still not competing on
vault, Stanford will be fighting an uphill bat
tle fora team win on tonight. The Cardinal
have an average team score of 193.5 com
pared to UCLA's 195.4. Yim, however, re
mains focused on a team win much more
than any individual victories.
"Everything means so much more when
you're representing Stanford as a team. 1
just hate when we lose," Yim said. "My
teammates are like sisters. They are what
motivate my gymnastics... always think, 'If
they can do it. I can do it, and they're count
ing on me to do it!"'
Yim's sense of team spirit is surprisingly
strong for an athlete who mastered two indi
vidual spirts - gymnastics and figure skating
- and spent most of her time training on her
own. During high school, Yim would wake
up at 4:45 a.m. to skate, attend a couple of
classes at school, and then go for two gym
nastics workouts in the afternoon.
Instead of retreating into herself and her
individual activities, however, Yim did the
opposite and continues to do so. She has
looked to her family and church community
for support and now looks to her teammates
as well.
"Tabitha is always looking outside her
self to help other people," said junior cap

tain Natalie Foley. "She is always the first
person to jump to help someone else, to
move mats, to move the bars. She has an
amazing sense of service and isjust really fun
to be with, too."
Yim said she always fed off the loud
cheers from her mother, father and brother
at meets. Her brother would give her
peptalks before competitions and, during
meets, shout "That's my sister!" from the
bleachers.
When Olympic trials were held just 15

minutes from her home in Anaheim, Yim's
mother rented a box in the arena and invit
ed all of Yim's grandparents, aunts, uncles,
cousins, godparents and friends from
church.
"It was the best competition 1 ever had
because it was in front of all my family," Yim
said. "It was such a good way to end."
Sure enough, Yim's mother, brother and
godparents are traveling to Stanford this
weekend to watch Yim make her debut on
the Farm.

Freshman Tabitha Yim is still unable to compete on vault after rupturing her Achilles ten
don in the summer, but she and the No. 26 Cardinal will look to upset UCLA tonight.
Freshman Tabitha Yim was a three-year
old bundle of energy who could not sit still
when she started a gymnastics class with her
brother. Five years later, she had fallen in
love with the sport and her coaches realized
that she had serious potential. As a teenag
er, Yim shortened her time at school to prac
tice gymnastics twice a day.
I ler father's dream was that someday she
would go to the Olympics.
Howard Yim passed away when Tabitha
was 13, but his dream remained alive. After
finishing fourth at Olympic trials this past
summer, it was within her grasp.
Then just two weeks before the Games,
Yim ruptured her Achilles tendon at team
selection camp. With the tendon went the
dream - a crushing setback for an IK-year
old who had just graduated from high
school.
"I cried the day it happened," Yim said.
"But I was fine the day afterward. 1 got
about 30 bouquets of flowers and my broth
er joked that they ought to be addressed to
him since 1 wasn't even sad."
That kind of resiliency did not just come
from 16 years of learning to get up after
falling off the balance beam.
Yim said her resiliency springs from
Christianity. She not only shared a dream
with her father, a Christian minister, but also
a faith that everything happens fora good
reason.
That faith was not shaken but reinforced
when her Olympic hopes vanished. Yim
does not think it's a coincidence that she
ruptured her Achilles tendon at 12:12 p.m.
and that her father was born on the 12th day
of the 12th month.
"I believe God has a plan for me," Yim
said. "Something good will come out of
what happened and 1 don't know what it is
yet, but I'm sure it's something really great.
.. I at least got to spend my last summer be
fore college relaxing with my friends and
family and going on a cruise with them."
Now that Yim's Achilles has sufficiently
healed, she is leading the No. 26 Cardinal (1 -
3,1-2 Pacific-10Conference) on the balance
beam and uneven bars. She won both events
at last weekend's meet against Arizona and
has the potential to do so again against de

fending national champion No. 9 UCLA
today at Maple's Pavilion.
The meet will showcase high-caliber
gymnastics and a hot rivalry. UCLA has
three Olympians on its team - freshman
Tasha Schwikert, senior Kristen Maloney
and senior Kate Richardson of Canada -
and a couple more gymnasts who competed
at Olympic trials against Yim and Stanford
freshman LizTricase this past summer.
