Social Security trust fund] gets in

raises the question of whether [the
baby boomers] will have enough to
live on by unfairly burdening their
children and, therefore, unfairly
burdening their children's ability to
raise their grandchildren. That
would be unconscionable," Clinton
said.
Shoven said that politicians from
both parties acknowledge that the
current system is problematic but
differ in their proposed solutions.

order to finance retirement benefits

Today's generation of college
students should be very worried
about the future of Social Security,
according to prominent Stanford
economists. Profs. John Shoven
and John Cogan. They insist that
the Social Security program has
promised more than it can deliver
under the current system of taxes
and benefits.
Shoven brought attention to a
speech made in 1998 by then-Presi
dent Bill Clinton at Georgetown
University.

rity affects every generation...if [the

to workers who are now in their 40s,
payroll taxes on today's college stu
dents will have to be raised by 50 per
cent when they are in their 40s. Thus,
college students have reason to worry
if nothing is done.
Cogan also called Social Security "a
poor financial deal for current college
students." At current tax rates, today's
typical college student will have to live
to be 110- years-old just to receive
enough benefits to compensate for his
or her contributions to the Social Secu
rity system, adjusting for inflation.
According to estimates by the So
cial Security Administration, the pro
gram's trust funds will begin to pay out
more in benefits than they receive in
payroll tax revenue beginning in 2018.
By 2042, the trust will be empty and
benefits will have to be cut for today's
college students who will then be of re
tirement age.
Shoven explained that these fiscal
problems could be solved by either
cutting benefits or raising taxes now as
a new source of revenue.
One of the smaller but more notice
able parts of Bush's plan, Shoven said,
is to allow individuals to divert their
payroll taxes into retirement accounts.
Cogan emphasized the voluntary na
ture of these personal investment ac
counts.
"No one would be forced to put
their payroll taxes in a personal invest
ment account," Cogan said. "Any per
son who wanted could continue tocon
tribute all of their payroll taxes to the
traditional Social Security system."
Cogan also noted that the accounts
would not be as risky as the media has
made them out to be.
"Personal account investments
would be limited to broadly-diversi

fied, government-regulated stock and
bond funds to minimize risk," he said.
"Individuals would not be able to pick
individual company stocks. So no in
vesting in Uncle Wiggly's Worm
Farm."
Cogan and Shoven both praised
Bush for attempting to solve a long
standing problem that could easily be
swept under the rug again.
"Any reform of Social Security
faces an uphill fight," Cogan said. "The
safest path for an elected official to fol
low is one of inaction. Our federally
elected officials have known for 20
years that the current system faces in
solvency. Yet, they have chosen not to
act. The President gets high marks in
my book by pressing for reform."
While Shoven agreed that Bush's
plan will restore the solvency of Social
Security, he said that it was not the only
plan that would achieve the goal.
Shoven urges liberals to come up with
an alternative so that "we can have a
real debate."
One such alternative, he added,
could be a bigger program, with more
benefits and higher taxes.
Shoven said his biggest fear is that
nothing will be done and the problem
will get worse until the system collapses.
"If I was worried about any out
come, it would be that we talk and talk
and do nothing," he said.
Shoven also addressed the massive
$1 trillion dollar price tag of transition
ing to a new Social Security system. He
said that the costs are not "debilitat
ing" because the new proposals cut
benefits in the long run. Accordingly,
people will be able to pay back the
money that they are currently borrow
ing.
The reason for the extraordinary
transition costs is because the plan al
lows young workers to keep and invest
their own payroll tax contributions, in
stead of using the payments to provide
benefits for today's retirees, which is
the current practice.
