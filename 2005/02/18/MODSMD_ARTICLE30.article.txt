# Gymnastics 101

### 
Tonight's meet at 7:30 in Maples promises to
be one of the best home meets of the season.
Here are some basic tips fora new spectator:
— Women's gymnastics features four
events - the vault, the uneven parallel bars,
the balance beam and the floor exercise.
— Teams are allowed to have up to six gym
nasts compete on each event. The top five
scores on each event are then counted to
ward the team's total score.
— Contrary to popular belief, judges do not
always deduct points from a 10.0 in order to
determine a gymnast's score. The starting
value of the routine varies with the difficul
ty of the skills that the gymnast performs.
For example, only five out of Stanford's six
vaults tonight will be difficult enough to
start from a 10.0.
Some specifics to look for on each event:
— Stick the landing! Each step a gymnast
takes on landing a dismount is a one- to
three-tenth deduction.
-Stay steady! A wobble or any loss of control
on beam is a one- to three-tenth deduction.
— Don't stop! Any breaks in a bar routine
will cost three-tenths. So will extra swings or
hitting feet on the ground.
— Get up! Every gymnast must include two
skills in her routine when she completely re
leases the bar. Look for height on these
moves and don't miss Foley's lull-twisting
release move, which is called a Shushunova.
— Double the flavor! Every gymnast must
perform a tumbling pass on floor that in
cludes two different saltos. For example, a
gymnast might connect a double-back tuck
to a front tuck.
— Make connections! Balance beam is all
about connecting skills to one another.
Every gymnast must perform a series of
flip-flops on the beam. Watch for freshman
Lauren Elmore's round-off, flip-flop, lay
out series.
— Cheer loud! It's not a golf tournament. Al
though no official points are given for crowd
participation, cheering is encouraged.
