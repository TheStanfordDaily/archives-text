# Five issues and one bold dream
## Editors find themselves really, really funny 
### SAM TANZER BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION POLITICAL CONSULTANTS 
lii the three weeks since our Communist
Revolution, Intermission has undergone a
good deal of political upheaval. We separat
ed ourselves from the evils of capitalism.
And last week, we finally declared our inde
pendence from the tyranny of The Daily's
autocratic rule.
But the Communist Revolution is far
from over. Western propagandists are say
ing we've fallen behind the rest of The
Daily and that our equipment is hopelessly
obsolete. We're not saying that's the case,
but it just so happens that Intermission is
launching an ambitious .five-issue plan for
rapid industrialization.
Last week Sam enlisted the help of Sports
Editor Dan McCarthy to move the empty
file cabinets from Intermission's cubicle into
The Daily's main office. Tam looked on in
awe (or amusement) as it took the two men
20 minutes to move the heaviest cabinet a
mere 15 feet. This gave Intermission more
room to collective our Intermission Wheat
Fields and undermined the efficiency of The
Daily's operations, as the paper then had to
figure out a way to move four giant cabinets
out of the middle of its floor space. The
heaviest one is still there. (It's really heavy.)
Soon Intermission had space, but it
lacked appropriate equipment. But then
Brendan had an inspired idea: "Hey, let's
just take The Daily's stuff."
Ten minutes later. Intermission's hum
ble G4 had a partner — a glorious new G5

that Brendan decided The Daily's layout
team "didn't really need." Instead of one
computer that doesn't work. Intermission
now has two computers. (One of them still
doesn't work.)
But we were just getting started. The In
termission Bookshelf was getting in the way
of the new computer, so it had to he moved.
Despite Brendan and Sam's utmost caution,
the Bookshelf soon began to show signs of
age — first it started to fall apart... and
then it fell apart. DVDs and old VHS tapes
of failed NBC mini-series crashed to the
floor.
The Bookshelf now lies in pieces outside
The Daily office. Tam was not happy. Bren
dan and Sam thought it was fucking hilarious.
Of course, no communist industrializa
tion would be complete without the addi
tion of a comfortable red sofa. It was quite a
task to get the sofa into the Intermission of
fice. Brendan and Sam decided it would be
faster just to lift the sofa over the desks in
stead of moving the desks out of the office
to clear a path. Which was a good idea until
they got tired halfway through and had to
leave the sofa wedged four feet off the
ground between a wall and the one remain
ing file cabinet — directly above the new
People's G5.
It was precarious. It was definitely un
safe. Brendan and Sam thought it was fuck
ing hilarious.
And then of course we had to throw out
all the old crap. Which went smoothly until
someone suggested that everything made of
paper be recycled (the environmentalist
scourge knows no boundaries). But now the
Intermission office is clean, spacious, mod
ern and efficient. We even swept the floor.
In the coming five weeks, we plan to ac
celerate our industrialization process.
We've cot a series of cuest editors cominii in

to boost our efficiency. We've got fresh
blood on staff to challenge Intermission's in
stitutional memory. (We've also got the
party core to ensure the tlesh blood doesn't
luck everything up.) We've got new writers
to provide raw material for our factories.

We've got reactionary views on politics (we
yearn for the 19205).
So stop by the office and pay us a visit.
Write for Intermission. Or just come sit on
our sofa.
It's fucking awesome.


Whoa, that iron hook is so fucking Communist. And we're personally of the opinion that most anything "iron" is
Communist, so, you know, get that steel outta the picture. Who says rust ain't sexy?
