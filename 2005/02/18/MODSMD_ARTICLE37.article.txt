## Message of ‘Constantine’? Pack your bags kids, you're going to hell! 
### VICTOR FUSTE TAM VO INTERMISSION OCCULT SPECIALISTS 
Upon arrival at the AMC Mercado, where
more than 500 people snaked around the theater
in two lines, our first thought was, "All those peo
ple have to be in line for 'Constantine.' There art?
too many trailer park folk here, they can't possi
bly be waiting for something intellectual."
We were right. Luckily, we had a press pass and
were able to give the proverbial finger to the mass
es of angry chain-smokers huddled in the rain.
Of course, nothing says quality movie than
the trailers that precede it. The film was off to a
roaring start when the preview for Paris Hilton's
slutsational horror flick "House of Wax" de
buted to some chuckles, snickers and one re
ported guffaw.
Ironically, the trailer for "House of Wax"
transitioned so effortlessly into the opening
scene of "Constantine" that it took the audience
several minutes to realize the movie had begun.
However, fora film released in the venerable
drought of decent box office fare that Is the
month of February, "Constantine" comes out of
left field and delivers a movie that is surprisingly

"Constantine"
Dir. Francis Lawerence

mediocre and
not as painful
as our initial
impressions
led as to be
lieve. Grant
ed, Keanu
Reeves (as
John Con
stantine) has

about as much acting ability and charisma as a
block of wood or A1 Gore, but the film is filled
with enough witty one-liners ("A demon just at
tacked me on Figueroa"). holy weapons (Jesus
embossed brass knuckles) and demonic imagery
(not Star Jones, silly) to keep even Keanu's act
ing subdued to tolerable levels. Director Francis
Lawrence even had the foresight to spare us any
overly romantic subplot that might remind us of
the trainwreck "Sweet Novemter." Unfortu
nately. he left "cancer" in the storyline.
Though "Constantine" may seem on the sur
face to be a movie about an ass-kicking exorcist
(who's been to hell and back) selfishly trying to
do-good his way into heaven, the moral of
Keanu's escapades through hell is ultimately an
anti-smoking ad (much to the chagrin of the hill
billies that managed to get in). Constantine Is a
real jerkwad who happens to be dying from lung
cancer at the hands of everyone's favorite death
sticks. Through some deviluy and some of that
pesky thing called plot, the film might as well
have been a giant Nicorette commercial or a re
ally bad "Truth" ad campaign.
The other thing that the demonfest accomplish
es is scaring the pants off Tam. And by Tam, we
mean Victor. At every dramatic crescendo of the
soundtrack, there was a cowering gjrl peeking at the
screen through her hands, and not just because her
ears were infected by A Perfect Circle's newest sin
gle. Because of the pleasantly above-par special ef
fects (remember that our baseline expectations
were for something worse than 'The Chronicles of
Rkklick"), especially duiing the hellfire and brinv
stone sequences, the cheap scare quotient goes up
ten fold if you can suspend your disbelief. Everyone

in hell resembles
taller, leaner Golhims
from "Lord of The

Rings" except for Gavin

Rossdale, Gwen Stefani's

husband and Bush frontman,

whoplaysashck businessman Balt
hazar and provides eye candy until
he's melted by holy water.

Along with the above-average CGI, the cin-

ematography doesn't disappoint. When com
bining stop-time action sequences with unusual
camera angles. "Constantine" has some surpris
ing "American Beauty"-esque moments. The
first appearance of the title character is marked
by a shot of a slowly descending, still-lit cigarette
from the point of view of the puddle it falls into.
The audience collectively held their breath as
the embers hit the pavement. In fact, the ciga
rettes play such a versatile role in terms of differ
ing shot composition that it only seems fitting
that they play an equally crucial role in the story
(see: lung cancer).
So forget the forgettable "Van Helsing"
Send "Hellboy" to hell. Start mourning for
"Elektra." Of all the special-effects laden mon
ster / comic book adaptations released recently,
"Constantine" is one of the best. Although it
may not stay completely true to the source ma
terial (Constantine is supposed to be blonde and
British), there is one very important fact that will
make this movie devilishly successful: There are
plenty of chain-smoking rednecks just standing
in line to see this movie.

We were right. Luckily, we had a press pass and
were able to give the proverbial finger to the mass
es of angry chain-smokers huddled in the rain.
Of course, nothing says quality movie than
the trailers that precede it. The film was off to a
roaring start when the preview for Paris Hilton's
slutsational horror flick "House of Wax" de
buted to some chuckles, snickers and one re
ported guffaw.
Ironically, the trailer for "House of Wax"
transitioned so effortlessly into the opening
scene of "Constantine" that it took the audience
several minutes to realize the movie had begun.
However, fora film released in the venerable
drought of decent box office fare that Is the
month of February, "Constantine" comes out of
left field and delivers a movie that is surprisingly

"Constantine"
Dir. Francis Lawerence

mediocre and
not as painful
as our initial
impressions
led as to be
lieve. Grant
ed, Keanu
Reeves (as
John Con
stantine) has

about as much acting ability and charisma as a
block of wood or A1 Gore, but the film is filled
with enough witty one-liners ("A demon just at
tacked me on Figueroa"). holy weapons (Jesus
embossed brass knuckles) and demonic imagery
(not Star Jones, silly) to keep even Keanu's act
ing subdued to tolerable levels. Director Francis
Lawrence even had the foresight to spare us any
overly romantic subplot that might remind us of
the trainwreck "Sweet Novemter." Unfortu
nately. he left "cancer" in the storyline.
Though "Constantine" may seem on the sur
face to be a movie about an ass-kicking exorcist
(who's been to hell and back) selfishly trying to
do-good his way into heaven, the moral of
Keanu's escapades through hell is ultimately an
anti-smoking ad (much to the chagrin of the hill
billies that managed to get in). Constantine Is a
real jerkwad who happens to be dying from lung
cancer at the hands of everyone's favorite death
sticks. Through some deviluy and some of that
pesky thing called plot, the film might as well
have been a giant Nicorette commercial or a re
ally bad "Truth" ad campaign.
The other thing that the demonfest accomplish
es is scaring the pants off Tam. And by Tam, we
mean Victor. At every dramatic crescendo of the
soundtrack, there was a cowering gjrl peeking at the
screen through her hands, and not just because her
ears were infected by A Perfect Circle's newest sin
gle. Because of the pleasantly above-par special ef
fects (remember that our baseline expectations
were for something worse than 'The Chronicles of
Rkklick"), especially duiing the hellfire and brinv
stone sequences, the cheap scare quotient goes up
ten fold if you can suspend your disbelief. Everyone

in hell resembles
taller, leaner Golhims
from "Lord of The

Rings" except for Gavin

Rossdale, Gwen Stefani's

husband and Bush frontman,

whoplaysashck businessman Balt
hazar and provides eye candy until
he's melted by holy water.

Along with the above-average CGI, the cin-

ematography doesn't disappoint. When com
bining stop-time action sequences with unusual
camera angles. "Constantine" has some surpris
ing "American Beauty"-esque moments. The
first appearance of the title character is marked
by a shot of a slowly descending, still-lit cigarette
from the point of view of the puddle it falls into.
The audience collectively held their breath as
the embers hit the pavement. In fact, the ciga
rettes play such a versatile role in terms of differ
ing shot composition that it only seems fitting
that they play an equally crucial role in the story
(see: lung cancer).
So forget the forgettable "Van Helsing"
Send "Hellboy" to hell. Start mourning for
"Elektra." Of all the special-effects laden mon
ster / comic book adaptations released recently,
"Constantine" is one of the best. Although it
may not stay completely true to the source ma
terial (Constantine is supposed to be blonde and
British), there is one very important fact that will
make this movie devilishly successful: There are
plenty of chain-smoking rednecks just standing
in line to see this movie.



Upon arrival at the AMC Mercado, where
more than 500 people snaked around the theater
in two lines, our first thought was, "All those peo
ple have to be in line for 'Constantine.' There art?
too many trailer park folk here, they can't possi
bly be waiting for something intellectual."
