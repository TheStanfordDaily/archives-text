"Constantino" will undoubtedly reform Christians
faster than you can say "The Passion of The Christ."
Here's why:
1) Not only will you go to church more, you'll also stop
smoking or at least renew your vow to stop sucking on
those nicotine sticks. The angel Gabriel informs Con
stantine that he's not going to die because God is
vengeful, but that "you're going to die because you
smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 15. You're
fucked." The folks at Phillip Morris itre not happy.
2) You'll have flashbacks from"The Matrix" because
Keanu is clad in Agent Smith's clothes, also known as
the signature Mormon missionary uniform. (Book of
Mormon not included with the screening.)
3) "An angel who acts of his own volition, falls from
God's grace and then has his wings blasted to
smithereens" is a sobering scene that seems vaguely fa
miliar, but is still effective here. What's more disturbing
than wings'? The bloody stumps of wings that once ex
isted. "Dogma," anyone?
4) Pacifists and Quiikers don't believe in weapons, but
if you go Catholic, we'll hook you up with Jesus-ap
proved brass knuckles and a golden Holy Cross shot
gun that pumps out sanctified bullets. How else will you
slay hellish demons and fashion victims'? In other news,
holy water is cool again. The pope totally rocks.
5) Satan himself looks like he just crawled out of a
sleazy Vegas lounge act. complete with cheap poly
ester white suit.
That, combined with a killer soundtrack featuring A
Perfect Circle's latest gem, "Passive, "is enough to make
anyone run to Memorial Church's 4:30 p.m. mass this
Sundav. We 'll see vou there.
