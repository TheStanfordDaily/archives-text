# NEWSFLASH: 'Donnie Darko' startlingly unlike 'Donnie Brasco'
## 
### JENNIE KIM UNSUCCESSFUL INTERMISSION RETIREE 
"Donnie Darko" is to many college students what "The
Breakfast Club"was to high school kids in the '80s. Both delve
into the lives of troubled young people in novel ways: both ques
tion the authority of weil-intentioned, hut hapless adults; both
are. essentially, quirky coming-of-age movies set in the 1980s.
But of course, there are quite a few differences between them.
For one thing,"Donnie Darko" is centered on apocalyptic visions
rather than detention hall hijinks. And instead of the semi-mute
and mysterious Ally Sheedy, Donnie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal
at his absolute best) pals around with a six-foot demonic bunny
named Frank.
Originally released in 2001, Richard Kelly's sci-fi drama
wasn't a box office hit. but critical praise and word-of-mouth led
to strong DVD sales, giving Kelly the chance to craft a new ver
sion of the film.
"Donnie Darko: The Directors Cut" riiade it to theaters last
summer, and the DVD version, packed with a disc of extras, hit
store shelves this week. The updated version is 20 minutes longer
and follows a more pronounced science fiction theme, which
Kelly says is truer to his creative goals.
The movie follows Donnie, a mentally disturbed teen in the
fictional suburb of Middlesex, Va., as he begins to see visions pro
jecting the end of the world. "The Directors Cut is interwoven
with hook excerpts from the imaginary book, "The Philosophy o!

Time Travel," relating the book's philosophy to the movie's plot
in a clearer fashion than in the original. While the maneuver is
helpful for viewers trying to follow the film's mind-bendingly
complex plot, stylistically, it comes off as a bit affected.
Overall, the new version is easier to grasp — whether or not
that's a good thing is debatable. Kelly has said the movie's ending
is meant to be optimistic, and"The Director's Cut" makes this in
tention pronounced. Along with clearing up the plot, most of the
extra footage adds character depth to the film, though it would
have been cool if the DVD included the option to view the origi
nal or the updated version.
The new scenes focusing on Donnie's life at home are a wel-

come addition, if only to
appreciate the grace and
beauty that is Maggie
Gyllenhaal, who plays
Donnie's liberal, Har
vard-bound older sister
(her memorable open
ing line: "I'm voting for
Dukakis"). Other no
table scenes revolve

around Donnie's relationship with his parents, which give view
ers some understanding of how Donnie's mental illness pro
foundly affects every single interaction he has with them.
The soundtrack has be-en tinkered with a little, with mixed
Success. It's difficult to improve on Echo & the Bunnymen, whose
"The Killing Moon" opened the original version, but Kelly
makes an admirable effort by replacing it with the INXS hit,
"Never Tear Us Apart."
Other extra features on the second disc include a production
diary with commentary by photography director Steven Poster,
fan testimonials called "They Made Me Do It Too" and "#1
Fan: A Darkomentary." The features are fun to watch, but ulti
mately forgettable; Get this disc if you're a rabid fan of the orig
inal (and, let's face it, i| you've read through this entire review,
you probably are)* just so you can watch both versions. Every
one else may be better offjvith the less expensive and more el
egant original.


Donnie sports the underappreciated Unabomber-Meets-Skelator look
while his girlfriend appears appropriately mystified.
