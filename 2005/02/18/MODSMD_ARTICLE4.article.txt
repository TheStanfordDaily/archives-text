# Committee reviews Draw and housing
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Undergraduate Housing Committee,
which collects housing-related information for the
University, met yesterday to discuss the issues stu
dents have raised about the proposed housing
overhaul announced last week by John Bravman.
the vice provost for undergraduate education.
In anticipation of the meeting, the six under
graduate members of the committee asked their
classmates to informally voice their concerns
about Bravman's suggestions. The feedback they
received set the meeting's agenda, which included
the future role of four-class dorms, the proposed
relocation of Ujamaa, possible changes to the
Draw and the noise levels at dorms that would be
within earshot of construction.
In Bravman's proposed plan, Wilbur will be
converted into a freshman housing cluster con
taining about 680 bed spaces, said sophomore
committee member and spokesperson Faris Mohi
uddin. The clustering would create an island of 40
to 50 upperclassmen residing in Okada.
"How bizarre would it be to be an upperclass
man in Wilbur if you are surrounded by seven
freshman dorms?" Mohiuddin questioned.
The committee discussed possible ways to
make living conditions "more palatable" for
Wilbur upperclassmen by possibly offering them
singles to "sweeten the deal," Mohuiddin said.
Those who attended the meeting also touched
on the prospect of reforming the housing Draw.
If the "unstuffing" portion of Bravman's plan
increases the number of attractive rooms, the cur
rent Draw processes may no longer require the
complex system of preferences and priorities. Mo
hiuddin said.
The proposal to relocate Ujamaa to Florence
Moore Hall was also addressed.
If Ujamaa is moved, there is no way to avoid
damaging its role as a "cultural center," Mohiud
din said. "For the last 30 years they have had [Uja
maa] in Lag, it really has become a tradition."
However. Mohiuddin said he believes change is
a valuable part of tbe broader Stanford tradition.
"Roles of housing have changed dramatically
through the history of Stanford hous
ing," he added.
Another major concern is the di
minished role of four-class dorms in
the new housing plan. According to
Mohiuddin, many students respond
ed to committee outreach by saying
that, "since they lived in a [four-class]
house, they consider the connection
with upperclassmen invaluable and
don't want to see that go away."
However, the clustering of fresh
men will not be universal, Mohiuddin
added. "There will be scattered fresh
man who are not in that big chunk of
[all-freshman housing]."
During the construction of new
residences on the Row and else
where, there is likely to be a signifi
cant noise problem for adjacent
dorms, committee members ac

knowledged. They discussed in
stalling double-paned windows as a
way of addressing this concern, Mo
hiuddin said.
The main purpose of the meeting
was not to resolve the housing issues
but to bring together a "diverse range
of opinions" and stimulate an "open
exchange of what we have gleaned
from the community so far," he
added.
"It gave us stuff to sit on and think
about for the next time we meet,
which will be in early March," Mohi
uddin said.
The committee also includes
Rodger Whitney, executive director
of student housing, and Imogen
Hinds, undergraduate housing opera
tions manager. Representatives from
the Office of Residential Education
and housing Draw experts are also in
volved in the ongoing dialogue.
The Daily was not permitted to at
tend the meeting and other student
committee members said they could
not comment on its proceedings.
