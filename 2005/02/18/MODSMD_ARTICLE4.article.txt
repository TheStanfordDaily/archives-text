The Undergraduate Housing Committee,
which collects housing-related information for the
University, met yesterday to discuss the issues stu
dents have raised about the proposed housing
overhaul announced last week by John Bravman.
the vice provost for undergraduate education.
In anticipation of the meeting, the six under
graduate members of the committee asked their
classmates to informally voice their concerns

increases the number of attractive rooms, the cur
rent Draw processes may no longer require the
complex system of preferences and priorities. Mo
hiuddin said.
The proposal to relocate Ujamaa to Florence
Moore Hall was also addressed.
If Ujamaa is moved, there is no way to avoid
damaging its role as a "cultural center," Mohiud
din said. "For the last 30 years they have had [Uja
maa] in Lag, it really has become a tradition."

a valuable part of tbe broader Stanford tradition.
"Roles of housing have changed dramatically
