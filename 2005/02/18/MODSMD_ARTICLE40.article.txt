# MANIFESTO DESTINY: INTERMISSION'S FIVE-ISSUE PLAN
## 
### SAM TANZER BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION PARTY CHAIRS 
As the newly formed Commumission comes into being, we
have taken note of the dormant industrial capacity that current
ly hinders the realization of our publication's ultimate goals:
subverting the imperialist paradigm and spreading our global
revolution.
Thus, to revitali/e our ranks and to increase the output of our
production, we are proposing the follow ing five-issue plan to put

Commumission in a
position to properly
challenge the hege
monic status of The
Stanford Daily on
campus. Only then
can our purpose be
achieved, our mes
sage delivered and
our struggle won...
— Increase content
output b\ 4(H) per
cent. increasing the
size of Intermission
from eight to 32
pages.
— Reverse roles of
the oppressor and the
oppressed by making
Hie Daily a weekly
insert in Intermission.
— Upgrade mon
keys with typewriters
to monkevs with
Gss.

— Call on Proletariat to manufacture 30-inch flat-screen moni
tors for the people.
— Collectivize all Intermission agricultural activities.
— Spread Revolution to heavenly bodies other than ours by
landing an Intermissionary on the moon by issue nine.
— Sustain Communist Vanguard by ordering cheese pizza for
lunch every day.
— Increase production cycle of Intermission: Publish daih in
stead of weekly in order to better infiltrate resistant campus so
cial circles.
— Interview only big-name celebrities who don't suck.
— ( lit our hair in accordance with the communist lifestyle.
— Send grudge-holders to the gulags (the re;il!\ bad gulags).
Way above is an illegible Soviet manifesto, written in blood. Hey, you
know what word sounds a lot friendlier than it actually is? Culag.
