# Blood Brotherly love:
## Intermission chats with The Brothers' Jordan Billie 
### KARAN MAHAJAN ROCK ‘N'ROLL INDIAN 
ITie Blood Brothers, let's face it, is a terrible band name, so 1997, but the
Seattle quartet's been clever enough to sprout a thick shell of irony around
their moniker since then. After all. no one writes gory and violent songs with
titles like "Love Rhymes with Hideous Car Wreck" without indulging in a
smirk first. There's 110 such thing as an earnest album cover with the line
"Like a skull shaped balloon, I believe in us," scrawled across the center.
Fine-boned indie-rock fans DO NOT mosh and crowd surf for cheap hard
core thrills.
Or do they?
Check out the interview for answers, but for now I'll say this: these kids are
the Killed Bills of the indie-rock scene, playing a wicked mix of start-stop
power chords and chillingly androgynous screamery. Their latest album,
"Crimes," makes me feel as warm and mushy iaside as... shoot... Remem
ber those gorgeous fountains of blood that spurted so charitably from the

neck-holes of Uma Thurman's victims? Yes, that, exactly
Sip it up.

INTERMISSION: I'd like to begin with an incisive question.
What's your hairstyle like these days?
JORDAN BILLIE: What? Are you kidding?
INT: No.
JB: It's short.
INT: [Silence]
JB: [Silence]
INT: [Shuffles papers nervously] Well, then —let's talk about
your new record, "Crimes." How did the songwriting process dif

fer for this album as opposed to previous ones?
JB: We had a looser approach to the writing process. We overana
lyzed the songs for the last record. Mere, we tried to play on one riff
at a time.
INT: So how different did the songs end up sounding, in your opin-

ion?
JB: The songs are remarkably different. Take "USA Nails" on the
last album versus "Live at the Apocalypse Cabaret" — they're differ-

ent in structure, feel, instrumentation, drum sounds. To me it's night
and day. Take "Fucking Great" and "Beautiful Horses" — both are

chaotic, energetic, but "Beautiful Horses" uses power chords and is more
straightforward. The songs are shorter on "Crimes," as well — there's not
one song on it that goes over four to five minutes; the longer songs on "Burn
Piano Island" got tiresome to hear and to play.

INT: How did having John Goodmanson (Blonde Redhead, Sleater-Kinney)
as producer affect the record's values?
JB: The production was heavy, dense and the drums were recorded very ag
gressively. We wanted something more spacious, not aggressive from start to
finish. He's recorded with Blonde Redhead, and also worked on the last Gos
sip Record. I had a great time [working with him] and recording my vocal
parts.
INT: What do you think of the current political climate? How does politics in
fluence your music?
JB: Politics definitely influenced what we were writing about. It's a bleak time
— we have a terrible president for the next four years; a war in Iraq that's not
ending any time soon; social security ideas are completely fucked; health pro
jects are being cut back to pay for kil ling people abroad. It makes me angry and
it's certainly influenced our lyrics. Sometimes, it's all really overwhelming.
INT: Speaking of overwhelming, the thing I love about the Blood Brothers is
your proficiency at screaming. How do you manage to finish a tour without
completely damaging your vocal chords?
JB:lt's not that bad, actually. We've been doing it fora while, and we've learnt
how to support our voices. Though, sometimes I can lose my voice during a
recording session, especially if we're going for an hour and a half without a
break.

INT: What's the most bizarre thing that's happened at a show of yours?
JB: The most bizarre thing? We were playing in Dallas, and in the middle
of a song, the security guard tried to tackle Johnny (Whitney) — it was re
ally funny to watch him grab a member of the band.
INT: What are your favorite bands to tour with? Any bands you'd like to
tour with in the future?
JB: The Liars — and we've had a couple of fun tours with Kill Me Tomor
row. I'd like to tour with the Gossip and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
INT: You're all from Seattle, so I was curious what your take on the current
Seattle scene is. And, just in general, what bands have you been listening to
recently?

JB: I'm gone too much to comment on the scene within Seattle. When
I'm at home, I don't go out much. But I do like Akimbo and Shoplifting
from Seattle — and as for other bands, White Magic, Devandra Barn
hardt and Ghostface.

INT: What do you think of the reviews the band's been getting? Do you
think they do an accurate job of capturing the Blood Brothers' project?

JB: I read some of them — a lot of them are flattering, but
don't do an accurate iob of describing what we're about. It's
true of any band, really, but it's hard to complain about posi
tivefeedback.

INT: Here's your chance to set the record straight. What would
you say if I asked you to describe the Blood Brothers' sound in
three sentences?
JB: I'd find a way to dodge the question.
INT: Goddammit.
JB: [laughs]

INT: I'm still going to try to wrest this out of you. If I'm introducing
an impressionable kid to your music, what genre should I say you're
closest to?
JB: It's the wrong place to start — asking the question, what genre
can I put this in? What bands can I lump them with? As a reviewer,
you should write what you hear. Write about how you reacted to it, and
then give your thumbs up or thumbs down.

INT: To stay with the overbearing generalities, what's your goal or aim as
a band?
JB: Hie goal is to continue writing together and to push ourselves; to ex
press ourselves creatively and continue writing records that don't repeat
prior albums.
INT: Did you come up with any embarrassing band names before you set
tled on The Blood Brothers?
JB: The Blood Brothers is embarrassing enough. To our defense, we were
15.
INT: What side jobs have you guys worked to support yourselves over the
years?
JB: Morgan was a bike messenger; Jonny was a temp; Cody and I worked
at a Burrito joint fora while. I also worked at a shop selling condoms, sex
toys and lubricants. Yeah ...
INT: What was the first album you ever bought?
JB: I bought my first two records at once — Sonic Youth's 'Dirty" and
REM's "Automatic for the People."
INT: Wow, nice choices fora kid.
JB: To be honest, I was 11 or 12, and the reason I bought the Sonic Youth
album was because I liked the cover.
INT: Ah. And now that we're on the subject of visual representations — if
the Blood Brothers were a movie instead of a band, what would the movie
be like?
JB: God. It'd be like a violent psychedelic rainbow. It'd be like "Yellow
Submarine" —just more violent.

completely damaging your vocal chords?
JB:lt's not that bad, actually. We've been doing it fora while, and we've learnt
how to support our voices. Though, sometimes I can lose my voice during a
recording session, especially if we're going for an hour and a half without a
break.

INT: What's the most bizarre thing that's happened at a show of yours?
JB: The most bizarre thing? We were playing in Dallas, and in the middle
of a song, the security guard tried to tackle Johnny (Whitney) — it was re
ally funny to watch him grab a member of the band.
INT: What are your favorite bands to tour with? Any bands you'd like to
tour with in the future?
JB: The Liars — and we've had a couple of fun tours with Kill Me Tomor
row. I'd like to tour with the Gossip and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
INT: You're all from Seattle, so I was curious what your take on the current
Seattle scene is. And, just in general, what bands have you been listening to
recently?

JB: I'm gone too much to comment on the scene within Seattle. When
I'm at home, I don't go out much. But I do like Akimbo and Shoplifting
from Seattle — and as for other bands, White Magic, Devandra Barn
hardt and Ghostface.

INT: What do you think of the reviews the band's been getting? Do you
think they do an accurate job of capturing the Blood Brothers' project?

JB: I read some of them — a lot of them are flattering, but
don't do an accurate iob of describing what we're about. It's
true of any band, really, but it's hard to complain about posi
tivefeedback.

INT: Here's your chance to set the record straight. What would
you say if I asked you to describe the Blood Brothers' sound in
three sentences?
JB: I'd find a way to dodge the question.
INT: Goddammit.
JB: [laughs]

INT: I'm still going to try to wrest this out of you. If I'm introducing
an impressionable kid to your music, what genre should I say you're
closest to?
JB: It's the wrong place to start — asking the question, what genre
can I put this in? What bands can I lump them with? As a reviewer,
you should write what you hear. Write about how you reacted to it, and
then give your thumbs up or thumbs down.

INT: To stay with the overbearing generalities, what's your goal or aim as
a band?
JB: Hie goal is to continue writing together and to push ourselves; to ex
press ourselves creatively and continue writing records that don't repeat
prior albums.
INT: Did you come up with any embarrassing band names before you set
tled on The Blood Brothers?
JB: The Blood Brothers is embarrassing enough. To our defense, we were
15.
INT: What side jobs have you guys worked to support yourselves over the
years?
JB: Morgan was a bike messenger; Jonny was a temp; Cody and I worked
at a Burrito joint fora while. I also worked at a shop selling condoms, sex
toys and lubricants. Yeah ...
INT: What was the first album you ever bought?
JB: I bought my first two records at once — Sonic Youth's 'Dirty" and
REM's "Automatic for the People."
INT: Wow, nice choices fora kid.
JB: To be honest, I was 11 or 12, and the reason I bought the Sonic Youth
album was because I liked the cover.
INT: Ah. And now that we're on the subject of visual representations — if
the Blood Brothers were a movie instead of a band, what would the movie
be like?
JB: God. It'd be like a violent psychedelic rainbow. It'd be like "Yellow
Submarine" —just more violent.


ITie Blood Brothers, let's face it, is a terrible band name, so 1997, but the
Seattle quartet's been clever enough to sprout a thick shell of irony around
their moniker since then. After all. no one writes gory and violent songs with
titles like "Love Rhymes with Hideous Car Wreck" without indulging in a
smirk first. There's 110 such thing as an earnest album cover with the line
"Like a skull shaped balloon, I believe in us," scrawled across the center.
Fine-boned indie-rock fans DO NOT mosh and crowd surf for cheap hard
core thrills.
Or do they?
Check out the interview for answers, but for now I'll say this: these kids are
the Killed Bills of the indie-rock scene, playing a wicked mix of start-stop
power chords and chillingly androgynous screamery. Their latest album,
"Crimes," makes me feel as warm and mushy iaside as... shoot... Remem
ber those gorgeous fountains of blood that spurted so charitably from the

neck-holes of Uma Thurman's victims? Yes, that, exactly
Sip it up.

INTERMISSION: I'd like to begin with an incisive question.
What's your hairstyle like these days?
JORDAN BILLIE: What? Are you kidding?
INT: No.
JB: It's short.
INT: [Silence]
JB: [Silence]
INT: [Shuffles papers nervously] Well, then —let's talk about
your new record, "Crimes." How did the songwriting process dif

fer for this album as opposed to previous ones?
JB: We had a looser approach to the writing process. We overana
lyzed the songs for the last record. Mere, we tried to play on one riff
at a time.
INT: So how different did the songs end up sounding, in your opin-

ion?
JB: The songs are remarkably different. Take "USA Nails" on the
last album versus "Live at the Apocalypse Cabaret" — they're differ-

ent in structure, feel, instrumentation, drum sounds. To me it's night
and day. Take "Fucking Great" and "Beautiful Horses" — both are

chaotic, energetic, but "Beautiful Horses" uses power chords and is more
straightforward. The songs are shorter on "Crimes," as well — there's not
one song on it that goes over four to five minutes; the longer songs on "Burn
Piano Island" got tiresome to hear and to play.

INT: How did having John Goodmanson (Blonde Redhead, Sleater-Kinney)
as producer affect the record's values?
JB: The production was heavy, dense and the drums were recorded very ag
gressively. We wanted something more spacious, not aggressive from start to
finish. He's recorded with Blonde Redhead, and also worked on the last Gos
sip Record. I had a great time [working with him] and recording my vocal
parts.
INT: What do you think of the current political climate? How does politics in
fluence your music?
JB: Politics definitely influenced what we were writing about. It's a bleak time
— we have a terrible president for the next four years; a war in Iraq that's not
ending any time soon; social security ideas are completely fucked; health pro
jects are being cut back to pay for kil ling people abroad. It makes me angry and
it's certainly influenced our lyrics. Sometimes, it's all really overwhelming.
INT: Speaking of overwhelming, the thing I love about the Blood Brothers is

completely damaging your vocal chords?

JB: To be honest, I was 11 or 12, and the reason I bought the Sonic Youth
album was because I liked the cover.
INT: Ah. And now that we're on the subject of visual representations — if
the Blood Brothers were a movie instead of a band, what would the movie
be like?
JB: God. It'd be like a violent psychedelic rainbow. It'd be like "Yellow
Submarine" —just more violent.
