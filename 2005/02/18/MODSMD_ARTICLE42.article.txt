## Pinkerton hegemony threatens Communists! An interview with writer, director, composer Mike Solomon 
### JENNIE KIM UNSUCCESSFUL INTERMISSION RETIREE 
"Pinkertons," Stanford's first
original student-written and di
rected musical in over a decade,
begins its three-show run at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium next
week. Intermission talked to
"Pinkertons'" writer, director
and composer, senior Mike
Solomon, about this "grand old
fashioned American musicale"
and the future of all things artis
tic at Stanford.
INTERMISSION: So>hat is a
Pinkerton, exactly?
MIKE SOLOMON: A Pinker
ton is a person who works for the
Pinkerton Detective Agency.
The two leads of the show are
both Pinkertons.
INT: Where does the title
come from?

MS: 'Die title was the first
thing that came to me, which
is weird — it's usually the
other way around. I'm kind
of an American historian
geek, and the Pinkertons •
Detective Agency actu
ally existed. It was big in

Chicago in the lS7()s to 1890s.
Labor unions and gilded age pol
itics made fora verv interesting

Jo
time, what
with all the

two-timing, backstabbing and
strike busting. It still exists today,
but it's now more of a rent-a-eop
agency.
INT: Describe "Pinkertons" in
three grandiose adjectives:
MS: Grandiolesque, splendifer-

oils and (this is a dou-

ble-adjective) osten
tatiously bawdy.

INT: Describe
"Pinkertons" in more
than three grandiose
adjectives:

MS: It trails the lives
of two Pinkcrtons
agents who are both
very poor, pathetic
and lonely. Their
various deficiencies

make them code
pendent on each

other. They hurt
each other in a
kind of cycle of
abuse. There are
some HUGE
ass twists too —

worlds col
* lide. The
show will

stretch your

mind. It's a little mod
ern and a little freaky.

INT: How'd you get Chris Ayer
out of retirement?
MS: 1 don't know. We've worked

together in the past. I sent him a
personal e-mail, and he came to
info sessio and liked it enough to
audition. Since then, the work
ing relationship among all the
cast has gotten better and better.
He's extremely committed. He's
worked really hard to create this
original character from nothing.
UNTH What are the songs like in
the show?
MS: There are only six songs be
cause there's a lot of music that
accompanies the dialogue, and a
lot of music isn't played by the
orchestra. "Bullet Song" and
"Adam's First Meditation'' are
the two I put the most amount of
time into. They really run the
gamut from "Lullaby," which is a
lullaby, to wild fast atonal rock.
INT. If "Pinkertons" was a bas
tard child, who would be its ille
gitimate father be?
MS: Since this is the last thing
I'm doing at Stanford, the father
of "Pinkertons" is really a com
pendium of everything I've
learned as a Stanford student.
The list of composers goes from
Arensky to Zemlinsky, and
everyone in between. As far as
the psychological and philo
sophical development of the
characters and themes, I tend to
cart around 19th century Russ
ian literature — Tolstoy and
Dostoyevsky.

INTi How long did it lake to
bring the show to the stage?
MS: About four years, but the
eurve goes like this (draws up
ward curve in air that gets really
steep at the end). I came up with
the idea in high school and just
sort of put it away. I really start
ed composing for the show last
June and really, really kicked
into high gear in September.
INT: Any BIG lessons learned
throughout this process?
MS: I'm now a resolute believer
in people's capacity to under
stand things. That sounds stupid,
but what I mean is: If they don't
understand something I wrote
it's because it's not written well,
not because they just don't get it.
If they don't get it, that means
the writing is deficient.
Also, whenever I did shows in
the past, a lot of the creative
process involved going back to
the original CD or video — it's
the complete opposite to pre
miere a full-blown original musi
cal from scratch. Everyone
working on this was involved in
the show's interpretation.
INT: Were there any injuries
sustained by the cast or crew?
MS: Last week I started getting
really bad migraines. That
doesn't have to do with the cast
or crew but because I haven't
been sleeping a lot. One cast
member lived through getting
her car totaled — 1 mean it was

compressed—last week. I figure
if she can make it through that,
we can make it through every
thing.
INT: What's your favorite color?
MS: Green — Jets green.
INT: Did you know that the guy
who wrote the last student musi
cal at Stanford (about 14 years
ago) ended up marrying the
woman he wrote it with?
MS: Really? I wrote "Pinker
tons" by myself... Hopefully
that doesn't mean I'll be alone
and pathetic for the rest of my
life. The fact that it's taken 14
years for someone to write an
other one is sad. If the campus
really rallies behind the arts and
gets excited about a project, stu
dents can put on another original
show as early as next year. I real
ly hope this trend continues at
Stanford; that people who have
ideas can get a team together,
pitch the ideas to get the funding
needed to put it on. then make it
a reality.
There are phenomenal ways
that artists can contribute to the
Stanford community. It's not just
about creating new knowledge
through academic research. Cre
ating a new painting can con
tribute just as much as writing an
essay.
