### BONNIE JOHNSON INTERMISSION MUSIC HUNTER MAJORING IN ROCKSTAR STUDIES: UP COMING TALENT 
Last quarter 1 issued a call for demos from
unsigned campus artists. These two brave
bands answered.
After Effect: Geologists dig hard rock
After Effect is a hard rock band com
prised of four Stanford students. Ryan
Junee (vocals, guitar) is a master's student in
electrical engineering from Sydney, Bryan
Kerr (lead guitar) is a Ph.D student in geo
physics from Redwood City, Brian Romans
(drums) is a doctoral student in geological
and environmental sciences from Buffalo
and Dianna Ferrand (bass, backup vocals) is
a senior majoring in geology from Atlanta.
All four live on campus. Bryan, Brian and
Ryan met at Stanford in the fall of 2003, and
when Brian met Dianna while doing field
work in Chile last March, the band was com
plete. Bryan said about Dianna's bass: "The
first time she played with us she blew us
away. She has a very melodic and punchy
style, and it gave our music the extra life that
it was missing."
You might have seen After Effect at
Rains, Chi Theta Chi. Columbae and the
Graduate Community Center. They
played at the Graduate Student Council's

past tsunami relief benefit as well as a Bat
tle of the Bands at PoundSF. When asked
about the band's plans, Ryan answered.
"Right now we're focused on getting gigs
around the Bay Area and playing as much
as school will allow. We're not going balls
out to get signed by a label, but we'd defi
nitely listen if someone approached us.
Whatever happens happens."
While the members of After Effect pre
fer to play their original material, they some
times play covers for campus shows. Their
favorites include songs by Pearl Jam, Au
dioslave, Franz Ferdinand, Pete Murray and
Jet. When asked about their influences, they
named Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Led Zeppelin.
The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden,
Audioslave and Chris Cornell in general, as
well as Les Claypool (Primus), Jon Fishman
(Phish) and Scott Stapp (Creed), among
others.
"What gets me most excited about writing
and playing music is how the audience reacts
to it," Ryan said. "I love to hear that people
have really identified with songs 1 have writ
ten." Bryan added, "The best moments are
those when the band starts feeding of each
other... Those brief moments of nirvana
are what 1 play for."
Visit After Effect's website at www.after
effect.net to hear the demo EP and other
recordings. Their songs have played on
KZSU in the past, so call the DJ and put in a
request.

Father Octopus is primarily the studio pro
ject of junior Geoff Pitsch, a math major at
Stanford. Geoff is originally from Virginia and
he works at KZSU. Over the summer, he put
together Father Octopus" debut EP, "Sub-
Manifold," with his guitar, a piano, a little help
from his friends and a whole lot of help from
his computer. "Almost all the albums I love
are characterized by creative production that
often blurs what it means to simulate a live per
formance," Geoff said. "It may not be feasible
to have 20 guys with guitars on stage playing

the same chord, but on a well-produced album,
technology can make these fantastical situa
tions seem possible."
After recording his EP in a professional
studio, Geoff was pleased enough with the
results to consider marketing the music. He
is currently working on Father Octopus'
stage show, which is a challenge given the
nature of the act. "I really want to bring the
complexity of my recorded music to the live
show, so that requires preparing a ton of pre
recorded material. On the other hand, I
don't want to just do karaoke over my
album," Geoff explained.
Father Octopus draws on industrial, grunge
and classic rock. Geoff described his dark
sound as being most like Nine Inch Nails or
Tool and includes Smashing Pumpkins, Ra
diohead and Autechre among his influences.
Of the six tracks on Father Octopus' EP, three
are instrumental. Geoff conceded that "Father
Octopus is not traditional party music, though
it is in my own little world."
Geoff said rock music was a welcome
respite from the Stanford mentality. "Acade
mic life gets pretty dry in my opinion," he said.
"Working on music lets you tap into some
thing that isn't naturally encouraged much on
campus."
Visit Father Octopus' website at www.fa
theroctopus.com to download "Sub-Mani
fold" and to join the email list. And as Geoff
advised, "Listen to music until your head ex
plodes. It's an honorable death."
