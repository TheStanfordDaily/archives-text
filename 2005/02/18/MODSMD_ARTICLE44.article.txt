# BEN LEE SAYS: DON'T PRESS SNOOZE
## 
### TAM VO INTERMISSION CAFFEINE ADDICT 
When you were 14, you were conquering Alge
bra 11. listening to The Cardigans and trying to tell
your crush you liked him. You couldn't wait for high
school to be over. When Ben Lee was 14, he was
causing a commotion with the pop punk band Noise
Addict, discovered by The Beastie Boys and Sonic
Youth. He couldn't wait to make more music.
You are now 20 and walking away from an awk
ward trainwreck of emotions. Ben Lee is 26 and
walking away from a long relationship with '90s
teen queen Claire Danes. Both of you are trying to
leave naivete and angsty adolescence behind. Both
of you want to wake up to something new.
In an ideal world, you'd cross the next street
and run into Ben Lee. Unfortunately for you,
he's in the other hemisphere (Australia) and
you are here, trying not to trip over a drunken
bum on University Avenue.
The good news is that his quirky rhythms, in
fectious choruses and existential pop melodies
are exactly what you need right now. This is Ben
Ix s e's fifth album and the first one that you've lis
tened to in its entirety. He's the third wheel of The
Bens tricycle that includes Folds and Kweller, the
Ben that no one can ever remember. All that is
about to change, and it's about time.
This definitive release dismisses anv notions

that Lee's boyish charms (there's something
about those Bens) and songwriting sensibilities
have faded with age. He's recovered from 2003's
unremarkable "Hey You, Yes You," a strained
album that lacks the ease and flow of this one. "I
used to be fighting the world — trying to prove
something to someone (though I can't for the
life of me remember what I had to prove, and to
whom)," he explains. Hmm. Sounds familiar.
You'll find yourself nodding in agreement as
Ben urges you to "just do it. whatever it is, whatev
er it is" in the opening track (aptly titled "Whatev
er- It Is."). 'Hie lilting guitar aipeggios seep into
your stream of consciousness, but this lullaby has a
twist: Awake is the new sleep, so do yourself a

favor — stop hitting
the snooze button.
Fourteen tracks melt
effortlessly together, as
if they were nestled lev
getlier in the same note
book. Lee confesses
that these songs came
quickly, that he "just
tried to get out of their

way." Remember that the next time the Marguerite
nearly runs you over.
"Catch My Disease" is easily the most upbeat
track on the record, complete with toy xylophone
fills, handclaps and a chorus that demands you sing

along. Even the verses have backup harmonies.
Lee's strongest songs are of the three-chord
variety, from the cheery tune of'into The Dark"
and the soaring piano countermelodies of
"Begin." Streaks of maturity emerge halfway
through the album, as he croons "Open the door
to another world / Of lovers and whores / But
I've loved you more" on "Close I've Come."

Even if we don't
buy it completely,
Move along, there's
no bitterness to be
found here, folks.
With tightly craft
ed, more pensive
songs like "Apple
Candy" and"The
Debt Collectors"

comes heightened emotion that was lacking in. By
the time Ben gathers all of his friends (including
Jason Schwartzman and members of Rilo Kiiey)
for the sunshiny swelling melodies of "We're All
In This Together" you're ready to dance.
There's something comforting about the way
the album builds intimacy through repetition. A
simple hook repeated endlessly becomes sooth
ing. (The man could revolutionize elementary
school by setting the multiplication tables to
music.) Lyrics that might not be brilliant become
somehow affirming in their straightforward hon

esty. The album's journey ends appropriately
with just Ben and his guitar — when other instru
ments drop out, his rocksteady songwriting
shines.
"Awake Is The New Sleep" is the belated
valentine you wish you'd gotten a few days ago.

With his newest release, Ben Lee makes waking
up early and braving the winter rain to check
your mailbox worth it. Somehow, arriving late is
better than arriving on time.
Ben Lee's "A wake is the New Sleep " hits the deck
on Feb. 22. That's Feb. 28 for you Aussies.




Ben Lee is the new Ben Folds. I mean, Ben Kweller. I
mean, Ben Stein.
