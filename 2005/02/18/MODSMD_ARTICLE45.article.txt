# Roxy: Golden numbers, not showers
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
"Arcadia" is an esoteric novel if
there ever was one — except, of
course, to that occasional high
school English teacher from UC
Davis who liked women that he de
scribed as "buxom" (NOT
"bosom," a mistake Roxy won't
make again in class). The book dis
cusses how everything in life finds

its roots in numbers. Everything.
And this doesn't just apply to the
rows of cornfields that make pat
terns that the heavy-breather who
took your window seat looks at be
fore wheezing. "50... [GASPJ...
pretty [GASP]." Even human be
havior can be described through
complicated formulas where y
(your fun factor outcome at an SAE
party) is regressed on factors such as
xl (your age), x2 (looks, given beer

goggles). x3 (cups of Natty Light
you intake), x4 (times you've al
ready gotten ass this quarter), x5
(frat house sanitation, or lack there
of) and so on.
Even more interesting is the
Golden Rule. Just like the swirls of
a seashell or the nautilus of a flower,
so the human eye is most pleased by
a ratio of .618:1. Take the length
from the top of the head to the navel
and the length from navel to the

toes. .618:1. Length from foot to
knee and length from knee to navel:

same thing. Even length
from top of the head down
to your throat . . . well,
that's just a good fit, natu-

rally. Next you

may ask:
Does Size
Matter? Of j

course.
From the:

magnitude of J
the I.Q. to I
the depth of

the thrust,
size of allj
kinds deter-,
mines how

many ounces of wet excitement
serve as his meet & greet commit
tee. But Roxv's no stranger — nor
is she averse to variety. A large cir
cumference. and you may be risking
lockjaw... but just lay back with a
couple pillows under your back, and
your pleasure limits will be
stretched: your desires, filled to ca
pacity. A long fellow might have to
go slower, but he'll tickle the insides
of your stomach, hitting hidden
spots till both of you swell with pride
and give even Paul Revere some
thing to envy (see Longfellow,
Henry Wadsworth: "Paul Revere's
Ride," especially if you don't get it.
It's an American classic).

Then there's the rest of the dicks
and the men they're attached to.

The ones that make

you throw your

numbers at
: them, and all
rules
and rulers

out the win
dow. The

pretty dicks.
The ones that

make you go, "So

[GASPI pretty

[GASP]." (It's been

said to happen.) So

don't feel bad, guys, if you

don't measure up. You may

have aesthetics going for you.
Maybe even a little .618:1 action.
How... ohhu OOHOuoohhh
pleasing. But although size may
matter (at least it's taken into con
sideration in mental stats computa
tions) it's still the motion of the
ocean that leaves a lasting impres
sion. Work your manhood like a
joystick — likelhe stick of joy that
God meant it to he — and the only
reason she'll ever look down is to
gasp in awe. Goldilocks may have
been looking for the one that's just
right, but we know better. Good
loving comes in all shapes and sizes.
Yes. pun intended. True story. Sign
ing off, your one and only Roxy
cocks.

the I.Q. to I
the depth of

the thrust,
size of allj
kinds deter-,
mines how

many ounces of wet excitement
serve as his meet & greet commit
tee. But Roxv's no stranger — nor
is she averse to variety. A large cir
cumference. and you may be risking
lockjaw... but just lay back with a
couple pillows under your back, and
your pleasure limits will be
stretched: your desires, filled to ca
pacity. A long fellow might have to
go slower, but he'll tickle the insides
of your stomach, hitting hidden
spots till both of you swell with pride
and give even Paul Revere some
thing to envy (see Longfellow,
Henry Wadsworth: "Paul Revere's
Ride," especially if you don't get it.
It's an American classic).

Then there's the rest of the dicks
and the men they're attached to.

The ones that make

you throw your

numbers at
: them, and all
rules
and rulers

out the win
dow. The

pretty dicks.
The ones that

make you go, "So

[GASPI pretty

[GASP]." (It's been

said to happen.) So

don't feel bad, guys, if you

don't measure up. You may

have aesthetics going for you.
Maybe even a little .618:1 action.
How... ohhu OOHOuoohhh
pleasing. But although size may
matter (at least it's taken into con
sideration in mental stats computa
tions) it's still the motion of the
ocean that leaves a lasting impres
sion. Work your manhood like a
joystick — likelhe stick of joy that
God meant it to he — and the only
reason she'll ever look down is to
gasp in awe. Goldilocks may have
been looking for the one that's just
right, but we know better. Good
loving comes in all shapes and sizes.
Yes. pun intended. True story. Sign
ing off, your one and only Roxy
cocks.
