# Bollards placed in White Plaza
## Parking and Transportation Services build bollards to increase biker and pedestrian safety 
### ANDREW BURMON 
A series of bollards has been installed by Park
ing and Transportation Services at the treacherous
clock-tower intersection of Escondido and Lasuen
Malls and near various loading docks in order to
limit vehicle access to White Plaza and thus reduce
the chaotic flow of cars and trucks through the
area.
Increasing biker and pedestrian safety is the pri
mary motivation for the addition of the bollards,
according to Parking and Transportation Services.
Traffic through White Plaza will be kept to a
minimum in order to ensure that no one is hit by
anything larger than a golf cart. Because the bol
lards are of the air-pressured retractable variety,
however, certain authorized vehicles such as ser

vice vans and fire trucks will still be able to make it
into the square.
But safety is not the only concern that prompt
ed the installation of the bollards. Brodie Hamil
ton. director of Parking and Transportation Ser
vices, stressed that "one of the big motivators on
this project was making sure events wouldn't be
disrupted by vehicles."
Golf-cart drivers should not fret about the
changes because there will be six feet of space be
tween each bollard, and pedestrians should still be
able to walk by the bollards without running into
them, according to Parking and Transportation
Services.
While the bollards might lead to more colli
sions, they should not pose a major threat to the
bike-riding masses. Bicyclists will simply have to
exercise a little more care when maneuvering their
way through White Plaza, Hamilton said.
With regards to the danger the bollards might
pose to the average biker, Hamilton encouraged
concerned riders to "get a hold of the bicycle pro
gram and take a little course."

New bollards in Hie center of campus limit vehicle access but may lead to more collisions between bik
ers and pedestrians.
