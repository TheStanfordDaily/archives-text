# Stanford earns critical Pac-10 victory over Bruins
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford seems to have found at least one recipe
for surviving the rest of the season without its leading
scorer Dan Grunfeld: Seven guys play solid basketball
while one plays completely out of his mind.
Last Thursday. Fred Washington performed the
solo act, pouring in 22 points in his first career start in
the Cardinal's 71-62 win over USC. On Sunday, with
former teammate and Atlanta Hawks rookie Josh
Childress looking on. it was Chris Hernandez's turn.
Stanford's junior point guard matched Washing
ton's point total in the first half en route to a career

high 37 points on 13-for-22 shooting to lead Stan
ford to a 78-65 win over UCLA at Maples Pavilion.
His 37 points are the most by a Cardinal since
Casey Jacobsen scored 41 against Oregon during
the 2001-02 season.
After a bout with the stomach flu left him in a daze
during the teams' first meeting — a 75-64 Cardinal win
at Pauley Pavilion on Jan. 20 — Hernandez was in the
zone on Sunday. He drained the first of his five three
pointers off the opening tip, shook off UCLA defend
ers with strong moves to the basket and hit hanging
mid-range jumpers all afternoon.
