# Stanford earns critical Pac-10 victory over Bruins
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford seems to have found at least one recipe
for surviving the rest of the season without its leading
scorer Dan Grunfeld: Seven guys play solid basketball
while one plays completely out of his mind.
Last Thursday. Fred Washington performed the
solo act, pouring in 22 points in his first career start in
the Cardinal's 71-62 win over USC. On Sunday, with
former teammate and Atlanta Hawks rookie Josh
Childress looking on. it was Chris Hernandez's turn.
Stanford's junior point guard matched Washing
ton's point total in the first half en route to a career

high 37 points on 13-for-22 shooting to lead Stan
ford to a 78-65 win over UCLA at Maples Pavilion.
His 37 points are the most by a Cardinal since
Casey Jacobsen scored 41 against Oregon during
the 2001-02 season.
After a bout with the stomach flu left him in a daze
during the teams' first meeting — a 75-64 Cardinal win
at Pauley Pavilion on Jan. 20 — Hernandez was in the
zone on Sunday. He drained the first of his five three
pointers off the opening tip, shook off UCLA defend
ers with strong moves to the basket and hit hanging
mid-range jumpers all afternoon.

Junior Chris Hernandez had a career-high 37 points to carry Stanford to its sixth-straight defeat of UCLA,. The
Cardinal completed a sweep of the Los Angeles schools to hold on to third place in the Pac-10.
Hernandez keys decisive victory over UCLA

For his greatest trick, Hernandez neither
exhibited nor felt signs of fatigue in 35 minutes
of fast-paced action.
"Tonight was a special night because 1
wasn't getting really tired." said Hernandez,
whose previous career high of 30 points came
in the Cardinal's overtime win over San Fran
cisco in the season opener. "1 had a lot of en
ergy throughout the game. Usually I get real
ly tired at some point and I get kind of com
placent."
The Cardinal (15-9,9-5 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) fed off their floor general's energy, turn
ing a five-point deficit into a 41-31 lead with a
23-8 run to close the half. Senior forward Nick
Robinson scored 10 of his 12 points as part of
a 21-9 run to start the second half that put
Stanford ahead 62-40 with 9:43 to play.
With the win, Stanford completed a season
sweep of the Los Angeles schools and opened
up a 1 1/2 game lead over UCLA for third
place in the Pac-10 with four games remain

ing.
The Bruins (14-9, 8-7) did a better job of
getting back on defense than USC did Thurs
day— limiting Stanford to 10 fast-break
points — but their concern for stopping the
Cardinal's transition game backfired at times.
"I got a lot of shots when I was trailing [the
fast break] today," Hernandez said. "They
were so worried about getting back in transi
tion because people got out and ran that I was
able to kick back and make something hap
pen."
Washington, who ran all over USC from
the start of Thursday's game, had a solid — if
quieter — game Sunday. He drained all three
of his field goal attempts and finished with 12
points, eight rebounds and a career-high
seven steals. After the game he said his atten
tion was so focused on Hernandez's shooting
clinic that he didn't notice if UCLA was key
ing on him defensively.
"I just noticed Chris was going crazy."

Washington said. "When that happens, you
don't run plays for anyone else, except for
Chris, which I'm happy we did."
Washington also had three assists, includ
ing two to junior forward Matt Haryasz, who
finished with 12 points and was one rebound
shy of his sixth double-double this season.
Haryasz talked about the adversity the team
has overcome this season, including the recent
loss of Grunfeld.
"A lot of it is character and pride," Haryasz
said. "We have gone through a lot and be
cause of our character, we're not going to roll
over and we're going to fight this thing out
until the end. I think that goes from Guy One
to Guy, what. Eight, Nine, something like
that? Not many."
The Stanford rotation was down to seven
players after senior center Rob Little picked
up his second personal foul less than three
minutes into the game and did not play again
until the second half. With Robinson limited

by foul trouble as well, freshmen Taj Finger
and Peter Prowitt combined to play 24 min
utes off the bench. Finger grabbed a career
high five rebounds.
UCLA senior forward Dijon Thompson
struggled for the second time against Stanford
this season. Thompson finished with 19 points
and 11 rebounds, but he had just four points at
the half and did most of his damage with the
game out of reach.
Bruins freshman Jordan Farmar fueled a
second-half rally that trimmed the 22-point
Stanford lead to 10 with 4:48 to play, but
missed his next two shots and committed two
turnovers in the next couple of minutes. Her
nandez scored four straight points to pad the
Stanford lead.
"This is a good win for us. but if we don't
take care of business at Oregon State, it could
all go out the window," head coach Trent
Johnson said. "We have four left. We could
win all four, and we could lose all four."

until the end. I think that goes from Guy One
to Guy, what. Eight, Nine, something like
that? Not many."
The Stanford rotation was down to seven
players after senior center Rob Little picked
up his second personal foul less than three
minutes into the game and did not play again
until the second half. With Robinson limited

by foul trouble as well, freshmen Taj Finger
and Peter Prowitt combined to play 24 min
utes off the bench. Finger grabbed a career
high five rebounds.
UCLA senior forward Dijon Thompson
struggled for the second time against Stanford
this season. Thompson finished with 19 points
and 11 rebounds, but he had just four points at
the half and did most of his damage with the
game out of reach.
Bruins freshman Jordan Farmar fueled a
second-half rally that trimmed the 22-point
Stanford lead to 10 with 4:48 to play, but
missed his next two shots and committed two
turnovers in the next couple of minutes. Her
nandez scored four straight points to pad the
Stanford lead.
"This is a good win for us. but if we don't
take care of business at Oregon State, it could
all go out the window," head coach Trent
Johnson said. "We have four left. We could
win all four, and we could lose all four."
Stanford seems to have found at least one recipe
for surviving the rest of the season without its leading
scorer Dan Grunfeld: Seven guys play solid basketball
while one plays completely out of his mind.
Last Thursday. Fred Washington performed the
solo act, pouring in 22 points in his first career start in
the Cardinal's 71-62 win over USC. On Sunday, with
former teammate and Atlanta Hawks rookie Josh
Childress looking on. it was Chris Hernandez's turn.
Stanford's junior point guard matched Washing
ton's point total in the first half en route to a career

high 37 points on 13-for-22 shooting to lead Stan
ford to a 78-65 win over UCLA at Maples Pavilion.
His 37 points are the most by a Cardinal since
Casey Jacobsen scored 41 against Oregon during
the 2001-02 season.
After a bout with the stomach flu left him in a daze
during the teams' first meeting — a 75-64 Cardinal win
at Pauley Pavilion on Jan. 20 — Hernandez was in the
zone on Sunday. He drained the first of his five three
pointers off the opening tip, shook off UCLA defend
ers with strong moves to the basket and hit hanging
mid-range jumpers all afternoon.

Junior Chris Hernandez had a career-high 37 points to carry Stanford to its sixth-straight defeat of UCLA,. The
Cardinal completed a sweep of the Los Angeles schools to hold on to third place in the Pac-10.
Hernandez keys decisive victory over UCLA

For his greatest trick, Hernandez neither
exhibited nor felt signs of fatigue in 35 minutes
of fast-paced action.
"Tonight was a special night because 1
wasn't getting really tired." said Hernandez,
whose previous career high of 30 points came
in the Cardinal's overtime win over San Fran
cisco in the season opener. "1 had a lot of en
ergy throughout the game. Usually I get real
ly tired at some point and I get kind of com
placent."
The Cardinal (15-9,9-5 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) fed off their floor general's energy, turn
ing a five-point deficit into a 41-31 lead with a
23-8 run to close the half. Senior forward Nick
Robinson scored 10 of his 12 points as part of
a 21-9 run to start the second half that put
Stanford ahead 62-40 with 9:43 to play.
With the win, Stanford completed a season
sweep of the Los Angeles schools and opened
up a 1 1/2 game lead over UCLA for third
place in the Pac-10 with four games remain

ing.
The Bruins (14-9, 8-7) did a better job of
getting back on defense than USC did Thurs
day— limiting Stanford to 10 fast-break
points — but their concern for stopping the
Cardinal's transition game backfired at times.
"I got a lot of shots when I was trailing [the
fast break] today," Hernandez said. "They
were so worried about getting back in transi
tion because people got out and ran that I was
able to kick back and make something hap
pen."
Washington, who ran all over USC from
the start of Thursday's game, had a solid — if
quieter — game Sunday. He drained all three
of his field goal attempts and finished with 12
points, eight rebounds and a career-high
seven steals. After the game he said his atten
tion was so focused on Hernandez's shooting
clinic that he didn't notice if UCLA was key
ing on him defensively.
"I just noticed Chris was going crazy."

Washington said. "When that happens, you
don't run plays for anyone else, except for
Chris, which I'm happy we did."
Washington also had three assists, includ
ing two to junior forward Matt Haryasz, who
finished with 12 points and was one rebound
shy of his sixth double-double this season.
Haryasz talked about the adversity the team
has overcome this season, including the recent
loss of Grunfeld.
"A lot of it is character and pride," Haryasz
said. "We have gone through a lot and be
cause of our character, we're not going to roll
over and we're going to fight this thing out
until the end. I think that goes from Guy One
to Guy, what. Eight, Nine, something like
that? Not many."
