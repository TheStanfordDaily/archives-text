### MICHAEL TAMKIN 
Tonight marks the beginning of "From Script to
Screen: Conversations on Contemporary French Cine
ma." a French film festival of screenings and discussions
with directors.
There will be a screening of "ft re et avoir" in Cubber
ley Auditorium from 6:30 to 9 p.m. The film was named
best documentary at the European Film Awards in 2(X)2,
and the screening will be followed by a discussion with
the director, Nicholas Philibert. The film follows the
daily interaction between students and teachers.
"Philibert is one of the foremost documentarians in
the world and his films capture stories we would other
wise never see," said Kristine Samuelson. professor of
communications. "With his patient camera and his eye
for important details, he allows his audience full im
mersion into the lives of his characters and the worlds
they inhabit."
"From Script to Screen" is part of the French Film
Festival, created in 2(X)3 by Cecile Alduy, professor of
French and Italian, and Margaret Cohen, professor of
comparative literature and French and Italian.
Alduy said that the mission of the festival is to "bring
contemporary French culture and the artists who shape
it to the academic world."
"Films reflect social tensions, political issues, aesthet
ic trends and psychological problems of a given genera
tion, country, gender," Alduy added.
The festival also aims to encourage the study and ap
preciation of French culture in the Bay Area communi
ty, and to "put on the map Stanford as a leading institu
tion for film studies and the promotion of cultural di
versity and the arts," according to Alduy.
Last April, the French Film Festival brought Laura
Truffaut, the daughter of directors Francois Truffaut and
Pascal Bonitzer to speak on campus. The event featured

screenings of the elder Truffaut's"L'Homme qui Aimait
les Femmes" and the West Coast premiere of Bonitzer's
"Petites Coupures."
Fall quarter's festival included a screening of "Cyra
no de Bergerac" and a talk by director Jean-Paul Rap
peneau; more than 350 people attended.
Tomorrow, Samuelson and Alduy will he hosting "Vi
sions of Films," an interview with Nicolas Philibert, fol
lowed by a screening and discussion of his film "Le Pay
des Sourds," at Memorial Auditorium from 5 to 8 p.m.
On Monday, there will be a showing of "Leo, en
jouant 'Dans la compagnie des homines" followed by a
discussion with director Arnaud Desplechin, from 6 to 9
p.m. at Cubberley Auditorium.
"Desplechin is considered the most talented young
director of his generation and is often compared to Truf
faut," Alduy said. "He has demonstrated a talent for ex
perimenting with different genres, from sentimental
comedy to detective story, while mastering all the sub
tleties of rhythm, image and framing."
The festival is free and open to the public. There will
be additional events from Feb. 28 to March 1.
The festival will conclude on March 1 with the West
Coast Premiere of Desplechin V'Roiset Reine", which
has been nominated for seven French Cesars Awards,
followed by a discussion with Desplechin.
Alduy said she hopes that in addition to increasing
awareness about French cinema, the discussions with the
directors will be particularly valuable for the audience.
"We hope that the discussions after the screenings
with the directors will help clarify some aspects of
French identity, values, habits, sensibility and unveil
some of the tricks, anecdotes and critical choices behind
any creative process," Alduy said.
The major sponsors of the festival are the Stanford Di
vision of Literatures, Cultures and Languages, the Depart
ment of Communication and the School of Education.

Coast Premiere of Desplechin V'Roiset Reine", which
has been nominated for seven French Cesars Awards,
followed by a discussion with Desplechin.
Alduy said she hopes that in addition to increasing
awareness about French cinema, the discussions with the
directors will be particularly valuable for the audience.
"We hope that the discussions after the screenings
with the directors will help clarify some aspects of
French identity, values, habits, sensibility and unveil
some of the tricks, anecdotes and critical choices behind
any creative process," Alduy said.
The major sponsors of the festival are the Stanford Di
vision of Literatures, Cultures and Languages, the Depart
ment of Communication and the School of Education.
