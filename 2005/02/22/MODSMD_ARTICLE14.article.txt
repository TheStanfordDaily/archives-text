## Counting the "invisible people " of Brazil 
### 
How can technology transform international
development? How can new technologies promote
social change?
This week we interview the founder of Mobile-
Media, an organization that hires Brazilian youth
to use Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) devices to
survey the "invisible people" of Brazil.
Melanie Edwards is the founder and executive
director of Mobile Media, and she is also a lecturer
in Public Policy and a Reuters Digital Vision Fel
low at Stanford.
The Daily: Who are the "invisible people"?
Melanie Edwards: You and I are all registered
through social security or birth certificates. But
about one billion [people] around the world are not
officially recorded as existing or registered any
where.
We have invisible people in the United States,
especially in the case of homeless. But in Brazil, it's
about 12 percent of the population. Twenty million
people fall into this invisible category'.

TD: Why try to survey the
'invisible people"?
ME: Governments, cor
porations and nonprofits
all want to serve the
under-served, but they re
ally don't know who they
are. How can you serve a
population when you
don't know who they are?
"Invisible people"
don't have access to the
basics that you and I
would. They don't have ac
cess to education, health
care, microcredit or land ti
tles.

TD: How does Mobile Media survey them?
ME: We hire and train local youth, our "mobile
agents." We teach them survey techniques and how
to use a PDA. Then they're sent into the field to col
lect data and information on the "invisible" com
munity, from income to health, education and
housing needs.
This gives the community more of a voice. It also
gets the mobile agents, some of which are former
drug traffickers, closer to their community. As our
local partner told the agents, "You guys are giving
every person whose house you are walking into a
voice in the world about who they are and what
their needs are."
TD: Why hire Brazilian youth? How do you get
them to work for you?
ME: They get paid over double minimum wage,
since we want to make this a profession and create
real positive role models. We also did some re
search on what the drug traffickers make because
it's a major business there.
We want to show people in community that there's
a future with technology, and that there are options
out there besides drug trafficking. We want to show
there is so much potential for growth in the com
munity itself.
TD: How does surveying the invisible populations
help them?
We want to use this data as an advocacy on be
half of them. We're in the process of forming a con
tract with the Brazilian government. The govern
ment uses the data to increase access to existing ser
vices and to formulate new services for these invis
ible communities that are now becoming visible.
Why start Mobile Media? Why did you leave the
private sector?
ME: I've worked in both the private and public sec
tors, living the extremes from Wall Street to West
Africa. I studied psychology in college and then
went on to be a Peace Corps volunteer in West
Africa. When I came back to the U.S., I studied In
ternational Relations. Then, I went into investment
banking with JP Morgan.
But I always had this nagging feeling of wanting
to get back into the field. To do something in de
velopment, to make an impact. Investment bank
ing provided great professional training, and it led
to social entrepreneurship. I realized that we can
use business knowledge and skills to really make
[an] impact.
TD: And why work in social innovation? Why not
something traditional?
ME: After working in the technology sector, I start
ed Global Technology Corps, which is like a digital
peace corps. During the Kosovo crisis, A1 Gore
came to us and asked if we could get Internet access
to the refugee camps.
That was my first experience seeing the power of
the Internet and technology in a crisis situation.
That's when I realized: this is what I have to do.
Technology in developing countries is where the
high impact is.
TD: I'm a student and I'm sold. How do I get in
volved?
ME: First, there's the social entrepreneurship
course series in Public Policy. That is a great way to
first understand what social entrepreneurship is:
measuring social impact and making organizations
sustainable through revenue generation.
Second, there's social start-ups all around Stanford
that students can get involved in. The Mobile Media
project, for instance, is a product of Stanford, or
ganic from The Farm. Students were involved with
the incubation and evolution of the idea from day
one.

Lija McHugh, asenior, and Aiiiun Stone, who vague
ly remembers senior year, would like to know that
someone out there reads this. You can contact them at
