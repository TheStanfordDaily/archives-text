## E-mail wars: You've got mail 
### ANETO OKONKWO 
Many Stanford students check their e-mail every
minute. Some students cannot live without it. E-mail mes
sages arrive regularly from friends, family and class mailing
lists. Going away fora weekend brings a massive down
pour of e-mails upon return.
Students probably spend so much time battling the e
mail onslaught that they might wonder how they will make
time for class work.
The technologically savvy are categorizing their e-mails
into hundreds of folders and having alerts sent to their cell
phones. Some are still using PINE. Here's a look at the
dominant players in the world of e-mail. It's guaranteed to
keep your inbox buzzing:
Microsoft Outlook 2003
The Case: Microsoft Outlook is the industry standard.
Bundled as part of the omnipresent Microsoft Office Suite,
Outlook offers the familiar Microsoft Office interface,
seamless address book and calendar integration, and wide
compatibility with other computer or handheld applica
tions. In a few easy clicks, users can even publish his or her
personal calendar to the Internet.
Outlook also boasts nearly endless e-mail filtering
and formatting capabilities. Users can create rules to au
tomatically move particular types of messages to speci
fied folders. Outlook's customizable alerts are also
handy for keeping up with to-do lists and busy class
schedules.
The Verdict: It takes a while to figure out what to do
with all the cool features, but it remains the absolute choice
for the sophisticated e-mail professional. Get it at

Qualcomm Eudora 6.2
The Case: Eudora has all the filtering- and folder-orga
nizing facilities of Microsoft Outlook, but Eudora's
strength lies in its user-friendly tools and security features.
For example, Eudora's Scamwatch alerts users to "phish
ing" e-mails - for example, ones that pretend to be from a
bank, asking for personal information.
Eudora is especially suitable for the Stanford network
because Stanford's Information Technology Services and
Systems, known as ITSS, offers and supports Eudora free
of charge.
The Verdict: Eudora has cool features and an easy in
terface for the intermediate e-mail aficionado. Download

it at http://www.stanford.edu/dept/itss/ess/pc/eudora.html.
Mozilla Thunderbird 1.0
The Case: First, the Mozilla Foundation launched the
wildly popular Mozilla Firefox Web Browser. Now, Mozil
la is back to steal another piece of Microsoft's pie with the
free Thunderbird e-mail client. Thunderbird touts a
unique interface, a built-in spam filter and improved
search and sorting capability.
Thunderbird is a bit faster and more user-friendly
than the competition, because it lacks a lot of the bells
and whistles that users usually expect from e-mail
clients. There are no calendar tools in this version, but
you can download the calendar option as an extension,
and Mozilla has plans to bundle the calendar with future
versions.
The Verdict: For simple, fast, efficient mail handling,
Thunderbird is your ticket. Obtain it at http://www.mozU
la.org/products/thunderbird.
Stanford ITSS Webmail
The Case: The present Stanford Webmail has greatly
improved and now allows users to make folders, save sent
messages, and set up a spam filter. However, the search
features are weak, and the interface is rather basic and is

slow to load-up.
Looking to ITSS's great improvements with AXESS,
future versions of Webmail will probably work out many of
its kinks in speed and usability.
The Verdict: There is room for improvement, but Web
mail still provides another great start for the basic user. Ac

Google Gmail
The Case: People know the Google name and expect
the company to deliver smart and cool products. With its
speed, free one-gigabyte of storage and tight integration
with the company's flagship search engine, Gmail does not
disappoint.
Gmail also takes a fresh approach to conversation
threads â€” it automatically displays all the replies to a par
ticular e-mail so that you can view the message in the con
text of a conversation.
However, Gmail generated controversy because the ap
plication automatically "reads" users' e-mails and uses the
information to tailor their text-ads and links to users' in
terests.
The Verdict: Gmail represents the future of e-mail. Get
Gmail service by invitation only. Ask your Gmail-using
friends or e-mail your dorm list for an invite.
