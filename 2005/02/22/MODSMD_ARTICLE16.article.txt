With nearly $40() million in funding
from the United States Department of En
ergy's Office of Science, the Stanford Lin
ear Acceleration Center (SLAC) is on the
brink of making revolutionary discover
ies. SLAC is building the Linac Coherent
Light Source (LCLS), the first x-ray elec
tron laser of its kind in the world.
"SLAC has been the site of ground
breaking scientific research with syn
chrotron radiation since 1983 and is home
of perhaps the strongest accelerator re
search program in the world, and in that
way is well-matched to taking on the chal
lenge of building the LCLS," said Dr. John
Galayda, LCLS project director.
X-rays are already widely used to study
the arrangement of atoms in all types of
materials - metals, semiconductors, plas
tics and biological molecules. Studying the
assembly of these atoms allows scientists
to understand properties of matter, for ex
ample mechanical strength, energy stor
age and the movement of electrical cur
rent.
However. X-rays used in such observa
tions today do not have the ability to pro
duce "real-time" photographs. X-rays em
ployed in present experiments usually
take pictures of molecules over large peri
ods of time, even though molecules and
their components undergo very rapid
changes.
While the current instrument at SLAC
allows scientists to study how atomic and
molecular structures affect the properties
of matter, it does not produce light pulses
fast enough to keep up with the movement
of atoms during chemical reactions.
The Linac Coherent Light Source, on
the other hand, is a major improvement.
First proposed in 1992 by Claudio Pellgri
ni. a professor at the University of Califor
nia Los Angeles, the LCLS can produce x
rays that are extremely short and quick -
shorter and quicker than pulses from pre
sent x-ray sources. This will allow re
searchers to make more precise observa
tions of molecules. .
Scientists at SLAC compare this un
dertaking to the ingenuity of Eadweard
Muybridge. In 1872, Muybridge devel
oped the concept of stop-action photogra
phy on the farm of Leland and Jane Stan
ford. He was able to capture the precise
moment when a galloping horse's feet
were all in mid-air, ushering in the begin
ning of stroboscopic imaging.
The LCLS will function much like the
strobe flash of a camera, allowing scien
tists to observe changes in material prop

erties and movements of atoms.
Construction of the LCLS machine is
slated to begin in 2006, and scientists hope
to have the project completed by 2009.
The total budget is $379 million, which will
be spent on start-up costs, construction
and special spare parts.
The LCLS project, while centered at
SL AC, is a collaborative effort. Stanford is
working with five other institutions: the
Lawrence Livermore National Laborato
ry at the University of California, the Uni
versity of California Berkeley, the Los
Alamos National Laboratory, the Ad
vanced Photon Source at Argonne Na
tional Laboratory and the Brookhaven
National Laboratory.
Stanford will be the first to construct
the LCLS. While other laboratories
around the world are working to make
similar x-ray lasers. Stanford has an edge
because it can utilize the existing linear ac

celerator facility at SLAC, thus saving
time and money.
Other institutions will have to build a
linear accelerator before being able to
construct the LCLS. The Japanese have
discussed building a machine by 2010, and
an effort in Hamburg, Germany will not
be complete until 2012.
"Stanford has a real opportunity to de
velop its program and bring in first-rate,
top-notch people," said Chemistry Prof.
Keith Hodgson, director of the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory.
While the LCLS project is still in its
preliminary stage, the scientists at SLAC
said they are looking forward to the fu
ture.
"The first experiments will be simple,
like learning to use x-ray laser radiation
for the first time, but we'll be able to use x
ray laser radiation for the first time," said
Patrick Krejcik, an accelerator physicist

working on the LCLS project.
"We'll look at biological molecules,
and there will be applications relating to
molecules in living organisms," Krejcik
added.
The LCLS will allow biologists to study
the make-up of macromolecules, such as
protein and DNA particles. Current re
search methods often require the crystal
lization of these macromolecules. which is
a challenging process. The LCLS will re
move this barrier, giving scientists better
access to these macromolecules.
The research enabled by the LCLS will
have wide implications for not only parti
cle physics but also medicine and biology.
"There's no place I'd rather be [than at
Stanford]," Galayda said. "This is an ex
citing, very significant addition to SLAC's
research capabilities. It's a turning point in
synchrotron radiation research at SLAC
and in the world."
