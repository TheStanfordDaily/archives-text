## Editorial ASSU elections should still follow code 
### 
Last year's ASSU executive election was a mess.
The chaos began with the Campaign Practice Code —
or rather, with campaign e-mails sent out by then-se
nior Mikey Eee violating that code. The election's re
sults — and Lee's victory — were thrown out.
Lee's running mate, then-junior Dylan Mefford,
sued the ASSU, and the Constitutional Council ruled
that the Campaign Practice Code, or CPC, was an in
fringement of free speech rights and therefore in vio
lation of the ASSU Constitution. The ASSU-created
CPC is a set of guidelines about campaigning.
Then things got really complicated, with a special
election and three more Constitutional Council cases.
This year, the ASSU has made the risky hut neces
sary decision to move away from enforcing the CPC.
Instead, it will work with Residential Education, Res
idential Computing and candidates themselves to
keep spam e-mails, intrusive flyering and general ha
rassment at a minimum.
(iiven the Constitutional Council's ruling last year,
the lack ol enforcement is really just an acknowledge
ment of reality — the ASSU cannot and should not
try to enforce rules that have been judged unconstitu
tional. And the general principal behind the Council's
ruling, the protection of free-speech rights, is a good
one.
But there's also a big risk. No one wants to see an
inescapable barrage of campaign materials in dorms
and inboxes or even vote buying and intimidation.
It's a remote but real possibility that the campaigns

will spin out of control in a race to the bottom, and stu
dent life and privacy may suffer.
Hopefully, the University will keep a close eye on
the proceedings and strictly enforce rules regarding
dorm flyering and spamming group e-mail lists.
More importantly, candidates should choose the
high road, either out of respect for their fellow stu
dents or through the realization that exorbitant
spending and obnoxious campaign tactics can back
fire badly — either through direct punishment from
the University or more indirectly through a poor
showing at the polls.
Students should do their part to keep the election
civil by reporting violations of University rules and
making it absolutely clear that they will not support
candidates who do not respect the CPC.
No one wants to see someone win just because they
outspent their opponent, either. Even if there's no
way to strictly enforce it, candidates should agree
among themselves to a cap on spending, and they
should take full advantage of the new financial disclo
sure forms to monitor and keep each other in check —
candidates who violate the cap should be denounced
loudly and immediately.
If the ASSU, the University, the candidates and
the student body — not to mention The Daily —
work together, this can be an informative election sea
son with plenty of thought-provoking dialogue. If
they don't, it might be a disaster.
