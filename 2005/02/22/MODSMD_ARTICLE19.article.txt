# Holt's Harangue
## Asia is so retro 
### 
It is a well-known fact that many
Asian countries enjoy American
styles, sometimes adopting them 20
or 30 years after the trends leave the
United States. Leg warmers. Con
verse all-stars and dyed hair have all
made comebacks in some Asian na
tions.
This retro craze is so rampant in
Asia that it is even being extended to
foreign policy. Now Japan, the Koreas

and ( hina not only can enjoy permed hair and Bon Jovi,
hut fear of nuclear war! Joy!
I think it's just great that North Korea has nukes. The
whole communists vs. capitalists thing was a real gas
back in the '70s and '80s, and I'm glad Asia is bringing
back the trend. Now the entire region can create an arms
race to help make "mutual deterrence" as common a
term as "pet rocks." Japan can remilitarize to counter
North Korea's threat, just like Russia and the U.S. used
to do back in the day. Remember how much fun it was
learning in class who Gorbachev was.and why he was an
evil man with a birthmark that looked like a brain leech?
Now the Japanese and South Koreans can learn Kim's
various facial expressions and why he wears sunglasses
indoors.
1 think the biggest sign that Asia is retro is how the
diplomatic six party talks so closely resemble the brat
pack classic "The Breakfast Club." Stay with me here.
North Korea won't resume six party talks, just like Judd
Nelson's character Bender wouldn't come out and talk
about his problems in"The Breakfast Club."
We. the United States, have to bring Bender back to
the negotiating table and talk about how he is expected
to play a role as the badass rebel with good hair and a his
tory of destructive, even totalitarian, behavior. In return,
the United States, just like Emilio Estevez, can explain
why it has to look tough and beat up on the weaker kids
to impress our gung-ho drill sergeant father. It'll be a
touching scene where we all learn about each other while
listening to songs by Wang Chung.

I think it's great how the Asian nations are resurrect
ing the '80s Cold War mentality in their own nuclear
arms race. Willi their neighbors to the North having
nukes, why should the South Koreans be left out? Sure,
the United States would heavily discourage it. even
probably threaten to pull out our troops, but you know
what, sometimes you have to be a free-spirited nation
that goes its own way.
I mean, we've been parenting South Korea for 50
years now. We nurtured it to grow strong (and fight the
commies), gave it an allowance of sorts (in foreign aid)
and kept it in line (by telling it in the '40s that it wasn't
mature enough to govern itself, so we would do it fora
while). South Korea is like Molly Ringwald: sometimes
you just have to buck authority and do something for
yourself. Also, they both look good in a pink dress. In
stead of smoking pot a la "The Breakfast Club,"the
South Koreans may start lighting up nukes. The penin
sula may be ablaze with more than "St. Elmo's Fire."
So what can the United States, a well-meaning Scott
Baio character in a"Charles in Charge" situation, do to
make everyone happy? Stand in the demilitarized zone
and blast "In Your Eyes" on our boom box? 1 mean,
even if we are as built as Hulk Hogan, we can't go in there
and beat up Bender.
See. the irony of course is that we beat up on the weak
kid in our gym class named "Iraq." He was shifty but he
never posed any actual threat to us. On the other hand.
Bender (North Korea) has been talking smack about us
and clearly has the tools to hurt us. Why did we beat up
Iraq and not North Korea?
The answer is that the rest of "The Breakfast Club"
a.k.a. Japan, South Korea and China would not like it too
much. Then again. Iraq's buddies aren't exactly pleased
with us, either.
And where do 1 fit into this whole retro craze? Just
call me "Spicoli," dude.

Chris thinks the United States needs to deploy troops out
side Molly Ringwald's house. Send complaints to
