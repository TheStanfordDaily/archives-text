# Coffins, bat mitzvah kick off Tree Week
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
There weren't four weddings,
hut there were two funerals, a bat
mitzvah and a royal procession at
last night's information meeting
for prospective Tree applicants.
The secretive meeting — open
only to applicants, former trees
and the recently selected Dollies
— kicked off the 10-day-long se
lection period known as Tree
Week. Before a winner is declared
next Wednesday, the half-dozen

applicants must impress their
judges with the most outlandish
stunts their imaginations can con
coct.
The meeting last night was the
first opportunity for the aspirants
to prove their worth. With the
current Tree, three former Trees
and a smattering of Dollies and
band members watching, the
Tree-hopefuls made their way to
the band Shak just east of Burn
ham Pavilion.
