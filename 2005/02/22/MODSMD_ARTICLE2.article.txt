# Coffins, bat mitzvah kick off Tree Week
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
There weren't four weddings,
hut there were two funerals, a bat
mitzvah and a royal procession at
last night's information meeting
for prospective Tree applicants.
The secretive meeting — open
only to applicants, former trees
and the recently selected Dollies
— kicked off the 10-day-long se
lection period known as Tree
Week. Before a winner is declared
next Wednesday, the half-dozen

applicants must impress their
judges with the most outlandish
stunts their imaginations can con
coct.
The meeting last night was the
first opportunity for the aspirants
to prove their worth. With the
current Tree, three former Trees
and a smattering of Dollies and
band members watching, the
Tree-hopefuls made their way to
the band Shak just east of Burn
ham Pavilion.

Sophomore Brad Burton is carried in a coffin to the Band Shak on the first day
of Tree Week, the audition period for Stanford's mascot.
Freshman Adam Monroe was
the first to arrive, draped in cloth
and lying on a funeral bier carried
by an entourage dressed in black.
Sophomore Brad Burton fol
lowed with a more extravagant fu
neral procession. He arrived in a
wooden casket carried by his
Kappa Sigma brothers, also
dressed in black. When the casket
was set down. Burton emerged
and bloodily sacrificed a member
from the procession. After Burton
entered the Sliak, the others
silently placed the mauled sacri
fice into the casket and departed.
"A good exit is important too,"
said senior Andrew Parker, a for
mer Tree.
Senior Erin Lashnits, who will
be co-terming next year, arrived
at the center of a bat milzvah cel
ebration, carried along in a chair
while do/ens of supporter!? wear
ing pink "Erin for Tree" shirts en
circled her and sang Hava Nagila.
The last entrance stunt was
performed by sophomore Christi
na Zempel, who arrived on a
wooden sedan carried by four
men in Speedos. After a rhyming
proclamation was read, Zempel
descended from her throne, be
decked with peacock feathers,
and walked over the bodies of sev
eral prostrate peons to enter the

Shak.
The current and former Trees
remained stoic throughout, offer
ing short judgments on the entry
processions. Trees are notorious
for lying to the media, and infor
mation about the selection
process is hard to uncover. An in
quiry into the rules governing
stunts, for instance, elicited this
response from 2001-2002 Tree
and co-term student Chuck Arm
strong:
"Everything has to be some
how related to non-linear algebra
or non-Euclidean geometry."
In the coming week, expect
"some pretty outrageous things
around campus," said senior Isaac
Salier-Hellendag 111, the current
Tree. "1 have high expectations."
Salier-Hellendag claims to
have had his appendix removed
during his quest to become Tree.
"And I was lowered into dilut
ed acid and the outer layer of my
skin was removed in a big ritual."
he continued. "The whole theme
of the campaign was the elimina
tion of the superfluous, so 1 tried
to eliminate a bunch of things in
my life that 1 considered super
fluous."
Will Rothacker Jr., last year's
tree, used a cinematic reference to
describe the upcoming stunts.
"Basically this week you're
going to see a lot of stuff from the
third hour of 'Gettysburg,' " he
said. "Not the first hour, not the
second hour, and definitely not
the fourth hour."
