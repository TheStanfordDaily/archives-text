# Tales of a 19th-grade nothing
## 10,000 band kids 
### 
You can scarcely go a week with
out hearing it from someone: "Stan
ford is a great place, but there are no
cute girls (boys)!" And before you
sit there as you normally do and
think, "Well, they're certainly not
talking about me ... " yes, they are.
The majority of social interactions
I've witnessed on campus have all
the comfort of a middle school slow

dance. I've seen
less posturing at a
national political
convention. It's
all gotten pretty
ridiculous. But
seriously, what
are the odds that
one of the gen
ders at Stanford
is fully gorgeous
and the other con-

sists mostly of hairy-knuckled trolls?
Come on. The truth is, we're all pret
ty ugly. This is no Arizona State.
(And before you say anything, let
me just say that I've been there and
even their ugly kids are good-look
ing.) Okay, maybe "ugly" is too
harsh a word, but let's be honest: I
don't see Playboy or Playgirl show
ing up on campus anytime soon for
their Girls/Boys of the Pac-10 issue.
Listening to Stanford kids complain
ing about how ugly everyone is is
like listening to the girls on the " Real
World" griping about who's the
biggest slut.
The problem is simple. You've
admitted 1(),0(M) band kids to the
same university and left themto fig
ure out who the cool kids are. That's
a little bit like letting stock brokers
set stock prices (of course, I'm still
not sure why this makes the band so
bad, but that's a question for anoth
er day). But as a result, endless
amounts of time are spent re-strati
fying the social structure into the
same old groups: jocks, nerds,
freaks, etc. The real danger in all of
this is that you've installed into this
already stressful social process a
group of people who have the ana
lytical capacity to instantaneously

evaluate each of their social encoun
ters and appraise their present social
landscape like the world's biggest
Abercrombie chessboard. So with
everyone walking around with their
cool points leaderboard in their
head, we've got a campus on the
brink. The significance of every con
versation is amplified, and a poten
tial dating prospect is either a future
husband/wife or not worth messing
with. Everyone's taking themselves
so seriously that it's like going to
school on the planet's longest red
carpet. All that's missing, thankfully,
is Starr Jones. (And no, I will not
dress up like Joan Rivers and do a
report from White Plaza to make my
point.)
OK, so what's to be done? Well,
we could just do a half-campus swap
with ASU, but that's not likely (I al
ready asked). Maybe some more
transfers? No, that's not likely ei
ther. Truth is, there are plenty of re
ally attractive people around, and
before 1 get accused privately, I'm
probably not one of them. But here's
a little shopping advice to a group
who should hardly need it; if they
don't have what you want in the
store you're in, shop somewhere
else. I've personally found that the
down-side of dating internally in a
small, incestuous and self-absorbed
professional school is fairly signifi
cant. All it takes is a little change of
scenery (yes, available wholly on
campus), and the guts to say hello,
and you could be well on your way to
busting the "ugly" myth on your
own. You'd be surprised what fabu
lous people are around, just dying to
meet you. Finally, and most impor
tantly, take a bit of advice that
Frankie Goes to Hollywood had fig
ured out all the way back when 1 was
in middle school â€” relax, you may
just be the exception after all.
