Lunar New Year belongs to
Vietnamese as much as Chinese
On Feb. 10, the Vietnamese Student As
sociation held a celebration of the Lunar
New Year in White Pla/a. The goal of the
celebration was to bring together the differ
ent Asian groups on campus and showcase
the distinct ways that Vietnamese, Chinese,
and Korean people celebrate this common
holiday. Our goal was to entertain, to edu
cate and to show that Stanford's Asian-
American community is unified, but also
made up of many diverse groups. It is a
shame that The Daily chose to not empha
size the diversity in our celebration, but to
perpetuate the cultural hegemony that
Asian groups always sought to avoid in call
ing the holiday "Chinese New Year" and
putting "(Jung hay fat choy!" in the photo
caption fora photo that ran on Feb. 11.
The Lunar Year Holiday originated in
China and was brought to Vietnam by the

Chinese. However, the New Year has over
time become an important part of Viet
namese heritage, as Vietnamese and Viet
namese-Americans incorporated aspects of
their own social and cultural environments
into its celebration. For sure, one can ob
serve Chinese influences in Vietnamese cul
ture, but culture is inherently dynamic and
appropriating, and cultural practices are
not defined by their origin, but rather by the
adopting group, and how they put their own
stamp on it. The Vietnamese Student Asso
ciation organized this festivity, in collabora
tion with other Asian groups on campus, in
order to exhibit the many ways different
cultures celebrate this common holiday.
Putting a Chinese label on a holiday that be
longs as much to the Vietnamese people as
to the Chinese totally missed the objective
of the whole event.

VanDerveer's redshirt policy appalling
I am writing after reading the article in
Friday's paper regarding Clare Bodenstein
er, a junior and member of the Stanford
women's basketball team, who has agreed to
a request by Coach Tara VanDerveer to be
come a redshirt, ineligible to play despite not
being injured or having any other problem
atic situation. The reason for this action
given in the article is that there are too many
good players at the guard position on this
year's team and thus Bodensteiner will have
a better chance of starting or playing more
minutes in her two remaining years of eligi
bility.
I am appalled that the University would
acquiesce to such a situation and that The
Daily would write the story in a positive fash
ion. The purpose of a Stanford education is
to prepare students fora positive and suc
cessful life. Stanford graduates go on to ca
reers in medicine, business, science, the arts

and in any number of fields. By coercing or
conning Bodensteiner into becoming a red
shirt VanDerveer has in effect stolen a year
from her future life. And for what? To spend
a year dribbling basketballs in a Waiting for
Godot world? Stanford has a freshman
guard, Candice Wiggins, who is outstanding
and other good players at that position who
will return next year as well. Also, does any
one really expect Coach VanDerveer not to
recruit outstanding high school players at
that position? Will she say to a player of the
caliber of Wiggins, "Sorry. 1 can't recruit you
because I promised the position to a player
who is redshirting." Hardly. In the win-at
any-cost world of big time college sports
VanDerveer will sell out Bodensteiner in a
New-York minute.
A coach has a responsibility to her
players that goes beyond winning and los
ing. In undertaking this action Van-
Derveer has demonstrated that she has no
concern for the students under her con

trol and instead is primarily concerned
with her own career.

Draft will not be reinstated
Kalani Leifer squawks about his own reg
istration for the draft. I was horn in 1960, the
first year that it was required to register
when President Carter reinstated draft regis
tration. I did two things that year: (a) regis
tered for the draft and (h) decided that I
would never support a reintroduction of the
draft, no matter what came about. My opin
ion hasn't changed. There must be millions
more like me in their forties now. Kalani will
be perfectly safe and free to complete his
Stanford degree or get his apartment in
Switzerland.
