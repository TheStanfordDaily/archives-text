## Seyi Abolaji's soccer odyssey 
### 
Over winter break, Stanford senior mid
tielder Seyi Abolaji decided to forego
his final year of eligibility and take a
shot at playing professional soccer in Turkey.
In last week's column, I recounted Seyi's ef
forts to work his connections to meet Okan, a
former Turkish soccer star, and arrange a try
out with Malatiaspor, one of the premier teams
in the Turkish league.
The day before the preseason camp, Okan
disappeared, leaving behind a shady trail of

gambling debts. Without
Okan's recommendation,
Seyi was unable to get his
chance and found himself
without options in Turkey.
Seyi came back to the
Farm and will complete his
Bachelor of Arts in history
this quarter. He has not given
up on his dream to play pro
fessional soccer, but he now
knows firsthand that the path
will not be easy.

Despite the setbacks, Seyi's trip to Turkey
gave him a big confidence boost. In his impor
tant audition with Okan. he showed himself
that he can successfully perform under tremen
dous pressure. He now also better understands
the intricacies and unspoken rules of interna
tional tryouts, and next time he will be more
prepared.
One of these is that success at that level can
hinge on the tiniest of details. At the profes
sional level, apart from the megastars whose
names are on millions of replica jerseys, the dif
ference in talent between players is incredibly
small. Coaches have very little incentive to give
an unproven player a chance.
It seems like a perversion of the competitive
fabric of sports, but the best players do not al
ways make the team. In some cases, young
players are even expected to give a portion of
their salary to the coach in exchange for playing
time.
There is also the issue of racism. Franklin
Foer, in his remarkable book on soccer and
globalization, "How Soccer Explains the
World," describes the fate of black players in
some Eastern European leagues.
Many upstart teams try to sign Nigerian
players to mimic the diversity seen in great
British, Spanish and Italian clubs. These young
men, sometimes no older than sixteen, are
treated as novelty items and are forced to ad
just alone to a homogeneous culture very dis
tinct from their own.
Seyi never faced direct racism because
Turkey is a diverse society, but he did travel on
his Nigerian passport because teams were
much more willing to take a look at an African
than an American player. Perhaps the clubs ex
pected to extract a better deal for themselves if
they signed a young African far away from
home, as opposed to a self-sufficient, worldly

Despite seeing the shady under
world of professional soccer, Seyi
also found many instances of kind
ness. There was the Turkish man who
supported Seyi through his recovery
from knee surgery, and who linked
him with Okan. There is also the
Nigerian friend who advises Seyi on
professional and financial matters.
He warns Seyi that people will try to
take advantage of him. and teaches
him the ins and outs of succeeding in
the cutthroat professional world.
While the rest of us are on spring
break, Seyi will fly down to Brazil
and try to get a professional contract
there. He has trained in Brazil for
two summers, and has some connec
tions. The next round of tryouts for
European clubs is in June, and any
period of professional soccer in
Brazil will look great on his resume.
Brazil has won two of the last
three world cups, but the super
stars like Ronaldoand Ronaldinho
all play in Europe. The domestic
league is a fertile recruiting
ground, and it is often seen as a
stepping stone to further success
across the Atlantic.
Seyi plans to sign with a first-divi
sion team so that he can be licensed
as a professional player. Then he will
most likely be leased to a second-di
vision club that can offer him more
time on the pitch. At the conclusion
of the national tournament, either
team he has played for can opt to buy
his services. If Seyi impresses his
managers, he will be offered a con
tract to stay in Brazil. If not. he will
pack his bags once more and travel
to Europe.
1 asked Seyi what were the most
important lessons he learned during
his travels around the world. He said
he realizes it is important to know
how much you're willing to invest in
order to succeed. Stanford offers
great opportunities, but also pro
vides a blanket of comfort and safety
that can hold us back. He knows he is
taking a big risk in leaving, but that
his dream is worth it.
