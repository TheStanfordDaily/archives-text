## Seyi Abolaji's soccer odyssey 
### 
Over winter break, Stanford senior mid
tielder Seyi Abolaji decided to forego
his final year of eligibility and take a
shot at playing professional soccer in Turkey.
In last week's column, I recounted Seyi's ef
forts to work his connections to meet Okan, a
former Turkish soccer star, and arrange a try
out with Malatiaspor, one of the premier teams
in the Turkish league.
The day before the preseason camp, Okan
disappeared, leaving behind a shady trail of

gambling debts. Without
Okan's recommendation,
Seyi was unable to get his
chance and found himself
without options in Turkey.
Seyi came back to the
Farm and will complete his
Bachelor of Arts in history
this quarter. He has not given
up on his dream to play pro
fessional soccer, but he now
knows firsthand that the path
will not be easy.

Despite the setbacks, Seyi's trip to Turkey
gave him a big confidence boost. In his impor
tant audition with Okan. he showed himself
that he can successfully perform under tremen
dous pressure. He now also better understands
the intricacies and unspoken rules of interna
tional tryouts, and next time he will be more
prepared.
One of these is that success at that level can
hinge on the tiniest of details. At the profes
sional level, apart from the megastars whose
names are on millions of replica jerseys, the dif
ference in talent between players is incredibly
small. Coaches have very little incentive to give
an unproven player a chance.
It seems like a perversion of the competitive
fabric of sports, but the best players do not al
ways make the team. In some cases, young
players are even expected to give a portion of
their salary to the coach in exchange for playing
time.
There is also the issue of racism. Franklin
Foer, in his remarkable book on soccer and
globalization, "How Soccer Explains the
World," describes the fate of black players in
some Eastern European leagues.
Many upstart teams try to sign Nigerian
players to mimic the diversity seen in great
British, Spanish and Italian clubs. These young
men, sometimes no older than sixteen, are
treated as novelty items and are forced to ad
just alone to a homogeneous culture very dis
tinct from their own.
Seyi never faced direct racism because
Turkey is a diverse society, but he did travel on
his Nigerian passport because teams were
much more willing to take a look at an African
than an American player. Perhaps the clubs ex
pected to extract a better deal for themselves if
they signed a young African far away from
home, as opposed to a self-sufficient, worldly
