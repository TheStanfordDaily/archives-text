# Big Swim ends in defeat for Card men
## 
### SAMUEL CHEN STAFF WRITER 
It is generally thought that a rivalry isn't a rival
ry when the same team wins the competition year
in and year out. At the Spieker Aquatics Complex
in Berkeley, No. 4 California (9-0, 4-0 Pacific-10
Conference) proved that the Big Swim between
No. 2 Stanford and the Golden Bears is still a rival

ry meet. For the first time in nearly 14 years. Cal
won the dual-meet 129-114 this past Saturday and
dropping the Cardinal to 6-1.3-1 in the Pac-10.
In Stanford's first dual-meet loss since the 1999-
(K) season, both teams made it a fast and intense
competition, as Stanford's dual-meet win streak
ended at 38.
"We were obviously disappointed that we
didn't win. but losing is part of athletics and if the

same team always won then there wouldn't he any
reason to even have competition," sophomore
Shaun Phillips said. "Luckily for us, we don't have
to go through this very often."
In Cal's 14th victory in the 107 th Big Swim, the
Bears started off with strong first and third finishes
in the 4()()-yard medley relay, while the Stanford
quartet composed of sophomore Hong/.he Sun, se
nior Gary Marshall, senior co-captain Jayme
Cramer and sophomore Ben Wildman-Tobriner
was second to touch the wall at 3:10.06 seconds.
Though down early on the scoreboard. Stanford
battled back from a 13-4 deficit to regain the lead in
the third event, as freshman Daniel Beal, sopho
more Andy Grant and Cramer took first, second
and fourth, respectively, in the 200-yard freestyle,
following strong performances by Phillips and ju
nior Michael McLean, who came in first and third,
respectively, in the l(XH)-yard freestyle event.
Following this event, though, Cal regained the
lead and only a strong final push by the Cardinal al
lowed a tie in the 10th of 13 events. In the 12th
event. Marshall put in the strongest performance of
the meet by the Cardinal, breaking a pool record in
the 200-yard breaststroke event, touching the wall
at 1:56.22. Marshall was not alone in his record-set
ting performance, as Cal sophomore Patrick
O'Neil also set a pool record in his automatic
NCAA qualifying time of 1:44.22 in the 200-yard
butterfly. O'Neil's time shaved 1.6 seconds off his
previous personal best in the event.
With such strong performances by Cal's top
swimmers, Stanford may be getting a taste of what

the Bears have in store for the upcoming postsea
son meets. However, confidence has not been
shaken and senior co-captain Matt McDonald said
he doesn't believe anything needs to be changed
for the Cardinal to be successful.
"We all believe in each other and know our
team is great." McDonald said. "Everyone has
been steadily improving throughout the year, but
Cal just had everyone swimming at their lifetime
bests."
The Cardinal earned a chance to tie the Bears
in the point tally with a victory in the final 400-yard
freestyle relay event, and could have even clinched
the win with a first and either a second or third
place finish by the Stanford "B" squad. Cal perse
vered, though, taking the first and third spots, with
the top time setting a new Spieker record.
In all. Stanford won six of the 13 events. Beat's
win in the 200-yard freestyle, Tobias Oriwol's vic
tory in the 2(X)-yard individual medley (1:46.45),

Sun's win in the 200-yard backstroke (1:43.86) and
Marshall's 200-yard breaststroke swim resulted in
automatic NCAA qualifying times.
Though they did not have any victories, the
Cardinal's divers contributed to the team's point
total. Stanford's top divers came in second and
third in the 1 -meter and 3-meter diving events, re
spectively. In the 1-meter diving event, freshman
Nathan Kim, senior Jeff Durbin and sophomore
Kevin McLean finished in second, third and
fourth-place, respectively. In the 3-meter event,
senior Jesse Fonner. Kim and McLean took the
third through fifth spots. In both events, Cal senior
Louie Gagnet easily took the top spot by a large
margin.
Despite the disappointment that comes with
any loss, the Cardinal remain confident.
"That we lost one dual meet is a temporary dis
appointment. but it is absolutely in no way a diver
gence from our path toward the end of the season
when it really counts." Phillips said.
The regular season drew to a close at the end of
the rain-soaked meet. The Pac-10 Championships,
where Stanford has been crowned conference
champion for 23 consecutive years, will be held in
two weeks from March 2 to 5 in Long Beach, Calif.

same team always won then there wouldn't he any
reason to even have competition," sophomore
Shaun Phillips said. "Luckily for us, we don't have
to go through this very often."
In Cal's 14th victory in the 107 th Big Swim, the
Bears started off with strong first and third finishes
in the 4()()-yard medley relay, while the Stanford
quartet composed of sophomore Hong/.he Sun, se
nior Gary Marshall, senior co-captain Jayme
Cramer and sophomore Ben Wildman-Tobriner
was second to touch the wall at 3:10.06 seconds.
Though down early on the scoreboard. Stanford
battled back from a 13-4 deficit to regain the lead in
the third event, as freshman Daniel Beal, sopho
more Andy Grant and Cramer took first, second
and fourth, respectively, in the 200-yard freestyle,
following strong performances by Phillips and ju
nior Michael McLean, who came in first and third,
respectively, in the l(XH)-yard freestyle event.
Following this event, though, Cal regained the
lead and only a strong final push by the Cardinal al
lowed a tie in the 10th of 13 events. In the 12th
event. Marshall put in the strongest performance of
the meet by the Cardinal, breaking a pool record in
the 200-yard breaststroke event, touching the wall
at 1:56.22. Marshall was not alone in his record-set
ting performance, as Cal sophomore Patrick
O'Neil also set a pool record in his automatic
NCAA qualifying time of 1:44.22 in the 200-yard
butterfly. O'Neil's time shaved 1.6 seconds off his
previous personal best in the event.
With such strong performances by Cal's top
swimmers, Stanford may be getting a taste of what

The No. 2 Stanford men's swimming and diving team lost its first dual-meet to Cal in nearly 14 years
at the Spieker Aquatics Complex in Berkeley.
the Bears have in store for the upcoming postsea
son meets. However, confidence has not been
shaken and senior co-captain Matt McDonald said
he doesn't believe anything needs to be changed
for the Cardinal to be successful.
"We all believe in each other and know our
team is great." McDonald said. "Everyone has
been steadily improving throughout the year, but
Cal just had everyone swimming at their lifetime
bests."
The Cardinal earned a chance to tie the Bears
in the point tally with a victory in the final 400-yard
freestyle relay event, and could have even clinched
the win with a first and either a second or third
place finish by the Stanford "B" squad. Cal perse
vered, though, taking the first and third spots, with
the top time setting a new Spieker record.
In all. Stanford won six of the 13 events. Beat's
win in the 200-yard freestyle, Tobias Oriwol's vic
tory in the 2(X)-yard individual medley (1:46.45),

Sun's win in the 200-yard backstroke (1:43.86) and
Marshall's 200-yard breaststroke swim resulted in
automatic NCAA qualifying times.
Though they did not have any victories, the
Cardinal's divers contributed to the team's point
total. Stanford's top divers came in second and
third in the 1 -meter and 3-meter diving events, re
spectively. In the 1-meter diving event, freshman
Nathan Kim, senior Jeff Durbin and sophomore
Kevin McLean finished in second, third and
fourth-place, respectively. In the 3-meter event,
senior Jesse Fonner. Kim and McLean took the
third through fifth spots. In both events, Cal senior
Louie Gagnet easily took the top spot by a large
margin.
Despite the disappointment that comes with
any loss, the Cardinal remain confident.
"That we lost one dual meet is a temporary dis
appointment. but it is absolutely in no way a diver
gence from our path toward the end of the season
when it really counts." Phillips said.
The regular season drew to a close at the end of
the rain-soaked meet. The Pac-10 Championships,
where Stanford has been crowned conference
champion for 23 consecutive years, will be held in
two weeks from March 2 to 5 in Long Beach, Calif.
It is generally thought that a rivalry isn't a rival
ry when the same team wins the competition year
in and year out. At the Spieker Aquatics Complex
in Berkeley, No. 4 California (9-0, 4-0 Pacific-10
Conference) proved that the Big Swim between
No. 2 Stanford and the Golden Bears is still a rival

ry meet. For the first time in nearly 14 years. Cal
won the dual-meet 129-114 this past Saturday and
dropping the Cardinal to 6-1.3-1 in the Pac-10.
In Stanford's first dual-meet loss since the 1999-
(K) season, both teams made it a fast and intense
competition, as Stanford's dual-meet win streak
ended at 38.
