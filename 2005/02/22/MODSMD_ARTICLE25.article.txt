## 
### SAMUEL CHEN STAFF WRITER 
It is generally thought that a rivalry isn't a rival
ry when the same team wins the competition year
in and year out. At the Spieker Aquatics Complex
in Berkeley, No. 4 California (9-0, 4-0 Pacific-10
Conference) proved that the Big Swim between
No. 2 Stanford and the Golden Bears is still a rival

ry meet. For the first time in nearly 14 years. Cal
won the dual-meet 129-114 this past Saturday and
dropping the Cardinal to 6-1.3-1 in the Pac-10.
In Stanford's first dual-meet loss since the 1999-
(K) season, both teams made it a fast and intense
competition, as Stanford's dual-meet win streak
ended at 38.
"We were obviously disappointed that we
didn't win. but losing is part of athletics and if the

same team always won then there wouldn't he any
reason to even have competition," sophomore
Shaun Phillips said. "Luckily for us, we don't have
to go through this very often."
In Cal's 14th victory in the 107 th Big Swim, the
Bears started off with strong first and third finishes
in the 4()()-yard medley relay, while the Stanford
quartet composed of sophomore Hong/.he Sun, se
nior Gary Marshall, senior co-captain Jayme
Cramer and sophomore Ben Wildman-Tobriner
was second to touch the wall at 3:10.06 seconds.
Though down early on the scoreboard. Stanford
battled back from a 13-4 deficit to regain the lead in
the third event, as freshman Daniel Beal, sopho
more Andy Grant and Cramer took first, second
and fourth, respectively, in the 200-yard freestyle,
following strong performances by Phillips and ju
nior Michael McLean, who came in first and third,
respectively, in the l(XH)-yard freestyle event.
Following this event, though, Cal regained the
lead and only a strong final push by the Cardinal al
lowed a tie in the 10th of 13 events. In the 12th
event. Marshall put in the strongest performance of
the meet by the Cardinal, breaking a pool record in
the 200-yard breaststroke event, touching the wall
at 1:56.22. Marshall was not alone in his record-set
ting performance, as Cal sophomore Patrick
O'Neil also set a pool record in his automatic
NCAA qualifying time of 1:44.22 in the 200-yard
butterfly. O'Neil's time shaved 1.6 seconds off his
previous personal best in the event.
With such strong performances by Cal's top
swimmers, Stanford may be getting a taste of what
