# Beam errors doom Stanford gymnasts

### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
"Win beam and you'll win the
meet" is a common adage in gymnas
tics. Although scores from each of
the four events are given equal
weight, the balance beam score is
often the best indicator of how a
team will fare.
Nerves and pressure are usually
the most intense on the four-inch
wide apparatus and mistakes tend to
be the most costly. Gymnasts either

feed off the fire or they get burned.
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team (1-4,1-3 Pacific-10 Confer

In front of a crowd of 3,(XX) at

only 0.05 points after stellar perfor
mances on both vault and uneven
bars. They left the event with a near

down and eyes glaring. Stanford

went on to lose the meet. 194.625 to
196 JO.
"It was a big meet, we were right
in there, and we tightened up a little
bit and got nervous," head coach
Kristen Smyth said.
With two falls and several large
balance breaks, the team only man
aged to score a 47.55, more than a
point lower than last meet's score
and the lowest team score on beam
since Smyth started coaching Stan
ford three-and-a-half years ago. The
low score came as a disappointing

surprise to fans who watched Stan
ford dominate on beam last year and
climb to a No. 1 national ranking on
the event in the regular season.
Although the judging on beam
was extremely tough across the
board on Friday night — UCLA also
scored one of its lower marks of the
season — the judging alone does not
explain Stanford's performance.
Freshman Lauren Elmore started
the team with a solid routine to earn
