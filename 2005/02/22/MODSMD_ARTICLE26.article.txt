# Beam errors doom Stanford gymnasts
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
"Win beam and you'll win the
meet" is a common adage in gymnas
tics. Although scores from each of
the four events are given equal
weight, the balance beam score is
often the best indicator of how a
team will fare.
Nerves and pressure are usually
the most intense on the four-inch
wide apparatus and mistakes tend to
be the most costly. Gymnasts either

feed off the fire or they get burned.
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team (1-4,1-3 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) is still dressing its wounds.
In front of a crowd of 3,(XX) at
Maples Pavilion on Friday night, the
Cardinal mounted the beam with
confidence, trailing defending na
tional champion No. 2 UCLA by
only 0.05 points after stellar perfor
mances on both vault and uneven
bars. They left the event with a near
ly irrecoverable 1.725 deficit, heads
down and eyes glaring. Stanford

went on to lose the meet. 194.625 to
196 JO.
"It was a big meet, we were right
in there, and we tightened up a little
bit and got nervous," head coach
Kristen Smyth said.
With two falls and several large
balance breaks, the team only man
aged to score a 47.55, more than a
point lower than last meet's score
and the lowest team score on beam
since Smyth started coaching Stan
ford three-and-a-half years ago. The
low score came as a disappointing

surprise to fans who watched Stan
ford dominate on beam last year and
climb to a No. 1 national ranking on
the event in the regular season.
Although the judging on beam
was extremely tough across the
board on Friday night — UCLA also
scored one of its lower marks of the
season — the judging alone does not
explain Stanford's performance.
Freshman Lauren Elmore started
the team with a solid routine to earn
a 9.65, but was followed by freshman
Alex Pintchouk, who had several
wobbles and a couple of missed con
nections which left her with a 9.30.
Unshaken, junior Glyn Sweets
stepped up to turn in a beautiful rou
tine complete with a double turn and
a stuck landing fora
Sweets' success looked like it was
going to shift the team's momentum in
the right direction, but her score was
turned out to be Stanford's highest of
the evening on beam. Freshman
Stephanie Gentry wobbled a bit and
took a step on her landing to score a
1 >.60. Then Stanford's two closers,
freshman Tabitha Yim and junior cap
tain Natalie Foley, both of whom had
been tied at a fifth place national rank
ing on beam, fell on their dismounts to
score a 9.25 and a 175, respectively.
Yim and Foley were steaming
when they came off beam — what
had been a close meet and a potential
upset against a good rival turned into
the team's first loss at home.
Despite the disappointment on
beam, however, the team made huge
strides on its first two events of the
evening, vault and bars. The Cardi
nal posted a season-high of 49.00 on
vault, nearly a full point higher than
their season average and just a cou
ple tenths behind UCLA.
"After vault and bars we were on
pace to score a 1 % plus." Smyth said.
"If it hadn't been for beam and a few
mistakes on floor we would have
been right up there."
The team's improved depth made
the difference on vault. Due to in
juries over the past few weeks, Friday
was the first time that Stanford could
field a full team of six vaulters instead

of the bare minimum of five. Friday
also marked the first time that both
freshman Li/. Trjcase, the national
vault champion in 2002, and Foley,
the third-place vaulter at NCAA na
tionals, were in action on the vault.
The result? Stanford put up five,
rather than its usual three, vaults that
were difficult enough to garner 10.0
start values. Pintcouk upgraded her
vault from a Yurchenko layout to a
Yurchenko with a half twist and
scored a 9.75. Gentry followed suit
with a 9.75, Foley and Sweets scored
twin l ).HOs, and Tricase closed with a
9.90 to earn second place in the meet
behind UCLA's Canadian
Olympian Kate Richardson.
"We were much more dynamic
and aggressive on vault," Smyth said.
"It was an extremely encouraging

performance since we have been tak
ing our time on the event to build up
to this point."
Stanford can build even more on
vault when Yim, the fourth place fin
isher at Olympic trials, joins the line
up. Yim, who ruptured her Achilles
tendon just weeks before the Games,
has been practicing in the gym. but
Smyth does not want her to rush back
to competition too quickly.
Building off its performance on
vault, the team beat UCLA on bars
and set a season-high score of -W.25.
Tricase won the event with a
and Yim scored a 9.90 to tie fora
close second with UCLA's
Olympian Tasha Schwikert, who
went on to win the Ail-Around.
Last Friday's meet proved that
the young Cardinal team is starting

to realize its potential. It needs to
pass the four-inch test of fire and put
all four events together, however, if
it's going to be a serious threat at
NCAA Nationals in April.
Stanford has its next chance at
home this Friday night against No. 21
Arizona State. The Sun Devils are a
small, young team with seven fresh
men and sophomores and only one
senior. Arizona State has lost to the
same teams that Stanford has fallen
to — Washington, Arizona and
UCLA — but it is coming off two
easy wins against No. 46 California
and No. 32 Sacramento State.
If the Cardinal can maintain their
strong performance on vault and
bars and improve on beam, they will
be in good position to snatch their
second victory of the season.

Despite junior Glyn Sweets' 9.725 score on beam, the Cardinal were unable to defeat UCLA. The women's gym
nastics team faces Arizona State at home this Friday night.
