## Stanford women clinch Pac-10 title 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
No. 4 Stanford (24-2, 15-1 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) visited Los An
geles this weekend with three goals
in mind: clinch the regular season
conference title, sweep the season
series with USC and UCLA and
stay healthy in the process.
Mission accomplished.
The Cardinal followed up an 88-
62 triumph over USC (16-9, 10-6
Pac-10) on Friday with an 81 -68 vic
tory against UCLA (16-10, 10-7
Pac-10) at Pauley Pavilion on Sun
day.
Poor shooting from the Cardinal
combined with UCLA's attacking
offense resulted in an eight-point
Bruin lead, the largest deficit Stan
ford has faced since its loss to then-
No. 9 Tennessee on Dec. 21.
Junior Nikki Blue led the charge
for UCLA, collecting nine points in
the first half and 24 for the game.
She also pulled down seven re
bounds.
"They've been circling this date
on their calendar," head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "They know they
have to play well if they want to
have a shot at the NCAA Tourna
ment, and I thought they did very
well."
But there was simply too much
of freshman Candice Wiggins for
UCLA to handle. Wiggins, from

San Diego's La Jolla Country Day
School, played before a huge con
tingent of friends and family that
made the trip north to L. A., and she
didn't disappoint.
"1 had a talk with my high school
coach last night, and she told me it
was up to 200 people," Wiggins said.
"I was getting a little nervous, hut
she told me that the game comes to
you, and to just relax."
The overwhelming favorite for
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, Wig
gins notched her second consecu
tive double-double, with 24 points
and a career-high 16 rebounds.
Inside, sophomore Brooke
Smith gave the Bruins more than
they wanted and balanced Stan
ford's offense. With standout
sophomore Noelle Quinn still miss
ing from the UCLA frontcourt.
Smith went straight at the defense,
occasionally putting the ball on the
floor fora rare dribble drive to the
basket.
Playing a season-high 37 min
utes, Smith scored 20 points and
added three blocks, tying her sea
son high in the latter category.
After their sluggish start, the
Cardinal put together a 25-6 run to
close the half leading by 12 points,
43-31. Stanford has not trailed at
halftime in any game this year.
"We didn't start off the game as
well as we hoped to," Smith said.

Pac-10 Freshman of the Year candidate Candice Wiggins had 24 points and a career-high 16 rebounds
against UCLA in a game attended by over 200 of her family members and friends.
"At the end of the first half we started
knocking down some shots and getting
some stops, and 1 think that stuff just
kind of snowballs."
In the second half, Stanford got it
self into early foul trouble, including a
number of inexplicable fouls on jump
shots. The Bruins were into the bonus
just 5:40 into the second half, and
UCLA shot 19-of-25 from the line
after halftime.
However, the Bruins' shooting let
them down all day long. Junior Lisa
Willis, UCLA's all-time leading three
point shooter, shot just 3-of-17 from the
field and l-of-8 from beyond the arc.
She finished with 15 points.
"That's how it works when you play
one of the best teams in the country -
you don't have a lot of margin for

error," Bruin coach Kathy Olivier said.
"They're smart, and they're not going to
let Lisa Willis have good looks."
On Friday, the Cardinal wrapped up
sole possession of the Pac-1() regular
season title with a victory over the
Women of Troy at the Los Angeles
Sports Arena. It marks the fifth consec
utive season that Stanford has been the
conference champion, tying the Cardi
nal's streak from 1989-93 for the longest
in conference history.
After VanDerveer had spent weeks
preaching the importance of better
work on the glass, the Cardinal came
through against the Women of Troy,
winning the rebounding battle. 46-33,
including 14 offensive boards. It was
Stanford's largest rebounding edge
since beating Oregon State 50-31 on the
glass Dec. 27.
Contributing to the Cardinal's ad
vantage was the hard work of its guards.
Wiggins capped off her first career dou
ble-double with 10 rebounds. Senior
Susan King Borchardt. likewise, pulled

down a career-high eight hoards and
also hit four three-point field goals,
tying her career high. Each player con
tributed 14 points.
While VanDerveer rested her
starters, Stanford got excellent produc
tion from its bench — 38 points — in
cluding a season-high 14 points from se
nior Azella Perryman. She also con
tributed eight rebounds and a steal in
just 21 minutes.
Sophomore forward Eshaya Murphy
led the charge for the Women of Troy
with 12 points and three steals. Junior
guard Meghan Gnekow grabbed eight
rebounds.
The Cardinal return home this week
where they will try to avenge their only
conference loss against Oregon on
Thursday at Maples Pavilion.
"I thought our team learned a lot
[from the Oregon game], that we need
to be tougher when we go on the road,"
VanDerveer said. "We should be thank
ing Oregon, and we're going to show
them how appreciative we are."
