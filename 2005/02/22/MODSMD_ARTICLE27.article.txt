## Stanford women clinch Pac-10 title 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
No. 4 Stanford (24-2, 15-1 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) visited Los An
geles this weekend with three goals
in mind: clinch the regular season
conference title, sweep the season
series with USC and UCLA and
stay healthy in the process.
Mission accomplished.
The Cardinal followed up an 88-
62 triumph over USC (16-9, 10-6
Pac-10) on Friday with an 81 -68 vic
tory against UCLA (16-10, 10-7
Pac-10) at Pauley Pavilion on Sun
day.
Poor shooting from the Cardinal
combined with UCLA's attacking
offense resulted in an eight-point
Bruin lead, the largest deficit Stan
ford has faced since its loss to then-
No. 9 Tennessee on Dec. 21.
Junior Nikki Blue led the charge
for UCLA, collecting nine points in
the first half and 24 for the game.
She also pulled down seven re
bounds.
"They've been circling this date
on their calendar," head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "They know they
have to play well if they want to
have a shot at the NCAA Tourna
ment, and I thought they did very
well."
But there was simply too much
of freshman Candice Wiggins for
UCLA to handle. Wiggins, from

San Diego's La Jolla Country Day
School, played before a huge con
tingent of friends and family that
made the trip north to L. A., and she
didn't disappoint.
"1 had a talk with my high school
coach last night, and she told me it
was up to 200 people," Wiggins said.
"I was getting a little nervous, hut
she told me that the game comes to
you, and to just relax."
The overwhelming favorite for
Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, Wig
gins notched her second consecu
tive double-double, with 24 points
and a career-high 16 rebounds.
Inside, sophomore Brooke
Smith gave the Bruins more than
they wanted and balanced Stan
ford's offense. With standout
sophomore Noelle Quinn still miss
ing from the UCLA frontcourt.
Smith went straight at the defense,
occasionally putting the ball on the
floor fora rare dribble drive to the
basket.
Playing a season-high 37 min
utes, Smith scored 20 points and
added three blocks, tying her sea
son high in the latter category.
After their sluggish start, the
Cardinal put together a 25-6 run to
close the half leading by 12 points,
43-31. Stanford has not trailed at
halftime in any game this year.
"We didn't start off the game as
well as we hoped to," Smith said.
