# Cardinal swept by undefeated Texas
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Pit two of the strongest col
lege diamond dynasties against
each other, and ninth-inning
grand slams, two inside-the-park
home runs and three tightly
matched games is all part of the
norm.
The undefeated No. 3 Texas
Longhorns (11-0) warded off
No. 13 Stanford's comeback at
tempts each time, however,
sweeping the series and sending

the Cardinal (7-5) back home
with a 1-5 road record and their
first back-to-back road series
losses since 1989.
The Cardinal lost 6-4 on Fri
day night. 8-7 on Saturday and 5-
4 in Sunday's nailbiter.
Texas nearly doomed itself in
the first game of the series, out
hitting the Cardinal by an im
pressive margin but stranding 12
as the Longhorns struggled to
get timely hits. Stanford junior
