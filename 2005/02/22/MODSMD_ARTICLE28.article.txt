### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Pit two of the strongest col
lege diamond dynasties against
each other, and ninth-inning
grand slams, two inside-the-park
home runs and three tightly
matched games is all part of the
norm.
The undefeated No. 3 Texas
Longhorns (11-0) warded off
No. 13 Stanford's comeback at
tempts each time, however,
sweeping the series and sending

the Cardinal (7-5) back home
with a 1-5 road record and their
first back-to-back road series
losses since 1989.
The Cardinal lost 6-4 on Fri
day night. 8-7 on Saturday and 5-
4 in Sunday's nailbiter.
Texas nearly doomed itself in
the first game of the series, out
hitting the Cardinal by an im
pressive margin but stranding 12
as the Longhorns struggled to
get timely hits. Stanford junior


LINDSAY REINSMITHAhe Stanford Daily
Mark Romanczuk and the Cardinal pitching staff couldn't handle the
No. 3 Longhoms over the weekend, suffering three straight defeats.
Mark Romanczuk (2-2) had his
shortest start of the season, lasting
only 3 1/3 innings. While the lefty's
weakness is most often the number
of walks he allows, Romanczuk
was simply hittable in his latest
outing, giving up nine base knocks
and five runs - with only two bases
on balls.
Freshman righthander Erik
Davis bailed Romanczuk out in the
fourth and threw well for the rest
of the contest, scattering three hits
and just one run.
The Stanford offense just
couldn't catch up. scoring all of its
runs before the fourth inning.
Sophomore Jed Lowrie accounted
for three of the Cardinal's four
runs, hitting a blast in the third
with two men on base. But after
that, Texas showed off one of the
best relief corps in the nation, as
Clayton Stewart and J. Brent Cox
locked down the win by shutting
down the Cardinal offense. Cox
fanned five of the six batters he
faced in the final two innings of the
game.
By the eighth frame, Saturday
afternoon's rain-delayed contest
had all the trappings of a total em
barrassment for the Cardinal, who
were sitting on the ugly end of an 8-
1 rout. To make matters worse,
Texas' Cox, who baffled Stanford
hitters the night before, was com
ing out for the ninth.
But Cox never registered a sin
gle out.
The Cardinal loaded up the
bases for freshman Michael Tay
lor. whose RBI infield single was a
hint of hope for Stanford. Junior

catcher John Hester dropped a ball
into right center to score another
run and then came the last person
Texas wanted to step into the bat
ter's box with the bases loaded in
the ninth. Lowrie boosted a ball
over the leftfield wall for his sec
ond career grand slam.
But the offensive magic stopped
one run too soon, and, though re
deemed by the comeback, the Car
dinal took the series loss. Junior
starter Jeff Gilmore, who struggled
after appearing to roll his ankle
during a play at first, was saddled
with the loss.
In order to sidestep a sweep,
Stanford had to score early and
often on Sunday, and the team had
a 3-0 lead by the end of the fifth.
Freshman Nolan Gallagher, in his
second Sunday start of the season,
gave up only one Texas hit in his
first five frames. Sophomore Matt
Leva relieved him and got roughed
up for two more runs before the in
ning was over.
Stanford, which doubled Texas'
hit total in the game, tied the score
at four on sophomore Jim
Rapoport's RBI infield single.
Then along came Longhorns lead
off man sophomore Drew Stubbs.
Stubbs. who was 7-for-13 in the
series, was a thorn in the Cardi
nal's side from the first pitch of the
matchup. He teed off on the first
pitch of the bottom of the ninth
and sent it into centerfield, stretch
ing the knock into his second in
side-the-park homer of the week
end and sealing the sweep for the
Longhorns.
The Cardinal are 1-5 this season
against ranked teams and dropped
seven spots in the Baseball Ameri
ca poll this week. This is the first
time that Stanford has been absent
from the top 10 since February,
2003.
