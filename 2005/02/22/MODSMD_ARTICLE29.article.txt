# Tough weekend for men's tennis
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Three days. Three losses.
At first glance, that seems like a
rough weekend at the National
Team Indoor Championships for the
previously undefeated No. 7 Stan
ford men's tennis team (6-3).
A closer look reveals that the
Cardinal's first-round loss was to No.
9 Virginia, which became the first
school to advance to the finals in its
first appearance at the tournament.
The Cavaliers also dispatched the
No. 2 and 6 teams en route to the fi
nals.
Stanford's second-round loss to
15th seed Oklahoma State was a
tight 4-3 defeat that the Cardinal
were points away from winning. The
team's third consecutive upset was a
4-3 loss to No. 12 USC, yet another
match in which the Cardinal almost
tasted victory.
So taken together, Stanford's
three losses last weekend are no rea
son to panic.
"It was obviously tougher compe
tition than we've played so far this
year," junior KC Corkery said. "But
we have a pretty young team and
maybe the guys weren't ready to be
in such a dogfight in some of those
matches. 1 feel like we got a little un
lucky as well, like everything was pil
ing on top of each other throughout
the tournament.
"It's early in the season, and I
don't feel like any of the matches
were blowouts. We were right in
every match, and I wouldn't be
scared to play any of those teams
again. 1 didn't feel like any of those
teams were far and above where we
were. It was obviously a disappoint
ing weekend, but we should be able
to realize we can play with anyone;
we just need to have a few things go
our way. which they didn't the last
couple matches."
Head coach John Whitlinger
echoed Corkery s sentiments.
"If you look at both the Okla
homa State match and the USC

match, we really were two points
away from winning those matches,"
Whitlinger said.
Although the Cardinal hadn't
lost the doubles point all season, the
team dropped it in all three of its
matches in Chicago.
"1 think it hurt us more knowing
that we were so close to getting the
doubles point and then losing it."
Corkery said, "It's disheartening
when you're that close and you let it
slip away."
In the match against Virginia,
Stanford junior Jon Wong and
sophomore James Wan lost the No.
3 doubles match in a tiebreaker.
Stanford dropped the doubles point
in a tiebreaker again in its match
against USC on Saturday, although
there were multiple match points in
senior Phil Sheng and sophomore
Eric McKean's No. 2 doubles match.
"I don't think we got really good
starts Friday and Saturday." Wan
said. "Things kind of spiraled for us
in doubles. Our team did a good job
of getting back into singles, but it just
wasn't enough because the doubles
point is pretty big."
In Thursday's match against Vir
ginia, No. 4 Sam Warburg suffered
his first loss of the season. The senior
conceded to No. 19 Doug Stewart 6-
4. 6-4. On the other hand. Sheng
marked his first win against a ranked
opponent this season, defeating Vir
ginia's No. 22 Somdev Devvarman
6-2,6-2.
"Phil played a great match
against a very good player,"
Whitlinger said. "It was an impres
sive win. He played power tennis at
its best: he really kept the guy on the
defensive the whole time. I really
like the way Phil's been playing and
I have the utmost confidence in him.
I expect him to keep improving and
keep having a great year."
In addition to Warburg's loss,
Virginia clinched the victory by tal
lying straight set wins against fresh
man Phil Kao at the No. 5 singles po
sition and against McKean at the
final singles position.

While the final score recorded
was 4-1, Wan and Corkery's matches
had not yet been decided. Wan was
wrapped up in a tight first set and
Corkery was even at 2-2 after losing
the first set in a tiebreaker.
"It's weird knowing that if the
match is over team-wise, you won't
get to finish your match individual
ly," Corkery said. "It kind of plays
on your mind a little bit. [My oppo
nent and 11 found ourselves watching
the other matches more than you
should or more than you're used to.
Depending on how [the team does],
there's a point in your match where
you both know you're not going to
finish."
The following day.the Cardinal
got off to a slow start against Okla
homa State, losing the doubles point
again. Warburg, Corkery and Wan
bounced back to win their singles
matches in straight sets but Sheng

and McKean lost in straight sets.
With the score tied at 3-3, the match
came down to Kao's match, which he
lost in a third set tiebreaker.
Saturday included another nar
row loss of the doubles point as Stan
ford gave up two of the three dou
bles matches to USC.
In a repeat of the match against
Oklahoma State, Warburg, Corkery
and Wan tallied wins at the top, sec
ond and fourth singles positions, re
spectively. Sheng lost a close match
at the third singles position, 7-6, 6-4,
and Wong lost in straight sets at the
final singles position. Once again,
the match came down to Kao in an
other three-setter. Kao narrowly lost
7-5. 4-6. 6-4 to the Trojans' Kaes
Van't Hot'.
"As a freshman, he got thrown in
the fire very quickly," Whitlinger
said. "It was definitely a learning ex
perience that will carry him on later

in the year and it will pay off in the
long run.
"We still have a long way to go in
the season. It's still February; it's not
April or May yet. Nobody was happy
about it; nobody likes losing three
matches back at the Team Indoor,
but I hope they feel that we were
pretty close in all those matches.
They've got to realize that and keep
working at it and put this behind us."
Stanford will attempt to use the
tournament as a learning experience
as it prepares to travel to Los Ange
les this weekend to take on the Tro
jans again, as well as UCLA.
"[The match gave] us insight into
what they can do and what we can
do," Wan said of the Trojans. "It
could have given them confidence as
well, but I feel like we're going to win
when we go down there. This week
end shouldn't have happened the
wav it did."

In Thursday's match against Vir
ginia, No. 4 Sam Warburg suffered
his first loss of the season. The senior
conceded to No. 19 Doug Stewart 6-
4. 6-4. On the other hand. Sheng
marked his first win against a ranked
opponent this season, defeating Vir
ginia's No. 22 Somdev Devvarman
6-2,6-2.
"Phil played a great match
against a very good player,"
Whitlinger said. "It was an impres
sive win. He played power tennis at
its best: he really kept the guy on the
defensive the whole time. I really
like the way Phil's been playing and
I have the utmost confidence in him.
I expect him to keep improving and
keep having a great year."
In addition to Warburg's loss,
Virginia clinched the victory by tal
lying straight set wins against fresh
man Phil Kao at the No. 5 singles po
sition and against McKean at the
final singles position.

While the final score recorded
was 4-1, Wan and Corkery's matches
had not yet been decided. Wan was
wrapped up in a tight first set and
Corkery was even at 2-2 after losing
the first set in a tiebreaker.
"It's weird knowing that if the
match is over team-wise, you won't
get to finish your match individual
ly," Corkery said. "It kind of plays
on your mind a little bit. [My oppo
nent and 11 found ourselves watching
the other matches more than you
should or more than you're used to.
Depending on how [the team does],
there's a point in your match where
you both know you're not going to
finish."
The following day.the Cardinal
got off to a slow start against Okla
homa State, losing the doubles point
again. Warburg, Corkery and Wan
bounced back to win their singles
matches in straight sets but Sheng

and McKean lost in straight sets.
With the score tied at 3-3, the match
came down to Kao's match, which he
lost in a third set tiebreaker.
Saturday included another nar
row loss of the doubles point as Stan
ford gave up two of the three dou
bles matches to USC.
In a repeat of the match against
Oklahoma State, Warburg, Corkery
and Wan tallied wins at the top, sec
ond and fourth singles positions, re
spectively. Sheng lost a close match
at the third singles position, 7-6, 6-4,
and Wong lost in straight sets at the
final singles position. Once again,
the match came down to Kao in an
other three-setter. Kao narrowly lost
7-5. 4-6. 6-4 to the Trojans' Kaes
Van't Hot'.
"As a freshman, he got thrown in
the fire very quickly," Whitlinger
said. "It was definitely a learning ex
perience that will carry him on later

in the year and it will pay off in the
long run.
"We still have a long way to go in
the season. It's still February; it's not
April or May yet. Nobody was happy
about it; nobody likes losing three
matches back at the Team Indoor,
but I hope they feel that we were
pretty close in all those matches.
They've got to realize that and keep
working at it and put this behind us."
Stanford will attempt to use the
tournament as a learning experience
as it prepares to travel to Los Ange
les this weekend to take on the Tro
jans again, as well as UCLA.
"[The match gave] us insight into
what they can do and what we can
do," Wan said of the Trojans. "It
could have given them confidence as
well, but I feel like we're going to win
when we go down there. This week
end shouldn't have happened the
wav it did."

Senior Phil Sheng and doubles partner sophomore Eric McKean couldn't overcome USC's Johan Berg and Jamir Al-
Agba on Saturday. The No. 1 1 Trojans defeated the Cardinal 4-3 to drop Stanford to 6-3 on the season.
Three days. Three losses.
At first glance, that seems like a
rough weekend at the National
Team Indoor Championships for the
previously undefeated No. 7 Stan
ford men's tennis team (6-3).
A closer look reveals that the
Cardinal's first-round loss was to No.
9 Virginia, which became the first
school to advance to the finals in its
first appearance at the tournament.
The Cavaliers also dispatched the
No. 2 and 6 teams en route to the fi
nals.
Stanford's second-round loss to
15th seed Oklahoma State was a
tight 4-3 defeat that the Cardinal
were points away from winning. The
team's third consecutive upset was a
4-3 loss to No. 12 USC, yet another
match in which the Cardinal almost
tasted victory.
So taken together, Stanford's
three losses last weekend are no rea
son to panic.
"It was obviously tougher compe
tition than we've played so far this
year," junior KC Corkery said. "But
we have a pretty young team and
maybe the guys weren't ready to be
in such a dogfight in some of those
matches. 1 feel like we got a little un
lucky as well, like everything was pil
ing on top of each other throughout
the tournament.
"It's early in the season, and I
don't feel like any of the matches
were blowouts. We were right in
every match, and I wouldn't be
scared to play any of those teams
again. 1 didn't feel like any of those
teams were far and above where we
were. It was obviously a disappoint
ing weekend, but we should be able
to realize we can play with anyone;
we just need to have a few things go
our way. which they didn't the last
couple matches."
Head coach John Whitlinger
echoed Corkery s sentiments.
"If you look at both the Okla
homa State match and the USC

match, we really were two points
away from winning those matches,"
Whitlinger said.
Although the Cardinal hadn't
lost the doubles point all season, the
team dropped it in all three of its
matches in Chicago.
"1 think it hurt us more knowing
that we were so close to getting the
doubles point and then losing it."
Corkery said, "It's disheartening
when you're that close and you let it
slip away."
In the match against Virginia,
Stanford junior Jon Wong and

Stanford dropped the doubles point

the season. It's still February; it's not
April or May yet. Nobody was happy
about it; nobody likes losing three
matches back at the Team Indoor,
but I hope they feel that we were
pretty close in all those matches.
They've got to realize that and keep
working at it and put this behind us."
Stanford will attempt to use the
tournament as a learning experience
as it prepares to travel to Los Ange
les this weekend to take on the Tro
jans again, as well as UCLA.
"[The match gave] us insight into
what they can do and what we can
do," Wan said of the Trojans. "It
could have given them confidence as
well, but I feel like we're going to win
when we go down there. This week
end shouldn't have happened the
wav it did."
