# ASSU changes election rules to protect free speech
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With ASSU elections set to begin at the start of spring
quarter, student leaders have been working with the
University to reform its election policies to provide bet
ter protection of free speech.
This year, the ASSU Elections Commission will not
set policy on its own. Rather, its role will be to merely
publicize and clarify the relevant University Residential
Education, Computing and dorm-flyering policies, espe
cially for the candidates, according to Elections Com
missioner Troy Steinmetz, a sophomore.
With the changes, the ASSU hopes to strike a balance
between creating an open forum for campaigning and
protecting students from bad campaign practices. Last
year, violation — including the use of senior and junior
class mailing lists as endorsement tools — resulted in a
special election after the results of the original election
were overturned by the Undergraduate Senate.
Steinmetz said that the changes made over the past
year will prevent certification battles in the senate and
future special elections.
"You're not going to see what happened last year," he
said.
For one thing, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate and
Graduate Student Council no longer have veto power
over the elections during the certification process. Stein
metz said that if there are any issues with this year's elec
tion, they will have to be raised bv students.

Steinmetz also said that the ASSU had been working
with the Offices of Residential Education and Student
Activities to clarify and in some cases tweak the Univer
sity's policies on public advertising and the use of e-mail
lists for campaigning.
"The big change is going to be the idea that the ASSU
doesn't restrict free speech," Steinmetz said.
The Constitutional Council cases brought last year in
the wake of the election controversy revealed that some
of the policies listed in the Campaign Practices Code may
have violated the candidates' first amendment rights.
"Basically, the Campaign Practices Code, since it has
been continually ruled that the ASSU cannot directly en
force it due to free speech rights, will not be directly reg
ulated by the ASSU this year." said Senate Chair Chris
Lin. a senior. The Campaign Practices Code is a set of
guidelines about campaigning.
Steinmetz said that instead of telling candidates what
they can and cannot do, the Elections Commission will
recommend proper campaign behavior and leave it to
the University and to individual students and dorms to
decide what is acceptable.
For example, Steinmetz said that the ASSU will be
making sure that candidates are informed of all the Uni
versity's Residential Computing policies so that they do
not use computers improperly to campaign.
"1 feel like you will see judicious use of e-mails during
the week," he said.
