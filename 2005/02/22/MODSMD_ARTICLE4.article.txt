# Forum discusses Russian IT

### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last week, officials and business
people from around the world came
to Stanford to rub elbows at the
U.S.-Russia Technology Sympo
sium, the premiere technology con
ference between the two nations.
The two-day marathon of speeches
and panels aimed to tighten bilateral
trade relations and encourage in
vestment in Russia.
Topics varied from the gridlock
of the Cold War past to the burgeon
ing but volatile market in Russia
today. But the hot-button issues
were Russia's future in the informa
tion technology market, and the role
of the government in stimulating
foreign investment. Whereas several
speakers pushed for tax breaks and
kickbacks to create an IT friendly
environment, others warned the
government to be wary of the social
costs of some business practices, no
tably outsourcing.

Virtually all panelists and speak
ers agreed that Russia has world
class engineers, mathematicians and
computer scientists. Yet its IT indus
try is 30 times smaller than that of
India, said Sergey Kravchenko,
president of Boeing Russia.
Kravchenko argued that if Russia is
to keep abreast of global technology
markets,"The best salesman for
Russia must be the Russian Presi
dent [Vladimir Putin]."
In an interview with The Daily,
Andrey Fursenko, Russian minister
of education and science and co
chair of the symposium, agreed that
Putin's government has a duty to up
hold investors' interests.
"[The government] depends on
taxes, which our citizens and our
businesses pay and that means we
must earn these taxes," Fursenko
said.
But he did not agree that the
president is obliged to be a salesman
for the business sector.
"Our businesspersons are not

kiddies in overalls," he said. "They
arc big boys and girls. They can and
must stand for themselves."
He continued, "The fact that we
must project a positive image of
Russia and support the initiatives of
business is unquestionable, and the
president does this well. But he
should not have to do it alone."
Instead of relying solely on gov
ernment protection, Fursenko said
Russia's businesses must be open to
unconventional market strategies
and have a nose for the cutting edge.
"Everyone doesn't always have
to think along the same lines," he
said. "To sense what the time de
mands, what will be in demand in
five or 10 years, that is the founda
tion for some of the greatest success
es," he said.
Dmitry Milovantsev, Russia's
deputy minister of communication
and information, pushed fora more
proactive state role in the arena of
business. He said a "critical mission"
