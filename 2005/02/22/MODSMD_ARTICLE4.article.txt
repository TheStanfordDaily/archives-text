# Forum discusses Russian IT
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last week, officials and business
people from around the world came
to Stanford to rub elbows at the
U.S.-Russia Technology Sympo
sium, the premiere technology con
ference between the two nations.
The two-day marathon of speeches
and panels aimed to tighten bilateral
trade relations and encourage in
vestment in Russia.
Topics varied from the gridlock
of the Cold War past to the burgeon
ing but volatile market in Russia
today. But the hot-button issues
were Russia's future in the informa
tion technology market, and the role
of the government in stimulating
foreign investment. Whereas several
speakers pushed for tax breaks and
kickbacks to create an IT friendly
environment, others warned the
government to be wary of the social
costs of some business practices, no
tably outsourcing.

Virtually all panelists and speak
ers agreed that Russia has world
class engineers, mathematicians and
computer scientists. Yet its IT indus
try is 30 times smaller than that of
India, said Sergey Kravchenko,
president of Boeing Russia.
Kravchenko argued that if Russia is
to keep abreast of global technology
markets,"The best salesman for
Russia must be the Russian Presi
dent [Vladimir Putin]."
In an interview with The Daily,
Andrey Fursenko, Russian minister
of education and science and co
chair of the symposium, agreed that
Putin's government has a duty to up
hold investors' interests.
"[The government] depends on
taxes, which our citizens and our
businesses pay and that means we
must earn these taxes," Fursenko
said.
But he did not agree that the
president is obliged to be a salesman
for the business sector.
"Our businesspersons are not

kiddies in overalls," he said. "They
arc big boys and girls. They can and
must stand for themselves."
He continued, "The fact that we
must project a positive image of
Russia and support the initiatives of
business is unquestionable, and the
president does this well. But he
should not have to do it alone."
Instead of relying solely on gov
ernment protection, Fursenko said
Russia's businesses must be open to
unconventional market strategies
and have a nose for the cutting edge.
"Everyone doesn't always have
to think along the same lines," he
said. "To sense what the time de
mands, what will be in demand in
five or 10 years, that is the founda
tion for some of the greatest success
es," he said.
Dmitry Milovantsev, Russia's
deputy minister of communication
and information, pushed fora more
proactive state role in the arena of
business. He said a "critical mission"
for Russia is to make IT a major
source of growth in the technologi
cal export market, which he hopes
will soar to over $8 billion by 2010, a
fivefold increase from today.
Russian businesses are "over
taxed compared to other competi
tive nations," Milovantsev said. He
called on the government to enact
"stimulating regulations," which
should ease the tax burden for IT
firms in Russia and even cover the
cost of their utilities, such as water
and electricity.
"IT companies should cover IT
and that's it,"he added.
Several panelists pointed to
Putin's January meeting in Novosi
birsk — where he pledged tax
breaks and $650 million of state
funds to boost the straggling IT in
dustry — as an example of a major
step toward the business-friendly
policies that Milovantsev and others
advocated.
In the keynote speech, William
Perry, senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution and symposium co-chair,
argued that governments should
take a more precautionary role with
respect to technology.
"Technology is a strange thing,"
Perry said. "With one hand it gives
you great gifts but with the other
hand it stabs you in the back."
As President Bill Clinton's Sec
retary of Defense. Perry played a
key role in disarming the nuclear
weapons held by the former Soviet
Union, and he said that even today
nuclear arms are a terrifying exam
ple of technology's dangerous po
tential.
"There are thousands of nuclear
weapons that we have to keep out of
the hands of terrorists," Perry said.
"The United States of course wor
ries that terrorists would detonate
the bomb in an American city."
Technologies that can be applied
on the global scale, including vari
ous forms of IT, also have the po
tential to cause great harm. Perry
said.
This kind of technology is "a fan
tastic success story." he continued,
citing the ease of communication
and shipment around the world.
"But of course there will be unin
tended consequences" — for exam
ple. the critical level of unemploy
ment in much of Europe due to out
sourcing.
"As we salute the unprecedented
achievements [of globalization], we
should note that the unemployed
assembly worker in England...does
not share our enthusiasm," Perry
said.
He urged global political institu
tions like the GB, an organization of
the world's eight wealthiest nations,
to discuss the dangers of global
technology and work to avoid the
social backlash caused by outsourc
ing.
Still, a handful of speakers
shared success stories about out
sourcing in Russia, focusing on how
their companies benefited from the
eager and educated Russian work
force.
Intel, for instance, has longstand
ing partners and investments in
Russia, said Claude Leglise, vice
president of the software giant.
Michael Schwab, director of
sales and marketing for I-many Inc.
in Menlo Park, told The Daily that
his company has had good experi
ence with Russian engineers and
computer scientists, and that if he
were to open a business in the fu
ture, he would definitely consider
hiring skilled workers in Russia.
However, the Russian consumer
market is "not even on the radar" as
a potential source of new cus
tomers, Schwab said. Products de
veloped in Russia are by and large
funneled back to western markets.
On Friday night. Perry declared
the symposium a success, saying
that "people are coming togeth
er...to make deals — and that's real
ly why we're here."
The main sponsors of the second
annual USRTS are Dow Jones and
The Wall Street Journal. Among
the Stanford faculty who spoke at
the symposium were Coit Blacker,
director of the Stanford Institute for
International Affairs; Tom Byers,
professor of management science
and engineering; and Katharine Ku,
director of the Office of Technology
Licensing.
