### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
To address issues confronting the black legal community, in
cluding the responsibility professionally successful blacks have
to other blacks, the Stanford Black Law Students Association,
or BLSA, held a conference on Saturday entitled "Beyond
Black Letter Law."
"This year's theme is bridging critical disparities confronting
contemporary black America," said Kourtney James, a third
year law student and conference chair. "This conference creates
a forum to discuss these issues and allows people to begin to
enact changes in their own communities."
James said that the conference was.in part, sparked by re
cent comments made by comedian and sitcom star Bill Cosby in
which he accused blacks in lower socio-economic levels of "not
holding up their end of the bargain."
"Some of the main issues we are discussing at this conference
are what is the nature of this bargain and what are the obliga
tions between those members of the black community who
have reached academic success and those who haven't," she
said.
The conference featured four panel discussions ranging
from issues such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act to the representa
tion of blacks in the media.
