### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
To address issues confronting the black legal community, in
cluding the responsibility professionally successful blacks have
to other blacks, the Stanford Black Law Students Association,
or BLSA, held a conference on Saturday entitled "Beyond
Black Letter Law."
"This year's theme is bridging critical disparities confronting
contemporary black America," said Kourtney James, a third
year law student and conference chair. "This conference creates
a forum to discuss these issues and allows people to begin to
enact changes in their own communities."
James said that the conference was.in part, sparked by re
cent comments made by comedian and sitcom star Bill Cosby in
which he accused blacks in lower socio-economic levels of "not
holding up their end of the bargain."
"Some of the main issues we are discussing at this conference
are what is the nature of this bargain and what are the obliga
tions between those members of the black community who
have reached academic success and those who haven't," she
said.
The conference featured four panel discussions ranging
from issues such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act to the representa
tion of blacks in the media.
Lia Epperson, director of education for the NAAC'P Legal
Defense Fund and Stanford Law
School graduate, was a member of the
first panel, entitled "Looking Back
and Moving Forward: Commemorat
ing the 1964 Civil Rights Act."
"In this conference, we discussed
the significance of the acts and the
challenges for the future, including
the enforcement and maintenance of
civil rights protection," Epperson
said.
First-year law student Perrin
Wright said she thought the panel was
valuable.
"This was a very informative and
engaging panel discussion," she said.
"It gave me an idea of the issues facing
the legal community are and got me to
start thinking about what kind of work
1 want to do as a public interest
lawyer."
According to Irene Joe, president
of the BLSA and third-year law stu
dent, all four panel discussions fea
tured prominent members of acade
mia and the black legal community.
"We started brainstorming topics
that are at the forefront right now and
then we assigned people to research
the topics and find who would be good
to speak at the panel," she said.
The panels featured members such
as J. Christopher Hamilton, produc
tion and development attorney for
MTV; Brad Seligman, executive direc
tor of The Impact Fund, a non-profit

foundation that aids class-action law
suits; and Melissa Harris-Lacewell, as
sistant professor of Political Science at
the University of Chicago.
The conference, according to
James, was not just for law students, but
for the entire student body and mem
bers of the surrounding community.
"The panels did not feature too
much legalese,' and the topics were
very wide and diverse so there was
something for everyone," she said.
Third-year law student, Monique
Fuentes, said she was excited about at
tending the conference.
"Here at the Stanford Law School
we don't discuss these particular is
sues too much, so I jumped at the
chance to hear about them," she said.
Fuentes' classmate Aarti Kotak,
agreed.
"All of the panelists had anywhere
from six to 24 years of experience,
which is absolutely amazing," she
said. "It was really nice to hear a his
torical perspective to see how the is
sues have developed."
According to James, the last time
this conference was held was in 1998,
but the BLSA is attempting to turn it
into an annual event. The conference
was funded by 15 private firms and by
the Stanford Law School, but it was
entirely student-run and -organized.
"This conference is important for
all students, but particularly for law
students who need to understand the
significance and history of the legisla
tion we currently have," Epperson
said. "We need to spread knowledge
of the challenges facing the legal com
munity in the 21st century."

are what is the nature of this bargain and what are the obliga
tions between those members of the black community who
have reached academic success and those who haven't," she
said.
The conference featured four panel discussions ranging
from issues such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act to the representa
tion of blacks in the media.
Lia Epperson, director of education for the NAAC'P Legal
Defense Fund and Stanford Law
School graduate, was a member of the
first panel, entitled "Looking Back
and Moving Forward: Commemorat
ing the 1964 Civil Rights Act."
"In this conference, we discussed
the significance of the acts and the
challenges for the future, including
the enforcement and maintenance of
civil rights protection," Epperson
said.
First-year law student Perrin
Wright said she thought the panel was
valuable.
"This was a very informative and
engaging panel discussion," she said.
"It gave me an idea of the issues facing
the legal community are and got me to
start thinking about what kind of work
1 want to do as a public interest
lawyer."
According to Irene Joe, president
of the BLSA and third-year law stu
dent, all four panel discussions fea
tured prominent members of acade
mia and the black legal community.
"We started brainstorming topics
that are at the forefront right now and
then we assigned people to research
the topics and find who would be good
to speak at the panel," she said.
The panels featured members such
as J. Christopher Hamilton, produc
tion and development attorney for
MTV; Brad Seligman, executive direc
tor of The Impact Fund, a non-profit

foundation that aids class-action law
suits; and Melissa Harris-Lacewell, as
sistant professor of Political Science at
the University of Chicago.
The conference, according to
James, was not just for law students, but
for the entire student body and mem
bers of the surrounding community.
"The panels did not feature too
much legalese,' and the topics were
very wide and diverse so there was
something for everyone," she said.
Third-year law student, Monique
Fuentes, said she was excited about at
tending the conference.
"Here at the Stanford Law School
we don't discuss these particular is
sues too much, so I jumped at the
chance to hear about them," she said.
Fuentes' classmate Aarti Kotak,
agreed.
"All of the panelists had anywhere
from six to 24 years of experience,
which is absolutely amazing," she
said. "It was really nice to hear a his
torical perspective to see how the is
sues have developed."
According to James, the last time
this conference was held was in 1998,
but the BLSA is attempting to turn it
into an annual event. The conference
was funded by 15 private firms and by
the Stanford Law School, but it was
entirely student-run and -organized.
"This conference is important for
all students, but particularly for law
students who need to understand the
significance and history of the legisla
tion we currently have," Epperson
said. "We need to spread knowledge
of the challenges facing the legal com
munity in the 21st century."
