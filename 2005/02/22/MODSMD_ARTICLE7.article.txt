# Open-heart surgery saves premature baby
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Weighing in at just 1.5 pounds, the smallest pre
mature baby ever to survive open-heart surgery
that required switching the aorta and pulmonary
artery was successfully operated on Thursday by a
Stanford pediatric cardiac surgeon and professor
at Lucille Packard Children's Hospital.

The surgeon was V. Mohan Reddy, chief of the
division of pediatric cardiac surgery at the hospital.
His patient, Jerrick De Leon, was delivered pre
maturely in January and referred to Reddy by pe
diatricians in Southern California.
Reddy is an expert in performing open-heart
surgery on premature infants, and has performed
De Leon's procedure, called an arterial switch
more than 150 times.

The surgery is usually performed on infants
weighing between four and five pounds. It corrects
a condition called transposition of the great arter
ies, which occurs in babies when the arteries carry
ing oxygenated and deoxvgenated blood in the
heart are reversed.
In such patients, oxygenated blood is pumped
back Id the lungs, while deoxygenat
ed blood circulates throughout the
body. Although babies born with the
condition can breathe normally, they
are born blue and struggle to circu
late sufficient oxygen to survive.
With a heart no larger than a sin
gle grape and arteries only millime
ters in diameter, DeLeon was at

greatly increased the risk during the
operation.
"When you do cardiac surgery
on children, you're living on the
edge," Roddy said at a press confer
ence on Thursday. "We had to real
ly be very gentle and careful. Every
thing you do has to be very scaled
down and meticulous."
DeLeon's mother, Maria Lourdes
De Leon, is also a pediatrician. Jer
rick DeLeon was born after a spike in
blood pressure caused his mother to
go into labor 13 weeks early, on Jan
30. He was delivered in a hospital in

Southern California and later was
airlifted to Stanford.
Initially, doctors said the baby
had no chance for survival. He
weighed only 24 ounces, and his
physicians considered his condition
both fatal and inoperable.
Maria Lourdes DeLeon told CNN
she was felt very lucky to find a doc
tor willing to take the risk.
"There have been ups and
downs," she said, speaking of her
son. who will remain hospitalized for
at least another month. "But he's a
feisty little one. He's very strong."

Jerrick De Leon's operation is the
latest in series of successes for
Packard Hospital, which boasts the
state-of-the-art Children's Heart
Center and the Pediatric Advanced
Therapies Center, specializing in the
latest medical treatments for chil
dren with heart failure.
In 2002, Reddy successfully
performed a similar procedure on
another child, born at 25 weeks
and weighing only 1.4 pounds. At
the time, she was the youngest
baby ever to survive open-heart
surgery.
