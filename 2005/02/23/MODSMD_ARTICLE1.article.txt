### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
The financial fates of many stu
dent groups were determined at last
night's ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate meeting, during which the Sen
ate voted on which groups will be
placed on the special-fees ballot for
the spring elections.
Placement on this ballot —
which required a three-fifths major
ity vote of senators present at the
meeting — allows students to vote
in favor or against allocating the rec
ommended amount of money to the
student groups from special-fees
funds.
Both undergraduate and gradu
ate students contribute to the spe
cial-fees funds every year as part of
their tuition.

Whether a group should be
placed on the ballot and the amount
of money that will be voted upon by
students was based on a recommen
dations by the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate Appropriations Commit
tee, made up of undergraduate sen
ators. For groups that are requesting
funds from both the undgraduate
and graduate populations, the rec
ommendations were made by a joint
committee consisting of Graduate
Student Council members and un
dergraduate senators.
Seven of the 37 student groups
that requested money from the spe
cial-fees fund were not approved to
be put on the ballot: Jewish Stu
dents' Association, The Stanford
Daily, Stanford Dance Marathon,
Stanford Mock Trial, Forum for
American Chinese Exchange at

Stanford, Stanford Bioscience
Quarterly and Volunteer in Latin
America.
Junior Carla Fenves, president of
the Jewish Leadership Council, rep
resented the association, stating that
not only was the money necessary to
run the group's yearly events but
that they "also wanted recognition
and support from the ASSU Senate
to be considered a part of the com
munity."
A representative from Dance
Marathon said that his group, for the
time being, needs special-fees funding.
"We are a new group and we put
on the most successful first-year
Dance Marathon in the country,"
said senior Sanjay Shah. "In the long
term, we could be a self-sustaining
group, but for our first few years, we
cannot sustain ourselves."

One reason the Appropriations
Committee did not approve the
Dance Marathon group's ballot re
quest was that the students managed
to put on the event this year without
having received special-fee funds.
Los Salseros de Stanford, Six De
grees: A Stanford Journal of Human

Rights and the Stanford Solar Car
Project, three groups which were
originally recommended not to be
placed on the ballot, were ultimate
ly approved by the Senate.
Undergraduate student groups
that made the special fees ballot for
the first time this year will need to

present a petition signed by 10 per
cent of the student body in order to
receive funds. For those groups that
did not make it onto the ballot or
that disagree with the amount allo
cated to them, a petition signed by
15 percent is required for reconsid
eration.
