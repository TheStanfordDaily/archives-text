# Alumnae promote unique science jobs

### BETSY WALLS 
Discussing the paths that they took from scientific doctoral
programs to atypical careers for science majors, two Stanford
alumnae spoke at a seminar last night hosted by the Women's
Committee on Graduate Life, or WCGL.
As the second event in the group's "Perspectives Semi
nar Series," the seminar featured Angelic Agarwal, who
earned her Ph.D. at Stanford and now works as a scientific
communications writer at Affymetrix, a technology devel
opment company, and Pamela Sherwood, also a former
Stanford doctoral candidate who is working as a patent
agent for Bozicevic, Field and Francis, an intellectual prop
erty law firm.
Both speakers shed light on how they found their current jobs
and the success they've found in departing from more tradition
al careers as scientists.
Third-year doctoral candidate Alice Lincoln, a member of
the WCGL, said that the group had been planning the event for
months.
She added that students who study chemistry are often forced
to choose between academia and scientific industry.
Lincoln stressed that the answer is sometimes "neither." She

explained that patent law and policy work are alternatives that
are easily overshadowed by professions considered more "stan
dard" for trained scientists.
Both speakers concurred with Lincoln.
"1 was often warned 1 would miss science — 1 don't," Agarw
al said, adding that though her job is marketing-oriented, she still
applies her scientific knowledge on a regular basis.
"As much as I loved science, I hated being in the lab," Sher
wood said. "1 just couldn't stand killing another mouse."
She encouraged science students with an interest in writing to
consider patent law.
"We like our work," Sherwood said. "It's a little bit stressful
sometimes but it pays really well."
Fourth-year chemistry doctoral candidate Nahrain Kamber,
financial officer for the WCGL and event organizer, said. "The
focus of the event was allowing students to realize there are al
ternative careers in science."
She also highlighted the importance of realizing "there are
things to do outside the lab."
Aditi Chandra, a doctoral candidate in materials science and
engineering, who attended the event, said she attended the event
because she "just wanted to see what else was out there...what
others had chosen, their career paths."
