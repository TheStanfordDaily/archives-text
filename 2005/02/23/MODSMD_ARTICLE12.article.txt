On Feb. 23, 1927, The Daily cov
ered a story about Cardinal golf star,
Ed Meyberg, who captured the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Cup. Below is
an excerpt:
"Edwin Meyberg brought the
California Intercollegiate Golf
championship to Stanford Monday
by defeating Harold Thompson of
the University of California-South
ern Branch, in the 36-hold finals of
the tourney, two up, at Pebble
Beach.
"To win the title, Meyberg
played better golf than he had
shown at any other time in the tour
ney, despite a drizzling rain that last
ed all day.

"In the first 18 holes of the cham
pionship match, Thompson, the de
fending champion and heavy fa
vorite, piled up a two-hole lead, only
to lose it at the 17th and 18th holes,
when he hooked tee shots into the
sea.
"At the 17th tee, Meyberg was
dormie two. Thompson ran down a
twenty-foot putt fora win on the
hole, cutting the Stanford player's
lead to one hole, and then he again
hooked a tee shot from the 18th into
the ocean. He lost the hole and the
match two up."
