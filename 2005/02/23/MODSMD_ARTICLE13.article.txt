# Grad students lobby in D.C.
## 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three members of the Graduate Student
Council recently ventured to Washington. D.C.
to lobby for bills concerning tax and interest
rates for graduate students.
These GSC members — Tom Lee, a repre
sentative of the School of Engineering; Marcus
Folch, the representative of the School of Hu
manities; and Jenny Allen, a constitutional
council member and also a reporter for The
Daily — lobbied in both the House of Repre
sentatives and the Senate.
The event was scheduled by the Association
of Graduate and Professional Students, a non
profit and nonpartisan group of which the GSC
is a member. This association plans two legisla
tive action days per year for graduate students
to lobby for and against specific bills addressing
rights of graduate students. Other schools in at
tendance included Duke University. Kent State
University, Ohio State University, University
of Cincinnati and Yale University.
The first bill, entitled the Higher Education

Affordability and Equity Act, would reduce tax
burden on scholarships and increase the tax de
ductions available on interest rates for student
loans. The GSC had voted 3-2-3 in support of
this bill last year and current GSC president
Moriah Thomason. a medical student, went to
D.C. to advocate for this bill in February, 2004.
The three representatives lobbied again for this
bill last week.
The second bill, called the Reauthorization
of Title IV of the Higher Education Act, would
unlock interest rates when students are consol
idating their loans. For instance, students cur
rently taking out loans with a 4.2 percent inter
est rate would pay this amount of interest for
the duration of their loan.
By pitching this bill. Congress is attempting
to adjust the interest to variable rates that
would rise and fall according to the country's
interest rate. The bill would also make graduate
students unable to take out loans with more
than one agency, thus decreasing competition
and choice of different companies for students.
The delegation from the GSC lob
bied against this bill.
The group met with about 20 rep
resentatives as well as California
senators Diane Feinstein and Bar
bara Boxer, both Democrats. Folch
said he felt that the response of the
officials was positive overall.
"Of the representatives we met
with, about half were positive about
the bills and two committed explicit
ly to them," Folch said. "But anoth
er five said although they like the
idea, they could not support it be
cause of Bush's current budget. It
just wasn't feasible."
In addition to these two bills, the
three GSC members lobbied against

provisions in President George W.
Hush's proposed budget that would
increase Pell grants and scale hack
educational tunding programs such
as Perkins loans.
"While we support increasing
Poll Grants, these grants cannot be
used for graduate school," said
Thomas Lee, a third-year doctoral
candidate in electrical engineering,
who spearheaded the trip to D.C.
"Cuting other educational tunding
programs for this increase deprives
graduate students of opportunities
to fund their education. Funding
for the increase in Pell Grants
should come from another
source."
Allen said she felt the trip was an
overwhelming success.
"We effectively communicated
our message and represented the
students of Stanford," she said. "I
have great faith that the (bill we were

lobbying for] will gain the necessary
co-sponsorship and continue as a bill
on Capitol Hill, in part thanks to our
lobbying venture."
Folch said the GSC leadership
plans to hold informational sessions
for graduate students concerning
these bills in the future. He also said
the representatives encouraged
them to start letter-writing cam
paigns to their local members of
Congress. GSC members plan to fol
low up on these bills, fearing that the
bills will die in committee, much like
they did last year.
Folch also said most of the Uni
versity of California schools present
were lobbying more for bills con
cerning visa requirements for inter
national students, since applications
for this group have recently dropped
by 30 percent. He stated that the
Stanford GSC may begin to lobby
more for these bills in the future.
