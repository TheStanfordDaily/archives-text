# Grad students lobby in D.C.
## 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three members of the Graduate Student
Council recently ventured to Washington. D.C.
to lobby for bills concerning tax and interest
rates for graduate students.
These GSC members — Tom Lee, a repre
sentative of the School of Engineering; Marcus
Folch, the representative of the School of Hu
manities; and Jenny Allen, a constitutional
council member and also a reporter for The
Daily — lobbied in both the House of Repre
sentatives and the Senate.
The event was scheduled by the Association
of Graduate and Professional Students, a non
profit and nonpartisan group of which the GSC
is a member. This association plans two legisla
tive action days per year for graduate students
to lobby for and against specific bills addressing
rights of graduate students. Other schools in at
tendance included Duke University. Kent State
University, Ohio State University, University
of Cincinnati and Yale University.
The first bill, entitled the Higher Education

Affordability and Equity Act, would reduce tax
burden on scholarships and increase the tax de
ductions available on interest rates for student
loans. The GSC had voted 3-2-3 in support of
this bill last year and current GSC president
Moriah Thomason. a medical student, went to
D.C. to advocate for this bill in February, 2004.
The three representatives lobbied again for this
bill last week.
The second bill, called the Reauthorization
of Title IV of the Higher Education Act, would
unlock interest rates when students are consol
idating their loans. For instance, students cur
rently taking out loans with a 4.2 percent inter
est rate would pay this amount of interest for
the duration of their loan.
By pitching this bill. Congress is attempting
to adjust the interest to variable rates that
would rise and fall according to the country's
interest rate. The bill would also make graduate
students unable to take out loans with more
than one agency, thus decreasing competition
and choice of different companies for students.
