# But that's not the point...
## Adventures in vulnerability 
### 
After my column two weeks ago
outed me as an overly picky psycho
person, 1 had to do some serious
thinking about what exactly this col
umn would be about.
My expertise is overanalyzing of
social situations and phenomena. I
can, and will, talk at length about my
extensive experience in scaring men
off, letting my fears get the better of
me and living vicariously through
bad TV shows and movies.
What's dangerous about that,
though, is feeling that 1 am falling
into a rut. 1 don't want you to think
of me as "that girl who writes a col
umn every week justifying her own
craziness." And I don't want to get
so deep in my justifications that I
never challenge myself to learn any
thing new.
I appreciate the e-mails 1 got
after my first column because they
made me question my assumptions
about myself. At the same time, 1
suddenly felt totally and completely
exposed.
1 have no defenses against you —

you can misinter
pret what I say,
and I don't even
know you're
doing it, much
less get to argue
back. Or you can
interpret me cor
rectly, and you,
along with the en
tire readership of

The Daily, will know all my dirty lit
tle secrets. That's a scary concept.
When I wrote my first two
columns, I wasn't thinking about
how people were going to read
them. Now I am. Now I'm worried
that I'll be pigeonholed. I'll be that
girl who writes columns about x
issue, and if you recognize me in
class you'll remember that I'm the
girl who is obsessed with her lacklus
ter love life.
So why do I want to write this
every week? Why do I want to write
about myself, when that will only
give you little bits and pieces of my
personality and allow me to be pi
geonholed or misinterpreted?
What it comes down to is an e
mail that someone sent me last
week: "And sharing vulnerability
(the Olsen twins?) in print, now
THAT is cool." I thought about that
fora while. What he thought was
cool was exactly what I am afraid of.
I've come a long way in this col
umn to make a simple point, which is
that my crisis of vulnerability in writ
ing this column is not specific to me.
Every day, you have the choice to let
someone see your soft underbelly or
to protect yourself from other peo
ple's opinions of you.
Too often, people take the safe
route. But slowly, I'm learning to
agree with that e-mail I got — vul
nerability is cool, and you should
give it a shot.
Of course, it's hard to be vulnera
ble. There are critics everywhere,
and someone will push your buttons.
But that's a good thing too — after
all, it's all the e-mails I got that led
me to this conclusion.
You were right about my first col
umn — I'm not only single because I
want to be, but also because I'm
scared to take risks. But fear of tak
ing chances is a factor not only in
dating and relationships. It's every
where. and it's not just me.
It is a risk for me to write this col
umn every week, and I hope that
doing that achieves more than just
getting my crazy theories out in the
world. I hope that by letting it all out
into the open, that maybe you won't
be surprised the next time someone
you know lets you see their vulnera
bilities. Instead you can feel glad
that someone is willing to share that
part of them — you can respond to
them and help them and get to know
them. And you might decide to
share some of yourself with them in
return.
Next week I'll stop analyzing the
crisis of self-consciousness that I sus
pect is a rite of passage for every
columnist, and I'll talk about some
thing else. But I think this is impor
tant enough to write about now.
We came to Stanford to get to
know other people's experiences
and to share our own. I'm showing
off my neuroses and my vulnerabili
ties because there is a chance that
you can actually get something out
of my stories. More importantly,
there is a chance that seeing me do it
will inspire you to share your own.

After my column two weeks ago
outed me as an overly picky psycho
person, 1 had to do some serious
thinking about what exactly this col
umn would be about.
My expertise is overanalyzing of
social situations and phenomena. I
can, and will, talk at length about my
extensive experience in scaring men
off, letting my fears get the better of
me and living vicariously through
bad TV shows and movies.
What's dangerous about that,
though, is feeling that 1 am falling
into a rut. 1 don't want you to think
of me as "that girl who writes a col
umn every week justifying her own
craziness." And I don't want to get
so deep in my justifications that I
never challenge myself to learn any
thing new.
I appreciate the e-mails 1 got
after my first column because they
made me question my assumptions
about myself. At the same time, 1
suddenly felt totally and completely
exposed.
1 have no defenses against you —

you can misinter
pret what I say,
and I don't even
know you're
doing it, much
less get to argue
back. Or you can
interpret me cor
rectly, and you,
along with the en
tire readership of

The Daily, will know all my dirty lit
tle secrets. That's a scary concept.
When I wrote my first two
columns, I wasn't thinking about
how people were going to read
them. Now I am. Now I'm worried
that I'll be pigeonholed. I'll be that
girl who writes columns about x
issue, and if you recognize me in
class you'll remember that I'm the
girl who is obsessed with her lacklus
ter love life.
So why do I want to write this
every week? Why do I want to write
about myself, when that will only
give you little bits and pieces of my
personality and allow me to be pi
geonholed or misinterpreted?
What it comes down to is an e
mail that someone sent me last
week: "And sharing vulnerability
(the Olsen twins?) in print, now
THAT is cool." I thought about that
fora while. What he thought was
cool was exactly what I am afraid of.
I've come a long way in this col
umn to make a simple point, which is
that my crisis of vulnerability in writ
ing this column is not specific to me.
Every day, you have the choice to let
someone see your soft underbelly or
to protect yourself from other peo
ple's opinions of you.
Too often, people take the safe
route. But slowly, I'm learning to
agree with that e-mail I got — vul
nerability is cool, and you should
give it a shot.
Of course, it's hard to be vulnera
ble. There are critics everywhere,
and someone will push your buttons.
But that's a good thing too — after
all, it's all the e-mails I got that led
me to this conclusion.
You were right about my first col
umn — I'm not only single because I
want to be, but also because I'm
scared to take risks. But fear of tak
ing chances is a factor not only in
dating and relationships. It's every
where. and it's not just me.
It is a risk for me to write this col
umn every week, and I hope that
doing that achieves more than just
getting my crazy theories out in the
world. I hope that by letting it all out
into the open, that maybe you won't
be surprised the next time someone
you know lets you see their vulnera
bilities. Instead you can feel glad
that someone is willing to share that
part of them — you can respond to
them and help them and get to know
them. And you might decide to
share some of yourself with them in
return.
Next week I'll stop analyzing the
crisis of self-consciousness that I sus
pect is a rite of passage for every
columnist, and I'll talk about some
thing else. But I think this is impor
tant enough to write about now.
We came to Stanford to get to
know other people's experiences
and to share our own. I'm showing
off my neuroses and my vulnerabili
ties because there is a chance that
you can actually get something out
of my stories. More importantly,
there is a chance that seeing me do it
will inspire you to share your own.
