# Think you can smoke anywhere? Think again.

Long lines at Jamba Juice and overcrowded yoga classes
would cause one to believe that many, if not most, students on
this campus are very health conscious. That may be the case,
but some students partake in what health educators say is a
dangerous habit: smoking.
While choosing to smoke is ultimately a personal choice,
Stanford students now face stricter regulations within the Bay
Area. The University also has strict policies limiting where
students can smoke, and other universities are following Stan
ford's lead in adopting similar policies.
According to an e-mail survey conducted by Vaden Health
Center in 2004, 15 percent of Stanford students said they had
smoked tobacco in the past 30 days, compared to 32 percent na
tionwide. Seventy-eight percent of students had never used to
bacco products and only 1.5 percent used tobacco products daily.
"Smoking rates for the Stanford undergraduate popula
tion have remained relatively stable over the past four years
and are considerably lower than national averages," said
Ralph Castro, alcohol and drug educator at Vaden.
Many students also reach the same conclusion based on their
own personal observation of smoking on campus over the years.
"I think smoking has stayed the same," said senior Connie
Chan, a non-smoker. "It's hard to tell because you don't see
too many smokers around campus but you know they're
there. Sometimes you smell them down the hall, sometimes
you see them outside late at night."
Senior Jonathan Harvey, who described himself as an oc
casional smoker, attributed the lack of smokers on campus to
anti-smoking campaigns that have caused people to have a
highly negative attitude toward smoking.
"1 feel like smoking at Stanford has something of a stigma
in general," he said. "There appears to be a dogmatic rejec
tion of smoking categorically based on a huge amount of anti
smoking propaganda that people are subjected to throughout
their education."
However, Castro cautions against jumping to the conclu
sion that because there are relatively few smokers at Stanford,
it's not an issue.
"Even though the numbers are lower than national aver
ages, I do believe that smoking is still a problem, especially in
light of all the information we now know about the dangers of
smoking," Castro said.
Few people are oblivious to the negative health effects asso
ciated with smoking, particularly heart disease and lung cancer.
In 1997, the American Council on Science and Health cited

medical evidence fora variety of other harms triggered by
smoking. These include psoriasis (a skin disease marked by red
scaly patches), osteoporosis, earlier loss of hearing, dysfunc
tional sperm, strokes, cataracts and abnormal.eye movement.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven
tion. smoking is also associated with depression and health
compromising behaviors such as high-risk sexual behavior,
fighting and use of alcohol and other drugs.
So why do Stanford students smoke? Harvey began smok
ing when a friend offered him a Cuban cigar at a party and
since has smoked cigars or

cigarettes occasional
ly at or on the way to

parties wilh
friends who are
smokers.
Dan Bent
ley, a cotermi
nal student,
said he began
smoking pipes
his sophomore
year because
they taste
good. are
cheap and
make him
look distin
guished.
"I started
fora very sim
ple reason: 1
am a white
male," Bentley

said. "1 figured if
people were going to
burden their impressions
of me with those

stereotypes, 1
might as well
get the bene
fits. Hence, my

vices shitted trom Playstation
and computers to scotch and
pipe tobacco."
However, smokers at
Stanford can't just light up
anywhere. Stanford is among

many universities that have policies restricting smoking on
campus. All students sign a residence agreement that pro
hibits smoking in enclosed buildings and during outdoor
events on campus.
The University's policy also prohibits the selling of tobac
co products and allows outdoor smoking only in areas "locat
ed far enough away from doorways, open windows, covered
walkways and ventilation systems to prevent smoke from en
tering enclosed buildings and facilities." Violation of the pol
icy. established in 1993. may result in the loss of University
housing privileges.

Not all university policies are as strict as
Stanford's. Princeton passed a ban on smoking
in all undergraduate dormitories earlier this
month despite the fact that the undergraduate
student government, citing privacy concerns,
voted against the policy. Although previous
policies prohibited smoking in common dor
mitory areas, the new policy prevents students
from smoking in private rooms.
"I think [Princeton] made a good decision
h banning smoking in private rooms, despite
what the student body feels," said Stanford
sophomore Eric Teasley. "It's a health issue, a
courtesy issue and a safety issue."
If Stanford students can't smoke in their
private rooms, at least they can still smoke in
oiitdoor areas, right? Not necessarily.
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors
voted in late January to ban smoking in public
parks and recreational areas. The policy
makes San Francisco the first large city in the
country to ban smoking in city parks.
Even some non-smokers at Stanford said
that they feel that this policy might be a little
too extreme.
"The city should consider more effective
ways of dealing with smoking." Teasley said.
" If there's already legislation to prevent smok
ing inside buildings, a ban in public parks may
create a backlash against existing policies."
However, other students said they feel that
this is simply one more measure that will
hopefully discourage people from smoking
and protect the rights of nonsmokers.
"If I'm walking in a park, it's just as much my
right to not smell smoke as it is others' right to
smoke," said senior Ariel M'ndange-Pfupfu.

Stanford can't just light up
anywhere. Stanford is among

many universities that have policies restricting smoking on
campus. All students sign a residence agreement that pro
hibits smoking in enclosed buildings and during outdoor
events on campus.
The University's policy also prohibits the selling of tobac
co products and allows outdoor smoking only in areas "locat
ed far enough away from doorways, open windows, covered
walkways and ventilation systems to prevent smoke from en
tering enclosed buildings and facilities." Violation of the pol
icy. established in 1993. may result in the loss of University
housing privileges.

Not all university policies are as strict as
Stanford's. Princeton passed a ban on smoking
in all undergraduate dormitories earlier this
month despite the fact that the undergraduate
student government, citing privacy concerns,
voted against the policy. Although previous
policies prohibited smoking in common dor
mitory areas, the new policy prevents students
from smoking in private rooms.
"I think [Princeton] made a good decision
h banning smoking in private rooms, despite
what the student body feels," said Stanford
sophomore Eric Teasley. "It's a health issue, a
courtesy issue and a safety issue."
If Stanford students can't smoke in their
private rooms, at least they can still smoke in
oiitdoor areas, right? Not necessarily.
The San Francisco Board of Supervisors
voted in late January to ban smoking in public
parks and recreational areas. The policy
makes San Francisco the first large city in the
country to ban smoking in city parks.
Even some non-smokers at Stanford said
that they feel that this policy might be a little
too extreme.
"The city should consider more effective
ways of dealing with smoking." Teasley said.
" If there's already legislation to prevent smok
ing inside buildings, a ban in public parks may
create a backlash against existing policies."
However, other students said they feel that
this is simply one more measure that will
hopefully discourage people from smoking
and protect the rights of nonsmokers.
"If I'm walking in a park, it's just as much my
right to not smell smoke as it is others' right to
smoke," said senior Ariel M'ndange-Pfupfu.

Long lines at Jamba Juice and overcrowded yoga classes
would cause one to believe that many, if not most, students on
this campus are very health conscious. That may be the case,
but some students partake in what health educators say is a
dangerous habit: smoking.
While choosing to smoke is ultimately a personal choice,
Stanford students now face stricter regulations within the Bay
Area. The University also has strict policies limiting where
students can smoke, and other universities are following Stan
ford's lead in adopting similar policies.
According to an e-mail survey conducted by Vaden Health
Center in 2004, 15 percent of Stanford students said they had
smoked tobacco in the past 30 days, compared to 32 percent na
tionwide. Seventy-eight percent of students had never used to
bacco products and only 1.5 percent used tobacco products daily.
"Smoking rates for the Stanford undergraduate popula
tion have remained relatively stable over the past four years
and are considerably lower than national averages," said
Ralph Castro, alcohol and drug educator at Vaden.
Many students also reach the same conclusion based on their
own personal observation of smoking on campus over the years.
"I think smoking has stayed the same," said senior Connie
Chan, a non-smoker. "It's hard to tell because you don't see
too many smokers around campus but you know they're
there. Sometimes you smell them down the hall, sometimes
you see them outside late at night."
Senior Jonathan Harvey, who described himself as an oc
casional smoker, attributed the lack of smokers on campus to
anti-smoking campaigns that have caused people to have a
highly negative attitude toward smoking.
"1 feel like smoking at Stanford has something of a stigma
in general," he said. "There appears to be a dogmatic rejec
tion of smoking categorically based on a huge amount of anti
smoking propaganda that people are subjected to throughout
their education."
However, Castro cautions against jumping to the conclu
sion that because there are relatively few smokers at Stanford,
it's not an issue.
"Even though the numbers are lower than national aver
ages, I do believe that smoking is still a problem, especially in
light of all the information we now know about the dangers of
smoking," Castro said.
Few people are oblivious to the negative health effects asso
ciated with smoking, particularly heart disease and lung cancer.
In 1997, the American Council on Science and Health cited

medical evidence fora variety of other harms triggered by
smoking. These include psoriasis (a skin disease marked by red
scaly patches), osteoporosis, earlier loss of hearing, dysfunc
tional sperm, strokes, cataracts and abnormal.eye movement.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven
tion. smoking is also associated with depression and health
compromising behaviors such as high-risk sexual behavior,
fighting and use of alcohol and other drugs.
So why do Stanford students smoke? Harvey began smok
ing when a friend offered him a Cuban cigar at a party and
since has smoked cigars or

cigarettes occasional

parties wilh

smokers.
Dan Bent

smoking pipes
his sophomore
