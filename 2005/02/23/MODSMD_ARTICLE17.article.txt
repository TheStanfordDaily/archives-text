# Surfin' California
## 
### PAMELA SUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There is something about riding a perfectly
shaped, overhead wave on a sunny day with a
slight off-shore breeze that you simply can't
describe, according to sophomore Kevin
Padrez, one of many surfers on campus.
The adrenaline rush from pushing the lim
its — surfing larger waves, avoiding gruesome
wipeouts and catching pulses of energy in the
process is what freshman Lucas Berla lives
for.
Between the rigorous course loads and the
crazy extracurricular schedules that Stanford
students balance, is there still time to have
some fun under the sun? As a school in close
proximity to well-known surfing areas, does
Stanford really live up to its California image?
"Stanford is a surf school at heart," said
Berla, who says he is "obsessed with surfing."
Berla sees Stanford students as surfers who
just don't surf. Stanford students have the
physical vigor, adventurousness. creativity
and stoke necessary — all they have to do is
try it once.
Others, like Padrez, claim that surfers
don't really have a huge presence on campus.
Nonetheless, the surfing community can hold
its own.
"I don't think surfing is 'trendy' or 'fash
ionable' like it could be at other beach
schools," Padrez said. "If people like to surf
they're going to do it regardless of the school
they're at or if it is considered 'cool.'"
For Padrez, who started surfing at age nine
in San Diego, Stanford's proximity to some of
the best surfing beaches was definitely a con

sideration in choosing to come to the Farm.
"I decided 1 couldn't go to a college that
was more than an hour from the coast," he
said.
Stanford is more than just close to the
coast. In fact, when it comes to the surfing cul
ture, some of the world's most well-known
surfing spots are just a 30-minute drive away.
For beginners, Linda Mar beach in Pacifica
or the Jetty in Half Moon Bay are good places
to start. Pleasure Point in Santa Cruz is perfect
for intermediates, and for advanced surfers.
Steamer Lane in Santa Cruz or Ocean Beach
in San Francisco are perfect.
In addition, on the northern tip of Half
Moon Bay is world-renowned surfing spot
Mavericks, famous for its 25-foot waves that
break half a mile offshore. The sharp, rigid
rocks make it extremely unwelcoming unless
one is a very experienced surfer, which not
many claim to be.
"I could never surf Maverick," Berla said.
"Even watching the surfers out there from a
cliff seems perilous enough."
Stanford Waveriders, a student-run group
that promotes surfing, brings students togeth
er for surf trips.
Currently, the club has over 2(H) members.
Sophomore Matt Inkeles, president of Wa
veriders, emphasized that all members need is
an interest in surfing. Inkeles, along with other
club members, organizes events such as begin
ner surf trips, beach clean-ups and parties.
Another organization just blossoming on
campus, Surfriders at Stanford, is an environ
mental organization aimed at providing vol
unteer opportunities, research opportunities
and promoting discussion over recent issues

with fellow surfriders. The first meeting this
past week focused on the use of personal wa
tercraft in Monterey Bay National Marine
Sanctuary.
When considering taking up this pastime,
timing is important. Winter is the best season
to surf, although the waves are often very
large and not welcoming for beginners. Au
tumn is known for its calm, consistent waves
breaking throughout the California coast.
The springtime brings less consistent swells
and stronger winds, forcing many springtime
surfers to hit the waves early in the morning.
Berla said that summer is the ideal season to
learn because the waves are small and more
manageable.
Freshman Sarah Schoknecht, a beginner
from Connecticut encouraged other Stanford

students to give surfing a try.
"For some people, it takes a lot of concen
tration and a few lessons while for others, just
one session in the water is enough," she said.
Schoknecht said she is eager to hit the surf
ing beaches once spring comes.
Another thing to consider before taking up
surfing is the equipment. Buying a surfboard
can be costly — the price can range from $3(X)
to $1.()(K), depending on size and shape. How
ever. Padrez claimed the trick is to buy a used
board because in crowded surf, boards tend to
get beaten up pretty easily anyway. Used
boards are often more reasonably priced
around $180.
"Surfing is a great way to forget about ev
erything fora few hours and just enjoy being
in the ocean." Padrez said.
