## Editorial Campus needs more religious dialogue 
### 
In a report presented to the Faculty Senate last
Thursday, Dean of Religious Life Scotty McLennan ex
pressed concerns that religion was not being adequate
ly addressed in classrooms. In response, English Prof.
Robert Polhemus admitted to being "nervous about
having religion influence what should go on in the class
room."
While last week's discussion underscored the impor
tance of having religious discourse on campus, it also re
vealed how uncomfortable members of the Stanford
community are with discussions of religion. While it
may often be wise to keep religion out of the classroom,
it is not apparent why Stanford faculty and students
should be hesitant to even to broach the topic in a class
setting.
Religious discourse and skeptical inquiry do not al
ways go together at Stanford. Some faculty members
and teaching staff present the scientific and rational per
spectives on a particular topic, glossing over or even dis
missing the religious perspectives. Some students might
think that what they are learning at Stanford goes
against their religious upbringing, but feel uncomfort
able disagreeing with the professor about such issues.
Even outside the classroom, this general unease
about religion permeates many other aspects of campus
culture. For instance, many students might feel uncom
fortable discussing religion in the dining halls or talking
about their faith in casual conversations with their dor
mmates.
Such reticence about religious issues is unfortunate
for two reasons. First, discussing religion should be a
part of the process of intellectual exploration that Stan
ford students are committed to undertaking. Even if we
are not religious and will never be religious, we should
not cheat ourselves out of the educational opportunity
of at least talking about religion.
Also, we cannot ignore the increasing global signifi
cance of religion in recent years, with President George
W. Bush's religious rhetoric and the ideological con
flicts between the United States and the Muslim world.
Given the world's current political climate, there is an
increased urgency for Stanford students to become
more aware of and informed about religious issues.
Unfortunately, there is less religious discourse on
campus than there is dialogue about issues of race and
ethnicity, for example.
Such a dearth of religious discourse could contribute
to the insensitivity that is present in campus culture.
Stanford students talking about religion tend to be dis

missive of religious beliefs and those who hold them. A
person who makes an insensitive remark about religion
is more likely to be let off the hook than another who
uses a racist or sexist slur.
Few realize that such a campus culture creates a hos
tile environment for individuals who are confused
about religious issues. Fazed by the unsupportive envi
ronment, they might be less willing to talk about their
problems and therefore unable to find answers to their
questions.
Without greater dialogue, erroneous ideas about re
ligion are more likely to gain currency. People who are
ignorant about these issues are more likely to hold
stereotypical beliefs — that all devout Christians are fa
natics, that all Muslims hate women or that all atheists
lack any sort of moral compass. Consequently, when the
need arises for us to engage in religious dialogue, we will
be needlessly adversarial and antagonistic.
We are not saying that Stanford students should nec
essarily become more religious. However, we do feel
that students should be informed about the diversity of
religious traditions that exist. Also, we think that there
should be more opportunities for religious dialogue on
campus.
To that end, we believe that the Office of Religious
Life plays a crucial role in developing religious dialogue
on campus. We applaud its efforts in sponsoring the
"What Matters to Me and Why" speaker series, the
Grief and Bereavement Workshops and the twice
monthly interfaith forums. We appreciate its broad
range of events, but we feel that it could do more to de
velop an environment in which Stanford students feel
comfortable talking about religion.
Also, we feel that the Department of Religious Stud
ies offers a working model of how religious discourse
might be integrated into a traditional classroom setting.
The University administration should consider working
some of the courses offered by the Department of Reli
gious Studies into the Ethical Reasoning component of
the revised set of General Education Requirements.
In addition, the University should consider doing
more to integrate religious life into residential educa
tion program. Currently, the cultural awareness pro
grams and the introduction of the Cultural Awareness
Associate staff position in selected dorms have demon
strated the University's commitment to greater cultural
dialogue. We think that it would be fruitful to explore
the possibilities of similar programs that would explore
religious issues in a supportive dorm setting.

room."
While last week's discussion underscored the impor
tance of having religious discourse on campus, it also re
vealed how uncomfortable members of the Stanford
community are with discussions of religion. While it
may often be wise to keep religion out of the classroom,
it is not apparent why Stanford faculty and students
should be hesitant to even to broach the topic in a class
setting.
Religious discourse and skeptical inquiry do not al
ways go together at Stanford. Some faculty members
and teaching staff present the scientific and rational per
spectives on a particular topic, glossing over or even dis
missing the religious perspectives. Some students might
think that what they are learning at Stanford goes
against their religious upbringing, but feel uncomfort
able disagreeing with the professor about such issues.
Even outside the classroom, this general unease
about religion permeates many other aspects of campus
culture. For instance, many students might feel uncom
fortable discussing religion in the dining halls or talking
about their faith in casual conversations with their dor
mmates.
Such reticence about religious issues is unfortunate
for two reasons. First, discussing religion should be a
part of the process of intellectual exploration that Stan
ford students are committed to undertaking. Even if we
are not religious and will never be religious, we should
not cheat ourselves out of the educational opportunity
of at least talking about religion.
Also, we cannot ignore the increasing global signifi
cance of religion in recent years, with President George
W. Bush's religious rhetoric and the ideological con
flicts between the United States and the Muslim world.
Given the world's current political climate, there is an
increased urgency for Stanford students to become
more aware of and informed about religious issues.
Unfortunately, there is less religious discourse on
campus than there is dialogue about issues of race and
ethnicity, for example.
Such a dearth of religious discourse could contribute
to the insensitivity that is present in campus culture.
Stanford students talking about religion tend to be dis

missive of religious beliefs and those who hold them. A
person who makes an insensitive remark about religion
is more likely to be let off the hook than another who
uses a racist or sexist slur.
Few realize that such a campus culture creates a hos
tile environment for individuals who are confused
about religious issues. Fazed by the unsupportive envi
ronment, they might be less willing to talk about their
problems and therefore unable to find answers to their
questions.
Without greater dialogue, erroneous ideas about re
ligion are more likely to gain currency. People who are
ignorant about these issues are more likely to hold
stereotypical beliefs — that all devout Christians are fa
natics, that all Muslims hate women or that all atheists
lack any sort of moral compass. Consequently, when the
need arises for us to engage in religious dialogue, we will
be needlessly adversarial and antagonistic.
We are not saying that Stanford students should nec
essarily become more religious. However, we do feel
that students should be informed about the diversity of
religious traditions that exist. Also, we think that there
should be more opportunities for religious dialogue on
campus.
To that end, we believe that the Office of Religious
Life plays a crucial role in developing religious dialogue
on campus. We applaud its efforts in sponsoring the
"What Matters to Me and Why" speaker series, the
Grief and Bereavement Workshops and the twice
monthly interfaith forums. We appreciate its broad
range of events, but we feel that it could do more to de
velop an environment in which Stanford students feel
comfortable talking about religion.
Also, we feel that the Department of Religious Stud
ies offers a working model of how religious discourse
might be integrated into a traditional classroom setting.
The University administration should consider working
some of the courses offered by the Department of Reli
gious Studies into the Ethical Reasoning component of
the revised set of General Education Requirements.
In addition, the University should consider doing
more to integrate religious life into residential educa
tion program. Currently, the cultural awareness pro
grams and the introduction of the Cultural Awareness
Associate staff position in selected dorms have demon
strated the University's commitment to greater cultural
dialogue. We think that it would be fruitful to explore
the possibilities of similar programs that would explore
religious issues in a supportive dorm setting.

In a report presented to the Faculty Senate last
Thursday, Dean of Religious Life Scotty McLennan ex
pressed concerns that religion was not being adequate
ly addressed in classrooms. In response, English Prof.
Robert Polhemus admitted to being "nervous about
having religion influence what should go on in the class
