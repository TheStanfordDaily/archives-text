# Feeling a little bio-curious?
## Fuzzies face pre-req battle 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tracy Petznick, a sopho
more majoring in inter-

national relations,
might work for an ,

environmental orga
nization after she

graduates, so she
wants to take an ecolo
gy class offered by the

Biological Sciences depart
ment. But first she has to
overcome a psychological
barrier.

"Prerequisites are scary," she explained, refer
ring to the required classes she must take in order
to qualify for the courses that pique her interest.
Pet/nick is not alone. Humanities and social sci
ence majors who want to learn about cell biology
or about the structure of the genome have found
that their opportunities for serious study of the
hard sciences can be limited at Stanford. In con
trast, students in the hard sciences say they feel en
couraged to take elective classes on subjects rang
ing from International Security to Jane Austen.
"It's a significant problem," says Prof. Robert
Simoni, who is chair of the Biological Sciences de
partment. "Most people say if you're a student in
the natural sciences you get pretty good access to
the humanities, but if you're a humanist or social
scientist, the exposure to the natural sciences is not
great."

'Fuzzy' students struggle to take 'techie' classes

Prerequisites and core sequences are part, but
not all, of the problem. Sometimes departments sim
ply lack the resources, in terms of money and man
power, to teach non-science majors. The Biological
Sciences department is not the only department that
humanities and social sciences students have diffi
culty accessing, although it can be viewed as repre
sentative ol the problem.
Some of the most popular science courses are the
ones that are open to humanities and social science
students, l or example, Biology Prof. Robert Sapol
sky's enormously popular "1 luman Behavioral Biol
ogy" class, which has no prerequisites, drew over 600
students last year, many ol them non-science majors,
according to Sapolsky.
Aside from Sapolsky's class and one or two oth
ers, "bio-curious iuzzies" are limited to one of the
department's 12 freshman and sophomore introduc
tory seminars.
During her freshman year. Pet/nick look an in
troductory seminar called "Plants and Civilizations"
through the Biological Sciences department She
loved the course but said "it was basically a history of
imperialism" that described how plants moved
across the world but not how environmental systems
worked.
What Pet/nick really wants to take is "Plant Biol
ogy, I 'volution, and I Ecology," the third course in the
biology core sequence. I lowever, in the Stanford
Bulletin the course has a heavy list of prerequisite
classes that she has not taken, including the entire

chemistry core.
Hie chemistry core has a reputation for difficulty
and competitiveness that can frighten even the most
intense of biology majors.
Junior I )aniea I .omcli came to Stanford thinking
she would go to medical school after graduation. But
during her freshman year, she said she was so "over
whelmed and intimidated" by the chemistry core that
she dropped the whole idea of becoming a doctor.
"I think it's a horrible idea that people are imme
diately put in an environment that is highly stressful
and competitive," I .omeli said of the chemistry core,
which is designed to be taken during freshman year.
"It makes a lot of smart kids feel stupid."
I'ventually, I .omeli came back to the chemistry
core in her sophomore year, when she had "more
perspective." She is now majoring in biology.
I .omeli said that even the Bio core classes can Ix
intimidating. She guessed that about MX) students
dropped her core class between the first day and the
first midterm.
Biology Prof. Martha Cyert, who teaches cell bi
ology in the core sequence, said she "emphatically"
disagreed with the commonly held notion that biol
ogy core classes are intended to "weed out" stu
dents. But she said that the chemistry prerequisite
was a "reality of the biology core."
However, Simoni said that while courses in the
biology core are not designed for non-science ma
jors, they can be "quite accessible" to these stu
dents, even if they have not taken the chemistry

core, provided they arc willing to put in some extra
work.
While maintaining that the core is not for every
one, Simoni suggested that it might benefit very will
ing and motivated non-science majors to know that
they could take one or more of the core classes with
out an advanced knowledge of chemistry.
"1 don't think we've tried to advertise it, hut
maybe we ought to," Simoni said.
Another option is for "techie" departments to
design courses specifically for non-science majors,
but this raises another nest of problems dealing with
faculty and budgetary resources.
Some biology professors, for example, believe
that their department already offers too few upper
division courses for the number of majors they have.
"To mount the effort fora really first-class non
majors course, we would have to have additional
people to do it or to shift some of the responsibilities
of existing faculty," said Hiological Science Prof. 11.
Craig 1 Icller.
Heller's comment highlights the difficulty of
making science available to those who want to learn
it at a university where individual departments often
must compete for resources.
"We can and ought to do a better job of teaching
science to non-science majors," Prof. Simoni said.
"Science is an increasingly important part of our
lives, and if people leave here without at least a con
versant knowledge in it, they're not going to be able
to participate in that part of their lives."

"1 don't think we've tried to advertise it, hut
maybe we ought to," Simoni said.
Another option is for "techie" departments to
design courses specifically for non-science majors,
but this raises another nest of problems dealing with
faculty and budgetary resources.
Some biology professors, for example, believe
that their department already offers too few upper
division courses for the number of majors they have.
"To mount the effort fora really first-class non

"We can and ought to do a better job of teaching
science to non-science majors," Prof. Simoni said.
"Science is an increasingly important part of our
lives, and if people leave here without at least a con

to participate in that part of their lives."
Tracy Petznick, a sopho
more majoring in inter-

national relations,
might work for an ,

environmental orga
nization after she

graduates, so she
wants to take an ecolo
gy class offered by the

Biological Sciences depart
ment. But first she has to
overcome a psychological
barrier.

"Prerequisites are scary," she explained, refer

to qualify for the courses that pique her interest.
Pet/nick is not alone. Humanities and social sci
ence majors who want to learn about cell biology
or about the structure of the genome have found
that their opportunities for serious study of the
hard sciences can be limited at Stanford. In con
trast, students in the hard sciences say they feel en
couraged to take elective classes on subjects rang
ing from International Security to Jane Austen.
"It's a significant problem," says Prof. Robert
Simoni, who is chair of the Biological Sciences de
partment. "Most people say if you're a student in
the natural sciences you get pretty good access to
the humanities, but if you're a humanist or social
scientist, the exposure to the natural sciences is not
great."

'Fuzzy' students struggle to take 'techie' classes

Prerequisites and core sequences are part, but
not all, of the problem. Sometimes departments sim
ply lack the resources, in terms of money and man
power, to teach non-science majors. The Biological
Sciences department is not the only department that
humanities and social sciences students have diffi
culty accessing, although it can be viewed as repre
sentative ol the problem.
Some of the most popular science courses are the
ones that are open to humanities and social science
students, l or example, Biology Prof. Robert Sapol
sky's enormously popular "1 luman Behavioral Biol
ogy" class, which has no prerequisites, drew over 600
students last year, many ol them non-science majors,
according to Sapolsky.
Aside from Sapolsky's class and one or two oth
ers, "bio-curious iuzzies" are limited to one of the
department's 12 freshman and sophomore introduc
tory seminars.
During her freshman year. Pet/nick look an in
troductory seminar called "Plants and Civilizations"
through the Biological Sciences department She
loved the course but said "it was basically a history of
imperialism" that described how plants moved
across the world but not how environmental systems
worked.
What Pet/nick really wants to take is "Plant Biol
ogy, I 'volution, and I Ecology," the third course in the
biology core sequence. I lowever, in the Stanford
Bulletin the course has a heavy list of prerequisite
classes that she has not taken, including the entire

chemistry core.
Hie chemistry core has a reputation for difficulty
and competitiveness that can frighten even the most
intense of biology majors.
Junior I )aniea I .omcli came to Stanford thinking
she would go to medical school after graduation. But
during her freshman year, she said she was so "over
whelmed and intimidated" by the chemistry core that
she dropped the whole idea of becoming a doctor.
"I think it's a horrible idea that people are imme
diately put in an environment that is highly stressful
and competitive," I .omeli said of the chemistry core,
which is designed to be taken during freshman year.
"It makes a lot of smart kids feel stupid."
I'ventually, I .omeli came back to the chemistry
core in her sophomore year, when she had "more
perspective." She is now majoring in biology.
I .omeli said that even the Bio core classes can Ix
intimidating. She guessed that about MX) students
dropped her core class between the first day and the
first midterm.
Biology Prof. Martha Cyert, who teaches cell bi
ology in the core sequence, said she "emphatically"
disagreed with the commonly held notion that biol
ogy core classes are intended to "weed out" stu
dents. But she said that the chemistry prerequisite
was a "reality of the biology core."
However, Simoni said that while courses in the
biology core are not designed for non-science ma
jors, they can be "quite accessible" to these stu
dents, even if they have not taken the chemistry

core, provided they arc willing to put in some extra
work.
While maintaining that the core is not for every
one, Simoni suggested that it might benefit very will
ing and motivated non-science majors to know that
they could take one or more of the core classes with
out an advanced knowledge of chemistry.
