Tracy Petznick, a sopho
more majoring in inter-

national relations,
might work for an ,

environmental orga
nization after she

graduates, so she
wants to take an ecolo
gy class offered by the

Biological Sciences depart
ment. But first she has to
overcome a psychological
barrier.

"Prerequisites are scary," she explained, refer
ring to the required classes she must take in order
to qualify for the courses that pique her interest.
Pet/nick is not alone. Humanities and social sci
ence majors who want to learn about cell biology
or about the structure of the genome have found
that their opportunities for serious study of the
hard sciences can be limited at Stanford. In con
trast, students in the hard sciences say they feel en
couraged to take elective classes on subjects rang
ing from International Security to Jane Austen.
"It's a significant problem," says Prof. Robert
Simoni, who is chair of the Biological Sciences de
partment. "Most people say if you're a student in
the natural sciences you get pretty good access to
the humanities, but if you're a humanist or social
scientist, the exposure to the natural sciences is not
great."
