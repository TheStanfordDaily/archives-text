# Techie Repairs the World
## The 						Republicans were right 
### 
Do elections strike anyone else as counterproduc
tive? Every few years a large minority of America goes
crazy, and the rest of us forget to vote. If we're lucky, the
executive and legislative branches go to different parties
and nothing happens for four years.
But occasionally, 51 percent of the voters line up and
give the presidency, House and Senate to one party,
which then ejaculates radical legislation all over our
faces. Then the other 4K percent go into a corner and
pout as the majority taunts them with trillions of dollars
of debt and a radical Christian agenda.

How is this winner-take-all system
good for anyone? Even if my guys,
the Dems, win the big three in four
years, we'll just go and piss off the Re
publicans with our balanced budgets
and working healthcare system. If we
don't, then Bush's "reforms" will rub
salt into the wounds of the
Democrats for the next 70 years, just
like the New Deal has been doing to
the Republicans for the last 70.

Clearly this is not the way things should be. Ideally,
people would only he governed by people they have cho
sen. II Utah really thinks Bush should be the president,
does that mean D.C. has to be crushed under a GOP foot
for four years? This leads me to a very disturbing con
clusion. Maybe the Republicans were right all
along...maybe the solution is states' rights.
Maybe people in different parts of the country should
stop preaching to each other. Perhaps I don't have the
right to say Mississippi has to allow abortions. And they
don't have the right to say D.C. can't have medical (or
recreational) marijuana. Maybe assault weapons are just

dandy in West Virginia but not in New York City. Maybe
gays should be able to get married in San Francisco but
not in Ohio.
I know this might be radical, but perhaps 1 don't have
the right to determine how other people live. Maybe I
should be content with making sure that the laws of my
municipality are in accordance with my beliefs, and let
everyone else go to hell in handbaskets they've woven
themselves.
Perhaps a weak federal government is what we need
in order to live harmoniously. Lower federal taxes and
higher local taxes would return government to the gov
erned. Take away the federal government's discre
tionary spending so they can't boss the states around
with relatively small bits of money for healthcare or ed
ucation or highways. We'd let the federal government
manage national defense, certain regulatory bodies like
the FDA and social security (the latter is another column
entirely). That would reduce the size of the federal gov
ernment by maybe 15 percent, but reduce the headaches
it gives us by 50 percent.
I know this would mean hardships. It would mean
knowing that people in other places are doing things that
are wrong and stupid and hurtful. But isn't that better
than having those ignorant fools impose their views on
you? And if you happen to live in a state or community
where you are still a political minority, at least you don't
have to move to Switzerland ... just Vermont... which
may or may not be worse.

Some people really shouldn 't be allowed to write political
columns, because they forgot to vote despite living right
next to a polling place. If you know of anyone like that,
email Rahul Kanakia at rahkan@stanford.edu.
