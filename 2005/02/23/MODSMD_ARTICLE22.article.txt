Campaign Practice Code policy is not new
The Daily seems to be under the impression that
the ASSU is about to take the novel step of making
the Campaign Practice Code a compilation of rele
vant rules enforced by various University depart
ments.
That change, however, isn't a change at all: it's been
true since the CPC was rewritten for the 2001 ASSU
election, after the last major round of Constitutional
Council cases. As for the mess last year, changing the
CPC wouldn't have mattered given that the Undergrad
uate Senate chose to throw out the election based on
rules they made up on the spot.

Redshirts nothing to cry foul over
In response toJohn Martin's letter blastingTara Van-
Derveer on the redshirting of Clare Bodensteiner
("VanDerveer's redshirt policy appalling," Feb. 22):
John is obviously not familiar with athletic scholarships
at Stanford.
A great number of Stanford athletes redshirt each
year for non-injury reasons. Most football players, some
basketball and many distance runners redshirt. All will
be on scholarship, like Bodensteiner, for their fifth year.
Some will graduate in their fifth year, some will be work
ing towards their Masters in their fifth year â€” all at Stan
ford's expense.
