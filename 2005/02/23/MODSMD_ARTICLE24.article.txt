## The 						right's war on community 
### 
Imagine having to pay a dollar
every time you went to the park.
You've never had to do this he
fore. Parks have always been free,
right?
Well, technically no. Public
parks are paid for by tax dollars.
But what happens when govern
ment tax revenue runs low? Well,
then the government has to either
close the parks or charge you a
dollar. Is this something we want?
This is the direction in which we
are headed.
Over the past 40 years, the con-

servative right
has made great
strides in its war
on taxes. Keep
in mind that tax
revenue is what
government
needs to survive.
A war on taxes is
a war on govern
ment, and with

all the wars in the world today, we
really need to ask ourselves if this
is a war we can afford to light.
What's wrong with taxes?
Taxes pay fora lot of things that
we use and enjoy every day. Tax
dollars built the freeways that take
you to and from the airport. Tax
dollars make sure that the drink
ing water is treated and safe. Tax
dollars pay for the police officers
and fire fighters that protect us
and keep us safe.
So if taxes make all of this pos
sible, what's so bad about them?
The answer has a valid economic
component and a perverse politi
cal component.
Taxes do create deadweight
loss, which is economic jargon for
market inefficiency. Per unit taxes
distort incentives and generally re
duce societal surplus. From this
perspective, one can see why we
might want to limit taxation in
order to maximize market effi
ciency.
But more often than not, poli
tics determine policy, and this is
where the misguided reasoning
comes in. Lowering taxes is a gold
mine politically, as it appeals to
the part of us that is purely self-in
terested.

Vote for him and 1 get my
money back? Having more of my
money in my pocket could only he
a good thing, right?

In a word, wrong. Nobody
thinks about the park that will not
be there if the taxes stop coming
in. Nobody thinks of how my $400
refund comes at the expense of a
school's art program. Nobody
equates lower taxes with higher in
fant mortality and more potholes
on the freeway.
Taxes facilitate a sense of com
munity. By paying less in taxes, we
all weaken the social contract.
Take a local example that has
been the subject of endless debate:
ASSU special fees.
In essence, these special fees
are a community tax. It's the price
we all pay if we want to have a cer
tain set of student activities in our
community.
When you ask for your $86 re
fund check, you're saying that you
do not want to support the com
munity, and that a new X-Box
game or two is more important to
you than having the vibrant and
active community here at Stan
ford.
Without special fees, the activi
ties go away.
Project this onto the national
stage, and it doesn't take much to
realize what massive tax cuts could
do. Say goodbye to the National
Endowment for the Arts, the De
partment of Education and, yes,
even social security.
Our president, the nominal
leader of our community, wants to
cut taxes further — this coming in
an age where corporate profits are
at their highest level (as a percent
of GDP) in 75 years. It's not that
we don't have the money, it's that
we're greedy.
It's no accident that President
Lyndon Johnson termed his do
mestic agenda the "Great Soci
ety." He, too, realized that it's the
government's job to facilitate the
construction of community.
The reigning far right does not
see it the same way. They seem to
think that society will be much
better off if it's every man, woman
and child for his or her self.
A war on taxes is a war on com
munity. What are you fighting for?

money back? Having more of my
money in my pocket could only he
a good thing, right?

In a word, wrong. Nobody
thinks about the park that will not
be there if the taxes stop coming
in. Nobody thinks of how my $400
refund comes at the expense of a
school's art program. Nobody
equates lower taxes with higher in
fant mortality and more potholes
on the freeway.
Taxes facilitate a sense of com
munity. By paying less in taxes, we
all weaken the social contract.
Take a local example that has
been the subject of endless debate:
ASSU special fees.
In essence, these special fees
are a community tax. It's the price
we all pay if we want to have a cer
tain set of student activities in our
community.
When you ask for your $86 re
fund check, you're saying that you
do not want to support the com
munity, and that a new X-Box
game or two is more important to
you than having the vibrant and
active community here at Stan
ford.
Without special fees, the activi
ties go away.
Project this onto the national
stage, and it doesn't take much to
realize what massive tax cuts could
do. Say goodbye to the National
Endowment for the Arts, the De
partment of Education and, yes,
even social security.
Our president, the nominal
leader of our community, wants to
cut taxes further — this coming in
an age where corporate profits are
at their highest level (as a percent
of GDP) in 75 years. It's not that
we don't have the money, it's that
we're greedy.
It's no accident that President
Lyndon Johnson termed his do
mestic agenda the "Great Soci
ety." He, too, realized that it's the
government's job to facilitate the
construction of community.
The reigning far right does not
see it the same way. They seem to
think that society will be much
better off if it's every man, woman
and child for his or her self.
A war on taxes is a war on com
munity. What are you fighting for?

Imagine having to pay a dollar
every time you went to the park.
You've never had to do this he
fore. Parks have always been free,
right?
Well, technically no. Public
parks are paid for by tax dollars.
But what happens when govern
ment tax revenue runs low? Well,
then the government has to either
close the parks or charge you a
dollar. Is this something we want?
This is the direction in which we
are headed.
Over the past 40 years, the con-

servative right
has made great
strides in its war
on taxes. Keep
in mind that tax
revenue is what
government
needs to survive.
A war on taxes is
a war on govern
ment, and with

all the wars in the world today, we
really need to ask ourselves if this
is a war we can afford to light.
What's wrong with taxes?
Taxes pay fora lot of things that
we use and enjoy every day. Tax
dollars built the freeways that take
you to and from the airport. Tax
dollars make sure that the drink
ing water is treated and safe. Tax
dollars pay for the police officers
and fire fighters that protect us
and keep us safe.
So if taxes make all of this pos
sible, what's so bad about them?
The answer has a valid economic
component and a perverse politi
cal component.
Taxes do create deadweight
loss, which is economic jargon for
market inefficiency. Per unit taxes
distort incentives and generally re
duce societal surplus. From this
perspective, one can see why we
might want to limit taxation in
order to maximize market effi
ciency.
But more often than not, poli
tics determine policy, and this is
where the misguided reasoning
comes in. Lowering taxes is a gold
mine politically, as it appeals to
the part of us that is purely self-in
terested.
