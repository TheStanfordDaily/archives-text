"Talk about a random act of
kindness. This has got to be the most
random and the kindest thing you
could ever do fora person," said au
thor Eleanor Vincent, urging stu
dents to consider becoming organ
donors at a lxx)k reading last night,
when she discussed her recently re
leased book, "Swimming with
Maya."
A 10-year endeavor, "Swimming
with Maya" is about the death of
Vincent's daughter and Vincents
decision to donate her daughter's or
gans. The book is arranged into
three parts: the horse-riding accident
which caused Maya's death, flash
backs of Maya's life and Vincent's
healing and recovery through her
contact with the organ recipients.
Vincent started the talk with a
jarring description of Maya's death.
"Picture this: you're 19 years old,
you've just been accepted into the
theater program of your dreams and
you and your friends decide to cele
brate by hiking," she said. "You find
an abandoned horse and get on it.
Suddenly the beautiful day turns into
a nightmare when the horse rears.
You fall off and slip into a coma."
Vincent stressed that although
she was in shock, she felt compelled
to say yes to organ donation when
she was told that Maya was brain
dead.
"My mother had died recently of
kidney failure and a kidney trans
plant would have saved her," Vin
cent said. "1 didn't want any family
to go through that kind of loss. I also
couldn't accept that my daughter
was gone. Something had to live
on."
For Vincent, writing "Swimming
with Maya" was an unexpected part
of her healing process.
"I didn't intend to write this
book," she said. "It started out as
journal entries and then when I took
a creative nonfiction class while
completing my MFA at Mills Col
lege, 1 thought maybe this could be a
book. If I had been a dancer, 1 would
have danced it. If I had been a
painter. I would have painted it. But

I'm a writer, so I wrote it."
Another significant moment in
Vincent's recovery was hearing
from and meeting the recipient of
Maya's heart.
"I didn't comprehend the impact
I made until I received a letter from
the wife of the man who had re
ceived Maya's heart," Vincent said.
"She said she prayed for me and my
daughter every day. Suddenly it hit
me-what I had done and what it
meant for the children of this man."
Having become a national
spokesperson for organ donation
since Maya's death in 1992, Vincent
spent a good amount of time during
the talk urging the audience, the ma
jority of which was students, to con
sider organ donation.
"Right now, 80.000 men, women
and children are waiting fora life
saving transplant," she said. "A
third will die waiting. I wrote this
book for young people, for the peo
ple who are the age my daughter
was. I know it's difficult to contem
plate this, but take time to learn
more about the topic of organ dona
tion."
Many students said they found
the talk unique because it was pre
sented by the donor. Normally, re
cipients are the ones to speak out.
"In terms of academic research
done on organ donations, hearing
from a donor family's perspective is
very interesting and plays into my
honors thesis on organ donation
that I'm working on," said senior
Sumeeta Varma. "The donor's side
is very ambiguous and there isn't a
whole lot known or talked about."
Some students said they thought
the talk also put an emotional spin to
the topic.
"The talk was done very well and
it's nice to attach a voice with the
book." said sophomore Kenneth
Shaw, an organizer of the event.
"You don't realize the enormous
contrasting emotions â€” she's
happy and yet her daughter's organs
are being donated. It's hard to con
ceive these emotions without hear
ing it from her."
Vincent's talk was hosted by
Stanford's Organ Donor Education
organization.
