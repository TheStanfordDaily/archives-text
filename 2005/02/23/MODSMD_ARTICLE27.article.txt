## Giambi does not deserve support 
### 
Not even a couple of boos? No signs? No
chants about shrunken testicles? Real
ly?
Are you serious, Tampa? Did you really
give Jason Giambi a hero's welcome upon his
arrival at training camp this week? You real
ize you're putting yourself in the "Giant
Douchebag" category with the people who
showed up to cheer on Michael Jackson at his
trial, right? -
Apparently Yankees fans are ready to for
get Giambi's enormous skeleton, wherein the
San Francisco Chronicle turned up grand jury
testimony from 2003 where he confessed to
having used illegal steroids. He must not have
gotten the "Deny, deny, deny, at least until
Sports Illustrated offers you a tell-all story"
memo from Pete Rose. In any case, now he's

back and ready to play like
nothing happened.
ESPN's article on Gi
ambi's return laments that
soon he'll be subjected to the
torments of road fans, and
that "their signs and their
shouts are sure to inject [did
they really need to choose
that word?] reminders of the
past he hasn't quite admitted

to." Seriously, sports fans, show some decen
cy. If there's one thing Jason Giambi deserves
from the public as a professional athlete, it's
not to be held responsible for his actions.
Of course, I guess this could be expected
from Yankees fans, who have been so condi
tioned to root for anyone who puts on a Yan
kees jersey that they'd cheer for Milton
Bradley if Steinbrenner signed him. Hell, this
is a fan base that gave Steve Howe - a guy who
was suspended for cocaine use nine times - a
fifth, sixth and seventh chance.
Giambi remarked that "For [fans] to voice
their support is pretty incredible." Indeed. I
mean, if 1 blatantly plagiarized someone else's
work and then put it in my column. I wouldn't
really be expecting my employer - or my read
ers - to look at my talents the same way and
continue to endorse me. (But then, Giambi's
fan base is in the tens of millions and mine
can't be more than one or two million, so who
am 1 to judge?)
Usually, when you admit to grossly violat
ing your sport's rules by taking steroids and
human growth hormone, after you've repeat
edly denied using performance-enhancing
drugs, there's some kind of fan backlash. But
not for Giambi. I guess the patrons of so-iron
ically-named-it's-sad Legends Field are only
too happy to welcome him back to the fold. If
I could afford to rip myself away from the de
mands of my classes and exhaustive job search
(cough) I'd be in Tampa shotgunning Coors
Light and screaming things like "Pete Rose
called, he says M A ACO has some more open
ings for spokesmen" and "Show us your
bacne!"
Regardless of one's opinion on MLB's
drug policy (which, for the record, is more im
potent than Bob Dole), the fact remains that
Giambi knowingly broke a rule that con
strained others. Even after the naivete about
widespread steroid use ended - largely as a re
sult of Ken Caminiti's admission that he juiced
up during his playing days in one of Sports ll
lustrated's May 2002 issues - Giambi decided
that it was worth it to cheat, and that will for
ever taint him. Or it should, at least. As far as
I'm concerned, his name should be up there
with Ben Johnson and Pete Rose.
We are fast approaching an understanding
of baseball's past decade or so as irrevocably
flawed. Jose Canseco's recent book, aside
