## Giambi does not deserve support 
### 
Not even a couple of boos? No signs? No
chants about shrunken testicles? Real
ly?
Are you serious, Tampa? Did you really
give Jason Giambi a hero's welcome upon his
arrival at training camp this week? You real
ize you're putting yourself in the "Giant
Douchebag" category with the people who
showed up to cheer on Michael Jackson at his
trial, right? -
Apparently Yankees fans are ready to for
get Giambi's enormous skeleton, wherein the
San Francisco Chronicle turned up grand jury
testimony from 2003 where he confessed to
having used illegal steroids. He must not have
gotten the "Deny, deny, deny, at least until
Sports Illustrated offers you a tell-all story"
memo from Pete Rose. In any case, now he's

back and ready to play like
nothing happened.
ESPN's article on Gi
ambi's return laments that
soon he'll be subjected to the
torments of road fans, and
that "their signs and their
shouts are sure to inject [did
they really need to choose
that word?] reminders of the
past he hasn't quite admitted

to." Seriously, sports fans, show some decen
cy. If there's one thing Jason Giambi deserves
from the public as a professional athlete, it's
not to be held responsible for his actions.
Of course, I guess this could be expected
from Yankees fans, who have been so condi
tioned to root for anyone who puts on a Yan
kees jersey that they'd cheer for Milton
Bradley if Steinbrenner signed him. Hell, this
is a fan base that gave Steve Howe - a guy who
was suspended for cocaine use nine times - a
fifth, sixth and seventh chance.
Giambi remarked that "For [fans] to voice
their support is pretty incredible." Indeed. I
mean, if 1 blatantly plagiarized someone else's
work and then put it in my column. I wouldn't
really be expecting my employer - or my read
ers - to look at my talents the same way and
continue to endorse me. (But then, Giambi's
fan base is in the tens of millions and mine
can't be more than one or two million, so who
am 1 to judge?)
Usually, when you admit to grossly violat
ing your sport's rules by taking steroids and
human growth hormone, after you've repeat
edly denied using performance-enhancing
drugs, there's some kind of fan backlash. But
not for Giambi. I guess the patrons of so-iron
ically-named-it's-sad Legends Field are only
too happy to welcome him back to the fold. If
I could afford to rip myself away from the de
mands of my classes and exhaustive job search
(cough) I'd be in Tampa shotgunning Coors
Light and screaming things like "Pete Rose
called, he says M A ACO has some more open
ings for spokesmen" and "Show us your
bacne!"
Regardless of one's opinion on MLB's
drug policy (which, for the record, is more im
potent than Bob Dole), the fact remains that
Giambi knowingly broke a rule that con
strained others. Even after the naivete about
widespread steroid use ended - largely as a re
sult of Ken Caminiti's admission that he juiced
up during his playing days in one of Sports ll
lustrated's May 2002 issues - Giambi decided
that it was worth it to cheat, and that will for
ever taint him. Or it should, at least. As far as
I'm concerned, his name should be up there
with Ben Johnson and Pete Rose.
We are fast approaching an understanding
of baseball's past decade or so as irrevocably
flawed. Jose Canseco's recent book, aside


Dan McCarthy
from establishing that he has the IQ
of a Hank steak and looks good in
Killer Loop sunglasses, confirmed
everyone's worst fears about
steroids. Tony La Kussa, Canseco's
manager during the period where
he claims to have injected, said that
Canseco "would laugh about the
time that other guys were spending
[working out], and how he didn't
have to, because he was doing the
other helper.'" In so many words,
steroids actually were, and continue
to be, an effective subsiitute.for the
tireless work that players who re
spect the rules put in.
I've always been reluctant to let
the steroid crisis fundamentally
change my view of baseball. I like
thinking that the game speaks for
itself, and that it's exceedingly dif
ficult to illegally alter what hap
pens i)ii the field without introduc
ing Vaseline or sandpaper. I'm
willing to give Marry Bonds and the
others who have fallen under suspi
cion the benefit of the doubt so far.
But for the first time, we have con
firmation of a current big-name
player violating one of baseball's
most fundamental rules - probably
the most fundamental after the ban
on gambling, as oP Pete knows inti
mately.
Because baseball didn't institute
a policy involving testing with sam

pics identified by players until 2(K)4
and Giambi's testimony of admis
sion came in 2(X)3, it's unlikely that
he will be punished. 1 bet the mental
torment is enough, though. 1 hope
he walks the walk of shame through
a hail of "Cheater" cheers, and I
hope it keeps him awake at night
that his chemically-infused body pa
trolled the ground on which Lou
(ichrig once stood.
And as for the cheering Yankees
fans, well, that's the equivalent of
rooting for your heroin dealer. I
may keep watching, but at least I'm
finally ready to admit that the play
ers I pay to see - especially a guy
like (iiambi, who spent the forma
tive years of his career playing fora
small-market club succeeding in a
big-market world - may, as I always
feared, be cheating assholes. I guess
you could say I have the sports ver
sion of battered wife syndrome. I'll
keep coming back, no matter how
bad it gets.
I remember seeing a tattooed
and goateed photo of the hugely
ripped Giambi on the cover of SI
when 1 was about 16 and thinking
how badass he looked and how awe
some it was that he played for the
A's, and how he hadn't yet sold out
to play for the Yankees like all the
other stud players, live years later,
the headline of that magazine still
rings true:
"Jason (liambi: The New l ace of
Baseball."
