# Women's lacrosse shoots past Davis

### DANIEL NOVINSON 
Heading into last weekend's
matchups against Saint Mary's and
UC-Davis. Stanford women's
lacrosse head coach Michelle
Uhlfelder identified many areas in
which her young squad could im
prove.
"We need to get the ball up the
field without so many turnovers,"
Uhlfelder said. "We need to work

history.
Freshman attacker Daphne Pat

chipped in two.
"I just got really good passes
from Sarah Bach and Kelsey Twist
in a scoring position," said Patter

team Stanford crushed early last
season by a 15-4 margin. On Sun
