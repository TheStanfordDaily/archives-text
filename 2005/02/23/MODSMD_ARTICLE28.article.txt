# Women's lacrosse shoots past Davis
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON 
Heading into last weekend's
matchups against Saint Mary's and
UC-Davis. Stanford women's
lacrosse head coach Michelle
Uhlfelder identified many areas in
which her young squad could im
prove.
"We need to get the ball up the
field without so many turnovers,"
Uhlfelder said. "We need to work
on the fundamentals of groundballs
and improve our percentage on 50 /
50 balls. We need to work on con
tinuing to stop the ball in our defen
sive end, work on our positioning
and work on our defensive rota
tion."
The Cardinal's performance this
past weekend soothed many of
Uhlfelder's concerns, as Stanford
(3-0, 3-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) handily disposed of
MPSF foes UC-Davis and Saint
Mary's by a combined score of 25-9.
Stanford's weekend started with
a Friday matchup against a Saint
Mary's squad that Stanford defeat
ed 13-9 last February. This meeting

proved much the same as the last, as
the Cardinal scored the first seven
goals and cruised to a 14-5 victory.
Junior attacker Sarah Bach's five
goals led all scorers, helped the Bal
timore native garner MPSF Player
of the Week honors and tied for the
second-highest output in Cardinal
history.
Freshman attacker Daphne Pat
terson added three scores and se
nior midfielder Kelsey Twist
chipped in two.
"I just got really good passes
from Sarah Bach and Kelsey Twist
in a scoring position," said Patter
son. who has netted five goals in
three games. "It was really exciting
and so much fun to finally play after
practicing for so long. This team has
so much energy."
Two days later. Stanford trav
eled to play UC-Davis, another
team Stanford crushed early last
season by a 15-4 margin. On Sun
day. Stanford scored the first nine
goals and won 11-4. With two goals
apiece. Twist. Bach and junior mid-
Card to face
East teams

fielder Nyerr Parham paccd eight
Cardinal who found the hack of the
net.
"I don't play a lot of attack, hut my
coach had me playing attack all
game," Parham said. "(letting more
experienced in a game playing attack
helped me a lot and gave me more
confidence that I can handle the
ball."
Twist finished with live assists,
which set a new Stanford single-game
record and propelled her to honor
able mention MPSI Player of the
Week.
"I thought Kelsey's five assists
were really huge and really indicative
of how she sees the field and moves
the ball," Parham said. "She assisted
my lirst goal— I was wide open for
the shot. She's an unselfish person
and her vision and her delivery are re
ally great."
I reshman I aura Shane played
113 of 120 possible minutes against
the in-state opponents, allowing
seven goals while making 12 saves.
The Cardinal outshot Saint Mary's
and I)( I )avis a combined SX-34 and
won the first halves 17-1.
Behind these dominant statistical
performances is an incredibly tight
knit team, "as sophomore midfielder
Elizabeth Piselli attests.
"Our team's great," Piselli said.
"We're really a family. I wouldn't call
it a team we're sisters. C iood times
or bad, they're very honest, but not
harsh and looking to hurt your feel
ings. Sometimes they're even too
nice, they're there to comfort you
but they'll tell you what's wrong. It's
a very nice balance. There's no one 1
love more than the girls of my team. I
know it sounds corny but it's true."
Stanford's team unity will soon be
put to the test, as the Cardinal now
liead into the meat of its schedule.
Stanford will face six highly regarded
I• ast-( oast teams in a row. A March
4 visit from ('onnecticut and a March
6 visit from Georgetown, a 2(KM na
tional semifinalist, kick off this six
game stretch.
"1 think the challenge of playing
these teams is the same challenge we
have with every team," Parham said.
"We don't look at the name of the
team we play. We just try to play our
game. As long as we do the little
things right, we can beat any team in
the nation."

"1 think the challenge of playing
these teams is the same challenge we
have with every team," Parham said.
"We don't look at the name of the

The women's lacrosse team will face a tough stretch with games against top East Coast schools.
Heading into last weekend's
matchups against Saint Mary's and
UC-Davis. Stanford women's
lacrosse head coach Michelle
Uhlfelder identified many areas in
which her young squad could im
prove.
"We need to get the ball up the
field without so many turnovers,"
Uhlfelder said. "We need to work
on the fundamentals of groundballs
and improve our percentage on 50 /
50 balls. We need to work on con
tinuing to stop the ball in our defen
sive end, work on our positioning
and work on our defensive rota
tion."
The Cardinal's performance this
past weekend soothed many of
Uhlfelder's concerns, as Stanford
(3-0, 3-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) handily disposed of
MPSF foes UC-Davis and Saint
Mary's by a combined score of 25-9.
Stanford's weekend started with
a Friday matchup against a Saint
Mary's squad that Stanford defeat
ed 13-9 last February. This meeting

proved much the same as the last, as
the Cardinal scored the first seven
goals and cruised to a 14-5 victory.
Junior attacker Sarah Bach's five
goals led all scorers, helped the Bal
timore native garner MPSF Player
of the Week honors and tied for the
second-highest output in Cardinal
history.
Freshman attacker Daphne Pat
terson added three scores and se
nior midfielder Kelsey Twist
chipped in two.
"I just got really good passes
from Sarah Bach and Kelsey Twist
in a scoring position," said Patter
son. who has netted five goals in
three games. "It was really exciting
and so much fun to finally play after
practicing for so long. This team has
so much energy."
Two days later. Stanford trav
eled to play UC-Davis, another
team Stanford crushed early last
season by a 15-4 margin. On Sun
day. Stanford scored the first nine
goals and won 11-4. With two goals
apiece. Twist. Bach and junior mid-
Card to face
East teams

fielder Nyerr Parham paccd eight
Cardinal who found the hack of the
net.
"I don't play a lot of attack, hut my
coach had me playing attack all
game," Parham said. "(letting more
experienced in a game playing attack
helped me a lot and gave me more
confidence that I can handle the
ball."
Twist finished with live assists,
which set a new Stanford single-game
record and propelled her to honor
able mention MPSI Player of the
Week.
"I thought Kelsey's five assists
were really huge and really indicative
of how she sees the field and moves
the ball," Parham said. "She assisted
my lirst goal— I was wide open for
the shot. She's an unselfish person
and her vision and her delivery are re
ally great."
I reshman I aura Shane played
113 of 120 possible minutes against
the in-state opponents, allowing
seven goals while making 12 saves.
The Cardinal outshot Saint Mary's
and I)( I )avis a combined SX-34 and
won the first halves 17-1.
Behind these dominant statistical
performances is an incredibly tight
knit team, "as sophomore midfielder
Elizabeth Piselli attests.
"Our team's great," Piselli said.
"We're really a family. I wouldn't call
it a team we're sisters. C iood times
or bad, they're very honest, but not
harsh and looking to hurt your feel
ings. Sometimes they're even too
nice, they're there to comfort you
but they'll tell you what's wrong. It's
a very nice balance. There's no one 1
love more than the girls of my team. I
know it sounds corny but it's true."
