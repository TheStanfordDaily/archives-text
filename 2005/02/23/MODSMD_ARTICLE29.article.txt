## Smith powers Cardinal sweep at Tampa 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Being asked to name your favorite home
run from a weekend during which you hit
four is a hard question. Just ask Michelle
Smith. With some hesitation, the freshman
picked homer No. 1 on Saturday, a solo shot
in the top of the first against Hofstra. It got
the ball rolling for everyone else on the
team, she said, en route to a 6-0 victory.
Her most impressive, though, is a little
easier to pinpoint.

"The one to right field [on Sunday] be
cause it was a low-and-away pitch." Smith
said. "It's the pitch I work on the most be
cause it's the hardest to hit."
After earning Pacific-10 Conference
Player of the Week honors in her second
week of collegiate play. Smith put together
another solid weekend that makes her a
leading candidate for the same honor this
week. In just the third tournament of her
Stanford career. Smith led No. 4 Stanford
(11-1) with the long ball.
Smith, who entered the weekend at

.438, just kept adding to a season stacked
with personal highlights with a two
homer day against host South Florida (8-
7) Sunday evening. Going 3-for-4 with
two RBI and one run. Smith's work gave
the Cardinal some assurance in the 6-4
win. Smith, who swings from the right
side, hit an opposite field solo shot in the
fourth and followed with a solo shot to
left in the seventh.
Buoyed by Smith's explosive weekend
at the plate, the Cardinal swept through
Tampa, Fla., winning all five of their games

in the USF / Wilson Invite. Stanford, which
has been the only top-10 team in each of its
tournaments and has been able to get sig
nificant playing time for all its players, won
its third invite.
"We've been facing some great competi
tion," Smith said, having previously point
ed out that the other teams' successes didn't
make them rollovers. "But |head coach
John Rittman] definitely wanted to get nu
merous players in."
