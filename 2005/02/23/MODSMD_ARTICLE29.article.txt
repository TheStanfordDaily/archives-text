## Smith powers Cardinal sweep at Tampa 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Being asked to name your favorite home
run from a weekend during which you hit
four is a hard question. Just ask Michelle
Smith. With some hesitation, the freshman
picked homer No. 1 on Saturday, a solo shot
in the top of the first against Hofstra. It got
the ball rolling for everyone else on the
team, she said, en route to a 6-0 victory.
Her most impressive, though, is a little
easier to pinpoint.

"The one to right field [on Sunday] be
cause it was a low-and-away pitch." Smith
said. "It's the pitch I work on the most be
cause it's the hardest to hit."
After earning Pacific-10 Conference
Player of the Week honors in her second
week of collegiate play. Smith put together
another solid weekend that makes her a
leading candidate for the same honor this
week. In just the third tournament of her
Stanford career. Smith led No. 4 Stanford
(11-1) with the long ball.
Smith, who entered the weekend at

.438, just kept adding to a season stacked
with personal highlights with a two
homer day against host South Florida (8-
7) Sunday evening. Going 3-for-4 with
two RBI and one run. Smith's work gave
the Cardinal some assurance in the 6-4
win. Smith, who swings from the right
side, hit an opposite field solo shot in the
fourth and followed with a solo shot to
left in the seventh.
Buoyed by Smith's explosive weekend
at the plate, the Cardinal swept through
Tampa, Fla., winning all five of their games

in the USF / Wilson Invite. Stanford, which
has been the only top-10 team in each of its
tournaments and has been able to get sig
nificant playing time for all its players, won
its third invite.
"We've been facing some great competi
tion," Smith said, having previously point
ed out that the other teams' successes didn't
make them rollovers. "But |head coach
John Rittman] definitely wanted to get nu
merous players in."

Junior shortstop Lauren Lappin dives fora grounder. She went 1 -2 in the Cardinal's 8-0 win over Florida A&M on Monday in their fifth game in three days at the USF/Wilson Invite.
According to Smith, the team
which has an equal number of fresh
man and seniors - is reminded of
their deep level of talent by Rittman.
"Any opportunity he gets, he
wants to play everyone," she said.
Smith hit her fourth home run of
the season on Saturday. Freshman
Becky McCullough also contributed
to the Cardinal's power numbers
with a two-run homer against I lofs
tra (1-4). Junior Laura Severson set
the tone for the Cardinal pitching
staff with a one-hit shutout over the
Pride. In seven innings of work, the
right hander tallied a career-high
nine strikeouts.
McCullough held Jacksonville
(5-9) to one run in the day's second
lilt. The Dolphins took the early
lead in the tight game behind pitcher
Katie Dobson.
"They came out and they defi
nitely wanted to beat us," Smith
said. "They threw their best pitcher
at us. Ii look a while to get going but
we eventually got the runs we need
ed to win."
With junior centerfielder Catali
na Morris as the only other Cardinal
getting hits, Smith's bat made good
contact only once - but she made
sure it counted. With Morris and
sophomore Jackie Rinchart on base,
Smith singled down the left field line
to drive in Stanford's only runs in a
2-1 win.
In Sunday's 4-1 win over Seton
Hall (2-3), Smith's teammates
caught up with the freshman's per
formance. Lauren Lappin, Stan

lord's junior shortstop, blasted a
two-run home run to give the C Ordi
nal a 2-1 lead.
With Cardinal freshman I.auren
Nydam pitching in relief, Stanford
padded its lead when senior Meghan
Siekler started off her solid weekend
in the sixth with two-run pinch-hit
home run to left, her first of the sea
son.
"I hadn't had an at-bat in awhile,
so it got me back in the swing of
things," Siekler said. "It gave me the
confidence to go into the next game
and know I could hit the ball."
Siekler continued to have a good
day at the plate against IJSL. Hatting
after Nelson, the rightlielder
brought in her teammate in the sec
ond with a single and in the fourth
with a double.
With Stanford leading 4-3 in the
fourth, Tricia Aggaboa extended
Stanford's lead with her second hit
of the game to drive in Nelson. Sev
erson pitched for her sixth win of the
season and Nydam notched her sec
ond save.
"USl' is a good team," said
Smith, who had a multi-hit game. "A
lot of the girls talked about getting
beat by them last year. It was defi
nitely a team win on that one."
Nydam then put the exclamation
point on Stanford's Invite win
against Horida A&M (9-9) before
coming home Monday, as the squad
shutout the Rattlers 8-0.
Nydam picked lip plenty of ac
tion to improve to 3-0 while the
Cardinal's offense had a small clin
ic t>f their own: in five innings 10 dif
ferent players combined for Stan
ford's 10 hits. Morris and Smith led
the Cardinal with two RBI but it
was Smith who let one fly for her
seventh homerun of the season.

With junior centerfielder Catali
na Morris as the only other Cardinal
getting hits, Smith's bat made good
contact only once - but she made
sure it counted. With Morris and
sophomore Jackie Rinchart on base,
Smith singled down the left field line
to drive in Stanford's only runs in a
2-1 win.
In Sunday's 4-1 win over Seton
Hall (2-3), Smith's teammates
caught up with the freshman's per
formance. Lauren Lappin, Stan

lord's junior shortstop, blasted a
two-run home run to give the C Ordi
nal a 2-1 lead.
With Cardinal freshman I.auren
Nydam pitching in relief, Stanford
padded its lead when senior Meghan
Siekler started off her solid weekend
in the sixth with two-run pinch-hit
home run to left, her first of the sea
son.
"I hadn't had an at-bat in awhile,
so it got me back in the swing of
things," Siekler said. "It gave me the
confidence to go into the next game
and know I could hit the ball."
Siekler continued to have a good
day at the plate against IJSL. Hatting
after Nelson, the rightlielder
brought in her teammate in the sec
ond with a single and in the fourth
with a double.
With Stanford leading 4-3 in the
fourth, Tricia Aggaboa extended
Stanford's lead with her second hit
of the game to drive in Nelson. Sev
erson pitched for her sixth win of the
season and Nydam notched her sec
ond save.
"USl' is a good team," said
Smith, who had a multi-hit game. "A
lot of the girls talked about getting
beat by them last year. It was defi
nitely a team win on that one."
Nydam then put the exclamation
point on Stanford's Invite win
against Horida A&M (9-9) before
coming home Monday, as the squad
shutout the Rattlers 8-0.
Nydam picked lip plenty of ac
tion to improve to 3-0 while the
Cardinal's offense had a small clin
ic t>f their own: in five innings 10 dif
ferent players combined for Stan
ford's 10 hits. Morris and Smith led
the Cardinal with two RBI but it
was Smith who let one fly for her
seventh homerun of the season.
Being asked to name your favorite home
run from a weekend during which you hit
four is a hard question. Just ask Michelle
Smith. With some hesitation, the freshman
picked homer No. 1 on Saturday, a solo shot
in the top of the first against Hofstra. It got
the ball rolling for everyone else on the
team, she said, en route to a 6-0 victory.
Her most impressive, though, is a little
easier to pinpoint.

"The one to right field [on Sunday] be
cause it was a low-and-away pitch." Smith
said. "It's the pitch I work on the most be
cause it's the hardest to hit."
After earning Pacific-10 Conference
Player of the Week honors in her second
week of collegiate play. Smith put together
another solid weekend that makes her a
leading candidate for the same honor this
week. In just the third tournament of her
Stanford career. Smith led No. 4 Stanford
(11-1) with the long ball.
Smith, who entered the weekend at

.438, just kept adding to a season stacked
with personal highlights with a two
homer day against host South Florida (8-
7) Sunday evening. Going 3-for-4 with
two RBI and one run. Smith's work gave
the Cardinal some assurance in the 6-4
win. Smith, who swings from the right
side, hit an opposite field solo shot in the
fourth and followed with a solo shot to
left in the seventh.
Buoyed by Smith's explosive weekend
at the plate, the Cardinal swept through
Tampa, Fla., winning all five of their games

in the USF / Wilson Invite. Stanford, which
has been the only top-10 team in each of its
tournaments and has been able to get sig
nificant playing time for all its players, won
its third invite.
"We've been facing some great competi
tion," Smith said, having previously point
ed out that the other teams' successes didn't
make them rollovers. "But |head coach
John Rittman] definitely wanted to get nu
merous players in."

Junior shortstop Lauren Lappin dives fora grounder. She went 1 -2 in the Cardinal's 8-0 win over Florida A&M on Monday in their fifth game in three days at the USF/Wilson Invite.
According to Smith, the team
which has an equal number of fresh
man and seniors - is reminded of
their deep level of talent by Rittman.
"Any opportunity he gets, he
wants to play everyone," she said.
Smith hit her fourth home run of
the season on Saturday. Freshman
Becky McCullough also contributed
to the Cardinal's power numbers
with a two-run homer against I lofs
tra (1-4). Junior Laura Severson set
the tone for the Cardinal pitching
staff with a one-hit shutout over the
Pride. In seven innings of work, the
right hander tallied a career-high
nine strikeouts.
McCullough held Jacksonville
(5-9) to one run in the day's second
lilt. The Dolphins took the early
lead in the tight game behind pitcher
Katie Dobson.
"They came out and they defi

said. "They threw their best pitcher
at us. Ii look a while to get going but
