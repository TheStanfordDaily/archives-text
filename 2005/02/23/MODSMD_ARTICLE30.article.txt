### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITER 
Despite pushing the No. 1 UCLA men's
volleyball team to four games last Thursday,
the No. 9 Cardinal returned home without
having pulled off the upset they had hoped
for.
However, the road trip was bittersweet, as
Stanford went on to sweep No. 10 UC-lrvine
on Saturday. The Cardinal are now 5-8 (4-6
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) and
hoping to improve on that record as they face
UC-San Diego this Thursday at Burnham
Pavilion.
Heading into the match against the Bru
ins (14-1,10-1 MPSF) on Thursday, the Car
dinal knew they were in fora challenge.
In the first two games of the match, it ap
peared as though they weren't up for it. De
spite an early 6-1 lead in the first game, huge
scoring runs for UCLA left Stanford too far
behind to recover. The Cardinal lost the first
game 21 -30 and the second 20-30, posting hit
ting percentages of .088 and -.059, respective
ly-
"We came out of the box really fast, but
from that point on, for the next game and a
half or so, [UCLA] played steadily with no
mistakes," head coach Don Shaw said. "We
did not play very well in games one and two,
with the exception of that beginning of the
first game."
Game three was a different story. Refus
ing to let the Bruins walk away with an easy

victory, Stanford fought to a 25-21 lead.
UCLA rallied with a scoring streak that tied
the game at 26-26. The Bruins then had two
game points, but the Cardinal held them off
at 31-31 and scored two straight points to win
33-31.
"We kind of rallied and decided to play
like we had nothing to lose." Shaw said. "We
were looser and more relaxed, and that
helped us win game three. We played the
same way in game four, hut a couple of points
here and there made the difference."
Stanford stayed with UCLA early in the
fourth game of the match. But at 12-12, the
Cardinal committed a series of hitting errors
that gave the Bruins a four-point lead. That
gap never shrunk to more than three points as
UCLA went on to close out the match with a
30-26 victory.
'"We made too many unforced errors and
didn't serve strong enough to eliminate their
middle attack," Shaw said. "They passed the
hall well, so they were able to set up their mid
dle hitters, and their middle hitters are bigger.
We didn't match up with them very well. We
just needed to keep fighting for points. Our
problem has been transition hitting. We're
digging balls, but we couldn't get good swings
and couldn't convert points."
Despite the defeat, a number of Cardinal
players put in noteworthy performances. Se
nior Kevin Hansen had 51 assists, including
several to senior David Vogel, who led the

Senior David Vogel's 17 kills helped the men's volleyball team to win a game off of UCLA, but
the Cardinal would go on to lost the match, 3-1. They bounced back with a win at Irvine.

team with 17 kills. Senior Craig Huell
was close behind with 1(1 kills, followed
by redshirt junior William (layton and
junior lien Reddy, who tallied nine kills
apiece.
By the time the ( ardinal hit the court
at I)( -Irvine (6-10, 4-7 MPSF), they
were ready fora victory.
"We knew we needed to play well
and win in order to have a good chance
of making the playoffs," Shaw said.
"Irvine is one of the teams we'll lie com
peting with for those last playoff spots, so
it was a much bigger match for us. I lie
match against IJC I A was kind of a
wash; no one is doing very well against

them lately."
In a complete reversal of their lirst
two games against IJ( I A, the ( ardinal
won the lirst two against IK'-Irvine 3(*-
21 and 30-21, respectively.
"We were behind in both of the lirst
two games, then managed to take con
trol," Shaw said. "Hen | Reddy | got hi >t at
the end ol the lirst game and served real
ly lough, similar to the Pacific game. In
game two, we managed to make anoth
er push, and | Irvine) made some errors,
and the combination of the two things
helped us win game two."
Ihe Anteaters responded by push
ing Stanford into extra points in game

three, but the Cardinal shut out the
match with a 31-29 win.
"We ran our offense really efficient
ly, passed the ball well, made good de
fensive plays and converted those points
well," Shaw said. "< Hir middles played
very well in the Irvine match."
Junior ( liris Ahlfcldt hit an impres
sive .769 in the match, with 10 kills and
no errors in 13 attempts. Buell and
Vogel also posted strong hitting percent
ages 0f.619 and .667, respectively.
"Vogel had a good game offensively,
which we really needed," Shaw said.
"We need him to kind of break out and
have more success offensively. But in

order for us to lie successful, we need to
have a good team effort. Any lime we
win, it's because we've had a good team
effort from all the guys."
1 Tie Cardinal will face winless IJC-
San 1 )iego (0-12, (M I M1*S1 ; ) at home
this Thursday.
"We don't expect anything to come
easily," Shaw said. "|l K 'SI )| didn't play
particularly well when we played them
earlier this season and I'm expecting
them to be much tougher on Thursday.
It'll Ix; a competitive match."
Stanford will play No. 4 I ong Beach
State (9-5,74 MPSI) on Saturday in the
( ardinal's last home match until April.
