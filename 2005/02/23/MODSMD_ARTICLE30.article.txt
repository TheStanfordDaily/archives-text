Despite pushing the No. 1 UCLA men's
volleyball team to four games last Thursday,
the No. 9 Cardinal returned home without
having pulled off the upset they had hoped
for.
However, the road trip was bittersweet, as
Stanford went on to sweep No. 10 UC-lrvine
on Saturday. The Cardinal are now 5-8 (4-6
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) and
hoping to improve on that record as they face
UC-San Diego this Thursday at Burnham
Pavilion.
Heading into the match against the Bru
ins (14-1,10-1 MPSF) on Thursday, the Car
dinal knew they were in fora challenge.
In the first two games of the match, it ap
peared as though they weren't up for it. De
spite an early 6-1 lead in the first game, huge
scoring runs for UCLA left Stanford too far
behind to recover. The Cardinal lost the first
game 21 -30 and the second 20-30, posting hit
ting percentages of .088 and -.059, respective

"We came out of the box really fast, but
from that point on, for the next game and a
half or so, [UCLA] played steadily with no
mistakes," head coach Don Shaw said. "We
did not play very well in games one and two,
with the exception of that beginning of the
first game."
Game three was a different story. Refus
ing to let the Bruins walk away with an easy

victory, Stanford fought to a 25-21 lead.
UCLA rallied with a scoring streak that tied
the game at 26-26. The Bruins then had two
game points, but the Cardinal held them off
at 31-31 and scored two straight points to win
33-31.
"We kind of rallied and decided to play
like we had nothing to lose." Shaw said. "We
were looser and more relaxed, and that
helped us win game three. We played the
same way in game four, hut a couple of points
here and there made the difference."
Stanford stayed with UCLA early in the
fourth game of the match. But at 12-12, the
Cardinal committed a series of hitting errors
that gave the Bruins a four-point lead. That
gap never shrunk to more than three points as
UCLA went on to close out the match with a
30-26 victory.
'"We made too many unforced errors and
didn't serve strong enough to eliminate their
middle attack," Shaw said. "They passed the
hall well, so they were able to set up their mid
dle hitters, and their middle hitters are bigger.
We didn't match up with them very well. We
just needed to keep fighting for points. Our
problem has been transition hitting. We're
digging balls, but we couldn't get good swings
and couldn't convert points."
Despite the defeat, a number of Cardinal
players put in noteworthy performances. Se

Senior David Vogel's 17 kills helped the men's volleyball team to win a game off of UCLA, but
