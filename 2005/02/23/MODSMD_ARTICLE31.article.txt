# Women's tennis picture-perfect
## Card begins league play with shutouts 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
With all six of its singles players
ranked in the top 30 nationwide, the
top-ranked Stanford women's tennis
team (8-0, 1-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) opened Pac-10 play this week
end with stunning talent afoot and
solid numbers to back it up.
Two back-to-back shutouts later,
with one league contest and another
practice match completed at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium, the unde
feated Cardinal have made a glowing
start to their quest for another pic
ture-perfect season.
Taking an aggressive stance at
every net and baseline, Stanford held
nothing back as it tamed a sluggish
No. 75 Washington State (3-6, 0-1
Pac-10), 7-0, on Friday. Yesterday, a
higher-caliber No. 21 Fresno State
team (1 -2), was also shut out.
Half an hour into the match, the
Bulldogs' No. 1 and No. 2 doubles
pairs were only trailing by small mar
gins and looked to pull ahead. In the
top doubles slot, the No. 49 duo of
Courtney Jantz and Lucia Santz (8-

5) broke Stanford's serve to close in
2-3.
"1 felt like they came on pretty ag
gressive and they were definitely
crossing on us a couple of times," said
Erin Burdette, a senior. "That made
us have to focus more on our returns
and think a little bit more out there."
One court over, junior Amber Liu
and sophomore Anne Yelsey traded
heavy topspin lobs with Lucia Tallo
and Katharina Winterhalter (1-3).
Stanford posted an 8-5 win only after
some serious baseline backpedaling
for points.
The No. 10 duo of Burdette and
Alice Barnes (18-2) also closed out
their match. 8-5, but Burdette ex
pressed concern over the close score.
"We lost a couple of points when
Alice was serving at 7-3 and it would
have been really nice to close out the
match then," Burdette said. "It was
also a little bit frustrating to get a line
call against us in the next game."
Down 7-4 and with her serve al
ready broken at 3-4, Jantz relied on
shaky second serves to keep Fresno
