With a grant from the California Department
of Alcoholic Beverage Control, Palo Alto Police
officers are working overtime to bust local bars,
restaurants and stores that sell alcohol to minors.
On Saturday, a server at Nola restaurant on
Ramona Street was arrested and released with a
misdemeanor citation for serving to a N-year-old
"decoy" working with an undercover officer. The

after the third offense. He said he hadn't heard of
Nola receiving any prior citations.
When asked about the violation yesterday, a
representative from Nola said he didn't have time
to talk about it, and he hung up.

Also on Saturday, an undercover officer cited a
clerk at the Open House Market, located on El
Camino between Cambridge Street and College
Avenue, for selling alcohol to a 19-year-old decoy.
Police visited 10 other establishments Saturday

"We're right at about a 20 percent arrest rate
right now, roughly," he said.
