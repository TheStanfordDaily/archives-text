# Palo Alto police bust underage drink sellers
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With a grant from the California Department
of Alcoholic Beverage Control, Palo Alto Police
officers are working overtime to bust local bars,
restaurants and stores that sell alcohol to minors.
On Saturday, a server at Nola restaurant on
Ramona Street was arrested and released with a
misdemeanor citation for serving to a N-year-old
"decoy" working with an undercover officer. The
New Orleans-themed bar, a weekend hotspot for
Stanford students, will be reported to the Depart

ment of Alcoholic Beverage Control, or ABC,
which will review the restaurant's liquor license.
" The ABC takes this very seriously," said Palo
Alto Police Lt. Ron Lawrence. "It's a serious
black mark against their liquor license."
Lawrence said establishments are typically
fined the first two times they are found violating
liquor laws and may have their license revoked
after the third offense. He said he hadn't heard of
Nola receiving any prior citations.
When asked about the violation yesterday, a
representative from Nola said he didn't have time
to talk about it, and he hung up.

Also on Saturday, an undercover officer cited a
clerk at the Open House Market, located on El
Camino between Cambridge Street and College
Avenue, for selling alcohol to a 19-year-old decoy.
Police visited 10 other establishments Saturday
that refused to serve alcohol to decoys. Lawrence
said Saturday's results were fairly typical.
"We're right at about a 20 percent arrest rate
right now, roughly," he said.
The Palo Alto Police Department's decoy op
erations are part of an 18-month program that
began in October 2004 with an
$18,778 grant from the ABC, which
is funding similar efforts by police
agencies around the state. The ar
rest rate in Palo Alto is similar to the
statewide 23 percent arrest rate for
the program so far.
Lawrence said the agencies that
received grants were those per
ceived to have the greatest need.
"Since we're a college town, we
tend to get a little higher number of
underage drinkers," he said. "It's
not that we're specifically targeting
underage drinking because of a sud
den rise in the trend — I think the
trend has been consistent, it's just
that now we have the resources."
