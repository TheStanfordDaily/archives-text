# Security clearances eased for int'l students
## 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ STAFF WRITER 
After enduring visa clearance de
lays due to stricter post-Sept. 11 regu
lations, Stanford's international stu
dents will now benefit from a new
streamlined process that shortens the
waiting period before visa approval
and extends the period students can
remain in the United States, according
to a statement made earlier this month
by the U.S. Department of State.
The new policy will allow interna
tional students to remain in the U.S.
until graduation, exempting many stu
dents from another Visa Mantis secu
rity clearance — during which inter
national students involved in sensitive
technology fields must undergo in
tense scrutiny before their visas can be
renewed — even if their current visa
has expired.
Such routine clearances have
caused delays of up to three months,
forcing some international students to
defer their enrollment.
"I was supposed to arrive at Stan
ford in fall 2002 as a freshman," said ju
nior Hau Jia Chew, an international
student from Malaysia. "My visa ap
plication was delayed fora few
months, which caused me to miss the
fall enrollment deadline and have to
defer for one quarter."
Under the former system, pre-ap
proved international students who
misplaced immigration documents
were not allowed back into the United
States.
"Cases where students just lose
their immigration papers and are re
jected entry into the United States
shows how ridiculously strict home
land security's former policies were,"
said sophomore Wesley Lim, an inter
national student from Singapore. "I
know of someone who was refused to
be let in as a student even after he had
passed the necessary screenings — he
simply lost his 1-20 papers and needed
replacements." The 1-20 is a form is
sued by an academic institution to
nonimmigrant students.
To confront these glitches, the De
partment of Homeland Security re
cently automated the visa clearance

process, decreasing the likelihood of
mix-ups and unnecessary clearances
for pre-approved students.
The waiting period for visa autho
rization has also been decreased from
an average of 67 days to two weeks, ac
cording to a study conducted by the
Government Accountability Office.
Also, the study showed that these
changes resulted from improvements
made in inter-agency coordination ef
forts. technology and the designation
of students as high-priority applicants
for visa clearance.
New regulations may decrease the
obstacles to international student en
rollment in American schools. Last
year, the number of foreign applicants
to U.S. colleges declined by 32 percent,
according to a study conducted by the
Institute of International Education.
In addition, the San Jose Mercury
News on Feb. 15 said that Stanford
graduate-student enrollment had also
been impacted, decreasing from 9,870
in 2003 to 9,020 in 2004.
Sophomore Wenkai Tay, a mem
ber of The Daily's editorial board,
agreed that stricter policies are hurting
enrollment numbers at Stanford.
"It is true that the U.S.. and in par
ticular Stanford, is losing highly quali
fied applicants to other countries be
cause of its immigration policies," he
said. Tay is an international student
from Singapore.
But John Pearson, director of Bech
tel International Center, said that it is
unfair to attribute the decline in inter
national student enrollment to strict
policies, and that it is unlikely that new
clearance procedures will lead to a di
rect increase in foreign applicants.
"It is very difficult to explain a de
cline in applications to one factor," he
said. "Other possible factors include
increased opportunities for students in
China and India to remain in their own
country after undergraduate work, or
the 'recruiting' of international stu
dents by other countries like the Unit
ed Kingdom and Australia in the past
few years."
Lim said that the State Depart
ment's new policy would still compli-
cate the lives of some international
students.
"My friend at Dartmouth is con
cerned with the new policies mainly
because they won't allow Dart
mouth's international students to en
roll in required sophomore summer
school," he said. "In order to take
summer off, they now have to enroll in
fall, winter and spring of the previous
and following year, which messes up
international students' schedules."
Other students, such as senior
Pablo Schyfter, an international stu
dent from Costa Rica, said they are in
favor of the State Departments re
cently announced policies and believe
that they are long overdue.
"The restrictions in place before
were too stringent and accomplished
nothing but embarrassment for inter
national visitors and students,"
Schyfter said. "Without these more
recently lenient policies, the State De
partment's stance begs the question:
Why would a student come to a coun
try which constantly forced them to be
aware of their position as a foreigner
under vigilance?"

"It is true that the U.S.. and in par
ticular Stanford, is losing highly quali
fied applicants to other countries be
cause of its immigration policies," he
said. Tay is an international student
from Singapore.
But John Pearson, director of Bech
tel International Center, said that it is
unfair to attribute the decline in inter
national student enrollment to strict
policies, and that it is unlikely that new
clearance procedures will lead to a di
rect increase in foreign applicants.
"It is very difficult to explain a de
cline in applications to one factor," he
said. "Other possible factors include
increased opportunities for students in
China and India to remain in their own
country after undergraduate work, or
the 'recruiting' of international stu
dents by other countries like the Unit
ed Kingdom and Australia in the past
few years."
Lim said that the State Depart
ment's new policy would still compli-
cate the lives of some international
students.
"My friend at Dartmouth is con
cerned with the new policies mainly
because they won't allow Dart
mouth's international students to en
roll in required sophomore summer
school," he said. "In order to take
summer off, they now have to enroll in
fall, winter and spring of the previous
and following year, which messes up
international students' schedules."
Other students, such as senior
Pablo Schyfter, an international stu
dent from Costa Rica, said they are in
favor of the State Departments re
cently announced policies and believe
that they are long overdue.
"The restrictions in place before
were too stringent and accomplished
nothing but embarrassment for inter
national visitors and students,"
Schyfter said. "Without these more
recently lenient policies, the State De
partment's stance begs the question:
Why would a student come to a coun
try which constantly forced them to be
aware of their position as a foreigner
under vigilance?"
After enduring visa clearance de
lays due to stricter post-Sept. 11 regu
lations, Stanford's international stu
dents will now benefit from a new
streamlined process that shortens the
waiting period before visa approval
and extends the period students can
remain in the United States, according
to a statement made earlier this month
by the U.S. Department of State.
The new policy will allow interna
tional students to remain in the U.S.
until graduation, exempting many stu
dents from another Visa Mantis secu
rity clearance — during which inter
national students involved in sensitive
technology fields must undergo in
tense scrutiny before their visas can be
renewed — even if their current visa
has expired.
Such routine clearances have
caused delays of up to three months,
forcing some international students to
defer their enrollment.
"I was supposed to arrive at Stan
ford in fall 2002 as a freshman," said ju
nior Hau Jia Chew, an international
student from Malaysia. "My visa ap
plication was delayed fora few
months, which caused me to miss the
fall enrollment deadline and have to
defer for one quarter."
Under the former system, pre-ap
proved international students who
misplaced immigration documents
were not allowed back into the United
States.
"Cases where students just lose
their immigration papers and are re
jected entry into the United States
shows how ridiculously strict home
land security's former policies were,"
said sophomore Wesley Lim, an inter
national student from Singapore. "I
know of someone who was refused to
be let in as a student even after he had
passed the necessary screenings — he
simply lost his 1-20 papers and needed
replacements." The 1-20 is a form is
sued by an academic institution to
nonimmigrant students.
To confront these glitches, the De
partment of Homeland Security re
cently automated the visa clearance

process, decreasing the likelihood of
mix-ups and unnecessary clearances
for pre-approved students.
The waiting period for visa autho
rization has also been decreased from
an average of 67 days to two weeks, ac
cording to a study conducted by the
Government Accountability Office.
Also, the study showed that these
changes resulted from improvements
made in inter-agency coordination ef
forts. technology and the designation
of students as high-priority applicants
for visa clearance.
New regulations may decrease the
obstacles to international student en
rollment in American schools. Last
year, the number of foreign applicants
to U.S. colleges declined by 32 percent,
according to a study conducted by the
Institute of International Education.
In addition, the San Jose Mercury
News on Feb. 15 said that Stanford
graduate-student enrollment had also
been impacted, decreasing from 9,870
in 2003 to 9,020 in 2004.
