# Anchor dissects American English

### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
Veteran journalist and former co-anchor of the Public
Broadcasting Company's MacNeil / Lehrer Newshour,
Robert MacNeil discussed his new documentary, "Do
You Speak American?" and the accompanying book of
the same title last night at Kresge Auditorium.
In both works, MacNeil explores the diversity and on
going linguistic transformation of American English.
The documentary follows MacNeil on a cross-country
journey from Nova Scotia, Canada, to Seattle, Wash, as he
pursues what he called a "living narrative" of American
English. The purpose of the film, he said, is to examine the
form of American English in light of the language's grow
ing importance. Today, American speakers influence the
language as much as British speakers did in the past, he said.
Each clip of the documentary addressed a particular
linguistic aspect, which MacNeil explained in commentary
following the screening.
MacNeil related the growing informality of the English
language to the broadcasting phenomenon, acknowledg
ing that it has contributed to the increasing conversation
al tone of even political rhetoric.
"Broadcasting in many ways led to the democratiza-

tion of English," he said. "It can give the impression that
we're drowning in a new wave of nonstandard and un
gramniatical English."
Jeff Foxworthy, a Southern comedian featured in the
documentary, said in the film that he sometimes bases his
standup routine on the prejudices against the often non
standard, ungrammatical Southern dialect.
MacNeil, however, said that according to recent census
data, the Southern dialect is the fastest growing English
dialect in the nation.
"Northern contempt for the Southern dialect grew into
something more friendly," MacNeil said. "We've become
accustomed to hearing Southern accents in the govern
ment. with four recent presidents from the South. We
have a president who, when he chooses to, 'talks country'
like many Americans do."
He pointed to the contrast between the language used
by President George W. Bush and the more complicated
phrasing used by Sen. John Kerry, a New Englander and
2(H)4 presidential candidate.
"[ Bush's) mode of communication seems to be in tune
with an important part of the American spirit," MacNeil
said.

Robert MacNeil, former anchor of PBS' "MacNeil / Lehrer Newshour," talks with discussion moderator Gordon
Earle about his new documentary on American English, "Do You Speak American?"
The influence of Latino and
African-American minority communi
ties on American I nglish also featured
prominently in the documentary. In
I ajs Angeles, the (Tiicano street dialect
shows that the Spanish of I .atino immi
grants is not a threat to the I {nglish lan
guage any more so than German or
Italian were in the past, MacNeil said.

"("ensusdata shows that young I lis
panics arc becoming Anglophones by
the sccoiul or third generation," Mac-
Neil said. " Ihe fear of Spanish influ
ence on the English language is often
expressed as the justification for mak
ing Inglish the official language of the
I Inited States."
lie added that linguistics experts
fear that making I nglish official would
be grounds for discrimination.
Linguistic profiling already exists,
Mitcncil said, targeting African-Ameri
can and I atino aoccnts. I he other seg
ment of the documentary set in I os An

geles portrays the I x>s Angeles Unified
School I )istrict's attempt to teach "main
stream American I English" to elementary
schwl children in a program allied the
Academic 1 .nglish Mastery lYogram.
MacNeil said that the segment re
minded him of the national furor over
I bonics in the mid-19905.
"I found a certain amount of latent
racism in the coverage of that debate,"
he said. "Both white and black journal
ists would call I'bonics 'gibberish." Its
not it's intelligible, which means
that it's a dialect by itself."
Freshman I aura Holmes, who at

tended the event as part of her Program
in Writing and Rhetoric class, " llie
Rhetoric of I iteracy," said that she dis
covered some of her own misconcep
tions about various types of 1 'nglish.
"I thought the discussion was really
interesting," she said. "Growing up in
the l ast Bay, a farming community
with a mix of Caucasians and I lispanic
migrant workers, I didn't know that
C 'hicano I nglish was different from
African-American 1 nglish. It gave me
a new perspective."
(Communications Prof. (Tiff Nass,
who appears in the film, said that mis

matched voices create distrust in listeners.
1 or example, people trust those who
have voices that match those "appropri
ate" to their age, gender or race. I low
ever, 1 education and linguistics Prof.
John Baugh said that as an African
American, he was taught that the man
ner he spoke in dictated how the outside
community would perceive him.
"11 I'm perceived as more trustwor
thy when I'm speaking the vernacular
from my old neighborhood, why the hell
did I work so hard to learn mainstream
American Knglish?" Baugh said.
At the end of the event, moderator

Gordon larle, University manager in
the public affairs administration, asked
MaeNeil if he, in fact, "spoke Ameri
can." MacNeil responded that anyone
who lives in America and uses the I En
glish language speaks American.
"One reason for the slightly face
tious title is that all of us speak Ameri
can," MacNeil said. "As [comedian]
Steve 1 larvey said in the documentary,
there's so much diversity in America,
and there's so many ways to speak it."
l he event marked MaeNeil's 13th
stop in his 15-city book tour that will
end in the Bay Area.
