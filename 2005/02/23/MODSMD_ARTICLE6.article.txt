### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
Veteran journalist and former co-anchor of the Public
Broadcasting Company's MacNeil / Lehrer Newshour,
Robert MacNeil discussed his new documentary, "Do
You Speak American?" and the accompanying book of
the same title last night at Kresge Auditorium.
In both works, MacNeil explores the diversity and on
going linguistic transformation of American English.
The documentary follows MacNeil on a cross-country
journey from Nova Scotia, Canada, to Seattle, Wash, as he
pursues what he called a "living narrative" of American
English. The purpose of the film, he said, is to examine the
form of American English in light of the language's grow
ing importance. Today, American speakers influence the
language as much as British speakers did in the past, he said.
Each clip of the documentary addressed a particular
linguistic aspect, which MacNeil explained in commentary
following the screening.
MacNeil related the growing informality of the English
language to the broadcasting phenomenon, acknowledg
ing that it has contributed to the increasing conversation
al tone of even political rhetoric.
"Broadcasting in many ways led to the democratiza-

tion of English," he said. "It can give the impression that
we're drowning in a new wave of nonstandard and un
gramniatical English."
Jeff Foxworthy, a Southern comedian featured in the
documentary, said in the film that he sometimes bases his
standup routine on the prejudices against the often non
standard, ungrammatical Southern dialect.
MacNeil, however, said that according to recent census
data, the Southern dialect is the fastest growing English
dialect in the nation.
"Northern contempt for the Southern dialect grew into
something more friendly," MacNeil said. "We've become
accustomed to hearing Southern accents in the govern
ment. with four recent presidents from the South. We
have a president who, when he chooses to, 'talks country'
like many Americans do."
He pointed to the contrast between the language used
by President George W. Bush and the more complicated
phrasing used by Sen. John Kerry, a New Englander and
2(H)4 presidential candidate.
"[ Bush's) mode of communication seems to be in tune
with an important part of the American spirit," MacNeil
said.
