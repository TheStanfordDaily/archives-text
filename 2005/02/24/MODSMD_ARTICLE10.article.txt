# Fewer students apply to study overseas

### SARAH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
An estimated 550 students go abroad each year
through Stanford's Overseas Studies Program, or OSP,
and while applications this quarter have slightly de
creased, students are applying to a wider range of coun
tries this year than in the past.
"Last year we had 325 applications, while this year
we had 301," said Shannon Marimon, OSP outreach
and student relations manager. "Though this is slightly
fewer, we have a much more even distribution of inter
est across our locations than last vear."

Berlin was one of Ihe campuses that gained popular
ity; the number of applications increasing by three fold.
Marimon attributed this change in part to a paid intern
ship guarantee to students in the program and increased
outreach efforts about the Berlin program.
"All in all, I believe that this increase in applications
may be partly attributed to the 'secret' getting out
about the richness of Berlin as a city and the incredible
opportunities available as a whole," she said.
Another trendy destination is Paris, where students at
tend classes exclusively in French and go on field trips in
order to get a more comprehensive sense of the culture.
"It seems like the OSP-Paris program really values

and encourages cultural immersion in a way that other
centers don't and that's important to me," said junior
Pallen Chiu, who will spend the spring in Paris. "I know
of several students from the program who made
Parisian friends while there or who are still in touch
with their host families or language partners."
The number of applicants for most other locations
decreased, most markedly for the Oxford campus.
However, there were still too many applicants for the
47 spots in the Oxford program. The number of appli
cations fell from 115 to 81.
