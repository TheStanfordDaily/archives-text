# Fewer students apply to study overseas
## 
### SARAH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
An estimated 550 students go abroad each year
through Stanford's Overseas Studies Program, or OSP,
and while applications this quarter have slightly de
creased, students are applying to a wider range of coun
tries this year than in the past.
"Last year we had 325 applications, while this year
we had 301," said Shannon Marimon, OSP outreach
and student relations manager. "Though this is slightly
fewer, we have a much more even distribution of inter
est across our locations than last vear."

Berlin was one of Ihe campuses that gained popular
ity; the number of applications increasing by three fold.
Marimon attributed this change in part to a paid intern
ship guarantee to students in the program and increased
outreach efforts about the Berlin program.
"All in all, I believe that this increase in applications
may be partly attributed to the 'secret' getting out
about the richness of Berlin as a city and the incredible
opportunities available as a whole," she said.
Another trendy destination is Paris, where students at
tend classes exclusively in French and go on field trips in
order to get a more comprehensive sense of the culture.
"It seems like the OSP-Paris program really values

and encourages cultural immersion in a way that other
centers don't and that's important to me," said junior
Pallen Chiu, who will spend the spring in Paris. "I know
of several students from the program who made
Parisian friends while there or who are still in touch
with their host families or language partners."
The number of applicants for most other locations
decreased, most markedly for the Oxford campus.
However, there were still too many applicants for the
47 spots in the Oxford program. The number of appli
cations fell from 115 to 81.
Current abroad campuses are
Australia, Beijing, Berlin, Flo
rence, Kyoto, Moscow, Oxford,
Paris and Santiago. However,
OSP is constantly opening new
campuses and re-designing old
ones. Currently under considera
tion are campuses in India and
Spain.
OSP is also setting up a quar
ter-long program in South Africa
with a public health focus. It will
be offered next winter.
Additionally, the program at
Moscow has been newly remod
eled; because this was only re
cently announced, applications
are not due until this Sunday.
One of the newest campuses is
located in Beijing. The program
offers students the opportunity
to work with professors at
Peking University. There have
been few applicants thus far, but
this may be because of an exten
sive language requirement as
well as the relative newness of

the option, according to Beijing
Student Advisor Athena Mak, a
junior.
"I think the potential of the
program hasn't been reached yet
because word about the program
from the returning students
haven't been spread that widely
yet," she said. "Also, I think that
the original language require
ment of live quarters for spring
participants was a little daunting
lor many students."
Upgrades are also being
planned for the campus in Santi
ago, where students live with
host families and study the mod
ernization and culture of Chile.
The Santiago center, where stu
dents study, will be moved to a
more central location, which may
increase the number of students
interested in the program.
"The new center will be only
steps from the Tobalaba subway
station, the hub between mid
town and uptown," said Edmun
do Fuen/.alida, director of Stan
ford in Santiago. "We are pro
jecting an increase in the number
of Stanford faculty-in-residence
as well as in the number of natu
ral science courses."
