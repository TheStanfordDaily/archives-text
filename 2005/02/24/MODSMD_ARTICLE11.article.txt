# Students prepare for Mom and Dad
## Parents flock to campus for the weekend 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Late last night, freshman Kirby Bumpus finally turned
off the vacuum cleaner and began putting neatly folded
stacks of shirts, jeans and sweaters in her dresser.
"I've spent about three to four hours cleaning my
room already," Bumpus said with a sheepish smile but
without stopping. "It's still not done."
On the eve of parents' arrival, there were probably
many other students across campus in the same situation:
vacuuming, tidying, fixing and organizing their rooms to
be presentable.
Beginning today until Saturday, nearly 3,000 parents
are expected to set foot on the Farm for Parents' Week
end 2005. The annual event, sponsored by the Office of
the President and Provost and coordinated by University
Communications, is designed to let parents'of undergrad
uates see their children's natural habitat during the
school year.
Along with Reunion Homecoming, Commencement,
New Student Orientation and Admit Weekend, Parents'
Weekend is considered one of Stanford's "Big 5" events.
During the dozens of activities planned for today and
tomorrow, parents will be able to meet University Presi
dent John Hennessy and Provost John Etchemendy, so
cialize with other parents, tour the campus and attend lec
tures and classes taught by Stanford faculty.
Many parents will begin arriving this evening to settle
in and attend the Writing Center's annual "Celebration
of Writing" event in Margaret Jacks Hall. Both parents
and students will read their own original works and orig
inal music will be performed.
Assistant Director of the Writing Center Wendy
Goldberg expects three or four sets of parents and chil
dren to read their works tonight.
"The students speak in their own voices and you get a
real feel for their interests and concerns," Goldberg said.
"You get a real cross-section of students and interests."
Nearby hotels are prepared for the annual influx of
visitors. The Westin on El Camino, di
rectly adjacent to Palm Drive and the
Stanford campus, has been completely
hooked for tonight and possibly for to
morrow, according to a front desk clerk.
"Every year we see a big increase in
reservations over Parents' Weekend,"
Michele Lucien of Westin Ciuest Services
said. "The high times are probably gradu
ation. football season and then Parents'
Weekend,"
On Friday at 9:30 a.m., Etchemendy
will welcome the parents and deliver a
talk entitled "What Stanford Means by
Multidisciplinary."
The talk will be followed by three
"Conversations with Parents" sessions
planned for parents of freshmen, sopho
mores, juniors and seniors. On Friday af
ternoon, Hennessy will deliver an address

and field questions from the audience.
Despite the packed schedule of events
planned by the University, many parents
will likely opt to spend some time off cam
pus with their children. As the horde of
parents arrive, some students admitted
feeling slightly burdened, while others ea
gerly anticipate seeing their parents
again.
Bumpus, for one, is already sure what
she will do with her mom.
"She's very excited and I can't wait for
her to come," she said. "We'll do some
shopping, definitely."
To wrap things up on Saturday after
noon, four student groups will perform in
the "Entertainment Extravaganza" spon
sored by the Stanford Parents' Club. The
show will feature the Stanford Fleet
Street Singers, Cardinal Whirlwinds,
Stanford Improvisors and Stanford
Taiko. As a final farewell party, parents
are invited to The Parents' Club Recep
tion, co-hosted by the Stanford Alumni
Association at the Frances C. Arrillaga
Alumni Center.

"Every year we see a big increase in
reservations over Parents' Weekend,"
Michele Lucien of Westin Ciuest Services
said. "The high times are probably gradu
ation. football season and then Parents'
Weekend,"
On Friday at 9:30 a.m., Etchemendy
will welcome the parents and deliver a
talk entitled "What Stanford Means by
Multidisciplinary."
The talk will be followed by three
"Conversations with Parents" sessions
planned for parents of freshmen, sopho
mores, juniors and seniors. On Friday af
ternoon, Hennessy will deliver an address

and field questions from the audience.
Despite the packed schedule of events
planned by the University, many parents
will likely opt to spend some time off cam
pus with their children. As the horde of
parents arrive, some students admitted
feeling slightly burdened, while others ea
gerly anticipate seeing their parents
again.
Bumpus, for one, is already sure what
she will do with her mom.
"She's very excited and I can't wait for
her to come," she said. "We'll do some
shopping, definitely."
To wrap things up on Saturday after
noon, four student groups will perform in
the "Entertainment Extravaganza" spon
sored by the Stanford Parents' Club. The
show will feature the Stanford Fleet
Street Singers, Cardinal Whirlwinds,
Stanford Improvisors and Stanford
Taiko. As a final farewell party, parents
are invited to The Parents' Club Recep
tion, co-hosted by the Stanford Alumni
Association at the Frances C. Arrillaga
Alumni Center.

A parent checks in at Old Union at last year's Parents' Weekend registration. Over 3,000 parents are expected to attend this year. The Westin
on El Camino has been completely booked for tonight and possibly for tomorrow.
