## Parents flock to campus for the weekend

Late last night, freshman Kirby Bumpus finally turned
off the vacuum cleaner and began putting neatly folded
stacks of shirts, jeans and sweaters in her dresser.
"I've spent about three to four hours cleaning my
room already," Bumpus said with a sheepish smile but
without stopping. "It's still not done."
On the eve of parents' arrival, there were probably
many other students across campus in the same situation:
vacuuming, tidying, fixing and organizing their rooms to
be presentable.
Beginning today until Saturday, nearly 3,000 parents
are expected to set foot on the Farm for Parents' Week
end 2005. The annual event, sponsored by the Office of
the President and Provost and coordinated by University
Communications, is designed to let parents'of undergrad
uates see their children's natural habitat during the
school year.
Along with Reunion Homecoming, Commencement,
New Student Orientation and Admit Weekend, Parents'
Weekend is considered one of Stanford's "Big 5" events.
During the dozens of activities planned for today and
tomorrow, parents will be able to meet University Presi
dent John Hennessy and Provost John Etchemendy, so
cialize with other parents, tour the campus and attend lec
tures and classes taught by Stanford faculty.
Many parents will begin arriving this evening to settle
in and attend the Writing Center's annual "Celebration
of Writing" event in Margaret Jacks Hall. Both parents
and students will read their own original works and orig
inal music will be performed.
Assistant Director of the Writing Center Wendy
Goldberg expects three or four sets of parents and chil
dren to read their works tonight.
"The students speak in their own voices and you get a
real feel for their interests and concerns," Goldberg said.
"You get a real cross-section of students and interests."
