# Forum reflects on a woman's right to choose
## 
### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Looking to the future of reproductive rights, five
women spoke at the third annual forum reflecting on the
status of choice and women's rights over their bodies.
Keynote speaker Maria Moreno, the field director of
Choice U.S.A., discussed her experiences working with
youths on issues related to reproductive rights and choice.
The panelists focused on the impact four more years of
President George W. Bush will have on these issues.
"If we are a pro-choice majority, why is the threat to re
productive rights greater than ever?" Moreno said.
She first highlighted the history of the battle over re
productive rights, referring to the Hyde amendment of
1976 which banned the use of federal Medicaid dollars for
abortion procedures. She said the amendment resulted
from "strong anti-choice movement" that began locally
and worked its way up to the national level. It eventually
succeeded in making abortion "not a moral issue but a
pocketbook issue," Moreno added.
She also addressed laws that are targeting pharmacies
to limit women's access to birth control, particularly ac
cess to emergency contraception.
"They'll take away a woman's right to choose," said
panelist Gayle Tiller, the public affairs director for
Planned Parenthood in Mar Monte, "then they'll take
away contraceptives. You'll have to show a marriage li
cense, which is totally ridiculous. They'll take away con-
doms from the drug stores."
Tiller said that Planned Parent
hood will ensure that California re
mains pro-choice no matter what
happens.
"Roe was never enough to secure
the reproductive rights for all
women," Moreno said. "I'm not de
moralized. I'm still hopeful, but it is
getting scarier than ever."
Moreno urged students to "rede
fine and broaden the pro-choice
movement." Cari Siestra, the
founder and executive director of
Law Students for Choice, focused on
the structure of the pro-choice vs.
pro-life debate.
According to Siestra, over 70 per
cent of registered Republicans are
pro-choice, but there is a significant
group that remains border-line on
the issue. She concluded that the
pro-choice movement needed to ad
dress the "mushy middle."
Common ground must be found
between pro-lifers and pro-choicers.

Siestra said. One idea presented was
to reach out to those who are anti
abortion but not opposed to contra
ception.
Each of the panelists presented
personal anecdotes that led them to
become "pro choice."
"I had an abortion in the 19405."
said panelist Trish Hooper, a Porto
la Valley resident and wife of the
president of Planned Parenthood
for San Mateo County. "1 was lucky.
I found a doctor."
Diane Morof. a first-year Fellow
in Family Planning at UC San Fran
cisco, stressed the importance of
training new care providers based
on her experience domestically and
internationally working with
refugees.
She said when she found out
there were only four abortion
providers in all of Boston, she began
to see abortion as a potentially life
saving technique in cases where the
mother or child's health is threat
ened.
She encouraged students to take
action on subjects that they care
about, and urged them to see the
issue of women's reproductive
health as a "human rights issue."
