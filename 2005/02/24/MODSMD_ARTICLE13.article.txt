# Students stick to their own race
## 
### BEA SANFORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
College freshmen today are less likely to socialize with students
from other races than in previous years, according to a recent study
released by the Higher Education Research Institution, or HERI.
indicating that racial divides are becoming more pronounced on
campuses across the nation.
The report, entitled "An Overview of the 2(X)4 Freshman
Norms," marked a decrease over the past decade in the number of
students who say it is "essential" or "very important" to help "pro
mote racial understanding."
There is decreased interaction between races and students have
lowered expectations about the likelihood of mixing socially with
those of different races, the report stated.
Only 67.8 percent of freshmen nationwide claimed they fre
quently socialized with someone from a different racial or ethnic
group during high school, and only 63.1 percent reported a "very
good" chance of socializing with someone from another race during
college. Both of these figures have been declining over the past
three years.
While the national trend shows college students becoming more
divided along racial lines, students involved in racial or ethnic
groups at Stanford said they had not noticed any change.
Sophomore Frankie Preciado, co-chair of MeChA, expressed
alarm over the HERI report's national implications, but he said he
felt that Stanford students are moving
in the opposite direction.
"We're trying to collaborate even
more," Preciado said, referring to the
recent effort by different ethnic groups
on campus to work together to host
events exploring issues confronting
minorities.
Preciado highlighted Stanford's
Students of Color Coalition, or SOCC,
as an example of a collaboration be
tween racial groups, including the
Asian American Student Association,
the Black Student Union, MeChA and
the Stanford American Indian Organi
zation.
Senior Michael Brown, co-chair of
the BSU, said that Stanford is more
unified racially than other campuses in
the country, but said that there was still
a lot of room for growth.
"We're far better off than the rest of
the United States," he said, "But that
doesn't mean we don't have a long way
to go."
However, Brown cited the occa
sional hate crimes that occur on cam
pus as proof that problems still exist.
While "less than five" hate crimes get
reported each year. Brown said, "a lot
don't get reported."
Brown added that some students
don't like the large role racial and eth
nic groups play on campus.
"[Some] people [are not] comfort
able with black people congregating,"
he said. "I think that people do think
it's separatist."
Preciado said that minorities, par
ticularly Chicanos. often face "racial
profiling with police or on campus."
Senior Jennifer Chen, co-chair of
A ASA. said she felt that a lack of aid
from the University plays some part in
minorities feeling marginalized on
campus.

"We have a student population
that is more than half minority, but
sometimes the University doesn't
match up to that in terms of support."
she said.
Chen, however, said that Stanford
is doing a pretty good job overall.
"[lt] has an environment conducive
to meeting people of different colors,"
she said.
Sophomore Stephanie Sherman,
who lived in Muwekina last year,
praised student groups' efforts to
reach out to racial minorities.
"The Native-American communi
ty is so small that it definitely is like a
family that welcomes everyone," she
said.
Sherman said she felt the group was
especially effective at reaching stu
dents who spent little time interacting
outside of their ethnic group before
college.
"In my opinion, the Native experi
ence on campus wasn't designed for
me," she said. "Purely based on my ob
servations, it's mainly focused on
bringing those Natives who actually
came from a reservation into a larger
community."
Chen added that the decline in
cross-racial interaction as a problem
that individuals must work against.
"There isn't anything organizations
can do to facilitate [student-to-student
interaction]," Chen said. "That's up to
students."
Chen said she believes many racial
divides are more due to differences in
interests, rather than discrimination.
Student cultural groups tend to attract
members of that culture, and students
form social bonds through the groups
they join, she said.
However, Preciado, Brown and
Chen each stressed that their groups
are making efforts to reach out to peo
ple who not belonging to their own
races.
"We try to open up our events to
everybody so people can learn about
our culture," Preciado said.
