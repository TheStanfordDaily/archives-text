On Feb. 24,1992, The Daily reported an incident at a
"festive," "rockin" party at Kairos. Below is an ex
cerpt:
"A student arrested early Saturday morning for
allegedly throwing beer on two Stanford police offi
cers during a party at Kairos has been charged with
battery of a police officer and resisting arrest, both
misdemeanors.
"According to Stanford Police Sgt. Hilary Karp,
two officers were standing in the foyer of Kairos
when junior Baird MacGuiness sneaked up behind
one of the officers and 'dumped a cup of beer on his
back.' Beer hit both officers, he said.
"Karp said MacGuiness tried to run away but was
'grabbed and taken into custody' by the officers. The
arrest occurred at 2 a.m. Saturday, he said.
" 'The cops came in on a regular noise com
plaint,' said sophomore Gary Herman, a Kairos
resident. Herman described the party as 'festive'
and 'rockin.'

"According to MacGuiness, he was hit by the po
lice. He refused to comment further on the incident,
but he said, '1 hope all police die of AIDS/
"Herman said that several residents believe the
police used excessive force in arresting MacGuiness.
Karp said the officers had a right to act as they did be
cause MacGuiness was running from them.
"Herman said he believed partygoers had been
'obstructive with the police and the police were kind
of pissed off/
"Music from the party could be heard from near
ly two blocks away, Karp said.
" The arrest was not the only incident associated
with the parly, according to Kairos resident Joe
Meltzer. 'Someone stole our seven-ball and broke
our pool cue,' he said."
On Feb. 24,1941, The Daily wrote a story about a dif
ferent kind of policeman doing his job. Below is an
excerpt:
"Tm just sitting here...'
"So "Gordy the Cop' explains his presence in that
little black and white coupe, motor idling, on certain
busy pre-8 o'clock corners.
"But Gordy doesn't 'just sit' there and quietly and
smell the flowers. And he hasn't been hatching any
eggs, either, for every once in a while he slaps two
bucks' worth of little pink tag on some unfortunate
vehicle.
"Gordy Davis, the officer with hawk eyes who
preys upon early morning speeders, says that 'Farm
drivers are inclined to drive much faster and reck
lessly in the morning than later in the day.'
"And that's right out of the feed box."
