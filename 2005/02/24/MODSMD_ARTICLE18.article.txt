## Looking beyond the MCAT Final Txt 
### 
Every year, about a tenth of Stanford under
grads embark on the pre-med quest. They suffer
through organic chemistry classes, pay several
thousand dollars for Kaplan or Princeton Review
prep courses, hunt for recommendation letters and
put in hours of community service on the side â€” all
as a sacrilice to the medical school admissions gods.
When asked why exactly they want to become
doctors, their answers vary from the noble (1 want
to help people / save lives / look just like George
Clooney on ER) to the inquisitive (I am fascinated
by intricacy of the human body) to the obedient

(well, my parents really want
me to get an M.D.).
Overwhelmed by the de
mands of the pre-med curricu
lum, very few Stanford students
realize that there are other ways
to achieve these goals, ways that
are no less rewarding or chal
lenging. 1 am talking about the
"allied health professions":
nursing, physical therapy, mid
wifery, speech therapy and
many others.

"Nurses are an integral part of the healthcare
system, but this career choice is often overlooked
by many undergrads because they are too focused
on becoming doctors," said sophomore Mark Liao,
who is considering pursuing graduate studies in
nursing.
True to the spirit of academic snobbery that
plagues Stanford, some argue that becoming a
nurse or a physician assistant is a waste of their in
tellectual capital. They will be surprised to find out
that the prerequisites for master's degree programs
in the allied health professions are no less rigorous
than those for medical or dental schools.
In addition to the classic chemistry and physics
sequences, allied health schools often require ad
vanced courses in behavioral sciences and anato
my. Most of these programs also expect their stu
dents to complete extensive internships that are
similar to medical residencies in their objectives
and demands.
