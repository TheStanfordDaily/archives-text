# Stellar Suggestions
## Looking beyond the MCAT Final Txt 
### 
Every year, about a tenth of Stanford under
grads embark on the pre-med quest. They suffer
through organic chemistry classes, pay several
thousand dollars for Kaplan or Princeton Review
prep courses, hunt for recommendation letters and
put in hours of community service on the side — all
as a sacrilice to the medical school admissions gods.
When asked why exactly they want to become
doctors, their answers vary from the noble (1 want
to help people / save lives / look just like George
Clooney on ER) to the inquisitive (I am fascinated
by intricacy of the human body) to the obedient

(well, my parents really want
me to get an M.D.).
Overwhelmed by the de
mands of the pre-med curricu
lum, very few Stanford students
realize that there are other ways
to achieve these goals, ways that
are no less rewarding or chal
lenging. 1 am talking about the
"allied health professions":
nursing, physical therapy, mid
wifery, speech therapy and
many others.

"Nurses are an integral part of the healthcare
system, but this career choice is often overlooked
by many undergrads because they are too focused
on becoming doctors," said sophomore Mark Liao,
who is considering pursuing graduate studies in
nursing.
True to the spirit of academic snobbery that
plagues Stanford, some argue that becoming a
nurse or a physician assistant is a waste of their in
tellectual capital. They will be surprised to find out
that the prerequisites for master's degree programs
in the allied health professions are no less rigorous
than those for medical or dental schools.
In addition to the classic chemistry and physics
sequences, allied health schools often require ad
vanced courses in behavioral sciences and anato
my. Most of these programs also expect their stu
dents to complete extensive internships that are
similar to medical residencies in their objectives
and demands.

"I have always found it rather rude
when people look down on nurses be
cause they feel that nurses aren't as
smart as doctors — nothing could be
further from the truth," Liao said.
Allied health professions offer ben
efits that many physicians could only
dream of: flexible working hours, less
insurance paperwork and sustained re
lationships with their patients. Accord
ing to data gathered by the American
Medical Association, allied health pro
fessions guarantee a stable source of in
come that rivals the salary of many pri
mary-care physicians.
"I was very deterred by the fact that
most doctors see their patients for
about ten minutes and that is it," said
senior and aspiring physical therapist
Maria Ranieri. "I really want to be able
to interact with my patients, get to
know them and aid them both physi
cally and mentally."
"Physical therapy is more hands-on
and direct when it comes to human in
teraction and I find that appealing,"

Ranieri added.
Aside from the Undergraduate
Advising Center, there are other re
sources on campus for exploring alter
natives to medical school.
The Human Biology department
hosts several workshops on health
related careers throughout the year
that features Stanford alumni who
have gone off the beaten medical
school track. Vaden Student Health
Center offers internships in both
physical therapy and nutrition, while
the Stanford School of Medicine will
be providing emergency medical
technician certification courses
starting next fall. Additionally, the
Career Development Center offers
day-long shadowing programs, in
cluding but not limited to the health
care professions.
So if only fora second, close your
Biochem book and open your mind —
there are plenty of ways to help people
live healthy lives, and not all of them re
quire taking the MCAT.

by many undergrads because they are too focused
on becoming doctors," said sophomore Mark Liao,
who is considering pursuing graduate studies in
nursing.
True to the spirit of academic snobbery that
plagues Stanford, some argue that becoming a
nurse or a physician assistant is a waste of their in
tellectual capital. They will be surprised to find out
that the prerequisites for master's degree programs
in the allied health professions are no less rigorous
than those for medical or dental schools.
In addition to the classic chemistry and physics
sequences, allied health schools often require ad
vanced courses in behavioral sciences and anato
my. Most of these programs also expect their stu
dents to complete extensive internships that are
similar to medical residencies in their objectives
and demands.

"I have always found it rather rude
when people look down on nurses be
cause they feel that nurses aren't as
smart as doctors — nothing could be
further from the truth," Liao said.
Allied health professions offer ben
efits that many physicians could only
dream of: flexible working hours, less
insurance paperwork and sustained re
lationships with their patients. Accord
ing to data gathered by the American
Medical Association, allied health pro
fessions guarantee a stable source of in
come that rivals the salary of many pri
mary-care physicians.
"I was very deterred by the fact that
most doctors see their patients for
about ten minutes and that is it," said
senior and aspiring physical therapist
Maria Ranieri. "I really want to be able
to interact with my patients, get to
know them and aid them both physi
cally and mentally."
"Physical therapy is more hands-on
and direct when it comes to human in
teraction and I find that appealing,"

Ranieri added.
Aside from the Undergraduate
Advising Center, there are other re
sources on campus for exploring alter
natives to medical school.
The Human Biology department
hosts several workshops on health
related careers throughout the year
that features Stanford alumni who
have gone off the beaten medical
school track. Vaden Student Health
Center offers internships in both
physical therapy and nutrition, while
the Stanford School of Medicine will
be providing emergency medical
technician certification courses
starting next fall. Additionally, the
Career Development Center offers
day-long shadowing programs, in
cluding but not limited to the health
care professions.
So if only fora second, close your
Biochem book and open your mind —
there are plenty of ways to help people
live healthy lives, and not all of them re
quire taking the MCAT.
