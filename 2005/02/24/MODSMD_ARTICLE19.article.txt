According to the Centers for Disease Con
trol and Prevention (CDC), an estimated
850,000 to 950,000 Americans are affected by
HIV, the deadly virus that causes AIDS.
Although there is no cure for HIV, recent
studies at Stanford, Duke, Yale and Harvard
Universities, there may be a simple and effective
way to slow the spread of HIV — routine testing
for HIV by all Americans would not only cut
medical costs but save lives as well.
One study, conducted by researchers at Stan
ford and Duke, revealed that even one test during
the lifetime of adults would reduce new infections
by 20 percent. Even more surprising, the study
demonstrated that every identified infected pa
tient would gain 18 months of life on average.
In the second study by Yale and Harvard re
searchers, routine testing every three to five
years was found to be cost-effective for every
one except those at the lowest-risk for contract
ing the disease — people engaging in celibacy or
who are in monogamous relationships.
Dr. Samuel A. Bozzette, an infectious-dis
ease specialist at the University of California,
San Diego said in a February 10 New York
Times article that routine testing would be the
most effective way of containing the insidious
HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has already taken
15,000 lives in the United States and 3.1 million
lives worldwide.
"Given the availability of effective therapy and
preventive measures, it is possible to improve care
and perhaps influence the course of the epidemic
through widespread, effective and cost-effective
screening," Samuel said in the article.
Currently, the U.S. government only recom
mends HIV screening in areas of high risk, such
as in big cities, and among members of certain
demographic groups, such as gay men and drug
addicts.
This approach, however, overlooks a key as
pect of HIV transmission publicized by The
American Foundation of AIDS Research: "It is
not who you are, but what you do that determines
whether you can become infected with HIV."

From a Medical Standpoint
Donnovan Somera Yisrael, a community
health specialist at Vaden Student Health Cen
ter, said he agreed that routine testing may be
the solution to controlling the AIDS epidemic,
but that it could be costly to subsidize such test
ing from the outside.
"On a nationwide level, if money is found for
it.it could be a good thing," he said. "However,
it's not economically feasible for every single
person at Stanford to come through the door. It
would be great but it might be too expensive."
Regardless of any changes to HIV testing
policies, prevention measures remain critically
important. In addition, routine testing would
still not solve the problem of being able to reach
everyone who needs to be tested such as the
homeless, illegal immigrants, those without
health insurance and those who avoid docton's
visits, Yisrael said.
"On a policy level, [routine testing] will affect
the kind of tests doctors will routinely do," he
said. "From a prevention standpoint, however,
there are very little changes."
"Anybody who's had unprotected sexual inter
course should be tested, whether they live in the
middle of Wyoming or New York City," he added.
Dr. Robyn Tepper, the chief physician of
Medical Services at Vaden Health Center, said
she regards routine testing positively due to the
advantages of early HIV detection.
"Early detection of HIV can be helpful in
many ways," she said. "Some studies show that
more than half of all new HIV infections are
caused by people who do not know that they are
infected. Early detection can serve as a way of
preventing the spread of infection to others, in
cluding the spread of disease from mother to
child in pregnant women."
In addition, Tepper said early detection al
lows the infected patient to receive medications
that can prevent the progression to serious dis
ease or the onset of secondary infections, be
closely monitored for associated malignancies
that may develop and receive counseling and
other social support systems.
'Hit early and hit hard' approach to HIV testing effective

This hit early and hit hard approach, a
phrase commonly used by advocacy groups to
promote early HIV detection, seems to he
gaining ground in the light to increase the long
term health of a patient infected with HIV.
Getting Tested
Stanford students can get tested through
their private medical provider during routine
check-ups or through Vaden's Peer Anony
mous HIV Testing Program, which also pro
vide students with education on the disease
and on sexual health strategies.
"We spend anywhere from 20 minutes to an
hour talking about student's behavioral strate
gies with the goal of helping them achieve a
life-long strategy that's safe," Yisrael said.
Vadenfs HIV testing program uses Ora
sure, a no-needle HIV test that uses oral fluids
to determine if a person is HIV-positive, al
though students can also choose to take the
blood test. The service is free of charge to all
Stanford students, who are guaranteed
anonymity.
"Private medical providers may use HIV
tests that draw blood and will leave behind a
paper trail in a society with HIV/AIDS stig
mas," said Yisrael. "Because of the nature of
the stigma, HIV is the kind of thing people
don't want to have written anywhere."
"Right now, we're in an interesting stage
where this is changing. People are finding out
(HIV] is just a disease like any other," he
added.
Yisrael also emphasized the importance of
educating people on the results of their tests.
"One of the problems with a life-threaten
ing illness is what the person is going to do with
the information," he said.
If a student is found to be HIV-positive, the
anonymous program makes resources avail
able at Stanford Hospital's Positive Care Clin
ic, Vaden Medical Services and Vaden Coun
seling and Psychology Services. Throughout
this entire process, the program says it makes
the most rigorous efforts to avoid compromis

ing student confidentiality.
H.I.V, Prevention
To reduce the risk of becoming HIV-posi
tive, sexually active people are strongly ad
vised to use protection. According to
AIDS.ORG, a nonprofit educational organi
zation, studies have shown that of people who
used latex condoms while having sex with their
HIV infected partners, to KM) percent re
mained uninfected.
"Aside from abstaining from sex, condoms
are the best prevention from the transmission
of STDs," said senior Jennifer Lo, a peer
health educator for Okada. "Condoms, when
used correctly, can save someone from a lot of
anxiety and uncertainty down the road. We're
all busy and overwhelmed students as it is; this
is just another means of relieving a little

worry.
Often, education on preventing HIV infec
tion is directed to younger audiences. Of the
40,(MH) people who are infected every year in
the United States, over half are younger than
25, according to AIDS.ORG.
The Stanford Perspective
On college campuses, one in 500 people is
infected with HIV, according to Yisrael. This is
lower than the national rate, which is one in
200 people.
"HIV 7 is always a serious issue even if just
one person has it, though it's easier to contain
and monitor HIV when fewer people have it,"
said freshman Anne Shedletsky. " The larger
the number of people you have, the higher the
probability of an outbreak."
In terms of routine HIV testing, senior

Sonya Petkova said she felt ambivalent.
"If you are a man in San Francisco who
hooks up constantly, routine testing is a very
good thing," she said. "But if you are like me,
whose love life sucks, there is really no point to
it."
Routine HIV testing could also have im
portant social implications, according to junior
Rachel Field.
"It could change the way HIV would be
viewed socially. If everyone gets tested for
HIV, it becomes something that affects every
one, not just a certain subset of the American
or global populations," she said.
But Tepper said she believes that in HIV
testing, the benefits outweigh the immediate
costs.
"I am sure the experts can give you a per
spective on the cost impact of...prevention or
early detection of AIDS related diseases and
spread of infection to others." she said. "For
me it just makes sense."
The 411 on HIV
According to the CDC. HIV weakens a per
sont's immune system to the point where the
body cannot defend itself against opportunis
tic infections — infections it would be able to
fight if it was healthy.
When this happens, the HIV disease be
comes the full-blown AIDS, which is defined
by an HIV-positive person having fewer than
200 CD4+ T cells per cubic millimeter of
blood, as opposed to a healthy 1.000. CD4+ T
cells, also known as helper T cells, are crucial
to the functioning of the bodyfs immune sys
tem.
HIV is transmitted through blood, semen,
vaginal secretions and breast milk. It can be
transmitted through unprotected sexual con
tact (including vaginal, anal and oral sex), di
rect blood contact (through needles or blood
transfusions) and from mother to child during
birth or breast-milk nursing.
Students should contact Vaden at (650)
498-2336 to schedule a test.
