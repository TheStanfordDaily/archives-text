# Routine HIV testing benefits everyone

According to the Centers for Disease Con
trol and Prevention (CDC), an estimated
850,000 to 950,000 Americans are affected by
HIV, the deadly virus that causes AIDS.
Although there is no cure for HIV, recent
studies at Stanford, Duke, Yale and Harvard
Universities, there may be a simple and effective
way to slow the spread of HIV — routine testing
for HIV by all Americans would not only cut
medical costs but save lives as well.
One study, conducted by researchers at Stan
ford and Duke, revealed that even one test during
the lifetime of adults would reduce new infections
by 20 percent. Even more surprising, the study
demonstrated that every identified infected pa
tient would gain 18 months of life on average.
In the second study by Yale and Harvard re
searchers, routine testing every three to five
years was found to be cost-effective for every
one except those at the lowest-risk for contract
ing the disease — people engaging in celibacy or
who are in monogamous relationships.
Dr. Samuel A. Bozzette, an infectious-dis
ease specialist at the University of California,
San Diego said in a February 10 New York
Times article that routine testing would be the
most effective way of containing the insidious
HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has already taken
15,000 lives in the United States and 3.1 million
lives worldwide.
"Given the availability of effective therapy and
preventive measures, it is possible to improve care
and perhaps influence the course of the epidemic
through widespread, effective and cost-effective
screening," Samuel said in the article.
Currently, the U.S. government only recom
mends HIV screening in areas of high risk, such
as in big cities, and among members of certain
demographic groups, such as gay men and drug
addicts.
This approach, however, overlooks a key as
pect of HIV transmission publicized by The
American Foundation of AIDS Research: "It is
not who you are, but what you do that determines
whether you can become infected with HIV."

From a Medical Standpoint
Donnovan Somera Yisrael, a community
health specialist at Vaden Student Health Cen
ter, said he agreed that routine testing may be
the solution to controlling the AIDS epidemic,
but that it could be costly to subsidize such test
ing from the outside.
"On a nationwide level, if money is found for
it.it could be a good thing," he said. "However,
it's not economically feasible for every single
person at Stanford to come through the door. It
would be great but it might be too expensive."
Regardless of any changes to HIV testing
policies, prevention measures remain critically
important. In addition, routine testing would
still not solve the problem of being able to reach
everyone who needs to be tested such as the
homeless, illegal immigrants, those without
health insurance and those who avoid docton's
visits, Yisrael said.
"On a policy level, [routine testing] will affect
the kind of tests doctors will routinely do," he
said. "From a prevention standpoint, however,
there are very little changes."
"Anybody who's had unprotected sexual inter
course should be tested, whether they live in the
middle of Wyoming or New York City," he added.
Dr. Robyn Tepper, the chief physician of
Medical Services at Vaden Health Center, said
she regards routine testing positively due to the
advantages of early HIV detection.
"Early detection of HIV can be helpful in
many ways," she said. "Some studies show that
more than half of all new HIV infections are
caused by people who do not know that they are
infected. Early detection can serve as a way of
preventing the spread of infection to others, in
cluding the spread of disease from mother to
child in pregnant women."
In addition, Tepper said early detection al
lows the infected patient to receive medications
that can prevent the progression to serious dis
ease or the onset of secondary infections, be
closely monitored for associated malignancies
that may develop and receive counseling and
other social support systems.
