When one thinks of the Pacific-10 Con
ference's toughest road venues, Oregon
State's Gill Coliseum most likely doesn't
come to mind. The non-descript gymnasium
built in 1949. where the Beavers are 10-1 this
season, isn't even the most historically diffi
cult place for opposing teams to visit in the
Beaver State. That title belongs to rival Ore
gon's Mac Arthur Court, where the Ducks
are a respectable 8-4.
Stanford (15-9, 9-5 Pac-10) will tour both
this weekend on its final regular season road
trip of the year, hoping to move closer to se
curing its 11th straight NCAA Tournament
bid.

easy task. Just ask
No. 14 Washington.
Oregon State (14-11,
6-8) dominated the
Huskies 90-73 on
Feb. 13 for its most
impressive win of the
season. But head
coach Jay John's
squad's performance
at home and on the
road this season has
been like night and
day, both literally
and figuratively ac
cording to Stanford
junior point guard
Chris Hernandez.
'it's just a dark
feeling when you
walk into Oregon
State's gym," Her
nandez said. "I don't
feel really good when
1 walk into their gym.
It's nice, but it's just
got a dark sense to it."

Oregon State, which is 2-8 on the road
overall this season, is happy to be home after
extending its Pac-10 road losing streak to 10
games with a pair of losses to the Arizona
schools. The Beavers suffered their only
home loss of the season to Arizona on Jan.
22.
While Stanford senior center Rob Little
has never lost to Oregon State, he is always
wary of the trip to Gill.
"It's usually reasonably full, even though
they haven't always been the best team in
the Pac-10," Little said. "We have to deal
with their crowd because they [are like] the
Sixth Man [Club]. They're right there on the
floor, they come in while you're stretching
and are talking trash."
There hasn't been much trash to talk of
late in the series, as Stanford has won the last
11 times the teams have faced off. The
Beavers made a bid to end that streak —
and their road woes — at Maples Pavilion
on Jan. 27, however.
Oregon State overcame an 18-point sec
ond-half deficit behind 19 points from junior
forward Nick DeWitz and took a one-point
lead with 3:46 to play before clutch free
throw shooting by Hernandez and a late
turnover by Beavers guard Jason Fontenet
allowed Stanford to escape with the win, its
fifth straight.
"1 think in the second half we kind of let
up a little bit on defense and we got re
bounded." junior forward Matt Haryasz
said.
The Cardinal's rebounding has improved
since that game. Buoyed by better numbers
from Haryasz and Little, who are first and
eighth in the conference averaging 9.4 and
7.3 rebounds per game, respectively, Stan
ford has outrebounded its opponents by an
average of 5.5 rebounds per game over the
past six games.
The Beavers, who are the worst rebound
ing team in the Pac-10, are playing for their
postseason lives. Though Oregon
State's struggles on the road have
hurt its now razor-thin NCAA
Tournament hopesaftera 10-3 start,
one more win will guarantee the
program its first winning season
since 1990 and make the Beavers el
igible for inclusion in the NIT.
Senior forward David Lucas,
who is averaging 20.8 points and 10
rebounds over the last six games, is
Oregon State's most potent offen
sive weapon. He fouled out
halfway through the second half of
the first meeting at Maples but still
finished with 15 points and eight
rebounds.
Guards Lamar Hurd, Chris
Stephens, J.S. Nash and Fontenet
complement Lucas and DeWitz's
inside presence.
"They've got a lot of good guards
and they rotate them in a lot," Little
said. "They throw a lot at you. With
their two big guys, it's a good combi
nation and you wonder why they
don't have more wins."
Fontenet, a transfer from New
Mexico State, was especially active
in the teams' first meeting, scoring
eight points, grabbing four re
bounds and dishing out five assists
on a night that Stephens struggled.
"They all have the capability of
shooting and putting it on the floor,
so it's a matter of putting them de
fensively in a position where they
don't feel comfortable making those
great plays," Hernandez said of
Oregon State's guards.
Stanford holds a 1 1 / 2 game lead
over UCLA for third place in the
Pac-10. No team that has finished
third in the Pac-10 has been exclud
ed from the field of 64, but the Car
dinal are approaching every game as
if it's their last.
"Its a must win for us; we're trying
to gel into the NCAA Tournament,"
Little said. "It could be their chance
to really spoil our momentum. We
have to come in there really focused
and know that they're probably look
ing to win a game, especially coming
off a tough road loss."
Stanford is a pedestrian 4-5 on
the road and was swept by the Ari
zona schools on its most recent road
trip but the Cardinal sounded confi
dent about tonight's game.
"We're used to playing on the
road and a lot of the guys on the
team have some experience playing
on the road and winning on the
road," Hernandez said.

easy task. Just ask
No. 14 Washington.
Oregon State (14-11,
6-8) dominated the
Huskies 90-73 on
Feb. 13 for its most
impressive win of the
season. But head
coach Jay John's
squad's performance
at home and on the
road this season has
been like night and
day, both literally
and figuratively ac
cording to Stanford
junior point guard
Chris Hernandez.
'it's just a dark
feeling when you
walk into Oregon
State's gym," Her
nandez said. "I don't
feel really good when
1 walk into their gym.
It's nice, but it's just
got a dark sense to it."

Oregon State, which is 2-8 on the road
overall this season, is happy to be home after
extending its Pac-10 road losing streak to 10
games with a pair of losses to the Arizona
schools. The Beavers suffered their only
home loss of the season to Arizona on Jan.
22.
While Stanford senior center Rob Little
has never lost to Oregon State, he is always
wary of the trip to Gill.
"It's usually reasonably full, even though
they haven't always been the best team in
the Pac-10," Little said. "We have to deal
with their crowd because they [are like] the
Sixth Man [Club]. They're right there on the
floor, they come in while you're stretching
and are talking trash."
There hasn't been much trash to talk of
late in the series, as Stanford has won the last
11 times the teams have faced off. The
Beavers made a bid to end that streak —
and their road woes — at Maples Pavilion
on Jan. 27, however.
Oregon State overcame an 18-point sec
ond-half deficit behind 19 points from junior
forward Nick DeWitz and took a one-point
lead with 3:46 to play before clutch free
throw shooting by Hernandez and a late
turnover by Beavers guard Jason Fontenet
allowed Stanford to escape with the win, its
fifth straight.
"1 think in the second half we kind of let
up a little bit on defense and we got re
bounded." junior forward Matt Haryasz
said.
The Cardinal's rebounding has improved
since that game. Buoyed by better numbers
from Haryasz and Little, who are first and
eighth in the conference averaging 9.4 and
7.3 rebounds per game, respectively, Stan
ford has outrebounded its opponents by an
average of 5.5 rebounds per game over the
past six games.
The Beavers, who are the worst rebound
ing team in the Pac-10, are playing for their
postseason lives. Though Oregon
State's struggles on the road have
hurt its now razor-thin NCAA
Tournament hopesaftera 10-3 start,
one more win will guarantee the
program its first winning season
since 1990 and make the Beavers el
igible for inclusion in the NIT.
Senior forward David Lucas,
who is averaging 20.8 points and 10
rebounds over the last six games, is
Oregon State's most potent offen
sive weapon. He fouled out
halfway through the second half of
the first meeting at Maples but still
finished with 15 points and eight
rebounds.
Guards Lamar Hurd, Chris
Stephens, J.S. Nash and Fontenet
complement Lucas and DeWitz's
inside presence.
"They've got a lot of good guards
and they rotate them in a lot," Little
said. "They throw a lot at you. With
their two big guys, it's a good combi
nation and you wonder why they
don't have more wins."
Fontenet, a transfer from New
Mexico State, was especially active
in the teams' first meeting, scoring
eight points, grabbing four re
bounds and dishing out five assists
on a night that Stephens struggled.
"They all have the capability of
shooting and putting it on the floor,
so it's a matter of putting them de
fensively in a position where they
don't feel comfortable making those
great plays," Hernandez said of
Oregon State's guards.
Stanford holds a 1 1 / 2 game lead
over UCLA for third place in the
Pac-10. No team that has finished
third in the Pac-10 has been exclud
ed from the field of 64, but the Car
dinal are approaching every game as
if it's their last.
"Its a must win for us; we're trying
to gel into the NCAA Tournament,"
Little said. "It could be their chance
to really spoil our momentum. We
have to come in there really focused
and know that they're probably look
ing to win a game, especially coming
off a tough road loss."
Stanford is a pedestrian 4-5 on
the road and was swept by the Ari
zona schools on its most recent road
trip but the Cardinal sounded confi
dent about tonight's game.
"We're used to playing on the
road and a lot of the guys on the
team have some experience playing
on the road and winning on the
road," Hernandez said.
