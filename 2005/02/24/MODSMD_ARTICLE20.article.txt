# Tension, Sinus, Migraine: More than just a pain in the head
## 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For many people,
headaches are just an
occasional nuisance.

For others, they can occur so often or be so de
bilitating that they not only detract significantly from the
quality of life, but require extensive medical treatment.
The Mayo Clinic, a non-profit organization that provides
medical information to the public, estimates that 2K million
Americans get migraines, with women experiencing them three
times as frequently as men. Fifteen percent of migraine oHH
arc defined as "debilitating," which means that pain pi events
sufferers from functioning normally.
According to the Dec. 15, 2004 edition of the American
Family Physician journal, the number of headache-related vis* j
its to a physician has doubled in recent years and is inereas- •

According to Dr. Jin Hahn, an associate professor of Neu
rology at S<|nfc»rd, 10 to 15 percent of adolescents develop

problems with migraines.
Vaden staff members also
emphasized that headaches

continue to be a particularly
large problem for people in
their twenties — which in
cludes Stanford students.

Hahn said he has seen evi
dence of the impact of
headaches on students' academic
lives.

"I know this is a big issue
for some students," he said. "A few

years ago, 1 saw a sophomore who
had such severe migraines that were

not very responsive [to medication] that
she missed a lot of classes. She had to
take a quarter off."

Dr. Robvn Tepper, the chief physi
cian of Medical Services at Vaden Student

Health Center, estimated that the clinic sees

about 10 students a week for headaches, which
are one of the top 30 diagnoses at Stanford. While

headaches can be symptoms of more serious illness-

es or neurological problems, the most common types of
headaches among students — tension, sinus and mi-

graine headaches — are less dangerous.
As the name suggests, tension headaches are brought on by

stress and describe a squeezing feeling at the back of the head,
on the forehead or at the temple. Vaden's online resource on
headaches suggests massages, relaxation and frequent study
breaks as a means of dealing with them.
Sinus headaches accompany congestion and are most effec
tively treated in the short-term by decongestants and antihis
tamines, as well as antibiotics, when necessary.
Migraines are strong headaches, often on just one side of the
head, which are caused by an inflammation of blood vessels.
They are often preceded by auras, which are dots of light that
uovade the vision. Migraines can also be accompanied by nau
sea and sensitivity to light and noise.
Hie most common treatment options include painkillers and
sleep. While ibuprofen and other ovef-the-counter drugs are
often effective. Tepper noted that a drug called Imitrex is used
for migraines that don't respond to anti-inflammatory medica
tions.
Senior Inga Small suffers from relatively minor migraines
about once a month and full-blown, incapacitating ones once
every three months. She said that she often takes some caffeine
in addition to painkillers to help alleviate her migraines.
Despite the usefulness of caffeine in mitigating the symp
toms of migraines, however, she also said that it has sometimes
caused an increase in secondary headaches.
"I 've weaned myself off of caffeine more or less, so 1 don't
get them as often as I used to," she said. "When I was drinking
a Rouble latte every single day, I'd get them every day if I didn't

drink a latte early enough in the day."
Caffeine is just one of many factors that can cause
headaches. While sinus headaches are generally associated with
colds and allergies, tension headaches and migraines can be
brought on by lack of exercise, nutrition problems, alcohol and
stress.
"Triggers can be different for each individual, but lack of
sleep or irregular sleep is a common trigger of migraines or ten
sion headaches," Tepper said.
According to Hahn, a person's tendency to have migraines is
related to their family history, a phenomenon that is confirmed
in Small's case.
"My migraines are often caused by stress, and I have a ge
netic predilection for them," Small said. "My mom and grand
ma had them when they were in their twenties, and my mom's
brother and sister both still have debilitating ones."
In addition to lifestyle adjustments and anti-inflammatory
medications, there are some alternative therapies and prescrip
tion drugs for treating more serious headaches. Stronger
headache medications have been around for several decades,
but Hahn said that newer research has looked at drugs called
triptans, which interact with serotonin to block migraines.
Besides oral medications, Hahn pointed to a few other
headache therapies. Studies have found that riboflavin and
Botox injections to the face can reduce the severity of
headaches. According to the National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Strokes, or NINDS, relaxation therapies and
biofeedback have also been proven effective.
According to the NINDS web site, "Biofeedback refers to a
technique that can give people better control over such body
function indicators as blood pressure, heart rate, temperature,
muscle tension and brain waves."
Thermal biofeedback, for example, involves a patient learn
ing to mentally control the temperature of his or her hands. In
creased hand temperature has been found to result in less fre
quent and less painful migraines.
Hahn said that another important area of headache treat
ment research concerns chronic daily headaches (CDH). The
American Family Physician journal estimates that five percent
of adults have CDH. a condition that can have an even more
detrimental impact on quality of life than the occasional mi
graine. This condition often arises in people who experience
regular migraines and can be a response to overuse of medica
tions.
Researchers and physicians have found CDH to be difficult
to treat, according to Hahn.
Most treatments deal with headaches largely as a stand
alone problem. Though they can occasionally serve as an indi
cator of neurological problems, additional symptoms like vom
iting, fever or chronic headaches that don't respond to treat
ment are generally needed to point to more serious issues, ac
cording to Tepper.
"The bottom line is that headaches are common and can be
a major source of down time for individuals, but they are rarely
a sign of something serious," she said.

headaches can be symptoms of more serious illness-

es or neurological problems, the most common types of
headaches among students — tension, sinus and mi-

graine headaches — are less dangerous.
As the name suggests, tension headaches are brought on by

stress and describe a squeezing feeling at the back of the head,
on the forehead or at the temple. Vaden's online resource on
headaches suggests massages, relaxation and frequent study
breaks as a means of dealing with them.
Sinus headaches accompany congestion and are most effec
tively treated in the short-term by decongestants and antihis
tamines, as well as antibiotics, when necessary.
Migraines are strong headaches, often on just one side of the
head, which are caused by an inflammation of blood vessels.
They are often preceded by auras, which are dots of light that
uovade the vision. Migraines can also be accompanied by nau
sea and sensitivity to light and noise.
Hie most common treatment options include painkillers and
sleep. While ibuprofen and other ovef-the-counter drugs are
often effective. Tepper noted that a drug called Imitrex is used
for migraines that don't respond to anti-inflammatory medica
tions.
Senior Inga Small suffers from relatively minor migraines
about once a month and full-blown, incapacitating ones once
every three months. She said that she often takes some caffeine
in addition to painkillers to help alleviate her migraines.
Despite the usefulness of caffeine in mitigating the symp
toms of migraines, however, she also said that it has sometimes
caused an increase in secondary headaches.
"I 've weaned myself off of caffeine more or less, so 1 don't
get them as often as I used to," she said. "When I was drinking
a Rouble latte every single day, I'd get them every day if I didn't

drink a latte early enough in the day."
Caffeine is just one of many factors that can cause
headaches. While sinus headaches are generally associated with
colds and allergies, tension headaches and migraines can be
brought on by lack of exercise, nutrition problems, alcohol and
stress.
"Triggers can be different for each individual, but lack of
sleep or irregular sleep is a common trigger of migraines or ten
sion headaches," Tepper said.
According to Hahn, a person's tendency to have migraines is
related to their family history, a phenomenon that is confirmed
in Small's case.
"My migraines are often caused by stress, and I have a ge
netic predilection for them," Small said. "My mom and grand
ma had them when they were in their twenties, and my mom's
brother and sister both still have debilitating ones."
In addition to lifestyle adjustments and anti-inflammatory
medications, there are some alternative therapies and prescrip
tion drugs for treating more serious headaches. Stronger
headache medications have been around for several decades,
but Hahn said that newer research has looked at drugs called
triptans, which interact with serotonin to block migraines.
Besides oral medications, Hahn pointed to a few other
headache therapies. Studies have found that riboflavin and
Botox injections to the face can reduce the severity of
headaches. According to the National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Strokes, or NINDS, relaxation therapies and
biofeedback have also been proven effective.
According to the NINDS web site, "Biofeedback refers to a
technique that can give people better control over such body
function indicators as blood pressure, heart rate, temperature,
muscle tension and brain waves."
Thermal biofeedback, for example, involves a patient learn
ing to mentally control the temperature of his or her hands. In
creased hand temperature has been found to result in less fre
quent and less painful migraines.
Hahn said that another important area of headache treat
ment research concerns chronic daily headaches (CDH). The
American Family Physician journal estimates that five percent
of adults have CDH. a condition that can have an even more
detrimental impact on quality of life than the occasional mi
graine. This condition often arises in people who experience
regular migraines and can be a response to overuse of medica
tions.
Researchers and physicians have found CDH to be difficult
to treat, according to Hahn.
Most treatments deal with headaches largely as a stand
alone problem. Though they can occasionally serve as an indi
cator of neurological problems, additional symptoms like vom
iting, fever or chronic headaches that don't respond to treat
ment are generally needed to point to more serious issues, ac
cording to Tepper.
"The bottom line is that headaches are common and can be
a major source of down time for individuals, but they are rarely
a sign of something serious," she said.

For many people,
headaches are just an
occasional nuisance.

For others, they can occur so often or be so de
bilitating that they not only detract significantly from the
quality of life, but require extensive medical treatment.
The Mayo Clinic, a non-profit organization that provides
medical information to the public, estimates that 2K million
Americans get migraines, with women experiencing them three
times as frequently as men. Fifteen percent of migraine oHH
arc defined as "debilitating," which means that pain pi events
sufferers from functioning normally.

According to Dr. Jin Hahn, an associate professor of Neu
rology at S<|nfc»rd, 10 to 15 percent of adolescents develop

problems with migraines.
Vaden staff members also
emphasized that headaches

continue to be a particularly
large problem for people in
their twenties — which in
cludes Stanford students.

Hahn said he has seen evi

headaches on students' academic
lives.

"I know this is a big issue
for some students," he said. "A few

years ago, 1 saw a sophomore who
had such severe migraines that were

not very responsive [to medication] that
she missed a lot of classes. She had to
take a quarter off."
