### FRANCIE NEUKOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Representatives from both the Stanford Coali
tion for Investment Disclosure or SOD and Stan
ford Students for Relief or SSR presented to the
Graduate Student Council at its meeting last night.
The CiSC also discussed a new way to spread the
word about the upcoming GSC elections that will
take place next quarter.
S( ID speaker Ryan Schwartz spoke about Stan
lord s endowment and how it is spent. He argued
that the endowment, which is currently $12.2 billion,
is mostly invested in companies for profit.
According to Schwartz, Stanford is among the
top two percent of colleges in the country when it
comes to investment profit, but the University does
not disclose its investments to the public. The Uni
versity's Board of Trustees can demand that invest
ment information be disclosed, but it has chosen not
to, Schwartz said.
The SCID was founded following Stanford's in
vestment in companies that supported apartheid in
South Africa in (he 1970s and companies that used
Burmese slave labor in the mid-19905, according to
Schwartz.
Students are now able to file complaints con
cerning University investments through the Advi
sory Panel on Investment Responsibility, which
then reviews companies and reports its findings to
the Board of Trustees. Because Stanford is a non
profit and invests in companies indirectly through
other funds, it is not forced to file reports regarding
specific investments.
"We need the GSC to endorse the disclosure of
public and private equity, as well as the reform of

the oversight system," Schwartz said.
fie recommended that a bill be drawn up as an
official GSC-supported statement on the issue.
Council members voiced their concerns that pub
lie disclosure of University investments could hurt in
vestment returns since people seeing what compa
nies Stanford invested in could take advantage of the
information for their own financial benefit.
The GSC members decided to form a committee
to further address the topic.
Mechanical engineering graduate student Sri
liari Yamanoor from the SSR reported that the Uni
versity has already given $55,000 to Save the Chil
dren, a charity for tsunami relief. The charity has
now received as many donations as it needs and is
no longer accepting funds.
Accordingly, the SSR is currently raising money
for speakers to come to inform students about dis
asters. For instance, the group hopes to host eyewit
nesses of the tsunami in the future.

"The SSR is not just for reaction to disasters, hut
rather to spread awareness and educate students
ahout them," Yamanoor said.
The (JSC plans to sell at least I(X) tickets for an
upcoming talk entitled "Expanding the Frontiers of
Modern Science" featuring four Stanford Nobel
laureates — Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow,
Graduate School of Business Prof. William Sharpe
and Stanford Linear Accelerator Center Profs.
Richard Taylor and Martin Perl. The talk will he
held March 1, and ticket sales will go toward fund
ing future SSR events.
Lastly, GSC members proposed a plan inform
ing students about upcoming elections — Chap
stick. The lip balm will feature candidate-applica
tion deadlines and voting times on its outer case.
"Chapstick is something people have in their
hand, in their car, in their purse," said CSC Presi
dent Moriah Thomason. "It's a good way to get the
word out."
