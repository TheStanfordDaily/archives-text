# Harvard President receives criticism
## 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
In a joint statement, Stanford
University President John Hen
nessy and two other university
presidents chided Harvard Uni
versity President Lawrence Sum
mers in an official statement for
reinforcing negative gender
stereotypes.
"Speculation that 'innate dif
ferences' may be a significant
cause of under-representation by
women in science and engineering
may rejuvenate old myths and re
inforce negative stereotypes and
biases," the three presidents
wrote.
The 700-word statement was
co-signed by Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology President
Susan Hockfield and Princeton
President Shirley M. Tilghman.
Although, the presidents soft
ened their criticism of Summers
— only mentioning him by name
once in the document — such a
statement is almost unprecedent
ed, since it is very rare for univer
sity presidents to scold a peer.
"We felt a statement from
three presidents who were also
scientists might be helpful in fram

ing the national debate around
why it is important that women
participate in the scientific enter
prise," Tilghman said in an e-mail
to The Daily.
Hennessy declined to offer
comment to The Daily, and said
that he hopes the statement
speaks for itself and his viewpoint.
In their reply to Summers' re
marks, the presidents sought to re
focus public attention on encour
agement for women to enter into
scientific fields.
"The question we must ask as a
society is not 'can women excel in
math, science and engineering?'
— Marie Curie exploded that
myth a century ago — but "How
can we encourage more women
with exceptional abilities to pur
sue careers in these fields?'" they
wrote.
Tilghman. Hennessy and
Hockfield recommended im
proved teaching methods,
stronger mentors, higher expecta
tions for women students and an
academic environment more
amenable to female faculty with
children.
Summers is confronting a
tough crowd at his own university as
well.
Braving the cold, about 70 Har
vard students recently bundled up
and trooped in front of the universi
ty?s Science Center to "speak out
for an anti-sexist Harvard."
The event was planned to coin
cide with an emergency meeting of
Harvard's faculty to discuss the con
troversy surrounding university
President Lawrence H. Summers,
who recently made public remarks
suggesting that women are geneti
cally less skilled in math and the sci
ences.
"We're embarrassed to have
Larry Summers represent this uni
versity," said senior Amee Chew
during the opening remarks of the
rally.
According to David Zhou, a re
porter for The Harvard Crimson,
Chew was interrupted by a chorus of
"That's right."
Summers' remarks catalyzed crit
icism not only from students, but
also from his faculty — some of
whom are calling fora vote of no
confidence in his leadership.
For female professors who said

they felt snubbed by Summers' com
ments, the statement from the three
presidents? was a welcome move.
"It's fantastic that these three
academic leaders are sending a posi
tive message to young women and to
women scientists and engineers,"
Harvard Chemistry Prof. Cynthia
Friend told The Daily. "I'm pleased
that they are taking a stand on this
important issue."
Summers' comments have
prompted two faculty meetings, the
most recent on Tuesday, to discuss
his leadership.
"It's not simply a matter of that
one comment or this particular
issue," said Harvard History De
partment Chair Andrew D. Gordon
in an interview with The Crimson,
the only publication allowed at the
meetings. "There's widespread dis
content at multiple levels...catalyzed
by this one event."
Summers' future has not yet been
determined. As of yet, the vote of no
confidence has not yet been made
and Summers has pledged to work
to address faculty concerns.
At present, his comments have
put Harvard's ivy walls in the lime
light and divided both faculty and
students.
"If I could turn back the clock, I
would have said and done things
very differently," Summers said to
his faculty.

tive message to young women and to
women scientists and engineers,"
Harvard Chemistry Prof. Cynthia
Friend told The Daily. "I'm pleased
that they are taking a stand on this
important issue."
Summers' comments have
prompted two faculty meetings, the
most recent on Tuesday, to discuss
his leadership.
"It's not simply a matter of that
one comment or this particular
issue," said Harvard History De
partment Chair Andrew D. Gordon
in an interview with The Crimson,
the only publication allowed at the
meetings. "There's widespread dis
content at multiple levels...catalyzed
by this one event."
Summers' future has not yet been
determined. As of yet, the vote of no
confidence has not yet been made
and Summers has pledged to work
to address faculty concerns.
At present, his comments have
put Harvard's ivy walls in the lime
light and divided both faculty and
students.
"If I could turn back the clock, I
would have said and done things
very differently," Summers said to
his faculty.
In a joint statement, Stanford
University President John Hen
nessy and two other university
presidents chided Harvard Uni
versity President Lawrence Sum
mers in an official statement for
reinforcing negative gender
stereotypes.
"Speculation that 'innate dif
ferences' may be a significant
cause of under-representation by
women in science and engineering
may rejuvenate old myths and re
inforce negative stereotypes and
biases," the three presidents
wrote.
The 700-word statement was
co-signed by Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology President
Susan Hockfield and Princeton
President Shirley M. Tilghman.
Although, the presidents soft
ened their criticism of Summers
— only mentioning him by name
once in the document — such a
statement is almost unprecedent
ed, since it is very rare for univer
sity presidents to scold a peer.
"We felt a statement from
three presidents who were also
scientists might be helpful in fram

ing the national debate around
why it is important that women
participate in the scientific enter
prise," Tilghman said in an e-mail
to The Daily.
Hennessy declined to offer
comment to The Daily, and said
that he hopes the statement
speaks for itself and his viewpoint.
In their reply to Summers' re
marks, the presidents sought to re
focus public attention on encour
agement for women to enter into
scientific fields.
"The question we must ask as a
society is not 'can women excel in
math, science and engineering?'
— Marie Curie exploded that
myth a century ago — but "How
can we encourage more women
with exceptional abilities to pur
sue careers in these fields?'" they
wrote.
Tilghman. Hennessy and
Hockfield recommended im
proved teaching methods,
stronger mentors, higher expecta
tions for women students and an
academic environment more
amenable to female faculty with
children.
Summers is confronting a
tough crowd at his own university as
well.
Braving the cold, about 70 Har
vard students recently bundled up
and trooped in front of the universi
ty?s Science Center to "speak out
for an anti-sexist Harvard."
The event was planned to coin
cide with an emergency meeting of
Harvard's faculty to discuss the con
troversy surrounding university
President Lawrence H. Summers,
who recently made public remarks
suggesting that women are geneti
cally less skilled in math and the sci
ences.
"We're embarrassed to have
Larry Summers represent this uni
versity," said senior Amee Chew
during the opening remarks of the
rally.
According to David Zhou, a re
porter for The Harvard Crimson,
Chew was interrupted by a chorus of
"That's right."
Summers' remarks catalyzed crit
icism not only from students, but
also from his faculty — some of
whom are calling fora vote of no
confidence in his leadership.
For female professors who said

they felt snubbed by Summers' com
ments, the statement from the three
presidents? was a welcome move.
"It's fantastic that these three
academic leaders are sending a posi
tive message to young women and to
women scientists and engineers,"
Harvard Chemistry Prof. Cynthia
Friend told The Daily. "I'm pleased
that they are taking a stand on this
important issue."
Summers' comments have
prompted two faculty meetings, the
most recent on Tuesday, to discuss
his leadership.
"It's not simply a matter of that
