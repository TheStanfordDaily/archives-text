In a joint statement, Stanford
University President John Hen

presidents chided Harvard Uni
versity President Lawrence Sum
mers in an official statement for
reinforcing negative gender
stereotypes.

scientific fields.
"The question we must ask as a
society is not 'can women excel in
math, science and engineering?'
— Marie Curie exploded that
myth a century ago — but "How
can we encourage more women
with exceptional abilities to pur
