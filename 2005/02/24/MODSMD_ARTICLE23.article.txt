## 
### BOB BOREK 
Inspired by "The Daily Show" host Jon Stew
art. two sophomores are planning to launch their
own mock news broadcast show. The first episode
will air midway through spring quarter on the
Stanford Cardinal Broadcasting Network, or
SCBN.
"We see so much inane and ridiculous stuff
happen on campus that the material fora Stan
ford-focused 'Daily Show' basically writes itself,"
co-creator David Heyman said.
Whereas Stewart's show focuses on national
news, Heyman and the other co-creator, Darren
Franich. said they will restrict their subject matter
those that relate to Stanford.
Neither is concerned about coming up with
enough material.
Franich called Stanford "a hotbed of eccentric
ity."
"Our plan is to deconstruct every aspect of
campus life with a delicate mixture of subtle wit
and farcical absurdity," Franich said.

Heyman observed that Gaieties, the comic stu
dent performance before Big Game, and the
Chapparal, the humor magazine, offer similar
jokes to what Heyman has in mind.
"It is due time that these jokes leave the stage
and the page and get onto the TV," he said.
Heyman and Franich met last year when they
lived on the same hall in Larkin and have main
tained a close friendship ever since. Midway
through the school year, the two were comparing
ideas for an extra-curricular activity when they
stumbled upon the idea fora TV show.
"It was very much a mutual realization that cre
ating a TV show would be an amazing way for us
to spend our time," Heyman said.
The two seem to be taking their new job very
seriously.
"We want to put a lot of effort into this show so
it doesn't come out as bush-league," Heyman said.
Both Heyman and Franich encourage people
to audition for the show. Specifically, they are
looking for writers, actors, camera people and a
technical crew, the two said. Though Heyman and

Franich will serve as lead anchors, they would like
people to come forward with ideas for short seg
ments.
"Our goal is to have enough people that we can
have two or three other crews with a cameraman,
writer and reporter," Heyman said.
He added that the crews will conduct interviews
and do special reports 'in the field' that will he in
corporated into the main broadcast."
Heyman and Franich plan on having at least
one episode a week. Both said they feel that their
show could potentially revive the campus net
work.
"SCBN has had a few off years, but it has the
possibility to be a major cultural entity on cam
pus," Franich said. "If the show's as good as we
know it will be, it could motivate more student
programming."
Heyman agreed, citing SCBN as one of their
major inspirations for going ahead with the show.
"We both saw the potential for SCBN as an in
credible and underutilized venue for self-expres
sion. That and we love making fun of people."
