## Editorial Student union plans need improvement 
### 
Recently released plans to renovate Old Union in
cludes the addition of 31,(MK) square feet of new space
to be used fora large lounge area, large communal
rooms for student-group meetings and a late-night
cafe. Along with the existing Native American Cultur
al Center and Asian American Activities Center, the
()llice of Religious Life will find a home in this new stu
dent union.
But how will the new center differ from what exists
already? While the extra consideration for the needs of
on-campus groups is certainly welcome, the Universi
ty's administration is forgetting the individual needs of
its students. For example, despite repeated requests
from students for increased individual study space on
campus, the University seems to be passing up a fresh
opportunity to address these student needs.
For those who must stay up late (or heaven forbid,
pull an all-nighter), on-campus locations for studying
are unsatisfactory in quality and insufficient in quanti
ty. Virtually the only 24-hour workplace at Stanford,
Meyer Library is uncomfortable, devoid of atmo
sphere and eerily reminiscent of an empty airport ter
minal. Areas of Green Library or Stern dining, which
are often preferred by busy students, close early on
Saturday nights and are not open late enough on
weeknights.
This problem is only compounded by the dearth of
eating facilities that are open 24 hours, or at least later

than I a.m. Most students can attest to the fact that
working late into the night is sometimes necessary.
An area can only truly be considered a "student
union" if it is utilized by students and seen as a central
hub for campus activity. As our peers on the East Coast
have discovered, merely creating open space for stu
dents in a building is not enough to draw people inside.
The student union at Cornell University, for exam
ple. fosters a student-centered atmosphere by housing
a ceramics studio, darkroom, music room with head
phones and art gallery for students to exhibit their work
â€” in addition to plenty of student study space and din
ing facilities.
In order to bring students together, we must in
crease possibilities for individuals to socialize with each
other on campus. As the proposal for the new union is
still being developed, there is still time for the adminis
tration to ask for more student input on possible fea
tures that could be added to enhance its attractiveness
and make it more useful for academic and social needs.
Although the plans fora new student union show
that the administration is making a considerate effort
to support student groups on campus, they neglect to
factor in the needs of individual students who need
workspace as much as groups do. Rather than increas
ing the supply of space on campus, the administration
must realize that without acknowledging students' ex
isting demands, nothing will change.
