## No more majors 
### 
Ever notice that some people have
an easy time choosing a major, but oth
ers agonize about the choice for years?
I've been talking with several friends in
the second category. Whether they
want to do something that doesn't re
quire them to specialize or whether they
can't decide what to specialize in, they
don't want to pick a major.
And I say they shouldn't have to.
'I he only students win> sh<mid have U

choose majors arc those who have an easy time doing so
anyway: the students who know that what they want to do
after college requires academic specialization.
Pre-med students can major in biology. Future math pro
lessors can major in math. But why should the rest of us have
to specialize as undergrads?
A bachelor's degree used to be the last degree many peo
ple earned, and employers looked for students who had ma
jored in a subject relevant to the job. But now, with post
graduate degrees required for more and more jobs, it
doesn't make sense to specialize as an undergrad since it's
the subject you study in your final degree that counts. With
interdisciplinary work becoming more popular, you don't
really need a bachelor's degree in the subject you study in
grad school. I have friends in the biology grad school who
studied math and physics as undergrads, and my biology fac
ulty advisor has a Ph.D. in physics.

The people who make decisions about academic re
quirements (i.e. the faculty and administrators) usually hold
terminal degrees, which means they have specialized in a
specific field. In my experience, faculty tend to want stu
dents to follow in their path. No wonder they want under
graduates to narrow their focus.
What would be better than having majors?
There is the individually-designed major option. How
ever, an ll)M still requires that you plan your courses ahead
of time, fulfill the core requirements of one of your three
mentors' departments and show that your plan can't be
achieved by any combination of the scores of majors and mi
nors available at Stanford. As a first step. I'd say Stanford
should make IDMs easier to apply for (i.e. allow students to
apply at any time of year, instead of just once a year) and
give students more freedom in how they design an IDM.
What if students didn't have to choose majors and just
needed a certain number of upper division courses to grad
uate? If this were the case, every course you took would be
like an elective â€” a class you enrolled in by choice, not be
cause your major required it. And you could choose a career
without feeling pushed into your department's associated
career paths. But most importantly, you could focus on get
ting an education instead of fulfilling degree requirements.
I wonder what sophomores would talk about then.

Andrea thinks that the study of overspecialization is not spe
cialized enough. E-mail her at arunyan(fPstanford.edu.
