## Bravman's plan excludes student voice 
### LINDA LEE REID YOKOYAMA 
On Feb. S. Vice Provost of Undergraduate Education
John Bravman introduced major housing changes to the
Board of Trustees and ASSU executives. While these
changes are clearly a major overhaul to student residential
life, which is a significant part of our Stanford experience,
it was indirectly announced to the general student popula
tion two days later in an advertisement on the back of The
Stanford Daily. Until that point, the majority of the under
graduate population was never consulted, let alone com
prehensively, on an issue that directly affects them.
The housing plan would essentially eliminate four
class dorms by creating a "mega-Branner" and nega
tively impact ethnic theme houses. Ujamaa would be
moved out of Lagunita without the residents' consent,
upperclassmen of Casa Zapata and Okada would be
isolated and surrounded by an all-frosh Stern and
Wilbur, making such housing arrangements clearly
unattractive, and there is a disturbing silence as to
what will happen to Muwekma. Freshmen would be
isolated in all ethnic theme dorms from all of their
peers. It seems obvious that not all freshmen want to
live in all-frosh dorms. And not any theme dorms have
asked to be moved.
It is unacceptable that students are asked to express
their opinions after a concrete proposal has already been
made, without any clear methods to do so. and without as
surance that their opinions will matter. In a Feb. 14 Daily
article, Bravman claimed that student responses have been
"overwhelmingly positive" ("HousingChanges Spark Dis
cussion," Feb. 14). Bravman's statements prompted stu
dents to send e-mails expressing opposition and concerns
over the proposed changes — we received copies of near
ly I (X) such e-mails last week. To date, not one student has
received a response, making it difficult to believe that our
opinions matter to the University.
This proposal threatens to sever the important connec
tions and friendships between under- and upperclassmen
that four-class dorms foster as well as threaten to com
pletely isolate and marginalize ethnic theme dorms on
campus, either by making them the only four-class dorms
in all of Wilbur and Stem or by isolating the freshmen who
chose to live in them as the only freshmen not in "mega-

Branner" and not a part of the "common freshmen expe
rience" (advertisement in The Daily, Feb. 10).
The University's trend of token inclusion of student
voice is especially alarming and disheartening when we
examine past student struggles to create ethnic theme
dorms and foster a multicultural campus. Yet. the Uni
versity is willing to reverse these institutions without
even once consulting the students who live or have lived
there; it is worth noting that Bravman's visit to Ujamaa
to announce his plan to remove the community out of its
home was less than well-received. The Bravman insisted
in a Daily article that his plan will "meet demands for
more all-freshman housing" and "create more desirable
upper-class housing" ("Bravman pitches housing over
haul." Feb. 9), yet fails to provide evidence that students
have actively voiced these needs.
Bravman's new undergraduate housing plan is not the
only issue that highlights the lack of student input in cam
pus decision-making processes. On Feb. 3, the Faculty Sen
ate solely made the final decision to change the General
Education Requirements, effectively reducing the impor
tance of race and gender to our general education.
The University needs to recognize that students are
mobilizing to demand that their voice be heard. We ask
that Bravman show his commitment to students by tak
ing the first step and hold a public town hall to make clear
to students how they will be actively involved in the de
cision-making process.
Ultimately, decisions affecting students cannot be
made with minimal or token student involvement. Stan
ford. as a leader in higher education, cannot continue in
this undemocratic approach to decision-making. There
needs to be more transparency and democracy in deci
sions made overall. Students need a real voice in deci
sion-making process that affect their lives and their
learning. The University is only a name without its stu
dents; therefore, it is our lives and our education that
should be the foremost concerns of the University, and
we should have a say in it.

opinions matter to the University.
This proposal threatens to sever the important connec
tions and friendships between under- and upperclassmen
that four-class dorms foster as well as threaten to com
pletely isolate and marginalize ethnic theme dorms on
campus, either by making them the only four-class dorms
in all of Wilbur and Stem or by isolating the freshmen who
chose to live in them as the only freshmen not in "mega-

Branner" and not a part of the "common freshmen expe
rience" (advertisement in The Daily, Feb. 10).
The University's trend of token inclusion of student
voice is especially alarming and disheartening when we
examine past student struggles to create ethnic theme
dorms and foster a multicultural campus. Yet. the Uni
versity is willing to reverse these institutions without
even once consulting the students who live or have lived
there; it is worth noting that Bravman's visit to Ujamaa
to announce his plan to remove the community out of its
home was less than well-received. The Bravman insisted
in a Daily article that his plan will "meet demands for
more all-freshman housing" and "create more desirable
upper-class housing" ("Bravman pitches housing over
haul." Feb. 9), yet fails to provide evidence that students
have actively voiced these needs.
Bravman's new undergraduate housing plan is not the
only issue that highlights the lack of student input in cam
pus decision-making processes. On Feb. 3, the Faculty Sen
ate solely made the final decision to change the General
Education Requirements, effectively reducing the impor
tance of race and gender to our general education.
The University needs to recognize that students are
mobilizing to demand that their voice be heard. We ask
that Bravman show his commitment to students by tak
ing the first step and hold a public town hall to make clear
to students how they will be actively involved in the de
cision-making process.
Ultimately, decisions affecting students cannot be
made with minimal or token student involvement. Stan
ford. as a leader in higher education, cannot continue in
this undemocratic approach to decision-making. There
needs to be more transparency and democracy in deci
sions made overall. Students need a real voice in deci
sion-making process that affect their lives and their
learning. The University is only a name without its stu
dents; therefore, it is our lives and our education that
should be the foremost concerns of the University, and
we should have a say in it.

On Feb. S. Vice Provost of Undergraduate Education
John Bravman introduced major housing changes to the
Board of Trustees and ASSU executives. While these
changes are clearly a major overhaul to student residential
life, which is a significant part of our Stanford experience,
it was indirectly announced to the general student popula
tion two days later in an advertisement on the back of The
Stanford Daily. Until that point, the majority of the under
graduate population was never consulted, let alone com
prehensively, on an issue that directly affects them.
The housing plan would essentially eliminate four
class dorms by creating a "mega-Branner" and nega
tively impact ethnic theme houses. Ujamaa would be
moved out of Lagunita without the residents' consent,
upperclassmen of Casa Zapata and Okada would be
isolated and surrounded by an all-frosh Stern and
Wilbur, making such housing arrangements clearly
unattractive, and there is a disturbing silence as to
what will happen to Muwekma. Freshmen would be
isolated in all ethnic theme dorms from all of their
peers. It seems obvious that not all freshmen want to
live in all-frosh dorms. And not any theme dorms have
asked to be moved.
It is unacceptable that students are asked to express
their opinions after a concrete proposal has already been
made, without any clear methods to do so. and without as
surance that their opinions will matter. In a Feb. 14 Daily
article, Bravman claimed that student responses have been
"overwhelmingly positive" ("HousingChanges Spark Dis
cussion," Feb. 14). Bravman's statements prompted stu
dents to send e-mails expressing opposition and concerns
over the proposed changes — we received copies of near
ly I (X) such e-mails last week. To date, not one student has
received a response, making it difficult to believe that our
opinions matter to the University.
