# Writing in the Margins
## Book clubs, yeah! 
### 
The Kepler's community may
not have become one of my worlds
yet. but a literary community of my
own has already cropped up at Stan
ford. At the beginning of Winter
Quarter, I nonchalantly suggested

that it would be
cool if the dorm
had a book club.
The person I
shared this with
thought with
thought it was
quite the idea
and decided to
make it a reality.
The formation of

the Alondra book club (still be
grudgingly called Alondraßeads)
became official at the next house
meeting.
Alondraßeads gives me a sense
of literary belonging. Everyone in
Alondraßeads picks up the same
photocopied selection from outside
the resident SLE tutor's door some
time before the Sunday 11:30 AM
meeting. We all read the said selec
tion, hopefully, before the meeting.
And from our shared reading, we ar
rive at Alondraßeads with a thou
sand thoughts on the same topic tor
menting our minds.
I've always wanted to read for
pleasure with others. In high school,
one of my friends was in a book club
created by her mother and friends. 1
won't deny that it probably existed to
bring mothers closer to their teenage
daughters; calling it Mother-Daugh
ter Book Club gave its motives away.
Even though they read some pretty
maudlin stuff. 1 still thought it was
cool that my friend had a book club. 1
wanted a book club, preferably one
that wasn't Mother-Daughter.
Book clubs appeal to me because
nothing gets me hotter or more both
ered than talking about what 1 read
outside of class. 1 enjoy reading
alone. Most of the books I've read
I've never talked about to anyone
else, even my favorite titles. Any

book I discuss wilh other people,
however, immediately becomes rich
er and more interesting in my mind.
Books were meant to be discussed.
They themselves are nothing but
grand conversations in a form acces
sible to the literate, great oral stories
and philosophical mumblings print
ed on the page. Authors try to com
municate to their readers and they
try to understand the author's side of
the conversation. But we have our
own chance to tag onto the author's
words by talking about them. Start
ing conversations with people about
books is the next logical step.
Alondraßeads sits together
waiting fora conversation to start
every Sunday. Last week we read
"Going Up the Mountain Coming
Down Slowly" by Dave Eggers. It
isn't the greatest story in the world.
But when Alondraßeads con
vened to discuss the story, we tried
to make sense of the competent
mess that had arrived the previous
night. Discussing "Going Up the
Mountain Coming Down Slowly"
with others incited an immediate
interest in the work within me.
Had 1 read it alone, I would have
relegated it to the stack of "good
but not great" stories. But 1 didn't
read it alone. I read it with other
people. In that community, the
story seemed worth discussing,
rather than just leaving behind tin
my literary journeys.
I should mention that there are
two members of Alondraßeads: my
self and the resident SLE tutor,
Alyssa. It's a bit sad, and pathetic,
having a book club of two, but 1 still
stand by all my previous blathering on
the subject. 1 may not have a group as
large as the Kepler's crew, or the
amount of donuts in a box of Krispy
Kreme doughnuts, but at least I'm not
on alone on this literary journey.

residents to attend Alondraßeads. li

created by her mother and friends. 1
won't deny that it probably existed to
bring mothers closer to their teenage
daughters; calling it Mother-Daugh
ter Book Club gave its motives away.
Even though they read some pretty
maudlin stuff. 1 still thought it was
cool that my friend had a book club. 1
wanted a book club, preferably one
that wasn't Mother-Daughter.
Book clubs appeal to me because
nothing gets me hotter or more both
ered than talking about what 1 read
outside of class. 1 enjoy reading
alone. Most of the books I've read
I've never talked about to anyone
else, even my favorite titles. Any

book I discuss wilh other people,
however, immediately becomes rich
er and more interesting in my mind.
Books were meant to be discussed.
They themselves are nothing but
grand conversations in a form acces
sible to the literate, great oral stories
and philosophical mumblings print
ed on the page. Authors try to com
municate to their readers and they
try to understand the author's side of
the conversation. But we have our
own chance to tag onto the author's
words by talking about them. Start
ing conversations with people about
books is the next logical step.
Alondraßeads sits together
waiting fora conversation to start
every Sunday. Last week we read
"Going Up the Mountain Coming
Down Slowly" by Dave Eggers. It
isn't the greatest story in the world.
But when Alondraßeads con
vened to discuss the story, we tried
to make sense of the competent
mess that had arrived the previous
night. Discussing "Going Up the
Mountain Coming Down Slowly"
with others incited an immediate
interest in the work within me.
Had 1 read it alone, I would have
relegated it to the stack of "good
but not great" stories. But 1 didn't
read it alone. I read it with other
people. In that community, the
story seemed worth discussing,
rather than just leaving behind tin
my literary journeys.
I should mention that there are
two members of Alondraßeads: my
self and the resident SLE tutor,
Alyssa. It's a bit sad, and pathetic,
having a book club of two, but 1 still
stand by all my previous blathering on
the subject. 1 may not have a group as
large as the Kepler's crew, or the
amount of donuts in a box of Krispy
Kreme doughnuts, but at least I'm not
on alone on this literary journey.

Seth strongly encourages Alondra
residents to attend Alondraßeads. li
