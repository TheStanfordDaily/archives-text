# Cardinal fired up for rematch with Ducks
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Emotions will run the gamut this week
end as No. 3 Stanford (24-2, 15-1 Pacific-10
Conference) closes out its regular season
schedule against Oregon (18-7, 11-5) and
Oregon State (6-20, 1-15). Tonight, the
Cardinal will try to avenge their only con
ference loss of the season as they take on
the Ducks, who dealt them a defeat back on
Dec. 29, 2004.
On Saturday afternoon, the team and its
fans will honor one of the greatest classes in
Stanford history, as seniors Susan King
Borchardt, Sebnem Kimyacioglu, Azella
Perryman, Kelley Suminski and T'Nae
Thiel play their final game at Maples Pavil
ion.
It is fitting that these five should wrap up
their final regular season at Maples, where
they have helped Stanford compile an un
believable 75-5 record over the past four
years. In conference play, their record at
home is a spotless 35-0.
"It's an atmosphere that we're comfort
able with, and we play with confidence
here," Thiel said. "I try not to think about

[leaving Maples] too
much. It's hard to
imagine that we'll
only go through a
pre-game talk here
two more times, and
1 don't want to get
overly sentimental
before I have to."
When the Cardi
nal conclude play
this year, Kimya
cioglu, Suminski and
possibly Thiel will
have surpassed Kate
Starbird's school
record for career
games played â€” a
testament to both the
durability and talent
of a class that has
contributed from the
minute it hit the
Farm in the fall of
2001.
At one of the
country's most sto
ried basketball pro-

grams, names from this year's senior class
dot the record books in nearly every cate
gory.
When the season ends, both Thiel and
Perryman will find themselves among the
school's top 10 all-time rebounders. Sumin
ski and Kimyacioglu wilj both rank in the
top five for three-point field goals attempt
ed and made. Borchardt has garnered All-
Academic conference honors in three of
her four years of eligibility.
Through Sunday's victory over UCLA,
the class's overall record is 110-17, and the
group is within striking distance of the all
time win record of 116 set by the class of
1992.
But these seniors are about so much
more than numbers.
"The seniors set the tone for our team,"
head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"They're a very close group, and 1 hope I
can coach a good game on Saturday, be
cause I'm going to be really sad."
These five players, who were prized high
school recruits from as far west as Alaska
(Perryman) and as far east as New Jersey
(Suminski), have come together during
their four years at Stanford. Where once
they were just members of a basketball
team they are now friends who play basket
ball.
"They truly care about their team, and
they love playing with their Stanford uni
form on and for each other," VanDerveer
said. "They respect each other, they're
good friends with each other, and they have
been a fabulous class."
Perhaps that explains how four years can
go by so quickly and a group of young
women can suddenly find themselves near
ing the end of a chapter.
"I was roommates with T'Nae [last
weekend in Los Angeles] and 1 said,
'T'Nae, next week are our last two games in
Maples,"' Kimyacioglu said. "I feel like it
did sort of sneak up in a weird way. I knew
it was coming, but 1 can really feel it this
week."
This Saturday families, friends and fans
will witness the passing of the torch.
"1 would just love to have a great week
end our last weekend," Suminksi said. "I'm
just going to try not to cry."
While Saturday will likely be a day of
