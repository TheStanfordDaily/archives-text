## Kashmir is a land hungry for human rights 
### JULIA SPIEGEL 
Since the partitioning of India in
W47, Indian Kashmir has been rav
aged by conflict between Indian se
curity forces and Muslim militants
from Pakistan. After 50 years of vio
lent upheavals, which have contin
ued to escalate despite recent cease
fire negotiations, the region remains
plagued by summary executions,
rape and torture. In their effort to
curb support for pro-independence
militants. Indian security forces
have resorted to arbitrary arrest and
collective punishments of entire lo
calities. leading to further disaffec
tion from India. The militants have
kidnapped and killed civil servants
and suspected informers, reinforc
ing India's determination to elimi
nate the security threat by any
means necessary.
Despite Indian government
claims that "normalcy" has been re
stored. abuses by the army, federal
paramilitary forces and a newly con
stituted police force are rife, and re
pressive scare tactics are frequently
used. Indian forces continue to arm
and train counter-militant militia to
assassinate suspected militant ac
tivists and intimidate local residents.
Although some militant leaders

command popular support, extor
tion and other abuses by the militant
groups and their failure to prevail
against the Indian forces have left the
population caught in the crossfire. At
the same time, ongoing brutality and
repression by Indian troops contin
ues to fuel popular discontent and
fear.
Although government troops are
less brutal than in the early 1990s
when retaliatory shootings of civil
ians in crowded urban areas and vil
lages were common, targeted execu
tions continue to occur. Custodial
killings, the summary execution of
detainees, remain a central compo
nent of the Indian government's
counterinsurgency strategy and In
dian security forces have frequently
raped women during search opera
tions. particularly in remote areas
outside of major cities and towns.
While the difficulties associated
with documentation make it impos
sible to state accurately the number
of such killings, human rights
groups in the state and elsewhere in
India estimate that such summary
executions number in the thou
sands. Detentions and "disappear
ances" have left residents fearful of
talking to international human
rights organizations and little

human rights documentation has
been conducted because numerous
human rights activists and lawyers
have been killed or threatened.
Even doctors who have treated tor
ture victims have been threatened.
And India refuses to officially per
mit international human rights or
ganizations to conduct investiga
tions.
This pattern of systematic human
rights violations by all parties in
Kashmir has been a critical factor in
fueling the conflict, one that is all too
often overlooked. We, as members of
the Stanford community, should
work together to raise awareness of
these human rights violations. We
have the means to educate ourselves
and the means to educate others. We
have the ability to act upon this
knowledge as a community. But the
first step to get involved must be
yours.
