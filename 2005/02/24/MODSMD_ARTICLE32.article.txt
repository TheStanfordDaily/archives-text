## The
						Double Clutch UW's problems serve as red flag 
### 
If you've visited Seattle lately, especially the
large university north of the Montlake
bridge, you may have noticed a foul odor.
It's dogdoo. Husky doo, to be more specific.
And the UW athletic department has stepped in
it more than once.
Dismissed football coach Kick Neuheisel's
lawsuit against the University for wrongful ter
mination is the talk of the city. A perusal of Seat
tle's newspaper archives shows that the trial is
only the tip of an iceberg of ill repute, with a two
year dossier of athletic department conduct,
ranging from the shocking to the embarrassing
to the bizarre.
Let's start with Skippy, whose entire four
year tenure was marked with controversy.
When UW went looking fora coach in January,
1999, Neuheisel told the press and his boss he

wasn't interested in the job
and was staying at Colorado.
Ile was all about the black and
gold.
Apparently, more so the
gold. The very next week, IJW
fired a huge mortar in the es
calating arms race of college
football, giving Neuheisel an
astounding million-dollar
plus deal.
Before notable success, in-

eluding a Rose Bowl victory, Neuheisel's staff
incurred an endless series of minor recruiting vi
olations (in addition to a set at Colorado he was
later cited for.) Neuheisel. a law school graduate
who has passed the bar in two states, claimed ig
norance of the finer points of the rules.
In February, 2(X)3. Kick went to San Francis
co and interviewed for the open 4 l )ers job. The
next day.he issued a statement that he had not
been contacted by the franchise.
It would have stayed that way. except that a
Seattle reporter had overheard him in the air
port discussing the interview on the phone (the
proverbial blue dress, if you will). Athletic direc
tor Barbara I ledges, to whom he'd also finessed
the truth, told the press he would be on some
thing like double-secret probation.
In June of that year, the NCAA came calling
to ask about his involvement in parties with
thousand-dollar basketball pools. Neuheisel
claimed he attended only to watch, but later that
day admitted to having thrown down money
(coaches betting on collegiate sports is against
NCAA rules). He also produced a department
memo that authorized such gambling pools, a
misinterpretation of NCAA rules that eventual
ly got the school's compliance director fired.
After some hand wringing and discussion
with the NCAA. Hedges terminated Neuheisel
'for cause.' voiding his contract and denying him
lush severance pay. After the NCAA cleared
him of wrongdoing (because of the memo), he
sued the university for his buyout. NCAA rules
are notoriously controversial, and given the
Ã¼biquity of such gambling pools, many Seat
tleites took the coach's side.
