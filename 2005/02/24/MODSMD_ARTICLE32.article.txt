## The 						Double Clutch UW's problems serve as red flag 
### 
If you've visited Seattle lately, especially the
large university north of the Montlake
bridge, you may have noticed a foul odor.
It's dogdoo. Husky doo, to be more specific.
And the UW athletic department has stepped in
it more than once.
Dismissed football coach Kick Neuheisel's
lawsuit against the University for wrongful ter
mination is the talk of the city. A perusal of Seat
tle's newspaper archives shows that the trial is
only the tip of an iceberg of ill repute, with a two
year dossier of athletic department conduct,
ranging from the shocking to the embarrassing
to the bizarre.
Let's start with Skippy, whose entire four
year tenure was marked with controversy.
When UW went looking fora coach in January,
1999, Neuheisel told the press and his boss he

wasn't interested in the job
and was staying at Colorado.
Ile was all about the black and
gold.
Apparently, more so the
gold. The very next week, IJW
fired a huge mortar in the es
calating arms race of college
football, giving Neuheisel an
astounding million-dollar
plus deal.
Before notable success, in-

eluding a Rose Bowl victory, Neuheisel's staff
incurred an endless series of minor recruiting vi
olations (in addition to a set at Colorado he was
later cited for.) Neuheisel. a law school graduate
who has passed the bar in two states, claimed ig
norance of the finer points of the rules.
In February, 2(X)3. Kick went to San Francis
co and interviewed for the open 4 l )ers job. The
next day.he issued a statement that he had not
been contacted by the franchise.
It would have stayed that way. except that a
Seattle reporter had overheard him in the air
port discussing the interview on the phone (the
proverbial blue dress, if you will). Athletic direc
tor Barbara I ledges, to whom he'd also finessed
the truth, told the press he would be on some
thing like double-secret probation.
In June of that year, the NCAA came calling
to ask about his involvement in parties with
thousand-dollar basketball pools. Neuheisel
claimed he attended only to watch, but later that
day admitted to having thrown down money
(coaches betting on collegiate sports is against
NCAA rules). He also produced a department
memo that authorized such gambling pools, a
misinterpretation of NCAA rules that eventual
ly got the school's compliance director fired.
After some hand wringing and discussion
with the NCAA. Hedges terminated Neuheisel
'for cause.' voiding his contract and denying him
lush severance pay. After the NCAA cleared
him of wrongdoing (because of the memo), he
sued the university for his buyout. NCAA rules
are notoriously controversial, and given the
übiquity of such gambling pools, many Seat
tleites took the coach's side.

The department could have
avoided all of this if Hedges had sim
ply dismissed him for not being truth
ful (also known as lying) to the
NCAA investigators (which is on
tape and freely available.) Problem
is, Hedges had pretty much burned
her authority in the 49ers incident.
Hedges said later that because of
the secrecy required in luring
Neuheisel from Colorado, they
hadn't been able to do a full back
ground check. Be that as it may,
"Slick Rick's" reputation in college
football was by no means a secret,
and if she couldn't find the time to call
even a Boulder newspaper office, it
smacks of negligence if not foolish
ness.
Hedges has had a number of other
questionable moves — cutting and
then reinstating the swim program,
waiting too long to dismiss the bas
ketball coach and in general having a
relationship with her coaches that
was too much personal and not
enough professional.
Another lawsuit is in the works.
Teresa Wilson, who had built the
soltball program to a national pow
erhouse, was canned after team
physician William "Dr. Feelgood"
Scheyer was alleged to have fraudu
lently obtained narcotics and given
them without prescription to play
ers. She has filed for sex discrimina
tion, breach of contract and due
process violations.
The strange situation led Seattle
reporter Jim Moore to pen a cruel but
hilarious parody of Sammy Davis
Jr.'s "The Candy Man" song (Candy
Man was another nickname of Dr.
Scheyer).
Moore, an outspoken Washing
ton State Cougar fan. has also
taken the opportunity to propagate
a new UW nickname: "probation
nation." In all fairness, Moore has
come out a supporter of Neuheisel,
calling him "fairly maligned but un
fairly fired."
I've mentioned all of this not to
rag on Washington. Rather, 1 think it
shows the dangers inherent in the
modern gargantuan athletic depart
ment. With so many people, and so
much money, and so many egos, it
doesn't take much of a breach to let in
the tentacles of scandal and impropri
ety. You — and that means we,
sports fans — better make darn sure
the person at the top can make the
tough calls.
