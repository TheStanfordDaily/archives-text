# No. 5 Cardinal set for Pac-10s
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It has been true for years, and it is true again this year — the
Pacific-10 Conference is Stanford's playground. Since Pac-10
women's swimming and diving competition began in 1986,
when this year's team was still in diapers, the Cardinal have won
the conference title 15 times, finishing out of the top two just
once, in 2001. That squad, which finished fourth at Pac-lOs,
ended up second at nationals only a few weeks later. The post
season has been good to the Cardinal in the recent — and not
so recent — past.
That trend should continue as No. 5 Stanford heads to Fed
eral Way, Wash., this weekend for the Pac-10 Championships.
With a perfect conference record and a regular-season victory
over the other heavy favorite, No. 6 Arizona, the Cardinal look
poised to continue the tradition of excellence and bring home a
16th conference crown.
Three individual winners return from the 2004 championship
squad. Junior Dana Kirk took first in the l(X)-yard butterfly, senior
Lacey Boutwell won the 50-yard freestyle and sophomore Cas-

Stanford has taken the Pac-10 title 15 times and is the favorite heading into the postseason once again this year.
Kirk, Strug and Boutwell will defend titles

sidy Krug came out on top in one-meter
springboard diving. Tara Kirk, a senior
last year, added two victories, and Stan
ford won both the 2(X)- and 400-yard
medley relays lor a 51-point victory
over runner-up UCLA.
All three returners will seek to de
fend their titles while many other swim
mers will be trying for their first indi
vidual conference titles.
Dana Kirk has been troubled for
much of the season by back trouble
but has been swimming well recently.
Even so, "it will be tough this year."
she said.
Despite her injury, she has won the
I (X)- and 2(X)- yard butterfly a combined
II times in competition this season.
Boutwell is having another strong
season in the freestyle sprint, having
finished first in four meets this year, and
is joined by freshman Brooke Bishop,
who has won the event twice. Bishop is
also a contender in the backstroke,
where she is consistently the Cardinal's
top finisher.
Tara Kirk, who set a national
record in the 100-yard breaststroke at
last year's Pac-10 meet and then a

world record at NCAAs, left a hole in
the Stanford roster, hut freshman
Caroline Bruce has ably filled in, post
ing 21 individual victories over the
course of the season. Her times in the
1(X)- and 200-yard breaststroke and
200-yard individual medley are
among the nation's top five, so three
titles would not be out of the question
at this weekend's meet.
"This year we have amazing dis
tance swimmers and amazing freshmen
which we didn't have last year," Dana
Kirk said. "And that's just more points
on top of last year."
The long-distance freestyle races
have emerged as strengths for the Car
dinal, with freshman Elizabeth Durot
and sophomore Lauren Costella lead
ing the way in the 500-yard and 1,650-
yard distances, respectively. Each has
live individual victories already.
Krug and senior Ashlee Rosenthal
have both been diving well all year, but
they will face stiff competition at Pac
10s.
"It's been going really well," Krug
said. "All year, we've been doing some
different things, so it's been really excit

ing and really fun. I'm very excited for
Pac-lOs."
Krug will be going for her second
title in as many years, while four-time
All-American Rosenthal will seek her
first-ever Pac-10 championship.
"Cassidy and Ashlee theoretically
could have a chance to win," diving
coach Rick Schavone said. "But I still
think that [USC's] Blythe Hartley is by
far favored. [Trisha] Tomlinson is very
good from ASU, and there are a few
other girls who will give us competi
tion."
Hartley, a 2004 Olympian repre
senting Canada, dives for USC and fin
ished well ahead of Stanford's top two
when the teams met in last Fall's USC
Trojan Invitational.
"It's up to whether Ashlee and Cas
sidy step up and dive," Schavone said.
"They're ready to dive, and they have
been diving well all season, so if they
take that one step then they'll be in con
tention to be first or second or third or
fourth. I'd like both of them in the top
four. That's my goal. I'd like to see us
put one of the other three girls into the
top eight. That would be a pretty good

meet for us."
With Pac-lOs about to start and the
NCAA Championships only a few
weeks away, the Cardinal are ready to
go.
"The team is teeling really, really
good," Kirk said. "We're starting to get
to the point in the season when every
time we get in the water we're swim
ming faster. It definitely is making up
for all of the really hard workouts
throughout the season."
The Stanford team of Amy Wagn
er, Caroline Bruce, Dana Kirk and
Brooke Bishop took first place in last
night's first event, winning the 200-
yard medley relay in NCAA "A"
qualifying time. A second place finish
to Cal in the evening's other competi
tion, the 800-yard freestyle relay, left
the Cardinal with a 10-point lead at
the end of the first day. The freestyle
relay team of Elizabeth Durot, De
siree Stahley, Bruce and Boutwell fin
ished in season-best time and record
ed the Cardinal's second "A" time of
the day. Competition will continue
through Saturday, when the confer
ence champion will be crowned.

sidy Krug came out on top in one-meter
springboard diving. Tara Kirk, a senior
last year, added two victories, and Stan
ford won both the 2(X)- and 400-yard
medley relays lor a 51-point victory
over runner-up UCLA.
All three returners will seek to de
fend their titles while many other swim
mers will be trying for their first indi
vidual conference titles.

much of the season by back trouble
but has been swimming well recently.
Even so, "it will be tough this year."
she said.
Despite her injury, she has won the
I (X)- and 2(X)- yard butterfly a combined
II times in competition this season.
Boutwell is having another strong
season in the freestyle sprint, having
finished first in four meets this year, and
is joined by freshman Brooke Bishop,
who has won the event twice. Bishop is
also a contender in the backstroke,
where she is consistently the Cardinal's
top finisher.
Tara Kirk, who set a national
record in the 100-yard breaststroke at
last year's Pac-10 meet and then a

world record at NCAAs, left a hole in
the Stanford roster, hut freshman
Caroline Bruce has ably filled in, post
ing 21 individual victories over the
course of the season. Her times in the
1(X)- and 200-yard breaststroke and
200-yard individual medley are
among the nation's top five, so three
titles would not be out of the question
at this weekend's meet.
"This year we have amazing dis
tance swimmers and amazing freshmen
which we didn't have last year," Dana
Kirk said. "And that's just more points
on top of last year."
The long-distance freestyle races
have emerged as strengths for the Car
dinal, with freshman Elizabeth Durot
and sophomore Lauren Costella lead
ing the way in the 500-yard and 1,650-
yard distances, respectively. Each has
live individual victories already.
Krug and senior Ashlee Rosenthal
have both been diving well all year, but
they will face stiff competition at Pac
10s.
"It's been going really well," Krug
said. "All year, we've been doing some
different things, so it's been really excit

ing and really fun. I'm very excited for
Pac-lOs."
Krug will be going for her second
title in as many years, while four-time
All-American Rosenthal will seek her
first-ever Pac-10 championship.
"Cassidy and Ashlee theoretically
could have a chance to win," diving
coach Rick Schavone said. "But I still
think that [USC's] Blythe Hartley is by
far favored. [Trisha] Tomlinson is very
good from ASU, and there are a few
other girls who will give us competi
tion."
Hartley, a 2004 Olympian repre
senting Canada, dives for USC and fin
ished well ahead of Stanford's top two
when the teams met in last Fall's USC
Trojan Invitational.
"It's up to whether Ashlee and Cas
sidy step up and dive," Schavone said.
"They're ready to dive, and they have
been diving well all season, so if they
take that one step then they'll be in con
tention to be first or second or third or
fourth. I'd like both of them in the top
four. That's my goal. I'd like to see us
put one of the other three girls into the
top eight. That would be a pretty good

meet for us."
With Pac-lOs about to start and the
NCAA Championships only a few
weeks away, the Cardinal are ready to
go.
"The team is teeling really, really
good," Kirk said. "We're starting to get
to the point in the season when every
time we get in the water we're swim
ming faster. It definitely is making up
for all of the really hard workouts
throughout the season."
The Stanford team of Amy Wagn
er, Caroline Bruce, Dana Kirk and
Brooke Bishop took first place in last
night's first event, winning the 200-
yard medley relay in NCAA "A"
qualifying time. A second place finish
to Cal in the evening's other competi
tion, the 800-yard freestyle relay, left
the Cardinal with a 10-point lead at
the end of the first day. The freestyle
relay team of Elizabeth Durot, De
siree Stahley, Bruce and Boutwell fin
ished in season-best time and record
ed the Cardinal's second "A" time of
the day. Competition will continue
through Saturday, when the confer
ence champion will be crowned.
It has been true for years, and it is true again this year — the
Pacific-10 Conference is Stanford's playground. Since Pac-10
women's swimming and diving competition began in 1986,
when this year's team was still in diapers, the Cardinal have won
the conference title 15 times, finishing out of the top two just
once, in 2001. That squad, which finished fourth at Pac-lOs,
ended up second at nationals only a few weeks later. The post
season has been good to the Cardinal in the recent — and not
so recent — past.
That trend should continue as No. 5 Stanford heads to Fed
eral Way, Wash., this weekend for the Pac-10 Championships.
With a perfect conference record and a regular-season victory
over the other heavy favorite, No. 6 Arizona, the Cardinal look
poised to continue the tradition of excellence and bring home a
16th conference crown.
