# Water polo's perfect pair

### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Saturday, the No. 3 women's water polo
team (5-1, 2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) rolled through No. 17 Cal State-
Northridge and posted a double-digit goal total
for the third consecutive game in a dominant 13-
4 victory.
Sophomore driver Katie Hansen and junior
two-meter Nancy El-Sakkary led the way for the
Cardinal The team's co-leading scorers both
notched hat-tricks to improve their individual
season goal totals to 12 apiece.
But beyond sharing the common knack for
finding the back of the net with their shots, sim
ilarities between these two forces of the Cardi
nal's lineup might be hard to find.
As anyone who has watched the Cardinal
play this year or last will know, the manners in
which these two women rack up their goals dif
fer in just about every way possible.
Hansen earns her shots with quickness. Often
charged with converting outlet passes into
breakaways on the Stanford counterattack, she
poses an equal scoring threat on any given of
fensive sequence. It is not surprising to see her
cut to open water, receive the ball and within a
split-second fire off one of her deadly net-seek
ing perimeter shots into the corner of the goal.
El-Sakkary is the one "at set." positioned
about two meters in front of the opposing goalie
and always tightly guarded. A pass inside sets off
a fierce battle between El-Sakkary and her de
fender for possession of the ball. Lasting only a
second, it is a second that heightens the drama of
the moment in which El-Sakkary fights free of
her defender, sweeps her palm beneath the
floating ball and sends it rocketing past the out

stretched hands of the opposing goalie.
But considering the stories each one will tell
of how she came to be a member of Stanford's
water polo squad, it would be ironic il their
styles of play were any more similar.
How different could these stories be? One
needs only to look at their hometowns to get an
idea - one hails from ocean-side Coronado in
sunny Southern California, while the other, born
in Saudi Arabia, hails from Dollard des
Ormeaux, a city in the Canadian province of
Quebec.
El-Sakkary lived her first six years in a coun
try where water polo was a foreign concept. But
when her father decided to take a year-long sab
batical in Canada, El-Sakkary's life encountered
a strange twist of fate.
The family's initially temporary move to Dol
lard des Ormeaux became permanent, and El-
Sakkary found herself growing up in the hot bed
of Canadian water polo.
Home to one of the top women's club teams
in the nation, Dollard des Ormeaux fostered the
development of local talent with a number of
pools that many children, El-Sakkary included,
joined during the summer to do competitive div
ing. swimming, water polo and synchronized
swimming.
At the age of 14, El-Sakkary decided to focus
solely on water polo and soon after began prac
ticing with the Dollard des Ormeaux club team.
"1 ended up deciding on water polo in a large
part because that's what my older brother was
doing, and I loved watching him play and want
ed to copy him," El-Sakkary said.
Today, she is studying electrical engineering
and playing collegiate water polo against some
