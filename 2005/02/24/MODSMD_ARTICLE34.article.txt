# Water polo's perfect pair
## 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Saturday, the No. 3 women's water polo
team (5-1, 2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) rolled through No. 17 Cal State-
Northridge and posted a double-digit goal total
for the third consecutive game in a dominant 13-
4 victory.
Sophomore driver Katie Hansen and junior
two-meter Nancy El-Sakkary led the way for the
Cardinal The team's co-leading scorers both
notched hat-tricks to improve their individual
season goal totals to 12 apiece.
But beyond sharing the common knack for
finding the back of the net with their shots, sim
ilarities between these two forces of the Cardi
nal's lineup might be hard to find.
As anyone who has watched the Cardinal
play this year or last will know, the manners in
which these two women rack up their goals dif
fer in just about every way possible.
Hansen earns her shots with quickness. Often
charged with converting outlet passes into
breakaways on the Stanford counterattack, she
poses an equal scoring threat on any given of
fensive sequence. It is not surprising to see her
cut to open water, receive the ball and within a
split-second fire off one of her deadly net-seek
ing perimeter shots into the corner of the goal.
El-Sakkary is the one "at set." positioned
about two meters in front of the opposing goalie
and always tightly guarded. A pass inside sets off
a fierce battle between El-Sakkary and her de
fender for possession of the ball. Lasting only a
second, it is a second that heightens the drama of
the moment in which El-Sakkary fights free of
her defender, sweeps her palm beneath the
floating ball and sends it rocketing past the out

stretched hands of the opposing goalie.
But considering the stories each one will tell
of how she came to be a member of Stanford's
water polo squad, it would be ironic il their
styles of play were any more similar.
How different could these stories be? One
needs only to look at their hometowns to get an
idea - one hails from ocean-side Coronado in
sunny Southern California, while the other, born
in Saudi Arabia, hails from Dollard des
Ormeaux, a city in the Canadian province of
Quebec.
El-Sakkary lived her first six years in a coun
try where water polo was a foreign concept. But
when her father decided to take a year-long sab
batical in Canada, El-Sakkary's life encountered
a strange twist of fate.
The family's initially temporary move to Dol
lard des Ormeaux became permanent, and El-
Sakkary found herself growing up in the hot bed
of Canadian water polo.
Home to one of the top women's club teams
in the nation, Dollard des Ormeaux fostered the
development of local talent with a number of
pools that many children, El-Sakkary included,
joined during the summer to do competitive div
ing. swimming, water polo and synchronized
swimming.
At the age of 14, El-Sakkary decided to focus
solely on water polo and soon after began prac
ticing with the Dollard des Ormeaux club team.
"1 ended up deciding on water polo in a large
part because that's what my older brother was
doing, and I loved watching him play and want
ed to copy him," El-Sakkary said.
Today, she is studying electrical engineering
and playing collegiate water polo against some
of the best players in the nation as
a Stanford student-athlete.
El-Sakkary's first Stanford
water polo experience came as a
spectator. While visiting Los An
geles with her club team, she
watched Stanford defeat UCLA in
overtime to win the UC-Santa Bar
bara tournament. Despite being
enrolled at Montreal's McGill Uni
versity, El-Sakkary left the game
with a burning desire to be a part of
the talented competition she had
just witnessed.
A few months later, El-Sakkary
returned to California as a member
of the Canadian Senior National
Team, this time competing in the
Stanford-hosted Holiday Cup. El-
Sakkary was sold on Stanford after
playing in the Avery Aquatic Cen
ter for the first time. All that re
mained for her was to talk to head
coach John Tanner about a trans
fer. But that task proved to be
more difficult for El-Sakkary than
either out-positioning defenders or
burying shots from the 2-meter
mark.
"Several times during the tour
nament I saw [him] and wanted to
approach him about attending
Stanford, but I chickened out," she
said.
Upon returning home, howev
er, she worked up the nerve to e
mail Tanner, and the rest is history.
Hansen's path to Stanford,
though perhaps not as windingly
complex, is equally impressive.
Born into a family that spent
plenty of time in the pool — her
mother was a swimmer, and sev
eral of her cousins successful col
legiate water polo players —
Hansen found herself in the
water at an early age. By second
grade she began swimming com
petitively, and when she took up
water polo in seventh grade as "a
coed social thing," it soon devel
oped into a passion. She first
practiced with the high school
varsity team as an eighth grader,
and looked to its senior members
as role models.
It wasn't long before Hansen
herself became a seasoned veteran
of the same team. As a member of
one of the top high school teams in
the San Diego area, Hansen
earned team MVF honors her ju
nior and senior years and led Coro
nado to the California Inter
scholastic Federation title in 2003.
Choosing Stanford over rivals
Southern California and UCLA
for its academic offerings, she went
on to notch 24 gOals during her
freshman year.
When asked if these differences
spurred any scoring rivalries be
tween the driver and two-meter, El-
Sakkary only laughed and said, "No
rivalries. It doesn't matter who's
scoring the points as long as they
show up on the scoreboard."
