# Men's tennis seeks revenge against SC
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Nothing is sweeter than revenge,
and the No. 18 Stanford men's ten
nis team will try to prove that as it
travels to Los Angeles this week
end. The Cardinal (6-3) will attempt
to avenge last week's narrow loss at
the National Indoor Championship
when they take on No. 11 USC on
Saturday. They will also square off
against No. 4 UCLA tomorrow.
"It's going to be a great chal
lenge, and 1 look forward to seeing
how they do this weekend." head
coach John Whitlinger said. "It will
be a battle down in L A.; it's a tough
place to play. But I think our guys
are up for the challenge, and I 'm re
ally anxious to see how it's going to
turn out."
Senior Phil Sheng agreed that
the team is prepared to face the test.
"I'm feeling good, and I know
the team is definitely feeling good
too." Sheng said. "We were really
close, but we came up really unlucky
in a couple matches [at Indoors]. I
think we have a good shot this
weekend; the team definitely
doesn't want to lose five straight in a
row, and I think we're going to go
down and perform the next couple
days."
Stanford was defeated by the
Trojans in a tight 4-3 loss last Satur
day at the tournament in Chicago,
their third consecutive loss of the
weekend and of the season. The
match got off to a slow start as the
Cardinal gave up two of the three
doubles matches; the No. 2 doubles
position had multiple chances to
clinch the doubles point but were
not able to convert.
"Eric [McKean] and I had a cou
ple match-points, but we just got re

ally unlucky." Sheng said. "But I'm
really confident, and I feel like if we
play them again, we're not going to
lose that doubles point."
As the singles matches got un
derway. Stanford's top two players.
No. 6 senior Sam Warburg and No.
31 junior KC Corkery, both tallied
straight set wins over ranked oppo
nents. Warburg registered a 7-6.6-3
win over No. 50 Jamir Al-Agba and
Corkery dispatched No. 51 Drew
Hoskins to remain undefeated this
season in singles action. The Cardi
nal's only other singles win was by
sophomore James Wan at the
fourth singles position. Wan was
dominant in his match, defeating
Brian Wright and only giving up one
game.
Unfortunately, the Trojans re
sponded to the Cardinal's challenge
with three singles victories of their
own. Ranked No. 97 at the time,
Johan Berg edged out Sheng 7-6, 6-
4. and junior Jon Wong also fell in
straight sets at the final singles spot.
On Tuesday, Sheng earned his first
ITA ranking of the season, entering
at No. 93.
With the score tied at 3-3, the de
ciding match came down to fresh
man Phil Kao for the second day in
a row. Just the previous day, Kao's
three-setter was the deciding match
against No. 20 Oklahoma State.
Once again. Kao barely missed the
win, losing 6-4 in the third set.
Kao commented on being put in
such a high-pressure setting twice in
one weekend.
"I actually liked being put into
that situation," he said. "Every
one's eyes are on you, watching
every move you make. It's an ex
perience that I know will happen
