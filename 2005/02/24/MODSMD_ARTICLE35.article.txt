# Men's tennis seeks revenge against SC
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Nothing is sweeter than revenge,
and the No. 18 Stanford men's ten
nis team will try to prove that as it
travels to Los Angeles this week
end. The Cardinal (6-3) will attempt
to avenge last week's narrow loss at
the National Indoor Championship
when they take on No. 11 USC on
Saturday. They will also square off
against No. 4 UCLA tomorrow.
"It's going to be a great chal
lenge, and 1 look forward to seeing
how they do this weekend." head
coach John Whitlinger said. "It will
be a battle down in L A.; it's a tough
place to play. But I think our guys
are up for the challenge, and I 'm re
ally anxious to see how it's going to
turn out."
Senior Phil Sheng agreed that
the team is prepared to face the test.
"I'm feeling good, and I know
the team is definitely feeling good
too." Sheng said. "We were really
close, but we came up really unlucky
in a couple matches [at Indoors]. I
think we have a good shot this
weekend; the team definitely
doesn't want to lose five straight in a
row, and I think we're going to go
down and perform the next couple
days."
Stanford was defeated by the
Trojans in a tight 4-3 loss last Satur
day at the tournament in Chicago,
their third consecutive loss of the
weekend and of the season. The
match got off to a slow start as the
Cardinal gave up two of the three
doubles matches; the No. 2 doubles
position had multiple chances to
clinch the doubles point but were
not able to convert.
"Eric [McKean] and I had a cou
ple match-points, but we just got re

ally unlucky." Sheng said. "But I'm
really confident, and I feel like if we
play them again, we're not going to
lose that doubles point."
As the singles matches got un
derway. Stanford's top two players.
No. 6 senior Sam Warburg and No.
31 junior KC Corkery, both tallied
straight set wins over ranked oppo
nents. Warburg registered a 7-6.6-3
win over No. 50 Jamir Al-Agba and
Corkery dispatched No. 51 Drew
Hoskins to remain undefeated this
season in singles action. The Cardi
nal's only other singles win was by
sophomore James Wan at the
fourth singles position. Wan was
dominant in his match, defeating
Brian Wright and only giving up one
game.
Unfortunately, the Trojans re
sponded to the Cardinal's challenge
with three singles victories of their
own. Ranked No. 97 at the time,
Johan Berg edged out Sheng 7-6, 6-
4. and junior Jon Wong also fell in
straight sets at the final singles spot.
On Tuesday, Sheng earned his first
ITA ranking of the season, entering
at No. 93.
With the score tied at 3-3, the de
ciding match came down to fresh
man Phil Kao for the second day in
a row. Just the previous day, Kao's
three-setter was the deciding match
against No. 20 Oklahoma State.
Once again. Kao barely missed the
win, losing 6-4 in the third set.
Kao commented on being put in
such a high-pressure setting twice in
one weekend.
"I actually liked being put into
that situation," he said. "Every
one's eyes are on you, watching
every move you make. It's an ex
perience that I know will happen

Senior Sam Warburg and Junior KC Corkery were two of just three singles
players to defeat the Trojans last Saturday. Stanford faces USC this weekend.
many more times this season, so I
need to get used to it.
"We are all pretty disappointed
with our performance in Chicago,"
Kao added. "However, we aren't
going to let that keep our heads
down. There is still plenty of the sea
son left, and as we head down to
L.A.to play against UCLA and
USC, it's going to he a good chance
for us to show that we are a better
team."
In 2(K)4, the Cardinal faced the Tro
jans twice, suffering a 4-3 loss in the

first meeting before bouncing back
with a 5-2 win in the second meeting.
While Stanford lost both of its match
es to IJCLA last season, the Cardinal
scored three points in the second
meeting two weeks after scoring only
two in their first loss to the Bruins.
While UCLA dropped in this
week's ITA rankings from No. 2 to
4. the Bruins still boast a 10-1 record
this season and five ranked players,
including No. 10 Benjamin Kohllo
efie 1 and No. 12 Luben Pampoulov.
Last week in Chicago, UCLA tallied
a 4-1 win over No. 7 Florida.
"They are very good."
Whitlinger said of the Bruins.
"There's no question. They have a
lot of talent. We're just going to go
down there and fight like heck and

see what happens. One thing 1 like
about 11he team] is they're com
peting well and battling hard, and
that's all 1 can ask of them. We're
going to go down there and give it
our best shot."
The Cardinal said that the oppor
tunity to play the Trojans in Chicago
was probably a good warmup for
this weekend.
"It was advantageous to play
against USC, because I got to see a
lot of |my opponent's] game and was
able to see some of his weaknesses,"
Kao said. "Our team should also
have an edge against USC, because
none of us want to lose to them
again."
It will also be interesting to note
how the team, particularly the

newer members, handles playing
away from home in the unpleasant,
away-niatch atmosphere of SoCal.
Warburg, Corkery, Sheng and Wan
have all played in L.A. before but
this weekend will be the rest of the
team's first time competing in front
of the tough UCLA and USC
crowds.
"I think it's important to see how
well we compete down at No. 5 and
6 â€” at the lower part of our lineup."
Whitlinger said. "The more they
play matches like UCLA and USC,
the better they're going to be. 1 want
to see how they've taken what hap
pened in Chicago and see how they
play, how they react to playing in a
hostile environment down in L.A.;
it's a tough place to play."
