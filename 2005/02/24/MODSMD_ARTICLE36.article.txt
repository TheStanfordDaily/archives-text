# Track teams head to MPSFs
## Cardinal send 54 to Seattle 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the indoor track and field
season is set to come to a close in a
few weeks, no one on the Stanford
team appears teary eyed. That's
probably because the post-season
championships kick-off this week
end. and all of the top Cardinal
competitors that were expected to
qualify for the meet will be there.
Starting today, the men's and
women's teams will each take 27
athletes to Seattle to compete in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Championships. Stanford, howev
er, looks calm as it approaches the
low-intensity competition.
"The meet is pretty low key,"
head women's coach Edrick Flo
real said. "They keep the meet at
a decent level."
The focus at the meet won't
specifically be on individuals. In
stead, the goal will be to rack up
points as a team, as every school
in the MPSF will compete for the
team title.
"Some people who qualified
won't be going because their per
formances won't score," Floreal
said.
Nevertheless, this event is one
of the last chances for athletes to
qualify for the NCAAs â€” the
main goal of the indoor track sea
son for most collegiate track ath

letes.
Coaches are hoping the compe
tition this weekend will bring out
more NCAA qualifying marks,
which is more likely in sprint
events than distance events.
"We'll be doing most of the
work ourselves in the distance
events," Floreal said. "The sprints
are a one-shot deal, but it is al
ways easier when someone's in
front of you."
"With the 4(X) and the 4x400
relay it is not going to be easy [for
our runners] to run quite as fast as
they've been running," Floreal
added.
One runner who is still looking
forward to qualifying for the
NCAAs is Wopamo Osaisai. the
freshman sprinter who has bro
ken the school record in the 60-
meter dash, but has yet to qualify
for nationals.
Last weekend Osaisai broke
the school record of 6.88 seconds,
a record set two years ago by Mil
ton Little. Osaisai ran the 60 in
6.87 seconds.
"I was a lot more confident
compared to the other races I've
done this year," Osaisai said. "I
had a good week of practice so I
ran a better overall race."
The record-breaking mark was
a confidence boost for Osaisai,
