# Track teams head to MPSFs
## Cardinal send 54 to Seattle 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While the indoor track and field
season is set to come to a close in a
few weeks, no one on the Stanford
team appears teary eyed. That's
probably because the post-season
championships kick-off this week
end. and all of the top Cardinal
competitors that were expected to
qualify for the meet will be there.
Starting today, the men's and
women's teams will each take 27
athletes to Seattle to compete in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Championships. Stanford, howev
er, looks calm as it approaches the
low-intensity competition.
"The meet is pretty low key,"
head women's coach Edrick Flo
real said. "They keep the meet at
a decent level."
The focus at the meet won't
specifically be on individuals. In
stead, the goal will be to rack up
points as a team, as every school
in the MPSF will compete for the
team title.
"Some people who qualified
won't be going because their per
formances won't score," Floreal
said.
Nevertheless, this event is one
of the last chances for athletes to
qualify for the NCAAs â€” the
main goal of the indoor track sea
son for most collegiate track ath

letes.
Coaches are hoping the compe
tition this weekend will bring out
more NCAA qualifying marks,
which is more likely in sprint
events than distance events.
"We'll be doing most of the
work ourselves in the distance
events," Floreal said. "The sprints
are a one-shot deal, but it is al
ways easier when someone's in
front of you."
"With the 4(X) and the 4x400
relay it is not going to be easy [for
our runners] to run quite as fast as
they've been running," Floreal
added.
One runner who is still looking
forward to qualifying for the
NCAAs is Wopamo Osaisai. the
freshman sprinter who has bro
ken the school record in the 60-
meter dash, but has yet to qualify
for nationals.
Last weekend Osaisai broke
the school record of 6.88 seconds,
a record set two years ago by Mil
ton Little. Osaisai ran the 60 in
6.87 seconds.
"I was a lot more confident
compared to the other races I've
done this year," Osaisai said. "I
had a good week of practice so I
ran a better overall race."
The record-breaking mark was
a confidence boost for Osaisai,

who has been adjusting to the chal
lenges of collegiate track.
"The stuff I was running in high
school, here you have to run it a lot
faster, everybody's faster here," Os
aisai said. "With the practices it's
not so much that it's harder; track is
always hard, but there is a higher in
tensity."
Even though Osaisai finished
third in the 200 meters at the 2004
California state meet with a time of
21.17, he had reservations about
calling himself one of the best on his
high school team.
"My teammates used to beat me
all the time in practice and meets in
high school; that's not what has
changed," Osaisai said. "But here
you're practicing with people who are
willing to practice harder to get bet
ter."
Daily practice is intense for Stan
ford's athletes. As the 400-meter
runners did repeat 400's, the shorter
distance sprinters did speed and
form drills, repeating them until
Floreal, who specializes as the
sprint and jump coach, was pleased.
Osaisai fits right in with the older
and more experienced runners,
both in practice and in terms of his
goals.
"For indoors I would like to
compete in the Indoor National
Championship in the 60, the 200, or
the 4x400," Osaisai said.
Osaisai said he prefers to qualify
in individual races because on a
relay he feels he is just one of four
men who win the race.
"When you compete individually in
national championships you really
feel like you're the best in the na
tion," Osaisai said.
He thinks ahead to outdoor track
as well, where he has similar goals.
"In outdoor track I want to get to
the national championships and
place," Osaisai said. "I want to get
to finals in my individual events.
That way I can go to Junior Nation
als and represent the U.S. in the
PanAms."
That makes this weekend an im
portant meet for Osaisai and the
other track and field athletes who
have yet to qualify for the Indoor
nationals.
Prospects are looking up. though,
especially for the women's team.
"So far this year we have the most
women qualifiers for the NCAAs ever
in school history, in indoor and out
door track," Floreal said. "A few more
could also still be added to that list."
The list includes sophomore
sprinter Janice Davis and the rest of
the women's distance medley relay
(DMR) and 4x400-meter relay
teams. Joining Davis in the 4x400
relay team that earned a provisional
NCAA mark are sophomores Ash
ley Freeman and Ashley Purnell
and senior Christine Moschella.
Freshman jumper Erica McLain
has an automatic qualifying mark in
the triple jump, and junior distance
runners Alicia Craig and Anita Sir
aki hold automatic marks in the
5,000-meter run. Other distance
runners who hold provisional times
are senior Jeane Goff in the 5,000
and Siraki, Goff, and sophomore
Katy Trotter in the 3,000 meters.
Sophomore Arianna Lambie and
freshman Lauren Centrowitz may
also compete on the DMR team. The
women boast a diverse group of na
tionally ranked athletes.
