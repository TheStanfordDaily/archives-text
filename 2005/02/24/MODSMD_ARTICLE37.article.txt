# Sender and Harper thrive in first year
## 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At the age of three, two rambunc
tious little boys were enrolled in recre
ational gymnastics classes in two very
different parts of the country. More
than a decade later, freshmen David
Sender and Chris Harper have be
come an inseparable, dynamic duo.
Sender's parents signed him up
after they caught him walking down a
stair banister. While mens gymnasts
do not perform a beam routine, the
Illinois native has been training ever
since.
"Little did I know what I was getting
myself into," Sender said.
Harper, who lives in Texas, began
his gymnastics career at a recreational
gym called Rippers.
The two have developed a trade
mark stream of endless sarcastic banter
about every topic possible, from gym
nastics to gym gossip.
But both Sender and Harper were
uncharacteristically quiet about their
future plans in gymnastics. Sender is
looking toward the Olympics in four
years on the condition that everything
goes well. Harper is only considering
going to the Olympics if an Olympic
team is looking fora pommel-horse spe
cialist.
Neither is limiting his future plans to
gymnastics, however. Sender's love for
animals has led him to brave the fresh
man-year chemistry classes toward a ca
reer as a veterinarian. He even brought
his pet fish to school, trusting his room
mate to feed it while he goes to compe
titions.
"1 am not so good with the human
patients," Sender joked.
Although Harper is not as definitive
about his future plans, he thinks that he
wants to go into psychology, working ei
ther with athletes or with kids, but he
also loves history.
"He wants to be a historical psychol
ogist," Sender quipped.
Harper's specialty is the pommel

horse, which he performed well on at
No. 19 Air Force last weekend. He
scored a 9.50 with a hit routine and took
home first place on the event.
Stanford will take on No. 5 Michigan
on Saturday and the Cardinal are glad
they won't have to face off against
Sender, who was thinking about be
coming a Wolverine before deciding to
come to the Farm instead.
"I am glad that 1 didn't go [to Michi
gan] because gymnastically I am way
better off here," Sender said.
Sender did not compete on rings this
weekend because of an injured elbow,
but he did compete on vault where he
took first place with a 9.55. He is cur
rently ranked second on vault national
ly-
Coming off their strong showing
against the Falcons, a meet that provid
ed a boost to the team's confidence after
tough losses to Ohio State and Cal, the
Cardinal said they hope to have a repeat
performance against the Wolverines.
"I think we are starting to pick up
some momentum," Harper said. "I ex
pect us to have a strong showing."
The team has struggled this season
with learning how to approach gymnas
tics as a team instead of an individual
sport.
Both Sender and Harper said that
the adjustment has been tough after so
many years competing as individuals.
"There is a delicate balance between
the individual and the team in college,"
Sender said.
But they both agree that the most
important championship that they can
win is the team championship.
The Cardinal are anticipating the
meet against the Wolverines, especially
after last weekend's win.
"It is going to be difficult," said
Harper, "but it is also going to be fun be
cause they hate losing at home so it
would be really cool to hand them a loss
at home."
The Cardinal will face the Wolver
ines in Ann Arbor this Saturday at 1
p.m.

But both Sender and Harper were
uncharacteristically quiet about their
future plans in gymnastics. Sender is
looking toward the Olympics in four
years on the condition that everything
goes well. Harper is only considering
going to the Olympics if an Olympic
team is looking fora pommel-horse spe
cialist.
Neither is limiting his future plans to
gymnastics, however. Sender's love for
animals has led him to brave the fresh
man-year chemistry classes toward a ca
reer as a veterinarian. He even brought
his pet fish to school, trusting his room
mate to feed it while he goes to compe
titions.
"1 am not so good with the human
patients," Sender joked.
Although Harper is not as definitive
about his future plans, he thinks that he
wants to go into psychology, working ei
ther with athletes or with kids, but he
also loves history.
"He wants to be a historical psychol
ogist," Sender quipped.
Harper's specialty is the pommel

horse, which he performed well on at
No. 19 Air Force last weekend. He
scored a 9.50 with a hit routine and took
home first place on the event.
Stanford will take on No. 5 Michigan
on Saturday and the Cardinal are glad
they won't have to face off against
Sender, who was thinking about be
coming a Wolverine before deciding to
come to the Farm instead.
"I am glad that 1 didn't go [to Michi
gan] because gymnastically I am way
better off here," Sender said.
Sender did not compete on rings this
weekend because of an injured elbow,
but he did compete on vault where he
took first place with a 9.55. He is cur
rently ranked second on vault national
ly-
Coming off their strong showing
against the Falcons, a meet that provid
ed a boost to the team's confidence after
tough losses to Ohio State and Cal, the
Cardinal said they hope to have a repeat
performance against the Wolverines.
"I think we are starting to pick up
some momentum," Harper said. "I ex
pect us to have a strong showing."
The team has struggled this season
with learning how to approach gymnas
tics as a team instead of an individual
sport.
Both Sender and Harper said that
the adjustment has been tough after so
many years competing as individuals.
"There is a delicate balance between
the individual and the team in college,"
Sender said.
But they both agree that the most
important championship that they can
win is the team championship.
The Cardinal are anticipating the
meet against the Wolverines, especially
after last weekend's win.
"It is going to be difficult," said
Harper, "but it is also going to be fun be
cause they hate losing at home so it
would be really cool to hand them a loss
at home."
The Cardinal will face the Wolver
ines in Ann Arbor this Saturday at 1
p.m.

On the rings for Stanford against No. 5 Michigan will be sophomore Peter Derman. Derman's freshman team
mate, David Sender, almost became part of the Wolverine's tough team before he picked Stanford over Ann Arbor.
