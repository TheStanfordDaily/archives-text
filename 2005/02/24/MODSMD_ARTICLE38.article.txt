## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 UCLA women's golf team has come
out of the long winter break swinging. After finish
ing second at the Northrop Grumman Regional
Challenge two weeks ago, the Bruins claimed their
first victory of the spring at the Wildcat Invitation
al Tuesday in Tucson, Ariz., edging tournament
host Arizona by a single stroke. No. 19 Stanford fin
ished seventh out of 14 teams in its second tourna
ment of the spring season.
The two-day, 54-hole event took place at the
par-71 6,238 Arizona National Golf Course, which
also serves as the home venue for Arizona.
From the outset of the tournament, the favorites
took control of the leader board. With an opening
round three-over-par 287, the defending NCAA
champion Bruins took an early two-stroke lead
over the Wildcats. In Monday's afternoon round,
UCLA shot 286 but was unable to shake a talented
Arizona team on its home turf, as the Wildcats du
plicated their morning 289 to trail by just five shots
heading into Tuesday's final round.
With a final-round 287, Arizona tried to make a
run at the title, but its total of 865 fell one shot short
of UCLA (864). After an incredible seven-under
par 64 in her opening round, Arizona State's Louise
Stahle (209) struggled in her following rounds but
held off UCLA's Charlotte Mayorkas (210) by a
single stroke for the individual crown.
Meanwhile, Stanford stumbled a bit out of the
gate, carding a 19-over-par 303 in its first 18 holes,
continuing a trend that has haunted the Cardinal all
year. The first round has been Stanford's worst in
all but one event. The team has been an average of
five strokes worse in the first round than in the sec
ond.
Characteristically, the Cardinal bounced back in
the afternoon, shooting 293 and headed to the club
house in sixth place, just three strokes back of fifth
place Oklahoma State.

"We're close [to winning a tournament as a
team] in terms of having the skills and the mental
attitude that we need," senior Wendra Liang said.
"Now it's a matter of converting those into
birdies."
With rounds of 76 and 71 on Monday, junior
Kelly Husted continued her solid play. She entered
Tuesday's final round in a tie for 15th place indi
vidually.
Just two shots behind their teammate, sopho
mores Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana (78-71) and
Lauren Todd (75-74) sat in a tie for 20th place at the
end of one day.
Liang fired a team-best 74 over her first 18 holes
but slipped in the second round, shooting 77. Her
nine-over-par total of 151 was good for 30th place
overall.
Sophomore Jenna Seki rounded out Stanford's
first-day scoring, shooting 80-81 to tie for 59th.
Though they sat in good position after the
event's first 36 holes, the Cardinal were unable to
make a move on the second day. Their 15-over-par
299 dropped them one spot to seventh place.
"I have played with some of the girls at UCLA,
especially [Mayorkas], and their short games are al
most flawless," Todd said. "The best teams had
quite a few more birdies than we did, and 1 would
guess that we had a similar number of birdie op
portunities, but did not capitalize."
Husted faltered a bit with a final-round 76, but
still managed to collect her fifth consecutive top-25
finish, as she settled into a tie for 20th place indi
vidually.
Todd and Tangtiphaiboontana were right
alongside their teammate, shooting matching 74's
on Tuesday and tying for 20th place as well.
Liang held steady as well, carding a 75 in her
final 18 holes to remain in 30th place overall. With
a closing 87, Seki slid back to 68th.
Stanford will get a month off before hitting the
course again at the Ping ASU Invite in Tempe,
Ariz. Apr. 1 to 3.
