# Groups get grants for Community Day
## 
### KILLEEN HANSON 
With an unprecedented 26 student groups re
ceiving grants to participate in this year's Com
munity Day, the campus-wide open-house will
offer attendees a wider variety of activities com
pared to those of past years.
The event, attended by 10,000 people last
year, will also mark the annual Founders' Day
celebration and will showcase various "music,
arts and athletic events as well as faculty lec
tures and a health fair," according to the Web
site.
Stanford has awarded more than $1,000
grants to student groups who want to participate
in the day's activities. The grants were awarded
by the Office of the President and the Provost
and are meant to assist the groups in their prepa
ration for the festivities.
The first Community Day, held four years
ago, included 13 student groups. Nineteen
grants were given grants last year.
Event Coordinator Ryan Foley said that the
spike in the number of grants demonstrates the
importance of student groups to the success of
Community Day.

"This is a chance for Stanford to conncct with
the outside communities," said Stanford Taiko
member Rudy Rubio, a freshman.
The day has evolved into a family event with
activities for both children and parents. In the
past, El Ballet Folklorico de Stanford offered
workshops and exhibitions and the Thai Ameri
can Intercultural Society helped children create
woven fish out of ribbons.
The grants have been offered since the first
Community Day and are designed to encourage
student involvement and interaction with those
outside of the campus. The grants are supposed
to cover the expenses of the groups' planned ac
tivities, but any money left over is given to the
group to help pay for events later in the year,
Rubio said.
To qualify fora grant, student groups must
submit an application to Foley in the Office of
University Communications, who then deter
mines who receives the grants.
Foley stressed that student groups are what
truly make Community Day a success.
"The students who have participated in Com
munity Day have been key to making it a great
event and we're very grateful to them," he said.

"The surveys we've conducted over the past
three years indicate that parents especially ap
preciate the opportunity for their kids to interact
with Stanford students."
