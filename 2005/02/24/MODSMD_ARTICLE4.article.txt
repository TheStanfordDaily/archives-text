# Stanford's Mr. Versatility
## Robinson fills multiple roles 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Stanford head coach Trent Johnson often uses the
word "underappreciated" to describe senior swing
man Nick Robinson.
"People don't realize it, but Nick is the glue of this
team," Johnson said.
Robinson's versatility has held the Cardinal start
ing five together. He began the season as a small for
ward but has subbed at power forward when junior
Matt Haryasz got into foul trouble and recently be
came the team's shooting guard when junior Dan
Grunfeld went down.
But for Robinson, juggling three positions is noth
ing compared to the balancing act he performs off
the court — attending classes, raising a family and
trying to get Stanford to the NCAA tournament.
While the team prepares for its final series of the sea
son, Robinson and his wife, Meagan, will be cele
brating the first birthday of their daughter, Annie
Lee, on Tuesday.
"1 have to give most of the credit to Meagan, be
cause she does the majority of the work when it
comes to Annie," Robinson said. "I help out where
and when 1 can, but Meagan does a fantastic job with
Annie. This quarter 1 have a great class schedule,
which allows me to be home with Meagan and Annie
during the mornings on most days. We do the best we
can to manage our time wisely."
Annie's birth may have widened Robinson's per
spective beyond basketball, but perspective is some
thing he has never lacked. After signing a letter of in
tent to come to the Farm in 1997, Robinson went on
a Mormon mission in Alagoas and Sergipe, adjacent
states in northeastern Brazil. He returned to Stan-

ford in 2000 and redshirted for the
2000-01 season, having had little
opportunity to play basketball in
Brazil.
Instead, Robinson kept in shape
by playing soccer once a week and
walking everywhere. He did get a
chance to play against the Alagoas
state team and still has his No. 21
jersey from that game, a 69-63 loss.
"Being in Brazil for two years
was a great experience," Robinson
said. "I learned how important it is
to work hard, help other people and
follow through on my commit
ments. 1 really enjoyed learning
about another culture - and I loved
the people I served."
Robinson considered himself
lucky when he got the opportunity
to play basketball once a week dur
ing the last six months of his time in
Brazil. After all, he wasn't on a mis
sion to play basketball.
Robinson said sacrificing two
years of a budding hoops career and
making adjustments to his game,
filling in wherever the team needs
him, pale in comparison.
"I have no problem going from
one position to the next," Robinson
said. "It doesn't matter so much
which position I play, I just want to
help the team win, and I'm willing
to play wherever to accomplish that
goal."
Johnson has stressed the impor
tance of defense and rebounding
since the team lost Grunfeld's 18
points per game, and Robinson has
set an example in both categories.
He leads the team with 38 steals and
averages 4.4 boards per game.

"During the game he reminds
you to keep Ding' up," said sopho
more small forward Fred Washing
ton. "When UCLA went on a run
[on Sunday], he just told us to keep
playing hard 'D'."
Robinson averages 7.9 points
per game, but his shooting has
taken a hit, down 10 percentage
points from his 46 percent mark last
year. It could be that he has been
more concerned with getting his
teammates involved than with look
ing for his own shot.
But he made four of six shots
during the Cardinal's- 78-65-win
over UCLA, scoring li points and
dishing out three assists. Robinson
opened the second half with a steal
and a dunk on the fastbreak, but
most of his contributions are more
subtle.
"He is really valuable," Johnson
said. "He understands how to make
guys better. He understands the nu
ances of the game."
Robinson would be justified in
driving and looking for his own
shots more often, considering his
athletic prowess, but he often pass
es up shots for his teammates. His
most sizeable contribution, as John
son pointed out, is in his ability to
hold everyone else together.
When asked about his goals for
this year, Robinson seems to deflect
the question.
"The team's goal is to make it to
the NCAA Tournament by playing
well one
game at a time," he said.
But when you are starting a fam
ily, maybe you just learn to think in
terms of team.
"Being a husband and father
gives me even more motivation to
do well," Robinson said. "I love it
when Annie claps when we ask her
if she enjoyed the game."

ford in 2000 and redshirted for the
2000-01 season, having had little
opportunity to play basketball in
Brazil.
Instead, Robinson kept in shape
by playing soccer once a week and
walking everywhere. He did get a
chance to play against the Alagoas
state team and still has his No. 21
jersey from that game, a 69-63 loss.
"Being in Brazil for two years
was a great experience," Robinson
said. "I learned how important it is
to work hard, help other people and
follow through on my commit
ments. 1 really enjoyed learning
about another culture - and I loved
the people I served."
Robinson considered himself
lucky when he got the opportunity
to play basketball once a week dur
ing the last six months of his time in
Brazil. After all, he wasn't on a mis
sion to play basketball.
Robinson said sacrificing two
years of a budding hoops career and
making adjustments to his game,
filling in wherever the team needs
him, pale in comparison.
"I have no problem going from
one position to the next," Robinson
said. "It doesn't matter so much
which position I play, I just want to
help the team win, and I'm willing
to play wherever to accomplish that
goal."
Johnson has stressed the impor
tance of defense and rebounding
since the team lost Grunfeld's 18
points per game, and Robinson has
set an example in both categories.
He leads the team with 38 steals and
averages 4.4 boards per game.

"During the game he reminds
you to keep Ding' up," said sopho
more small forward Fred Washing
ton. "When UCLA went on a run
[on Sunday], he just told us to keep
playing hard 'D'."
Robinson averages 7.9 points
per game, but his shooting has
taken a hit, down 10 percentage
points from his 46 percent mark last
year. It could be that he has been
more concerned with getting his
teammates involved than with look
ing for his own shot.
But he made four of six shots
during the Cardinal's- 78-65-win
over UCLA, scoring li points and
dishing out three assists. Robinson
opened the second half with a steal
and a dunk on the fastbreak, but
most of his contributions are more
subtle.
"He is really valuable," Johnson
said. "He understands how to make
guys better. He understands the nu
ances of the game."
Robinson would be justified in
driving and looking for his own
shots more often, considering his
athletic prowess, but he often pass
es up shots for his teammates. His
most sizeable contribution, as John
son pointed out, is in his ability to
hold everyone else together.
When asked about his goals for
this year, Robinson seems to deflect
the question.
"The team's goal is to make it to
the NCAA Tournament by playing
well one
game at a time," he said.
But when you are starting a fam
ily, maybe you just learn to think in
terms of team.
"Being a husband and father
gives me even more motivation to
do well," Robinson said. "I love it
when Annie claps when we ask her
if she enjoyed the game."
Stanford head coach Trent Johnson often uses the
word "underappreciated" to describe senior swing
man Nick Robinson.
"People don't realize it, but Nick is the glue of this
team," Johnson said.
Robinson's versatility has held the Cardinal start
ing five together. He began the season as a small for
ward but has subbed at power forward when junior
Matt Haryasz got into foul trouble and recently be
came the team's shooting guard when junior Dan
Grunfeld went down.
But for Robinson, juggling three positions is noth
ing compared to the balancing act he performs off
the court — attending classes, raising a family and
trying to get Stanford to the NCAA tournament.
While the team prepares for its final series of the sea
son, Robinson and his wife, Meagan, will be cele
brating the first birthday of their daughter, Annie
Lee, on Tuesday.
"1 have to give most of the credit to Meagan, be
cause she does the majority of the work when it
comes to Annie," Robinson said. "I help out where
and when 1 can, but Meagan does a fantastic job with
Annie. This quarter 1 have a great class schedule,
which allows me to be home with Meagan and Annie
during the mornings on most days. We do the best we
can to manage our time wisely."
Annie's birth may have widened Robinson's per
spective beyond basketball, but perspective is some
thing he has never lacked. After signing a letter of in
tent to come to the Farm in 1997, Robinson went on
a Mormon mission in Alagoas and Sergipe, adjacent
states in northeastern Brazil. He returned to Stan-
