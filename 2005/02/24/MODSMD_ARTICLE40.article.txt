## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students expressed mixed emotions fol
lowing the recent selection of I loward Dean, former
Vermont governor and presidential candidate, as
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, or
DNC
Dean, once a promising Democratic candidate
for the 2(KM elections until a poor outing in the lowa
primaries, emerged as the leader of the DNC after six
other candidates [Hilled out of the running.
Dean took the helm of the DNC last Saturday,
Feb. 12, vowing to begin the "re-emergence of the
Democratic Party."
Several students around campus were cautiously
optimistic about Dean's resurgence as a leader of the
Democrats.
Sophomore Marie Jonas, president of the Stan
ford Democrats, expressed some doubts that Dean
could assume the role of a party unifier.
"He has so many supporters of his own. it's im
portant that he channels energy behind the party as a
whole," she said.
Jonas criticized Dean's delayed support for other
I)eni()crats after lie tinipped out of the 2( K)4 race and
questioned his "less than appropriate" comments
about Republicans that were replayed on Fox News.
"Being loud is important," she said. "1 just wish

that he'd watch what he said."
Still, Jonas said she remains hopeful that Dean
will reinvigorate the party after its defeat in last year's
presidential election.
"He has a lot of potential to get people behind the
party and exited about the party," she said, noting
Dean's renowned success in raising money and uti
lizing the internet to rally supporters.
"We have to win elections," she said. "That's what
we have to do to win the party back."
Dean's success in grassroots mobilization is what
has Democrats like Ben Elberger excited.
" The basic idea of giving the power back to the
people but making sure they have enough resources
is a veiy powerful idea." Elberger, a junior, said. "He
will inspire people, raise money and build organiza
tions for the grassroots at local, state and national lev
els to give the party what it needs at this point."
Elberger admitted that Dean is a controversial
figure but stressed that controversy is not always a
bad thing fora DNC chair.
"His role is very different now than as a presiden
tial candidate," he said. "It is sometimes important
for the DNC chair to say something controversial to
inspire the base of the party."
Elberger denied that Dean was too liberal to rep
resent the Democrats as whole.
"He's very much a moderate," he said, pointing to
Dean's success in providing health care benefits

while maintaining a balanced budget during his 11
years as governor of Vermont.
"He falls right in the mainstream of the Demo
cratic Party and America,"he said.
Republicans around campus saw Deans rise as a
mixed blessing for their rivals.
"I actually like Howard Dean." said senior Joe
Fairbanks, former leader of the College Republi
cans. "I think Dean has the ability to do a great job as
chairman and we Republicans would be foolish to
dismiss him from the start."
Fairbanks agreed with Jonas that several of
Dean's weaknesses might haunt the Democrats dur
ing his reign.
"The only thing most people remember of Dean
in the primary is his insane scream." he said. "If the
Republicans can keep that persona of Dean at the
forefront and show that to be the face of the party, it's
going to hurt the Democrats and Dean a lot."
Fairbanks also said that Dean "has a penchant for
saying things that win him no friends on either side of
the political spectrum."
However, he said that despite being "arrogant"
with "a gigantic ego," Dean "is a very intelligent
person, so that would lead me to believe that he
would try to take the party back to the mainstream
and make them competitive again. We'll have to
give him a few months to see what kind of leader he
truly is."

Dean's success in grassroots mobilization is what
has Democrats like Ben Elberger excited.
" The basic idea of giving the power back to the
people but making sure they have enough resources
is a veiy powerful idea." Elberger, a junior, said. "He
will inspire people, raise money and build organiza
tions for the grassroots at local, state and national lev
els to give the party what it needs at this point."
Elberger admitted that Dean is a controversial
figure but stressed that controversy is not always a
bad thing fora DNC chair.
"His role is very different now than as a presiden
tial candidate," he said. "It is sometimes important
for the DNC chair to say something controversial to
inspire the base of the party."
Elberger denied that Dean was too liberal to rep
resent the Democrats as whole.
"He's very much a moderate," he said, pointing to
Dean's success in providing health care benefits

while maintaining a balanced budget during his 11
years as governor of Vermont.
"He falls right in the mainstream of the Demo
cratic Party and America,"he said.
Republicans around campus saw Deans rise as a
mixed blessing for their rivals.
"I actually like Howard Dean." said senior Joe
Fairbanks, former leader of the College Republi
cans. "I think Dean has the ability to do a great job as
chairman and we Republicans would be foolish to
dismiss him from the start."
Fairbanks agreed with Jonas that several of
Dean's weaknesses might haunt the Democrats dur
ing his reign.
"The only thing most people remember of Dean
in the primary is his insane scream." he said. "If the
Republicans can keep that persona of Dean at the
forefront and show that to be the face of the party, it's
going to hurt the Democrats and Dean a lot."
Fairbanks also said that Dean "has a penchant for
saying things that win him no friends on either side of
the political spectrum."
However, he said that despite being "arrogant"
with "a gigantic ego," Dean "is a very intelligent
person, so that would lead me to believe that he
would try to take the party back to the mainstream
and make them competitive again. We'll have to
give him a few months to see what kind of leader he
truly is."
