# Perryman sparks Card
## 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's a common basketball coaching cliche to
say that rebounding is just as much about tech
nique- as it is about desire and energy. As a 6-
foot-1 senior forward on the No. 3 Stanford
women's basketball team (24-2,15-1 Pacific-10
Conference), A/el la Perryman has the tech
nique down, but more importantly she's got the
spark.
Averaging about five rebounds a game
throughout her collegiate career, Perryman
is 11th in the Stanford record books for re
bounds per game. But she's more than just a
rebounding machine — Perryman has al
ways given to the team what the team has
asked from her.
"Over the years I've gotten adjusted to
whatever role I had to play each particular
year," Perryman said. "Sometimes I have to be
a scorer, sometimes a rebounder, sometimes an
energy player. That's the biggest thing you
learn by senior year; that it's not about you but
about the team."
This year Perryman has found her role pro
viding a spark off the bench.
"My role has been a little different coming
off the bench," Perryman said. "It's been more
of the senior leadership, energy and rebound
ing. I don't score as much but I think I con
tribute in other ways, because sometimes we
need that spark, and 1 think that's what I'm
bringing in."
The energy and the intangibles that Perry
man has brought to the team have been invalu
able to the Cardinal's success thus far this sea
son Stanford is on a 15-game winning streak
and will face Oregon at home today. The Car
dinal hope to dish out a little payback when
they face the Ducks, the only Pac-10 team to
have beaten Stanford this season.
The Cardinal have won 35 straight at home,
and with the way they have been steamrolling
opponents recently, it's likely Perryman and
her teammates will exact their revenge tonight.
Hut the going wasn't always as smooth for Per
ryman.

"It's been a rough journey," Perryman said.
"It's always hard when you come in as a fresh
man, and you were like 'all-whatever' from
high school, and you get that rude awakening
that you're not the first player playing 40 min
utes a game."
In high school, Perryman was "all-a-lot-of
things": Nike Ail-American, Academic All-
American, two-time USA Today Alaska Play
er of the Year (2(MM) & 2(X)1) to name a few.
After adjusting to the college basketball scene,
Perryman has steadily improved over the last
three seasons and is now a consistent presence
for the Cardinal.
"Azella brings a lot of energy - she has a lot
of talent and she brings a lot of emotion," se
nior forward T'Nae Thiel said. "She's been a
great teammate and I've been glad to be able to
play with her for four years."
This year, Perryman finds herself surround
ed by a variety of talents.
"There is no one star or go-to player that,
when the game's on the line, the other team is
going to be on," Perryman said. "We have so
many threats from the outside and inside. We
have Candice |Wiggins] driving and slashing,
Susan |King Borchardt] and Kelly [Suminski]
shooting, and Brooke [Smith] inside."
But for the easygoing and fun-loving Perry
man, some of the best things about this year's
team are off the basketball court.
"We haven't had a freshman class as big as
this one since our class, and we weren't a very
crazy outgoing freshman group," Perryman
said. "This is the first time I've been here that
the freshman class has been wild and crazy and
bringing all this energy. Between Candice and
Kristen's Family Guy quotes, they're just crazy.
Candice is always singing, even at 5 a.m. on the
bus. And that just typifies the freshman: always
going."
However, fun and games aside, the goal for
Perryman is the same as for all the Cardinal
women. When asked about her memories from
this year so far, Perryman refused to look to the
past but rather commented about the future.
"Hopefully this year it'll be the national
championship," she said.

While the Pac-10's superstars have overshadowed her throughout her four-year career, Stan
ford senior Azella Perryman has provided steady production for the Cardinal.
It's a common basketball coaching cliche to
say that rebounding is just as much about tech
nique- as it is about desire and energy. As a 6-
foot-1 senior forward on the No. 3 Stanford
women's basketball team (24-2,15-1 Pacific-10
Conference), A/el la Perryman has the tech
nique down, but more importantly she's got the
spark.
Averaging about five rebounds a game
throughout her collegiate career, Perryman
is 11th in the Stanford record books for re
bounds per game. But she's more than just a
rebounding machine — Perryman has al
ways given to the team what the team has
asked from her.
"Over the years I've gotten adjusted to
whatever role I had to play each particular
year," Perryman said. "Sometimes I have to be
a scorer, sometimes a rebounder, sometimes an
energy player. That's the biggest thing you
learn by senior year; that it's not about you but
about the team."
This year Perryman has found her role pro
viding a spark off the bench.
"My role has been a little different coming
off the bench," Perryman said. "It's been more
of the senior leadership, energy and rebound
ing. I don't score as much but I think I con
tribute in other ways, because sometimes we
need that spark, and 1 think that's what I'm
bringing in."
The energy and the intangibles that Perry
man has brought to the team have been invalu
able to the Cardinal's success thus far this sea
son Stanford is on a 15-game winning streak
and will face Oregon at home today. The Car
dinal hope to dish out a little payback when
they face the Ducks, the only Pac-10 team to
have beaten Stanford this season.
The Cardinal have won 35 straight at home,
and with the way they have been steamrolling
opponents recently, it's likely Perryman and
her teammates will exact their revenge tonight.
Hut the going wasn't always as smooth for Per
ryman.

"It's been a rough journey," Perryman said.
"It's always hard when you come in as a fresh
man, and you were like 'all-whatever' from
high school, and you get that rude awakening
that you're not the first player playing 40 min
utes a game."
In high school, Perryman was "all-a-lot-of
things": Nike Ail-American, Academic All-
American, two-time USA Today Alaska Play
er of the Year (2(MM) & 2(X)1) to name a few.
After adjusting to the college basketball scene,
Perryman has steadily improved over the last
three seasons and is now a consistent presence
for the Cardinal.
"Azella brings a lot of energy - she has a lot
of talent and she brings a lot of emotion," se
nior forward T'Nae Thiel said. "She's been a
great teammate and I've been glad to be able to
play with her for four years."
This year, Perryman finds herself surround
ed by a variety of talents.
"There is no one star or go-to player that,
when the game's on the line, the other team is
going to be on," Perryman said. "We have so
many threats from the outside and inside. We
have Candice |Wiggins] driving and slashing,
Susan |King Borchardt] and Kelly [Suminski]
shooting, and Brooke [Smith] inside."
But for the easygoing and fun-loving Perry
man, some of the best things about this year's
team are off the basketball court.
"We haven't had a freshman class as big as
this one since our class, and we weren't a very
crazy outgoing freshman group," Perryman
said. "This is the first time I've been here that
the freshman class has been wild and crazy and
bringing all this energy. Between Candice and
Kristen's Family Guy quotes, they're just crazy.
Candice is always singing, even at 5 a.m. on the
bus. And that just typifies the freshman: always
going."
However, fun and games aside, the goal for
Perryman is the same as for all the Cardinal
women. When asked about her memories from
this year so far, Perryman refused to look to the
past but rather commented about the future.
"Hopefully this year it'll be the national
championship," she said.
