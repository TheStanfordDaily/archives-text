## Dining services reforms meal plans 
### SIMON SHUSTER WRITER 
Stanford Dining officials unveiled a
plan to restructure residential dining
yesterday in what they said was an effort
to make meal plans simpler, more flexi
ble and a better value for students.
More than five months in the making,
the plan, which will go into effect for the
2005-2006 academic year, came in re
sponse to student feedback and a need for
Stanford Dining to tighten its budget. The
changes will make all residential dining
halls all-you-care-to-eat, which is more
cost-effective for the University. Students
will be able to choose from three meal
plans, each of which will cost $4,656 for
three quarters. This translates into $19.90
per day, an average price increase of 2
percent from the current system.
Two of the three new meal plans will

offer Cardinal Dollars, which will be ac
cepted at all Stanford Dining-run cafes.
In addition to the "unlimited" 19-meal
per-week plan, which will not include
Cardinal Dollars, there will be a 14-
meal-per-week plan with 370 Cardinal
Dollars and a 12-meal-per-week plan
with 585 Cardinal Dollars. Meal
"points," which students use now, will
no longer exist.
The changes will not affect the Row,
eating clubs, or Yost and Murray houses,
which will maintain their current dining
programs.
"Our goal is to ensure that we are
responsive to students." said Rafi
Taherian. executive director of Stan
ford Dining.
Taherian and his staff gleaned stu
dent opinions through surveys and a din
ner series, during which administrators
talked one-on-one with undergraduates

about their dining needs.
Shirley Everett, associate vice
provost of residential and dining enter
prises, took part in the dinner series and
played a key role in developing the pro
posal.
"We've taken into consideration
many, many opinions," she said. "The
challenge is to satisfy all of the different
palates."
Research conducted by Stanford
Dining indicated that student needs had
changed dramatically over the past five
years.
For example, the recent addition of
eateries such as Union Squared at
Tresidder Union has created a demand
for greater flexibility, motivating the de
cision to create Cardinal Dollars that
will be accepted at all Stanford Dining
venues.
"[Students] want to be able to go
around the campus, to eat in different lo
cations," Taherian said.
He also said he found there to be a
"perception of inequality" when differ
ent meal plans are offered at a range of
prices.
"People with smaller meal plans were
paying more per meal; students with
larger meal plans felt like they were sub
sidizing the smaller meal plan," he said.
The-new plan, Taherian explained,
will largely benefit athletes, freshmen
and students on financial aid. Through
surveys, Stanford Dining officials found
that athletes and freshmen often run out
of points under the a la carte system.
Also, the two-thirds of undergraduates
who are on financial aid were a major
consideration, Taherian said.
"The single-rate meal plan helps the
financial aid office be fair in giving stu
dents on financial aid a meal plan," he
added.
As of next year, Wilbur and Man
zanita Dining Halls will no longer offer a
la carte service, switching instead to the
all-you-care-to-eat system now used at
Stern Hall.
The main reason for this change is the
need for "fiscal responsibility" within
Stanford Dining, according to Taherian.

"We have to be very careful with the
overhead costs of a la carte service," he
said. "If one day we decided to go all a la
carte, the cost would be significantly
higher."
Because people expect different
standards of quality from a la carte as op
posed to all-you-care-to-eat, he said it is
unwieldy for the two systems to coexist.
"You cannot have two standards of
service," he continued. "You can't have
all-you-care-to-eat and a la carte within
the same residential dining program."
The revenue from residential dining
alone is around $15 million per annum,
and the total revenue, including that
from all facilities run by Stanford Dining
comes to approximately $36 million.
Although Everett and Taherian said
the profits from the cafes and eateries
such as Subway and Tresidder work to
offset the cost of meal plans, there is still
a need for greater cost effectiveness.
The switch to all-you-care-to-eat will
not affect the grab-and-go stand at
Wilbur.
"We need to have something on East
campus that is continuous service,"
Taherian said. "Students can go in the
middle of the day to Wilbur and have a
smoothie."
Still, the plan to revamp Wilbur
stirred some immediate student back
lash.
In an e-mail to The Daily, Wilbur
freshman Logan McClure wrote, "I love
Wilbur. So many people — faculty,
older students and friends — come and
eat in Wilbur because they are able to
get whatever they want and only have to
pay for what they eat."
ASSU Undergraduate Senator Rus
sell Husen, a sophomore, said he met
with and lobbied Stanford Dining to
change their proposal and said he was
happy that some ASSU requests were
incorporated into the final draft, includ
ing the greater variety of dining options
that meal plans will now offer.
"Other requests were not fully ad
dressed in this new plan, though we are

can-eat meal servicce next year under the new Stanford Dining plan.

continuing to work with Stanford
Dining to resolve them." Husen said.
"Our requests to allow points to
be used at non-Stanford Dining loca
tions such as the Tree House, Jamba
Juice, Moon Bean's and select off
campus locations, were completely
dismissed because of the costs Stan
ford Dining would incur." Husen
continued. "Allowing students, par
ticularly upperclassmen, the ability to
opt out of dining plans was also dis
missed for similar reasons."
Dan Zeehandelaar. another
Wilbur freshman, expressed concern
over the added food waste that could
result from an all-you-care-to-eat sys
tem.
In an a la carte system, "students
are more likely to only buy what they
plan to eat, thus reducing food waste,
as well as reducing the tendency to
overeat," Zeehandelaar said.
Yet junior Greg Laughlin. the co
director of SPOON, a group that col

lects excess food from dining halls
and distributes it to the needy, was
not worried about food waste.
"Stanford Dining works hard to
reduce food waste and plays a very
active role in encouraging the Stan
ford community to aid in that en
deavor," Laughlin said.
Another provision in the plan will
make dining more flexible for stu
dents staying on campus over the
summer.
Currently, summer residents are
required to purchase a meal plan but
as of next year, Mirrielees will be re
served for students who do not wish
to have a meal plan for the summer.
In these dorms, which are equipped
with kitchens, students will be able to
cook for themselves.
Everett said she expected there to
be controversy surrounding the pro
posal, adding that Stanford Dining
has been a "lightning rod" for discus
sion during her 13-year tenure.
Moreover, Husen said that the
ASSU "will continue to voice student
concerns with Stanford Dining to
find new and innovative ways to im
prove dining service for all students
on campus."
