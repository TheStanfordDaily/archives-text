America adrift
It is only a matter of time before the people of the United
States realize that they have made a grievous mistake. They have
reinstated, albeit with the aid of many stolen votes, a man and
administration dedicated to the creation of division and hatred,
both nationally and internationally.
They will ruefully watch an attack on their proudly held
freedoms; they will see a steep decline in their standard of liv
ing as the government, of necessity, strives to tackle their enor
mous debts; they will witness a loss of confidence in their cur
rency and a sharp reversal of trade with their traditional trading
partners. The calamitous invasion of Iraq will continue to fester,
both in Iraq and elsewhere in the world Reacting to the fear and
hatred which this administration has engendered almost uni
versally, the tendency will be for the people to look inwards, and
to turn their backs even more squarely on the world.
Illusion
A major problem in dealing with this administration is the
powerful illusion under which it works: that it is God-inspired
and so in divine Grace, helping to restore the Christian world
and message to its former power and glory. Thus has the USA
taken a huge step backwards, isolating itself from the true con
cerns of much of the world, environmental pollution and the
demands of a planet suffering under the strain of impending
disaster
The United States will find that the world will not
stand still. With or without American co-operation the nations
will proceed as best they can to deal with the many ecological

and social problems which beset us. and which so urgently
must be addressed. America will find itself left behind and
ignored, and only then will it be prepared to 'lead' the way.
Rhetoric
This administration is, even now. relishing its victory, and
weighing the pros and cons of subsequent action. Thwarted and
taken unawares by events in Iraq, it must pause awhile before
considering further violence. But the bravado and rhetoric will
doubtless continue, hoping to bully and conquer by threats
alone. Meanwhile, great changes in many countries are under
way, leading to a profound shift in the balance of power in the
world. China and India, South America and Russia, are finding
their feet and economic potential. Africa is beginning to receive,
at last, the concern and goodwill of powerful governments and
agencies, and can look forward to better times.
Thus the world is turning away from the dominance of
American power and wealth, and charting another path to fulfill
its destiny.
If the United States insists on its right of unilateral action,
it will find itself neglected and ignored in international plans
and projects, its economy will further decay, and its people will
lose confidence and trust in government action. Without
friends, and with ebbing strength, it will be forced to change,
and to renew dialogue with its former friends.
The emergence of Maitreya will speed the process of this
transformation and assure its welcome completion
