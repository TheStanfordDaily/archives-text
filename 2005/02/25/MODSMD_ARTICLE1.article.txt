# GSC places groups on ballot
## 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council voted Wednesday on which
joint student groups — groups representing both the undergrad
uate and graduate populations — would appear on the special
fees ballot for the spring election.
Special-fees funds come directly from students' annual tuition
and go toward funding expenses of various student organizations,
such as costs of holding events and hosting guest speakers. The
CISC' can only vote on groups comprised of both graduate and un
dergraduate students.
Groups must request this money each year by submitting a
budget detailing their role in the student community and the seg
ments of the student body the services they provide impact.
Budgets are analyzed by a special-fees committee made up of
five to six members of the GSC, which is headed by the funding
committee chair.
The committee makes recommendations to the GSC of
whether or not a group should appear on the spring ballots and
how much money should be allotted to each. The GSC then
schedules a period of time in which it interviews representatives
from each organization to go over the budget and make sure the
group's services are made accessible and used by a substantial
portion of both graduate and undergraduate students.
Nine joint groups applied to be on the spring special-fees bal
lots this year. Among the groups approved were the ASSIJ
Speakers Bureau, the Student Organizing Committee for the Arts
and campus radio station KZSU.
The GSC denied ballot-placement to both the Jewish Student
Association and I'he Stanford Daily, and it only approved Stan
ford Club Sports for less than half of the amount of special fees it
requested.
"I'he J S A is a new group started just this year," GSC President

Moriah Thomason said. "It was challenging for it to prove that it
served the graduate community. We will still fund .ISA grad
events through our regular funding committee and perhaps next
spring it will be placed on the ballots once it has had the opportu
nity to show a year of experience."
Junior Dave Gross, chief financial officer of the JSA, said he
was more surprised by the denial of special fees from the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate, but was still disappointed about the
(JSC's decision.
" The GSC talked about how we don't reach out to graduate stu-


BRITTANY SALMONAhe Stanford Dail>
dents hut there are graduate students
at many of our events, particularly at
the lectures of our Israeli speakers
since many Jewish graduate students
are from Israel." Gross said. "Unlike
other Jewish groups, we represent all
Jewish students on campus."
If a joint group is denied place
ment tin the spring balance or dis
agrees with the amount of money
recommended for them by the GSC,
they can petition to reverse the deci
sion by collecting signatures from at
least 15 percent of the student popu
lation it is claiming to represent.
Gross said the JSA plans to peti
tion, but will reapply for special fees
as an undergraduate group rather
than a joint group.
The GSC also rejected The Stan
ford Daily's request to be placed on
the special-fees ballot, citing the
paper's budget as the primary rea
son for the denial.
"When we looked at the money
The Daily had in its bank account and
through the Friends of the Daily, we
realized they were a financially inde
pendent organization with no need
for special fees," Thomason said.
"They could be a substainable group
— they can run without the students
having to pay for them. We know that
they want to keep costs down by
being a profitable industry, but we
don't want them using students'
money to build equity."

Eric Eldon, business manager for
The Daily, said that paper brought
in $7(K),(H)() less revenue in 2(X)4 than
it did in 2(XX), and that it has had to
cut costs by over $500,000 over the
last four years.
"Special fees are as much a
source of revenue as advertising."
Eldon said. "The money is like a
subscription fee for the students. It is
something that is crucial for our op
eration and part of how our paper
works."
Eldon added that most of The
Daily's bank account is for necessary
capital expenditures such as comput
ers and emergency funds only and
that the Friends of The Daily fund is
used to ease financial strain on the
paper in such situations, much as it
has been used for the past four years.
The Daily also plans to petition to
get placed on the ballot.
Finally, Stanford Club Sports re
ceived approval, but the GSC rec
ommended that they be allocated
roughly one-third of what the group
requested.
Thomason said that graduate stu
dents outnumber undergrade and
thus pay for more than half of the
special fees for student groups. In
contrast, Stanford Club Sports has
reported that about 25 percent of its
members are graduate students.
"Every graduate is paying half of
the fees for club sports, but only one
fourth of the graduate population is
using its services," Thomason said.
"Special fees for joint groups should
be split in ways reflecting who gets
the value of these services, and that
wasn't the case for this group."

Undergraduate Senate, but was still disappointed about the
(JSC's decision.
" The GSC talked about how we don't reach out to graduate stu-

dents hut there are graduate students
at many of our events, particularly at
the lectures of our Israeli speakers
since many Jewish graduate students
are from Israel." Gross said. "Unlike
other Jewish groups, we represent all
Jewish students on campus."
If a joint group is denied place
ment tin the spring balance or dis
agrees with the amount of money
recommended for them by the GSC,
they can petition to reverse the deci
sion by collecting signatures from at
least 15 percent of the student popu
lation it is claiming to represent.
Gross said the JSA plans to peti
tion, but will reapply for special fees
as an undergraduate group rather
than a joint group.
The GSC also rejected The Stan
ford Daily's request to be placed on
the special-fees ballot, citing the
paper's budget as the primary rea
son for the denial.
"When we looked at the money
The Daily had in its bank account and
through the Friends of the Daily, we
realized they were a financially inde
pendent organization with no need
for special fees," Thomason said.
"They could be a substainable group
— they can run without the students
having to pay for them. We know that
they want to keep costs down by
being a profitable industry, but we
don't want them using students'
money to build equity."

Eric Eldon, business manager for
The Daily, said that paper brought
in $7(K),(H)() less revenue in 2(X)4 than
it did in 2(XX), and that it has had to
cut costs by over $500,000 over the
last four years.
"Special fees are as much a
source of revenue as advertising."
Eldon said. "The money is like a
subscription fee for the students. It is
something that is crucial for our op
eration and part of how our paper
works."
Eldon added that most of The
Daily's bank account is for necessary
capital expenditures such as comput
ers and emergency funds only and
that the Friends of The Daily fund is
used to ease financial strain on the
paper in such situations, much as it
has been used for the past four years.
The Daily also plans to petition to
get placed on the ballot.
Finally, Stanford Club Sports re
ceived approval, but the GSC rec
ommended that they be allocated
roughly one-third of what the group
requested.
Thomason said that graduate stu
dents outnumber undergrade and
thus pay for more than half of the
special fees for student groups. In
contrast, Stanford Club Sports has
reported that about 25 percent of its
members are graduate students.
"Every graduate is paying half of
the fees for club sports, but only one
fourth of the graduate population is
using its services," Thomason said.
"Special fees for joint groups should
be split in ways reflecting who gets
the value of these services, and that
wasn't the case for this group."
The Graduate Student Council voted Wednesday on which
joint student groups — groups representing both the undergrad
uate and graduate populations — would appear on the special
fees ballot for the spring election.
Special-fees funds come directly from students' annual tuition
and go toward funding expenses of various student organizations,
such as costs of holding events and hosting guest speakers. The
CISC' can only vote on groups comprised of both graduate and un
dergraduate students.
Groups must request this money each year by submitting a
budget detailing their role in the student community and the seg
ments of the student body the services they provide impact.
Budgets are analyzed by a special-fees committee made up of
five to six members of the GSC, which is headed by the funding
committee chair.
The committee makes recommendations to the GSC of
whether or not a group should appear on the spring ballots and
how much money should be allotted to each. The GSC then
schedules a period of time in which it interviews representatives
from each organization to go over the budget and make sure the
group's services are made accessible and used by a substantial
portion of both graduate and undergraduate students.
Nine joint groups applied to be on the spring special-fees bal
lots this year. Among the groups approved were the ASSIJ
Speakers Bureau, the Student Organizing Committee for the Arts
and campus radio station KZSU.
The GSC denied ballot-placement to both the Jewish Student
Association and I'he Stanford Daily, and it only approved Stan
ford Club Sports for less than half of the amount of special fees it
requested.
"I'he J S A is a new group started just this year," GSC President

Moriah Thomason said. "It was challenging for it to prove that it
served the graduate community. We will still fund .ISA grad
events through our regular funding committee and perhaps next
spring it will be placed on the ballots once it has had the opportu
nity to show a year of experience."
