# GSC places groups on ballot

### FRANCIE NEUKOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council voted Wednesday on which
joint student groups — groups representing both the undergrad
uate and graduate populations — would appear on the special
fees ballot for the spring election.
Special-fees funds come directly from students' annual tuition
and go toward funding expenses of various student organizations,
such as costs of holding events and hosting guest speakers. The
CISC' can only vote on groups comprised of both graduate and un
dergraduate students.
Groups must request this money each year by submitting a
budget detailing their role in the student community and the seg
ments of the student body the services they provide impact.
Budgets are analyzed by a special-fees committee made up of
five to six members of the GSC, which is headed by the funding
committee chair.
The committee makes recommendations to the GSC of
whether or not a group should appear on the spring ballots and
how much money should be allotted to each. The GSC then
schedules a period of time in which it interviews representatives
from each organization to go over the budget and make sure the
group's services are made accessible and used by a substantial
portion of both graduate and undergraduate students.
Nine joint groups applied to be on the spring special-fees bal
lots this year. Among the groups approved were the ASSIJ
Speakers Bureau, the Student Organizing Committee for the Arts
and campus radio station KZSU.
The GSC denied ballot-placement to both the Jewish Student
Association and I'he Stanford Daily, and it only approved Stan
ford Club Sports for less than half of the amount of special fees it
requested.
"I'he J S A is a new group started just this year," GSC President

Moriah Thomason said. "It was challenging for it to prove that it
served the graduate community. We will still fund .ISA grad
events through our regular funding committee and perhaps next
spring it will be placed on the ballots once it has had the opportu
nity to show a year of experience."
Junior Dave Gross, chief financial officer of the JSA, said he
was more surprised by the denial of special fees from the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate, but was still disappointed about the
(JSC's decision.
" The GSC talked about how we don't reach out to graduate stu-
