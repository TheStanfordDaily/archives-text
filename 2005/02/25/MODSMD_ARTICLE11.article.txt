On Feb. 25. 1925, The Daily ran
an article about the opening of a
boathouse on Lake Lagunita, when
a lake actually existed — kind of
like it does now. Below is an excerpt:
"Lagunita boathouse will open
Friday under the management of
Ernst Brandsten, who is operating it
for the University. The Board of
Athletic Control has given the
boathouse to the University.
"Two floats are now being used
as landings in front of the building.
The standard high diving board on
the west end of the boathouse will
remain and two new springboards
will be installed soon. A depth ol 14
feet is found under the diving boards
because of excavations made last
summer.
"A room fora store under the
management of the Union is found
on the first floor. A regular stock of
candy, ice cream and other delica
cies will be kept on hand. The sec
ond floor will be reserved for
women.
"Rowboats will be rented for 50
cents an hour while the canoes will
cost 75 cents an hour. All boats must
be at the boathouse by 11 p.m. and
cannot be rented before 10 a.m.
"All students may swim in the
lake but no outsiders will be allowed
to swim there although visitors can
rent boats and canoes. Life guards
and boatmen will be on duty at all
times."
On Feb. 25. 1927, The Daily cov
ered a story on Harvard University
students holding a riot after a mid
night vaudeville performance.
Below is an excerpt:
"It took 15 Cambridge police
men six hours to tell a justice of the
peace the details of the riot which
Harvard students staged last week
following a midnight vaudeville per
formance. Twelve-hundred men are
alleged to have participated in the
fist-fighting and egg-throwing which
took place in the square fronting the
theater. Police succeeded in captur
ing only thirty-five participants.
"The courtroom at the initial
hearing was so crowded with college
men and witnesses that the judge
had to order them all outside.
"Policemen testified that vegeta
bles and bottles were thrown at the
patrol wagon which answered the
riot call and calls to tip over the
wagon were numerous. Cries ot
'three cheers for the Irish." livened
up the encounter which was linally
settled by the police with extreme
difficulty."
