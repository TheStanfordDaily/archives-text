## Saturday morning cartoons don't exist anymore 
### 
In a world immersed in the chaos of war, dis
ease and midterms, many are bound to remi
nisce fondly of the simpler days. A time when
the bad guys were easily identifiable as the ones
with the long mustaches and cackling laughs,
when superheroes could single-handedly demol
ish oncoming meteors, when valuable lessons
were taught through catchy tunes and colorful
animation — a time when cartoons reigned
supreme.
While many people belittle cartoons as "juve
nile" or "stupid," they forget that cartoons
played an important role in our childhood devel
opment.
What we didn't learn from school or our par
ents, we learned from TV.
Optimus Prime taught us about honor and
virtue; Captain Planet warned us of the dangers
that littering and oil spills posed to the environ
ment; Duck Talcs showed us how to tame our in
satiable greed and how not to act like treasure
seeking whores when we become millionaires.
In an effort to recapture a glimpse of this
faded past, 1 woke up early one Saturday morn
ing to revisit the world of animation.
Imagine my shock when I awoke to find that

Saturday morning cartoons
don't exist anymore. ('aptain
Planet, Superlriendsand Re
boot had all been replaced
by recycled Nickelodeon
shows disguised as ABC's
"One Saturday Morning."
Ilow did this happen?
What kind of society denies
its children that time-hon
ored ritual of waking up be
fore your parents to watch

Saturday morning cartoons (the best cartoons
on television)? In need of some answers, 1
turned to my six-year-old little brother.
As a first grader who's only recently made the
time-honored transition from kiddie cartoons,
like Clifford the Big Red Dog, to the more so
phisticated ones, like Batman Beyond, he re
mains a mere neophyte in the world of cartoon
viewing. Nevertheless, as an avid cartoon watch
er-in-training, he was the only one who could
help me understand the disappearance of those
classic Saturday morning cartoons.
However, when asked about the where
abouts of Inspector Gadget or the Gurrimi Bears
(not to be confused with the Care Bears, who -
despite most critics' skepticism - arc making a
surprisingly strong comeback with their new
movie "Care Bears: Journey to .loke-a-I -ot"), he
could not shed any light on the matter. I le hadn't
even heard of those shows.
lirtw is this even imaginable? An entire gen
eration of children is being raised without having
ever heard of Saturday morning cartoons. To
think, an entire generation will never hear cov
ers by Alvin and the Chipmunks. Those were, by
far, the most musically-talented chipmunks I
have ever encountered.
The cartoons of our day and age-those classic
blends of adventure, humor, and morality no
longer exist for them.
Unlike the lineups now, cartoons in our day
were actually worth getting up for. Back then,
we watched Saturday morning cartoons non
stop, with animated shorts in between so that we
rarely had to acknowledge the existence of com
mercials.
Cartoons were even educational. English
professors across the nation thank School I louse
Rock for conveying fundamental grammar con
cepts, such as the function of conjunctions or the
various roles of verbs. And with humorous ani
mated figures singing so passionately about
verbs and conjunctions, who wasn't entranced
by the colorful, and oddly musical, world of
grammar?
Instead, what we have today are a pathetic
compilation of cartoon reruns that are hardly
worth waking up early to watch.
lake "Liberty's Kids," a cartoon set during
the American Revolution with such colorful
characters as Ben Franklin, his teenage appren
tice Sarah Miller and Moses (a freed slave, not
the religious figure, although that would have
been ridiculously cool).
Now, I can understand the need to try to edu
cate kids through cartoons, but in all honesty,
unless Ben I ; ranklin turns out to be some kind of
mutant superhero or unless the prophet Moses
himself actually makes an appearance, I don't
see this show going anywhere.
None of these cartoons on TV today can even
compare to classic shows like " Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles." With each kung-fu-fighting,
pizza-eating turtle named after a famous Italian
artist, the show was poised for success as edu
tainment.
I only have to look at my younger brother as
he swings from curtain drapes with a light saber
in his hand and a bat mask on his face, proclaim
ing, "1... am Spiderman" to realize that car
toons have influenced our lives in deep and pro
found ways.
So when Oisney begins broadcasting reruns
of shows like "Recess" and"The Wild Thorn
berries" as the main line-up on Saturday morn
ings, I begin to worry for the future generations
of cartoon-viewers. I really do.

Ilow did this happen?
What kind of society denies
its children that time-hon
ored ritual of waking up be
fore your parents to watch

Saturday morning cartoons (the best cartoons
on television)? In need of some answers, 1
turned to my six-year-old little brother.
As a first grader who's only recently made the
time-honored transition from kiddie cartoons,
like Clifford the Big Red Dog, to the more so
phisticated ones, like Batman Beyond, he re
mains a mere neophyte in the world of cartoon
viewing. Nevertheless, as an avid cartoon watch
er-in-training, he was the only one who could
help me understand the disappearance of those
classic Saturday morning cartoons.
However, when asked about the where
abouts of Inspector Gadget or the Gurrimi Bears
(not to be confused with the Care Bears, who -
despite most critics' skepticism - arc making a
surprisingly strong comeback with their new
movie "Care Bears: Journey to .loke-a-I -ot"), he
could not shed any light on the matter. I le hadn't
even heard of those shows.
lirtw is this even imaginable? An entire gen
eration of children is being raised without having
ever heard of Saturday morning cartoons. To
think, an entire generation will never hear cov
ers by Alvin and the Chipmunks. Those were, by
far, the most musically-talented chipmunks I
have ever encountered.
The cartoons of our day and age-those classic
blends of adventure, humor, and morality no
longer exist for them.
Unlike the lineups now, cartoons in our day
were actually worth getting up for. Back then,
we watched Saturday morning cartoons non
stop, with animated shorts in between so that we
rarely had to acknowledge the existence of com
mercials.
Cartoons were even educational. English
professors across the nation thank School I louse
Rock for conveying fundamental grammar con
cepts, such as the function of conjunctions or the
various roles of verbs. And with humorous ani
mated figures singing so passionately about
verbs and conjunctions, who wasn't entranced
by the colorful, and oddly musical, world of
grammar?
Instead, what we have today are a pathetic
compilation of cartoon reruns that are hardly
worth waking up early to watch.
lake "Liberty's Kids," a cartoon set during
the American Revolution with such colorful
characters as Ben Franklin, his teenage appren
tice Sarah Miller and Moses (a freed slave, not
the religious figure, although that would have
been ridiculously cool).
Now, I can understand the need to try to edu
cate kids through cartoons, but in all honesty,
unless Ben I ; ranklin turns out to be some kind of
mutant superhero or unless the prophet Moses
himself actually makes an appearance, I don't
see this show going anywhere.
None of these cartoons on TV today can even
compare to classic shows like " Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles." With each kung-fu-fighting,
pizza-eating turtle named after a famous Italian
artist, the show was poised for success as edu
tainment.
I only have to look at my younger brother as
he swings from curtain drapes with a light saber
in his hand and a bat mask on his face, proclaim
ing, "1... am Spiderman" to realize that car
toons have influenced our lives in deep and pro
found ways.
So when Oisney begins broadcasting reruns
of shows like "Recess" and"The Wild Thorn
berries" as the main line-up on Saturday morn
ings, I begin to worry for the future generations
of cartoon-viewers. I really do.

In a world immersed in the chaos of war, dis
ease and midterms, many are bound to remi
nisce fondly of the simpler days. A time when
the bad guys were easily identifiable as the ones
with the long mustaches and cackling laughs,
when superheroes could single-handedly demol
ish oncoming meteors, when valuable lessons
were taught through catchy tunes and colorful
animation — a time when cartoons reigned
supreme.
While many people belittle cartoons as "juve
nile" or "stupid," they forget that cartoons
played an important role in our childhood devel
opment.
What we didn't learn from school or our par
ents, we learned from TV.
Optimus Prime taught us about honor and
virtue; Captain Planet warned us of the dangers
that littering and oil spills posed to the environ
ment; Duck Talcs showed us how to tame our in
satiable greed and how not to act like treasure
seeking whores when we become millionaires.
In an effort to recapture a glimpse of this
faded past, 1 woke up early one Saturday morn
ing to revisit the world of animation.
Imagine my shock when I awoke to find that

Saturday morning cartoons
don't exist anymore. ('aptain
Planet, Superlriendsand Re
boot had all been replaced
by recycled Nickelodeon
shows disguised as ABC's
