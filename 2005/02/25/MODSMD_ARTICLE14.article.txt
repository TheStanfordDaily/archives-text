In kitchens from Kicker to Manzanita and behind the counters from
the ('olio to( )lives, hundreds of Stanford Dining employees serve thou
sands of meals every day in nearly two dozen locations on campus.
You see them every day, and you may even recognize them. Hut you
probably don't know much else about the people who prepare your
breakfast, serve your lunch and clean up after your dinner. Below, this re
porter gives you a glimpse into the lives of nine Stanford Dining employ
ees from Wilbur.

Daniel

Daniel Flenning,lB, is one of many
high school students who works as a
temp in the dining halls. When his co-

worker joked around and told him not
to swear so ftiuch in front of this re
porter, he responded, "Have 1 cussed
, yet today"? Bullshit!"

lie is a senior at Menlo Ather
ton and works four days a week
after school.

"I'd have to be here fora year
to get a 2S cent pay raise." Right now
he makes $8 an hour.
"After highsehool," he says"I want to
go to Wyotech.for trade school. I want
to be an auto technician."

some friends. Before coming to
Stanford a year ago, he made
sushi in Redding, Calif. Before
that, he was in I .ouisiana for
three years. Before that, he
lived in Rangoon, Burma, where
he was born.

"I English is the second lan
guage for my country. All sub
jects are taught in linglish," he
said, though he spoke mostly
with his co-workers
\vlTile making sushi and while
on break.

When asked him if there was
anything he wanted to tell Stan
ford students he said "Ming-la-

ba," which means "good morn
ing" in Burmese.

As a porter, Carl
ton Chang is responsi
ble for cleaning the
floors of the kitchen
and all the surfaces for
cooking, before and
after meal prepara
tion.
"I've here 20 years
at Stanford Dining. I
„ started in a Row
House before they
closed down and then
came here to Wilbur,"
he said.

Odie

()die Sims, 52, another porter, was exeited
to show off the present he got for his girl
friend. Hven though it was past Valentine's
I )ay, he said that he wanted to surprise her
with a present when she wasn't expeeting it.

"That's the way I am, I'm a niee

person. Most women don't have some
one who appreciates them, someone
who wants to make them feel better,"'

Sims said. "But I think everybody is
out for the same thing. That's
what everybody needs."
The present was a pair of

heart shaped earrings, which he
bought on a whim while purchas
ing earrings for himself.
"I thought I might as well just bring

IP her something nice, and then bam, sur

William

William Wells, 42, like all dining workers who
wear red shirts, is a temporary worker. Hut not for
long.
"I've been here a year and two months now. I just
started working lull time. I go to orientation on Tues
day, and I'll get a raise from $10 to $11.41." Wells
manages the woks in Wilbur Dining.
I le said that a personal ad for himself would read
something like this:
"Somewhat outgoing, niee, likes cooking. I like
going camping, fishing and barbequing. I've been bar
bequing with my dad for over 20 years for his eatering
business. My dad is from Texas, my mom is Creole
from I ouisiana. She is really, really light and my dad
is really black."
(Yes, he is single, he said.)
lie should add that he is not camera shy; Wells, un
like other workers, seemed comfortable in front of
the camera for this reporter.
"When I played football in high school, a guy was
taking pictures of me the whole game and then I
would buy them from him. Because I had money then
and a job. I worked at I.ong's and 1 was only 16. Then
I worked as a janitor at night; it was fun."

been at Stanford for 35 years. She is one of
the laces in the mural in the Stern dining
hall: the painting, a reproduction of the
last supper, honors Stanford Dining
workers from decades past.
"I've been here a long time and I'm

tired,'" Williams said.
She is a legend of Stanford Dining.
"1 got the biggest mouth. You
ask anyone, and they know who
.Teannette Williams is," she said.

As a long-time employee of
Stanford Dining, Williams'
perspective is unique: "I've
seen changes, changes,
changes. We used to have old
equipment but now we've gone
modern with everything. First it

was vegetarian, then it was vegetarian
and vegan. I'hen it was vegetarian, vegan

and organic. Now we cook completely organic food twice a day."
She has spent more years at Stanford than most students and most faculty
even, but she truly enjoys the environment she works in.
"I like Stanford. I've been here 35 years after all. It's my rock of Gibraltar.
I've bought two homes since I've been here. It's good to people, it's good for
people," Williams said.

Victor Sims has Stanford in
his blood — he was horn in Stanford I lospital in

Victor,

1972.1 le has grown up around the area and said he
just couldn't get enough of the University.

"1 love Stanford, the people. I've been
working here fora year. It's a cool job,
part-time. It's kind of fun to be

\ "* v — — 7
around youngsters, learn a little
something about youngsters," he
said.

When Sims isn't working, he
enjoys relaxing and taking it easy.
"I'm a homebody, I don't

party, I don't club. I just stay at
home with my girlfriend," he said.

When asked what he'd like to
tell students, he said, "I would like
Stanford to go to a bowl game in foot
ball and stop upsetting your fans."

William

William Wells, 42, like all dining workers who
wear red shirts, is a temporary worker. Hut not for
long.
"I've been here a year and two months now. I just
started working lull time. I go to orientation on Tues
day, and I'll get a raise from $10 to $11.41." Wells
manages the woks in Wilbur Dining.
I le said that a personal ad for himself would read
something like this:
"Somewhat outgoing, niee, likes cooking. I like
going camping, fishing and barbequing. I've been bar
bequing with my dad for over 20 years for his eatering
business. My dad is from Texas, my mom is Creole
from I ouisiana. She is really, really light and my dad
is really black."
(Yes, he is single, he said.)
lie should add that he is not camera shy; Wells, un
like other workers, seemed comfortable in front of
the camera for this reporter.
"When I played football in high school, a guy was
taking pictures of me the whole game and then I
would buy them from him. Because I had money then
and a job. I worked at I.ong's and 1 was only 16. Then
I worked as a janitor at night; it was fun."

been at Stanford for 35 years. She is one of
the laces in the mural in the Stern dining
hall: the painting, a reproduction of the
last supper, honors Stanford Dining
workers from decades past.
"I've been here a long time and I'm

tired,'" Williams said.
She is a legend of Stanford Dining.
"1 got the biggest mouth. You
ask anyone, and they know who
.Teannette Williams is," she said.

As a long-time employee of
Stanford Dining, Williams'
perspective is unique: "I've
seen changes, changes,
changes. We used to have old
equipment but now we've gone
modern with everything. First it

was vegetarian, then it was vegetarian
and vegan. I'hen it was vegetarian, vegan

and organic. Now we cook completely organic food twice a day."
She has spent more years at Stanford than most students and most faculty
even, but she truly enjoys the environment she works in.
"I like Stanford. I've been here 35 years after all. It's my rock of Gibraltar.
I've bought two homes since I've been here. It's good to people, it's good for
people," Williams said.

something about youngsters," he
said.

When Sims isn't working, he
enjoys relaxing and taking it easy.
"I'm a homebody, I don't

party, I don't club. I just stay at
home with my girlfriend," he said.

When asked what he'd like to
tell students, he said, "I would like
Stanford to go to a bowl game in foot
ball and stop upsetting your fans."

cook making pizza every other day, al
though he does not actually get to spin the
dough.
Tie works at Stanford in the mornings
and then works at Valencia 1 lotel in San
Jose in the evenings. Not only do these jobs
allow him to use his cooking skills, he has
picked up other skills while on the job.

tomatoes and carrots and other vegetables.









In kitchens from Kicker to Manzanita and behind the counters from
the ('olio to( )lives, hundreds of Stanford Dining employees serve thou
sands of meals every day in nearly two dozen locations on campus.
You see them every day, and you may even recognize them. Hut you
probably don't know much else about the people who prepare your
breakfast, serve your lunch and clean up after your dinner. Below, this re
porter gives you a glimpse into the lives of nine Stanford Dining employ
ees from Wilbur.

Daniel

Daniel Flenning,lB, is one of many
high school students who works as a
temp in the dining halls. When his co-

worker joked around and told him not
to swear so ftiuch in front of this re
porter, he responded, "Have 1 cussed
, yet today"? Bullshit!"

lie is a senior at Menlo Ather
ton and works four days a week
after school.

"I'd have to be here fora year
to get a 2S cent pay raise." Right now
he makes $8 an hour.
"After highsehool," he says"I want to
go to Wyotech.for trade school. I want
to be an auto technician."

Minn

Minn Thcd, 27, m;ikes sushi every

some friends. Before coming to
Stanford a year ago, he made
sushi in Redding, Calif. Before
that, he was in I .ouisiana for
three years. Before that, he
lived in Rangoon, Burma, where
he was born.

"I English is the second lan
guage for my country. All sub
jects are taught in linglish," he
said, though he spoke mostly
with his co-workers
\vlTile making sushi and while
on break.

When asked him if there was
anything he wanted to tell Stan
ford students he said "Ming-la-

ba," which means "good morn
ing" in Burmese.

As a porter, Carl
ton Chang is responsi
ble for cleaning the
floors of the kitchen
and all the surfaces for
cooking, before and
after meal prepara
tion.
"I've here 20 years
at Stanford Dining. I
„ started in a Row
House before they
closed down and then
came here to Wilbur,"
he said.
Left, Chang is hold
ing a disposable un

used while skiing with
his son last weekend.

Odie

()die Sims, 52, another porter, was exeited
to show off the present he got for his girl
friend. Hven though it was past Valentine's
I )ay, he said that he wanted to surprise her
with a present when she wasn't expeeting it.

"That's the way I am, I'm a niee

person. Most women don't have some
one who appreciates them, someone
who wants to make them feel better,"'

Sims said. "But I think everybody is
out for the same thing. That's
what everybody needs."
The present was a pair of

heart shaped earrings, which he
bought on a whim while purchas
ing earrings for himself.
