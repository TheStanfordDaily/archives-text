## Editorial Top three issues on campus 
### 
As parents arrive at Stanford this weekend, they
should be aware of the issues lacing this campus. This
editorial highlights three of the most pressing con
cerns — they issues will affect current and future stu
dents, as well as their families.
Housing changes need more student input
On Feb. 7, Vice Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation John Bravman announced a proposal for
changes to undergraduate housing that would signifi
cantly alter students' experiences at Stanford. While
the proposed changes — which include increasing the
number of all-freshman dorms and moving Ujamaa to
Florence Moore Hall, or FloMo — would benefit a
large portion of the Stanford community, we feel that
the lack of student input and the relocation of Ujamaa
are serious flaws in the proposal.
Ujamaa, which is the African-American theme
dorm that houses more than 1(H) residents, is a vital
part of the black community on campus. Unfortu
nately, the current Black Community Services Cen
ter, or BCSC, has too little space to hold large meet
ings or host speakers. The Ujamaa common room,
which has a stage, can host events that a typical com
mon room could not accommodate. In the past, the
dorm has played host to protests against apartheid
and to discussions with famous speakers. Moving Uja
maa would eliminate the possibility of such events in
the dorm unless the University made significant
changes to one of the FloMo dorms.
Equally important is the lack of student input on
the issue. The proposed plan will have a significant im
pact on the ethnic theme dorms, four-class housing
and general student life — student input and support
are absolutely crucial for this kind of project, and stu
dents must be included in all levels of decision-making.
The new Munger housing project will also trans
form life on campus — not just for students, but for
every member of the community. The project, which
will be constructed between this June and the spring
of 2(X)7, is an unwelcome addition to the campus. The
three new buildings will be located close to the Law
School and hous£ 6(H) graduate students. Under the
current design, they will ruin the beautiful and historic

are the views of their respective writers and do not necessarily represent the views of the editorial board

Salvatierra Walk, and their four- to five-and-half
story frames will be an ugly, disruptive presence.
Though providing more graduate student residences
is an admirable and necessary goal for the University,
it should not come at such a high price.
Trustees should provide justification
for tuition increases
The University's Board of Trustees recently an
nounced that tuition costs will increase once again
next year, as they have every year in recent memory.
The 2005-2006 academic year will be a milestone for
Stanford — tuition will, for the first time, break the
$10,000 per quarter mark. That's $1,000 per week,
$200 per school day. As students, we understand the
need for tuition increases, even large ones, but it is im
perative that the University provides adequate expla
nations for the increases. Each year, the Board seems
to explain the rise in costs with fewer words and less
regret, so we call fora fuller explanation and justifica
tion of tuition increases.
In addition, Stanford must show its students that it
is doing everything it can to minimize costs. Staff and
faculty salaries are not rising as fast as tuition, which
has jumped 4.5 percent in each of the last two years.
Donors pay for most building concerns— both new
structures and necessary renovations to existing ones
— and the endowment is recovering quite nicely from
the recent economic downturn. The University must
be more open about tuition increases, thereby ac
knowledging both students' and parents' concerns.
Even if the Board knows that tuition will rise steadily
every year in the foreseeable future, being honest
about this fact and the reasons behind it will allow us
— and our parents — to plan ahead.
Mew alcohol policy threatens student safety
A social issue that is of particular interest to many
students is the University's newly instituted alcohol
policy, which bars all-freshman dorms from serving al
cohol at their events. It is no secret that many students
under the age of 21 still consume al
cohol despite the current law; a large
percentage of Stanford freshmen are
going to drink regardless of what the
University tells them what they can
and cannot do.
In years past, rather than asking
resident advisers, or RAs, and resi
dent fellows to enforce underage
drinking laws. University adminis
trators left the enforcement to the
police, who can arrest underage
drinkers at their own will. However,
the new policy calls on RAs to mon
itor drinking in all-freshman dorms.
One of the great virtues of the
Stanford's Residential Education
program has been the fact that RAs
did not police the halls or enact pun

ishments — such a role would di
minish the feeling of trust and close
ness between dorm staff and resi
dents. The new policy presents a
dangerous threat to this atmo
sphere. Trust between residents and
staff is important for many reasons.
Not only do students feel that they
can relate more closely with their
dorm staff, but students are also
more likely to turn to their RAs if a
resident is experiencing drinking
problems.
Under the new policy, students
are sometimes reluctant to ask RAs
for help in an alcohol-related emer
gency. The risk that the policy pre
sents is that students needing im
mediate medical attention may not
receive the proper care at an urgent
time.
While we understand the need to
regulate drinking — especially among
underclassmen — it should not come
at the cost of students' safety.

regret, so we call fora fuller explanation and justifica
tion of tuition increases.
In addition, Stanford must show its students that it
is doing everything it can to minimize costs. Staff and
faculty salaries are not rising as fast as tuition, which
has jumped 4.5 percent in each of the last two years.
Donors pay for most building concerns— both new
structures and necessary renovations to existing ones
— and the endowment is recovering quite nicely from
the recent economic downturn. The University must
be more open about tuition increases, thereby ac
knowledging both students' and parents' concerns.
Even if the Board knows that tuition will rise steadily
every year in the foreseeable future, being honest
about this fact and the reasons behind it will allow us
— and our parents — to plan ahead.
Mew alcohol policy threatens student safety
A social issue that is of particular interest to many
students is the University's newly instituted alcohol
policy, which bars all-freshman dorms from serving al
cohol at their events. It is no secret that many students
under the age of 21 still consume al
cohol despite the current law; a large
percentage of Stanford freshmen are
going to drink regardless of what the
University tells them what they can
and cannot do.
In years past, rather than asking
resident advisers, or RAs, and resi
dent fellows to enforce underage
drinking laws. University adminis
trators left the enforcement to the
police, who can arrest underage
drinkers at their own will. However,
the new policy calls on RAs to mon
itor drinking in all-freshman dorms.
One of the great virtues of the
Stanford's Residential Education
program has been the fact that RAs
did not police the halls or enact pun

ishments — such a role would di
minish the feeling of trust and close
ness between dorm staff and resi
dents. The new policy presents a
dangerous threat to this atmo
sphere. Trust between residents and
staff is important for many reasons.
Not only do students feel that they
can relate more closely with their
dorm staff, but students are also
more likely to turn to their RAs if a
resident is experiencing drinking
problems.
Under the new policy, students
are sometimes reluctant to ask RAs
for help in an alcohol-related emer
gency. The risk that the policy pre
sents is that students needing im
mediate medical attention may not
receive the proper care at an urgent
time.
While we understand the need to
regulate drinking — especially among
underclassmen — it should not come
at the cost of students' safety.
As parents arrive at Stanford this weekend, they
should be aware of the issues lacing this campus. This
editorial highlights three of the most pressing con
cerns — they issues will affect current and future stu
dents, as well as their families.
Housing changes need more student input
On Feb. 7, Vice Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation John Bravman announced a proposal for
changes to undergraduate housing that would signifi
cantly alter students' experiences at Stanford. While
the proposed changes — which include increasing the
number of all-freshman dorms and moving Ujamaa to
Florence Moore Hall, or FloMo — would benefit a
large portion of the Stanford community, we feel that
the lack of student input and the relocation of Ujamaa
are serious flaws in the proposal.
Ujamaa, which is the African-American theme
dorm that houses more than 1(H) residents, is a vital
part of the black community on campus. Unfortu
nately, the current Black Community Services Cen
ter, or BCSC, has too little space to hold large meet
ings or host speakers. The Ujamaa common room,
which has a stage, can host events that a typical com
mon room could not accommodate. In the past, the
dorm has played host to protests against apartheid
and to discussions with famous speakers. Moving Uja
maa would eliminate the possibility of such events in
the dorm unless the University made significant
changes to one of the FloMo dorms.
Equally important is the lack of student input on
the issue. The proposed plan will have a significant im
pact on the ethnic theme dorms, four-class housing
and general student life — student input and support
are absolutely crucial for this kind of project, and stu
dents must be included in all levels of decision-making.
The new Munger housing project will also trans
form life on campus — not just for students, but for
every member of the community. The project, which
will be constructed between this June and the spring
of 2(X)7, is an unwelcome addition to the campus. The
three new buildings will be located close to the Law
School and hous£ 6(H) graduate students. Under the
current design, they will ruin the beautiful and historic

Salvatierra Walk, and their four- to five-and-half
story frames will be an ugly, disruptive presence.
Though providing more graduate student residences
is an admirable and necessary goal for the University,
it should not come at such a high price.
Trustees should provide justification
for tuition increases
The University's Board of Trustees recently an
nounced that tuition costs will increase once again
next year, as they have every year in recent memory.
The 2005-2006 academic year will be a milestone for
Stanford — tuition will, for the first time, break the
$10,000 per quarter mark. That's $1,000 per week,
$200 per school day. As students, we understand the
need for tuition increases, even large ones, but it is im
perative that the University provides adequate expla
nations for the increases. Each year, the Board seems
to explain the rise in costs with fewer words and less
regret, so we call fora fuller explanation and justifica
tion of tuition increases.
In addition, Stanford must show its students that it
is doing everything it can to minimize costs. Staff and
