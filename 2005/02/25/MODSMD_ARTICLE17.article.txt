## OSP must embrace change 
### 
If truth is the daughter of time, as an old proverb had
it, so is debate the parent of change. This lesson has re
cently come home to me with the public and private ex
change over my critiques of the Overseas Studies Pro
gram. or OSP (most recently, "The sun never sets on
Stanford," Feb. 18). But the fine points of "debate" aside,
a good deal of ink will have been spilled in vain unless

change actually occurs at the OSP.
The dissenters to my arguments
have laid responsibility for cultural
immersion mainly at the feet of stu
dents, who should, the thinking goes,
break the fetters of the "Stanlord-in"
centers themselves. But useful as this
advice is, so too does it neglect a tru
ism: behavioral change rarely occurs
without the propelling force of struc
tural change.
And so I offer a few suggestions,
hardly comprehensive, perhaps al-

ready considered, probably imperfect:
First, English-taught classes should be phased out as
much as possible, if not eliminated. Some will argue that
such a change would limit foreign travel to those with
previous language skills. In Beijing, Berlin, Florence and
Paris, classes are already taught in a mix of English and
the native language; these programs assume some level
of student proficiency. The extension of native-language
classes to the entire curriculum would certainly chal
lenge students — but that is an argument for, not
against, such a change.
A restoration of native-language classes must not
prevent the linguistically unprepared from studying
abroad. But with some imagination there must be a way
to better prepare students, rather than neutering the
class slate once abroad.
Second, OSP should end its overindulgent exercise of
allowing students to request that they live near friends

also going abroad. These lucky pairs, separated by an
apartment floor or city block, often end up living all hut
together. What might form a safety net for travel neo
phytes has thus devolved into a way for partners and best
friends to more easily commingle. There must be anoth
er way to soften the landing for apprehensive travelers;
as to the friends and lovers category, well, they'll have to
take the hus. It is for their, and our, own good.
Third, OSP should require all students to complete an
internship during each quarter spent abroad. Here, OSP
could reference itsown Krupp Internship Program at the
Berlin center.
The pursuit and arrangement of internships may ini
tially prove difficult. Class time will be lost and remu
neration will be scarce or unavailable. Bui there are few
better stepping-stones on the path to worthwhile educa
tion than an internship — an argument made by OSP it
self. about its Krupp program. The obstacles will fade,
and the rewards will be vast.
Arguments may be marshaled to counter anv of the
above suggestions. But, as the brokers of the University
so often remind us, there are few barriers that a mental
and financial effort cannot overcome.
Change is imperative because, while 1 have never un
covered a study-abroad program with a Web site and
publicity as sophisticated as that of OSP, I have met
dozens of non-Stanford students whose study-abroad
programs seemed, by their accounts, less polished but far
more immersive.
Change is imperative because, though students are
hardly organizing fora study-abroad revolution, we will
broaden our own horizons and seek a more distinctive
experience if OSP forces — yes, forces — us to.
Change is imperative because, as no commencement
speaker fails to remind us, the world's leaders are being
trained at Stanford — and if the training fails the test of


Christopher R.
Vaughan
modesty and catholicity, then the
world will be in a very bad way in
deed.
Change is imperative, finally, be
cause it may bridge the gulf between
the middling experience of the cur- 1
rent "Stanford-in" centers and the;
bracing experience that I have wit
nessed in students of other pro
grams.
Change is as possible as it is ur
gent. At the same time, though,
there is no banner more quickly ral
lied-around than that of the status
quo. The choice is between re
trenchment and change. Let's hope
that mine is not the last word.

more immersive.

If truth is the daughter of time, as an old proverb had
it, so is debate the parent of change. This lesson has re
cently come home to me with the public and private ex
change over my critiques of the Overseas Studies Pro
gram. or OSP (most recently, "The sun never sets on
Stanford," Feb. 18). But the fine points of "debate" aside,
a good deal of ink will have been spilled in vain unless

change actually occurs at the OSP.
The dissenters to my arguments
have laid responsibility for cultural
immersion mainly at the feet of stu
dents, who should, the thinking goes,
break the fetters of the "Stanlord-in"
centers themselves. But useful as this
advice is, so too does it neglect a tru
ism: behavioral change rarely occurs
without the propelling force of struc
tural change.
And so I offer a few suggestions,
hardly comprehensive, perhaps al-

ready considered, probably imperfect:
First, English-taught classes should be phased out as
much as possible, if not eliminated. Some will argue that
such a change would limit foreign travel to those with
previous language skills. In Beijing, Berlin, Florence and
Paris, classes are already taught in a mix of English and
the native language; these programs assume some level
of student proficiency. The extension of native-language
classes to the entire curriculum would certainly chal
lenge students — but that is an argument for, not
against, such a change.
A restoration of native-language classes must not
prevent the linguistically unprepared from studying
abroad. But with some imagination there must be a way
to better prepare students, rather than neutering the
class slate once abroad.
Second, OSP should end its overindulgent exercise of
allowing students to request that they live near friends

also going abroad. These lucky pairs, separated by an
apartment floor or city block, often end up living all hut
together. What might form a safety net for travel neo
phytes has thus devolved into a way for partners and best
friends to more easily commingle. There must be anoth
er way to soften the landing for apprehensive travelers;
as to the friends and lovers category, well, they'll have to
take the hus. It is for their, and our, own good.
Third, OSP should require all students to complete an
internship during each quarter spent abroad. Here, OSP
could reference itsown Krupp Internship Program at the
Berlin center.
The pursuit and arrangement of internships may ini
tially prove difficult. Class time will be lost and remu
neration will be scarce or unavailable. Bui there are few
better stepping-stones on the path to worthwhile educa
tion than an internship — an argument made by OSP it
self. about its Krupp program. The obstacles will fade,
and the rewards will be vast.
