## Students must work with Bravman on Housing 
### THERESA JOHNSON ANETO OKONKWO 
Earlier this month. Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Housing John
Bravman addressed a packed Uja
maa lounge regarding plans for an
upcoming undergraduate housing
overhaul. The point of contention:
moving Ujamaa from its historic lo
cation. The sobering discussion left
some heartbroken, some estranged
and others angry. Most importantly,
though, students left feeling empow
ered to have a voice in the process.
In the weeks since, debate has en
sued in dining halls, over e-mail lists
and on the pages of The Daily. Many
have cited the need to evaluate the
human costs of the proposed
changes. I he Daily's editorial board
rightly called for student input into
the decisionmaking process and the
Undergraduate Housing Commit
tee also reviewed the issue.
Yet, the discussion of the fate of
Ujamaa remains largely unad
dressed. As student leaders we need
to communicate the urgency of our
mounting campaign and suggest
how and why students and adminis
trators should work together in deci
sion-making.
As part of a larger effort to im
prove undergraduates' residential ex

periences, Bravman proposed moving
Ujamaa from Lagunita to Florence
Moore Hall, or Flo Mo. While meeting
the demand for all-frosh housing and
improving options for upperclassmen
are pressing issues, the proposed plan
relegates Ujamaa to an afterthought,
shuttled around to fix a loosely-relat
ed University problem. This scenario
downplays the importance of Ujamaa
as a historical landmark, a physical
symbol of struggle and progress, and a
living museum of the Black communi
ty at Stanford. The house features
weekly cultural theme programs and
black student group meetings in the
same lounges where our predecessors
learned and lived. This powerful ele
ment of tradition has made "Uj" a
highly requested home away from
home for the entire Black community.
Students have already begun ral
lying around the issue, but even
more involvement is needed.
Through weekly meetings, the
Black Student Union, or BSU, in
conjunction with the Black Commu
nity Services Center, has strived to
maintain dialogue around the issue.
More important than talk, students
realize that strategic action is neces
sary. As such, the BSU is hosting a
town hall meeting on Monday, Feb.
28, to unite the Black and Ujamaa
Resident population. Finally, there
have been efforts of coalition build
ing among all ethnic theme dorms
and other affected communities,
such as those opposed to frosh-clus
tering. Organizers recognize that it
will take a powerful voice from all
areas of the student body to make
our presence felt.
But organizers are also cognizant
that student rallying alone isn't
enough. We have to be ready and
willing to work with the University,
not against it. We can only insist that
Bravman match and surpass our ur
gency, and actively encourage and
facilitate student involvement. He
should take the first steps by publi
cizing the sought after numerical
data behind the initial proposal, and
making himself available for open

forums with students. We need his
team's expert insights in order to
fully understand the situation, but
they need our insights to offer novel
solutions from a student's perspec
tive. One such innovative idea was
remodeling Ujamaa in its existing
location by extending the building
into the rear parking lot to add ad
ditional doubles for freshmen, but
students maintain that they will
need the existing numerical data to
generate a formal proposal for the
administration.
Although the housing plan's ac
tual implementation is millions of
dollars and two to six years away, we
must work together now to secure
the future of Ujamaa, and the future
of student voice.
