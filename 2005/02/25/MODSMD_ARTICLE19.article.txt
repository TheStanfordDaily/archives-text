## Students must work with Bravman on Housing 
### THERESA JOHNSON ANETO OKONKWO 
Earlier this month. Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Housing John
Bravman addressed a packed Uja
maa lounge regarding plans for an
upcoming undergraduate housing
overhaul. The point of contention:
moving Ujamaa from its historic lo
cation. The sobering discussion left
some heartbroken, some estranged
and others angry. Most importantly,
though, students left feeling empow
ered to have a voice in the process.
In the weeks since, debate has en
sued in dining halls, over e-mail lists
and on the pages of The Daily. Many
have cited the need to evaluate the
human costs of the proposed
changes. I he Daily's editorial board
rightly called for student input into
the decisionmaking process and the
Undergraduate Housing Commit
tee also reviewed the issue.
Yet, the discussion of the fate of
Ujamaa remains largely unad
dressed. As student leaders we need
to communicate the urgency of our
mounting campaign and suggest
how and why students and adminis
trators should work together in deci
sion-making.
As part of a larger effort to im
prove undergraduates' residential ex

periences, Bravman proposed moving
Ujamaa from Lagunita to Florence
Moore Hall, or Flo Mo. While meeting
the demand for all-frosh housing and
improving options for upperclassmen
are pressing issues, the proposed plan
relegates Ujamaa to an afterthought,
shuttled around to fix a loosely-relat
ed University problem. This scenario
downplays the importance of Ujamaa
as a historical landmark, a physical
symbol of struggle and progress, and a
living museum of the Black communi
ty at Stanford. The house features
weekly cultural theme programs and
black student group meetings in the
same lounges where our predecessors
learned and lived. This powerful ele
ment of tradition has made "Uj" a
highly requested home away from
home for the entire Black community.
Students have already begun ral
lying around the issue, but even
more involvement is needed.
Through weekly meetings, the
Black Student Union, or BSU, in
conjunction with the Black Commu
nity Services Center, has strived to
maintain dialogue around the issue.
More important than talk, students
realize that strategic action is neces
sary. As such, the BSU is hosting a
town hall meeting on Monday, Feb.
