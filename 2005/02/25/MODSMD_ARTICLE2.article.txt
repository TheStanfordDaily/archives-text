# H&S School faces large deficit

### KILLEEN HANSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences, currently suffering from a $7 to $8
million deficit, will freeze faculty hires and
graduate student admissions for the next
one or two years.
Due to excessive hiring of new faculty
members, University budget retrench
ments and grad student over-admissions in
recent years, the school will have to dra
matically cut expenditures in order to bal
ance its budget.
l or the school, which typically operates
on an average budget of $280 million a
year, deficits like this one are historically
normal fluctuations, according to Karen
Nagy, executive dean of the school. How
ever, this current deficit is particularly
threatening because it comes at a time
when the school is already working off of a

limited budget with an especially low sur
plus cushion.
Nagy said the school should be able to
withstand this deficit without any prob
lems and only feels that it is troublesome
now because there is no reserve to fall back
on.
Budget retrenchments occur every few
years and the school has been working
with a deficit since the early 1990s due to
cuts in the late 1980s.
In addition, the school?s structural bud
get — the base amount of money upon
which the school operates — was severely
impacted by the recent cuts. The school
generally uses money from one-time
donor gifts to fill in the gap between the
school's structural budget and its annual
costs.
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences, which receives the largest share of
the University's funds, was affected more

than were other schools by the cuts. Stan
ford finances approximately 40 percent of
the school's budget, and live percent of
that contribution has been lost —translat-
ing into a significant loss for the school's
operating budget. The School of 1 '.arth Sci
ences, on the other hand, receives only 15
percent of its funds from the University
and was therefore not hit as hard.
This year, the school's total budget
came to about $276.4 million. Of that
amount, an estimated $107.4 million
comes from the University's general oper
ating budget, $92.7 million comes out of
expendable gifts and endowment payoff,
$71.7 million comes from various grants
and contracts and the last $4.6 million
comes from auxiliary activities.
