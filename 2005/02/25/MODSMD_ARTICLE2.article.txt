# H&S School faces large deficit
## 
### KILLEEN HANSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences, currently suffering from a $7 to $8
million deficit, will freeze faculty hires and
graduate student admissions for the next
one or two years.
Due to excessive hiring of new faculty
members, University budget retrench
ments and grad student over-admissions in
recent years, the school will have to dra
matically cut expenditures in order to bal
ance its budget.
l or the school, which typically operates
on an average budget of $280 million a
year, deficits like this one are historically
normal fluctuations, according to Karen
Nagy, executive dean of the school. How
ever, this current deficit is particularly
threatening because it comes at a time
when the school is already working off of a

limited budget with an especially low sur
plus cushion.
Nagy said the school should be able to
withstand this deficit without any prob
lems and only feels that it is troublesome
now because there is no reserve to fall back
on.
Budget retrenchments occur every few
years and the school has been working
with a deficit since the early 1990s due to
cuts in the late 1980s.
In addition, the school?s structural bud
get — the base amount of money upon
which the school operates — was severely
impacted by the recent cuts. The school
generally uses money from one-time
donor gifts to fill in the gap between the
school's structural budget and its annual
costs.
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences, which receives the largest share of
the University's funds, was affected more

than were other schools by the cuts. Stan
ford finances approximately 40 percent of
the school's budget, and live percent of
that contribution has been lost —translat-
ing into a significant loss for the school's
operating budget. The School of 1 '.arth Sci
ences, on the other hand, receives only 15
percent of its funds from the University
and was therefore not hit as hard.
This year, the school's total budget
came to about $276.4 million. Of that
amount, an estimated $107.4 million
comes from the University's general oper
ating budget, $92.7 million comes out of
expendable gifts and endowment payoff,
$71.7 million comes from various grants
and contracts and the last $4.6 million
comes from auxiliary activities.
Sharon Long, dean of the School of 1 lu
manities and Sciences, has aggressively
hired faculty in recent years. These hires
have exceeded the school's available funds
for salaries, according to Nagy.
Also in the last year, the University
switched to a new financial system called
Oracle, which is used by its peer institu
tions. Because so much financial data was
being transferred from the old system to the
new, it was difficult to discern the exact fi
nancial status of the school at any given
time.
The school's fiscal calendar runs from
Sept. 1 to Aug. 31 of each year, and the
school?s account books are usually final
ized and closed by the third week of Sep
tember. This year, due to the difficult tran
sition between financial systems, the
school?s books couldn't be closed until the
beginning of November. As a result, the
school's leadership couldn't get a clear pic
ture of the budget until much later in the

year.
At that time, the school's administrators
noticed that they had been spending more
money on hires than the budget allowed.
In order to fix the budget deficit, the
school will delay searching for new faculty
members for one to two years, Nagy said.
"We've just been getting out ahead on
faculty hires," she added.
The problem has also been exacerbat
ed by the combination of surplus gradu
ate admissions and the recent implemen
tation of an extensive graduate student fi
nancial aid package. Approximately 300
to 350 graduate students are admitted by
the School of Humanities and Sciences
each year, but during the past two years,
the school has admitted 40 more students
than the budget base line allows. Conse
quently, the school has spent a large part
of its reserve budget and will need to cut
back on graduate admissions.
Besides admitting fewer graduate stu
dents, the school is considering creating
more incentives for incoming graduate stu
dents to find external dollars to help fi
nance their educations.

Nagy said she fully expects graduate ad
missions to return to normal within two
years. She also added that the school should
not experience long-term negative effects
from the current cutbacks.
"This is an opportunity for the school
to take a step back and do some thought
ful planning," said Eugenie Van Wynen,
associate dean for external relations.
"This is a recalibration back into afford
ability mode and then into expansion
mode."
When discussing the ways in which the
deficit-induced changes could ultimately
benefit the school, Nagy noted that they
will provide a chance to develop vigorous
affordability modeling—an opportunity
that the school has never had before.
The school has also internally adjusted
to the deficit by slowing facilities projects
and spending less on technology infrastruc
ture.
"This deficit is no surprise," Nagy said.
"It has been projected in our published
budget for the last several years. There is no
lost or missing money. We know exactly
where every cent is."

members, University budget retrench
ments and grad student over-admissions in
recent years, the school will have to dra
matically cut expenditures in order to bal
ance its budget.
l or the school, which typically operates
on an average budget of $280 million a
year, deficits like this one are historically
normal fluctuations, according to Karen
Nagy, executive dean of the school. How
ever, this current deficit is particularly
threatening because it comes at a time
when the school is already working off of a

limited budget with an especially low sur
plus cushion.
Nagy said the school should be able to
withstand this deficit without any prob
lems and only feels that it is troublesome
now because there is no reserve to fall back
on.
Budget retrenchments occur every few
years and the school has been working
with a deficit since the early 1990s due to
cuts in the late 1980s.
In addition, the school?s structural bud
get — the base amount of money upon
which the school operates — was severely
impacted by the recent cuts. The school
generally uses money from one-time
donor gifts to fill in the gap between the
school's structural budget and its annual
costs.
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences, which receives the largest share of
the University's funds, was affected more

than were other schools by the cuts. Stan
ford finances approximately 40 percent of
the school's budget, and live percent of
that contribution has been lost —translat-
ing into a significant loss for the school's
operating budget. The School of 1 '.arth Sci
ences, on the other hand, receives only 15
percent of its funds from the University
and was therefore not hit as hard.
This year, the school's total budget
came to about $276.4 million. Of that
amount, an estimated $107.4 million
comes from the University's general oper
ating budget, $92.7 million comes out of
expendable gifts and endowment payoff,
$71.7 million comes from various grants
and contracts and the last $4.6 million
comes from auxiliary activities.
Sharon Long, dean of the School of 1 lu
manities and Sciences, has aggressively
hired faculty in recent years. These hires
have exceeded the school's available funds
for salaries, according to Nagy.
Also in the last year, the University
switched to a new financial system called
Oracle, which is used by its peer institu
tions. Because so much financial data was
being transferred from the old system to the
new, it was difficult to discern the exact fi
nancial status of the school at any given
time.
The school's fiscal calendar runs from
Sept. 1 to Aug. 31 of each year, and the
school?s account books are usually final
ized and closed by the third week of Sep
tember. This year, due to the difficult tran
sition between financial systems, the
school?s books couldn't be closed until the
beginning of November. As a result, the
school's leadership couldn't get a clear pic
ture of the budget until much later in the

year.
At that time, the school's administrators
noticed that they had been spending more
money on hires than the budget allowed.
In order to fix the budget deficit, the
school will delay searching for new faculty
members for one to two years, Nagy said.
"We've just been getting out ahead on
faculty hires," she added.
The problem has also been exacerbat
ed by the combination of surplus gradu
ate admissions and the recent implemen
tation of an extensive graduate student fi
nancial aid package. Approximately 300
to 350 graduate students are admitted by
the School of Humanities and Sciences
each year, but during the past two years,
the school has admitted 40 more students
than the budget base line allows. Conse
quently, the school has spent a large part
of its reserve budget and will need to cut
back on graduate admissions.
Besides admitting fewer graduate stu
dents, the school is considering creating
more incentives for incoming graduate stu
dents to find external dollars to help fi
nance their educations.

Nagy said she fully expects graduate ad
missions to return to normal within two
years. She also added that the school should
not experience long-term negative effects
from the current cutbacks.
"This is an opportunity for the school
to take a step back and do some thought
ful planning," said Eugenie Van Wynen,
associate dean for external relations.
"This is a recalibration back into afford
ability mode and then into expansion
mode."
When discussing the ways in which the
deficit-induced changes could ultimately
benefit the school, Nagy noted that they
will provide a chance to develop vigorous
affordability modeling—an opportunity
that the school has never had before.
The school has also internally adjusted
to the deficit by slowing facilities projects
and spending less on technology infrastruc
ture.
"This deficit is no surprise," Nagy said.
"It has been projected in our published
budget for the last several years. There is no
lost or missing money. We know exactly
where every cent is."
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences, currently suffering from a $7 to $8
million deficit, will freeze faculty hires and
graduate student admissions for the next
one or two years.
