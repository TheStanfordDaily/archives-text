## Religious dialogue not lacking on campus 
### JULIE VERHOFF GALEN THOMPSON 
While we agree that the need
lor religious dialogue on campus,
as expressed by The Daily's edito
rial on Feb. 23("Campus needs
more religious dialogue"), is an in
tegral part of developing a rich
and diverse campus atmosphere,
the claim that there is a "dearth of
religious discourse" is rooted in
the type of misunderstanding to
ward actively engaging in diversity
that often characterizes our cam
pus.
We do need to talk about reli
gion and make it a topic that can
be discussed comfortably, and, at
the same time, recognize the value
and importance of facing the diffi
cult and uncomfortable topics. But
do not look any further than your
self to place responsibility for not
being a part of the conversation.

As two students who worked to
found and lead the Alliance for In
terfailh Dialogue under the Office
of Religious Life, or ORL, and the
ASSU this year, please let us share
with you some avenues for explor
ing religious discourse.
The 2004-2005 brochure put
out by the Office of Religious Life
is easily available to every student
in hard copy or on the Internet and
is given to every freshman at Ori
entation. It not only lists all avail
able worship opportunities at
Stanford, it presents the Alliance
for Interfaith Dialogue as the first
of many listed student groups. The
editorial board remarked that
there is a pressing need for in
creased understanding of Islam,
and we absolutely agree — this is
why MSAN sponsors a series of
dinners on subjects like Women in
Islam (Sundays, to 8 p.m. in the
Bechtel International Center). If
you want to jump in further, go to
the Islamic Society at Stanford's
prayers in the Clubhouse Ball
room Fridays at noon. Hillel will
welcome any student of any back
ground at Shabbat services on Fri
days at the Ziff Center at 6:30 p.m.
Any of the many Christian com
munities on campus, including the
weekly Sunday morning service
led by the deans of Religious Life,
would welcome a visitor. In fact,
ideally the deans see this service as
a major part of students' spiritual
needs on campus. Just a few weeks
ago, the Hindu and Baha'i com
munities sponsored an interfaith
service.
It is not the fault of the Uni
versity, the ORL or the Religious
Studies Department that stu

dents are not engaged in reli
gious dialogue. The fault for
those not engaged in religious di
alogue on campus is their own.
You cannot assume the dialogue
is not happening just because you
have not made yourself a part of
it. We at Stanford love to praise
our diversity, but diversity is not
just being able to cite the per
centage breakdown of students
based on race, origin or religion.
This campus is widely diverse in
that there are cultural, religious
and ethnic centers; there are
events designed to spark conver
sation and dialogue; and there
are students waiting to be asked
about what drives them.
The problem is that we as a
community do not actively engage
in our diversity. We need more di
alogue, but this is not a failing of
any office or the availability of
programs. This is our failing —
and yours — for not taking advan
tage of resources that are already
available. For example, the Al

liance for Interfaith Dialogue does
not yet have a strong Muslim,
Sikh, Buddhist, Mormon, or
Zoroastrian voice. It is our respon
sibility to reach out and reverse
this personal failure, and we would
love to have you come and share
your voice with us. Contact Rev
erend Elena Larssen
(elarssen@stanford.edu) and ask
her about the interfaith retreat
happening in the spring. Talk to
the Office of Multicultural Educa
tion about sponsoring a religious
dialogue in your dorm once a
week.
Religious life on this campus is
rich, varied and visible. You sim
ply have to look. Please don't tell
us that our religious community is
not active, because religious life at
Stanford has been an integral part
of our education.

led by the deans of Religious Life,
would welcome a visitor. In fact,
ideally the deans see this service as
a major part of students' spiritual
needs on campus. Just a few weeks
ago, the Hindu and Baha'i com
munities sponsored an interfaith
service.
It is not the fault of the Uni
versity, the ORL or the Religious
Studies Department that stu

dents are not engaged in reli
gious dialogue. The fault for
those not engaged in religious di
alogue on campus is their own.
You cannot assume the dialogue
is not happening just because you
have not made yourself a part of
it. We at Stanford love to praise
our diversity, but diversity is not
just being able to cite the per
centage breakdown of students
based on race, origin or religion.
This campus is widely diverse in
that there are cultural, religious
and ethnic centers; there are
events designed to spark conver
sation and dialogue; and there
are students waiting to be asked
about what drives them.
The problem is that we as a
community do not actively engage
in our diversity. We need more di
alogue, but this is not a failing of
any office or the availability of
programs. This is our failing —
and yours — for not taking advan
tage of resources that are already
available. For example, the Al

liance for Interfaith Dialogue does
not yet have a strong Muslim,
Sikh, Buddhist, Mormon, or
Zoroastrian voice. It is our respon
sibility to reach out and reverse
this personal failure, and we would
love to have you come and share
your voice with us. Contact Rev
erend Elena Larssen
(elarssen@stanford.edu) and ask
her about the interfaith retreat
happening in the spring. Talk to
the Office of Multicultural Educa
tion about sponsoring a religious
dialogue in your dorm once a
week.
Religious life on this campus is
rich, varied and visible. You sim
ply have to look. Please don't tell
us that our religious community is
not active, because religious life at
Stanford has been an integral part
of our education.

While we agree that the need
lor religious dialogue on campus,
as expressed by The Daily's edito
rial on Feb. 23("Campus needs
more religious dialogue"), is an in
tegral part of developing a rich
and diverse campus atmosphere,
the claim that there is a "dearth of
religious discourse" is rooted in
the type of misunderstanding to
ward actively engaging in diversity
that often characterizes our cam
pus.
We do need to talk about reli
gion and make it a topic that can
be discussed comfortably, and, at
the same time, recognize the value
and importance of facing the diffi
cult and uncomfortable topics. But
do not look any further than your
self to place responsibility for not
being a part of the conversation.

As two students who worked to
found and lead the Alliance for In
terfailh Dialogue under the Office
of Religious Life, or ORL, and the
ASSU this year, please let us share
with you some avenues for explor
ing religious discourse.
The 2004-2005 brochure put
out by the Office of Religious Life
is easily available to every student
in hard copy or on the Internet and
is given to every freshman at Ori
entation. It not only lists all avail
able worship opportunities at
Stanford, it presents the Alliance
for Interfaith Dialogue as the first
of many listed student groups. The
editorial board remarked that
there is a pressing need for in
creased understanding of Islam,
and we absolutely agree — this is
why MSAN sponsors a series of
dinners on subjects like Women in
Islam (Sundays, to 8 p.m. in the
Bechtel International Center). If
you want to jump in further, go to
the Islamic Society at Stanford's
prayers in the Clubhouse Ball
room Fridays at noon. Hillel will
welcome any student of any back
ground at Shabbat services on Fri
days at the Ziff Center at 6:30 p.m.
Any of the many Christian com
munities on campus, including the
weekly Sunday morning service
led by the deans of Religious Life,
would welcome a visitor. In fact,
ideally the deans see this service as
a major part of students' spiritual
needs on campus. Just a few weeks
ago, the Hindu and Baha'i com
munities sponsored an interfaith
service.
