Give organs to organ donors first
Regarding The Daily's article "Author sup
ports organ donation" (Feb. 23), more than
half of the people who need an organ trans
plant in the United States die before they get
one. Most of these deaths are needless. Amer
icans bury or cremate thousands of life-saving
organs every year. Over 6,(XX) of our neighbors
suffer and die needlessly every year as a result.
There is a simple solution to the organ
shortage — give organs first to people who
have agreed to donate their own organs
when they die.
Giving organs first to organ donors will
convince more people to sign donor cards. It
will also make the organ allocation system
fairer. About 70 percent of the organs trans

planted in the United States go to people
who haven't agreed to donate their own or
gans when they die. People who are too lazy
or too selfish to register as organ donors
shouldn't be eligible for transplants as long
as there is a shortage of organs.
Anyone who wants to donate their organs
to others who have agreed to donate theirs
can join Life Sharers. Life Sharers is a non
profit network of organ donors who agree to
offer their organs first to other organ donors
when they die. They do this through a form
of directed donation that is legal in all 50
states and under federal law. Anyone can

Harvard president's statements do not
threaten women
I was surprised to learn that University
President John Hennessy has joined the cir
cus of media frenzy around I larvard I Jniver
sity President Lawrence Summers by putting
out a statement chiding Summers over his re
marks about women. It seems that this is po
litical correctness gone slightly overboard,
and I would like to bring up a couple of issues
for discussion.
First, I find it hard to believe that
women in this country are so unsure of
themselves that they find any statement
that merely suggests "innate differences"
between men and women threatening. I his
is especially surprising in the case of female

Harvard professors — these are educated,
articulate women who are teaching at one
of the best universities in the country. Ob
viously, they are the example that women
can succeed in sciences, and Summers was
not even claiming to present the absolute
truth, it was a much more general state
ment. For instance, saying that, on the av
erage, men are physically stronger than
women does not mean that there can't be
extremely powerful women. It's the "on the
average" bit that may indeed be true.
Second. I've also heard criticism of Sum
mers in the media that stated that only four
out of 32 tenure offers from Harvard last
year went to women. I am afraid I disagree
with the way this is phrased. If the case was
that a highly qualified female did not get the

job because it was offered to an average male
applicant, I'd be up at arms — that would in
deed be discrimination. However, it is tough
to tell if this was the case and the facts are
worth checking out to see is the criticism is
warranted.
As a final note, former world chess cham
pion Garry Kasparov who came to speak at
Stanford several years ago, pretty much re
peated Summer's remarks when he was
asked why he thinks there has not been a fe
male world chess champion yet.
Does anyone really think that because of
his remarks girls will stop playing chess? 1 bet
the girls are tougher than that.
