# Counting Sheep
## Question everything — what's more patriotic? 
### 
"Dear Mr. Leifer: Too good to fight for
your country, huh? Never mind. If need be, I
suspect we can make do without you."
"Dear Mr. Smith:... So if you ask if I'm
too good to fight for my country, I'd say no. I
am, however, too good to blindly follow and
not question, the very principle that makes
this nation great. I'm extremely sorry you
have forgotten this."
"Sir: You are a silly young man, full of
your own self-importance, blinded by your
own intellect. Perhaps we can continue this
conversation when you've grown up. Best of
luck to you."
Thus went my e-mail exchange with a re
spondent from Granbury, Texas, regarding
my previous column ("Selective Service,
Feb. 18). This was by far the most civil re
joinder I received. (I stopped responding
when I received four additional angry letters
within as many minutes.) I began to wonder
how I had erred so dramatically as to so
deeply offend the characteristically liberal
Cardinal community—l mean, these are
the people who read The Daily, right?
Later, I discovered that Freeßepublic.com,

which describes itself as
"the premiere online
gathering place for inde
pendent, grassroots con
servatism on the Web,"
had picked up my column,
re-titling it "Selective Ser
vice (the rarefied air of
elite colleges)." Following
the text — which taken
out of the context of a col
lege newspaper is already

vulnerable to misinterpretation — is a mes
sage-board dedicated to disparaging a "duplic
itous, whining pussy" (me).
At first, as is evident in my initial respons
es, I felt an intense desire to convince this un
expected conservative readership that just
because I oppose registering for the draft
doesn't mean that I'm an uppity egomaniac
who considers himself too good to defend his
rights. I have come to realize, however, that
these people engage in a practice that I my
self have often been guilty of: unwillingness
to listen to the other side.
"They'll leave the fighting to the under

privileged patriots in the non-elite universi
ties, community colleges and common high
schools. People such as Liefer (sic) are just
too good to risk ..."
That posting, in my opinion, best sums up
the attitude of said liberal-bashing message
board. There are other equally telling pas
sages, but they're not exactly "fit to print."
(See for yourself at http://www.freerepub
lic.com/focus/f-news/1347418/posts#com-
ment.) It is the specific posting above, how
ever. to which 1 would like to respond.
Even though Freeßepublic.com likely
won't publish this column — and thus I will
not reach the very audience I desire to rebut
— I think it's necessary to restate my posi
tion, as it is entirely possible that the exact
opposite of what I intended was deduced
from last week's article.
One of my primary reasons for opposing
the draft — or needing to register for it — is its
inherent inequality. 1 would be the first to con
tend that it is privileged young men (not just
those in elite colleges) that have historically
been able to avoid fighting in foreign wars —
as exemplified during the latter half of the 20th

century, especially in President George W.
Bush's case. It is indeed the underprivileged,
the uneducated and, in many cases, the mi
norities who end up fighting these wars.
These people, however, are not the ones
who will our nation to war — it is the privi
leged ones in Washington who know full well
that their sons will slip through the loopholes.
Even though it's only my personal interpreta
tion of current events, I subscribe to the no
tion that the disenfranchised would sooner in
vest $87 billion in their ailing communities
than engage in a wild goose hunt in Iraq.
That brings me to my second, equally mis
interpreted point — one that permeates
socio-economic standing and cuts directly to
morality. To be blunt, I am wholly opposed
to America's current war in Iraq, and I refuse
to see that as an unpatriotic stance. Is not a
true American patriot he who relentlessly
questions the actions of his leaders? Don't
take my word for it, though — take Ben
jamin Franklin's: "It is the first responsibility
of every citizen to question authority."
Even if the war is precisely what the Bush
administration would have the nation believe

— namely a fight for the extension of freedom
(a convenient hack-up after the non-discov
ery of weapons of mass destruction) — I must
dissent. How can we claim to be ambassadors
of freedom abroad if 11 states just ratified
amendments limiting the freedom of men and
women to marry whom they love?
When I say that I am unwilling to fight to
defend our freedoms, it is not because I be
lieve that I am "too good to fight for my
country." I am opposed to registering for the
draft (even if that draft never sees the light of
day) because judging by the war in Iraq, I
don't believe that future wars that may ne
cessitate a draft will actually be fought in de
fense of our rights. And even if they are, I am
less and less convinced that these rights are,
in fact, universal within our own nation.
Oh, and by the way, 1 did register for the
draft after all.

Kalani finds it interesting that when his friend
tried to participate in "Free" Republic's mes
sage-board, his comments were "Removed by
Moderator" and his membership was revoked.
