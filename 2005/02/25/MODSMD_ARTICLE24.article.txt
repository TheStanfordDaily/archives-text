## The 						Daily and rock journalists are sexist 
### BONNIE JOHNSON 
1 have covered music for almost every issue of
The Daily's weekly Intermission section this year,
and one of my projects has been to draw attention
to the music of Stanford students and graduates.
Last week I submitted an article on two new cam
pus bands, with a suggested headline. But the edi
tors of the issue chose their own title, which ran in
the print version of Intermission: "How to sleep
your way to groupie glory" (Feb. 18).
I confronted the editors about the title, letting
them know that I found it inappropriate, insulting
and sexist, whether or not they had intended it to
refer to me. They admitted that they made a poor
choice, apologized to me and promised to be more
thoughtful in the future. But I think that this inci
dent raises some important issues about sexism in

music journalism and rock music generally.
Rock music is a male-dominated genre, not
because there are more men than women in it,
but because women's music has consistently
been undervalued, underpublicized and ignored
or not taken seriously by label executives, pro
moters, critics and male musicians. The feminist
criticism that "women have been hidden from
history" applies to many areas; rock music is one
of them.
The same is true of rock journalism. The indus
try tends to treat music writing as a men's club,
and some of the most acclaimed rock critics, like
Nick Tosches, have been unabashed misogynists.
These efforts to make rock the exclusive province
of men mean that women are left to be groupies,
and that any women in the scene are immediately
stereotyped as such. 1 can rarely dance at a show

or express enthusiastic admiration fora male rock
musician without hearing someone throw the
word around.
Would my editors have considered the same
headline had the article's author been a man or
had the bands featured been comprised primarily
of women? It seems unlikely.
The continuing influence of this pervasive,
often subconscious sexism is why 1 take special
care to represent female and male musicians in
equal numbers in my journalism, as well as in my
DJ sets and on the compilation CDs I make for my
friends and family. I also play in a rock band in
which four of the five members are women. We
welcome groupies of all genders.
