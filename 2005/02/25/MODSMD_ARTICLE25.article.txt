## A BALANCING ACT — THE LIFE OF A STANFORD ATHLETE
### EMMA VAUGHN STAFF WRITER 
In their black and red warm-up suits, athletes tend
to stand out on campus. This is not to say that they
don't mingle with the "regular" students in almost
every setting — alter all, we do take the same classes
and attend the same events.
But athletes have a certain aura following them
wherever they go. The distinction between athletes
and non-athletes is a part of life at Stanford.
But are there actual differences in the daily life of
athletes that sets them apart from non-athlete stu
dents? Yes.
There are the obvious scheduling differences. Ath
letes sometimes have to get up as early as 5:30 a.m. for
workouts and then attend class for the rest of the day
until their next three- to four-hour practice in the af
ternoon. As a result, they are often not able to start
schoolwork until after dinner.
"It can get really hectic," said junior water polo
player. Thomas Hopkins. "The sleep issue is definite
ly a factor. You learn how to manage pretty well with
less sleep because otherwise you just wouldn't get
things done."
Hopkins, a member of the national junior team,
has spent a good deal of the quarter in training both
on- and off-campus, which make catching up on
schoolwork and balancing all his activities even more
difficult.
This is a common obstacle fora number Stanford
athletes. Many have been asked to join national and
Olympic teams, which often requires being away
from campus for extended periods of time
Men's soccer player Andrew Kartunen, a junior,
has been traveling with the U.S. national team for the
majority of this winter quarter and has found that sac
rifices are a necessary part of his daily lite.
"You have to make a lot of choices, both in social
relationships and academics," Kartunen said. "I've
started to realize that my academic performance is in
evitably going to drop right now, and I'm just not
going to see my friends as much."
Yet as exhausting as this sounds, many athletes
said they feel that their rigorous schedules allow them

to utilize their few free time better than they would
otherwise.
"You get so much practice with time management
that everything ends up being okay," said women's
tennis player Amber Liu. a junior. "The more free
time you have, the more time you end up wasting."
This is also the case with their social lives. Al
though many athletes have to limit the amount of
time they spend partying and going out, they tend to
cherish the time that they do have to socialize.
"This is one thing that really ties athletes togeth
er," said sailing team member Andy Mesher, a senior.
"We really appreciate our free moments on campus.
When we're around and have free time, we know how
to treasure it."
For the most part, athletes acknowledge that cer
tain choices and sacrifices are part of the job descrip
tion. Many are not able to go abroad or pursue other
serious school activities, but many said that it is well
worth it.
"Yes, we have to make sacrifices, but that's what
we signed up for," said women's volleyball player
Lizzie Suiter, a sophomore. "It's like those celebrities
who complain about not having privacy. Why com
plain about the negative aspects when there are so
many positive ones?"
The team dynamic is another factor that enhances
the athlete identity, athletes said. Many students feel
that the relationships they share with teammates and
other athletes are connections that they could not find
elsewhere.
"It is definitely easier to relate to people in a team
setting," said freshman skier Cassidy Deline, also a
reporter for The Daily. "There isn't the typical Stan
ford mentality of 'I'm going to schedule in a time to
have fun." Everyone on the team is more laid back
and shares the same appreciation for the sport."
In regards to academics and career plans. Stanford
athletes do not differ very much from the average
Stanford student. They share the same anxieties over
internships, grad schools and job opportunities. The
difference is that their respective sports often provide
them with a viable alternative for the immediate fu
ture.
"I actually go back and forth between those two

choices a lot." said
Hopkins. "1 think
that's really com
mon for athletes.
We have to ask our
selves questions
like, 'Do I want to
make a run for the
Olympics or do I
want to start pursu
ing a career?'"
Liu, who has won
the NCAA singles
title for the past two
years, is currently
deciding between
joining the profes
sional tennis circuit
and accepting a
sought-after sum
mer internship at
Goldman Sachs.

"I feel like I'm rob
bing myself if I don't go
pro at some point," Liu

J/.W Ml pW.I.V,
said. "But I'm not like a
lot of the girls on the tour.

I'm really career-oriented. I
don't want to play tennis until
I'm 30 and then become a tennis

coach."
Some athletes said they feel that
their dedication to a sport in college ac
tually hinders their opportunities in the fu-

ture. By focusing so intensely on their sport,
they are not able to pursue many other activities and
positions on campus that could be beneficial for the

future.
"People in the professional world often have neg
ative images of athletes," Suiter said. "They treat you
like an idiot because they assume that you got into
Stanford for your sport. And I have no tangible way
to refute that because my resume basically only reads
'varsity athlete.'"
Athletes in all sports struggle with this kind of

stereo
typing, but they learn to deal with it.
"My sport is a part of my identity, but it's not who
I am." said sophomore water polo player and junior
national team member. Meridith McColl. "I person
ally don't think of myself as 'different' from other stu
dents. Stanford is a place that strives for tolerance and
acceptance along race, gender and other social lines.
Why should we try to delineate between athletes and
non-athletes?"
