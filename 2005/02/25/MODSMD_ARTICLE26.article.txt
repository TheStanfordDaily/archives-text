# Row kitchens inspected
## 
### XIN XIE STAFF WRITER 
At first glance, a casual observer
might not notice any obvious
changes in the kitchens in Row hous
es. But according to Imogen Hinds,
manager of Undergraduate Housing
Operations, two new Santa Clara
County Health Inspectors have re
cently been appointed to make sure
on-campus kitchens are up to code.
"Student Housing and the coun
ty's primary focus is on ensuring that
safe food-handling practices are tak
ing place in our residences," Hinds
said. "It is part of our on-going opera
tions to meet the requirements put in
place by new health codes and to
make any needed upgrades or
changes."
The health inspectors will not be
patrolling the kitchens on a daily
basis.
"Each of the Row house kitchens
are inspected by the county once a
quarter with follow-up visits if need
ed," Hinds said. "Housing inspec
tors work with their kitchen man
agers to correct any violations."
Hinds said she believes that the
new housing inspectors will be un
derstanding and cooperative.
"So far this year we feel that we
have begun a good partnership with
the new inspectors and anticipate
that this will continue to develop in a
positive fashion," Hinds said. "The
new county inspectors are aware of

how the daily operation of a student
managed kitchen differs from a
restaurant kitchen and are inspect
ing our kitchens with that in mind."
However, some students have ex
pressed concern about the strictness
of the new health inspectors. En
chanted Broccoli Forest's recent
failure of its first inspection conduct
ed by the new officials has only
served to heighten these concerns.
"The new kitchen managers will
probably be harder and tougher,"
said senior Tee Sing Tang, kitchen
manager at Phi Kappa Psi. a frater
nity house.
Senior Ethan Cantil-Voorhees,
kitchen manager at Haus Mitteleu
ropa, echoed this sentiment.
"Some of the things that were ac
ceptable in the past may no longer be
acceptable," he said.
Some kitchen managers said they
think the new housing inspectors
may be strict because they may not
understand the difference between a
restaurant and a student-operated
kitchen.
"There is a higher level of re
sponsibility in a student-operated
kitchen than in restaurants, which
are generally operated according to
the minimum safety levels," Cantil-
Voorhees said.
Kitchen managers said they intend
to take extra security measures to en
sure that there will be no violations.
"We will be more careful about
making sure that stuff in the refriger

ator cannot fall or spill," said senior
Hannah Leslie, kitchen manager at
Kairos, a co-operative house.
"We have to check that our food
is covered in tight containers," Tang
added.
Moreover, some kitchen man
agers have said that they would re
train residents in hashing responsi
bilities or would revert to cleaning
the kitchen everyday after meals.
"We will probably change our
practices because before many peo
ple did not see the need to label
dates on containers because they
would be thrown out every Sunday
when we have a large cleanup," Can
til-Voorhees said. "Now we will em
phasize the need to mark the dates
on all containers."
Hinds agreed with the kitchen
managers that getting new inspec
tors will not take away the pride that
students take in maintaining a clean
kitchen themselves.
"Student Housing has always
taken the enforcement of the health
code within the student-managed
kitchens very seriously and will con
tinue to do so with the new inspec
tors," Hinds said. "There has not
been a kitchen shut down in at least
the past 15 years and as long as there
is not due cause fora shut down the
county would not take this action."
Although the Enchanted Broc
coli Forest failed the most recent in
spection, its kitchen was not shut
down.

probably be harder and tougher,"
said senior Tee Sing Tang, kitchen
manager at Phi Kappa Psi. a frater
nity house.
Senior Ethan Cantil-Voorhees,
kitchen manager at Haus Mitteleu
ropa, echoed this sentiment.
"Some of the things that were ac
ceptable in the past may no longer be
acceptable," he said.
Some kitchen managers said they
think the new housing inspectors
may be strict because they may not
understand the difference between a
restaurant and a student-operated
kitchen.
"There is a higher level of re
sponsibility in a student-operated
kitchen than in restaurants, which
are generally operated according to
the minimum safety levels," Cantil-
Voorhees said.
Kitchen managers said they intend
to take extra security measures to en
sure that there will be no violations.
"We will be more careful about
making sure that stuff in the refriger

ator cannot fall or spill," said senior
Hannah Leslie, kitchen manager at
Kairos, a co-operative house.
"We have to check that our food
is covered in tight containers," Tang
added.
Moreover, some kitchen man
agers have said that they would re
train residents in hashing responsi
bilities or would revert to cleaning
the kitchen everyday after meals.
"We will probably change our
practices because before many peo
ple did not see the need to label
dates on containers because they
would be thrown out every Sunday
when we have a large cleanup," Can
til-Voorhees said. "Now we will em
phasize the need to mark the dates
on all containers."
Hinds agreed with the kitchen
managers that getting new inspec
tors will not take away the pride that
students take in maintaining a clean
kitchen themselves.
"Student Housing has always
taken the enforcement of the health
code within the student-managed
kitchens very seriously and will con
tinue to do so with the new inspec
tors," Hinds said. "There has not
been a kitchen shut down in at least
the past 15 years and as long as there
is not due cause fora shut down the
county would not take this action."
Although the Enchanted Broc
coli Forest failed the most recent in
spection, its kitchen was not shut
down.
