The coming September, the Arrilla
ga Family Recreation Center, current
ly under construction next to the Ford
Center, will he ready to greet students
returning for the 2005-06 academic
year.
The new athletic facility will house
basketball, squash, tennis courts,
weight-training, indoor climbing walls,
aerobic-cardio rcx>ms and an academic
research center to support Stanford
athletes.
Before construction was initiated,
many students on campus complained
about overcrowding and the restricted
hours of the athletic facilities. To ad
dress these needs, the Stanford Athlet
ic Department began construction on
the fitness center last July.

"Our gym is so crowded during
weekday afternoons, especially from 5
to 7 p.m.," said junior Jenny Coolidge,
who works at the gym in Tresidder
Union. "Students often complain
about having to wait for treadmills and
step-masters. The new gym is definitely
long overdue."
One student working out at the
Tresidder gym said that he would like
there to be more treadmills available
for all students on campus.
Although the new center will be
open for varsity athletes, it will main
ly be used for intramural, club and
recreational sports. The lower floor
will accommodate an academic re
source center, a sports clinic for reha
bilitation services, a fencing area and
a weight room containing at least ten
cardio machines.

The ground floor will be home to a
cardio-aerobics studio, an indoor
climbing wall, seven squash courts and
three brand-new basketball courts,
much resembling those of Ford Center.
According to David Schinski, the
operations manager overseeing the fit
ness center's construction, the build
ing's groundwork and the erection of
beams for wall fixtures have both been
completed.
The building was designed by the
Hoover Associates, and the construc
tion is being handled by Vance Brown
Inc., the company that built the Maples
Pavilion Center.
The Arrillaga Family Recreation
Center construction site is located next
to the Ford Center, on Campus Drive,
and is expected to open in September,
2005.
