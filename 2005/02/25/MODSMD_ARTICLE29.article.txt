# Bechtel hosts photo show
## 
### ANDREW BURMON 
Photographers Joy and Bob Rewick see
the world as the sum of abstract details, a
view they have illustrated in their photogra
phy exhibit "Metals and Petals," now on
display in Stanford's Bechtel International
Center.
The name of the show is derived from
the two main subjects of the photographs —
classic cars and flowers, all photographed
throughout the Bay Area. While the sub
jects may seem incongruous, combining
them in the exhibit creates "the right union
of line, shape, color, and form." Joy Rewick
said.
The images in the exhibit are all magnifi
cations of subjects and exemplify macro
photography. In this artistic discipline, pho
tographers take pictures of small objects
up-close. According to the couple, their
passion for macro-photography is inspired
by the dynamic nature of light's interplay
with the subjects of the photos.
Both photographers said that the photo
shooting process for the exhibit involved
creating a unique photo bracket with two
flashes, calibrated to perfect the exposure
of each negative. The pictures capture not
only objects, but also fleeting moments in
history. The Rewicks said that most of the
time, they cannot predict how the product
of their efforts will appear. Rather, they
simply have to wait until the film is devel

oped. One image in the exhibit captures
a painted flame as it extends across a car
hood's smooth chrome surface. In another
photograph, tulip stamen reach upward out
of a cushion of purple petals. The two pic
tures, though strikingly different, use com
mon movement of color and drama of line,
the photographers said.
"Your greatest compliment will come
when someone looks at your photo and
says, This is a great abstract design,' " Bob
Rewick said.
The duo has been pursuing their interest
in photography for the last 17 years. Joy is
currently an administrative associate in
Stanford's department of philosophy, but is
also an avid photographer and writer on the
side.
According to the couple's website, Joy
has published photo essays in magazines
such as "Photo Techniques" and "Shutter
bug."
Bob is a physical-inorganic research
chemist, and said he combines his expertise
in physics, light and chemistry with his art.
His photo essays have appeared in the mag
azines "Camera & Darkroom," "Popular
Photography" and "Nature Photographer."
"Metals and Petals," which spans two
rooms of the Bechtel Center, was brought
in to enhance the space, said John Pearson,
director of the center.
The exhibit will remain on display until
March 15.
