### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
After last week's release of Prof. Richard Cot
tle's "Stanford Street Names: A Pocket Guide,"
Stanford student tour guides may find themselves
with some additional homework to do.
The 80-page handbook offers unique perspec
tives on Stanford history by uncovering the ways in
which local events, national ideologies and person
al sagas contributed to the naming of most roads on
the Farm The facts that Cottle uncovered could
add extra spunk to the guides? routines as they lead
flocks of prospective students and anxious parents
around the University.
"1 think it?s something that the tour guides
ought to be informed of," Cottle said of the content
of his book. "It's something they could throw into
their spiel."
Stanford tour guides, however, are not the only
audience that Cottle hopes to target.
I Ie said that the pocket-guide will also be useful
for visitors and on-campus residents and can be a
perfect gift for alumni, faculty, staff, students and
California history enthusiasts.
" Thanks to Dick Cottle's thorough research,
those who are interested in the University's history
and campus development now have a wonderful
new resource," said Susan Schofield, president of
the Stanford Historical Society.
('urrently an emeritus professor of management
science and engineering, Cottle has been a member
of the Stanford faculty since 1966 and has lived on
campus since 1969. He said that the inspiration to
investigate the origins of Stanford street names
came to him as he was walking down Panama
Street in 1992.
"Why the name Panama?" Cottle said he asked
himself. "No other streets made reference to re
mote geographic locations, so that really got me
going."
