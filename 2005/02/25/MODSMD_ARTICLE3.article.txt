# Cryptic street signs explained
## Prof, studies campus streets 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
After last week's release of Prof. Richard Cot
tle's "Stanford Street Names: A Pocket Guide,"
Stanford student tour guides may find themselves
with some additional homework to do.
The 80-page handbook offers unique perspec
tives on Stanford history by uncovering the ways in
which local events, national ideologies and person
al sagas contributed to the naming of most roads on
the Farm The facts that Cottle uncovered could
add extra spunk to the guides? routines as they lead
flocks of prospective students and anxious parents
around the University.
"1 think it?s something that the tour guides
ought to be informed of," Cottle said of the content
of his book. "It's something they could throw into
their spiel."
Stanford tour guides, however, are not the only
audience that Cottle hopes to target.
I Ie said that the pocket-guide will also be useful
for visitors and on-campus residents and can be a
perfect gift for alumni, faculty, staff, students and
California history enthusiasts.
" Thanks to Dick Cottle's thorough research,
those who are interested in the University's history
and campus development now have a wonderful
new resource," said Susan Schofield, president of
the Stanford Historical Society.
('urrently an emeritus professor of management
science and engineering, Cottle has been a member
of the Stanford faculty since 1966 and has lived on
campus since 1969. He said that the inspiration to
investigate the origins of Stanford street names
came to him as he was walking down Panama
Street in 1992.
"Why the name Panama?" Cottle said he asked
himself. "No other streets made reference to re
mote geographic locations, so that really got me
going."

Cottle soon learned that David
Starr Jordan, Stanford?s first presi
dent, was fascinated by California
history, which was largely influ
enced by Panama. After contacting
University archivists, poring over
maps and visiting campus and local
libraries, Cottle developed some
explanations.
"A plausible conjecture is that
the name highlights the important
jole played by the Isthmus of Pana
ma in the Gold Rush of California
as a popular shortcut bypassing
Cape Horn," Cottle wrote in his
book. "The opening of the Panama
■Canal in 1914 further simplified
and speeded up the transcontinen
tal journey. It is possible that San
Francisco's Panama-Pacific Expo
sition in 1915 gave additional moti
vation for the naming of this
street."
Cottle said that those roaming
campus began to refer to the street
as "Panama" around 1915, giving
further credibility to the book's hy
potheses.
While Cottle said he enjoyed the
research process for this and other
streets, investigating the history of
street-baptism on the Farm was no
picnic.
"It was just about impossible to
find actual records of decision
.making processes that lead to street
names," he said. "One can only
guess."
Nevertheless, Cottle said he
packed the most reasonable specu
lations into the guidebook, which is
a mere centimeter in thickness. It
covers over 140 street names, from
A to Z. We11...t0 W, since no street
names on campus start with X, Y or
Z
"I was really impressed by
Dick," said Laura Jones, a campus
archaeologist. "A lot of these
streets have been renamed, and he
just didn't give up. There is an as
tonishing amount of information."
Cottle received funding for his
project from the Offices of the Uni
versity President and Provost, the
Dean of Research, the Dean of En
gineering and the Dean of Earth
Sciences. And Cottle himself was
truly a volunteer in this endeavor —
he will not collect profits from the
book. Rather, the Stanford Histori
cal Society will use money made
from sales to print more copies.
Referring to the 10-plus years he

dedicated to researching and writ
ing the guide, Cottle said his time
was well-spent and that he thinks
the hook pays appropriate homage
to honorable figures in local, na
tional and campus history.
"Streets aren't usually named
after living people," Cottle said.

"So by the time streets are named,
the people have sometimes been
forgotten. I think that if you're
going to name a street after a per
son, you should make it possible for
others to know why that person was
worthy. This book is a tribute to
that philosophy."

"I was really impressed by
Dick," said Laura Jones, a campus
archaeologist. "A lot of these
streets have been renamed, and he
just didn't give up. There is an as
tonishing amount of information."
Cottle received funding for his
project from the Offices of the Uni
versity President and Provost, the
Dean of Research, the Dean of En
gineering and the Dean of Earth
Sciences. And Cottle himself was
truly a volunteer in this endeavor —
he will not collect profits from the
book. Rather, the Stanford Histori
cal Society will use money made
from sales to print more copies.
Referring to the 10-plus years he

dedicated to researching and writ
ing the guide, Cottle said his time
was well-spent and that he thinks
the hook pays appropriate homage
to honorable figures in local, na
tional and campus history.
"Streets aren't usually named
after living people," Cottle said.

"So by the time streets are named,
the people have sometimes been
forgotten. I think that if you're
going to name a street after a per
son, you should make it possible for
others to know why that person was
worthy. This book is a tribute to
that philosophy."

Ever wondered what the origins of these street names are? Pick up a copy of
Richard Cottle's book, "Stanford Street Names: A Pocket Guide," to find out.
After last week's release of Prof. Richard Cot
tle's "Stanford Street Names: A Pocket Guide,"
Stanford student tour guides may find themselves
with some additional homework to do.
The 80-page handbook offers unique perspec
tives on Stanford history by uncovering the ways in
which local events, national ideologies and person
al sagas contributed to the naming of most roads on
the Farm The facts that Cottle uncovered could
add extra spunk to the guides? routines as they lead
flocks of prospective students and anxious parents
around the University.
"1 think it?s something that the tour guides
ought to be informed of," Cottle said of the content
of his book. "It's something they could throw into
their spiel."
Stanford tour guides, however, are not the only
audience that Cottle hopes to target.
I Ie said that the pocket-guide will also be useful
for visitors and on-campus residents and can be a
perfect gift for alumni, faculty, staff, students and
California history enthusiasts.
" Thanks to Dick Cottle's thorough research,
those who are interested in the University's history
and campus development now have a wonderful
new resource," said Susan Schofield, president of
the Stanford Historical Society.
('urrently an emeritus professor of management
science and engineering, Cottle has been a member
of the Stanford faculty since 1966 and has lived on
campus since 1969. He said that the inspiration to
investigate the origins of Stanford street names
came to him as he was walking down Panama
Street in 1992.
"Why the name Panama?" Cottle said he asked
himself. "No other streets made reference to re
mote geographic locations, so that really got me
going."

Cottle soon learned that David
Starr Jordan, Stanford?s first presi
dent, was fascinated by California
history, which was largely influ
enced by Panama. After contacting
University archivists, poring over
maps and visiting campus and local
libraries, Cottle developed some
explanations.
"A plausible conjecture is that
the name highlights the important
jole played by the Isthmus of Pana
ma in the Gold Rush of California
as a popular shortcut bypassing
Cape Horn," Cottle wrote in his
book. "The opening of the Panama
■Canal in 1914 further simplified
and speeded up the transcontinen
tal journey. It is possible that San
Francisco's Panama-Pacific Expo
sition in 1915 gave additional moti
vation for the naming of this
street."
Cottle said that those roaming
campus began to refer to the street
as "Panama" around 1915, giving
further credibility to the book's hy
potheses.
While Cottle said he enjoyed the
research process for this and other
streets, investigating the history of
street-baptism on the Farm was no
picnic.
"It was just about impossible to
find actual records of decision
.making processes that lead to street
names," he said. "One can only
guess."

lations into the guidebook, which is
