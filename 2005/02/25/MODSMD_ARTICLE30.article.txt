## Jeff Dorman Sucks! How my fourth life faded away 
### 
If you're giving me nine, I'm on life number
five.
That's my count anyway, as best I can tell.
Alter a freak cinnamon-inhaling incident, a
candy-choking mistake and a Branner ski trip
bus crash, I should have been walking on
eggshells; if 1 keep facing scenarios like this one,
1 won't make it out of my 2()s.
It was the Atlantic Ocean. Last summer.
Family reunion.
Every summer, my lather's family descends
upon an Atlantic beach locale, spending a week
together in what seems to be a dying American
tradition. We have gone to Maine, Mas
sachusetts. Rhode Island, Maryland and both
Carolinas.all in an effort to appease the youngest
cousins and eldest uncles amongst us. Last sum-

mer, the destination was Nags
I lead, NC.., hut the timing was
unfortunate. Hurricanes were
dominating the nightly news
and they were all eyeing in on
us.
But this was a beach com
munity, and not even the
threat of spinning weather pat
terns eould keep me from my
annual week of bodyboarding,

supplying the sports relevancy to this column.
Now, I'm no Michael Phelps, and to tell the truth,
1 probably shouldn't be out there without some
sort of proper flotation device, but with the
board, I can hold my own in the surf. I'm no Kelly
Slater either, but I'm probably good enough to
swing a date with Pam Anderson.
But anyway, 1 went swimming with some of
my cousins, nothing serious or anything, and we
were hardly a few feet off the shore. But that's
where I let life number four slip away, on the
beach of Nag's Head, N.C. I was throwing a foot
ball into an oncoming wave, watching my 17-

year-old brother lay out into the surf
to make an improbable catch. I re
member trying to brush aside the pain
of my sore shoulder then, switching
with my brother to become the wide
receiver, diving over my little cousins
to get to the next throw.
Like I said, we weren't out too far.
Hurricane Alex was out to sea, which
was sending in massive waves — thick
walls of water rolling towards the
beach; it was really majestic actually.
But when I saw this young girl, she
couldn't have been more than twelve,
clinging to my cousin's bodyboard right
under the breakers, I didn't even think
of running to the lifeguard station.
Those five minutes of holding the
back of a stranger's one-piece were the
most terrifying of my life. My cousin
could hold her own. but the girl was in
creasingly non-responsive, her hands
slipping off the board as if she was ex

pecting the styrofoam to grab her, but it
was me after each wave who yanked
her head above water. Every few sec
onds a new wall would come, force us
under and watch us struggle back to the
surface. It was just an overwhelming
sense of dread — not only would she
die, but she was going to drag me down
with her. To tell the tnith, I'm not even
sure 1 felt the dread then; 1 was too busy
fighting my own death.
I couldn't tell you how many waves
we faced, ducking under each one be
cause 1 knew fighting it would take us
down harder. 1 couldn't tell you how
much water 1 swallowed, accidentally
breathing in cups at a time. I couldn't
tell you the name of the girl, couldn't
tell you the name of the surfer who
dragged her to shore, couldn't tell you
the lifeguard that eventually pulled
me in, too.
But 1 also couldn't tell you the
name of the man that drowned in the
same spot just hours later.
In the ocean, I still claim that I
saved that girl's life, at least for the few
minutes before the lifeguards saved
mine as well. It was the most danger

ous risk I had ever taken, a bad swim
mer with a bum shoulder hoping to
help in an already tenuous situation.
In the end, 1 probably shouldn't
have been out there in the first place,
but even the lifeguard admitted that
jumping in may not have been a *
decision — there was no telling how>.
long that girl could have lasted alone.
She had found herself in a rip current,
caused by specific sand
that channel the water in such a wdfy
that makes it nearly impossible to
swim back in. We were fortunate, and
only because of a quality lifeguard and
surfer am I writing this column.
So I'd like to thank all you lite
guards out there. All you rec pool at
tendants, altruistic surfers and water
polo players amongst us, thank you.
For me, my cousin and an anonymous
girl, thank you. The dedication to your
sport, job and skill legitimately saved
my life. Thank you.
