# Men down winless UCSD, 3-1
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's volleyball team should have
had an easy win against UC-San Diego last
night.
Alter all, the Tritons (0-14,0-13 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) are not
even ranked, while the Cardinal (6-9, 5-7
MPSF) is currently back at No. 9. And in
their previous meeting with UCSD. Stan
lord swept the Tritons.
That said, it was no surprise that Stan
ford coasted to a 30-20 win in game one,
and eventually won the match 3-1.
In the second game, UCSD came out
strong, jumping to a 3-0 lead. Stanford ral
lied to gain the advantage 5-4, but the Tri
tons refused to quit. The game stayed close
early, with a series of ties through 10-10.
"Defensively, we got a little sloppy in
game two," Stanford head coach Don
Shaw said. "I don't think UCSD played
better, but we didn't do a good job with our
digs and blocking in game two."
Though Stanford managed to maintain
the lead. UCSD stayed within a point or
two for the rest of the game. The Cardinal
finally closed out game two, 30-27.

"We hit g(x>d percentages those first two
games," Shaw said. "The closer score in
game two mostly had to do with our de
fense."
In game three, Stanford was looking for
the shutout, and the Tritons knew it. Fight
ing to stay in the match, UCSD seized a
two-point lead 1-3 and refused to give it
away. The entire game was a series of tie
points.
Freshman Jesse Meredith made his col
lege debut in the game. With senior Craig
Buell out sick, Shaw had to move freshman
Matt Ceran to middle blocker.
By the end of the match, Meredith had
recorded seven kills and two service aces.
At one point, telling his team to pull their
act together, Shaw yelled to the men on the
court, "Jesse's carrying you guys out
there!"
After the match, Meredith said with a
broad grin that he was feeling "awesome."
"[Coach Shaw] told me in the second
game, 'Jesse, get warmed up.' Starting the
third game, I was so nervous at first. But
after a couple of plays, after 1 got the first
swing in there, 1 got relaxed. The guys were
great, and it felt natural after a couple of
plays," he said.

However, even with the addition of
Meredith, the Cardinal could not gain con
trol of the match. They failed to capitalize
on a match point, then allowed the Tritons
two chances to win it, which they ultimate
ly did. With a 31-33 loss in game three,
Stanford was forced into a fourth game.
"We played really well as a team the
first two games, so we kind of got relaxed,"
Meredith said. "We should have beaten
them in the third game; we just didn't pull
it together."
With a renewed sense of determination,
the Cardinal jumped into game four with a
3-0 lead that prompted UCSD to take an
early timeout.
"Losing game three got us a little more
focused." Shaw said. "It's not that easy
when you've got a 2-0 lead against a team
that hasn't won a game yet this season.
The Cardinal doubled UCSD's score at
12-6. They maintained that sizeable advan
tage for the rest of the game, closing out the
match with a 30-23 win.
On Saturday, the Cardinal will return to
Burnham Pavilion to face No. 5 Long
Beach State (9-5,7-4 MPSF). Stanford fell
0-3 and 2-3 in the two matches against the
-Wers earlier this season.

games," Shaw said. "The closer score in
game two mostly had to do with our de
fense."
In game three, Stanford was looking for
the shutout, and the Tritons knew it. Fight
ing to stay in the match, UCSD seized a
two-point lead 1-3 and refused to give it
away. The entire game was a series of tie
points.
Freshman Jesse Meredith made his col
lege debut in the game. With senior Craig
Buell out sick, Shaw had to move freshman
Matt Ceran to middle blocker.
By the end of the match, Meredith had
recorded seven kills and two service aces.
At one point, telling his team to pull their
act together, Shaw yelled to the men on the
court, "Jesse's carrying you guys out
there!"
After the match, Meredith said with a
broad grin that he was feeling "awesome."
"[Coach Shaw] told me in the second
game, 'Jesse, get warmed up.' Starting the
third game, I was so nervous at first. But
after a couple of plays, after 1 got the first
swing in there, 1 got relaxed. The guys were
great, and it felt natural after a couple of
plays," he said.

However, even with the addition of
Meredith, the Cardinal could not gain con
trol of the match. They failed to capitalize
on a match point, then allowed the Tritons
two chances to win it, which they ultimate
ly did. With a 31-33 loss in game three,
Stanford was forced into a fourth game.
"We played really well as a team the
first two games, so we kind of got relaxed,"
Meredith said. "We should have beaten
them in the third game; we just didn't pull
it together."
With a renewed sense of determination,
the Cardinal jumped into game four with a
3-0 lead that prompted UCSD to take an
early timeout.
"Losing game three got us a little more
focused." Shaw said. "It's not that easy
when you've got a 2-0 lead against a team
that hasn't won a game yet this season.
The Cardinal doubled UCSD's score at
12-6. They maintained that sizeable advan
tage for the rest of the game, closing out the
match with a 30-23 win.
On Saturday, the Cardinal will return to
Burnham Pavilion to face No. 5 Long
Beach State (9-5,7-4 MPSF). Stanford fell
0-3 and 2-3 in the two matches against the
-Wers earlier this season.
