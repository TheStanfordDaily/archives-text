# Card return home to face No. 22 USC
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a post-practice talk with the coaching staff,
the Cardinal baseball team (7-5) rushes outside the
dugout into a bouncing, shouting muddle of red.
Above it all rises the voice of junior first baseman
John Mayberry Jr., sounding like the leader he's
been growing into all along.
"Here we go, guys," he tells his teammates, "We're
getting" better every day, better every day ..."
The Cardinal are hollering in agreement, know
ing, like Mayberry does, that the team's recent
struggles won't dictate where they will be in June. In
this game, if you've got to lose, do it early; if you're
going to falter, do it against good teams; if you stum
ble, learn from it and always keep your eyes focused
on the goal.
"Let's get an Omaha on three," Mayberry says.
"One. two, three — "
"OMAHA!"
The No. 13 Cardinal's recent road trips to Fuller
ton. Calif, and Texas have left the team with a 1-5
away record and a really good idea of the improve
ments that they need to start making.
"We played very poorly in all three aspects of the
game, fielding, hitting and pitching," junior south
paw Mark Romanczuk said of the team's pair of
road trips. "But I think the bright side of that is that
we were in all of those games; they were one- or two
run games. And to play that poorly and still be in the

tion. that just shows the potential
that this team will have once we start
playing as a cohesive unit."
Just as sometimes-sloppy play
didn't hold up against No. 3 Texas or
No. 4 Cal State Fullerton, fielding
errors and dormant bats won't help
the Cardinal this weekend, when the
team plays a non-conference series
against No. 22 Southern California
(4-0) at Sunken Diamond.
So, Stanford is taking a step-by
step approach to cleaning up its per
formance, fine-tuning its pitching
and jumpstarting its offense.
"We've gotten back to the ba
sics," Mayberry said. "We haven't
really played that well. We've had a
lot of blunders out there. We need to
get back to the fundamentals of the
game, you know, catch, throw, and I
think it'll be fine from there."
The Trojans, despite being
picked by the Pacific-10 Conference
coaches to finish fifth in the league,
are currently the only undefeated
squad left in the Pac-10 and
launched themselves into the na
tional polls this week. Rainy condi
tions in Southern California have
wreaked havoc on USC's schedule
— a series against Fullerton was cut
short earlier this week — but the
team has played well and collected
two wins over Long Beach State.
USC's baseball corps can scarce
ly be mentioned without remarking
on the men that make up what is
widely believed to be one ot the best

batteries in the college ranks —
sophomore righthander lan
Kennedy and junior backstop Jeff
Clement, both of whom played for
Team USA with Mayberry, Ro
manczuk and junior Jed Lowrie in
the summer.
Clement, who set the national
high school career record for home
runs, has had a slow start to the sea
son, hitting just .231 over the first
four contests. However, if the lowa
native ends up with a strong year, he
will be considered a possible first
round draft choice in June.
Kennedy, on the other hand, al
ready has nine strikeouts in just
seven frames on the mound. He also
had a strong outing against Fullerton
on Monday, but weather halted the
game in the eighth inning. Stanford
will see the righty in Saturday after
noon's contest -junior Zack Kalter
is slated for the series opener and the
Trojans have yet to name a third
starter.
"Kennedy's unique in that he's a
pitcher who throws predominantly
iastballs," Romanczuk said of his
summer teammate. "He relies on an
explosive fastball that he has excel
lent command of."
Added Mayberry: "I think he's
one of the few college pitchers that
can really work both sides of the
plate effectively. That's not easy to
do."
Stanford will counter with the
same rotation it's had for the past
two weeks: Romanczuk (2-2)
tonight, junior Jeff Gilmore (2-1) to
morrow and freshman Nolan Gal
lagher (0-1) on Sunday.
Tonight's game will kick off at 5
p.m.. while Saturday's and Sunday's
matchups will commence at I p.m.

lot of blunders out there. We need to
get back to the fundamentals of the
game, you know, catch, throw, and I
think it'll be fine from there."
The Trojans, despite being
picked by the Pacific-10 Conference
coaches to finish fifth in the league,
are currently the only undefeated
squad left in the Pac-10 and
launched themselves into the na
tional polls this week. Rainy condi
tions in Southern California have
wreaked havoc on USC's schedule
— a series against Fullerton was cut
short earlier this week — but the
team has played well and collected
two wins over Long Beach State.
USC's baseball corps can scarce
ly be mentioned without remarking
on the men that make up what is
widely believed to be one ot the best

batteries in the college ranks —
sophomore righthander lan
Kennedy and junior backstop Jeff
Clement, both of whom played for
Team USA with Mayberry, Ro
manczuk and junior Jed Lowrie in
the summer.
Clement, who set the national
high school career record for home
runs, has had a slow start to the sea
son, hitting just .231 over the first
four contests. However, if the lowa
native ends up with a strong year, he
will be considered a possible first
round draft choice in June.
Kennedy, on the other hand, al
ready has nine strikeouts in just
seven frames on the mound. He also
had a strong outing against Fullerton
on Monday, but weather halted the
game in the eighth inning. Stanford
will see the righty in Saturday after
noon's contest -junior Zack Kalter
is slated for the series opener and the
Trojans have yet to name a third
starter.
"Kennedy's unique in that he's a
pitcher who throws predominantly
iastballs," Romanczuk said of his
summer teammate. "He relies on an
explosive fastball that he has excel
lent command of."
Added Mayberry: "I think he's
one of the few college pitchers that
can really work both sides of the
plate effectively. That's not easy to
do."
Stanford will counter with the
same rotation it's had for the past
two weeks: Romanczuk (2-2)
tonight, junior Jeff Gilmore (2-1) to
morrow and freshman Nolan Gal
lagher (0-1) on Sunday.
Tonight's game will kick off at 5
p.m.. while Saturday's and Sunday's
matchups will commence at I p.m.
After a post-practice talk with the coaching staff,
the Cardinal baseball team (7-5) rushes outside the
dugout into a bouncing, shouting muddle of red.
Above it all rises the voice of junior first baseman
John Mayberry Jr., sounding like the leader he's
been growing into all along.
"Here we go, guys," he tells his teammates, "We're
getting" better every day, better every day ..."
The Cardinal are hollering in agreement, know
ing, like Mayberry does, that the team's recent
struggles won't dictate where they will be in June. In
this game, if you've got to lose, do it early; if you're
going to falter, do it against good teams; if you stum
ble, learn from it and always keep your eyes focused
on the goal.
"Let's get an Omaha on three," Mayberry says.
"One. two, three — "
"OMAHA!"
The No. 13 Cardinal's recent road trips to Fuller
ton. Calif, and Texas have left the team with a 1-5
away record and a really good idea of the improve
ments that they need to start making.
"We played very poorly in all three aspects of the
game, fielding, hitting and pitching," junior south
paw Mark Romanczuk said of the team's pair of
road trips. "But I think the bright side of that is that
we were in all of those games; they were one- or two
run games. And to play that poorly and still be in the

Just as sometimes-sloppy play
didn't hold up against No. 3 Texas or
No. 4 Cal State Fullerton, fielding
errors and dormant bats won't help
the Cardinal this weekend, when the
team plays a non-conference series
against No. 22 Southern California
(4-0) at Sunken Diamond.
So, Stanford is taking a step-by
step approach to cleaning up its per
formance, fine-tuning its pitching
and jumpstarting its offense.
"We've gotten back to the ba
sics," Mayberry said. "We haven't
really played that well. We've had a
