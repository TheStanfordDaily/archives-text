# Oregon State tops Stanford, 84-83
## Beavers' aggressive shooting beats Card 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — In an emotionally
and physically draining game, Oregon
State earned an 84-83 win over Stanford at
Gill Coliseum last night. The loss snapped
Stanford's 11-game win streak over the
Beavers and assured Oregon State its first
winning record during the regular season
since point guard Gary Payton roamed the
backcourt for the orange and black during
the 1989-40 season.
Stanford could have used some of Pay
ton's stifling defense to stop Oregon State
(15-11, 7-8 Pacific-10 Conference), which
shot 49 percent from the field and held-off
a frantic Cardinal rally to capture its 11th
win in 12 home games this season.
Senior forward David Lucas scored 21
points and grabbed a career-high 14 re
bounds to lead the Beavers.
The Cardinal, who had held their last
three opponents to 61 points per game —
seven points below their season average —
struggled to stay with Oregon State's re
volving door of guards in the first half.
Stanford's Pac-10 worst three-point de
fense took a hit in the first 20 minutes, as
the Beavers' backcourt repeatedly buried
deep shots from beyond the arc. Oregon
State knocked down six three-pointers en
route to a 43-34 halftime lead and finished
7-for-13 from long range.
"Oregon State shot the ball extremely
well tonight," head coach Trent Johnson
said. "It seemed like we were always play
ing catch up and they were aggressive and
played well."
In the second half, the Beavers looked
inside.
Lucas, who was limited to just four
points in 11 first-half minutes after picking

up his second personal foul at the 7:49 mark,
played with unmatched energy after the
break. The All-Pac-10 selection buried nine
of his 19 shots, burning the Cardinal after
establishing good position inside. He
grabbed six offensive rebounds to lead the
Beavers to a 44-37 advantage on the boards.
Lucas gave the Beavers their largest
lead of the game. 63-49 with 9:48 to play,
after he converted a baseline spin move on
junior forward Matt Haryasz into an easy
lay-up and got a one-hander to fall on con
secutive possessions.
But Stanford (15-10, 9-6) refused to go
quietly.
In a reversal of roles from when the
Cardinal squandered an 18-point lead be
fore prevailing in their 69-65 win over the
Beavers at home on Jan. 27, Oregon State
left the door open with a dreadful showing
at the charity stripe.
Lucas scored on an offensive putback
to put Oregon State ahead 76-70 but ju
nior point guard Chris Hernandez, com
ing off a career-high 37 points against
UCLA last week, drilled a three-pointer
to bring Stanford to within three with
1:25 to play.
Hernandez, who finished with 29
points, shot just 3-for-l 1 from beyond the
arc. He missed a potential game-tying
three-pointer with 15 seconds to play after
Beavers guard Lamar Hurd - a 30 percent
free throw shooter - made one of two free
throws on the other end to put Oregon
State ahead 83-80. The Beavers shot just
21-for-34 from the line.
"We couldn't make plays, more defen
sively than offensively," Hernandez said.
"We have to play better defense as a team."
"We battled and we made some good
plays down the stretch, but we just put
ourselves in a position where we ran
out of bodies," said Johnson, whose
depleted bench was outscored 32-5.
"ITie bottom line is at this time of
year you have to do the necessary
things to win games and OSU did a
better job of that tonight."
Oregon State turned the ball

over on four of its first five second
half possessions but Stanford con
verted just one of those into points
— a steal and an uncontested dunk
by senior forward Nick Robinson.
As he did against UCLA, Robin
son came alive offensively in the sec
ond half, scoring 11 of his 13 points in
the final 20 minutes. The senior de
livered the game's most crafty play
with Stanford trailing by four with 25
seconds to play.
With J.S. Nash at the free throw
line for two, Robinson stood incon
spicuously by the Stanford bench.

After Nash drained his second free
throw, Robinson had the ball in his
hands at the other end of the floor
before Oregon State realized he was
there. Robinson was fouled by De-
Witz as he knocked down a lay-up to
bring the Cardinal to within two but
missed the free throw and the re
bound was corralled by Hurd.
Haryasz overcame a rough start
to finish with 15 points and nine re
bounds. His first points of the game
came on an offensive putback as the
first-half buzzer sounded but he
scored 10 straight points to keep

Stanford close midway through the
second half.
Stanford travels to Eugene on
Saturday fora nationally televised
game against Oregon (13-11, 5-10).
The Ducks, who defeated Cal last
night, were shellacked by the Cardi
nal 88-69 on Jan. 29. Tip-off is sched
uled for 4 p.m.
"Realistically we needed to get
three of our last four, so now we have
to win out," said senior center Rob
Little, who finished with 10 points
and 10 rebounds. "Once again, we
need to go on a winning streak."
