# Oregon State tops Stanford, 84-83
## Beavers' aggressive shooting beats Card 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — In an emotionally
and physically draining game, Oregon
State earned an 84-83 win over Stanford at
Gill Coliseum last night. The loss snapped
Stanford's 11-game win streak over the
Beavers and assured Oregon State its first
winning record during the regular season
since point guard Gary Payton roamed the
backcourt for the orange and black during
the 1989-40 season.
Stanford could have used some of Pay
ton's stifling defense to stop Oregon State
(15-11, 7-8 Pacific-10 Conference), which
shot 49 percent from the field and held-off
a frantic Cardinal rally to capture its 11th
win in 12 home games this season.
Senior forward David Lucas scored 21
points and grabbed a career-high 14 re
bounds to lead the Beavers.
The Cardinal, who had held their last
three opponents to 61 points per game —
seven points below their season average —
struggled to stay with Oregon State's re
volving door of guards in the first half.
Stanford's Pac-10 worst three-point de
fense took a hit in the first 20 minutes, as
the Beavers' backcourt repeatedly buried
deep shots from beyond the arc. Oregon
State knocked down six three-pointers en
route to a 43-34 halftime lead and finished
7-for-13 from long range.
"Oregon State shot the ball extremely
well tonight," head coach Trent Johnson
said. "It seemed like we were always play
ing catch up and they were aggressive and
played well."
In the second half, the Beavers looked
inside.
Lucas, who was limited to just four
points in 11 first-half minutes after picking

up his second personal foul at the 7:49 mark,
played with unmatched energy after the
break. The All-Pac-10 selection buried nine
of his 19 shots, burning the Cardinal after
establishing good position inside. He
grabbed six offensive rebounds to lead the
Beavers to a 44-37 advantage on the boards.
Lucas gave the Beavers their largest
lead of the game. 63-49 with 9:48 to play,
after he converted a baseline spin move on
junior forward Matt Haryasz into an easy
lay-up and got a one-hander to fall on con
secutive possessions.
But Stanford (15-10, 9-6) refused to go
quietly.
In a reversal of roles from when the
Cardinal squandered an 18-point lead be
fore prevailing in their 69-65 win over the
Beavers at home on Jan. 27, Oregon State
left the door open with a dreadful showing
at the charity stripe.
Lucas scored on an offensive putback
to put Oregon State ahead 76-70 but ju
nior point guard Chris Hernandez, com
ing off a career-high 37 points against
UCLA last week, drilled a three-pointer
to bring Stanford to within three with
1:25 to play.
Hernandez, who finished with 29
points, shot just 3-for-l 1 from beyond the
arc. He missed a potential game-tying
three-pointer with 15 seconds to play after
Beavers guard Lamar Hurd - a 30 percent
free throw shooter - made one of two free
throws on the other end to put Oregon
State ahead 83-80. The Beavers shot just
21-for-34 from the line.
"We couldn't make plays, more defen
sively than offensively," Hernandez said.
"We have to play better defense as a team."
"We battled and we made some good
