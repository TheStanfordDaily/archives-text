Note to the Pacific-10 Conference: Don't
make No. 3 Stanford angry. On Thursday night,
the Cardinal (25-2, 16-1 Pac-10) avenged an
early-season loss to Oregon in a big way. humil
iating the Ducks 76-45 at Maples Pavilion.
Rarely does the No. 3 team in the country go
to the trouble of circling a home game against an
utiranked opponent. But make no mistake, the
Cardinal had looked forward to putting the
Ducks in their place since before New Year's.
"We weren't really aggressive when we
played up (in Oregon)." freshman Candice Wig
gins said. "We just wanted to come back and
show how much we've improved."
In the first meeting between these two teams,
on Dec. 29 in Eugene. Ore., the stars aligned for
the Ducks to pull off their biggest regular-season

victory in more than two decades. The last time
Oregon defeated a team ranked as high as then-
No. 5 Stanford was exactly 22 years before to the
day, in 1983.
Seniors Catherine Kraayeveld and Andrea
Bills combined for 34 points and 31 rebounds as
the Ducks erased a 14-point halftime deficit en
route to a shocking upset at McArthur Court.
On Thursday night, with just two home
games remaining for Stanford's Class of 2(X)5,
the Cardinal made sure to crush any thoughts of
a repeat performance.
How? Utter first-half domination, followed
by utter second-half domination, usually does
the trick.
Stanford found an unbelievable shooting
touch early, shooting 17-of-25 from the field and
5-of-7 from beyond the arc in the first half. The

Senior Azella Perryman chipped in eight points in the Cardinal's 76-45 dismantling of the Ore
gon Ducks. Stanford shot 62.5 percent in the contest.
Oregon shoots 29.2 percent in first half

Cardinal took a 5-3 lead on a Kelley Suminski three
point field goal just 2:18 into the game. From there,
the Cardinal simply hit the accelerator and never
looked hack.
Scoring both inside and out, Stanford pushed its
lead to 42-1S at the half.
When sophomore Brooke Smith and freshman
Candice Wiggins got into early foul trouble, head
coach Tara VanDerveer got ample production from
her bench. In all, eight different players scored for
Stanford in the first half.
Meanwhile. Oregon played as if there was a lid on
the basket. Just seven shots found the net for the
Ducks in the first half percent shooting), one
fewer than their eight turnovers and two fewer than
their nine personal fouls.
"Even though Stanford has wrapped up the Pac
-10 season, it seemed like the bounty was on our heads,
rather than the other way around." Oregon head
coach Bev Smith said. "We didn't handle it as well as
we would have liked to."
Tellingly, Bills and Kraayeveld went almost unno
ticed all night long. Kraayeveld, the seventh leading

scorer in the Pac-10, was held without a single point
for the game. In her 67 career starts, Kraayeveld has
never been held scoreless.
"To limit Kraayeveld to zero points is really saying
something," VanDerveer said. "(Smith) and [Azella
Perryman] played great defense, which is something
we really needed them to do."
After halftime, Stanford found another gear, if
that is possible.
VanDerveer's troops sensed a chance for revenge
and didn't let up. Over the first eight minutes of the
second half, the Cardinal put together a 24-2 run,
burying the Ducks, 66-20. Frighteningly, this was just
part of a larger 50-7 run that began at the 11:06 mark
in the first half.
It was a lead that created flashbacks to Stanford's
82-26 dismantling of Pacific way back in November.
But this wasn't UOP. The second-place team in the
Pac-10, Oregon is a likely NCAA Tournament team,
and had not lost by more than 16 before last night.
"We didn't really play that well [at Oregon],"
Smith said. "But we've come so far from where we
were at that point in the year, and I think this just

showed what an improvement we've made."
Unbelievably, Stanford's offense maintained its
brutal efficiency for all 40 minutes, as the Cardinal
shot 62.5 percent on the evening, the second-best
shooting night of the season. It was the highest shoot
ing percentage the Ducks have surrendered this year.
Wiggins and Smith led the way with 13 points
apiece, but Stanford also received 12 from sopho
more Kristen Newlin. Seniors Kelley Suminski, Seb
nem Kimyacioglu and A/.ella Perryman each added
eight points.
Stanford continued its torrid shooting from long
range, hitting 8 of 16 attempts from beyond the arc.
The Ducks' 45 points were a season low, as the
Cardinal's defense continued to pour on the pressure
all night long. When Oregon missed, its possessions
were short. Stanford hit the boards hard, winning the
rebounding battle 38-21.
Senior T'Nae Thiel left the game with an unspeci
fied injury to her left foot. She underwent x-rays, but
the severity of the injury is not yet known.
On Saturday, the Cardinal's seniors will play their
final home game against Oregon State at 2 p.m.
