# Men face Pac-10's best
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Since January's frustrating road trip through
Oregon, the Stanford wrestling team (6-7-1,2-5-1
Pacific-10 Conference) has known that the team's
talent and effort are not reflected in its record, as
injury forfeits have stolen victories away time and
again. The Cardinal have had two weeks to rest
and prepare fora unique opportunity at redemp
tion in the Pac-10 Championships.
"We are definitely going to Cal Poly to win the
tournament," head coach Steve Buddie said.
"Most casual observers would say that we are not
frontrunners by any means, but the conference is
so wide open this year, we honestly believe we can
do it. We haven't had our full lineup the entire
year, and just having our best 10 on the same trip
gives us a morale boost. Our guys deserve to win
it all."
The Cardinal head south to San Luis Obispo
where Cal Poly (5-12, 1-5) will host the champi
onships this weekend. The competition starts
Sunday at 11 a.m. and ends with the finals on Mon
day at 6 p.m.
The whole conference will compete, including
this year's favorite to win. No. 21 Arizona State
(11-6-1, 8-0), last year's champion No. 22 Boise
State (8-7,4-3), No. 20 Cal State-Bakersfield (13-
6,5-3), UC-Davis (6-5-1,4-4-1), Cal State-Fuller
ton (14-4-1, 5-2-1), Oregon (6-10, 3-6), Oregon
State (12-8-1,7-2-1) and Portland State (2-17,0-9).
Earning bonus points is key to team victory.

and team scoring is more complex than it is in a
dual meet. Advancing earns one team point.
Bonus points are awarded as follows: two points
fora pin, 1.5 points fora technical fall and 1 point
fora major decision. The tournament is double
elimination, so once a competitor has lost he en
ters the consolation bracket. In the one-loss
bracket, they can only earn .5 points for advanc
ing.
The biggest bonuses are given to those who
place in the top six. The champion earns 12 points,
runner-up wins 10, third gets eight and so on.
"The Pac-10 tournament is exciting for so
many reasons," Buddie said. "It's where wrestlers
can avenge early season losses, upsets happen;
every 15 minutes and athletes who had mediocre 1
seasons can turn everything around and make it
into the finals. For reasons like these, you can ab
solutely gain momentum as a team when a
wrestler gives you a spark."
Amid this chaos, all wrestlers are competing
for more than the Pac-10 title. The conference
gets 40 bids to the NCAA Tournament in St.
Louis. Thirty of those invites are given to the top
three finishers in every weight class. The remain
ing 10 are distributed at the discretion of the Pac
-10 coaches and will most likely be given out as
"wildcards." Those bids will go to the wrestlers
with the best shot to succeed, because a strong
showing in St. Louis will increase the number of
future bids that the Pac-10 gets.

The Stanford wrestlers head to San Luis Obispo this weekend with the goal of bringing home a conference crown.
The Cardinal's best bets for confer
ence champions come from its two
captains, senior Matt Gentry and ju
nior Imad Kharbush. Gentry is the de
fending Pac-10 and NCAA champion
at 157 pounds and is the number one
seed in the tournament. Stanford's
first NCAA champion in history has
only lost one match in the past two
seasons.
Kharbush is seeded third, which is
the same as last year. The junior is
hoping that his results will also be
identical, as the 174-pounder is the de
fending Pac-10 champion. Kharbush
will have an opportunity at redemp
tion himself as he lost to the No. 1 seed
Ron Silva in the last meet of this sea
son against UC-Davis.
Other Stanford place-winners
could come from anywhere, though
the 125, 149 and 165-pound weight
classes are exceptionally deep. Given
the inherent unpredictability of the

tournament, Stanford could realisti
cally place between two and eight
wrestlers.
In the gym, training for the Cardi
nal has been much more in depth in
the past two weeks than it has been in
previous months.
"During the regular season, it's
very difficult to focus on the starting
10, because as a coach, you want to see
everyone improving and you certainly
don't want to focus on one athlete
more than another when everyone is
fighting fora starting spot," Buddie
said. "Knowing that these 10 are the
ones representing us at the champi
onships allows us the freedom to focus
on them specifically, addressing some
details that will help them fine-tune
their performances."
Now that the wait fora second
chance is finally over, the Cardinal are
determined to prove themselves, no
matter what adversity faces them.
"I'd have to say we're basically
100 percent [healthy], and if we
weren't, 1 certainly wouldn't admit to
it," Buddie said. "There is no room
for excuses anymore, and the team is
ready to go."
