The five-year-old Stanford Triathlon team is led by
Stanford alumnus. Bean. Class of 2003. Bean played a
significant role in founding the Stanford Triathlon
Team in 2000 and also helped write the constitution.
Since receiving funding from the university in 2001, the
club team and sport has grown and become more pop
ular with undergraduates and graduate students each
year.
"It's a great team." Bean said, "It works really well
to have teammates at different lev
els of education who have different
sorts of experiences at Stanford
University."

benefits from a coach who has par
ticipated in both collegiate and
professional triathlons, including
the Ironman in Hawaii. Bean won
the 2002 Collegiate Nationals in
Triathlon, after originally being
considered disqualified for previ
ously competing at the profession
al level. The transition from athlete
to coach has not been too hard for
Bean because he understands what
it takes to be a triathlete.
"It's so much easier to know
what people need to do after expe
riencing it," Bean said. "I know
what's effective and what's not,
and it also helps to have an atten
tive team like the Cardinal."
One of Bean's attentive athletes
is senior Laura Sherman, who is
now co-director of the Treeathlon
event. Sherman and fellow co-di
rector Kendall Wu have been plan
ning the competition since last
May.
"It was a dream of mine to have
a race at Stanford, and I grabbed
the opportunity to help organize
the event," Sherman said.
The goal is for the Treeathlon to
be an annual event at Stanford, but
this year's must run successfully to
ensure a sequel.
"I'll be running around come
Sunday morning, but not in the
race." Sherman said.
Sherman is injured and will be
on the sidelines this weekend, but
plans to compete at Nationals. Al
though Sherman is not competing
now, she is glad to be a part of the
triathlon, a sport she s;iid is both
"exhilarating and makes you feel
alive."
As the gun goes off, a wave of water splashes out of
the pool, the crowd in the stands goes crazy and 40 anx
ious athletes begin the first leg of the triathlon.
This Sunday at 7:30 a.m., Stanford will host the
Treeathlon, the first ever triathlon competition to he
held on the Farm. The meet will begin at the Avery
Aquatic Center with a one-third mile swim, followed
by a 12-mile bike ride and a three-mile run that finish
es in the Stanford Football Stadium. Less than a
minute after their feet emerge from the pool, the ath
letes will change clothes in Arrillaga Plaza and begin
their bike ride and run through the marked course in
Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
The Treeathlon is a collegiate event for both men
and women and is also open to local community mem
bers. There will approximately be 240 athletes racing
in eight groups of 40 people in increments of 15 min
utes. Besides the Stanford Triathlon team, some of the
universities that will be represented at this weekend's
competition include California, Cal Poly, Fresno State
and UC-Davis.
Racing alongside the collegiate athletes will be
community members from Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
Athletes ranging from 15-year-oldVto the eldest com
petitor. a 59-year-old man. will have the chance to race

against some of the best college triathletes. Awards
will be given to the three fastest schools and the top
three individual men and women, as well as the top
three racers in each age group.
Although the Cardinal would love to win the
triathlon as a team, they are more focused on hosting a
successful event.
"I'm not concerned about winning," said head
coach Eric Bean. "Our goal is to put on a great race."
In fact many of the 50 people paying dues for the
triathlon team are not even planning to race; instead
they will be volunteering their time so that the compe
tition runs smoothly. The Treeathlon is a part of the
newly instituted North California Conference and
