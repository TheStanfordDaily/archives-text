# Stanford rolls into UCSB

### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the vans carrying the members of the women's
water polo team (5-1, 2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) rolled out of the Avery Aquatic Center
parking lot yesterday afternoon, the Cardinal were on
a roll in more ways than one.
Heading south to Santa Barbara, Calif., for the
2005 Daktronics Gaucho Invitational, the Cardinal
seem to be firing on all cylinders in both ends of the
pool. Currently ranked No. 3 in the nation, the Cardi
nal enter the UC-Santa Barbara tournament fresh off
a dominating 13-4 victory over No. 17 CSU-
Northridge. It was an effort in which four different
players contributed at least two goals apiece and
sophomore goalie Meridith McColl held the Matadors
scoreless for the first three periods of the game.
Even more encouraging, though, was the manner
in which the Cardinal played in picking up the win.
After his team's impressive season-opening week
end and third-place finish in the Stanford Invitational
two weeks ago. head coach John Tanner emphasized
the fact that his team still had a lot to work on.
"We were pleased with our performance and level
of play, but there are a lot of areas we can improve,"
Tanner said.
Last Saturday's effort against Northridge show

cased a number of improvements, most notably the
Cardinal's increased utilization of one of their greatest
weapons — their speed. Pushing harder on the transi
tion and pressing the ball more quickly on defense, the
Cardinal showed not only the desire but also the abil
ity to take their game one notch higher with every
passing week.
The Cardinal roll into Santa Barbara thus, averag
ing on offense nearly 10 goals a game, while on de
fense allowing an average of just over 11 shots a game.
The three-day Gaucho Invitational will give the
Cardinal a good look at the rest of their NCAA com
petition, as 22 other teams from across the nation will
be participating in the tournament. But the members £
of the women's squad would like to play none of those
22 teams more than last year's national champion
Southern California and this year's current No. 1
UCLA. ' *
The Cardinal dropped all four games in which they
faced the Trojans last year, and would relish the
chance to knock them off in the teams' first meeting
this year.
"They're a challenge like any other, but it would be
a big game," sophomore driver Katie Hansen said.
Assuming the tournament's bracket for the first
day and a half is filled out as the current national rank-

The women's water polo team, which is currently averaging almost 10 goals per game, heads to Santa Barbara
this weekend hoping fora shot at playing conference rivals USC and top-ranked UCLA.
ings say it should, the Cardinal
would find themselves facing the No.
2 Trojans tomorrow afternoon with
a spot in the tournament champi
onship game at stake.
But in order to put themselves in
that position, the Cardinal would
have to win their first three games of
the tournament. They play today
against the two other members of
their group. No. 15 UC-San Diego
and unranked Pacific. Though they
are not looking past these oppo
nents, these are games that the Car
dinal expect to win.
Assuming they do take these two
games to win their group, the Cardi
nal would then take on the winner of
the group formed by No. 6 Indiana,
No. 11 San Jose State and unranked
CSU-San Bernardino.
Favored in this group is Indiana,
who jumped from l()th to sixth in the
Women's Collegiate Top 20 rank

ings after finishing fourth in the
Stanford Invitational by upsetting
then-No. 6 California and No. 7
Hawaii.
The Cardinal handled the
Hoosiers readily in the third-place
game of the Invitational, putting
forth their strongest defensive effort
of the year in shutting down the In
diana offense in an 11-4 victory.
Nevertheless, the members of the
women's squad would be foolish to
overlook a team that comes into the
Gaucho Invitational riding a streak
just as hot, if not hotter, than their
own.
"We have to take it one game at a
time, especially if we end up playing
Indiana because they could easily
come out and play a big game,"
Hansen said.
Though still at an early point in
the season, the Cardinal recognize
the importance of putting forth
their best effort every time they
line up for an opening sprint.
Games played against MPSF rivals
this weekend do not count toward
the Cardinal's final ranking for the
end-of-the-year conference tour

nament, bul all of the games factor
into their national ranking. A sin
gle poor performance this weekend
could cost the Cardinal not only a
shot at the tournament title, but
their standing as one of the top
three teams in the nation.
Yet despite the pressures of a
major tournament appearance such
as this weekend's, the members of
the women's squad approach their
five games this weekend confident
and optimistic.
"It's a big weekend, but we're all
really excited and looking forward
to it," Hansen said.
And considering the way they
have started their season, no one can
blame them. Indeed, there is nothing
any of them would like more than to
square-off against UCLA for the
tournament championship — and a
chance to avenge the narrow loss the
Bruins handed them earlier this sea
son in an evenly matched game that
ended dramatically.
Two days from now, the Cardinal
women will leave Santa Barbara,
head home and, hopefully, still be
rolling in more ways than one.
