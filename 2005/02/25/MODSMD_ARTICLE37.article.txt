### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the vans carrying the members of the women's
water polo team (5-1, 2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) rolled out of the Avery Aquatic Center
parking lot yesterday afternoon, the Cardinal were on
a roll in more ways than one.
Heading south to Santa Barbara, Calif., for the
2005 Daktronics Gaucho Invitational, the Cardinal
seem to be firing on all cylinders in both ends of the
pool. Currently ranked No. 3 in the nation, the Cardi
nal enter the UC-Santa Barbara tournament fresh off
a dominating 13-4 victory over No. 17 CSU-
Northridge. It was an effort in which four different
players contributed at least two goals apiece and
sophomore goalie Meridith McColl held the Matadors
scoreless for the first three periods of the game.
Even more encouraging, though, was the manner
in which the Cardinal played in picking up the win.
After his team's impressive season-opening week
end and third-place finish in the Stanford Invitational
two weeks ago. head coach John Tanner emphasized
the fact that his team still had a lot to work on.
"We were pleased with our performance and level
of play, but there are a lot of areas we can improve,"
Tanner said.
Last Saturday's effort against Northridge show

cased a number of improvements, most notably the
Cardinal's increased utilization of one of their greatest
weapons — their speed. Pushing harder on the transi
tion and pressing the ball more quickly on defense, the
Cardinal showed not only the desire but also the abil
ity to take their game one notch higher with every
passing week.
The Cardinal roll into Santa Barbara thus, averag
ing on offense nearly 10 goals a game, while on de
fense allowing an average of just over 11 shots a game.
The three-day Gaucho Invitational will give the
Cardinal a good look at the rest of their NCAA com
petition, as 22 other teams from across the nation will
be participating in the tournament. But the members £
of the women's squad would like to play none of those
22 teams more than last year's national champion
Southern California and this year's current No. 1
UCLA. ' *
The Cardinal dropped all four games in which they
faced the Trojans last year, and would relish the
chance to knock them off in the teams' first meeting
this year.
"They're a challenge like any other, but it would be
a big game," sophomore driver Katie Hansen said.
Assuming the tournament's bracket for the first
day and a half is filled out as the current national rank-
