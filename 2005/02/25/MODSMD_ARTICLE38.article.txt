# Rookies step up for Card
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
Head coach John Rittman and
the entire Stanford softball coach
ing staff should be patting them
selves on the back fora job well
done. They brought in one of the
finest recruiting classes in recent
memory and the new arrivals have
already made significant contribu
tions.
"The freshmen have made a
huge impact on this team,"
Rittman said. "Not only with their
talent, but their personalities and
their ability to come out here and

make our team belter."
Two freshman pitchers have al
ready seen substantial time in the
circle, a frosh is swinging the Car
dinal's hottest bat and two other
rookies have become regular
members of the starting lineup.
Becky McCullough (2-0) has
started four games and Lauren
Nydam (3-0) has one start and two
saves so far this season. In 15 in
nings pitched. Nydam leads the
team with a 0.45 ERA and has al
lowed only seven hits. McCul
lough. with a 3.20 ERA, is second
on the team with 12 strikeouts.
McCullough, who plays first base

when she is not pitching, also has
one home run and four RBI on
.263 hitting.
Freshman third baseman
Michelle Smith, who has received
two straight Pacific-10 Conference
Player of the Week awards, has
quickly become one of the most
potent scoring threats for No. 4
Stanford (11-1).
In the Stanford Invitational two
weeks ago, Smith tallied two
homeruns and a triple in three
games. At last weekend's USF
Tournament in Florida, she
pounded the ball for four homers
and seven RBI on 6-for-14 hitting.
She now leads the team with seven
homeruns, 14 RBI and a 1.233
slugging percentage in the first
three weeks of the season.
Fellow freshmen Tricia Ag
gabao and Amanda Beardman
have started in 12 and 11 games,
respectively, and have contributed
on both the offensive and defen
sive sides of the ball. Aggabao has
nine RBI on .355 hitting and
Beardman has two homers with
eight RBI. Freshman Erin Howe
has seen action in 11 games, in
cluding seven starts, and has one
homer and four RBI.
That is not to say that the veter
ans are standing idly by and letting
the rookies do all of the work. Ju
nior ace righthander Laura Sever
son (6-1) added two wins to her
record, pitching a one-hit shutout
against Hofstra and giving up only
three runs to South Florida. Senior
Meghan Sickler provided run sup
port with five RBI on the weekend
and juniors Lauren Lappin and
Catalina Morris added two apiece.
Morris said she is glad to see the
freshmen coming in and perform
ing so well right away.
"You have to play well to keep
your position," she said. "There's
always someone off the bench
who's ready to go # . It makes every
one play better."
Everyone will need to continue
to contribute this weekend as the
Cardinal plays host to a new batch
of competition in the second Stan
ford Invitational. Stanford will
start off against UC-Davis (2-10)
and Texas Tech (3-4) Friday
evening, play an afternoon dou
bleheader against Auburn (14-4)
and Alabama-Birmingham (8-7)
on Saturday and finish up against
Sacramento State (5-3) on Sunday.
"Right now we're looking at the

lirst game with UC-Davis and the
second game with Texas Tech and
we're going to take it one game at
a time," Rittman said. "Certainly,
Auburn has the hest record com
ing in and they have beaten some
really good teams, but we can't
overlook one opponent for some
one else. As a coach, any weekend
we respect all of our opponents.
This is one of those games where,
if you don't show up, you can get
beat by anybody on any given
day."
Alter a long trip to Florida last
weekend, the team is looking for
ward to playing at home.
"It was a good experience, the
different time /ones and travel and
the competition from different re
gions which we saw," Rittman said.
Even so, "There's a comfort level at
home. Your routine is a lot more
consistent than when you go on the
road."
"It's nice to be at home," Mor
ris agreed. "Just sleeping in your
own bed is nice. And you know
how our field plays. We have a re
ally nice field and last weekend
the fields weren't the greatest.
And we have our fans here too."
