# Tennis faces off with Pac-10 foes at home
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
The top-ranked Stanford women's team
(8-0, 1-0 Pacific-10 Conference) brings a
busy February schedule to a close, facing off
against No. 11 UCLA (5-2) and No. 12
Southern California (4-0) today and Satur
day, respectively, at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium.
The No. 1 Cardinal are cruising on a 37-
match winning streak that dates back to the
start of last season. Most recently it notched
two consecutive 7-0 shutouts against No. 21
Fresno State (1-2) and No. 75 Washington
State (3-6).
That said, Stanford has built enough mo
mentum to take this weekend's challenging
double-header in stride.
Under the leadership of head coach Lele
Forood and assistant coaches Frankie Bren
nan and Julie Scott-Thu, the Stanford lineup
plans to repeat its 4-1 defeat of the Bruins at
the 2004 NCAA Championship Final.
Meanwhile, the Women of Troy, who
deferred to UCLA in the NCAA Round of
16,4-2, have to defend their 2005 undefeat
ed status on Saturday without projected No.
I singles player, Luana Magnani.
Magnani was ranked at No. 14 in the
2005 preseason after dropping her final
match last May, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1, against
Miami's Jennifer Magley, who holds the No.
II spot.
"We're going to get one solid, efficient
practice on Wednesday," senior Erin Bur
dette said. "(Our coach] told us that every
one played well today, but there are some
things to sharpen and tune up. For me per
sonally, 1 thought was giving in too many
serves, and I'd like to adjust my timing on
that."
Despite any service slip-ups against Fres
no State, Burdette and doubles partner
Alice Barnes, a junior, spent more time fir
ing clear winners and smashing overheads
that landed up in the stadium seats than any
thing else.
But confident or not, a well-seasoned
Stanford still expects hearty rebellion from
its younger competition
"I think USC and UCLA are going to be
our toughest Pac-10 schools this year," Bur
dette said. "I know that USC is not going to
be quite as strong, with their projected No. 1

player being declared ineligible for academ
ic reasons."
Burdette added, "At the same time, they
have a cushion with the depth of the rest of
their team."
On a USC team with no seniors and just
one junior, it seemed only appropriate for
freshman tennis star, Nicole Leimbach (18-
4), to rise to the No. 1 singles occasion.
Saturday will be Leimbach's first show
ing against Liu, who has already moved up
to No. 28 after playing just six matches.
To Leimbach's credit, she holds 2-2
record against the nation s top four players,
unseating No. 1 Audra Cohen of North
western in three sets at the IT A National In
door Championships in November, 3-6,7-5,
6-4. Leimbach got even quicker results over
Georgia's No. 4 Shadisha Robinson (23-5),
posting a straight-set, 6-3,7-5 win.
And it was Robinson who waged an un
finished battle against Liu at the ITA In
door Team Tournament this month, going
up 6-3,2-6,5-3 before time was called.
Leading the Bruins' way is another stel
lar freshman. No. 15 Riza Zalameda (17-5).
Zalameda clinched her first collegiate title
at the ITA Southern California Regional
Championships last October, dropping the
Trojan's No. 17 Lindsey Nelson, 7-5,6-3.
In doubles, the third-ranked pairing of
Zalameda and Daniela Bercek (19-5) will
try to topple the No. 7 tandem of Barnes and
Burdette (17-2,1-0 Pac-10).
Just one court over, Zalameda's former
junior doubles partner, sophomore Anne
Yelsey, will team up with Liu against
UCLA's No. 42 Elizabeth Lumpkin and
Laura Gordon (17-5)
Stanford struggled in the 2(X)4 regular
season to pry the doubles point from the
Bruins, but reports of an injured Bercek
may tip the 2(X)5 scales in the Cardinal's
favor.
Two weeks ago, Bercek had to retire just
three games into a match against Miami's
No. 2 Megan Bradley at Team Indoor.
Though Bercek's current status is un
known, UCLA's Sports Information Direc
tor, Marc Dellins, said that she was sched
uled to make the trip to the Farm.
Watch the Stanford-UCLA action un
fold today at 1:30 p.m. at Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium. Southern California takes the
court tomorrow at noon.

mentum to take this weekend's challenging
double-header in stride.
Under the leadership of head coach Lele
Forood and assistant coaches Frankie Bren
nan and Julie Scott-Thu, the Stanford lineup
plans to repeat its 4-1 defeat of the Bruins at
the 2004 NCAA Championship Final.
Meanwhile, the Women of Troy, who
deferred to UCLA in the NCAA Round of
16,4-2, have to defend their 2005 undefeat
ed status on Saturday without projected No.
I singles player, Luana Magnani.
Magnani was ranked at No. 14 in the
2005 preseason after dropping her final
match last May, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1, against
Miami's Jennifer Magley, who holds the No.
II spot.
"We're going to get one solid, efficient
practice on Wednesday," senior Erin Bur
dette said. "(Our coach] told us that every
one played well today, but there are some
things to sharpen and tune up. For me per
sonally, 1 thought was giving in too many
serves, and I'd like to adjust my timing on
that."
Despite any service slip-ups against Fres
no State, Burdette and doubles partner
Alice Barnes, a junior, spent more time fir
ing clear winners and smashing overheads
that landed up in the stadium seats than any
thing else.
But confident or not, a well-seasoned
Stanford still expects hearty rebellion from
its younger competition
"I think USC and UCLA are going to be
our toughest Pac-10 schools this year," Bur
dette said. "I know that USC is not going to
be quite as strong, with their projected No. 1

player being declared ineligible for academ
ic reasons."
Burdette added, "At the same time, they
have a cushion with the depth of the rest of
their team."
On a USC team with no seniors and just
one junior, it seemed only appropriate for
freshman tennis star, Nicole Leimbach (18-
4), to rise to the No. 1 singles occasion.
Saturday will be Leimbach's first show
ing against Liu, who has already moved up
to No. 28 after playing just six matches.
To Leimbach's credit, she holds 2-2
record against the nation s top four players,
unseating No. 1 Audra Cohen of North
western in three sets at the IT A National In
door Championships in November, 3-6,7-5,
6-4. Leimbach got even quicker results over
Georgia's No. 4 Shadisha Robinson (23-5),
posting a straight-set, 6-3,7-5 win.
And it was Robinson who waged an un
finished battle against Liu at the ITA In
door Team Tournament this month, going
up 6-3,2-6,5-3 before time was called.
Leading the Bruins' way is another stel
lar freshman. No. 15 Riza Zalameda (17-5).
Zalameda clinched her first collegiate title
at the ITA Southern California Regional
Championships last October, dropping the
Trojan's No. 17 Lindsey Nelson, 7-5,6-3.
In doubles, the third-ranked pairing of
Zalameda and Daniela Bercek (19-5) will
try to topple the No. 7 tandem of Barnes and
Burdette (17-2,1-0 Pac-10).
Just one court over, Zalameda's former
junior doubles partner, sophomore Anne
Yelsey, will team up with Liu against
UCLA's No. 42 Elizabeth Lumpkin and
Laura Gordon (17-5)
Stanford struggled in the 2(X)4 regular
season to pry the doubles point from the
Bruins, but reports of an injured Bercek
may tip the 2(X)5 scales in the Cardinal's
favor.
Two weeks ago, Bercek had to retire just
three games into a match against Miami's
No. 2 Megan Bradley at Team Indoor.
Though Bercek's current status is un
known, UCLA's Sports Information Direc
tor, Marc Dellins, said that she was sched
uled to make the trip to the Farm.
Watch the Stanford-UCLA action un
fold today at 1:30 p.m. at Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium. Southern California takes the
court tomorrow at noon.
