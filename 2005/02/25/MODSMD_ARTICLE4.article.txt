# Grad student groups boom
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A spike in the number of graduate student or
ganizations has prompted a renaissance in the
number of opportunities open to these students
to become involved in campus life.
( hris (iriffith, associate dean of graduate stu
dent life, said there are an estimated 80graduate
groups, a stark contrast to the handful that exist
ed a lew years ago.
(iriffith attributed the increase to the benefits
provided by the Office of Student Activities to
registered groups as well as greater awareness of
the connection between extracurriculars and
general wellbcing.
"Graduate students are seeking ways to bal

ancc their rigorous academic schedules with ac
tivities that are rewarding and fun," Griffith said.
" The increase in the number of organizations is a
natural outgrowth of their desire to create this
balance."
I leather Farkas, co-chair of the Graduate Stu
dent Programming Hoard, said "Stanford has a
very vibrant graduate student community so it's
not surprising that its members are getting to
gether."
Many said they believe that the growth in
clubs resulted from graduate students identifying
themselves as a separate community.

they perceive themselves and they are aware of

Grad students create more groups

the fresh emphasis the University is
placing on improving the graduate ex
perience," said Alice Lincoln, a third
year chemistry doctoral candidate.
"The new Graduate Community
Center and Commission on Graduate
Education demonstrate enormous
advances for graduates."
According to Jing Lucy Sun, a
fourth-year structural biology doctor
al candidate, students formed organi
zations because they were "aware of
the increasing need to work together
in addressing many of the challenges
they face at Stanford, such as diversi
ty and childcare/parental support
while in grad school."
Some graduate students have not
joined undergraduate student organi
zations because of perceived difficul
ties involved in combining diverse
communities.
"The main issue is the gap of dif
ferent focus and lifestyle between the
two student bodies," Sun said, i want
to see more interactions that take ad
vantage of both the energy and cre
ativity of undergraduates and the spe
cialized expertise and maturity of
graduate students to influence the
Stanford community."
Many students said they are
pleased with the stronger graduate
community resulting from new orga
nizations and cross-departmental in
teraction.
"It is now easier for grad students

to find their niche, make significant
contributions to the community, and
lead a balanced life," said Sarah
Ratanasopa, a fifth-year medical stu
dent.
"What the community produces is
a wonderful, more collaborative envi
ronment," Sun said. "Ultimately, I
think this makes a huge impact on the
future of not only our individual ca
reer paths, but also it makes Stanford
a much more attractive institution for
higher learning and education."
Below is a mix of several graduate
student groups that have recently
formed to enhance quality of life on
the Farm.
Engineers fora Sustainable
World: Starting March 2003. this or
ganization began addressing engi
neering-based challenges of develop
ing communities.
"A group of grad students started
the association, and we find it hard to
reach the undergraduate community,
since we live in different residences,
go to different clasvses and have differ
ent parties," said President Sophie
Walewijk. fourth-year doctoral stu
dent in civil and environmental engi
neering.
Soul'd Out: This group is one of
Stanford's newest dance troupes and
is open to graduate students with a
passion for hip-hop.
"We started a low-commitment,
all-inclusive hip-hop group that is

flexible with the hectic grad student
lifestyle," said Ratanasopa, the
group's president.
Stanford Chemistry Women's
Committee on Graduate Life: Four
female doctoral candidates bonded
over a recognized need — improving
the experience of female graduate
students and postdoctoral scholars
within the Chemistry Department.
"At the graduate level, experi
ences vary so widely by department
and school that student organizations
often need to be localized in order to
be effective," said Lincoln, a founder
of the group.
Biomedically Affiliated Stanford
Students: Since 2001, this organiza
tion has tried to provide career re
sources and advocacy for students en
rolled in biological science graduate
programs in 14 research departments.
"1 got involved in BioMASS hop
ing to improve the quality of life for
graduate students," said Sun, who
also serves as co-chair.
Student Golf Club: More than 90
students practice at the range twice a
week.
The group's president, Su Jin
Gatlin, a second-year education grad
uate student, joked that the founders
were all "teed up" to start the club be
cause "many members had used up
their NCAA eligibility as undergrads,
so they were unable to play on the var
sity team."

to see more interactions that take ad
vantage of both the energy and cre
ativity of undergraduates and the spe
cialized expertise and maturity of
graduate students to influence the
Stanford community."
Many students said they are
pleased with the stronger graduate
community resulting from new orga
nizations and cross-departmental in
teraction.
"It is now easier for grad students

to find their niche, make significant
contributions to the community, and
lead a balanced life," said Sarah
Ratanasopa, a fifth-year medical stu
dent.
"What the community produces is
a wonderful, more collaborative envi
ronment," Sun said. "Ultimately, I
think this makes a huge impact on the
future of not only our individual ca
reer paths, but also it makes Stanford
a much more attractive institution for
higher learning and education."
Below is a mix of several graduate
student groups that have recently
formed to enhance quality of life on
the Farm.
Engineers fora Sustainable
World: Starting March 2003. this or
ganization began addressing engi
neering-based challenges of develop
ing communities.
"A group of grad students started
the association, and we find it hard to
reach the undergraduate community,
since we live in different residences,
go to different clasvses and have differ
ent parties," said President Sophie
Walewijk. fourth-year doctoral stu
dent in civil and environmental engi
neering.
Soul'd Out: This group is one of
Stanford's newest dance troupes and
is open to graduate students with a
passion for hip-hop.
"We started a low-commitment,
all-inclusive hip-hop group that is

flexible with the hectic grad student
lifestyle," said Ratanasopa, the
group's president.
Stanford Chemistry Women's
Committee on Graduate Life: Four
female doctoral candidates bonded
over a recognized need — improving
the experience of female graduate
students and postdoctoral scholars
within the Chemistry Department.
"At the graduate level, experi
ences vary so widely by department
and school that student organizations
often need to be localized in order to
be effective," said Lincoln, a founder
of the group.
Biomedically Affiliated Stanford
Students: Since 2001, this organiza
tion has tried to provide career re
sources and advocacy for students en
rolled in biological science graduate
programs in 14 research departments.
"1 got involved in BioMASS hop
ing to improve the quality of life for
graduate students," said Sun, who
also serves as co-chair.
Student Golf Club: More than 90
students practice at the range twice a
week.
The group's president, Su Jin
Gatlin, a second-year education grad
uate student, joked that the founders
were all "teed up" to start the club be
cause "many members had used up
their NCAA eligibility as undergrads,
so they were unable to play on the var
sity team."
A spike in the number of graduate student or
ganizations has prompted a renaissance in the
number of opportunities open to these students
to become involved in campus life.
( hris (iriffith, associate dean of graduate stu
dent life, said there are an estimated 80graduate
groups, a stark contrast to the handful that exist
ed a lew years ago.
(iriffith attributed the increase to the benefits
provided by the Office of Student Activities to
registered groups as well as greater awareness of
the connection between extracurriculars and
general wellbcing.
"Graduate students are seeking ways to bal

ancc their rigorous academic schedules with ac
tivities that are rewarding and fun," Griffith said.
" The increase in the number of organizations is a
natural outgrowth of their desire to create this
balance."
I leather Farkas, co-chair of the Graduate Stu
dent Programming Hoard, said "Stanford has a
very vibrant graduate student community so it's
not surprising that its members are getting to
gether."
Many said they believe that the growth in
clubs resulted from graduate students identifying
themselves as a separate community.

they perceive themselves and they are aware of

Grad students create more groups

the fresh emphasis the University is
placing on improving the graduate ex
perience," said Alice Lincoln, a third
year chemistry doctoral candidate.
"The new Graduate Community
Center and Commission on Graduate
Education demonstrate enormous
advances for graduates."
According to Jing Lucy Sun, a
fourth-year structural biology doctor
al candidate, students formed organi
zations because they were "aware of
the increasing need to work together
in addressing many of the challenges
they face at Stanford, such as diversi
ty and childcare/parental support
while in grad school."
Some graduate students have not
joined undergraduate student organi
zations because of perceived difficul
ties involved in combining diverse
communities.
"The main issue is the gap of dif
ferent focus and lifestyle between the
two student bodies," Sun said, i want
