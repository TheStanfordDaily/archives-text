# Intermission demands loft

"We just want to get high," declared
an Intermission staffer who wished to
remain anonymous. "Well, higher I
guess if you want to be technical about
it, but... you know what we mean."
According to sources within the
newly autonomous Intermission sec
tion, The Daily has learned that the
entertainment tabloid's team has re
solved to build a loft in its newly reor
ganized office space.
"We're sick of this whole 'being on
the ground' deal," the Intermission
staffer said. "Seriously, with chicken
wings and soda cans strewn about, it's
getting kind of disgusting being down
here."
The current schematic design calls
for the loft to be 6-feet wide, four-feet
deep and eight feet off the ground.
"It'd be ideal if we could fit three
editors on the loft level at once," the
Intermission staffer said. "That way,
well, there'd be more 'chance' for cer
tain 'developments' to take place."
While the Intermission team ap
pears to be united behind the con
struction effort, many Daily staffers
had a different take on the situation.
"It's not fair that they get to have
all the fun," said Opinions Editor An
thony Ha. "I try to have fun with my
section, but we just keep falling into
being serious and writing about 'is
sues.' It's really pathetic."
Members of The Daily were not the
only ones to voice feelings of jealousy
over the upcoming project. Members
of the Stanford Band, an organization
widely revered for past technological

and engineering marvels, expressed
concern that their position as the pre
eminent campus source of "really cool
things that you really don't need"
would be challenged.
"Some might say we've got the
Bedonka-whatever, but we're even
selling that," said a Band member who
wished to remain anonymous. "And
yeah, the Band Shak might have rats, a
wagon full of pancakes and violations
of various state and county building

codes, but if Intermission gets this loft,
we're totally fucked."
Daily F.ditor-in-Chief Cynthia
Cho, however, tried to spin the loft
project as a positive development for
the Storke Publications complex.
"This innovative undertaking,"
she said," will provide a variety of new
ways in which both staffers in Inter
mission and The Daily will be able to
explore exciting new worker-com
pensation opportunities."

not included). In fact, the Intermission editors are in Home Depot purchasing the requi
site two-by-fours at this very moment.
