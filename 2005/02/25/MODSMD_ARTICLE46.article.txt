# Goodbye Tam...for now
## 
### SAM TANZER INTERMISSION EDITOR, APPARENTLY 
It was the moment of truth. Tarn
Vo had left us for Tennessee. For the
first time in more than a year, she
was not slaving away in our tiny cu
bicle late Thursday night, selling her
soul to get the paper out on time. In
termission's very existence was in
jeopardy.
But if you're reading this right
now, it means that somehow, amaz
ingly, we got it done. That's right,
Tam. Bumbling, idiotic fools that we
are, we did the job. Sure, it's not per
fect. Sure, we've got three pages of
culture and no music (don't tell any
one).
But we fucking did it. And with
you gone, we're free to live out our
wildest dreams. I don't know if
you've heard, Tam. But we're build
ing a loft. That's right, a loft. In your
beautiful Intermission office (see

opposite).
And you're not here to stop us.
Just think of the things we can do.
now that all instruments of social
control have been removed. There
shall be no table of contents in this
Intermission! Instead, the 10-res
photo of some overturned vehicle
rules supreme!
Do you know how we found it?
Do you? We Googled the word
"them." That's right, a simple pro
noun. There was no reason behind it,
there is no redeeming method in our
zany madness. As you read, Inter
mission is descending into absolute
chaos.
The loft will rise. The social con
tract will fall. We have ... absolute
freedom!
But, um, you'll be back on Sun
day. right? Because we still don't re
ally know what we're doing. And,
um. we don't really have much con
tent for next week. But you'll still
help us, right... please?
