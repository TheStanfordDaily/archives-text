## Thompson's fear and loathing finally catch up to him 
### ANTHONY HA INTERMISSION ROCK STAR 
Late Monday, 1 got
an e-mail from Intermis
sion's own Jen

nie Kim,
reading
simply,
"Very sad."

Her message
linked to a
news article

— at first. 1 thought it was a joke,
maybe a gag story from The Onion.
When reality sank in. I started rum
maging through my bookshelf for my
copy of "Fear and Loathing: On the
Campaign Trail '72," only to remem
ber that I'd loaned it to a friend,
telling him, "You have to read this.
Trust me."
Hunter S. Thompson is dead.
It almost seems like a last, great
stunt, a final "fuck you" to the world.
And it also, perhaps, seals his fate as a

writer whose larger-than-life, drug
addled persona looms larger than the
work itself.
Not that the two are easily separat
ed. As you can learn by reading any
one of the recent flood of obits.

Thompson's great innova
tion as a journalist was to
iembed himself deeply and
in his stories.

overwhelming the ostensible subject
matter of his work with his deranged
antics and mad. stream-of-conscious
ness prose. "Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas" wasn't about a motorcycle
race, it was about Thompson, under
the alias "Raoul Duke." fucked up on
drugs and trashing hotel rooms with
his sidekick Dr. Gonzo. By the time
Thompson got around to writing a
memoir, "Kingdom of Fear," it
seemed like a letdown — what hadn't
he said already?
But "Kingdom of Fear" is also a
sprawling mess — as, by many ac
counts, are most of his later books.
Thompson, fairly or not, was in the
twilight years of his journalistic career
— he had become the loud buffoon in

the corner who's good fora laugh, but
is best to ignore when the real deci-

sions are made.
And then there were the carica
tures: Bill Murray in "Where the Buf
falo Roam"; spastic, cigarette-chomp
ing Johnny Depp in Terry Gilliam's
adaptation of "Fear and Loathing in
Las Vegas" and the buffoonish Uncle
Duke in "Doonesbury." Why would
anyone take this guy seriously?
It would he a mistake to claim that
I have any idea who the "real"
Hunter S. Thompson was. Maybe the
drunken old man who puked all over
one of his groupies at a reading is as
close to Thompson's "true" self as the
fierce — if unconventional — cru
sader that I'd like to imagine. But if
we're going to remember Thompson,
it's the crazed passion that's worth
celebrating.
Warren Ellis and Darick Robert
son do a great job of capturing this in
the graphic novel series "Transmetro
politan," which transforms Thomp
son into outlaw journalist Spider
Jerusalem, walking the streets of his
cyberpunkish metropolis, battling a

deranged president in an epic war of
truth vs. power. For all its black
humor, the comic is ultimately inspir
ing, and the comparison is obvious.
Then there are the books them
selves, especially the early ones —
combining feverish prose with a cool,
clear vision that could cut through
countless layers of bullshit. "Hell's
Angels" is a vivid account of Thomp
son's days riding with, you guessed it,
the Hell's Angels. "Fear and Loathing
in Las Vegas" may recount the binge
to end all binges, but it's also a valiant
— if unevenly successful — attempt
to capture the spirit of the times, the
sour morning-after moment when the
idealism of the '60s had faded.
And of course there was the mas
terpiece, "Transmetropolitan'"s
source code — the frightening, hilari
ous "Fear and Loathing: On the Cam
paign Trail '72," which takes us on a
journey through the Byzantine confu
sion and true madness of the Ameri
can political process. Thompson's di
gressions are corrosive poetry, his
righteous indignation at the machina
tions of party hacks is incendiary and

his bitter grief at the collapse of the
McGovern campaign and the land
slide Nixon victory is deeply-felt.
At his best, Thompson set his can
of beer aside and grasped our shad
owed, beating hearts. Good night
Hunter.

Hunter Thompson never really waved good
bye to us.

addled persona looms larger than the
work itself.
Not that the two are easily separat
ed. As you can learn by reading any
one of the recent flood of obits.

Thompson's great innova
tion as a journalist was to
iembed himself deeply and
in his stories.

overwhelming the ostensible subject
matter of his work with his deranged
antics and mad. stream-of-conscious
ness prose. "Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas" wasn't about a motorcycle
race, it was about Thompson, under
the alias "Raoul Duke." fucked up on
drugs and trashing hotel rooms with
his sidekick Dr. Gonzo. By the time
Thompson got around to writing a
memoir, "Kingdom of Fear," it
seemed like a letdown — what hadn't
he said already?
But "Kingdom of Fear" is also a
sprawling mess — as, by many ac
counts, are most of his later books.
Thompson, fairly or not, was in the
twilight years of his journalistic career
— he had become the loud buffoon in

the corner who's good fora laugh, but
is best to ignore when the real deci-

sions are made.
And then there were the carica
tures: Bill Murray in "Where the Buf
falo Roam"; spastic, cigarette-chomp
ing Johnny Depp in Terry Gilliam's
adaptation of "Fear and Loathing in
Las Vegas" and the buffoonish Uncle
Duke in "Doonesbury." Why would
anyone take this guy seriously?
It would he a mistake to claim that
I have any idea who the "real"
Hunter S. Thompson was. Maybe the
drunken old man who puked all over
one of his groupies at a reading is as
close to Thompson's "true" self as the
fierce — if unconventional — cru
sader that I'd like to imagine. But if
we're going to remember Thompson,
it's the crazed passion that's worth
celebrating.
Warren Ellis and Darick Robert
son do a great job of capturing this in
the graphic novel series "Transmetro
politan," which transforms Thomp
son into outlaw journalist Spider
Jerusalem, walking the streets of his
cyberpunkish metropolis, battling a

deranged president in an epic war of
truth vs. power. For all its black
humor, the comic is ultimately inspir
ing, and the comparison is obvious.
Then there are the books them
selves, especially the early ones —
combining feverish prose with a cool,
clear vision that could cut through
countless layers of bullshit. "Hell's
Angels" is a vivid account of Thomp
son's days riding with, you guessed it,
the Hell's Angels. "Fear and Loathing
in Las Vegas" may recount the binge
to end all binges, but it's also a valiant
— if unevenly successful — attempt
to capture the spirit of the times, the
sour morning-after moment when the
idealism of the '60s had faded.
And of course there was the mas
terpiece, "Transmetropolitan'"s
source code — the frightening, hilari
ous "Fear and Loathing: On the Cam
paign Trail '72," which takes us on a
journey through the Byzantine confu
sion and true madness of the Ameri
can political process. Thompson's di
gressions are corrosive poetry, his
righteous indignation at the machina
tions of party hacks is incendiary and

his bitter grief at the collapse of the
McGovern campaign and the land
slide Nixon victory is deeply-felt.
At his best, Thompson set his can
of beer aside and grasped our shad
owed, beating hearts. Good night
Hunter.

Hunter Thompson never really waved good
bye to us.


Late Monday, 1 got
an e-mail from Intermis
sion's own Jen

nie Kim,
reading
simply,
"Very sad."

Her message
linked to a
news article

— at first. 1 thought it was a joke,
maybe a gag story from The Onion.
When reality sank in. I started rum
maging through my bookshelf for my
copy of "Fear and Loathing: On the
Campaign Trail '72," only to remem
ber that I'd loaned it to a friend,
telling him, "You have to read this.
Trust me."
Hunter S. Thompson is dead.
It almost seems like a last, great
stunt, a final "fuck you" to the world.
And it also, perhaps, seals his fate as a

writer whose larger-than-life, drug
addled persona looms larger than the
work itself.
Not that the two are easily separat
ed. As you can learn by reading any
one of the recent flood of obits.
