Seriously. day and Saturday.
INT: How did you become interested
in modern dance?
HM: I didn't really discover modern
until 1 came to Stanford. I took
Diane Frank's class. I was also in a
ton of student works and choreo
graphed some. Later I was a scholar
ship student at the Merce Cunning
ham school in New York and free
lanced before joining Trisha Brown's
company.

INT: What is Ms. Brown's
choreographic method
like?

HM: It is rooted in im-i
provisation and the!
logic of the body as op-1
posed to the intellectu-j
al generation of move-1
ment. She is very com-1
mitted to innovation!
and finding her own"
unique language and
gestures. It's about find
ing all the permutation!
of what the body can do.

INT: What repertory will the
company present this week-i
end? J

HM: There are
three pieces.
"Set and
Reset," Tr
isha's most fa
mous dance, was
the first of its
kind in terms of

its deconstruction of formal dance vo
cabulary. It is based in the spirit of im
provisation and was made in collabo
ration with Robert Rauschenberg.
The two other pieces are called "Pre
sent Tense" and "Groove and Coun
termove."
INT: In addition to performing, I un
derstand that one of your choreo
graphic works is being performed in
the Music and Dance by Chance per
formance this Sunday at 8 p.m. in
, Roble dance studio. Can you tell me a
[ little about your piece?

HM: You're dancing in my piece
L Isn't this a conflict of interests?

INT: Nah. Really, it's cool.

HM: OK. It's called,
Me to Say
Goodbye." I was

originally interested in the effect of
distance on desire. In it, I try to ex-

plore motifs of reced
ing and falling fig
ures. I find it is inter-

esting and rewarding to start with an
intellectual question and see how a

physical process answers the

question. I can start with
one idea that goes a total
ly different direction j
once the dancers become I
involved. The piece be- I
comes its own entity. j

INT: I heard that you
think the dancers in

your piece are the best
you've ever seen any-

where, including the
competitive New York
dance scene.

HM: You totally just made
that up.

INT: Fair enough. Well, I
understand
... i

that
you
tend
to keep

up with
"US Weekly."

Do you have any Oscar
hopes or predictions?
HIM: No one on cam-

pus should be watch
ing the Oscars because
they should all be in

Roble watching you.
Maybe we'll plan a

"costume malfunction"
to get people to come. I
haven't been keeping up

with "US Weekly" recently
because I've been too busy.
There's been a tragic vacuum
in my life whenever I can't

squeeze "US" in

Trisha Brown Dance Compa
ny is presented by Cat Perfor

day at 8 p.m. Call (510) 642-
