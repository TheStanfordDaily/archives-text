# The 						Oscars: Gettin’ in da game
## Intermission calls the winners for 2004 
### CHRIS LEE INTERMISSION MOVIE AMATEUR 
50... I hear it's time for the Oscars. How
do I know this? Inherent love for the indus
try? Glossy trade mags and heaping mounds
of Entertainment Weeklys piled at my door?
Reams and reams of Oscar ballots, all metic
ulously filled out like March Madness brack
ets? Well, no. I've just been told by our dear
Intermission editors that they need a spread,
and they need it STAT.
So here, dear readers, are the Oscar mus
ings of one pseudo, mostly absent for the past
year Intermission film critic — unsolicited,
unexpected and most of all courageously un
qualified! I will note that thanks to one Film
Criticism class taken during fall quarter I have
in fact seen more than my usual share of the
nominated films — so in a marathon (read:
ridiculously compressed) session of gonzo

riffage, let's
peruse this
year's nomi
nations to
gether, shall
we?
Best Picture
"Ray"?
Why is"Ray"
on here? And
I am man
enough to
admit I was
uncomfort
ably close to
bawling at
the end of
"Finding
Neverland,"

ing argument to win
his first than "Gangs
of New York" a few
years ago. And not
having seen "Million
Dollar Baby," I'll re
frain from comment
ing on Eastwood
other than to say —
why do all the critics
think this man is
God? "Mystic River"
was fine, but ulti
mately overrated.
Best Actor
Instead of nominat
ing "Ray" for other
things, could we just

hut I still felt manipulated. Couldn't we have
niayhe — just maybe — found room for some
"Eternal Sunshine?"
Best Director
Big props to Stanford alum Alexander Payne,
who continues to prove that brilliant directing
does not have to mean gorgeous cinematog
raphy — and I say that in the most admiring
way possible. He's the most brilliant, incisive
cataloger of human behavior working today. I
admired Scorcese's "Aviator" for being so
fluid and understated; it's a far more convinc-

nominate Jamie Foxx twice in this catego
ry and be done with it? It certainly
wouldn't make a difference to Paul Gia
matti, the inexplicably overlooked anchor
of "Sideways." Foxx's performance IS that
movie, and if there's anything approaching
a sure winner this is probably it. I haven't

seen "Hotel Rwanda" and
I'm sure Don Cheadle does
a bang-up job, but it's clear
that Foxx has more momen
tum. And here's Mr. East
wood again — probably the
one who stole Giamatti's
spot. But it's probably unfair
to count out Leo — he did
win a Golden Globe, after
all.
Best Supporting Actor
Jamie Foxx? I guess they did
find a way to nominate him
twice for "Ray" — Tom
Cruise deserves a nomination
before Foxx for "Collateral,"

though I'm not sure that should say much.
Haden Church is a gas in "Sideways," and
Clive Owen's is probably the best (if sleazi
est) performance of the "Closer" team. SNL
just featured a funny send-up of Morgan
Freeman and the earthy, honest narrator
roles he always gets — again, 1 can't com
ment without seeing having seen the"Mil
lion Dollar Baby," but the sketch was pretty
funny.

Best Supporting Actress
I never thought I'd be
saying this so soon, but
Natalie Portman seems
the frontrunner with her
Golden Globe win. Her
performance in "Closer"
was remarkably more
believable than expect
ed. Cate Blanchett
makes a courageous
Kathryn Hepburn, but
I'm not sure it transcend
ed impression. Virginia
Madsen is the strongest
competition here. With
Paul Giamatti out, it'll be

the easiest way to honor "Sideways."

The Others
Some random thoughts on other categories:
1) Best screenplay — Charlie Kaufman all the
way. Can he be nominated for adapted screen
play too? He adapted... his own ... mind.

2) Best score / song — Why isn't
Jon Brion nominated for some
thing? He made "Eternal Sun
shine" wistfully dreamy score
and "1 Heart Huckabees" com
pletely off the wall with his

scores, and even wrote

original songs for both.

3) Why does best ani
mated film exist?

Until Pixar starts!
pumping out five pic-'
tures a year, it's always

no contest —
only three nominees, peo

pie! A far more applicable cate
gory for this year (which would

actually have more entrees than nominee slots):
best use of Jude Law. The man was literally in
every other movie this year. I nominate 1)

"Alfie"; 2) "1 Heart Huckabees"; 3) "Sky
Captain and the World of Tomorrow"; 4) J

"Closer"; 5) "Lemony Snicket." m
4) While we're on the topic of arbitrary cat-1
egories, why doesn't the Academy create
category that honors people for trying? You

know, like award those who
took a chance on something
that was interesting but didn't
quite succeed? I nominate 1)
Wes Anderson's "The Life

Aquatic," which seemed
overly hectic and disor- A

ganized but will hope
fully resonate with
"Royal Tenen-i
baums'Mike appeal)

upon future view-*
ings; 2) David O.
sell's "I Heart Huck-*

abees," which though
philosophically intriguing
could use a little more heart; 3)

M. Night Shyamalan's "The Village," which
I'll admit is too conceited but still suffered an
unfair lynching from critics; 4) "Sky Captain
and the World of Tomorrow " the visually
splendiferous throwback to old sci-fi serials
that 1 still think could have been BIGGER; and
5) "Closer," the well-acted, faithfully translated
stage play that comes across as just that.

George C. Scott refers to the Oscars as
a "two-hour meet parade" and refuses
to attend, opting instead to watch a
hockey game on television at home, de
spite being nominated for and winning
IUkSI Best Actor for his work in "Patton."

During the awards, a nude man (Robert
Opal) streaks across stage flashing a
peace sign, causing host David Niven to
comment, "Well ladies and gentlemen,
that was bound to happen. Just think, the
only laugh that man will probably ever
IKtfl get is for stripping and showing off his
| shortcomings."

Sally Field happily declares "You like
me, you really like me!" upon winning
Best Actress for "Places in the Heart."

a-like during the show 7 s open
ing, for which Disney subse
quently sues the Academy.

Jonathan Demme delivers a
particularly painful "Umm"-

"The Silence of the Lambs."

Tom Hanks ; winner of Best Actor the year
before and again up for the award during
that year's ceremony, gets called on stage
by host David Letterman to assist with — of
___ all things — a "stupid pet trick" consisting
HUH of a dog spinning around on stage.

Jack Palance, upon winning Best
Supporting Actor for "City Slick
ers," decides while on stage to
demonstrate his ability to per
form one-armed pushups de
spite being 73-years old.

So, you're sitting there in your dorm room, itch
ing, just itching to put some money on the Oscars.
Big money. Cash money.
Let's face it. The Oscars are huge. And anything
huge necessarily requires a monetary bet or two.
But the only problem is that you've been spending
the last year slaving away at your desk, reading
"books" and going to "lectures." Well, have no fear!
Intermission is proud to bring you "Intermission
Predicts the 2004 Oscar Picks."
We wouldn't call this a "science" since in science
you technically can't "prove" anything, and these
picks are proven... but that having been said, we're
pretty sure this is how it is going to go down:
Best Actor. Jamie Foxx. Anyone with two Xs in
a row has got our respect. Just think how famous
he'd be if he had three...
Best Actress: Kate Winslet for "Eternal Sun
shine." This is a real prediction. She was really good.
Best Actor in a Supporting Role: Alan Alda for
"The Aviator." The Academy thinks he deserves it
for finally getting over Captain BJ Hunnicut and
doing some work in a decent movie. In his accep
tance speech, he somewhat disconcertingly refers to
himself as "Old Hawkeye."
Best Actress in a Supporting Role: In surprise
upset, Julia Roberts wins another Oscar for her
work in 2000's "Erin Brockovich." In her accep
tance speech, she uses the phrase, "Wow, I never ex
pected this."
Best Animated Film: "The Incredibles." Do we
even need to ask?
Best Director Alexander Payne for "Sideways."
In a surprise turn of events, Natalie Portman rushes
the stage in protest of Julia Roberts' dark horse win.
Alexander Payne doesn't get to make a speech, but
is quite happy with his close encounter with Queen
Amidala. (She's really hot.)
Best Picture: A temporary power outage sets the
stage for violent looting. Red carpets are soiled. Fur
coats are stolen. In an incident sure to spark nation
al outrage, Jamie Foxx is stopped while "fleeing the
scene" and beaten senseless by the LAPD, who mis
take his Best Actor Oscar fora pendant from Em
inem's necklace. Wayne Brady somehow emerges
unscathed.
That's how it's going to happen. Seriously. So
place your bets.


He's too cool for school



One name. One man. One movie
Many Oscars . . .


"Peace" or "fuck you"? Eh, you
make the call





If you side part your hair enough,
Oscar glory is yours.
