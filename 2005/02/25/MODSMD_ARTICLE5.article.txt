With the end of winter quarter
approaching rapidly and summer
not too far away, many Stanford stu
dents are on the hunt for internships.
According to Career Develop
ment (enter Director Fance Choy,
many corporate firms choose to re
cruit students for internship posi
tions through the CDC.
"There are more firms recruiting
at Stanford than in the past couple of
years," Choy said. "Not as many as
during the dot-com boom, but a sig
nificant improvement from two
years ago."
Fast year, recruiters included
Google, Microsoft, McKinsey &
Co., the University of California and
Stanford itself. While the gamut of
interviews and job offers is over now

for students seeking banking and
consulting positions, the process is
just beginning for other industries.
Junior David Post, who worked
through the Career Development
Center to garner a handful of inter
views for investment banking and
management consulting positions,
said he believes that certain types of
jobs are more difficult to gel than
others.
"It's more competitive for intern
ships than it is for full-time jobs,"
Post said. "Internships are risky for
the company because it's not as
binding as a full-time job and the
whole point of an internship is to
train employees for future use."
Junior Nate Leung also used the
CDC to get over ten interviews fora
