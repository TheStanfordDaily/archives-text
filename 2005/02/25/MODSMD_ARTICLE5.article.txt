# Students interview for corporate internships
## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
With the end of winter quarter
approaching rapidly and summer
not too far away, many Stanford stu
dents are on the hunt for internships.
According to Career Develop
ment (enter Director Fance Choy,
many corporate firms choose to re
cruit students for internship posi
tions through the CDC.
"There are more firms recruiting
at Stanford than in the past couple of
years," Choy said. "Not as many as
during the dot-com boom, but a sig
nificant improvement from two
years ago."
Fast year, recruiters included
Google, Microsoft, McKinsey &
Co., the University of California and
Stanford itself. While the gamut of
interviews and job offers is over now

for students seeking banking and
consulting positions, the process is
just beginning for other industries.
Junior David Post, who worked
through the Career Development
Center to garner a handful of inter
views for investment banking and
management consulting positions,
said he believes that certain types of
jobs are more difficult to gel than
others.
"It's more competitive for intern
ships than it is for full-time jobs,"
Post said. "Internships are risky for
the company because it's not as
binding as a full-time job and the
whole point of an internship is to
train employees for future use."
Junior Nate Leung also used the
CDC to get over ten interviews fora
full-time summer job or internship in
investment banking. According to
Leung, the jobs offered by recruiters
are often intensely competitive.
"At the Boston Consulting
group, they gave out over HO first
round interviews, took around 20
back for final rounds and accepted
around five for positions," he said.
Post agreed with Leung, stating
that "it's like college admissions or
even harder because everyone here
has gotten into Stanford already."
The type of questions asked at in
terviews with such firms — which
are held either on-campus or at the
companies' offices — can vary
greatly in their relevance to the job.
Sometimes, employers will ask brain
teasers just to see how well candi
dates can articulate and defend an
argument.
"The hardest question I was
asked," Leunti, said, "was, 'So you

think it is important to handle pres
sure well? Okay, what's 13 cubed?'"
"They want to see if you get flus
tered," Post said. "Sometimes
they'll just ask you to name the CEO
of the company you're interviewing
for."
Despite these intimidating sce
narios, the CDC sets rules for re
cruiters and interviews to maintain
fairness for the students.
For instance, the CDC Web site
states that "When employers ask
students to come back fora second
round interview, they must allow
reasonable time for students to ad
just their schedules."
But firms don't always abide by
these regulations.
"I had one second round inter
view that was the day after first
rounds," Leung said. "But that is
definitely atypical."
According to Choy, when com
panies break the rules set forth by
the CDC, they risk "losing recruit
ing privileges...but that doesn't hap
pen very often."
Despite the popularity of the
CDC's recruiting program with cer
tain firms, not all companies are
banging on Stanford's door to
search for future interns and em
ployees.
"In reality, most employers do
not have the resources or time to re

cruit at college campuses," Choy
said. "While Stanford does attract a
lot of employer activity, this only
represents a narrow range of compa
nies."
For these reasons, students need
to take the initiative to contact po
tential employers, Choy said.
While the rush for investment
banking and consulting jobs might
make non-economics majors ner
vous, Choy assured that there are
plenty of job opportunities for Stan
ford fuzzies.
"An English major might pursue
a variety of different jobs," Choy
said. "They might work as a teacher,
a consultant, a technical writer or a
government policy analyst"
He stressed that even though big
name companies recruit through the
CDC, students should review their
choices and pick what interests them
the most.
"Students tend to operate on
very limited information, which
tends to be influenced by those com
panies that get the most media,"
Choy said. "Going after the most
popular job is one way to do things,
but it's very limiting."
Editors note: There will be a follow
up story next week addressing job
and internship opportunities in gov
ernment and public service.

not too far away, many Stanford stu
dents are on the hunt for internships.
According to Career Develop
ment (enter Director Fance Choy,
many corporate firms choose to re
cruit students for internship posi
tions through the CDC.
"There are more firms recruiting
at Stanford than in the past couple of
years," Choy said. "Not as many as
during the dot-com boom, but a sig
nificant improvement from two
years ago."
Fast year, recruiters included
Google, Microsoft, McKinsey &
Co., the University of California and
Stanford itself. While the gamut of
interviews and job offers is over now

for students seeking banking and
consulting positions, the process is
just beginning for other industries.
Junior David Post, who worked
through the Career Development
Center to garner a handful of inter
views for investment banking and
management consulting positions,
said he believes that certain types of
jobs are more difficult to gel than
others.
"It's more competitive for intern
ships than it is for full-time jobs,"
Post said. "Internships are risky for
the company because it's not as
binding as a full-time job and the
whole point of an internship is to
train employees for future use."
Junior Nate Leung also used the
CDC to get over ten interviews fora
full-time summer job or internship in
investment banking. According to
Leung, the jobs offered by recruiters
are often intensely competitive.
"At the Boston Consulting
group, they gave out over HO first
round interviews, took around 20
back for final rounds and accepted
around five for positions," he said.
Post agreed with Leung, stating
that "it's like college admissions or
even harder because everyone here
has gotten into Stanford already."
The type of questions asked at in
terviews with such firms — which
are held either on-campus or at the
companies' offices — can vary
greatly in their relevance to the job.
Sometimes, employers will ask brain
teasers just to see how well candi
dates can articulate and defend an
argument.
"The hardest question I was
asked," Leunti, said, "was, 'So you

think it is important to handle pres
sure well? Okay, what's 13 cubed?'"
"They want to see if you get flus
tered," Post said. "Sometimes
they'll just ask you to name the CEO
of the company you're interviewing
for."
Despite these intimidating sce
narios, the CDC sets rules for re
cruiters and interviews to maintain
fairness for the students.
For instance, the CDC Web site
states that "When employers ask
students to come back fora second
round interview, they must allow
reasonable time for students to ad
just their schedules."
But firms don't always abide by
these regulations.
"I had one second round inter
view that was the day after first
rounds," Leung said. "But that is
definitely atypical."
According to Choy, when com
panies break the rules set forth by
the CDC, they risk "losing recruit
ing privileges...but that doesn't hap
pen very often."
Despite the popularity of the
CDC's recruiting program with cer
tain firms, not all companies are
banging on Stanford's door to
search for future interns and em
ployees.
"In reality, most employers do
not have the resources or time to re

cruit at college campuses," Choy
said. "While Stanford does attract a
lot of employer activity, this only
represents a narrow range of compa
nies."
For these reasons, students need
to take the initiative to contact po
tential employers, Choy said.
While the rush for investment
banking and consulting jobs might
make non-economics majors ner
vous, Choy assured that there are
plenty of job opportunities for Stan
ford fuzzies.
"An English major might pursue
a variety of different jobs," Choy
said. "They might work as a teacher,
a consultant, a technical writer or a
government policy analyst"
He stressed that even though big
name companies recruit through the
CDC, students should review their
choices and pick what interests them
the most.
"Students tend to operate on
very limited information, which
tends to be influenced by those com
panies that get the most media,"
Choy said. "Going after the most
popular job is one way to do things,
but it's very limiting."

up story next week addressing job
and internship opportunities in gov
ernment and public service.
