## Eric does Nintendo Previews new systems, games 
### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION NINTENDO EXPERT 
Nintendo and \k>
As I stepped off the plane in Seattle, the
clear and sunny skies were just one more
sign that this would lie a very special week
end for the gamer inside of me. It was Nin-

tendo College Media Days,
and I. along with some 30
other college reporters were
being flown in from across

the United States to
take part in a two
dav journey through

the world of Ninten
do. As I sot in the cab to

my hotel situated in down
town Seattle, I began to won

der what it was exactly that Ninten
do wanted to tell us. Just what exact

ly is "the Nintendo experience"?
Thankfully, as my childhood imagination
once envisioned, Nintendo is still the stuff
of dreams.

The Place (and Tour)
Situated next to the headquarters of Mi
crosoft in Redmond, Nintendo's offices
look just like so many other whitewashed
corporate buildings. The dark double
doors open onto a security checkpoint
desk. Sparsely placed vintage Nintendo
dolls are the only sign of the company's
unique heritage. If we hadn't had a tour
guide, it would have been hard to tell if we
were even in the right place.
But as we began to explore the two
buildings that comprise Nintendo, we soon
realized that things weren't as they
seemed. The walls of fan art sent in by loval
followers, the strangely named cubicle
roads and conference rooms and the occa
sional dimly-lit niches filled with TVs and
game systems were definite signs of the at
titude Nintendo had with its employees.

"Every cubicle also has its
own TV and Gamecube
system," said Deanna
Guay, our tour guide
and a 15-year veteran of

consumer scrvice. After all the gaming
freaks (which was pretty much everyone
on the tour) had recovered from shock of
that news. Deanna led us to the "History of
Nintendo."
The feeling I got when 1 entered this
room was something akin to the amaze
ment the kids in "Willy Wonka" must have
felt when stepping into his candy factory.
Scattered everywhere were glass cases
filled with Nintendo merchandise from all
around the world. Makeshift aisles ot

cardboard game boxes showcased
all the best games Nintendo

hud ever made. Also
inside was a beauti
ful crvstal gallery

featuring portraits
of all of Ninten
do's beloved char-

i acter franchises.
Another set of
glass enclosures fea-

tured all of Nintendo's video
game systems, along with the story of the
video game giant's humble origins as a
small business that sold playing cards in
Japan.
The experience ended like any good
tour — with a first-hand look at the gift
shop. The one thing that stuck out as we
started to leave was a giant collection of
satellite photos of a beautiful house on the
side of a long corridor. I asked what it was
and where it was located. "Oh, it's a multi
million dollar house that Nintendo owns in
the tropics. Employees are given the
chance to go there once in a while for vaca
tion." As 1 left I could only think, "These
folks have it made."
The Conference
The next day, in between hours and
hours of playing unreleased game titles on
30 TVs littered around a giant conference
room, we had an informal conference with
several marketing managers about the cur-

rent goals of Nintendo. The biggest chal
lenge? Continuing to provide an inno
vative gaming experience without
alienating the older gamers and while
still appealing to the younger genera-

tion.
One of the problems that plagues
Nintendo is the "kiddie image"
that seems to follow the compa
» ny no matter where it goes. Nin
tendo contends that when all is

said and done, its games appeal
to a wide range of gamers, re
gardless of age. Such is the

main philosophy of Nintendo:
Everyone deserves the opportu-

nity to play a great game. Whether or
not the general public buys the "non
kiddie" argument is another matter.

Today, the cutting edge of the video
game legend lies in its new Nintendo DS

handheld system, which features
a dual-screen desicn and a
. . A

touch-screen for playing ti
tles with a stylus. One of the
titles that the conference fea-

tured. "Donkey Kong
Jungle Beat," is a full-

fledged DK plat
form title that is
a 11 — J i..

controlled entirely
with bongos.
Strange concept?
r\e c..„ •)

Of course, run?
More than you'd ever
think it could be.

The game is extremely in- *
tuitive considering the controls, and
there's just something irresistible about
slamming down on bongos really hard and

fast to destroy enemies on screen.
Other titles like Resident Evil 4
flaunt the still-awesome power of
the Gamecube (the visuals are sim-

ply jaw-dropping).

Departure

Rain was starting to fall as I climbed into
the shuttle for the Seattle airport and home.
For me, the weekend had been an enlighten-

ing experience. The

tour rocked, the

games were

great and
nothing
could be
more re
warding
than beat
ing up on

Nintendo employees in an
hour-long session in Smash Bros

Melee. I left with the impression that
Nintendo is still the great company I
loved as a kid, and I also gained a new ap
preciation for the inner workings of the
organization. I'm glad to know that this
giant won't be going away any time
soon.
