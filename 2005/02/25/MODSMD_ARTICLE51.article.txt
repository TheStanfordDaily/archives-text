### JENNIE KIM INTERMISSION BOOK CRITIC 
Authors adopting the "Stranger in a Strange
Land" approach have written some of the
sharpest, most insightful accounts of society
within their host countries. The granddaddy of
this method, of course, is Alexis de Tocqueville,
a Frenchman and some kind of genius, whose
1X46 masterpiece (and 1 mean that in the fullest,
most Puccini-esque sense of the word),
' Democracy in America," got this country and
its inhabitants so right, and about 80 years be
fore everyone else.
Economist reporter Christopher de Bel-

laigue is no Tocqueville (if he were I'd
have to marry him). That said, Bel
laigue's "In the Rose Garden of the
Martyrs: A Memoir of Iran" provides a
perceptive, though often elliptical,
journalistic account of contemporary
Iran and its ghosts, embodied by the
veterans of the 1979 Islamic Revolu
tion and its subsequent eight-year war
with Iraq. "In Iran," Bellaigue notes,
"the beloved monuments are not

buildings but gardens." The book's title refers to
an actual cemetery in an Iranian province where
7,000 of the estimated 134,000 fallen soldiers are
buried.
Bellaigue, a Briton who lives in Tehran with
his Iranian wife, adopts a lyrical, spare style to
weave historical lessons with narratives drawn
from his own experience and from personal in-

of the Martyrs: A
Memoir of Iran"

terviews. This technique paints a picture of Iran
ian society that is both blurry and complex, a lit
erary version of one of those poster-sized pixi
lated photographs that, when viewed up-close, is
actually composed of thousands of tiny, detailed
snapshots.
Iran today, as Bellaigue describes it, is ideo
logically torn across generational fault lines,
crowded with young people (the median age is
23 and a half) who have little knowledge of the
Islamic revolution and are increasingly resentful
of its legacy. Teens flock to Western-style malls,
where suburban rich girls ("matchsticks mari
nated in Chanel") get boys' attention by "rear
ranging their headscarves in public, by mistake

on purpose exhibiting their
hair." All P.D.A., even
hand-holding, is cause for
citation by the local morals
police, who have no
qualms about rifling
through girls' purses to
seize such contraband as
condoms and lipstick.
The author's inter
views with aging Iranian

veterans are particularly revealing. Speaking
wistfully, the veterans convey a palpable sense
of loss and longing for the national and religious
goals long ago thwarted by the agents of war, vi
olence and extreme repression. "These boys
were nothing like the boys you see on the streets
today. Nothing! They were clean!" cleric Rafi'i,
a former revolutionary, says emphatically to

Bellaigue while giving him a tour of a rose gar
den-cum-cemetery. "You have to be clean to be
a martyr," Rafi'i adds.
The government's political and social stran
glehold — Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is out
lawed for being too "energizing" — has left many

disillusioned. "A revolutionary state can't look
into the future," Bellaigue writes. "The Revolu
tion is everything, and it has already happened."
Reminders of Iran's unhappy past are every
where. After the revolution, "Thousands of
streets called after nightingales, angels and
pomegranates were given new names," Bel
laigue writes. He mimics a dialogue of someone
asking for directions in busy Tehran:
"Excuse me, madam, where's Martyr Khosh
bakht Alley?"
"Well, you go down Martyr Abbasian Street,
turn right into Martyr Araki Street, and then
turn left immediately after the Martyr Paki Gen
eral Hospital..."
Such descriptions give readers an apprecia
tion of the prominence of martyrdom, Islam and
nationalism in even the most mundane details of
Iranian society, where causes and death are fea
tured, and life "is like listening to the sea in a
shell."
Beyond these social descriptions, Bellaigue
steers clear of direct criticism or political analy
sis. He also glosses over the highly charged role
of Shi'ite religion in Iranian politics, a conscious
choice that strengthens the narrative direction
of the book: It is a memoir, not a political science
essay. Islam is too often cast in monolithic terms,
a trap that Bellaigue does well to avoid; instead,
he uses religion to establish a broader set of con
texts that gives social interactions meaning. In
the big blurry poster of Iran, the picture is of
Islam, but we can't help being drawn down to
the level of the pixels.


Things are very different in Iran from how they are in
the United States. But people still smoke, apparently.

turn right into Martyr Araki Street, and then
turn left immediately after the Martyr Paki Gen
eral Hospital..."
Such descriptions give readers an apprecia
tion of the prominence of martyrdom, Islam and
nationalism in even the most mundane details of
Iranian society, where causes and death are fea
tured, and life "is like listening to the sea in a
shell."
Beyond these social descriptions, Bellaigue
steers clear of direct criticism or political analy
sis. He also glosses over the highly charged role
of Shi'ite religion in Iranian politics, a conscious
choice that strengthens the narrative direction
of the book: It is a memoir, not a political science
essay. Islam is too often cast in monolithic terms,
a trap that Bellaigue does well to avoid; instead,
he uses religion to establish a broader set of con
texts that gives social interactions meaning. In
the big blurry poster of Iran, the picture is of
Islam, but we can't help being drawn down to
the level of the pixels.


Things are very different in Iran from how they are in
the United States. But people still smoke, apparently.
Authors adopting the "Stranger in a Strange
Land" approach have written some of the
sharpest, most insightful accounts of society
within their host countries. The granddaddy of
this method, of course, is Alexis de Tocqueville,
a Frenchman and some kind of genius, whose
1X46 masterpiece (and 1 mean that in the fullest,
most Puccini-esque sense of the word),
' Democracy in America," got this country and
its inhabitants so right, and about 80 years be
fore everyone else.
Economist reporter Christopher de Bel-

laigue is no Tocqueville (if he were I'd
have to marry him). That said, Bel
laigue's "In the Rose Garden of the
Martyrs: A Memoir of Iran" provides a
perceptive, though often elliptical,
journalistic account of contemporary
Iran and its ghosts, embodied by the
veterans of the 1979 Islamic Revolu
tion and its subsequent eight-year war
with Iraq. "In Iran," Bellaigue notes,
"the beloved monuments are not

buildings but gardens." The book's title refers to
an actual cemetery in an Iranian province where
7,000 of the estimated 134,000 fallen soldiers are
buried.
Bellaigue, a Briton who lives in Tehran with
his Iranian wife, adopts a lyrical, spare style to
weave historical lessons with narratives drawn
from his own experience and from personal in-

terviews. This technique paints a picture of Iran
ian society that is both blurry and complex, a lit
erary version of one of those poster-sized pixi
lated photographs that, when viewed up-close, is
actually composed of thousands of tiny, detailed
snapshots.
Iran today, as Bellaigue describes it, is ideo
logically torn across generational fault lines,
crowded with young people (the median age is
23 and a half) who have little knowledge of the
Islamic revolution and are increasingly resentful
of its legacy. Teens flock to Western-style malls,
where suburban rich girls ("matchsticks mari
nated in Chanel") get boys' attention by "rear
ranging their headscarves in public, by mistake

on purpose exhibiting their
hair." All P.D.A., even
hand-holding, is cause for
citation by the local morals
police, who have no
qualms about rifling
through girls' purses to
seize such contraband as
condoms and lipstick.
The author's inter
views with aging Iranian

veterans are particularly revealing. Speaking
wistfully, the veterans convey a palpable sense
of loss and longing for the national and religious
goals long ago thwarted by the agents of war, vi
olence and extreme repression. "These boys
were nothing like the boys you see on the streets
today. Nothing! They were clean!" cleric Rafi'i,
a former revolutionary, says emphatically to

Bellaigue while giving him a tour of a rose gar
den-cum-cemetery. "You have to be clean to be
a martyr," Rafi'i adds.
The government's political and social stran
glehold — Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is out
lawed for being too "energizing" — has left many

disillusioned. "A revolutionary state can't look
into the future," Bellaigue writes. "The Revolu
tion is everything, and it has already happened."
Reminders of Iran's unhappy past are every
where. After the revolution, "Thousands of
streets called after nightingales, angels and
pomegranates were given new names," Bel
laigue writes. He mimics a dialogue of someone
asking for directions in busy Tehran:
"Excuse me, madam, where's Martyr Khosh
bakht Alley?"
"Well, you go down Martyr Abbasian Street,
turn right into Martyr Araki Street, and then
turn left immediately after the Martyr Paki Gen
eral Hospital..."
