# Bechtle: When a camera just isn't enough
## 
### MELISSA R. SINGSON INTERMISSION ANGLOPHILE 
Robert Bechtle's paintings show
us a world unique to the artist's own
time and place. In most of his paint
ings, Bechtle transports us to 1970s
Bay Area suburbia, complete with
glaring white California sunshine and
beastly wood-paneled station wagons
dominating driveways.
A photorealist of the utmost skill.

Bechtle's paintings take scenes
from a photo lens and re-create
them down to the smallest de
tail on canvas. For Bechtle, his
camera is his sketchbook. But
then why, one might ask,
would he paint at all? Why not
just take the photograph in
stead?

:
After a few minutes at
Bechtle's retrospective at SF
MOMA, the answer to these

questions becomes pretty clear. On
the surface, the exhibit is a hugely in
teresting journey from decade to

decade and from suburbia to the city.
But it also moves from totally clean

evocations of pho
tographs on canvas to a
more painterly style, with
dry brushwork and com
plicated colour choices.
And all the while, Bechtle
maintains the precise de
tail worthy of the banner
of photorealism.
In Bechtle's later work

— mostly
scenes of
geometric
grids of
townhouses
set against
the hills of
San Francis
co — the

painter's individual presence starts to
show through. This is never too,obvi
ous, of course — photo-realisrfl|still
remains key* But in order to achieve

the atmosphere of San Francisco's
Richmond district, with those boxy

houses and that
muggy con
fused weather,
Bechtle forgoes
the bright ex
panses that
characterized
the planes of his
earlier work. In
stead, he uses
dabs of paint for

a subtle texture
and complementary colours to fill in
form and shadow.

This is of course
not unlike everyone's
favourite Impres
sionists, but what's
wrong with that? Im
pressionists have long
used this technique to
reflect their own
unique visions of re
ality— in Bechtle's
case, this vision builds

upon an artistic experience
anchored in photorealism.
And what of people? At
first, Bechtle's interpreta
tion of individuals in his art
work seems readily appar
ent. The exhibition begins
with interior views that are
more than a little Hopper-

esque: fragmented lonely figures, re
flections, glass and mirrors. As he
moves into the suburban scenes that
are the nride of the retrosoective.

Bechtle's interpretations of people be
come increasingly detailed. But at the
same time, he often denies us a feeling

of intimacy — or
even familiarity —
with his subjects.
There's something
about the way Bech
tle paints his figures
that marks a clear
separation between
us and them. Maybe
it's how they look at
us. Of course, this

may all be a
consequence
of working
from snap
shots — since
the subjects
know the
photograph
er, the expres-

sions on their faces tell us that whoev
er's looking at them should know who
they are. But we don't. The tension is
complex, and in the end we might be

better off trying to relate to the cars in
the setting (in his earlier work, Bech
tle's intense fascination with the auto
mobile is obvious). For this reason I
might hesitate before discussing
"emotion" in Bechtle's work. Perhaps
it's there — but then again, perhaps it
isn't.
Regardless, anyone who's ever
spent time in or around San Francisco
will truly enjoy the scenes that he
evokes. For Bay Area diehards, the
show is a must.
