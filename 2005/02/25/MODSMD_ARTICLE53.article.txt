### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
It is said that life passes in the
blink of an eye, and as winter quarter
approaches the bottom of the ninth,
you've got to agree time flies even
when you're not having fun. So in the
two weeks before finals — and in the
five before baseball season officially
begins — Roxy wants you to look at

your score
board

and
ask.

"What's

MY batting
average?"

Whatever it is, now is the time. In
just a few weeks, you'll he busy with
work and then break and then it's
spring fever abound, and you can
rest assured your player of choice
will be getting without you. So now is
the time to really pull through and
assert yourself with whoever has
shortened your breath, knotted your
stomach, and heated your nether-re
gions in just passing by with his im
pressive, sturdy bat (or her cushiony
gloves). If you haven't had much
practice, then your stats are easily
swayed, and you've got everything to
gain. If you're a regular batter, al-

ways up and ready to swing, then this
is the tune to show off not only how
you hit but how you do it with style,
champ, outfield, whatever
... no one is out of your range, and
what better way to slide into dead
week than feeling relaxed, satisfied,
and already accomplished?
Let's take it back to 1992. Always
trust a classic play, and you'll get
your classic (though not always
classy) play yourself. Two outs. Two
i strikes. Bottom of the ninth. Game

7. You're Cabrera, with your own
Sid Bream on second. Your past
two crushes didn't work. Your

■ two half-assed attempts with this
object of desire didn't prove all
that successful. This is it: Week
7. Time flies, but now so will
your batting, your A-game. You

<Sr are the Atlanta's Braves, and your
shot WILI. be heard around the
world (or not. to save embarrass
ment ... but it COULD. r. and
that's what counts). Roxy knows
what it's like to hit one out of the
park, and this is your coaching lesson
trom one who does AND teaches.
So before you go home for spring
break, make sure you've rounded all
four bases already, because you
don't want to stay standing antsy on
third, in your own field of dreams
about the person you've been wanti
ng. No. That's not you. is it? Only if
you build it, will you get to cum. You
can be the Bream who scores home
by a few, hard-fought-for inches.
And if you play hard, like Roxy, you
can score again and again, and not
just by a few, rock-hard inches.
