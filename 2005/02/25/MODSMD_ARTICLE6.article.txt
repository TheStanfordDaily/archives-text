More than 150 Stanford communi
ty members gathered to hear a panel
of nationally recognized historians
and journalists discuss the history,cul
ture and media representation of the
American West at Jordan Mali last
night. The presenters discussed the
ways in which those living on the West
Coast can participate more effectively
in national discussions of political, so
cial and cultural issues.
"Tonight we are initialing a con
versation about the region's identity
in the media and in the culture more

broadly and about how the West can
speak with a louder voice in political,
social and cultural matters at the na
tional and international level," said
David Kennedy, professor of history
and director of the Center for the
Study of the North American West.
Kevin Starr, one of the forum's
three keynote speakers and a director
emeritus of the National Museum of
American History in Washington,
D.C., emphasized the importance of
"reconnecting the history of the West
to the national experience."
Starr also expressed concern over
West Coast influence in natl. issues

"the growing centralization of American
culture and the consequential provincial
ization of our regions."
"Think of it in terms of newspapers," he
said, referring to the waning presence of in
dependent regional papers. "That national
discourse — in newspaper and other terms
as well — is defining itself through fewer
and fewer outlets."
Panelists also discussed the West's
unique demography and its image in popu
lar culture.
"What the West is in particular is a place
where waves of people have come, and
have either chosen to assimilate or chosen
to remain distinct," said Roger Kennedy,
professor of history at the University of
Southern California.
"One of the wonders about the Ameri
can bouillabaisse is that it isn't all one simi
lar thing; it's a bunch of carrots and onions
and it's very distinct," he added.
Betsy Marston, editor of The High
Country News in Paonia, CO, cited the
need for the West to have "a society to
match the scenery."
"We need people who want to leave a
city and bring their brain with them," she
said.
"We want to raise the question of why it
is that, despite the continuing political and
economic influence of California and the
West, the East coast oftentimes sets the
media agenda for the rest of the country,"
said Margaret O'Mara, an assistant profes
sor of history. "Why is it that the main voic
es come from New York and East coast
cities when Silicon Valley and Hollywood
are the most influential places for technolo

gy and culture today? Why do so many
Stanford students move to the East coast
after they graduate?" O'Mara is also the
deputy director of the Center for the Study
of the North American West.
Founded in 2002, the Center for the
Study of the North American West is dedi
cated to multi-disciplinary research of "the
West's past, present and future, in all di
mensions — historical, environmental, cul
tural. demographic, political and techno
logical." David Kennedy said. "It is also
committed to making Stanford into a re
sponsible and engaged regional citizen, a
place where scholars and policymakers,
journalists, artists and others can engage in
a meaningful conversation about this re
gion."
The Center is sponsoring an undergrad
uate internship program this summer at
Yellowstone National Park, which will be
the first program of its kind. According to
O'Mara, many promising candidates have
applied for the two to three available slots.
Co-sponsored by Stanford's Center for
the Study of the North American West and
the John S. Knight Fellowships Program,
the public forum was the first part of a two
day event entitled "Starting West: The Re
gion's Identity and Image in National
Media and Culture."
The event concludes today with a pri
vate conference of representatives from na
tional media outlets, including the New
York Times. Wall Street Journal, Los An
geles Times, KQED and the "MacNeil/
Lehrer Newshour." Organizers said they
hope the event will foster a deeper public
dialogue about the West.

the public forum was the first part of a two
day event entitled "Starting West: The Re
gion's Identity and Image in National
Media and Culture."
The event concludes today with a pri
vate conference of representatives from na
tional media outlets, including the New
York Times. Wall Street Journal, Los An
geles Times, KQED and the "MacNeil/
Lehrer Newshour." Organizers said they
hope the event will foster a deeper public
dialogue about the West.
More than 150 Stanford communi
ty members gathered to hear a panel
of nationally recognized historians
and journalists discuss the history,cul
ture and media representation of the
American West at Jordan Mali last
night. The presenters discussed the
ways in which those living on the West
Coast can participate more effectively
in national discussions of political, so
cial and cultural issues.
"Tonight we are initialing a con
versation about the region's identity
in the media and in the culture more

broadly and about how the West can
speak with a louder voice in political,
social and cultural matters at the na
tional and international level," said
David Kennedy, professor of history
and director of the Center for the
Study of the North American West.
Kevin Starr, one of the forum's
three keynote speakers and a director
emeritus of the National Museum of
American History in Washington,
D.C., emphasized the importance of
"reconnecting the history of the West
to the national experience."
Starr also expressed concern over
West Coast influence in natl. issues

"the growing centralization of American
culture and the consequential provincial
ization of our regions."
"Think of it in terms of newspapers," he
said, referring to the waning presence of in
dependent regional papers. "That national
discourse — in newspaper and other terms
as well — is defining itself through fewer
and fewer outlets."
Panelists also discussed the West's
unique demography and its image in popu
lar culture.
"What the West is in particular is a place
where waves of people have come, and
have either chosen to assimilate or chosen
to remain distinct," said Roger Kennedy,
professor of history at the University of
Southern California.
"One of the wonders about the Ameri
can bouillabaisse is that it isn't all one simi
lar thing; it's a bunch of carrots and onions
and it's very distinct," he added.
Betsy Marston, editor of The High
Country News in Paonia, CO, cited the
need for the West to have "a society to
match the scenery."
"We need people who want to leave a
city and bring their brain with them," she
said.
"We want to raise the question of why it
is that, despite the continuing political and
economic influence of California and the
West, the East coast oftentimes sets the
media agenda for the rest of the country,"
said Margaret O'Mara, an assistant profes
sor of history. "Why is it that the main voic
es come from New York and East coast
cities when Silicon Valley and Hollywood
are the most influential places for technolo

gy and culture today? Why do so many
Stanford students move to the East coast
after they graduate?" O'Mara is also the
deputy director of the Center for the Study
of the North American West.
Founded in 2002, the Center for the
Study of the North American West is dedi
cated to multi-disciplinary research of "the
West's past, present and future, in all di
mensions — historical, environmental, cul
tural. demographic, political and techno
logical." David Kennedy said. "It is also
committed to making Stanford into a re
sponsible and engaged regional citizen, a
place where scholars and policymakers,
journalists, artists and others can engage in
a meaningful conversation about this re
gion."
The Center is sponsoring an undergrad
uate internship program this summer at
Yellowstone National Park, which will be
the first program of its kind. According to
O'Mara, many promising candidates have
applied for the two to three available slots.
Co-sponsored by Stanford's Center for
the Study of the North American West and
the John S. Knight Fellowships Program,
the public forum was the first part of a two
day event entitled "Starting West: The Re
gion's Identity and Image in National
Media and Culture."
The event concludes today with a pri
vate conference of representatives from na
tional media outlets, including the New
York Times. Wall Street Journal, Los An
geles Times, KQED and the "MacNeil/
Lehrer Newshour." Organizers said they
hope the event will foster a deeper public
dialogue about the West.
