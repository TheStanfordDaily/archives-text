# Ziff a gathering place for all
## Jewish center dedicated 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hundreds of people took part in the dedication ceremony
for the Harold and Libby Ziff Center for Jewish Life yester
day. The facility, made possible by several donors and Hillel
at Stanford, will ensure that the Ziff name lives on, said Lela
Sarnat, the Ziffs' daughter.
According to Sarnat — whose father died 10 years ago —
when the last of his generation dies, the Ziff name will die with
them. It was for this reason that Sarnat, a Stanford alumnae,
felt that naming this center after her parents, Harold and
Libby Ziff, was so important.
As Sarnat affixed the specially made mezuzah to the front
entrance of the house, the people gathered in front of the cen
ter said a blessing. The mezuzah is a small reminder of God's
presence affixed to the doors of Jewish homes.
Former President of Stanford Hillel Robert Rosenzweig
said at the dedication ceremony that for the "Hillel old
timers," believing in the possibility of a Hillel building in the
center of campus was fora long time a
"triumph of hope over experience."
The ceremony began at Kresge
Auditorium with several speakers and
later moved to the Ziff house, located
at 565 Mayfield Avenue.
Since the 1 l /7()s, Stanford Hillel was lo
cated in Old Union. The move into a sep
arate building was the hope of many —
including Harold Ziff — fora longtime.
Although the center opened in
January, it was not officially dedicated
until now due to scheduling conflicts.
The dedication began with several
speakers, including students from
Hillel, University President John
Hennessy, former President Don
Kennedy and the keynote speaker,
Richard Levin, president of Yale Uni
versity. Levin graduated from Stan
ford in I %8.

Each of the speakers touched on
the central theme of community,
stressing that though the center is fo
cused on the Jewish community, the
purpose of the Ziff house should be to
include all students on campus.
"Stanford is an invitation to self
discovery," Levin said. "We have the
responsibility to engage those least
like us."
Adina Danzig, the executive direc
tor of Hillel, emphasized that "build
ings are not the focal point of our lives,
how we live in them is."
She also thanked members of
Stanford's Jewish community who
helped make the first phase of the
Ziff Center possible.
Hillel was granted a 51-year lease
for the house in 2(XX) by the Stanford
Management Company.
Hillel plans to continue to expand its
offerings by adding a 10,(XX) square-foot
structure behind the center. This build
ing will include a kosher kitchen, a din
ing rtxim, a cafe, a lounge and prayer
and meeting spaces.
