## I Sing the Body Dyspeptic 
### 
My body hates me. I'm sure of it
now, though I wasn't at first.
When the wheezing and hack
ing started two weeks ago, I was fully
sympathetic. After all, the end of win
ter quarter is the worst time of the year.
It's the usual approach to finals —
but with wind, rain and the accompany
ing susceptibility to disease. Add on the
pesky California cloud cover (Look!
It's sunny! Ha! Tricked you! It's not!)
and the tentatively blossoming vegeta
tion has brought us to that miserable
and diagnosticallyawkward time when
colds and allergies look an awful lot
alike.
We're pushing ourselves down the
home stretch — more work and less
sleep, all coming at the end of two
months of accumulated deprivation.

We're frenetically
scrabbling for both
a social life and a
Stanford degree,
and we're sacrific
ing our health in the
process.
Ultimately,
though, we won't be
much worse off for
not taking that extra
class or joining an-

other club, but the under-eye circles
and ulcers leave permanent damage.
With that in mind, I took my body to
Vaden, even though I didn't really have
the time. The Vaden doctor called it
viral bronchitis, so I've been dutifully
inhaling a nasty albuterol spray since.
The recent appearance of new
symptoms, however, is puzzling. Bron
chitis germs aren't supposed to cause
spinal stiffness or facial tics. In fact, I
don't think any non-human organism
causes spinal stiffness or facial tics. And
if no other organism is causing this,
then I can only conclude one thing: my
body is sabotaging me.
Science claims it's a virus-led cellu
lar-metabolism takeover, but all it's re
ally proven is that viruses are using my
enzymes. Science tends to discount
higher functions — feeling, resent
ment, ill intentions. How do I know, re
ally, that my cells aren't just offering up
their machinery to all comers?
After all, this is Stanford. Despite
dealing with over-scheduling and set
ting aggressive goals, we take care of
our bodies. I have a TA who runs her
miles every morning, rain or shine. She
got the flu.
I have a friend who bikes out to the
gym to train for competitive Wushu,
whether or not she's gotten any sleep
the night before. She's been feeling fa
tigue, stiffness and knee pain.
While not quite as dedicated, I, too,
value my body. I may push it a little dur
ing the week, but we've committed to a
lifelong partnership, one that moves us
toward a holistic ultimate objective. I
stay up a night here and there, but it will
all pay off when I'm successful and fab
ulously wealthy. Once I've gotten
through these years, I'll sleep eight
hours a night and prescription drugs
will take carre of the rest.
My body isn't waiting for the payoff.
Last week, I cut one night of sleep and
my suddenly uncoordinated eyes and
hands directed my car into a curb. The
day after, all systems shut down while I
was trying to finish a take-home
midterm.
Now we have some serious prob
lems. I have a C-. I have a flat tire. The
body has just had a couple of late
nights. It's become clear that the mortal
coil doesn't have my best interests at
heart.
I think a divorce is in order. I like the
idea of an eternal spirit, but I can't say
that I really trust it, so I'm going for the
mystic approach. I've done the prelimi
nary Google search, and I've book
marked some promising Web guides to
an out-of-body experience. I can try
hypnosis, meditation or imagery tech
niques. If those don't do it, I'm guaran
teed success with LSD.
But finding a hypnotherapist, a Zen
zone, a drug dealer — all these things
take time, even more time than hiking
out to Vaden. I'm on the home stretch.
I've got term papers to write and my
presentation isn't making itself.
For now, there's only one sensible
thing fora sick student to do — suck it
up and buckle down. Spring break will
be here soon, and there will be plenty of
time for sleep and opportunity for sub
stance abuse.
Meanwhile, there's some possibility
that I'm irreparably scarring my sys
tems, but if all else fails — I'm graduat
ing from Stanford. I can pay the bills.

I'm bad with concentration, so I'm pretty
sure I'll need the drugs. Write me at
igliu@stanford.edu if you can hook me up.

toward a holistic ultimate objective. I
stay up a night here and there, but it will
all pay off when I'm successful and fab
ulously wealthy. Once I've gotten
through these years, I'll sleep eight
hours a night and prescription drugs
will take carre of the rest.
My body isn't waiting for the payoff.
Last week, I cut one night of sleep and
my suddenly uncoordinated eyes and
hands directed my car into a curb. The
day after, all systems shut down while I
was trying to finish a take-home
midterm.
Now we have some serious prob
lems. I have a C-. I have a flat tire. The
body has just had a couple of late
nights. It's become clear that the mortal
coil doesn't have my best interests at
heart.
I think a divorce is in order. I like the
idea of an eternal spirit, but I can't say
that I really trust it, so I'm going for the
mystic approach. I've done the prelimi
nary Google search, and I've book
marked some promising Web guides to
an out-of-body experience. I can try
hypnosis, meditation or imagery tech
niques. If those don't do it, I'm guaran
teed success with LSD.
But finding a hypnotherapist, a Zen
zone, a drug dealer — all these things
take time, even more time than hiking
out to Vaden. I'm on the home stretch.
I've got term papers to write and my
presentation isn't making itself.
For now, there's only one sensible
thing fora sick student to do — suck it
up and buckle down. Spring break will
be here soon, and there will be plenty of
time for sleep and opportunity for sub
stance abuse.
Meanwhile, there's some possibility
that I'm irreparably scarring my sys
tems, but if all else fails — I'm graduat
ing from Stanford. I can pay the bills.

I'm bad with concentration, so I'm pretty
sure I'll need the drugs. Write me at
igliu@stanford.edu if you can hook me up.

My body hates me. I'm sure of it
now, though I wasn't at first.
When the wheezing and hack
ing started two weeks ago, I was fully
sympathetic. After all, the end of win
ter quarter is the worst time of the year.
It's the usual approach to finals —
but with wind, rain and the accompany
ing susceptibility to disease. Add on the
pesky California cloud cover (Look!
It's sunny! Ha! Tricked you! It's not!)
and the tentatively blossoming vegeta
tion has brought us to that miserable
and diagnosticallyawkward time when
colds and allergies look an awful lot
alike.
We're pushing ourselves down the
home stretch — more work and less
sleep, all coming at the end of two
months of accumulated deprivation.

We're frenetically
scrabbling for both
a social life and a
Stanford degree,
and we're sacrific
ing our health in the
process.
Ultimately,
though, we won't be
much worse off for
not taking that extra
class or joining an-

other club, but the under-eye circles
and ulcers leave permanent damage.
With that in mind, I took my body to
Vaden, even though I didn't really have
the time. The Vaden doctor called it
viral bronchitis, so I've been dutifully
inhaling a nasty albuterol spray since.
The recent appearance of new
symptoms, however, is puzzling. Bron
chitis germs aren't supposed to cause
spinal stiffness or facial tics. In fact, I
don't think any non-human organism
causes spinal stiffness or facial tics. And
if no other organism is causing this,
then I can only conclude one thing: my
body is sabotaging me.
Science claims it's a virus-led cellu
lar-metabolism takeover, but all it's re
ally proven is that viruses are using my
enzymes. Science tends to discount
higher functions — feeling, resent
ment, ill intentions. How do I know, re
ally, that my cells aren't just offering up
their machinery to all comers?
After all, this is Stanford. Despite
dealing with over-scheduling and set
ting aggressive goals, we take care of
our bodies. I have a TA who runs her
miles every morning, rain or shine. She
got the flu.
I have a friend who bikes out to the
gym to train for competitive Wushu,
whether or not she's gotten any sleep
the night before. She's been feeling fa
tigue, stiffness and knee pain.
While not quite as dedicated, I, too,
value my body. I may push it a little dur
ing the week, but we've committed to a
lifelong partnership, one that moves us
toward a holistic ultimate objective. I
stay up a night here and there, but it will
all pay off when I'm successful and fab
ulously wealthy. Once I've gotten
through these years, I'll sleep eight
hours a night and prescription drugs
