# The 						road to Dollie destiny

### JENNY BAER JENNIFER LIU 
Feel like a slave to problem sets? The thought ofanother
paper makes you ill? Add two crazy weeks of dance audi
tions and interviews with the Stanford Band and you have
the life of a Dollie dreamer.
In the wee hours of Feb. 20, five Dollies emerged victori
ous from a group of 23 women. The process included both
friendly workshops and clinics led by the now-former Dol
lies and three rounds of dreaded cuts.
In the traditional order of height from shortest to tallest,
the new Dollies are freshmen Maili Alvarado, Lauri Ander
son, Liz Schackmann, Katie Ambrose and Stacie Vilendrer.
In order to give Daily readers an idea of what it takes to be
come a Dollie, we followed the aspiring women through the
process.
Information Session: Jan. 31,8 p.m.
Assistant Band manager Mike Priest, a sophomore,
dubbed the girls at the information session "Pro-Dos,"
which he said was"the cuter version of a Prospective Dollie,
and the greatest thing to be besides a Dollie Proper," or of
ficial Dollie. The current Dollies — sophomores Megan
Hoarfrost, Lisa Asari, Nicole D'Arcy, Jessica Whitten and
Carrie Edwards — outlined the audition process and en
couraged the Pro-Dos to come to them with whatever ques
tions they had.
"I came here to find out more about what being a Dollie
is like," said freshman Sarah Schoknecht. "I've done ballet,
modern dance and jazz since I was five, but I've never been
a cheerleader. I wanted to try something different and dance
for the Band."
Junior Megan Heinan, who was a cheerleader in high
school, said that being a Dollie was a lifelong dream.
"I was born in Stanford Hospital, so I've been here fora
while," she said. "I've wanted to be a Dollie since day one.
I'm also friends with [2003-2004 Dollie] Melanie Atmadja. I
borrowed her Dollie dress for Halloween last year, and I
wore it for three days straight."
The current Dollies emphasized that they were not part
of the selection process.
"The older Dollies will be the ones deciding, so we don't
want you to feel intimidated if you have any questions at all,"
Whitten said. "We're on your side."
Workshops and Clinics: Feb. 2 to Feb. 15
Pro-Dos were required to memorize three dances: an eas
ier, "traditional" Dollie dance, a more technical dance
choreographed by the 2004-2005 Dollies and one they chore
ograph themselves to a Band song. Pro-Dos were given CDs
of the music to practice to between the five workshops of
fered to work on the dances.

Each 2004-200" Dollk- also hosted a clinic, which were
sessions smaller than the workshop and designed to give
Pro-Das a chance to ask questions or learn difficult chore
ography on a oneiqn-One level
"It's nice to have the current Dollies be so informal, so ex
cited and so supportive of us," Anderson said. "They really
want to see us succeed."
Ambrose came down with bronchitis after the first Dollie
workshop and was sick for the duration of the audition pro
cess, often left sitting out with an inhaler for much of the
practices.
"It was difficult being sick and kind of stressful," she said.
"But you could still tell what my dancing abilities were. A lot
of the other girls were really sweet and supportive of my ill
ness, though, and I just had a lot of fun getting to know the
rest of them."
First Cuts: Feb. 16, 6 p.m.
More people auditioned this year than in years past. This
year's 23 auditioned in front of former Dollies and Band
management at Elliot Practice Center for the first round of
cuts, which focused mostly on technical ability.
Vilendrer said that Band members, who also attended the
first round, promoted a relaxed atmosphere.
"It was a really laid-back performance," she said. "The
Band threw food at the outgoing Dollies as a joke, and
there were skits and little performances in between the
auditions. Somebody performed a song, one kid got a
haircut."
Some Pro-Dos were excited to meet former Dollies, and
others enjoyed what they felt was a family environment of
the "mom Dollies" — the 2004-2005 Dollies and the "grand
ma Dollies"" — the 2003-2004 dollies.
Alvarado said that she was more nervous going into the
first round of cuts than she was at any other time.
"I didn't know what to expect at all," she said. "But the
old Dollies were great. They obviously know how to judge
dance."
Second Cuts: Feb. 19, 8 a.m.
Twelve Pro-Dos were contacted and informed of their
advancement to round two shortly after the first round
ended. Second cuts took place on Saturday morning, Feb 19,
appropriately dubbed "Dollie Day." The auditions for the
second round had a greater focus on performance than on
technical ability.
"I thought it was more about personality," Alvarado said.
"It was kind of like [the Band] was testing us to see if we had
enough stamina to put up with them."
Anderson was already a drummer in the Band and audi
tioned because she got a first-hand view of what the Dollies
did. She said she especially liked how vocally responsive the

Band was to the performers during this portion of the audi
tions. "I've never experienced anything like that in an audi
tion ever," she said.
Third Cuts: Feb. 19,10 p.m.
Eight women were called back to the Band Shak for the
final round of auditions several hours after the second round
of auditions. Instead of dancing, the Pro-Dos were inter
viewed by Band members, who asked questions to deter
mine each candidate's ability to deal with the busy, hectic
lifestyle of a Dollie.
Vilendrer said that the purpose of the interviews was to
introduce the Pro-Dos to the Band and to make sure that
they were "compatible" with Band members. Alvarado
agreed.
"All of the girls were so talented," she said. "I really
didn't know what was going to happen, going into the inter
view. I didn't expect anything at all, but obviously I'm glad it
turned out the way it did."
The interviews ended at 2 a.m. and by 6 a.m., the five cho
sen ones were rolled out — they had been selected to be the
official Dollies for the 2005-2006 school year.
Life as a Dollie
Starting last week, the 2005-2006 Dollies held practices
four days a week for two hours a day in preparation for
Dollie Splash in May, the official 10-dance initiation of the
new Dollies that will take place in White Plaza. Being a
Dollie is an enormous time commitment, since all five are
expected to accompany the Band and attend certain rallies
and events.
"I'm still not sure of everything [being a Dollie] entails
yet, but I know that we'll be dancing anywhere that the Band
is," said Vilendrer. "And the Band really loves the Dollies,
so they'll take good care of us."
Ambrose, who has no other cheerleading experience,
danced for her high school varsity dance program, which was
cancelled before her senior year because school authorities
felt that the team's dances were "too sexual." Next year, she
looks forward to cheering on the sports teams, especially the
menis basketball team.
"I would love to perform for the Sixth Man Club," she
said.
Anderson, who was already part of the Band, said that
she hadn't really thought about becoming a Dollie until the
audition process.
"I went to the first rehearsal and thought I might as well
go to the second one,i she said. iAnd after I went to the sec
ond one I thought that I'd just go to the next one. As the
weeks went on, I became more and more excited. It's so ap
parent from all the old Dollies — none of them would have
been Dollies if they hadn't loved it."
