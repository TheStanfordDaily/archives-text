# Honduras provides public health venue
## 
### COURTNEY WEAVER STAFF WRITER 
Though still a senior majoring in human
biology, Jennifer Miller has already had the
opportunity to work hands-on in the public
health field — something that is usually un
heard of for an undergraduate.
The Roatan Clinical and Public Health
Internship, available for pre-med students in
the Bay Area and started by Miller herself, is
one of the only public-health opportunities
for college students to not only shadow doc
tors but also to work directly with patients.
Miller learned this first-hand when she
became the first student to do the internship
this January.
"I had interned in Nepal and done a few
other internships [before going to Roatan]
but I hadn't had the experience of taking off
and running with something, and really feel
ing like I was making a difference."
Miller, a member of Scope, a pre-medical
program on campus, initiated and oversees
the internship through collaborating with
the non-profit organization Global Healing
which operates the Roatan Pediatric Clinic,
located 30 miles off the mainland coast of
Honduras.
The internship lasts for one month and is
offered in the summer and during the school
year. If completed during the school year,
the participants must take the semester off.
The clinic consists of one pediatric clinic
and one outpatient clinic, which is limited in
its number of staff and resources, creating

great need for additional help.
"The public hospital is really under
staffed, really under-medicated," Miller
said. "Having someone [like an undergradu
ate student] who really has the time to find
these resources is helpful. As a pre-med stu
dent, not only do you feel that you are learn
ing about medicine, but you also get to real
ly make a difference."
The intern does clinical work in the
morning and either public health-related
work or independent research in the after
noon.
Natalie Ramos, a Stanford junior who is
assistant director of the internship and cur
rently in Roatan as the program's second in
tern, described an intern's typical day.
"Students spend mornings working in the
pediatric clinic at the Public Hospital going
on rounds, shadowing [and] working direct
ly with patients to arrange medical proce
dures," Ramos said. "We also have the op
portunity to do our own public-health out
reach programs, work with a local HIV
counselor and work with doctors at other
clinics around the island."
Both Miller and Ramos have also had the
opportunity to take on individual patients'
cases.
Miller spent a significant amount of time
on finding treatment for an 11 year old who
would spit on the floor and could not spell
his own name. Miller was able to find fund
ing for the boy's trip to get a psychological
evaluation; he was diagnosed with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder and gave him a

prescription for Ritalin.
Though helping the hoy was a long pro
cess, Miller predicts this one case will bene
fit others to come.
"It seems like it's a lot of work for one pa
tient, hut I think we're going to see a lot of
psychological cases coming in," Miller said.
"[Because of this incident], we will have an
avenue now to address those types of is
sues."
Ramos also stressed the necessity for the
intern to take on individual cases such as
that of the young hoy.
"It's hard to believe how much the pa
tients have to fend for themselves," she said.

"There's no sort of universal health care
coverage at all and most patients know very
little about the system."
Ramos elaborated on why the internship
has been so meaningful.
"1 am very thankful that I've had the op
portunity to get to know the patients so inti
mately and play such a huge role in their
healthcare," she said. "For me, this is what
has made the internship so worthwhile."
Information sessions on the Roatan Clin
ical and Public Health Internship will be
held tonight and tomorrow night from 7 to 8
p.m. in the Oak West Room at Tresidder
Union.

little about the system."
Ramos elaborated on why the internship
has been so meaningful.
"1 am very thankful that I've had the op
portunity to get to know the patients so inti
mately and play such a huge role in their
healthcare," she said. "For me, this is what
has made the internship so worthwhile."

The Roatan Pediatric Clininc in Honduras is operated by Global Healing and allows stu
dents to work directly with patients through internships.
Though still a senior majoring in human
biology, Jennifer Miller has already had the
opportunity to work hands-on in the public
health field — something that is usually un
heard of for an undergraduate.
The Roatan Clinical and Public Health
Internship, available for pre-med students in
the Bay Area and started by Miller herself, is
one of the only public-health opportunities
for college students to not only shadow doc
tors but also to work directly with patients.
Miller learned this first-hand when she
became the first student to do the internship
this January.
"I had interned in Nepal and done a few
other internships [before going to Roatan]
but I hadn't had the experience of taking off
and running with something, and really feel
ing like I was making a difference."
Miller, a member of Scope, a pre-medical
program on campus, initiated and oversees
the internship through collaborating with
the non-profit organization Global Healing
which operates the Roatan Pediatric Clinic,
located 30 miles off the mainland coast of
Honduras.
The internship lasts for one month and is
offered in the summer and during the school
year. If completed during the school year,
the participants must take the semester off.
The clinic consists of one pediatric clinic
and one outpatient clinic, which is limited in
its number of staff and resources, creating

great need for additional help.
"The public hospital is really under
staffed, really under-medicated," Miller
said. "Having someone [like an undergradu
ate student] who really has the time to find
these resources is helpful. As a pre-med stu
dent, not only do you feel that you are learn
ing about medicine, but you also get to real
ly make a difference."
The intern does clinical work in the
morning and either public health-related
work or independent research in the after
noon.
Natalie Ramos, a Stanford junior who is
assistant director of the internship and cur
rently in Roatan as the program's second in
tern, described an intern's typical day.
"Students spend mornings working in the
pediatric clinic at the Public Hospital going
on rounds, shadowing [and] working direct
ly with patients to arrange medical proce
dures," Ramos said. "We also have the op
portunity to do our own public-health out
reach programs, work with a local HIV
counselor and work with doctors at other
clinics around the island."
Both Miller and Ramos have also had the
opportunity to take on individual patients'
cases.
Miller spent a significant amount of time
on finding treatment for an 11 year old who
would spit on the floor and could not spell
his own name. Miller was able to find fund
ing for the boy's trip to get a psychological
evaluation; he was diagnosed with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder and gave him a

prescription for Ritalin.
Though helping the hoy was a long pro
cess, Miller predicts this one case will bene
fit others to come.
"It seems like it's a lot of work for one pa
tient, hut I think we're going to see a lot of
psychological cases coming in," Miller said.
"[Because of this incident], we will have an
avenue now to address those types of is
sues."
Ramos also stressed the necessity for the
intern to take on individual cases such as
that of the young hoy.
"It's hard to believe how much the pa
tients have to fend for themselves," she said.

"There's no sort of universal health care
coverage at all and most patients know very
little about the system."
Ramos elaborated on why the internship
has been so meaningful.
"1 am very thankful that I've had the op
portunity to get to know the patients so inti
mately and play such a huge role in their
healthcare," she said. "For me, this is what
has made the internship so worthwhile."
