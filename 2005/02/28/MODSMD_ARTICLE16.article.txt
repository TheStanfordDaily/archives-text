## Editorial Social security matters to you 
### 
Dining hall conversations often revolve around the
Draw or meal plan changes. Occasionally, national is
sues come up, though a hit less often since November.
But have you heard anyone talking about social secu
rity lately? Let's face it, retirement is a long ways off,
and it's hard to think about life after work before your
career has even begun.
But possible changes to social security have hit the
national stage with a turbulent splash, and whatever
your ideological opinion, you should pay attention.
We're not going to come out in favor or against any
one of the many proposals circulating through the na
tional debate right now, but we think that students
should look at social security with at least as much in
terest as other voters. The plans are pitched at current
baby-boomers, supported by investment banking
firms, and the votes of current retirees will make or
break any change. But even though President George
W. Bush talked about how parents should support
changes for the sake of their children who are under
30, most politicians are counting our generation out of
the debate.
We shouldn't be counted out, because any
changes will impact us the most. We will have to con
tribute a payroll tax of 12.4 percent over our life
times, and that rate may increase. Either benefits or
taxes will have to change around 2042, before any of
us retire, when some estimates say the social securi
ty system is likely to not have enough money to cover

all its obligations. Finally, over working lifetimes,
the eventual benefits stand to be much less than we
put in. According to one economist at the Hoover In
stitution, students would have to live until they are
110 to get as much out of the social security system as
they contribute. Although social security is more of
an insurance program than an investment scheme,
110 years is a long time to wait.
We do think certain approaches to the social secu
rity debate are unproductive. Bush is touting the crisis
in social security, which is no more imminent than it
was a decade ago, as a reason to pitch privatization,
which won't deal with the financial woes of the pro
gram. In fact, privatization programs or personal ac
counts would increase the general deficit with the
need to fund the structural changes. Privatization, re
gardless of its benefits for individuals, will not solve
the problem of Social Security running out of money.
It should also not be used as a first step towards gut
ting overall benefits from the program.
Still, the discussion is probably good. Students
should enter the fray. Maybe investing more of your
money in the stock market makes more sense for you
than it does your parents. Maybe taxes should in
crease now rather than in twenty years when you
would bear the brunt of them. Perhaps you think so
cial security should expand or contract.
The debate is happening, and our voices are total
ly silent. Do you care?
