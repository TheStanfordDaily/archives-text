## The
						hardest years of your life? 
### 
I've been listening to a lot of Avril
Lavigne of late. Lovely girl. A little
young, of course, but she illustrates a
point: the undying appeal of
(teenage) angst.
The "teenage" was in parentheses,
because, worryingly, I do feel as if
Avril is speaking to me as well as to
those yet to graduate high school.
Now this may seem a little strange
(or rather I may seem a little strange).

However, despite the fact that one's voice no longer war
bles and that one's complexion is no longer cratered and
that girls are no longer terrifying (well maybe scratch that
last point), angst has not yet left us.
A few months ago I was catching up with an old friend,
Rich, over lunch when, as it is wont to do, the conversa
tion turned to the ongoing misery of existence.
After stumbling over whose life was the duller (he's a
lawyer. I'm a grad student, it's a close one) we decided
that a greater problem faced us than mere ennui.
It's an oft-stated "truth" that your teenage years are
the hardest to get through (just ask Miss Lavigne). After
all, you are struggling with finding out who you are. And
things are often Complicated (sorry, that was a terrible
pun, but I just couldn't help myself).
Having suffered through teenageship myself (albeit a
little late — it was all going on as I turned twenty), I had
some sympathy for the previous paragraph prior to com
ing to grad school.
Rich, though, had an alternative perspective. "I've
read," he said, "that it's not deciding who you are that's
so hard, it's realizing who you're not."
That got me thinking.

One of the most frightening things about growing up
is the eventual failure of childhood dreams. You will not
be an astronaut. You will not be a world-famous ballet
dancer. You will not be a world famous ballet-dancing as
tronaut. And so on.
Of course that realisation comes pretty early in life
(usually at about age 12, though I do know a couple of
people in physics who hold onto the astronaut thing).
However, the myth that you aren't ordinary, that you are
in some way "better" than the rest is the fuel that feeds us
through our teens.
Unless you are one of those rare and special types
(and I'd like you guys to know that I'm deeply resentful
of your success) that fuel will burn out sometime — I
may be stretching that "fuel" metaphor a little, you have
my apologies for the literary laziness.
So, getting back to the subject in question, as the ide
alism of college slips by the point will come when the
cold, hard truth of ordinariness will hit.
Sadly, that point appears to be now. It seems that the
latter half of one's twenties are angst-ridden years in
which one bids dreams goodbye and says hello t0...
Who knows.
That brings me to a final observation: If I were to step
back from the slow decay and take a wider view I would
probably point out that the lesson to learn is not that now
is harder than then, but rather that perhaps things never
really fall perfectly into place.

Sorry for the dearth of jokes. E-mail me at navinsQPstan
ford.edu if you feel deprived of the customary Monday hu
mour. Oh, and if you're still dreaming of ballet, don't de
spair— I'm sure that the flexibility will come in useful
somewhere.
