Coverage of forum on women's
choice one-sided
Marie-Jo Mont-Reynaud's arti
cle, "Forum reflects on a woman's
right to choose" (Feb. 24. 2005)
could not have been more slanted or
one sided. So many slogans, so little
time.
Most interesting is Reynaud's
quote of Maria Moreno, who asked
"If we are a pro-choice majority,
why is the threat to reproductive
rights greater than ever?"
Perhaps it is because so many
prospective supporters of abortion
have already been aborted.

Leifer's draft column dodges
other issues
Kalani Leifer's Op-ed "What's
more patriotic?" (Feb. 25) contains
factual, logical and rhetorical errors.
Leifer writes, "One of my prima
ry reasons for opposing the draft or
needing to register for it is its inher
ent inequality." But he does not
specify any inequalities in today's

selective service, and even ex
plained in a previous op-ed that a
potential draft would not exempt
college students. And why does
Leifer fail to mention the most glar
ing inequality of the system —the
full exemption of women? Even
conscientious objectors must regis
ter and would have to serve the
country in some respect if a draft
occurred, but women are not re
quired to register for non-combat
military service or even non-mili
tary service.
Contrary to his statement,
Leifer's objections about "inherent
inequality" are not related to a po
tential draft or registering for one.
Leifer's argument is really a red her
ring, as he subsequently claims that
"it is indeed the underprivileged, the
uneducated and, in many cases, the
minorities who end up fighting these
wars." If true, this situation could
not be due to selective service, and
so it does not support his critique of
"inherent inequality" in the U.S. sys
tem of military conscription. Mr.
Leifer entirely dodges the fact that
the United States has an all-volun
teer military.

Moreover. Leifer unfairly de
scribes those who "end up fighting
these wars." First, Leifer's claim
about "minorities" is not justified by
statistics. The Department of De
fense and the national news media
have reported throughout Operation
Iraqi Freedom that black and His
panic casualty rates are equal or
lower relative to the national make
up. More importantly, Leifer's con
cern for minorities being exploited
by the military is not shared by ser
vice members themselves. Second, it
is insulting and incorrect to call our
service members "uneducated."
With few exceptions, enlisted service
members have at least a high-school
education, and officers have at least a
college education. Third, the "under
privileged" choose the military as
their best opportunity, as all service
members do. Without this opportu
nity they necessarily would be doing
something they value less than mili
tary service. Leifer should take care
to describe these volunteers as they
really are —true patriots.
