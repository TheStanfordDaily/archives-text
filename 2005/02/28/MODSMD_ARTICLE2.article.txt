### CHUAN-MEI LEE DESK EDITOR 
Roughly 250 Stanford students, faculty and community
members registered to attend the fourth annual Stanford
Conference on International Development on Saturday at
the Graduate School of Business. Panelists discussed world
health issues, including HIV/AIDS, and how students can
get involved.
Organized by the Stanford Association for International
Development, or SAID, and the GSB International Devel
opment Club, the conference focused on the theme of im
proving health care access in developing nations.
Conference organizers indicated that health care is a key
issue within the field of international development — a rea
son why the topic was chosen for this year's conference.
"[Health care] is intertwined with other issues of devel
opment, said senior Christina Reichers, one of the confer
ence chairs. "If you don't have a strong healthcare system,
you won't have good development."
Speakers at the conference presented an optimistic view
that organizational and technological
innovation will allow experts to tack
le the healthcare challenges that de
veloping countries currently face.
Debrework Zewdie, the director
of the World Bank's Global
HIV/AIDS Program, cited the epi
demic in Africa as an example to dis
cuss the many issues and strategies
for international development.
During her keynote speech,
Zewdie addressed both challenges
and possible solutions. She empha
sized the"Three Ones" principle,
which calls fora greater coordina
tion of global responses to the
AIDS crisis.
Several students said they enjoyed
the critical approach that Zewdie
took in her speech.
"I was surprised how she was from

the World Bank and how critical she
was of its practices, particularly her
comments on the lack of coordina
tion between donor agencies and
governments," said Ramah McKay, a
graduate student in cultural and so
cial anthropology.
Zewdie also urged students to get
involved with international health.
"You are the generation who will
be able to translate the concept of
global solidarity into action," she
said.
Speakers following Zewdie
echoed this sentiment.
"We in the U.S. have two lives
compared to someone in Zambia,"
said Vikram Kumar, director of
Dimagi, a firm based in Boston that
provides health care consulting ser
vices.
Kumar said that a person in the
United States has double the life ex
pectancy of someone in Zambia.
"It behooves us to use one life on
important and interesting problems,"
he said.

Ophelia Dahl, executive director
of Partners in Health, a non-profit or
ganization that addresses health in
equities and social injustice, stated
that if she were to start over in her ca
reer, she would like to establish an or
ganization that helps young people
get started in the field of global
health.
"I think the really important as
pect of conferences like these is that
they reaffirm your beliefs and inspire
you to think innovatively to bring
change to things you see in the
world," said senior Archana Pa
supuleti following Dahl's panel.
Other students said they attended
the conference to network with the
participants. Freshmen Mike Wood
ward, Michael McDaniels and
Bowen Jiang — who are trying to
start a medical teleconferencing orga
nization to link healthcare profes
sionals in Ethiopia with those in the
United States — said they wanted to
learn more about the field of interna
tional health.

"We realize that a lot of people
here have actually gone to Ethiopia,"
McDaniels said. "We want to obtain
the knowledge they have."
The goal of the conference, ac
cording to Coordinator Dana
Schmidt, a senior, was to reach out to
the Stanford community and to in
form and inspire students to get in
volved with international health and
development.
In addition to the keynote speech
and panel presentations, the confer
ence also included student-led break
out sessions and a volunteer opportu
nities fair, featuring organizations
such as the Peace Corps and the
American Red Cross.
"It's been exciting," said Graduate
School of Business student Steve
Walsh, another conference organizer.
"I think the speakers are from or
ganization on the forefront of innova
tive approaches to access to health
care," he added. "There are no per
fect solutions. So we need innovative
solutions."

get started in the field of global
health.
"I think the really important as
pect of conferences like these is that
they reaffirm your beliefs and inspire
you to think innovatively to bring
change to things you see in the
world," said senior Archana Pa
supuleti following Dahl's panel.
Other students said they attended
the conference to network with the
participants. Freshmen Mike Wood
ward, Michael McDaniels and
Bowen Jiang — who are trying to
start a medical teleconferencing orga
nization to link healthcare profes
sionals in Ethiopia with those in the
United States — said they wanted to
learn more about the field of interna
tional health.

"We realize that a lot of people
here have actually gone to Ethiopia,"
McDaniels said. "We want to obtain
the knowledge they have."
The goal of the conference, ac
cording to Coordinator Dana
Schmidt, a senior, was to reach out to
the Stanford community and to in
form and inspire students to get in
volved with international health and
development.
In addition to the keynote speech
and panel presentations, the confer
ence also included student-led break
out sessions and a volunteer opportu
nities fair, featuring organizations
such as the Peace Corps and the
American Red Cross.
"It's been exciting," said Graduate
School of Business student Steve
Walsh, another conference organizer.
"I think the speakers are from or
ganization on the forefront of innova
tive approaches to access to health
care," he added. "There are no per
fect solutions. So we need innovative
solutions."
Roughly 250 Stanford students, faculty and community
members registered to attend the fourth annual Stanford
Conference on International Development on Saturday at
the Graduate School of Business. Panelists discussed world
health issues, including HIV/AIDS, and how students can
get involved.
Organized by the Stanford Association for International
Development, or SAID, and the GSB International Devel
opment Club, the conference focused on the theme of im
proving health care access in developing nations.
Conference organizers indicated that health care is a key
issue within the field of international development — a rea
son why the topic was chosen for this year's conference.
"[Health care] is intertwined with other issues of devel
opment, said senior Christina Reichers, one of the confer
ence chairs. "If you don't have a strong healthcare system,
you won't have good development."
Speakers at the conference presented an optimistic view
that organizational and technological
innovation will allow experts to tack
le the healthcare challenges that de
veloping countries currently face.
Debrework Zewdie, the director
of the World Bank's Global
HIV/AIDS Program, cited the epi
demic in Africa as an example to dis
cuss the many issues and strategies
for international development.
During her keynote speech,
Zewdie addressed both challenges
and possible solutions. She empha
sized the"Three Ones" principle,
which calls fora greater coordina
tion of global responses to the
AIDS crisis.
Several students said they enjoyed
the critical approach that Zewdie
took in her speech.
"I was surprised how she was from

the World Bank and how critical she
was of its practices, particularly her
comments on the lack of coordina
tion between donor agencies and
governments," said Ramah McKay, a
graduate student in cultural and so
cial anthropology.
Zewdie also urged students to get
involved with international health.
"You are the generation who will
be able to translate the concept of
global solidarity into action," she
said.
Speakers following Zewdie
echoed this sentiment.
"We in the U.S. have two lives
compared to someone in Zambia,"
said Vikram Kumar, director of
Dimagi, a firm based in Boston that
provides health care consulting ser
vices.
Kumar said that a person in the
United States has double the life ex
pectancy of someone in Zambia.
"It behooves us to use one life on
important and interesting problems,"
he said.

Ophelia Dahl, executive director
of Partners in Health, a non-profit or
ganization that addresses health in
equities and social injustice, stated
that if she were to start over in her ca
reer, she would like to establish an or
ganization that helps young people
get started in the field of global
health.
