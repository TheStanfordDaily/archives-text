Time to expound on reason #8012
why Stanford is better than those
Ivies:
A friend of mine who goes to
Yale (she didn't get into Stanford),
during her freshman year, lived in
a separate section of campus with
almost all of Yale's freshmen. Only
in her sophomore year did she
move into her residential college.

And even then,
she could only
"draw" together
in suites with
students from
her same year.
The result? Out
of the 6,000+ stu
dents at Yale,
she had less than
30 from which to
pick.

Nearly all of her close friends are
her year, and barriers are in place
between her and three-fourths of the
school. Thankfully, here at Stanford,
we don't have that problem.
But with the proposed changes to
our undergraduate housing system
(as reported in the Feb. 9 edition of
The Daily), 1 am concerned about
the possibility of increased separa
tion between freshmen and upper
classmen. Four-class dorms will all
but disappear in the new plan, while
most freshmen will be sequestered
in between the cement blocks of
Stern and Wilbur.
One of Stanford's strongest at
tributes is the intermingled nature
of its classes. As freshmen, many of
us end up in four-class dorms where
we meet sophomores, juniors and
seniors.
As upperclassmen, the draw vir
tually ensures that wherever we live,
students from other classes will be in
our houses and dorms. I certainly en
joyed having freshmen liven up my
dorm last year, and I'm sure they en
joyed having easy access to midnight
Jack-in-the-Box runs.
And it can be advantageous to

have friends of different years:
Want a night at the lrats? Call your
freshmen or sophomore friends. If
you want to hit the bars in San
Francisco, seniors might be a bet
ter bet.
And perhaps more importantly,
you meet people in different
stages of their academic careers.
Freshmen may get some handy ad
vice from seniors, while upper
classmen can enjoy the unmatched
joviality that freshmen bring to
any dorm.
The flexibility of Stanford's draw
system can leave some students in
undesirable and downright unlucky
situations (no one should be living in
FloMo senior year â€” are you listen
ing, draw gods?!). But with a bit of
tinkering, the system could provide
students with greater chances of
good upperclassman housing with
out having seniors occupying every
row house and only sophomores liv
ing in Lag.
For next year, my friend at Yale is
hoping to draw with a guy. They are
currently in the midst of petitioning
the university to be allowed to do so,
something we can do without any
extra paperwork (you just have to
hash and clean toilets). This is just
one of the benefits of our system's
incredible flexibility.
As Stanford's undergraduate
housing enters a new chapter in its
existence, I hope it doesn't discard
the advantages that four-class dorms
and mixed houses provide.
And a final plea: How about we
stop placing freshmen in theme
dorms unless they request it? It
could be quite alienating to be one of
a handful of freshmen in a dorm
whose focus has no particular con
nection to your life.
