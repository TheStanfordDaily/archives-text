Prolonged Internet use has detrimental effects on social
interactions and interpersonal relationships, according to a
recent study released by the Stanford Institute for the
Quantitative Study of Society, or SIQSS.
Norman Nie, professor of political science and director
of SIQSS, spearheaded the study in 2001 when he and his
colleagues first began noticing the connection between In
ternet usage and social skills.
His newest findings, released in December with Alber
to Simpser, a doctoral candidate in political science, and
Irena Stepanikova and Lu Zheng, both doctoral candidates
in sociology, Nie found even stronger evidence that Inter
net usage is directly related to social isolation.
Nie said that "time is hydraulic," meaning that time spent
on the Internet is time taken away from other activities.
Every minute spent on the computer is a minute taken away
from face-to-face relationships with family and friends.
"(The Internet] has been an extraordinary productivity
enhancer and an enormously powerful tool to stay in touch,"
Nie told the Stanford News Service. "But if you look at every
major social innovation, there are both positive conse
quences intended and negative consequences unintended."
According to Nie, not only does more time online re
duce face-to-face interactions with family, but it is also as
sociated with lower "wellness scores," which measure one's
psychological well-being.
The data came from online surveys 0f4,839 respondents
who recorded detailed logs of their daily activities, both on
and off the Internet for two days spaced a year apart.
The data reinforces the study's conclusions that social
interactions decreased with Internet use, Nie said. The
cause and effect relationship is clearer with the year space
between recorded days.
"We try to examine to what extent the introduction of

the internet has infiltrated or changed people's daily life in
the past ten years," Zheng said. "We may not be aware of its
encroachment on quality time spent with those around us."
Zheng said some of the respondents used the Internet
more than others. Zheng said that each hour spent on the
Internet reduces face-to-face time by 23.5 minutes. Overall,
the respondents averaged 55 minutes online per day. This
translates into a reduction of about 22 minutes of time
spent interacting with people face-to-face.
Of the respondents who reported frequent internet use,
their reported average time online was much higher, at
three hours a day, meaning a loss of 70 minutes of face-to
face time with friends and family. Zheng did not define
what qualifies as a "frequent Internet user."
Most students might think that three hours online a day is
normal; however, Zheng added that college students' Inter
net use is not an accurate representation of society as a whole.
"If there is any definition of frequent Internet users, all
college students may fall into that category," Zheng said.
"Since the sample in our study represents the general pop
ulation of American people, we would expect very differ
ent findings from college students, especially those who live
in dorms rather than at home."
Nie said he believes that technologies always come with
unintended consequences — one of which is the impact of
the Internet on people's sociability.
"Face-to-face interaction with close ones qualitatively
differs from interactions in the virtual world online and is
more important to one's psychological wellness," Zheng
said. "It's not only about one's own psychological well
being, but also a matter for those we care about."
Zheng stressed the importance of balancing Internet use
and social interaction.
"As for Stanford students far away from home and old
friends, the internet can help us connect to them more closely,"
Zheng said. "We should use the internet in a balanced manner
and not let it take away a kiss or a hug to our loved ones."

"As for Stanford students far away from home and old

Zheng said. "We should use the internet in a balanced manner
and not let it take away a kiss or a hug to our loved ones."
