# Law Schools hosts Chang memorial
## 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
In honor of Iris Chang — the
author, human rights activist and
journalist who committed suicide
Nov. 9 in Los Gatos — the Law
School hosted a memorial service
last Thursday in conjunction with
Stanford Chinaßains and the Stan
ford Chinese Law Association.
Best known for her work "The
Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten
Holocaust of World War," Chang
became one of the most notable au
thors of recent decades. She docu
mented the atrocities in Nanking,
during which 3(K),(KH) Chinese peo
ple were raped, tortured and killed
by Japanese soldiers.
Amy Fujiwara Shen, a doctoral
candidate at UC Berkeley, said that
Chang was known for her writing and
her passion to speak for the victims.
"It is marvelous what she ac
complished in such a short period of
time," Shen said.
Henrietta Johnson-Burroughs,
a member of the Human Relations
Commission of Palo Alto and jour
nalist, also spoke at the service. She
said she believes that Chang's life
and works have definitely impacted
the lives of many.
"Chang could see the common
humanity in everyone," said John
son-Burroughs. "She was an ac
tivist for human justice and coali
tion building."
William Jiang, the acting asso
ciate dean of faculty affairs at San
Jose State University, said that he
was most impressed that Chang
was born in the United States and
was still profoundly influenced by
the stories told by her grandpar
ents and parents.
Last year in the "Bloomsbury

Review" — a maga/ine about writ
ing and writers — it was reported
that Chang's hair started falling out
in clumps as she wrote her book,
"The Rape of Nanking."
"1 told myself that whatever
pain I experienced writing the book
was nothing compared to what the
victims had endured," Chang said
in the article. "Who am 1 to shy
away from this topic and to com
plain about pain, when hundreds of
thousands of people died the most
horrible deaths imaginable — peo
ple whose voices might be lost, for
ever, to oblivion?"
Chang spoke at Stanford last
May and recounted her experience
researching and writing about the
war crimes committed in China.
Her grandparents fled from
Nanking just as the violence began.
At the time she began her research,
the events were unacknowledged in
Japan and little-known to the rest
of the world.
" 1 invited her to come speak and
she was really enthusiastic about
coming," said organizer Jennifer
Kong, a senior. "She was a tremen
dous figure in the Asian-American
community, both as a historian and
an advocate for human rights."
Coordinators for the memorial
said they hoped the event would mo
bilize public opinion and to pressure
the Japanese to acknowledge the
crimes perpetrated at Nanking.
Then-Emperor Hirohito or
dered many of the events that led to
the massacre of Nanking and the
Japanese government has yet to
make a formal apology. Organizers
of the memorial service said it is im
perative that the Japanese govern
ment apologize before they are al
lowed to become members on the
United Nations Security Council.
