## Fade Into Bolivian In Bonds I (still) trust 
### 
Simply put: I worship at the
Church of Barry Lamar Bonds
(BLB). Should one have the
prized opportunity to visit my hum
ble abode at 10 Harrison Street in
Menlo Park, they would find a
shrine for Bonds that includes a
Bonds poster, photos from the 20()2
NLCS, fake tulips, a Bonds sou-

venir cup, a 1992
Bonds baseball
card and an official
National League
baseball. Howev
er, despite my fre
quent visits to the
church of BLB last
year, the Giants
failed to make the
playoffs - a fact
which led me to

the possible belief that Bonds is a
false idol. Nonetheless, with spring
in the air, and new fake tulips in the
shrine, the church of BLB - steroid
accusations and all - will once again
be in session.
Quite simply, the only person
who knows if Bonds juices is him
self, and he seems pretty adamant
that he hasn't been in any bathroom
stalls with Armando Rios or Benito
Santiago recently. (Sidenote: How
brilliant is Canseco? Taking a poly
graph test on pay-per-view? Abso
lutely brilliant entrepreneurship in
my book.) Despite my knack for
hard-hitting investigatory journal
ism, I've a)only communicated with
Bonds during prayer sessions,
b)never personally injected Bonds
and c)never seen Bonds enjoy any
flaxseed oil in his daily diet.
What I don't really understand is
what people expected from Bonds'
recent press conference. If Bonds
apologizes to the press (who all de
serve asterisks next to their bylines
for their coverage of the Bonds
saga), he apologizes for something
he never admitted to in the first
place. And if he maintains his posi
tion that he never knowingly took
steroids, the press will continue the
witch-hunt and call him a liar. (Side
note: If you're going to accuse
Bonds of steroid use, can I at least
accuse the person who leaked the
grand jury testimony of some sort of
crime? The last time I checked, re
leasing grand jury testimony was il
legal and punishable under federal
law). Thus, instead of answering the
unanswerable. Bonds acted as an
esteemed social critic and told the


Neil Davis
world, "We've got alcohol. That's
the No. 1 killer in America and we
legalize that to buy in the store.
You've got, you know, you've got to
bacco [as the] number two. three
killer in America, we legalize that."
Plainly, Bonds cares for you health,
and yet the press wants to malign
him? The shame!
Instead of trying to create a
chummy report with the press like
Sosa. Bonds has every right to tell
the media off and continue with
rehab for his injured knee. Quite
simply, the media's desire to cast
Bonds in a negative light stems
from his sour relationship with the
press. As Bonds' father said before

he passed away, "The biggest prob
lem with you. Bonds, is that every
great athlete that has gone on for
great records, everyone knows
their story. People have made hun
dreds of millions of dollars off their
stories with them and protected
them. Nobody knows you and they
arc pissed off."
So. dear reader, you're sure that
Bonds is juiced? You're sure that
Bonds' epic 73 MR season is a
farce? Clearly, the reality of Bonds'
superhuman strength at 40 stems
from a "chef who makes sure that
I'm getting the right amounts of
carbs, proteins and fats throughout
the day to keep me at my max per
formance level." There is no doubt
in my mind that with such culinary
balance, this guy would never need
to use performance-enhancing sub
stances.
Come April, look for the San

Francisco Giants to have the oldest
outfield in Major League history and
fora healthy Bonds to surpass Ruth
(the old. dead, presumably white
guy that Bonds desperately wants to
pass. Interestingly, Bonds has failed
to realize that Ruth might have been
black as well, and thus his desire to
pass the ambiguously-white Ruth
might be a false attempt at Stokley
Carmichaelism) and make a run at
Aaron's' record. For all the doubters
who think the adversity of the
BALCO scandal will put a dent in
Bonds' season, I have news for you,
straight from Bonds' mouth, "I've
been dealing with adversity my
whole life. I grew up with only four
black kids in my whole school." In
Barry 1 trust.
