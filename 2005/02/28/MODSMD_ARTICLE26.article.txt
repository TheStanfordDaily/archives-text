They knew the competition would he
weaker and that they were expected to do
well, but no one on the No. 5 women's
swimming and diving team expected this.
A second-place finish in the final event
of the Pacific-10 Conference meet left the
victorious Cardinal one point short of
1500, as Stanford finished with a 262-
point lead over runner-up No. 6 Arizona.
"Obviously 1 am incredibly proud of
our team's performance," head coach
Richard Quick said. "We had a wonder
ful, wonderful meet. We had a great team
effort really throughout our lineup. It was
a spectacular energy we had throughout

the meet."
The Cardinal won eight of the 21
events and took the top two spots in three
of them. Coming into the meet, Stanford
swimmers had only reached the NCAA
"A" standard time, which guarantees a
spot in the national championship, in five
events. After the Pac-10 meet, Stanford
will have 21 guaranteed spots. In addi
tion, the Cardinal tallied 24 "B" times,
which are not guaranteed berths, but do
open up the possibility of an invite to Na
tionals. Stanford recorded at least a "B"
time in each of the 18 swimming events
and had "A" times in 14 of them. At least
10, and as many as 17, Cardinal swimmers

21 events en route to a 262 point victory.
will compete at the NCAA Cham
pionships.
Stanford took the lead with a
win in the first event of the meet
and never looked hack.
"There was the excitement of
having the whole team going to
gether to get the conference cham
pionship." senior captain Lacey
Boutwell said. "Everyone was
swimming well and we were really
feeding off of each other."
"We were all swimming well
from the beginning and building
on that through the meet," fresh
man Caroline Bruce added.
Bruce, who received the
"Swimmer of the Meet" award was
the star of the weekend, bringing
three individual Pac-10 titles back
to the Farm. Including relays,
Bruce finished the meet with five
conference championships, four
new personal bests and eight
NCAA "A" times.
She easily won both the 200-
and 400-yard individual medleys
and cruised to the title in the 200-
yard breaststroke. Her prelimi
nary performance in the 200-yard
individual medley is the third
fastest time in the nation. In the
400-yard IM, her winning time
ranks fourth nationally and her
win in the 200-yard breast is the
year's fastest non-converted time.
In an exhibition swim in the 100-
yard breaststroke, she recorded
yet another personal best and
swam to an "A" time.
"I haven't had many personal
bests through the season but the
training I've been doing is better
than ever before," Bruce said.
"And having such great coaches
and a great team helped me to do
that."
She also swam the breaststroke
leg on the two winning medley
relay teams and was a member of
the freestyle relay teams that came
in second in the 400-yard and 800-
yard races. Both medleys and the
shorter freestyle relay teams fin
ished in season-best time, and the
400-yard medley team posted the
country's third-fastest time.
Bruce was one of two Stanford
swimmers to claim multiple indi
vidual titles. Boutwell won in the

50-yard and 100-yard freestyle,
each in"A" time, and swam the
anchor leg of the victorious 400-
yard medley relay.
"It was an outstanding closing
performance by a senior captain,"
Quick said of Boutwell, who will
leave Stanford with four individual
and four relay conference champi
onships.
Junior Dana Kirk wrapped up
the meet with a final win for the
Cardinal Saturday in the 200-yard
butterfly in"A" time. A member
of the two winning medley relays.
Kirk now has eight Pac-10 champi
onships in her career, two individ
ual and six for relays.
Freshman Brooke Bishop fin
ished with four "A" times and
three "B" times, highlighted by
two wins with the medley relay
teams and second place finishes in
two freestyle relays and the 50-
yard freestyle race.
Junior Kristen Caverly tallied
three"A" times, two of them sec
ond-place finishes to Bruce in the
individual medleys and a third
place in the 200-yard breaststroke.
Freshman Elizabeth Durot also
posted three"A" times, in the 200-
yard freestyle, 500-yard freestyle
and the 800-yard freestyle relay.

sophomores Lauren Costella and
Desiree Stahley, reached the"A"
standard, finishing second and
third, respectively.
