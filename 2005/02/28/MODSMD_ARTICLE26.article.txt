They knew the competition would he
weaker and that they were expected to do
well, but no one on the No. 5 women's
swimming and diving team expected this.
A second-place finish in the final event
of the Pacific-10 Conference meet left the
victorious Cardinal one point short of
1500, as Stanford finished with a 262-
point lead over runner-up No. 6 Arizona.
"Obviously 1 am incredibly proud of
our team's performance," head coach
Richard Quick said. "We had a wonder
ful, wonderful meet. We had a great team
effort really throughout our lineup. It was
a spectacular energy we had throughout

the meet."
The Cardinal won eight of the 21
events and took the top two spots in three
of them. Coming into the meet, Stanford
swimmers had only reached the NCAA
"A" standard time, which guarantees a
spot in the national championship, in five
events. After the Pac-10 meet, Stanford
will have 21 guaranteed spots. In addi
tion, the Cardinal tallied 24 "B" times,
which are not guaranteed berths, but do
open up the possibility of an invite to Na
tionals. Stanford recorded at least a "B"
time in each of the 18 swimming events
and had "A" times in 14 of them. At least
10, and as many as 17, Cardinal swimmers
