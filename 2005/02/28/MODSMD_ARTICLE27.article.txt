# Card escape Pit with win
## 
### SCOTT ALIEN MANAGING EDITOR 
EUGENE, Ore. - The eight-point deficit
Stanford faced with 12:01 to play Satur
day at Mc Arthur Court was less than half
the one it overcame one year ago in the
same building, where it rallied to pre
serve its perfect record before a stunned
home crowd. The Cardinal's comeback
this time, however, will prove exponen
tially more meaningful should Stanford's
name be called on Selection Sunday.
Junior forward Matt Haryasz's floater
in the lane with 14.1 seconds to play lifted
Stanford to a 58-56 win over the under
sized but inspired Ducks, earning the
Cardinal a split on the road and more im
portantly maintaining their one-game
lead over UCLA for third place in the Pa
cific-10 Conference.
Stanford (16-10, 10-6 Pac-10), which
can lock up third place in the conference
with a win against one of the Washington
schools this weekend or a UCLA loss,
overcame an off night from junior point
guard Chris Hernandez, who did not hit
a field goal after the first six minutes and
shot just 2-for-13 from the field.
With 39 seconds to play and the game
tied 56-56, the Cardinal turned to Duck
hunter Haryasz, who had 20 points and
20 rebounds in the teams' last meeting
and finished with 18 points and 10 re
bounds Saturday.
"Chris did a good job of drawing his
guy and my guy was a little up on me, so I
just picked up my dribble, stepped up
and just let it go," Haryasz said. "It felt
soft. I feel like if your shot is soft and it
hits the rim it has a good chance of going
in, and it did - it hit a lot of the rim."
"It was by design," head coach Trent

Johnson said. "Matt put it on the deck
and made a nice basketball play."
Nice plays were hard to come by early
in the second half for Stanford, as the
Ducks built a 44-38 lead behind the rest
ed legs of freshmen Malik Hairston,
Bryce Taylor, Maarty Leunen and a deep
bench.
While two fourth-year team man
agers were the only Ducks honored on
Senior Day, Stanford senior forward
Nick Robinson showed the Oregon
faithful what a veteran player can do.
Robinson sank three three-pointers,
including two in the second half as part of
a 10-2 Stanford run to knot the score at
48-48 with 8:52 to play.
Oregon took a 56-54 lead on a pair of
Aaron Brooks free throws five minutes
later, setting the stage for the game's de
cisive final possessions.
Junior guard Jason Haas came
through with two of the biggest plays of
the day - and of the season - for Stanford.
Staring into a sea of yellow-clad, scream
ing Ducks fans, Haas coolly sank two free
throws to tie the game at 56 with 1:14 to
play. On the ensuing possession, he drew
a charge on Brooks to set up Haryasz's
game-winner.
Haas' poise on the line came as no sur
prise to Haryasz.
"He stepped up big." Haryasz said.
"The thing is that wasn't too much pres
sure for him because before every game
we have a free throw contest at practice
and the razzing our own guys give each
other is pretty intense."
The razzing Stanford took from Ore
gon's student section at "The Pit" was
even worse, as fans had plenty to cheer
about for most of the second half.
"Nothing was going right," Haas said.

"Nobody really had their 'A'-game
tonight individually, but it definitely
shows our character, staying with it and
getting stops when we need to down
the stretch."
Brooks finished with 14 points and
five rebounds to lead the Ducks but he
also accounted for six of Oregon's 18
turnovers. Hairston scored 12 points
and grabbed 12 rebounds in the defeat,
helping Oregon to a 41-26 advantage
on the boards despite starting only one
player taller than 6-foot-6.
"1 think they were the aggressor for
most of the game," Robinson said.
"They have more guys coming off the
bench obviously than we do, but they
were really aggressive going to the
glass and did a good job of boxing us
out.
"We both made mistakes and we
both made great plays," Hernandez
said. "Both teams gutted it out and it
just came down to a matter of making a
couple of plays and thankfully Matt
made some big rebounds at the end and
made the last shot."
For the first seven minutes Satur
day, the Cardinal appeared poised to
run the Ducks out of the building as
they did in an 88-69 victory at Maples
on Jan. 29. Stanford took a 14-2 lead on
a Haryasz jumper with 12:35 to play in
the first half.
But with senior center Rob Little on
the bench in foul trouble, Oregon went
on a 13-2 run and pulled to within one
after Brandon Lincoln's three-pointer
swished home less than five minutes
later. Stanford took a 29-27 lead into
halftime after a shot-clock violation

bigger than the game winning jumper in the lane with 14 seconds left.
