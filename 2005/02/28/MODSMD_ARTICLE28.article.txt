# Maples is magic for senior women

### ANTARDEB GUHARAY STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's basket
hall team's seniors might he the
proudest women on campus.
With Saturday's 84-41 mas
sacre of Oregon State (6-22, 1-17
Pacific-10 Conference), the Cardi
nal (26-2,17-1) wrapped up an un
defeated season at home. On their
last night playing at home, the
Stanford seniors walked out of
Maples never having had the feel
ing of losing a Pac-10 game played
on the Farm.
The Cardinal found little resis
tance on their path to victory in
their last regular season game of
the season. But it wouldn't be fair
to place all the blame on the
Beavers for the lopsided result on
Sunday. After all, the Cardinal
have beaten their conference op
ponents by an average of 24.9
points per game.
The game went the Cardinal's
way from the opening tip, as a
jumper from Kelley Suminski, a
layup from Brooke Smith and a
three-pointer from Sebnem Kimy

acioglu put the Cardinal up 7-0.
Before five minutes had passed in
the game, Stanford was up 15-1
and by halftime the game was all
but wrapped up with the Cardinal
ahead 44-14.
Mandy Close and Shannon
Howell scored eight points apiece
to lead the way for the Beavers,
who lost their seventh straight
game overall and 10th game in a
row to the Cardinal. Oregon State
has never won in nineteen meet
ings at Maples Pavilion.
" It was lambs going into slaugh
ter," Oregon State coach Judy
Spoelstra said. "Your worst fear is
you come into a game like this and
your kids aren't ready to play and
are standing there watching. You
have to do one of two things, slow
them down or counter them offen
sively. They're really efficient."
When all was said and done, it
was a freshman who filled up the
box score for Stanford. Candice
Wiggins continued to solidify her
status as the Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year and perhaps Player of the

Freshman Candice Wiggins stole the show with 20 points in the 84-41 victory over
Oregon State on Senior Day at Maple Pavilion.
Year award with 20 points, three re
bounds and two assists.
"I just think it was the seniors'
day," Wiggins said. "I look up to them
so much."
And the seniors were anything hut
quiet on their big night. Suminski
poured in 12 points to go along with
four rebounds and two assists, Kimy
acioglu had 11 points and three
blocks, forward Azella Perryman had
eight points and four rebounds and
guard Susan King Borchardt dished
out a game high six assists. Senior for
ward T'Nae Thiel sat out with a par
tial fracture of her left foot, but is ex
pected back by the start of the NCAA
tournament in three weeks.
The consistent production from
every Cardinal player has made this
year's team truly special for Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"It's a wow season," VanDerveer
said. "We just want to keep putting
those exclamation points on that. We

want nine exclamation points on that
wow."
The nine exclamation points refer
to three victories for the Pac-10 title
and six victories for the NCAA cham
pionship.
With the Pac-10 regular season
title already claimed, the Cardinal will
head into the conference tournament
as the top seed. The tournament will
begin Friday night at San Jose's lII'
Pavilion.
After putting their final exclama
tion point on the regular season, the
Stanford seniors are looking to close
out their last games in a Stanford uni
form with a bang.
"We're really excited about what's
ahead," Suminski said. "We'll work
hard to prepare for the Pac-10 tour
nament, improve from here and be
ready for the NCAA tournament."
If the Cardinal can continue to get
the type of all-around production
they've enjoyed all season, it'll be
quite a task for any team to stop the
Cardinal's 17-game winning streak.
And with Saturday's game against
Oregon State the Cardinal sent out a
clear message to the rest of the Pac-10
and NCAA: watch out.

Sunday. After all, the Cardinal
have beaten their conference op
ponents by an average of 24.9
points per game.
The game went the Cardinal's
way from the opening tip, as a
jumper from Kelley Suminski, a
layup from Brooke Smith and a
three-pointer from Sebnem Kimy

acioglu put the Cardinal up 7-0.
Before five minutes had passed in
the game, Stanford was up 15-1
and by halftime the game was all
but wrapped up with the Cardinal
ahead 44-14.
Mandy Close and Shannon
Howell scored eight points apiece
to lead the way for the Beavers,
who lost their seventh straight
game overall and 10th game in a
row to the Cardinal. Oregon State
has never won in nineteen meet
ings at Maples Pavilion.
" It was lambs going into slaugh
ter," Oregon State coach Judy
Spoelstra said. "Your worst fear is
you come into a game like this and
your kids aren't ready to play and
are standing there watching. You
have to do one of two things, slow
them down or counter them offen
sively. They're really efficient."
When all was said and done, it
was a freshman who filled up the
box score for Stanford. Candice
Wiggins continued to solidify her
status as the Pac-10 Freshman of
the Year and perhaps Player of the


LINDSAY COLEAAAN/The Stanford Daily
Freshman Candice Wiggins stole the show with 20 points in the 84-41 victory over
Oregon State on Senior Day at Maple Pavilion.
Year award with 20 points, three re
bounds and two assists.
"I just think it was the seniors'
day," Wiggins said. "I look up to them
so much."
And the seniors were anything hut
quiet on their big night. Suminski
poured in 12 points to go along with
four rebounds and two assists, Kimy
acioglu had 11 points and three
blocks, forward Azella Perryman had
eight points and four rebounds and
guard Susan King Borchardt dished
out a game high six assists. Senior for
ward T'Nae Thiel sat out with a par
tial fracture of her left foot, but is ex
pected back by the start of the NCAA
tournament in three weeks.
The consistent production from
every Cardinal player has made this
year's team truly special for Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"It's a wow season," VanDerveer
said. "We just want to keep putting
those exclamation points on that. We

want nine exclamation points on that
wow."
The nine exclamation points refer
to three victories for the Pac-10 title
and six victories for the NCAA cham
pionship.
With the Pac-10 regular season
title already claimed, the Cardinal will
head into the conference tournament
as the top seed. The tournament will
begin Friday night at San Jose's lII'
Pavilion.
After putting their final exclama
tion point on the regular season, the
Stanford seniors are looking to close
out their last games in a Stanford uni
form with a bang.
"We're really excited about what's
ahead," Suminski said. "We'll work
hard to prepare for the Pac-10 tour
nament, improve from here and be
ready for the NCAA tournament."
If the Cardinal can continue to get
the type of all-around production
they've enjoyed all season, it'll be
quite a task for any team to stop the
Cardinal's 17-game winning streak.
And with Saturday's game against
Oregon State the Cardinal sent out a
clear message to the rest of the Pac-10
and NCAA: watch out.
The Stanford women's basket
hall team's seniors might he the
proudest women on campus.
With Saturday's 84-41 mas
sacre of Oregon State (6-22, 1-17
Pacific-10 Conference), the Cardi
nal (26-2,17-1) wrapped up an un
defeated season at home. On their
last night playing at home, the
Stanford seniors walked out of
Maples never having had the feel
ing of losing a Pac-10 game played
on the Farm.
The Cardinal found little resis
tance on their path to victory in
their last regular season game of
the season. But it wouldn't be fair
to place all the blame on the
Beavers for the lopsided result on
Sunday. After all, the Cardinal
have beaten their conference op
ponents by an average of 24.9
points per game.
The game went the Cardinal's
