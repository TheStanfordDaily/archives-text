# Stanford takes two of three from Trojans
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Stanford first baseman John Mayberry, Jr. is ex
actly who No. 22 Southern California (5-2) didn't
want at the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning
during Saturday's game. The bases were loaded with
one out when the 6-foot-5,230-pound cleanup hitter
stepped to the plate with the opportunity to end the
game on anything hit to the outfield.
As it turns out, the Trojans should have been
worried about Mayberry's speed, not his power. He
hit a ground ball to shortstop Hector Estrella. who
was playing at double-play depth. Estrella got the

force at second, hut Mayberry heat out the throw to
first, and Jim Rapoport came home with the winning
run to clinch the series for the No. 13 Cardinal (9-6)
after the team had notched a 6-0 victory on Friday
behind a complete-game shutout by junior Mark
Romanczuk. They would go on to lose Sunday's
game, 8-2.
Stanford has struggled when the score is close,
and the win was their first in one-run games after
three losses in those situations, including two at the
hands of Texas two weekends ago.
"I think you gain more confidence the more times
you play in one-run games, even if you lose," May
berry said. "It's all about gaining more experience."

Romanczuk has had plenty of experience as the
Friday night starter, but he took a new approach,
tossing a complete-game shutout on Friday night,
the first by a Stanford pitcher since Jeremy Guthrie
blanked UCLA in 2(X)2.
"I'm a pretty analytical guy," Romanczuk, an
economics major, said after Friday's game. "I spent
this week breaking down my pitch chart [from the
Texas series], trying to figure out what I needed to
work on. But as I was eating lunch today, I just real
ized that I needed to go after hitters and leave every
single thing I have out there on the field. My attitude
was, if they hit it, they hit it, but I'm going to bring ev-
erything I have."
He brought it, and they couldn't hit
it.
Romanczuk struck out 12 and al
lowed only four hits and two walks.
Trojan hitters could not catch up to
Romanczuk's fastball, and he threw
his off-speed pitches with confidence,
getting almost all of his strikeouts on
curveballs and changeups.
Romanczuk got all the run support
he needed on a two-run sacrifice fly by
Jed Lowrie in the first inning. Center
fielder Daniel Perales caught the ball
at the warning track in center field, but
his throw sailed over the second base
man's head. Freshman Michael Tay
lor scored from third and junior Chris
Mianker raced around to score from
second. Minaker went four-for-four in
the game.
Junior Chris Lewis hit a two-run
single in the fourth, and Stanford
scored two more in the seventh on an
RBI double by Minaker and another
sacrifice tlv by Lowrie.
On Saturday, the pitching perfor
mance was more of a group effort. Ju
nior Jeff Gilmore had his usual solid
performance, allowing just one run in
five innings. Freshman Erik Davis
came on in the sixth and gave up one
run.and sophomore Blake Holler
pitched the last three innings, holding
the Trojans to one more run and was
credited with the win on Mayberry's
RBI grounder.
Stanford scored three runs in the
fifth on a two-run double by Minaker
and an RBI single by Lowrie off of
USC ace lan Kennedy.
Rapoport walked to lead off the
ninth and beat the throw to second 011
Taylor's sacrifice bunt. Lowrie walked

to bring up Mayberry.
There would be no chance for
heroics in the finale as USC took an
early lead and avoided a sweep with an
8-2 win. On an overcast, drizzly Sun
day, the Cardinal's sloppy play mir
rored the weather. Stanford pitchers
walked seven and hit three batters.
"You can't give a quality team
three free baserunners," head coach
Mark Marquess said. "It just makes it
too easy for them. We got hurt today
on that, and we got hurt on that in
Texas, too."

The Trojans took a two-run lead
off of freshman starting pitcher Nolan
Gallagher, who struggled with his con
trol, walking three and allowing four
hits in 2 1/3 innings of work before
being replaced by sophomore Matt
Leva.
The wheels came off in the fourth
011 a series of odd plays. The Trojans
scored four runs but had only one hit
to the outfield, an RBI double by
catcher Jeff Clement. Leva walked
three (one intentionally), all of whom
came around to score.

With the bases loaded, Darin Viera
hit a sinking line drive that bounced
off Lowrie's glove on a short hop for
an RBI single. The next batter, Cyle
Hankerd, laid down a suicide squeeze
bunt that was fielded by Leva, but no
one was covering first. The Trojans
scored their last run on a sacrifice fly.
USC added the two unearned
runs in the seventh on a Taylor error
to take an 8-0 lead, and sophomore
Ryan Seawell hit a two-run single in
the eighth that accounted for Stan
ford's lone runs.

011 a series of odd plays. The Trojans
scored four runs but had only one hit
to the outfield, an RBI double by
catcher Jeff Clement. Leva walked
three (one intentionally), all of whom
came around to score.

With the bases loaded, Darin Viera
hit a sinking line drive that bounced
off Lowrie's glove on a short hop for
an RBI single. The next batter, Cyle
Hankerd, laid down a suicide squeeze
bunt that was fielded by Leva, but no
one was covering first. The Trojans
scored their last run on a sacrifice fly.
USC added the two unearned
runs in the seventh on a Taylor error
to take an 8-0 lead, and sophomore
Ryan Seawell hit a two-run single in
the eighth that accounted for Stan
ford's lone runs.

Junior shortstop Chris Minaker and the Cardinal bounced back with two wins after being swept last weekend at
Texas.
Stanford first baseman John Mayberry, Jr. is ex
actly who No. 22 Southern California (5-2) didn't
want at the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning
during Saturday's game. The bases were loaded with
one out when the 6-foot-5,230-pound cleanup hitter
stepped to the plate with the opportunity to end the
game on anything hit to the outfield.
As it turns out, the Trojans should have been
worried about Mayberry's speed, not his power. He
hit a ground ball to shortstop Hector Estrella. who
was playing at double-play depth. Estrella got the

force at second, hut Mayberry heat out the throw to
first, and Jim Rapoport came home with the winning
run to clinch the series for the No. 13 Cardinal (9-6)
after the team had notched a 6-0 victory on Friday
behind a complete-game shutout by junior Mark
Romanczuk. They would go on to lose Sunday's
game, 8-2.
Stanford has struggled when the score is close,
and the win was their first in one-run games after
three losses in those situations, including two at the
hands of Texas two weekends ago.
"I think you gain more confidence the more times
you play in one-run games, even if you lose," May
berry said. "It's all about gaining more experience."

Romanczuk has had plenty of experience as the
Friday night starter, but he took a new approach,
tossing a complete-game shutout on Friday night,
the first by a Stanford pitcher since Jeremy Guthrie
blanked UCLA in 2(X)2.
"I'm a pretty analytical guy," Romanczuk, an
economics major, said after Friday's game. "I spent
this week breaking down my pitch chart [from the
Texas series], trying to figure out what I needed to
work on. But as I was eating lunch today, I just real
ized that I needed to go after hitters and leave every
single thing I have out there on the field. My attitude
was, if they hit it, they hit it, but I'm going to bring ev-
erything I have."
He brought it, and they couldn't hit
it.
Romanczuk struck out 12 and al
lowed only four hits and two walks.
Trojan hitters could not catch up to
Romanczuk's fastball, and he threw
his off-speed pitches with confidence,
getting almost all of his strikeouts on
curveballs and changeups.
Romanczuk got all the run support
he needed on a two-run sacrifice fly by
Jed Lowrie in the first inning. Center
fielder Daniel Perales caught the ball
at the warning track in center field, but
his throw sailed over the second base
man's head. Freshman Michael Tay
lor scored from third and junior Chris
Mianker raced around to score from
second. Minaker went four-for-four in
the game.
Junior Chris Lewis hit a two-run
single in the fourth, and Stanford
scored two more in the seventh on an
RBI double by Minaker and another
sacrifice tlv by Lowrie.
On Saturday, the pitching perfor
mance was more of a group effort. Ju
nior Jeff Gilmore had his usual solid
performance, allowing just one run in
five innings. Freshman Erik Davis
came on in the sixth and gave up one
run.and sophomore Blake Holler
pitched the last three innings, holding
the Trojans to one more run and was
credited with the win on Mayberry's
RBI grounder.
Stanford scored three runs in the
fifth on a two-run double by Minaker
and an RBI single by Lowrie off of
USC ace lan Kennedy.
Rapoport walked to lead off the
ninth and beat the throw to second 011
Taylor's sacrifice bunt. Lowrie walked

to bring up Mayberry.
There would be no chance for
heroics in the finale as USC took an
early lead and avoided a sweep with an
8-2 win. On an overcast, drizzly Sun
day, the Cardinal's sloppy play mir
rored the weather. Stanford pitchers
walked seven and hit three batters.
"You can't give a quality team
three free baserunners," head coach
Mark Marquess said. "It just makes it
too easy for them. We got hurt today
on that, and we got hurt on that in
Texas, too."

The Trojans took a two-run lead
off of freshman starting pitcher Nolan
Gallagher, who struggled with his con
trol, walking three and allowing four
hits in 2 1/3 innings of work before
being replaced by sophomore Matt
Leva.
