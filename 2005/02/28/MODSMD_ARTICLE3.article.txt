# Parents attend classes, tour campus
## SLAC stages protest prior to parent event 
### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
Members of the Stanford Labor Ac
tion Coalition, or SLAC, stormed the
Parents' Weekend question-and-answer
session with University President John
Hennessy on Friday in one of several
events organized by SLAC during the
weekend. Group members said they
wanted to express their frustration over
Stanford's refusal to make substantial
labor policy changes on campus.
Three SLAC members walked on
stage and took hold of the micro
phone minutes before Hennessy was
introduced in front of many attend
ing parents.
SLAC member Alejandra Lopez, a
freshman, delivered a brief statement
about what they deem as ongoing labor
problems on campus and Hennessy's
continued delays and inaction. About 10
other SLAC members passed out fliers
with similar messages to parents in the
audience at the same time.
No attempt was made to escort the
students off the stage or contain the fly

ers and the commotion ended when
Lopez finished her comments.
In addition to this presentation,
SLAC hung three banners across cam
pus, including one that read "Wel
come to Stanford: An Anti-Labor In
stitution" at the entrance of Palm
Drive. It also hosted two teach-ins on
the history of the Code of Conduct
Campaign and what it considers to be
major labor issues on campus.
SLAC members explained that they
resorted to such confrontation after
Hennessy repeatedly ignored their re
quests to meet, as well as their policy rec
ommendations that would improve
labor standards on campus.
"Our weekend of actions is a result
of Hennessy's continued lack of re
gard for our concerns and the con
cerns of the workers that make up the
Stanford community," junior Joseles
De La Cruz of SLAC said. "Hennessy
needs to rethink his priorities, and
make a serious commitment to ad
dressing our concerns and implement
ing actual policy changes instead of
delaying and ignoring them."
