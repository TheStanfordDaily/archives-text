# Cardinal sweep 49ers at home
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It wasn't just that the men's vol
leyball team scored one of their
biggest upsets of the season this Sat
urday - they did it with a shutout.
The 3-0 win for No. 9 Stanford
(7-9, 6-7 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) over No. 5 Long Beach
State (9-7,7-6 MPSF) has the Cardi
nal riding a season-high three-game
winning streak.
To have shut out the 49ers in the
process is no small feat. Long Beach
has been ranked in the top five in
the nation for seven straight weeks.
Also, the 49ers are anchored by
one of the NCAA's best setters, ju
nior Tyler Hildebrand. Hildebrand
is No. 1 in the nation in total assists
(793) and assists per game (14.46)
this season.
In Saturday's match, almost all
of Hildebrand's 41 assists went to
outside hitter Robert Tarr. A 6-
foot-6 junior, Tarr leads Long
Beach with an average of 4.74 kills
per game. In the 49ers' last four
matches, Tarr averaged 7.38 kills
per game.
"The guys were anticipating this
game," Stanford head coach Don
Shaw said. "I think they wanted it
pretty badly. They had to stay fo
cused on that Thursday night
match, but really, the one that
they've been building for all week
long was this one."
Despite the fact that the Cardi
nal had only once beaten a team
ranked higher than them this sea
son, junior Chris Ahlfeldt said that
they had a high level of confidence
going into the match.
"We definitely knew we could
beat this team," Ahlfeldt said. "This
was the first time we've played them

at full strength. Every time we've
played them, we've had someone
out. Last time, one of our starters
didn't even play, so we knew we
could play much better than last
time. We were definitely expecting
a win."
That showed on the court, as the
Cardinal jumped out to a 6-2 lead
that forced an early Long Beach
timeout. Never allowing the 49ers
to close on them, the Cardinal won
the first game 30-15, marking their
biggest win so far this season.
"I was happy with the way the
guys came out and played very
strongly from the beginning," Shaw
said. "I think we played very, very
well. I never expect a big win. My
hope is always that we're going to
play as well as we're capable of play
ing."
Stanford hit .609 in that first
game, holding Long Beach to a
mere .179.
The second game had a much
different feel than the first. Stanford
fell behind before tying the score at
18-18 and 19-19, but Long Beach re
fused to give in, prompting Shaw to
call a timeout at 21-24.
"[Long Beach] came out with a
different lineup that we weren't re
ally anticipating at all," Shaw said.
"I don't really know whether guys
were ill or what - they were here -
but for whatever reasons, they start
ed a couple of guys that we really
weren't anticipating. John Kosty,
my associate head coach, did a great
job of adjusting the game plan. He's
really in charge of the defense as far
as the scouting report and the game
plan defensively."
The Cardinal finally managed to
pass the 49ers after a tie at 27-27.
Stanford went on to score three con
secutive points, winning the second
game 30-27.
Afterward. Shaw talked about the
importance of winning the second
game.
"That was huge for the match,"
Shaw said. "Going into the third game
one game apiece would have been a
whole different match than us being
ahead two games. That was huge for us
to be able to sneak that second game
out."
In game three Stanford gained a 15-
13 advantage and stayed a nose ahead
of the 49ers for the majority of the
game.
"With those different guys in their
lineup, [Long Beach] didn't have very
good chemistry going, and they made a
lot of errors right off the bat, so that
helped us," Shaw said.
But the Cardinal later trailed 27-29.
The packed crowd in Burnham
Pavilion kept the energy level high,
clapping furiously along with the Car
dinal bench. With junior Ben Redely
serving, Stanford scored four consecu
tive points to gain the victory 31 -29 and
secure the shutout.
"Ben's serving helped out a lot at
the end of the game; it always does."
Ahlfeldt said. "He definitely deserves
some credit for that one. We finally
were able to shut down Tarr. He got
two hitting errors in the last two points,
which says a lot about our game plan."
Reddy ended the match having
recorded three service aces. He and se
nior Craig Buell led the team in kills,
with 13 apiece, while Ahlfeldt con
tributed 12. Ahlfeldt also led the team
with a .667 hitting percentage.
Tarr carried Long Beach in Satur
day's match, notching 36 kills with a
.500 percentage. Only two of his team
mates posted positive hitting percent
ages.
"We knew the ball was going to go
to Tarr a lot, and I thought we did an
okay job of containing him, but he
played really, really well," Shaw said.
"But we held everyone else down.
That was pretty much the key. It's not
a one-man game; it's a team game, and
our team proved that."

nal's last home competition until April

played them, we've had someone
out. Last time, one of our starters
didn't even play, so we knew we
could play much better than last
time. We were definitely expecting
a win."
That showed on the court, as the
Cardinal jumped out to a 6-2 lead
that forced an early Long Beach
timeout. Never allowing the 49ers
to close on them, the Cardinal won
the first game 30-15, marking their
biggest win so far this season.
"I was happy with the way the
guys came out and played very
strongly from the beginning," Shaw
said. "I think we played very, very
well. I never expect a big win. My
hope is always that we're going to
play as well as we're capable of play
ing."
Stanford hit .609 in that first
game, holding Long Beach to a
mere .179.
The second game had a much
different feel than the first. Stanford
fell behind before tying the score at
18-18 and 19-19, but Long Beach re
fused to give in, prompting Shaw to
call a timeout at 21-24.
"[Long Beach] came out with a
different lineup that we weren't re
ally anticipating at all," Shaw said.
"I don't really know whether guys
were ill or what - they were here -
but for whatever reasons, they start
ed a couple of guys that we really
weren't anticipating. John Kosty,
my associate head coach, did a great
job of adjusting the game plan. He's
really in charge of the defense as far
as the scouting report and the game
plan defensively."
The Cardinal finally managed to
pass the 49ers after a tie at 27-27.
Stanford went on to score three con
secutive points, winning the second
game 30-27.
Afterward. Shaw talked about the
importance of winning the second
game.
"That was huge for the match,"
Shaw said. "Going into the third game
one game apiece would have been a
whole different match than us being
ahead two games. That was huge for us
to be able to sneak that second game
out."
In game three Stanford gained a 15-
13 advantage and stayed a nose ahead
of the 49ers for the majority of the
game.
"With those different guys in their
lineup, [Long Beach] didn't have very
good chemistry going, and they made a
lot of errors right off the bat, so that
helped us," Shaw said.
But the Cardinal later trailed 27-29.
The packed crowd in Burnham
Pavilion kept the energy level high,
clapping furiously along with the Car
dinal bench. With junior Ben Redely
serving, Stanford scored four consecu
tive points to gain the victory 31 -29 and
secure the shutout.
"Ben's serving helped out a lot at
the end of the game; it always does."
Ahlfeldt said. "He definitely deserves
some credit for that one. We finally
were able to shut down Tarr. He got
two hitting errors in the last two points,
which says a lot about our game plan."
Reddy ended the match having
recorded three service aces. He and se
nior Craig Buell led the team in kills,
with 13 apiece, while Ahlfeldt con
tributed 12. Ahlfeldt also led the team
with a .667 hitting percentage.
Tarr carried Long Beach in Satur
day's match, notching 36 kills with a
.500 percentage. Only two of his team
mates posted positive hitting percent
ages.
"We knew the ball was going to go
to Tarr a lot, and I thought we did an
okay job of containing him, but he
played really, really well," Shaw said.
"But we held everyone else down.
That was pretty much the key. It's not
a one-man game; it's a team game, and
our team proved that."
Saturday's match was the Cardi
nal's last home competition until April
and their last conference match in
Burnham Pavilion this season.
It wasn't just that the men's vol
leyball team scored one of their
biggest upsets of the season this Sat
urday - they did it with a shutout.
The 3-0 win for No. 9 Stanford
(7-9, 6-7 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) over No. 5 Long Beach
State (9-7,7-6 MPSF) has the Cardi
nal riding a season-high three-game
winning streak.
To have shut out the 49ers in the
process is no small feat. Long Beach
has been ranked in the top five in
the nation for seven straight weeks.
Also, the 49ers are anchored by
one of the NCAA's best setters, ju
nior Tyler Hildebrand. Hildebrand
is No. 1 in the nation in total assists
(793) and assists per game (14.46)
this season.
In Saturday's match, almost all
of Hildebrand's 41 assists went to
outside hitter Robert Tarr. A 6-
foot-6 junior, Tarr leads Long
Beach with an average of 4.74 kills
per game. In the 49ers' last four
matches, Tarr averaged 7.38 kills
per game.
"The guys were anticipating this
game," Stanford head coach Don
Shaw said. "I think they wanted it
pretty badly. They had to stay fo
cused on that Thursday night
match, but really, the one that
they've been building for all week
long was this one."
Despite the fact that the Cardi
nal had only once beaten a team
ranked higher than them this sea
son, junior Chris Ahlfeldt said that
they had a high level of confidence
going into the match.
"We definitely knew we could
beat this team," Ahlfeldt said. "This
