### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It wasn't just that the men's vol
leyball team scored one of their
biggest upsets of the season this Sat
urday - they did it with a shutout.
The 3-0 win for No. 9 Stanford
(7-9, 6-7 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) over No. 5 Long Beach
State (9-7,7-6 MPSF) has the Cardi
nal riding a season-high three-game
winning streak.
To have shut out the 49ers in the
process is no small feat. Long Beach
has been ranked in the top five in
the nation for seven straight weeks.
Also, the 49ers are anchored by
one of the NCAA's best setters, ju
nior Tyler Hildebrand. Hildebrand
is No. 1 in the nation in total assists
(793) and assists per game (14.46)
this season.
In Saturday's match, almost all
of Hildebrand's 41 assists went to
outside hitter Robert Tarr. A 6-
foot-6 junior, Tarr leads Long
Beach with an average of 4.74 kills
per game. In the 49ers' last four
matches, Tarr averaged 7.38 kills
per game.
"The guys were anticipating this
game," Stanford head coach Don
Shaw said. "I think they wanted it
pretty badly. They had to stay fo
cused on that Thursday night
match, but really, the one that
they've been building for all week
long was this one."
Despite the fact that the Cardi
nal had only once beaten a team
ranked higher than them this sea
son, junior Chris Ahlfeldt said that
they had a high level of confidence
going into the match.
"We definitely knew we could
beat this team," Ahlfeldt said. "This
was the first time we've played them

at full strength. Every time we've
played them, we've had someone
out. Last time, one of our starters
didn't even play, so we knew we
could play much better than last
time. We were definitely expecting
a win."
That showed on the court, as the
Cardinal jumped out to a 6-2 lead
that forced an early Long Beach
timeout. Never allowing the 49ers
to close on them, the Cardinal won
the first game 30-15, marking their
biggest win so far this season.
"I was happy with the way the
guys came out and played very
strongly from the beginning," Shaw
said. "I think we played very, very
well. I never expect a big win. My
hope is always that we're going to
play as well as we're capable of play
ing."
Stanford hit .609 in that first
game, holding Long Beach to a
mere .179.
The second game had a much
different feel than the first. Stanford
fell behind before tying the score at
18-18 and 19-19, but Long Beach re
fused to give in, prompting Shaw to
call a timeout at 21-24.
"[Long Beach] came out with a
different lineup that we weren't re
ally anticipating at all," Shaw said.
"I don't really know whether guys
were ill or what - they were here -
but for whatever reasons, they start
ed a couple of guys that we really
weren't anticipating. John Kosty,
my associate head coach, did a great
job of adjusting the game plan. He's
really in charge of the defense as far
as the scouting report and the game
plan defensively."
The Cardinal finally managed to
pass the 49ers after a tie at 27-27.
