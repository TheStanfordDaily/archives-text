# Card win five at Invite
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
An hi >ur and 20 minutes after the final game of the Stanfc >rd
Invitational was slated to start, a light rain began to fall. It was
well past their scheduled 1 p.m. start hut No. 4 Stanford (16-1)
and Sacramento State (9-6) still weren't on the field. Finally, at
around 2:25 p.m.. the Cardinal took the emerged from the
dugouts at Smith Family Stadium to play ball.
But Sunday's game wasn't the only one that didn't start on
time. Friday's second game, pitting Stanford against Texas
Tech, didn't start until 8:55 p.m. - almost a full two hours
after it was supposed to start. It's no wonder then that it was
the Cardinal's most difficult game of the weekend.
Despite their 8-4 win over a new Texas program led by a
first-year coach, the game was taxing for the Cardinal.
"We had a rain delay; we were out here for nine hours
total." junior centerfielder Catalina Morris said. "I know we
were out here until like 12 o'clock, so it was really testing our
selves to stay tough in the cold."
Two days later, and even though they may be used to the
game delays, the team didn't want a repeat. While Texas
Tech and UC-Davis took their time in the early game, tying
at three through six innings, Stanford looked ready to wrap
up the invitational sweep and get out of the cold in the first in
ning of their contest.
"We wanted to come out here, get a win and get the game
in before it started raining," junior pitcher Laura Severson
said.
At first, the late start appeared to have had an effect on
Stanford. The first Hornet Severson faced. Lindy Winkler,
got on with a blooper to left. But the righthander got back on
track quickly, inducing the next Sacramento State batter to
hit into a double play.
The light drizzling didn't faze the Cardinal either as they
batted around the order in the first inning. Junior shortstop
Lauren Lappin's sacrifice fly to bring in Morris got things
going. With the bases loaded, the Hornet's Jennifer Fryou
walked in two runs. Senior Elizabeth Bendig's two-run single
to center capped off the Stanford rally.
With plenty of run support behind her, Severson was mas
terful. recording four 1-2-3 innings.
When I pitch, especially. I'm happy when they hit the
ball on the ground because I know we're going to make a play
or when I get a pop-up because somebody is going to catch
it," Severson said.
Stanford scored again in the second but the bats went
quiet in both dugouts until the fourth. With women on sec
ond and third, a single by Kayla Williams finally got Sacra
mento State on the board.
Severson returned to her usual dominating self for one
more inning before sophomore Danika Dukes recorded a
save in the 6-1 win.
Sunday's display of Stanford's ability to put together runs
and ability to prevent them was seen throughout the week
end at Smith Family Stadium. Friday's 8-0 win against Davis
allowed a couple of the Cardinal to pad their averages. Se
nior Meghan Sickler knocked in three runs with one hit and

Lappin brought in one. while scoring three times. Freshman
I .auren Nydam continued to demonstrate her importance to
Stanford's pitching staff this season as she went five scoreless
innings to notch her fourth win.
On Saturday, Auburn was the victim of Stanford's sec
ond blowout victory. Morris hit her fifth home run of the
season with a runner on board to give Stanford the early
lead in the second. Nelson followed with a three-run dinger
to center, her first of the season. Severson scattered four
hits over four innings in shutting out the only team in the
tournament that had a realistic chance to compete with the
Cardinal.
"I think we played our best against them, so the score
wasn't reflective of how good they were." Morris said. "I
think we just got ourselves up and did well."
"It was a closer game than 9-0," Severson added. "They
had good hitters that battled, they had good pitching, we just
have great hitters, and we won the battle."
It was Alabama-Birmingham who gave Stanford its
biggest challenge, but McCullough and Nydam combined
for six innings in a 5-4 win on Saturday. Freshman third base
man Michelle Smith's bat also stayed hot throughout the
weekend and her double against UAB scored two.
MeC'ullough started and allowed just two runs in four in
nings but UAB battled back to tie the game 4-4 in the top of
the sixth. With pinch runner Heather Shook on base, Morris
stepped up and delivered the game-winning run with a dou
ble.
"I was just trying to come up with a hit." Morris said. "I
knew going into the seventh inning I didn't really want to be
tied. It was my fourth at-bat of the day so I felt I'd seen the
pitcher and I felt like I was on her."

up the invitational sweep and get out of the cold in the first in
ning of their contest.
"We wanted to come out here, get a win and get the game
in before it started raining," junior pitcher Laura Severson
said.
At first, the late start appeared to have had an effect on
Stanford. The first Hornet Severson faced. Lindy Winkler,
got on with a blooper to left. But the righthander got back on
track quickly, inducing the next Sacramento State batter to
hit into a double play.
The light drizzling didn't faze the Cardinal either as they
batted around the order in the first inning. Junior shortstop
Lauren Lappin's sacrifice fly to bring in Morris got things
going. With the bases loaded, the Hornet's Jennifer Fryou
walked in two runs. Senior Elizabeth Bendig's two-run single
to center capped off the Stanford rally.
With plenty of run support behind her, Severson was mas
terful. recording four 1-2-3 innings.
When I pitch, especially. I'm happy when they hit the
ball on the ground because I know we're going to make a play
or when I get a pop-up because somebody is going to catch
it," Severson said.
Stanford scored again in the second but the bats went
quiet in both dugouts until the fourth. With women on sec
ond and third, a single by Kayla Williams finally got Sacra
mento State on the board.
Severson returned to her usual dominating self for one
more inning before sophomore Danika Dukes recorded a
save in the 6-1 win.
Sunday's display of Stanford's ability to put together runs
and ability to prevent them was seen throughout the week
end at Smith Family Stadium. Friday's 8-0 win against Davis
allowed a couple of the Cardinal to pad their averages. Se
nior Meghan Sickler knocked in three runs with one hit and

Lappin brought in one. while scoring three times. Freshman
I .auren Nydam continued to demonstrate her importance to
Stanford's pitching staff this season as she went five scoreless
innings to notch her fourth win.
On Saturday, Auburn was the victim of Stanford's sec
ond blowout victory. Morris hit her fifth home run of the
season with a runner on board to give Stanford the early
lead in the second. Nelson followed with a three-run dinger
to center, her first of the season. Severson scattered four
hits over four innings in shutting out the only team in the
tournament that had a realistic chance to compete with the
Cardinal.
"I think we played our best against them, so the score
wasn't reflective of how good they were." Morris said. "I
think we just got ourselves up and did well."
"It was a closer game than 9-0," Severson added. "They
had good hitters that battled, they had good pitching, we just
have great hitters, and we won the battle."
It was Alabama-Birmingham who gave Stanford its
biggest challenge, but McCullough and Nydam combined
for six innings in a 5-4 win on Saturday. Freshman third base
man Michelle Smith's bat also stayed hot throughout the
weekend and her double against UAB scored two.
MeC'ullough started and allowed just two runs in four in
nings but UAB battled back to tie the game 4-4 in the top of
the sixth. With pinch runner Heather Shook on base, Morris
stepped up and delivered the game-winning run with a dou
ble.
"I was just trying to come up with a hit." Morris said. "I
knew going into the seventh inning I didn't really want to be
tied. It was my fourth at-bat of the day so I felt I'd seen the
pitcher and I felt like I was on her."

Freshman pitcher Lauren Nydam picked up her fourth
win of the season in the Stanford Invitational this week
end.
An hi >ur and 20 minutes after the final game of the Stanfc >rd
Invitational was slated to start, a light rain began to fall. It was
well past their scheduled 1 p.m. start hut No. 4 Stanford (16-1)
and Sacramento State (9-6) still weren't on the field. Finally, at
around 2:25 p.m.. the Cardinal took the emerged from the
dugouts at Smith Family Stadium to play ball.
But Sunday's game wasn't the only one that didn't start on
time. Friday's second game, pitting Stanford against Texas
Tech, didn't start until 8:55 p.m. - almost a full two hours
after it was supposed to start. It's no wonder then that it was
the Cardinal's most difficult game of the weekend.
Despite their 8-4 win over a new Texas program led by a
first-year coach, the game was taxing for the Cardinal.
"We had a rain delay; we were out here for nine hours
total." junior centerfielder Catalina Morris said. "I know we
were out here until like 12 o'clock, so it was really testing our
selves to stay tough in the cold."
Two days later, and even though they may be used to the
game delays, the team didn't want a repeat. While Texas

at three through six innings, Stanford looked ready to wrap
