You know Parents' Weekend has ar
rived when your roommate finally picks
up the socks that have been hidden un
derneath the bed since last quarter or
when the Bookstore is besieged by in
quisitive couples with armfuls of Stan
ford memorabilia.
At the end of last week, some 3,(XX)
parents — coming from places as close as
Redwood City, Calif, and as far as India
and Zimbabwe — arrived on the Farm
fora festive weekend of tours, conversa
tions with University officials and a
glimpse into their sons and daughters'
lives at Stanford.
"We're delighted to have some in
sights into what happens here at Stan
ford," said Claudia and Greg Myall,
parents of Nathaniel, a junior. "We've
talked to friends whose children attend
other schools and realized that there's
just nothing like this elsewhere."
Given the short duration of their
stays, moms and dads wasted no time,
many arriving early on Thursday, the
day before the University rolled out its
red carpet and officially kicked off the
weekend-long event.
"I just visited the church and ate
lunch at the Old Union," said Sanne Lee
of Los Angeles, mother of freshman Jes
sica. "I'm glad that I've got to see the
campus and the extracurricular activities
that are parts of my daughter's life
here."
Parents like Sanne Lee who are in
terested in the University's architec
ture. had the opportunity to take guided
tours to the libraries, the Papua New
Guinea Sculpture Garden, the Rosen
berg Athletic Hall of Fame and the
tech-equipped Wallenberg Hall.
"We are very impressed," said Ros
alyn and Paul Meyer of Maui. Hawaii,
parents of freshman William, referring
to their tour of the James H. Clark Cen
ter. "The video about the Bio-X pro
gram was just magnificent."
On Saturday, parents packed
Memorial Auditorium to watch the
Fleet Street singers, Stanford Improvis
ers and Stanford Taiko.
For parents of freshmen, the week

end included a forum where they could
raise concerns and share tips on how to
handle having their children away from
home for the first time.
"Am I the only parent who thinks
that my child never calls home?" asked
one mother during a panel discussion
moderated by Julie Lythcott-Haims,
dean of freshmen and transfer students.
About one-third of the parents in
attendance raised their hands in ac
knowledgment of the lack of commu
nication.
"See?" said Lythcott-Haims.
"You're not alone."
"Perhaps you should try e-mail," one
parent said. "I think email works better
than the telephone these days."
"Or instant-messaging," another
parent said. "It's easier for us."
Exchanges like these were not un
common during Parents' Weekend,
said Lythcott-Haims, who held similar
panels in previous years.
