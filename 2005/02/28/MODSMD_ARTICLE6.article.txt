# Lawyer maintains Peterson's innocence
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ DESK EDITOR 
Mark Geragos, the prominent criminal de
fense lawyer who recently represented Scott
Peterson, who was recently convicted of
killing his wife, Laci and their unborn son,
spoke Friday about his career and defending
clients in highly-publicized trials.
According to sophomore Seepan
Parseghian, president of the Armenian Stu
dents Association, which sponsored the event,
the group asked Geragos to speak in order
further its goal of "contributing the Armenian
perspective to the Stanford community in an
academic and social context."
"I am well aware of [Geragos's] charisma
and vibrant personality when in the spotlight,"
Parseghian said. "But I give more emphasis to
his dedication to the Armenian-American
community. He has taken on numerous cases
involving a wide range of Armenian issues."

Geragos, an Armenian American who at
tended Haverford College and Loyola Law
School, founded a private law firm with his fa
ther in 1983 and has specialized in criminal de
fense work ever since. Geragos said it is be
coming increasingly difficult to defend ac
cused criminals due to wide-spread media
coverage.
"What's happened with cable TV is that
you have a 'Foxification' of criminal law,"
Geragos said. "You get these high-profile
criminal cases and the mainstream media cov
ers them in the most sensational way possible.
With the internet, any rumor is quickly picked
up and once it is on cable TV mainstream
media feels compelled to run with the story."
This "Foxification," said Geragos, was es
pecially prevalent during Peterson's murder
trial.
"So many times during the case people
were bringing up rumors about evidence that
was not even presented,"he said.

Although jurors convicted Peterson of
murdering his wife Lacy and their unborn son.
Geragos maintains Peterson's innocence. He
said he took the case originally because he felt
moved by the scene that he observed when
Peterson was initially brought into custody.
"I became so incensed when he was arrest
ed," Geragos said. "There was a throng of
people outside holding up signs that he should
die. I never thought that in this day and age
that 1 would see anything like that. It was a
very troubling thing for me to see — someone
being railroaded and confronted by a virtual
lynch mob."
Geragos did not speak specifically about
the trial because he is under a gag-order until
Peterson's sentencing in March. He did. how
ever. say that much of the press coverage did
not accurately represent the evidence or facts
of the case. He attributed much of this misin-
formation to the fact that the judge
did not sequester jurors.
"During the course of the case we
were able to expose three separate
stealth jurors who lied in order to try
to get on the jury," Geragos said.
"There was so much community fer
vor against Scott that many of the ju
rors wanted to be on the jury because
they had their own private agenda."
Geragos called what happened on
the day of the verdict — thousands of
people lined up outside of the court
house and cheering the outcome —
"one of the sickest things [he had]
ever seen."
"There is truly nothing worse than

to see a guy you believe is innocent get
sentenced to death," Geragos said.
Although Peterson has not yet
been sentenced, upon his conviction,
jurors recommended that he receive
the death penalty. Geragos called
capital punishment "abhorrent."
Junior Louise Nutt is taking a class
on the death penalty and came to the
talk specifically to ask Geragos about
his opinion on the subject.
"He brought up a lot of points
about the death penalty that I think
are very important, but that people
outside of the law don't usually hear
about," Nutt said.
In addition to defending Peterson,
Geragos has also been involved in nu
merous other high-profile cases. In
the late 19905, he represented Susan
McDougal, a close friend of former
President Bill Clinton, when she was
tried and convicted on fraud charges

related to the Whitewater scandal.
Despite his role in criminal cases,
Geragos called a class-action lawsuit
that he filed for survivors of the Ar
menian genocide one of his biggest
successes. The suit, which was filed
against New York Life Insurance on
behalf of 2,31)0 Armenian Americans
who purchased insurance policies
when they immigrated to the United
States during the genocide, resulted in
a $20 million settlement for the thou
sands of people who were originally
denied the right to collect on their poli
cies. Part of the settlement was also
earmarked for Armenian charities.
Mazi Pielsticker, a first-year law
student, said he enjoyed Geragos's
speech and appreciated the opportu
nity to hear such a prominent lawyer
speak.
"I thought he was awesome, very
charismatic," Pielsticker said.

ever seen."
"There is truly nothing worse than

to see a guy you believe is innocent get
sentenced to death," Geragos said.
Although Peterson has not yet
been sentenced, upon his conviction,
jurors recommended that he receive
the death penalty. Geragos called
capital punishment "abhorrent."
Junior Louise Nutt is taking a class
on the death penalty and came to the
talk specifically to ask Geragos about
his opinion on the subject.
"He brought up a lot of points
about the death penalty that I think
are very important, but that people
outside of the law don't usually hear
about," Nutt said.
In addition to defending Peterson,
Geragos has also been involved in nu
merous other high-profile cases. In
the late 19905, he represented Susan
McDougal, a close friend of former
President Bill Clinton, when she was
tried and convicted on fraud charges

related to the Whitewater scandal.
Despite his role in criminal cases,
Geragos called a class-action lawsuit
that he filed for survivors of the Ar
menian genocide one of his biggest
successes. The suit, which was filed
against New York Life Insurance on
behalf of 2,31)0 Armenian Americans
who purchased insurance policies
when they immigrated to the United
States during the genocide, resulted in
a $20 million settlement for the thou
sands of people who were originally
denied the right to collect on their poli
cies. Part of the settlement was also
earmarked for Armenian charities.
Mazi Pielsticker, a first-year law
student, said he enjoyed Geragos's
speech and appreciated the opportu
nity to hear such a prominent lawyer
speak.
"I thought he was awesome, very
charismatic," Pielsticker said.
Mark Geragos, the prominent criminal de
fense lawyer who recently represented Scott
Peterson, who was recently convicted of
killing his wife, Laci and their unborn son,
spoke Friday about his career and defending
clients in highly-publicized trials.
According to sophomore Seepan
Parseghian, president of the Armenian Stu
dents Association, which sponsored the event,
the group asked Geragos to speak in order
further its goal of "contributing the Armenian
perspective to the Stanford community in an
academic and social context."
"I am well aware of [Geragos's] charisma
and vibrant personality when in the spotlight,"
Parseghian said. "But I give more emphasis to
his dedication to the Armenian-American
community. He has taken on numerous cases
involving a wide range of Armenian issues."

Geragos, an Armenian American who at
tended Haverford College and Loyola Law
School, founded a private law firm with his fa
ther in 1983 and has specialized in criminal de
fense work ever since. Geragos said it is be
coming increasingly difficult to defend ac
cused criminals due to wide-spread media
coverage.
"What's happened with cable TV is that
you have a 'Foxification' of criminal law,"
Geragos said. "You get these high-profile
criminal cases and the mainstream media cov
ers them in the most sensational way possible.
With the internet, any rumor is quickly picked
up and once it is on cable TV mainstream
media feels compelled to run with the story."
This "Foxification," said Geragos, was es
pecially prevalent during Peterson's murder
trial.
"So many times during the case people
were bringing up rumors about evidence that
was not even presented,"he said.

Although jurors convicted Peterson of
murdering his wife Lacy and their unborn son.
Geragos maintains Peterson's innocence. He
said he took the case originally because he felt
moved by the scene that he observed when
Peterson was initially brought into custody.
"I became so incensed when he was arrest
ed," Geragos said. "There was a throng of
people outside holding up signs that he should
die. I never thought that in this day and age
that 1 would see anything like that. It was a
very troubling thing for me to see — someone
being railroaded and confronted by a virtual
lynch mob."
Geragos did not speak specifically about
the trial because he is under a gag-order until
Peterson's sentencing in March. He did. how
ever. say that much of the press coverage did
not accurately represent the evidence or facts
of the case. He attributed much of this misin-
formation to the fact that the judge
did not sequester jurors.
"During the course of the case we
were able to expose three separate
stealth jurors who lied in order to try
to get on the jury," Geragos said.
"There was so much community fer
vor against Scott that many of the ju
rors wanted to be on the jury because
they had their own private agenda."
Geragos called what happened on
the day of the verdict — thousands of
people lined up outside of the court
house and cheering the outcome —
"one of the sickest things [he had]
ever seen."
