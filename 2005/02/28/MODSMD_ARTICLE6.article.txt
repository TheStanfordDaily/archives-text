### KRISTIN MORITZ DESK EDITOR 
Mark Geragos, the prominent criminal de
fense lawyer who recently represented Scott
Peterson, who was recently convicted of
killing his wife, Laci and their unborn son,
spoke Friday about his career and defending
clients in highly-publicized trials.
According to sophomore Seepan
Parseghian, president of the Armenian Stu
dents Association, which sponsored the event,
the group asked Geragos to speak in order
further its goal of "contributing the Armenian
perspective to the Stanford community in an
academic and social context."
"I am well aware of [Geragos's] charisma
and vibrant personality when in the spotlight,"
Parseghian said. "But I give more emphasis to
his dedication to the Armenian-American
community. He has taken on numerous cases
involving a wide range of Armenian issues."

Geragos, an Armenian American who at
tended Haverford College and Loyola Law
School, founded a private law firm with his fa
ther in 1983 and has specialized in criminal de
fense work ever since. Geragos said it is be
coming increasingly difficult to defend ac

coverage.
"What's happened with cable TV is that
you have a 'Foxification' of criminal law,"
Geragos said. "You get these high-profile
criminal cases and the mainstream media cov
ers them in the most sensational way possible.
With the internet, any rumor is quickly picked
up and once it is on cable TV mainstream
media feels compelled to run with the story."
This "Foxification," said Geragos, was es
pecially prevalent during Peterson's murder
trial.
"So many times during the case people
were bringing up rumors about evidence that
was not even presented,"he said.

Although jurors convicted Peterson of
murdering his wife Lacy and their unborn son.
Geragos maintains Peterson's innocence. He
said he took the case originally because he felt
moved by the scene that he observed when
Peterson was initially brought into custody.
"I became so incensed when he was arrest
ed," Geragos said. "There was a throng of
people outside holding up signs that he should
die. I never thought that in this day and age
that 1 would see anything like that. It was a
very troubling thing for me to see â€” someone
being railroaded and confronted by a virtual
lynch mob."
Geragos did not speak specifically about
the trial because he is under a gag-order until
Peterson's sentencing in March. He did. how
ever. say that much of the press coverage did
not accurately represent the evidence or facts
of the case. He attributed much of this misin-
