# Weekend shows draw large crowds

### ELAINE CHOI STAFF WRITER 
Two student theater productions drew large crowds over
the weekend despite having simultaneous show times. The
Stanford Shakespeare Society presented "Twelfth Night"
and Ram's Head Theatrical Society premiered the student
written and produced show, "Pinkertons."
When artistic directors Ed Iskandar, Class of 2004, and
Maggie Mason, a junior, were chosen to head The Stanford
Shakespeare Society last spring, they decided on "Twelfth
Night" as part of a season-long repertoire that will conclude
with the spring production of "Hamlet."
" 'Twelfth Night' is one of the Bard's best comedies, with
a dynamic female lead, a number of clowning roles for tal
ented comedic actors and a plot full of entertaining twists,
turns and superb dialogue," said Executive Producer Dan
Anthony, a senior. "Moments of the play have powerful
drama that complements the humor and farce. It provides
Stanford Shakes a good platform to demonstrate our innova
tive style and training through performance."

Ram's Head Theatrical Society presented the student-written and -produced
"Pinkertons" this weekend at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
While the production was based
on the original Shakespeare play, it
was a more radical take on the classic
that made the dialogue more com
prehensible for casual theater-goers.
"We incorporate elements of style
from dance and music and never as
sume conventions of delivery or
blocking," Anthony said. "Our
Twelfth Night' is refreshingly funny
and entertaining."
"I thought the performance was a
lot of fun," said freshman Beth
Hoover, who watched the perfor
mance. "The changes that they made
to the play were well done and helped

make it more accessible to people who
are not so familiar with Shakespeare."
The cast of "Twelfth Night" in
cluded 18 roles. Rehearsals for the
production began at the beginning of
the quarter and included seven weeks
of structured practice.
"Our productions are completely
student-produced, -directed and -de
signed and strive to bring an innova
tive and modern interpretation of
Shakespeare's plays to life," said se
nior Jonathan Palley, producer and
technical director. "They are original,
entertaining, funny and full of ener
gy. We specialize in bringing our
plays to non-traditional spaces
around campus."
The other production, "Pinker
tons," is the story of two friends, Adam
Chase and Simon DiPasquale, who
journey through two worlds. The first

act explores the drudgery of 19th centu
ry Chicago when both main characters
are employed as clerks for the Pinker
tons National Detective Agency.
In the second and third acts, the
protagonists are dropped in an island
world called Fitasse where they must
withstand the elements that push their
friendship to an irreconcilable end. Se
nior Mike Solomon conceived the idea
for the play in the middle of 2(X)1 and
wrote the script for this year's musical.
"I am intrigued by that time in
American History and I wanted to
do a psychological study of charac
ters trapped in an impoverished and
naturalistic world," Solomon said. "I
think that music's expressive capaci
ty can say things about the human
condition that words cannot commu
nicate, and 'Pinkertons' strives to do
just that."

Planning for "Pinkertons" began in
November, and because the produc
tion was entirely original, cast mem
bers had the opportunity to create
unique interpretations of their roles.
"The ownership you feel fora show
after putting your own creative energy
into it is incredible and that's why we've
sacrificed a lot for Pinkertons,' " said
junior Grant Patterson, who played
Adam Chase.
Sophomore Rebecca Liao pro
duced the musical this year and focused
much of her time on the show's financial
success rather than artistic elements.
"Rebecca has led one of the most
successful publicity and fundraising
campaigns in recent memory,"
Solomon said. "Because of her
team's efforts, we have received over
$10,(XX) in grants and are drawing
great crowds."
