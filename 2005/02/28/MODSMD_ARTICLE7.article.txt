# Weekend shows draw large crowds

Two student theater productions drew large crowds over
the weekend despite having simultaneous show times. The
Stanford Shakespeare Society presented "Twelfth Night"
and Ram's Head Theatrical Society premiered the student
written and produced show, "Pinkertons."
When artistic directors Ed Iskandar, Class of 2004, and
Maggie Mason, a junior, were chosen to head The Stanford
Shakespeare Society last spring, they decided on "Twelfth
Night" as part of a season-long repertoire that will conclude
with the spring production of "Hamlet."
" 'Twelfth Night' is one of the Bard's best comedies, with
a dynamic female lead, a number of clowning roles for tal
ented comedic actors and a plot full of entertaining twists,
turns and superb dialogue," said Executive Producer Dan
Anthony, a senior. "Moments of the play have powerful
drama that complements the humor and farce. It provides
Stanford Shakes a good platform to demonstrate our innova
tive style and training through performance."
