Correction
In the article "School of Hu
manities and Sciences laces
large deficit" published Feb. 25,
The Daily inaccurately report
ed that the school is freezing
hiring to cut costs, when actual
ly the hiring process will only be
slowed temporarily. In the
same article The Daily incor
rectly stated that the school had
no reserves on hand, when it
does have reserve funds to
work with currently.
