# On this day in Stanford History...

On March /, 7999, The Daily covered
a historic moment in Stanford basket
ball when the Cardinal beat Arizona
at Maples Pavilion to clinch its first
Pac-10 basketball title. Below is an
excerpt:
"Dreams came true on Saturday
night at Maples Pavilion.
"Chills ran up and down spines.
Faces caked in red paint smiled until
they hurt.
"Hundreds oi students rushed
the floor and created a human wave
machine, upon which Mark Madsen
and David Moseley took a ride.
"And Mike Montgomery, the dis
tinguished, stoic head coach of the
Stanford men's basketball team,
traded in his suit and tie fora back
wards baseball cap and a new form

of neckwear — the net.
"These displays of unbridled
emotion were the final touches on an
absolutely perfect night.
"The No. 6 Cardinal had just
clinched its first-ever Pacific 10 Con
ference title with a 98-83 thrashing of
Arizona on Senior Night at Maples.
"Stanford fans had long hoped it
would be like this, and when their
wishes were finally realized, it was
almost too much to handle.
"Before the game, the Maples
faithful had witnessed a moving cer
emony to honor the greatest gradu
ating class in the program's history.
Players fought back tears a they car
ried flowers to their parents at mid
court.
"Montgomery received a huge
birthday cake from the Sixth Man

Club and was welcomed to the floor
with a rendition of 'Happy Birth
day.'
"But Montgomery will long re
member the day he turned 52 by the
ultimately sweet gift his players gave
him on the floor.
" it's been a long time coming,'
Montgomery said, i want to enjoy
this. Hey, they were having some fun
[after the game], and they deserved
it.'
" 'If you could write a script, this
is about as well as we could have
done.'
"In the wake of the biggest emo
tional roller coaster ride of his young
life, senior point guard Arthur Lee
had that look of disbelief in his eyes
— the very same glassy look that
came over him after the two-minute
stretch against Rhode Island when
he scored 13 points and carried Stan
ford to the Final Four."
" This is the best feeling I've ever
experienced,' Lee said. When asked
if he was sure last night was better
than the Final Four, Lee was quick to
answer- and he was understood,
loud and clear.
" 'They are two different enti
ties,' Lee clarified. "But to do this
here tonight on Senior Night, in
front of our fans with our families
here...l can't even describe it with
words.'"
