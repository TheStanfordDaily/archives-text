## The 						innovation of narration 
### DANIEL BERDICHEVSKY 
One night over winter break, I
dreamed that 1 was in hell with the
cast of "Star Trek: The Next Gener
ation." 1 don't know what this says about me
— 1 don't really want to know—but it did get
me thinking about the way "Star Treki has
changed in the 20 years since that show first
premiered. It also got me thinking about the
way storytelling in general has evolved.
Of course, I'm no expert in narration in
novation. 1 declared English as a major, then
undeclared it a year later. So this is purely
speculation based on observation — maybe
too much observation, thanks to my TiVo.
On that note, first, television. What I've
witnessed is a transition toward "story arcs"
in TV series. Arcs are plots that span multi
ple episodes, in which regular characters
can change, have their eyes poked out or
even die.
In "Star Trek" and most other weekly
shows, it used to be that writers were in
structed to make sure that the characters
ended each episode in approximately the
same place as they started.
If Data manufactured himself a daughter,
you could be pretty sure she would expedi
tiously disappear, be destroyed or sacrifice
herself by the end of the episode. The same
went for any character's new love interest.
But later versions of "Star Trek" began
to innovate with story arcs. These weren't
exactly groundbreaking: Daytime soap op
eras had been doing them for decades,
though their stories didn't involve evil
shapeshifters. Otherwise, how could you
have last season's villain return for this sea
son's finale?
Strangely, though, a show about the 24th
century took 30 years to catch up to "Daw
son's Creek." Story arcs have several advan
tages: They drive existing audiences to come
back every week. They allow for more inter
esting plots. They require writers to come up
with fewer "new ideas" and instead to focus
on creating a few really good ones.
However, their disadvantage is that they
make it harder for new viewers to get in
volved, which may explain why very good
shows like "Angel," "Jack and Bobby" and
even the recently cancelled "Enterprise"
(which I hardly ever watched for that very
reason) tend not to increase viewership
over time.
Different innovations have occurred lit
erature over the same period. Consider my
sophomore year roommate, Sasha. When
he was little, he wanted to be a postmodern
philosopher. Eventually he became an in
ternational tax attorney, and then he ran
away to a music conservatory in Holland. In
between he experimented with writing
"postmodern fiction."
His stories were ostentatiously weird. In
one, a romantically-involved pair of older
Jewish women (one of whom becomes a
man around page four) walk from Burbank
into sub-Saharan Africa while nearby
monks chant in honor of the Big Mac. It was
whimsical, almost nonsensical, yet deftly
written. I remember his showing me a book
called something like "Eight Devices of
Postmodern Fiction." He claimed to have
included all of them in his story.
What's happened, the way I see it, is a lot
of these devices that were very forcibly styl
ized back then have been internalized by
writers and readers as quirky, but no longer
revolutionary. Thus, a novel like "Middle
sex," by Jeffrey Eugenides. can switch be
tween a first-person and third-person nar
rator of indeterminate gender as naturally
as the plot moves back and forth across
three generations and two continents.
In"The Confessions of Max Tevoli," by
Andrew Sean Greer, a man is born old and
becomes younger as he ages, but the sci
ence of this is never questioned, and parts
of his story are told in reverse order.
What used to be referred to as "magical
realism" has bled over into fiction in gener
al. Maybe this is why science fiction cliches,
like time travel and memory manipulation,
can form the bases of critically acclaimed
films like "The Butterfly Effect" and "Eter
nal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind" without
them even being branded as science-fiction.
The result of all this is that plain-old lin
ear storytelling seems increasingly dated.
Instead, we have novels like Audrey Niff
eneggeris "The Time Traveler's Wife," in
which a woman is married to a man who
skips around in time so that in each scene,
he is a different age.
Things happen in the beginning of the
book that actually take place later in the
plot. Trust me, it makes sense when you
read it. Part of this new comfort with com
plex narratives might be blamed on (or
credited to) the Internet, where hyperlinks
have gotten us used to reading bits and
pieces that connect in different ways.
In fact, it used to be that if an author put
a shotgun over the fireplace at the start of a
novel, it had to be fired by the epilogue.
These days, it's more likely that in the last
scene, it turns out the shotgun was the nar
rator all along.
