# Green Dorm Project team plans to bring eco-friendly dorm to campus

### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Change the way you live by where you live" was the motto
put forth by Richard Luthy. chair of the Civil and Environ
mental Engineering Department, as he presented the Green
Dorm Project, the plan for an innovative, ecologically friend
ly dormitory, to representatives of the Obayashi Corporation.
A team of Stanford faculty and students is working on the
Green Dorm Project, but plans for the building are far from
final. The "Green Dorm" is expected to house 50 to 55 Stan
ford students and may feature specially-designed glass doors
for ventilation as well as an underfloor heating and cooling
system.
Additionally, a ground-couple heat pump would provide
natural temperature regulation — taking advantage of the
relatively warm ground during the winter and the relatively
cool earth during the summer. Finally, cultivating plants on
the roof will provide better insulation, protect building mate
rials and possibly allow for water purification.
The innovative technologies should not require consider
able lifestyle changes. Gil Masters, a professor emeritus in
civil and environmental engineering and another leader of the
Green Dorm Project, compared the Green Dorm to Colum
bae, which is a house found to have the lowest energy costs per
student on the Row.
"These folks tend to be the greenest people on campus in
terms of hugging trees and whatever," Masters said. "We have
to be at least as green as a house built in 1920 and have normal
students living in it,"he added in jest.
The Green Dorm Project team is now finishing up the
scoping phase, which involves working with administrative
processes to address University regulations. They have con
sidered two sites for the house, and team members are leaning
toward a Mayfield site, somewhere behind Xanadu and Casa
ltaliana, to draw more visitors.
Three architects and engineers from Obayashi, a Japanese
architecture and construction firm, joined students and facul
ty from the Civil and Environmental Engineering Depart
ment for the "Workshop on Sustainable Buildings and Tech
nologies" on Feb. 24 and 25.
Martin Fischer, a professor of civil and environmental en
gineering and a leader of the Green Dorm Project team, noted
that the School of Engineering has a long-standing relation
ship with Obayashi. Stanford alumni occupy senior manage
ment positions in the company, and the firm offers internships
to students in the Kyoto Overseas Studies Program.
"The interaction has been one of the more long-lasting and
fruitful for teaching and learning," Fischer said. "When they
heard about our Green Dorm Project, they offered to come
share their expertise, which is rare and great."
On Feb. 24. Obayashi representatives presented a public
seminar about sustainable buildings, which exposed Green

Dorm Project designers to environmental building techniques
used by the company.
The workshop consisted of seminars and break-out groups
over the course of two days so that members of the Green
Dorm team could receive feedback and guidance on their
building plans.
To provide energy to the house, a 10-kilowatt, WO-square
foot photovoltaic cell could be paired with other solar cells as
well as a solid oxide fuel cell. Leaving nothing to waste, excess
heat from the fuel cell would be used to provide hot water.
With all these systems, the Green Dorm Project team ex
pects that, by selling electricity produced during the day to the
utility company and buying it back at night, the house would
have a zero net consumption of electricity.
Masters compared energy production through the Green
Dorm technologies to normal electricity and fuel supplies.
"Here's a furnace that's 162 percent efficient." he said jok
ingly.
As for water usage, there are a number of plans for the
Green Dorm. The team expects that it will be possible to ob
tain enough water independent of a utility company, by recy
cling waste water to create potable water. However, regula
tions will dictate what kind of waste water can be recycled and
limit the use of the recycled water to toilets and irrigation.
Even so, that would decrease water use by 50 percent.
"We can do a lot more technologically than what we would
be allowed by the county," said Masters. "These are in some
sense conservative estimates, and we're not going too far," he
said.
The idea for the Green Dorm Project first arose in Novem
ber 2003, when faculty of the Civil and Environmental Engi
neering Department first conceived of a "living laboratory,"
where technologies for energy use and water
management/conservation could be used and tested. Accord
ing to faculty members, the house would focus on teaching
and learning through hands-on experimentation, with demon
stration and teaching spaces in the basement. Students are ex
pected to be involved throughout the life of the house, start
ing now with student representatives on the planning team.
"We're trying all of these innovative systems, but it some
thing goes wrong, students will still be comfortable." said Lau
ren Dietrich, a Green Dorm Project student representative
and graduate student in civil and environmental engineering.
"Toilets won't overflow. They won't be too hot or too cold."
A number of students have already been involved with var
ious stages of the Green Dorm Project through coursework in
the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. Mas
ters offered courses last winter and spring quarters, in which
students investigated possible technologies and model pro
jects, such as a dorm at Carnegie Mellon University that had
used 31 percent less energy than comparable buildings.
"The Green Dorm has already fulfilled a lot of its goal of
learning and building," said Masters.

Still, there is apparently much more room for student in
volvement according to those involved with the project. Class
es dealing with aspects of the Green Dorm Project will con
tinue to be offered. Furthermore, there may be internship or
job opportunities with the design and construction firms to be
involved in the building of the Green Dorm.
Another student representative. Alec Clowes, a senior,
suggested student participation in weekly meetings with ar
chitects or University Land and Buildings staff. Once the
Green Dorm is constructed, students should also take part in
the monitoring of the house's performance, Clowes said.
"During the operational phase, it will be important to have
students involved in designing and maintaining the building,"
Clowes said.
The faculty and students have been working with the Land
and Buildings group and Housing and Dining Services partic
ularly closely.
"They're the reality check about how a dorm works," 1
Luthy said.
While the Green Dorm Project team emphasizes teaching,
learning, demonstration and evolutionary technologies, it in
tends to make the Green Dorm a comfortable and desirable
place to live.
"It's not like the students that would live there would feel
like they're guinea pigs," Luthy said. According to Luthy, the
hope is that the Green Dorm would become a popular house,
enjoyable to everyone.
1 iowevei. a lot needs to be done before the Green Dorm
becomes a reality. The next stage is to take the plans to the
University Provost John Etchemendy to get permission to
conduct a feasibility study, which will involve confirming the
site and discussing fundraising tactics.
Though the construction costs of the Green Dorm may be
higher than those fora typical Stanford residences, designers
say they are pushing the idea of "lifetime cycle costs" — long
run energy and water savings — to make up for the heftier up
front price tag. Given the nature of the project, they also said
they expect that it may be easier to raise funds from private
donors than it typically is for dorm projects.
"We're not just making the students happy," said Masters.
"We want to push the efficiency envelope."
