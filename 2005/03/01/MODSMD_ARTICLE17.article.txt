# Looking for a DVD? Head to Green...
## 
### AMANDA MITCHELL 
It's a bit before 6 p.m. on a Friday night.
A long line winds through Green Library's
Media-Microtext Center, right before clos
ing time. With its library of 9,000 DVDs.
Green has become a popular place for stu
dents to find their nightly entertainment,
free of charge, from Stanford's extensive
movie collection.
"By the end of the day on Fridays, the line
is always out way past stacks," said senior
Chelsea Steiner, who works in the Media-
Microtext Center at Green. "Many more
people know about the library's DVDs now.
even compared to just last year. Word has
started to spread about the free movies at
Green."
Although Netflix, which allows sub
scribers to rent unlimited DVDs for $17.99
each month, has become immensely popular
across the country, Stanford students do not
seem to use the service, in large part because
of they can borrow DVDs for free from the li
brary.
"i had Netllix at home and loved it." said
freshman Jessica Yurkofsky. "They have an
expansive collection of DVDs and are really
prompt. Green is nice though, because it's
free and within easy biking distance. I use it
because it's convenient, and I'm afraid my
parents will yell at me if I ask them to pay for
Netflix."
"Also, even though the waiting time for
Netflix DVDs to arrive in the mail was not
too long, it's even better to be able to walk to
Green and get a movie whenever you want
or need one." Yurkofsky added.
Daisy Chung, a sophomore who also
works in Green Library's Media-Microtext
Center, said that the library's extensive, free
assortment of DVDs also keeps students
away from Blockbuster and other rental
stores.
"The Green system is unique to Stanford;
it has more DVDs in general than any other
school library I've heard of but also more
kinds of DVDs like foreign films and docu
mentaries, and they're all free," Chung said.
"I wouldn't pay to rent anything as a student
here. 1 don't have a Blockbuster card or any
thing because it just wouldn't be practical."
The Blockbuster in downtown Palo Alto,
however, says that much of their business
comes from Stanford students," said a
Blockbuster employee who requested to re
main anonymous. To compete with Netflix,
the company recently launched a similar on
line, monthly DVD subscription service.
Junior Angelica Nava, a photographer at
The Daily, and sophomore Vivek
Venkataram said that the inconvenience of
getting to Blockbuster keeps them from

renting there.
"I'm too lazy to go all the way to Block
buster," Venkataram said. "I just wait for
someone else."
"Netflix and Green also both have a wide
selection of TV show seasons on DVD.
while Blockbuster's selection is much more
limited," Yurkofsky added.
However, not all students take advantage
of Green's extensive, free DVD library.

Senior Julia Lee said she recently started
renting DVDs from Safeway.
"I rent from Safeway since it's extremely
cheapâ€”only $0.99 per day." she said, "Even
though you can only select from a few dozen
of the most recent releases, it's still really
easy and convenient."
Students in West Florence Moore Hall
have the option of borrowing DVDs for free
from Resident Fellow Patrick Young.

"I have a moderate-sized collection,"
Young said. "It's small enough that students
looking for specific movies are often disap
pointed. However, it's large enough that stu
dents can usually find something they want
to watch."
Some students say they really do not rent
at all, choosing to borrow from friends or
buying their own movies.
"My roommates have purchased a lot of
DVDs, so 1 just borrow theirs," said sopho
more Christina McCauley. "1 wouldn't rent
because we have Green, but 1 don't use
Green because 1 have friends with all the
movies I want to watch."
Senior Drew Taylor said he obtains most
of the DVDs he watches by purchasing them
at Best Buy.
"I just like to buy the movies I really like,
and Best Buy has some really good deals, so
getting my movies that way has worked out
well for me," Taylor said. "I don't know
much about Green, but I like to be able to
watch the DVDs multiple times, and you
can't do that with rentals."
Multiple viewings of DVDs are especially
difficult when one borrows them from Green
Library because they are due by closing time
the next day. Despite its popularity, the sys
tem at Green has generated some criticism.
"It's sometimes difficult to get certain
DVDs when teachers, who can have them
for longer than students, check them out,"
Yurkofsky said. "Also, there's no waiting
list, which is a nice feature of Netflix."
Others complained of the $15 a day late
fee Green charges.
"The big downside in renting from Green
is that you absolutely have to return it the
next day if you don't want to pay some exor
bitant fee," Lee said.
The hours can also deter students from
Green. The Media-Microtext Center is open
Sunday through Thursday until 9 p.m., but
on weekends, when most students want to
watch movies, the center closes at 6 p.m.
Nevertheless, according to Steiner, the
Green Media-Microtext Center is a great re
source for students.
"In addition to the 9.(HX) DVDs, we also
have 18.(XX) VHS tapes, 500 laser disks, mi
crofilm. software and various Xbox and
Playstation 2 games with consoles," Steiner
said. "It's really an incredible resource for
students."
As Steiner described the services of
Green, a protective regular looked up from
the microfiche screen in front of her and
said, "Tell them it's terrible; no one else
should come here and rent DVDs."
"No. really it's great," she finally admit
ted. "But seriously, no one else should come.
Too manv know as it is."
