## Editorial Re-evaluation of special-fees system needed 
### 
Eihlor's Note: The Stanford Daily was one of two joint
student groups that was denied placement on the spe
cial-lees ballot.

Last week, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate and
the Graduate Student Council, or GSC, decided
which groups would he placed on this year's special
fees ballot.
Ol the 37 that applied as undergraduate student
groups, live were denied placement on the ballot by
the Senate. The Senate also rejected two of the eight
joint student groups — the Jewish Students Associa
tion and The Stanford Daily — that applied to be on
the ballot. (A joint student group is one that requests
funding from both the undergraduate- and graduate
student populations.)The GSC reviewed and rejected
the same two joint student groups that were reviewed
and rejected by the Senate. (Two joint student groups
and three undergraduate student groups are petition
ing for more than the student governments' recom
mended funding.)
In order for these denied groups to make it onto
the special-fees ballot, the groups have one week to
collect signatures Ironi 15 percent of the relevant stu
dent populations to petition the decision.
Some of the decisions to deny placement on the
special-fees ballot seem arbitrary and unfair. For ex
ample, the Senate's denial of Dance Marathon and the
Forum for American Chinese Exchange at Stanford
essentially penalizes student groups for showing fiscal
responsibility. Just because a group manages tosustain

itself for one year does not mean that operating with
out special fees is plausible or desirable in the long
run. If the Senate and the GSC continue to use this du
bious rationale to deny groups a place on the ballot,
these groups will face a Catch-22: If they manage to
scrape by with a reduced budget, the student govern
ments will use this fact against them in the future.
The denials of ballot placement by the Senate and
GSC also call into question the larger purpose of spe
cial fees. Must a student group cater to the entire un
dergraduate or graduate student population in order
to qualify for special fees? Are special fees meant only
for those student groups that are unable to support
themselves financially? The Senate and the GSC
could do more to justify their decisions and articulate
their stance towards the special-fees program.
In addition, the roles played by the Senate and the
GSC in the special-fees process are highly problematic.
Granted, previous years'elections — in which students
approved nearly all requests, then proceeded to ask for
refunds from those same groups — have shown that
without some oversight the special-fees process can ac
tually place student groups in serious financial jeop
ardy. However, recent reforms to the special-fees sys
tem made it more difficult for students to receive re
funds — students must now justify each of their refund
requests, and they receive their payment in the form of
a credit toward their University bill. With these safe
guards in place, additional restrictions are unnecessary.

If Senate and GSC representatives
believe that students should choose
which groups to support, then the stu
dent governments should not be deny
ing groups a place on the ballot.
We believe that all student groups
that want to be on the ballot should be
placed on the ballot. Since there is no
fixed sum of money that student
groups have to jostle for in the special
fees process, there is no compelling
reason to bar certain groups from par
ticipating in this process.
The Senate and the GSC should
play a minimal role in the process, in
tervening only to prevent fraud. At
most, the two bodies should publish
their recommendations on which
groups need funding to benefit the stu
dent community.
Such a proposal could go a long
way in building a broader and more in
clusive sense of community at Stan
ford. Allowing a diverse ptx)l of stu
dent groups to request special fees is a
way of affirming the many interesting
facets of student life these groups bring
to Stanford.
In particular, given complaints that
many graduate students feel isolated
from the Stanford community, we en

courage the GSC to consider placing
more student groups on their special
fees ballot. We also encourage more
groups to place themselves under joint
consideration for both the undergrad
uate and graduate special-fees ballots.
Again, such a policy will have its
own problems — students might once
more vote indiscriminately for every
thing on the ballot. But we feel that a
stringent refund policy will prevent the
kind of financial crisis that the special
fees program faced last year, in which
high refund rates threatened the sol
vency of the special-fees buffer fund.
Students must be more involved in
the entire special-fees process. They
should overcome their sense of apathy
and get out and vote for student
groups they want to support, rather
than requesting refunds from groups
they do not want to support. We be
lieve that greater involvement on the
part of the student population will go a
long way to developing a better sense
of community.
To that end, we encourage all
groups to continue to raise awareness
about the activities they organize that
contribute to a diverse and varied.stu
dent life. Many of these groups play a
major role in enriching our Stanford
experience. We hope that groups de
nied a place on the special-fees ballot
will take advantage of the petition
process to create awareness of what
they bring to the student population.
