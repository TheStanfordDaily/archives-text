## Editorial Re-evaluation of special-fees system needed 
### 
Eihlor's Note: The Stanford Daily was one of two joint
student groups that was denied placement on the spe
cial-lees ballot.

Last week, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate and
the Graduate Student Council, or GSC, decided
which groups would he placed on this year's special
fees ballot.
Ol the 37 that applied as undergraduate student
groups, live were denied placement on the ballot by
the Senate. The Senate also rejected two of the eight
joint student groups — the Jewish Students Associa
tion and The Stanford Daily — that applied to be on
the ballot. (A joint student group is one that requests
funding from both the undergraduate- and graduate
student populations.)The GSC reviewed and rejected
the same two joint student groups that were reviewed
and rejected by the Senate. (Two joint student groups
and three undergraduate student groups are petition
ing for more than the student governments' recom
mended funding.)
In order for these denied groups to make it onto
the special-fees ballot, the groups have one week to
collect signatures Ironi 15 percent of the relevant stu
dent populations to petition the decision.
Some of the decisions to deny placement on the
special-fees ballot seem arbitrary and unfair. For ex
ample, the Senate's denial of Dance Marathon and the
Forum for American Chinese Exchange at Stanford
essentially penalizes student groups for showing fiscal
responsibility. Just because a group manages tosustain

itself for one year does not mean that operating with
out special fees is plausible or desirable in the long
run. If the Senate and the GSC continue to use this du
bious rationale to deny groups a place on the ballot,
these groups will face a Catch-22: If they manage to
scrape by with a reduced budget, the student govern
ments will use this fact against them in the future.
The denials of ballot placement by the Senate and
GSC also call into question the larger purpose of spe
cial fees. Must a student group cater to the entire un
dergraduate or graduate student population in order
to qualify for special fees? Are special fees meant only
for those student groups that are unable to support
themselves financially? The Senate and the GSC
could do more to justify their decisions and articulate
their stance towards the special-fees program.
In addition, the roles played by the Senate and the
GSC in the special-fees process are highly problematic.
Granted, previous years'elections — in which students
approved nearly all requests, then proceeded to ask for
refunds from those same groups — have shown that
without some oversight the special-fees process can ac
tually place student groups in serious financial jeop
ardy. However, recent reforms to the special-fees sys
tem made it more difficult for students to receive re
funds — students must now justify each of their refund
requests, and they receive their payment in the form of
a credit toward their University bill. With these safe
guards in place, additional restrictions are unnecessary.
