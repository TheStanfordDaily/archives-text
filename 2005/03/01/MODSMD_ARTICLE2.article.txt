### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
To mark the United Nations'
60th anniversary, the U.N. High-
Level Panel on Threats, Challenges
and Change, which includes Stan
ford Political Science Prof. Stephen
Stedman, issued over 100 recom
mendations for historic changes to
the United Nations' role in interna
tional security.
"We wanted a vision of the Unit
ed Nations as a much more effective
and equitable organization that is
much better prepared for the threats
of the 21st century," Stedman said in
an e-mail to The Daily. He is in New

York where he has been on leave
since fall of 2003 to work on the rec
ommendations.
The report, entitled "A more se
cure world: Our shared responsibili
ty," is designed to generate consen
sus among U.N.-member nations for
a new vision of the organization.
"As of right now the world is
completely divided about the threats
that we face and what are the best
options for addressing them," Sted
man said.
The report focuses on terrorism
as one of the most critical threats to
address, urging all U.N.-member na
tions to agree on the definition of
terrorism put forth in the report.

Stedman said. In addition, the report
encourages Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to articulate an effective
strategy to counter terrorism that
also respects universal human rights.
Highlighting nuclear prolifera
tion as an equally dangerous threat,
the report establishes recommenda
tions to strengthen nuclear non-pro
liferation efforts by toughening in
spection safeguards and creating in
centives for developing states to
avoid developing uranium enrich
ment programs.
The panel also recommended the
creation of a new governmental
body within the United Nations
