## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
To mark the United Nations'
60th anniversary, the U.N. High-
Level Panel on Threats, Challenges
and Change, which includes Stan
ford Political Science Prof. Stephen
Stedman, issued over 100 recom
mendations for historic changes to
the United Nations' role in interna
tional security.
"We wanted a vision of the Unit
ed Nations as a much more effective
and equitable organization that is
much better prepared for the threats
of the 21st century," Stedman said in
an e-mail to The Daily. He is in New

York where he has been on leave
since fall of 2003 to work on the rec
ommendations.
The report, entitled "A more se
cure world: Our shared responsibili
ty," is designed to generate consen
sus among U.N.-member nations for
a new vision of the organization.
"As of right now the world is
completely divided about the threats
that we face and what are the best
options for addressing them," Sted
man said.
The report focuses on terrorism
as one of the most critical threats to
address, urging all U.N.-member na
tions to agree on the definition of
terrorism put forth in the report.

Stedman said. In addition, the report
encourages Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to articulate an effective
strategy to counter terrorism that
also respects universal human rights.
Highlighting nuclear prolifera
tion as an equally dangerous threat,
the report establishes recommenda
tions to strengthen nuclear non-pro
liferation efforts by toughening in
spection safeguards and creating in
centives for developing states to
avoid developing uranium enrich
ment programs.
The panel also recommended the
creation of a new governmental
body within the United Nations
Reforms for U.N.

called the Peacebuilding Com
mission — responsible for moni
toring nations recovering from
civil war, among other tasks —
and advised the United Nations
to increase its capacity in media
tion and peacekeeping.
A potentially controversial
recommendation advises U.N.-
member states to endorse what is
known as the "responsibility to
protect," which essentially oblig
ates states to respond to protect
civilians in the event of genocide,
ethnic cleansing, massive atroci
ties or massive violations of inter
national humanitarian laws. This
proposal conflicts with existing
U.N. mandates respecting the
sovereignty of states.
Other recommendations
focus on international heath is
sues. For instance, one provision
calls fora global initiative to deal
with infectious disease and bio
terrorism. while another sup
ported more resources to fight
HIV/AIDS.
Stedman said he remains opti
mistic that (lie recommendations
will be enacted, especially since
international heads of state will
be meeting in New York in Sep
tember to commemorate the or

ganization s anniversary.
"We are hopeful that we can
get action on a lot of the recom
mendations," he said. "We want
ed to develop recommendations
that had a chance of adoption
and implementation. It was not
meant to be a Utopian exercise."
Stedman is working to lead
Annan's effort to make the rec
ommendations a reality.
"Most of my time is spent
working with governments to con
vince them that the vision of the
Panel report about a new collec
tive security is in their interest and
trying to get them to commit to the
recommendations," he said.
Stedman added that he would
like to be back on the Farm by
the beginning of next academic
year.
"Our big event is the summit
in New York in September after
which I look forward to getting
back to California," he said.
Stedman, also a senior fellow at
the Stanford Institute for Interna
tional Studies, said he has worked
for more than 15 years to build
peace in the wake of civil wars all
over the globe, lie has previously
consulted with the United Nations
on several occasions.
