# Tales of a 19th-grade nothing
## Why I hate The Band... 
### 
I've been advised against writing
this column many times. I've been
awkwardly "shushed" when just try
ing to bring up the topic. In all, I think
I'd have an easier time discussing sex
ual preference ala Ricky Martin
press conference. Bui here it is any
ways: I hate the Stanford Band. Now.
I imagine there are a good number of
you already starting up your e-mail
software, but before you do, let me

give this initial caveat: I do not hate the MEMBERS of
the band. I hate the Band. In fact, therein lies the real
tragedy.
There are few instances of a whole being less than the
sum of its parts but the Band is a perfect example. How
such a talented group gets together to form the musical
equivalent of a Jackson Pollock painting of'an intestine is
beyond me. I've seen better organization in the General
Admission section of a Slipknot concert. And I know it's
supposedly a "Stanford thing." but is it really?
First off, the band isn't funny. Hey Band: The 70's
called and wants its humor back, and it's pissed you kept
it so long. During my year on the Stanford sideline 1
never heard anyone laugh at any of the Band's jokes.
Nor did I ever hear anyone comment afterwards about
how witty the Band's performance/commentaries were.
It was mostly like conversations with my ex: just a lot of
head shaking and waiting for it to be over. These "per
formances" mostly consisted of "inside" jokes, and lis
tening to them was a little like watching a foreign film
without subtitles.
Second, if the whole point is to rebel against the es
tablishment, just what are you rebelling against anyway?
"Alternative" became mainstream 15 years ago. Nowa
days, U2 is shilling for Apple, the anti-war effort is most
ly conducted via "blogging" and there's more weed on
MTV than there is on campus. 1 mean, honestly, are all
the kids at Southern and Grambling, who annually put on
the Battle of the Bands, just tools of the vast right-wing
conspiracy bent on stifling your expression? Was

"Drumline" actually fascist propaganda, suhliminally
breaking your spirit, and turning you into mindless au
tomatons? Come on.
Wait. There's no point? You're just having fun? Well,
fantastic. Could you go have your fun in private? Or at
least somewhere you won't be nationally televised? Or
where all my friends and relatives will form their impres
sion of Stanford? That'd be great. Then we could find
some people who want to represent their school posi
tively, and let them at least learn how to march, for God's
sake. I mean the Band can't even make a very good cir
cle. Maybe it would be ok if the Band was loud, or at least
excited. But the Band is regularly outplayed in volume,
quantity and quality by visiting bands. 1 mean. I've heard
better out of two snare drums and a flute from Chico.
And 1 don't want to hear about how "It's not a com
petition ..." from a school whose kids wear more "Di
rector's Cup" t-shirts than Abercrombie logos. Because
it is, and we're losing. Take, for example, when USC was
in town last year. There, the Stanford football team dis
played talent, tenacity and intensity that we could all be
proud of in the face of overwhelming odds (and fan apa
thy). The Band, however, up against an equally impres
sive USC Band, was a complete abortive mess. I spent
the time they were on the field shaking my head in disbe
lief and just turning away from the carnage in vicarious
embarrassment, and then screamed for the USC Band
like an N'Sync groupie.
Hey Band â€” want to rebel? Form a garage band,
paint "Anarchy" symbols on some old Army jackets and
stand in White Plaza chanting about "no-blood-for-oil"
without any shoes on. For the rest of us, do us all a favor
and stop ruining the pageantry that is supposed to be col
lege sports. Stanford is a great place that you're supposed
to be representing. But you wouldn't know "great" if it
walked up and slapped you with its tuba.
