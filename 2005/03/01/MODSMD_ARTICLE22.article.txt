# Holt's harangue
## Sell out with me 
### 
I think it's great that the new
Maples Pavilion is sponsored by half
a dozen companies that blast their
messages during every time-out. If
there is one thing 1 really envied the
Cal weenies for.it was Haas's corpo
rate approval. It's nice to know that
soft drinks and mutual fund compa
nies support the sporting events 1 at
tend. I look forward to every game
break so that the students can be

drowned out by
the sweet sounds
of consumerism.
In particular,
I'm really happy
to know that
Maples is being
supported by
Curves, a chain of
woman-focused
fitness centers

that are owned by Gary Heavin.
Heavin is renowned for funding
anti-abortion groups that publish lit
erature that purports that abortion
causes breast cancer. Ironically, his
company makes its fortune off of
women's health and then uses that
money to undercut a woman's right
to choose. He sounds exactly like the
kind of person our University wants
to promote.
I've heard Stanford is a bit
strapped for cash these days, and so
I'm thinking we should extend this
corporate sponsorship to other parts
of campus. Imagine, if you will, a
world in which students didn't com
plain about special-fees funding.
Every student group would be fund
ed and students wouldn't have to
pick up the tab. This can all be possi
ble if we got special fees groups to
seek corporate sponsorship. Pacific
Bell sponsors the American Sign
Language Club or Prudential Life
Insurance sponsors the Rock-
Climbing Club or the Bechtel Cen
ter (the same Bechtel that has major
ties to the Bush administration)
houses the Roosevelt Instit — nev
ermind.
1 always get sad when the campus
is bare of posters. With corporate
sponsorship, I'll thankfully never
have to see White Plaza in its pure
beauty ever again. The Bookstore
will hopefully expand its poster cam
paign to envelop all of the campus.
Maybe we can get Yahoo to sponsor
the Claw and dye it purple and yel
low — even the water. And then
place billboards on every tree on
Palm Drive.
I think corporate sponsorship can
be taken even further, though. The
bonfire's removal from Lake Lag
was the work of salamander sup
porters. Why not get another organi

zation like Propane, Inc. or the fine
folks who make WD-40 to sponsor
the bonfire? With corporate spon
sorship, our annual Stanford tradi
tion can make a fire so big, it can be
seen from space! As an added
bonus, we get to see what barbequed
tiger salamander tastes like. Throw
another endangered species on the
bar-bee!
This whole selling out thing can
apply to the new Munger dorm too.
Why shouldn't the University build
over Salvatierra Walk? Unlike my
other proposals, we already have a
big donation for this one. The grad
students really need it, too, because
without it there is no way they will be
integrated into the Stanford commu
nity. It's not like previous attempts
at integrating grad students have
failed. We shouldn't just accept that
even after they erect the building, no
one will see the residents who dwell
therein.
Do the Chi Theta Chi residents
know how their meager protests are
hurting our chances to cash in on a
major donor's generosity? I don't
understand this argument about
maintaining the natural beauty,
quietness and aesthetic appeal of the
area. This campus isn't a national
park; it's a damn learning factory.
I 'm sure they'll make a big deal when
the find out that Synergy is going to
be turned into the new Hoover build
ing (Condi is donating some money)
and Columbae will be demolished to
support a new Burger King site.
And what about the Oval? Do we
really need a new big "S" there all
the time? I mean, we get that we go
to Stanford. We don't need to be
sold on that; we already bought the
cow. Why not rent it out bi-weekly to
different corporations. One week it
can have AOL's symbol, the next
Google's, etc. I mean we really
haven't tapped into the people who
fly over Stanford and are breathless
by how stark and sponsor-less our
campus is.
There are may be some objec
tions to consumerism and selling
out. But 1 insist this university
should not be able to pick and
choose the donors and sponsors it
selects for contributions, weighing
the implications of the University's
endorsement. Don't tell me that the
administration should consider stu
dent opinions when deciding to erect
major buildings that may adversely
affect their lives. Don't tell me that
tiger salamander doesn't taste good.

Mmm ... endangered species. Send

tion can make a fire so big, it can be
seen from space! As an added
bonus, we get to see what barbequed
tiger salamander tastes like. Throw
another endangered species on the
bar-bee!
This whole selling out thing can
apply to the new Munger dorm too.
Why shouldn't the University build
over Salvatierra Walk? Unlike my
other proposals, we already have a
big donation for this one. The grad
students really need it, too, because
without it there is no way they will be
integrated into the Stanford commu
nity. It's not like previous attempts
at integrating grad students have
failed. We shouldn't just accept that
even after they erect the building, no
one will see the residents who dwell
therein.
Do the Chi Theta Chi residents
know how their meager protests are
hurting our chances to cash in on a
major donor's generosity? I don't
understand this argument about
maintaining the natural beauty,
quietness and aesthetic appeal of the
area. This campus isn't a national
park; it's a damn learning factory.
I 'm sure they'll make a big deal when
the find out that Synergy is going to
be turned into the new Hoover build
ing (Condi is donating some money)
and Columbae will be demolished to
support a new Burger King site.
And what about the Oval? Do we
really need a new big "S" there all
the time? I mean, we get that we go
to Stanford. We don't need to be
sold on that; we already bought the
cow. Why not rent it out bi-weekly to
different corporations. One week it
can have AOL's symbol, the next
Google's, etc. I mean we really
haven't tapped into the people who
fly over Stanford and are breathless
by how stark and sponsor-less our
campus is.
There are may be some objec
tions to consumerism and selling
out. But 1 insist this university
should not be able to pick and
choose the donors and sponsors it
selects for contributions, weighing
the implications of the University's
endorsement. Don't tell me that the
administration should consider stu
dent opinions when deciding to erect
major buildings that may adversely
affect their lives. Don't tell me that
tiger salamander doesn't taste good.

Mmm ... endangered species. Send

I think it's great that the new
Maples Pavilion is sponsored by half
a dozen companies that blast their
messages during every time-out. If
there is one thing 1 really envied the
Cal weenies for.it was Haas's corpo
rate approval. It's nice to know that
soft drinks and mutual fund compa
nies support the sporting events 1 at
tend. I look forward to every game
break so that the students can be

drowned out by
the sweet sounds
of consumerism.
In particular,
I'm really happy
to know that
Maples is being
supported by
Curves, a chain of
woman-focused
fitness centers

that are owned by Gary Heavin.
Heavin is renowned for funding
anti-abortion groups that publish lit
erature that purports that abortion
causes breast cancer. Ironically, his
company makes its fortune off of
women's health and then uses that
money to undercut a woman's right
to choose. He sounds exactly like the
kind of person our University wants
to promote.
I've heard Stanford is a bit
strapped for cash these days, and so
I'm thinking we should extend this
corporate sponsorship to other parts
of campus. Imagine, if you will, a
world in which students didn't com
plain about special-fees funding.
Every student group would be fund
ed and students wouldn't have to
pick up the tab. This can all be possi
ble if we got special fees groups to
seek corporate sponsorship. Pacific
Bell sponsors the American Sign
Language Club or Prudential Life
Insurance sponsors the Rock-
Climbing Club or the Bechtel Cen
ter (the same Bechtel that has major
ties to the Bush administration)
houses the Roosevelt Instit — nev
ermind.
1 always get sad when the campus
is bare of posters. With corporate
sponsorship, I'll thankfully never
have to see White Plaza in its pure
beauty ever again. The Bookstore
will hopefully expand its poster cam
paign to envelop all of the campus.
Maybe we can get Yahoo to sponsor
the Claw and dye it purple and yel
low — even the water. And then
place billboards on every tree on
Palm Drive.
I think corporate sponsorship can
be taken even further, though. The
bonfire's removal from Lake Lag
was the work of salamander sup
porters. Why not get another organi

zation like Propane, Inc. or the fine
folks who make WD-40 to sponsor
the bonfire? With corporate spon
sorship, our annual Stanford tradi
tion can make a fire so big, it can be
seen from space! As an added
bonus, we get to see what barbequed
tiger salamander tastes like. Throw
