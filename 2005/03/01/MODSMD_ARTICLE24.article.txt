Ethnic theme houses are important
In David Louk's column, "Four-class for
me" (Feb. 28). his plea to stop placing people
in ethnic-theme dorms unless they request it
is misguided.
Ethnic-theme dorms tend to be the liveli
est and most enjoyable four class dorms on
campus. They provide an open space to dis
cuss issues of culture and ethnicity that is
often lacking in the typical Stanford dorm.
And unlike the senior living in Florence
Moore Hall, the majority of upperelassmen
living in ethnic-theme houses want to be
there.
The purpose of ethnic-theme houses is
two-fold: to serve as a residential base for an
ethnic community and to educate people of
other ethnic backgrounds. There are gener
ally more available spots for non-ethnic
freshmen in theme dorms than applicants,

which means that for some students, getting
housed in Ujamaa, Casa Zapata, Okada or
Muwekma means getting a third or fourth
housing choice. Stanford does this to main
tain its commitment to creating a multicul
tural environment by limiting the number of
ethnic students to 50 percent of the house
total. Without this policy, the role of ethnic
theme dorms in educating the greater Stan
ford community would be diminished.
Additionally, to say that any ethnic
theme house's focus has "no particular con
nection to your life" is disconcerting. If you
have any interactions with African-Ameri
can. Latino, Asian-American or Native
American students on campus in your four
years, the theme absolutely has a connec
tion to your life. For the typical student, liv
ing in an ethnic-theme dorm provides an ed
ucation that is unavailable in Stanford class
es and should be viewed as an opportunity

rather than a burden.

H &S School deficit under control
Editor's note: Please see correction on Page 2
In the article, "H&S School faces large
deficit" (Feb. 25), there were points that
need correction or clarification.
The lead paragraph stating that the school
is freezing faculty hires and graduate student
admissions is not accurate. We are slowing
faculty recruitment and graduate admissions
for one to two years, but we are not imple
menting a freeze. The slow down is one of
the steps we are taking to bring the budget
into balance, which is appropriate given that
these are areas of growth over the years that
have contributed to the current imbalance.
The recruitment of top new faculty and

graduate students has been an investment to
maintain the school's and Stanford's preemi
nence. Stanford's excellence can be attributed
in significant measure to excellence in the
School of Humanities and Sciences (H&S),
the core of the University. H&S is responsible
for nearly 80 percent of Stanford's undergrad
uate degrees and leads the way in basic re
search and teaching. We, in H&S, and Stan
ford overall, benefit from the outstanding fac
ulty and graduate students we have recruited
in recent years, and recruitment and graduate
admissions will remain a high priority.
I want to clarify that the school and its de
partments do indeed have financial reserves
and are using them to ameliorate the impact of
budget cuts and unanticipated expenses. This is
precisely what reserves are intended to do: to
see us through difficult times. Our efforts to
bring the budget into balance, including maxi
mizing the use of existing resources and im

proving processes for controlling expenditures,
will help us rebuild reserves and put H&S in an
even stronger financial position for the future.
The measures we are taking now are both
temporary and prudent in light of factors men
tioned in the article. By containing costs
through slowing the school's growth to match
available funding, coupled with efforts to in
crease revenues, we expect to be in balance
within two years and anticipate targeted
growth thereafter. I want to underscore that
the "news" of the deficit is not new: The school
has had a structural deficit fora number of
years. Under the leadership of Dean Sharon
Long in consultation with the University Pres
ident John Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy, effective steps are being taken to
address the issue now and for the future.
