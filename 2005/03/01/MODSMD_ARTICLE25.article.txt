# Albertsons closes, students shrug
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Last week's announcement that
the Albertsons store on Alma Road
near Oregon Expressway will be clos
ing on March 24. created a minor hub
bub in the San Jose Mercury news
and the Palo Alto Weekly, though
few Stanford students seemed to no
tice.
"Where's Alma?" said junior
Robbie Cahill, who rarely shops for
groceries. The staple food items that
he needs he gets from Baja Fresh, he
added.
And junior Corie Oeballe said
when she runs out of snacks she heads
to Safeway, which is open late at night
when many students choose to shop.
"I didn't know [that Albertsons]
existed," she said.
Whole Foods is also a popular des

tination for students looking to stock
up on supplies.
"I always go eat there because
they have sandwiches and sushi." said
sophomore Tess Carton, of Whole
Foods. "The only things I really buy
and keep in my fridge are fruits and
vegetables and cheese. And also be
cause I'm obsessed with hummus and
they have a pretty good hummus se
lection there."
Garton added that Safeway is
often her second choice.
Even the company spokeswoman,
Outen Ha. said that Stanford students
are a rare sight at the Alma Plaza lo
cation.
"There's a couple here," Ha said.
"But not that many."
Alma Plaza is a sad-looking
stretch of suburban sprawl centered
around the Albertsons grocery store,
which fits between an apartment

complex and a small, aging tract of
pastel-colored homes. The store's
17,000 square feet are dwarfed by
most modern supermarkets, which
run closer to 50,000 square feet, ac
cording to Ha. Its smallness has hin
dered its competitiveness.
"Fora number of years we've
been trying to build a bigger store in
the area," Ha said. "But due to some
site constraints, we weren't able to do
that. It's just too small, the plot of land
that it's on."
The Mercury News reported last
week that area residents had vicious
ly battled the store's attempts at ex
pansion. The developers will try to
find a new market to take Albertsons'
spot, possibly a Trader Joe's.
The other stores in the small plaza
— a Chinese restaurant, Fandango's
pizza, Jacquie's Sew & Sew, a shoe re
pair shop — will remain open.

The Albertsons store on Alma Road will close on March 24, but few Stanford students, who prefer the closer Safe
way store on El Camino, seem to notice.
