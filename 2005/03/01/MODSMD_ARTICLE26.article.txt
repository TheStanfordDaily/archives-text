# Syracuse students go abroad to study human sexuality
## 
### KRYSTLE DAVIS DAILY ORANGE 
(U-WIRE) SYRACUSE. N Y. - While the
minds of some Syracuse University students
drift to thoughts of sex and exotic locales
during the humdrum winter months, others
are plotting a continental getaway in which
they experience these adventures firsthand.
The Division of International Programs
Abroad offers SU students the opportunity
to explore human sexuality for two weeks in
London, one in Amsterdam and one in
Stockholm during a summer course from
early June to July. During the course, stu
dents tackle issues such as teen pregnancy,
contraception, abortion, prostitution, homo
sexuality and HIV/AIDS within a global
context.
While many students know about the
popular human sexuality course offered

each semester at SU, fewer students are
aware of the human sexuality course in Eu
rope. Human Sexuality (Child and Family
Studies 388) fills 400 seats in Grant Auditori
um each semester. The class also has the
highest rating on http://su.ratemyelass.com,
a Web site SI J students use to rate classes.
However, student interest for the abroad
course. Child and Family Studies/Women
Studies 400. Human Sexuality in Europe, has
varied over the years.
"(The human sexuality program) used to
enroll about eight to 10 students," said Daisy
Fried, associate director of DIPA. "Last year
we had too few students to run it."
The program began in IW6, and last year
was the first time there were too few appli
cants to have the trip, said Sandra Caron, the
University of Maine professor who teaches
the course in Europe.
"Since we haven't had any applicants yet.

I don't think the prospects for this program
are very good," Fried said. The application
deadline is March 15.
Because DIPA markets its programs na
tionally. the group has been composed of
students from all over the country as well as
SU in the past. Caron said.
A former teaching assistant for CFS 388
had not heard about the summer course.
"I was actually unaware that this course
would be offered abroad." said Lauren Bal
lard, a junior magazine major who spent
three semesters as a human sexuality TA.
Ballard highly recommends CFS 388. in part
because of the teaching style of the profes
sor.
"Dr. Fanelli is a wonderful professor and
he doesn't teach the typical course," Ballard
said. "It revolves around learning about peo
ple, relationships, intimacy and diversity."
One current student enjoys CFS 388, but

thinks the human sexuality course abroad
would be more rewarding.
"The course offers absolutely no cultural or
global perspectives." said Jade Reid, a sopho
more biology major. "I think it would be better
to go abroad so I could see how other countries
look at sexuality," she said.
Another difference between the two cours
es appears to be the level of difficulty. Students
generally tend to regard CFS 388 as a simple
course.
"It's not really a hard course and you
don't have to put much time into it," said
Kafilat Quadri. a sophomore biology major
on a pre-med track.
However. DIPA describes the human
sexuality course in Europe as "academically
rigorous with substantial reading assign
ments and challenging discussions" in its
summer 2(X)5 catalog. Students are required
to complete readings before the course be

gins, complete weekly assignments, pass
exams and write a research paper due in the
fall.
Although the international course may
seem difficult on paper, students who have
taken the class find it relatively simple. The
course is very discussion oriented and in
volves guest speakers, said Anna Floreen. a
senior child and family studies major who
participated in the Europe program in 2003.
"The course abroad focuses more on
health policy, while Dr. Fanelli's course goes
into the emotional side of human sexuality,"
said Margaret Giovannetti, a senior biology
and policy studies major who has taken both
courses. "They take very different approach
es to human sexuality."
In Europe, students meet for class Mon
day through Thursday from 9 a.m. to noon,
and have ample time to explore the cities on
their own.
