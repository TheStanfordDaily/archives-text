## Soto Tape Chronicles Resilient Card get no respect 
### 
I don't like playing the "we don't get no re
spect" game. Players that bemoan their un
derdog status are generally divorced from
the reality that their opponent is better. It is
also an overused sports cliche, like the decep
tively quick white guy whose team never gives
up. takes it one game at a time and shocks the

world.
I would much rather let
the disrespected party
change my mind on the
court. Before you can earn
my respect, you must prove
to me that you are worthy
of it.
That said. 1 think it is
pretty obvious that Stanford
men's basketball gets no re
spect.

We get no respect from the national media
Gods at ESPN.com who fail to write feature
stories about a team that survives on a half
sized roster but oversized heart. It is a classic
"Little Engine that Could" tale that might
have a happy ending or might teach us a les
son in disappointment, but it is a tale worth
telling nonetheless.
We get no respect from Pat Forde, who
picked Lute Olson and Lorenzo Romar to
win the coveted Pac-10 Coach of the Year
award.
Sure, Olson can nuide a cadre of athletic


Jordi Mata-Fink
McDonald's All-Americans to a
top-10 ranking, but you would have
to be Steve Lavin or Henry Bibby to
lose in that situation.
Yes. Romar can meet expecta
tions with a talented and veteran
Washington team, but how does that
demonstrate any coaching acumen?
Where is the mention of Trent
Johnson, who lost three players to
graduation, one to the NBA draft,
two to Walt Harris, two to injuries
and one to academics, and still man
aged to put together a competitive
side in his first season?
We get no respect from the prog
nosticators who dismiss the Pac-10's
high conference RPI and predict
only two, or perhaps three teams to

make the NCAA tournament.
Hopefully UCLA's dismantling of
Notre Dame Sunday afternoon will
help change perceptions, but don't
count on it.
We get no respect from profes
sional bracketologist Joe Lunardi.
who ranks Stanford as a No. K seed
in his most recent bracket. Lunardi
puts us behind the likes of Florida
and Wisconsin and at the same level
as Big East middling Notre Dame
and twice-defeated UCLA.
But worst of all for those of us
fans who watched the Cardinal's
nail-biting victory at McArthur
Court in Eugene on Saturday after
noon. Stanford gets no respect from
the God-awful ABC regional an
nouncers. Dave Pasch and Jimmy
Dykes.
Pasch and Dykes did not have a
good day to begin with. They mis
called fouls and did not offer too
much insightful commentary. Com

ing out of one second-half timeout,
they diagrammed an explanation of
Oregon's previous basket only to
discover, when they rolled the re
play, that what they had previously
called a "perfectly executed back
door screen" was a figment of their
imagination.
But I can deal with mistakes like
that. From my three years of broad
casting soccer for KZSU radio I
know that it's hard to describe fast
paced action on the fly, and I know
what it's like to have an off day.
However, on a nationally televised
broadcast, there is absolutely no ex
cuse for Fasch and Dykes' home
team bias and disrespect of the
Stanford basketball team.
Pasch and Dykes continually
proclaimed that Stanford was
slumping since Dan Grunfeld's in
jury. If they call a 3-1 record - with
the sole loss a one-point defeat at
Oregon State - a slump, then they

have untenably high standards.
Pasch and Dykes announced sev
eral times that Stanford needed to
win out to even hope to claim a tick
et to the Big Dance. This is prepos
terous given Stanford's record.
Even if the Cardinal had lost, a
strong showing against Washington
State and a second-round exit in the
conference tournament would have
been plenty to assure them of a slot
in the final bracket.
And then, as the game wound to
a close and the Cardinal battled
back from eight points down. Pasch
and Dykes went suddenly silent
about Stanford's tenacity on de
fense. After 35 minutes of salivating
over Oregon's freshmen, they were
tongue-tied when it came to de
scribing the veteran leadership
shown by players like Pops and
Matt. And when the final buzzer
sounded, they were as dejected as
the home fans filing out of the Pit.

Unfortunately, our men aren't
the only basketball team on campus
that is woefully underappreciated
by the national experts. Charlie
Creme's most recent women's tour
nament bracket breakdown on
ESPN.com includes the line: "Stan
ford's strength of schedule and
number of high-quality wins aren't
at the level of |Duke and UNC].
Stanford could even win the Pac-10
tournament and slip to a No. 2
seed."
I'm supposed to believe that a
team that held this weekend's oppo
nents to 18 and 14 points at the half,
a team that went on a 43-5 run
against Oregon and more than dou
bled OSU's score, is not worthy of a
top seed?
We get no respect.
Let's go out and prove that we de
serve some.
