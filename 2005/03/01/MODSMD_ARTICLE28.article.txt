## Women take first at MPSFs 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With several powerful sprinters, a core group of top
ranking distance runners and star freshman jumper Erica
McLain. the women's track and field team has enjoyed a
stellar season thus far.
After a dominating regular season, the postseason
began in true Stanford fashion last Friday and Saturday at
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Championships
in Seattle, where the Cardinal women took the team title
for the third straight year.
None of the other 12 MPSF schools came close to the
Cardinal's number of scorers, and the women easily won
the meet with 180.5 points. 86.5 points ahead of second
place finisher UC-Berkeley.
The men boasted a strong distance contingent as well,
although the team was not as well-rounded as the
women's. The men placed second at the M PSFs. 24 points
behind UCLA.
The most impressive event for the Stanford women

was easily Erica McLain's record-breaking triple jump of
45'7 1/4," a mark that automatically qualified her for
NCAAs.
"The women's triple jump is our biggest highlight thus
far — nothing even comes close. Her jump leads the
country by at least 5 or 6 inches," head women's coach
Edrick Floreal said.
The level of competition McLain faced was a letdown.
Her biggest threat was nationally ranked Courtney
Stafford of Cal Poly. Stafford had the next longest jump,
with a mark of 42' 11.5".
Floreal said he was excited about the performance.
"Being a freshman and having that type of perfor
mance at a conference meet is impressive no matter
what," Floreal said.
Sophomore Janice Davis took both the 60 meters and
the 2(X) meters, breaking her previous school record with
a time of 7.31 in the prelims of the 60. Davis ran the 200 in
23.86 seconds in the prelims, a provisional qualifying
Cardinal women dominate

mark lor the N( AAs. She was followed by sophomore
Ashleigh Purnell, who took second in both the 60 and
2(X).
Junior Nashonme Johnson won the 4(X) and senior
Christine Moschella was right behind, finishing second.
The first-place 1600-meter relay team of junior Chinny
Offor, Moschella, Johnson and sophomore Ashley
Freeman finished in 3:38.51.
The distance events were dominated across the
board by the ( ardinal women. Freeman ran a second
place N( "A A provisional time of 2:08.65 in the 800 and
Offor took third behind Freeman. Sophomore Arianna
Lambie blew away the competition with her first-place
4:39.01 mile.
"Arianna Lambie did a fantastic job of commanding
a lead early on in the race," Floreal said.
Promising freshman Lauren Centrowitz placed
fourth in the mile.
Senior Sara Bei won the 3,(XX) meters with a time of
9:13.86. an automatic NCAA qualifying mark. Sopho
more katy Trotter and juniors Alicia Craig and Anita
Siraki came in second, third and fourth, respectively.
Their times were all provisional NCAA marks.
The Distance Medley Relay, or DMR. team did
well, placing first with a time of 11:24.54, but the time
was a far cry from the NCAA automatic qualifying
DMR performance at the Armory Invitational.
Sophomore Amanda Trotter, Johnson, freshman
Lindsay Allen and Siraki comprised the DMR team.
The highlights on the men's side came from a fresh
man and a senior, competing in the shortest and the
longest race of the meet, respectively.
Freshman Wopamo Osaisai broke the school record
yet again with a time of 6.83 in the prelims of the 60-
meter dash. He placed sixth in the finals. Senior lan
Dobson won the S,(XX) meter run in 13:45.54, an auto
matic NCAA mark.

Junior David Vidal fared well in the S,(XX) meters be
hind Dobson. He finished fourth in 14:11.36. qualifying
provisionally.
Senior sprinters C'urtis Goehring and Nick Sebes
placed third and fourth in the 400-meter sprint, respec
tively. Goehring's time was the second-best in school
history.
The 800-meter run was not as successful. Junior
Justin Romaniuk ran a respectable time of 1:52.62, plac
ing fourth to score for the Cardinal men. His time did
not qualify him for the NCAAs.
Redshirt freshman Russel Brown took third in the
mile race with a provisional time of 4:01.98. Sophomore
Joaquin ( liapa finished sixth in 4:03.89, also with a pro
visional time.
Junior Ryan Hall and redshirt freshman Neftalem
Araia finished second and third in the 3000-meter run
with times of 7:56.74 and 7:57.89, respectively. Both
were provisional times.
The men's DMR finished second and the 1,6(X)-
meter relay came in fourth. The 4x400 relay team has
not come close to qualifying for the NCAAs this season
due to a lack of sprinters on the Cardinal men's squad.
The relay team of junior Jeff Conkey, Goehring, Osai
sai and Sebes ran the race in 3:11.03.
The men's DMR. on the other hand, already came
very close to an automatic qualifying mark at the
Arkansas Invitational. This past weekend the relay was
entirely new: Senior Evan Fox, Conkey, Romaniuk,
and redshirt freshman Lauren Jespersen all had a
chance to run the relay. They finished in 9:45.40.
Sophomore Feranmi Okanlami placed fourth in the
triple jump with a jump of 50'0," his best jump this sea
son. Senior Nicholas Taylor finished fourth in the hep
tathlon with 5.104 points. The heptathlon is composed
of seven throwing events. Each is scored individually
based on distance, height and accuracy.

"The women's triple jump is our biggest highlight thus
far — nothing even comes close. Her jump leads the

Her biggest threat was nationally ranked Courtney
Stafford of Cal Poly. Stafford had the next longest jump,
with a mark of 42' 11.5".
Floreal said he was excited about the performance.
"Being a freshman and having that type of perfor
mance at a conference meet is impressive no matter
what," Floreal said.

not come close to qualifying for the NCAAs this season
due to a lack of sprinters on the Cardinal men's squad.
The relay team of junior Jeff Conkey, Goehring, Osai
