### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With several powerful sprinters, a core group of top
ranking distance runners and star freshman jumper Erica
McLain. the women's track and field team has enjoyed a
stellar season thus far.
After a dominating regular season, the postseason
began in true Stanford fashion last Friday and Saturday at
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Championships
in Seattle, where the Cardinal women took the team title
for the third straight year.
None of the other 12 MPSF schools came close to the
Cardinal's number of scorers, and the women easily won
the meet with 180.5 points. 86.5 points ahead of second
place finisher UC-Berkeley.
The men boasted a strong distance contingent as well,
although the team was not as well-rounded as the
women's. The men placed second at the M PSFs. 24 points
behind UCLA.
The most impressive event for the Stanford women

was easily Erica McLain's record-breaking triple jump of
45'7 1/4," a mark that automatically qualified her for
NCAAs.
"The women's triple jump is our biggest highlight thus
far â€” nothing even comes close. Her jump leads the
country by at least 5 or 6 inches," head women's coach
Edrick Floreal said.
The level of competition McLain faced was a letdown.
Her biggest threat was nationally ranked Courtney
Stafford of Cal Poly. Stafford had the next longest jump,
with a mark of 42' 11.5".
Floreal said he was excited about the performance.
"Being a freshman and having that type of perfor
mance at a conference meet is impressive no matter
what," Floreal said.
Sophomore Janice Davis took both the 60 meters and
the 2(X) meters, breaking her previous school record with
a time of 7.31 in the prelims of the 60. Davis ran the 200 in
23.86 seconds in the prelims, a provisional qualifying
