# Cardinal sweep LA schools
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
To say that the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team (10-0,3-0 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) posted two solid, 6-
1.5-2, wins over No. 11 UCLA (5-3,1 -
1 Pac-10) and No. 12 Southern Cali
fornia (6-1, 0-1 Pac-10) this weekend
would be a true statement. And fora
team on a 39-match winning streak, it
might even be something of an expec
tation.
Despite the fact that the Cardinal
handed two top-notch opponents

their first league letdowns of the sea
son, a myriad of close calls turned the
two competitive matches into nail-bit
ing battles of fierce determination
and, at times, frayed nerves.
Before sweeping the UCLA sin
gles lineup on Friday at Taube Family
Tennis, the No. 10 doubles team of
Erin Burdette and Alice Barnes (16-3)
had the doubles point for Stanford
pried from their hands, in a 9-7
tiebreak decision.
Reflective of the hushed lull which
came over fans in the Court 1 grand
stands, Barnes tensely fired a fore

hand shot at 7-all. sending a ball
hurtling into the net and bringing the
Bruins' No. 3 team of Daniela Bercek
and Riza Zalameda (19-3) one step
closer to victory.
The crowd let out a painful sigh as
Burdette made a rare double fault to
put UCLA ahead on the scoreboard,
1-0.
"1 do not think that Alice or 1
played our best doubles against
UCLA, but at the same time we were
right in it until the end." said Burdette,
a senior. "Losing the doubles point
against UCLA was a little bit of a slap
in the face and made us come out rar
ing to go."
Zalameda, a freshman, proved that
a war often waged by those with the
longest limbs and greatest reach can
be equally fought by someone who
stands just 5'4". Demonstrating early
on that giving her a high ball would
only result in an overhead smash for
the Bruins, Barnes and Burdette knew
they had to find other ways to get by.
"Both Alice and I knew going into
the match that Riza was a good dou
bles player and that we should play
more to Bercek in most situations,"
Burdette said.
"Riza made many aggressive
moves up at the net, which added pres
sure to our groundies, returns, and our
first volleys coming in on our own
serves."
The acclaimed duo bounced back
on Saturday, downing the Trojans' top
tandem of Carine Vermeulen and
Nicole Leimbach (5-7), 8-3.
But the test of endurance was far
from over for Burdette, who had an
other tiebreaker waiting for her at No.
2 singles. Lindsey Nelson, a lanky 6-
foot freshman, easily matched Bur
dette in both height and reach. After
trading 7-5 sets, and long after the
match had been decided in Stanford's
favor, Burdette (13-5) and Nelson (18-
5) remained neck-and-neck in serves
and rallies.
