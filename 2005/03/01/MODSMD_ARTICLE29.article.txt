# Cardinal sweep LA schools
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
To say that the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team (10-0,3-0 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) posted two solid, 6-
1.5-2, wins over No. 11 UCLA (5-3,1 -
1 Pac-10) and No. 12 Southern Cali
fornia (6-1, 0-1 Pac-10) this weekend
would be a true statement. And fora
team on a 39-match winning streak, it
might even be something of an expec
tation.
Despite the fact that the Cardinal
handed two top-notch opponents

their first league letdowns of the sea
son, a myriad of close calls turned the
two competitive matches into nail-bit
ing battles of fierce determination
and, at times, frayed nerves.
Before sweeping the UCLA sin
gles lineup on Friday at Taube Family
Tennis, the No. 10 doubles team of
Erin Burdette and Alice Barnes (16-3)
had the doubles point for Stanford
pried from their hands, in a 9-7
tiebreak decision.
Reflective of the hushed lull which
came over fans in the Court 1 grand
stands, Barnes tensely fired a fore

hand shot at 7-all. sending a ball
hurtling into the net and bringing the
Bruins' No. 3 team of Daniela Bercek
and Riza Zalameda (19-3) one step
closer to victory.
The crowd let out a painful sigh as
Burdette made a rare double fault to
put UCLA ahead on the scoreboard,
1-0.
"1 do not think that Alice or 1
played our best doubles against
UCLA, but at the same time we were
right in it until the end." said Burdette,
a senior. "Losing the doubles point
against UCLA was a little bit of a slap
in the face and made us come out rar
ing to go."
Zalameda, a freshman, proved that
a war often waged by those with the
longest limbs and greatest reach can
be equally fought by someone who
stands just 5'4". Demonstrating early
on that giving her a high ball would
only result in an overhead smash for
the Bruins, Barnes and Burdette knew
they had to find other ways to get by.
"Both Alice and I knew going into
the match that Riza was a good dou
bles player and that we should play
more to Bercek in most situations,"
Burdette said.
"Riza made many aggressive
moves up at the net, which added pres
sure to our groundies, returns, and our
first volleys coming in on our own
serves."
The acclaimed duo bounced back
on Saturday, downing the Trojans' top
tandem of Carine Vermeulen and
Nicole Leimbach (5-7), 8-3.
But the test of endurance was far
from over for Burdette, who had an
other tiebreaker waiting for her at No.
2 singles. Lindsey Nelson, a lanky 6-
foot freshman, easily matched Bur
dette in both height and reach. After
trading 7-5 sets, and long after the
match had been decided in Stanford's
favor, Burdette (13-5) and Nelson (18-
5) remained neck-and-neck in serves
and rallies.

son's favor at 7-8, Burdette launched a
kick second serve to try to force an
other point, hut instead gave Nelson
ample time to set up and execute a
backhand winner.
As the players shook hands and
gathered up their equipment, one sat
isfied and the other still reeling, exit
ing spectators were left questioning
how it must feel to have a day's work
boil down to a handful of points.
And to those still wondering: This
is the where the tireless Cardinal spir
it shines through, brighter than ever.
"Knowing that the match was de
cided [while I was still playing] was a
little bit of a relief." Burdette said.
"But I was fighting as hard as I could,
not only for myself but because 6-1
sounds much more convincing than 5-
2 to me. 1 enjoy being the last match
out there, and both teams are lined up
cheering for one another. Even
though the match was already decid
ed. it was very exciting."
Freshmen Whitney Deason and
Lejla Hodzic showed their moxie in
the No. 3 doubles slot. After falling 9-
7 to the Bruins' unranked team of
Sarah Gregg and Tracy Lin (9-3), the
two Cardinal recovered a 4-7 deficit
against the Trojans to claim a 9-7 win
of their own.
Deason and Hodzic improve to 13-
4 after snapping Dianne Matias and
Judy DeVera's six-match win streak.
Matias and DeVera hold at 11-4.
In singles. No. 28 Amber Liu (8-0),
a junior, remained undefeated in the
top position. Liu pulled out a three-set
win. 2-6, 6-1. 6-1 against the Bruins'
No. 30 Bercek (7-7) and overpowered
the Trojans' No. 9 Leimbach (19-6), 6-
2,6-2.
"1 wasn't getting down and bend
ing on my shots, so I think that really
affected my first set," Liu said of first
set inconsistencies against UCLA. "1
just didn't get it together until my sec
ond set. It was just about getting my
game in and settling down."
In the spirit of tiebreaks, sopho
more Theresa Logar (14-1) survived
two of them in the No. 3 and No. 4 sin
gles slots. At No. 4 against UCLA,
Logar quickly defeated Lin, 5-7,6-1.1-
0(2) after letting the first set slide.
Barnes, a junior, sat out her singles
match on Saturday, allowing Logar to
move up and face off against No. 88
Anca Anastasiu. Logar pulled out an
other win. 6-2.7-6(5).
Logar displayed growing versatility,
making few unforced errors against
two players who engaged her in long
rallies. Lin relied on heavy topspin in
an attempt to pin Logar at the baseline,
while Anastasiu made more flat drives
that kept Logar setting up shots early.
"I think these matches have given
this team a lot of confidence," Liu
said. "We all have a lot of confidence
in each other. So we know that if one
of us has a bad day. everyone else can
pull out (the match]."

Freshmen Whitney Deason and
Lejla Hodzic showed their moxie in
the No. 3 doubles slot. After falling 9-
7 to the Bruins' unranked team of
Sarah Gregg and Tracy Lin (9-3), the
two Cardinal recovered a 4-7 deficit
against the Trojans to claim a 9-7 win
of their own.
Deason and Hodzic improve to 13-

Judy DeVera's six-match win streak.
Matias and DeVera hold at 11-4.
In singles. No. 28 Amber Liu (8-0),
a junior, remained undefeated in the
top position. Liu pulled out a three-set
win. 2-6, 6-1. 6-1 against the Bruins'
No. 30 Bercek (7-7) and overpowered
the Trojans' No. 9 Leimbach (19-6), 6-
2,6-2.
"1 wasn't getting down and bend
ing on my shots, so I think that really
affected my first set," Liu said of first
set inconsistencies against UCLA. "1
just didn't get it together until my sec
ond set. It was just about getting my
game in and settling down."
In the spirit of tiebreaks, sopho
more Theresa Logar (14-1) survived
two of them in the No. 3 and No. 4 sin
gles slots. At No. 4 against UCLA,
Logar quickly defeated Lin, 5-7,6-1.1-
0(2) after letting the first set slide.
Barnes, a junior, sat out her singles
match on Saturday, allowing Logar to
move up and face off against No. 88
Anca Anastasiu. Logar pulled out an
other win. 6-2.7-6(5).
Logar displayed growing versatility,
making few unforced errors against
two players who engaged her in long
rallies. Lin relied on heavy topspin in
an attempt to pin Logar at the baseline,
while Anastasiu made more flat drives
that kept Logar setting up shots early.
"I think these matches have given
this team a lot of confidence," Liu
said. "We all have a lot of confidence
in each other. So we know that if one
of us has a bad day. everyone else can
pull out (the match]."
The undefeated Cardinal heads to
Arizona this weekend, taking on No.

To say that the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team (10-0,3-0 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) posted two solid, 6-
1.5-2, wins over No. 11 UCLA (5-3,1 -
1 Pac-10) and No. 12 Southern Cali
fornia (6-1, 0-1 Pac-10) this weekend
would be a true statement. And fora
team on a 39-match winning streak, it
might even be something of an expec
tation.
Despite the fact that the Cardinal
handed two top-notch opponents

their first league letdowns of the sea
son, a myriad of close calls turned the
two competitive matches into nail-bit
ing battles of fierce determination
and, at times, frayed nerves.
Before sweeping the UCLA sin
gles lineup on Friday at Taube Family
Tennis, the No. 10 doubles team of
Erin Burdette and Alice Barnes (16-3)
had the doubles point for Stanford
pried from their hands, in a 9-7
tiebreak decision.
Reflective of the hushed lull which
came over fans in the Court 1 grand
stands, Barnes tensely fired a fore

hand shot at 7-all. sending a ball
hurtling into the net and bringing the
Bruins' No. 3 team of Daniela Bercek
and Riza Zalameda (19-3) one step
closer to victory.
The crowd let out a painful sigh as
Burdette made a rare double fault to
put UCLA ahead on the scoreboard,
1-0.
"1 do not think that Alice or 1
played our best doubles against
UCLA, but at the same time we were
right in it until the end." said Burdette,
a senior. "Losing the doubles point
against UCLA was a little bit of a slap
in the face and made us come out rar
ing to go."
Zalameda, a freshman, proved that
a war often waged by those with the
longest limbs and greatest reach can
be equally fought by someone who
stands just 5'4". Demonstrating early
on that giving her a high ball would
only result in an overhead smash for
the Bruins, Barnes and Burdette knew
they had to find other ways to get by.
"Both Alice and I knew going into
the match that Riza was a good dou
bles player and that we should play
more to Bercek in most situations,"
Burdette said.
"Riza made many aggressive
moves up at the net, which added pres
sure to our groundies, returns, and our
first volleys coming in on our own
serves."
The acclaimed duo bounced back
on Saturday, downing the Trojans' top
tandem of Carine Vermeulen and
Nicole Leimbach (5-7), 8-3.
But the test of endurance was far
from over for Burdette, who had an
other tiebreaker waiting for her at No.
2 singles. Lindsey Nelson, a lanky 6-
foot freshman, easily matched Bur
dette in both height and reach. After
trading 7-5 sets, and long after the
match had been decided in Stanford's
favor, Burdette (13-5) and Nelson (18-
5) remained neck-and-neck in serves
and rallies.

son's favor at 7-8, Burdette launched a
kick second serve to try to force an
other point, hut instead gave Nelson
ample time to set up and execute a
backhand winner.
As the players shook hands and
gathered up their equipment, one sat
isfied and the other still reeling, exit
ing spectators were left questioning
how it must feel to have a day's work
boil down to a handful of points.
And to those still wondering: This
is the where the tireless Cardinal spir
it shines through, brighter than ever.
"Knowing that the match was de
cided [while I was still playing] was a
little bit of a relief." Burdette said.
"But I was fighting as hard as I could,
not only for myself but because 6-1
sounds much more convincing than 5-
2 to me. 1 enjoy being the last match
out there, and both teams are lined up
cheering for one another. Even
