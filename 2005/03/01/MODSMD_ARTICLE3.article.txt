# Emergency phone towers give some students the blues
## 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Due to Stanford's image as a relatively safe cam
pus, many students have begun to ignore the blue-light
emergency towers, and others said they are unsure of
how they work. Intended to be used only by people in
unsafe situations, the towers serve as telephones that
automatically dial a 911 dispatcher when the promi
nent red button is hit.
Yet despite their strategic placement on campus,
not everyone is comforted by the blue lights' presence.
Senior Candace Lewis remains skeptical of what good
these towers can actually do in an emergency.
"I'm more wary around the periphery of campus."
Lewis said. "I don't trust the blue lights as much be
cause when I lived on the west end of campus, the one
by FroSoCo was always out of order. Hopefully I'll
never have to use one."
According to Sgt. Del Bandy of the Stanford Police
Department, a blue light tower will emit strobe lights
when the red button is hit. in order to scare away po
tential predators.
Since the University already has a relatively low
Few use blue towers

crime rate compared to many other
schools, students said the blue tow
ers do not factor into how secure
they feel walking on campus after
dark.
"I always feel safe around cam
pus," said sophomore Ann Walker.
"But 1 don't feel that [the blue lights)
add anything to how secure I feel."
There are 96 towers currently
on campus, but nearly a fifth of
them are located in the under
ground parking structure on Pas
teur Drive in front of the Stanford
Medical Center.
At UC Berkeley, there are 43 spe
cialty emergency telephones similar
to the blue towers, plus another 400
campus telephones that can be used
for emergency purposes.
Though an editorial that ap
peared in The Daily on Feb. IS crit
icized the number and placement
of the towers, there is no set formu
la for how far apart the towers must
be from one another, and despite
popular belief, the University has
never attempted to place the tow
ers within sight of one another.
Bandy said.
Even so, the Stanford Depart
ment of Public Safety tried to put
them in appropriate places, accord
ing to Bandy.
" They have been placed along
primary pedestrian and bicycle
routes into and around campus,"
Bandy said. "When possible, we
placed towers where travel routes in
tersect and/or where there were
good sight lines. During our initial
setting process, we used a 4-part test
which included lighting, sight lines,
landscape characteristics and the
ambient population."
Bandy said that one major prob
lem is that the towers? electronic
components are constantly exposed
to rain and moisture, which cause
most malfunctions.
However, according to Universi
ty Chief of Police Laura Wilson, stu
dents? perception that the towers
are frequently broken is inaccurate
and they are checked and main
tained habitually.
"We regularly inspect and check

the function of each tower." Bandy
said. "Communications Services
does phone-related repairs. Facility
Operations does electrical and struc
tural repairs. The [Department of
Public Safety?s] inspection program
is conducted bi-weekly and includes
an eight-step test of all functions of
each tower."
According to Bandy, the towers
were installed between 1997 and
1999 after a student survey demon
strated concern about personal safe
ty around campus. However, the
campus has grown in size over the
past five years.
"Since the implementation, the
campus has grown into areas that
were not included in the original
plans, most noticeably on the west
side of campus toward Sand Hill
Road," Bandy said. "There are a few
other in-fill locations where mem
bers of the public have asked for tow
ers. As of now. a formal proposal re
questing funding has not been devel
oped for additional installations."
Meanwhile. Bandy said that po
lice respond to five to 10 towers per
week, but most calls prove not to be
emergencies.
"We probably handle two to
three emergency calls per month,"
Bandy said. "Most of these are re
porting a collision or other medical
emergencies. The towers have been
used to report a few suspicious vehi
cles and persons and a couple do
mestic violence situations."
For the most part, however, stu
dents said they feel safe when walk
ing alone on campus and the pres
ence of the emergency towers goes
largely unnoticed.
"1 don't think about the blue
lights much," senior Emily Ochoa
said. "However. 1 hope that if 1 need
ed to use one, it will be there."
In addition to the blue lights, the
5-SURE escort service is available to
students who do not feel safe walk
ing alone at night and the Depart
ment of Public Safety produces a
"Suggested Travel Routes" map for
the campus, instructing students
which paths to take for maximum
safety.

"But 1 don't feel that [the blue lights)
add anything to how secure I feel."
There are 96 towers currently
on campus, but nearly a fifth of
them are located in the under
ground parking structure on Pas
teur Drive in front of the Stanford
Medical Center.
At UC Berkeley, there are 43 spe
cialty emergency telephones similar
to the blue towers, plus another 400
campus telephones that can be used
for emergency purposes.
Though an editorial that ap
peared in The Daily on Feb. IS crit
icized the number and placement
of the towers, there is no set formu
la for how far apart the towers must
be from one another, and despite
popular belief, the University has
never attempted to place the tow
ers within sight of one another.
Bandy said.
Even so, the Stanford Depart
ment of Public Safety tried to put
them in appropriate places, accord
ing to Bandy.
" They have been placed along
primary pedestrian and bicycle
routes into and around campus,"
Bandy said. "When possible, we
placed towers where travel routes in
tersect and/or where there were
good sight lines. During our initial
setting process, we used a 4-part test
which included lighting, sight lines,
landscape characteristics and the
ambient population."
Bandy said that one major prob
lem is that the towers? electronic
components are constantly exposed
to rain and moisture, which cause
most malfunctions.
However, according to Universi
ty Chief of Police Laura Wilson, stu
dents? perception that the towers
are frequently broken is inaccurate
and they are checked and main
tained habitually.
"We regularly inspect and check

the function of each tower." Bandy
said. "Communications Services
does phone-related repairs. Facility
Operations does electrical and struc
tural repairs. The [Department of
Public Safety?s] inspection program
is conducted bi-weekly and includes
an eight-step test of all functions of
each tower."
According to Bandy, the towers
were installed between 1997 and
1999 after a student survey demon
strated concern about personal safe
ty around campus. However, the
campus has grown in size over the
past five years.
"Since the implementation, the
campus has grown into areas that
were not included in the original
plans, most noticeably on the west
side of campus toward Sand Hill
Road," Bandy said. "There are a few
other in-fill locations where mem
bers of the public have asked for tow
ers. As of now. a formal proposal re
questing funding has not been devel
oped for additional installations."
Meanwhile. Bandy said that po
lice respond to five to 10 towers per
week, but most calls prove not to be
emergencies.
"We probably handle two to
three emergency calls per month,"
Bandy said. "Most of these are re
porting a collision or other medical
emergencies. The towers have been
used to report a few suspicious vehi
cles and persons and a couple do
mestic violence situations."
For the most part, however, stu
dents said they feel safe when walk
ing alone on campus and the pres
ence of the emergency towers goes
largely unnoticed.
"1 don't think about the blue
lights much," senior Emily Ochoa
said. "However. 1 hope that if 1 need
ed to use one, it will be there."
In addition to the blue lights, the
5-SURE escort service is available to
students who do not feel safe walk
ing alone at night and the Depart
ment of Public Safety produces a
"Suggested Travel Routes" map for
the campus, instructing students
which paths to take for maximum
safety.

The blue emergency towers are placed in high-risk areas to give students
greater safety, but the sheer expanse of campus dilutes their effect.
Due to Stanford's image as a relatively safe cam
pus, many students have begun to ignore the blue-light
emergency towers, and others said they are unsure of
how they work. Intended to be used only by people in
unsafe situations, the towers serve as telephones that
automatically dial a 911 dispatcher when the promi
nent red button is hit.
Yet despite their strategic placement on campus,
not everyone is comforted by the blue lights' presence.
Senior Candace Lewis remains skeptical of what good
these towers can actually do in an emergency.
"I'm more wary around the periphery of campus."
Lewis said. "I don't trust the blue lights as much be
cause when I lived on the west end of campus, the one
by FroSoCo was always out of order. Hopefully I'll
never have to use one."
According to Sgt. Del Bandy of the Stanford Police
Department, a blue light tower will emit strobe lights
when the red button is hit. in order to scare away po
tential predators.
Since the University already has a relatively low
Few use blue towers

crime rate compared to many other
schools, students said the blue tow
ers do not factor into how secure
they feel walking on campus after
dark.

pus," said sophomore Ann Walker.
