# Gymnasts down Devils

### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
They got knocked down, but they got up
again.
After a disappointing performance on
balance beam that lost them the meet last
weekend against No. 2 UCLA, the Cardinal
(2-4, 2-3 Pacific-10 Conference) bounced
back Friday night to nab their second home
victory against No. 21 Arizona State, 195.30
to 191.575.
Although beam was still Stanford's low
est scoring event of the evening, it was
enough to outdo the Sun Devils and it was a
considerable improvement from last week
end. The team scored nearly a full point
higher, posting a 48.425. and each individual
gymnast improved her score on the event.
The improvement came despite the fact
that last weekend's top beam scorer, junior
Glyn Sweets, was out with a fractured
metatarsal. Sophomore Stacy Sprando also
took a nasty fall on a front aerial, a no-hand
ed front handspring, early in the lineup. An
early fall can often shake up the team and
cause more mistakes down the line. Al
though that domino effect occurred at last
weekend's meet, the team avoided a repeat
occurrence this Friday.
Freshman Alex Pintchouk and junior
captain Natalie Foley fought to stay on de
spite a couple wobbles and scored a 9.55 and
a 9.625, respectively. Freshman Stephanie
Gentry followed and won the event with a
9.80. Since Gentry took a step on her land
ing, which cost her about one or two tenths,
her score reflected a near perfect routine
aside from the landing.
Perhaps most impressive, however, was

the strong performance by Stanford's un
likely anchor, freshman Aimee Precourt.
Precourt has only competed for Stanford
once or twice on beam and those routines
were exhibitions, meaning that they did not
count toward the Cardinal's score. Friday
night's routine had also been scheduled as an
exhibition.
When freshman Tabitha Yim stepped out
of the beam lineup due to a sore Achilles'
tendon before the meet, however, Precourt
had to step in. She moved right into the an
chor spot that is usually filled by the team's
best beam worker.
Although a few minor wobbles revealed
just how nervous she was, Precourt handled
the pressure well. She nailed her back hand
spring, layout step-out series and stuck her
landing to score a 9.725 to tie for third place
on the event with fellow freshman Lauren
Elmore.
"Aimee's routine was a highlight of the
meet for me," head coach Kristen Smyth
said. "It was her first time in a pressure situ
ation and she performed beautifully. She
was really solid and confident in that last
spot and that is not easy to do, especially
when the team had a big fall early on. The
whole beam team stepped up after the fall
which showed great progress."
The team focused on beam in practice last
week, devoting Wednesday's workout to the
event. The Cardinal will continue to focus on
beam this week.
"In my opinion, beam is really the event
that we need to perform at a higher level
on," Smyth said. "We need to train more
consistently and intensely at practice. If we
