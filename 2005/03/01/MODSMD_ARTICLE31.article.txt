And they're back in the game.
The No. 18 Stanford men's tennis

team," junior KC Corkery said.
"They did exceptionally well, and
they played really well together. It
was nice winning both doubles point

both very tough teams, and that's a
tough place to play."

changed, the No. 2 pairing of senior
Sam Warburg and Corkery re
mained the same and were two-for

jamin Kohlloeffel and Luben Pam
poulov, 9-7.
