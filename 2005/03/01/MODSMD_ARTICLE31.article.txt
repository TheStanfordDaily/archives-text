# Men earn split in LA
## Tennis defeats SC, 5-2 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
And they're back in the game.
The No. 18 Stanford men's tennis
team (7-4) snapped its four-match
losing streak this weekend as it trav
eled to Los Angeles, Calif, to take on
Pac-10 rivals No. 4 UCLA and No.
11 use.
The Cardinal were edged out by
the Bruins on Friday, 4-3, but
bounced back to defeat USC deci
sively. 5-2, and to avenge last week's
narrow loss to the Trojans at the Na
tional Indoor Championship.
Stanford's doubles lineup saw a
little bit of change this weekend as
the 2nd and 3rd duos were altered.
The new pairs worked effectively,
and the Cardinal claimed the dou
bles point in both matches despite
having lost it in the previous three
matches.
"1 think we have to be pleased
with how the doubles lineup went for
us, especially the No. 3 doubles
team," junior KC Corkery said.
"They did exceptionally well, and
they played really well together. It
was nice winning both doubles point
down at UCLA and USC; they're
both very tough teams, and that's a
tough place to play."
While some of the doubles teams
changed, the No. 2 pairing of senior
Sam Warburg and Corkery re
mained the same and were two-for
two this weekend. Against UCLA,
the tandem defeated No. 44 Ben
jamin Kohlloeffel and Luben Pam
poulov, 9-7.
Last week in Chicago, Stanford's
defending NCAA champions were

Sophomores James Wan and Eric McKean clinched the doubles point with
a win in the No. 3 position, defeating Adam Loucks and Brian Wright.
the only pair to win their doubles
match against USC. On Saturday,
the Trojans tried their luck against
Warburg and Corkcry with a differ
ent pair, this time Jamir Al-Agba
and Johan Berg, and were dealt yet
another defeat.
The new pairing at the second
doubles position consisted of se
nior Phil Sheng and freshman Phil
Kao. The team lost both of their
matches this weekend. 8-5, but
gained some valuable experience
playing together.
"At No. 2. those guys really
haven't played much together."
Corkery said. "Also. Phil Kao hasn't
played a ton of doubles, so I think if
they get a chance to play together a
little bit more, they'll play even bet
ter."
Playing at the third doubles posi
tion were sophomores Eric McKean
and James Wan. The pair won an 8-
3 victory against the Bruins to help
the Cardinal clinch the doubles
point. Against the Trojans. Wan and
McKean faced the duo of Brian
Wright and Adam Loucks again; just
last week. Wan and junior Jon Wong
suffered an 8-3 defeat to the pair.
However, this time, McKean and
Wan overcame the USC team 8-6 to
help Stanford claim the doubles
point for the second consecutive
match.
"I was pretty happy because 1
guess the whole goal is to come out
with the doubles point," Wan said.
"It was the first time I ever played
with Eric so it was a little hard, but 1
think it worked out really well."
While the Cardinal started off
well against the Bruins, UCLA re
covered quickly and showed why
they have yet to lose more than one
match this season by dominating sin
gles play. Only No. 6 Warburg and
Wan were able to walk away with in
dividual wins at the top and fourth
singles positions, respectively, with

Wan's coming in split sets against
Bruin Chris Lam. In 2004, Lam was
Wan's only loss in the dual match
season.
"I lost to him last year in the
match against UCLA, so I wanted to
win against him this time really bad."
Wan said. "There was rain delay at
the end of the second set. and he
hadn't finished the set. That's a pret
ty big psychological disadvantage
when you actually don't finish the
set. But, in the third set. I just tried to
play my game and see where things
took me."
Corkery was dealt his first loss
of the season. Sheng suffered a
three-set defeat and Kao and Wong
lost in straight sets at the final two
positions.
"Obviously I was not pleased
with how that one turned out. espe
cially after taking the doubles
point," Corkery said. "I just got de
stroyed, but I felt like 1 should have
won that match. I'm looking forward
to getting another chance when they
come back up here in April. That
UCLA match definitely bothers me.
Hopefully it was just a one-time
thing. Hopefully it won't happen
again."
Head coach John Whitlinger
feels that the team will get better and
better with every match, whether
the team tallies a win or a loss.
" Three of the four matches we
lost, we got beat up pretty good,"
Whitlinger said. "They're good
players down [at UCLA]; they have
that potential of beating some of
our guys like that. I think the guys,
they're getting experience every
time they play. They're going to get
better and better, and they may get
beat a little bit but they're getting
better. Overall, we were pleased,
coming out of the UCLA match;
they're one of the top teams in the
country and a very, very talented
team. We all felt we were right
there again, so we need to keep
working hard and keep trying to get
a little better every day."
The following day at Marks Ten
nis Stadium, Warburg and Wan
were able to pull repeats of the pre

vious day's singles victories; in addi
tion to their two matches, Corkery
and Kao tallied straight-set wins as
well. Sheng was handed another
three-set defeat and McKean suf
fered a close. 7-6,7-6 loss.
"It was nice to finally set up a
win [against USC]," Corkery said,
"(and) somewhat of a convincing
win at that. We won the doubles
point, we won easily on four of the
singles matches, and we had
chances in the other two matches.
And we could have done even bet
ter- we had a three setter and a
match that went to two tie-breaks. I
was extremely disappointed with
my performance at UCLA, but 1
was glad I was able to rebound
against USC and pick up a win
there. We had good energy down
there; hopefully, we can build off
that, and keep going throughout
the rest of the season."
Whitlinger also felt that the win
against the Trojans was telling.
"1 think the guys played out
standing in (against USC]," he
said. "I think when we left Chica
go, we felt we should and could
have won that match but we didn't.
We came out and won the doubles
point [on Saturday], which felt
pretty good, but the guys still had
to get out there and get the job
done. We won five out of six first
sets. The guys really played well,
they started well and they didn't let
the crowd affect them. I was really
proud of them."
The Cardinal return to Taube
Tennis Stadium Wednesday to take
on No. 64 William and Mary.
"I've known [Tribe coach] Peter
Daub fora long time, and he's a
good coach," Whitlinger said.
"He'll have those guys ready. I just
don't want our guys to overlook this
match; if they do, it will be a dog
fight. I want to make sure they're
ready to play. Sometimes after you
go down to La or play a couple big
matches, you take a deep breath
we can't take a deep breath right
now. we've got to be ready to play
on Wednesday. If not. we'll be in
trouble."

go down to La or play a couple big
matches, you take a deep breath
we can't take a deep breath right
now. we've got to be ready to play
on Wednesday. If not. we'll be in
trouble."
And they're back in the game.
The No. 18 Stanford men's tennis
team (7-4) snapped its four-match
losing streak this weekend as it trav
eled to Los Angeles, Calif, to take on
Pac-10 rivals No. 4 UCLA and No.
11 use.
The Cardinal were edged out by
the Bruins on Friday, 4-3, but
bounced back to defeat USC deci
sively. 5-2, and to avenge last week's
narrow loss to the Trojans at the Na
tional Indoor Championship.
Stanford's doubles lineup saw a
little bit of change this weekend as
the 2nd and 3rd duos were altered.
The new pairs worked effectively,
and the Cardinal claimed the dou
bles point in both matches despite
having lost it in the previous three
matches.
"1 think we have to be pleased
with how the doubles lineup went for
us, especially the No. 3 doubles
team," junior KC Corkery said.
"They did exceptionally well, and
they played really well together. It
was nice winning both doubles point
down at UCLA and USC; they're
both very tough teams, and that's a
tough place to play."
While some of the doubles teams
changed, the No. 2 pairing of senior
Sam Warburg and Corkery re
mained the same and were two-for
two this weekend. Against UCLA,
the tandem defeated No. 44 Ben
jamin Kohlloeffel and Luben Pam
poulov, 9-7.
Last week in Chicago, Stanford's
defending NCAA champions were

Sophomores James Wan and Eric McKean clinched the doubles point with
a win in the No. 3 position, defeating Adam Loucks and Brian Wright.
the only pair to win their doubles
match against USC. On Saturday,
the Trojans tried their luck against
Warburg and Corkcry with a differ
ent pair, this time Jamir Al-Agba
and Johan Berg, and were dealt yet
another defeat.
The new pairing at the second
doubles position consisted of se
nior Phil Sheng and freshman Phil
Kao. The team lost both of their
matches this weekend. 8-5, but
gained some valuable experience
playing together.
"At No. 2. those guys really
haven't played much together."
Corkery said. "Also. Phil Kao hasn't
played a ton of doubles, so I think if
they get a chance to play together a
little bit more, they'll play even bet
ter."
Playing at the third doubles posi
tion were sophomores Eric McKean
and James Wan. The pair won an 8-
3 victory against the Bruins to help
the Cardinal clinch the doubles
point. Against the Trojans. Wan and
McKean faced the duo of Brian
Wright and Adam Loucks again; just
last week. Wan and junior Jon Wong
suffered an 8-3 defeat to the pair.
However, this time, McKean and
Wan overcame the USC team 8-6 to
help Stanford claim the doubles
point for the second consecutive
match.
"I was pretty happy because 1
guess the whole goal is to come out
with the doubles point," Wan said.
"It was the first time I ever played
with Eric so it was a little hard, but 1
think it worked out really well."
While the Cardinal started off
well against the Bruins, UCLA re
covered quickly and showed why
they have yet to lose more than one
match this season by dominating sin
gles play. Only No. 6 Warburg and
Wan were able to walk away with in
dividual wins at the top and fourth
singles positions, respectively, with

Wan's coming in split sets against
Bruin Chris Lam. In 2004, Lam was
Wan's only loss in the dual match
season.
"I lost to him last year in the
match against UCLA, so I wanted to
win against him this time really bad."
Wan said. "There was rain delay at
the end of the second set. and he
hadn't finished the set. That's a pret
ty big psychological disadvantage
when you actually don't finish the
set. But, in the third set. I just tried to
play my game and see where things
took me."
Corkery was dealt his first loss
of the season. Sheng suffered a
three-set defeat and Kao and Wong
lost in straight sets at the final two
positions.
"Obviously I was not pleased
with how that one turned out. espe
cially after taking the doubles
point," Corkery said. "I just got de
stroyed, but I felt like 1 should have
won that match. I'm looking forward
to getting another chance when they
come back up here in April. That
UCLA match definitely bothers me.
Hopefully it was just a one-time
thing. Hopefully it won't happen
again."
Head coach John Whitlinger
feels that the team will get better and
better with every match, whether
the team tallies a win or a loss.
" Three of the four matches we
lost, we got beat up pretty good,"
Whitlinger said. "They're good
players down [at UCLA]; they have
that potential of beating some of
our guys like that. I think the guys,
they're getting experience every
time they play. They're going to get
better and better, and they may get
beat a little bit but they're getting
better. Overall, we were pleased,
coming out of the UCLA match;
they're one of the top teams in the
country and a very, very talented
team. We all felt we were right
there again, so we need to keep
working hard and keep trying to get
a little better every day."
The following day at Marks Ten
nis Stadium, Warburg and Wan
were able to pull repeats of the pre

vious day's singles victories; in addi
tion to their two matches, Corkery
and Kao tallied straight-set wins as
well. Sheng was handed another
three-set defeat and McKean suf
fered a close. 7-6,7-6 loss.
"It was nice to finally set up a
win [against USC]," Corkery said,
"(and) somewhat of a convincing
win at that. We won the doubles
point, we won easily on four of the
singles matches, and we had
chances in the other two matches.
And we could have done even bet
ter- we had a three setter and a
match that went to two tie-breaks. I
was extremely disappointed with
my performance at UCLA, but 1
was glad I was able to rebound
against USC and pick up a win
there. We had good energy down
there; hopefully, we can build off
that, and keep going throughout
the rest of the season."
Whitlinger also felt that the win
against the Trojans was telling.
"1 think the guys played out
standing in (against USC]," he
said. "I think when we left Chica
go, we felt we should and could
have won that match but we didn't.
We came out and won the doubles
point [on Saturday], which felt
pretty good, but the guys still had
to get out there and get the job
done. We won five out of six first
sets. The guys really played well,
they started well and they didn't let
the crowd affect them. I was really
proud of them."
The Cardinal return to Taube
Tennis Stadium Wednesday to take
on No. 64 William and Mary.
"I've known [Tribe coach] Peter
Daub fora long time, and he's a
good coach," Whitlinger said.
"He'll have those guys ready. I just
don't want our guys to overlook this
match; if they do, it will be a dog
fight. I want to make sure they're
ready to play. Sometimes after you
go down to La or play a couple big

"He'll have those guys ready. I just
don't want our guys to overlook this
match; if they do, it will be a dog
fight. I want to make sure they're
ready to play. Sometimes after you
go down to La or play a couple big
matches, you take a deep breath
we can't take a deep breath right
now. we've got to be ready to play
on Wednesday. If not. we'll be in
trouble."
