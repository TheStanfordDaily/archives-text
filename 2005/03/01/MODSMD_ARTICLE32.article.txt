# Water polo settles for third
## 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
Competing this weekend in the 2(X)5 Daktronics Gau
cho Invitational, the women's water polo team (9-2, 2-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) took a test. It was a
test that consisted of five parts — some more challenging
than others — over the course of the tournament's three
days. But unfortunately for the Cardinal, there was no
partial credit.
The Cardinal concluded by posting a 5-3 victory over
No. 4 Long Beach State to take third place in the tourna
ment. hosted by UC-Santa Barbara. But had it not been
fora subpar second half in their semifinal match against
No. 2 USC the day before, the Cardinal might have

the tournament championship.
"Basically what it came down to was that we had four
and a half great, solid games this weekend," junior driv
er Laurel Champion said. "We didn't stick to our sys

of that, we became vulnerable in places we are normal
ly nails in."

The Cardinal opened their match against the 2(X)4 na
tional champion Women of Troy in commanding fash

play on the strength of goals from Champion and sopho
more Alison Gregorka.
USC took a 4-3 lead by converting a six-on-five ad
vantage with 1:11 remaining in the half and that narrow
margin became an insurmountable deficit for the Cardi
nal. The Trojans notched two more unanswered goals en
route to a 9-4 win.
"Our game against USC was disappointing to say the
least, as it was close up to halftime," said senior captain
Hannah Luber. "But then we began to lose the six-on
five/'five-on-six battle with them, something that wins or
loses games for teams."
But aside from their loss to USC, the Cardinal's per
formance at the Gaucho Invitational was highly encour
aging.
Friday's action saw the Stanford offense explode for
28 goals over the course of only two games, both of
which the Cardinal won handily. Dismantling unranked
