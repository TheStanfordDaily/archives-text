# Water polo settles for third
## 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
Competing this weekend in the 2(X)5 Daktronics Gau
cho Invitational, the women's water polo team (9-2, 2-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) took a test. It was a
test that consisted of five parts — some more challenging
than others — over the course of the tournament's three
days. But unfortunately for the Cardinal, there was no
partial credit.
The Cardinal concluded by posting a 5-3 victory over
No. 4 Long Beach State to take third place in the tourna
ment. hosted by UC-Santa Barbara. But had it not been
fora subpar second half in their semifinal match against
No. 2 USC the day before, the Cardinal might have
found themselves squaring off against No. 1 UCLA for
the tournament championship.
"Basically what it came down to was that we had four
and a half great, solid games this weekend," junior driv
er Laurel Champion said. "We didn't stick to our sys
tem for the second half of the USC game, and because
of that, we became vulnerable in places we are normal
ly nails in."

The Cardinal opened their match against the 2(X)4 na
tional champion Women of Troy in commanding fash
ion. building a 2-0 lead within the first three minutes of
play on the strength of goals from Champion and sopho
more Alison Gregorka.
USC took a 4-3 lead by converting a six-on-five ad
vantage with 1:11 remaining in the half and that narrow
margin became an insurmountable deficit for the Cardi
nal. The Trojans notched two more unanswered goals en
route to a 9-4 win.
"Our game against USC was disappointing to say the
least, as it was close up to halftime," said senior captain
Hannah Luber. "But then we began to lose the six-on
five/'five-on-six battle with them, something that wins or
loses games for teams."
But aside from their loss to USC, the Cardinal's per
formance at the Gaucho Invitational was highly encour
aging.
Friday's action saw the Stanford offense explode for
28 goals over the course of only two games, both of
which the Cardinal won handily. Dismantling unranked
Card defeat No. 4 Long Beach

Pacific 17-5 in their tournament
opener, the Cardinal's offensive
domination featured hat tricks from
juniors Val Riss and Nancy El-
Sakkary and goal contributions
from 10 members of the Cardinal
roster. The Cardinal took first place
in their group later that afternoon
by defeating No. 15 UC-San Diego
11-3 in an effort led again by El-
Sakkary (four goals), sophomore
Katie Hansen (three goals) and

freshman Megan May (two goals).
Saturday morning, the Cardinal
faced off against No. 12 San Jose
State. The Spartans entered the
game fresh off a surprising upset of
No. h Indiana.
But there didn't seem to be any
magic left for the Spartan squad Sat
urday morning. San Jose State man
aged only a single goal midway
through the second period as the
Stanford women rolled to a 9-1 vic-

Tory that secured them a showdown
with Southern California and. at
worst, a fourth-place finish in the
tournament.
But after their demoralizing loss
to the Women of Troy, the members
of the women's squad faced the diffi
cult task of putting their defeat be
hind them in preparation for their
third-place match Sunday afternoon
against Long Beach State.
The Cardinal came out with the
same intensity they had the day be
fore against USC. This time, though,
they kept it up.
Champion again started the scor
ing for the Cardinal, taking an outlet
pass from sophomore goalie
Meridith McColl all the way into the
49ers' defensive zone before burying
a backhand to put the Cardinal up 1-
0. Two-meter Luber, who finished
with three goals, notched her first of
the day with 23 seconds remaining in
the first period to pad the Cardinal's
early lead.
The 49ers fought back with three
goals in the second period to force a
tie as the two teams went into the
half, but McColl and the Cardinal
defense stepped up to hold the 49ers
scoreless in the second half. Luber's
tallies in the third and fourth periods
proved to be the difference in the
game, as the Cardinal wrapped up
their solid effort at the tournament
with a 5-3 victory.
"We went into the weekend plan
ning to take first, but the results
haven't deterred us at all in our plans
for the future," Luber said. "If any
thing. it's brought us even more to
gether as a team, making us excited
to prove ourselves and to show what
we're made of after the challenges
and frustrations of this last week
end."
Looking back on the Cardinal's
statistically imperfect weekend from
this perspective, maybe there was
some sense of partial credit after all.
