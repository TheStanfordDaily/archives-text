# BSU wary of housing reform
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Black Student Union held a community meeting
last night to discuss the prospect of Ujamaa's relocation,
which is proposed in the housing changes announced last
month by John Bravman, vice provost for undergradu
ate education.
BSU officers opened with an overview of Bravman's
proposal and how they believe its enactment would up
root Ujamaa as a hub for Stanford's black community.
Yet much of the meeting served as a forum for con
cerned and angry community members to voice their
concerns, share their personal fondness for Ujamaa and
call for sustained involvement in relocation plans.
As written, the proposal would move Ujamaa to Flo
rence Moore Flail, where the black-theme house would
not have the singles that often attract new residents and

would be split into two separate but adjacent dorms,
BSU leaders said. The move would happen in two to six
years.
Some at the meeting said they saw the stated inten
tions of the proposal as hypocritical in its treatment of
Ujamaa.
"Everything [Bravnian] is trying to give to the rest of
the University, he is taking away from our community,"
said audience member Kiah Williams, a sophomore.
The main impetus for the proposal has been three
fold: to "unstuff" the cramped dorm conditions on cam
pus, to offer premier housing such as singles to more up
perclassmen and to create more all-frosh housing.
However, students at the meeting worried that Brav
man's plan would have the opposite effects on Ujamaa.
"If the point is to unstuff undergraduate housing.
then why would they be taking away
[Ujamaa's] singles?" Williams said.
Another audience member said
that there are many incoming fresh
men who want to live in Ujamaa but
do not get to because of space re
strictions. He also said that the pre
mier living space in Ujamaa would
no longer be available to the upper
classmen living in the house.
Although the general sentiment
was one of disapproval, the BSU of
ficers did not say they intend to re
ject the proposal completely but
stated that they wanted the black
community's input to be instrumen
tal both in reforming the proposal
and in carrying out its provisions.

"We need to be at the table right
now for the rest of [the University's]
thought process," said co-terminal
student Donielle Newell, co-chair of
the BSU.
However, if the administration
insists on relocating Ujamaa, "we're
not settling for anything less than
what we already have â€” in fact, if
they're going to move us, they'd bet
ter give us something better,"
Newell continued.
One audience member took a less
diplomatic position, calling for di
rect and immediate action in protest
of the plan.
In response. BSU co-regional li
aison sophomore LaTasha Crow
said, "We need to be strategic. We
cannot come off as angry people."
The speakers also questioned
whether Bravman's proposal should
be seen as a threat to all ethnic
theme dorms on campus.

"Every year the theme dorms are
made to justify their existence."
Newell said.
Newell expressed concern over
Stanford's reputation as a diverse
and minority-friendly institution.
Stanford is ranked seventh among
the nation's best campuses for black
students with the top six all being
historically black universities,
Newell said.
"Come Admit Weekend. Stan
ford is going to be touting diversity,"
she added. But with the loss of the
present Ujamaa house, Newell ques
tioned whether Stanford will be able
to maintain this face of diversity that
it now puts forward.
BSU officers said their organiza
tion is committed to working with
Bravman and the rest of the admin
istration while the proposal faces
discussion and reform.
Three committees have been es

tablished within the BSU to pro
mote Ujamaa's interests from multi
ple angles.
"People fought so we could have
Uj," Crow said. "It's not for us to
drop the ball."
According to Newell, Bravman
agreed in a Feb. 7 meeting with
Ujamaa residents to whatever
method of dialogue students pre
ferred in discussing the proposal.
Yet he has been slow in setting a
date fora town-hall meeting, which
is the forum Newell said the BSU
prefers.
A smaller meeting with Bravman
is scheduled for next week, with
BSU officers and an ASSU execu
tive member set to attend. At that
meeting, the BSU will urge Bravman
to set a date for the suggested town
hall meeting and to make public all
the housing statistics on which his
proposal is based.
