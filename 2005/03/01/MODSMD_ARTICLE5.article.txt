# URP grants grow more competitive
## 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
Junior Kevin Gao was one of the 41 stu
dents who applied last year fora Chappell
Lougee grant from Undergraduate Research
Programs, or URP. and one of 35 students
who received funding for his proposal — an
85 percent acceptance rate. If he had been one
of the K4 students applying for the grant this
year, he would have only had a 50 percent
chance of receiving funding.
The number of applicants to the Chappell
Lougee program — which doles out research
scholarships to sophomores in the humanities
and social sciences — more than doubled this
year. The flood of research proposals for the
grant is part of a drastic rise in the number of
students applying for research grants through
URP.
Susie Brubaker-Cole, director of URP.
said although it would be difficult to quantify
the exact increase of proposal submissions
until after all the deadlines have passed, the
net increase in applications is the result of sev
eral factors including University outreach ef
forts, academic programs like freshman and
sophomore introductory seminars which pro
mote research and a spike in the number of
students with intensive backgrounds in re
search.
"We've made significant increases in the
amount of outreach that we do," Brubaker-
Cole said. "Hardly a week goes bv that we
aren't running a workshop or panel discussion
somewhere on campus."
She said she believes that departmental re
search contributes to the number of students
interested in individual summer research.
"Students are also able to take advantage
of the numerous departmental research pro
grams on campus — many of which are ulti
mately funded by URP through [the Office of
the] Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion," Brubaker-Cole said. "[The students]
leverage that experience into the more inde-
pendent kind of work that the stu
dent grant programs can fund in sub
sequent years."
Ultimately, the swell in student
applications will lead to a lower per
centage of applicants receiving
grants.
Yet even though the chances of re
ceiving a grant have fallen, the ab
solute number of proposals funded
has increased.
"It's worth pointing out that last
year, as in every year since the Chap
pell Lougee's inception, these awards
were capped at $2,500," Brubaker-
Cole said. "Because so many in
depth student projects cost more
than that, this year we increased the
maximum Chappell Lougee budget
to $5,000."
As a result, URP upped the total
funding for the Chappell Lougee pro
gram by nearly 120 percent — from
about $76,000 in the 2003-04 academ
ic year to more than $165.(XX) this
year, according to Brubaker-Cole.
The costs of rising student interest
in undergraduate research will be
cushioned by several other funding
sources.
The recent Campaign for Under
graduate Education, which began in
2000 with a $1 billion fundraising
goal, has contributed to the student
grants program. In addition, the De
partmental and Faculty Research
Grants, coordinated by the Office of
the VPUE, have increased in scope

and size. So far this year, URP has
dedicated about $2.5 million to 34 de
partmental grants and about 100 indi
vidual-faculty grants.
Gao, who also received a grant
from the Office of the VPUE last
year, said he didn't think the in
creased difficulty of receiving a grant
like the Chappell Lougee would
deter students from applying.
"Most people think that the Chap
pell Lougee, for example, is fairly
competitive, so they'll put a lot of
work into their proposals anyway,"
Gao said. "The perception is that if
they submit a really good, thorough
proposal, with great faculty recom
mendations, they'll get the grant. The
knowledge that getting a grant is a lit
tle more difficult might inspire stu
dents to work harder on their propos
als."
Gao added that he encouraged
other students to apply for under
graduate research grants.
"I've talked to several sopho
mores about my summer research ex
perience," he said. "Plus, I've noticed
more outreach in general and the in
creased Chappell Lougee cap of
$5,000 makes it more attractive. I'm
considering applying fora major
grant this year."
Brubaker-Cole said that although
a smaller percentage of students
would receive URP grants, the in
creasing interest in undergraduate
research and greater funding is a pos
itive trend.
"When you put these factors to
gether, it's clear that the tenor of un
dergraduate research education is
changing, and for the better," she
said.
