## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
Candace Bushnell. author of "Sex and the City," the book that
inspired the HBO hit series, spoke at Kresge auditorium last
night about her life, the show and, of course, sex.
"The big question in 'Sex and the City' is why are there so
many great single women and no great guys to go out with them
and marry them." Bushnell joked. "That question remains unan
swered."
Bushnell addressed how the social changes in gender roles in
the 1980s and 90s inspired her to write about romantic relation
ships.
"Before the 80s, women went to college to get their M.R.S.
and all of a sudden they began to get real diplomas and real ca
reers," she said. "This led to a lot of changes in their relationships
toward men and we ended up with a whole generation of really,
really confused young people."
Bushnell began writing for women's magazines and explored
the issues plaguing women.
"The big question for women when 1 was in my twenties was,
'Can you sleep with a guy on the first date?' " she said. "Back then
we didn't just have 'hook-ups' like you have now. so this was an
important issue."
During her talk. Bushnell also explored the idea of female

friendships that, according to her,
emerged with women's newfound
independence.
"All of a sudden there was a huge
population of women in their 20s
and 30s who were single," Bushnell
said. "Married women usually don't
like discussing their sex lives be
cause they either feel a certain loyal
ty to their husbands or they don't
want to admit that they didn't marry
a stud. But for single women, these
bonds of loyalty aren't there, so sin
gle women would get together and
talk about their disastrous dating ex
periences."
Bushnell said that she based her
New York Observer column, "Sex
and the City," on her relationships
with her girlfriends. The characters
in the column and on the show are
based on Bushnell and her friends in
real life.
"To tell you the truth, most of my
girlfriends were like the character
Samantha," she said. "They had sex
with whomever, whenever they
wanted and they made no apolo
gies."
In an interview with The Daily
following the speech, Bushnell said
that Carrie Bradshaw's character,
the lead of both the novel and the
television series, was based entirely
on her own life.
"Carrie is my alter-ego," she said.
"I even wrote the first few columns
in first person, but then I realized
that my parents may read them so I
decided to come up with a different
name."
In a question-and-answer session
after the speech, one of the audience
members asked Bushnell if she con
sidered herself a feminist and, if so.

what she meant by the word femi
nist.
"I consider myself a feminist in
the sense that a feminist is anybody
who thinks that all men should die,"
she joked. "In fact, I've always want
ed to write a book called 'World
Without Men' so it would be all
women, and we'd let just a few cute
guys live. But really, feminism is
about people, both men and women,
being allowed to be what they want
to be and not be constrained by sex
roles."
Senior Josh Meltzer, director of
the ASSU Speakers Bureau, said
that it was her joking and entertain
ing style that led his group to invite
Bushnell to campus.
"Lately we've had a lot of very se
rious speakers so we wanted to bring
a speaker that reflected entertain
ment, that was lighter and more
fun," he said. "We want to appeal to
all sides of people's interests."
Matt Sorlien, a fifth-year senior,
attended the show, but said he was
not sure if he appreciated the light
hearted nature of the speech.
"It was very fun and not as in
tense as most other ASSU Speakers
Bureau events, but I'm not sure if
that's a good thing," he said. "There
was no educational value to this
speech, but the pure entertainment
value may be enough."
Sophomore Rebecca Sorenson,
who also attended the event, said
"She's great, she's just like Carrie on
the show. I didn't expect her to talk
so much about her life, but hearing
her story has really helped me put
her books and the show into per
spective. It's good to see where she's
coming from."
In a remark that was followed by
loud applause, Bushnell said that the
main point of her work is to show
women that they can go out with
their friends and have a good time.
"I want to teach single women
everywhere how to party," she said.
Bushnell ended the speech by
scolding the audience for not asking
about her shoes and pointed out that
she was wearing not a Manolo Blah
nik but a Marc Jacobs shoe with "the
new rounded toe that we're all sup
posed to wear this spring."

"The big question in 'Sex and the City' is why are there so
many great single women and no great guys to go out with them
and marry them." Bushnell joked. "That question remains unan
swered."
Bushnell addressed how the social changes in gender roles in
the 1980s and 90s inspired her to write about romantic relation
ships.
"Before the 80s, women went to college to get their M.R.S.
and all of a sudden they began to get real diplomas and real ca
reers," she said. "This led to a lot of changes in their relationships
toward men and we ended up with a whole generation of really,
really confused young people."
Bushnell began writing for women's magazines and explored
the issues plaguing women.
"The big question for women when 1 was in my twenties was,
'Can you sleep with a guy on the first date?' " she said. "Back then
we didn't just have 'hook-ups' like you have now. so this was an
important issue."
During her talk. Bushnell also explored the idea of female

friendships that, according to her,
emerged with women's newfound
independence.
"All of a sudden there was a huge
population of women in their 20s
and 30s who were single," Bushnell
said. "Married women usually don't
like discussing their sex lives be
cause they either feel a certain loyal
ty to their husbands or they don't
want to admit that they didn't marry
a stud. But for single women, these
bonds of loyalty aren't there, so sin
gle women would get together and
talk about their disastrous dating ex
periences."
Bushnell said that she based her
New York Observer column, "Sex
and the City," on her relationships
with her girlfriends. The characters
in the column and on the show are
based on Bushnell and her friends in
real life.
"To tell you the truth, most of my
girlfriends were like the character
Samantha," she said. "They had sex
with whomever, whenever they
wanted and they made no apolo
gies."
In an interview with The Daily
following the speech, Bushnell said
that Carrie Bradshaw's character,
the lead of both the novel and the
television series, was based entirely
on her own life.
"Carrie is my alter-ego," she said.
"I even wrote the first few columns
in first person, but then I realized
that my parents may read them so I
decided to come up with a different
name."
In a question-and-answer session
after the speech, one of the audience
members asked Bushnell if she con
sidered herself a feminist and, if so.

what she meant by the word femi
nist.
"I consider myself a feminist in
the sense that a feminist is anybody
who thinks that all men should die,"
she joked. "In fact, I've always want
ed to write a book called 'World
Without Men' so it would be all
women, and we'd let just a few cute
guys live. But really, feminism is
about people, both men and women,
being allowed to be what they want
to be and not be constrained by sex
roles."
Senior Josh Meltzer, director of
the ASSU Speakers Bureau, said
that it was her joking and entertain
ing style that led his group to invite
Bushnell to campus.
"Lately we've had a lot of very se
rious speakers so we wanted to bring
a speaker that reflected entertain
ment, that was lighter and more
fun," he said. "We want to appeal to
all sides of people's interests."
Matt Sorlien, a fifth-year senior,
attended the show, but said he was
not sure if he appreciated the light
hearted nature of the speech.
"It was very fun and not as in
tense as most other ASSU Speakers
Bureau events, but I'm not sure if
that's a good thing," he said. "There
was no educational value to this
speech, but the pure entertainment
value may be enough."
Sophomore Rebecca Sorenson,
who also attended the event, said
"She's great, she's just like Carrie on
the show. I didn't expect her to talk
so much about her life, but hearing
her story has really helped me put
her books and the show into per
spective. It's good to see where she's
coming from."
In a remark that was followed by
loud applause, Bushnell said that the
main point of her work is to show
women that they can go out with
their friends and have a good time.
"I want to teach single women
everywhere how to party," she said.
Bushnell ended the speech by
scolding the audience for not asking
about her shoes and pointed out that
she was wearing not a Manolo Blah
nik but a Marc Jacobs shoe with "the
new rounded toe that we're all sup
posed to wear this spring."
