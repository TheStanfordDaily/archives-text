# NCAA unveils new system to measure teams' academics
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
In an effort to crackdown on the poor graduation rates of
athletes at Division I schools, the NCAA will begin punishing
teams that score below its new Academic Progress Rate
(APR) minimum by cutting their allotment of athletic schol
arships.
The APR. which will be used as the standard measure
of a team's overall academic success beginning next year,
awards scholarship athletes points for remaining both aca
demically eligible and enrolled in school. A team's APR is
then computed by dividing the sum of its members' points
earned by the total points possible. The NCAA has set the
minimum score at 925. which equates roughly to a 50 per
cent graduation rate.
Under the new standard, which will take effect next
year, more than half of the 328 Division I schools could
lose one or more scholarships in at least one sport based on
data from 2003-2004 released Monday. The APR report
was sent to the chief executive officer at every Division 1
institution for review - some erroneous calculations have
already been reported - and as a
precautionary warning to poorly
performing schools.
Stanford's average APR score
was 979. 31 points higher than the
national average. Every Cardinal
team included in the report sur
passed the 925 cutoff, including the
football and men's basketball
teams, which are two of the poorest
scoring sports nationally according
to the data.
Forty-two percent of Division 1

football programs, including six Pa
cific-10 Conference teams, and 47
percent of Division I men's basket
hall programs scored below the 925
minimum.
The Oregon football team's
score of 849 ranked third-worst
among all Division I schools - only
Middle Tennessee State (802) and
San Jose State (814) scored lower.
UCLA and Arizona tied for
eighth-worst with identical scores
of 862. The Stanford football
team's 994 falls between the 90th
and 100 th percentile for all Divi
sion 1 football programs.
Thirteen out of 29 Stanford
teams included in the report scored
perfect 1000s.
