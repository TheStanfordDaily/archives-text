Announcing Openings for*
Sophomore College Assistants and Oral Communication Tutors
Residential Computer Coordinators
for the 2005 Sophomore College
September 3 - September 23, 2005
Sophomore College is a set of programs for returning sophomores, who live together in a student residence and work under faculty supervision in a series of small-group classes during early September, before the start
of fall quarter.
Sophomore College Assistants (SCAs): Each faculty member is assisted by two upper-class sophomore college assistants (SCAs). (In some instances, one of the SG\s may be a graduate student.) Any student who will
be a junior or senior in 2005-06 and is in good academic standing is eligible to apply. SCAs will receive room, board, and $750 for full-time work during the course of the program, and for possible planning meetings at the end of
spring quarter. Note: Due to the fact that the training for RA, RCC, and IIFAC programs conflict with Sophomore College, if you are selected for both positions, you must choose between them. We will coordinate with PAA and OV
training, so these positions will not conflict.
Residential Computer Coordinators (RCCs) and Oral Communication Tutors (OCTs): RCCs and student tutors in oral communication will also live in each residence and will receive room and board as part of their
compensation. The stipend for RCCs will be $500 and the OCTs will be paid an hourly wage commensurate with level of training.
