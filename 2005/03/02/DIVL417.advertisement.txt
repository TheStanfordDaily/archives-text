Zbigniew Brzezinski has had a distinguished career in government and academia. From 1977 to 1981 he was
the National Security Advisor to President jimmy Carter. In 1981 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of
Freedom "for his role in the normalization of U.S. - Chinese relations and for his contributions to the
human rights and national security policies of the United States."
The Oksenberg Lecture honors the legacy of Professor Michel Oksenberg (1938-2001) longtime member of
APARC, senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for International Studies, and an authority on China.
Professor Oksenberg was consistently outspoken about the need for the United States to engage with Asia
in a more considered manner. In tribute, the Oksenberg Lecture recognizes distinguished individuals who
have helped to advance understanding between the United States and the nations of the Asia-Pacific.
The Shorenstein Forum was established at the Asia-Pacific Research Center (APARC) in 1998, through the
generosity of Walter H. Shorenstein.
