University Provost John
Etchemendy gave a presentation at last
night's ASSU Undergraduate Senate
meeting on tuition increases and spoke
about the planned changes to housing at
Stanford. The Senate also passed several
bills regarding election certification pro
cedures and general fee consolidation.
Etchemendy's presentation, entitled
"University Finance 101 or Why the
Numbers Just Don't Add Up," largely
addressed student concerns about year
ly tuition hikes.
The report broke down Stanford's con
solidated revenue into four categories:
general funds, grants, auxiliaries and re
stricted costs, which refer to gifts donat
ed to support specific programs.
Tuition comprises 57 percent of general
funds, and the rest is made up of en

dowments and indirect costs.
"We're not a business," Etchemendy
said. "We're a nonprofit organization
devoted to research and education."
He distinguished between full tuition,
the published sticker price of attending
Stanford, and net tuition, the price that
families pay after receiving financial aid
and outside grants.
According to Etchemendy, even
though the full tuition has been increas
ing at a higher rate than in previous
years — from 4.3 percent in 1999 to 5.0
percent in 2002 — the net tuition has
been rising at a lower rate over time —
with a growth rate of 6.5 percent in 1999
compared to a 3.2 percent growth rate in
2002.
One reason for this decline is that the
current economy is not as strong as in
previous years and therefore families
can afford to pay less.
Etchemendy also discussed student par
ticipation in the recently proposed

housing changes, specifically the trans
formation of Stern, Wilbur and Flo
rence Moore Halls into all-freshman
dormitories.
"Students provided a high amount of
input into the housing plans,"
Etchemendy said. "We gathered lots of
survey data about what students think
of their housing experiences."
The idea to convert these dorms to
house freshmen was largely prompted
by these surveys, which demonstrate
that there is a large margin of students
who have had better experiences in all
freshmen dorms in comparison to their
peers who lived in four-class dorms dur
ing their freshman year.
"When we look at exit surveys, the peo
ple who think most highly of their hous
ing situation were in all-freshmen
dorms," Etchemendy said.
In addition, housing administrators
