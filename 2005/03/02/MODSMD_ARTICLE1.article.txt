# Provost addresses tuition hikes

### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
University Provost John
Etchemendy gave a presentation at last
night's ASSU Undergraduate Senate
meeting on tuition increases and spoke
about the planned changes to housing at
Stanford. The Senate also passed several
bills regarding election certification pro
cedures and general fee consolidation.
Etchemendy's presentation, entitled
"University Finance 101 or Why the
Numbers Just Don't Add Up," largely
addressed student concerns about year
ly tuition hikes.
The report broke down Stanford's con
solidated revenue into four categories:
general funds, grants, auxiliaries and re
stricted costs, which refer to gifts donat
ed to support specific programs.
Tuition comprises 57 percent of general
funds, and the rest is made up of en

dowments and indirect costs.
"We're not a business," Etchemendy
said. "We're a nonprofit organization
devoted to research and education."
He distinguished between full tuition,
the published sticker price of attending
Stanford, and net tuition, the price that
families pay after receiving financial aid
and outside grants.
According to Etchemendy, even
though the full tuition has been increas
ing at a higher rate than in previous
years — from 4.3 percent in 1999 to 5.0
percent in 2002 — the net tuition has
been rising at a lower rate over time —
with a growth rate of 6.5 percent in 1999
compared to a 3.2 percent growth rate in
2002.
One reason for this decline is that the
current economy is not as strong as in
previous years and therefore families
can afford to pay less.
Etchemendy also discussed student par
ticipation in the recently proposed

housing changes, specifically the trans
formation of Stern, Wilbur and Flo
rence Moore Halls into all-freshman
dormitories.
"Students provided a high amount of
input into the housing plans,"
Etchemendy said. "We gathered lots of
survey data about what students think
of their housing experiences."
The idea to convert these dorms to
house freshmen was largely prompted
by these surveys, which demonstrate
that there is a large margin of students
who have had better experiences in all
freshmen dorms in comparison to their
peers who lived in four-class dorms dur
ing their freshman year.
"When we look at exit surveys, the peo
ple who think most highly of their hous
ing situation were in all-freshmen
dorms," Etchemendy said.
In addition, housing administrators
want to create a premiere year of hous
ing so that accommodations improve
for students each year. To provide bet
ter rooms for upperclassmen and more
singles for seniors, most four-class
dorms would need to be replaced by all
freshmen dorms.
"The only way to achieve this is to use
up the least desirable housing on fresh
men who in fact enjoy their freshman
dorm experience regardless of their
housing," said Htchemendy.
Following the provost's presentation,
the Senate approved a bill implement
ing a constitutional procedure for inval
idating fraudulent elections. In past
years, ASSU executive elections need
ed to be certified by the Senate and the
Graduate Student Council in order to
be official. Under the new bill, the elec
tion would automatically be certified
unless it is proved fraudulent. The bill
must still be voted on by the Graduate
Student Council.
The Senate also approved another bill
that would merge the programminggen
eral fee funds and the community service
fee funds, which would allow these
monies to be used more flexiblv because

they would not need to be alloeated for
specific use. The new "Programming
and Community Service General Fee"
will be levied on undergraduates to fund
the operations and community service
programs of organizations with signifi
cant undergrad membership, except for
student publications and groups that re
ceive special fees, the bill stated. This
measure still needs to be approved by
the undergraduate student body during
the spring elections.
A third bill was approved by the Senate
to establish a procedure in case of a tie
in the ASSU executive elections. Ac
cording to the language of the bill, if
such a situation occurs, the slate that re
ceived the fewest votes in preceding or
primary elections will be eliminated. If
this method fails to determine a winner,
the student legislative bodies will evalu
ate the breakdown of each tied slate's
votes by population and the slate with
votes most equally distributed between
the graduate and undergraduate popu
lations will be declared the winner.
The Senate passed another 13 less
consequential bills, including one that
would change the name of the Com
mittee on Student Life to the Com
mittee of Student Life, Housing and
Education, and another that would
provide an alternative to expulsion for
senators who miss many standing
committee meetings.
