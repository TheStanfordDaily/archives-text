# But that's not the point...
## iPod, therefore I am missing something 
### 
Last week, I saw something ab
solutely shocking. Walking
back to my dorm from class, I
saw a couple walking down the
street hand in hand. They weren't
looking at each other or talking, and
I wouldn't have thought anything of
it except that both of them had sus
piciously familiar white cords run
ning from their pockets to their

ears.
Oh, the iPod.
The hippest cam
pus accessory you
can have these
days — although
still slightly less
prevalent than
the hike.
Seeing that
couple reminded

me of something I saw on VHI
once. Supposedly, P. Diddy has an
engraved iPod with a special 'Get
ting it On' playlist. If that's true —
and 1 sure hope it isn't — then I
have a new reason to hate P. Diddy.
Back to the point: If our society
has made it to the point where it's
too much of a hassle to share the
same music with a partner, much
less speak to them, I'm seceding
from Corporate America.
I mean, I'm not going to lie: I
have an iPod, and I love it. I use it
when I'm studying in a coffee shop
and I definitely use it in my car. And
I am not ashamed to admit that
when I went camping last summer, I
used it with portable speakers to set
the mood around the campfire.
So I'm not judging the device or
the company that makes it. I'm just
wondering about what it says about
our society that we can't walk down
a street with another person with
out our headphones on and music
blasting.
The reason the iPod has become
the must-have for anyone with $300
of disposable income is that urge in
all of us to have a soundtrack of our
lives. You know, the perfect song
for the perfect moment.
Sometimes when I'm walking
down the street, my iPod will play a
song that seems to perfectly express
my mood and the events of the day. I
walk with an extra swing in my step,
and I feel content and satisfied with
how an Apple product has managed
to make my day seem like a scene
from the TV show "Felicity."
But it's so constructed. When I
went camping last summer, 1 made
four or five different mixes before I
left, for different times of day and
various activities. When my friends
and I played the "late night" mix
while lying on the ground looking
up at the sky, every song seemed
perfect. Every song seemed to unite
me with the larger universe and
give me a sense of continuity and a
sense of place.
I've always wanted to turn my life
into a movie. I remember one time
last spring when two friends and I sat
in the Casa Italiana kitchen devising
the perfect love story for one anoth
er. These stories included sound
tracks, which was completely unreal
istic given that at least one of the cli
mactic scenes took place outside, in
the rain.
In general, it's almost impossible
to predict an upcoming moment
and prepare a soundtrack for it. The
moments that most need an audio
background are usually the mo
ments that pass by without it — the
tragedies of life, the little dramas,
the romances (especially the ro
mances) and so on. As close as the
iPod can come to being there for us
all the time, we still can't have the
perfect score for our life movie.
Nor should we. I love music, too.
but there are some things that are
more important: real, human interac
tion, for example. Walking down the
street talking to someone instead of
listening to your iPod, for example.
When you get down to it, life is
more interesting than staying inside
your own head, with the music
turned up so high you can't even
hear people say hello to you. And
sometimes, life surprises you and
gives you something you couldn t
have predicted — a song that you
would never have put on the
playlist, but which makes your day.
Please — take ofl the head
phones. Live your life, and I
promise that the soundtrack will
follow.

the mood around the campfire.
So I'm not judging the device or
the company that makes it. I'm just
wondering about what it says about
our society that we can't walk down
a street with another person with
out our headphones on and music
blasting.
The reason the iPod has become
the must-have for anyone with $300
of disposable income is that urge in
all of us to have a soundtrack of our
lives. You know, the perfect song
for the perfect moment.
Sometimes when I'm walking
down the street, my iPod will play a
song that seems to perfectly express
my mood and the events of the day. I
walk with an extra swing in my step,
and I feel content and satisfied with
how an Apple product has managed
to make my day seem like a scene
from the TV show "Felicity."
But it's so constructed. When I
went camping last summer, 1 made
four or five different mixes before I
left, for different times of day and
various activities. When my friends
and I played the "late night" mix
while lying on the ground looking
up at the sky, every song seemed
perfect. Every song seemed to unite
me with the larger universe and
give me a sense of continuity and a
sense of place.
I've always wanted to turn my life
into a movie. I remember one time
last spring when two friends and I sat
in the Casa Italiana kitchen devising
the perfect love story for one anoth
er. These stories included sound
tracks, which was completely unreal
istic given that at least one of the cli
mactic scenes took place outside, in
the rain.
In general, it's almost impossible
to predict an upcoming moment
and prepare a soundtrack for it. The
moments that most need an audio
background are usually the mo
ments that pass by without it — the
tragedies of life, the little dramas,
the romances (especially the ro
mances) and so on. As close as the
iPod can come to being there for us
all the time, we still can't have the
perfect score for our life movie.
Nor should we. I love music, too.
but there are some things that are
more important: real, human interac
tion, for example. Walking down the
street talking to someone instead of
listening to your iPod, for example.
When you get down to it, life is
more interesting than staying inside
your own head, with the music
turned up so high you can't even
hear people say hello to you. And
sometimes, life surprises you and
gives you something you couldn t
have predicted — a song that you
would never have put on the
playlist, but which makes your day.
Please — take ofl the head
phones. Live your life, and I
promise that the soundtrack will
follow.
