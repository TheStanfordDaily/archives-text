# A 						Day in the life of a Professor

We sit in class listening to their insights and ideas. We spend endless
hours punching away at the keyboard or scribbling problem set re
sponses for them to evaluate. We attend lectures, explore research pro
ject ideas and engage in intellectual debates with them.
As Stanford students, we are constantly involved with faculty mem
bers. But outside of our interactions with professors, what exactly do
they do? How approachable are they to undergraduates?
Whether it is a newly-arrived associate or a tenured professor on the
verge of retirement, Stanford faculty members are in a constant jug
gling act — a struggle to not let any one ball fall to the ground.
" I am writing a textbook, traveling around the world giving lectures,
reviewing journal articles, heading organizations and doing social anti
war, anti-right wing activities," Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo said.
And that is just a week's worth of agenda.
High-profile faculty members like Zimbardo have to rise to the
challenge of striking a balance between teaching, researching and pub
lishing. not to mention other obligations.
"I guess I don't really balance — I do it all," Zimbardo said. "I
teach my butt off, do a lot of research and write articles and book chap
ters all the time."
Jeremy Weinstein, an assistant professor of political science who is
brand-new to campus this year, faces a similar multitude of commit
ments at any given time. Currently, he is finishing a book about rebel
lion that focuses on weak state problems of Africa and Latin America.
He said he is excited about doing field work in Uganda this summer
and, in addition to his own research endeavors, takes an active role in
20 to 30 research projects of his undergraduate and graduate students.
"Being a professor here is an absolute privilege," Weinstein said.
After receiving a doctorate degree from Harvard and doing re
search for Washington, D.C.-based think tanks, Weinstein said he
faced the choice that many academics and researchers — sacrificing
the monetary benefits of a more lucrative field for the privilege of
teaching. He said he decided that the real benefits of the intellectual
world were to be gained from interaction with students.
"We all know that the pay is higher in other fields, especially for the
amount of academic qualifications that Stanford faculty members
have," Weinstein said. "But I would never have the opportunity to be
truly engaged and inspired every day by my students."
Professors' salaries are largely based on rank. According to the Of
fice of the Provost, a faculty member in a humanities assistant profes
sorship, which is a tenure-track position, earns $60,725 per year on av
erage. An associate professor, who may or may not be tenured, makes
$80,836 and a professor, who is tenured, makes between $112,075 and
$129,325 annually depending on his experience. Salaries are marginally
higher for professors of social and natural sciences.
While monetary concerns may exist, the benefits of working with
young, motivated students —what Weinstein dubbed "psychic bene
fits" — make the job worthwhile, Weinstein said.
He added that on-campus housing helps with living costs. Faculty
housing is leased from Stanford, so technically, it never belongs to the
professor. But the leases are typically for 99 years, so it is as if faculty
members practically own it. Faculty housing offers not only affordable
housing, but also a great location that enhances involvement in student
and campus life, said Weinstein, who lives in faculty housing with his
wife.
Physics Prof. Savas Dimopoulos said he is accessible to students, but
they must initiate the interaction. He spends his days mostly interacting

with post-doctoral students
writing papers, going to board
meetings, attending seminars
and teaching his classes.
In spite of Dimopolous'
extensive and highly ac
claimed research endeavors,
year alter year, he offers
freshman seminars on basic
physics concepts.
"My goal is to develop
some awareness for every stu
dent of what physics is and
what it does," Dimopoulos
said. "Every year there are
one or two students that de
cide to go into physics because
of my seminars. That is why I
teach them year after year."
Drama Prof. Patricia
Ryan, who is about to com
plete her 30th and final quar
ter this spring, said she feels
that there is no separation be
tween her daily routine of
classes and outside of class
when it comes to student in
teraction. Interaction and in
volvement with students, for

her, has been an integrated pari of her three decades at Stanford.
"Not having any kids of my own, I consider my students to sort of be
like my extended family," Ryan said. Living on campus in faculty hous
ing during her younger days, she would often have students over for
dinner, attend campus events and even make an appearance at parties.
For Ryan, living in faculty housing was a way to stay connected to
student life. Now her week consists of commuting twice a week to cam
pus from her home in El Grenada, 30 miles away. She teaches two im
provisation classes and one continued education class of improvisation
for adults.
"To improvise means to figure out what is means to be human,"
Ryan explained.
She said each class session for her is an opportunity to learn from, get
to know and interact with students.
In spite of the hectic juggling act that Stanford faculty members in
evitably end up performing, many have said they try to be approach
able and accessible.
"The problem is not the accessibility of professors to undergradu
ates, but the other way around." Zimbardo said. "Students do not ac
cess professors. We are available and they do not use us as much as they
should. Stanford is for them, and they must exploit the situation much
more than they do."
