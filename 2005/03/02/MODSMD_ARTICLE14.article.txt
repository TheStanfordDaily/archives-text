# What it takes to get tenure
## 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After years of completing prob
lem sets, writing papers and taking
exams, receiving a diploma is a tes
tament to a student's hard work. For
professors, recognition for hard
work in research and teaching
comes from earning a tenured posi
tion at the University.
When a professor is granted
tenure, his or her job is secure; the
professor cannot be fired and is guar
anteed a stable income. To receive
tenure, one must be hired by the Uni
versity into a tenure-track position.
The first rung of the tenure-track
ladder is the assistant professor po
sition, often held by a young aca
demic. The other positions in the
tenure line are associate professor
and professor.
Assistant Professors are often
hired fora period of three years and
associate professors for six years. Fac
ulty may not remain in these positions
untenured for more than seven years,
except in certain circumstances, such
as if the candidate becomes a parent.
Professors do not serve for any maxi
mum length of time. Once an assistant
professor is tenured, he is promoted to
the position of associate professor. A
faculty member hired as an untenured
associate professor may be promoted
to professor or remain an associate
professor once he gains tenure.
"[Untenured faculty] conduct
their research and produce their
scholarship and teach and perform
service responsibilities," said Jane
Volk-Brew, associate provost for fac
ulty affairs. "When it's deemed ap
propriate by their chair, before their
tenure expires, their department
chair convenes a review committee.
That committee is charged to gather
the evidence to accompany the rec
ommendation to either promote
them or re-appoint them with tenure,
depending upon what their rank is."
Untenured faculty members are
constantly evaluated throughout
their time on the tenure track. Joanne
Yoong, a graduate student in eco
nomics who intends to pursue an as
sistant professorship, described the
process as an "extremely-visible,
multi-year, high-stress job interview,
where you constantly need to prove
yourself, and it's very possible that
you'll be out of a job at the end of the
day."
The review committee makes a
recommendation to the department
(or the faculty at large when the
school does not have departments),
and a decision is made. A favorable
decision means the application is
sent forward to the school's dean.
Several schools, such as the School
of Education, have one or more ad
visory committees that aid the dean
in making a decision on tenure.
If the dean approves the applica
tion, it is sent to the University
provost. If the provost decides favor
ably, it is then referred to the Adviso
ry Board â€” a committee of seven se
nior faculty members that evaluates
the candidate and then make a rec
ommendation to the President.
