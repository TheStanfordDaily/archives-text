# What it takes to get tenure
## 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After years of completing prob
lem sets, writing papers and taking
exams, receiving a diploma is a tes
tament to a student's hard work. For
professors, recognition for hard
work in research and teaching
comes from earning a tenured posi
tion at the University.
When a professor is granted
tenure, his or her job is secure; the
professor cannot be fired and is guar
anteed a stable income. To receive
tenure, one must be hired by the Uni
versity into a tenure-track position.
The first rung of the tenure-track
ladder is the assistant professor po
sition, often held by a young aca
demic. The other positions in the
tenure line are associate professor
and professor.
Assistant Professors are often
hired fora period of three years and
associate professors for six years. Fac
ulty may not remain in these positions
untenured for more than seven years,
except in certain circumstances, such
as if the candidate becomes a parent.
Professors do not serve for any maxi
mum length of time. Once an assistant
professor is tenured, he is promoted to
the position of associate professor. A
faculty member hired as an untenured
associate professor may be promoted
to professor or remain an associate
professor once he gains tenure.
"[Untenured faculty] conduct
their research and produce their
scholarship and teach and perform
service responsibilities," said Jane
Volk-Brew, associate provost for fac
ulty affairs. "When it's deemed ap
propriate by their chair, before their
tenure expires, their department
chair convenes a review committee.
That committee is charged to gather
the evidence to accompany the rec
ommendation to either promote
them or re-appoint them with tenure,
depending upon what their rank is."
Untenured faculty members are
constantly evaluated throughout
their time on the tenure track. Joanne
Yoong, a graduate student in eco
nomics who intends to pursue an as
sistant professorship, described the
process as an "extremely-visible,
multi-year, high-stress job interview,
where you constantly need to prove
yourself, and it's very possible that
you'll be out of a job at the end of the
day."
The review committee makes a
recommendation to the department
(or the faculty at large when the
school does not have departments),
and a decision is made. A favorable
decision means the application is
sent forward to the school's dean.
Several schools, such as the School
of Education, have one or more ad
visory committees that aid the dean
in making a decision on tenure.
If the dean approves the applica
tion, it is sent to the University
provost. If the provost decides favor
ably, it is then referred to the Adviso
ry Board — a committee of seven se
nior faculty members that evaluates
the candidate and then make a rec
ommendation to the President.
It is up to the University president
to make the final decision. Decisions
are reported to the University's Board
of Trustees and are published in the
Stanford Report.
"The number of faculty posi
tions, usually referred to as 'billets.'
is controlled by the provost and
managed by the deans of the
schools," said Vice Provost for Fac
ulty Development Pat Jones, a pro
fessor of biological sciences.
"Schools have historical numbers of
billets, and if a school wants to in
crease the number of faculty, that
needs to be discussed with and ap
proved by the Provost."
She explained further that although
each school has a set number of total
billets, the number of tenured faculty
positions per school is not pre-deter
mined — a candidate will be hired for
tenure if the tenure review process in
dicates he or she should be.
Though the number of billets in a
school is set, "growth [can be] ap
proved following discussion between
the dean and the provost, based on
school needs," Jones said.
Although "Associate professor" is
one of the tenure line positions, some
faculty designated as "Associate pro
fessor" are not tenure-tracked. The
non-tenure tracked positions are dis
tinguished by parenthetical designa
tions such as "teaching" or "perfor
mance." These positions are typically
filled when an expert in a particular
field is needed on a temporary' basis.
"When a search occurs fora new
faculty member, the department and
school dean decide if the search
should be fora junior (untenured) or
tenured professor, usually a function
of what the needs and age structure of
the department are." Jones ex
plained.
Although many hires are made at
the junior level, Jones said that a senior
professor may be hired in order to, for
instance, "strengthen a subject area
more rapidly or to build leadership of
the department or school."
In order to eventually achieve
tenure, a candidate must distinguish
him- or herself as a prominent mem
ber of their field, often through re
search and subsequent publication. In
addition, a candidate must prove that
he or she will be a long-term asset to
Stanford.
As the Faculty Handbook guide
lines on tenure state."For recommen
dations of reappointment or promo
tion to tenure, the department or
school is obliged to present evidence
that the candidate has achieved true
distinction in scholarship. The scholar
ship must reveal that the candidate is

not only among the best in his/her ex
perience cohort in a broadly defined
field but also is likely to become one of
the very best in the field."
The tenure review process is a com
parative one — a candidate's work is
evaluated in part through the solicita
tion of several letters of recommenda
tion from colleagues outside Stanford.
"They are usually asked to evalu
ate the candidate in relation to their
peers, colleagues of similar ages or,
quite often, older peers, are asked to
evaluate the candidate against other
prominent people in the field." Asso
ciate Professor of Anthropological
Sciences John Rick explained. "The
Stanford candidate should be at the
top."
The solicitation of these letters,
however, often means that a candi
date's teaching ability is de-empha
sized, since the people solicited often
have not witnessed the candidate
teach. But other materials, such as the
ASSU's teaching evaluation data, are
also collected to provide a fuller pic
ture of a candidate's skills and contri
butions.
Rick elaborated on the ups and
downs of the tenure process.
"The reason that tenure came
about in the first place is academic
freedom," he said. "In an academic
community where you play with ideas
and given that ideas can be seen as
dangerous, the idea of restricting
someone's freedom always crops up."
To gain tenure, members of the ju
nior faculty strive to distinguish them
selves in their fields. Once tenure has
been achieved, however, a professor's
emphasis shifts, as some professors
have noted.
After the rush to achieve tenure, it
is often the case that a faculty member
will "throttle back" on their research.
Rick explained. In addition, tenured
faculty members are sought out for
more administrative duties than junior
faculty, taking time away from teach
ing and other activities.
"Stanford has a lovely system
where junior faculty are supposed to
have the lightest load of committee
duties and advisory duties of any fac
ulty to give them a fair crack at
tenure," Rick said. "But that means
that when you've got tenure, you are
lair game [to be tapped for adminis
trative work]."
As recent events at Harvard Uni
versity the hiring of women faculty
have shown, tenure can be a con
tentious and controversial process.
Stanford is sensitive to its tenure
granting practices and has several in
ternal review committees that evalu
ate the University's hiring trends, in
cluding the Provost Advisory Com
mittee on Status of Women Faculty.
Such committees have kept a close eye
on the gains and losses in faculty but
especially on the percentages of
women and minority faculty.
