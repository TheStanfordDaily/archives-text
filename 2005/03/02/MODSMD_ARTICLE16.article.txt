# Nobel laureates reminisce to raise relief hinds
## 
### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
If the audience learned anything from the four
Stanford Nobel laureates, who spoke at Kresge
Auditorium last night, it must be that wild success
rests on hard work — and a lot of luck. The speak
ers shared their lifelong journeys of success and
failure in an event sponsored by the Stanford Stu
dents for Relief.
Prof. Richard Taylor, the 1990 winner of the
Nobel Prize in physics, said he, as a doctoral stu
dent, had hoped to study under Stanford Prof. Felix
Bloch, who in 1952 received Stanford's first Nobel
Prize. Bloch was renowned for his work on nuclear
magnetic resonance, the basis for magnetic reso
nance imaging, commonly known today as MRI.
"I asked if he could become my dissertation su
pervisor." said Taylor. "And he said no."
Taylor said he eventually decided to investi
gate the deep inelastic scattering of electrons on
protons and bound neutrons. His findings proved
to be essential for the development of the quark
model in particle physics.
"Because Bloch turned me down, 1 can be here
tonight instead of playing with the MRI in a hos
pital," Taylor said.
Prof. Kenneth Arrow, who won the 1972

Nobel Prize in economics, explained that his story
was marked by fate.
"I had always wanted to become a high school
teacher in mathematics," Arrow said. "Yet by
mere accident. 1 got hired by an insurance compa
ny as a clerk the summer before I graduated from
college, calculating insurance premium."
His experience at the company sparked his in
terest in the actuarial science, he said. Arrow ulti
mately became a pioneer in general equilibrium
theory and welfare theory.
He also stressed the importance of hard work.
"Chances favor the prepared minds," he said.
Another Nobel laureate in physics. Prof. Mar
tin Perl talked about his "maxims for science, en
gineering and technology."
"You must be interested in, even enchanted by,
some of the technology or mathematics you use,"
noted Perl. "Then the bad days are not so bad."
He also urged current and aspiring scientists to
learn the art of obsession.
"When you wake up in the middle of the night,
[science] is what you should be thinking about, not
your boyfriend or girlfriend," he joked.
Audience members with a particular interest in
investment likely anticipated the presentation of
Prof. William Sharpe, winner of the 1990 Nobel
Prize in economics, whose capital asset pricing

model provided the foundation of present-day fi
nancial economics.
Offering the one most valuable investment tip
based on his theory, Sharpe said, "Don't put all
your eggs in one basket," pointing out the impor
tance to diversify one's investment portfolio.
Fielding a question from an audience member,
Sharpe said big ideas do not necessarily come
from intuition. Rather, correctly formulating the
question and observing things with a keen eye are
keys to "solving the puzzles."
"And it'sjust wonderful to have a job in a place
like Stanford, where all you do is to solve these
puzzles," he added.
Those who attended the discussion responded
very positively to the laureates' remarks.
"All the speeches were very interesting." said
Sam Mazin, a doctoral candidate in electrical en
gineering. "It's a rare opportunity to listen to
these down-to-earth and approachable profes
sors. I've really enjoyed it."
The $S,(MM) proceeds generated by the event
will go toward tsunami relief efforts via the Save
the Children Fund.
"This event raises money fora very good
cause," Arrow said following his speech. "It's a re
minder of our social and moral obligation to the
entire world."
