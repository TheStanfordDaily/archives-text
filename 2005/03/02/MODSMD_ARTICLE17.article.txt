Cardinal Dollars will allow students to patronize
more eateries on campus.
While we are supportive of the modifications out
lined above, there is a significant change that we feel
will negatively affect students. The most serious prob
lem with the new plan is the increase in price. Unlike
the current system in which meal-plan costs vary from
$4,081 per year to $4,578 per year, the new system will
not give students a choice in how much they pay for
food. Each plan will cost $4,656 per year — $78 more
than the most expensive plan in the current system
and $575 more than the cheapest plan.
Stanford Dining representatives said one reason
for changing to a single rate is to help students on fi
nancial aid. However, the change hurts students, too.
Under the current system, many students purchase
the cheaper plans to give themselves more flexibility
in eating off campus or, more rarely, cooperative
houses. The new system will essentially force students
who are economically sensitive to eat all their meals at
Stanford Dining locations, while students who contin
ue eating at non-Dining locations will be wasting
money in not using their excess meals or Cardinal
Dollars.
We applaud Stanford Dining for re-examining its
meal plans and making some improvements, hut we
urge administrators to reconsider their decision to
limit student options.
