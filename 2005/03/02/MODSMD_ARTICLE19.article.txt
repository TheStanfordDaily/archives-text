## On Happiness and Politics 
### 
Despite popular opinion, writing
these columns is never easy. There is
so much going on, both here in the
bubble and outside of it (or so they tell
me) that finding the perfect thing to
write about — well, it never happens.
This can be very frustrating. If I was
the perfectionist I was in third grade, I
would become sullen and endlessly
beat myself up inside.
But that's no way to live. How many

times do we have to be reminded that nobody's perfect?
It's how we deal with not being perfect that's impor
tant. For this, we have two options.
The first I call the apathy approach, which basically in
volves not trying. Why should I put endless effort into en
deavors that are not guaranteed to turn out perfectly?
Why should I invest my time in class or sports or life if
there's a chance, in some arenas a big chance, that I'll end
up disappointed?
This approach hinges on the notion that avoiding this
disappointment would make me better off than having
engaged myself in the first place. Wouldn't it be easier to
just sit at home, watch TV and embark upon an extended
period of elegant decline?
Yes. this would be easier. Would this make you happi
er?
The second approach I call the human approach —
because this is what has gotten us this far as a civilization.
It involves putting in the effort and dealing with the im
perfection. If you realize that all the time and effort you
put into something will not guarantee perfection, you are
liable to be much happier than if this realization comes
after your efforts, or not at all.
Not being able to attain perfection should never be an
excuse for not trying.
It would be very easy, after the last election in which
the G.O.P strengthened its hold on power, for those who
lean left to fade into the first approach. Of course the ap-

athy approach all of a sudden looks much more attractive
to those dedicated campaigners who took time off work
to go to Ohio and walk precincts or monitor polls in New
Mexico — only to leave empty-handed.
There are some who say that there is nothing more in
vigorating than working fora losing cause. These people
have obviously never won. Trust me, winning is much
better.
The apathy approach will not make you happier. It
clashes with the fundamental basic human needs of
achievement and self-actualization that Abraham Maslow
hypothesized 50 years ago (look him up, he's brilliant).
Don't believe me? Sit on the couch fora week, then a
month, maybe even a year. Then, if you can remember
how to walk, get up and go get a job fora week, see if you
can hold it fora month and stretch that into a year. Then
write and tell me which made you happier.
The underlying point here is that even once you real
ize that all of your efforts may be in vain, you will still be
better off having tried.
Michael Jordan once said that you miss 1(H) percent
of the shots you don't take. Well, in reality, even the
maestro himself missed 50.3 percent of the shots that he
did take. Do you think he would have been better off
staying at home?
Whatever your political creed, do not let losing be an
excuse for giving up. The system is designed for there to
be a winner and a loser, and sometimes the winner is just
not going to be you. This message is often lost in the
Stanford world where "win or else," more often than
not, is the motto.
The day we give up is the day that we start the long de
volution back to from whence we came. And if you've
read as many history books as I have, I'm not sure that's a
place we want to go.
