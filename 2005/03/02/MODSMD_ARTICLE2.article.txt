### XIN XIE STAFF WRITER 
Criticizing U.S. leaders for the improper handling of the
current war on terror, Michael Scheuer, senior intelligence of
ficial and author of "Imperial Hubris: Why the West is Losing
the War on Terror," spoke yesterday at the Bookstore at an
event sponsored by the Coalition of Justice in the Middle East.
Scheuer argued that rather than trying to impose democra
cy overseas, the U.S. government should encourage democra
tic discussions within America itself.
"Our democracy was meant to be an example, not an in
strument of imposing power," Scheuer said. "Now other na
tions cannot distinguish between an American founder and an
Atlantic flounder."
However, according to Scheuer, even America is in need of
more democratic discussion and practice.
"America is in more need of a shot of democracy today be
cause the parties are not addressing the issue that motivates the
enemy," Scheuer said.
Scheuer also mentioned the inaccuracy of intelligence that
is given to the president. He explained that George Tenet and
John Deutsch, the most recent directors of the Central Intelli
gence Agency, appointed themselves chief briefers to the pres
idents they served — even though more specialized intelli-

policy yesterday at the Bookstore.
gence experts traditionally provided
these briefs. The directors were not
certain thai sources of information on
terrorist networks and actions were
absolutely reliable, he added.
"Most of the information came
from opposition groups who were
seeking to convince us to action."
Scheuer said, adding that these
sources were not reliable.
"If we continue our current ways, I
think we will be much worse at the end
of the term," Scheuer said.
He said that the war is nol about
terrorism, but rather about an insur
gency rising up against a larger
power.
On a side note, Scheuer mentioned
that Osama Bin Laden had been trying
to justify his killings, speaking directly
to all Americans on four occasions.
However, only one ol these tapes was
released to the general public.
"The Prophet Muhammad said
that not only must an attack be justi
fied, but that before attacking you
must warn the enemy and mve them

the chance to convert," Scheuer said.
"Therefore, Bin Laden offered Amer
icans a chance to convert to Islam in
three of the videotapes."
Scheuer said students should
keep abreast of events and under
stand the many sides of a story in
order to truly comprehend the cur
rent war on terror.
"Students should read all sides of
stories, especially the non-mainstream
sources such as blogs and the papers
about Bin Laden," he said.
Many students said the speaker
event gave them new perspective on
the issues involved.
"I agreed with Scheuer that the re
taliation by the Middle Eastern citi
zens is due more to their love for their
culture than their hatred toward the
Americans," said sophomore Omar
Shakir, president of the Coalition of
Justice in the Middle East.
Junior Eric Friedman, a member of
the Public Policy Forum of Stanford in
Government, also said he thought that
Scheuer's views helped to provoke
new modes of thinking.
"Right now, the debate is very so
lidified and Scheuer created a differ
ent perspective on the insurgency and
discussed implications not commonly
discussed." Friedman said.
