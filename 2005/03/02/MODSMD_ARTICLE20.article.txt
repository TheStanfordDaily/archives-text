# Techie Repairs the World
## Incubating Roe 
### 
Every year. Washington. D.C., my hometown, hosts
the annual Kinht to Life march. And every year a con-

tingent of my school would get a day
off to go attend. Personally, I never
went, because I found school more in
teresting than standing around in 40
degree weather watching a guy play
the guitar with his feet. But all this
hue and cry did make me realize one
thing: A lot of people kind of think
that killing fetuses is a bit distasteful.
Then again, a lot of people also
think that it's good for women to have

control over their bodies. The problem is that these two
genteel opinions conflict whenever we come to the topic of
abortion. Thus, America has been subjected to one huge,
God-awful war for the last 30 years. No one's mind has
been changed and really, I'm a bit sick of it.
So perhaps, instead of hashing and rehashing the
same arguments over and over, we should think of an al
together new solution. Is it not possible fora woman to
maintain control over her body without killing whatever
human life-forms may be in residence at any given time?
I believe so. Over the past century the point in the
pregnancy at which a baby is viable outside the womb
has steadily grown earlier. Though there are risks, babies
can be born at 22 weeks and survive (with proper medi
cal care). However there seems to be no scientific reason
why a child could not be carried to term outside the
womb from the very moment of conception onwards.
The problems involved are purely those of engineering.
Perhaps the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on
lobbying for and against abortion every year could be
better put towards finding a safe procedure for extract

ing the fetus or zygote from the womb and placing it in an
incubator-like machine in which it could grow safely and
happily for nine months.
Abortion could then be made illegal once more, and
this procedure could be subsidized by the government
for those mothers who cannot afford it. Wealthier moth
ers would have to pay as much of the cost of the proce
dure and upkeep of the body as they could afford, much
in the same way as unwilling fathers are forced to pay
child support. This way women could rid themselves of
unwanted pregnancies without killing a proto-human.
The children, once they are old enough to "born,"
could be put up for adoption. Considering the huge de
mand for infants in the adoption market, it is not unrea
sonable to believe that many or all of them could be
adopted. After all. although there are many hundreds of
thousands of abortions in this country each year, there
are also hundreds of thousands of in vitro fertilizations
and other fertility procedures done on women who want
children. And perhaps the knowledge that unwanted
children could not be shed like pounds of extra flesh, but
would grow to maturity somewhere would discourage
unwanted pregnancies in the first place.
This solution is not perfect. There is the possibility of
massive cost on the part of the government. But it is bet
ter than what we have now. Both rights, the right to pri
vacy and the right to life, are preserved. Neither side im
poses its ideology on the other. And then we can all start
arguing with each other and protesting over some other
arcane civil right.

Under no circumstances will Rahul Kanakia ever yet an
abortion. If your parents didn 't abort you, e-mail him at
