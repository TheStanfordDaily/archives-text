## Sustainability at Stanford 
### ERIN GAINES, DIMITRI DADIOMOV, JOHN CONLEY BRIAN PAYER 
Stanford has taken important
steps towards becoming a world
leader in sustainability and environ
mental issues. The Global Climate
and Energy Project, or GCEP,
which recently sponsored $9 million
in projects, and the new Institute for
the Environment are evidence of the
University administration's commit
ment to environmental research.
Students are taking action through a
wide variety of sustainability-fo
cused campus groups, such as Stu
dents fora Sustainable Stanford and
Students for Environmental Justice
at Stanford, and by applying their
studies to solve environmental prob
lems.
But to present a truly compre
hensive commitment to sustainabili
ty and set a world-leading example,
Stanford needs to fully integrate the
ideas and technologies that are the
subject of its research into the way it
builds and maintains the campus.
Progress is being made. In 2002,
the University adopted the Guide
lines for Sustainable Building, a
comprehensive framework designed
to incorporate environmental im
pacts into the building process at
Stanford. The recently revealed
plans for the new Science and Engi
neering Quad feature sustainability
as a priority. The Guidelines, how
ever, are just that. Until they are
made into requirements, they run
the risk of being ignored. The plans
for the Munger Housing Unit and

the renovation of the Old Union, for
example, needed a stronger commit
ment to sustainability from the early
planning stages onward. If the
Munger Housing planners had fol
lowed the Guidelines, recent com
munity concerns about size, natural
daylighting, water and energy usage,
construction waste and interior air
quality would have been taken into
account from the beginning.
We need to build on our success
es and address our failures. The Uni
versity needs to adopt the Guide
lines as rules that apply to all new
buildings on campus, and keep these
rules current as sustainable building
technologies develop. Individually,
one can contribute by simply being
more energy conscious (did you
leave the lights on?) or by being
aware of how and where your food
was grown (choosing locally grown,
organic foods in the dining hall). Stu
dents must continue to support cur
rent initiatives and, more important
ly, generate new and more ambi
tious ideas.
The campus we build today will
undoubtedly reflect the world of to
morrow, and our graduates will have
great influence in shaping that
world. Stanford has a tremendous
reputation for excellence in aca
demics, athletics and research. No
effort should be spared in adding
sustainability to the list.
