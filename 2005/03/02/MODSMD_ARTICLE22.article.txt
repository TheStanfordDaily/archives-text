## Why gender GERs matter 
### JULIE PARK 
It's a shame that the new Gener
al Education Requirement, or
GER, system makes it possible for
students to graduate without taking
a class on gender. It's a shame that
students will he able to leave college
without increased awareness on the
common assumptions society holds
about what a man and woman can
and cannot be.
As a woman, I can tell you that
life is vastly different for men. If
you're a man, your mom won't insist
that you wear a dress to your birth
day party just because every other
boy does. Your mother won't refuse
to buy you a Power Wheels using
price as an excuse, only to give you
an equally expensive kitchen set
when you turn four to innocently in
duct you into domesticity. You wear
khakis and polo shirts to your piano
recitals, not linen sundresses and
ballet flats that make your foot slip
off the pedal when you perform.
As you grow older, becoming a
teenager, it's okay for you to be the
rambunctious class clown. Nearby,
girls sit, composed. You get to wear
comfortable t-shirts and long shorts
all the time. You don't need to learn
how to apply makeup, and no one
suggests you try it. While YM, Sev
enteen, CosmoGirl and Jane fill
racks at every grocery store, there
are no magazines targeted for you.
You might read Sports Illustrated
and Maxim, but those magazines are
not specified for your age group. If
they teach you how to "be" a boy, it
is by inducting you into the world of
sports and encouraging you to see
women as sexy objects. You are not
objectified in tight pants and stiletto
heels, the modern version of bound
feet. In college, you sometimes tell
girls who say they don't know what
to do with their lives that they can al
ways just get married for financial
security.
Society doesn't make you quite as
neurotic as it does your mom or sis
ter. You're twice as unlikely to get
depressed. One in five boys aren't
bulimic, and millions of guys don't
have breast implants. But if you were
a female who did opt for implants,
you'd also be two to three times more
likely to commit suicide than other
women. Perhaps your male psyche is
not quite as shaken as a girl's.
1 know from experience how psy
chologically detrimental being fe
male in this world can be. At age 14
I ate an apple for lunch every day. I
wore uncomfortable high heels
every day. I woke up early to blow
dry my hair. As an un-self-conscious
consumer of clothes, makeup and
girl-dom, I was consumed. I was
mired in a trap common to girls, and
although I eventually pulled myself
out of it — I quit drying my hair and
began wearing sneakers every day

— the destructive messages sent via
society continue to screw up women.
While my parents never coerced me
into getting double-eyelid surgery as
one of my Asian-American friend's
parents did to her last year (because
they honestly believed she'd look
prettier to men and therefore she
would have an easier time marrying
— which is apparently the ideal
goal). The important thing is that
now I'm aware and conscious of —
and far more resistant to — social
and cultural brainwashing than I was
when I was 14.
Thankfully I came to Stanford
and took social science classes on
gender, classes that exposed me to
studies that articulated the suspi
cions in my head with clarity.
Thankfully Stanford makes us —
or used to make us — all take at
least one class on gender. As you
might guess from the rates of eating
disorders, growing up as a girl in
America can be brainwashingly
powerful and psychologically detri
mental.
It was only after I took a gender
GER class called "Language and
Gender" at Stanford that I realized
how unconscious most people, and
even some Stanford students, are
about gender issues in America.
That's why it's a shame that stu
dents do not and will not have to
take a class on gender issues. Stu
dents can graduate as unaware of
what it means to grow up female as
they were when they arrived on
campus. Students need the gender
GER, not only to consider how gen
der myths infiltrate the way we see
the world, but so that we will learn
about gender as it relates to the ex
perience of living in today's world in
the form of magazines, ads, televi
sion, toys, music, etc. Shouldn't
Stanford students have some under
standing of why it is that eating dis
orders and over-exercising at
Tresidder are so common that we all
probably know someone who has
these problems? Awareness of how
one "becomes" a woman or a man in
society gives you the power to rec
ognize unhealthy social messages, to
see through cultural myths and to
think independently about self and
society.
By creating a GER in gender
studies, Stanford should be applaud
ed for recognizing the significance of
gender in our lives. Like myths of
race and class, gender myths have
the power to distort our psyches and
mislead male and female minds with
cultural myths. But to have a GER
in gender studies isn't enough if stu
dents don't have to take it. The old
and new GER requirements fail to
provide students with the education
they should all have.
