## Right in the babymaker March Madness prompts rant 
### 
Thank God March is finally here. The ap
pearance of NASCAR on the cover of
last week's Sports Illustrated made me
question the existence of God in the dark
sports famine that is February. And is the Day
tona 500 really the Great American Race? I al
ways thought that race involved Ryan Leaf
and Kwame Brown speeding toward the edge
of the earth to see who would fall off first.
So the Warriors picked up Baron Davis,
who is sure to pull a Roy Hobbs and turn an

atrocious 16-40 team around.
As soon as his back collapses,
we'll be one week closer to a
Fox Sports Net "Sports List"
on "Worst Career Moves"
topped by Mike Mont
gomery leaving Stanford.
Speaking of "Sports List,"
does Summer Sanders regret

just expanded beneath his skin. I'm waiting for
his skull to pop out the back of his helmet after
he hits a 600-foot home run in spring training.
Temple coach John Chaney is the ugliest
man alive who doesn't have either massive
burn scars or a syndrome named after him. If
he ever gets inducted into the Basketball Hall
of Fame (which is unlikely after this week's de
bacle. in which he allegedly ordered a player to
injure an opponent) they should put a paper
bag over his head in his bust.
Did anyone think we would be hearing Jose
Canseco's name as much as we have in the past
month without also hearing something like
"cocaine possession," "commits suicide" or
"holds up convenience store?"
After it came out that Canseco has been re
ceiving death threats as a result of his book, his
attorney let us know that "he's a black belt in
three different kinds of karate, so he can take
