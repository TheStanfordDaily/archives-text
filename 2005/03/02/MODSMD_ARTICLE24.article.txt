## Right in the babymaker March Madness prompts rant 
### 
Thank God March is finally here. The ap
pearance of NASCAR on the cover of
last week's Sports Illustrated made me
question the existence of God in the dark
sports famine that is February. And is the Day
tona 500 really the Great American Race? I al
ways thought that race involved Ryan Leaf
and Kwame Brown speeding toward the edge
of the earth to see who would fall off first.
So the Warriors picked up Baron Davis,
who is sure to pull a Roy Hobbs and turn an

atrocious 16-40 team around.
As soon as his back collapses,
we'll be one week closer to a
Fox Sports Net "Sports List"
on "Worst Career Moves"
topped by Mike Mont
gomery leaving Stanford.
Speaking of "Sports List,"
does Summer Sanders regret
her career choices? I bet she
lies awake at night saying, "1

went to Stanford! I have two Olympic gold
medals! And 1 work for the same network as
Tom Arnold!"
Does anyone realistically doubt that Barry
Bonds has taken steroids? Watching his inter
view last week, I noticed that his forehead
doesn't wrinkle when he raises his eyebrows -
it's just completely taut all the way across, like
the surface of a Mylar balloon. It's like his head
just expanded beneath his skin. I'm waiting for
his skull to pop out the back of his helmet after
he hits a 600-foot home run in spring training.
Temple coach John Chaney is the ugliest
man alive who doesn't have either massive
burn scars or a syndrome named after him. If
he ever gets inducted into the Basketball Hall
of Fame (which is unlikely after this week's de
bacle. in which he allegedly ordered a player to
injure an opponent) they should put a paper
bag over his head in his bust.
Did anyone think we would be hearing Jose
Canseco's name as much as we have in the past
month without also hearing something like
"cocaine possession," "commits suicide" or
"holds up convenience store?"
After it came out that Canseco has been re
ceiving death threats as a result of his book, his
attorney let us know that "he's a black belt in
three different kinds of karate, so he can take


Dan McCarthy
Kobe a character witness for M.J.?

carc of himself." The logical next
step for Jose's career, then, is to star
as the Shaolin master in Bloodsport
K. or whatever they're up to now.
Remember when Bill Simmons
wrote about sports? It bothers me
that there's a thirtysomething mar
ried guy out there who religiously
watches "The OC." Also, if you've
ever seen him on TV (for which you
would have to be watching VHI.
since he appears on "1 Love the 90s"
with more frequency than he does on
ESPN), you know he looks the part.
1 bet Mischa Barton has nightmares
about his face.
The only thing more depressing
than the 49ers' 2-14 record last sea
son is the fact that they might end up
drafting Aaron Rodgers with the
No. 1 pick. Giving Aaron Rodgers
the "No. 1 overall" tag is like a pro
ducer looking at Tim Allen and say
ing, "If my life depended on the suc
cess of this movie. I want that guy to
be the star." Wait, 1 forgot some
thing more depressing: both of the
Niners' wins were against the Cardi
nals. In overtime.

Kobe Bryant's career downfall is
made even better by the fact that
he's been listed as a potential charac
ter witness in Michael Jackson's
trial. If you want someone vouching
that you're a good person, it's defi
nitely a philanderer and potential
rapist. From Kobe's perspective,
too. if you're looking to turn around
your public image, the first thing you
want is for people to know you know
Michael Jackson. Seriously, try to
think of a celebrity who would make
you look at someone differently just
for knowing that person. 1 think if
one of my friends said he'd met
Michael Jackson 1 would have ques
tioned our relationship just because
they were in the same place at the
same time, and if he admitted to ask
ing Michael for an autograph. I'd just
cut all ties to the guy and burn what 1
was wearing the last three times I
talked to him.
West Coast basketball has really
taken a hit this year. Realistically,
the Pac-10 deserves two teams in the
NCAA Tournament, and it's entire
ly possible that there will be only one

team from California in the entire
field (Pacific). That means the city of
Stockton would be better at some
thing than the Bay Area and L.A.
combined, which hasn't happened ..
. well. ever, unless you're counting
gang-related murders per capita.
When 1 saw the headline "Knicks
avoid calamity" the other day, I
thought maybe general manager
Isiah Thomas had been run over by a
truck and narrowly missed regaining
higher brain function. Turns out the
headline referred to their third
straight win. which ties their season
best streak.
You've been great; I'll be here all
week. And since next week spring
training opens in earnest and the
March Madness picture will be much
less fuzzy next week. I promise to
provide you with columns that have
things like a clear point. And an end
ing.
