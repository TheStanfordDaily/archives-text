# Men's swimming seeks conference title
## 
### SAMUEL CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the diving portion settled, the rest
of the No. 3. Stanford men's swimming and
diving team (6-1,3-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
is set to take to the pool in its first postsea
son meet of the year. Starting today, the
Cardinal men will seek to extend their reign
of supremacy over the Pac-10 Conference to
one year short of a quarter century.
At the conference's swimming champi
onships, held through Saturday at the Bel
mont Plaza Olympic Pool in Long Beach.
Calif., five strong west coast contenders will

make their best attempts to stand in the way
of Stanford's way. Among these competi
tors will be three top-10 ranked programs,
including No. 1 California (9-0, 4-0), which
became the first team to defeat Stanford in a
dual-meet in over four years two weeks ago.
No. 8 Arizona (5-4,2-3) and No. 9 Southern
California (4-3,2-2).
While counted in Saturday's final point
tally for the men, the Pac-10 Diving Cham
pionships have already been completed,
having taken place in conjunction with the
women's conference championship meet at
the King County Aquatics Center in Feder
al Way, Wash., last weekend.

While the highest finish by a Cardinal
diver in any of the three events - one-meter
springboard, three-meter springboard and
the platform - was a fourth-place finish by
senior Jesse Fonner on the platform compe
tition, the team's combined effort produced
the second highest point total of the meet.
Only outdone by a USC squad that com
bined for 142 points. Stanford finished the
meet with 110 points, which will be built
upon by the swimmers.
As the most experienced of the Stanford
divers, Fonner said he believes that this
Stanford unit has improved greatly.
"[Head Diving Coach] Rick [Schavone]

instituted a new training regimen in the fall
and it seems to be paying off," Fonner said.
"The entire team is training and performing
better than in previous years."
In the diving championships Fonner led
the team with a fifth-place finish in the one
meter. In the same event, sophomore Kevin
McLean also advanced to the finals, finish
ing eighth. In the three-meter event,
McLean, freshman Nathan Kim and Fonner
finished seventh, eighth and ninth, respec
tively.
"It is always great to compete against the

best," McLean said. "As there is so
much talent in Pac-10 diving, I feel
privileged to have the opportunity
to dive against some of the best in
the nation and the world."
Entering the swimming portion
of the meet, the Cardinal men are
rested, which senior co-captain
Jayme Cramer cited as one of Stan
ford's keys to success.
"Staying relaxed and confident is
the key to us swimming fast at Pac
10s and NCA As," Cramer said. "We
all know that we have put in the
work to be successful. It is just a mat
ter of execution and doing what we
know we are capable of doing."
In last year's meet, Stanford set a
Pac-10 record for points with 866.5,
while California put up a fight with
extremely strong relays to finish
with 773 points. Arizona and USC
took the next two finishes, with
522.5 and 505 points, respectively,
while Arizona State and Washing
ton rounded out the field with 407
and 299 points.
All but one of the four individual
wins by the Cardinal, however, came
from now-graduated seniors
Markus Rogan and Peter Marshall.
Cramer, who took first in the 2(H)
butterfly in 2004's championship
meet, is the lone remaining Pac-10
individual champion. However,
with the strong times turned in by
underclassmen and seniors alike this
year, the Cardinal have reason to
believe they have a good shot at rais
ing their conference title streak to an
even 24.
The team has always been the
focus over the individual for the
Cardinal.
"We are like a brotherhood
which nobody can break down."
freshman Peter Carothers said. "It
will come down to beating the guy in
the lane next to you for that extra
point for the sake of the team. Since
we all believe in each other to do
that, we will be the best team in the
Pac-10."
Overall, there is a sense of opti
mism as the Cardinal swimmers
head down to Long Beach.
"We are rested, we are shaved and
we are ready to go fora 24th title,"
sophomore Kyle Ransom said.
A strong showing at the meet will
likely provide the Cardinal even
more opportunities to show the na
tion their abilities at the NCAA
Championships, scheduled to take
place from March 24 to 26 in Min
neapolis, Minn.

tally for the men, the Pac-10 Diving Cham
pionships have already been completed,
having taken place in conjunction with the
women's conference championship meet at
the King County Aquatics Center in Feder
al Way, Wash., last weekend.

While the highest finish by a Cardinal
diver in any of the three events - one-meter
springboard, three-meter springboard and
the platform - was a fourth-place finish by
senior Jesse Fonner on the platform compe
tition, the team's combined effort produced
the second highest point total of the meet.
Only outdone by a USC squad that com
bined for 142 points. Stanford finished the
meet with 110 points, which will be built
upon by the swimmers.
As the most experienced of the Stanford
divers, Fonner said he believes that this
Stanford unit has improved greatly.
"[Head Diving Coach] Rick [Schavone]

instituted a new training regimen in the fall
and it seems to be paying off," Fonner said.
"The entire team is training and performing
better than in previous years."
In the diving championships Fonner led
the team with a fifth-place finish in the one
meter. In the same event, sophomore Kevin
McLean also advanced to the finals, finish
ing eighth. In the three-meter event,
McLean, freshman Nathan Kim and Fonner
finished seventh, eighth and ninth, respec
tively.
"It is always great to compete against the

best," McLean said. "As there is so
much talent in Pac-10 diving, I feel
privileged to have the opportunity
to dive against some of the best in
the nation and the world."
Entering the swimming portion
of the meet, the Cardinal men are
rested, which senior co-captain
Jayme Cramer cited as one of Stan
ford's keys to success.
"Staying relaxed and confident is
the key to us swimming fast at Pac
10s and NCA As," Cramer said. "We
all know that we have put in the
work to be successful. It is just a mat
ter of execution and doing what we
know we are capable of doing."
In last year's meet, Stanford set a
Pac-10 record for points with 866.5,
while California put up a fight with
extremely strong relays to finish
with 773 points. Arizona and USC
took the next two finishes, with
522.5 and 505 points, respectively,
while Arizona State and Washing
ton rounded out the field with 407
and 299 points.
All but one of the four individual
wins by the Cardinal, however, came
from now-graduated seniors
Markus Rogan and Peter Marshall.
Cramer, who took first in the 2(H)
butterfly in 2004's championship
meet, is the lone remaining Pac-10
individual champion. However,
with the strong times turned in by
underclassmen and seniors alike this
year, the Cardinal have reason to
believe they have a good shot at rais
ing their conference title streak to an
even 24.
The team has always been the
focus over the individual for the
Cardinal.
"We are like a brotherhood
which nobody can break down."
freshman Peter Carothers said. "It
will come down to beating the guy in
the lane next to you for that extra
point for the sake of the team. Since
we all believe in each other to do
that, we will be the best team in the
Pac-10."
Overall, there is a sense of opti
mism as the Cardinal swimmers
head down to Long Beach.
"We are rested, we are shaved and
we are ready to go fora 24th title,"
sophomore Kyle Ransom said.
A strong showing at the meet will
likely provide the Cardinal even
more opportunities to show the na
tion their abilities at the NCAA
Championships, scheduled to take
place from March 24 to 26 in Min
neapolis, Minn.
With the diving portion settled, the rest
of the No. 3. Stanford men's swimming and
diving team (6-1,3-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
is set to take to the pool in its first postsea
son meet of the year. Starting today, the
Cardinal men will seek to extend their reign
of supremacy over the Pac-10 Conference to
one year short of a quarter century.
At the conference's swimming champi
onships, held through Saturday at the Bel
mont Plaza Olympic Pool in Long Beach.
Calif., five strong west coast contenders will

make their best attempts to stand in the way
of Stanford's way. Among these competi
tors will be three top-10 ranked programs,
including No. 1 California (9-0, 4-0), which
became the first team to defeat Stanford in a
dual-meet in over four years two weeks ago.
No. 8 Arizona (5-4,2-3) and No. 9 Southern
California (4-3,2-2).
