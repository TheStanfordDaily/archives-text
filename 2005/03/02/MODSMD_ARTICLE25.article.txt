## 
### SAMUEL CHEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the diving portion settled, the rest
of the No. 3. Stanford men's swimming and
diving team (6-1,3-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
is set to take to the pool in its first postsea
son meet of the year. Starting today, the
Cardinal men will seek to extend their reign
of supremacy over the Pac-10 Conference to
one year short of a quarter century.
At the conference's swimming champi
onships, held through Saturday at the Bel
mont Plaza Olympic Pool in Long Beach.
Calif., five strong west coast contenders will

make their best attempts to stand in the way
of Stanford's way. Among these competi
tors will be three top-10 ranked programs,
including No. 1 California (9-0, 4-0), which
became the first team to defeat Stanford in a
dual-meet in over four years two weeks ago.
No. 8 Arizona (5-4,2-3) and No. 9 Southern
California (4-3,2-2).
While counted in Saturday's final point
tally for the men, the Pac-10 Diving Cham
pionships have already been completed,
having taken place in conjunction with the
women's conference championship meet at
the King County Aquatics Center in Feder
al Way, Wash., last weekend.

While the highest finish by a Cardinal
diver in any of the three events - one-meter
springboard, three-meter springboard and
the platform - was a fourth-place finish by
senior Jesse Fonner on the platform compe
tition, the team's combined effort produced
the second highest point total of the meet.
Only outdone by a USC squad that com
bined for 142 points. Stanford finished the
meet with 110 points, which will be built
upon by the swimmers.
As the most experienced of the Stanford
divers, Fonner said he believes that this
Stanford unit has improved greatly.
"[Head Diving Coach] Rick [Schavone]

instituted a new training regimen in the fall
and it seems to be paying off," Fonner said.
"The entire team is training and performing
better than in previous years."
In the diving championships Fonner led
the team with a fifth-place finish in the one
meter. In the same event, sophomore Kevin
McLean also advanced to the finals, finish
ing eighth. In the three-meter event,
McLean, freshman Nathan Kim and Fonner
finished seventh, eighth and ninth, respec
tively.
"It is always great to compete against the

The Cardinal will have a chance to avenge their loss to No. 1 California, 129-114. The team finished second at the Pac-10 diving championships last weekend.
