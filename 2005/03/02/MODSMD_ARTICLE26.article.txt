# Men's gym falls to Michigan
## 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's gymnastics
team suffered a difficult 221.2-
214.75 loss at N0.5 Michigan last
weekend. But upon its return from
Ann Arbor, the No. 10 Cardinal
seem optimistic.
"It really wasn't as bad as the num
bers reflect," head coach Thom Gliel
mi said.
The Cardinal's poorest perfor
mance of the night came in their first
event, pommel horse.

"The men really woke up after
that and the meet was fun," Glielmi
said.
The pommel horse lineup is
young, consisting of four freshmen
and two sophomores. Part of the
problem was that no one has really
emerged to hold the pommel horse
team together.
"[Brice] Rolston, [ChrisJ Harper
and [Sho] Nakamori are extremely
consistent in practice but they just
haven't quite gotten there in meets,"
Glielmi said.
The team rebounded to perform

well on the other events. On the vault,
the Cardinal earned a 36.425, which
meant that they averaged about a
nine. Only five Stanford gymnasts
performed the event because Glielmi
pulled sophomore Alex Schorsch.
who was suffering back problems.
Freshman Chris Harper had a good
vault with an 8.85.
Freshman Sho Nakamori is also
starting to emerge as a major scoring
threat for Stanford. He hit four of his
six routines, and threw up a 54 in the
All-Around. He scored a 9.425 on
floor exercise and a 9.55 on parallel
bars. With this score, he should be a
contender in the All-Around compe
tition in the NCAAs.
"He could be at a 56-plus, but this
is a big order fora freshman," Glielmi
said. "I just hope he has the confi
dence to know that he is capable."
Freshman David Sender did not
compete for the Cardinal against the
Wolverines because he was invited to
compete in the American Cup, the
most prestigious international gym
nastics competition in the United
States. He finaled on rings and also
did well on the vault, earning fifth
place.
Sender forms a crucial presence
on the rings team, but the team rose
to the plate in his absence, earning a
37.1 on the event. Glielmi hopes that
with Sender's return, the rings team
will notch it up to at least a 38.
Several team members returned
sick from Michigan.
"This is not the most opportune
time," Glielmi said.
Despite this hurdle, the Cardinal
have returned to practice in prepara
tion for the double-header this week
end.
This Thursday, the Cardinal travel
to Los Angeles for the Peter Vidmar
Invitational at 7:30 p.m. This counts
as a collegiate meet, but it is an open
invitation that includes international
competitors. In addition to the Cardi
nal, Air Force and Cal will be in at
tendance. Glielmi said he is planning
on changing up the lineup to maxi
mize the number of guys he has com
peting.
"It should be a really great meet,"
Glielmi said.
The Cardinal barely get time to
breathe because they return to the
Farm on Sunday for the last home
meet of the season against No. 8 Cal
ifornia at 2 p.m. The Gold Game is a
co-ed meet, featuring both the men's
and women's gymnastics teams.
