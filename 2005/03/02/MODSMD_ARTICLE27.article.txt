### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
Captains Matt Gentry and Imad Kharbush fought
hard on the mat but fell just short of defending their Pa
cific* 10 Conference wrestling titles at the conference
tournament in San Luis Obispo, Calif., last weekend, fin
ishing second and third, respectively. Each of their quests
fora title was cut short in dramatic fashion as their oppo
nents delivered the match-clinching moves in the waning
seconds of the bouts. Both, however, qualified for the
NCAA tournament.
As a team, the Cardinal (6-7-1,2-5-1 Pac-10) did not
perform as well as they had hoped to, earning 48.5 team
points and finishing ninth in a field of 10 teams. Stanford
finished ahead of only Portland State (2-17,0-9), which
had 26 points. No. 21 Arizona State (11-6-1, 8-0), the
heavy favorite coming into the championships, capped
off its perfect dual season against the conference by win
ning the tournament with 106 points.
The Cardinal sent 10 wrestlers, one from each weight
class, to Cal Poly (5-12, 1-5). Four of the 10 wrestlers
placed, led by their two captains.
Kharbush, a 174-pound junior, was the third seed in
his weight class for the second year in a row. He won his
first match against Arizona State's Rick Renzi by a 6-2
decision to start his attempt at a title defense. His next
bout was a tight contest against Leonel Sanchez from Cal
State-Bakersfield, as both wrestlers earned an escape
and were tied 1-1 at the end of regulation. Sanchez
earned a one-point escape to take the victory in the extra
frame, and he eventually won the Pac-10 crown.
After his loss, Kharbush needed to win the consola
tion bracket to earn an automatic NCAA bid. He de

feated Oregon's Chet McBee in a 5-3 decision to enter a
rematch against Ron Silva from UC-Davis. Silva had
earned the top ranking in the tournament by beating
Kharbush in the last meet of the season. The Cardinal
captain exacted revenge via a 12-5 decision to seal up
third place and a NCAA bid.
Gentry entered as the top seed in the 157-pound
weight class. Stanford's most decorated wrestler had
only lost one match in the past two seasons, and it showed
in his first two matches. The senior dismantled his first
opponent, Jesse Padillaof UC-Davis, with a 19-1 techni
cal fall. C'al Sate-Bakersfield's Brian Busby was the next
to fall as Gentry coasted to a 15-7 major decision in the
semifinals.
Gentry, who won the National Championship last
year, was matched up against a familiar foe. Brian Stith
of Arizona State, in the finals. The Stanford senior had
defeated Stith three times already this season, including
a 6-3 decision in the California Open, a 2-1 overtime
thriller in the Tournament of Champions and a 4-1 deci
sion in a dual meet.
But Stith would not be thwarted in his fourth attempt
to knock off the defending NCAA champion. After a
scoreless first period of action. Gentry took bottom posi
tion to start the second and earned an escape to get on the
board. Stith countered with an escape in the third and the
match looked destined for overtime, yet with six seconds
left in regulation Stith was able to earn a takedown and
win the championship match, 3-1. Gentry's second place
finish earns him a spot in the NCAA tournament as well.
Two other Cardinal wrestlers made it to the second
day of wrestling and placed in the top six. Senior 125-
nounder Nathan Peterson went 2-2 on the weekend after

dropping his first match by a 14-5
major decision. Peterson claimed
fifth place with a 9-3 decision win over
Oregon State's Eric Stevenson.
Junior Ryan Hagen went 2-3 in the
184-pound class. Hagen also lost his
first match, a tight 2-1 decision to Cal
Poly's Ryan Halsey. He earned a pin
in the consolation bracket over Scott
Rear from Cal State-Bakersfield and
took sixth place when he lost his re
match against Halsey, 4-3.
The Cardinal will now send their
two captains to St. Louis, Mo., for
competition March 17 to 19 for indi
vidual NCAA titles. The tournament
marks the last collegiate wrestling for
Gentry, who will try to become the
first back-to-back NCAA champion
in school history.
The Cardinal will hope to build on
the experience that the talented
youth on the team gained this season.
Despite graduating two place-win
ners. Stanford will have Kharbush
and Hagen next season. Freshman
contributors Josh Zupancic and
Rafael Chaves will also return to the
lineup with greater experience.
