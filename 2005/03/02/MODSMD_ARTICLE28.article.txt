# Cardinal place seventh at Ashworth Invite
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a tough final round at this
week's Ashworth Invitational, the
Stanford men's golf team took sev
enth place with a three-round total
of 880, while freshman Rob Grube
led the way with a 22nd place finish
individually, firing a 218.
No. 21 Tennessee held off No. 10
Brigham Young by two strokes in a
photo finish for the team champi
onship. In the individual competi
tion, Georgia Southern Ail-Ameri
can Aron Price destroyed the field
with a 10-under-par 203, winning
medalist honors by five shots.
Formerly the Cleveland Golf
Classic, the 54-hole event took
place at the par-71 6,742-yard
North Ranch Country Club in
Westlake Village, Calif. Hosted by
No. 8 Southern California, compe
tition was scheduled for 36 holes
Monday followed by a final round
of 18 on Tuesday.
In characteristic fashion, the
Cardinal put themselves in a hole
early Monday morning, carding a
rather pedestrian 299 (15 over par)
in their opening round. Both the
Stanford men and women have
struggled to post low numbers in
their first rounds this year. In the
case of the men, first-round scores
have been an average of three
strokes worse than those in any
other round.
"1 don't think there's a rhyme or
reason for [slow starts]." coach
Conrad Ray said. "We made some
mistakes early and started on some
tough holes, but we fought back
after that."
Indeed, as they have all year, the
Cardinal came back with a
vengeance in the afternoon round.
While the entire field improved
by an average of four shots Monday
afternoon. Stanford blew that fig
ure away, shooting a sensational
285 (one over par). With that tidy
bit of work. Stanford climbed five
spots into sole possession of fifth
place with 18 holes remaining.
Sophomore Matthew Savage,
seeing his first action of the spring
season, led the charge for the Car
dinal on the first day. While the rest
of the team had their troubles in the
morning round. Savage was steady,
carding a two-over-par 73. He then
backed it up with an even-par 71 in
the afternoon to stand in a tie for
17th place individually.
Four shots behind Savage were
junior Kyle Gentry and senior Pat

Phillips, whose days were complete
opposites.
Gentry struggled immediately in
the morning, going six over par over
his first five holes and eventually
grinding out a nine-over-par 80 in
his opening round. Yet he showed
up a completely different player for
his second 18 holes, recording a
gutsy three-under-par 68.
"it was a completely opposite
round," Gentry said. "I got a good
thought in my head, and started
playing well, and I just huilt on
that."
Phillips, on the other hand, was a
model of consistency, posting back
to-hack 745. Both players were tied
for 32nd place at Monday's close.
Grube and senior Kevin Blue
rounded out Stanford's scoring on
the first day. Grube bounced back
from a morning 77 with an after
noon 72 and finished a stroke back
of Phillips and Gentry for 35th.
Blue's second round was ruined
by a quadruple-bogey at the par-3
No. 17. He shot 75-78 on Monday
and was tied for 54th.
In position to capture their third
top-five finish of the year, the Car
dinal suffered through a forgettable
18 holes on Tuesday. They posted a
12-over-par 2% and watched Cali
fornia and No. 20 Washington sail
past them with rounds of even-par
284.
"We played really well the first
two rounds," Savage said. "As we
get more experience playing in
tournaments, I think we'll be able
to get some momentum early and
carry that through the rest of the
tournament."
Grube's round was the lone
bright spot for Stanford on Tues
day, as the freshman shot 69 to fin
ish in the top 25 for the fifth time in
seven events. After avoiding big
numbers all tournament. Savage
made his first double-bogey Tues
day, shooting 76 and slipping out of
the top 25 and into a tie for 28th
place.
Gentry also shot 76 in his final
round, sliding back to tie for 43rd.
Phillips stumbled early in his round
with a pair of triple-bogeys in his
first four holes and never recov
ered, shooting 80. He dropped to
52nd place overall. Blue wrapped
up the tournament tied with
Phillips after a final-round 75.
Stanford will return home to
prepare for the bulk of its spring
schedule, beginning with a trip to
Eugene, Ore. for the Oregon Duck
Invitational, March 21 to 22.
