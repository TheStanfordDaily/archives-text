### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Vice Provost of Undergraduate Education John Brav
man on Sunday responded to student criticism of his hous
ing proposal with a detailed e-mail explaining the develop
ment of his ideas and outlining ways to engage students in di
cussions about the housing plans.
The message was sent to several University administra
tors, including President John Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy, and to the 71 students who wrote to him about
the housing changes.
The students — many participating in an organized let
ter-writing campaign — had e-mailed Bravman over the
past week, lamenting that they did not have the chance to
provide input before he unveiled his plan.
Since the weekend, Bravman's e-mail has been circulat
ing among other students as well.
Bravman responded that he is eager to work with con
cerned students in the coming months and years to refine the
proposal. Yet. regarding current student involvement, he as
serted in the e-mail that "much of our thinking has been
guided by nothing less."
