### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Vice Provost of Undergraduate Education John Brav
man on Sunday responded to student criticism of his hous
ing proposal with a detailed e-mail explaining the develop
ment of his ideas and outlining ways to engage students in di
cussions about the housing plans.
The message was sent to several University administra
tors, including President John Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy, and to the 71 students who wrote to him about
the housing changes.
The students — many participating in an organized let
ter-writing campaign — had e-mailed Bravman over the
past week, lamenting that they did not have the chance to
provide input before he unveiled his plan.
Since the weekend, Bravman's e-mail has been circulat
ing among other students as well.
Bravman responded that he is eager to work with con
cerned students in the coming months and years to refine the
proposal. Yet. regarding current student involvement, he as
serted in the e-mail that "much of our thinking has been
guided by nothing less."
Bravman explains housing plans

"Each year, some 1.6(H) new students complete the
Freshman Housing Preference form in Approaching
Stanford and almost S.(MH) of you move through the
Housing Draw," Bravman wrote. "Between these two,
we have an enormous database of information that rep
resents student opinion in its clearest form — actions, of
course, speak loudest of all."
Among other things, the proposal would make Wilbur
Hall all-frosh and convert Branner, Toyon and Lagunita
into upperclass housing. Perhaps the most controversial el
ement is the proposal to move Ujamaa. the African-Amer
ican theme dorm, from Lagunita to Florence Moore Hall.
The major goals, Bravman said in a phone interview
with The Daily, are to "unstuff" dormitories so that up
perclassmen don't get stuck in cramped rooms and to
provide more all-frosh housing to meet demand.
Sophomore Faris Mohiuddin. a member of the Un
dergraduate Housing Committee, said Bravman needs
to emphasize that the plans for the housing change are
far from complete. The committee, comprised of under
grads, was formed to give students the opportunity weigh
in on issues related to residence life and policy.
"1 really feel that everyone's concerns are valid and
they need to be voiced, but I don't think people neces
sarily needed to criticize Bravman," Mohiuddin said.
"At this point, this is still very much a proposal. He put it
out there to get student input."
Mohiuddin agreed with Bravman that despite some
strong opposition, there is widespread support among
the student body for the type of changes he proposed.
In the e-mail, Bravman wrote that he would welcome
suggestions on how to improve the aspects of the pro
posal that would impact Ujamaa and other ethnic-theme
dorms. He noted that one member of Stanford's minori
ty community had already come to him with an innova
tive suggestion.
"If. say. we converted some of the one-room doubles
in Okada to singles, we would thereby create some very
desirable singles while decreasing the overall population
of the house and increasing the fraction of students who
really wanted to live in that community." Bravman wrote.
"This is the kind of issue I look forward to discussing with
students and others over the coming months."
Mohiuddin said this exemplifies the type of thinking
students should be doing.
"1 think people should be free to let |Bravman] know

what their qualms are, hut 1 think students should espe
cially think actively about solutions for how to sweeten
the deal for people who are going to he unhappy with the
plan." Mohiuddin said. "If students change their locus to
how to improve housing for everyone within the propos
al. rather than just lighting for the status quo, I think
everyone will stand a better likelihood of getting what
they want."
The co-chairs of the Black Student Union could not
be reached for comment last night. But over the past few
weeks, they and other students active in Stanford's black
community have expressed concern that Bravman s pro
posal poses a serious threat to Ujamaa's future.
If Ujamaa moves to FloMo, those who oppose the
plan contend, it will lose its distinctive character and
decades of tradition. It may also stand to lose meeting
space and become a less cohesive environment.
But even if Ujamaa were to remain in Lag, under
Bravman's proposal, it would be a tour-class island in a
sea of upperclass housing and its freshmen would be left
with the most cramped housing on the campus, the infa
mous Lag mini-doubles.
Bravman said he wishes there were a way to imple
ment the plan without influencing Ujamaa. However, he
wrote that students were wrong to think of the housing
changes as a sign of diminished commitment to ethnic
theme housing at Stanford.
"Permit me to quote from the proposal: 'We not only
affirm, but celebrate, our resolute commitment to a vari
ety of academic, ethnic and programmatic theme hous
es," " Bravman wrote in the e-mail. "What I more clear
ly recognize now. compared to even a few weeks ago, is
the need to deliver both on these words and the overall
goals of our housing proposals."
During the phone interview with The Daily. Bravman
said the housing proposal evolved from asking the ques
tion: "What's the best thing for as many students as pos
sible? Let's come up with a plan driven by numbers only
and then do what we have to do. Well, unfortunately, it
turns out we have a lot of work to do — it's disruptive."
That work will begin in earnest on Monday, when
Bravman is scheduled to meet with leaders from the
ASSU. the BSU and Ujamaa to discuss how to effective
ly solicit student input. In his e-mail. Bravman men
tioned several dates when he has time to meet with vari
ous groups of interested students.
