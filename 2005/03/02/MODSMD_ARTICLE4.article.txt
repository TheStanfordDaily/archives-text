# CAPS tries to meet demand

### SAM FLOAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the last weeks of every quarter, far more stu
dents than usual try to schedule appointments with
Counseling and Psychological Services, or CAPS,
at the Vaden Student Health Center. Yet due to
the program's limited resources, many students
said they have had to wait several weeks for ap
pointments and others complained that they were
referred to off-campus locations to receive treat
ment.
Alejandro Martinez, the director of CAPS, said
that the organization is having difficulties keeping
pace with the influx of patients.
"There are periods in the quarter — such as
right now — in which there are so many requests
from students who want to be seen that it is difficult
to keep up," he said. "We are doing everything pos
sible to give appointments to students and we are
stretching as much as we can to provide additional
appointment hours."
Martinez added that the mission of CAPS is to
be available and provide counseling services to all
undergraduate and graduate students, as well as to
pay close attention to the overall community and
establish a positive framework for students.
He disputed the claim that students have wait
ed up to three weeks for appointments and said
CAPS usually assigns students an appointment
within five days unless it is an emergency. CAPS
also offers crisis counseling every day of the week
for 24 hours a day, in which an on-call clinician is
available to talk to students about their problems
and can even give follow-up recommendations.
Depression is not unique to Stanford students,
said Brent Solvason, assistant professor of psychia
try, stressing that depressions is a problem at many
of the top-ranked schools in the nation where stu-
More students seek counseling services at CAPS

dents have become accustomed to suc
cess.
"Many high-achieving students
come to a competitive environment
and find it hard to rise to the top,"
Solvason said. "This can be very
stressful and requires a lot of adjust
ment."
According to Martinez, national
surveys indicate that 1 percent of col
lege students have seriously consid
ered suicide and that this number is
probably similar at Stanford. Al
though there have not been any dra
matic changes in suicide rates over the
past few years, he said he believes that
this percentage is still significant.
"One percent is still a number for
concern," Martinez said. "This is one
of the reasons why if a student needs to
be seen on an urgent basis we try to see
them."
On average, more than 1.400 stu
dents go to CAPS each year to receive
counseling for issues related to rela
tionships. depression, anxiety and self
esteem.
Martinez said that the number of

students utilizing CAPS services has
increased this year. However, he at
tributed this change to a rise in the
number of students seeking help —
not higher rates of depression on cam
pus.
Nationwide, women are more like
ly to seek help than men. he added.
Both individual and group counsel
ing sessions are offered, and psychia
trists at CAPS are able to prescribe
medication for students.
Martinez said that nationally, the
number of students receiving medica
tion for depression-related disorders
has increased significantly over the
past 10 years.
CAPS does not automatically refer
students to other locations to manage
the overflow of patients, Martinez said.
Students can attend up to two CAPS
counseling sessions for free, hut pa
tients who need to receive counseling
for extended periods of time must pay
a fee. If students suffer from serious
psychological problems, they may be
sent to locations off-campus for more
specialized or long-term treatment.
