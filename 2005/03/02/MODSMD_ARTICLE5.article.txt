# University aims to develop 'fuzzy-friendly' science classes
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Should science be a part of « O ,
every Stanford undergradu- v»
ate education? And if so, V
how much is enough?
These are two major
questions that adminis
trators will he asking
throughout the next two
years as the University re
evaluates the General Education
Requirements, or GERs.
A subdivision of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education has initiated a broad cur
ricular review to examine the purpose and effectiveness of
its requirements. The findings and recommendations re
sulting from the review are slated to be released in 2007.
This review stands apart from the GER changes that
were passed by the Faculty Senate last month, which in
cluded a provision to combine the Area 2 and Area 3 re
quirements under the title "Disciplinary Breadth."
Many non-science majors will continue to seek the path
of least resistance to meet their natural and applied science
GERs; a large number of students pass through college with
out ever setting foot inside a lab or finishing a problem set.
This falls in line with one of the administration's goals to

make GERs more flexible.
Nonetheless, administrators are well aware of some
"fuzzy" students' distaste for the study of the sciences and
are trying to find innovative new ways to give all students a
background in science without forcing them into classes
that don't pique their interest.
For example. Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion John Bravman said that the current science core re
quirement is "the weakest link" in the GER system.
He estimated that there are about 200 students in each
new Stanford class who truly dislike science and math and
said that the University needs to "overcome [students']
phobias and fears and perhaps the real limitations of their
high school training."
It is well known that certain science GER classes are
more popular than others among fuzzies. These courses
have a reputation for being easier than, say, a chemistry or
physics class.
Among the top picks: "Human Origins" in the Anthro
pological Sciences Department, "Oceans" offered by the
Geological and Environmental Sciences Department and
"Fundamentals of Geology," otherwise known as "Rocks
for Jocks" in the same department.
The ASSU Course Guide shows that of the students
who took "Oceans" in the 2002-2003 academic year, 66 per
cent were humanities or social science majors and 61 per-

cent took the course only because it
fulfilled a GER.
Bravman acknowledged the scope
of the problem.
"I'm certain many science and en
gineering faculty would say, 'Hey,
you're dumbing down the curricu
lum,"' he said.
Bravman asked ('omputer Science
Prof. Eric Roberts, who Bravman said
"could have also been a professor in
the humanities," to look into better
ways to interest luzzies in more tech
nical classes.
Roberts said he has "lots of ideas"
about how to bring science to non-sci
ence majors.
"My big idea is that what you want
to do is teach courses that people have
a genuine interest in but that legiti
mately cover areas of science and
quantities reasoning," he said.
Roberts said he envisioned these
courses as small seminars and suggest
ed several ways to approach the sub
ject matter.
One is to offer courses that com
bine science with other subjects of in
terest, creatine courses in the future

such as "Mathematics and Music" or
"The Science of Art." He also defined
what he called the "Great Books" ap
proach to science, which would assign
students readings by famous figures
like the Greek geometrician Euclid.
"Let's try 10 of these courses," he
said. "If five work and five fail, you've
still got something."
Sophomore Helena Lamb, a
prospective history or classics major,
look a small seminar called "Science
and Technology in World War 11" with
Engineering Prof. Brad Osgood, that
fulfilled her applied sciences GER.
The course examined the advent of
war technologies like radar and the
Enigma code-breaking machine. The
course required no problem sets or lab
work and, according to Lamb, there
was "minimal math and science."
She said that Osgood's course was
"probably one of the two best classes
that I've taken here."
Roberts ruled out the reinstate
ment of another multiple-quarter se
quence like the Science, Math and
Engineering Core, one of the more
ambitious ways of providing science

classes that catered to fuzzy students,
which the University has tried in the
last 10 years.
The Science, Math and Engineer
ing Core, or SME Core, was a three
quarter sequence for students who
wanted a more structured background
in science and lab work. It grew out of
the recommendations contained in the
1994 Report of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education.
Nevertheless, the program did not
attract enough student interest to jus
lily the University's expenditure of re
sources and Bravman had to pull the
plug a few years back.
One of the most innovative aspects
of the SME Core was its laboratory
component, which would be difficult
to repeat in a smaller setting.
The critical review of the GERs
will likely question whether or not
laboratory experience is valuable to
scientific education.
Fora student who takes only one
science course at Stanford, a lab might
not be possible at all because they com
monly do not occur until the second or
third quarter in department sequences.

Unlike many of his faculty peers,
Roberts said he does not think that
there are any particular subjects that
students must know before graduating.
"I don't like required courses in
general." he said.
Geophysics Prof. Rosemary
Knight, chair of the Committee on
Undergraduate Standards and Poli
cies, said that GERs "are meant to
provide what we feel are the essentials
of education."
The current process for choosing
courses that satisfy GERs may not
be as stringent as some faculty would
like.
Knight suggested the possibility of
forming an oversight committee for
GER courses similar to the I-hum
Governance Board, a panel of stu
dents and instructors who accept or
reject proposals for new courses.
Both Bravman and Knight agreed
that science GERs would be a major
focus of the curricula!" review.
"If Stanford University, with its
breadth of excellence, can't solve this
problem for all our students, then no
one can," Bravman said.

of education."
The current process for choosing
courses that satisfy GERs may not
be as stringent as some faculty would
like.
Knight suggested the possibility of

GER courses similar to the I-hum

Both Bravman and Knight agreed

"If Stanford University, with its
breadth of excellence, can't solve this
problem for all our students, then no
one can," Bravman said.
Should science be a part of « O ,
every Stanford undergradu- v»
ate education? And if so, V
how much is enough?
These are two major
questions that adminis
trators will he asking
throughout the next two
years as the University re
evaluates the General Education
Requirements, or GERs.
A subdivision of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education has initiated a broad cur
ricular review to examine the purpose and effectiveness of
its requirements. The findings and recommendations re
sulting from the review are slated to be released in 2007.
This review stands apart from the GER changes that
were passed by the Faculty Senate last month, which in
cluded a provision to combine the Area 2 and Area 3 re
quirements under the title "Disciplinary Breadth."
Many non-science majors will continue to seek the path
of least resistance to meet their natural and applied science
GERs; a large number of students pass through college with
out ever setting foot inside a lab or finishing a problem set.
This falls in line with one of the administration's goals to

make GERs more flexible.
Nonetheless, administrators are well aware of some
"fuzzy" students' distaste for the study of the sciences and
are trying to find innovative new ways to give all students a
background in science without forcing them into classes
that don't pique their interest.
For example. Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion John Bravman said that the current science core re
quirement is "the weakest link" in the GER system.
He estimated that there are about 200 students in each
new Stanford class who truly dislike science and math and
said that the University needs to "overcome [students']
phobias and fears and perhaps the real limitations of their
high school training."
It is well known that certain science GER classes are
more popular than others among fuzzies. These courses
have a reputation for being easier than, say, a chemistry or
physics class.
Among the top picks: "Human Origins" in the Anthro
pological Sciences Department, "Oceans" offered by the
Geological and Environmental Sciences Department and
"Fundamentals of Geology," otherwise known as "Rocks
for Jocks" in the same department.
The ASSU Course Guide shows that of the students
who took "Oceans" in the 2002-2003 academic year, 66 per
cent were humanities or social science majors and 61 per-

fulfilled a GER.
Bravman acknowledged the scope
of the problem.
"I'm certain many science and en
gineering faculty would say, 'Hey,
you're dumbing down the curricu
lum,"' he said.
Bravman asked ('omputer Science
Prof. Eric Roberts, who Bravman said
"could have also been a professor in
the humanities," to look into better
ways to interest luzzies in more tech
nical classes.
Roberts said he has "lots of ideas"
about how to bring science to non-sci
ence majors.
"My big idea is that what you want
to do is teach courses that people have
a genuine interest in but that legiti
mately cover areas of science and
quantities reasoning," he said.
Roberts said he envisioned these
courses as small seminars and suggest
ed several ways to approach the sub
ject matter.
One is to offer courses that com
bine science with other subjects of in
terest, creatine courses in the future

such as "Mathematics and Music" or
"The Science of Art." He also defined
what he called the "Great Books" ap
proach to science, which would assign
students readings by famous figures
like the Greek geometrician Euclid.
"Let's try 10 of these courses," he
said. "If five work and five fail, you've
still got something."
Sophomore Helena Lamb, a
prospective history or classics major,
look a small seminar called "Science
and Technology in World War 11" with
Engineering Prof. Brad Osgood, that
fulfilled her applied sciences GER.
The course examined the advent of
war technologies like radar and the
Enigma code-breaking machine. The
course required no problem sets or lab
work and, according to Lamb, there
was "minimal math and science."
She said that Osgood's course was
"probably one of the two best classes
that I've taken here."
Roberts ruled out the reinstate
ment of another multiple-quarter se
quence like the Science, Math and
Engineering Core, one of the more
ambitious ways of providing science

classes that catered to fuzzy students,
which the University has tried in the
last 10 years.
The Science, Math and Engineer
ing Core, or SME Core, was a three
quarter sequence for students who
wanted a more structured background
in science and lab work. It grew out of
the recommendations contained in the
1994 Report of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education.
Nevertheless, the program did not
attract enough student interest to jus
lily the University's expenditure of re
sources and Bravman had to pull the
plug a few years back.
One of the most innovative aspects
of the SME Core was its laboratory
component, which would be difficult
to repeat in a smaller setting.
The critical review of the GERs
will likely question whether or not
laboratory experience is valuable to
scientific education.
Fora student who takes only one
science course at Stanford, a lab might
not be possible at all because they com
monly do not occur until the second or
third quarter in department sequences.

Unlike many of his faculty peers,
Roberts said he does not think that
there are any particular subjects that
students must know before graduating.
