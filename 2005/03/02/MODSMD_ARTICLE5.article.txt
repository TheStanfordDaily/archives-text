# University aims to develop 'fuzzy-friendly' science classes

Should science be a part of « O ,
every Stanford undergradu- v»
ate education? And if so, V
how much is enough?
These are two major
questions that adminis
trators will he asking
throughout the next two
years as the University re
evaluates the General Education
Requirements, or GERs.
A subdivision of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education has initiated a broad cur
ricular review to examine the purpose and effectiveness of
its requirements. The findings and recommendations re
sulting from the review are slated to be released in 2007.
This review stands apart from the GER changes that
were passed by the Faculty Senate last month, which in
cluded a provision to combine the Area 2 and Area 3 re
quirements under the title "Disciplinary Breadth."
Many non-science majors will continue to seek the path
of least resistance to meet their natural and applied science
GERs; a large number of students pass through college with
out ever setting foot inside a lab or finishing a problem set.
This falls in line with one of the administration's goals to

make GERs more flexible.
Nonetheless, administrators are well aware of some
"fuzzy" students' distaste for the study of the sciences and
are trying to find innovative new ways to give all students a
background in science without forcing them into classes
that don't pique their interest.
For example. Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion John Bravman said that the current science core re
quirement is "the weakest link" in the GER system.
He estimated that there are about 200 students in each
new Stanford class who truly dislike science and math and
said that the University needs to "overcome [students']
phobias and fears and perhaps the real limitations of their
high school training."
It is well known that certain science GER classes are
more popular than others among fuzzies. These courses
have a reputation for being easier than, say, a chemistry or
physics class.
Among the top picks: "Human Origins" in the Anthro
pological Sciences Department, "Oceans" offered by the
Geological and Environmental Sciences Department and
"Fundamentals of Geology," otherwise known as "Rocks
for Jocks" in the same department.
The ASSU Course Guide shows that of the students
who took "Oceans" in the 2002-2003 academic year, 66 per
cent were humanities or social science majors and 61 per-
