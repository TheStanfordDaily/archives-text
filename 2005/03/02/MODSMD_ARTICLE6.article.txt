"In this one piece, we just play paper," said freshman
Karl Pichotta, referring to sounds made by waving paper.
"If you just focus on the sound of paper, it's a pretty beau
tiful sound."
Pichotta is one of several students who will perform in
the experimental "White Plaza Event #1" on Mar. 12, a
part of the "Encounter: Merce" series put on by Stanford
Lively Arts to celebrate dance artist Merce Cunningham.
The project, which culminates this month, focuses on
Cunningham's interest in experimental dance techniques.
"Merce is utterly delighted with the scope of this pro
ject," said Barbara Bickerman, public relations manager
for Lively Arts. "He's 85 now but he's still at the forefront
of modern dance."
Chris Chafe, director of the Center for Computer Re
search in Music and Acoustics, or CCRMA, has been
working on the logistics of the project for more than a year.
He said that the collaboration of different departments in
the production of the event has been beneficial.
On Mar. 8, Stanford students and CCRMA faculty will
combine music and dance in never before seen ways in an
event entitled, "Musicollage: A Happening by CCRMA
and Friends."
"The CCRMA, composed of musicians and technolo
gists, has been involved with the March 8 event," Chafe said.
"The event is a 'happening,' which means the music and
dance have never been rehearsed together before. It's self
organizing and has lots of surprises."
Integrating academics and performance, Mark Ap
plebaum, assistant professor of music, has been teach

Music of John Cage" this quarter.
Cage was a contemporary of Cun
ningham.
Along with his 16 students, Apple
baum has put together a unique event
in White Plaza, also embodying the
spirit of a "happening" and chance oc
currences. For instance, the music and
dance numbers will be selected only
minutes before the performance
using a pair of dice or another ran
domizer.
"Imagine studying Cage and
Merce for 10 weeks and then per
forming in this historical event," Ap
plebaum said. "The piece we will per
form is uniquely choreographed for
White Plaza and uses chance proce
dures. This creates absolutely won
derful, startling, weird moments of in
tersection."
Students in Applebaum's intro
ductory seminar will also experiment
with sound structures made of junk,
rocks, everyday items, playing cards,
rubber balls, duct tape, and even a
"prepared piano" in which the strings
have been modified with screws.
"For one of the pieces we found
three everyday objects and if they had
a good sonic quality then we used
them," explained freshman Aubrey
Munoz, a student in Applebaum's

freshman seminar. "We each have
special wristwatches that tell us when
to play our instruments rather than
sheet music, so musical experience is
not required."

"1 think that creativity is a com
mon denominator for students here at
Stanford, regardless of their field of
study," said Diane Frank, dance in
structor and lecturer in the dance de

partment, who is currently teaching
courses featuring Cunningham's
work. "Merce's work is really about a
way of looking at possibilities, in art
and in life."
