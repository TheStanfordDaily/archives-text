"I felt good last year,
and I feel good this year.
People will be ready to go
— I don'/ think /fatigueJ
will be a problem. "
— Susan King Borchardt

If it were a running event, it would be con
sidered outright sadistic.
It begins with a marathon, a battle for sur
vival where both talent and endurance are at
a premium. When you reach the finish line,
you find out it's not over. In fact, a new race is
just beginning.
Now, it becomes a sprint. Surviving the
first part only wins you the right to compete in
an all-out sprint for glory. Lose the sprint and
no one remembers that great marathon time.
Welcome to the college basketball season,
where No. 2 Stanford (26-2, 17-1 Pacific-10
Conference) has just finished breezing
through the regular season marathon.
Now, it's time to lace
up the track shoes.

After a likely three
games in the Pac-10
Tournament this week
end (Stanford goes in as
the No. 1 seed), the Car
dinal must get ready for
what could be a six
game dash through the
NCAA Tournament.
Different teams.
Different cities. A hec
tic, pressure-packed
schedule.
Over the course of

the conference season,
Stanford found its
rhythm, getting consistent effort and excel
lence in every facet of the game. How else do
you explain an average margin of victory of
24.6 points per game?
The last time Stanford played a game that
did not end in a double-digit victory? 2004.
Pardon the Cardinal if they are reluctant to
leave the regular season.
"There is an obvious excitement about the
postseason," head coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "But there is a certain sense, now that
the regular season is over, of 'Where did it
go?"'
Now, with nearly 30 games of wear and
tear under its belt, Stanford will embark upon
the most important games of the season. Are
the Cardinal worried about fatigue at this crit
ical stage?
"I remember last year, coming in from
high school, [I thought] that the season [was]
a lot longer, and this is the point where you re
ally start to notice it," sophomore Kristen
Newlin said. "But this is the postseason, and
this is where we're going to get our second
wind. We've got fresh legs [coming into the
NCAA Tournament]."
March is not the time to feel the season's
minutes adding up, and this year's Cardinal
certainly should not. The team's depth, which
was just a buzzword last fall, has generated
concrete benefits this spring.
While last year's Elite Eight team saw four
players each play more than 26 minutes per

game, this season's group has just two. Start
ing every game, senior Susan King Borchardt
played a total of 1,013 minutes last season.
Partially due to injury and partially due to the
arrival of freshman standout Candice Wig
gins. Borchardt has logged just 380 minutes
thus far and enters the postseason, along with
her teammates, with energy to burn.
"I felt good last year, and I feel good this
year," Borchardt said. "People will be ready
to go — I don't think [fatigue] will be a prob
lem."
Rested and ready for action, Stanford will
still have to deal with a new set of teams and
a new set of game plans, all aimed at knock
ing off the mighty No. 1 seed. More than like
ly, the Cardinal will hit the court with little
knowledge of their opponent beyond video
clips and scout team drills.
Nonetheless, expect Stanford to be ready.
"Our coaches aren't goirfg to miss a beat,"
senior Sebnem Kimyacioglu said. "Every
year, I've felt completely prepared for each
[Tournament] game, maybe even more so
than during [the regular season], because we
spend a lot of time on scouting."
The postseason requires a passion for
preparation from every team, as players and
coaches scramble to learn as much as they can
about their opponent in a short period of
time.
"I think our coaches do a great job of
breaking [film] down and showing players'
tendencies," VanDerveer said. "Sometimes
we'll make it into a game, like 'Family Feud,'
and make it fun, but our players know that it's
'one and done,' so they take it upon them
selves to learn it."
Yet, more than anything, the Cardinal will
be up against the tournament mystique. It is
the light under which the Cinderella team re
sponds and the favorite often falters.
"When the tournament bracket comes
out. it's a little overwhelming, honestly," said
VanDerveer, who will coach her 20th team
into the postseason this month. "When you
see your name — Stanford — going here,
playing there, it really hits you full-force."
Fora team this strong on paper, that mys
tique might be a greater threat than any name
listed on any bracket. That is, of course, if
Stanford's roster weren't packed with players
that were in this same position just 12 months
ago.
"I think the biggest advantage for us is our
seniors and our upperclassmen," Wiggins
said. "It's awesome knowing that they've
been through this before. They're poised, and
that's important."
Every Cardinal player, save the four fresh
men, has tasted March Madness in each of
her years on the Farm.
With its first game of the Pac-10 Tourna
ment at the HP Pavilion in San Jose Saturday
night, Stanford will officially begin its post
season sprint and will only hit a higher gear
March 19 with the first round of the NCAA
Tournament.
Runners, take your marks.

Pardon the Cardinal if they are reluctant to
leave the regular season.
"There is an obvious excitement about the
postseason," head coach Tara VanDerveer
said. "But there is a certain sense, now that
the regular season is over, of 'Where did it
go?"'
Now, with nearly 30 games of wear and
tear under its belt, Stanford will embark upon
the most important games of the season. Are
the Cardinal worried about fatigue at this crit
ical stage?
"I remember last year, coming in from
high school, [I thought] that the season [was]
a lot longer, and this is the point where you re
ally start to notice it," sophomore Kristen
Newlin said. "But this is the postseason, and
this is where we're going to get our second
wind. We've got fresh legs [coming into the
NCAA Tournament]."
March is not the time to feel the season's
minutes adding up, and this year's Cardinal
certainly should not. The team's depth, which
was just a buzzword last fall, has generated
concrete benefits this spring.
While last year's Elite Eight team saw four
players each play more than 26 minutes per

game, this season's group has just two. Start
ing every game, senior Susan King Borchardt
played a total of 1,013 minutes last season.
Partially due to injury and partially due to the
arrival of freshman standout Candice Wig
gins. Borchardt has logged just 380 minutes
thus far and enters the postseason, along with
her teammates, with energy to burn.
"I felt good last year, and I feel good this
year," Borchardt said. "People will be ready
to go — I don't think [fatigue] will be a prob
lem."
Rested and ready for action, Stanford will
still have to deal with a new set of teams and
a new set of game plans, all aimed at knock
ing off the mighty No. 1 seed. More than like
ly, the Cardinal will hit the court with little
knowledge of their opponent beyond video
clips and scout team drills.
Nonetheless, expect Stanford to be ready.
"Our coaches aren't goirfg to miss a beat,"
senior Sebnem Kimyacioglu said. "Every
year, I've felt completely prepared for each
[Tournament] game, maybe even more so
than during [the regular season], because we
spend a lot of time on scouting."
The postseason requires a passion for
preparation from every team, as players and
coaches scramble to learn as much as they can
about their opponent in a short period of
time.
"I think our coaches do a great job of
breaking [film] down and showing players'
tendencies," VanDerveer said. "Sometimes
we'll make it into a game, like 'Family Feud,'
and make it fun, but our players know that it's
'one and done,' so they take it upon them
selves to learn it."
Yet, more than anything, the Cardinal will
be up against the tournament mystique. It is
the light under which the Cinderella team re
sponds and the favorite often falters.
"When the tournament bracket comes
out. it's a little overwhelming, honestly," said
VanDerveer, who will coach her 20th team
into the postseason this month. "When you
see your name — Stanford — going here,
playing there, it really hits you full-force."
Fora team this strong on paper, that mys
tique might be a greater threat than any name
listed on any bracket. That is, of course, if
Stanford's roster weren't packed with players
that were in this same position just 12 months
ago.
"I think the biggest advantage for us is our
seniors and our upperclassmen," Wiggins
said. "It's awesome knowing that they've
been through this before. They're poised, and
that's important."
Every Cardinal player, save the four fresh
men, has tasted March Madness in each of
her years on the Farm.
With its first game of the Pac-10 Tourna
ment at the HP Pavilion in San Jose Saturday
night, Stanford will officially begin its post
season sprint and will only hit a higher gear
March 19 with the first round of the NCAA
Tournament.
Runners, take your marks.

If it were a running event, it would be con
sidered outright sadistic.
It begins with a marathon, a battle for sur
vival where both talent and endurance are at
a premium. When you reach the finish line,
you find out it's not over. In fact, a new race is
just beginning.
Now, it becomes a sprint. Surviving the
first part only wins you the right to compete in
an all-out sprint for glory. Lose the sprint and
no one remembers that great marathon time.
Welcome to the college basketball season,
where No. 2 Stanford (26-2, 17-1 Pacific-10
Conference) has just finished breezing
through the regular season marathon.
Now, it's time to lace
up the track shoes.

After a likely three
games in the Pac-10
Tournament this week
end (Stanford goes in as
the No. 1 seed), the Car
dinal must get ready for
what could be a six
game dash through the
NCAA Tournament.
Different teams.
Different cities. A hec
tic, pressure-packed
schedule.
Over the course of

the conference season,
Stanford found its
rhythm, getting consistent effort and excel
lence in every facet of the game. How else do
you explain an average margin of victory of
24.6 points per game?
