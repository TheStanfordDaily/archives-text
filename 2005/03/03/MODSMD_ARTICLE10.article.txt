# Tree auditions come to a dramatic end

Were you married yesterday in White Plaza?
Did you watch a boxing match at the intersection
of death? If so, you took part in Tree Week, the 10-
day period when the Stanford Band holds audi
tions fora new mascot.
Since last Monday, six candidates have tried to
one-up each other's stunts to be named the next
Tree. The culmination of the process will take
place later this week when all the prospective
Trees will gather fora secret ceremony.
They will be taken in an unmarked car to an
undisclosed location in the woods to meet with all
former trees from the past 30 years, said junior
Chris Holt, public relations officer for the Band.

Holt is also an opinions columnist for the Daily.
"It is to rediscover their roots," he added.
"There are some really great candidates and one is
truly the Tree."
The contenders have been working all week to
prove themselves, holding many events from a staging
of Ben Hur in White Plaza to imitations of the movie
"Rocky" to a kung fu duel complete with weapons.
While Trees are known to lie or mislead the
press, a few candidates shared their feelings about
the past ten days.
Prospective Tree Erin Lashnits, a senior, said,
"I successfully hurled myself off a slip-n-slide from
the 10 meter tower while on fire, conducted a
marathon all-girl moonbounce bra-and-panty tick
le fight and had sex on a tightrope strung from the
birdcage in White Plaza. Pretty hot."

Another tree hopeful, freshman Adam Monroe
said that for the tree candidates' first task, they
each had a jellyfish placed on their face and were
required to eat through it. The Daily was not wit
ness to these stunts.
"I've seen some great stunts so far,"' Holt said.
"We definitely have a good crop of candidates."
But he said that he could not make any early
predictions at this point or comment on any of the
stunts that have happened so far. He did, however,
recount his favorite stunts of past years.
"Last year, apparently, the Tree got a kidney or
an appendix removed," Holt said.
He also remembered a want-to-be Tree re
pelling off Hoover tower while on fire and another
who stood in White Plaza naked while being paint
balled by friends.
