# Downloading music legally
## School considers legal file-sharing 
### JENNY ALLEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The University has formed a
committee to determine whether
or not Stanford should negotiate
an online music subscription ser
vice, which would allow students
to download music for low prices,
with companies like Napster or
Apple.
According to Susan Wein
stein. Stanford's director of busi
ness development and privacy,
the committee includes students
who were recommended by the
ASSU executives and represen
tatives from the Office of Student
Affairs, Information Technology
Systems and Services, and Resi
dential Computing. It will evalu
ate music providers such as Nap
ster, CDigix, Ruckus, Rhapsody
and iTunes, which are the most
likely to provide preferential
pricing for students.
"In the last year, we have no
ticed that some of our peers are
beginning to make these services
available on their campuses,"
Weinstein said. "The University
has also been approached by a
number of providers of online
music services who wish to part
ner with us to provide their ser
vices to our students. It seemed
like a good time to take a look at
this opportunity to see if it is
right for our students and the
University."
Weinstein said she believes

that the committee will need to
answer two questions: Are stu
dents interested in an online
music subscription service, and
what support will the University
need to provide to make the op
portunity available?
"We anticipate that breadth of
catalogue, price and portability
will all play into whether students
are interested in this type of ser
vice," Weinstein said. "The "Uni
versity will need to weigh the in
vestment required to support this
initiative against all of the other
projects competing for our limit
ed resources."
Weinstein said that the music
subscription will likely be done
on a voluntary basis if imple
mented, but that "without more
information about the services
and a better understanding of the
benefits and costs, it is not certain
how this will play out."
Not everybody is optimistic
about the changes. A Residential
computing staff member, who re
quested to remain anonymous,
said that the service could possi
bly take away students' rights as
consumers.
"It's fine with me if students
are allowed a choice about the
service," the source said. "But I
know that other universities,
such as Penn State, have followed
a model of simply signing up for
the service and offering it 'free' to
the students, which is essentially a
tax on students for crippled music
forced on them. The music is crip
pled because of the Digital Rights
Management Act; the restrictions
against playing, copying or burning
the file; and the plain fact that a
quality difference can definitely be
heard between the compressed
files, which are MP3, Window
Media Audio and Advanced Audio
Coding."
An article in the Chronicle of
Higher Education entitled "The
Downloading Beat Goes On." pub
lished Feb. 3, noted that although
the music industry inundates col
leges with alleged violations of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
via file-sharing, students were
"downloading just as much music il
legally [in 2004| as they did [in
2003 [."
According to Carolyn Jane
Ilafner of the Information Security
Office, about 5 percent of individu
als at Stanford who receive one
file-sharing complaint received an
other.
"This tells me that our communi
ty of network users — which in
cludes not just students — do
change their behavior once they re

alize that their file-sharing is ille
gal," Hafner said. "I think that is
pretty nifty because it tells me that
folks are either misinformed or un
informed. not that they just want to
get files for free."
David Meizlik recently served as
the principal organizer of a music
service implementation program at
the University of Southern Califor
nia. In crafting a partnership with
Napster, Meizlik identified three
critical factors: the existence of a
catalogue capable of handling stu
dents' diverse interests in music; of
fering a serviceable partnership to a
majority of the student body; and
burdenless addition of the service
for the users and the university.
"Invariably, the greatest chal
lenge to such a partnership is cost,"
Meizlik said. "Illegal downloading
is fueled by students' decreased ca
pacity to afford legitimate alterna
tives and universities are necessari
ly cautious when spending tuition
dollars or donor funds on non-aca
demic services."
He added, "What students re
quire is a viable alternative to dis
ruptive, illegal technologies. Every
university is responsible for creat
ing an ethical learning environ
ment. A partnership between a uni
versity and an online music distri
bution service affirms an institu
tion's commitment to intellectual
property rights and leverages the
strengths of both into strategies."

legally [in 2004| as they did [in
2003 [."
According to Carolyn Jane
Ilafner of the Information Security
Office, about 5 percent of individu
als at Stanford who receive one
file-sharing complaint received an
other.
"This tells me that our communi
ty of network users — which in
cludes not just students — do
change their behavior once they re

alize that their file-sharing is ille
gal," Hafner said. "I think that is
pretty nifty because it tells me that
folks are either misinformed or un
informed. not that they just want to
get files for free."
David Meizlik recently served as
the principal organizer of a music
service implementation program at
the University of Southern Califor
nia. In crafting a partnership with
Napster, Meizlik identified three
critical factors: the existence of a
catalogue capable of handling stu
dents' diverse interests in music; of
fering a serviceable partnership to a
majority of the student body; and
burdenless addition of the service
for the users and the university.
"Invariably, the greatest chal
lenge to such a partnership is cost,"
Meizlik said. "Illegal downloading
is fueled by students' decreased ca
pacity to afford legitimate alterna
tives and universities are necessari
ly cautious when spending tuition
dollars or donor funds on non-aca
demic services."
He added, "What students re
quire is a viable alternative to dis
ruptive, illegal technologies. Every
university is responsible for creat
ing an ethical learning environ
ment. A partnership between a uni
versity and an online music distri
bution service affirms an institu
tion's commitment to intellectual
property rights and leverages the
strengths of both into strategies."
The University has formed a
committee to determine whether
or not Stanford should negotiate
an online music subscription ser
vice, which would allow students
to download music for low prices,
with companies like Napster or
Apple.
According to Susan Wein
stein. Stanford's director of busi
ness development and privacy,
the committee includes students
who were recommended by the
ASSU executives and represen
tatives from the Office of Student
Affairs, Information Technology
Systems and Services, and Resi
dential Computing. It will evalu
ate music providers such as Nap
ster, CDigix, Ruckus, Rhapsody
and iTunes, which are the most
likely to provide preferential
pricing for students.
"In the last year, we have no
ticed that some of our peers are
beginning to make these services
available on their campuses,"
Weinstein said. "The University
has also been approached by a
number of providers of online
music services who wish to part
ner with us to provide their ser
vices to our students. It seemed
like a good time to take a look at
this opportunity to see if it is
right for our students and the
University."
Weinstein said she believes

that the committee will need to
answer two questions: Are stu
dents interested in an online
music subscription service, and
what support will the University
need to provide to make the op
portunity available?
"We anticipate that breadth of
catalogue, price and portability
will all play into whether students
are interested in this type of ser
vice," Weinstein said. "The "Uni
versity will need to weigh the in
vestment required to support this
initiative against all of the other
projects competing for our limit
ed resources."
Weinstein said that the music
subscription will likely be done
on a voluntary basis if imple
mented, but that "without more
information about the services
and a better understanding of the
benefits and costs, it is not certain
how this will play out."
Not everybody is optimistic
about the changes. A Residential
computing staff member, who re
quested to remain anonymous,
said that the service could possi
bly take away students' rights as
consumers.
"It's fine with me if students
are allowed a choice about the
service," the source said. "But I
know that other universities,
such as Penn State, have followed
a model of simply signing up for
the service and offering it 'free' to
the students, which is essentially a
tax on students for crippled music
forced on them. The music is crip
pled because of the Digital Rights
Management Act; the restrictions
against playing, copying or burning
the file; and the plain fact that a
quality difference can definitely be
heard between the compressed
files, which are MP3, Window
Media Audio and Advanced Audio
Coding."
An article in the Chronicle of
Higher Education entitled "The
Downloading Beat Goes On." pub
lished Feb. 3, noted that although
the music industry inundates col
leges with alleged violations of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act
via file-sharing, students were
"downloading just as much music il
legally [in 2004| as they did [in
2003 [."
