# Public service jobs require work to find
## 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
As the temperature rises outside,
so does the pressure on students to
find summer jobs or internships.
And while corporate America may
lure many students with hefty pay
checks, some said they prefer jobs in
the less-lucrative public sector.
Junior Alex Rivas is ahead of the
game and already has a spot waiting
for him in Washington. D.C. at the
Partnership for Public Service,
where he will be working to encour
age college graduates to look into ca
reers in public service.
"Due to the nature of public ser
vice — lower paying jobs with less
prestige — I find that the public ser
vice sector is extremely receptive to
recent college grads because the
draw of grad school or more highly
paid private sector jobs makes young
applicants a commodity," Rivas said.
"Also, I sense a feeling amongst pub
lic sector employers that there is a
need for younger people with more
energy and fresher ideas."
Call to Serve Initiative is a nation
al plan created in 2002 by the Part
nership for Public Service in order to
re-establish links between federal
agencies and campuses and provide
students with information about
government jobs. The Partnership

for Public Service is a nonprofit or
ganization founded in 2001 that
strives to bring more people to gov
ernment service, especially in light of
the low demand for young employ
ees among nonprofit organizations.
"Due to the dotcom bust, founda
tions that were heavily invested in
technology stocks limited their abili
ty to award grants to nonprofits,"
said Sam Rodriguez, the public ser
vice career counselor at Stanford's
Career Development Center. "This
affected annual budgets of nonprofit
organizations that rely on founda
tions and government funding.
Some nonprofit organizations had to
close shop."
While, private sector employers
are looking for more new applicants
than in previous years, it will take
some time for nonprofit organiza
tions to fully catch up. Yet, Ro
driguez insists that students should
not find this disheartening.
"Even in a bad economy, there
are jobs out there," he said. "They
may not be ideal or your dream job.
However, I believe it is important to
follow your passion and be creative
in developing future plans that in
corporates your interest in public
service." t
The Career Development Cen
ter, or CDC, has a database contain
ing more than 9(K) public service or
ganizations that include jobs in
human rights, healthcare and the in
ternational arena.
The standard process for apply
ing is similar to what you would find
in the private sector — submitting a
resume and cover letter directly to
an organization.
Junior Luis Vertiz, who worked
with the CDC to garner a handful of
interviews for international security
related internships, said that he be
lieves internships are more difficult
to get than full-time jobs because
they are more risky for the organiza
tions hiring.
Vertiz also admitted that part of
snagging the perfect summer oppor
tunity is all about who you know.
"It's incredibly difficult if you
apply to an organization where you
don't know anybody, since no one will
vouch for you personally," he said.
Rodriguez agreed that network
ing with people in the public service
sector is probably the most effective
job search strategy. He added that
jobs and internships can both be in
tensely competitive. He recom
mended being patient and persistent
and practicing interview skills.

Following this advice, Verti/. said
he chocked out interview prepara
tion books from the library and took
them home to his mirror where he re
hearsed answers to likely questions.
"The most difficult question to
answer was 'What do you do for
fun?' " he said. "I didn't know what
my employer was looking for and I
was afraid of either coming off as ei
ther too casual or too stiff."
Practice or no practice, most stu
dents agree good positions are diffi
cult of get.
"Applying for summer intern
ships was the first time in my life I
had to deal with significant rejection
and failure," Verti/. said. "I think ev
eryone goes through that maturing
process. I know I did."
Rodriguez said he urges students
not be discouraged by rejection or
take the process too personally.
Willingness to work in the
trenches is also very important and
will help employers recognizes stu
dents' potential, he added.
He gave an anecdote about one
woman starting out with an under
graduate degree who found work as
an administrative assistant with a
nonprofit organization providing
HIV/AIDS education and preven
tion.
"It did not take very long before
she started moving up in the organi
zation and eventually became the
executive director earning a six-fig
ure salary," Rodriguez said.

"Applying for summer intern

had to deal with significant rejection
and failure," Verti/. said. "I think ev

Rodriguez said he urges students
not be discouraged by rejection or
take the process too personally.
Willingness to work in the

He gave an anecdote about one
woman starting out with an under
graduate degree who found work as
an administrative assistant with a
nonprofit organization providing
HIV/AIDS education and preven

As the temperature rises outside,
so does the pressure on students to
find summer jobs or internships.
And while corporate America may
lure many students with hefty pay
checks, some said they prefer jobs in
the less-lucrative public sector.
Junior Alex Rivas is ahead of the
game and already has a spot waiting
for him in Washington. D.C. at the
Partnership for Public Service,
where he will be working to encour
age college graduates to look into ca
reers in public service.
"Due to the nature of public ser
vice — lower paying jobs with less
prestige — I find that the public ser
vice sector is extremely receptive to
recent college grads because the
draw of grad school or more highly
paid private sector jobs makes young
applicants a commodity," Rivas said.
"Also, I sense a feeling amongst pub
lic sector employers that there is a
need for younger people with more
energy and fresher ideas."
Call to Serve Initiative is a nation
al plan created in 2002 by the Part
nership for Public Service in order to
re-establish links between federal
agencies and campuses and provide
students with information about
government jobs. The Partnership

for Public Service is a nonprofit or
ganization founded in 2001 that
strives to bring more people to gov
ernment service, especially in light of
the low demand for young employ
ees among nonprofit organizations.
"Due to the dotcom bust, founda
tions that were heavily invested in
technology stocks limited their abili
ty to award grants to nonprofits,"
said Sam Rodriguez, the public ser
vice career counselor at Stanford's
Career Development Center. "This
affected annual budgets of nonprofit
organizations that rely on founda
tions and government funding.
Some nonprofit organizations had to
close shop."
While, private sector employers
are looking for more new applicants
than in previous years, it will take
some time for nonprofit organiza
tions to fully catch up. Yet, Ro
driguez insists that students should
not find this disheartening.
"Even in a bad economy, there
are jobs out there," he said. "They
may not be ideal or your dream job.
However, I believe it is important to
follow your passion and be creative
in developing future plans that in
corporates your interest in public
service." t
The Career Development Cen
ter, or CDC, has a database contain
ing more than 9(K) public service or
ganizations that include jobs in
human rights, healthcare and the in
ternational arena.
The standard process for apply
ing is similar to what you would find
in the private sector — submitting a
resume and cover letter directly to
an organization.
Junior Luis Vertiz, who worked
with the CDC to garner a handful of
interviews for international security
related internships, said that he be
lieves internships are more difficult
to get than full-time jobs because
they are more risky for the organiza
tions hiring.
Vertiz also admitted that part of
snagging the perfect summer oppor
tunity is all about who you know.
"It's incredibly difficult if you
apply to an organization where you
don't know anybody, since no one will
vouch for you personally," he said.
Rodriguez agreed that network
ing with people in the public service
sector is probably the most effective
job search strategy. He added that
jobs and internships can both be in
tensely competitive. He recom
mended being patient and persistent
and practicing interview skills.

Following this advice, Verti/. said
he chocked out interview prepara
tion books from the library and took
them home to his mirror where he re
hearsed answers to likely questions.
"The most difficult question to
answer was 'What do you do for
fun?' " he said. "I didn't know what
my employer was looking for and I
was afraid of either coming off as ei
ther too casual or too stiff."
