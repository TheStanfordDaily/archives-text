# Public service jobs require work to find
## 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
As the temperature rises outside,
so does the pressure on students to
find summer jobs or internships.
And while corporate America may
lure many students with hefty pay
checks, some said they prefer jobs in
the less-lucrative public sector.
Junior Alex Rivas is ahead of the
game and already has a spot waiting
for him in Washington. D.C. at the
Partnership for Public Service,
where he will be working to encour
age college graduates to look into ca
reers in public service.
"Due to the nature of public ser
vice — lower paying jobs with less
prestige — I find that the public ser
vice sector is extremely receptive to
recent college grads because the
draw of grad school or more highly
paid private sector jobs makes young
applicants a commodity," Rivas said.
"Also, I sense a feeling amongst pub
lic sector employers that there is a
need for younger people with more
energy and fresher ideas."
Call to Serve Initiative is a nation
al plan created in 2002 by the Part
nership for Public Service in order to
re-establish links between federal
agencies and campuses and provide
students with information about
government jobs. The Partnership

for Public Service is a nonprofit or
ganization founded in 2001 that
strives to bring more people to gov
ernment service, especially in light of
the low demand for young employ
ees among nonprofit organizations.
"Due to the dotcom bust, founda
tions that were heavily invested in
technology stocks limited their abili
ty to award grants to nonprofits,"
said Sam Rodriguez, the public ser
vice career counselor at Stanford's
Career Development Center. "This
affected annual budgets of nonprofit
organizations that rely on founda
tions and government funding.
Some nonprofit organizations had to
close shop."
While, private sector employers
are looking for more new applicants
than in previous years, it will take
some time for nonprofit organiza
tions to fully catch up. Yet, Ro
driguez insists that students should
not find this disheartening.
"Even in a bad economy, there
are jobs out there," he said. "They
may not be ideal or your dream job.
However, I believe it is important to
follow your passion and be creative
in developing future plans that in
corporates your interest in public
service." t
