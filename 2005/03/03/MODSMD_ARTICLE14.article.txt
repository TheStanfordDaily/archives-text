# An Ounce of Prevention
## My mental health weekend 
### 
On any given Friday during my se
nior year in high school, there was a
chance that my English teacher
wouldn't show up to class. She had the
habit of taking what she termed "mental
health days." Sometimes these were
spur-of-the-moment holidays but more
often, they were planned ahead of time
and announced to the class.
I don't know everything my teacher
did on her mental health days, but at
least a few of them included shopping
and getting spa treatments. I always
thought that it was a little irresponsible
fora teacher to play hooky. As a role
model fora group of impressionable
teens, she could have at least feigned a
more prudent work ethic.
But after a particularly stressful
week. I began to think that maybe she
was on to something. If I have learned
one thing in my 20 years of living, it is
that life is work — and work only ends
with death.

Now this isn't
meant to be de
pressing; it is
simply self-evi
dent that very
few people have
the luxury of not
working. And
for many, work
tends to bring
along its uninvit-

Ed, unwelcome, but seemingly om
nipresent buddy — stress.
Stress is nothing new for Stanford
students, and I am no exception. As of
late, work has left me with little time for
other priorities such as friends, sleep
and personal hygiene.
So I had the brilliant idea last Friday
to follow my teacher's example and
enjoy a completely stress-free weekend.
It was the worst possible time to try such
a brazen psychological experiment, but
after much deliberation, I decided that it
was indeed a great idea.
After my last class of the week, I
drove home and ate some of my moth
er's wonderful cooking and watched
"WWF Smackdown" on TV. Things
were off to a great start.
I signed on to AIM to see if my
friends were free to hang out, but appar
ently there was "nothing going on on
campus." The rejection bothered me a
little, but I wasn't going to stress, so I just
let it go. In any case, the effort involved
in getting ready to go out would proba
bly have brought on more stress any
way. I went to sleep at 10 p.m.
Saturday morning I woke up, ate
breakfast and watched some more TV.
I didn't know what to do after that, so I
ate some more. The enormous list of
things I had to do kept creeping up from
the back of my mind, and having them
hanging over my head was really start
ing to get to me. But, as you recall, this
was to be a stress-free weekend. I shook
it off and somehow managed to kill the
rest of Saturday.
By Sunday, I was really bored. I was
thankful for the volunteer activity I had
committed to for the afternoon be
cause it meant I could actually do
something productive. By Sunday
night I was glad that this God-awful ex
periment was over. But I had done it. I
had survived my supposedly stress-free
mental health weekend.
So now the weekend is long gone and
I find myself with just as much work as I
had before, only now the deadlines are
significantly closer. My mental health
status is at a new low and my little exper
iment can be summed up as a colossal
failure. Not only did it not leave me reju
venated, I somehow managed to com
pound my stress with guilt for having
wasted so much time.
Still, I learned a lot this weekend.
Most importantly, I found that the sat
isfaction I gain from working hard and
having something to show for it out
weighs the ephemeral pleasures of pro
crastination — at least to a certain ex
tent.
As we head into Dead Week and Fi
nals Week, I think this is a good lesson
to keep in mind. As tired, tense or frus
trated as our schoolwork might make
us, on some level we enjoy the sense of
accomplishment it gives us.
And in the end, we would rather be
the frantically paddling ducks on the
surface of a lake than the ducks that
drown because they decide to rest their
little webbed feet.
So study hard. Just don't let the stress
affect your mental health so much that
you lose sight of the big picture. Don't
forget that you're working hard be
cause you know that in the long run, the
benefits of getting an education will
have a far more positive effect on your
mental health than a few weekends of
sloth ever could.
And if you do find yourself feeling
overwhelmed, well, you could always
try a spa treatment.

So study hard. Just don't let the stress
affect your mental health so much that
you lose sight of the big picture. Don't

cause you know that in the long run, the
benefits of getting an education will
have a far more positive effect on your
mental health than a few weekends of
sloth ever could.
And if you do find yourself feeling
overwhelmed, well, you could always
try a spa treatment.

On any given Friday during my se
nior year in high school, there was a
chance that my English teacher
wouldn't show up to class. She had the
habit of taking what she termed "mental
health days." Sometimes these were
spur-of-the-moment holidays but more
often, they were planned ahead of time
and announced to the class.
I don't know everything my teacher
did on her mental health days, but at
least a few of them included shopping
and getting spa treatments. I always
thought that it was a little irresponsible
fora teacher to play hooky. As a role
model fora group of impressionable
teens, she could have at least feigned a
more prudent work ethic.
But after a particularly stressful
week. I began to think that maybe she
was on to something. If I have learned
one thing in my 20 years of living, it is
that life is work — and work only ends
with death.

Now this isn't
meant to be de
pressing; it is
simply self-evi
dent that very
few people have
the luxury of not
working. And
for many, work
tends to bring
along its uninvit-

Ed, unwelcome, but seemingly om
nipresent buddy — stress.
Stress is nothing new for Stanford
students, and I am no exception. As of
late, work has left me with little time for
other priorities such as friends, sleep
and personal hygiene.
So I had the brilliant idea last Friday
to follow my teacher's example and
enjoy a completely stress-free weekend.
It was the worst possible time to try such
a brazen psychological experiment, but
after much deliberation, I decided that it
was indeed a great idea.
After my last class of the week, I
drove home and ate some of my moth
er's wonderful cooking and watched
"WWF Smackdown" on TV. Things
were off to a great start.
I signed on to AIM to see if my
friends were free to hang out, but appar
ently there was "nothing going on on
campus." The rejection bothered me a
little, but I wasn't going to stress, so I just
let it go. In any case, the effort involved
in getting ready to go out would proba
bly have brought on more stress any
way. I went to sleep at 10 p.m.
Saturday morning I woke up, ate
breakfast and watched some more TV.
I didn't know what to do after that, so I
ate some more. The enormous list of
things I had to do kept creeping up from
the back of my mind, and having them
hanging over my head was really start
ing to get to me. But, as you recall, this
was to be a stress-free weekend. I shook
it off and somehow managed to kill the
rest of Saturday.
By Sunday, I was really bored. I was
thankful for the volunteer activity I had
committed to for the afternoon be
cause it meant I could actually do
something productive. By Sunday
night I was glad that this God-awful ex
periment was over. But I had done it. I
had survived my supposedly stress-free
mental health weekend.
So now the weekend is long gone and
I find myself with just as much work as I
had before, only now the deadlines are
significantly closer. My mental health
status is at a new low and my little exper
iment can be summed up as a colossal
failure. Not only did it not leave me reju
venated, I somehow managed to com
pound my stress with guilt for having
wasted so much time.
Still, I learned a lot this weekend.
Most importantly, I found that the sat
isfaction I gain from working hard and
having something to show for it out
