# Lenses and Lasers:
## A
						look at the latest technology in eye care 
### EUGENIE KIM DESK EDITOR 
Imagine a world without the technology of corrective lenses or
surgery for people with vision problems. It's a thought that many
of the 135 million American adults who wear prescription lenses, a
number compiled by the eye care advocacy group Vision Council
of America, don't want to contemplate.
"It would affect me socially, academically and mentally," said
senior Julie Park. "Everything's blurry without my contacts, and if
I didn't have glasses I wouldn't be able to drive, I couldn't go to
large lectures and I probably wouldn't even be able to say hi to my
friends,"
Today, a person with vision problems has a range of corrective
options — from glasses to contact lenses to refractive surgery —
but the technology of restoring correct vision continues to evolve.
One of the newest advancements in the field of eye care is
Corneal Refractive Therapy (CRT) for nearsighted people. This
process, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in
2002, requires users to wear special "retainer" lenses overnight
that flattens the cornea.
When users take out the lenses in the morning, users may be
able to see just as well without any lenses as they would otherwise
see with normal contacts or glasses.
Although CRT enhances vision in the same way as regular con
tact lenses, it is not a remedy and users must continually wear the
retainer lenses on a nightly basis.
According to Dr. Steven Binder, an optometrist at the Stanford
Eye Center, though CRT lenses can costa person from $1,500 to
$2,000 for both eyes for the initial fitting, CRT provides the bene
fits of unhampered vision without the need for surgery.
"It's not a permanent fix, but it's an alternative for those who
are queasy about surgery 1 or for those who, for whatever reason,
can't have or don't qualify for surgery," he said.
Another substitute for refractive surgery is the "continuous
wear" contact lenses, which were approved by the FDA in 2(X)1
and can be worn for up to 30 days without removal.
The new line of extended-wear lenses is made out of a material
that is more oxygen-permeable than the material of their prede
cessors, which greatly reduces the risk of infections. Due to poten
tial health complications, the FDA has become more cautious in
recent years about certifying contacts for long-term wear, accord
ing to Binder.
"The first generation of disposable contact lenses was original
ly approved for 30-day use, but then there were complaints about
infections and so [the FDA] scaled down use to seven days," he
said. "Now there are two brands on the market that have been ap
proved for 30-day use."
Despite the recent developments that have made the experi
ence of wearing contact lenses more comfortable than in the past,
contacts are not for everyone.
"Some of the potential side effects are redness, allergies and dry
eyes," Binder said. "They're not very good in places where the hu
midity is low, such as in the desert or on an airplane, and you can
also get dust and debris caught under the lens."
Binder said that infections and many other contact-related
problems could be prevented by good lens care — cleaning and
disposing of lenses at the proper time is important to maintaining
healthy eyes.
Those who are tired of dealing with the daily hassle of contact
lenses and glasses can consider the option of undergo
ing refractive surgery, com-

monly known as laser eye
surgery.
Refractive surgery uses a va
riety of processes and technolo
gies, but all procedures use a
laser beam to permanently
shape the corneal tissue.
The latest method involves a
surgeon or machine making an
incision in the eye to create a
"flap," which is then pulled
back so that the laser can pene
trate the cornea. Laser eye
surgery is innovative in that the
entire surgical procedure usual
ly only takes about ten minutes.
This method in laser eye
surgery is called "wavefront-
LASIK." commonly known as
LASIK. Custom LASIK uses
an advanced technology that al
lows the laser to form a cus
tomized. 3-D image of each in
dividual eye. Before wavefront
LASIK technology was devel
oped. refractive surgery made
similar corrections to all eyes
without taking into detailed ac
count the unique aberrations in
individual eyes.

According to Dr. Edward Manche. the director of Cornea and
Refractive Surgery at the Stanford Eye Laser Center and an asso
ciate professor of Ophthalmology at the School of Medicine, when
done by a capable expert, refractive surgery' has a high success rate.
Still, he said, it is difficult to predict the specific outcome of each
surgery.
"The problem is that the eye is living tissue, not like glass or
plastic," Manche said. "There's biological variability in response to
what the laser does."
Manche also said that 90 percent of people who undergo
surgery see as well as they could with contacts or glasses, while the
other 10 percent demonstrate improved vision, but not to the full
extent of wearing glasses or contacts.
Still, there are those for whom the hazards of surgery rule out
laser correction as an option for their eyes.
"Thfcre seems to be too much that could go wrong, and I'd
rather have decent eyesight with contacts than take the chance that
something could go terribly wrong." said junior Sarah Truebe.
Manche said that refractive surgery does have associated risks,
which are both common to all surgical procedures and specific to
eye surgery.
"Sometimes there are more serious flap complications, which
can be manageable and correctable," he said. "But sometimes
there is a significant degradation of vision or impairment of vision
that could be permanent."
Even for those who are willing to have refractive surgery and
are ready to pay $5,000 to $5,500 for the procedure, not just anyone
should undergo refractive surgery.
Before receiving the surgery, prospective patients are screened
for possible complicating factors such as extreme nearsightedness
or astigmatism, a condition in which either the cornea or the lens is
curved irregularly. In addition, a person should wait until their eye

sight has reached the point where it will not get much worse, ac
cording to Manche.
"You would like to demonstrate refractive stability," Manche
said. "What we like to see is a year or two of minimal or no change
[in eyesight] but there are some lasers that are approved to treat
patients that are 18 years and older. Most lasers are approved to
treat people who are 21 years or older."
Sophomore Vinay Mascarenhas said he is waiting for the day
that he will qualify for refractive surgery.
" would totally get it,"he said. "The second I turn 21 li'm not
buying alcohol. Km getting laser eye surgery."
Because refractive surgery is such a new technique, there is as
of yet, no concrete evidence about its long-term efficacy or stabili
ty.
"Refractive surgery is only 12 or 15 years old," Mache said.
"Recent research has shown that it seems to be quite stable over a
12-year period, which leads us to assume that it will be stable over
time. But the proof is in the pudding, as they say."
Finally, for those who would rather eschew the new technolo
gies that function so directly with the actual eye, there is always the
option of good old-fashioned glasses.
"I'm too lazy to put in contacts," said sophomore Cassie Slim
mer. "There's no way I'm waking up even five minutes earlier in
the morning just to put in contacts."
And glasses are probably also the safest option for the visually
impaired.
"There is a misconception that if you wear glasses for too long,
you'll come to depend on them," Binder said. "But generally,
glasses don't cause any harm."
Binder said he recommends that those who want to avoid any
physical damage protect their eyes from the ultraviolet rays of the
sun and eat foods rich in antioxidants, such as carrots and spinach.
