# How about some light reading? Navigating the nutrition label

They perplex us.
They mock us. We
stand silently in the

aisles of grocery stores trying to

decipher them. They throw terms such as
"serving size" and "percent daily value" at
us, tell us how many calories will land in our
stomachs and even allow us to believe we
are staying healthy by consuming a certain
percentage of some vitamin.
They are the nutrition labels found on
virtually every prepackaged food item
available in the supermarket. But what do
they mean? How important are they? And
why should we care?
According to Sally Mackey, the director
of Dietary Intervention at Stanford Medi
cal School, the nutrition label on foods is
important for several reasons.
"It gives you a standardized way of un
derstanding the content of the food you
eat," she said. "There are some things
about a label that make it easy to compare
products. You also get a feel for how what
you're eating may fit into the goals you're
trying to make."
Freshman Esther Cheng said she often
reads nutrition labels for their relative nu
tritional values.
"Sometimes when I'm comparing two
things to eat I look at the nutrition label,"
she said. "I use the nutrition label as a basis
of comparison because I define something
as nutritional if it doesn't have a lot of
sugar, if it is low in fat, and it has more un
saturated fats than saturated fats."
Due to regulations from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, all nutrition la
bels are equipped with the same basic com
ponents: serving size, calories, fat, choles
terol, sodium, carbohydrate and protein.
The FDA also has a Web site dedicated
that provides information and tips for nav
igating nutrition labels.
According to the FDA, the first thing to
look at in a nutrition label is the serving size.
Serving size makes it easy to compare similar
foods because such ftxxls are measured in
the same units, usually a household measure
like cups or grams. In some instances, mea

surement
may be a result of
convention rather than an actual unit. The
standard serving size for bread, for example,
is the slice.
A slice of Wonderbread. however, is dif
ferent from a slice of Pepperidge Farm
bread. Because they differ in density and
thickness, it may not make sense to com
pare the absolute number of calories or
grams of fat listed for each "slice" on the
nutrition label. This is precisely the reason
students at Stanford should skim the entire
nutrition label, taking into account details
such as serving size, Mackey said.
After taking a gander at the serving size,
it is helpful to focus on calories, which tell
you how much energy you are getting from
a serving size of food.
Though most nutrition labels are based
on the average recommendation of a 2,000
calorie diet. Mackey said this number is not
necessarily optimal for everyone. Each
person has different caloric needs depend
ing on his or her current size and health
goals.
"If you're trying to manage weight, [the
number of calories] would be important,"
Mackey said. "Based on what your activity
level is and what your metabolism is, you
can adjust your calories."
"Two-thousand calories is a reference
number. If you're extremely active, you
may need many more calories. If you're not
fit, you may need far fewer calories," she
added.
For those who want a more thorough
understanding of what is in their food, it
might be helpful to look at the nutrient
content. On a nutrition label, nutrients are
usually separated by a thick bar. Lying

above the bar are nu
trients that Ameri
cans tend to overeat:
total fat, cholesterol
and sodium. Below
are the nutrients
Americans must be
sure to consume: di
etary fiber and vitamins.
Each nutrient has an ex-

planation of how many

grams or milligrams are pre
sent in the product and how those

measurements trans
late into percentages of the
recommended daily values.
But how are you sup
posed to know what's nec
essary for your percent
daily value? If you really
can't figure it out. the FDA
has one quick tip: five per
cent or less is a "low"
amount and 20 percent or
more is "high."
This can make the nutri
tion label tedious to read.
"I read nutrition labels
because when you're sitting
at breakfast, sometimes
there's nothing else to
read." said junior Allen
Huang.
Huang said he is more
interested in living a
healthy lifestyle than devot
ing his time to analyzing la
bels.
"Just getting enough
sleep would be healthy for
me," he said.
Cheng, too, said she em
phasizes healthy activity
more than food labels. A
member of Stanford's
squash team, Cheng said
she rarely skips a meal and
works out four times a
week.
"When I'm on a healthy
diet — that means I'm eat
ing well and exercising reg
ularly — my mind is more
energized," she said. "1 feel

better all around."
In the United States, people tend to
overlook labels because they are more in
terested in eating what they desire. Unsat
urated fats, things low in sugar and main
taining a calorie balance are disregarded,
according to Mackey.
"In general, Americans are getting
away from choosing foods that have a lot of
vitamins and minerals and nutritional
value," she said. "They pay more attention
to the foods that they like, taste good and
are quick to order."

more than food labels. A

In the United States, people tend to
overlook labels because they are more in
terested in eating what they desire. Unsat
urated fats, things low in sugar and main
taining a calorie balance are disregarded,
according to Mackey.
"In general, Americans are getting
away from choosing foods that have a lot of
vitamins and minerals and nutritional
value," she said. "They pay more attention
to the foods that they like, taste good and
are quick to order."

They perplex us.
They mock us. We
stand silently in the

aisles of grocery stores trying to

decipher them. They throw terms such as
"serving size" and "percent daily value" at
us, tell us how many calories will land in our
stomachs and even allow us to believe we
are staying healthy by consuming a certain
percentage of some vitamin.
They are the nutrition labels found on
virtually every prepackaged food item
available in the supermarket. But what do
they mean? How important are they? And
why should we care?
According to Sally Mackey, the director
of Dietary Intervention at Stanford Medi
cal School, the nutrition label on foods is
important for several reasons.
"It gives you a standardized way of un
derstanding the content of the food you
eat," she said. "There are some things
about a label that make it easy to compare
products. You also get a feel for how what
you're eating may fit into the goals you're
trying to make."
Freshman Esther Cheng said she often
reads nutrition labels for their relative nu
tritional values.
"Sometimes when I'm comparing two
things to eat I look at the nutrition label,"
she said. "I use the nutrition label as a basis
of comparison because I define something
as nutritional if it doesn't have a lot of
sugar, if it is low in fat, and it has more un
saturated fats than saturated fats."
Due to regulations from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, all nutrition la
bels are equipped with the same basic com
ponents: serving size, calories, fat, choles
terol, sodium, carbohydrate and protein.
The FDA also has a Web site dedicated
that provides information and tips for nav
igating nutrition labels.
According to the FDA, the first thing to
look at in a nutrition label is the serving size.
Serving size makes it easy to compare similar
foods because such ftxxls are measured in
the same units, usually a household measure
like cups or grams. In some instances, mea

surement
may be a result of
convention rather than an actual unit. The
standard serving size for bread, for example,
is the slice.
A slice of Wonderbread. however, is dif
ferent from a slice of Pepperidge Farm
bread. Because they differ in density and
thickness, it may not make sense to com
pare the absolute number of calories or
grams of fat listed for each "slice" on the
nutrition label. This is precisely the reason
students at Stanford should skim the entire
nutrition label, taking into account details
such as serving size, Mackey said.
After taking a gander at the serving size,
it is helpful to focus on calories, which tell
you how much energy you are getting from
a serving size of food.
Though most nutrition labels are based
on the average recommendation of a 2,000
calorie diet. Mackey said this number is not
necessarily optimal for everyone. Each
person has different caloric needs depend
ing on his or her current size and health
goals.
"If you're trying to manage weight, [the
number of calories] would be important,"
Mackey said. "Based on what your activity
level is and what your metabolism is, you
can adjust your calories."
"Two-thousand calories is a reference
number. If you're extremely active, you
may need many more calories. If you're not
fit, you may need far fewer calories," she
added.
For those who want a more thorough
understanding of what is in their food, it
might be helpful to look at the nutrient
content. On a nutrition label, nutrients are
usually separated by a thick bar. Lying

above the bar are nu
trients that Ameri
cans tend to overeat:
total fat, cholesterol
and sodium. Below
are the nutrients
Americans must be
sure to consume: di
etary fiber and vitamins.
Each nutrient has an ex-

planation of how many

grams or milligrams are pre
sent in the product and how those

measurements trans
late into percentages of the
recommended daily values.
But how are you sup
posed to know what's nec
essary for your percent
daily value? If you really
can't figure it out. the FDA

amount and 20 percent or
more is "high."
