## Editorial Harvard's Summers should stay but attention needed 
### 
It's been a month and a half since Lawrence Sum
mers, the president of Harvard, spoke about women
in academia at a National Bureau of Economic Re
search conference and started a controversy is still
playing itself out in Cambridge. While Summers' re
marks were not well-chosen, the speech alone should
not cause his resignation, as some Harvard faculty are
demanding. The question that should be debated in
the media is not whether Summers is an insensitive
sexist or a victim of excessive political correctness, as
the left and right have been arguing, but why there is
so little public knowledge about gender and
academia.
As Stanford President John Hennessy said in a
Faculty Senate, we believe that the women at Stan
ford are just as intelligent as the men, and we fully sup
port our female faculty and their contributions.
Summer's remarks were deliberately contentious.
He provoked his audience by challenging the ideas
that socialization and discrimination are the main rea
sons women make up less of the professoriate. In
stead, he suggested that the distribution of intelli
gence between men and women might be the second
most-important factor behind the difficulty of raising
a family while pursuing tenure, with discrimination as
the third. He argued that women and men may be
equally smart on average, but there may not be as
many exceptionally intelligent women as there are
men. He obviously has been pondering this question
during his term at Harvard and has probably won
dered as much as outsiders have why female faculty
hires have dropped on his watch. So he extrapolated
from his experience and perhaps from his prejudices
to present his very personal views on why faculties
have not diversified more quickly.
Discrimination plays a small role, he said, because
the pool of available candidates just isn't large
enough. Socialization may play a smaller role than
previously thought, he opined, and he concluded that
women are either being pushed out by the excessive
demands of the tenure system or they are not quite as
intelligent on the high end.
Galling, right? Actually, there are more unan-

swered questions than many of Summers' critics ac
knowledge. No one is sure why female representation
in scientific fields has not trickled up to the professo
riate as quickly as might be possible, given that more
women graduate from college, and in many scientific
fields there are almost as many women as men receiv
ing bachelor's degrees.
But Summers' approach, which he now acknowl
edges was uninformed, lacked a firm grounding in sci
ence. His main piece of evidence for the skewed intel
ligence hypothesis was the test scores of men and
women coming out of high school. Women score high
er than men on average, but there are more men at the
top end. But these tests are not necessarily reliable in
dicators of intelligence — high school graduates have
already been shaped by the forces of socialization.
The reaction to Summers' comments has been
heated. Summers could have been quicker to re
spond, and we understand his hesitance to release a
transcript; the speech was more anecdotal than statis
tical, and not a very good piece of scientific work. But
calls for his resignation should go unheeded.
Summers should have realized that while he is Har
vard's president, his words in every capacity are sub
ject to scrutiny. And he should have been more care
ful not to make comments that might have been con
strued as excuses for discrimination, as well as for his
own poor record with diversity. But Summers' re
marks since then have shown that he understands the
gravity of his mistake, and the controversy he sparked
will hopefully do more good than harm in the long
run.
Hennessy's response was moderate and struck just
the right tone. Along with the presidents of Princeton
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Hen
nessy noted that the focus should not be on debating
why women are not in the sciences but on how to en
courage more women to enter science and engineer
ing. Progress is still being made and representation is
improving. The possibility of innate differences
s'hould be researched, and even discussed, but univer-
sity administrations should focus on
aspects they can change, such as dis
crimination and the tenure system.
Stanford students and faculty
should not ignore the national con
troversy. It has created a prime op
portunity to educate the public
about research into gender differ

ences, both social and genetic. If the
president of Harvard does not know
of all the research and lets personal
bias infect his speech, consider what
the average academic knows — or
even worse, the average politician.
The larger danger is that discussion
of innate differences will mask institu
tional bias or be used as en excuse to
justify fewer efforts to attract and re
tain women. Hopefully, instead. Sum
mers' remarks will be used to foster
more research, more discussions and
eventually more understanding.
