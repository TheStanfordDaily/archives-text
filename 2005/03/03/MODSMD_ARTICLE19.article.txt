# Writing in the Margins
## A
						picture is worth 500 to 600 words

Cynthia O/.ick averts her gaze
from the camera. Her lips turn up-

ward in a small,
inconspicuous
smile. Her hair,
white and wiry,
forms a helmet
that surrounds
her face. Ozick
does not appear
to he a real per
son. She looks
like a character
from a hook, a

fine dose of lighthearted fiction. Her
photograph looks like a painting, an
artist's rendering of a great, comic
character from the mid-20th centu
ry
But Ozick is a real person. Her
visage graces the dust jackets of
books, most recently "Heir to the
Glimmering World." Her picture in
trigues and enchants. I imagine that
her books will read like her picture:

engaging, interesting and slightly
comical. I decided to read "Heir to
the Glimmering World" because of
O/.ick's picture.
An author's photograph has a lot
of power; it can alter one's percep
tion of a novel. The picture of
Jonathan Franzen that graces copies
of "The Corrections" makes me
want to dislike the novel immediate
ly. Franzen looks like an asshat. He
stares directly at the camera, his hair
finely styled, his glasses resting on
his nose just so, with stubble to imply
that he is a lot cooler than his formal
shirt and coat suggest.
Everything is lit so that Franzen
looks intriguing and deep, the left
side of his face drenched in shadow.
Ugh. Why do 1 want to read this?
Looking at the picture, Franzen
stares at me. "1 am so much cooler
than you. Buy my book. Worship
me. I am hip. I'm not afraid to stare
at you, puny white boy of the west.

For I am Jonathan Fran/en. God of
the Literary World."
Luckily for Franzen, I am not
scared off by his photographic the
atrics and read his books. But be
cause of his amazingly pretentious
visage, I must make a distinction be
tween the author and the person. I
find myself checking my praise of
Franzen's writing ("How to Be
Alone" positively excretes genius),
with denunciation of his person
("Jonathan Franzen must be a
misogynist. He probably likes Alice
Munro because Munro's women are
far from perfect... ").
No one has mastered the art of
dusk-jacket photography if Alice
Munro hasn't. Her picture, as
Franzen notes in his review of
Munro's most recent collection, fea
tures her smiling. It's so refreshing
to have an author smile at me.
