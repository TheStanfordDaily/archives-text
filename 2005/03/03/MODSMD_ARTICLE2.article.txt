# Women head to San Jose
## 
### ANTARDEB GUHARAY STAFF WRITER 
The onset of March means only one thing
for most sports fans across the nation: tourna
ment basketball. Although it's not quite time
to start the office pools for the NCAA Tour
nament, conference tournaments are starting
all across the country this weekend.
While other teams will be fighting for their
NCAA Tournament lives in their respective
conferences, the No. 2 Stanford women (26-2,
17-1 Pacific-10 Conference) have already es
tablished themselves among the nation's elite.
The Pac-10 Tournament this weekend in San
Jose will serve as a test-run for the well-oiled
machine that is the Cardinal basketball team.
" I think the Pac-10 Tournament gives us
two great opportunities," head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "First, is the tournament at
mosphere â€” you know you got one game and
done if you don't play well, so you have to
come out and bring your 'A' game every
night. The Pac-10 Tournament also has us

playing against great competition. They know
us, so they're really going to be working on
some great strategy."
With the exception of an early season loss
to Oregon, the two-time defending Pac-10
champion Cardinal have marched through
their regular season conference schedule with
little trouble. Stanford has beaten its Pac-10
foes by an average of 24.9 points per game.
Three more wins in San Jose would keep the
ball rolling fora tournament run.
"The Pac-lOs gives us a chance to improve
and gain momentum into the NCAAs," se
nior guard Kelley Suminski said. "We don't
take anything for granted just because we
have a good Pac-10 record. I think we'll be
ready to play and play our best basketball."
In the first round, the top-seeded Cardinal
will face the winner of Friday's game between
eighth-seeded California (10-17, 4-14) and
ninth-seeded Washington State (6-21, 2-16).
Stanford ran away with both games against

Cal, winning 88-53 and 91-50. The Cardi
nal dominated the Cougars 72-39 in the
teams' first matchup, hut Washington
State managed to hang relatively close in
the rematch, falling 69-56.
"Washington State has been playing
well recently and hung tough with us,"
freshman guard Candice Wiggins said.
"But we're not too concerned with who
we play, we're only concerned with our
game."
Wiggins, a virtual lock for Pac-10
Freshman of the Year, has had a phe

nomenal rookie season for the Cardinal
so far, leading the team with 17.2 points
per game.
"I feel like it's going to he a very dif
ferent atmosphere with teams playing to
get into the tournament and stay alive,"
Wiggins said. "It's going to he really dif
ferent from the regular season."
The Cardinal will be missing senior
forward T'Nae Thiel for the Pac-10
Tournament and have a number of play
ers that aren't necessarily injured, but
are banged up at the end of the regular
season.
"I think our team is very hungry,"
VanDerveer said. "The thing that I
am concerned about is the three
games in three days, especially in our
situation with the 'crutches team,' the

'mash unit.'"
Unlike last season's team that relied
heavily on current WNBA player Nicole
Powell, this year's Cardinal team has re
lied on contributions from everyone on
the roster. This weekend's tournament
should provide a forum for Stanford to
fine tune its game and allow some un
foreseen stars to step up to the limelight.
"I see this as an opportunity for our
players to improve - playing better post
defense without T'Nae and rebounding
better," VanDerveer said. "I think we're
going to see some players that were role
players in the regular season that are
going to bust out in the Pac-lOs."
A good showing this weekend should
lock up a high seed for the Cardinal at
the NCAAs.
