The onset of March means only one thing
for most sports fans across the nation: tourna
ment basketball. Although it's not quite time
to start the office pools for the NCAA Tour
nament, conference tournaments are starting
all across the country this weekend.
While other teams will be fighting for their
NCAA Tournament lives in their respective
conferences, the No. 2 Stanford women (26-2,
17-1 Pacific-10 Conference) have already es

to Oregon, the two-time defending Pac-10
champion Cardinal have marched through

foes by an average of 24.9 points per game.
Three more wins in San Jose would keep the
ball rolling fora tournament run.
"The Pac-lOs gives us a chance to improve
and gain momentum into the NCAAs," se
nior guard Kelley Suminski said. "We don't
take anything for granted just because we
have a good Pac-10 record. I think we'll be
ready to play and play our best basketball."
In the first round, the top-seeded Cardinal
will face the winner of Friday's game between
eighth-seeded California (10-17, 4-14) and
ninth-seeded Washington State (6-21, 2-16).
