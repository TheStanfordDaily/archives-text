## The 						Band embodies originality 
### CHRIS HOLT 
In Glenn Truitt's column, "Why 1 Hate the Band"
(Mar. 1), he leaves out some key details that would great
ly enhance his argument. First, the undergraduate institu
tion that he so longingly recalls is none other than the
United States Naval Academy. The Stanford Band is
ready to concede it cannot march as well as the military or
play as well as professionals. Second, he forgets to men
tion that he was once a member of Cardinal Competitive
Cheer, or CCC. an organization that shares time with the
Band. While we harbor no ill will toward CCC, in a previ
ous letter to the editor he has made his dislike of our or
ganization apparent.
Truitt claims that the Band is not funny. While he is
free to believe so, I think he should have looked into the
subject further. As a law student, one would assume he
would know to obtain evidence before building a case.
He overlooked that every week we must submit a script
of our field show to the Athletic Department for ap
proval. We are limited by what jokes we can make. At
Big Game, for instance, we are not allowed to say Cal,
Weenies, Berkeley or Golden Bears. We will strive to
improve our humor, but it becomes harder when you are
limited by what you can say.
And I'm glad Truitt enjoyed the USC Marching
Band. What's not to love about them? Though they have

a student body twice our size and mandate that every
music major play in the band, they impressively play two
songs very well. We appreciate their dedication to his
torical accuracy too; their stiff goose-stepping perfectly
reenacts a fascist army from the 19405.
Our students seem to love them too. Although Truitt
called our fans "apathetic," our student section turned
their backs and yelled "boring" when USC played at
half-time. After hearing "Tribute to Troy" 47 times, I
can hardly blame the fans.
The Band is made up of students, run by students and
for the students. This commitment is reflected in special
fees voting: we routinely are one of the groups to get the
most "yes" votes.
The reason for this is simple: You will not see a typi
cal marching band playing for local charities, communi
ty events and elementary schools. You will not find typ
ical marching bands starting the school year with an an
nual "Band Run" or rocking "Full Moon on the Quad"
or playing in MemAud's fountain to welcome ProFros.
Stanford's spirit is original. From our Dollies to our
Tree to our comedy performances, we embody that orig
inality.
