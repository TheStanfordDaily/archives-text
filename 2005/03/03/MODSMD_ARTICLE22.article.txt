# Let it be
## Not enough women in science? Good for them! 
### 
With all the Cuss about the low
percentage of women faculty in sci
ence and engineering, people have
started asking, "Why aren't more
women going into these fields?"
Maybe the real question is, "Why
are so many men going into them?"
Science and engineering demand

big investments
for uncertain re
wards. Students
must endure four
years of difficult
undergraduate
courses, perhaps
a few years of
master's study
and around seven
years of graduate
study to earn a

Ph.D. Their reward fora decade of
minimum wage apprenticeship?
More of the same.
Most Ph.D.s go through several
postdoctoral positions before get
ting on the tenure track, which itself
is not job security but only a chance
to compete for it. Compare this with
law and business, where talented
students can start making high
salaries while their science friends
are still teaching freshman physics
labs.
Getting a faculty position is espe
cially hard for scientists, because
outside of the biosciences, there's a
bigger supply of science Ph.D.s than
the market can employ. The Bureau
of Labor Statistics predicts that em
ployment of physicists and as
tronomers will grow more slowly
than the average profession, and
that employment of mathematicians
will actually contract. Even for bio
logical scientists, the bureau predicts
"considerable competition for inde
pendent research positions."
John Katz, a physics professor at
Washington University, St. Louis,
published a letter on his Web site ad
vising students not to go into science.
"Why am I (a tenured professor of
physics) trying to discourage you
from following a career path which
was successful for me?" he wrote.
"Because times have changed (1 re
ceived my Ph.D. in 1973, and tenure
in 1976). American science no
longer offers a reasonable career
path. If you go to graduate school in
science it is in the expectation of
spending your working life doing sci
entific research, usint> your ingenu

ity and curiosity to solve important
and interesting problems. You will
almost certainly he disappointed,
probably when it is too late to
choose another career."
So maybe not going into science
isn't a sign that women aren't as ca
pable as men; maybe it's a sign that
they're a bit smarter.
And there's reason to believe
that the smartest students are turn
ing away from science. A recent
study — published by Issues in Sci
ence and Technology, the quarterly
policy publication from the National
Academies of Science — found that
the top scorers on the Graduate
Record Exam, or GRE, are increas
ingly choosing other fields. Eight
percent fewer of the top scorers
went into science and engineering in
2000 than in 1992. The drop for
mathematics was 19 percent; for en
gineering, 25 percent. In contrast, 88
percent more top GRE scorers en
rolled in graduate programs for
health professions like physical ther
apy, speech and language pathology
and public health. Business adminis
tration enrollment was up by nearly
one-third.
But the stereotype of scientists as
society's smartest people persists. In
their book "Know Your Child's IQ,"
Glen Wilson and Diana Grylls write
that people with IQs of 140 are often
professors and research scientists,
whereas nurses and schoolteachers
should have IQs around 120.
Are scientists really smarter?
And is science really a more intellec
tually challenging job than other
jobs?
Having researched in six labs and
won three national science scholar
ships, I'd say no to the second ques
tion. In my experience, lab techni
cians' work is no more mentally
stimulating than working on an as
sembly line, and most senior scien
tists' work writing grant applications
is uncannily similar to public rela
tions.
The emotional benefits of science
are also exaggerated. Rather than
discovering things no one has known
before, scientists usually study a sin
gle topic ad nauseam, with no clear
connection between their work and
any benefit to humanity. If people
want to feel like they are helping
others, they should go into social
