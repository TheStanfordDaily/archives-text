Lock of practice space on campus
shameful
When the cops showed up at my
door yesterday, I wasn't too sur
prised. They were prepared to
charge me with "disturbing the
peace" and confiscate my drum kit if
1 continued to practice my drums in
my EV apartment. I realized that no
one wants to live next to a drummer
and in an ideal world, I wouldn't he
forced to use my apartment as a
practice space.
However, the lack of practice
space at and around Stanford had
driven me to that extreme. My band
does rent practice space from Stan
ford, but for all graduate and under
graduate students at this school
there is ONE practice room for rock
and jazz groups. Thus groups are
only allowed to use the space fora
maximum of three hours a week.
That is not enough time.
The lack of space for student arts

isn't limited to music practice space.
The Daily has recently written about
the future transformation of Roble
Ciym due to dire need for more dance
and drama practice space. There is
also a critical lack of studio space for
visual artists. The only way for stu
dents to gain access to studio space on
campus is to be in the MFA program
or currently be enrolled in a nearly
impossible-to-get-into-unless-you're-
an-Art-Major studio art classes.
Granted, there are many compet
ing claims for space at Stanford.
However, I have to question Stanford
administration's stated commitment
to supporting the arts when Stanford
agrees to spend $375 to $420 million
on constructing a new Science and
Technology Quad while limiting its
support of the arts to hosting work
shops and lectures like the recent
"Encounter Merce" project.

Smokers are 'productive
members of society'
Nancy Wang's Feb. 23 article,
"Think you can smoke anywhere?
Think again." was a patronizing Op-Ed
thinly disguised as news. Think Stan
ford tolerates diversity? Think again.
From the headline, one would ex
pect the article to itemize or analyze
Stanlord's restrictions on smokers.
Yet what follows is an evangelical
tract against a benighted minority.
When Wang extracts confessions
from two occasional smokers, she
does so not to "explain" their deci
sion but to pathologize and cure
what she considers a disease.
We do not owe you an explana
tion, let alone an excuse. Smokers
are productive members of society,
occupying high stations in business,
law, medicine, government, military,
and academia. 1 can't dispute your
data correlating smoking with
"health-compromising behaviors
such as high-risk sexual behavior,"
but I would argue a broader correla
tion between smoking and sexual
behavior of all kinds. Anecdotal evi
dence even suggests that smokers
enjoy their sexual behavior more
than non-smokers.
The college-aged liberals have
targeted us with the same progres
sive salvo that will, they know, assim
ilate or obliterate all backwater
parochials who oppose abortion, be
lieve God created the universe, or
eat meat. "I think smoking has
stayed the same," says one subject.
"It's hard to tell because you don't
see too many smokers around cam
pus but you know they're there.
Sometimes you smell them down the
hall, sometimes you see them outside
late at night." Are we an infestation
of vermin, or partisans caught behind
advancing lines? Either way, your
plans for us are clear.

Daily misrepresented Scheuer's
stance
I am very dissatisfied with the
Daily's coverage of the Michael
Scheuer event. The article, "Author
blasts war on terror" (Mar. 2), total
ly missed the major points of
Scheuer's talk. The article is filled
with misquotes and out-of-context,
incoherent sentences. One misquote
states that "Now other nations can
not distinguish between an Ameri
can founder and an Atlantic floun

der." When commenting on how
today's government is not represen
tative and in tune with the ideals
America was founded on, Scheuer
said that the current administration
cannot distinguish between an
American founder and an Atlantic
flounder.
Also, I would think that a writer
covering a story might have at least
done a little research for background
information. If you know anything
about Scheuer or read either of his
books you could see how this article
falls very short of summarizing the
views he expressed.
One of Scheuer's main points is
that the American press and political
leadership do not understand why
Osama Bin Laden and A1 Qaeda are
opposed to the U.S. A common mis
conception is that Bin Laden and his
followers are opposed to America
because they hate freedom and don't
like what we are and what we think.
This is not the case. Bin Laden
and his followers are opposed to
"what we do," namely what we do as
a result of specific U.S. foreign poli
cies. In fact, Scheuer, who is the for
mer chief of the Counterterrorist
Center's Bin Laden Unit in the CIA,
reveals in his book "Imperial
Hubris" that Bin Laden's public
statements condemn the following
policies: America's protection of
corrupt Arab regimes, unqualified
support for Israel, the occupation of
Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. troops
on the Arabian Peninsula and U.S.
pressure on Arab energy producers
to keep oil prices low.
Scheuer states that unless U.S.
leaders recognize their errant path
we are going to continue losing the
so-called "War On Terror."
