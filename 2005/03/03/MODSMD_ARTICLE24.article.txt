Lock of practice space on campus
shameful
When the cops showed up at my
door yesterday, I wasn't too sur
prised. They were prepared to
charge me with "disturbing the
peace" and confiscate my drum kit if
1 continued to practice my drums in
my EV apartment. I realized that no
one wants to live next to a drummer
and in an ideal world, I wouldn't he
forced to use my apartment as a
practice space.
However, the lack of practice
space at and around Stanford had
driven me to that extreme. My band
does rent practice space from Stan
ford, but for all graduate and under
graduate students at this school
there is ONE practice room for rock
and jazz groups. Thus groups are
only allowed to use the space fora
maximum of three hours a week.
That is not enough time.
The lack of space for student arts

isn't limited to music practice space.
The Daily has recently written about
the future transformation of Roble
Ciym due to dire need for more dance
and drama practice space. There is
also a critical lack of studio space for
visual artists. The only way for stu
dents to gain access to studio space on
campus is to be in the MFA program
or currently be enrolled in a nearly
impossible-to-get-into-unless-you're-
an-Art-Major studio art classes.
Granted, there are many compet
ing claims for space at Stanford.
However, I have to question Stanford
administration's stated commitment
to supporting the arts when Stanford
agrees to spend $375 to $420 million
on constructing a new Science and
Technology Quad while limiting its
support of the arts to hosting work
shops and lectures like the recent
"Encounter Merce" project.

Smokers are 'productive
members of society'
Nancy Wang's Feb. 23 article,
"Think you can smoke anywhere?
Think again." was a patronizing Op-Ed
thinly disguised as news. Think Stan
ford tolerates diversity? Think again.
From the headline, one would ex
pect the article to itemize or analyze
Stanlord's restrictions on smokers.
Yet what follows is an evangelical
tract against a benighted minority.
When Wang extracts confessions
from two occasional smokers, she
does so not to "explain" their deci
sion but to pathologize and cure
what she considers a disease.
We do not owe you an explana
tion, let alone an excuse. Smokers
are productive members of society,
occupying high stations in business,
law, medicine, government, military,
and academia. 1 can't dispute your
