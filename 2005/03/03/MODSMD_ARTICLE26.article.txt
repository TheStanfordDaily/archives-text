On March .?, WW, The Daily announced the arrival of
Joseph Bonnett, world famous organist, to Stanford.
Below is an excerpt:

"Joseph Bonnett, the distinguished French organ vir
tuoso, who has come to America under the auspices of
the French-American Association for Musical Art. will
play fora University assembly next Friday morning at 11
oVclock in the Memorial Church.
"Through the artistic success of Joseph Bonnett the
organ recital has enjoyed an unprecedented popularity
in the musical world which has not been found since the
days of the famous Guilmant.
"One of the most remarkable features of Bonnett?s
playing is that all of his selections are rendered from
memory and he is said to have the largest repertoire of
any artist in his line. During the season of 1910-1911
Bonnett gave more than forty recitals at St. Eustache in
France, no single piece being played more than once and
all of the recitals rendered from memory. These recitals
proved the means ol inaugurating tin Paris a great popu
lar movement in favor of organ music and the same at
tempt has proved successful in the Untied States as far as
Joseph Bonnett is concerned.
"Bonnett is said to have a remarkable personality,
which is one of the causes for his phenomenal success.

He is a master of technique and his powers of interpreta
tions have given him a style comparable only the famous
Guilmant almost one hundred years ago."
On March / 966, in the midst of the Vietnam War, The
Daily covered a talk given by the National Service Direc
tor at Stanford explaining the details of the U-S test given
to students nationwide. Students who did not rank well in
their class were eligible for the draft, while higher-ranking
students had the possibility of deferment. Below is an ex
cerpt:
"I would urge all Stanford men to take the Selective
Service College Qualification Test,? National Service
Director Walter J. Findeisen said yesterday. '/Stanford
students have historically done well on these tests.?
?Findeisen?s comment was part of a Stu-Fac Board
sponsored discussion on the current draft deferment sit
uation.
"Explaining the Selective Service 's dual deferment
criteria was the purpose of the discussion. Draft
boards, Findeisen noted, will now consider both class
rank and qualification test scores in granting 11-S de
ferments.
" The test is designed primarily to enable college
freshmen and high school seniors to demonstrate their
capacity to do college level work,'.' Findeisen explained.
? I'he test will probably be similar to college aptitude
tests? for high school seniors, he said.
"During the Korean War. freshman deferments were
based on standing in the upper half of the class; sopho
mores, upper two-thirds; juniors, three-fourths; and se
niors with graduate school plans, one-fourth.
?"Feideisen reminded students that ?one does not
necessarily get a deferment because he makes the right
average.? Classification depends entirely on the local
boards, he said."
