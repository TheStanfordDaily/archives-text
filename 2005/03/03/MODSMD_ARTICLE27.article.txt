# Candidates face tight election race
## 
### COURTNEY WEAVER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU has received more
than 100 declarations of intent
from undergraduate students run
ning for executive president, exec
utive vice-president, class presi
dent or senator. This is a sharp in
crease in the number of candi
dates who will run, up from 48 in
2004.
The students appearing on the
official roster of candidates will
have to receive a set number of sig
natures of support, varying from
1(K) for senatorial candidates to 2(X)
for executive slates, which consist
of two people. The only other re
quirement for the candidates run
ning is to attend a Campaign Prac
tice Code meeting tonight.
The meeting will cover this
year's reforms to the ASSU elec
tion process, which were made in
hopes of preventing improper
campaigning. In 2004, the misuse
of e-mail lists for campaigning re
sulted in the overturn of the first
election's results, prompting the
need fora special election.
The ASSU has since clarified
the candidates' right to any form
of free speech, which includes en
dorsement from student groups
and free use of e-mail lists for
campaign promotion, as long as
the messages fulfill the list's origi
nal purpose, according to Univer
sity rules.
ASSU Chair Chris Lin. a se
nior, hopes that these new
changes will leave little room for
confusion.
"There tends to be a lot of con
troversy surrounding ASSU elec
tions, usually about one a year,"
Lin said. "We're going to take
kind of a hands-off approach."
According to ASSU Elections
Commissioner Troy Steinmetz, a
sophomore, this method will give
the power to regulate campaign
behavior over to the voters.
"Short of [someone] hacking
into the campaign system, most
everything else is going to fall into
the hands of the University and
the voters."
"Voters are going to know that
they're the first line of defense
against ridiculous campaign be

havior," he added.
Steinmetz noted that overuse
of the new e-mail policy would
end up being counter-productive
for the candidates and several
have already decided against that
type of propaganda altogether.
"We do not plan to do a lot of
glitzy advertising or spamming,
[but] will focus our campaigning
on face-to-face meetings with as
many students as possible," said
ASSU executive candidate
Melanie Kannokada, a junior,
who is running with junior Aneto
Okonkwo. Okonkwo is also a re
porter for The Daily.
Freshman senatorial candi
date Kai Lukoff said he is skep
tical of the campaigning process
in general.
"From what I've heard, cam
paigning is just a ludicrous popu
larity contest, but one that you
have to participate in [in order to
be elected]," he said.
Lukoff added that he plans to
take a more traditional approach
to campaigning by meeting
friends of friends in other dorms.
"It's a more honest mechanism
that provides a character recom
mendation rather than the super
ficiality of sitting in the bathroom
stall and looking at the flashiest
flyer," Lukoff said.
He said he hopes to use a cam
paign strategy that highlights his
platform of "simple changes that
could be used to improve life at
Stanford."
Lin said he thinks that many of
the campaigns, however, will
focus on bigger issues such as the
new undergraduate housing plans
and student space.
Kannokada cited both as
major components of her slate's
platform, especially in regards to
creating "more welcoming 24-
hour study, play and group-pro
ject space across campus."
There is no single cause for rise
in the number of candidates,
though Lin suggested a variety of
factors — notably the change
from a four-person junior-class
presidential slate to a five-person
one, which allows two of the mem
bers to go abroad. Another factor
may have been the availability of
declaration of intent forms online.
