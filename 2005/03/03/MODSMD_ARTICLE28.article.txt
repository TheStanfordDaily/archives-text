## The 						Double Clutch More ramblings about ramblings 
### 
Dateline, WEDNESDAY - I opened
The Daily this morning and found that
Dan McCarthy had put his name on my
column.
Well, not really. (It's a bad idea to falsely ac
cuse the night editor of theft.)
But I had planned the same smorgasboard
of attention-deficit complaining that Dan en
gaged in — complete with talk of the Warriors,
Barry Bonds' head and Pac-1() hoops. He even
reprised my latent criticisms of Fox's "The
Snorts List."

Thus I had to tear up copy
and start fresh. At least it
forced me to be original, and 1
didn't have to go far for new
material.
McCarthy's clairvoyance
was a sour cherry on top of the
previous day's shocker, when
1 opened to the opinion page
and found Glenn Truitt diss
ing on the Stanford Band -

and praising USC's! After all
the work 1 did in January calling out the Tro
jans, Truitt goes and propagandizes for the
other side (described as "the enemy" by former
Band majorette Lori Karns.)
There were arcane and muted references to
the Band allegedly embarrassing the school. It
was called "an abortive mess." And there was
talk of the "pageantry" of the sport.
Well, someone needs to get over himself and
admit the truth — it's all but declared that the
point of the Band is to embarrass the school.
Preferably on national TV. (To take a cue from
the anti-censorship crowd, anyone who has a
problem with it can get up at halftime and buy
an overpriced hot dog. Or a four-freaking-dol
lar frozen malt.)

As for pageantry, I actually enjoy
such things from my favorite sport of
college football. But pageantry
doesn't have to mean goose-stepping
across the field in wool uniforms
playing "Tequila" and "Hang On
Sloopy" or my (not) favorite, "Louie
Louie." The Band goes a little way to
ward reminding us that they're play
ing a darn game on the field, and we
should have fun.
No doubt band member and opin
ions columnist Chris Holt is penning
a witty, acerbic and sharp-tongued
reply that will set the record straight.

(I'm counting on you, Chris. Don't
make me write it.)
Anyway, now for the "rave" por
tion of the column. We're coming up
on one of my favorite periods in the
sporting calendar - tournament
week. Conference tournament week,
that is.
It's almost the best time of the
year for me - right behind college
football rivalry weekend. Bowl Week
and the day Duke loses in the NCAA
tourney.
For one last week, conference
members are up against each other
on the hardcourt. This time with the
brass ring on the line - an NCAA
tournament bid.
It's the last time to shine for Bub
ble Teams, and an opportunity for
any team to go into the national tour

ney on a roll.
On display will he all the intensi
ty and fire of the sectional rivalries
that enrich the college game. The
cannibalism of the Big Ten. The raw
hatred of the Southeastern Confer
ence. The Holy Week of the ACC,
where basketball is Tobacco Road's
religion.
And now that the Dead Week of
sports is almost over, we can get
ready for
Selection Sunday and baseball's
opening day, with more Jason Gi
ambi cheeseburger stories waiting to
come out.
