Dateline, WEDNESDAY - I opened
The Daily this morning and found that
Dan McCarthy had put his name on my
column.
Well, not really. (It's a bad idea to falsely ac
cuse the night editor of theft.)
But I had planned the same smorgasboard
of attention-deficit complaining that Dan en
gaged in — complete with talk of the Warriors,
Barry Bonds' head and Pac-1() hoops. He even
reprised my latent criticisms of Fox's "The
Snorts List."

Thus I had to tear up copy
and start fresh. At least it
forced me to be original, and 1
didn't have to go far for new
material.
McCarthy's clairvoyance
was a sour cherry on top of the
previous day's shocker, when
1 opened to the opinion page
and found Glenn Truitt diss
ing on the Stanford Band -

and praising USC's! After all
the work 1 did in January calling out the Tro
jans, Truitt goes and propagandizes for the
other side (described as "the enemy" by former
Band majorette Lori Karns.)
There were arcane and muted references to
the Band allegedly embarrassing the school. It
was called "an abortive mess." And there was
talk of the "pageantry" of the sport.
Well, someone needs to get over himself and
admit the truth — it's all but declared that the
point of the Band is to embarrass the school.
Preferably on national TV. (To take a cue from
the anti-censorship crowd, anyone who has a
problem with it can get up at halftime and buy
an overpriced hot dog. Or a four-freaking-dol
lar frozen malt.)
