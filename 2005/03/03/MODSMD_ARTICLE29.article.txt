# Coach watches program rise
## Fontaine, Card head to Utah 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Think basketball is bigger than gymnastics? Think
again.
Welcome to Utah.
Approximately 14,000 pairs of eyes will be watching
the No. 28 Stanford women's gymnastics team (2-4, 2-3
Pacific-10 Conference) march into the Huntsman Center
on Friday night to face No. 3 Utah, No. 6 Florida and No.
52 California.
That's almost twice as many people as will pack
Maples Pavilion to watch the Stanford men's basketball
game tonight. The Utes attracted 14,100 people to their
last meet and instead of a halftone show, they have fire
works.
Stanford will be competing not only under the eyes of
the largest crowd in collegiate gymnastics, but also under
a backdrop of 10 national championship banners. If there
were banners for the most Ail-American honors in gym
nastics or for the longest regular-season winning streak at
home in any NCAA sport, those would be hanging from
the rafters as well.
For those keeping score at home, that would be 244
All-American honors and a 23-year long streak from 1979
to 2002.
While Utah has qualified for the NCAA National
Championships every year since its inception in 1982.
Stanford has only appeared seven times. The Utes are on
a 23-year qualifying streak while the Cardinal are on a
four-year streak.
Any streak for the Cardinal, however, is considerable
improvement in the eyes of assistant coach Larissa
Fontaine, who joined Stanford's program as a gymnast in
19% - a time when Stanford had garnered only three All-
American honors and two appearances at Nationals.
An 11 th-place finisher at the Olympic trials in 19% and
a six-year member of the senior national team, Fontaine
was one of the first big-name gymnasts to come to the
Farm. While Fontaine said academics, not gymnastics, at
tracted her to Stanford, she won vault at NCAA Nation
als in 1998 and remains the team's first and only individu
al event champion.
Over her nine years as both a gymnast and a coach,
Fontaine has watched Stanford's program grow from a
small team struggling to make Nationals to a force that
even the Utes deem formidable. Last year, Stanford fin
ished third at Nationals compared to a seventh-place fin
ish by Utah.
Friday night will be somewhat of a repeat performance
of last year's Nationals with three of the six teams com
peting — Utah, Florida and Stanford. Without the help of
its five graduated seniors, however. Stanford will be fight
ing an uphill battle.
"Our program is definitely growing and I believe that
someday it will be as big as Utah's," Fontaine said. 'But
right now. we're still young as far as history goes.
Fontaine remembers competing in a half-full Burn
ham Pavilion that may have been three quarters full on
the good nights. Average attendance in 1996 was 630, just
20 percent of the 3,(XX) person crowd that came to watch
Stanford take on UCLA at Maples Pavilion three weeks
ago.
Even the team's facility has grown. A $220,000 reno
vation of the gym at Ford Center was completed this year.
Designed by Fontaine and graduated senior Caroline
Fleurer as part of an engineering project, the renovation
includes a new set of bars, a foam pit to practice dis
mounts. new carpeting, a tumble track. Stanford gymnas

tics lettering on the walls and a glass etching of the team's
47 All-American awards — not quite 244. but better than
three.
The biggest change Fontaine has witnessed, however,
has been an increase in the caliber of gymnastics - not just
at Stanford, but nationwide. When Fontaine came to the
Farm in 1996. four of the seven members of the gold-win
ning Olympic team (gymnastics fans know them as the
Magnificent Seven) had signed letters of intent to com
pete in college, but none of them followed through.
This year, three Olympians are competing as freshmen
in college — Courtney Kupets on Georgia's team. Tasha
Schwikert on UCLA's team and Terin Humphrey on the
No. 7 Alabama team, which will be taking on the Cardinal
Sunday at Maples. Stanford boasts the fourth and 10th
place finishers at Olympic trials in freshmen Tabitha Yim
and LizTricase — both recruited by Fontaine.
The rise in competitive caliber started with the help of
gymnasts like Fontaine who saw college gymnastics as an
opportunity fora scholarship and a way to enjoy the team
aspect of an individual sport. As more gymnasts like
Fontaine joined the ranks, the level of gymnastics began
to rise and then snowballed as more and more top gym
nasts became involved.
"Gymnastics is a really unique sport since you usually
go to the Olympics in high school." Fontaine said. "So
girls didn't see college gymnastics as really competitive ..
. that has changed as the caliber has improved, and how
girls see college gymnastics as a competitive place where

they can improve rather than just
maintain their old skills.
"For most gymnasts today, college
gymnastics is the dream you end up
with. The Olympics is nice, but you re
alize that it is only six people every
four years."
One look at the packs of starry
eyed young gymnasts who attend
Stanford meets sporting their full
warmup suits and tight ponytails con
firms Fontaine's point.
Despite the changes and growth in
Stanford's program and collegiate
gymnastics in general, Fontaine still
sees plenty of similarities between
today's team and her own.
"Sometimes when I'm coaching
vault. I look down the runway and see
the girls standing around the chalk box
talking," Fontaine said. "I have the
exact same picture in my mind of my
class standing around the chalk box,
but now it is different people. It's real
ly neat to see the opportunity exist for
more people to share that connection
with the program."
On Friday night at Utah and on
Sunday afternoon at Maples. Fontaine
will give her gymnasts a pep-talk be
fore they compete on the vault. After
seeing each one vault, Fontaine will
then watch each gymnast run through
a gauntlet of high-fives from her team
mates. The same tradition supported
Fontaine when she became a national
champion on vault seven years ago.
"It's trivial from the outside, but
it's really important when you're a
part of it, especially since most gym
nasts are used to a very individual ap
proach to the sport," Fontaine said.
"Plus, it's fun to see them getting a kick
out of what we used to do back in the
day."
