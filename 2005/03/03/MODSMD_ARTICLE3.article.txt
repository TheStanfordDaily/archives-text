### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Before Saturday's game against Wash
ington, the Cardinal (16-10, 10-6 Pacific-10
Conference) will take a moment to honor
seniors Rob Little and Nick Robinson, both
of whom will play their final game on the
Maples Pavilion floor.
With the team's NCAA tournament
hopes on the line this weekend in its last
home series of the year against Washington
State (11-14, 6-10) and No. 13 Washington
(23-4,13-3), there won't be much time to re
flect on two illustrious careers. But that's
the way it has been all year, as Robinson
and Little have spent their final season on
the Farm helping the team prepare for
what's ahead instead of pausing to think
about their places in Cardinal history.
"I haven't seen anyone do as much as they
have done in a transition year," head coach
Trent Johnson said. "They lost their head

coach, three seniors [and] one of the best
players in the country. They've gone through
all the injuries we've had. But we're still here
and we're still in consideration for the post
season. It speaks to their leadership this year.
It's the biggest compliment I can give them."
Little is known for putting his teammates
first, sometimes to a fault. Johnson said he
was wondering why Little was late for prac
tice the other day when he realized that his
senior center was taking care of Anthony
Goods, a recruit for next season. That's a
job typically done by the players who will be
around to play with the recruit.
"Here I am, about to blow up at Rob for
being late, when it turns out he's talking to
Anthony," Johnson said. "Everybody else
is running around, doing their own thing,
and there's Rob, making sure the recruit's
doing okay. Rob is just in a different league
as a person."

Third place in sight

While Little is a vocal leader,
Robinson leads more by exam
ple, with his tough defense and
hard-nosed approach to re
bounding. Robinson's shooting
has suffered this year, but he
sank three big three-pointers to
help the Cardinal pull out a 58-
56 victory over Oregon last
weekend.
"Early on he wanted to do
well so badly for the team and I
think he started pressing," John
son said. "I told him to just be
himself, and I think recently
people have been sagging off of
him on defense, and he has
made some shots."
This weekend, Robinson will
likely be asked to guard Wash
ington State's Thomas Kelati,
who scored 17 points in the
teams' last meeting at Washing
ton State, a game the Cougars
won 60-51.
If the Cardinal win Thurs
day, they can finish no worse
than third place in the confer
ence. Stanford would win a
tiebreaker with UCLA since
the Cardinal have beaten the
Bruins twice.
But a win against Washington
State is not guaranteed. The
Cougars are coming off a win
over Arizona State and a one
point, overtime loss to Arizona.
At stake for the Cougars is a bet
ter seed in the Pac-10 Tourna
ment, which they would have to
win to make the NC A A Tourna

ment.
In addition to Kelati, the
Cardinal will have to worry
about Jeff Varem, a forward
who scored 18 points in the
teams' last meeting. Junior for
ward Matt Haryasz will guard
Varem.
Stanford will have to be
ready to adjust to two very dif
ferent paces this weekend.
Washington State likes to
keep the pace slow, usually forc
ing their opponents to play a
half-court game. Washington,
on the other hand, is a team that
likes to run. The Huskies aver
age a league-high 86.9 points per
game, while the Cougars score a
league-low 55.7 points per
game.
Junior point guard Chris
Hernandez compared the
teams' styles of play.
"Having to guard for 35 sec
onds can be really tiring, espe
cially if we play really hard de
fense and don't get lackadaisical
out there," Hernandez said
about Washington State. "It's
different with Washington be
cause you might not expect them
to take 20, 25 seconds off the
clock, but you're having to
sprint back and forth."
Washington is coming off a
93-85 victory over Arizona at
home. The Huskies will also be
playing to secure a spot this
weekend: first place in the
Pac-10.
