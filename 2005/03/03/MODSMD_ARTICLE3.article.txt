Before Saturday's game against Wash
ington, the Cardinal (16-10, 10-6 Pacific-10
Conference) will take a moment to honor
seniors Rob Little and Nick Robinson, both
of whom will play their final game on the
Maples Pavilion floor.
With the team's NCAA tournament
hopes on the line this weekend in its last
home series of the year against Washington
State (11-14, 6-10) and No. 13 Washington
(23-4,13-3), there won't be much time to re
flect on two illustrious careers. But that's
the way it has been all year, as Robinson
and Little have spent their final season on
the Farm helping the team prepare for
what's ahead instead of pausing to think
about their places in Cardinal history.
"I haven't seen anyone do as much as they
have done in a transition year," head coach
Trent Johnson said. "They lost their head

coach, three seniors [and] one of the best
players in the country. They've gone through
all the injuries we've had. But we're still here
and we're still in consideration for the post
season. It speaks to their leadership this year.
It's the biggest compliment I can give them."
Little is known for putting his teammates
first, sometimes to a fault. Johnson said he
was wondering why Little was late for prac
tice the other day when he realized that his
senior center was taking care of Anthony
Goods, a recruit for next season. That's a
job typically done by the players who will be
around to play with the recruit.
"Here I am, about to blow up at Rob for
being late, when it turns out he's talking to
Anthony," Johnson said. "Everybody else
is running around, doing their own thing,
and there's Rob, making sure the recruit's
doing okay. Rob is just in a different league
as a person."
