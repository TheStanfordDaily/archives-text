# Lindberg adjusting to libero
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITER 
Unlike most of his teammates, sopho
more Brian Lindberg didn't come to Stan
ford knowing that he would play volleyball.
Despite being a two-year letter-winner in
high school, Lindberg was not recruited to
the Stanford team. He walked on his fresh
man year — and didn't even spend most of
his time on the bench.
Lindberg appeared in 62 games, splitting
time at the libero position. This year, he is
the starting libero.
"The fact that 1 got to practice with the
team at all was just beyond any of my ex
pectations at that point," Lindberg said. "I
really didn't know what to expect. 1 just
came and played hard day to day — what
ever 1 could contribute to the team."
Does the sophomore starter feel pres
sured to play well?
"Yes," Lindberg said without hesitation.
"It's fine, though. There's pressure, but it's
not like it's a terrible thing. I mean. I enjoy
coming out every night and being part of the
team. There was more pressure last year,
when 1 just came in to serve at the end of
games. 1 thought that was harder. This year,
you're in; you've kind of got a starting posi
tion; you just go with it and you improve day
by day and you don't worry about it so
much."
But after all, the game should come nat
urally to the son of two former volleyball
players.
"Both my parents played," Lindberg

said. "That's actually how they met, so I
kind of owe my life to volleyball."
Lindberg started playing the sport in
high school, when a lot of his friends were
getting into it. However, he never played
libero before coming to Stanford.
The libero player is designated by a jer
sey of a different color than those of the rest
of his teammates. This player is not allowed
to serve, block or attack. Sometimes called a
"defensive specialist," the libero is a back

row player only.
"I just picked it up when I got here,"
Lindberg said. "It's a different position. It's
a lot more focused, I think. I'm not used to
just focusing on passing and digging. It's just
something to get used to. You just learn to
go with it."
Lindberg admitted that he sometimes
feels overshadowed by those who get to
make the big blocks and kills. And making
the change from being an offensive player to

a purely defensive one has not been an easy
adjustment.
'it's kind of hard to figure out my role on
the team," Lindbergsaid. "I'm not a leading
role. I'm not a setter. I'm not a star hitter.
But I'm still a critical part of the team. If I'm
not playing well, the team's not going to be
playing well. It's just hard to learn where
you fit in. but I'm coming along with that."

One year after walking onto the team, sophomore Brian Lindberg has found a niche at the libero position, a position he just picked up last
season. Lindberg admits it has been difficult adjusting to playing pure defense but he says he has found friends and support on the team.
