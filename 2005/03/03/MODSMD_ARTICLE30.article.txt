# Lindberg adjusting to libero
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITER 
Unlike most of his teammates, sopho
more Brian Lindberg didn't come to Stan
ford knowing that he would play volleyball.
Despite being a two-year letter-winner in
high school, Lindberg was not recruited to
the Stanford team. He walked on his fresh
man year — and didn't even spend most of
his time on the bench.
Lindberg appeared in 62 games, splitting
time at the libero position. This year, he is
the starting libero.
"The fact that 1 got to practice with the
team at all was just beyond any of my ex
pectations at that point," Lindberg said. "I
really didn't know what to expect. 1 just
came and played hard day to day — what
ever 1 could contribute to the team."
Does the sophomore starter feel pres
sured to play well?
"Yes," Lindberg said without hesitation.
"It's fine, though. There's pressure, but it's
not like it's a terrible thing. I mean. I enjoy
coming out every night and being part of the
team. There was more pressure last year,
when 1 just came in to serve at the end of
games. 1 thought that was harder. This year,
you're in; you've kind of got a starting posi
tion; you just go with it and you improve day
by day and you don't worry about it so
much."
But after all, the game should come nat
urally to the son of two former volleyball
players.
"Both my parents played," Lindberg

said. "That's actually how they met, so I
kind of owe my life to volleyball."
Lindberg started playing the sport in
high school, when a lot of his friends were
getting into it. However, he never played
libero before coming to Stanford.
The libero player is designated by a jer
sey of a different color than those of the rest
of his teammates. This player is not allowed
to serve, block or attack. Sometimes called a
"defensive specialist," the libero is a back

row player only.
"I just picked it up when I got here,"
Lindberg said. "It's a different position. It's
a lot more focused, I think. I'm not used to
just focusing on passing and digging. It's just
something to get used to. You just learn to
go with it."
Lindberg admitted that he sometimes
feels overshadowed by those who get to
make the big blocks and kills. And making
the change from being an offensive player to

a purely defensive one has not been an easy
adjustment.
'it's kind of hard to figure out my role on
the team," Lindbergsaid. "I'm not a leading
role. I'm not a setter. I'm not a star hitter.
But I'm still a critical part of the team. If I'm
not playing well, the team's not going to be
playing well. It's just hard to learn where
you fit in. but I'm coming along with that."

One year after walking onto the team, sophomore Brian Lindberg has found a niche at the libero position, a position he just picked up last
season. Lindberg admits it has been difficult adjusting to playing pure defense but he says he has found friends and support on the team.
Card hit the road for CSUN

Head coach Don Shaw said the
libero "has to he an unselfish play
er."
Lindberg is doing his best to fit
that role, putting the team first.
"My favorite part is just having a
team, a group of friends that is just
solid," Lindberg said. "It was so nice
coming in last year as a freshman, es
pecially, and having a group of
friends that's already in place for you
there, and they're always going to be
there. That sort of support is defi
nitely awesome."
On the court, Lindberg's play re
flects that sense of camaraderie, as
he plays a position in which will
never score a point. But a libero's
contribution to the team is measured
in digs, not kills. Lindberg has 107
digs so far this season, averaging 1.98
per game. Each dig means a point
saved — if not for good, at least for
the moment — and gives. the rest of
the team a second chance to make a
kill. In that sense, the libero is just as
important as any other player.
The No. 7 Cardinal (7-9, 6-7
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
will be counting on Lindberg's de
fensive talent this weekend. They
are hoping to extend their three
game winning streak when they trav
el to No. 9Cal State-Northridge (8-9,
5-8) on Friday. The two teams have
met twice already this season, with
Stanford losing 3-1 in both matches.
"Northridge gives us a hard
time," Shaw said. "They've been
very tough this year. Plus, that's al
ways a tough match because we'll be
riding a bus down on that day. It's
easier to just take a bus, but it does
make fora little bit of a different
road trip."
Being tin the road is yet another
challenge for Lindberg and the rest
of the team.
"It's difficult when you go away
on road trips and you have a prob
lem set due or something like that,"
Lindberg said. "You wish you could
spend more time focusing on volley
ball, and you wish you could spend
more time studying fora test."
Me added optimistically, "It's def
initely doable, though." That sums
up the Cardinal's attitude as they
head into this road trip. Bolstered by
their recent success and their highest
ranking so far this season, the team is
ready fora challenge.
"I think we can take them," Lind
berg said. "CSUN has never seemed
that good. They've beaten us in the
past, but it's mostly because we've
played poorly. We beat ourselves;
they didn't beat us."

Stanford will leave early tomor
row for the six-hour bus ride to
Northridge and then play that night.
Immediately after the match, the
Cardinal will drive to Santa Barbara,
where they will spend the night and
play No. 5 UC-Santa Barbara (9-7,9-
4) the following evening. The Gau
chos are riding a four-game winning
streak. Stanford has only played
UCSB once this season, falling 3-2.
"We know we can beat Santa
Barbara - we almost did," Lindberg
said. "This last weekend, we were
able to play well as a team, and
|Long Beach State] had this one

player just going off and playing re
ally well, so we can do the same thing
against Santa Barbara. I don't think
they're that strong; they have one
strong player, and besides that... I
think we can expect a couple wins
down there if we play well."
Lindberg's confidence about the
upcoming road trip extends to the
rest of the Cardinal's season.
"There's no question we'll make
the playoffs," he said. "It's just
whether we can get a home game at
the beginning. We'll just try to win
every game and see where we end
up."

feels overshadowed by those who get to
make the big blocks and kills. And making
the change from being an offensive player to

a purely defensive one has not been an easy
adjustment.
'it's kind of hard to figure out my role on
the team," Lindbergsaid. "I'm not a leading
role. I'm not a setter. I'm not a star hitter.
But I'm still a critical part of the team. If I'm
not playing well, the team's not going to be
playing well. It's just hard to learn where
you fit in. but I'm coming along with that."

One year after walking onto the team, sophomore Brian Lindberg has found a niche at the libero position, a position he just picked up last
season. Lindberg admits it has been difficult adjusting to playing pure defense but he says he has found friends and support on the team.
Card hit the road for CSUN

Head coach Don Shaw said the
libero "has to he an unselfish play
er."
Lindberg is doing his best to fit
that role, putting the team first.
"My favorite part is just having a
team, a group of friends that is just
solid," Lindberg said. "It was so nice
coming in last year as a freshman, es
pecially, and having a group of
friends that's already in place for you
there, and they're always going to be
there. That sort of support is defi
nitely awesome."
On the court, Lindberg's play re
flects that sense of camaraderie, as
he plays a position in which will
never score a point. But a libero's
contribution to the team is measured
in digs, not kills. Lindberg has 107
digs so far this season, averaging 1.98
per game. Each dig means a point
saved — if not for good, at least for
the moment — and gives. the rest of
the team a second chance to make a
kill. In that sense, the libero is just as
important as any other player.
The No. 7 Cardinal (7-9, 6-7
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
will be counting on Lindberg's de
fensive talent this weekend. They
are hoping to extend their three
game winning streak when they trav
el to No. 9Cal State-Northridge (8-9,
5-8) on Friday. The two teams have
met twice already this season, with
Stanford losing 3-1 in both matches.
"Northridge gives us a hard
time," Shaw said. "They've been
very tough this year. Plus, that's al
ways a tough match because we'll be
riding a bus down on that day. It's
easier to just take a bus, but it does
make fora little bit of a different
road trip."
Being tin the road is yet another
challenge for Lindberg and the rest
of the team.
"It's difficult when you go away
on road trips and you have a prob
lem set due or something like that,"
Lindberg said. "You wish you could
spend more time focusing on volley
ball, and you wish you could spend
more time studying fora test."
Me added optimistically, "It's def
initely doable, though." That sums
up the Cardinal's attitude as they
head into this road trip. Bolstered by
their recent success and their highest
ranking so far this season, the team is
ready fora challenge.
"I think we can take them," Lind
berg said. "CSUN has never seemed
that good. They've beaten us in the
past, but it's mostly because we've
played poorly. We beat ourselves;
they didn't beat us."

Stanford will leave early tomor
row for the six-hour bus ride to
Northridge and then play that night.
Immediately after the match, the
Cardinal will drive to Santa Barbara,
where they will spend the night and
play No. 5 UC-Santa Barbara (9-7,9-
4) the following evening. The Gau
chos are riding a four-game winning
streak. Stanford has only played
UCSB once this season, falling 3-2.
"We know we can beat Santa
Barbara - we almost did," Lindberg
said. "This last weekend, we were
able to play well as a team, and
|Long Beach State] had this one

player just going off and playing re
ally well, so we can do the same thing
against Santa Barbara. I don't think
they're that strong; they have one
strong player, and besides that... I
think we can expect a couple wins
down there if we play well."
Lindberg's confidence about the
upcoming road trip extends to the
rest of the Cardinal's season.
"There's no question we'll make
the playoffs," he said. "It's just
whether we can get a home game at
the beginning. We'll just try to win
every game and see where we end
up."

Senior setter Kevin Hansen recorded 56 assists last Thursday against UC-San
Diego. Stanford is riding a season-high three-game win-streak into Northridge.
Unlike most of his teammates, sopho
more Brian Lindberg didn't come to Stan
ford knowing that he would play volleyball.
Despite being a two-year letter-winner in
high school, Lindberg was not recruited to
the Stanford team. He walked on his fresh
man year — and didn't even spend most of
his time on the bench.
Lindberg appeared in 62 games, splitting
time at the libero position. This year, he is
the starting libero.
"The fact that 1 got to practice with the
team at all was just beyond any of my ex
pectations at that point," Lindberg said. "I
really didn't know what to expect. 1 just
came and played hard day to day — what
ever 1 could contribute to the team."
Does the sophomore starter feel pres
sured to play well?
"Yes," Lindberg said without hesitation.
"It's fine, though. There's pressure, but it's
not like it's a terrible thing. I mean. I enjoy
coming out every night and being part of the
team. There was more pressure last year,
when 1 just came in to serve at the end of
games. 1 thought that was harder. This year,
you're in; you've kind of got a starting posi
tion; you just go with it and you improve day
by day and you don't worry about it so
much."
But after all, the game should come nat
urally to the son of two former volleyball
players.
"Both my parents played," Lindberg

said. "That's actually how they met, so I
kind of owe my life to volleyball."
Lindberg started playing the sport in
high school, when a lot of his friends were
getting into it. However, he never played
libero before coming to Stanford.
The libero player is designated by a jer
sey of a different color than those of the rest
of his teammates. This player is not allowed
to serve, block or attack. Sometimes called a
"defensive specialist," the libero is a back

row player only.
"I just picked it up when I got here,"
Lindberg said. "It's a different position. It's
a lot more focused, I think. I'm not used to
just focusing on passing and digging. It's just
something to get used to. You just learn to
go with it."
Lindberg admitted that he sometimes
feels overshadowed by those who get to
make the big blocks and kills. And making
the change from being an offensive player to

a purely defensive one has not been an easy
