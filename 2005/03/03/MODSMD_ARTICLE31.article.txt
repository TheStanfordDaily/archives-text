# Last chance for NCAAs spot
## 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the NCAA Championships
draw closer for the men's and
women's track and field teams, the
meet has become the focus for head
coaches Robert Weir and Edrick
Floreal. Those who have already
qualified by earning automatic
marks this season have the week
end to mentally prepare, but eight
Cardinal athletes (four men and
four women) have one more race to
run before the NCAAson March 11
and 12. The eight make up two
teams that will travel to Washing
ton and lowa to compete in Satur
day's last-chance qualifier meets.
The one thing that will be on the

athletes' minds?
"Hitting those NCAA stan
dards," head women's coach Flore
al said.
Weir, the men's head coach,
echoed those same thoughts.
"The athletes are trying to get
the right times," Weir said. "They
have two options: to get an auto
matic mark, in which case they are
guaranteed a spot in nationals, or to
get a provisional mark."
The top 12 or 15 who earn a spot
on the list of provisional marks have
a very good chance of being invited
to nationals, he added.
For the men, senior Evan Fox,
still riding high from his perfor
mance this past weekend in Seattle,
will have the chance to qualify in

the mile race.
"Evan had an exceptional per
formance," Weir said. "He ran the
mile trial on Friday and the DMR
[Distance Medley Relay] and mile
finals on Saturday. Those are all
tough races."
Redshirt freshman Lauren Jes
persen will also have the chance to
qualify in the mile. His perfor
mance in Seattle was, to Weir, an in
dication of his drive and enthusi
asm.
"At the MPSFs Lauren was a bit
overexcited, and he probably over
performed," Weir said. "But I'd
rather that attitude than any other."
Seniors Nick Sebes and Curt
Goehring will compete in the 400-
meter dash. Goehring qualified
provisionally in the 400 this past
weekend and Sebes qualified provi
sionally earlier in the season, so
both will be aiming for automatic
marks. If the Cardinal's provision
ally-ranked DMR makes nationals,
Sebes will compete on the relay as
well.
Weir said he is especially excited
to go into the qualifiers this week
end because he was impressed by
the performance of his team at the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
meet.
"As a team, as a group of ath
letes competing, as a group coming
together fora championship meet,
they raised the level of perfor
mance," Weir said. "It was an over
all phenomenal, competitive expe
rience."
"Going into [the MPSFs] I
thought we were ranked fifth or
sixth, maybe we could finish fourth
with a lucky break, and we finished
second," Weir said.
Weir attributes the second-place
finish to the camaraderie, team
spirit and competitiveness that the
men's team displayed. All that en
ergy produced the results that they
came away with, he said.
"We had a not-so-good team
come together for an exceptional
meet, and who knows if we can do it
again," Weir said. "Despite the ob
vious weakness, the team came only
half a point ahead of Arizona, who
we should have lost to."
Twenty-two of the 26 men that
Weir put together for the meet
scored in the finals, and 19 of them
ran a personal best.
"Some of the men doubled the
number of events they were in to fill
in holes," Weir said. "For what we
had. we certainly made the best of
it.... Everyone who made it to the
finals outperformed themselves.
Every one of them met and exceed
ed the standards they set for them
selves."
Weir said he considers the MPSF
Championships to be the highlight
of the men's indoor season. He said
