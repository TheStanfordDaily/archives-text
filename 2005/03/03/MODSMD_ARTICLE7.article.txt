Banter: "McArthur Court is a great old gym with
a distinct home-court advantage. The Valley
River Inn is in a great location fora hotel. A
walk along the Willamette River is a great stress
reliever. A nearby mall always has great bar
gains and NO SALES TAX." (4 out of 5)
Allen's Analysis: Mekala's Thai restaurant
on Franklin is great. Track Town Pizza, too. One
of the few places you can hop into a cab and be
asked if you're in town for the logging conven

were going to die — 'til you've eaten at Pete's Fish and

sure to ask for the "I'm Addicted to Pete's Fish and

each city. Vazquez said he often asks himself
"Would I want to live here?" upon visiting a
city and rates the Pac-10 locales on a livability
scale (1 basketball = "I dread going back," 5 =
"I'd live there.").
Finally, this reporter provides his impres
sions of each city based on low-budget trips re
plete with two-star hotels, taxi, shuttle and
Greyhound rides and lots of late-night pizza
from Papa John's (the man makes a good
pizza).

In Short: If you want to enjoy
the rainbow, be prepared to en
dure the storm.
Hob's Report: "Ahh Nordies .

Bobby V's Banter: A great
city to visit. Wish we could play
all our Pac-10 games there. Great
food, great city to walk and shop.
Basketball is king right now.
Tough to win there. (5 out of 5)

temperatures are comfortable, and, except during the
summer monsoon, it's a dry heat.

Bobby Vs Banter Thanks, no thanks. Rowdy fans
can be mean to the visitors. The upside... great Mexican
restaurant at the El Charro (try the tamale combo 5). (3)
Allen's Analysis: Wish I had more time to explore
the city and surrounding area. The McKale Center and
the Mexican restaurant in the Tucson airport just don't
do it for me. The annual Tucson Gem Show coincided
with Stanford's visits the past two seasons, driving hotel
rates up and leading me to spend another night in
Tempe.

Student Speak — Lauren Meyer, Junior:
"There is amazing peppermint frozen yogurt at
the Sub Shop on campus. 1 go there at least
once a week while home. Brunch is great at
Studio One Cafe, especially the French toast.
It's fun to go feed the ducks in the duck pond or
to bike along the Willamette River.
The Good: "It's easier to bike than drive, eas
ier to find a recycling bin than a garbage can and
easier to buy a hemp necklace or tie-dyed t-shirt
than designer products. The outdoors is also
wonderfully accessible - makes it easy to be ac
tive and enjoy nature!"
The Bad: "My friend read this and said she'd
never live there. Guess it doesn't suit all."
In Short: "There's a wide variety of people
who live there, so it's a neat, dynamic atmo
sphere."

The Good: The summers.

too hot, but always warm enough
to go jump in a lake.
The Bad: Cloudy, rainy days

and old people like me. (4 out of 5)
Allen's Analysis: The first thing that comes to mind
is the traffic. Smog is a close second. It's hard to com
plain about the beaches and nightlife, though. Late

Banter: "McArthur Court is a great old gym with
a distinct home-court advantage. The Valley
River Inn is in a great location fora hotel. A
walk along the Willamette River is a great stress
reliever. A nearby mall always has great bar
gains and NO SALES TAX." (4 out of 5)
Allen's Analysis: Mekala's Thai restaurant
on Franklin is great. Track Town Pizza, too. One
of the few places you can hop into a cab and be
asked if you're in town for the logging conven
tion. The Eugene Greyhound station was, well,
interesting.

Allen's Analysis: Papa John's delivers late here,
which is key. You haven't lived — and then felt like you
were going to die — 'til you've eaten at Pete's Fish and
Chips, family owned and operated since 1947. Make
sure to ask for the "I'm Addicted to Pete's Fish and
Chips" bumper sticker.

each city. Vazquez said he often asks himself
"Would I want to live here?" upon visiting a
city and rates the Pac-10 locales on a livability
scale (1 basketball = "I dread going back," 5 =
"I'd live there.").
Finally, this reporter provides his impres
sions of each city based on low-budget trips re
plete with two-star hotels, taxi, shuttle and
Greyhound rides and lots of late-night pizza
from Papa John's (the man makes a good
pizza).

the rainbow, be prepared to en

Hob's Report: "Ahh Nordies .
.. does the sun ever freakin' shine
here?"
Bobby V's Banter: A great
city to visit. Wish we could play
all our Pac-10 games there. Great
food, great city to walk and shop.
Basketball is king right now.
Tough to win there. (5 out of 5)
Allen's Analysis: I'm going to
side with Bobby V on this one. I
dig Seattle.

temperatures are comfortable, and, except during the
summer monsoon, it's a dry heat.
Rob's Report: "The town that worships Lute Olson
no matter what....ick...what can I say? It has never really
grown on me."
Bobby Vs Banter Thanks, no thanks. Rowdy fans
can be mean to the visitors. The upside... great Mexican
restaurant at the El Charro (try the tamale combo 5). (3)
Allen's Analysis: Wish I had more time to explore
the city and surrounding area. The McKale Center and
the Mexican restaurant in the Tucson airport just don't
do it for me. The annual Tucson Gem Show coincided
with Stanford's visits the past two seasons, driving hotel
rates up and leading me to spend another night in
Tempe.
