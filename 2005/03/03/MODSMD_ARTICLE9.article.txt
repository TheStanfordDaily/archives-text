# Special-fee petitions circulate campus
## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
Chances are that you've been asked to sign a pe
tition this week so that groups can be placed on the
special-fees ballot, and it is likely that you signed the
petition not fully understanding what special fees
are and how the system works.
"The special-fees system is a method [through
which] students directly funding student groups,"
said ASSU Undergraduate Senate Chair Chris Lin,
a senior. "It's money that's voted upon directly by
the students that goes directly to a student group ac
count."

Article 5 Section 2 of the ASSU Constitution ex
pands upon Lin's definition, stating that "special
fees shall be sought by student organizations to
cover their organizational and basic programming
expenses."
Special fees are collected each quarter from stu
dents through an ASSU fee that is part of their Uni
versity bills. This year, the charge was $256 for each
112 undergraduate student and around $84 for each
graduate student. However, the entirety of this
charge is not used for special fees — 21.5 percent of
it is allocated to the general-fees fund. The general
fees fund is the pool of money that the ASSU de
termines how to spend.

"General fees goes to the Senate to be alkKated
to student groups," Lin said. "The total pot of
money is fairly large. It's about $300,(X)0... The
bulk of it goes to fund student groups."
The general fees that do not go to groups go to
ward various administrative costs and refund sur
charge.
Students will vote on which organizations will re
ceive special fees during the spring quarter general
elections.
Three types of groups are able to apply for spe
cial fees: graduate student groups, which serve the
graduate student population; under
graduate student groups, which serve
the undergraduate student popula
tion; and joint groups, which serve
both communities.
According to the ASSU / GSC
Elections 2(X)5 Web site, there are
three different ways that a student
group can be placed on the ballot.
The first method can be used by
any group wishing to be placed on the
ballot. Along with a special-fees re
quest form, the group must submit a
petition signed by 15 percent of the
members of the relevant population
— 990 for undergraduate groups,
1,208 for graduate groups and 2.19K
for joint groups. Groups that submit
such a petition do nut need to be ap
proved by either of the legislative
bodies in order to appear on the bal
lot.
The petitions must include a gen
eral information page, the group's
proposed budget for next year, a copy
of the group's current budget and the
pages with the supporters' signatures.
The collection of the signatures must
remain in accordance with Stanford
regulations which prohibit petition
circulation in lecture halls, class
rooms, laboratories, libraries and
public computer areas.
The second way is typically used by
new student groups or groups that had

been placed on the ballot but did not
get enough votes to receive funding.
These groups must submit a petition
signed by 1(1 percent of the relevant
population and receive an approval
vote of the associated legislative body
— the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
for undergraduate groups; the Gradu
ate Student Council, or CISC, for
graduate groups; and both bodies for
joint groups.
The last way to appear on the bal
lot applies only to groups that have
been included in the past and were ap
proved by at least 50 percent of voters.
These student organizations do not
have to complete petitions but still
need the approval vote of the Senate,
the (iSC, or both for joint groups.
Student groups that are denied
placement on the ballot by the legisla
tive bodies must petition by collecting
signatures from 15 percent of the
members of the relevant population.
These petitions are due from groups
today at 7 p.m.
The Senate and the GSC take into
consideration many items when de
ciding if a group should be placed on
the ballot.
Lin said the Senate looks at four
main aspects of a student organization
when voting to place it on the ballot:
how successful the group has been, fi
nancially or otherwise, in the opinion
of the legislators voting; the practical
ity of the proposed budget; how much
the group really needs the money; and
how well it has established itself at
Stanford.
Appendix II Section 2.8. of the

GSC by-laws lays oul what criteria the
funding committee considers when
evaluating special-fees applications.
According to the by-laws, the GSC
also considers how successful a stu
dent group has been and how realistic
the proposed budget is. If the funding
committee is satisfied with a student
group, it will recommend that the
group be approved for the ballot by
the GSC as a whole.
In addition, the funding committee
judges if the group will make a unique
contribution to the community and
how much the current and future
graduate student population will ben
efit from the group and its programs.
These factors will also influence
whether or not the committee recom
mends the group to be voted on by all
the GSC members.
Students have the constitutional
right to request a refund of their spe
cial fees. However, according to Lin. if
the refund rate of a student group —
the percentage of members in that
group that request a refund — ex
ceeds the buffer amount that the
ASSU collects each year, that group
will lose a percentage of their special
fees allocation.
The percentage the group loses is
equivalent to the difference between
the refund rate and the buffer per
centage. With a buffer of 16 percent, if
20 percent of a group's members re
quest refunds, then the group will lose
4 percent of its special fees.
"So now student groups are more
aware that refunds affect them be
cause they do," Lin said.

public computer areas.
The second way is typically used by
new student groups or groups that had

been placed on the ballot but did not
get enough votes to receive funding.
These groups must submit a petition
signed by 1(1 percent of the relevant
population and receive an approval
vote of the associated legislative body
— the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
for undergraduate groups; the Gradu
ate Student Council, or CISC, for
graduate groups; and both bodies for
joint groups.
The last way to appear on the bal
lot applies only to groups that have
been included in the past and were ap
proved by at least 50 percent of voters.
These student organizations do not
have to complete petitions but still
need the approval vote of the Senate,
the (iSC, or both for joint groups.
Student groups that are denied
placement on the ballot by the legisla
tive bodies must petition by collecting
signatures from 15 percent of the
members of the relevant population.
These petitions are due from groups
today at 7 p.m.
The Senate and the GSC take into
consideration many items when de
ciding if a group should be placed on
the ballot.
Lin said the Senate looks at four
main aspects of a student organization
when voting to place it on the ballot:
how successful the group has been, fi
nancially or otherwise, in the opinion
of the legislators voting; the practical
ity of the proposed budget; how much
the group really needs the money; and
how well it has established itself at
Stanford.
Appendix II Section 2.8. of the

GSC by-laws lays oul what criteria the
funding committee considers when
evaluating special-fees applications.
According to the by-laws, the GSC
also considers how successful a stu
dent group has been and how realistic
the proposed budget is. If the funding
committee is satisfied with a student
group, it will recommend that the
group be approved for the ballot by
the GSC as a whole.
In addition, the funding committee
judges if the group will make a unique
contribution to the community and
how much the current and future
graduate student population will ben
efit from the group and its programs.
These factors will also influence
whether or not the committee recom
mends the group to be voted on by all
the GSC members.
Students have the constitutional
right to request a refund of their spe
cial fees. However, according to Lin. if
the refund rate of a student group —
the percentage of members in that
group that request a refund — ex
ceeds the buffer amount that the
ASSU collects each year, that group
will lose a percentage of their special
fees allocation.
The percentage the group loses is
equivalent to the difference between
the refund rate and the buffer per
centage. With a buffer of 16 percent, if
20 percent of a group's members re
quest refunds, then the group will lose
4 percent of its special fees.
"So now student groups are more
aware that refunds affect them be
cause they do," Lin said.
Chances are that you've been asked to sign a pe
tition this week so that groups can be placed on the
special-fees ballot, and it is likely that you signed the
petition not fully understanding what special fees
are and how the system works.
"The special-fees system is a method [through
which] students directly funding student groups,"
said ASSU Undergraduate Senate Chair Chris Lin,
a senior. "It's money that's voted upon directly by
the students that goes directly to a student group ac
count."

Article 5 Section 2 of the ASSU Constitution ex
pands upon Lin's definition, stating that "special
fees shall be sought by student organizations to
cover their organizational and basic programming
expenses."
Special fees are collected each quarter from stu
dents through an ASSU fee that is part of their Uni
versity bills. This year, the charge was $256 for each
112 undergraduate student and around $84 for each
graduate student. However, the entirety of this
charge is not used for special fees — 21.5 percent of
it is allocated to the general-fees fund. The general
fees fund is the pool of money that the ASSU de
termines how to spend.

"General fees goes to the Senate to be alkKated
to student groups," Lin said. "The total pot of
money is fairly large. It's about $300,(X)0... The
bulk of it goes to fund student groups."
The general fees that do not go to groups go to
ward various administrative costs and refund sur
charge.
Students will vote on which organizations will re
ceive special fees during the spring quarter general
elections.
Three types of groups are able to apply for spe
cial fees: graduate student groups, which serve the
graduate student population; under
graduate student groups, which serve
the undergraduate student popula
tion; and joint groups, which serve
both communities.
According to the ASSU / GSC
Elections 2(X)5 Web site, there are
three different ways that a student
group can be placed on the ballot.
The first method can be used by
any group wishing to be placed on the
ballot. Along with a special-fees re
quest form, the group must submit a
petition signed by 15 percent of the
members of the relevant population
— 990 for undergraduate groups,
1,208 for graduate groups and 2.19K
for joint groups. Groups that submit
such a petition do nut need to be ap
proved by either of the legislative
bodies in order to appear on the bal
lot.
The petitions must include a gen
eral information page, the group's
proposed budget for next year, a copy
of the group's current budget and the
pages with the supporters' signatures.
The collection of the signatures must
remain in accordance with Stanford
regulations which prohibit petition
circulation in lecture halls, class
rooms, laboratories, libraries and
public computer areas.
