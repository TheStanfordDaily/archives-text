Correction
In yesterday's story "Special-fee petitions circulate campus," the re
fund rate of a student group was defined incorrectly. The article staled
that the refund rate is the percentage of members in a group that re
quest a refund, when in fact it is the percentage of students that request
a refund from that group.
