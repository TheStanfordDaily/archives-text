# A 						FITNESS BUFF'S UTOPIA

"Arrillaga is a real nice gym, but
the hours aren't that great," junior
Sean Kandel said. "And if you have
to go to Tresidder, it's small,
packed in and everyone is sweat
ing."
For Kandel and many other stu
dents, faculty and staff, the answer
to their recreational woes will come
this August with the completion of
the Arrillaga Family Recreation
Center.
The new facility will replace the
Arrillaga Family Sports Center as
the destination for the fitness and
recreational needs of non-athletes.
It will be located at the site of the
old Encina gym, across from the
Arrillaga Alumni Center and
Maples Pavilion.
The idea for the recreation cen
ter began taking shape in 1998
when a study by the vice provost for
student affairs found that students
gave low ratings to the condition
and availability of recreational fa
cilities on evaluations. Students
also wanted more space for intra
mural sports and events.
Hoover Associates, a construc
tion and design company that the
Athletics Department has worked
closely with on numerous other
projects, began designing the recre
ation center in 2001.
The goal in building the new fa
cility is to meet and exceed the con
cerns raised in the 1998 study.
On the ground level, there are

three full-sized basketball courts,
a climbing wall for up to 21 peo
ple, six squash courts, two rac
quetball courts and a 3,500-
square-foot fitness room for exer
cise classes.
On the lower level is a combined
weight training and cardio room
that is about 50 percent larger than
the space at the Arrillaga Family
Sports Center. There is space for
fencing, an academic resource cen
ter and 8,000 square feet of space
for sports medicine.
The entire recreation center,
with the exception of the fencing
room, will be completely open to
students, staff and faculty. As a re
sult, the Arrillaga Family Sports
Center will be restricted to varsity
athlete use, according to Ray Pur
por, the associate athletic director
who oversees the athletic facili
ties' maintenance and new con
struction.
The funding for the construction
costs have all come from the Arril
laga family and the remaining costs
for permits, furnishings and county
fees have been provided by other
donors, the Athletic Department
and University reserves, Purpor
said.
Designed in the spirit of the old
Encina gym, the new recreation
center will even use some of Enci
na's salvaged remnants, such as the
roof tiles, parts of the old floor and
old bricks for landscaping. Mam
moth-arched glass windows that
line the exterior of the building will
infuse the basketball courts, squash

courts and fitness spaces with nat
ural light.
"Encina Gym was a beautiful
building and, in some ways, it will
live on," said project manager
Mark Bonino.
Many students believe the new
facility will become a convenient

center for the all the fitness needs of
students.
"A lot of equipment is spread
out across campus," freshman vol
leyball player Bryn Kehoe said.

In the Arrillaga Family Recreation Center, scheduled to open in August,
students will have access to a 3,500 square-foot fitness room.
Bigger, better-equipped gym to finish in August

"A lot of equipment is spread out across
campus," freshman volleyball player Bryn
Kehoe said. "T residder has cardio and Arrilla
ga is nice, but out of the way."
Kandel agreed and said he felt the new fa
cility would help resolve the problem.
"It's nice that you can do cardio, strength
and conditioning all under one roof," he said.
Kandel also noted that the current offer
ings for basketball playing space are bleak.
"Ford — two courts, pretty nice — that's
one option," he said. "Or you go to Maples
and you have one full-size court and'three
rinky-dink courts with no normally painted
lines and no clear three-point line. 1 just heard
Roble is so bad I haven't even stepped foot in
the place."
During field hockey practice at the Ford
Center, freshman Madi Bell saw just how
much of an unmet demand there is for basket
ball space.
"There are always people poking their
heads in during our field hockey class and say
ing, 'You guys almost done?"' she said. "There
are always people when we get there and peo
ple there when we leave. People are so eager
to use the courts, they'll help as clean up after
practice."
The three new basketball courts should
solve this problem. The new courts can also be
used for volleyball and other intramural
sports, as well as for dance and social events.

according to Bonino.
In addition to increased space and extend
ed hours of operation, the new facility will
have the latest in fitness technology.
"There is a large equipment trade show in
San Francisco [in) mid-March and we plan on
attending that show to see if there is something
new in the marketplace that we would want to
have," said assistant athletic director Sherry
Posthumus.
While there is little variety in the cardio ma
chines offerings at the current Arrillaga gym,
the recreation center will have treadmills, el
lipticals, upright and recumbent bikes, step
mills and spinning bikes, Posthumus said.
She added, "There will definitely be an all
around weight room with plenty of cardio
equipment, a circuit training area and a large
stretch area with medicine balls, rollers and
jump ropes."
Bonino pointed out the vastly improved
rock climbing space.
"Rock climbers will get some dedicated
space for their sport rather than an adapted
racquetball court,"he said. "They should have
some more challenging, improved climbing
areas with greater height and a glass wall for
people to watch."
The new recreation center will also offer
non-credit fitness classes in weight training,
spinning. Allegro, yoga, hip-hop dance and
cardio kick boxing. The center offers a weight

room as well.
" Hiere is no doubt that we want to provide
the cardio venue that is so badly needed on this
campus," Posthumus said. "But we also want
to provide one of the best equipped, top-of
the-line weight rooms in the country. We are
very carefully selecting pieces of equipment,
free weights and dumbbells for those who want
to emphasize strength and conditioning."
Students seem excited about the new op
portunities offered by the new recreation cen
ter.
"The new facility will get students to come
out because they want to see it, they want to
use it," Bell said. "They're more likely to work
out when they won't have to choose between
weights and a treadmill. They can have it all in
one location."
Bell also felt that increased separation be
tween athlete and non-athlete gym space
would be a positive development.
"People will feel comfortable going there,"
she said. "They won't be surrounded by varsi
ty coaches, varsity trainers or varsity athletes
who people think are watching them."
Kandel, the junior, made one complaint:
that the center should have built earlier. Had
the facility opened his freshman year, he said,
his body "would have evolved into a new
species of mankind by now."
It looks like he'll need to make the most of
his last year.
