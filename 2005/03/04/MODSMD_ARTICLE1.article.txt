"Arrillaga is a real nice gym, but
the hours aren't that great," junior
Sean Kandel said. "And if you have
to go to Tresidder, it's small,
packed in and everyone is sweat
ing."
For Kandel and many other stu
dents, faculty and staff, the answer
to their recreational woes will come
this August with the completion of
the Arrillaga Family Recreation
Center.
The new facility will replace the
Arrillaga Family Sports Center as
the destination for the fitness and
recreational needs of non-athletes.
It will be located at the site of the
old Encina gym, across from the
Arrillaga Alumni Center and
Maples Pavilion.
The idea for the recreation cen
ter began taking shape in 1998
when a study by the vice provost for
student affairs found that students
gave low ratings to the condition
and availability of recreational fa
cilities on evaluations. Students
also wanted more space for intra
mural sports and events.
Hoover Associates, a construc
tion and design company that the
Athletics Department has worked
closely with on numerous other
projects, began designing the recre
ation center in 2001.
The goal in building the new fa
cility is to meet and exceed the con
cerns raised in the 1998 study.
On the ground level, there are

three full-sized basketball courts,
a climbing wall for up to 21 peo
ple, six squash courts, two rac
quetball courts and a 3,500-
square-foot fitness room for exer
cise classes.
On the lower level is a combined
weight training and cardio room
that is about 50 percent larger than
the space at the Arrillaga Family
Sports Center. There is space for
fencing, an academic resource cen
ter and 8,000 square feet of space
for sports medicine.
The entire recreation center,
with the exception of the fencing
room, will be completely open to
students, staff and faculty. As a re
sult, the Arrillaga Family Sports
Center will be restricted to varsity
athlete use, according to Ray Pur
por, the associate athletic director
who oversees the athletic facili
ties' maintenance and new con
struction.
The funding for the construction
costs have all come from the Arril
laga family and the remaining costs
for permits, furnishings and county
fees have been provided by other
donors, the Athletic Department
and University reserves, Purpor
said.
Designed in the spirit of the old
Encina gym, the new recreation
center will even use some of Enci
na's salvaged remnants, such as the
roof tiles, parts of the old floor and
old bricks for landscaping. Mam
moth-arched glass windows that
line the exterior of the building will
infuse the basketball courts, squash

courts and fitness spaces with nat
ural light.
"Encina Gym was a beautiful
building and, in some ways, it will
live on," said project manager
Mark Bonino.
Many students believe the new
facility will become a convenient

center for the all the fitness needs of
students.
"A lot of equipment is spread
out across campus," freshman vol
leyball player Bryn Kehoe said.
