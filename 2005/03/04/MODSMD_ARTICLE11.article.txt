" 'Law and Apartheid' will be the
subject of Dean Denis Victor
Cowan's lecture tonight at 7:30 p.m.
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Cowan
is dean of the law school at the Uni
versity of Capetown, South Africa.
" 'Apartheid' is Afrikaans for the
policy of total racial segregation
now being supported by the South
African government. At present,
parts of the cities there are being
torn down and rebuilt in order to re
district them into racial compart
ments, isolated by empty buffer
zones.
"Not only do the laws of South
Africa keep the Negro completely
segregated and powerless; they do
not provide protection from crime in
the Negro districts of the cities. As a
result, the Negro population is op
pressed by both police and criminal
elements.
"As counsel before the Supreme
Court of South Africa, Cowan chal
lenged the constitutionality of laws
depriving colored citizens of the
vote."
On March, 4, 1965, The Daily

Morse (R-Ore.) attacking American
policy in Vietnam for having no es
tablished objectives. Below is an ex
cerpt:
"Senator Wayne Morse lambast
ed American foreign policy in
Southeast Asia yesterday, charging
the Eisenhower administration with
'secret' diplomacy and Lyndon
Johnson with no objective at all in
Vietnam.
"'1 think the administration has
told us about all it can about our poli
cy in Southeast Asia, because there is
no particular objective to it,' he said.
"Morse criticized recent air at
tacks against North Vietnamese mil
itary installations and said the 'so
called white paper that sought to jus
tify these attacks after the fact was
shot full of holes by the testimony of
administration officials.'
"As a substitute for present U.S.
policy of military aid, Morse sug
gested the U.S. work towards 'eco
nomic freedom' in Southeast Asia.
He said only economic indepen
dence from foreign control will lead
Asians from communism.
" 'You cannot export political
freedom,' he said. We've been try
ing it for 20 years in foreign policy
and it's been a flop.' "
