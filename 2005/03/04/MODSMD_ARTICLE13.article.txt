# But that's not the point...
## Leprechauns, Zeus and Jesus at the courthouse 
### 
In a case that recently went to
the Supreme Court, Thomas
van Orden objected to the dis
play of the Ten Commandments in
a Texas courthouse. According to
the defendant, Texas Gov. Rick
Perry, the Ten Commandments
were displayed not to profess
Christianity but to commemorate
the Judeo-Christian values that
have "had a significant impact on
the history, culture and laws of
Texas and the rest of the country."
I do not understand why anyone
would have a problem with this. If
anything, 1 think that those crazy
Texans didn't go far enough. Why
stop there? The Ten Command
ments may have had a significant
impact on the history and laws of

America, but so
have numerous
other factors,
like Greek phi
losophy.
If the Ten
Commandments
can be displayed
on government
property, then so
can the emblems
of any other reli-

gions or ethnicities since America
has been built on the efforts of many
people — Christians, Asians, Jews,
even Mongolians, who form a sur
prisingly small, yet influential mi
nority of the population.
So if we're going to commemo
rate the Judeo-Christian influence
on America, we should really dig
deep and try to respect all cultures
that have influenced the history and
development of our great nation.
Democracy — we got that from
the Greeks. That deserves at4east
one statue of Zeus and maybe one
of Apollo for good measure.
The tech boom might not have
occurred without the Asian and In
dian engineers who dominate the
industry. That should merit at least
one Buddha and Shiva statue
apiece.
According to the movie "Far
and Away," starring Tom Cruise
and Nicole Kidman as Irish immi
grants fleeing to America, the Irish
pioneered the settling of the West
in the big land race, and so influ
enced our westward expansion.
But since we've already covered
Catholicism, we'll need something
distinctively Irish, like lep
rechauns. Or alcohol.
1 dream of a time where every
government building that display
its Ten Commandments will
proudly showcase alongside it the
statues of Krishna, Buddha, and
Confucius; leprechauns; a Koran
on the shelves; and perhaps a
Torah (preferably in its scroll
form) thrown in for good measure,
but only if space permits.
This may of course pose an issue
of practicality, since there is only a
limited amount of space. Decora
tors would then have to decide
which to keep — Aristotle or a lep
rechaun?
What we need is'consistency in
the system: either we recognize all
religions or none. I don't care ei
ther way since according to my reli
gion, I'll probably be reborn as a
blood-sucking monkey, and the
laws of man will have no applica
tion to me.
In all seriousness, though, we
must recognize that America's
founding and history has been
shaped by all sorts of people, and
all religious faiths have a place in
this country, not to mention that I
would wholeheartedly support a
petition to display leprechauns in
Congress.
America, after all, is a melting
pot, or perhaps a tossed salad, for
those who do not like the "melting
pot" metaphor. Melting pots re
quire us to conform into one ho
mogenous mixture. In a tossed
salad, we retain our individual
identities, like a tomato or lettuce,
while still blending into a cohesive
whole.
So let's celebrate that mixture.
Let's be proud of our tomatoes and
croutons. And let's display them on
government property. Because if
the Ten Commandments have the
