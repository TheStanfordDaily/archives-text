## Eight to showcase talents for 'Idol' title 
### EMMA VAUGHN STAFF WRITER 
Over the last few weeks, more than 500 votes have been cast.
We're not talking about student government elections — that isn't
until April. We're talking about the "Stanford Idol" competition. The
pool of contestants has narrowed from 80 to eight. But the competition
will only get hotter over the next few days.
"It has far exceeded my expectations," said Absolute Fun Chair
Joey Natoli, a senior who is also a member of The Daily's editorial
board. "Not only was it well planned out, but the support has been
tremendous. To many people, 'Stanford Idol' has really become a phe
nomenon, and that is great." The talent competition is run by Absolute
Fun, a division of the ASSU.
The eight finalists will perform in Kresge Auditorium Monday,
which is also the same night as the semi-finals of Fox's TV show
"American Idol," on which Stanford's version was based.
Following their performances, all audience members will be able to
place their votes online until midnight, when the polls will close. The
winner will be announced at the main Midnight Breakfast in Tresid
der. The airing of the final show on Stanford Cardinal Broadcasting
Network, or SCBN, will not be until the following weekend, after the
winner has been declared.
"I expect a lot of support this round," said the producer and
founder of "Stanford Idol" Elizabeth Heng, a sophomore. "There has
been a lot of enthusiasm and everyone seems to be really excited about
it. In addition, the eight finalists are absolutely fabulous."
Heng developed the idea for the contest during fall quarter, has
produced the show through Absolute Fun and has worked with the
Senate associates, Delta Tau Delta and SCBN to secure locations,
props and air time. The process has followed the basic structure of
Fox's "American Idol" with some adjustments for the limited funding
and materials.

"The overall idea is pretty sim
ilar, but there are certain things we
couldn't do," said finalist Elena
Wright, a junior. "For example, on
the real show, all the finalists have
to live together in this really nice
house, and so it becomes more
about them personally than just
their voices. There are also a lot
more rounds."
However, despite the few nec
essary budget-related sacrifices,
event organizers and participants
say they have received positive
feedback from all areas of campus.
"1 have gotten such incredible
support and encouragement,"

"It's not just about
singing—you have to
create a personality
on stage that everyone
can respect and be
seduced by."
i
— Edlskandar, 'Stanford Idol'judge

Heng said. "I've been getting e-mails from random individuals telling
me how good it's been and from people volunteering to write fund let
ters. So many people want to be part of this lately that I've felt like 1
haven't had to do anything."
Much of this campus enthusiasm seems to stem from the talent
pool. "Stanford Idol" judge Ed Iskandar, a co-terminal student in
drama, said he believes that the show reveals a vibrant underground
community of skilled singers and musicians that lacked previous ex
posure.
"That was really what amazed me at the first audition," Iskandar
said. "There was this entirely large group of people who are not just
doing it for the hell of it, but who can really sing and sing well."
Iskandar, along with senior Chris Babson and junior Chioke
Borgelt-Mose, represent Randy, Simon and Paula, respectively — the
notorious judges of the show on Fox. For the most part, contestants
agree that these three have not been as brutal as the judges on "Amer
ican Idol," but there have been a few occasional over-the-top remarks,
according to contestants.
"By the second week, I think people complained that they weren't
being mean enough," said finalist Ben Roseborough, a junior. "So dur
ing my round they really ripped into a couple girls. It was constructive,
but also kind of mean and slightly unnecessary."
For the final round, each contestant will be required to sing two
songs, one of which is assigned to them and one of which is a song of
their choice. The judges have given each contestant a song that they
feel will simultaneously challenge and highlight their vocal and per
formance ability.
"There's an 'X factor,' and that's what we want to see," Iskandar
said. "It's not just about singing — you have to create a personality on
stage that everyone can respect and be seduced by."

The eight finalists will perform in Kresge Auditorium Monday,
which is also the same night as the semi-finals of Fox's TV show
"American Idol," on which Stanford's version was based.
Following their performances, all audience members will be able to
place their votes online until midnight, when the polls will close. The
winner will be announced at the main Midnight Breakfast in Tresid
der. The airing of the final show on Stanford Cardinal Broadcasting
Network, or SCBN, will not be until the following weekend, after the
winner has been declared.
"I expect a lot of support this round," said the producer and
founder of "Stanford Idol" Elizabeth Heng, a sophomore. "There has
been a lot of enthusiasm and everyone seems to be really excited about
it. In addition, the eight finalists are absolutely fabulous."
Heng developed the idea for the contest during fall quarter, has
produced the show through Absolute Fun and has worked with the
Senate associates, Delta Tau Delta and SCBN to secure locations,
props and air time. The process has followed the basic structure of
Fox's "American Idol" with some adjustments for the limited funding
and materials.

"The overall idea is pretty sim
ilar, but there are certain things we
couldn't do," said finalist Elena
Wright, a junior. "For example, on
the real show, all the finalists have
to live together in this really nice
house, and so it becomes more
about them personally than just
their voices. There are also a lot
more rounds."
However, despite the few nec
essary budget-related sacrifices,
event organizers and participants
say they have received positive
feedback from all areas of campus.
"1 have gotten such incredible
support and encouragement,"

"It's not just about
singing—you have to
create a personality
on stage that everyone
can respect and be
seduced by."

Heng said. "I've been getting e-mails from random individuals telling
me how good it's been and from people volunteering to write fund let
ters. So many people want to be part of this lately that I've felt like 1
haven't had to do anything."
Much of this campus enthusiasm seems to stem from the talent
pool. "Stanford Idol" judge Ed Iskandar, a co-terminal student in
drama, said he believes that the show reveals a vibrant underground
community of skilled singers and musicians that lacked previous ex
posure.
"That was really what amazed me at the first audition," Iskandar
said. "There was this entirely large group of people who are not just
doing it for the hell of it, but who can really sing and sing well."
Iskandar, along with senior Chris Babson and junior Chioke
Borgelt-Mose, represent Randy, Simon and Paula, respectively — the
notorious judges of the show on Fox. For the most part, contestants
agree that these three have not been as brutal as the judges on "Amer
ican Idol," but there have been a few occasional over-the-top remarks,
according to contestants.
"By the second week, I think people complained that they weren't
being mean enough," said finalist Ben Roseborough, a junior. "So dur
ing my round they really ripped into a couple girls. It was constructive,
but also kind of mean and slightly unnecessary."
For the final round, each contestant will be required to sing two
songs, one of which is assigned to them and one of which is a song of
their choice. The judges have given each contestant a song that they
feel will simultaneously challenge and highlight their vocal and per
formance ability.
"There's an 'X factor,' and that's what we want to see," Iskandar
said. "It's not just about singing — you have to create a personality on
stage that everyone can respect and be seduced by."
