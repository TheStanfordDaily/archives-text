## 
### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an effort to discuss the vio
lence in the Darfur region of
Sudan in light of U.S.-African re
lations, a panel of academics and
experts entitled "U.S.-U.N.-
Africa: Darfur and Beyond," con
vened Wednesday night.
The speakers at the event ad
dressed the alleged genocide in
Sudan and the HIV /AIDS pan
demic plaguing most African na
tions.
Organized as the first town
hall meeting presented by the
newly-formed Stanford chapter of
Americans for Informed Democ
racy, or AID, in conjunction with
the Roosevelt Institution's Center
on International Development,
the panel featured Political Sci
ence Profs. David Abernethy and
Jeremy Weinstein.
Panelist David Devlin-Foltz,
director of the Global Interdepen
dence Initiative and a Peace
Corps volunteer in Rwanda,
began the presentation by encour
aging the audience to become
more engaged in international af
fairs. He said that a key part of re
solving the situation in Darfur will
be to educate Americans about
what is happening. The Global In
terdependence Initiative is an or
ganization that seeks to close the
gap between the American pub
lic's values and decisions made by
policymakers.
"Most American attitudes on
Africa are not deeply fixed in any
African reality," Devlin-Foltz
said. "When they are lacking in
formation, people will fall back on
general principles."
He said he blames television
news for the widely-held Ameri
can view that the world is full of
unrelated catastrophic events and
that the United States is the only
nation that can make a difference.
Panelist Heather Hamilton,
vice president of Citizens for
Global Solutions, followed De
vlin-Foltz's call for education with
a call to action, comparing the cri
sis in Darfur to last year's
tsunamis in Southeast Asia. Citi
zens for Global Solutions is a
grassroots organization that en
courages public officials to pro
mote multilateral foreign policy.
"They were a massive natural
event that took hundreds of thou
sands of lives and provoked the
largest outpouring of shock and
compassion," Hamilton said.

"What we're facing now in Darfur
is a man-made catastrophe in
which a government is sponsoring
a genocide. Over 220,0(X) have
died and 10,000 a month are
dying. But where is that surge of
horror?"
She suggested that people re
sponded more immediately to the
tsunamis due to the relative ease
of making a monetary donation,
but urged that there are plenty of
actions individuals can take to
ameliorate the suffering in the
Sudan as well.
Hamilton advised audience
members to be proactive in con
tacting government representa
tives to make their voices heard
on the issue.
She advocated the enforce
ment of the no-fly zone over Dar
fur to keep the Sudanese govern
ment from bombing civilian vil
lages and promoted a U.S. arms
embargo on Sudan's government.
She also urged students to support
the expansion of the African
Union troops in Sudan, who now
have no power to protect civilians
but only to report violations of the
cease-fire agreement.
Following Hamilton's re
marks, Abernethy questioned the
ethical reasoning and effective
ness of American intervention
and aid operations.
"The ease with which outsiders
can come in [to work for aid pro
grams] means that Africans can
quickly become dependent on
outsiders rather than looking to
themselves to solve problems,"
Abernethy said, adding that for
eign aid programs should be de
signed by the potential recipients
and not by the donors themselves.
He also offered what he noted
to be a controversial perspective
on the HIV' / AIDS epidemic
throughout the African continent.
"Outsiders may want to recon
sider the rationale for funding
HIV/AIDS treatment pro
grams," Abernethy said, explain
ing that the intent of treatment is
to prolong patients' lives despite
negative consequences.
"The longer an infected person
lives the more people he or she is
likely to infect through sexual
contact," he said. "I don't know
the answer to this horrible dilem
ma, but 1 have been struck by the
unwillingness of treatment advo
cates to acknowledge that an ef
fective anti-retroviral program
can have the effect of extending
and prolonging the terrible AIDS
pandemic."
Several students who attended
the event said they were struck by
Abernethy's comments on the sub
ject.
"I was shocked by Abernethy's
statement about AIDS," said sopho
more Jonny Carson. "He really had
a lot of balls to say that."
In contrast to the other panelists,
Weinstein spoke on the progress
made toward improving quality of

life in Africa, including govern
ments' punishment of corruption
and the spread of a more proactive
stance on the AIDS pandemic.
However, he also underscored the
need fora reconstruction of the inter
national community in order to fully
address human rights abuses perpe
trated by African governments.
"Sovereignty should be condi
tional," Weinstein said. "We need to
disband the United Nations and
rewrite the U.N. charter to have a
fundamentally different United Na
tions, in which a state's sovereignty is
conditional on internal treatment of
its citizens."
While some students said they
were shocked by this analysis, others

agreed.
"Rethinking sovereignty in a way
that puts the sanctification of human
life above the protection of political
jurisdiction could be a huge step for
global human rights," said sopho
more Chrissie Coxon. director of the
Roosevelt Institution's Center on
Development.
Freshman Kara Johnson said she
thought the panel presented a bal
ance of views.
"We always get a lot of the ac
tivist perspective, the idealist side,"
she said. "It was good to hear the
Abernethy perspective about the re
alistic and logical consequences and
Prof. Weinstein managed to inte
grate both."

event that took hundreds of thou
sands of lives and provoked the
largest outpouring of shock and
compassion," Hamilton said.

"What we're facing now in Darfur
is a man-made catastrophe in
which a government is sponsoring
a genocide. Over 220,0(X) have
died and 10,000 a month are
dying. But where is that surge of
horror?"
She suggested that people re
sponded more immediately to the
tsunamis due to the relative ease
of making a monetary donation,
but urged that there are plenty of
actions individuals can take to
ameliorate the suffering in the
Sudan as well.
Hamilton advised audience
members to be proactive in con
tacting government representa
tives to make their voices heard
on the issue.
She advocated the enforce
ment of the no-fly zone over Dar
fur to keep the Sudanese govern
ment from bombing civilian vil
lages and promoted a U.S. arms
embargo on Sudan's government.
She also urged students to support
the expansion of the African
Union troops in Sudan, who now
have no power to protect civilians
but only to report violations of the
cease-fire agreement.
Following Hamilton's re
marks, Abernethy questioned the
ethical reasoning and effective
ness of American intervention
and aid operations.
"The ease with which outsiders
can come in [to work for aid pro
grams] means that Africans can
quickly become dependent on
outsiders rather than looking to
themselves to solve problems,"
Abernethy said, adding that for
eign aid programs should be de
signed by the potential recipients
and not by the donors themselves.
He also offered what he noted
to be a controversial perspective
on the HIV' / AIDS epidemic
throughout the African continent.
"Outsiders may want to recon
sider the rationale for funding
HIV/AIDS treatment pro
grams," Abernethy said, explain
ing that the intent of treatment is
to prolong patients' lives despite
negative consequences.
"The longer an infected person
lives the more people he or she is
likely to infect through sexual
contact," he said. "I don't know
the answer to this horrible dilem
ma, but 1 have been struck by the
unwillingness of treatment advo
cates to acknowledge that an ef
fective anti-retroviral program
can have the effect of extending
and prolonging the terrible AIDS
pandemic."
Several students who attended
the event said they were struck by
Abernethy's comments on the sub
ject.
"I was shocked by Abernethy's
statement about AIDS," said sopho
more Jonny Carson. "He really had
a lot of balls to say that."
In contrast to the other panelists,
Weinstein spoke on the progress
made toward improving quality of

life in Africa, including govern
ments' punishment of corruption
and the spread of a more proactive
stance on the AIDS pandemic.
However, he also underscored the
need fora reconstruction of the inter
national community in order to fully
address human rights abuses perpe
trated by African governments.
"Sovereignty should be condi
tional," Weinstein said. "We need to
disband the United Nations and
rewrite the U.N. charter to have a
fundamentally different United Na
tions, in which a state's sovereignty is
conditional on internal treatment of
its citizens."
While some students said they
were shocked by this analysis, others

agreed.
"Rethinking sovereignty in a way
that puts the sanctification of human
life above the protection of political
jurisdiction could be a huge step for
global human rights," said sopho
more Chrissie Coxon. director of the
Roosevelt Institution's Center on
Development.
Freshman Kara Johnson said she
thought the panel presented a bal
ance of views.
"We always get a lot of the ac
tivist perspective, the idealist side,"
she said. "It was good to hear the
Abernethy perspective about the re
alistic and logical consequences and
Prof. Weinstein managed to inte
grate both."
In an effort to discuss the vio
lence in the Darfur region of
Sudan in light of U.S.-African re
lations, a panel of academics and
experts entitled "U.S.-U.N.-
Africa: Darfur and Beyond," con
vened Wednesday night.
The speakers at the event ad
dressed the alleged genocide in
Sudan and the HIV /AIDS pan
demic plaguing most African na
tions.
Organized as the first town
hall meeting presented by the
newly-formed Stanford chapter of
Americans for Informed Democ
racy, or AID, in conjunction with
the Roosevelt Institution's Center
on International Development,
the panel featured Political Sci
ence Profs. David Abernethy and
Jeremy Weinstein.
Panelist David Devlin-Foltz,
director of the Global Interdepen
dence Initiative and a Peace
Corps volunteer in Rwanda,
began the presentation by encour
aging the audience to become
more engaged in international af
fairs. He said that a key part of re
solving the situation in Darfur will
be to educate Americans about
what is happening. The Global In
terdependence Initiative is an or
ganization that seeks to close the
gap between the American pub
lic's values and decisions made by
policymakers.
"Most American attitudes on
Africa are not deeply fixed in any
African reality," Devlin-Foltz
said. "When they are lacking in
formation, people will fall back on
general principles."
He said he blames television
news for the widely-held Ameri
can view that the world is full of
unrelated catastrophic events and
that the United States is the only
nation that can make a difference.
Panelist Heather Hamilton,
vice president of Citizens for
Global Solutions, followed De
vlin-Foltz's call for education with
a call to action, comparing the cri
sis in Darfur to last year's
tsunamis in Southeast Asia. Citi
zens for Global Solutions is a
grassroots organization that en
courages public officials to pro
mote multilateral foreign policy.
"They were a massive natural
event that took hundreds of thou
sands of lives and provoked the
largest outpouring of shock and
compassion," Hamilton said.
