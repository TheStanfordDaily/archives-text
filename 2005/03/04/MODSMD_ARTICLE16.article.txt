# Safety fair held in EV for Stanford families
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There will be no cartoons this
Saturday morning for kids living in
Stanford housing and surrounding
neighborhoods.
In addition to children who live
in Stanford Housing, those who
live on campus, those who attend
Bing Nursery School, Escondido
Elementary School, the Pep
pertree Center, the Rainbow
School and three nearby childcare
centers have been invited to at
tend, along with their parent, to
the second annual Child Safety
Fair tomorrow at the Escondido
Village Center and the Cottage
Room.
Parents who attend the session,
starting at 9:30 a.m., will learn
about the potential threat
strangers pose to children and
neighborhood safety tactics from
representatives of the Vanished
Children's Alliance, or VCA, and
the Stanford Department of Public
Safety, or SDPS.
SDPS will also provide free
child fingerprinting for photo
identification cards. VCA will
offer interactive safety skills pre
sentations specifically for children
ages three through six and ages six
and older. And as a reward for get
ting up early on a Saturday morn
ing, parents can enter a raffle for
more than 65 donated prizes and
meet other parents in the area.
"The purpose of the event is to
educate families about issues relat
ed to child safety," said Assistant

Dean of Graduate Life Andy Her
nandez. "I'm excited because this
is an opportunity for parents and
children to learn important infor
mation while having a good time."
Kathleen Strickler. a Escondi
do family community associate
who helped plan the event, noted
that "while it is a privilege to live in
the well protected, safe communi
ty of Escondido Village, many par
ents forget about the importance
of teaching stranger awareness
and neighborhood safety to their
children."
Many local parents, such as EV
Family CA Kim Heermann-Do,
agreed that the event offers kids
and parents a rare opportunity to
interact with safety officers.
"1 have three children ages
eight, six and three, and they are
all excited about attending the fair
again this year," Heermann-Do
said. "Last year the opportunity to
meet a police officer up close was
the highlight of the event for my
children."
Shawn Palermo, also an EV
Family CA who attended the
event last year with her children,
praised the entertainment value of
the presentations for the kids who
attend.
"The people giving the talk
know how to maintain the kids' at
tention while getting the point
across," Palermo said. "A parent
or child can never be too ready for
any kind of emergency. The more
we hear it, the more prepared we
will be."
According to Hernandez, child

safety fairs were held annually a
decade ago, hut stopped being or
ganized until EV family communi
ty associate Emily Downs — who
attended a similar set of activities
off campus — suggested that Stan
ford host the event last year.
At last year's fair, more than
275 children were fingerprinted
for identification cards. Organiz
ers said they expect to have a simi
lar level of participation this week
end.
Hernandez said he hopes that
graduate student parents living
off-campus will learn about the
event via their children's schools
or word of mouth. He noted that
there are currently no University
statistics on exactly how many off
campus graduate students have
families.
EV alone houses approximate
ly 300 families within courtyards
55 to 115. In addition to the Child
Safety Fair, EV family community
associates coordinate local court
yard activities, seasonal events, fall

and spring yard sales and an annu
al Graduate Family Carnival.
"The EV community is a
uniquely concentrated population
of families with children," Downs
said. "The safety event is a perfect
fit with the community."
Strickler said that as a mother
of four children under age five, she
would like to see the Child Safety
Event become a permanent annu
al event.
"New families with children of
all ages arc moving into EV each
year and this Fair will give them a
chance to participate in an EV
wide activity with their children,"
she said. "The Child Safety Fair
can serve as a reminder for parents
to update their children's pho
tographs annually. It also involves
outside volunteers and the com
munity at large. The event shows
that the EV Family CAs deeply
care about other issues concerning
our families, such as safety, rather
than just being about fun and
games all the time."
