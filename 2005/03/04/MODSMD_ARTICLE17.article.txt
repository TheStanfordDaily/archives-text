"The only way Washington is
going to act is if you act," said John
Pendergast, the presidential advisor
to the International Crisis Group,
during his talk last night about the
wars in Darfur, southern Sudan and
northern Uganda. The Internation
al Crisis Group is a non-profit,
multinational, non-governmental
organization that attempts to pre
vent and alleviate conflict.
Stressing the interlocking nature
of the conflicts, he said it is neces
sary for people to realize that it isn't
just Darfur that is on fire, it is the en
tire region where the province is lo
cated.
Compatible peace agreements
must be reached in all three con
flicts, he said.
"The current approach of
dealing with each of them indi
vidually will only ensure that
these three wars will continue or
resume in all three places," Pen
dergast said.
He discussed the need fora new
policy in light of the advances and
setbacks that have recently taken
place within the region, criticizing
the Sudan Comprehensive Peace
Agreement that was recently
reached in the north-south conflict.
"There was nothing comprehen
sive about the process," Pendergast

said. "Most of the political parties
were not involved so nothing was
comprehensive about the result ei
ther."
Prendergast said he interpreted
the peace settlement as a political
move by the Khartoum government
to deflect attention from Darfur and
gain international popularity.
Yet he said he was optimistic
about the resolution of all three con
flicts and presented several reasons
he believed that now is the best
chance for peace.
"This is a crucial moment of op
portunity that I haven't seen in 18
years of the conflict in Uganda,"
Prendergast said. "It is a slim oppor
tunity, but the peace deal gives less
rationale for the Sudanese govern
ment to support the Lord's Resis
tance Army."
He pointed out that although the
genocide is now in its "mop-up
phase," several factors — such as
the government's strict policies to
deter aid workers from entering the
region — could lead to more vio
lence in Darfur.
"There's only one thing that's
worse than genocide and that's
genocide on top of a famine," Pren
dergast said.
He made several policy sugges
tions to strength the protection civil
ians, including the expansion of the
existing African Union force of

I ,K()() troops.
He added that "if there were
some specific targeted sanctions
against the government, then we
would see a change in behavior —
we would see the end of genocide."
Stressing that these changes are
realistic, Pendergast said that re
solving the situation is largely a
question of money and political will,
which is directly related to the
amount of pressure exerted on
elected officials.
Several students said they were
moved by this call to action.
"1 think the most important thing
he said tonight is that there are actu
ally ways that the United States can
get involved to stop this problem,"
said freshman Aaron Zagory.
"There just isn't enough momentum
pushing for it, even though we have
student groups right here on campus
doing this."
A coalition of students from the
Roosevelt Institution Center on In
ternational Development met with
Prendergast after the event to dis
cuss policy recommendations that
they hope to publish on the national
level.
The event, which was open to the
public, was sponsored by the Stan
ford African Student Association,
the Muslim Student Awareness
Network, Six Degrees: A Stanford
Journal of Human Rights and the
Political Science Department.
