## Editorial 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' should go 
### 
Last week. Rep. Martin Meehan (D-Mass.) pro
posed a bill to the U.S. Congress that would repeal the
"Don't Ask. Don't Tell" policy for gays in the mili
tary. Initiated by former President Bill Clinton, the
12-year-old policy states that military personnel are
not to be questioned about their sexual orientation or
be permitted to acknowledge openly or participate in
homosexual activity. If Meehan's bill is passed, homo
sexual soldiers would be able to openly acknowledge
their sexuality and still continue serving in the mili
tary. Meehan, a gay-rights advocate and senior mem
ber of House Armed Services Committee, proposed
the policy change in response to the Department of
Defense's latest report on the recent decline in re
cruitment and retention.
Rather than criticizing the "Don't Ask" policy be
cause it sanctions discrimination, proponents of the
measure are calling for its end because it has caused
1 (),(KM) military personnel, some with vital language
skills, to be discharged because of their sexual orien
tations over the past 10 years. According to the Gov
ernment Accountability Office, the recruitment and
training of replacements has cost at least $2(X) million
for the Army, Navy and Air Force. Nevertheless all
sectors of the armed services are below quota.
This bill is highly problematic because it is not
based on a recognition of the innate violation of
rights, but rather on the temporary need for more
troops. Not only does Meehan's proposal harken back
to Civil War legislation allowing African-Americans
to enlist in exchange for the promise of freedom from
slavery, but it also shows how little progress has been
made towards America's ideal of true equality.

Nonetheless, for practical and democratic reasons,
the nation should repeal the "Don't Ask" policy —
any voter should he allowed to voluntarily serve their
country free from discrimination based on sexual ori
entation. While the motivation for the bill may have
had more to do with criticisms of the Bush adminis
tration's policies and actions in the Middle East than
a sudden realization of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"
policy's inherent unfairness, the bill would still re
move a discriminatory practice from the books.
Gay-rights activists should not confuse this with
real government support, though. Instead, they must
continue to work hard to ensure that this becomes a
real and permanent victory, rather than a temporary
one.
In addition, because this proposed bill is motivated
by practicality and reflects no underlying change in
the principles of the U.S. military, we are concerned
that gays serving in the military might face continued
discrimination due to their sexual orientation. Homo
sexuals in the armed forces might not receive the same
support from the military administration as their het
erosexual coworkers.
We support Meehan's dedication to gay rights and
to the armed forces. Although this legislation pro
posed by a Democrat in a predominantly Republican
Congress has little chance of passing, the discussion of
discrimination and gay rights is important. Not only is
the "Don't Ask. Don't Tell" policy denying patriotic
Americans from serving but it is an indulgence that
the armed forces can no longer afford. End "Don't
Ask, Don't Tell" not because it hurts the military, but
because it hurts democracy.
