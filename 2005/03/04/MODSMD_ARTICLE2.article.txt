# Free wireless Internet offered in Palo Alto
## 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
Students who want to use free
wireless Internet over dessert at the
Cheesecake Factory or over lattes at
the University Cafe are in luck.
On Tuesday, Anchor Free Wire
less, a Sunnyvale-based wireless In
ternet provider, decided to make
wireless Web access free on Universi
ty Avenue. Now anyone can access
the Internet in all stores, restaurants
and outdoor areas within what An
chor Free has designated the Palo
Alto Hotzone â€” the section of Uni
versity Avenue extending from Mid
dlefield Road to High Street.
"You can walk from one establish
ment to another and always be on
line," said David Gorodyansky, pres
ident of Anchor Free.
Wireless in the "hotzone" has
been available through Anchor Free
since May, but until Tuesday the
company had been charging about $5
per month for the service.
According to Denis Hiller, com
munications director for Anchor-
Free, the company has only an
nounced its decisions to clients who
used the company's service before
the change but will make a public an
nouncement soon.
Gorodyansky said that while An
chor Free is now providing free wire
less, other Internet providers will also
continue serving the hotzone. Web
users can view and choose between
multiple wireless connections that
are available when they open their
laptops, he said.

He added that students and busi
nessmen can also pay for Web access
under plans sponsored by specific lo
cations. For example, the Starbucks
on University Avenue offers T-Mo
bile wireless for prepaid monthly or
hourly rates. Managers at Starbucks
could not be reached for comment on
whether they will continue charging
for wireless.
According to Hiller, feedback
from Stanford students played a sig
nificant role in AnchorFree's deci
sion to make service free. The com
pany's officers came across an article
that appeared last May in The Stan
ford Daily in which students implied
that although the availability of wire
less access on University Avenue is
convenient, they would not be willing
to pay the monthly service charge.
"It became really clear to us that
we had to do this when The Daily ar
ticle came out," Hiller said. "It really
sent a strong message to us that stu
dents will use wireless more than any
one but that doesn't mean they'll pay
to use it."
But the high demand for free wire
less capabilities is not limited to stu
dents.
"People want a place to use the In
ternet wirelessly outside their homes,
schools and offices, and want to have
some money leftover in their wal
lets," Hiller said.
In his State of the City Address
last year, San Francisco Mayor Gavin
Newsom said that providing free
wireless Internet to all of the city's
residents is a high priority.
