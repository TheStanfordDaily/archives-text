# Free wireless Internet offered in Palo Alto
## 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
Students who want to use free
wireless Internet over dessert at the
Cheesecake Factory or over lattes at
the University Cafe are in luck.
On Tuesday, Anchor Free Wire
less, a Sunnyvale-based wireless In
ternet provider, decided to make
wireless Web access free on Universi
ty Avenue. Now anyone can access
the Internet in all stores, restaurants
and outdoor areas within what An
chor Free has designated the Palo
Alto Hotzone â€” the section of Uni
versity Avenue extending from Mid
dlefield Road to High Street.
"You can walk from one establish
ment to another and always be on
line," said David Gorodyansky, pres
ident of Anchor Free.
Wireless in the "hotzone" has
been available through Anchor Free
since May, but until Tuesday the
company had been charging about $5
per month for the service.
According to Denis Hiller, com
munications director for Anchor-
Free, the company has only an
nounced its decisions to clients who
used the company's service before
the change but will make a public an
nouncement soon.
Gorodyansky said that while An
chor Free is now providing free wire
less, other Internet providers will also
continue serving the hotzone. Web
users can view and choose between
multiple wireless connections that
are available when they open their
laptops, he said.

He added that students and busi
nessmen can also pay for Web access
under plans sponsored by specific lo
cations. For example, the Starbucks
on University Avenue offers T-Mo
bile wireless for prepaid monthly or
hourly rates. Managers at Starbucks
could not be reached for comment on
whether they will continue charging
for wireless.
According to Hiller, feedback
from Stanford students played a sig
nificant role in AnchorFree's deci
sion to make service free. The com
pany's officers came across an article
that appeared last May in The Stan
ford Daily in which students implied
that although the availability of wire
less access on University Avenue is
convenient, they would not be willing
to pay the monthly service charge.
"It became really clear to us that
we had to do this when The Daily ar
ticle came out," Hiller said. "It really
sent a strong message to us that stu
dents will use wireless more than any
one but that doesn't mean they'll pay
to use it."
But the high demand for free wire
less capabilities is not limited to stu
dents.
"People want a place to use the In
ternet wirelessly outside their homes,
schools and offices, and want to have
some money leftover in their wal
lets," Hiller said.
In his State of the City Address
last year, San Francisco Mayor Gavin
Newsom said that providing free
wireless Internet to all of the city's
residents is a high priority.
"We will not stop until every San
Franciscan has access to free wireless
Internet service," Newsom said in the
speech. "These technologies will con
nect our residents to the skills and the
jobs of the new economy."
Newsom's statement also influ
enced AnchorFree's change in poli
cy, and the company launched the
Marina District Hotzone in San Fran
cisco on Monday.
"There's no need to charge be
cause there's free wireless access pro
vided by other companies,"
Gorodyansky said. "We have a lot of
users and we couldn't have kept it at
$5 per month."
Hiller said that, ironically, An
chor Free needed to stop charging for
its services in order to stay afloat.
"If we didn't do this, we'd go out
of business," he said.
According to Gorodyansky, the
main objective of Anchor Free is to

"make large metropolitan cities wire
less." He added that the company
should have enough financial support
to achieve its goal.
"We have investors that pay for it
to be free," Gorodyansky said.
He added that companies have
much to gain from funding Anchor-
Free because free wireless will ex
pose more users to Internet adver
tisements.
Junior Howie Chiou said he
thinks AnchorFree's policy-shift will
be a huge benefit for Stanford stu
dents who enjoy studying off-cam
pus.
"Because so much of our academ
ic work is dependent on the Internet,
we're really limited to work or study
in places that offer wireless," Chiou
said.
Currently, he does not leave cam
pus to study more than twice a week
due to the lack of public areas that
provide free wireless service. Howev
er, he said AnchorFree's decision to
stop charging for wireless access may
prompt him and others to take a
break from campus and spend more
time downtown.
