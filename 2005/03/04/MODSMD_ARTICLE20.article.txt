## Give the frosh a beer 
### 
Though I don't hail from one of the nation's many
"dry counties," 1 did enter Stanford nearly four years ago
having lived a Prohibitionist's dream childhood. My
rural upbringing offered the choice of two extremities:
either doing nothing on the weekends, and doing it dryly.

or lubing up the non-activity with a
few light beers and feeling the effects
the next day. I chose the former.
My freshman introduction to wet
Stanford came at a handful of ill
spent frat parties, whose music 1
found loathsome and undanceable,
whose "ambience" was laughably
non-existent and whose beer, to
paraphrase Mark Twain, was chlo
roform in a keg. Only a stunning
bottle of Chianti early in my sopho
more year could break that dreary

spell of alcohol-hatred.
These awkward and distasteful memories come back
to me whenever I consider the alcohol policy at Stanford.
It is a policy that subscribes to an indefensible state defi
nition of "minors"; a policy whose half-enforcement ad
mits to the shallowness of that law; a policy whose recent
alterations endanger students even as they relieve Uni
versity liability.
It is a policy that should be abandoned altogether.
A few things must be established. First, the glass of
red wine, or the daily beer, does a body — or at least
most people's bodies — good. Second, the 21-year-old
"minor" law is an arbitrary measure of maturity that Cal
ifornia adopted for the unrelated matter of securing fed
eral funds for state road-building. Third, the attempted
protection from substances only drives usage under
ground and gives rise to hidden binge-death episodes
and general overindulgence.
Fourth, I could die for — and be killed by — my
country at age 18, but I could not legally drink. Lastly,
when I received the elective franchise four years ago, the
government deemed me mature enough to vote for
George W. Bush, had I wished to, but nut so mature as to
throw back the gin-and-tonic necessary for the contem
plation of his governance.
Stanford is isolated, aspires to independence and
states ad nauseam its desire to challenge students and
break new barriers. And yet, the University states nomi
nal accordance with drinking laws in its "Controlled Sub
stances and Alcohol Policy."
But everyone knows that minors at Stanford drink,
and often with the collusion of residence staff. Stanford's

own practiced oversight, long admired for the comrade
ship it fosters between dorm residents and staff, is an ad
mission that administrators don't want to see hordes of
students being hauled off to a nearby jail for having the
temerity to enjoy a Tecate.
So Stanford has set an unattainable standard whose
half-enforcement reveals the University's lack of com
mitment to both legal technicality (admirable) and the
"moral" of the standard itself (also admirable). A policy
like that should be given a Coors Lite and put out to pas
ture.
Instead. Stanford imposed a set of Wilberforcian
restrictions at the beginning of last school year: no
more parties in first-year dorm lounges, hallways and
outdoor areas, to say nothing of bathrooms, bal
conies, catwalks, cupolas and staircases, spiral or oth
erwise.
The new policy sets the tables for binge-promoting
closed-door consumption even as it lessens the Universi
ty's liability therein. That trade of student safety for eco
nomic security would make me reach for the "morality"
section of the Fundamental Standard, if only I hadn't
sold my copy fora six-pack of Sam Adams Cranberry
Lambic.
As for non-drinkers, the "culture of drinking" that
Residential Education sought to end with its 2003
changes would be better confronted by an increase in
limited-alcohol, dry or four-class dorms. On that last
point. Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education John
Bravman's new housing proposal — to house all frosh
on east campus — would simply engender a twice-week
ly cross-campus trek of frosh to the frat cluster and back.
Think we'll have some open containers and biking
under-the-influence then?
There is no reason to continue to lie prostrate to Cal
ifornia law and Congressional diktats. We have the law
students, we have the endowment: the University must
now undertake a massive act of civil disobedience
against the repressive drinking laws of the state and na
tion.
Guzzle, imbibe, inebriate, swig, swill, tip and quaff. So
many words for such an enthralling private pleasure. An
RF-led wine-sampling at New Student Orientation, a
"Dos Equis" policy at Stanford catering, the needful
scotch at house meeting — it's time fora genuine "resi
dential education" in that smart, healthful and fine art of
alcohol consumption.

Though I don't hail from one of the nation's many
"dry counties," 1 did enter Stanford nearly four years ago
having lived a Prohibitionist's dream childhood. My
rural upbringing offered the choice of two extremities:
either doing nothing on the weekends, and doing it dryly.

or lubing up the non-activity with a
few light beers and feeling the effects
the next day. I chose the former.
My freshman introduction to wet
Stanford came at a handful of ill
spent frat parties, whose music 1
found loathsome and undanceable,
whose "ambience" was laughably
non-existent and whose beer, to
paraphrase Mark Twain, was chlo
roform in a keg. Only a stunning
bottle of Chianti early in my sopho
more year could break that dreary

spell of alcohol-hatred.
These awkward and distasteful memories come back
to me whenever I consider the alcohol policy at Stanford.
It is a policy that subscribes to an indefensible state defi
nition of "minors"; a policy whose half-enforcement ad
mits to the shallowness of that law; a policy whose recent
alterations endanger students even as they relieve Uni
versity liability.
It is a policy that should be abandoned altogether.
A few things must be established. First, the glass of
red wine, or the daily beer, does a body — or at least
most people's bodies — good. Second, the 21-year-old
"minor" law is an arbitrary measure of maturity that Cal
ifornia adopted for the unrelated matter of securing fed
eral funds for state road-building. Third, the attempted
protection from substances only drives usage under
ground and gives rise to hidden binge-death episodes
and general overindulgence.
Fourth, I could die for — and be killed by — my
country at age 18, but I could not legally drink. Lastly,
when I received the elective franchise four years ago, the
government deemed me mature enough to vote for
George W. Bush, had I wished to, but nut so mature as to
throw back the gin-and-tonic necessary for the contem
plation of his governance.
Stanford is isolated, aspires to independence and
states ad nauseam its desire to challenge students and
break new barriers. And yet, the University states nomi
nal accordance with drinking laws in its "Controlled Sub
stances and Alcohol Policy."
But everyone knows that minors at Stanford drink,
and often with the collusion of residence staff. Stanford's

own practiced oversight, long admired for the comrade
ship it fosters between dorm residents and staff, is an ad
mission that administrators don't want to see hordes of
students being hauled off to a nearby jail for having the
temerity to enjoy a Tecate.
So Stanford has set an unattainable standard whose
half-enforcement reveals the University's lack of com
mitment to both legal technicality (admirable) and the
"moral" of the standard itself (also admirable). A policy
like that should be given a Coors Lite and put out to pas
ture.
Instead. Stanford imposed a set of Wilberforcian
restrictions at the beginning of last school year: no
more parties in first-year dorm lounges, hallways and
outdoor areas, to say nothing of bathrooms, bal
conies, catwalks, cupolas and staircases, spiral or oth
