Gender op-ed 'totally missed the point 7
While I applaud Julie Park's stance that the gender
General Education requirement, or GER, should re
main a requirement for all students ("Why the gender
GER matters," Mar. 2), I have to say that Park totally
missed the point.
The area 4C requirement is a way to examine how
one's own life has been impacted by one's gender,
not one giant complaint session about clothing and
make-up that women must wear. This beauty culture
is only one facet of gender study, and even then,
these particular examples are specific to American
beauty culture. Within the study of gender, students
get the opportunity to look at the creation and ex
pression of gender worldwide and in all facets of life,
for both men and women. We need only read one of

the articles on the Harvard President Laurence
Summers' remarks on women in science to realize
that gender issues are very much a part of everyday
life.
And for the men out there, deciding that they'd like to
support the ending of the 4C requirement rather than be
demonized by every woman they meet, 1 offer a quote
from Daily Columnist Anne Friedman's article "It's bad
for guys, too" (Jan. 12), who examined the gender stereo
types placed on men only to realize that "The gap is clos
ing. Gender roles are increasingly becoming an equal op
portunity discriminator. And it hurts everyone."
If you find this statement as interesting as I do, 1 hope
you support the 4C GER.
