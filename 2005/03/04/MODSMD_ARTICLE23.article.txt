# Counting Sheep
## Filling in the hole 
### 
I've dealt with my fair share of con
troversy (and hate mail) these past
couple of weeks, so 1 thought fora
change I'd depart from questions of
patriotism and same-sex marriage and
focus instead on a Stanford issue.
Surely nothing I say in the next few
hundred words will garner me the title
of "typical clinton dickless, brainless
sheeple following a coward onward"
— whatever that means.
Let me start by adding a little ethos
to my ensuing argument (ethos, incase

you missed the
term mentioned
9,200 times in
PWR 1, refers to
the authority of
the author): In ele
mentary school
when my friends
declared their
presidential and
astronautical am
bitions, 1 declared

my intention to go to Stanford Univer
sity — 1 was an assuming six year-old.
All this time, however, 1 also har
bored the goal of swimming in college.
As high school drew to a close I real
ized that swimming for the perennial
powerhouse Cardinal was just out of
my league, so 1 pursued some other
avenues. One of those East Coast
schools in particular was making a
strong case for itself... but obviously
1 ultimately chose Stanford over
sports. And my, oh my, did 1 get it
right.
But here I am, not quite good
enough to be on the Stanford squad,
which has incidentally won 23 consec
utive Pac-10 Championships, and I
have no other option than full-on re
tirement — something I'm not sure
that I'm entirely prepared for. And I
know that I'm not alone in feeling this
way. Going from total athletic dedica
tion to, well, I-Hum papers, is quite a
transition, so you've got to find other
things to dedicate yourself to — like
Assassins, "The 0.C.," cheap beer
and unintentionally controversial

columns.
There is technically another outlet
for my pent-up dedication (aside from
academics, of course) and that would
he club sports. According to the Stan
ford Athletics Department, "well over
1,000 participants within the Stanford
community currently take part in one
or more of the 16 club sports offered."
That's all good, except there are no
club teams in sports where varsity
teams exist — save for soccer.
That means the water polo and
baseball players, the rowers, the gym
nasts, the basketball and volleyball
players and yes, the swimmers, who
chose Stanford for academic or other
non-athletic reasons are left with no
club sport alternative. And while
some of these sports exist at the intra
mural level, my one dismal experience
(not) dodging dodgeballs gives me the
distinct impression that IMs don't re
ally fill the void left by retirement.
As far as swimming goes, there
aren't many options. Sure there's
Masters Swimming, which 1 under
stand is a great program, but there are
few undergrads there and really no
sense of a team. I tried my hand at
triathlon with our club team, but truth
be told, any given Myth and Moderni
ty lecture is more appealing than run
ning — at least to me. Three weeks of
struggling with the "tri" in "triathlete"
was enough to convince me that you
can't fill a swimming-shaped hole with
running or biking — and 1 believe that
a similar principle applies to a lot of
other undergrads.
So in the best PWR tradition, I'll
put my thesis at the end: 1 beseech
Stanford to offer a wider array of club
sports for its students, especially in
preexisting varsity sports — if for no
other reason than the lugging the
"freshman 15" around gets old come
winter quarter.
