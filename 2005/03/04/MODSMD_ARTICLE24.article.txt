## Going back to the drawing board with housing proposal 
### KHAULAH KARIM LAUREN GRAHAM 
Since Vice Provost for Undergrad
uate Education John Bravman's pro
posal to overhaul the University hous
ing system was unveiled earlier this
month, concern for the future of resi
dential life has spread across campus.
In the housing proposal, Bravman
stated that the goals of the changes
would be to provide "1) a more bal
anced freshman housing experience;
2) a superior upper-class experience
marked by a guarantee of a generally
escalating quality of housing... and;
3) a restoration of academic program
spaces to the residences ... along with
un-stuffing the housing system and ra
tionalizing The Draw."
While improving on-campus hous
ing is a welcome change, Bravman's
proposal needs to further address stu
dents' concerns. As it stands, the hous
ing proposal takes away autonomy
and choice from entering freshmen. It
also puts ethnic-theme dorms in a pre
carious position by placing them in un
desirable locations and diminishing
their atmosphere and appeal.
Bravman promotes a vague idea of
a "balanced freshman housing experi
ence" that deserves further considera
tion. In the new housing plan, Brav
man equates balance with homogene
ity through standardized housing and
a "common freshman year experi
ence." However, there is nothing
"standard" about the freshman expe
rience. Individual preference is what
makes freshmen dorms either loved

or loathed by new students. There
fore, freshmen should be able to accli
mate to Stanford within the living en
vironment of their choice.
The housing plan is even more jar
ring to student life because of its uncer
tain implications for the stability of
Stanford's ethnic communities. While
Bravman promised that Ujamaa will
remain four-class, the relocation of
Ujamaa to a freshman cluster threat
ens the house's four-class composition.
If the plan is to create "superior upper
class housing," while simultaneously
placing four-class theme dorms in the
lowest level of priority housing avail
able. theme dorms will instantly be
come less desirable. It is unfair to force
upperclassmen to choose between liv
ing in an ethnic-theme dorm and bene
fiting from the "superior housing" that
the plan promises.
In many ways, Ujamaa already em
bodies the improvements in residen
tial life that Bravman proposes: It pro
vides a nurturing, supportive environ
ment to freshmen, an intellectual com
munity fostered through theme pro
grams on multiculturalism and bal
anced social interaction between stu
dents of all four classes. Jeopardizing
the status of four-class ethnic-theme
dorms runs counter to the University's
commitment to diversity in all forms.
Bravman said that change "has
been Stanford's way." However, uni
lateral change is not Stanford's way.
The student voice has historically
been incorporated into University de
cision-making. If Bravman's plan is
truly "the beginning of a long period

of study, deliberation and analysis,"
then all students' voices should strate
gically be a part of the initial planning
phases. Moreover, the Ujamaa com
munity is based upon a greater bond
than the class ties that Bravman's plan
aims to foster. Ujamaa is built upon
cultural ties, historic ties and familial
ties that span across decades. This
legacy cannot be changed.
Yes, change is welcome, but so is
balance. If Bravman seeks to ease the
increased demand for freshman hous
ing that is not being fully met, more op
tions should be created — but not at
the expense of the four-class or ethnic
theme dorms. Moreover, if there is con
sistently an overwhelming demand
from students of all classes to live in eth
nic-theme dorms, why not expand op
tions for students to live there as well?
As Bravman stated, "Change is
hard." Yet, change could be even
harder if integral parts of the Stanford
community are neglected. Change
will ultimately come when all students
are extended full inclusion and con
sideration. We invite the University to
change — and to change responsibly.

dorms runs counter to the University's
commitment to diversity in all forms.
Bravman said that change "has
been Stanford's way." However, uni
lateral change is not Stanford's way.
The student voice has historically
been incorporated into University de
cision-making. If Bravman's plan is
truly "the beginning of a long period

of study, deliberation and analysis,"
then all students' voices should strate
gically be a part of the initial planning
phases. Moreover, the Ujamaa com
munity is based upon a greater bond
than the class ties that Bravman's plan
aims to foster. Ujamaa is built upon
cultural ties, historic ties and familial
ties that span across decades. This
legacy cannot be changed.
Yes, change is welcome, but so is
balance. If Bravman seeks to ease the
increased demand for freshman hous
ing that is not being fully met, more op
tions should be created — but not at
the expense of the four-class or ethnic
theme dorms. Moreover, if there is con
sistently an overwhelming demand
from students of all classes to live in eth
nic-theme dorms, why not expand op
tions for students to live there as well?
As Bravman stated, "Change is
hard." Yet, change could be even
harder if integral parts of the Stanford
community are neglected. Change
will ultimately come when all students
are extended full inclusion and con
sideration. We invite the University to
change — and to change responsibly.
