## Jeff Dorman Sucks! A

I'm not going to say I was trying to hurt the
guy. Personally, I had very little against him,
aside from the fact that he had stolen the
ball from me seconds before. I'm sure he was a
good kid, who had good grades, lived in a mod
est house and fed his pet snake on a regular
basis. But he had just stolen the ball from me,
and in my 11-year-old state of mind, he de
served some comeuppance.
"You're slow," my coach once told me. "But
you're the best slide-tackier on the team." This

quote, while not a ringing en
dorsement of my soccer skills,
might let you in on what hap
pened next. With little
Timmy rapidly leaving my
sphere of influence, I slid into
him, knocking the ball out of
bounds and sending Timmy
to the bench with an icepack
on his ankle and tears running
down his cheeks.
It was a legal tackle, it was

not a foul, and I'll claim I wasn't trying to hurt
him, but it was the last time I ever intentionally
struck an opponent.
This should be the last time for John Chaney
as well.
Chaney, head coach of Temple's men's bas
ketball team, during a recent Atlantic-10 game
against St. Joseph's, instructed a bench player,
Nehemiah Ingram, to be his "goon". He en
couraged Ingram to intentionally injure the
other team in protest of non-calls that he felt
were illegal screens. Ingram, who subsequently
fouled out in four minutes, broke St. Joseph's
forward John Bryant's arm with an absurd foul:
a two-handed shove of Bryant's face and torso
that forced him to the floor, with his arm
pinned under his body. It ended Bryant's last
year of NCAA eligibility.
Chaney initially boasted about his "goon"
during the post-game press conference, al
though he has since apologized for the incident.
Once X-rays revealed that Bryant's arm was
broken and common sense revealed that
Chaney should be punished. Temple suspend
ed the coach for the rest of the season, which
amounts to three games. Chaney has also of
fered to pay for the injured player's medical
