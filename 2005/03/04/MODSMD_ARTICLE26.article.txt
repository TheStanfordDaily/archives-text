## Jeff Dorman Sucks! A 						part of sports that shouldn't be 
### 
I'm not going to say I was trying to hurt the
guy. Personally, I had very little against him,
aside from the fact that he had stolen the
ball from me seconds before. I'm sure he was a
good kid, who had good grades, lived in a mod
est house and fed his pet snake on a regular
basis. But he had just stolen the ball from me,
and in my 11-year-old state of mind, he de
served some comeuppance.
"You're slow," my coach once told me. "But
you're the best slide-tackier on the team." This

quote, while not a ringing en
dorsement of my soccer skills,
might let you in on what hap
pened next. With little
Timmy rapidly leaving my
sphere of influence, I slid into
him, knocking the ball out of
bounds and sending Timmy
to the bench with an icepack
on his ankle and tears running
down his cheeks.
It was a legal tackle, it was

not a foul, and I'll claim I wasn't trying to hurt
him, but it was the last time I ever intentionally
struck an opponent.
This should be the last time for John Chaney
as well.
Chaney, head coach of Temple's men's bas
ketball team, during a recent Atlantic-10 game
against St. Joseph's, instructed a bench player,
Nehemiah Ingram, to be his "goon". He en
couraged Ingram to intentionally injure the
other team in protest of non-calls that he felt
were illegal screens. Ingram, who subsequently
fouled out in four minutes, broke St. Joseph's
forward John Bryant's arm with an absurd foul:
a two-handed shove of Bryant's face and torso
that forced him to the floor, with his arm
pinned under his body. It ended Bryant's last
year of NCAA eligibility.
Chaney initially boasted about his "goon"
during the post-game press conference, al
though he has since apologized for the incident.
Once X-rays revealed that Bryant's arm was
broken and common sense revealed that
Chaney should be punished. Temple suspend
ed the coach for the rest of the season, which
amounts to three games. Chaney has also of
fered to pay for the injured player's medical


Spencer Porter
hills and has met with the player's family to
apologize.
This, while a step in the right direction,
is not enough.
Chaney should be tired.
Not after the season, not after the tour
nament, hut today. Right now. Within the
hour. I want a reactionary, knee-jerk,
zero-tolerance reaction to this type of be
havior.
But it's not going to happen.
It's not going to happen because
Chaney is a respected coach, because he
has been ar6uhd since the Fillmore admin
istration and because he takes chances on

inner-city kids. Even though he instructed
his player to physically injure the other
team, even though he threatened to kill
another coach at a press conference in
IW4 and even though Bryant will not play
another collegiate basketball game,
Chaney will not be fired. He will be given
a graceful exit, a health excuse and will re
tire on his own terms.
Which brings us to the real reason why
he won't he fired.
He won't he fired because this sort of
thing, coaches telling their players to play
dirty, happens all the time.
It happens in every game of every
sport, and I'm counting synchronized
swimming.
It happens from youth leagues to the
pros, from the National Association for
Collegiate Athletics to Division I, and
from playground epics to epic sports

movies. Obligatory Karate Kid "Sweep
the Leg!" reference here: Put him in a
bodybag indeed!
But every time you've seen a retaliato
ry foul, every time you've been told to
"send a message" and every time you hear
a collision echo through the entire stadi
um, you've seen someone acting with in
tent to injure.
You've seen the baserunner breaking up
the double play with a cleat to the knee, the
boxer punishing a bleeding eye and the soc
cer player making the intimidating tackle.
And every coach has requested it.
So when we hear pundits asking for
Chaney's head - the story even made it
onto NPR - we can also hear the nervous
squirming of every athlete, coach and wa
terboy in the United States, because we all
could be found guilty of unnecessary
roughness.

Intimidation, fouling and contact are
all definitely a part of most sports - basket
hall. of course, included. But in the colle
giate sphere especially, there is more at
stake than just athletic gain. If Chaney was
trying to teach kids social responsibility, as
many coaches tend to do, he failed miser
ably. If he was trying to teach the referees
a lesson, which was his original intent, he
chose the worst way to do it. But if he or
ders his players to deliberately break rules
and bones alike, it's time for him to go.
Playing hard is one thing. Intimidation can
be a great part of the game. Intentional
fouls happen.
Chaney, however, embodies the worst
of what competition brings out of us. Get
him off the court.

guy. Personally, I had very little against him,
aside from the fact that he had stolen the
ball from me seconds before. I'm sure he was a
good kid, who had good grades, lived in a mod
est house and fed his pet snake on a regular
basis. But he had just stolen the ball from me,
and in my 11-year-old state of mind, he de
served some comeuppance.
"You're slow," my coach once told me. "But
you're the best slide-tackier on the team." This

quote, while not a ringing en
dorsement of my soccer skills,
might let you in on what hap
pened next. With little
Timmy rapidly leaving my
sphere of influence, I slid into
him, knocking the ball out of
bounds and sending Timmy
to the bench with an icepack
on his ankle and tears running
down his cheeks.
It was a legal tackle, it was

not a foul, and I'll claim I wasn't trying to hurt
him, but it was the last time I ever intentionally
struck an opponent.
This should be the last time for John Chaney
as well.
Chaney, head coach of Temple's men's bas
ketball team, during a recent Atlantic-10 game
against St. Joseph's, instructed a bench player,
Nehemiah Ingram, to be his "goon". He en
couraged Ingram to intentionally injure the
other team in protest of non-calls that he felt
were illegal screens. Ingram, who subsequently
fouled out in four minutes, broke St. Joseph's
forward John Bryant's arm with an absurd foul:
a two-handed shove of Bryant's face and torso
that forced him to the floor, with his arm
pinned under his body. It ended Bryant's last
year of NCAA eligibility.
Chaney initially boasted about his "goon"
during the post-game press conference, al
though he has since apologized for the incident.
Once X-rays revealed that Bryant's arm was
broken and common sense revealed that
Chaney should be punished. Temple suspend
ed the coach for the rest of the season, which
amounts to three games. Chaney has also of
fered to pay for the injured player's medical


Spencer Porter
hills and has met with the player's family to
apologize.
This, while a step in the right direction,
is not enough.
Chaney should be tired.
Not after the season, not after the tour
nament, hut today. Right now. Within the
hour. I want a reactionary, knee-jerk,
zero-tolerance reaction to this type of be
havior.
But it's not going to happen.
It's not going to happen because
Chaney is a respected coach, because he
has been ar6uhd since the Fillmore admin
istration and because he takes chances on

inner-city kids. Even though he instructed
his player to physically injure the other
team, even though he threatened to kill
another coach at a press conference in
IW4 and even though Bryant will not play
another collegiate basketball game,
Chaney will not be fired. He will be given
a graceful exit, a health excuse and will re
tire on his own terms.
Which brings us to the real reason why
he won't he fired.
He won't he fired because this sort of
thing, coaches telling their players to play
dirty, happens all the time.
It happens in every game of every
sport, and I'm counting synchronized
swimming.
It happens from youth leagues to the
pros, from the National Association for
Collegiate Athletics to Division I, and
from playground epics to epic sports

movies. Obligatory Karate Kid "Sweep
the Leg!" reference here: Put him in a
bodybag indeed!
But every time you've seen a retaliato
ry foul, every time you've been told to
"send a message" and every time you hear
a collision echo through the entire stadi
um, you've seen someone acting with in
tent to injure.
You've seen the baserunner breaking up
the double play with a cleat to the knee, the
boxer punishing a bleeding eye and the soc
cer player making the intimidating tackle.
And every coach has requested it.
So when we hear pundits asking for
Chaney's head - the story even made it
onto NPR - we can also hear the nervous
squirming of every athlete, coach and wa
terboy in the United States, because we all
could be found guilty of unnecessary
roughness.

Intimidation, fouling and contact are
all definitely a part of most sports - basket
hall. of course, included. But in the colle
giate sphere especially, there is more at
stake than just athletic gain. If Chaney was
trying to teach kids social responsibility, as
many coaches tend to do, he failed miser
ably. If he was trying to teach the referees
a lesson, which was his original intent, he
chose the worst way to do it. But if he or
ders his players to deliberately break rules
and bones alike, it's time for him to go.
Playing hard is one thing. Intimidation can
be a great part of the game. Intentional
fouls happen.
Chaney, however, embodies the worst
of what competition brings out of us. Get
him off the court.
