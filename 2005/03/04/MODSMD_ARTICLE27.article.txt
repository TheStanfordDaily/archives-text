# Men face hot Cal team
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
After a gloomy February, No. 11 Stanford
(9-6) will be happy to turn the page on the
calendar when it hosts California (10-4) this
weekend.
It's hard to be too down on yourself when
five of your six losses have come against two
of the top four teams in the nation, but those
teams also happened to be rivals - No. 4 Cal
State Fullerton and No. 2 Texas. The conso
lation is that those losses came on the road,
by a combined total of only seven runs.
But last Sunday's 8-2 defeat at the hands
of No. 23 Southern California at Sunken Di
amond left a sour taste. The Cardinal fell be
hind early and did not do much to dig them
selves out of the hole.
"It's a tough thing to do when you just
kind of go out there and sleepwalk through a
game," junior second baseman Jed Lowrie
said. "I don't think we rolled over, but it was
kind of on cruise control. We just never real
ly got anything started. I guess we're allowed
one of those games a year, and Sunday was
that game."
The loss served as a reminder that this
team is still a work in progress, unlike last
year's juggernaut, which did not lose its sixth
game until April 24. This Cardinal team is
young - no seniors get significant playing
time - and it hasn't been able to figure out
how to win in close games yet, though Satur
day's 4-3 victory over USC was an encourag
ing sign.
"I don't think we're learning how to play
close games," head coach Mark Marquess
said after Friday's loss to USC. "We haven't
done a g<x)d job in those games."
A strong series against Cal could help the
team forget about the loss to USC, but it will
not be easy. The Golden Bears have learned

from their early losses, winning nine games in
a row after dropping four of their first five.
Dave Esquer's squad is coming off
sweeps of St. Mary's last weekend and then-
No. 20 Long Beach State two weekends ago.
The team's pitching staff has allowed an
ERA of only 2.93 during the streak.
Senior Erik Dworkis, a transfer from
Gonzaga, posted a complete game on Satur
day against St. Mary's, allowing only one run
and notching 10 strikeouts. Dworkis has
been a valuable addition, picking up 26
strikeouts in 25 innings as the team's Satur
day starter this season.
Meanwhile, junior Adam Gold, the
team's top starting pitcher a season ago, has
struggled, posting a 6.08 ERA over 23 2/3 in
nings. He will match up against Stanford ju
nior Mark Romanczuk today.
Unlike the Cardinal, the Golden Bears
have fared well in close games, going 5-2 in
contests decided by two runs or fewer. They
have won two games in extra innings and
have scored the go-ahead runs in the top of
the ninth in two road games.
On offense the Bears are powered by sopho
more centerfielder Brennan Boesch, batting
.396 with three home runs, and sophomore
leftfielder Chris Errecart, who was last
week's Pacific-10 Conference player of the
week.
For the Cardinal, anything less than a
sweep would likely be a disappointment. But
if they are going to lose, it's probably better
to get the losses out of their system early in
the year. Last year's squad was so dominant
it did not have to play in many close games.
This fact may have left the team vulnerable
come playoff time.
"We're a young team experience-wise, so I
guess it's something that you have to go
through," Lowrie said of the losses. "We've
seen the lows, and it can only go up from here."

The Stanford baseball squad, which is coming off a series win over USC, will have to
mount a strong effort to break the Golden Bears' nine-game win streak.
