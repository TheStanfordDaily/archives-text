# Cougars defense smothers Cardinal
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Heading into last night's rematch
against Washington State, it seemed
unlikely that the Cardinal would score
fewer than 16 points — what the team
did in its 60-51 loss to the Cougars at
Pullman, Wash., on Dec. 31.
"It probably won't happen again,
but I can't 100 percent guarantee it,"
junior forward Matt Haryasz said after
practice Tuesday.
It's a good thing that Haryasz didn't
make that guarantee. The Cardinal
had even more trouble with the
Cougar defense this time around, scor
ing only 12 points in the first half and
losing, 59-48, at Maples Pavilion in a
game that cast more uncertainty onto
the team's NCAA Tournament hopes.
Washington State (12-14, 7-10 Pa
cific-10 Conference) kept the Cardinal
offense out of sync all night, holding
Stanford (16-11, 10-7) to a season-low
29.3 percent from the field. The Cardi
nal looked dazed throughout a first
half in which the team made more
turnovers (6) than field goals (5) and
that included scoreless droughts of
7:02 and 5:52.
Afterward, Stanford was still look
ing for answers.
"To be honest with you, I don't
have an explanation," head coach
Trent Johnson said. "They were the
aggressor from start to finish, and they
did it on our home floor. It was very
disappointing."
The Cardinal's NCAA Tourna
ment picture did not get any clearer,
either. They will probably need to beat
No. 13 Washington tomorrow to feel
comfortable about receiving a ticket to
the Big Dance. Another loss would put
extra pressure on the Cardinal head
ing into the Pac-10 Tournament.
Despite making only five of 26
shots in the first period, Stanford
found itself down by a score of only 16-
12 at halftime.

But the Cougars came out strong at
the beginning of the second half, scor
ing nine unanswered points. They kept
Stanford at bay by making 14 of 17
shots in the half after shooting only
seven of 27 in the first period.
"I had a feeling that whomever
came out with a run in the second half
would win, and that's what hap
pened," Washington State head coach
Dick Bennett said.
Stanford made a brief spurt three
minutes into the second half after
Johnson drew a technical foul when he
apparently tried to call a timeout.
After the game, Johnson said he re
ceived no explanation why the call was
made.
The beleaguered Cardinal looked
on from half court as Cougar guard
Thomas Kelati, who would finish with
14 points, made both free throws.
The team seemed to wake up
after that, attacking the basket and
scoring eight unanswered points in
1:45 to cut the deficit to 25-20. Se
nior Nick Robinson, who shot just 2-
of-12 from the field, weaved through
the defense fora layup on the first
possession.
Layups by junior guard Chris Her
nandez, who finished with 10 points
but shot only 3-of-16 from the field,
and Haryasz, who finished with a
game-high 17 points and 12 rebounds,
forced the Cougars to call a timeout.
After the timeout, sophomore
guard Fred Washington stole a pass
and went coast-to-coast for yet anoth
er layup.
But the Cougars would miss only
one shot after that point.
"I wasn't able to get in a groove, the
team wasn't able to get in a groove all
game," said senior center Rob Little,
who scored five points to go along with
11 rebounds. "That's how they play.
They get you to feel uncomfortable in
the first half, then they get you playing
too aggressively in the second half."
It was simply a very strange game.

pened," Washington State head coach
Dick Bennett said.
Stanford made a brief spurt three
minutes into the second half after
Johnson drew a technical foul when he
apparently tried to call a timeout.
After the game, Johnson said he re
ceived no explanation why the call was
made.
The beleaguered Cardinal looked
on from half court as Cougar guard
Thomas Kelati, who would finish with
14 points, made both free throws.
The team seemed to wake up
after that, attacking the basket and
scoring eight unanswered points in
1:45 to cut the deficit to 25-20. Se
nior Nick Robinson, who shot just 2-
of-12 from the field, weaved through
the defense fora layup on the first
possession.
Layups by junior guard Chris Her
nandez, who finished with 10 points
but shot only 3-of-16 from the field,
and Haryasz, who finished with a
game-high 17 points and 12 rebounds,
forced the Cougars to call a timeout.
After the timeout, sophomore
guard Fred Washington stole a pass
and went coast-to-coast for yet anoth
er layup.
But the Cougars would miss only
one shot after that point.
"I wasn't able to get in a groove, the
team wasn't able to get in a groove all
game," said senior center Rob Little,
who scored five points to go along with
11 rebounds. "That's how they play.
They get you to feel uncomfortable in
the first half, then they get you playing
too aggressively in the second half."
It was simply a very strange game.
