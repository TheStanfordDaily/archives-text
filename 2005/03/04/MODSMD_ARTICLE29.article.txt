# Wiggins named Pac-10's best
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday, what Stanford fans have known since the early
stages of this season was officially etched into the Pacific-10 Con
ference record hooks: freshman Candice Wiggins was the best
player in the conference for the 2004-05 season. Wiggins was
named both Pac-10 Freshman of the Year and Player of the Year
in an announcement from league commissioner Tom Hansen.
She is the only player in the history of the conference to cap
ture both awards in the same year and only the third woman in
NCAA history to do so.
Wiggins, the Cardinal's points leader, scored on a cut to the
basket on the first play of Stanford's exhibition season and
never looked back.
"It was a back-d00r... I was so nervous I almost missed the
lay-up," Wiggins said. "Then I heard the crowd roar, and I got
chills. I was like 'Okay, I think I'm good."'
Playing most of the season before her 18th birthday, Wiggins
has been more than good, leading the team in scoring (17.3
points per game) and steals (73). She ranks second and fourth
in the conference in those categories, respectively.
Her 73 steals also rank seventh in Stanford history fora sin
gle season.
"I'm a little shocked," Wiggins said. "I just respect this con
ference so much."
Almost in the shadow of Wiggins' breakout performance,
two other Cardinal players have put together outstanding sea
sons and were honored for their performances yesterday as well.
Senior Kelley Suminski and sophomore Brooke Smith were
named to the All-Pac-10 team along with Wiggins.
Suminski, who joins the All-Conference team for the second
time in her career, led the team with her perimeter shooting this
season, collecting 57 three-point field goals, and her 47.1 per
cent shooting from beyond the arc is fifth best in the nation.
Smith, who transferred from Duke University after her
freshman year, has found a home in the Pac-10, pacing the con
ference in field goal percentage (62.1 percent), and was seventh
in scoring (13.3 ppg).
Stanford completed its sweep of the conference awards with
head coach Tara VanDerveer's seventh Pac-10 Coach of the
Year award. In her 19th year with the Cardinal, VanDerveer's
record at Stanford is 476-119 (.800). This season will mark her
17th consecutive trip to the NCAA Tournament.
