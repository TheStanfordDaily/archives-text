# No. 13 men's tennis too much for Tribe
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Some of the matches were a little closer
than they should have been. And it might
not have been pretty. But the No. 13 Stan
ford men's tennis team got it done on
Wednesday and took the win against No. 67
William and Mary. 6-1.
"I told the guys that I wanted to see three
S's down the board yesterday [for dou
bles]," head coach John Whitlinger said. "I
was happy that we got all three wins, but I
think we can do better — I know we can
play better than that."
Since the Cardinal changed the doubles
lineup three matches ago. they have not

failed to win the doubles point.
William and Mary was set to serve first in
all three doubles matches on Wednesday.
The team managed to hold serve in the top
two doubles matches, but was broken in the
first game by Stanford's No. 3 doubles team
of sophomores Eric McKean and James
Wan.
On the middle court, senior Phil Sheng
and freshman Phil Kao worked to tally their
first win together as partners. In the final
game of the set, the Tribe duo was serving at
0-40 and then proceeded to double-fault on
match-point to give Stanford an 8-3 win.
"We are definitely getting better as a
team," Kao said.
The second-ranked pair in the nation —

Warburg and junior KC Corkery — had a
closer match than Kao and Sheng did, hut
still managed to mark a Cardinal win, 8-6.
"KC served extremely well [in the
match]," Warburg said. "It definitely set the
tone and let the other team know they have
to do a lot even to hang with us."
McKean and Wan earned a hard-fought
8-6 victory against William and Mary's
48th-ranked third doubles team of Alex Co
janu and Jeff Kader.
In singles action, the Cardinal claimed
all six of the first sets, jumping to 3-0 leads
in four of the matches.
The top singles match was a showdown
between No. 6 Warburg and No. 57
Kader. Despite some strong serving
on Kader's part and an off day lor
the Stanford player, Warburg ulti
mately prevailed 7-5,6-3.
"I think [Sam] was fighting a few
filings on the court [Wednesday],
but he played well enough to win,"
Whitlinger said. "Good players find
ways to win [even] when they're not
1(H) percent."
Warburg also said he felt he
wasn't playing his best on Wednes
day.
, "I'm pretty good friends with
[Kader] so that makes it pretty hard
when you have to play a friend,"
Warburg said. "But when I step on
the court and he steps on the court,
he's my enemy. I felt like 1 was in
tense and trying hard and wanted to
play well, but I didn't have the A
game that I can bring sometimes so it
was kind of a struggle. But luckily 1
was able to get a couple breaks here
and there."
At the second singles spot, No. 31
Corkery made quick work of his op
ponent, 6-1, 6-0. The junior began
the match with a backhand winner,
and after that, the aces and winners
came like clockwork. The All
- then came full circle with
a backhand down-the-line winner

on match-point.
At the third singles spot, Sheng
won the first set in a tiebreaker but
then lost the second, 5-7. After his
match split sets, Stanford had al
ready tallied the four points needed
to win the match and so a super
tiebreaker decided Sheng's match
and consequently gave the senior his
fifth consecutive loss.
"Phil Sheng is going to come up
big for us," Whitlinger said. "He
won seven matches in a row, but he's
had a slight losing streak. But he will
be a factor, and I have all the faith in
the world that he's going to pull
through for us. He may be on the
downer right now, but he'll be
back."
Wan defeated Cojanu, 6-2, 6-4,
for his eighth consecutive win. Since
moving to the fourth singles posi
tion. Wan has posted an undefeated
record.
The Cardinal begin play today in
the Pacific Coast Doubles tourna
ment held in La Jolla, Calif. Corkery
and Warburg are the top seed in the
tournament, which is currently in its
116 th year. In addition to the usual
three doubles teams, Stanford is also
sending junior Jon Wong and sopho
more Dave Ryan.
"The history of this tournament,
the people in this tournament and
the names on the trophy are all in
credible," Whitlinger said. "It's a
great way to end the quarter, to
work on doubles a little bit in a beau
tiful location."

team," Kao said.
The second-ranked pair in the nation —

Warburg and junior KC Corkery — had a
closer match than Kao and Sheng did, hut
still managed to mark a Cardinal win, 8-6.
"KC served extremely well [in the
match]," Warburg said. "It definitely set the
tone and let the other team know they have
to do a lot even to hang with us."
McKean and Wan earned a hard-fought
8-6 victory against William and Mary's
48th-ranked third doubles team of Alex Co
janu and Jeff Kader.
In singles action, the Cardinal claimed
all six of the first sets, jumping to 3-0 leads
in four of the matches.
The top singles match was a showdown
between No. 6 Warburg and No. 57
Kader. Despite some strong serving
on Kader's part and an off day lor
the Stanford player, Warburg ulti
mately prevailed 7-5,6-3.
"I think [Sam] was fighting a few
filings on the court [Wednesday],
but he played well enough to win,"
Whitlinger said. "Good players find
ways to win [even] when they're not
1(H) percent."
Warburg also said he felt he
wasn't playing his best on Wednes
day.
, "I'm pretty good friends with
[Kader] so that makes it pretty hard
when you have to play a friend,"
Warburg said. "But when I step on
the court and he steps on the court,
he's my enemy. I felt like 1 was in
tense and trying hard and wanted to
play well, but I didn't have the A
game that I can bring sometimes so it
was kind of a struggle. But luckily 1
was able to get a couple breaks here
and there."
At the second singles spot, No. 31
Corkery made quick work of his op
ponent, 6-1, 6-0. The junior began
the match with a backhand winner,
and after that, the aces and winners
came like clockwork. The All
- then came full circle with
a backhand down-the-line winner

on match-point.
At the third singles spot, Sheng
won the first set in a tiebreaker but
then lost the second, 5-7. After his
match split sets, Stanford had al
ready tallied the four points needed
to win the match and so a super
tiebreaker decided Sheng's match
and consequently gave the senior his
fifth consecutive loss.
"Phil Sheng is going to come up
big for us," Whitlinger said. "He
won seven matches in a row, but he's
had a slight losing streak. But he will
be a factor, and I have all the faith in
the world that he's going to pull
through for us. He may be on the
downer right now, but he'll be
back."
Wan defeated Cojanu, 6-2, 6-4,
for his eighth consecutive win. Since
moving to the fourth singles posi
tion. Wan has posted an undefeated
record.
The Cardinal begin play today in
the Pacific Coast Doubles tourna
ment held in La Jolla, Calif. Corkery
and Warburg are the top seed in the
tournament, which is currently in its
116 th year. In addition to the usual
three doubles teams, Stanford is also
sending junior Jon Wong and sopho
more Dave Ryan.
"The history of this tournament,
the people in this tournament and
the names on the trophy are all in
credible," Whitlinger said. "It's a
great way to end the quarter, to
work on doubles a little bit in a beau
tiful location."

Senior Sam Warburg prevailed in his singles and doubles matches despite
having what he described as an "off day "
Some of the matches were a little closer
than they should have been. And it might
not have been pretty. But the No. 13 Stan
ford men's tennis team got it done on
Wednesday and took the win against No. 67
William and Mary. 6-1.
"I told the guys that I wanted to see three
S's down the board yesterday [for dou
bles]," head coach John Whitlinger said. "I
was happy that we got all three wins, but I
think we can do better — I know we can
play better than that."
Since the Cardinal changed the doubles
lineup three matches ago. they have not

failed to win the doubles point.
William and Mary was set to serve first in
all three doubles matches on Wednesday.
The team managed to hold serve in the top
two doubles matches, but was broken in the
first game by Stanford's No. 3 doubles team
of sophomores Eric McKean and James
Wan.
On the middle court, senior Phil Sheng
and freshman Phil Kao worked to tally their
first win together as partners. In the final
game of the set, the Tribe duo was serving at
0-40 and then proceeded to double-fault on
match-point to give Stanford an 8-3 win.
"We are definitely getting better as a
team," Kao said.
