than they should have been. And it might
not have been pretty. But the No. 13 Stan
ford men's tennis team got it done on
Wednesday and took the win against No. 67
William and Mary. 6-1.
"I told the guys that I wanted to see three
S's down the board yesterday [for dou
bles]," head coach John Whitlinger said. "I
was happy that we got all three wins, but I
think we can do better — I know we can
play better than that."
Since the Cardinal changed the doubles
lineup three matches ago. they have not

failed to win the doubles point.
William and Mary was set to serve first in
all three doubles matches on Wednesday.

two doubles matches, but was broken in the
first game by Stanford's No. 3 doubles team
of sophomores Eric McKean and James
Wan.
On the middle court, senior Phil Sheng
and freshman Phil Kao worked to tally their
first win together as partners. In the final
game of the set, the Tribe duo was serving at
0-40 and then proceeded to double-fault on
match-point to give Stanford an 8-3 win.
"We are definitely getting better as a
team," Kao said.
The second-ranked pair in the nation —

Warburg and junior KC Corkery — had a
closer match than Kao and Sheng did, hut
still managed to mark a Cardinal win, 8-6.
"KC served extremely well [in the
match]," Warburg said. "It definitely set the
tone and let the other team know they have
to do a lot even to hang with us."
McKean and Wan earned a hard-fought
8-6 victory against William and Mary's
48th-ranked third doubles team of Alex Co
janu and Jeff Kader.
In singles action, the Cardinal claimed
all six of the first sets, jumping to 3-0 leads
