### DANIEL NOVINSON 
t After not playing a game "for nearly two weeks, the
♦omen's lacrosse team will hit the field twice this weekend.
Km iking t<) improve on its 3-ooverall record. Stanford will face
C "onnecticut and C ieorgetown in its first two home games of
the season.
"We're pretty excited to be on our field," head coach
Michelle Uhlfelder said. "We've been on the road a whole
month and it'll Ik- really nice to have some people cheering
for as instead of against us."
First on the slate is a visit from the C onnecticut 1 iuskies at
7 p.m. today. Last season, Connecticut finished 8-9 overall,
led by Tracey Mullaney's 41 goals. Mullaney enters this sea
son as a senior and a preseason All-American, so the Cardi
nal will certainly focus on stopping her.
* < "Connecticut is a really competitive team," senior mid
fielder Kelsey Twist added. "We're going to treat the games
as individual tasks — we're just looking fora really solid start
on our home turf [today] to build confidence and get the job
done on Sunday I think with a really solid win [today), the
momentum will carry over into the weekend."
The women's task will only grow tougher on Sunday,
when the unranked Cardinal will lace preseason No. 5
Georgetown at 1 p.m., in the fourth annual de Beer East/
West ( hallenge. The challenge allows West Coast teams like
the Cardinal to prove their mettle against highly rated East
Coast opponents.
"Georgetown is extremely experienced," Uhlfelder said.
"Their program has had a lot of success and they'll come into
our game with a lot of confidence. The trip is not new to them
and they know our personnel —we recruit against each
other."
"If,you just lixik at this team on paper you might think
we're having a rebuilding year, but in my four years this is the
most lit most together team we've ever had, so I'm really ex
cited to see how we fare against these top schools," Twist said
Stanford enters tonight's game having defeated its first
[three Mountain Pacific Sports Federation opponents by a
combined 44-15.
"I feel good about what were doing," I Jhlfeldersaid. "We
are able, in a game, situatii>n t< > transfer what we've practiced
every day. We're l< x »king forward to getting tested this week
end to see just h< >w g< k kI we can be."
Many Cardinal have been excelling early. Sophomore
midfielder Elizabeth Piselli and junior attacker Sarah Bach
have both notched live-goal games. With a five-assist game.
Twist broke the Stanford single-game assist mark of four, set
by I ledy Born duringthe2(XX)season. Defensively,freshman
g< nilkeeper I -aura Shane is allowing fewer than five goals per
game.
Bach, spoiling a team-leading 11 goals off 15 shots, has re
ceived MPSF Player of the Week h< mors. Twist, with only one
turnover accompanying a team-leading seven assists, e;imed
honorable mention as National Player of the Week.
"I'm proud of both of them for the difference they've
made in a year in their games," Uhlfelder said. "I'm proud
of how the team has come out from the first whistle and de
cided to get after the draw. I'm proud of their effort and
their attitude."
