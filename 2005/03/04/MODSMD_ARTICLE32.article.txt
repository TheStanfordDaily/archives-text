# Card hit SoCal tourney
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
The team has been creeping slowly up the
rankings over the last four weeks, but a No. 3
ranking for the Stanford Softball squad (16-1)
is no surprise at all. Ranked No. 6 by the USA
Today / NFCA poll at the start of the season,
the Cardinal have moved up past defending
Women's College World Series Champion
UCLA, as well as Lousiana State and Okla
homa.
Still eyeing the coveted top ranking in the
nation, the Cardinal head down to Fullerton,
Calif., this weekend to take on four formidable
opponents at the Worth Invitational.
Nevada (5-8) and Minnesota (9-6) will
meet the Cardinal for the first time this morn
ing and afternoon, respectively. Stanford faces
No. 25 Northwestern (11-4) tomorrow night.
Stanford will also play host Cal State-
Fullerton (4-5) and Boston College (6-6).
Stanford has been powered by the swing of
shortstop Lauren Lappin, who was named Pa
cific- 10 Conference Player of the Week for
her performance at the Stanford Invitational.
Batting .462 with seven runs scored and six
RBI last week bumps the junior's season av
erage to .458. Her 22 hits lead the team and the
Pac-10.
Senior catcher Leah Nelson is second on
the team with 19 hits, followed closely by ju
nior centerfielder Catalina Morris and fresh
man third baseman Michelle Smith, each with
18 hits. All three sit among the top 10 in the
league for that category. Smith and Morris
have hit seven and six home runs, respectively.
Led by junior ace Laura Severson and two

freshmen, the Cardinal pitching staff has com
piled a 1.27 ERA. By contrast, Stanford's op
ponents own an 8.03 ERA.
Severson (7-1) has handled the bulk of
the work, pitching 51 innings this season,
while freshman Lauren Nydam has picked
up five wins for Stanford. The first-year
righty, who was out with an injury the first
week in February, has held batters to a .174
batting average in 10 appearances and has
already pitched her first complete game of
her collegiate career.
With the offense, defense and the pitching
at full force so early in the season, head coach
John Rittman's current lineup and rotation
should find more success at Fullerton.
Northwestern poses the biggest threat to
Stanford's winning ways this weekend. The
Wildcats have defeated three ranked oppo
nents and gave top-ranked Arizona its biggest
scare of the season, though Northwestern
ended up falling 4-3 in eight innings.
Either Eileen Canney or Courtney Foster,
who gave up one run in 21 innings pitched for
a .033 ERA with 31 strikeouts last weekend,
will stand in the circle for Northwestern to
morrow. Two Wildcats — Garland Cooper
and Stephanie Churchwell — also have aver
ages well over the .300 mark (.365 and .390, re
spectively).
Following this road trip the Cardinal have
the next week off. Stanford comes back home
to play March 25 and 26 fora short round
robin.
And if that No. 3 isn't next to its name by
the time the Stanford team returns home —
well, it might be because the team has moved
higher.
