# Tennis takes on AZ schools
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
The top-ranked Stanford women's tennis team
(10-0,3-0 Pacific-10 Conference) continues its un
defeated campaign this weekend, facing off
against No. 48 Arizona (5-3,0-1) and No. 27 Ari
zona State (3-1,1-0).
History is not on either opponent's side.
In 2004, the No. 1 Cardinal downed Arizona
twice, 6-1 and 7-0. Stanford sacrificed one match
because of an injury.
The year before, Stanford tamed the Wildcats
with a pair of 6-1 victories.
In fact, a distant 1987 marks the first and last
year Arizona has edged out Stanford, 5-4.
Arizona State, on the other hand, has yet to
notch a win against the Cardinal.
Backed by the overwhelmingly positive past
results, the 2005 Stanford squad appears even
more formidable, boasting seven ranked singles
players and two ranked doubles teams. Erin Bur
dette, a senior, leads the way at No. 14, while
sophomore Anne Yelsey rounds out the lineup at
No. 94.
That said, the team's biggest problem might
just be having a wealth of talent fora limited num
ber of spots. Even Alice Barnes, a junior who com
petes in the high-stakes No. 2 singles slot, sat out
last weekend against No. 12 Southern California
to give two accomplished freshmen. No. 30 Whit
ney Deason (15-3, 3-0) and No. 24 Lejla Hodzic
(14-2,3-0), a chance to compete.
"We have so much talent on this team, every
one's going to get their time to shine," Deason
said.

Dividing her time between Nos. 4 and 5 singles,
Deason closed out two stellar matches in a chal
lenging double-header against UCLA and the
Women of Troy. The Houston native handed the
Bruins' Laura Gordon (10-7) a straight-set loss, 6-
2,6-2, before breaking No. 87 Dianne Mafias' (18-
6) six-match winning streak. 6-4,6-1.
In the No. 6 singles spot, Hodzic unseated the
Trojans' Judy DeVera (7-8), 6-1,7-5.
Depending on who rotates out this weekend,
Deason could take on Arizona's Kelly Perry (12-
6) and the Sun Devils' Kady Pooler (7-8), whom
she soundly defeated at the Thunderbird Colle
giate Invitational last November, 6-2,6-4.
Waiting for Hodzic would be Arizona's Camel
lia Todorova (13-13) and Lauren Colalillo of Ari
zona State (10-7).
Arizona remains one of the weaker teams in
the conference, ahead of only No. 75 Washington
State in rankings.
Meanwhile, No. 27 Arizona State made a huge
leap from No. 37 after opening conference com
petition on Saturday with a 7-0 sweep of Oregon.
Doubles against Arizona State will be a crucial
point of contention on Saturday. While Stanford's
top doubles tandem of Burdette and Barnes (14-3,
2-1) checks in at No. 10 in the nation, the Sun Dev
ils' Colalillo and Pooler showed the Ducks they're a
force to be reckoned with, despite being unranked.
Colalillo and Pooler upset the No. 15 duo of
Dominika Dieskova and Daria Panova (14-5,2-2),
8-4.
Match play begins against Arizona today at
1:30 p.m., at Lanelle Robson Tennis Center. The
Cardinal will face Arizona State tomorrow at
noon, at Whiteman Tennis Center.
