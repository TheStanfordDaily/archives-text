# Women get rematch with No. 4 LBSU
## 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If frequent-driver miles existed, the members of
the women's water polo team (9-2,2-0 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) would be racking them up.
This weekend will be the second consecutive week
end the Cardinal spend in Southern California, as
they take on MPSF rivals No. 13 UC-Irvine and No.
4 Long Beach State.
The Cardinal head south today, less than five
days after returning from their third-place finish in
the UC-Santa Barbara-hosted 2005 Daktronics
Gaucho Invitational. Their performance in the tour
nament did not result in the first-place finish that
Stanford had hoped it would, but it still contained
plenty of positives.
Aside from a sub-par second half showing in their
semi-final match against No. 2 Southern California,
the Cardinal clearly demonstrated their ability to
compete at the highest level. They swept their group,
posting dominant victories over Pacific and No. IS
I JC-San Diego by scores of 17-5 and 11 -3, respective
ly. They cruised through their quarter-final match
against No. 11 San Jose State, shutting down the Spar
tan offense in a 9-1 win. After dropping their match to
the Women of Troy, 9-4, the Cardinal recovered ad
mirably to defeat Long Beach State. 5-3, in the tour
nament's third-place game the following day.
"We went into the weekend planning to take
first, but the results haven't deterred us at all in

our plans for the future," senior captain Hannah
Luber said. "If anything, it's brought us even
more together as a team, making us excited to be
able to prove ourselves and show what we're
made of after the challenges and frustrations of
last weekend."
The Cardinal's matches this weekend offer
them two opportunities to do so in conference
competition. On Saturday, the Stanford women
take on an Anteaters squad that jumped from
16th to 13th in the National Collegiate Women's
Top 20 Poll rankings by placing 13th out of 23
teams at the Gaucho Invitational. Despite the
Anteaters' rank, the Cardinal approach the game
just like any other.
"We play a game at a time, trying not to look
ahead or dwell on the past too much," Luber said.
After their Saturday date against UC-Irvine, the
Cardinal look forward to their rematch with the
49ers Sunday afternoon. And after the result of their
first meeting this season, the Cardinal have the psy
chological edge.
"Playing and beating Long Beach was a success
and something to be proud of. Having already
played against and beaten them at Santa Barbara
will be an advantage to us," Luber said.
Luber was the offensive star of the Cardinal's vic
tory over the 49ers last weekend. She notched three
goals in the game, two of them coming in the second
half to put Stanford on top to stay. But perhaps the crit
ical element of the Cardinal's victory was their ability

to hold Long Beach State scoreless the entire second
half and for three out of the game's four periods.
"The key was our communication and quickness
on defense, and Meridith [McColl] stepping up big
time," said junior driver Laurel Champion.
McColl, the Cardinal's sophomore goalie,
recorded 10 saves in the game to bring her season
total to 74 out of 118 chances. Her 4.(X) goals against
average ranks her second in the nation.
But her statistical credits don't do justice to the
job that McColl performs in the Stanford net. Any
pass into the 2-meter not accurately placed is likely
to be stolen and swiftly turned into a counter-attack
outlet pass by the Mission Viejo, Calif, sophomore.
McColl picked up the assist on the Cardinal's first
goal of their Long Beach State match, sending an
outlet pass to a breaking Champion who took it all
the way to the 49er goal to bury a backhand.
"Meridith has developed significantly as a goalie
and is the anchor for our defense," said head coach
John Tanner.
In Stanford's numerous blowout wins this season,
McColl has not had many opportunities for glory.
But in closely contested battles such as last Sunday s
match against Long Beach State, her value as a di
versely talented netminder is clear for all to see.
And as the Cardinal continue their pursuit of an
NC A A title this weekend and over the remainder of
their season, they will Uxik to McColl to provide the
consistent and stabilizing last line of defense that no
championship-caliber team can be without.

days after returning from their third-place finish in
the UC-Santa Barbara-hosted 2005 Daktronics
Gaucho Invitational. Their performance in the tour
nament did not result in the first-place finish that
Stanford had hoped it would, but it still contained
plenty of positives.
Aside from a sub-par second half showing in their
semi-final match against No. 2 Southern California,
the Cardinal clearly demonstrated their ability to
compete at the highest level. They swept their group,
posting dominant victories over Pacific and No. IS
I JC-San Diego by scores of 17-5 and 11 -3, respective
ly. They cruised through their quarter-final match
against No. 11 San Jose State, shutting down the Spar
tan offense in a 9-1 win. After dropping their match to
the Women of Troy, 9-4, the Cardinal recovered ad
mirably to defeat Long Beach State. 5-3, in the tour
nament's third-place game the following day.
"We went into the weekend planning to take
first, but the results haven't deterred us at all in

our plans for the future," senior captain Hannah
Luber said. "If anything, it's brought us even
more together as a team, making us excited to be
able to prove ourselves and show what we're
made of after the challenges and frustrations of
last weekend."
The Cardinal's matches this weekend offer
them two opportunities to do so in conference
competition. On Saturday, the Stanford women
take on an Anteaters squad that jumped from
16th to 13th in the National Collegiate Women's
Top 20 Poll rankings by placing 13th out of 23
teams at the Gaucho Invitational. Despite the
Anteaters' rank, the Cardinal approach the game
just like any other.
"We play a game at a time, trying not to look
ahead or dwell on the past too much," Luber said.
After their Saturday date against UC-Irvine, the
Cardinal look forward to their rematch with the
49ers Sunday afternoon. And after the result of their
first meeting this season, the Cardinal have the psy
chological edge.
"Playing and beating Long Beach was a success
and something to be proud of. Having already
played against and beaten them at Santa Barbara
will be an advantage to us," Luber said.
Luber was the offensive star of the Cardinal's vic
tory over the 49ers last weekend. She notched three
goals in the game, two of them coming in the second
half to put Stanford on top to stay. But perhaps the crit
ical element of the Cardinal's victory was their ability

to hold Long Beach State scoreless the entire second
half and for three out of the game's four periods.
"The key was our communication and quickness
on defense, and Meridith [McColl] stepping up big
time," said junior driver Laurel Champion.
McColl, the Cardinal's sophomore goalie,
recorded 10 saves in the game to bring her season
total to 74 out of 118 chances. Her 4.(X) goals against
average ranks her second in the nation.
But her statistical credits don't do justice to the
job that McColl performs in the Stanford net. Any
pass into the 2-meter not accurately placed is likely
to be stolen and swiftly turned into a counter-attack
outlet pass by the Mission Viejo, Calif, sophomore.
McColl picked up the assist on the Cardinal's first
goal of their Long Beach State match, sending an
outlet pass to a breaking Champion who took it all
the way to the 49er goal to bury a backhand.
"Meridith has developed significantly as a goalie
and is the anchor for our defense," said head coach
John Tanner.
In Stanford's numerous blowout wins this season,
McColl has not had many opportunities for glory.
But in closely contested battles such as last Sunday s
match against Long Beach State, her value as a di
versely talented netminder is clear for all to see.
And as the Cardinal continue their pursuit of an
NC A A title this weekend and over the remainder of
their season, they will Uxik to McColl to provide the
consistent and stabilizing last line of defense that no
championship-caliber team can be without.
