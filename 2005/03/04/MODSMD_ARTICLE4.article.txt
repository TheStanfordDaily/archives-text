# Evaluations online
## Course Guide revamped 
### SHIRIN SHARIF MANAGING EDITOR 
When filling out course evaluations at
the end of the quarter, you may want to
think twice about ignoring that space for
comments at the bottom of the form.
What you write there will be the biggest
help to other students; these comments are
posted on the ASSU Course Guide — a
free resource for students to look up sum
maries and ratings for classes.
While the Course Guide has been noto
rious in past years for providing incomplete
and outdated information, the students in
charge said they are making a greater effort
to enter comments into the database in a
more timely fashion, especially as they pre
pare fora brand new system that will allow
students to write their comments online in
stead of on paper forms.
The Course Guide staff has recruited the
assistance of members of the Cap and
Gown women's honor society who are do
nating the money they make working for
the guide to their group. Also, the Tau Beta
Pi engineering honors society enters com
ments from engineering classes.
The staff spent the summer catching up
on entering comments, and evaluations
from this past fall's classes were entered
into the system last weekend.
Yet while the staff is updating the Web
site more frequently. Course Guide
Director Curtis Spencer, a graduate
student in computer science, said he
sees larger problems in the frame
work of the Course Guide.
Spencer said that most students
never write any comments in their
course evaluations, especially since
the number of students attending
the final classes "usually tapers off
due to stress associated with finals."
In addition, many courses are tele
vised and students don't make an ef
fort to come to the final class.
* "There needs to be a way to en
courage more students to fill out
comments," Spencer said.
The Course Guide staff is trying
to engineer the system to resemble
the one used by Stanford Dining,
Residential Education and Under
graduate Advising. These groups
entice students to fill out their sur
veys with gift certificates and other

prizes.
"[The prizes are] a small price to
pay for the huge increase in the
number of comments they receive,"
Spencer said. "In addition, an online
system eliminates the problems as
sociated with manual data entry
such as human error, sorting and
costs."
Work on the new system is set to
begin early next quarter and the
staff's goal is to have it up and run
ning by the end of fall quarter.
But members of the staff will
need some help from Axess coordi
nators to post the course evalua
tions online. That way, only stu
dents registered for classes can com
ment on them. The current paper
to-Web system requires an over
whelming amount of time and effort
from the Course Guide staffers, who
are compensated $14 per hour for
their work.
The staff receives multiple boxes
of course comment slips, and each
box requires approximately 40
hours of work to sort, read and type
the comments into the database.
However, because students often

do not fill out the forms completely,
there are bundles of blank slips and
many classes go unrepresented in
guide.
"It doesn't make sense to enter
one comment fora class — it would
be a very biased comment and
would not appropriately represent
the course in most cases," said
sophomore Aditi Iyer, the chief fi
nancial officer. "Unfortunately, we
lack comments more often than not,
[which is) another reason Course
Guide is not up-to-date much of the
time."
The Course Guide relies solely
on these comment slips and does not
receive the numerical ratings based
what students bubble-in about pro
fessors and class content.
"1 guess the main incentive to
write a short comment is knowing
that you might want to look on
Course Guide someday and that
you would like it to actually have
constructive comments about the
classes you are interested in," Iyer
said.
Similar course feedback re
sources exist at other universities.

including the University of Califor
nia, Harvard and the University of
Pennsylvania. While the Stanford
administration has not played a di
rect role in ensuring a quality
Course Guide, they do support the
effort the students' effort to create
one.
"The Registrar's Office provides
information to the ASSU regarding
evaluations," said University Regis
trar Roger Printup. "It is the
ASSU's responsibility to then pub
lish the Guide. The Faculty Senate
has supported the provision of
course evaluation data to the ASSU
for the purpose of producing the
Guide."
Even so, some students said they
have lost faith in the Course Guide
as a valuable resource.
"I checked the Course Guide at
the beginning of fall quarter and it
wasn't updated at all," said sopho
more Johan Surani. "The comments
were backlogged from a few years
ago. But the guide was still pretty
useful for providing more personal
information about the professors'
teaching styles."
