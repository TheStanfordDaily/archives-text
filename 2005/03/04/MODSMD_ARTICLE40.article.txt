# Communism falls to pirates; free markets re-established
## 
### SCOOP SCOOPERSTEIN SENIOR STAFF REPORTER 
It was a grim day for communism.
Il was a glorious day for capitalism
... and pirates.
At approximately 2:37 a.m. PST
yesterday morning, the state govern
ing body of Commumission fell to an

invading force of pro-free-market pi
rates. While rumors had circled about
the Storke Publications Building for
weeks of an imminent rising, the sud
den incursion took both the leaders of
Commumission and the world com
munity by surprise.
There were conflicting reports as
to whether the Commumission party
chairs, Tam Vo and Brendan Marten,
had survived the attack, with several
anonymous individuals reporting that
they had seen the two suspended
from the mast of a pirate ship in the
San Francisco Bay. Others sources as

sorted that the party chairs had es
caped and were in hiding somewhere
on the UC-Berkeley campus.
A holdout Commumissionary in
fantry brigade, which remained barri
caded in the I .aIR at Tresidder Union
as of press time, reported that Deputy
Party Chair Sam Tanzer had suffered
a cutlass wound hut was currently
under its protection.
As soon as the pirates converged
on the Storke Publications Building
early Thursday morning, they
launched a surprise offensive from the
north side of the structure. Once they
had broken through Commumission's
perimeter defenses, they began raping

and pillaging at will.
Pirates were seen
running from the scene
with Gss and file cabi
nets in hand. (Except
for one file cabinet,
which was still really,
really heavy.)
Daily staffers were
alarmed at the proximi
ty of the conflict to their
work stations.
"The pirates went

straight through our office space to
get to Intermission," said Sports Edi
tor Jess Peters, a junior. "1 feel like
we're Belgium or something."
Volume 226 Editor in Chief Will
Oremus, however, expressed relief at
the damage that the pirates wrought

on The Daily's office.
"I'm just glad that someone finally
left the office in a worse state than it
was at the end of my volume after
Banquet," he said.
Upon installing themselves as the
supreme source of governmental au
thority for the newly capitalistic state
of Intermission, the pirates issued a
curt statement to the outside world.
"Yarg," the document read. "We be
in charge here now. Pieces of eight and
private property rights for all ye mates."
Numerous Intermission staffers
voiced concern about the future of
their publication under the new pi
rate-led regime. In particular, many

were concerned that certain proposed
construction projects would not be
completed
"What about the loft?" asked Lay
out Editor Caley Anderson, a fresh
man. "I'm not sure if there is enough
room now fora loft and those two pi
rates on the couch."
Toward the end of the hectic and
bloody day. current Editor in Chief
Cynthia Cho took a moment to reflect
on the implications of the recent polit
ical developments.
"On the one hand, it's going to
suck having to share an office with pi
rates," she said. "But on the other
hand, they'll come in handy when 1
need help enforcing deadline."
A phone call to the pirates'
headquarters was not immediately
returned.
