# Calling for a new Stanford mascot
## 
### DARREN FRANICH INTERMISSION MUCKRAKER 
A long time ago, we were the
Stanford Indians. It was not a
particularly original mascot and
it wasn't particularly exciting.
More importantly, it was not a
particularly politically correct
mascot. And so, on one golden
afternoon some three decades
ago, the Stanford student body
readied itself fora new era. What
would we be?
Possible mascots were handed
to the administration by the stu
dents, and each possibility was re
markably unique: the Thunder
Chickens! The Railsplitters! The
Drunken Welshmen! Finally, a
front-runner emerged: the Rob
ber Barons, a name infused with
the dynamic spirit and colorful
history of our university's founder
and his heartless plutocrat
brethren.
The University considered the
mascot problem mightily, and, in
its awful majesty, refused every
possibility which remotely ap
proached fun. Instead, they opted
to make our mascot... the color
"Cardinal"! Apparently this was
done to simulate the Crimson of
Harvard, a University well
known for its excessive
douchebaggery. Except that
"Crimson" rolls off the tongue
like a dynamite lollipop, whereas
"Cardinal" confusingly ties the
University to a boring species of
bird and an even more boring
species of elderly Catholic priest
administrator.
Let's not obscure the issue: I'm
a die-hard Cardinal fan. I just hate
the name "Cardinal." It doesn't
lend itself to any fun chants. It re
moves the possibility of having an
actual mascot (I love the Tree, but

he's a genial prankster, and we
need a hyped-up crowd pleaser).
Worst of all, it's incredibly bland,
especially considering how fantas
tically weird and idiosyncratic we
are here at Stanford.
Brothers! Sisters! And all the
rest of you! No longer will we
stand for this debased, bureau
cratic mascotry! To celebrate our
Pirate issue, we're kicking off a
massive, epoch-defining cam
paign to become what, deep
down, we always have been: Rob
ber Barons.
First, a note from our associ
ates at Dictionary.com:
robber baron: (n.) 1. One of the
American industrial or financial
magnates of the late 19th century
who became wealthy by unethical
means, such as questionable
stock-market operations and ex
ploitation of labor. 2. A feudal
lord who robbed travelers passing
through his domain.
Good things about the New
Name:
1) It's catchy. Say it to yourself
a few times. Robber Barons. Rob
ber Barons.
2) Like all cool mascots, it's
two-worded (Fighting Irish, Sun
Devils).
3) Most people don't know
what robber barons are. The mys
tique will surely attract national
attention.
4) No other school on the face
of the earth is named the Robber
Barons.
5) It's completely PC. The only
people it could possibly offend
have been dead since the Gilded
Age. And, as the talking skull
says, "Dead Men Tell No Tales"
and cannot sue.
To arms, my corsair comrades
— Justice and cool nomenclature
will win out in the end!
