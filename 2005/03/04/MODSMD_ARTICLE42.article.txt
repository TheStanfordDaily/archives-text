When you really think about it,

booty. That's right, I managed
to write "seamen" and

"booty" in the same sen
tence —go me. Think
about it: "Hook," "Pirates
of the Caribbean." "For-

rest Gump" and"Million
Dollar Baby" — all Pi-

rate movies at their
core. In "Be Cool."
cap'n Chili Palmer
(John Travolta) battles

a horde of scurvy lads for
the rights to Christina Mil-

ian's bountiful booty (you

know damn-well that pun was intended). Alas. Inter
mission landlubbers though it brims with talent up
the proverbial wazotl "Be Cool" is tepid, at best
1.995's "Get Short Palmer as a super suave shy
lock collecting a gamMm debt while honing his skills as
a movie producer. Ironically, this sequel commences
with a Hollywood Palmer skipping out on the
movie biz to pursue a new challenge in music arena. Alas,
just as Palmer's voca|onal epiphany comes to light, he

finds his 'diamond in the rough' pet project in the form of
Linda Moon (Christina Milian). But before Palmer can
get Milian to 'dip it low' under his management, he must
liberate her from her current bottom-feeding record pro
ducers. This sleazy ensemble includes Harvey Keitel and
his partner / figurative parrot, Raji. As Raji, Vince
Vaughn invokes the mythic aura and wannabe black ver
nacular of Jamie Kennedy in "Malibu's Most Wanted"
or a post-N*Sync Justin Timberlake (whichever's fun
nier). But as rib-tickling as it is to hear Vaughn yell
"Twinkle, twinkle! BIOTCH!" even Hallmark-worthy
terms of endearment like BIOTCH lose their luster the
fifteenth time or so.

Okay, I never thought I would even fathom
this let alone write it publicly, hut here goes. The
Rock clearly steals this movie — yes the one who
spent the late 90s urging everyone to get a whiff
of what he was cooking (hint: it was usually
whoop-ass). The Rock plays Vaughn's obligato
ry muscle man, Elliot — but there's a catch: he's
an aspiring actor/western singer who secretly
likes to wrestle with scantily clad men ... for en-

tirely different reasons, if you catch my drift. "Be
Cool" hits its high notes as the Rock gleefully slaps his
tuckus while admiring himself in a suit in the mirror,
faithfully reenacting a riveting female monologue
from "Bring it On."
Uma Thurman, the tale's damsel in distress, plays the
newly widowed Edie Athens who "partners" with
Palmer in the recording studio... and, you guessed it, in
bed. Fans hoping to see Thurman and Travolta rekindle *
their chemistry from Pulp Fiction will be duly disap
pointed. In lieu of an effervescent twist sequence in a

50s diner, they take part in a lazy pseudo-freak dance at
... a Black Eyed Peas performance. Edie is pretty
much devoid of personality — she's there to swoon
over Travolta and commits to little else.
In many respects, "Be Cool" comes off like a "Get
Shorty" Mad Lib gone horribly lame. But the biggest
problem 1 had with "Be Cool" is that it really reflects
nothing about the music industry itself. "Get Shorty"
satirized the inner workings of Hollywood films
through Palmer's meteoric rise to prominence using
brute tactics. Palmer's ability to effortlessly con his
way into the movies entertainingly indicted the film
industry as little more than petty crime operation. Yet

Be Cool' I] J
Dir. F. Gray Gray

"Be Cool" plays into rapper
and urban lifestyle stereo
types without the slightest ex
ploration of what really goes
into making a music star. I'm
not asking for "Making the
Band" here, but ANY unique
insight to how the industry op
erates would uphold the spirit

of the original film. Failing that, "Be Cool" adds little
to the wit of "Get Shorty" — it's nothing but a cheap
knockoff.
So prospective viewers beware: sail your viewing
dollars far away from this land-locked journey. I
don't blame you if you'd prefer to watch the Rock
suggestively describe sucking the meat clean off a
drumstick to Vin Diesel bottle-feeding infants. But if
you want to experience a true pirate's journey this
weekend, your choice is clear: "Diary of an Angry
Black Woman" all the way!"
