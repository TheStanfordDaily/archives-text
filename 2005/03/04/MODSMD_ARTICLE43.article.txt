# Vin Diesel on a trike — and that's about it
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION BUCCANEER 
My last trip to the movie theater
swallowed me whole, pummeled me
in the guts and knocked me senseless
before spitting me out and making its
way to the Oscar podium. This was. of
course, "Million Dollar Baby," How
ever. my next trip gave me quite adit-

ferent feeling in my
gut. If the word "nau
seating" doesn't
mean anything to
you yet, it might after
the Vin Diesel-dri
ven Disney vehicle,
"The Pacifier."
You have to
admit that the idea

to put Vin Diesel in a Disney movie
seems inherently funny — in a pseu
do-masochistic sort of way. Just the
phrase "like Vin Diesel in a Disney
movie" has a sort of oxymoronic ring

to it. But actually going through with
it is an entirely different matter.
When a professor working on a
highly top-secret project for the de
fense department gets kidnapped,
it's up to Lieutenant Shane Wolfe
(Vin Diesel) and his team of Navy
to rescue him. Cue the jet
skis, helicopters, and numerous back
tlips. But just when we think that the

professor (Tate Dono
van) has been saved, a
stray bullet finds him
and lands Shane in a sit
uation he never bar
gained for — taking
care of the professor's
family.
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

"It's only logical for the defense de
partment to have a Navy SEAL
move in with the professor's family
in order to take care of them. 1
mean, their lives could be in dan

ger." Okay, so maybe in a straight
up action movie their lives could le
gitimately be in danger, but this is a
Disney-family-action movie. That
can only mean that Shane will be
doing diaper-duty with the profes
sor's five kids and their whacked
out Eastern European nanny (Carol
Kane).
"The Pacifier" plays out as a
mediocre rough-draft of a family
film. The family's mother (Faith
Ford) is shipped off immediately to
Switzerland to get an unknown item
from a safety deposit box/ and
Shane is left to raise Lulu. Zoe, Seth,
Peter, and Tyler — and of course
each child has its own set of Disney
worthy problems. As Shane gets in
volved with the kids and their
school, the film rapidly moves from
"rather stupid" to "implausibly
ridiculous." And the scenes involv
ing the school's vice principal (Brad
Garrett) are enough to make you

want to smack somebody — proba
bly him, if you had the chance.
The main problem with "The Paci
fier" is that it can't balance its sense of
reality with a genuine kitsch. Vin
Diesel in a minivan can be funny. Vin
Diesel singing bedtime lullabies can be
painful. While there are some funny
moments — or maybe just one (when
the youngest daughter asks a large
chested Diesel why he has boobs),
"The Pacifier" doesn't really offer
anything that is new, unpredictable, or
that we haven't seen before. Even the
whole idea of putting an "action" star
in a "family" setting, and waiting for
hilarity to ensue has been done —
we've all seen "Kindergarten Cop."
Until Hollywood dreams up a
better way to make family films
more appealing, I'm going to have to
stick with watching Oscar winners.
So while I break out my Pepto
Bismol, you might want to make it a
Blockbuster night.
