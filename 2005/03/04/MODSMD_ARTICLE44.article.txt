# The 						top 10 pirate flicks of all time
## 
### DARREN FRANICH INTERMISSION PIRATE ENTHUSIAST 
"These motion pictures, they're
all right, but what they really need
are more pirates," Ernest Heming
way once said (maybe), and he was
right. Despite being the coolest peo
ple in the history of modem man, Pi
rates have been all but ignored by
the movies. In the entire century
plus-change history of the cinema,
the list of genuine Pirate movies is
unbelievably short. And most of
them are pretty awful. And by "pret
ty awful," we here at Intermission
mean "totally awesome."
10) "BlackbeardN Ghost"
The new track coach at an under
performing college is visited by the
ghost of infamous buccaneer Black
beard, who's been cursed to eternal
undeath until he can perform a self
less act. Naturally, he uses his phan
tom powers to help the team win the
Big Track Meet. Insert snarky com
ment here.
9) "The Meaning of Life"
Monty Python's last feature film
begins with an extended sketch that
follows a bunch elderly worker
drones rebelling against their capi
talistic overlords. After the coup,
they embark on a pirate career in
their ship, which is actually (AB
SURDITY ALERT!) their office
building. Talk about corporate
piracy!
8) "Dodgeball"
If you doubt that every movie
would be better with a pirate, look
no further than this lunny-stupid
sports flick. By itself, "Dodgeball"
is a pleasantly obnoxious fratboy
riff on the "Mighty Ducks" formula
(team of losers + impossible odds x
interpersonal problems = FUN).
But with the presence of Steve the
inexplicable Pirate, "Dodgeball"
becomes a sly parable of the inner
emotional journey of the Bucca
neer in modern times. Sort of like
"Citizen Kane," except with Chuck
Norris.
7) "Cutthroat Island"
One of the great awesomely bad
movies of the 90s. Features Geena
Davis as a swashbuckling femme fa
tale and Frank Langella as her evil
nemesis, whose name, according to
IMDB, is "Dawg." FUN FACT:
Ruined everyone's careers.
6) "Muppet Treasure Island"
Peek inside the mind of the modern
studio head: "Everyone loves 'Trea

sure Island.' Everyone loves the
Muppets. This is a brilliant idea!"
5) "Peter Pan" and "Hook"
Let's get this straight: "Peter Pan,"
whether animated by Disney or
overacted by Robin Williams, is
the most annoying character in all
of children's cinema. He's the ar
chetypal bratty young cousin,
hyped up on ADD fueled by a ram
pant soda addiction. Captain Hook
remains the coolest singing pirate
of all time.
4) "The Life Aquatic with Steve
Zissou"
For the first hour, Wes Anderson's
latest is a meandering minor gem.
Then a group of Filipino pirates who
look like the Village People attack,
and the film gets supercharged with
high seas skullduggery. Their aban
doned-hotel hideout is the coolest
dank-chic island getaway in record
ed history.
3) "Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas"
Replace "pirate" with "cynical
drugged-out hipster" and "sailing
the high seas" with "cruising down
the Strip on acid," and you have the
only Pirate movie set in the middle
of the desert. Johnny Depp's swishy
swashbuckling begins here.
2) "The Swiss Family Robinson"
In which the age-old conflict be
tween shipwrecked Swiss families
and ethnically-ambiguous sea dogs
reaches its senses-shattering conclu
sion. Hold your breath for the final
battle, when the titular Robinsons
hold off an entire Pirate army with a
dynamite combo of luck, pluck and
tigers.
1) "Pirates of the Caribbean: The
Curse of the Black Pearl"
The plot is thin. The dialogue is
gnarly. The special effects are car
toonish at best. So thank ye gods for
Johnny Depp. His Captain Jack
Sparrow hovers above the movie's
kiddish silliness with a vicious grin
and a comic wink. And so, what
could have been a "Haunted Man
sion"-esque disaster instead became
the ultimate exercise in Pirate cool,
savvy?
Editor's Note: First Mote Franich
forgot to mention the seminal pirate
movie of our generation, the 1985
classic, "Goonies." He will be sum
marily forced to walk the plank. So to
make up for for the classic
"Goonies" treasure hunt he so
thoughtlessly neglected to mention,
Intermission brings you...

gnarly. The special effects are car
toonish at best. So thank ye gods for
Johnny Depp. His Captain Jack
Sparrow hovers above the movie's
kiddish silliness with a vicious grin
and a comic wink. And so, what
could have been a "Haunted Man
sion"-esque disaster instead became
the ultimate exercise in Pirate cool,
savvy?

Intermission brings you...
"These motion pictures, they're
all right, but what they really need
are more pirates," Ernest Heming
way once said (maybe), and he was
right. Despite being the coolest peo
ple in the history of modem man, Pi
rates have been all but ignored by
the movies. In the entire century
plus-change history of the cinema,
the list of genuine Pirate movies is
unbelievably short. And most of
them are pretty awful. And by "pret
ty awful," we here at Intermission
mean "totally awesome."
10) "BlackbeardN Ghost"
The new track coach at an under
performing college is visited by the
ghost of infamous buccaneer Black
beard, who's been cursed to eternal
undeath until he can perform a self
less act. Naturally, he uses his phan
tom powers to help the team win the
Big Track Meet. Insert snarky com
ment here.
9) "The Meaning of Life"
Monty Python's last feature film
begins with an extended sketch that
follows a bunch elderly worker
drones rebelling against their capi
talistic overlords. After the coup,
they embark on a pirate career in
their ship, which is actually (AB
SURDITY ALERT!) their office
building. Talk about corporate
piracy!
8) "Dodgeball"
If you doubt that every movie
would be better with a pirate, look
no further than this lunny-stupid
sports flick. By itself, "Dodgeball"
is a pleasantly obnoxious fratboy
riff on the "Mighty Ducks" formula
(team of losers + impossible odds x
interpersonal problems = FUN).
But with the presence of Steve the
inexplicable Pirate, "Dodgeball"
becomes a sly parable of the inner
emotional journey of the Bucca
neer in modern times. Sort of like
"Citizen Kane," except with Chuck
Norris.
7) "Cutthroat Island"
One of the great awesomely bad
movies of the 90s. Features Geena
Davis as a swashbuckling femme fa
tale and Frank Langella as her evil
nemesis, whose name, according to
IMDB, is "Dawg." FUN FACT:
Ruined everyone's careers.
6) "Muppet Treasure Island"
Peek inside the mind of the modern
studio head: "Everyone loves 'Trea

sure Island.' Everyone loves the
Muppets. This is a brilliant idea!"
5) "Peter Pan" and "Hook"
Let's get this straight: "Peter Pan,"
whether animated by Disney or
overacted by Robin Williams, is
the most annoying character in all
of children's cinema. He's the ar
chetypal bratty young cousin,
hyped up on ADD fueled by a ram
pant soda addiction. Captain Hook
remains the coolest singing pirate
of all time.
4) "The Life Aquatic with Steve
Zissou"
For the first hour, Wes Anderson's
latest is a meandering minor gem.
Then a group of Filipino pirates who
look like the Village People attack,
and the film gets supercharged with
high seas skullduggery. Their aban
doned-hotel hideout is the coolest
dank-chic island getaway in record
ed history.
3) "Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas"
Replace "pirate" with "cynical
drugged-out hipster" and "sailing
the high seas" with "cruising down
the Strip on acid," and you have the
only Pirate movie set in the middle
of the desert. Johnny Depp's swishy
swashbuckling begins here.
2) "The Swiss Family Robinson"
In which the age-old conflict be
tween shipwrecked Swiss families
and ethnically-ambiguous sea dogs
reaches its senses-shattering conclu
sion. Hold your breath for the final
battle, when the titular Robinsons
hold off an entire Pirate army with a
dynamite combo of luck, pluck and
tigers.
1) "Pirates of the Caribbean: The
Curse of the Black Pearl"
The plot is thin. The dialogue is
gnarly. The special effects are car
toonish at best. So thank ye gods for
Johnny Depp. His Captain Jack
Sparrow hovers above the movie's
kiddish silliness with a vicious grin
and a comic wink. And so, what
could have been a "Haunted Man
sion"-esque disaster instead became
the ultimate exercise in Pirate cool,
savvy?
