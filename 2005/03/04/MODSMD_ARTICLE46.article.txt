## Captain Morgan: Calvin Klein of the high seas 
### TAM VO FASHIONABLE FIRST MATE 
Fashion often makes us want to walk the
plank. Whether you end up looking like a blind
Ringling Brothers circus reject or like you're
ready to twirl your way into a ballet class led by
Jane Fonda, The Ship of Good Taste left Stan
ford a long time ago. Unfortunately, we're still
left with the Uggs-and-miniskirt-velour-track
suit-loving landlubbers. Surrender now, or
Hoggings will continue until morale and style
improve.
Stay abreast of the high seas: Who doesn't
look good in a corset? (Don't answer that.)
Buoyant cleavage is never out of style, especial
ly when you have to jump ship. Choose from
lace, brocade, leather and shiny vinyl, among
other fabrics. Prosperous plunderers can afford
one from Agent Provocateur (www.agent
provocateur.com). Take a deep breath, lace
yourself up in one of these tight bodices, and get
ready to take no prisoners. Ye saucy wenches,
beware of the commotion you may cause. Dis
claimer: Ample floatation devices are not guar
anteed to save your life if you are actually in dan
ger of drowning.
Ahoy, Arrrrrrgyles: Fishnets and striped
tights in all colors are a welcome addition to
any aspiring crewmate's drawers. Protect
those bare legs from the cruel wind and rain
this season with a novel concept: socks! Pi
rates do NOT wear Rainbow flip-flops during

storms. For the
spendthrift plun
derer, Target has
striped knee-high
socks for $3.99 a
pair (and all the
fishnets you will
ever need to catch
your prey).
Color me
(Sin)bad: Commu
nists love their red.
So do Captains
Hook and Morgan.
The original ma
rauders were fond
of primary colors
and ornate gold em
broidery but the
modern pirate isn't
afraid of incorporat
ing untraditional
hues into his or her
wardrobe. Spring
sailors will be reach-

ing for the hot pink and lime green to go with
their traditional blacks.
Pirates Booty is the best booty: Knickers,
breeches, cutoffs, culottes (for those snotty
French pirates out there), whatever you want
to call them — they all make climbing rigging
or out of your wench's window so much easier.
Black, polishable boots with a snug fit and

good traction are essential.
Stilettos will kill you before
scurvy does. Remember that
vertical stripes make you look
longer and leaner and that
horizontal stripes make you
look wider and wider. And
some of you do not want to
broaden that horizon.
Avast! Accessorize!: Maybe
that lass in your English class
will finally pay attention to you
if hobble in with a wooden peg
leg. Ever consider the surefire
conversation starter that is the
hook? For that added bling,
clip on some huge gold hoop
earrings and throw on a few
heavy clanking chains (medal-

lions with se
cret treasure
maps option
al). Protect
your grog —
an engraved

hipflask is the new red cup. And
don't go anywhere without your
cutlass, especially when in
enemy waters.
Where's the money.
Matey?: Glue some doubloons
onto your Stanford sweatshirt if
you haven't invested in a mili-

tary coat or navy blazer. Smart kids are suckers
for shiny objects. Don't believe me? Tie one of
your shiny gold coins to a piece of clear fishing
wire and trail it behind you as you walk to class.
Don't cause too many bike accidents — reel in
the first good-looking lad or lass that takes the
bait.
Forget Victoria, here's Blackboard's secret:
Real pirates wear tons of eyeliner. And mascara.
And black eyeshadow. Pirates are MOODY, re
member? All they ever see is water, water and
water. Iggy Stardust was a landlocked pirate, he
just didn't know it. You're not better than David
Bowie or Johnny Depp.
The Age of the Jolly Roger is here. Get that
tattoo you always wanted, as long as it's not
some pansy little butterfly. Bandanas and Cap'n
Crunch-inspired hats beat baseball caps, hands

down.
Throw those flouncy
miniskirts overboard.
Put down those black
frame nonprescription
glasses and don an eye
patch — embrace your
inner buccaneer. Next
time you feel compelled
to tuck your jeans into
Uggs, remember this:
Dead men tell no tales,
but fashion victims feed
the whales.



Intermission editors adapt to the new pirate regime and
style. Parrots are highly recommended. Stnped shirts
are a plus as well.
