# 'What's a grapefruit?' Improvisin' on Stanford campus
## 
### BONNIE JOHNSON HIGH SEAS ART CRITIC 
On Sunday night, the Stanford Im
provisation Collective (abbreviated
as "[sic]") performed its annual con
cert in the collaborative event "Music
and Dance by Chance," working
alongside Stanford dancers and alum
ni choreographers at the Roble Gym
nasium Dance Studio. The evening's
dances and musical compositions
were all based on chance procedures,
honoring the work of choreographer
Merce Cunningham and his late part
ner. composer John Cage, in anticipa
tion of the Merce Cunningham Dance
Company's upcoming residency at
Stanford. Mark Applebaum of the
Music Department and Diane Frank
of the Dance Division co-directed
"Music and Dance by Chance;" both
have worked with Cunningham in the
past and are on the planning commit
tee for the Company's residency.
[sic] is an ensemble that Apple
baum organized and continues to lead
in its third year. This year, [sic] fea
tures 18 players on acoustic and elec
tronic instruments. Players include
uraduate students and undergradu

ates, some music majors and others
not, some experienced improvisers
and others novices.
Like kic], the dance choreogra
phers "for* "Music and Dance by
Chance" used chance procedures to
put together pieces for the event —
for instance, one dance is made up of
38 separate pieces of dance vocabu
lary that the choreographer se
quenced according to the Jet Blue
night arrival schedule on a certain day.
In the program notes, the directors ex
plain that "Chance's unpredictable
outcome. issures a degree of invention
beyond the limits of personal prefer
ence. convention, taste, or habit."
About project inspirations Cun
ningham and Cage, Applebaum said.
"Cunningham would make the
choreography independently, and
[the dancers] would rehearse it in si
lence ... then John Cage would writ£
some interesting music independent
ly. They would agree on a few issues
maybe, like total duration — maybe
that's about it, maybe some thematic
idea. But then the first time that the
music and the dance came together
would be in a dress rehearsal or pos
sibly even in the final performance."

The program for the event consist
ed of six parts, alternating [sic] sets
with the premiers of dances choreo
graphed by Stanford alumni, with [sic]
performing music for the dances, [sic]
opened with John Zorn's improvisa
tional game piece "Cobra" and went
on to perform Michael Gurevich's "n

questions" during Brittany Brown
Ceres' dance "Random Access Mem
oirs." In "n questions," the perform
ers all speak at once, each asking dif
ferent Jeopardy-style questions less
and less frequently until finally there
is only one voice (the last question on
this occasion was, "What is a grape
fruit?").
The next [sic] set featured original
pieces by two sub-ensembles, and Ap-
fora cracklebox
octet and two dice-rolling conductors.
Players walk along the stage looking
at cards that the conductors apply to
magnetic rails based on their dice
rolls, which are amplified by piezo
contact pick-ups and dictate different
actions. This piece was my personal
favorite of the evening.
The second dance was Hope
Mohr's "Allow Me to Say Good-

bye," accompanied by four stu- _
dents from the undergraduate «
composition seminar (Music 123) 1

who worked together to com-

pose a piece using chance
procedures. The third [sic]
set consisted of original

pieces by two sub-ensembles

as well as Applebaum's "Wristwatch:
Geology," in which players wear
watches with the score written in
symbols on their faces and tap stones
accordingly.
The final dance was Heidi
Schweiker's "Conundrum," per
formed alongside a piece by graduate
student composer Justin Yang.
Yang's piece, " 8' for Three Conduc
tors, Meta-Conductor, and Variable
Ensemble" uses chance procedures
including rolling dice and flipping
through sets of cards with different
numbers and colors.
Stanford's interdisciplinary "En
countenMerce" project will continue
until the end of March. Look fora

Like kic], the dance choreogra
phers "for* "Music and Dance by
Chance" used chance procedures to
put together pieces for the event —
for instance, one dance is made up of
38 separate pieces of dance vocabu
lary that the choreographer se
quenced according to the Jet Blue
night arrival schedule on a certain day.
In the program notes, the directors ex
plain that "Chance's unpredictable
outcome. issures a degree of invention
beyond the limits of personal prefer
ence. convention, taste, or habit."
About project inspirations Cun
ningham and Cage, Applebaum said.
"Cunningham would make the
choreography independently, and
[the dancers] would rehearse it in si
lence ... then John Cage would writ£
some interesting music independent
ly. They would agree on a few issues
maybe, like total duration — maybe
that's about it, maybe some thematic
idea. But then the first time that the
music and the dance came together
would be in a dress rehearsal or pos
sibly even in the final performance."

The program for the event consist
ed of six parts, alternating [sic] sets
with the premiers of dances choreo
graphed by Stanford alumni, with [sic]
performing music for the dances, [sic]
opened with John Zorn's improvisa
tional game piece "Cobra" and went
on to perform Michael Gurevich's "n

questions" during Brittany Brown
Ceres' dance "Random Access Mem
oirs." In "n questions," the perform
ers all speak at once, each asking dif
ferent Jeopardy-style questions less
and less frequently until finally there
is only one voice (the last question on
this occasion was, "What is a grape
fruit?").
The next [sic] set featured original
pieces by two sub-ensembles, and Ap-
fora cracklebox
octet and two dice-rolling conductors.
Players walk along the stage looking
at cards that the conductors apply to
magnetic rails based on their dice
rolls, which are amplified by piezo
contact pick-ups and dictate different
actions. This piece was my personal
favorite of the evening.
The second dance was Hope
Mohr's "Allow Me to Say Good-

bye," accompanied by four stu- _
dents from the undergraduate «
composition seminar (Music 123) 1

who worked together to com-

pose a piece using chance
procedures. The third [sic]
set consisted of original

pieces by two sub-ensembles

as well as Applebaum's "Wristwatch:
Geology," in which players wear
watches with the score written in
symbols on their faces and tap stones
accordingly.
The final dance was Heidi
Schweiker's "Conundrum," per
formed alongside a piece by graduate
student composer Justin Yang.
Yang's piece, " 8' for Three Conduc
tors, Meta-Conductor, and Variable
Ensemble" uses chance procedures
including rolling dice and flipping
through sets of cards with different
numbers and colors.
Stanford's interdisciplinary "En
countenMerce" project will continue
until the end of March. Look fora
