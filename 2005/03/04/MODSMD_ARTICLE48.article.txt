## INTERMISSION swabs the (tape) decks 
### TAM VO INTERMISSION MIXTAPE MARAUDER 
Last time, we brought you "Listen or die! Commumission mixtapes for the
Soviet in you. Pirates recently plundered the Intermission office, swiping
Sam s iPod and leaving us with only a tape player. Start swabbing the decks:
S°ngs to listen to while you are pillaging towns, plundering,
and drinking orange juice to ward on scurvy in tne LBC:

Rammstein — "Du Hast"
Richard Wagner — "Ride of the Valkryies"
Cake — "Going the Distance"
Sublime - "April 26, 1992"
OzzyOsbourne — "Crazy Train"
Andrew W.K — "Party Hard"
AC/DC 'Thunderstruck"
System of a Down — "War"
Deep Purple — "Smoke on the Water"
Bloodhound Gang — 'The Roof is On Fire"
Survivor — "Eye of The Tiqer"
Slayer — "Show No Mercy"

Songs to keep you company as you navigate the seven
seas, realize that every ocean looks the same, and that you
really could go for some land:

Nick Cave "The Ship Song"
The Sea and Cake — Flat Lay the Water"
The Beatles — "Yellow Submarine"
R.E.M. — "Night Swimming"
Bobby Darin — "Somewhere Beyond the Sea"
Modest Mouse — "Ocean Breathes Salty"
The Places — "Lazy Days & Castaways'
Secret Machines — "First Wave Down"
Billy Bragg and Wilco — "Secret of the Sea"

Songs to play on repeat after you have signed yourself to the
Intermission crew, realize that carsickness also applies to
ships, and regret not joining a land-locked organization:

The Decernberists — "Oceanside"
Yeah Yeah Yeahs — "Maps"
Built to Spill — "Car"
Guided by Voices — "As We Go Up
We Go Down" M
Bright Eyes — "Motion Sickness"
The Weakerthans — "Watermark"
Saves The Day"The —"The Vast Spoils of
America (From the Badlands
Through The Ocean)"
Ween — "Poop Ship Destroyer"
The Beach Boys — "I Just Wasn't
Made For These Times"
Pixies — "Where Is My Mind?"

Songs that prove paving a little more for an actual ship in
stead of a rickety raft that even Elian Gonzalez would turn
down is always a good idea:

The Shins — 'They'll Soon Discover"
Rainer Maria — "rlell and High Water"
Split Enz — "Six Months in a Leaky Boat"
Motorhead — "You Better Swim'
The Juliana Theory — "If I Told You This
Was Killing Me, Would You Stop?"
Captain's Note: Need mixtapes for that spe
cial or mundane occasion ? Be as specific as
you want. For example, "Songs for when
you wake up in the middle of your final and
there's only drool on the page." E-mail
