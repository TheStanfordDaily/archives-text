# ...Because it's an appropriate time for gonzo journalism

### BONNIE JOHNSON URBAN SEAFARER 
The 13th annual Noisepop festival in San
Francisco culminates for me in Les Georges
Leningrad on Friday. 1 take my friend Beki to
the show at Bottom of the Hill, across from fes
tival headquarters Thee Parkside. When 1 had
stopped there earlier in the week, the place was
crawling with scenesters and drunks. A local
band in the front room was covering "Please,
Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want." I
hadn't considered that the song could be more
depressing than it is on Hatful of Hollow, but
they made it happen.
We've missed happy hour, so we proceed to
the venue and have beers on the patio while
Postcoftus, The Flying I.uttenbachers and Chow
Nasty do their thing. The ladies of Erase Errata,
Les Georges' former tourmates, hold court near
the merch tables. Bass Goddess Ellie recognizes
me and comes over to talk, but I've used up my
intelligent speech for the night lecturing Beki on
the significance of updated post-punk and my
predictions for the lifespan of the Montreal

buzz. By the time Ellie gets to me,
I can only reiterate the brilliance of
her gig at Bimbo's.
The first time I saw Erase Errata,
they terrified me — Jenny at a

glowing drum set, announcing

herself a "BIRD OF

PREY!" with horns com
ing from nowhere, Ellie
taking a beer can to her

strings, all members' faces
obscured by hair. Wednes
day, they played an excellent

set on the Noisepop bill before
Mission of Burma took the
stage. My reaction to Mission of

Burma hasn't changed: Why are they
touring? They play energetically, but
I can't shake the trying-to-reclaim
lost-youth impression — likewise the

audience, because for non-pass

holders, tickets are freaking ex
pensive.
I look around and rec-

ognize many of the usual suspects,
among them members of the
Berkeley socialist cadre whom I also
associate, correctly or not, with

Queer Fist. I half-heartedly at
tempt to approach them, but
there's a beer-spilling crowd de
termined to hold its ground be-

tween us. And anyway, I need a
break from politics.

Next I make eye contact with
a fellow journalist and musician
sitting on the bar — a man
from Philly whom I met during
Jackie O Motherfucker's set at
All Tomorrow's Parties UK and

whose presence in my life since
then has been that of the fabled
Mediterranean mistral: appears
unexpectedly, brings trouble un-

failingly. I consider pre
tending not to see him, but
he won't let me off the
hook. I join him in front of the

speakers.
The three Georges come on in wigs, masks,
capes, polka dot halter dresses, skull-shaped
codpieces. It's a wild stage show revolving
around a drum kit and two decks of electronics.
The music has the exuberance and fearlessness
that only comes from willful insanity — this is
the real cutting edge, what we've had to look for
ward to all the time we've been fearing that ex
perimentation may have run its course. This is
why it's a good time to be alive.
People mosh, but it's a respectful indie-scene
mosh pit in which participants observe the unspo
ken rule not to mess up each other's hair — not
like the time I attended a Pixies reunion date in
Brixton and got in front for their opening cover of
"Winterlong" only to find myself in a raging sea
of pogo-dancing adolescent boys on the next
song. I sure as hell didn't see that one coming.
All too soon, the last call sounds, the encore
ends and everyone disperses. Ellie's fallen
asleep in a corner. I pull Beki away from new
found friends and pile my people into the Good
Ole Wagon, mistral and all. 'Til next year,
Noisepop.
