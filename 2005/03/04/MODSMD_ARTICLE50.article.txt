# Swashbucklin' Sass and her pirates' booty
## 
### ROXY SASS HIGH SEAS SEX GODDESS 
Rati is sexy. Bad cops, bad witches,
girls gone bad. As innocence fades, we
grow more and more intrigued by the
dark, mysterious horseman until we've
completely lost interest in the pure,
wholesome princess. Take Peter Fan.
Every girl's a Wendy, waiting for some
one to come steal her away in the mid
dle of the night for some improper and
fantasy-fulfilling adventure with no
real consequences. Peter is the link to

this magical world — but then

again, who wants an immature
boy who flies when you can
have a man. a captain even,
show you how to work the mo
tion of the ocean. Yes, Roxy
means Captain Hook, a man

who has mastered
cunning thievery,/
and no doubt
nilingus, to prove he
can do everything a

two-handed man
can, and better! He's

not just bad. He's badass.
And that's hot!
Pirates in general are
hot. After all. the second
most common fantasy fora
woman is getting it on in an
exotic setting, not too men-

tion the explicit appeal of men who am
operate huge machinery like boats,
planes, etc., and are available for short,
non-complex and enduring visits. Just
imagine them, working out all day. lug
ging ropes and erecting sails to thrust
their ship onward— only to be en
veloped by the night's dew in the horizon,
1 x>ng nights on the sea with only seamen
for company, ready and willing to wait
trough periods of nothing but blue seas
and blue balls — Roxy assures you that
this is what fantasies are all about.
First, let 's not forget the thrill of dan
ger. And like all g(xnl traveling busi-

nessmen, pirates
come with a strict
don't-ask-don't-

tell policy, so
you can enjoy
the goods and

the delayed
gratifica
tion of built
up horni
ness, guilt
free and

consequence-free. Then there's the
testosterone factor. And who can forget

that mischievous grin? Oooh,
Roxy swoons just thinking
about a pirate's twinkling
eyes, his full, parted lips, the
stubble ready to titillate her
soft skin in process of passing
over her body, his work-
I man's hands with muscular

forearms moving with crafts
manship as if she's a piece to
be worked, his chiseled and
bulging... everything.
That's the beauty of
fantasies: dangerous men
are made safe, pirates have
all their teeth (or not de
pending on if you're into
some cum action) and ex-

citement sails into your har
bor when you need it and

leaves for indefinite periods of

time when you're otherwise occupied.
Fantasies come in when reality be
comes less tiian perfect. But in the end,
they dissipate into the sunset before
you've had time to recover from that
last fantastic orgasm and before your
hand's recovered from helping you
complete that fabulous finale. Roxy
doesn't want to dispel illusions — in
stead. she hopes to incite new ones.
Everyone's got a pirate inside him. So
forget Peter Pan. Go get yourself
pegged with some splendid wood, and
Tinkerbelle's cheeks won't be the only
(Mies rosy with a happily-ever-after.
