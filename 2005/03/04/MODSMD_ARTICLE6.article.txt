# Local Democrats criticize governer's policies

### JESSICA ZHANG STAFF WRITER 
Speaking on financial, educational and envi
ronmental challenges facing the state of Califor
nia, Assemblyman Ira Ruskin (D-21st District)
and State Senator Joe Simitian (D-l Ith District)
appeared last night at an event entitled "Nation
al Promise: Responsible Government and the
American Dream," past of the Stanford Democ
rats' elected officials speaker series.
Both officials stressed their concerns about
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's recently re
leased budget proposal.
Ruskin said he was uneasy about the gover
nor's initiative to cut back spending for Prop. 98,
which established a minimum level of funding
for public schools. He said he also disagrees with

Schwarzenegger's plan to cut funding for trans
portation, healthcare and senior citizen services.
Simitian joked that after enduring the energy
crisis, budget crisis and the recall election within
four years, he expects 2005 to be even more chal
lenging.
"The budget will be harder than ever," Simit
ian said. "The opportunities to borrow funds
and to shift funds from one account to another
have all been done."
Simitian provided a simple equation for bal
ancing the budget.
"It's easy to solve the budget problem," he
said. "You spend less, collect more and do it
now. But, developing political will to do that is
very hard."
Simitian said that Governor Schwarzengger's
decision to roll back the vehicle registration tax

increased California's debt by denying the state
an additional $4 billion in revenue. He also said
the governor and his new financial advisor
refuse to implement any new taxes despite the
urgency of the state's financial situation.
"The state needs to be frugal in its spending
and the consequences of not acting now would
mean an even larger debt," Simitian said. "We
need to spend less than we have historically
spent and do it now."
Both Ruskin and Simitian agreed that the
governor's plan to lower funding for Prop. 98
will be detrimental to students.
"Real money would be disappearing," Simit
ian said. "Certain course offerings won't be
there. These are real dollars that have real im-
Local reps discuss budget, education

pacts on real kids in school."
According to Simitian, Stanford
will not be affected hy cuts in edu
cation funding, unlike public uni
versities and city colleges through
out California.
However, he added that Stan
ford students may not be entirely
immune to these cuts. Cal Grants,
one form of financial aid provided
to California residents by the state

and some Stanford students, might
also be decreased.
"If students can't go to private
schools and go to Berkeley instead,
the state must pick up the entire
tab," Simitian said. "This isn't just
bad education policy. It's bad eco
nomic policy."
The two officials touched
briefly on California environmen
tal policy.

"The budget is most important
but that doesn't mean everything
else should come to a stop," Ruskin
said. "We need to get the state to
use zero-emission, low-emission
and hybrid vehicles."
He also said that the state needs
to focus on the development of al
ternative fuel sources and provid
ing incentives to see that these tech
nologies reach their full potential.

Ruskin said he would like to see
the state adopt greenhouse gas
standards modeled on the Kyoto
Protocol.
" The federal government refus
es to acknowledge the science and
fact of greenhouse gases," he said.
"If the federal government isn't
going to do anything about it, 1
think it's important for California
to take the lead on it."
