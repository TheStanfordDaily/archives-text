### JESSICA ZHANG STAFF WRITER 
Speaking on financial, educational and envi
ronmental challenges facing the state of Califor
nia, Assemblyman Ira Ruskin (D-21st District)
and State Senator Joe Simitian (D-l Ith District)
appeared last night at an event entitled "Nation
al Promise: Responsible Government and the
American Dream," past of the Stanford Democ

Both Ruskin and Simitian agreed that the
governor's plan to lower funding for Prop. 98
will be detrimental to students.
"Real money would be disappearing," Simit
ian said. "Certain course offerings won't be
