New E-Waste Recycling Law
What is E-Waste?
E-waste is a popular, informal name for electronic
products nearing the end of their "useful
life." Computers, televisions, VCRs, •iCV
stereos, copiers, and fax machines are
common electronic products. Many of gd|
these products can be reused, refurbished, IT
or recycled. Unfortunately, electronic dis- 11
cards is one of the fastest growing segments 1
of our nation's waste stream. r ;
What is the new Recycling Law? 1 : 'U
On September 24, 2003, landmark legislation 1 /
established a funding system for the collec
tion and recycling of certain electronic
wastes. Key elements of the Electronic Waste
Recycling Act of 2003 that affect product consumers
include the collection of an
electronic waste recycling fee at the retail
point of sale of covered products and require
ments on manufacturers to provide con
sumer information regarding recycling
opportunities. The intent of this program is
to enhance the availability of• convenient
0 D&f* I//"§£} f\fY7 recycling options for consumers so that prod-
jf ' zf ucts containing toxic compounds are not dis
posed of inappropriately.
What's is the fee on my receipt?
Beginning January 1, 2005, an Electronic Waste Recycling Fee will be assessed
on certain "covered electronic devices" sold in California. "Covered" means
covered by the law, and includes most video display products such as comput
er monitors and televisions. The fee will be collected at the time of retail sale,
including Internet and catalog sales, to California consumers. It is important
to note that the Electronic Waste Recycling Fee is not a deposit, and that the
covered products do not contain "redemption value", as do many beverage
containers in California. Consumers are not entitled to reimbursement of the
fee when covered products are recycled. Rather, the intent of the fee is to
reduce, or eliminate, the costs associated with properly recycling this materi
al when it becomes waste. Because of this law, PSSI has dropped its TV or
Monitor Pick Up Rate from $50 to $15 each.
