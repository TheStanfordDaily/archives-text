The Creative Writing Program is Proud to Announce:
English 29: Writing the Nation
with The Stein Visiting Writer, Bharati Mukherjee
Wed 3:15-6:05
It is difficult to imagine Latin American culture without
invoking the name of Gabriel Garcia Marquez or of South
African culture without Nadine Gordimer. The seminar will
explore how selected fiction writers take on the entirety of
their culture as their subject matter. Familiar novels, such as
Madame Bovary, will be read from an unfamiliar perspective.
The seminar will also explore how certain aesthetic
strategies aid in achieving this monumental undertaking.
Reading List: Flaubert, Madame Bovary V. S. Naipaul, Bend
in the River Rushdie, Shame Gordimer, Burger's Daughter
Emecheta, The Joys of Motherhood Marquez, The General
in his Labyrinth Hijuelos, Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love
Ondaatje, In the Skin of the Lion Mahlouf, Remembering
Babylon Keneally, The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith.
Please submit writing samples to the Creative Writing Office
