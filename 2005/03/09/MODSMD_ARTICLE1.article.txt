### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Forty-one applicants to the Stanford
Graduate School of Business hacked into
their online applications last week using
instructions found on an online Business
Week forum. The GSB has yet to deter
mine a definitive course of action.
Derrick Bolton, director of admission
at the Business School, declined to com
ment, and only provided an e-mail state
ment in which he said, "'Business schools
teach students to make decisions and to
be accountable for those decisions."
Early last Wednesday, someone
known only by the username "brook
bond" posted online the procedure he
used to hack into the Harvard Business
School to view his application decision.
Others followed suit.
About 150 students total tried to ac

Metheny explained.
The Business School had not placed
any application decisions online at the

However, there remains some uncer
