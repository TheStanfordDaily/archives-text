# Merce takes over White Plaza
## 
### BONNIE JOHNSON 
The Merce Cunningham Dance
Company will perform once in
White Plaza and present its touring
piece "Split Sides" for Stanford
Lively Arts this week. This event is
part of Encounter: Merce, a series
celebrating the work of modern
dance artist Merce Cunningham,
who used chance rather than pre
choreographed movements in many
of his experimental dances.
The first piece, entitled "White
Plaza Event #1," which will be per
formed only once on March 12 at 2
p.m. was choreographed by Cunning
ham specifically for the occasion.
Music Prof. Mark Applebaum has
composed an original score for the
event, inspired by Cunningham's late
partner and composer John Cage.
There will be a countdown to the

event, beginning on March 11 when
the first of 35 pianists will sit down at a
grand piano at White Plaza to play
Erik Satie's "Vexations."
The piece is a fitting introduction
to the event because Satie's work
had a major influence on John Cage,
event coordinators said.
Cunningham choreographed a
dance using a succession of short
pieces from the company's reper
toire. The dance takes place along
side music written separately and au
tonomously by a composer.
"It's this collision, cohabitation,
rather than coordination of the music
and the dance," Applebaum says.
"There are moments in which the
dance and the music seem to be per
fectly wed to each other in kind of a
causal relationship. There are other
moments of complete or perfect an
tithesis. where they're in a polar rela

tionship and you have this kind of op
position going on. But most of the
time what you have is this very prob
lematic, oblique relationship be
tween the music and the dance."
Applebaum added that this in
congruous relationship allows audi
ence members to form opinions on
their own and doesn't tell them what
to look at or listen to.
During the half-hour dance, Ap
plebaum will alternate his solos with
those of the 16 students in his fresh
man seminar entitled "Silence! The
Music of John Cage." These students
will be positioned at the corner of
White Plaza facing Meyer Library.
Applebaum has named the entire
composition "The Bible without
God" after a memorable 1%3 asser
tion by Village Voice dance critic Jill
