# Cap and Gown turns 100

### NILA BALA STAFF WRITER 
"The fact that my service is
paving the way for future genera
tions of women makes the bumps
along the way worth it," said
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor at Saturday's Cap and
Gown centennial celebration.
A women's honors society
unique to Stanford, Cap and Gown
aims to link high-achieving female
students with alumni, the group's
leaders said. The gala was a day-long
event featuring speakers and pre
sentations and culminated with a
banquet and O'Connor's keynote
address.
Her speech touched on both the
past and future of the organization.
Her anecdotes of life at on the
Farm during the late 40s elicited
chuckles from the audience.
"Luckily in those days, there
were many required classes,"
O'Connor recounted. "Western Civ
was great. At a 'freshman jolly-up,' I
met an engineering student back
from World War 11. My social life
was kx>king up."
She spoke about her own path in
life to stress the necessity of "bridge
building" for future-generations,
adding that Cap and Gown has long
served as a bridge-builder between
Stanford and the post-graduate
world.
In her concluding remarks,
O'Connor echoed the event's main
theme of conscientiousness, espe
cially in maintaining contact with
those who have gone before.
"It's important to remember we
live in a free society," O'Connor
said. "We have rights and responsi
bilities to discipline ourselves-to be
conscientious. This means a life-long
effort to leave the world a little bet
ter than we found it."
The banquet opened with a
speech delivered by Jean Coblentz.
chair of the Centennial committee.
She announced the new centennial
scholarship, which will join the five
existing scholarships offered
through the organization. Cap and
Gown has awarded over 170 schol
arships to date.
The other festivities surrounding
the organization's l()0th anniversary
also emphasized a sense of tradition
transcending the past and present.
Years ago, female students were

selected for Cap and Gown through
a tapping ceremony held in the din
ing halls. Now, candidates must
apply to join the society, but some
traditions remain, such as a ceremo
nial "tapping tea" held in the fall to
welcome new members.
Nancy Campbell Victor, Class of
1953, still remembers when she was
tapped.
"It was probably the greatest
honor a woman could have," she
said. "After being tapped we all went
to President Wallace Sterling's
house for tea. Stanford was so small
that we could do that."
Included in the day's events was a
presentation of the "Centennial Sur
vey" conducted by Shari Young
Kuchenbecker, Class of 1970 and
Cap and Gown member. The study
compiled 688 life stories from Cap
and Gown women exploring a host
of factors.
"In a comparison of general Stan
ford women alumni and Cap and
Gown alumni. Cap and gown
women have outlived Stanford
women in eight out of 10 decades,"
Kuchenbecker said.
Although she said she could not
be sure of the reasons for this trend
without more research. Kuchen
becker offered one hypothesis.
"Conscientious women last, and
really nice conscientious women last
best of all," she said.
Regina-Celeste Ahmed, Class of
2(XK), also said that Cap and Gown
women are something special.
"The Cap and Gowners were
women that I had been looking for
my whole time at Stanford." she said.
"1 had no mentor at Stanford before
this. I wanted to go into an astronaut
program and met one at a Cap and
Gown function. She told me things I
wouldn't have known about the pro
gram."
