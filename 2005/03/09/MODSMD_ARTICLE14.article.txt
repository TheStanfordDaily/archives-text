# Bookstore posts lead warnings
## 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
"Prop. 65 warning: Consuming
foods or beverages that have been kept
or served in leaded crystal products or
handling products made of leaded crys
tal will expose you to lead — a chemical
known to the state of California to
cause birth defects or other reproduc
tive harm."
In recent weeks, signs bearing this
warning have been posted prominently
near displays of merchandise in the
Stanford Bookstore. Prop. 65, the Safe
Drinking Water and Toxic Enforce
ment Act, is a law unique to California

passed in 1986 that requires businesses
to warn consumers about potentially
dangerous chemicals in the products
they sell.
The California Office of Environ
mental Health Hazard Assessment has
established what are known as "safe
harbor" qualifications, or levels of ex
posure that trigger the warning require
ment for certain chemicals. Businesses
post warnings at their own discretion
but are bound by law to do so if their
products contain levels of these chemi
cals that exceed the "safe harbor" lev
els.
At the Bookstore, the warnings are
posted on top of glassware displays that
include ceramic mugs, shot glasses, dec

orative glasses and coffee thermoses.
Cliff Ewert, spokesman for Follett
Higher Education Group, the company
that manages the store, said that the
new signs were put up to cover the lia
bilities of out of state manufacturers.
"California is the only state to re
quire that these warnings be put up for
even trace elements," Ewert said. "The
signs are there as a convenience to
cover all products. We're complying
with California law by informing that
these products may or may not contain
lead."
However, Ewert also said that near
ly all glassware contains some traces of
the chemical, but that he is extremely
doubtful that products sold at the book
store contain levels of lead above the
"safe harbor" mark.
"We assume that our products don't
[contain enough lead to be danger
ous]," he said. "The signs are meant to
be comprehensive."
According to the California Child
hood Lead Prevention Branch, or
CCLPB, "occasional" use of leaded
crystal will not expose users to large
amounts of lead unless they are used as
storage containers. However, the
Bookstore warnings — though they
only mention leaded crystal — are
posted near displays of all kinds of
glassware.
"1 don't think the signs are clear at
all," said senior Cicely Smith, who was
shopping fora glass fora friend. "I was
just wondering what the warnings ap
plied to, since I couldn't tell if the signs
applied to a new product since I haven't
seen them before."
She said the Prop. 65 warnings
would dissuade her from buying a prod
uct, especially if they weren't clearer.

"The Bookstore should put the
warnings on the actual prtxiuct that
contains lead," she said. "If other prod
ucts are safe, they should display them
separately."
The CCLPB states that ceramic
products, especially decorative ones,
sometimes contain small amounts of
lead used for glazes and decorations.
Lead gives glaze a smoother, glasslike
finish, which also provides strength to
the ceramic and keeps moisture from
penetrating into the piece. However,
most tableware, which should include
the standard coffee mugs sold at the
Bookstore, have lead levels below the
Prop. 65 "safe harbor" levels.
Freshman Maren Shipe said that she
had noticed the warnings during fall
quarter.
"I did my Program in Writing and
Rhetoric paper about pediatric cancer
and I read about how some baby bottles
were carcinogenic," Shipe said. "When
1 went into the Bookstore after, I no
ticed smaller warnings that said mugs
and crystal wares could be carcino
genic. Now the signs have changed.
They're a little bigger and mention
birth defects but they could be much
more prominent."
Although Ewert said that no stu
dents have asked about the signs, Shipe
included the warnings at the Bookstore
in a voluntary presentation of her PWR
topic to Serra, her dorm.
"There were a couple of questions
about the warnings but I told them I
didn't know anything else about it,"
Shipe said. "They were surprised, but
not overly concerned. Lt definitely
makes you think, though, especially
since the signs aren't very clear." She

warning have been posted prominently
near displays of merchandise in the
Stanford Bookstore. Prop. 65, the Safe
Drinking Water and Toxic Enforce
ment Act, is a law unique to California

passed in 1986 that requires businesses
to warn consumers about potentially
dangerous chemicals in the products
they sell.
The California Office of Environ
mental Health Hazard Assessment has
established what are known as "safe
harbor" qualifications, or levels of ex
posure that trigger the warning require
ment for certain chemicals. Businesses
post warnings at their own discretion
but are bound by law to do so if their
products contain levels of these chemi
cals that exceed the "safe harbor" lev
els.
At the Bookstore, the warnings are
posted on top of glassware displays that
include ceramic mugs, shot glasses, dec

orative glasses and coffee thermoses.
Cliff Ewert, spokesman for Follett
Higher Education Group, the company
that manages the store, said that the
new signs were put up to cover the lia
bilities of out of state manufacturers.
"California is the only state to re
quire that these warnings be put up for
even trace elements," Ewert said. "The
signs are there as a convenience to
cover all products. We're complying
with California law by informing that
these products may or may not contain
lead."
However, Ewert also said that near
ly all glassware contains some traces of
the chemical, but that he is extremely
doubtful that products sold at the book
store contain levels of lead above the
"safe harbor" mark.
"We assume that our products don't
[contain enough lead to be danger
ous]," he said. "The signs are meant to
be comprehensive."
According to the California Child
hood Lead Prevention Branch, or
CCLPB, "occasional" use of leaded
crystal will not expose users to large
amounts of lead unless they are used as
storage containers. However, the
Bookstore warnings — though they
only mention leaded crystal — are
posted near displays of all kinds of
glassware.
"1 don't think the signs are clear at
all," said senior Cicely Smith, who was
shopping fora glass fora friend. "I was
just wondering what the warnings ap
plied to, since I couldn't tell if the signs
applied to a new product since I haven't
seen them before."
She said the Prop. 65 warnings
would dissuade her from buying a prod
uct, especially if they weren't clearer.

"The Bookstore should put the
warnings on the actual prtxiuct that
contains lead," she said. "If other prod
ucts are safe, they should display them
separately."
The CCLPB states that ceramic
products, especially decorative ones,
sometimes contain small amounts of
lead used for glazes and decorations.
Lead gives glaze a smoother, glasslike
finish, which also provides strength to
the ceramic and keeps moisture from
penetrating into the piece. However,
most tableware, which should include
the standard coffee mugs sold at the
Bookstore, have lead levels below the
Prop. 65 "safe harbor" levels.
Freshman Maren Shipe said that she
had noticed the warnings during fall
quarter.
"I did my Program in Writing and
Rhetoric paper about pediatric cancer
and I read about how some baby bottles
were carcinogenic," Shipe said. "When
1 went into the Bookstore after, I no
ticed smaller warnings that said mugs
and crystal wares could be carcino
genic. Now the signs have changed.
They're a little bigger and mention
birth defects but they could be much
more prominent."
Although Ewert said that no stu
dents have asked about the signs, Shipe
included the warnings at the Bookstore
in a voluntary presentation of her PWR
topic to Serra, her dorm.
"There were a couple of questions
about the warnings but I told them I
didn't know anything else about it,"
Shipe said. "They were surprised, but
not overly concerned. Lt definitely
makes you think, though, especially
since the signs aren't very clear." She
added that she had bought a mug for

Signs have been posted in the Stanford Bookstore warning consumers that
certain products, particular ceramics and glasses, may contain lead.
