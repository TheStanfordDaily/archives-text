Affirmative action hurts African Americans
more than it helps them, asserted UCLA Law
Prof. Richard Sander at last Friday's panel "Ben
efit or Burden? Affirmative Action in American
Law Schools."
The discussion turned into a heated debate de
spite efforts by Law School Dean Larry Kramer
to frame the panel as ongoing dialogue on affir
mative action policies between colleagues. While
the panel was scheduled to last a little over an
hour, the time was extended to allow audience
members more time to question the panelists.
Stanford Law Prof. Richard Banks moderated
the debate and stated that the topic at hand —
Sander's paper entitled "A Systemic Analysis of
Affirmative Action in American Law Schools"
— was an empirical analysis, not a debate about
the merits of affirmative action.
In his opening remarks, Sander said that due to
racial preferences in affirmative action policies.

unprepared or unqualified African Americans
are admitted to law schools. He said this directly
causes large dropout rates among African-Amer
icans — twice that of white admits. His study also
cited that African Americans are four times more
likely to fail the exam the first time than whites.
Sander added that his study is "an attempt to
try to understand these disparities."
Panelist David Chambers, an emeritus profes
sor at the University of Michigan Law School who
has written a critique of Sander's study, acknowl
edged that Sander's statistics were "largely cor
rect." Even so, he called Sander's predictions and
conclusions "garbage."
Chambers was adamant in his disagreement
with Sander's theories throughout, particularly
taking issue with the conclusion that affirmative
action should be abolished, which he stressed was
not the solution to the problems.
Panelist Stuart Taylor, a lawyer and columnist
for The National Journal, wrote a column prais
ing Sander's work, calling it "more compelling
and persuasive than the critiques." He said

Sander's argument was undisputed and that affir
mative action was illegal because it was "pure
racial balancing." He concurred that the prob
lems African Americans have in law school are
due to racial preferences in admissions.
"It is devastating to the rosy picture of affir
mative action," Taylor said.
Panelist Rachel Moran, a professor at the
Boalt Hall School of Law at UC Berkeley, criti
cized Sander's study for focusing on the "inputs"
— or statistics such as LSAT scores — as the sole
contributors to the "outputs" — such as gradua
tion rates and first-try bar exam scores.
Moran emphasized the importance of the
process that converts inputs to outputs and said it is
a mistake to treat "entering credentials as destiny."
Sander presented his theory of "mis-match,"
in which African-American students who are not
prepared for certain law schools are accepted,
causing an average of 50 percent to fall in the bot
tom 10th percentile of the class.
