### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Preferring political banter to
beer pong. Roosevelt Institution fel
lows from the Committee on Inter
national Development. Democracy
and Health discussed the crisis in
Darfur last Thursday night with
John Prendergast, the special advi
sor to the president of the Interna
tional Crisis Group.
Prendesgast is the newest mem
ber of the Roosevelt Institution's
National Advisory Board, a com
mittee designed to support and so
lidify the Roosevelt Institution in
real-world political circles.
Students presented Prendergast
with a drafted policy recommenda
tion addressing the alleged genocide
in Darfur. The paper included rec
ommendations to increase the pres
ence of the African Union and to
take perpetrators to the Internation
al Criminal Court. Prendergast pin
pointed parts of the policy proposal
that could be improved, but said he
was very impressed with the Roo
sevelt Institution's efforts overall.
In addition to policy recommen
dations, fellows write opinion pieces
focused on topics ranging from the
Sudan to environmental sustainabil
ity. They also planned for several
speakers to come to campus, includ
ing former Sierra Club President
Adam Werbach and Uganda expert
Sam Watulatsu.
"The past month has been all
about creating our product." said
sophomore Ouinn Wilhelmi, execu

tive director of the Roosevelt Insti
tution. "Roosevelt aims to organize
existing student ideas and promote
them — so our task has been creat
ing the model by which that process
takes place."
In many cases, student fellows
have already gained knowledge in
the areas that the Roosevelt Institu
tion addresses through classes and
research.
One such student is senior Jenny
Tolan, an international relations
major who received a grant to study in
Mpumalanga, South Africa, with the
Masoyi Home Based Care Project, a
program that treats AIDS victims.
Tolan presented her research last
week to a group of Roosevelt Insti
tution fellows who hope to turn her
class paper into a policy brief that
the Roosevelt Institution can send
to Capital Hill.
Despite its successes, the Institu
tion has also become the target of
both criticism and skepticism. Some
students have complained that the
organization lacks a bi-partisan feel
and is simply an extension of the
Stanford Democrats.
"I had hoped that a revolutionary
new student think-tank would at
tempt to build bridges rather than
burn them down," said freshman
Nick Hoy, who wrote an article on
the Roosevelt Institution for The
Stanford Review. "Roosevelt runs
the large risk of becoming a polity of
policy yes-men." Hoy is also a re
porter for the Daily.
"Roosevelt itself is not liberal,"
said Wilhelmi, who also serves as di

rector for the Stanford Democrats.
"[The] Roosevelt [Institution] is
about broadcasting the ideas of
today's young people — and
frankly, our generation just can't be
defined in simple terms of left or
right. Anyone who tries to divide us
as such is out of touch with main
stream youth culture."
Some students and faculty mem
bers have also said Roosevelt Insti
tution fellows will have a difficult
time living up to their ambitious
rhetoric.
In a Feb. 27 article in the San
Francisco Chronicle, Hoover Re
search Fellow Bill Evers said that the
Roosevelt Institution's student fel
lows will face challenges because
they do not have an endowment or a
building or a paid staff, and that it will
be difficult fitting in-depth research
into their collegiate schedules.
There have also been rumors of
structural and organizational prob
lems within the Institution.
Wilhelmi verified these rumors
but said that both he and the fellows
remain optimistic.
"In January, all the Roosevelt In
stitution was to me was an e-mail I
had in my inbox over break," said
sophomore Chrissie Coxon, direc
tor for the Roosevelt Institution's
Committee on International Devel
opment, Democracy and Health. "If
creating an organization with this
huge scope, momentum and vision
during only one quarter is evidence
of organizational problems, then yes
by god, we've got all the problems in
the world."
