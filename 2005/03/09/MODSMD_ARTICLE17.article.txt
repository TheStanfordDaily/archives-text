I >1 nt like cell phones. At first, I

IIi what bothers mc about
most technology.
V, till m\ liiends arc oil perma
11\ integrating phones, iPods
ind (hi i',!/mos into their bodies,
m\ uiin nty status as a pen-and
hhi prison has turned me into an
i \ i;i; i ol teclino-tyrannical op
pression.
Iii instance, when my brother

hi lim lie calls my home phone
and Ii a\rs a message.
Nun don't have a cell phone!"
\ is il I didn't know. "How

told my brother what I

said
W hatl said.
I aspect my dad paid him oil to
nplain a(i PS chip and a bug to track
111 \ whereabouts and activities at all
tiiiu s Hut iliai is anothei matter.
Now that I have a cell phone, per
haps it.it malls \\ ill be my fault when
lm brother can't meet up with me.
< )n i Muis Briggs test, my person

ap| .hi litl\ the psycho babble ler
minology t'oi late. Now that I've
si ii li d i m. 111bei ing that I have this
little ringing gadget, I'm sure the
problem will only get worse.
Machines make la/incss easy,
uid I mi naturally much too la/.y.
M\ ss.i\s have been logical messes
sin I h arned the copy-paste func
tion >1 word processors, and the one
tliiii I do like about cell phones is
that I can i all tin brother across the
house.
Willi iln arrival ol my own cell
phone. I m all each psychosomati
all y K cling the loss ol mental ca
p i 11\ as I track appointments,
phi mi numbers and the time in my
phone instead ol my brain.
Howes i it's unlikely I'll devel
<p thi same kind ol dependency as
evfiAoin else ('onsider my inabili

( II ace." I said, into the phone.
"(i K \( I"it shouted back at me.
\l'lei several attempts, the feed
back was not improving.so I thought
I'll jusi let the robot voice say my
phone number. I told my brother 1
didn't want mv name on there after
all and began punching menu bul
lous Ihe phone beeped and said —
in a childish, singsong voice that I
sweat is not mine "I don't want
ni\ name on here." I hen it hung up.
So perhaps all this angry ranting
aboul m\ cell-dependent brother is
really in excuse for my lack of tech
no saw \ I in list confess that I don't
kiii w the difference between an old
il'od and the awesome new iPod
shulll thing, and my old clunky lap
top feels lat on class Powerpoint
prcsentation days.
Maybe I'm jlist falling behind
with all this gadgetry stuff and the
n w thing where everybody's con
fused and late. I really do want to
i mi around never knowing what I'm
doing ot where I'm going. It's in my
P t\pe personality You know what
thts say the 'phobe is just the
closet case.

You could mil my it'll phone and
leave a voice message for "I Don't
Want Mv .Xante on Here." Hut con
sidering that I'll he another few
week s figuring out how t<> access the
message hox, I'd suggest using
>gliu(f Stanford, etlu instead.
