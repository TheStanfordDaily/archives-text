## When entering beware—you're being watched

II you are prone to linger by the front door
of Castano, you should know that you are
being watehed — possibly by every resident.
The lobby Cam, a Web cam that is linked to
the dorm's Web site, shows but does not
record the images. While some residents said
they find the lobby Cam amusing, many others
were perplexed by its sudden appearance.
Castano's resident computing coordinator,
Jon Liang, a sophomore, set up the Web cam
three weeks ago in order to allow residents to
see il visitors were at the door. He also want
ed to recycle some of his outdated electronics.
The lobby Cam system consists of a $14 toy
digital camera, a 10-year-old laptop and USB
and ethernet cables.
Because of the primitive equipment, the
lobby Cam is only able to detect stationary
people as blurry objects and people in motion
as a large streak of color.
"People will be able to tell if somebody is
near the door, but not specifically who [is
there]," Liang said.
1 he camera is located on the second floor bal
c< my and c< >nnects to the lapti >pin a nearby wiring
closet. Anyone can visit the Castano dorm's Web
site (http://www.stanford.edu/group/resed/man
zanita/castano) and see the current image from
the camera.
Liang does not know of any other dorms
with security cameras. He believes that this is
due to the fact that most dorms do not have a
conveniently located wiring closet like the one

in Castano.
Many residents have yet to use the lobby-
Cam, although most are now aware of its exis
tence. Some expressed alarm that the Web cam
was installed without much dorm discussion.
"It was put up and nothing was explained,"
said junior Pamela Morganroth. "A lot of peo
ple thought it was bad because they were
filmed before they were aware that there was
a camera there."
Others in Castano regard the lobby Cam as
a strange, but harmless, venture and are un
sure of how useful it will prove to be.
"It struck me as weird at first, but 1 don't
think anyone was really bothered," said junior
Eli Lazarus, who has never used the lobby-
Cam to view visitors at the door.
Lazarus noted that the Web cam might
come in handy in the game of "assassins,"
which Castano residents are currently playing.
However, others, like Morganroth, expressed
doubt about the usefulness of the webcam.
"I don't really care that much that it's
there, but 1 can't see myself ever using it,"
Morganroth said.
Still, others, like sophomore Adam
Kircher, said they find entertainment value in
the webcam.
"It's kind of funny to try to recognize people
on the Web cam, since it's so blurry," he said.
Liang said he thinks that Castano residents
have warmed up to the lobby Cam. which Liang
refers to as Castano's "pet rock." since he post
ed a page devoted to frequently asked questions
about the Web cam on the Castano Web site.
"The initial paranoia among residents that

'Big Brother is Watching' has mostly de
volved into 'The Pet Rock is Peeing on the
Carpet Again! No! Bad Rock! " Liang said.
As for the concern that the lobby Cam might
be construed as a violation of privacy, Liang

sees this as a highly unlikely accusation, given
the primitive nature of the webcam system.
"It's less of an invasion of privacy than some
sketched-out classmate stalking you on theface
book[.com| and reading your blog," he said.
