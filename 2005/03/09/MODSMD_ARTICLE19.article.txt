# Sink, swim or paddle like a duck?
## 
### COURTNEY WEAVER STAFF WRITER 
With the onset of spring quarter-like
weather this past weekend, many students
abandoned studying at Meyer and Green li
braries for taking naps on Wilbur Field and
running on Campus Drive.
For its warm weather and West Coast atti
lude, Stanford often earns the reputation of
being more laid back than its peer institutions.
Yet recently, some have been complaining
that this attitude is simply a facade for over
committed schedules and dangerously high
levels of stress.
This problem can be summed up best by its
endearingly titled nickname, "the duck syn
drome." As one student in the "2003 Fisk
C iuide to Colleges" explains. "[Students] look
peaceful on the surface hut they're paddling
like mad underneath."
At a Frosh Council meeting last year, stu
dents brought up the issue after feeling over
whelmed from running Frosh Formal and a
talent show in addition to keeping up with
their school work.
A panel of four students was consequently
formed with the help of Dean of Freshmen and
Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-Haims and
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
John Bravman to formally address the issue in
front of a group of about 75 administrators.
The topic of the Jan. 20 meeting was "Ad
dressing the Stanford Duck Syndrome: Calm
on the Surface But Paddling Like Mad To
Stay Afloat." There were over 35 administra
tors in attendance. The program featured a
panel of four upperclassmen, sharing their ex
periences from freshman year.
"Students have told us that Stanford's laid
back culture makes them want to put up a fa
cade to make it look like they can easily bal
ance the complexities of college life and aca
demics." Lythcott-Haims said. "But with every
student erecting a facade it appears that no one
has to work hard to succeed, so a student who
is working hard just to keep up feels he or she
must not be as smart as the rest of the class."
"Worse, when a student is struggling?there
is little support in the student community be
cause everyone is acting as if they are not very
stressed or concerned about such things," she
added.
Lythcott-Haims does not believe that a
specific solution necessarily needs to be
found, however. Rather, the key action that
can be taken is simply exposing the issue so
that students feel more comfortable express
ing their frustrations. As a result, it is hoped
that they will feel less isolated.
Since the meeting, the administration has
already made an effort to accomplish this with
the "Celebr'oB Mid-Year Convocation for
Freshmen," which will likely become a winter
quarter tradition.
"1 think the administrators in attendance
left the meeting with a better understanding
of the stresses that face students in their first
year at Stanford,"said Krista Zizzo, student
affairs officer in the Office of Freshman and
Transfer Students."Hopefully, it opened the
door for (students] to talk about their own ex
periences with others in their dorm."
The Freshman Dean's office also created
the new Web site, http://frosh.stanford.edu as
a resource for freshmen.
"It features Words of Wisdom' from upper
class students and links to information and re
sources to help students gel connected to the
departments that are here to help them suc
ceed at Stanford," Zizzo said.
This goes along with Lythcott-Haims'
w hole philosophy of how to address the issue
of the duck syndrome in general.
"This is not as much about fixing a problem
as about gelling students to talk about their

stressors and worries and in so doing to realize
they are not alone," Lythcott-Haims said.
Sophomore Elizabeth Heng, a member of
the panel, said that competition was the un
derlying factor of students? behaviors.
"You're putting basically the top three
percent of the world together and you're com
peting to be like the top 0.05 percent of the
world," Heng said. "And everyone puts up
this facade that everything's okay [when it?s
not]. And they don't know what to do when
there really is a problem."
Sophomore Alok Desphande, who was a
member of Frosh Council last year, agreed.
"Students were saying Tm taking 20 units,
I'm in three a cappella groups and I'm doing
fine,'" he said. "People felt like when they got
to the end of the quarter, everything really hit,
but by that point it was too late and they were
already too overcommitted."
Deshpande said he thinks that students'
overextension can be credited to the propaga
tion of the duck syndrome and a mispercep
tion that "Everyone else is doing fine with this
amount of work, so why am 1 not doing fine?"
"The administration wants us to be ducks,"
freshman Yuron Greif said. He elaborated
that the University fosters an atmosphere that
promotes a relaxed environment but still pres
sures students to work extremely hard.
Freshman Scott McCracken, however,
said he thinks that the blame falls more upon
the students than upon the administration.
"I just don't really think it's the adminis
tration's job to deal with it," McCracken said.
"It's the students' job to look out for each
other."
However, some students said that the duck
phenomenon is altogether not necessarily a
bad thing.
Freshman Carolyn Mansfield said. "I'd

rather that everyone just not talk about [all
their work] than be openly competitive."
Freshman Jordi Handcox agreed.
"1 think due to the duck phenomenon, stu
dents here are a lot happier, even ii it is just a
facade," she said.
Self-proclaimed "duck" and freshman
Ann Lucena also said that she sees the bene
fits of a duck attitude on campus.
"I don't do it for other people. 1 just do it
for myself," she said. "It's much more enjoy
able to be relaxed, even if at times you're
working hard. From what 1 hear, it seems like
people at other schools are really stressed and
it will be apparent right away from talking to
them. Here, a lot of people seem really calm
even if they're working hard."
Others, such as freshman Peter Prowitt.
don't even buy into the idea of a duck phe
nomenon at all.
"I feel like people are either laid back or
they're stressed out," and not somewhere in
the middle, he said.
A basketball player, Prowitt said he thinks
that athletes tend to be more relaxed than
other students.
"Athletes in general are more laid back be
cause they have their schedule already
planned out for them, so they don't really
have time to waste and they are able to get
their work done."
Crew member and freshman Jake Pashelin
sky said that some people are simply laid back.
"I think some people are laid back, but not
everybody," he said. "And there are definite
ly a lot of people who don't work very hard."
Handcox labeled these students "rubber
ducks' who "just float along, enjoying college
life without paddling."
She described herself as "a duck that's
about to sink to the bottom of the pond.
