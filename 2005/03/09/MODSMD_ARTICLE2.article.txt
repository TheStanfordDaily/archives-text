# Most groups OK'd for ballot
## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
All of the groups that peti
tioned during last week to be
placed on the special-fees ballot
were approved at last night's
ASSU Undergraduate Senate
meeting except for Six Degrees:
A Journal of Human Rights and
The Stanford Daily, which were
unable to turn in the required
number of signature.
Last week many student
groups circulated petitions to be
placed on the special-fees ballot.
In the spring, the student body
will vote on which groups on this
ballot will receive special fees.
According to ASSU Under
graduate Senate chair Chris Lin. a
senior, there are several different
reasons why organizations need
ed to circulate these petitions.
Groups that were not ap

proved by the appropriate legisla
tive body, either the Senate or the
Graduate Student Council, they
must collect signatures from 15
percent of the relevant student
population in order to appear on
the ballot. Organizations that did
not agree with the funding allot
ted to them by the Senate or GSC
also needed to collect the same
number of signatures.
In other cases, student groups
that were placed on the ballot
last year but did not pass, or new
special-fees groups had to col
lect the signatures of 10 percent
of the appropriate student popu
lation. If a group passed last year
but wanted to increase their
budget by more than 10 percent,
they also had to collect this
amount of signatures.
According to Elections Com
missioner Troy Steinmetz, a

sophomore, the following under
graduate groups submitted petitions
with 15 percent of the undergradu
ate student body's signatures — a
total of 990 — because they were
not approved: Stanford Mock Trial,
Stanford Dance Marathon and Vol
unteers in Latin America.
The Asian American Students
Association, Black Student Union,
Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion and Stanford Solar Car Project
turned in petitions with the same
number of signatures because they
were not pleased with the budget that
the Senate had approved for them.
Students groups that submitted
petitions with 10 percent of the un
dergraduate student body's signa
tures because they appeared on the
ballot the previous year but didn't
receive fees included MEChA,
Stanford Axe Committee and The
Stanford Progressive.
Six Degrees: A Journal of
Human Rights also submitted a pe
tition with this number of signa
tures because they are requesting
special fees for the first time. The
Muslim Student Awareness Net
work also collected this number
because leaders hope to expand
their budget significantly from
what it was last year.
Club Sports and The Stanford
Daily, which were not approved by
the Senate or GSC for joint place
ment on the ballot, had to collect sig
natures from 15 percent of the entire
Stanford student population, or
2198 students.
The validation of the submitted
petitions is a multi-step process. Ac
cording to Steinmetz, the Elections
Commission disqualifies any packets
or sheets whose form does not fit the
acceptable criteria, removes any
graduate student signatures from un
dergraduate groups and any signa
tures without accompanying student
identification numbers. It then tallies
the total remaining signatures.
"Basically, we randomly select 50
signatures and check that the SUID
and printed name match using infor
mation provided by the Registrar's
Office," Steinmetz said. "We then
take the percentage of the sample
that was valid and multiply that by
the number of signatures turned in."
For example, if a group turns in

100 signatures and one of the 50 sig
natures checked was invalid, the ad
justed signature total is 49 divided by
50 multiplied by 100, totaling 98
valid signatures. If this adjusted
value falls below the number of sig
natures needed, then the group is
denied placement on the ballot.
Six Degrees submitted a total of
595 signatures, which fell well below
the required number of 660.
The Daily, which submitted a
total of 2,213 signatures was not ap
proved because one of the 50 signa
tures that were randomly checked
was invalid, lowering the Daily's ad
justed total to 2,168 — 30 signatures
short of the number required for
ballot placement.
Steinmetz acknowledged that
certain parts of the special-fees pe
titioning process have proved
problematic.
"The petition process in general
has a lot of flaws in how it's imple
mented and we recognize that and
try to take it into consideration," he
said. "The people signing the peti
tions aren't holding groups to the
standard of the appropriate form
and the groups aren't presenting the
petitions a lot of times in the appro
priate form and the elections com
mission isn't in a position where we
can equitably enforce those policies.
We need to revise the petition
process in the future."
Many of the petitioning organiza
tions mobilized their members in
order to obtain the required amount
of signatures.
Betsy Walls, a freshman and
member of Mock Trial, stated that
the group divided the petitions
among its members, requiring each
to collect a lower number of signa
tures.
"Essentially all of us were as
signed to collect fifty a piece," Walls
said. "We went to house meetings
and we went door-to-door."
There were rules governing ex
actly what students could do to ob
tain signatures. For example, the
group had to have a copy of its pro
posed budget and this year's budget
attached to the petition before it
could be legally signed.
"You couldn't collect in class and
libraries and you couldn't do anything
that impeded the normal process of
the University," Walls said.
Groups made it a high priority to
make it onto the ballot not only out
of financial need but also because
they feel it would be a sign of recog
nition by the student body.
