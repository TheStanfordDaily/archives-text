# GETTING HITCHED ON CAMPUS
## 
### LAURA CARWILE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although Memorial Church is constantly Hooded with a
stream of tourists posing for pictures. On weekends, the
church's halls are filled with the sounds of an organ playing
"Here Comes the Bride."
The church serves as a prime location for couples to get
married. In the past two calendar years, there have been be
tween 110 to 120 weddings at the church.
"There are some crazy Saturdays, as we can have up to four
weddings a day," said Julie Cheng, the wedding coordinator
for the church. "I like to think of the summer months, which is
the peak of the wedding season, as a marathon that we train for
and complete successfully."
With the nice weather this past weekend, one would imag
ine that the church would have an overflow engaged couples
clamoring fora Saturday afternoon wedding. But oddly
enough, that wasn't the case, with zero weddings scheduled for
the weekend, which debunks the myth that the church has an
absurdly long waitlist for weddings.
"I book out to the end of the next calendar year, so unlike
the myths that are floating about, a four-year waiting list
doesn't exist," Cheng said.
At the moment, the furthest wedding she has booked is for
November of 2006. The church is a popular spot for anyone as
sociated with Stanford to get married, even those employed by
Stanford or those who have a family history with the University.
"In order to be married in the Church, couples need to be
eligible under the guidelines stated on our Web site," Cheng
said. "This entails affiliation with Stanford University or with
the Church itself."
Julie Fraser-Smith is a newly wed who is tied to Stanford in
several ways. Not only has she worked at Stanford, managing
grants and contracts from 1992-1995, but her mother received
both her undergraduate and master's degrees from Stanford,
and her father has been a professor here since 1968.
"I actually wanted to get married [at the church] my entire
life," Fraser-Smith said. "Since 1 was a little kid, whenever we
went to visit my dad at work, he'd take us around campus and,
of course, to the church."
However, her fiance had never even see the church until
after the couple decided to hold it there.
"It was so funny, we talked to my parents right after we got
engaged." and Michael [my fiance] was asking how the church
was, Fraser-Smith said. "We tried to explain it to him. how
beautiful it was, and when he got there, he was just awestruck.
He said. 'Yeah, we can definitely have it here!"'
Another future bride-to-be at the church is Julie Kwong,
the fiancee of a medical school graduate. Although she has no
affiliation with the University, she is excited about the
prospect of having her wedding at the church.

"We took some engagement pictures and the photographer
took a lot at the church and on campus and they turned out re
ally beautifully," Kwong said. "We felt that it's really an honor
to be able to get married there. It's such a diverse church, and
it's beautiful, so we feel really grateful to have this opportunity."
Kwong also praised the logistical convenience of having the
service at the church.
"It's hard to find something like this in the Bay Area, and
we're having our banquet at the Faculty Club because it is so
close — it's only a five-minute walk for our guests, and I like
that arrangement," she said.
According to Cheng, the church also provides the services
of the wedding coordinator to oversee the ceremony, the sex
ton to assist the coordinator, the sound technician, the organ
ist and the clergyperson, as well as basic candles, candleabras
and other items used in a wedding. The mandatory wedding
program fee, which includes these services, is approximately
$1,800.
In order to get married at church, the couples are required
to take a compatibility test and engage in premarital counsel
ing. According to the "Wedding Program Guide" on the
church's Web site, the church does not regard the counseling
as an "occasion for 'interrogation,"' but rather as "an oppor
tunity to confirm and strengthen the authenticity of your deci
sion to marry and the quality of your relationship."
"The counseling is more of a starting point for conversa
tion, it's not actually counseling," said Brooke Dooley, who
graduated in 2004 with a degree in chemical engineering.
Some might remember the Mendicants concert last year,
when then-senior Mike Ybarra proposed to Dooley in Cub
berly Auditorium in front of a huge audience.
"The last song they sing is 'Brown-Eyed Girl' and I have
brown eyes!" Dooley reminisced. "Someone else started
soloing the song, but in the middle, they switched and Mike
started singing it, and then he started running down the aisle
to where I was. The microphone cord ran out, and everyone
was standing to watch. And he asked, and of course, I said
'yes!'"
Dooley and Ybarra plan on getting married in July, and
they chose the church because of its personal significance and
its location.
"It's neutral, as our families are from different places, so we
didn't have to choose between our two hometowns," Dooley
said.
"Also, Julie [Cheng] is so sweet, so great to work with,"
Dooley said, who now lives with Ybarra in Virginia and is
planning the wedding long-distance.
"I think the best part of my job is the opportunity to meet
and work with so many different people from different back
grounds," Cheng said. "I really enjoy the continuous learning
process that happens when working with people."
"Also, obviously, the joyous nature of two people pledging

their love for each other in front of their loved ones is really in
spiring and touching," she added.
Couples who marry at Memorial Church said that the loca
tion contributes to the special experience of exchanging vows.
"My fiance's favorite part of the ceremony was when they
opened the doors, and it was my turn to walk down the aisle,
and all the light was coming in from Palo Alto," Fraser-Smith
said. "And he said it looked like an angel was floating down
the aisle, and he was trying so hard not to cry."
"When we said our vows and then lit the unity candle, I
turned around to face the audience," she continued. "I
couldn't believe how beautiful the wedding was. It couldn't
have been more perfect."

the peak of the wedding season, as a marathon that we train for
and complete successfully."
With the nice weather this past weekend, one would imag
ine that the church would have an overflow engaged couples
clamoring fora Saturday afternoon wedding. But oddly
enough, that wasn't the case, with zero weddings scheduled for
the weekend, which debunks the myth that the church has an
absurdly long waitlist for weddings.
"I book out to the end of the next calendar year, so unlike
the myths that are floating about, a four-year waiting list
doesn't exist," Cheng said.
At the moment, the furthest wedding she has booked is for
November of 2006. The church is a popular spot for anyone as
sociated with Stanford to get married, even those employed by
Stanford or those who have a family history with the University.
"In order to be married in the Church, couples need to be
eligible under the guidelines stated on our Web site," Cheng
said. "This entails affiliation with Stanford University or with
the Church itself."
Julie Fraser-Smith is a newly wed who is tied to Stanford in
several ways. Not only has she worked at Stanford, managing
grants and contracts from 1992-1995, but her mother received
both her undergraduate and master's degrees from Stanford,
and her father has been a professor here since 1968.
"I actually wanted to get married [at the church] my entire
life," Fraser-Smith said. "Since 1 was a little kid, whenever we
went to visit my dad at work, he'd take us around campus and,
of course, to the church."
However, her fiance had never even see the church until
after the couple decided to hold it there.
"It was so funny, we talked to my parents right after we got
engaged." and Michael [my fiance] was asking how the church
was, Fraser-Smith said. "We tried to explain it to him. how
beautiful it was, and when he got there, he was just awestruck.
He said. 'Yeah, we can definitely have it here!"'
Another future bride-to-be at the church is Julie Kwong,
the fiancee of a medical school graduate. Although she has no
affiliation with the University, she is excited about the
prospect of having her wedding at the church.

"We took some engagement pictures and the photographer
took a lot at the church and on campus and they turned out re
ally beautifully," Kwong said. "We felt that it's really an honor
to be able to get married there. It's such a diverse church, and
it's beautiful, so we feel really grateful to have this opportunity."
Kwong also praised the logistical convenience of having the
service at the church.
"It's hard to find something like this in the Bay Area, and
we're having our banquet at the Faculty Club because it is so
close — it's only a five-minute walk for our guests, and I like
that arrangement," she said.
According to Cheng, the church also provides the services
of the wedding coordinator to oversee the ceremony, the sex
ton to assist the coordinator, the sound technician, the organ
ist and the clergyperson, as well as basic candles, candleabras
and other items used in a wedding. The mandatory wedding
program fee, which includes these services, is approximately
$1,800.
In order to get married at church, the couples are required
to take a compatibility test and engage in premarital counsel
ing. According to the "Wedding Program Guide" on the
church's Web site, the church does not regard the counseling
as an "occasion for 'interrogation,"' but rather as "an oppor
tunity to confirm and strengthen the authenticity of your deci
sion to marry and the quality of your relationship."
"The counseling is more of a starting point for conversa
tion, it's not actually counseling," said Brooke Dooley, who
graduated in 2004 with a degree in chemical engineering.
Some might remember the Mendicants concert last year,
when then-senior Mike Ybarra proposed to Dooley in Cub
berly Auditorium in front of a huge audience.
"The last song they sing is 'Brown-Eyed Girl' and I have
brown eyes!" Dooley reminisced. "Someone else started
soloing the song, but in the middle, they switched and Mike
started singing it, and then he started running down the aisle
to where I was. The microphone cord ran out, and everyone
was standing to watch. And he asked, and of course, I said
'yes!'"
Dooley and Ybarra plan on getting married in July, and
they chose the church because of its personal significance and
its location.
"It's neutral, as our families are from different places, so we
didn't have to choose between our two hometowns," Dooley
said.
"Also, Julie [Cheng] is so sweet, so great to work with,"
Dooley said, who now lives with Ybarra in Virginia and is
planning the wedding long-distance.
"I think the best part of my job is the opportunity to meet
and work with so many different people from different back
grounds," Cheng said. "I really enjoy the continuous learning
process that happens when working with people."
"Also, obviously, the joyous nature of two people pledging

their love for each other in front of their loved ones is really in
spiring and touching," she added.
Couples who marry at Memorial Church said that the loca
tion contributes to the special experience of exchanging vows.
"My fiance's favorite part of the ceremony was when they
opened the doors, and it was my turn to walk down the aisle,
and all the light was coming in from Palo Alto," Fraser-Smith
said. "And he said it looked like an angel was floating down
the aisle, and he was trying so hard not to cry."
"When we said our vows and then lit the unity candle, I
turned around to face the audience," she continued. "I
couldn't believe how beautiful the wedding was. It couldn't
have been more perfect."

Although Memorial Church is constantly Hooded with a
stream of tourists posing for pictures. On weekends, the
church's halls are filled with the sounds of an organ playing
"Here Comes the Bride."
The church serves as a prime location for couples to get
married. In the past two calendar years, there have been be
tween 110 to 120 weddings at the church.
"There are some crazy Saturdays, as we can have up to four
weddings a day," said Julie Cheng, the wedding coordinator
for the church. "I like to think of the summer months, which is

and complete successfully."
