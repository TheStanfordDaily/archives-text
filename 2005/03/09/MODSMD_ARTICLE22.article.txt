# Too busy for a date? How about one in three minutes?
## 
### EMMA VAUGHN STAFF WRITER 
Everyone complains about the lack of
dating at Stanford. Fewer people actually do
something about it.
Perhaps this is because we're all still think
ing inside the box. Maybe we're linjited by our
concept of what dating is and should be. We
still consider dating to start off with the usual
phone call, followed by dinner and a movie.
But times have changed. We're part of a
new generation geared towards instant grat
ification. We value efficiency, speed and
multi-tasking. So why not apply these same
standards to dating?
The graduate students who planned the
"speed dating" session in the Graduate Com
munity Center last Friday took these ideals
seriously. Their program consisted of 50 men
and women who each went on a total of 25
three-minute dates before the night was over.
On any other day, the recreation room in
the GCC would have looked like any other
rec room — white-washed walls, fold-up
chairs and prison-like windows. But on Fri
day night, the room was transformed into a
dating paradise.
There were five tables, placed in a pen
tagon formation, surrounded by chairs on
each side, so participants could face one an
other. Rose petals and Dove chocolates had
been sprinkled on top of the tables and can
dles were placed around the room.
The organizers placed miniature lamps in
each corner of the room and jazz music
played in the background. There was a cen
ter table covered with various sweets and
more than 20 bottles of wine.
The atmosphere was slightly romantic,
yet somewhat awkward.
I walked in half an hour early and was in

stantly identified as the reporter. I don't
know what about me screamed "undergrad
and Daily writer," hut the possibility of
blending in looked pretty slim.
1 immediately began to help out. attempt
ing to diffuse my image as the sketchy jour
nalist who would expose their identities and
secrets to the undergraduate community. As
people started to trickle in, the room filled
with the hum of nervous conversation.
By 9 p.m.. all of the participants had ar

rived and were assigned seats. There were 26
men and 24 women, which meant that I was
able to take one of the open female spots.
We had three minutes to talk to each person
and then the bell would sound and the men
would have to move one spot to the left to go
on their next date.
At every seat there was a check list with
all the participants' names and short bios.
The idea was that if you liked someone, you
would put a check by their name, and if you

did not like him or her, you would leave it
blank. At the end of the night, you would get
the contact information of every participant
that you checked and checked you back.
1 sat down across from participant number
24, and tried to think of possible conversation
topics. There was nothing about him that im
mediately set him apart from an undergrad.
In Diesel jeans and an Urban Outfitters T
shirt, he looked like a pretty normal guy.
Like most of the men I met that night, he
was in the engineering department, which is
known for its 8 to 1 ratio of men to women. His
reasons for attending the program paralleled
much of what I heard throughout the night.
"In the graduate community you really
don't meet people easily," he said. "You're
pretty confined to your department, and in
terms of dating that can be rough. You go to
an engineering party and it consists of little
pods of men surrounding one woman."
He argued that living circumstances also
made meeting women difficult. Most gradu
ate students either live off-campus or in Es
condido Village, which is a collection of sep
arate apartments. There are no dorm trips or
house events that bring people together in a
social context.
"It's hard because I feel so much more
connected to the undergrads," said one fe
male co-term participant. "I thought that this
event would be a good way to become more
part of the grad student world."
Many of the students said that the last
speed dating event last quarter, organized by
Lyman graduate residences, really helped to
fill some of these social gaps.
"I got three great dates out of it," said one
participant. "One of them turned into a sub
stantial relationship."

When asked why he was at the
event it he was already dating some
one, he shrugged and said. "I already
signed up for this event and we're
not that serious."
By the time I had finished live
conversations, my voice was gone
and it was painful to smile. 1 looked
down the line, and realized that I was
only one-fifth of the way through.
All of the guys had been pleasant
and interesting, but asking multiple
people the same questions was ex
hausting. When I got to participant
number 16,1 was snapped out of my
trance by his accusatory tone.
"So you're the reporter," he said.
"Are you now going to go back and

report thai grad students are even
sketchier? Like we don't have to
deal with that enough."
This was a theme I dealt with all
night. 1 found myself struggling to
defend the undergrad opinion of
grad students. I assured him that not
everyone thought all grad students
were sketchy, hut it was just the oc
casional rub at a party or awkward
moment in the CoHo that gave them
a had name.
"I don't blame |the undergrads],"
said participant 13. "If I was an un
dergrad girl and saw five engineering
grad students coming at me at a party.
I would probably run. You just have
to realize that we're not all like that."
Many of the participants were en
thusiastic about shedding the
"sketchy grad student" image and
mixing with undergraduates more
often.
"I think the sketchy image is a

myth that actually hurts the under
grads," said one participant, who is
currently casually dating an under
graduate. "If you think about it,
we're smarter, we're older and we're
poised to make more money. Under
grad guys are barely over puberty. It
would be to the girl's advantage to
consider us."
By the time the night came to end,
I had promised my speed dates that 1
would try and set up more events to
mix undergrads with grad students.
At the very least, undergrads should
take note — the concept of speed
dating is an ingenious, time-saving
and effective way to meet the maxi
mum amount of single people in a
limited amount of time.
So next time, instead of RAs
planning summer camp-like events
for their residents, perhaps they
should introduce students to the new
version of campus dating.
