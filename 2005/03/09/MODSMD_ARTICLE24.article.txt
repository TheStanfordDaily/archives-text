## Falling for your best friend — tips of the trade 
### 
We've all been there. You have a
friend of the opposite sex, with
whom you are purportedly just
friends, but with whom you are pret
ty much obsessed. He calls you all
the time, you go on errands together
that feel suspiciously date-ish and
sometimes you have conversations
with him that seem to be thinly
veiled discussions about how you
are ultimately meant to be together.
At some point in this relation
ship, you will probably confess your
undying love for him or her and/or
try to hook up with them. You will
probably be drunk when you do this.
They will probably reject you, in a
very unsexy way, and your friend
ship will probably never be the
same.

This is a
very common
thing, at least
as far as I can
tell. In his
book "Sex,
Drugs, and
Cocoa Puffs,"
Chuck
Klosterman
addresses this
issue, using
the movie
"When Harry

Met Sally," or "WHMS," as an ex
ample.
Klosterman says that "WHMS"
"cements" the concept that "two
platonic acquaintances are refusing
to admit that they're deeply in love
with each other." The problem, of
course, is that this is usually not the
case. Usually it's more like "My Best
Friend's Wedding," when Julia
Roberts' best friend leaves her in
the lurch for the bubblier and less
psychotic Cameron Diaz.
Klosterman, I suspect, has never
fallen for his best friend. He doesn't
understand the powerful pull that
that kind of relationship can have.
It's not that you're falling for your
friends all the time — but you fall
for the friend with whom you have a
suspiciously pseudo-platonic rela
tionship. You can talk to them about
anything, and if only they were at
tracted to you, it would be perfect.
In reality, this relationship isn't
perfect, fora lot of reasons. The
most potent of these is that you are
inventing a relationship in your
head that doesn't actually exist.
Ever since you met him or her,
you've probably been holding back
parts of yourself, trying to impress
this person — which means that you
were never truly friends in the first
place and the fantasy doesn't even
apply. Since you met him or her and
found them attractive, you have
thought in the back of your head,
"Wow, it would be cool if this could
turn out like 'WHMS.' Someday he
or she will realize that we are meant
to be."
That's not what real friendship is.
Of course, you're probably not
really listening to what I'm saying
here because you want to believe
that your relationship is different. It
may be. Either way, the crux of the
issue is that you can't keep being
friends with someone and wanting
to make out with him or her at the
same time. It's going to come to a
breaking point, and you're going to
want to tell the other person how
you feel.
A wise friend once told me that
before you tell your friend that you
want to take it to the next level, you
need to ask yourself three questions:
First, is it worth it? Is it worth
risking the friendship, which could
very well be one of the best friend
ships you have?
Second, would it be weird? Can
you imagine kissing this person?
This is probably not that scary. But
can you imagine having sex with this
person?
Finally, would it last? Does this
have the potential to actually be a
functional, lasting relationship, or
would it devolve into a couple of
hook ups that forever change the na
ture of your friendship?
If you've answered these ques
tions and you think it's worth the
risk, then I say go for it. You might
be lucky. You might get to have a cli
mactic moment with your best
friend on New Year's Eve with bad
lip gloss and 80s clothing.
As for me, my experience with
this situation has been less than
lucky. I've experienced some post
teen angst and I've watched
"WHMS" a few too many times for
my own good. I've had to re-be
friend my "friends" again, in a new
context, without the expectation
that someday, he, too, would realize
we were meant to be.
Now, I'm entirely happy being
real friends with these people and I
reserve my "falling in love with your
friend" fantasy for film.
