## An Ounce of Prevention Stellar Suggestions for survival over spring break 
### 
What do alcohol, tanning, random
hookups and studying for the MCAT
have in common?
All of these things tend to occur
concurrently and in excess amounts
during spring break.
The official purpose of this much
anticipated week after winter quarter
finals is to give students a chance to

relax and regenerate
before taking on a
brand new set of
academic commit
ment. Ironically,
after spring break
many of us come
back to campus no
less exhausted than
we were during fi
nals — nonstop par-

tying can be as drain
ing to health as nonstop studying.
Not surprisingly, alcohol abuse pre
sents the main spring break health con
cern. According to a study published in
the Journal of American College
Health, the average number of drinks
consumed per day during spring break
is 18 for men and 10 for women.
While these numbers may seem in
flated to Stanford students who are not
accustomed to the MTV Spring Break
saturnalia, even the most responsible
of us tend to let our alcohol guards
down during the post-finals haze.
Although there is no reason not to
celebrate the end of exams with a mar
garita or two, it is wise to watch out for
yourself and your friends — after all,
there is no spring break activity that is
less fun than a visit to the ER.
In a world of cheap booze and string
bikinis, unplanned hookups are as
common as the inflatable Corona bot
tle as a party decoration. Nevertheless,
unplanned does not have to equal un
protected — go pick up your quarterly
allowance of twelve condoms at the
Sexual Health Peer Resource Center,
and you'll be ready for some safe and
memorable spring break action.
Just like alcohol, the sun is not al
ways your friend. As tempting as it may
be to spend hours on the beach trying
to reach that perfect shade of brown,
excessive tanning without sunscreen is
unsafe (not to mention painful). Get
over your sunscreen phobia: a high SPF
value does not prevent tanning, but it
does protect against the harmful UV
rays that cause skin cancer.
Not all Stanford students intend to
spend spring break partying it up south
of the border or in a tropical island par
adise. Locked up in lab, I myself will be
dreaming of ocean waves and my SPF
45 lotion while trying to finally finish
collecting data for my honors thesis.
If you are stuck in a similar situa
tion, don't despair — there are plenty
of ways to relax and enjoy the splendid
weather without leaving the Farm. Re
sist the temptation to read ahead for
classes or stress over the rapidly ap
proaching MCAT; this is the perfect
time to catch your breath and regroup.
Junior Zaw Lin Hteik, who is stay
ing on campus over the break, plans to
use this time to catch up on his sleep
and errands.
"I am going to spend half of it doing
things that I have been putting off dur
ing the quarter: filing taxes, going to
the DMV and buying my plane ticket
to go back home for the summer."
Hteik said. "Aside from that, I just
hope to relax on campus and read out
side under the sun."
Several groups of undergraduates
will spend the last week of March doing
volunteer work as part of Alternative
Spring Break. Sponsored by the Haas
Center for Public Service, the ASB web
site says it offers students "the chance to
go beyond the ivory tower to explore
and learn about societal issues through
various hands-on service experiences."
Each trip focuses on a particular
issue or community, with topics rang
ing from "Femmes Forward: Women
and Social Change in San Francisco" to
"The Real World: Hawai'i."
ASB is a great example of creative
spring break planning. After all, there
may be a happy medium between alco
hol-drenched paradise and sloth-like
existence on the couch.
God bless the quarter system. Unlike
our less lucky counterparts at Cal and at
the Ivies, we don't have to spend spring
break desperately trying to catch up for
classes. Free of homework and extracur
ricular commitments, we can actually af
ford to slow down, de-stress and relax.
Don't waste this opportunity —
spring quarter is just around the cor
ner, and you'll need all the energy you
can get to convince yourself to go to
class in perfect 90 degree weather.
Good luck on finals and have a
healthy, blissful, rejuvenating spring
break!
