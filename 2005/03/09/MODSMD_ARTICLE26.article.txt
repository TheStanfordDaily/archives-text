# The 						ultimate balancing act: classes, activities...
## and a love life 
### TINA HAN 
Spring is (almost) here and love is in the
air — that's the saying, right?
Well, maybe not quite on the Farm, where
some students say they find difficult to manage
a romantic relationship or even a spring lling.
A full course load — and for some that
means more than 20 units — in a quarter sys
tem often means that students deal with mul
tiple sets of midterms before Finals Week
hits. Add an extracurricular activity (or two
or three or even four — there are more than
S(H) registered student organizations on cam
pus) and you may not have time fora girl
friend or boyfriend. And let's not forget that
any relationship takes work; it can be the
equivalent of a five-unit course.
But let's also not forget that as time-con
suming as a relationship can be, it can be — at
least you'll hope — enjoyable and enriching.
And if you're willing to put in the work and
effort, even the busiest of Stanford students
should be able to balance a relationship with
schoolwork and other commitments.
"A relationship at Stanford does interfere
with schoolwork in the sense that you have to
really make time for the relationship," said ju
nior Pey-Jiun Ko. "But in a way, it is just like
making time for anything else."
"It is at time hard to arrange school with
life, but in the end, you'll always find a way to
manage," said sophomore Tai-Jin Lee.
Some students say that the personal bene
fits of being in a relationship balance out the
possible complications brought on by the extra
time commitment and emotional investment.
"Although there are disagreements some
times, it is worth it because it gives me com
panionship, someone who I can talk to and
someone who is almost like another best
friend," Ko said. "And plus, being in a rela
tionship means that there will always be some

one who is obliged to listen to me complain."
For students in committed relationships
there are many stressors that can make rela
tionships difficult to maintain, particularly in
a college environment. While there isn't one
consistent problem that are tied to college re
lationship, though some that may be more
frequent are issues of jealously, academic
competition and time management. Learning
how to deal with these issues (and more) is
the key to a healthy relationship.
" There isn't one single issue that comes up
in connection with relationships but once
people are in relationships, they must learn
how to deal with conflict," said Dr. Alejandro
Martinez, director of Counseling and Psycho
logical Services at Vaden Student Health
Center. "They must identify what the conflict
is about. The two people involved must be
willing to talk about their feelings in order to
deal with conflict."
One cause of stress in romantic relation
ships can arise when the two people involved
have different social circles. Cancelled dinner
plans, forgotten study sessions and postponed
lunch dates can be a source of friction when
friendships are forsaken for relationships.
For some students, this tension is difficult
to avoid.
" People oftentimes have to sacrifice some
thing fora relationship to work and that usu
ally comes at the expense of friendships," said
junior Lisa Higson.
Another common problem in relationships
is jealousy. Whether it is fear of outside rela
tionships or envy at academic performance,
this is an issue that some couples must confront.
"1 definitely think that there are jealousy
issues between people in relationships," said
junior Morin Oluwole. "It could stem from
some sort of personal insecurity that is inflict
ed and projected upon the other person in the
relationship."

No matter the cause of relationship strain,
Martinez said the most important way to
maintain a healthy relationship is through
good communication.
"A lot of things can shape a healthy and
positive relationship hut one of the most criti
cal is communication and the willingness to
talk about what each person is feeling." he
said. "Stanford's demands create a lot of com
petition in a relationship. It can be difficult to
sustain a relationship without putting in time
and working on communication."
Although on-campus relationships can
suffer from a number of different issues, some
students say that long-distance relationships
can be even more vulnerable. In particular,
challenges can arise from the effort required
for both people to keep each other updated
on their lives.
"Long-distance relationships are difficult
because problems can occur even from con
versations," said junior Dawn Butler. "A lot
of time is spent on just describing for the
other person what happened before you can
start describing how you feel about the things
that are going on in life."
In addition to communication problems,
long-distance relationships can increase so
cial isolation for some people in their on-cam
pus relationships.
"Long-distance relationships definitely af
fect you more socially than academically be
cause instead of being out participating in
events and meeting more people, you're al
ways on the phone talking to the other per
son," Butler said. "Some long-distance rela-

tionships can be socially
damaging because they end
up being more exclusive, es
pecially when it is a serious
relationship."
One of the largest prob
lems related to romantic rela-

tionships is the emotional damage that results
from a breakup. In this case, Martinez said it
can be helpful to remember the significance of
interpersonal relationships other than roman
tic relationships.
"In order to successfully deal with
breakups, we have to appreciate how pro
foundly we each deal with relationships." he
said. "One way of dealing with breakups is to
reach out for support from friends and the peo
ple who care about us. Another way is to do
things that support our well-being like partici
pation in social activities with friends."
"The key is to stay connected with other
individuals and not to deal with things
alone," he added.
In order to deal with and solve certain re
lationship problems, residence peer health
educators are trained to listen to students talk
about personal problems, although their
training does not necessarily focus on roman
tic relationships.
"Whenever I'm faced with relationship
problems from my residents, I generally listen
to what their situation is and try to suggest
how they can rationally approach their situa
tion," said junior Dina Contreras, a peer
health educator in Serra. "A lot of it is just
being here to listen."
"We did not receive training specifically
on dealing with relationship problems but we
did get training on how to talk to residents
when they have issues. Sometimes my resi
dents come seeking help, when all they really
need is someone to listen as they think out
their problems aloud," she concluded.
