# Spotting and treating eating disorders
## 
### ILENA GEORGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While many students stay healthy hy exercising regularly
and eating well, some can take these to extremes. Where do
you draw the line between being health conscious, having dis
ordered eating and suffering from an eating disorder?
"I believe that there are many more students suffering
from eating disorders than we see at Vaden," wrote Dr.
Robyn Tepper, the chief physician of Medical Services at
Vaden Student Health Center, in an email to the Daily.
"We see all types of disorders: anorexia, bulimia, binge eat
ing and orthorexia (overexercise)," Tepper wrote. "Some we
diagnose in a routine visit because of loss of menstrual peri
ods, low pulse, low body temperature and weight, or BMI
(body mass index), stress fractures, overuse injuries, stomach
problems, swollen salivary glands, etc."
A Nov. 30,2004 article in the New York Times reported that
some people with disordered eating are unable to obtain appro
priate treatment because they do not fit into the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM IV, criteria for
anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa — the only two eating
disorders listed. This is not the case at Vaden. Tepper explained.
"The bottom line is that, at Vaden. we focus both on the pre
vention and treatment of significant illness," she wrote. "A stu
dent does not need to meet the criteria of a severe, well-defined
disease in order to get attention or services. A large part of our
mission is to educate students to prevent problems down the
road, as well as care for those that are already ill."
"The barriers to care are not insignificant, but they are not a
result of DSM criteria. The real obstacles for care are often that
the patient is not ready for help or that our resources are so lim
ited that getting services may be difficult," she added.
According to the DSM IV, anorexia nervosa has four crite
ria for clinical diagnosis: a body weight of more than 15 percent
below ideal body weight, a fear of weight gain, amenorrhea (a
cessation of menstruation) for more than three months and a
psychological condition in which body image is the principal
measure of self-worth and in which there is a denial of the se
riousness of the illness. Anorexia nervosa is divided into two
types: restricting eating and binge eating / purging.
Bulimia nervosa includes a process in which hinge eating is
coupled with a form of compensation for the hinging. This oc
curs either through purging behavior — using laxatives or di
uretics or by inducing vomiting — or through non-purging be
havior such as exercise, fasting or severe diets.
Binging and purging must occur at least twice a week for
three months to qualify as a mental disorder in the DSM IV.

As with anorexia nervosa, there is also dissatisfaction with
body shape and weight.
The most challenging part about diagnosing and treating
an eating disorder, Tepper explained, is getting people to
admit that there is a problem.
"Some patients will deny that there is a problem and it is
difficult or impossible to treat someone when they are in de
nial or just not ready to get help" she wrote.
When someone is ready to receive treatment, there are dif
ferent options depending on the type and severity of the prob
lem.
"Some students see a counselor first, some a dietician first
and some come to the attention of a clinician in Medical Ser
vices," Tepper wrote. "For more serious cases, it helps tremen
dously fora student to be supported by all three services. How
ever, because of limited resources, or the severity of an illness,
we sometimes have to refer students for outside care."
Vivian Crisman is Vaden's only dietician and works only
part-time nine months of the year. Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services, or CAPS, has limited appointments and does main
ly short-term therapy, even though serious eating disorders
often involve more long-term therapy, according to Tepper.
Some residential staff members said they think students on
campus are aware of these issues.
"Stanford places a lot of emphasis on dealing with disordered
eating," said senior C.B. Buente, a resident assistant in Lambda
Nu. "Basically, disordered eating is seen as not being healthy. If
people are not being healthy, that needs to be addressed."
"There is definitely a lot of emphasis on education and bat
tling misconceptions. [During in-staff training,] they definite
ly encourage you to send [residents] to the Vaden nutritionist
and otherwise get them help," he added.
Buente said that RAs are given formal training in address
ing disordered eating.
"Most of it is common sense," he said, "You look at rapid
weight loss, people going to the bathroom directly after meals,
people eating very small portions or cutting out weird food
groups, people eating in weird patterns such people eating a
lot — more than seems normal — or people talking about
earning their food [they have to work out in order to allow
themselves to eat]."
He added that RAs are trained to regard any kind of diet
ing as problematic, explaining that there is a significant
amount of literature available showing that dieting is not a
healthy choice for college students.
Tepper described disordered eating as hazardous, in that it
"can certainly be a precursor to a full-blown eating disorder."
To help treat or stop disordered eating, Tepper wrote, "some

students benefit from a visit to Vivian [Crisman | so that she can
point out where their dietary habits are unhealthy (like cutting
out all carbs). where they may engage in false beliefs and pint
bias (like all fat is bad) or where they are missing important nu
trients (like calcium) because of disordered eating."
Helping a friend that may have an eating disorder or may
suffer from disordered eating can also be difficult, particular
ly when he or she is reluctant to seek help. Tepper wrote.
"I have had patients admit to me that they kept starving
themselves because no one noticed," Tepper wrote. "My
guess is that many people noticed, but did not confront them,
because it is a very difficult thing to do."
Tepper mentioned that there are several resources beyond
CAPS that are available on campus for people with eating dis
orders or for their friends. These include MIRROR. a student
group related to the Bridge Peer Counseling Center that pro
vides education and support regarding issues surrounding eat
ing disorders, as well as R As, peer health educators and resi
dence deans.
When it comes to services related to the treatment of eat
ing disorders, some students have found the services at CAPS
and Medical Services at Vaden to be invaluable.
"1 have had friends tell me that of all the services CAPS
provides, the treatment they provide for eating disorders is
one of their best resources," said junior Lindsay Mecca.

Robyn Tepper, the chief physician of Medical Services at
Vaden Student Health Center, in an email to the Daily.
"We see all types of disorders: anorexia, bulimia, binge eat
ing and orthorexia (overexercise)," Tepper wrote. "Some we
diagnose in a routine visit because of loss of menstrual peri
ods, low pulse, low body temperature and weight, or BMI
(body mass index), stress fractures, overuse injuries, stomach
problems, swollen salivary glands, etc."
A Nov. 30,2004 article in the New York Times reported that
some people with disordered eating are unable to obtain appro
priate treatment because they do not fit into the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM IV, criteria for
anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa — the only two eating
disorders listed. This is not the case at Vaden. Tepper explained.
"The bottom line is that, at Vaden. we focus both on the pre
vention and treatment of significant illness," she wrote. "A stu
dent does not need to meet the criteria of a severe, well-defined
disease in order to get attention or services. A large part of our
mission is to educate students to prevent problems down the
road, as well as care for those that are already ill."
"The barriers to care are not insignificant, but they are not a
result of DSM criteria. The real obstacles for care are often that
the patient is not ready for help or that our resources are so lim
ited that getting services may be difficult," she added.
According to the DSM IV, anorexia nervosa has four crite
ria for clinical diagnosis: a body weight of more than 15 percent
below ideal body weight, a fear of weight gain, amenorrhea (a
cessation of menstruation) for more than three months and a
psychological condition in which body image is the principal
measure of self-worth and in which there is a denial of the se
riousness of the illness. Anorexia nervosa is divided into two
types: restricting eating and binge eating / purging.
Bulimia nervosa includes a process in which hinge eating is
coupled with a form of compensation for the hinging. This oc
curs either through purging behavior — using laxatives or di
uretics or by inducing vomiting — or through non-purging be
havior such as exercise, fasting or severe diets.
Binging and purging must occur at least twice a week for
three months to qualify as a mental disorder in the DSM IV.

As with anorexia nervosa, there is also dissatisfaction with
body shape and weight.
The most challenging part about diagnosing and treating
an eating disorder, Tepper explained, is getting people to
admit that there is a problem.
"Some patients will deny that there is a problem and it is
difficult or impossible to treat someone when they are in de
nial or just not ready to get help" she wrote.
When someone is ready to receive treatment, there are dif
ferent options depending on the type and severity of the prob
lem.
"Some students see a counselor first, some a dietician first
and some come to the attention of a clinician in Medical Ser
vices," Tepper wrote. "For more serious cases, it helps tremen
dously fora student to be supported by all three services. How
ever, because of limited resources, or the severity of an illness,
we sometimes have to refer students for outside care."
Vivian Crisman is Vaden's only dietician and works only
part-time nine months of the year. Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services, or CAPS, has limited appointments and does main
ly short-term therapy, even though serious eating disorders
often involve more long-term therapy, according to Tepper.
Some residential staff members said they think students on
campus are aware of these issues.
"Stanford places a lot of emphasis on dealing with disordered
eating," said senior C.B. Buente, a resident assistant in Lambda
Nu. "Basically, disordered eating is seen as not being healthy. If
people are not being healthy, that needs to be addressed."
"There is definitely a lot of emphasis on education and bat
tling misconceptions. [During in-staff training,] they definite
ly encourage you to send [residents] to the Vaden nutritionist
and otherwise get them help," he added.
Buente said that RAs are given formal training in address
ing disordered eating.
"Most of it is common sense," he said, "You look at rapid
weight loss, people going to the bathroom directly after meals,
people eating very small portions or cutting out weird food
groups, people eating in weird patterns such people eating a
lot — more than seems normal — or people talking about
earning their food [they have to work out in order to allow
themselves to eat]."
He added that RAs are trained to regard any kind of diet
ing as problematic, explaining that there is a significant
amount of literature available showing that dieting is not a
healthy choice for college students.
Tepper described disordered eating as hazardous, in that it
"can certainly be a precursor to a full-blown eating disorder."
To help treat or stop disordered eating, Tepper wrote, "some

students benefit from a visit to Vivian [Crisman | so that she can
point out where their dietary habits are unhealthy (like cutting
out all carbs). where they may engage in false beliefs and pint
bias (like all fat is bad) or where they are missing important nu
trients (like calcium) because of disordered eating."
Helping a friend that may have an eating disorder or may
suffer from disordered eating can also be difficult, particular
ly when he or she is reluctant to seek help. Tepper wrote.
"I have had patients admit to me that they kept starving
themselves because no one noticed," Tepper wrote. "My
guess is that many people noticed, but did not confront them,
because it is a very difficult thing to do."
Tepper mentioned that there are several resources beyond
CAPS that are available on campus for people with eating dis
orders or for their friends. These include MIRROR. a student
group related to the Bridge Peer Counseling Center that pro
vides education and support regarding issues surrounding eat
ing disorders, as well as R As, peer health educators and resi
dence deans.
When it comes to services related to the treatment of eat
ing disorders, some students have found the services at CAPS
and Medical Services at Vaden to be invaluable.
"1 have had friends tell me that of all the services CAPS
provides, the treatment they provide for eating disorders is
one of their best resources," said junior Lindsay Mecca.
While many students stay healthy hy exercising regularly
and eating well, some can take these to extremes. Where do
you draw the line between being health conscious, having dis
ordered eating and suffering from an eating disorder?
