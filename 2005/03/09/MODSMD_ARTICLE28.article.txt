## Social Innovation Injustice, action and social change: our three favorite NGOs 
### 
United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan has described non-governmental orga
nizations (NGOs) as "the conscience of hu
manity." NGOs address every issue imaginable
and they operate in every country in the world.
Non-profit multi-national organizations
range in size, structure and purpose. But they
are all mission-driven, broadly representative
and full of the potential to catalyze massive sys
temic change. They're present on both sides of
every conflict, and they're not risk-averse.
Below are our three favorite NGOs — who
they are, what they do and why we think they're
so great.

Despite what
Adam learned in
philosophy class,
Descartes is not the
only good thing to
come out of France.
In 1971. a group of
French doctors
founded the first
non-military NGO
to specialize in
emergency medical
assistance. They
call themselves
Medecins Sans

Frontieres (MSF), but we know them as Doc
tors without Borders.
MSF is different from other international
health and humanitarian aid NGOs because it
acts as a witness "and will speak out, either in
private or in public about the plight of popula
tions in danger," according to MSF's Web site.
Part of the organization's mission is to "alle
viate human suffering," so it is willing to go to
great lengths to protect life and health in the
communities it serves by raising awareness of
the issues, concerns and crises that MSF volun
teers encounter.
According to its mission, MSF offers assis
tance "without discrimination and irrespective
of race, religion, creed or political affiliation." It
is unfortunate that other large aid organizations,
such as the International Red Cross, have not
adopted this same set of guiding principles.
Where there is a medical need, MSF is there —
no matter where you're from, what you've done,
what you look like or who you're fighting for.
We're not the only ones who think they're
great: The Norwegian Nobel Committee
awarded MSF the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999.
(Most people seem to be over the whole Rigob
erta Menchu thing by now.)
According to the World Bank, almost half of
the people in the world today are under 25
years old. and nine out of 10 of these young
people live in developing countries without
proper access to food, water, education, shelter
or healthcare. If the children are our future,
what does it mean when 90 percent of children
suffer from malnourishment, disease, lack of
education, violence and political unrest?
Save the Children is group that attempts to
address these issues. It is a leading internation
al relief and development organization work
ing in more than 45 countries to provide com
munities with "a hand up, not a handout."
It was started in 1932, when a group of citi
zens gathered in New York to respond to the
needs of populations who had been hit by the
Great Depression. Save the Children's ap
proach is to work with families to define and
solve the problems their children and commu
nities face by "utilizing a broad array of strate
gies to ensure self-sufficiency."
Today, this organization's empowering ini
tiatives are innovative and efficient, earning it
the 1993 National Volunteer Action Award
presented by former President Bill Clinton.
In 1978, in the midst of the Cold War,
Human Rights Watch (HRW) was founded as
Helsinki Watch to monitor the observance of
Soviet countries with the human rights provi
sions of the Helsinki Accords.
In 1988, the several "watch" committees that
had formed around the world officially banded
together to form HRW. There are a lot of think
tanks out there, and a lot of advocacy groups,
but HRW is a rare, efficient hybrid of the two.
Human Rights Watch researchers conduct
fact-finding investigations into human rights
abuses around the world. Then HRW publish
es the findings in books and reports, generating
local and international media attention that
"helps to embarrass abusive governments in
the eyes of their citizens and the world." ac
cording to HRW's Web site.
Human Rights Watch then takes the next
step and meets with government officials across
the world to urge changes in policy and practice.
In order to maintain independence and ac
curacy. HRW does not accept governmental
donations, neither directly nor indirectly. Their
steadfast dedication to the pursuit of justice
and truth has brought some of the world's worst
human rights violators to the scrutiny of the in
ternational public.
International advocacy networks have im
mense potential and power. For instance,
NGOs have been invaluable in the struggles for
women's suffrage and the collapse of
apartheid. MSF, Save the Children and HRW
are three prime examples of successful NGOs
that are truly changing the world. They have
created innovative ways to mobilize resources
and band together communities with only one
common denominator: The need and pursuit of
systemic change.

Frontieres (MSF), but we know them as Doc
tors without Borders.
MSF is different from other international
health and humanitarian aid NGOs because it
acts as a witness "and will speak out, either in
private or in public about the plight of popula
tions in danger," according to MSF's Web site.
Part of the organization's mission is to "alle
viate human suffering," so it is willing to go to
great lengths to protect life and health in the
communities it serves by raising awareness of
the issues, concerns and crises that MSF volun
teers encounter.
According to its mission, MSF offers assis
tance "without discrimination and irrespective
of race, religion, creed or political affiliation." It
is unfortunate that other large aid organizations,
such as the International Red Cross, have not
adopted this same set of guiding principles.
Where there is a medical need, MSF is there —
no matter where you're from, what you've done,
what you look like or who you're fighting for.
We're not the only ones who think they're
great: The Norwegian Nobel Committee
awarded MSF the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999.
(Most people seem to be over the whole Rigob
erta Menchu thing by now.)
According to the World Bank, almost half of
the people in the world today are under 25
years old. and nine out of 10 of these young
people live in developing countries without
proper access to food, water, education, shelter
or healthcare. If the children are our future,
what does it mean when 90 percent of children
suffer from malnourishment, disease, lack of
education, violence and political unrest?
Save the Children is group that attempts to
address these issues. It is a leading internation
al relief and development organization work
ing in more than 45 countries to provide com
munities with "a hand up, not a handout."
It was started in 1932, when a group of citi
zens gathered in New York to respond to the
needs of populations who had been hit by the
Great Depression. Save the Children's ap
proach is to work with families to define and
solve the problems their children and commu
nities face by "utilizing a broad array of strate
gies to ensure self-sufficiency."
Today, this organization's empowering ini
tiatives are innovative and efficient, earning it
the 1993 National Volunteer Action Award
presented by former President Bill Clinton.
In 1978, in the midst of the Cold War,
Human Rights Watch (HRW) was founded as
Helsinki Watch to monitor the observance of
Soviet countries with the human rights provi
sions of the Helsinki Accords.
In 1988, the several "watch" committees that
had formed around the world officially banded
together to form HRW. There are a lot of think
tanks out there, and a lot of advocacy groups,
but HRW is a rare, efficient hybrid of the two.
Human Rights Watch researchers conduct
fact-finding investigations into human rights
abuses around the world. Then HRW publish
es the findings in books and reports, generating
local and international media attention that
"helps to embarrass abusive governments in
the eyes of their citizens and the world." ac
cording to HRW's Web site.
Human Rights Watch then takes the next
step and meets with government officials across
the world to urge changes in policy and practice.
In order to maintain independence and ac
curacy. HRW does not accept governmental
donations, neither directly nor indirectly. Their
steadfast dedication to the pursuit of justice
and truth has brought some of the world's worst
human rights violators to the scrutiny of the in
ternational public.
International advocacy networks have im
mense potential and power. For instance,
NGOs have been invaluable in the struggles for
women's suffrage and the collapse of
apartheid. MSF, Save the Children and HRW
are three prime examples of successful NGOs
that are truly changing the world. They have
created innovative ways to mobilize resources
and band together communities with only one
common denominator: The need and pursuit of
systemic change.
