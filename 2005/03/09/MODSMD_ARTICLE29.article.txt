It's fun. It has the potential to be fi
nancially rewarding. It takes a bit of luck
and a lot of strategy.
It's online poker.
Online poker is steadily gaining popu
larity in both the United States and
abroad, especially among college-aged
males. Web sites are organizing online
tournaments that offer real cash prizes.
Royal Vegas Poker, one of the most
popular poker Web sites for college stu
dents, is sponsoring the College Poker
Championship to crown the best colle
giate No-Limit Texas Hold'em player in
the world in May 2005, with over $100,000
in scholarships at stake for entrants.
Three additional Web sites — Abso
lute Poker, Empire Poker and True
Poker — are all connected to the presti
gious World Series of Poker, to be held
from June 3 to July 15 in Las Vegas. And
several other online poker rooms are set
ting up tournaments to garner publicity
for their Web sites.
Why do people play online poker? Isn't
it more fun to play with friends? Accord
ing to one Stanford student who requested
to remain anonymous, that isn't the case.
"It's more efficient to play online," he
said. "You'd feel bad about winning $50
from a friend, but you wouldn't care about
taking that money from a stranger."
The online version of the game also
makes it easier for newcomers to learn
the rules.
"I used to play poker all the time with
my friends," said freshman Greg New
man. "It's a fun game. I watched this guy
in my dorm playing [online poker] a cou
ple of times and decided to try it myself."
For an online poker beginner, there
are several things to learn. Online poker
has four key parts: the Web site, the
client, the game server and the players.
The Web site gives information on what
games can be played, the rules of each
game and upcoming events. Players can
also download the poker game client,
which connects players to the site's poker
game server. The server is actually a central
computer that acts as a dealer. Each player
sits behind his or her own computer and
watches the game unfold on the Internet.
So, the big question is: Can players win
real money? The answer is a resounding
yes.
"My friend and I have won about $500
already, but this kid we know has basically
won his college tuition," Newman said. "If
[my friend and I] had played a little more
strategy, we'd be making big bucks, too."
But one does not have to play for real
money. Players can choose to bet play

money. When a player first begins a game,
he or she can sign up fora certain number
of "play" chips. In the event that they lose
all of their chips, players can ask for more,
but some Web sites put a maximum on the
number of times one can stock up.
Playing for real money is highly risky.
When playing for real money, the player
bets his or her own dollars, and depend
ing on the Web site used, the stakes can
be quite high.
Some Web sites allow users to choose
his or her minimum bet, meaning one can
bet as little as a penny. Other sites enforce
a minimum; sometimes this can be hun
dreds of dollars. These Web sites often
profit from a "rake" situation, which is
when poker games end without a winner.
Playing with real money involves an
other risk. Before Web betting with real
money at a Web site, a deposit is often re
quired. While some sites have excellent
track records, others have been known to
never return players' money after col
lapsing as an organization, according to
Thepokerproject.com.
Knowing if a Web site is trustworthy
can get extremely tricky because Web
sites often lure users in with various pro
motions. However, a Web site's popular
ity, game variety and financial reputation
are key factors in determining which
client players will want to download. In
addition, some Web sites feature loyalty
programs, such as frequent player points,
with which users can enter tournaments
or buy merchandise.
But not all students are eager to place
their bets. Junior ChenLi Wang said that
online poker is a waste of time and money.
"There's a concern surrounding the
business outfit," Wang said. "Many of
these online sites are based in question
able countries — countries that lack laws
that prosecute these operations [if these
sites happen to fail]."
There are many poker Web sites
available for exploration. www.Pok
erListings.com ranks the online poker
rooms according to game variety, deposit
and withdrawal options, software and
graphics, ring game traffic, tournament
traffic, rake, sign up bonus, loyalty
bonus, promotions and financial securi
ty. According to Poker Listings, the top
three Web sites are Ultimate Bet, Pacific
Poker and Party Poker.
Each of these Web sites offers an array
of games. Texas Hold'em is the most pop
ular of online poker games and every
poker room offers it. Omaha and Omaha
Hi-Low, two games comparable to Texas
Hold'em. also attract a large audience.
Seven-Card Stud and Five-Card Draw
are more traditional poker games, but are
still fancied on the Internet.

the world in May 2005, with over $100,000
in scholarships at stake for entrants.
Three additional Web sites — Abso
lute Poker, Empire Poker and True
Poker — are all connected to the presti
gious World Series of Poker, to be held
from June 3 to July 15 in Las Vegas. And
several other online poker rooms are set
ting up tournaments to garner publicity
for their Web sites.
Why do people play online poker? Isn't
it more fun to play with friends? Accord
ing to one Stanford student who requested
to remain anonymous, that isn't the case.
"It's more efficient to play online," he
said. "You'd feel bad about winning $50
from a friend, but you wouldn't care about
taking that money from a stranger."
The online version of the game also
makes it easier for newcomers to learn
the rules.
"I used to play poker all the time with
my friends," said freshman Greg New
man. "It's a fun game. I watched this guy
in my dorm playing [online poker] a cou
ple of times and decided to try it myself."
For an online poker beginner, there
are several things to learn. Online poker
has four key parts: the Web site, the
client, the game server and the players.
The Web site gives information on what
games can be played, the rules of each
game and upcoming events. Players can
also download the poker game client,
which connects players to the site's poker
game server. The server is actually a central
computer that acts as a dealer. Each player
sits behind his or her own computer and
watches the game unfold on the Internet.
So, the big question is: Can players win
real money? The answer is a resounding
yes.
"My friend and I have won about $500
already, but this kid we know has basically
won his college tuition," Newman said. "If
[my friend and I] had played a little more
strategy, we'd be making big bucks, too."
But one does not have to play for real
money. Players can choose to bet play

money. When a player first begins a game,
he or she can sign up fora certain number
of "play" chips. In the event that they lose
all of their chips, players can ask for more,
but some Web sites put a maximum on the
number of times one can stock up.
Playing for real money is highly risky.
When playing for real money, the player
bets his or her own dollars, and depend
ing on the Web site used, the stakes can
be quite high.
Some Web sites allow users to choose
his or her minimum bet, meaning one can
bet as little as a penny. Other sites enforce
a minimum; sometimes this can be hun
dreds of dollars. These Web sites often
profit from a "rake" situation, which is
when poker games end without a winner.
Playing with real money involves an
other risk. Before Web betting with real
money at a Web site, a deposit is often re
quired. While some sites have excellent
track records, others have been known to
never return players' money after col
lapsing as an organization, according to
Thepokerproject.com.
Knowing if a Web site is trustworthy
can get extremely tricky because Web
sites often lure users in with various pro
motions. However, a Web site's popular
ity, game variety and financial reputation
are key factors in determining which
client players will want to download. In
addition, some Web sites feature loyalty
programs, such as frequent player points,
with which users can enter tournaments
or buy merchandise.
But not all students are eager to place
their bets. Junior ChenLi Wang said that
online poker is a waste of time and money.
"There's a concern surrounding the
business outfit," Wang said. "Many of
these online sites are based in question
able countries — countries that lack laws
that prosecute these operations [if these
sites happen to fail]."
There are many poker Web sites
available for exploration. www.Pok
erListings.com ranks the online poker
rooms according to game variety, deposit
and withdrawal options, software and
graphics, ring game traffic, tournament
traffic, rake, sign up bonus, loyalty
bonus, promotions and financial securi
ty. According to Poker Listings, the top
three Web sites are Ultimate Bet, Pacific
Poker and Party Poker.
Each of these Web sites offers an array
of games. Texas Hold'em is the most pop
ular of online poker games and every
poker room offers it. Omaha and Omaha
Hi-Low, two games comparable to Texas
Hold'em. also attract a large audience.
Seven-Card Stud and Five-Card Draw
are more traditional poker games, but are
still fancied on the Internet.
