# Senate rejects bills to split groups' budgets
## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
Elections Commissioner Troy Steinmetz, a
sophomore, updated the Senate on the status
of special fees petition verifications at last
night's ASSU Undergraduate Senate meeting.
The Senate also voted on whether to split cer-

tain student groups' budgets into two separate
items for the special-fees ballot.
According to Steinmetz, all petitions sub
mitted by student groups were approved for
ballot placement with the exception of two,
those turned in by The Stanford Daily and Six
Degrees: A Journal of Human Rights.
The Daily was denied approval due to one

invalid signature that, according to policy, dis
qualified the entire petition. Six Degrees failed
to collect signatures from the required 10 per
cent of the undergraduate population.
Both student groups have expressed interest
in either appealing the Election Commission's
decision or opting to verify each in
dividual signature, Steinmetz said.
As a result, he said to the Senate that

there is a chance that both groups
could be on the special-fees ballot.
The Senate also proposed to
change how four student organiza
tions' budgets would appear on the
special-fees ballot in the spring.
By default, student groups have
the amount of special fees they are
requesting appear directly on the bal

lot as a single figure for students to
vote on. The Senate has the authori
ty, however, to split up the total
amount into two line items and allow
students to vote on each individually.
For example, the budget for Stanford
Mock Trial could be divided into one
amount for travel expenses and the
other for non-travel costs.

Four bills were considered at the
meeting to divide the budgets for
the Society for International Af
fairs, Stanford Mock Trail, the
Black Student Union and the Stan
ford Solar Car Project.
Several Senators said that the in
tent of this separation is to inform
the student body on exactly what

they're voting on and give them the
choice of what functions of groups
to fund. Some members of the Sen
ate said, however, that separating
the budget of only certain groups
would be unfairly holding them to
different standards.
"I feel like the general splitting
process creates a system where

we're holding some special fees
groups to a higher standard to be
able to pass one part of the budget
and a second part of the budget,"
said Deputy Chair of Advocacy
Lauren Graham, a junior. "That's
my biggest objection to it."
The Senate did not pass any of
the bills.
