# Biodesign programs promote student biotech startups
## 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the development of increasingly
powerful scientific tools and the onslaught of
big investment, the biomedical and biotech
nology industries are rife with opportunities
to work on innovative medical technologies.
For the many Stanford students interest
ed in doing just that, a number of student
groups, courses and University programs
have sprung up in recent years to expose
would-be biotech innovators to every stage
of the start-up process, from needs identifi
cation to product patenting to marketing.
One such initiative is the Stanford
Biodesign Innovation Program. The pro
gram was started in 2001 when Joshua
Makower, an inventor and entrepreneur
who had developed a similar program at
Pfizer, approached Dr. Paul Yock, a pro
fessor at the School of Medicine.
"They began the quest to create an envi
ronment that stimulated innovation at Stan
ford and where students would be given the
opportunity to be at the cutting edge of re
search, while understanding the business
side of an idea," explained Teresa Robin
son, the assistant director of the program.
There are two major components to the
Biodesign Innovation Program. One com
ponent is a 10-month, full-time fellowship
program. Teams of selected participants
engage in hands-on product design to ad
dress recognized medical needs.
In addition to developing their innova
tion projects, the fellows serve as teaching
assistants for the other component of the
program — a two-quarter elective course
that follows the innovation process and cre
ates a prototype and business plan.
For the 2005-2006 school year, those in
terested in fellowships will apply to work on
either cardiovascular or surgical innova
tions. Applicants come from a range of
backgrounds — among this year's 65 appli
cants are medical students, bioengineering
post-doctoral students and mechanical en
gineering masters students. While the pro
gram prefers applicants with advanced
medical or graduate degrees in related
fields, academic preparation is not the only
factor in selection.
"It is not only their background, but their
future aspiration to be innovators. We
search for people with a passion for this area,
a commitment to improving patient care and
curiosity in innovation," Robinson said.
Selected fellows begin with a two-week
"bootcamp" by attending lectures given by

experts in the determined field. This is fol
lowed by a three-month clinical immersion
period, during which the innovators shadow
physicians practicing in their field, in order
to identify needs lacking in patient care.
"Actually observing procedures and pa
tient-physician interactions gave us a much
clearer perspective on the challenges to im
proving medical devices and provided the
context for how improved solutions would
be used," said Ken Martin, a current fellow
in neurology and neurosurgery.
Having identified as many as 300 needs,
the fellowship teams explore the market
and reimbursement possibilities to rank
these needs. According to those criteria,
they select needs for use in the elective class
they help teach, while continuing to work
on their projects.
The three- or four-unit biodesign inno
vation class is cross-listed in four different
departments and open to applications from
business and law students, as well as gradu
ate and postdoctoral students in more tech
nical fields. The class usually draws 35 to 50
students and integrates faculty lectures and
project work.
Peter Johnson, a mechanical engineering

graduate student, worked on a treatment
for wide neck cerebral aneurysms as part of
the class during the 2003-2004 school year.
Encouraged by Yock and physicians with
whom his team consulted, they have contin
ued to work toward commercializing the de
vice, including filing a provisional patent
with support from the program.
"The opportunities given to me by this
program have been amazing," Johnson
said. "We have gotten advice and mentor
ing in prototyping, need finding, intellectu
al property, business modeling, deal-mak
ing, medicine, etc. Most of this teaching was
simply done by giving us the opportunity to
experiment in a real-world setting."
Johnson also noted the importance of
the mentorship that class participants re
ceived. While the fellows provide guidance,
the Biodesign Innovation Program also
brings in faculty and industry experts to
serve as mentors, both for the teams in the
elective courses and for the fellows during
their clinical immersion period..
"The mentors are a reflection of the
strong industry and faculty ties that Dr. Paul
Yock and Joshua Makower have." Robin
son said. "They are people who attract indi

viduals who are very interested and passion
ate about innovation and support the pro
cess we are teaching here at Stanford."
"The program brought in the industry
luminaries and gave us a shot at picking
their brains," said Nicholas Mourlas, a for
mer fellow in cardiac surgery.
Mourlas is another of many success sto
ries of the Biodesign Innovation Program.
With co-fellow Chris Eversull, he helped
found Acumen Medical, Inc. to license the
technology that they had developed during
the program.
Former participants of the program can
still expect important opportunities from
the program. Robinson explained that the
Stanford Biodesign Network, the umbrella
group for the Biodesign Innovation Pro
gram, offers important lectures in the field
and serves as a strong network for students
and industry professionals in the Bay Area.
"The network of medical device profes
sionals that we have gained access to via the
program continues to be an incredible re
source," Mourlas said.
Networking is also an important benefit
of another innovative Stanford class ad
dressing interest in the burgeoning biotech
field. Med 275, "Introduction to Bio
pharmeceutical Industry and Its Careers,"
brings in faculty and industry leaders as
guest lecturers and fosters student interac
tion with important players in the field.
"They follow up with these speakers all
the time," said Dr. Phyllis Gardner, an asso
ciate professor of medicine and the organizer
of the course. "It's really good networking."
Like the Stanford Biodesign Innovation
Program, Med 275 is part of a broader
biotechnology program. It was started when
members of the 400-person student group,
Stanford Student Biodesign, approached
Gardner with the idea for the class. Current
ly, in the second year of the course, several
members of Stanford Student Biodesign now
serve as teaching assistants for the course.
"They're trying to prepare members for
innovation and careers in biotechnology,"
Gardner said. "It's a really great group."
Along with her co-coordinators, Dr.
Peter Hallinan and Dr. David Lillienfield,
Gardner organizes internal lectures and
outside speakers on subjects such as prod
uct innovation, business development,
drug regulation, capital financing and in
tellectual property. The class draws about
65 students, ranging from freshman to
business students.
"There's a tremendous call for it." Gard
ner said. "People really want exposure."

Former participants of the program can
still expect important opportunities from
the program. Robinson explained that the
Stanford Biodesign Network, the umbrella
group for the Biodesign Innovation Pro
gram, offers important lectures in the field
and serves as a strong network for students
and industry professionals in the Bay Area.
"The network of medical device profes
sionals that we have gained access to via the
program continues to be an incredible re
source," Mourlas said.
Networking is also an important benefit
of another innovative Stanford class ad
dressing interest in the burgeoning biotech
field. Med 275, "Introduction to Bio
pharmeceutical Industry and Its Careers,"
brings in faculty and industry leaders as
guest lecturers and fosters student interac
tion with important players in the field.
"They follow up with these speakers all
the time," said Dr. Phyllis Gardner, an asso
ciate professor of medicine and the organizer
of the course. "It's really good networking."
Like the Stanford Biodesign Innovation
Program, Med 275 is part of a broader
biotechnology program. It was started when
members of the 400-person student group,
Stanford Student Biodesign, approached
Gardner with the idea for the class. Current
ly, in the second year of the course, several
members of Stanford Student Biodesign now
serve as teaching assistants for the course.
"They're trying to prepare members for
innovation and careers in biotechnology,"
Gardner said. "It's a really great group."
Along with her co-coordinators, Dr.
Peter Hallinan and Dr. David Lillienfield,
Gardner organizes internal lectures and
outside speakers on subjects such as prod
uct innovation, business development,
drug regulation, capital financing and in
tellectual property. The class draws about
65 students, ranging from freshman to
business students.
"There's a tremendous call for it." Gard
ner said. "People really want exposure."

With the development of increasingly
powerful scientific tools and the onslaught of
big investment, the biomedical and biotech
nology industries are rife with opportunities
to work on innovative medical technologies.
For the many Stanford students interest
ed in doing just that, a number of student
groups, courses and University programs
have sprung up in recent years to expose
would-be biotech innovators to every stage
of the start-up process, from needs identifi
cation to product patenting to marketing.
One such initiative is the Stanford
Biodesign Innovation Program. The pro
gram was started in 2001 when Joshua
Makower, an inventor and entrepreneur
who had developed a similar program at
Pfizer, approached Dr. Paul Yock, a pro
fessor at the School of Medicine.
"They began the quest to create an envi
ronment that stimulated innovation at Stan
ford and where students would be given the
opportunity to be at the cutting edge of re
search, while understanding the business
side of an idea," explained Teresa Robin
son, the assistant director of the program.
There are two major components to the
Biodesign Innovation Program. One com
ponent is a 10-month, full-time fellowship
program. Teams of selected participants
engage in hands-on product design to ad
dress recognized medical needs.
In addition to developing their innova
tion projects, the fellows serve as teaching
assistants for the other component of the
program — a two-quarter elective course
that follows the innovation process and cre
ates a prototype and business plan.
For the 2005-2006 school year, those in
terested in fellowships will apply to work on
either cardiovascular or surgical innova
tions. Applicants come from a range of
backgrounds — among this year's 65 appli
cants are medical students, bioengineering
post-doctoral students and mechanical en
gineering masters students. While the pro
gram prefers applicants with advanced
medical or graduate degrees in related
fields, academic preparation is not the only
factor in selection.
"It is not only their background, but their
future aspiration to be innovators. We
search for people with a passion for this area,
a commitment to improving patient care and
curiosity in innovation," Robinson said.
Selected fellows begin with a two-week
"bootcamp" by attending lectures given by

experts in the determined field. This is fol
lowed by a three-month clinical immersion
period, during which the innovators shadow
physicians practicing in their field, in order
to identify needs lacking in patient care.
"Actually observing procedures and pa
tient-physician interactions gave us a much
clearer perspective on the challenges to im
proving medical devices and provided the
context for how improved solutions would
be used," said Ken Martin, a current fellow
in neurology and neurosurgery.
Having identified as many as 300 needs,
the fellowship teams explore the market
and reimbursement possibilities to rank
these needs. According to those criteria,
they select needs for use in the elective class
they help teach, while continuing to work
on their projects.
The three- or four-unit biodesign inno
vation class is cross-listed in four different
departments and open to applications from
business and law students, as well as gradu
ate and postdoctoral students in more tech
nical fields. The class usually draws 35 to 50
students and integrates faculty lectures and
project work.
Peter Johnson, a mechanical engineering

graduate student, worked on a treatment
for wide neck cerebral aneurysms as part of
the class during the 2003-2004 school year.
Encouraged by Yock and physicians with
whom his team consulted, they have contin
ued to work toward commercializing the de
vice, including filing a provisional patent
with support from the program.
"The opportunities given to me by this
program have been amazing," Johnson
said. "We have gotten advice and mentor
ing in prototyping, need finding, intellectu
al property, business modeling, deal-mak
ing, medicine, etc. Most of this teaching was
simply done by giving us the opportunity to
experiment in a real-world setting."
Johnson also noted the importance of
the mentorship that class participants re
ceived. While the fellows provide guidance,
the Biodesign Innovation Program also
brings in faculty and industry experts to
serve as mentors, both for the teams in the
elective courses and for the fellows during
their clinical immersion period..
"The mentors are a reflection of the
strong industry and faculty ties that Dr. Paul
Yock and Joshua Makower have." Robin
son said. "They are people who attract indi

viduals who are very interested and passion
ate about innovation and support the pro
cess we are teaching here at Stanford."
"The program brought in the industry
luminaries and gave us a shot at picking
their brains," said Nicholas Mourlas, a for
mer fellow in cardiac surgery.
Mourlas is another of many success sto
ries of the Biodesign Innovation Program.
With co-fellow Chris Eversull, he helped
found Acumen Medical, Inc. to license the
technology that they had developed during
the program.
