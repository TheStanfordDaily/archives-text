## Editorials Be honest about stress 
### 
As finals week approaches, one would expect to
find the majority of Stanford undergrads either slav
ing away in the library or huddled over their dorm
room desks — and many are. However, there are
other Stanford students outside basking in the sun and
tossing around Frisbees. Do these students not feel
stress?
Maybe they do but they are just really good at
hiding it. That is the phenomenon described as "the
duck syndrome": Stanford students appear calm on
the surface but they are paddling away furiously
under the water. While this analogy seems clever and
everyone talks about acting cool under pressure, it
does have a dark side.
As all students approach the last two weeks of the
quarter, unquestionably the most stressful period,
many feel the need to compete with their peers for
who is "the least stressed out." This race to the bottom
forces students to conceal their true feelings in an ef
fort to lit in. Such strategies only add to the existing
stress burden, making a bad situation worse. Stanford
students must break free from this negative cycle and
become more honest and open about how they are
feeling, not only for themselves but also for the bene
fit of others.
C)ne way to begin doing this is for students to talk
to theii Residential Education staff. While staff
members are as likely as anyone else to suffer from
stress-related issues, in many cases they are the first
line of defense. Staff members are there to listen to
your concerns and know where to direct you for
more help. Most importantly, staff are trained to
deal with these kinds of situations. No matter what is
going on in your life, one member of your staff will
be there to help.
Another valuable resource is Counseling and Psy
chological Services, or CAPS, which provides stu

dents with free counseling services. While approxi
mately 10 percent of the student body uses the service
at least once during the school year, many students
still do not it even exists. Using this service, students
are able to meet with trained personnel within five
days of a request. CAPS also provides group counsel
ing sessions and 24-hour-a-day crisis counseling.
Still, the best method to dealing with stress is to
deal with it before it reaches crisis levels — problems
with stress can rarely be fixed quickly or easily, and
they must be dealt with throughout the quarter. Stu
dents need to ask for help when they need it, rather
than pretending they are invincible. Once students
ask for help, friends can lend a hand and ear, and both
parties will be less likely to hide problems in the fu
ture. Many students are too involved in their own per
sonal difficulties that they are not aware of their
friends' circumstances, and when no one articulates
their need for assistance or comfort, this ensures that
everyone will continue acting as if stress does not af
flict them.
It is time to end this myth of perfect Stanford stu
dents. This notion is detrimental to the campus body
and the University ought to work to dispel it. Stanford
should sponsor a campaign to realign campus norms
— tell students that it is okay to need psychological
help.
If there were posters around campus stating the
percent of students who use CAPS, or the number of
college students in the nation that suffer from depres
sion, it would make others feel less alone. Too often
students do not use CAPS and similar services be
cause of perceived social norms, but the fact is that ev
eryone at sometime needs help. The University, and
the student body, must work to address this issue as it
is one that affects all students and hurts the overall
Stanford experience.
