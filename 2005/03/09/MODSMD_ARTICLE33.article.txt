# Stanford music program won't elimininate illegal downloading
## 
### 
I hc University recently established a committee
to investigate the possibility of creating a legal music
tile-sharing service for students. While the idea is in
teresting and perhaps necessary — particularly since
Stanford faces possible legal repercussions for student
file sharing on its network — such a service is unlike
ly to significantly reduce illegal downloading.
The ultimate fault for this lies not with Stanford,
but with the music industry. The restrictions that
record companies place on legally downloaded files
severely limit how songs can be used and shared, mak
ing them unattractive to students — and to music
downloaders in general, which is one reason why
Apple's iT unes software and the new legal version of
Napster have done little to quash illegal downloading
in general.
Want to share a song you purchased on-line with
one of your friends? Go ahead and try — the song
won't be readable on their computers. Want to burn
your favorite playlist fora party? If you've exceeded
the allotment of burnt CDs granted by your down
loading software, you're out of luck — those songs
are stuck on your computer.
Unless Stanford administrators decide to impose
far more draconian restrictions on file sharing, there is
little incentive for students to use a legal file-sharing
program — paying for crippled files — when they
could access a larger library with more versatile music
for free.
There have also been suggestions that students
could freely play the entire Napster or iTunes music
library while connected to the Stanford network,
but that leaves students with the unattractive
prospect of a nonexistent music collection once they

leave the Farm.
Unfortunately, none of the current possibilities for
legal file sharing offer particularly compelling reasons
to switch from popular programs like Kazaa and our-
Tunes. The music industry must find ways to adapt to
changing technology —just as the film and television
industries adapted to the advent of VCRs — rather
than clamping down on consumers or on the universi
ties that those students attend.
We understand that Stanford may be in a difficult
position legally — a position that might be eased if the
University offers a legal file-sharing program to its
students. And there are students who (either for fear
of legal repercussions or the desire to support musi
cians) will be well-served by such a service. So this
could be a good move for both administrators and stu
dents — as long as Stanford doesn't follow the lead of
Penn State, which includes the cost fora similar pro
gram in tuition, then offers the program for "free" to
all students.
It's unlikely that student bills will grow substantial
ly. but on the heels of another tuition increase and the
reduction of meal-plan options, a universal down
loading fee would be another unfortunate step in the
University's recent pattern of taking both power and
money away from students.
Finally, we urge the new committee to also consid
er the ramifications of movie file-sharing. While the
size of movie files makes downloading movies cur
rently impractical for most students, as technology de
velops it seems unlikely that the present obstacles will
remain. This is an issue that the University will have to
face soon — and the sooner administrators start
thinking about it.the better.
