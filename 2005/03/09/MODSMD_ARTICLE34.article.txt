Stanford Band should take itself seriously
The column by Glenn Truitt entitled "Why 1 hate
the band" (Mar. 1) is the best article that has been
printed by The Stanford Daily to date.
1 am a sophomore member of the Stanford football
team. Since the moment that 1 stepped on campus I
have been disappointed and angry at the joke that is
the Stanford Band. The Band creates a sentiment in
the rest of the nation that the students at Stanford are
a joke and cannot be taken seriously.
The Band is a reflection not only of the team but
also of every student who attends this university in the
past and in the present. It is not only the team's per
formance on the field that needs to be respected and
appreciated, as we are going to be under new coach
Walt Harris, but also off the field and by the individu
als with instruments in their hands.
A traditional band is achievable here at Stanford
and it will do nothing but add to the great experience
that is being a member of the Stanford family.

Existence of Fundamental Standard is justified
During New Student Orientation, I was surprised to
hear of the Fundamental Standard — not because it was
particularly demanding or special, but because it should
be expected of anyone, regardless of an affiliation with an
elite institution. I found its codification somewhat
frivolous, an institutionalized way of saying "don't be a
creep." something 1 believe should be tacitly understood.
Recently I understood why such standards were so ex
plicitly outlined. I watched from my window as a student
pushed a golf cart belonging to a dorm-mate into a parking
lot entrance, effectively blocking it and risking damage to the
cart. My co-resident uses this cart to get around campus be
cause he has a terminal illness. Not only was the perpetrator
distasteful in pranking the parking lot, he showed a funda
mental disrespect fora fellow human being. Unfortunately, I
could not apprehend him in time. Actions like this make one
just another jerk, be it on campus or in the real world.
If you get your laughs by being inconsiderate to oth
ers, perhaps it's time to look around you and read be
tween the Standard's lines.
