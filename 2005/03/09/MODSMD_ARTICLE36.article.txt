# A 						Break From the Bubble
## An ugly display of character 
### 
I'm pretty sure my popularity will
plummet for writing this column —
and analyzing the sociological un
derpinnings of. Stanford based on
Thefacehook.com is somewhat
problematic — but here goes:

It seems that
every Ivy League
school has a rep
utation: Brown is
the hippy Ivy,
Yale is the gay
Ivy, Princeton is
the serious Ivy.
Stanford seemed
to be gunning to
be the athletic Ivy,

J
but despite winning 10 consecutive
Director's Cups, "superficial Ivy"
may he a better label.
There is a remarkable number
ofThefacebook.com groups devot
ed to how hot people are. These
ultra-exclusive, self-congratulatory
groups fill the apparently untapped
role of ensuring that everyone else
knows just how thin, tall and gor
geous certain people are.
It's funny to me that the people
who are supposedly so good look
ing can't just count their blessings
for having good complexion and
chiseled abs and then make their
way to class, no doubt drawing at
tention from all passersby and
causing numerous bicycle accidents
at the Intersection of Death near
the Quad.
Instead, they must confirm the
bitter assumptions of the rest of us
that, in fact, there is a very positive
correlation between looks and su
perficiality.
If I have my lineage of Theface
book.com groups correct, first came
"Pretty People." Perhaps just ran
domly, nearly all of them were white
girls. So then "Association of
Weightroom Hardasses" emerged
from the primeval ooze of superfi
ciality, so that white males could be
self-congratulatory about how hot
they are. Not to be left behind, we got
"Brown People Are Pretty Too,"
"Arab Girls are Sexy," "Hot Jewish
Ladies" and "Hapas Are Hot."
Then, mutating like a virulent

strain of disease, new groups fol
lowed: "Don't Hate Me Because I'm
Beautiful," "Sexiest Stanford
Guys," "Stanford's Finest," "The In
Crowd," "Perfect 10" and "Hottest
Stanford Girls (and Yes, there actu
ally are Some)," climaxing (I hope)
with the subtly titled "The-hottest
men-on-the-planet-and-you-can-
only-be-allowed-in-this-group-by-
invite."
It's sickeningly ironic that at a
school where many students struggle
with eating disorders, we have a
group called "Did You Just Call Me
Fat?" It essentially mocks over
weight people with such jabs as, "We
make airplane trips intimate by
pulling up the armrest dividers." and
"We prefer to be called 'husky' or
'big boned.' " Fittingly, the group's
members are mostly thin blonde
girls.
I won't go so far as to say Fve
never made a fat joke, but that is
pretty low. Not only must we make
self-congratulatory groups flaunting
our good looks, but now we have to
make groups to mock the over
weight? If Stanford students are sup
posed to be the enlightened and
well-educated future leaders of our
society, I'm beginning to fear for
that society.
It's not enough that every adver
tisement. magazine cover and televi
sion show is conforming to a narrow
standard of beauty. Now we, as high
ly privileged and educated individu
als, must rub salt in the wound and
mock those who don't conform
while simultaneously creating
cliquish barriers between those who
do and everyone else.
I understand that many Theface
book.com groups are created out of
a silly attempt to blow off steam and
mean no ill will toward anyone. But
I do think it's telling that even some
of the best-educated succumb just as
easily to the temptations of superfi
ciality and image.
