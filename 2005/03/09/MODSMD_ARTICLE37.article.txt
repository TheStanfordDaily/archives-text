## Depreciation defense 
### 
Saw the movie "Hitch" last
weekend. It was a revelation. I
hadn't realized that all I needed to
score hot women was scripted dia
logue, expensive actors and a trashy
plot. And who says romance is

dead.'
1 don 't want to
waste 500 words
on why a movie
with 50 beautiful
people and one
fat guy bears lit
tle resemblance
to the real world.
(If you're inter
ested, the real

world has fewer beautiful people
and more like you.)
Instead I want to draw your at
tention to the scene where the black
guy is telling the aforementioned
fat guy (gotta love the stereotyping)
about why you should never do
anything outlandish on a dance
floor. After a little chortling, I start
ed thinking about the shakin' of
one's "thang" and I've come to a
few conclusions.
First of all, no one can dance.
Well, not exactly no one, but ap

proximately no one. Which leaves
you wondering why people still do
it.
Young people obviously do it in
order to Do It, but such sordid
things don't explain why bopping up
and down to Britney Spears is still
an acceptable social activity when
you're old enough to know better.
Simple. Self defense.
How better to hide from the in
evitable conquest of age than by
shuffling from foot to foot, ever so
slightly off the beat?
How better to grasp at the rapid
ly fading halcyon days of youth than
to sway from side to side, with gen
tle tilting and nodding of one's head
to indicate a personal "bond" with
the music.
How better to assuage the nag
ging guilt after a Friday night crawl
around the faux-stucco buildings of
Rains in a desperate search for free
liquor than by faux-rhythmic jab
bing of a finger in the air, accompa
nied by that oh-so-charming bend
ing from the waist.
Actually even with the hiding.
