## Depreciation defense 
### 
Saw the movie "Hitch" last
weekend. It was a revelation. I
hadn't realized that all I needed to
score hot women was scripted dia
logue, expensive actors and a trashy
plot. And who says romance is

dead.'
1 don 't want to
waste 500 words
on why a movie
with 50 beautiful
people and one
fat guy bears lit
tle resemblance
to the real world.
(If you're inter
ested, the real

world has fewer beautiful people
and more like you.)
Instead I want to draw your at
tention to the scene where the black
guy is telling the aforementioned
fat guy (gotta love the stereotyping)
about why you should never do
anything outlandish on a dance
floor. After a little chortling, I start
ed thinking about the shakin' of
one's "thang" and I've come to a
few conclusions.
First of all, no one can dance.
Well, not exactly no one, but ap

proximately no one. Which leaves
you wondering why people still do
it.
Young people obviously do it in
order to Do It, but such sordid
things don't explain why bopping up
and down to Britney Spears is still
an acceptable social activity when
you're old enough to know better.
Simple. Self defense.
How better to hide from the in
evitable conquest of age than by
shuffling from foot to foot, ever so
slightly off the beat?
How better to grasp at the rapid
ly fading halcyon days of youth than
to sway from side to side, with gen
tle tilting and nodding of one's head
to indicate a personal "bond" with
the music.
How better to assuage the nag
ging guilt after a Friday night crawl
around the faux-stucco buildings of
Rains in a desperate search for free
liquor than by faux-rhythmic jab
bing of a finger in the air, accompa
nied by that oh-so-charming bend
ing from the waist.
Actually even with the hiding.

grasping and assuaging, dancing is
still a high-risk activity. After all,
given that you're not Ricky Martin,
you'll still look stupid. So, how to
deal?
Well, here comes the clever part.
Embrace it. The art of living a life of
shame is never to show weakness.
In fact, there is no better way to
be ridiculous than to do it con
sciously. If you can laugh at your
self, then perhaps no one else will.
Now laughing at oneself is just
the start. Self-depreciation is an art
form, and it's a heavily practiced
one by the graduate student com
munity.
There are, of course, many levels
to the art. For example, accusations
of sketchiness can be swiftly dealt
with by an acknowledged leer (like
an ordinary leer, but somehow
more charming if you're doing it on
purpose).
Going further, so what if life's a
little awkward? Just complain

about it and suddenly everything
will be better. Recognize each
daily failure with a wry hint of cyn
icism and what can possibly stand
in your way?
1 suppose that cynicism is the ul
timate deprecative defense, the
last refuge of the truly desperate.
After all, it's easy to mock and
even easier to take shelter behind
a little bitterness.
What's more, it's not just de
fense. Things not going great? No
problem. Just tell everyone who'll
listen about the conspiracy of exis
tence and suddenly you've got a
party trick, a joke and a little reason
why you're cool.
That, plus a little hip thrusting,
and you're in the game.
Speaking of party tricks, 1
should go and finish memorizing
the rest of the pick-up lines from
the movie. See you after the break
and good luck with any and all
exams.

Incidentally, / was doing the whole de
liberate lecherous thing at every party
you've ever been unfortunate enough
to see me at. E-mail navirts@stan
ford.edu fora personal apology.
