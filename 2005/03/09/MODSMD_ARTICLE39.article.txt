1 write better while drunk. Well,
it's not that 1 write better, it's just that
writing is boring and it's much easier
to tolerate while drunk. When the
night is winding down and I'm drunk
and unoccupied, I find that the words
How easily. Now, many nonsensical e
mails have shown me that for the ma
jority of people, the urge to write
while inebriated should be resisted,
but my drunken writing is almost in-

distinguishable from what I write when sober. In fact,
I'm writing this column while drunk.
For me, alcohol can be a productivity — enhancing
drug. Many short stories and columns would still be
trapped in my mind were it not for the magic brew. And
the Greeks agreed. They used to have big drunken par
lies called symposia in which they argued philosophy
and hooked up with each other. Yes, the basis of most
Western thought is the ancient equivalent of a frat party.
So, if alcohol has been such a boon to my writing and to
Western civilization, imagine what harder drugs could do?
Some people might find it hard to imagine that drugs like
cocaine could benefit society, but most doctors would dis
agree. Ritalin, a drug millions of children are given to
counteract hyperactivity, is similar in chemical structure to
speed and has physiological effects that are exactly the
same as cocaine. If we put cocaine in a pill and prescribed
it to these kids in the same doses, it would have exactly the
same effect as Ritalin. Now, our doctors seem to think that
these children's lives are being enhanced by narcotics.
Many non-hyperactive people take Ritalin (and co
caine) illegally, because it helps them concentrate (basi
cally the same effect alcohol has on me). For these peo

pie the drug unquestionably increases their productivity.
What I'm not saying, Mom, is that you should go out
and take cocaine or drink to finish that paper. That
would be a bad idea. But these examples do raise an in
teresting question. Isn't it possible that the right drugs, in
the right doses, could enable healthy people to work
harder and be happier at the same time? If this is true,
wouldn't it enhance society as a whole to encourage re
search into developing these drugs? Imagine a world
where there are no bitch jobs, where everything seems
wonderful if you pop a few pills. Imagine a world where
your hidden talents come to the forefront under the in
fluence of certain magical substances. If there were no
drug laws, drug companies would have an interest in de
veloping drugs that could increase productivity and hap
piness at the same time with relatively mild side effects.
Emotions are just chemical reactions in our brains.
And there are times when we need certain emotions and
times when we don't need them. Soldiers need to be
brave. Judges need to be dispassionate. The sooner we
allow drug companies to research drugs that will control
the emotions, the sooner we will become a rational soci
ety, in which we are no longer slaves to our hormones.
Productivity will increase because feelings will no
longer get in the way of business. Happiness will increase
because negative emotions will no longer occur when
they are not needed. What is the downside? Only free
will suffers. But if free will is simply the result of random
chemical interactions in the brain, what good is it? Won't
we be more free when we can choose what we feel?
