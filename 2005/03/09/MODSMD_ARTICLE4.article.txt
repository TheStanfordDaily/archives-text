# 'Fuchies' grow in numbers

When Computer Science
Prof. Eric Roberts talks about ' ( a
the divide between "techies"
and "fuzzies," he refers to the VV
words of C.P. Snow, a famed \ / CP
physicist turned novelist. V
Snow broke down the a ~ I 'W
split: "Literary intellectuals at J\ \~^J
one pole — at the other scientists. / \
.. between the two a gulf of mutual \ \
incomprehension — sometimes,
particularly among the young, hostili
ty and dislike but most of all lack of understanding."
Roberts said he believes that this deep division might
have harmful effects on students on the Farm.
"It's been told to me that the first question asked to stu
dents who come to Stanford for Admit Weekend is, 'Are
you a techie or a fuzzie?' " he said.
But. future ProFros who dofrft know the answer — and
underclassmen who are in the same boat — should take
comfort in knowing that some have never had to pick one
camp. These students, who have broken the mold, have la
beled themselves as either "fuchies" (rhymes with duckies)
or "tezzies."
Similar to libertarians, self-described "fuchies" and
"tezzies" say they do not abide by the established system,
but instead try to combine the best of both worlds. If there
is indeed a gap between the humani
ties and the natural sciences then
these students are the ones attempt
ing to bridge it.
That said, even students who are
familiar with the terms "luchie" and
"tezzie" admit that figuring out which
students fit these hills is difficult.
While a student double-majoring
in English and biology might be an
obvious "luchie," it is less clear what
to call a management science and en
gineering major.
Senior Josh Seifert, an MS&E
major, said that his program "definite
ly has that allure of being in between,
but it's more techie." He added that the
program just happens to fall on "the
iuzzie end of the techie spectrum."
Junior Josh Mendoza said that the
term "tezzie" can only be properly
applied to double-majors.
"It's probably someone like a pre

med or engineer who mixes political
science or English on the side," Men
doza said.
He also said he thinks "tezzies"
place greater emphasis on the sci
ences and that it is harder for human
ities students to mix in science "on the
side" than vice versa.
Sophomore Shelley Cheung, who
will most likely major in both English
and human biology, described her
self as a "tezzie." She said she be
lieves that, judging by their interests
alone, most students probably don't
fall so neatly into the techie / fuzzie
dichotomy.
"1 think a lot of people are both,"
Cheung said. "But they just don't have
enough time or units to fit in both in
terests, so they pick one or the other."
Human biology by itself is consid
ered by some to be a "tezzie / luchie"
major because of its core's division
into two tracks, one focused on biolo
gy and one focused on public policy
and social theory.
Junior Kristin Cohoon, who is lean
ing toward a human biology major and
an English minor, identifies herself'as

a "tezzie" but she seemed unsure
whether the term indicated well
roundedness or a lack of direction.
Perhaps it is the latter since Cohoon
said she has an "interest in everything."
There are stereotypes associated
with both "techies" and "fuzzies" —
most commonly that "techies" are
neurotic nerds and that "fuzzies" are
students who go through school with
out learning anything substantive.
Cheung said that although Stan
lord might appear deeply divided, she
believes the strength of interdiscipli
nary programs puts the University at
an advantage compared to its peer in
stitutions.
Roberts said he thinks that the
"battle for hegemony" between the
"techie" and "fuzzie" departments
exists because both are so strong.
"Nobody's going to think of Har
vard as a techie school," he said.
"And with the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology it's the opposite."
Even so, "fuchies" and "tezzies"
demonstrate that there's a third-party
alternative to Stanford's seemingly
rigid two-party system.
