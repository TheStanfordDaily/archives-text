## An open letter to Chris Vaughan 
### AMOS NUR 
Dear Chris,
I have been prodded by students
and staff members at the Overseas
Studies Program, or OSP, to respond
to what you call your four-piece "crit
ical writing project" in which you
take OSP to task on several accounts
(most recently, "OSP must embrace
change," Feb. 25). I have been a bit
hesitant to do so because much of
what you say is simply a collection of
your opinions and judgments that are
unrelated to actual facts. For exam
ple, you assert that OSP leads to "the
dulling of one's sense for contradic
tion, conflict and challenge," that we
plant "seeds from which an oversim
plified worldview grows," that we
promote "an upper-middle-class
agenda" and engage students in
"day-long resort romps." Of course
you are entitled to hold and express
openly these opinions, but the lack of
factual support for them leaves little
room for constructive dialogue.
Nonetheless, both you and those
who disagree with you deserve a re
sponse from me. Let me begin by
stressing OSP's mission as 1 see it in
the overall context of the Universi
ty's mission. OSP exists to provide
Stanford undergraduates an oppor
tunity fora life-changing experience
through study abroad. To succeed in
fulfilling this mission, we select our
centers, the courses offered and the
activities provided by measuring
them against four criteria, given here
in order of importance: content, stu
dent interest, faculty interest and fea
sibility.
Feasibility and faculty interest are
relatively straightforward considera
tions: By feasibility 1 mean such prac
tical issues as costs, safety, available
infrastructure, etc. Faculty interest is
simple, too. Because our policy and
practice are to have a Stanford facul
ty member in residence at each cen
ter every quarter it is open — in
order to provide opportunities for
much closer interaction and intellec
tual interchange between students

and faculty than is possible on the
home campus — we need to ensure
that there is sufficient faculty inter
est.
Content and student interest are
more complicated because they in
volve the selection of material and
people out of larger pools. Both are
directly related to academic deci
sions we have to make. Without
going into detail, I would say that
OSP strives to offer as broad a range
of academic areas as possible so that
students from the entire spectrum of
majors at Stanford can participate.
While language is a particularly ap
propriate and useful part of this con
struct, it is only one part. Many stu
dents, who want to — and I believe
must be able to — go overseas, can
not fit language preparation into
their majors' demanding require
ments sufficiently to permit an ideal
level of facility. The intellectual and
emotional rewards of study abroad
should not be denied them. From its
inception in 1958 OSP has promoted
the philosophy that it should provide
programs to permit as many under
graduates as possible to take advan
tage of study abroad, all the while
maintaining normal progress toward
graduation. This premise of the pro
gram cannot and does not pretend to
promise "cultural immersion" as its
raison d'etre.
That brings me to my final and
most important point. To me, Stan
ford is about choices. We work hard
at Stanford to enable students to
choose their majors, choose among
courses required for their majors and
choose courses in general both freely
and easily. Similarly, students choose
whether to go abroad or not, via OSP
or otherwise. At OSP, students
choose courses and internships and
research projects. They choose
whether to attend Bing events, to go
or not to go to an opera or ballet per
formance or in a group to a restau
rant. Maximizing choices is not sim
ply a nice thing Stanford and OSP
provide. It is much more than that. It
is the inescapable consequence of a

deep-rooted belief in and respect for
diversity. Students at this university
come from extremely diverse back
grounds economically, religiously,
nationally, culturally, racially, and
politically as well as in terms of per
sonal tastes, hobbies and personali
ties. Enabling students to have and
make choices is a direct consequence
of this great diversity, yet at the same
time places great responsibility on
each student to do so. And like the
University as a whole, OSP is com
mitted to offering as wide a range of
choices as possible.
In one of your early pieces ("Stop
OSP hand-holding," Feb. 11), you
complain about OSP's "hand hold
ing" and "paternalism" as "a pricey
form of day-care." I find it utterly
ironic that at the end of your project
you suggest that OSP should "force
— yes force — students to have a
more distinctive experience." Just as
we at OSP do not, cannot and will not
hold any student hands we also do
not, cannot, and will not force any
one to do anything. We are commit
ted both in principle and in practice
to diversity and therefore to stu
dents' freedom of choice with the
consequence that students bear the
responsibility for making choices and
bearing the consequences.
OSP may not be for everyone. The
student who wishes "cultural immer
sion" and linguistic fluency may be
better advised to seek another pro
gram, and we regularly refer students
to the Overseas Resources Center
where such information is available.
The vision of OSP's founders, howev
er, has been irrefutably vindicated by
the almost 20,(XX) students who have
chosen to participate and especially
by the large numbers among them
who say that their experience with
OSP was the highlight of their under
graduate years at Stanford.
