## ASSU must be active in special-fees process 
### CHRIS LIN 
The Daily's editorial, "Re-evaluation of special-fees sys
tem needed" (Mar. 1), suggests that the ASSU Undergrad
uate Senate and Graduate Student Council should take a
hands-off approach to placing special-fees groups on the bal
lot, a view I believe is not in the best interest of students.
The legislative bodies have a responsibility to contin
ue playing an active role in special-fees ballot placement.
Funding committee members spend entire weekends in
terviewing groups for 20 to 30 minutes each and are ex
pected to review budgets in detail beforehand. These
budgets, in total, run over S(X) pages in length. As repre
sentatives of the student body, we both have the ability
and responsibility to ensure that fiscally responsible
budgets are on the ballot.
There are numerous considerations for receiving ap
proval for placement, and these considerations and their
importance will vary from senator to senator. Speaking
for myself, factors 1 considered included: how many stu
dents benefit from the fee money, whether the group has
had past success on the ballot, the importance of the fee
money to the operation of the group and the fiscal re
sponsibility of the budget.
Even if the Senate or GSC rejects a group's request
for ballot placement, a student group can always petition
the student body to be placed on the ballot. This option
would serve absolutely no purpose if the bodies were to
simply virtually rubber-stamp every budget that came
through, as The Daily suggests.
Equally worse would be if the Senate and GSC took a
completely hands-off approach and made petitioning the
only method of getting on the ballot every year. Instead,
having stringent legislative oversight of special-fees ballot

placements ensures that established groups with broad
outreach and fiscally responsible budgets can get on the
ballot, but still allows groups to petition onto the ballot.
While The Daily's editorial expresses a valid posi
tion, it's interesting to note that previous Daily editorial
boards have argued for exactly the opposite on April 20,
2(X)4. 1 raise this point not to argue hypocrisy (since it
was a different editorial board one year ago), but to
make it clear that reasonable people can have very dif
ferent opinions on the special-fees process.
I wholeheartedly agree that students need to get in
volved in the special-fees process. Students should spend
time to find out for themselves what is on each special-fees
group's budget, either from the Elections Handbook or
The Daily's coverage of the election. For example, how
much is the group spending on food, air travel, honoraria,
equipment? What events, programming or opportunities
does the group offer the student body? Voting on special
fees groups goes beyond simply voting on the group's
name. In the end, as voters, we have the unique opportu
nity to control how much our student activities fee will be
next year and to which groups that money goes.
Though 1 had numerous disagreements with it. The Daily
editorial serves as a great starting point fora discussion on
special fees. What purpose should fees serve, how high should
they be, what type of expenses should they fund, what types
of groups should receive them? These are all extremely im
portant questions, and members of the Senate and GSC are
always open to hearing student input on these issues. As Sen
ate and GSC candidates campaign early spring quarter. I urge
them to discuss their views on these issues.
