Is there such a thing as political
objectivity? By definition, the an
swer seems to be no. Politicians tend
to line up the facts to back-up their
arguments, almost to the point
where it is impossible to distinguish
which came first, the facts or the
point of view. Does this make the
politician and the policy one and the
same?
It shouldn't, but it often does, es
pecially when it comes to
Democrats and President George
W. Bush. Although many detest the
man for the direction he's taken the
country, critics still ought to judge
his actions from behind some sort of
objective veil of ignorance. Consid
er the Bush administration and the
Middle East.
There is no denying that in his
first four years. Bush initiated a long
term process to reform the Middle
East. He did not attack Iraq because
of its oil or over some personal
vendetta against Saddam Hussein,
but because he is a true believer in
his crusade to spread freedom —
well, at least his economic version of
it — around the world.
So we invade Iraq.
Short term: horrible idea. The ex
ecution of the plan, if there ever was
one, left much to be desired; we
probably invaded the wrong country
(how many of the Sept. 11 hijacker's
were Iraqi?) and worst of all, he lied
to us in order to scare us into giving

him our tacit con
sent.
Long term:
still unclear. The
question is
whether the ends
justify the means.
Democracy is
taking hold in
Iraq better than
anybody foresaw,

but there is still much work to be
done.
The insurgency rages on, but no
tably less so since the January elec
tions. The Bush administration
could do itself a huge favor by re
nouncing any intentions to build per
manent military bases in Iraq (which
they are already building) and by
bringing Sunnis into the process,
thereby taking away much of the in
surgency's popular support.
But regardless of the outcome,
there will always be a normative and
a moral question about what the
United States done in Iraq.
The normative question concerns
whether freedom and democracy
should be imposed upon a people by
sword. To an extent this can be trans
lated into an empirical question
based on the eventual health of
Iraq's democracy, but there will al
ways be that lurking hypocrisy sur
rounding the means.
The moral question is unanswer
able but worth debating: Will the

outcome in Iraq be worth the neces
sary loss of life? Progress always has
costs, but it is so difficult to weigh the
dead bodies on a scale with another
people's freedom on the other side.
Which is heavier will always be in the
eye of the beholder.
The invasion of Iraq has arguably
brought a second country that much
closer to its own freedom: Lebanon.
Is what is happening in Lebanon
right now a direct consequence of a
liberated Iraq? In reality, it is impos
sible to tell. But it would be an aw
fully good coincidence for there to
have been pro-western democratic
revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine and
potentially now Lebanon without
the strong, pro-democracy stance
that Bush's administration has
taken.
The lesson here is not easily
learned. Bush has done so much that
our side of the aisle disagrees with
that it is almost too easy to uniform
ly dismiss each and every endeavor
that has his administration's mark on
it.
Are Bush's ends for the Middle
East commendable? Yes. Are his
means admirable? So far no, but
we'll just have to wait and see how
the history books record the first
eight years of the 21 st century. There
is still much to be written.
