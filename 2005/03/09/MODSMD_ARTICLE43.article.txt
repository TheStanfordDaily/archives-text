## Pragmatism, principles and The Daily's special fee 
### JENNIFER GRAHAM 
If you're a pragmatist, you might
as well vote "yes" if The Daily ap
pears on this April's special-fees bal
lot. Why? Because it will cost you
less money than a Jamba Juice and,
chances are, you'll use it more fre
quently than almost anything else
you'll end up paying for.
But while it makes sense on an in
dividual level to dole out the three or
so bucks that The Daily's special fee
would cost, ideologically this poten
tiality should strike you as abhorrent
on two levels. That The Daily will
end up on the ballot (an up-in-the
air question at the time of this writ
ing) theoretically threatens both the
journalistic integrity of the newspa
per and the survival of the special
fees system.
So what should you do when it's
time to vote? Take a new sort of per
sonality typing test. II you vote yes
for The Daily, you're a pragmatist; if
you vote no, you're an ideologue.
Or. you could just be cheap, but
that's a separate matter.
First, there's the issue of The
Daily's journalistic independence.
As a financially self-sufficient enter
prise (i.e. the paper is not supported
by any University money ... except
sort of from that pesky special fee).
The Daily is able to run stories criti
cal of the University, for example,
without fear of retribution. Daily
opponents of the special fee correct
ly argue that this is a potential threat
to The Daily's independence, as the
ASSU, the body that administers the
special-fees system, is a frequent
subject of the Daily's reporting.
Since The Daily is beholden to the
ASSU in letting getting onto the bal
lot, the logic goes that The Daily
may be less inclined to criticize the
ASSU in print.
In principle, this is should be a
matter of concern; voters who be
lieve staunchly that The Daily
should remove itself from potential
conflicts of interest to the greatest
extent possible should not support

this special fee and should not sup
port The Daily's seeking it.
But let's get real. In my experi
ence at The Daily, the paper has
never changed or considered chang
ing a reasoned opinion or accurate
reporting for fear of upsetting the
ASSU — the ASSU just isn't that
powerful. Furthermore, it's dubious
that the ASSU would consider
granting The Daily a concession on
special fees as a political favor for
good coverage —The Daily isn't
that powerful either (though it clear
ly reaches people more easily and
often than does the ASSU). When
you go to vote on special fees, the
fear of conflict of interest is not con
crete but conceptual.
The second issue, that of The
Daily's impact on the special fee sys
tem, is one of more realistic concern.
Over the last several years, with the
combination of a slowed economy,
dipping ad revenue and the excep
tional term of an especially finan
cially inept former editor in chief,
The Daily needed its special fee to
keep from pillaging its endowment,
couching the fee as equivalent to a
"subscription."
This year, however, ad revenue is
up enough that the ASSU rejected
The [Daily's special-fee request. And
it should have. From my anecdotal
knowledge of the paper's financial
situation. The Daily could stay in the
black this year without its special
fee, perhaps at the expense of sever
al ad executives' bonuses and the al
cohol tab at the biannual banquet.
(0.K., it would probably take a bit
more belt-tightening, but certainly
less than there has been in the past
few years.)
The ASSU uses the special-fees
process primarily as a way for groups
to cover their operating costs when
they don't have other means of gen
erating enough revenue, and The
Daily — legally a corporation —
clearly does not fit into this category.
At a time when the entire special fees
process seems to teeter on the edge of
bankruptcy from rampant refunds

and student frustration over high fee
costs, requests from groups that don't
fit within the process' purpose should
get the boot.
So a corollary to ponder: Should 1
have signed The Daily's petition to
get itself on the ballot? I'd say no. In
doing so, you would have bolstered
The Daily's unnecessary bid and
weakened the special-fees process
by probably signing a petition not
because you actually know about the
requesting group and care if they get
on the ballot, but because it's easier
to sign it and get the person nagging
you out of your room.
Still, the argument that students
and others should in some way pay
a "subscription fee" to The Daily
seems valid. Since it is doubtful
that The Daily's dependence on
one student's economic contribu
tion would lead to a conflict of in
terest, the fear of compromised
journalistic integrity subsides.
Then getting the extra $50,000 the
paper needs to compensate its
workers and not go broke is just a
matter of process. As it stands, the
special-fees process serves as a
convenient means of revenue gen
eration, even if it is not designed
for the collection of the "subscrip
tion fee" which The Daily re
quests. The Daily simply takes the
easy way out.
I'll leave the details to The
Daily's business managers, present
and future, to figure out what com
bination of e-commerce, separate
ASSU voting mechanisms, donation
boxes or other clever schemes may
be used to generate the extra money
the paper needs for distribution.
Even using the ASSU platform to
solicit funds but doing so separately
from special-fees voting could be a
short-term solution.
So, when it comes time to vote,
say "no" if you if you're a citizen of
principle, or "yes" if you just like to
keep the main source of fodder for
the Chappie Daily afloat.

to The Daily's independence, as the
ASSU, the body that administers the
special-fees system, is a frequent
subject of the Daily's reporting.
Since The Daily is beholden to the
ASSU in letting getting onto the bal
lot, the logic goes that The Daily
may be less inclined to criticize the
ASSU in print.
In principle, this is should be a
matter of concern; voters who be
lieve staunchly that The Daily
should remove itself from potential
conflicts of interest to the greatest
extent possible should not support

this special fee and should not sup
port The Daily's seeking it.
But let's get real. In my experi
ence at The Daily, the paper has
never changed or considered chang
ing a reasoned opinion or accurate
reporting for fear of upsetting the
ASSU — the ASSU just isn't that
powerful. Furthermore, it's dubious
that the ASSU would consider
granting The Daily a concession on
special fees as a political favor for
good coverage —The Daily isn't
that powerful either (though it clear
ly reaches people more easily and
often than does the ASSU). When
you go to vote on special fees, the
fear of conflict of interest is not con
crete but conceptual.
The second issue, that of The
Daily's impact on the special fee sys
tem, is one of more realistic concern.
Over the last several years, with the
combination of a slowed economy,
dipping ad revenue and the excep
tional term of an especially finan
cially inept former editor in chief,
The Daily needed its special fee to
keep from pillaging its endowment,
couching the fee as equivalent to a
"subscription."
This year, however, ad revenue is
up enough that the ASSU rejected
The [Daily's special-fee request. And
it should have. From my anecdotal
knowledge of the paper's financial
situation. The Daily could stay in the
black this year without its special
fee, perhaps at the expense of sever
al ad executives' bonuses and the al
cohol tab at the biannual banquet.
(0.K., it would probably take a bit
more belt-tightening, but certainly
less than there has been in the past
few years.)
The ASSU uses the special-fees
process primarily as a way for groups
to cover their operating costs when
they don't have other means of gen
erating enough revenue, and The
Daily — legally a corporation —
clearly does not fit into this category.
At a time when the entire special fees
process seems to teeter on the edge of
bankruptcy from rampant refunds

and student frustration over high fee
costs, requests from groups that don't
fit within the process' purpose should
get the boot.
So a corollary to ponder: Should 1
have signed The Daily's petition to
get itself on the ballot? I'd say no. In
doing so, you would have bolstered
The Daily's unnecessary bid and
weakened the special-fees process
by probably signing a petition not
because you actually know about the
requesting group and care if they get
on the ballot, but because it's easier
to sign it and get the person nagging
you out of your room.
Still, the argument that students
and others should in some way pay
a "subscription fee" to The Daily
seems valid. Since it is doubtful
that The Daily's dependence on
one student's economic contribu
tion would lead to a conflict of in
terest, the fear of compromised
journalistic integrity subsides.
Then getting the extra $50,000 the
paper needs to compensate its
workers and not go broke is just a
matter of process. As it stands, the
special-fees process serves as a
convenient means of revenue gen
eration, even if it is not designed
for the collection of the "subscrip
tion fee" which The Daily re
quests. The Daily simply takes the
easy way out.
I'll leave the details to The
Daily's business managers, present
and future, to figure out what com
bination of e-commerce, separate
ASSU voting mechanisms, donation
boxes or other clever schemes may
be used to generate the extra money
the paper needs for distribution.
Even using the ASSU platform to
solicit funds but doing so separately
from special-fees voting could be a
short-term solution.
So, when it comes time to vote,
say "no" if you if you're a citizen of
principle, or "yes" if you just like to
keep the main source of fodder for
the Chappie Daily afloat.

If you're a pragmatist, you might
as well vote "yes" if The Daily ap
pears on this April's special-fees bal
lot. Why? Because it will cost you
less money than a Jamba Juice and,
chances are, you'll use it more fre
quently than almost anything else
you'll end up paying for.
But while it makes sense on an in
dividual level to dole out the three or
so bucks that The Daily's special fee
would cost, ideologically this poten
tiality should strike you as abhorrent
on two levels. That The Daily will
end up on the ballot (an up-in-the
air question at the time of this writ
ing) theoretically threatens both the
journalistic integrity of the newspa
per and the survival of the special
fees system.
So what should you do when it's
time to vote? Take a new sort of per
sonality typing test. II you vote yes
for The Daily, you're a pragmatist; if
you vote no, you're an ideologue.
Or. you could just be cheap, but
that's a separate matter.
First, there's the issue of The
Daily's journalistic independence.
As a financially self-sufficient enter
prise (i.e. the paper is not supported
by any University money ... except
sort of from that pesky special fee).
The Daily is able to run stories criti
cal of the University, for example,
without fear of retribution. Daily
opponents of the special fee correct
ly argue that this is a potential threat
to The Daily's independence, as the
ASSU, the body that administers the
special-fees system, is a frequent
subject of the Daily's reporting.
Since The Daily is beholden to the
ASSU in letting getting onto the bal
lot, the logic goes that The Daily
may be less inclined to criticize the
ASSU in print.

lieve staunchly that The Daily
