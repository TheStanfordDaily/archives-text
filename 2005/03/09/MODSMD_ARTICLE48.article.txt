## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Pacific-10 Conference play came to a fitting end for
No. 1 Stanford Monday night when the Cardinal (29-
2), who suffered just one conference loss during the
regular season, captured their third consecutive Pac-10
Tournament title with a 56-42 victory over Arizona
State. In four total Pac-10 Tournaments, Stanford
holds a 10-1 overall record and has reached the title
game each year.

The Cardinal's journey to this year's title began Sat
urday night with a 41-point dismantling of eight-seed
California, setting the tournament record for margin of
victory. Senior Susan King Borchardt led the way for
Stanford with 14 points on four three-point field goals.
Senior Kelley Suminski added five assists.
Despite disrupting the Cardinal's offensive flow at
times, the Golden Bears were unable to capitalize at
the offensive end of the court, where they shot just 27.3
percent from the field. From beyond the arc, California
was persistent but inept, shooting l-of-19. Stanford
outscored the Bears by 21 points from three-point
range alone.
"1 thought we competed, I thought that the game
was extremely physical and that we didn't back down
whatsoever." Cal head coach Caren Horstmeyer said.
"But in transition, we didn't get matched up well
enough ... and those [three-point field goals] really
hurt us."

History dictated a blowout in Sunday's matchup
with the Women of Troy, who had fallen to Stanford by
scores of 94-58 and 88-62 during the regular season.
However, USC played inspired basketball from the
opening tip to the end of a game that was intensely
physical and competitive.
"I said, 'We've got to go out and be as physical [as
Stanford)," USC head coach Mark Trakh said. "We've
got to go out and play as hard."
The Women of Troy did just that and slowed the
Cardinal offense in a way few have this year.
USC's physical play in the paint limited center
Brooke Smith, who has averaged 13.3 points per game
this year, to just seven points on 3-of-7 shooting. The trio
of Jamie Funn, Kim Gipson and Chloe Kerr aggressive
ly denied Smith the ball and created turnovers inside.
On offense, sophomore Eshaya Murphy led USC
with 16 points and 10 rebounds in just 25 minutes of
play. Kerr was also a thorn in Stanford's side, finishing

with 14 points on 7-of-9 shooting.
Inside, sophomore Kristen Newlin turned in an excel
lent performance for VanDerveer, scoring 14 points and
pulling down eight rebounds, along with a pair of steals.
Yet, the Women of Troy persisted. Finishing the
first half with a three-pointer from Brynn Cameron
and a miracle half-court bucket from freshman Camille
LeNoir at the buzzer, USC took a five-point lead into
the locker room. It was the first time this year the Car
dinal trailed at intermission.
"|At halftime] I said 'We're coming to the game to
morrow night either way,"' VanDerveer said. "So you de
cide whether you want to be on the bench or in the stands.'
I trusted the fact that people want to be on the bench."
In the second half, the Cardinal showed that they
did.
Freshman Candice Wiggins scored 16 of her 24
points in the second half and added 12 rebounds for her
third career double-double. As for freshman jitters,
Wiggins' two successful free throws with 33 seconds re
maining extended a two-point lead to four, effectively
sealing the victory.
Suminski continued to build her record of excel
lence under pressure. After USC's lead grew to eight
points with 12:15 remaining in the game, Suminski
went on a run of eight unanswered points, including
two consecutive treys.
"We could play them 10 times and they'd probably
win nine-and-a-half of them," Trakh said. "But today
was almost that one."

As usual, the Sun Devils played their slow-paced
defensive style and were active on the boards, out-re
bounding the Cardinal 19-18 in the first half with a
whopping 13 offensive rebounds. Those rebounds cre
ated 35 shots for ASU in the half, as opposed to 20 for
Stanford.
Even after shooting 25.7 percent from the field to
the Cardinal's 50 percent, the Sun Devils trailed just
29-20 at intermission. In the meantime, Stanford's 56
points was its lowest total of the year.
However, Stanford's defense did ASU one better,
holding the Sun Devils to 31.1 percent shooting and
their fewest points of season.
"People look at our team and say They're not this,'
or They're not that,"' VanDerveer said. "A lot of peo
ple don't think we play much defense, so don't print it
so they think we do. Let's keep it a secret."
Wiggins, the tournament's Most Outstanding Play
er, led the Cardinal with 16 points and seven rebounds.
She averaged 16.7 points and nine rebounds in Stan
ford's three tournament games.
