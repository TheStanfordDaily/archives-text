# Men head to Staples after upset
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Coming off an ugly loss to Washington
State that put a temporarily lid on any NCAA
Tournament talk, the Stanford men's basket
ball team bounced back with its sweetest —
and most important — win of the season.
The Cardinal's 77-67 upset win over No. 10
Washington likely means Stanford's streak of
10 consecutive trips to NCAAs will remain in
tact when the 65-team field is revealed on Sun
day.
Yes, there was more to celebrate in Satur
day's regular-season finale at Maples Pavilion
than the careers of seniors Nick Robinson and
Rob Little.
For one, Stanford (17-11, 11-7 Pacific-1 ()
Conference) helped dash Washington's
chances of winning its first conference title
in 20 years. (Arizona, which was tied with
the Huskies for first place entering Satur
day's games, won at Arizona State later that
day to capture the Pac-10 title outright.) It
was also proper payback after Washington
ended Stanford's 26-game winning streak in
the final game of the regular season last
March.
Perhaps most importantly, however, it
showed that the Cardinal still have some gas in
the tank of their battered ride; it was a testa
ment to the resilience of this year's team, a
feel-good way to end the regular-season chap
ter of a trying, emotional campaign.
"This was a great win because we've been
so up and down this year, and to come out in
the last game in Maples for Nick and Rob and
to come off such a bad performance Thursday,
it shows we didn't give in," junior guard Chris
Hernandez said. "We showed people we still
have something in us."
Hernandez finished with 12 points and five
assists and got plenty of support from fellow
point guard Jason Haas. The junior reserve de
livered an inspired performance, doubling his
previous career-high with 18 points.
"After Thursday night I just said, 'Hey, we

can't play any worse than we did,'" Haas said.
"With three guys coming off the bench, some
one needs to be productive.
Haas was — scoring 13 of his points on 14
free-throw attempts, after getting to the line
by displaying an attack-the-glass mentality
with the Huskies focused on shutting down
Hernandez. Washington effectively dared
Haas to beat them on certain possessions, and
he did.
The win was a total team effort, however, as
junior forward Matt Haryasz chipped in a ca
reer-high 24 points to go along with 10 re
bounds.
"Everybody was bummed out about the
Thursday night game," Haryasz said. "1 think
everybody did a real good job of either using it
as fuel for this game or just forgetting about it
and coming out to play."
Stanford closed the first half with a 10-0 run
to head into the locker room with a 31-29 lead.
The Stanford defense held the high-octane
Huskies in check, as Washington shot just 9-
for-24 from long range after sinking 16 three
pointers two days prior against Cal.
Robinson scored 12 points and grabbed
nine rebounds in his final game at Maples
Pavilion. While Little's individual numbers (4
points, 4 rebounds, l-for-7 shooting) were for
gettable, the win will be one to remember.
"It was great," Robinson said. "I'm glad we
were able to come out and compete and get a
win. It was a lot of fun, I had a good time."
Stanford did the three simple things head
coach Trent Johnson has preached all season.
They outrebounded the Huskies 40-34, took
care of the ball (12 assists, 12 turnovers) and
played solid defense. Afterward, Johnson
made his thoughts about the team's postseason
hopes known.
"If we're not automatically in the NCAAs,
after beating Arizona and now these guys, and
the non-conference schedule we play, and all
the things these kids have been through since
I've been hired something's wrong."
Stanford now turns its attention to the Pac
-10 Tournament, in which it will play Washing

ton State in the first round at Staples Center in
Los Angeles tomorrow at 8:45 p.m. The tour
nament will run through Saturday.
While their first-round opponent is the
same as last year, the Cardinal's feeling head
ing into tomorrow's game is certainly different
than a year ago, when they had virtually locked
up a No. 1 seed in the Big Dance with a 26-1
regular-season record.
Despite the fact that most analysts consid
er Stanford a lock for the NCAA Tournament
regardless of the outcome of tomorrow's
game, Stanford has plenty to play for, includ
ing a better seed and a little revenge.
"It's a big game for us and it's one that we're
going to have to really get amped up for,"
Haryasz said. "I think it's one where we al
ready have all the motivation in the world to go
out and try to beat those guys."
The Cougars swept the season series
against Stanford and held the Cardinal to 12
first-half points in a 59-48 victory last Thurs
day. Hernandez and Haryasz have an idea of
how Stanford can avoid a third loss to the de
fensive-minded Cougars.
"I think we definitely need to come out with
a lot more effort, defensively and offensively,"
Hernandez said. "We need to get into a situa
tion where we don't get down against them
early, because then it's a long, long hole to try
to climb yourself out of."
"I think we're going to try to take it at them
a little more, try to get some fouls on them
early," Haryasz said. "We weren't very aggres
sive in the first half last week and that's going
to be important."
Notes: Junior guard Dan Grunfeld and Her
nandez were named to the 10-member Pac-10
First Team, as voted upon by the league's
coaches. Grunfeld was averaging 17.9 points
per game before he tore the ACL in his right
knee against Cal on Feb. 12. Hernandez, who
was an All-Pac-10 selection last year as well, is
averaging 15.1 points and 4 assists per game.
Haryasz was named Honorable Mention All-
Pac-10.

"I think we're going to try to take it at them
a little more, try to get some fouls on them
early," Haryasz said. "We weren't very aggres
sive in the first half last week and that's going
to be important."

nandez were named to the 10-member Pac-10
First Team, as voted upon by the league's
coaches. Grunfeld was averaging 17.9 points
per game before he tore the ACL in his right
knee against Cal on Feb. 12. Hernandez, who

Junior guard Jason Haas scored a career-high 18 points in the Cardinal's 77-67 upset
of No. 10 Washington Saturday.
Coming off an ugly loss to Washington
State that put a temporarily lid on any NCAA
Tournament talk, the Stanford men's basket
ball team bounced back with its sweetest —
and most important — win of the season.
The Cardinal's 77-67 upset win over No. 10
Washington likely means Stanford's streak of
10 consecutive trips to NCAAs will remain in
tact when the 65-team field is revealed on Sun
day.
Yes, there was more to celebrate in Satur
day's regular-season finale at Maples Pavilion
than the careers of seniors Nick Robinson and
Rob Little.
For one, Stanford (17-11, 11-7 Pacific-1 ()
Conference) helped dash Washington's
chances of winning its first conference title
in 20 years. (Arizona, which was tied with
the Huskies for first place entering Satur
day's games, won at Arizona State later that
day to capture the Pac-10 title outright.) It
was also proper payback after Washington
ended Stanford's 26-game winning streak in
the final game of the regular season last
March.
Perhaps most importantly, however, it
showed that the Cardinal still have some gas in
the tank of their battered ride; it was a testa
ment to the resilience of this year's team, a
feel-good way to end the regular-season chap
ter of a trying, emotional campaign.
"This was a great win because we've been
so up and down this year, and to come out in
the last game in Maples for Nick and Rob and
to come off such a bad performance Thursday,
it shows we didn't give in," junior guard Chris
Hernandez said. "We showed people we still
have something in us."
Hernandez finished with 12 points and five
assists and got plenty of support from fellow
point guard Jason Haas. The junior reserve de
livered an inspired performance, doubling his
previous career-high with 18 points.
"After Thursday night I just said, 'Hey, we

can't play any worse than we did,'" Haas said.
"With three guys coming off the bench, some
one needs to be productive.
Haas was — scoring 13 of his points on 14
free-throw attempts, after getting to the line
by displaying an attack-the-glass mentality
with the Huskies focused on shutting down
Hernandez. Washington effectively dared
Haas to beat them on certain possessions, and
he did.
The win was a total team effort, however, as
junior forward Matt Haryasz chipped in a ca
reer-high 24 points to go along with 10 re
bounds.
"Everybody was bummed out about the
Thursday night game," Haryasz said. "1 think
everybody did a real good job of either using it
as fuel for this game or just forgetting about it
and coming out to play."
Stanford closed the first half with a 10-0 run
to head into the locker room with a 31-29 lead.
The Stanford defense held the high-octane
Huskies in check, as Washington shot just 9-
for-24 from long range after sinking 16 three
pointers two days prior against Cal.
Robinson scored 12 points and grabbed
nine rebounds in his final game at Maples
Pavilion. While Little's individual numbers (4
points, 4 rebounds, l-for-7 shooting) were for
gettable, the win will be one to remember.
"It was great," Robinson said. "I'm glad we
were able to come out and compete and get a
win. It was a lot of fun, I had a good time."
Stanford did the three simple things head
coach Trent Johnson has preached all season.
They outrebounded the Huskies 40-34, took
care of the ball (12 assists, 12 turnovers) and
played solid defense. Afterward, Johnson
made his thoughts about the team's postseason
hopes known.
"If we're not automatically in the NCAAs,
after beating Arizona and now these guys, and
the non-conference schedule we play, and all
the things these kids have been through since
I've been hired something's wrong."
Stanford now turns its attention to the Pac
-10 Tournament, in which it will play Washing

ton State in the first round at Staples Center in
Los Angeles tomorrow at 8:45 p.m. The tour
nament will run through Saturday.
While their first-round opponent is the
same as last year, the Cardinal's feeling head
ing into tomorrow's game is certainly different
than a year ago, when they had virtually locked
up a No. 1 seed in the Big Dance with a 26-1
regular-season record.
Despite the fact that most analysts consid
er Stanford a lock for the NCAA Tournament
regardless of the outcome of tomorrow's
game, Stanford has plenty to play for, includ
ing a better seed and a little revenge.
"It's a big game for us and it's one that we're
going to have to really get amped up for,"
Haryasz said. "I think it's one where we al
ready have all the motivation in the world to go
out and try to beat those guys."
The Cougars swept the season series
against Stanford and held the Cardinal to 12
first-half points in a 59-48 victory last Thurs
day. Hernandez and Haryasz have an idea of
how Stanford can avoid a third loss to the de
fensive-minded Cougars.
"I think we definitely need to come out with
a lot more effort, defensively and offensively,"
Hernandez said. "We need to get into a situa
tion where we don't get down against them
early, because then it's a long, long hole to try
to climb yourself out of."
"I think we're going to try to take it at them
a little more, try to get some fouls on them
early," Haryasz said. "We weren't very aggres
sive in the first half last week and that's going
to be important."
