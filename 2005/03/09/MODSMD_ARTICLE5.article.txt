# Yale changes aid, follows Harvard
## 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
When Harvard significantly changed its financial aid
policy in hopes of better accommodating low-income stu
dents last spring, Yale administrators sat hack and let their
rival institution take the risk.
"We said at the time that we were going to watch and see
what happens," said Richard Levin, president of Yale, in a
March 4 New York Times article.
Yale liked what they saw. Levin said, and it decided last
Thursday that families whose annual incomes do not ex
ceed $45,(XX) will not be asked to pay tuition. Additionally,
the university will allow fora decrease in tuition contribu
tions from parents who earn between $45,000 and $60,000
a year.
Despite these changes, Stanford financial aid officers do
not predict any change in policies on the Farm.
Yale's tuition reductions for low-income students are
slightly larger than those at Harvard, whose current policy
exempts families earning $40,000 per year from making any
tuition payments. Still, Tom Conroy, a spokesperson for
Yale, told The Harvard Crimson that both Harvard and
Yale families to whom these policies apply will save around
$2,000 per year.
While Harvard's plan for its lowest income students ex
tends to a more narrow range of incomes than does Yale's,
its effort to trim tuition payments for families in the next in
come bracket encompasses those bringing in $40,000 to
$60,000 annually — a broader span of earnings than that of

Yale.
Karen Cooper, associate dean
and director of financial aid at Stan
ford, said she believes that Harvard
and Yale's policies can he helpful
because they are simpler than Stan
ford's, thus making discussion of fi
nancial aid easier for families and
applicants. However, she said she
does not believe that the policies
benefit low-income students more
than those currently practiced by
Stanford.
"Harvard and Yale's policy of no
parent contribution expectation for
families under a specified income
cutoff is much easier for families to
understand." Cooper said.
Most parents have no idea what
their expected contribution will be
until they have filled out all the
forms, which can be daunting, she
added.
"When Stanford's actual com
mitment to financial aid for low-in
come families is compared to that of
our peers, our financial aid practices
remain fully competitive and contin
ue to meet our goal of making Stan
ford an option for students from all
socio-economic backgrounds," she
said. "In fact, we believe our ap
proach more accurately identifies
low-income families and best sup
ports their needs."
Cooper qualified her claim by
pointing out that "one of (Stan
ford's) central commitments is to
pay close attention to what each
individual student is expected to
contribute — what we refer to as
the 'self-help' expectation." For
example, students whose families
contribute less than $3,000 to tu
ition "will be required to con
tribute significantly less than our
standard expectation" in regards
to self-help.
Self-help refers to student loans,
work study, employment off campus
and outside awards. Cooper said.
Harvard and Yale are not as ac
commodating when it comes to
these type of programs, she added.
"The new policies announced by
Harvard and Yale will make no ad
justment to the expected student
contributions or the 'self-help' ex
pectations of individual low-income
students," Cooper said.
She added that Stanford's 'self
help' flexibility for low-income stu
dents "has allowed such students not
only to attend Stanford but to more
fully take advantage of the resources
available here. Out commitment is
not only to financial aid but also to
ensuring more equal access to all
that Stanford offers."
Notably. Yale is also making ef
forts to open such opportunities to
low income students, according to
The New York Times article. Yale
will increase grants to its low-in
come undergraduate students to
work and study overseas. Levin said.
Other U.S. universities are also
changing their financial aid policies
for low-income students. The Uni
versity of Virginia will revoke all
work-study and loan requirements
for these students, according to The
New York Times, and Rice Univer
sity will cease to demand tuition
contributions from parents earning
less than $30,000 per year.
Overall, these policies are moti
vated by universities' desires to at
tract low-income students and to as
sist them more effectively during
their college years.
"We want to attract the most
promising students from all eco
nomic backgrounds to Yale," Levin
told The Crimson.
Cooper echoed this sentiment
and added that Stanford "has not
been losing low-income students —
or any sub-populations of admits for
that matter — to any of our com
petitors because of financial aid."

not predict any change in policies on the Farm.
Yale's tuition reductions for low-income students are
slightly larger than those at Harvard, whose current policy
exempts families earning $40,000 per year from making any
tuition payments. Still, Tom Conroy, a spokesperson for
Yale, told The Harvard Crimson that both Harvard and
Yale families to whom these policies apply will save around
$2,000 per year.
While Harvard's plan for its lowest income students ex
tends to a more narrow range of incomes than does Yale's,
its effort to trim tuition payments for families in the next in
come bracket encompasses those bringing in $40,000 to
$60,000 annually — a broader span of earnings than that of

Yale.
Karen Cooper, associate dean
and director of financial aid at Stan
ford, said she believes that Harvard
and Yale's policies can he helpful
because they are simpler than Stan
ford's, thus making discussion of fi
nancial aid easier for families and
applicants. However, she said she
does not believe that the policies
benefit low-income students more
than those currently practiced by
Stanford.
"Harvard and Yale's policy of no
parent contribution expectation for
families under a specified income
cutoff is much easier for families to
understand." Cooper said.
Most parents have no idea what
their expected contribution will be
until they have filled out all the
forms, which can be daunting, she
added.
"When Stanford's actual com
mitment to financial aid for low-in
come families is compared to that of
our peers, our financial aid practices
remain fully competitive and contin
ue to meet our goal of making Stan
ford an option for students from all
socio-economic backgrounds," she
said. "In fact, we believe our ap
proach more accurately identifies
low-income families and best sup
ports their needs."
Cooper qualified her claim by
pointing out that "one of (Stan
ford's) central commitments is to
pay close attention to what each
individual student is expected to
contribute — what we refer to as
the 'self-help' expectation." For
example, students whose families
contribute less than $3,000 to tu
ition "will be required to con
tribute significantly less than our
standard expectation" in regards
to self-help.
Self-help refers to student loans,
work study, employment off campus
and outside awards. Cooper said.
Harvard and Yale are not as ac
commodating when it comes to
these type of programs, she added.
"The new policies announced by
Harvard and Yale will make no ad
justment to the expected student
contributions or the 'self-help' ex
pectations of individual low-income
students," Cooper said.
She added that Stanford's 'self
help' flexibility for low-income stu
dents "has allowed such students not
only to attend Stanford but to more
fully take advantage of the resources
available here. Out commitment is
not only to financial aid but also to
ensuring more equal access to all
that Stanford offers."
Notably. Yale is also making ef
forts to open such opportunities to
low income students, according to
The New York Times article. Yale
will increase grants to its low-in
come undergraduate students to
work and study overseas. Levin said.
Other U.S. universities are also
changing their financial aid policies
for low-income students. The Uni
versity of Virginia will revoke all
work-study and loan requirements
for these students, according to The
New York Times, and Rice Univer
sity will cease to demand tuition
contributions from parents earning
less than $30,000 per year.
Overall, these policies are moti
vated by universities' desires to at
tract low-income students and to as
sist them more effectively during
their college years.
"We want to attract the most
promising students from all eco
nomic backgrounds to Yale," Levin
told The Crimson.
Cooper echoed this sentiment
and added that Stanford "has not
been losing low-income students —
or any sub-populations of admits for
that matter — to any of our com
petitors because of financial aid."
