### SAMUEL CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Blasting off the blocks with two winning relays
in the first of four days of competition at the Pa
cific-10 Conference Championships in Long
Beach, Calif., the No. 3 Stanford men's swimming
and diving team (6-1, 3-1 Pac-10) knew it had
something special.
After losing their No. 1 ranking after a loss to
Cal in the final dual meet of the season, the Cardi
nal headed into Pac-lOs as underdogs. But Stan
ford relished the role and demolished the majori
ty of the highly touted conference competitors en
route to a record point total of 932.5. The Cardi
nal, which set the previous Pac-10 record last sea
son with 866.5 points, captured their unprece
dented 24th consecutive league title. Cal finished
second with 882 points.
"It was clear after the first [events) that the
meet was ours to lose," said senior Gary Marshall,
who was named "Swimmer of the Meet," follow
ing outstanding swims in the 100-yard and 200-
yard breaststroke races. "Everyone had great
swims during that first session, and we took the
momentum."
Stanford led the competition after the first day

with 80 points, while Arizona and California were
tied for second at 66. In the two exceptional re
lays, the quartet of senior co-captains Jayme
Cramer and Matt McDonald and sophomores
Ricky Eddy and Ben Wildman-Tobriner set a new
Pac-10 record in the 200-yard medley relay. Car
dinal freshman Danny Beal, sophomores Andy
Grant and Shaun Phillips and Cramer then
clocked the second-fastest time in the nation this
year in the 800-yard freestyle relay.
On the second day of competition, Stanford
continued its domination, as the Cardinal swim
mers took four of the top five finishes in the 500-
yard freestyle event. While USC's Ous Melloui
took the top spot. Stanford junior Michael
McLean. Phillips and Grant took the next three
spots with NCAA automatic qualifying times.
McLean's swim of 4:14.89 seconds broke a school
record held by John Witchel since 1984. Beal pro
vided a strong showing to finish fifth in the event
and garner an NCAA consideration time.

pionships in the event. In the sprint
of the meet, Wildman-Tobriner
took the second spot in the 50-yard
freestyle, finishing only one hun
dredth of a second behind Cal's
Duje Draganja, who finished in
19.22 seconds.

The Cardinal built on their lead in
the first event of the third day, as ju
niors Mark Stephens and Oriwol
took second and third in the 400-yard
individual medley with the fifth and
seventh fastest times in school histo
ry. Senior Thomas Brown took the
eighth spot, finishing with an NCAA
consideration time of 3:53.22.
In the 100-yard butterfly,
Cramer, Wildman-Tobriner and
McDonald took on a competitive
field, finishing third, fifth and sev

enth, respectively, in the finals.
Though McDonald's time in the fi
nals was only an NCAA considera
tion time, it was more than one sec
ond slower than the time he set in
the preliminaries for this event,
when he clocked a 46.62 to automat
ically qualify for the NCAAs.
In the 200-yard freestyle, 100-
yard breaststroke and 100-yard
backstroke, Stanford regained its
top form. Grant took the top time in
the 200-yard freestyle at 1:34.38, fol
lowed by the Cardinal's Phillips,
McLean and Beal, who also gar
nered NCAA automatic bids. In the
100-yard breaststroke, Gary Mar
shall was crowned as the Pac-10
champion, breaking his own confer
ence record that he set in the prelim
inaries, clocking a 52.55. In the next
event, Cramer continued Stanford's
winning ways, leading the way in the
100-yard backstroke, to beat out
teammates Sun and McDonald, who
also finished with NCAA qualifying
times.
The Cardinal's Cramer, Mar
shall, McDonald and Wildman-To
briner took the liberty of closing out
the day's events in fashion, combin
ing to break the Pac-10 record in the
400-yard medley relay, finishing
with a time of 3:06.69.
Leading by 68.5 points entering
the final day of competition, Stan
ford showed no signs of letting up. In
the 1650-yard freestyle event,
Phillips outlasted USC's Larsen
Jensen to take top honors and beat
the Olympic 1500-meter silver
medalist by over nine seconds.
"We never feel we have anything
'wrapped up' before it's over,"
Phillips said. "We approached each
session like it was our last and fought
as hard as we could. The end result
was our 24th straight Pac-10 title."
Wildman-Tobriner set a new
Cardinal record and finished third in
the 100-yard freestyle and two addi
tional Pac-10 records were broken as
Marshall won the 200-yard breast
stroke and Cramer set a meet record
in the 200-yard butterfly.
Stanford now looks ahead to the
NCAA Championships in Min
neapolis, Minn., from March 24 to
26. The Cardinal placed second at
NCAAs last season.
Preparing for his final collegiate

pionships in the event. In the sprint
of the meet, Wildman-Tobriner
took the second spot in the 50-yard
freestyle, finishing only one hun
dredth of a second behind Cal's
Duje Draganja, who finished in
19.22 seconds.

The Cardinal built on their lead in
the first event of the third day, as ju
niors Mark Stephens and Oriwol
took second and third in the 400-yard
individual medley with the fifth and
seventh fastest times in school histo
ry. Senior Thomas Brown took the
eighth spot, finishing with an NCAA
consideration time of 3:53.22.
In the 100-yard butterfly,
Cramer, Wildman-Tobriner and
McDonald took on a competitive
field, finishing third, fifth and sev

enth, respectively, in the finals.
Though McDonald's time in the fi
nals was only an NCAA considera
tion time, it was more than one sec
ond slower than the time he set in
the preliminaries for this event,
when he clocked a 46.62 to automat
ically qualify for the NCAAs.
In the 200-yard freestyle, 100-
yard breaststroke and 100-yard
backstroke, Stanford regained its
top form. Grant took the top time in
the 200-yard freestyle at 1:34.38, fol
lowed by the Cardinal's Phillips,
McLean and Beal, who also gar
nered NCAA automatic bids. In the
100-yard breaststroke, Gary Mar
shall was crowned as the Pac-10
champion, breaking his own confer
ence record that he set in the prelim
inaries, clocking a 52.55. In the next
event, Cramer continued Stanford's
winning ways, leading the way in the
100-yard backstroke, to beat out
teammates Sun and McDonald, who
also finished with NCAA qualifying
times.
The Cardinal's Cramer, Mar
shall, McDonald and Wildman-To
briner took the liberty of closing out
the day's events in fashion, combin
ing to break the Pac-10 record in the
400-yard medley relay, finishing
with a time of 3:06.69.
Leading by 68.5 points entering
the final day of competition, Stan
ford showed no signs of letting up. In
the 1650-yard freestyle event,
Phillips outlasted USC's Larsen
Jensen to take top honors and beat
the Olympic 1500-meter silver
medalist by over nine seconds.
"We never feel we have anything
'wrapped up' before it's over,"
Phillips said. "We approached each
session like it was our last and fought
as hard as we could. The end result
was our 24th straight Pac-10 title."
Wildman-Tobriner set a new
Cardinal record and finished third in
the 100-yard freestyle and two addi
tional Pac-10 records were broken as
Marshall won the 200-yard breast
stroke and Cramer set a meet record
in the 200-yard butterfly.
Stanford now looks ahead to the
NCAA Championships in Min
neapolis, Minn., from March 24 to
26. The Cardinal placed second at
NCAAs last season.
Preparing for his final collegiate
meet, Marshall is ever optimistic.
"This weekend was impressive,
but our best performances are yet to
come," he said.
Blasting off the blocks with two winning relays
in the first of four days of competition at the Pa
cific-10 Conference Championships in Long
Beach, Calif., the No. 3 Stanford men's swimming
and diving team (6-1, 3-1 Pac-10) knew it had
something special.
After losing their No. 1 ranking after a loss to
Cal in the final dual meet of the season, the Cardi
nal headed into Pac-lOs as underdogs. But Stan
ford relished the role and demolished the majori
ty of the highly touted conference competitors en
route to a record point total of 932.5. The Cardi
nal, which set the previous Pac-10 record last sea
son with 866.5 points, captured their unprece
dented 24th consecutive league title. Cal finished
second with 882 points.
"It was clear after the first [events) that the
meet was ours to lose," said senior Gary Marshall,
who was named "Swimmer of the Meet," follow
ing outstanding swims in the 100-yard and 200-
yard breaststroke races. "Everyone had great
swims during that first session, and we took the
momentum."
