Blasting off the blocks with two winning relays
in the first of four days of competition at the Pa
cific-10 Conference Championships in Long
Beach, Calif., the No. 3 Stanford men's swimming
and diving team (6-1, 3-1 Pac-10) knew it had
something special.
After losing their No. 1 ranking after a loss to
Cal in the final dual meet of the season, the Cardi
nal headed into Pac-lOs as underdogs. But Stan
ford relished the role and demolished the majori
ty of the highly touted conference competitors en
route to a record point total of 932.5. The Cardi
nal, which set the previous Pac-10 record last sea
son with 866.5 points, captured their unprece
dented 24th consecutive league title. Cal finished
second with 882 points.
"It was clear after the first [events) that the
meet was ours to lose," said senior Gary Marshall,
who was named "Swimmer of the Meet," follow
ing outstanding swims in the 100-yard and 200-
yard breaststroke races. "Everyone had great
swims during that first session, and we took the
momentum."
Stanford led the competition after the first day

with 80 points, while Arizona and California were
tied for second at 66. In the two exceptional re
lays, the quartet of senior co-captains Jayme
Cramer and Matt McDonald and sophomores
Ricky Eddy and Ben Wildman-Tobriner set a new
Pac-10 record in the 200-yard medley relay. Car
dinal freshman Danny Beal, sophomores Andy
Grant and Shaun Phillips and Cramer then
clocked the second-fastest time in the nation this
year in the 800-yard freestyle relay.
On the second day of competition, Stanford
continued its domination, as the Cardinal swim
mers took four of the top five finishes in the 500-
yard freestyle event. While USC's Ous Melloui
took the top spot. Stanford junior Michael
McLean. Phillips and Grant took the next three
spots with NCAA automatic qualifying times.
McLean's swim of 4:14.89 seconds broke a school
record held by John Witchel since 1984. Beal pro
vided a strong showing to finish fifth in the event
and garner an NCAA consideration time.
