# Nelson leads Cardinal attack in Fullerton
## Softball goes 2-1 at Invite 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
Weather has not been kind to the Cardinal,
but the No. 3 Stanford Softball team (18-2) makes
the most of the games it plays. After the first two
games of the Worth Invitational in Fullerton,
Calif., were cancelled due to rain, Stanford played
the remaining three games, finishing with two
wins and a loss.
In Saturday's first game, the Cardinal came
out swinging to take a 8-0 victory over Boston
College. In keeping with her recent trend, fresh
man third baseman Michelle Smith hammered
two home runs to finish with three RBI. Fellow
freshman Anna Beardman also finished with
three RBI, and junior Catalina Morris con
tributed two. Freshman righthander Lauren
Nydam (6-0) picked up the win. pitching the
shutout while giving up only one run and one
walk over five innings.
Beardman scored senior Meghan Sickler in
the second inning to put the Cardinal on the
board. Smith sent one out of the park in the third,
her eighth homer of the season. Morris scored
Beardman with an RBI single in the fourth and
another blast from Smith opened the floodgates
in the fifth inning. Beardman's single scored Nel
son and senior Heather Shook, and Erin Howe
got home on a sacrifice fly by Morris, putting the
Cardinal up by eight and ending the game by the
mercy rule.
"I thought we started out really well after hav
ing a day rained out and just sitting around in our
hotel," head coach John Rittman said. 'Tin real
ly pleased with the way we hit the ball against
Boston College."
After that blowout, Stanford was surprised by
No. 23 Northwestern, which pulled out a 6-1 vic
tory over the Cardinal.
The Wildcats started scoring early, putting up
two runs in the first inning on a sacrifice fly and a
fielding error. Freshman Tricia Aggabao scored
in the second to close the gap, but Stanford would
not come any closer. A two-run homer in the third
inning sealed the deal for Northwestern, giving
them an insurmountable 4-1 lead. The Wildcats
final two runs came on another fielding error in
the fifth inning and an RBI single in the sixth. Ju
nior Laura Severson (9-2) took the loss with three
earned runs and five strikeouts in five innings.
"It was a bit of a letdown against Northwest
ern," Rittman said. "We didn't hit our best game
and we didn't pitch our best game. It seemed like

every ball we hit was right at them. Their pitcher
did a good job on us and they got big hits when
they needed them. And we stranded some great
opportunities."
Stanford finished out the tournament Sun
day with a matchup against host Cal State-
Fullerton. After giving up two runs in the bot
tom of the second inning, the Cardinal mounted
a comeback in the third, closing the gap to one
with a solo homer from Morris. A three-run
blast by senior catcher Leah Nelson catapulted
Stanford to a 4-2 lead, but Fullerton answered
with a two-run homer of its own to tie the score
at 4-4.
Nelson's two-run homer in the fifth inning
proved to be the difference in a 6-4 Stanford vic
tory. Nydam started in the circle, giving up four
runs in three innings. Severson came in to finish
the game and earn the win.
After five straight weekends of tournament
play, the team will have a break to rest — and
study — before jumping back into action at the
Stanford Round Robin, March 19 to 20. The
Cardinal will play two games each against Utah
(8-12) and Princeton (4-0). Utah is currently rid
ing a two-game losing streak, having lost to No.
11 UC-Davis and Miami. Princeton opened its
season this weekend at the East Carolina Pirate
Clash, taking first place in the tournament.
"Last year Princeton had a very good team,"
Rittman said. "They started out hot, then
slowed down. Utah was a postseason team. We
saw them in our regional and it was a really close
game, 1-0."
Stanford will play host once again at the Stan
ford Classic, March 24 to 26. The Cardinal will
kick off the Classic with a double-header against
Hawaii (9-8) and Saint Mary's (3-11). On Friday
they will play another double-header, with a re
match against Northwestern and a game against
Illinois (8-5). They will end the tournament on
Saturday against UNLV (12-9).
"That tournament is loaded with good
teams," Rittman said. "It will be a really good test
for us before we go to Fresno fora double-head
er. They have a really good team this year."
The Cardinal will wrap up the preseason with
a midweek double-header with Fresno State.
Stanford will face its first conference foe on
April 1, visiting No. 1 Arizona (13-0). Last season,
the Cardinal split both series against the Wildcats.
"We just need to take it one game at a time in
the Pac-10," Rittman said. "Our girls will be ready
for them."
