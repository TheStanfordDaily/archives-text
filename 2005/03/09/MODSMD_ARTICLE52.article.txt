# Volleyball earns road split
## No. 8 Card defeat Northridge 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITER 
For the first time since the beginning of the season, the
men's volleyball team pulled to an even conference record
last weekend.
The No. 8 Cardinal's defeat of No. 9 Cal-State Northridge
(9-10,6-9 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) on Friday put
them on a season-high four-game winning streak.
However, they had less than a day to enjoy it. Stanford
fell to No. 5 UC-Santa Barbara (11-7,11-4 MPSF) the next
evening, and the Cardinal fell back to a losing conference
record (8-10,7-8 MPSF).
A number of Stanford players contributed to the strong
performance against Northridge. Redshirt senior Kevin
Hansen posted a double-double with 13 digs and 49 assists,
the majority of those assists going to junior Ben Reddy, who
had 19 kills in the match, three of them service aces. Seniors
David Vogel and Craig Buell each contributed 11 kills and
junior Chris Ahlfeldt had eight kills, six block assists and
two solo blocks.
Blocking played a key role in a match in which there was
only a .009 difference between the two teams' hitting per
centages. In fact, the Matadors held the advantage in that
department, out-hitting Stanford .329 to .320.
But the Cardinal stuffed Northridge with 10.5 blocks
while the Matadors had four. Furthermore, Northridge
committed a season-high 25 service errors. As a result,
Stanford won the first two games by scores of 30-27. De
spite dropping game three 30-27, the Cardinal closed out
the match with a 30-28 victory in game four.
Immediately after the Northridge match, the Stanford
bus left for Santa Barbara. With little time to rest, the Car
dinal found themselves thrown into a heated battle against
the Gauchos.
The first two games went into extra points. Stanford
came from behind late in game one to claim the first victo

ry 33-31. In that game, they out-hit UCSB .308 to .191. But
the Gauchos responded by taking the second game with the
same score, following a lineup change as junior Bart Kowal
ski replaced junior Dane Jenson at the setter position.
The final two games were less tightly fought. The Gau
chos sealed the match with a 30-23 and a 30-24 win. In the
fourth game, the Cardinal fought hack from a four-point
deficit to tie the game at 19-19 and again at 21-21. Howev
er, UCSB then pulled away to win the match on a Stanford
attack error. The Gaucho defense kept the Cardinal to a
.(KK3 hitting percentage in that game.
In the match, Hansen posted his second double-double
of the weekend with 57 assists and 13 digs. Reddy again led
the Cardinal in kills with 16, followed by Buell with 15 and
Vogel with 14. Vogel's 10 digs gave him a double-double as
well. Ahlfeldt repeated his performance from the night be
fore with two more solo blocks.
The real undoing for the Stanford team was not Gaucho
sophomore Evan Patak, as was the case earlier this season
in the Cardinal's 3-2 loss to UCSB on Jan. 29. This time, the
Cardinal held Patak to a.(XX) hitting percentage, allowing
him only 12 kills.
Instead, Gaucho freshman Theo Brunner was the sur
prise force behind UCSB's 3-1 win. A 6-foot-7 middle
blocker, Brunner led the Gauchos with a match-high .607
hitting percentage and a career-high 19 kills. Brunner also
had a career-best four solo blocks.
The Cardinal were missing a freshman of their own: out
side hitter Matt Ceran broke his finger in practice last week
and is out for the season. This led to lineup changes for
Stanford, and freshman Jesse Meredith came in for his sec
ond game of the season, contributing four kills with a 1.000
hitting percentage.
Stanford will enjoy a two-week break from competition.
The Cardinal will resume play March 25 in another back-to
back road trip against No. 2 Pepperdine (12-1, 12-1 M PSF)
and unranked USC (5-16,1-11 MPSF).
