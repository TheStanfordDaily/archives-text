Stanford's KC Corkery and Sam War
burg can add their names to the prestigious
list of winners of the Pacific Coast Doubles
Championships.
The No. 13 Stanford men's tennis team
(8-4) traveled to La Jolla, Calif., last week
end to compete in the 116 th Pacific Coast
Doubles Championships, the second-old
est tennis event in the United States.
Teams such as No. 4 UCLA, No. 11 Texas
A&M, No. 14 Pepperdine and No. 17 USC
also sent players; however, the tourna
ment was open to anybody who wanted to
play in it, not just collegiate players. Cork
ery and Warburg are the first Stanford
players to win the Pacific Coast Doubles
title since Geoff Abrams and Alex Kim
did in 1999.
"To see the names that are on that tro
phy and see the people who have won and
played that event, the big names of tennis,
it's pretty impressive," head coach John
Whitlinger said. "[Sam and KC] are very
honored to have their name on that trophy
as well."
A California native, Corkery has been
competing in the tournament since he was
16 years old and has reached the semifinals
a few times, including his freshman year
when he played with James Pade, a junior
who is redshirting this year.
"It's definitely a very prestigious tour
nament," Corkery said. "It's the second
longest running tournament in the U.S.
and one of the longest running tourna
ments in the world. I've been close [to win
ning] a few times, and it was great to final
ly win it, a tremendous honor."
The Cardinal sent four doubles pairs to
compete at the tournament, held by the
beach just northwest of San Diego. In ad
dition to Corkery and Warburg, Stanford
sent junior Phil Sheng and freshman part
ner Phil Kao, sophomore pair Eric McK
ean and James Wan and the new pair of ju
nior Jon Wong and sophomore Dave
Ryan.
As the No. 1 seed. Corkery and War
burg received a bye in the round of 128 on
Friday. Cardinal teammates McKean and
Wan made a strong showing in the first
round as they failed to give up a single
game to their opponents. Matt Rubenstein
and Kavi Sud of William and Mary. Sheng
and Kao also notched first-round wins
against an independent team, with their
win coming in split sets. Wong and Ryan
suffered a first-round loss 7-6,6-2.
After their first-round loss, Wong and
Ryan competed in the consolation brack
et. They won the first match, received a de
fault and then fell 8-4 to a duo that consist
ed of a player from Cal as well as the Gold
en Bears' coach.

"[Jon and Dave] got experience, and
neither one of them has played this tour
nament before," Whitlinger said. "As a
former player and now a coach, it's an
honor to be able to play in that tourna
ment. It's going to be an experience they'll
never forget."
In the round of 64, Corkery and War
burg breezed through a team from UC-
San Diego, 6-0,6-2. A UCLA team hand
ed McKean and Wan a loss and two for
mer USC players defeated Sheng and
Kao.
As the only remaining Stanford team in
the main draw, Corkery and Warburg won
three matches on Saturday, defeating
teams from Texas A&M, San Diego State
and Pepperdine en route to the semifinals.
In addition to the defeat of San Diego
State's No. 9 seed, the defending NCAA
champions also notched a close 8-6 win
against the No. 5 seed, Pepperdine's Pedro
Rico and Scott Doerner.
On Sunday morning, Corkery and War
burg defeated California's Patrick Briaud
and Conor Niland 6-4,6-4 for the third con
secutive time to advance to the finals.
"(Sam and KC] played a good team in
the quarters, a Cal team that they've beat
en before," Whitlinger said. "It's tough to
beat any team three times in a row, and

they did that against Cal in straight sets."
Facing the tournament's No. 2 seeded
duo - Brett Joelson and Ante Matijevic of
Texas A&M- in the finals, Stanford
claimed the first set 6-2 but then narrowly
gave up the second set 6-4. The Cardinal
eventually prevailed by claiming the third
set 6-4.
Corkery said he was pleased with the
pair's overall performance in the tourna
ment.
"1 thought we played pretty well," he
said. "We returned really well throughout
the tournament and kept ourselves in the
matches. It's beautiful, right there on the
beach, but I'm really pleased with how fo
cused we were able to stay. I think from the
beginning we knew we had a chance to
win, and it was really special being able to
stay focused and really keep on track with
what we wanted to do."
Stanford is set to take on Santa Clara
on March 21 at the Taube Family Tennis
Stadium.
"We have to get the ball rolling pretty
quickly [after finals]," Whitlinger said.
"Santa Clara is a match that cannot be
overlooked, and we have be ready to play.
They'll be pumped up to play us, and we
have to match their level of intensity and
surpass it."

"1 thought we played pretty well," he
said. "We returned really well throughout
the tournament and kept ourselves in the
matches. It's beautiful, right there on the
beach, but I'm really pleased with how fo
cused we were able to stay. I think from the
beginning we knew we had a chance to
win, and it was really special being able to
stay focused and really keep on track with
what we wanted to do."
Stanford is set to take on Santa Clara
on March 21 at the Taube Family Tennis
Stadium.
"We have to get the ball rolling pretty
quickly [after finals]," Whitlinger said.
"Santa Clara is a match that cannot be
overlooked, and we have be ready to play.
They'll be pumped up to play us, and we
have to match their level of intensity and
surpass it."

Stanford's KC Corkery and Sam War
burg can add their names to the prestigious
list of winners of the Pacific Coast Doubles
Championships.
The No. 13 Stanford men's tennis team
(8-4) traveled to La Jolla, Calif., last week
end to compete in the 116 th Pacific Coast
Doubles Championships, the second-old
est tennis event in the United States.
Teams such as No. 4 UCLA, No. 11 Texas
A&M, No. 14 Pepperdine and No. 17 USC
also sent players; however, the tourna
ment was open to anybody who wanted to
play in it, not just collegiate players. Cork
ery and Warburg are the first Stanford
players to win the Pacific Coast Doubles
title since Geoff Abrams and Alex Kim
did in 1999.
"To see the names that are on that tro
phy and see the people who have won and
played that event, the big names of tennis,
it's pretty impressive," head coach John
Whitlinger said. "[Sam and KC] are very
honored to have their name on that trophy
as well."
A California native, Corkery has been
competing in the tournament since he was
16 years old and has reached the semifinals
a few times, including his freshman year
when he played with James Pade, a junior
who is redshirting this year.
"It's definitely a very prestigious tour
nament," Corkery said. "It's the second
longest running tournament in the U.S.
and one of the longest running tourna
ments in the world. I've been close [to win
ning] a few times, and it was great to final
ly win it, a tremendous honor."
The Cardinal sent four doubles pairs to
compete at the tournament, held by the
beach just northwest of San Diego. In ad
dition to Corkery and Warburg, Stanford
sent junior Phil Sheng and freshman part
ner Phil Kao, sophomore pair Eric McK
ean and James Wan and the new pair of ju
nior Jon Wong and sophomore Dave
Ryan.
As the No. 1 seed. Corkery and War
burg received a bye in the round of 128 on
Friday. Cardinal teammates McKean and
Wan made a strong showing in the first
round as they failed to give up a single
game to their opponents. Matt Rubenstein
and Kavi Sud of William and Mary. Sheng
and Kao also notched first-round wins
against an independent team, with their
win coming in split sets. Wong and Ryan
suffered a first-round loss 7-6,6-2.
After their first-round loss, Wong and
Ryan competed in the consolation brack
et. They won the first match, received a de
fault and then fell 8-4 to a duo that consist
ed of a player from Cal as well as the Gold
en Bears' coach.

"[Jon and Dave] got experience, and
neither one of them has played this tour
nament before," Whitlinger said. "As a
former player and now a coach, it's an
honor to be able to play in that tourna
ment. It's going to be an experience they'll
never forget."
In the round of 64, Corkery and War
burg breezed through a team from UC-
San Diego, 6-0,6-2. A UCLA team hand
ed McKean and Wan a loss and two for
mer USC players defeated Sheng and
Kao.
