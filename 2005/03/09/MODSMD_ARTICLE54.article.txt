# Wrestlers head to NCAAs
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team's (6-7-1,2-5-2 Pacific-10 Con
ference) co-captains, senior Matt Gentry and junior Imad
Kharbush, will travel to the NCAA Championships with
something to prove. After falling short in their bids to repeat
as Pac-10 champions at the conference tournament nearly two
weeks ago, the team's leaders will head to St. Louis, Mo.,
where even more will be on the line: a national title.
Gentry, the defending NCAA champion at 157 pounds,
suffered his second loss of the season in the Pac-10 Tourna
ment finals. 3-1 to Brian Stith of No. 21 Arizona State via a
last-second takedown.
"It was very frustrating, just because Matt has deserved a
second conference title," head coach Steve Buddie said. "But,
this will propel him to a much more important title, a nation
al one. Gentry will be the first one to tell you that he didn't
wrestle well. It was the second time this year I watched Matt
wrestle passively, [but] he's already turned his style around

since that match, and having this chip on his shoulder will pro
vide great incentive for him in St. Louis."
"It hurt pretty bad to not get that Pac-10 title, especially
against a guy that 1 have beat three times this year," Gentry
said. But he's a good competitor and he had a great match. I
think part of the problem at Pac-lOs was I was thinking too
much about him and trying to control what he was doing in
stead of focusing on myself.
"I just need to focus on going out to NCAAs and wrestling
an aggressive, dominating style. If I do that, I'll reach my goal,
which is to win a national title and to win the outstanding
wrestler award. I've got an international career ahead of me,
so this isn't the last of my wrestling. But right now I've got to
focus on myself and accomplish these goals in the next week,
which is kind of crazy after five years of pretty intense train
ing."
Kharbush, a dominant 174-pounder, has two tough past
performances for motivation. At Pac-lOs, Kharbush dropped
a 2-1 overtime decision to Leonel
Sanchez of Cal State-Fullerton, the
eventual conference champion.
Kharbush then rebounded to take
third place with two victories. He
also struggled in the NCAA tourna
ment last season as he went 0-2 and
was eliminated from the consola
tion bracket by losing a 4-3 decision
to Sanchez. His past setbacks do

not faze Kharbush.
"I won [Pac-lOs] last year, so I've
had the experience," Kharbush
said. "The only thing you get for
winning that tournament is a tiny
paper-weight-looking object. No
one will remember you in five years
as 'the guy who won the conference
tournament in 2005.'
"There are about three people
and a squirrel that attend that
tournament to watch. What peo
ple will remember, though, is if
you are able to gain All-American
status. That doesn't happen at
Pac-lOs; it happens at the NCAA

tourney in front of a crowd of
thousands."
Stanford could also have a third
NCAA participant depending upon
the health of other Pac-10
wrestlers. Senior 125-pounder
Nathan Peterson is a second alter
nate for the Championships after
an impressive fifth-place finish at
Pac-lOs.
"Peterson probably wrestled the
best of anyone on the team and de
served to go to the NCAA tourna
ment," Buddie said. "Unfortunate
ly, he was in the toughest weight in
the conference, and wildcard selec

tions can get very political. I'm hop
ing that as a second alternate, he'll
get the chance to compete one last
time that he deserves."
As the number of team members
still practicing dwindles, training is
becoming more and more special
ized to each of the three wrestlers'
needs.
In addition to the physical train
ing, Kharbush has also focused on
mentally preparing for NCAAs.
"I've decided that I've taken
some of the fun out of it for myself
by overthinking my matches. I seem
to wrestle my best at tournaments

immediately after I lose a match I
shouldn't have. 1 think it's because
I just go out there and wrestle with
out really worrying about the out
come of the match. As odd as it
sounds, that's the approach I'm tak
ing into NCAAs, and I feel really
good about it - [there's] so much
less stress."
With the end of the season ap
proaching, the team is already
thinking about hitting the mats
again next fall.
"I think this season got us the ex
perience we needed to be successful
next year," Buddie said. "We had

some first time starters that will be
relentless next year. We will lose
about three starters for next season,
but we have outstanding wrestlers
ready to step in and fill big shoes. I
know the team is excited for both
seeing their teammates compete in
St. Louis in a few weeks and for al
ready jumpstarting next season.
Our team competed with a lot of
heart all year long, and we're build
ing a very strong foundation for fu
ture years."

perience we needed to be successful
next year," Buddie said. "We had

some first time starters that will be
relentless next year. We will lose
about three starters for next season,
but we have outstanding wrestlers
ready to step in and fill big shoes. I
know the team is excited for both
seeing their teammates compete in
St. Louis in a few weeks and for al
ready jumpstarting next season.
Our team competed with a lot of
heart all year long, and we're build
ing a very strong foundation for fu
ture years."
The NCAA Tournament in St.
Louis starts on March 17 and ends
on March 19.
The Stanford wrestling team's (6-7-1,2-5-2 Pacific-10 Con
ference) co-captains, senior Matt Gentry and junior Imad
Kharbush, will travel to the NCAA Championships with
something to prove. After falling short in their bids to repeat
as Pac-10 champions at the conference tournament nearly two
weeks ago, the team's leaders will head to St. Louis, Mo.,
where even more will be on the line: a national title.
Gentry, the defending NCAA champion at 157 pounds,
suffered his second loss of the season in the Pac-10 Tourna
ment finals. 3-1 to Brian Stith of No. 21 Arizona State via a
last-second takedown.
"It was very frustrating, just because Matt has deserved a
second conference title," head coach Steve Buddie said. "But,
this will propel him to a much more important title, a nation
al one. Gentry will be the first one to tell you that he didn't
wrestle well. It was the second time this year I watched Matt
wrestle passively, [but] he's already turned his style around

since that match, and having this chip on his shoulder will pro
vide great incentive for him in St. Louis."
"It hurt pretty bad to not get that Pac-10 title, especially
against a guy that 1 have beat three times this year," Gentry
said. But he's a good competitor and he had a great match. I
think part of the problem at Pac-lOs was I was thinking too
much about him and trying to control what he was doing in
stead of focusing on myself.
"I just need to focus on going out to NCAAs and wrestling
an aggressive, dominating style. If I do that, I'll reach my goal,
which is to win a national title and to win the outstanding
wrestler award. I've got an international career ahead of me,
so this isn't the last of my wrestling. But right now I've got to
focus on myself and accomplish these goals in the next week,
which is kind of crazy after five years of pretty intense train
ing."
Kharbush, a dominant 174-pounder, has two tough past
performances for motivation. At Pac-lOs, Kharbush dropped
a 2-1 overtime decision to Leonel
Sanchez of Cal State-Fullerton, the
eventual conference champion.
Kharbush then rebounded to take
third place with two victories. He
also struggled in the NCAA tourna
ment last season as he went 0-2 and
was eliminated from the consola
tion bracket by losing a 4-3 decision
to Sanchez. His past setbacks do

not faze Kharbush.
"I won [Pac-lOs] last year, so I've
had the experience," Kharbush
said. "The only thing you get for
winning that tournament is a tiny
paper-weight-looking object. No
one will remember you in five years
as 'the guy who won the conference
tournament in 2005.'
"There are about three people
and a squirrel that attend that
tournament to watch. What peo
ple will remember, though, is if
you are able to gain All-American
status. That doesn't happen at
Pac-lOs; it happens at the NCAA

tourney in front of a crowd of
thousands."
Stanford could also have a third
NCAA participant depending upon
the health of other Pac-10
wrestlers. Senior 125-pounder
Nathan Peterson is a second alter
nate for the Championships after
an impressive fifth-place finish at
Pac-lOs.
"Peterson probably wrestled the
best of anyone on the team and de
served to go to the NCAA tourna
ment," Buddie said. "Unfortunate
ly, he was in the toughest weight in
the conference, and wildcard selec

tions can get very political. I'm hop
ing that as a second alternate, he'll
get the chance to compete one last
time that he deserves."
As the number of team members
still practicing dwindles, training is
becoming more and more special
ized to each of the three wrestlers'
needs.
In addition to the physical train
ing, Kharbush has also focused on
mentally preparing for NCAAs.
"I've decided that I've taken
some of the fun out of it for myself
by overthinking my matches. I seem
to wrestle my best at tournaments

immediately after I lose a match I
shouldn't have. 1 think it's because
I just go out there and wrestle with
out really worrying about the out
come of the match. As odd as it
sounds, that's the approach I'm tak
ing into NCAAs, and I feel really
good about it - [there's] so much
less stress."
With the end of the season ap
proaching, the team is already
thinking about hitting the mats
again next fall.
"I think this season got us the ex
perience we needed to be successful
next year," Buddie said. "We had

some first time starters that will be
relentless next year. We will lose
about three starters for next season,
but we have outstanding wrestlers
ready to step in and fill big shoes. I
know the team is excited for both
seeing their teammates compete in
