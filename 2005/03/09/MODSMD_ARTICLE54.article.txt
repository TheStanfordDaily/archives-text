### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team's (6-7-1,2-5-2 Pacific-10 Con
ference) co-captains, senior Matt Gentry and junior Imad
Kharbush, will travel to the NCAA Championships with
something to prove. After falling short in their bids to repeat
as Pac-10 champions at the conference tournament nearly two
weeks ago, the team's leaders will head to St. Louis, Mo.,
where even more will be on the line: a national title.
Gentry, the defending NCAA champion at 157 pounds,
suffered his second loss of the season in the Pac-10 Tourna

"It was very frustrating, just because Matt has deserved a

this will propel him to a much more important title, a nation
al one. Gentry will be the first one to tell you that he didn't
wrestle well. It was the second time this year I watched Matt
wrestle passively, [but] he's already turned his style around

since that match, and having this chip on his shoulder will pro
vide great incentive for him in St. Louis."
"It hurt pretty bad to not get that Pac-10 title, especially
against a guy that 1 have beat three times this year," Gentry
said. But he's a good competitor and he had a great match. I
think part of the problem at Pac-lOs was I was thinking too
much about him and trying to control what he was doing in
stead of focusing on myself.
"I just need to focus on going out to NCAAs and wrestling
an aggressive, dominating style. If I do that, I'll reach my goal,
which is to win a national title and to win the outstanding
wrestler award. I've got an international career ahead of me,
so this isn't the last of my wrestling. But right now I've got to
focus on myself and accomplish these goals in the next week,
which is kind of crazy after five years of pretty intense train
ing."
Kharbush, a dominant 174-pounder, has two tough past
performances for motivation. At Pac-lOs, Kharbush dropped
