# Lacrosse loses home opener
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's next games can't come soon enough
for the women's lacrosse team, which would like to
forget this past weekend with a win as quickly as
possible. In front of a home crowd for the first time
this season, Stanford (3-2, 3-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) suffered its first two losses, 8-7
to unranked Connecticut Friday afternoon and 10-
6 to No. 5 Georgetown Sunday afternoon.
Although the Friday tilt was the season-opener
for Connecticut, Stanford knew the Huskies would
rely heavily upon preseason All-American Tracy
Mullaney, as she lead the 2004 squad with 41 goals.
Mullaney scored three consecutive goals to give
Connecticut a 5-4 halftime lead and a 6-4 lead with
15:51 left. The Cardinal quickly halved the deficit
with senior midfielder Kelsey Twist's first goal of
the game and erased it entirely with senior mid
fielder Nina Pantano's third.
However, the Huskies would score the next two
goals with 10:08 and 2:04 left in the game. Pantano's
fourth goal with 1:17 left would prove too little, too
late for the Cardinal, who suffered their first loss of
the season in a close-fought game. Although the
teams scored a total of 15 goals, neither team ever
led by more than two goals.
"Connecticut was a really exciting game," Pan
tano said. "We went goal for goal and were one be
hind the entire game. We just couldn't seem to
catch {hem."
"The game came down to who was able to suc
cessfully get the ball across the midfield," freshman
goalie Laura Shane said. "I felt that Connecticut
was trapping us a lot and we weren't cutting back to
help each other. It comes back to the basics of
ground balls, throwing and catching."
In addition to Pantano, Shane also played espe

cially well, stopping 20 of 28 shots.
"I think I was seeing the ball pretty well for the
most part," Shane said. "But numbers don't mean a
lot. You make 20 saves and 22 means you would
have won. There are some areas I need to work on,
like coming out and stopping the first shots, instead
of allowing a few goals and then coming to play."
After a day to work out the kinks, the Cardinal
came out firing on Sunday against the heavily fa
vored Georgetown Hoyas. Stanford won the first
half 5-2 off two goals by Pantano and junior attack
er Megan Burker and another goal from junior at
tacker Sarah Bach.
"On Saturday, we really practiced going back
wards and using the goalie to switch fields," Pan
tano said. "I think I saw a huge improvement in the
first half on Sunday because Georgetown had a
doubling strategy in the midfield similar to Con
necticut's."
The Hoyas showed their mettle in the second
half, however, outscoring the Cardinal 8-1 en route
to a 10-6 win. Freshman Megan McClain scored the
Cardinal's final goal and Shane made 14 stops in the
losing effort.
"We came out so strong and that was really awe
some," Pantano said. "I think what broke down was
the fundamentals. We got sloppy in our passing,
catching and ground balls, the three basics of
lacrosse. It was a little disappointing because we
had it there for awhile."
After a break for finals, the Cardinal host Col
gate on March 18 and Cornell a day later. Until
then, though, the Cardinal have nearly two weeks
to fix their mistakes.
"As much as I love games, I'm really looking
forward to practice these two weeks so we can fix all
the things that went wrong," Pantano said. "I'm re
ally looking forward to playing hard against the
girls in practice."
