### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
Last weekend, sophomore Theresa
Logar (16-1,6-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
proved that high winds, rain delays and
all the other stressors of a time-tested,
coach-approved sore spot for the top
ranked Stanford women's tennis team
(12-0,6-0 Pac-10), were no match for her
unstoppable game.
No. 27 Logar maintained a perfect
10-0 regular season record this weekend,
defeating Arizona's Kasia Jakowlew in
straight sets on Friday and mounting a
huge comeback against Arizona State's
Kady Pooler on Saturday, 4-6,7-5,6-0.
The site of Friday's match against
No. 48 Arizona (5-5,0-3), Lanelle Rob
son Tennis Center, rests at 2389 feet
above sea level, an altitude that required
Cardinal players to restring their rack
ets.
Saturday's conditions at the No. 27
Sun Devils' (3-3,1-2) Whiteman Tennis
Center were not much better, as the Car
dinal exchanged blustery, dust-ridden
courts for intermittent thunderstorms
and continued high winds.
"Wind is the great equalizer in ten
nis," Brennan said. "Whenever there's
wind the [better] player is going to wind
up on the wrong end of that court at
some point."
By the end of the weekend, Stanford
had pulled out two convincing wins. The
Cardinal recovered from a doubles loss
to dismantle Arizona, 6-1, and swept
Arizona State, 6-0.
Logar helped lead the way.
"Theresa has the ability to knock
[her opponents] off the courts in one or
two shots," Brennan said. "Her perse
verance is incredible and every point for
her is do or die."

Logar highlighted her increased con
fidence as a major factor in her success.
"1 didn't allow myself to concede de
feat at any time," Logar said. "Even
though 1 hate to admit it, I found my
serve to be very effective in both match
es."
While Logar lost just three games in a
6-1, 6-2 win over Jakowlew, Brennan
said he was nervous as he watched Logar
drop the first set against Pooler and slip
to 0-3 in the second.
"Because the courts [at Arizona
State] are set up differently from Stan
ford's, I was only able to peek at There
sa's score," Brennan said. "I thought,
'God that's too bad, she's going to have
a tough fight on her hands,' and it would
be bad for her to lose her undefeated
streak. She's never lost a dual [non
championship] match in two years and
that's pretty incredible."
Logar, however, stayed true to form
and rebounded with a 6-0 final set.
"While she needs to reach the point
where she can play six, seven, eight balls
in a point, she's learning that there's
more ways to win than just pure power,"
Brennan said.
In the No. 1 singles slot. No. 28
Amber Liu remained undefeated (10-0,
6-0) by defeating Sabrina Capponolo of
Arizona State, 6-3,6-2. The day before,
she held out against No. 33 Dianne Hol
lands 3-6,6-3,1-0(7).
"In singles [both days] everybody
played really well," Brennan said.
At No. 2 singles, junior Alice Barnes
(14-5,5-0 Pac-10) posted two straight-set
wins. Barnes topped the Sun Devils'
Joselynn Burkett, 6-4,6-4, while conced
ing just three games to Arizona's
Stephanie Balzert, 6-1,6-2.
At Nos. 5 and 6 singles, respectively,
freshman No. 30 Whitney Deason (17-

3) and No. 94 sophomore Anne Yelsey
(12-5) made quick work of their oppo
nents.
After downing Arizona's Camelia
Todorova, 6-2, 6-2, Deason completed
her individual weekend sweep in a
three-set battle against Arizona State's
Wendy Pilecka,s-7,6-3,6-2.
Yelsey, who sat out from the 2004 sin
gles lineup, proved that she is a tough con
tender in 2005, denying Arizona's Jessie
Rochefort all but one game in a 6-1,6-0
win. Yelsey downed the Sun Devils' Re
becca Ranldn, 6-2,4-6,6-1.
The No. 1 doubles team of Barnes
and Burdette, a senior, fell to Arizona
State's Maja Mlakar and Hollands, 8-4.
The No. 3 duo of Deason and freshman
Lejla Hodzic, fell 8-5 to Kelly Perry and
Rochefort.
"We're weaker in doubles than we
were last year," Brennan said. "Last
year, we had Lauren [Barnikow] and
Erin playing together for their third
year, while Alice and Erin have played
about 20 short matches together. As for
Whitney and Lejla, they're not only
learning the doubles game, but are
learning as freshman collegiate tennis
players."
Due to inclement weather, Stanford
and Arizona State did not play doubles
Saturday.
Brennan takes stock of the succes
sive singles sweeps that Stanford made
this weekend in summing up the South
western showdown.
"While the L.A. schools we played
last weekend might be tougher, we just
feel more confident playing them than
we when we go to Arizona," he said.
"It's the kind of thing you can't quite put
your finger on. But the fact that we're so
good with the singles this year keeps us
refusing to lose."

6-1, 6-2 win over Jakowlew, Brennan
said he was nervous as he watched Logar
drop the first set against Pooler and slip
to 0-3 in the second.
"Because the courts [at Arizona
State] are set up differently from Stan
ford's, I was only able to peek at There
sa's score," Brennan said. "I thought,
'God that's too bad, she's going to have
a tough fight on her hands,' and it would
be bad for her to lose her undefeated
streak. She's never lost a dual [non
championship] match in two years and
that's pretty incredible."
Logar, however, stayed true to form
and rebounded with a 6-0 final set.
"While she needs to reach the point
where she can play six, seven, eight balls
in a point, she's learning that there's
more ways to win than just pure power,"
Brennan said.
In the No. 1 singles slot. No. 28
Amber Liu remained undefeated (10-0,
6-0) by defeating Sabrina Capponolo of
Arizona State, 6-3,6-2. The day before,
she held out against No. 33 Dianne Hol
lands 3-6,6-3,1-0(7).
"In singles [both days] everybody
played really well," Brennan said.
At No. 2 singles, junior Alice Barnes
(14-5,5-0 Pac-10) posted two straight-set
wins. Barnes topped the Sun Devils'
Joselynn Burkett, 6-4,6-4, while conced
ing just three games to Arizona's
Stephanie Balzert, 6-1,6-2.
At Nos. 5 and 6 singles, respectively,
freshman No. 30 Whitney Deason (17-

3) and No. 94 sophomore Anne Yelsey
(12-5) made quick work of their oppo
nents.
After downing Arizona's Camelia
Todorova, 6-2, 6-2, Deason completed
her individual weekend sweep in a
three-set battle against Arizona State's
Wendy Pilecka,s-7,6-3,6-2.
Yelsey, who sat out from the 2004 sin
gles lineup, proved that she is a tough con
tender in 2005, denying Arizona's Jessie
Rochefort all but one game in a 6-1,6-0
win. Yelsey downed the Sun Devils' Re
becca Ranldn, 6-2,4-6,6-1.
The No. 1 doubles team of Barnes
and Burdette, a senior, fell to Arizona
State's Maja Mlakar and Hollands, 8-4.
The No. 3 duo of Deason and freshman
Lejla Hodzic, fell 8-5 to Kelly Perry and
Rochefort.
"We're weaker in doubles than we
were last year," Brennan said. "Last
year, we had Lauren [Barnikow] and
Erin playing together for their third
year, while Alice and Erin have played
about 20 short matches together. As for
Whitney and Lejla, they're not only
learning the doubles game, but are
learning as freshman collegiate tennis
players."
Due to inclement weather, Stanford
and Arizona State did not play doubles
Saturday.
Brennan takes stock of the succes
sive singles sweeps that Stanford made
this weekend in summing up the South
western showdown.
"While the L.A. schools we played
last weekend might be tougher, we just
feel more confident playing them than
we when we go to Arizona," he said.
"It's the kind of thing you can't quite put
your finger on. But the fact that we're so
good with the singles this year keeps us
refusing to lose."
Last weekend, sophomore Theresa
Logar (16-1,6-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
proved that high winds, rain delays and
all the other stressors of a time-tested,
coach-approved sore spot for the top
ranked Stanford women's tennis team
(12-0,6-0 Pac-10), were no match for her
unstoppable game.
No. 27 Logar maintained a perfect
10-0 regular season record this weekend,
defeating Arizona's Kasia Jakowlew in
straight sets on Friday and mounting a
huge comeback against Arizona State's
Kady Pooler on Saturday, 4-6,7-5,6-0.
The site of Friday's match against
No. 48 Arizona (5-5,0-3), Lanelle Rob
son Tennis Center, rests at 2389 feet
above sea level, an altitude that required
Cardinal players to restring their rack
ets.
Saturday's conditions at the No. 27
Sun Devils' (3-3,1-2) Whiteman Tennis
Center were not much better, as the Car
dinal exchanged blustery, dust-ridden
courts for intermittent thunderstorms
and continued high winds.
"Wind is the great equalizer in ten
nis," Brennan said. "Whenever there's
wind the [better] player is going to wind
up on the wrong end of that court at
some point."
By the end of the weekend, Stanford
had pulled out two convincing wins. The
Cardinal recovered from a doubles loss
to dismantle Arizona, 6-1, and swept
Arizona State, 6-0.
Logar helped lead the way.
"Theresa has the ability to knock
[her opponents] off the courts in one or
two shots," Brennan said. "Her perse
verance is incredible and every point for
her is do or die."

Logar highlighted her increased con
fidence as a major factor in her success.
"1 didn't allow myself to concede de
feat at any time," Logar said. "Even
though 1 hate to admit it, I found my
serve to be very effective in both match
es."
While Logar lost just three games in a
6-1, 6-2 win over Jakowlew, Brennan
said he was nervous as he watched Logar
drop the first set against Pooler and slip
to 0-3 in the second.
"Because the courts [at Arizona
State] are set up differently from Stan
