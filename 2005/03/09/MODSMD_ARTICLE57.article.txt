# Cardinal win two of three
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Bottom of the ninth, one out, nobody on.
Score knotted at two. It's the type of close game
scenario that No. 11 Stanford has faced a few
times already this season, with mixed results.
When sophomore outfielder Jim Rapoport
stepped into the halter's box with runners on the
corners, he still had the comfort of there just
being one out. Though the big play has eluded
the Cardinal in the late innings so far, head
coach Mark Marquess took a risk and called for
the game-ender.
California southpaw Travis Talbott was sent
out to face the lefthanded Rapoport, and when
Talbott turned his hack on pinch-hitting senior
Cameron Matthews on third, Matthews
streaked toward the plate as his teammate laid
down the suicide squeeze.
Matthews scored easily and the Cardinal
sealed up the series win, two games to one, with
a 3-2 victory. Stanford beat the Golden Bears
Saturday, 10-3 but were battered in the second
game of Sunday's doubleheader, 10-4.
"We were real fortunate there," Marquess
said of the squeeze play. "Michael Taylor did a
good job getting that first hit and that was just
good execution by Rapoport," adding with a
smile that in the first game of a doubleheader
you certainly don't want extra innings.
Saturday's series opener yielded a lengthy list
of things that the Cardinal did right. Junior left
hander Mark Romanczuk threw his second com
plete game in as many starts, holding the Bears
to three runs on just five hits, despite two Stan
ford errors. Romanczuk was named Pac-10
Pitcher of the Week for his efforts.
The offense backed Romanczuk's brilliance
with one base knock after another, torching Cal
ace Adam Gold for 13 hits. Six Cardinal players
had multiple-hit games and junior leftfielder
Chris Lewis nabbed his fourth home run of the
season.
Sophomore third baseman Adam Sorgi said
that the top-to-bottom hitting effort showed the
slow hut steady offensive improvement of the
team.
"When we lost two of three at Fullerton and

got swept at Texas, we didn't really win any of
those big spots," Sorgi said. "It's definitely
something we're improving on, and as the sea
son goes on we'll get more of those big spots, get
better at-bats."
While the pitching efforts of Romanczuk, ju
nior Jeff Gilmore and sophomore Blake Holler
gave Stanford every opportunity to win on Sat
urday and in Sunday's early game, Sunday
night's pitching was simply abysmal. Starting
freshman Nolan Gallagher gave up five runs on
seven hits - including two home runs - in only 2
1/3 innings. The four relievers that followed did
not fare much better; only junior closer Matt
Manship escaped without allowing a run.
The pitching performance brought back
memories of the 2004 Stanford squad, which
also lacked a reliable third starter and paid for it
in the postseason.
"We're struggling for that third starter; we're
inconsistent," Marquess said, noting that he'd
like to keep Holler in a relieving role. "I'd hate
to think that we can't find another third person
to start, so we can keep using Blake out of the
bullpen. He's really come of age out of the
bullpen, and responded so well."
Sunday night's offense just didn't pack the
power of the Golden Bears' lineup, and even the

usually flawless veteran infield committed two
errors, including junior Jed Lowrie's first of the
year.
"They pitched really well; you have to give a
lot of credit to their pitchers," Sorgi said. "We
lagged a little bit. We didn't play with as much
intensity as they did."
The game got even more ugly when Stanford
designated hitter Brendan Domaracki took a
fastball to the back of the head. As Stanford
pitchers and Cal batters appeared hostile to each
other earlier in the game, some construed the
plunking — which sent Domaracki to the ground
for several minutes before he left the diamond
with the help of the trainers — as intentional.
Before Sunday's 10-4 loss, the Cardinal had
bested the Golden Bears in 18 consecutive meet
ings, dating to 2002.
"A lot of times fate catches up to you when
you've beat a team 20 times in a row," Sorgi said.
"Sometime, they're going to play a good game."
Stanford will have a week off for finals before
returning to the field fora home-and-home
against Pacific March 19 and 20. The Cardinal
will have a midweek contest against San Jose
State March 22, followed by the annual two
game series against Sacramento State March 25
and 26.

those big spots," Sorgi said. "It's definitely
something we're improving on, and as the sea
son goes on we'll get more of those big spots, get
better at-bats."
While the pitching efforts of Romanczuk, ju
nior Jeff Gilmore and sophomore Blake Holler
gave Stanford every opportunity to win on Sat
urday and in Sunday's early game, Sunday
night's pitching was simply abysmal. Starting
freshman Nolan Gallagher gave up five runs on
seven hits - including two home runs - in only 2
1/3 innings. The four relievers that followed did
not fare much better; only junior closer Matt
Manship escaped without allowing a run.
The pitching performance brought back
memories of the 2004 Stanford squad, which
also lacked a reliable third starter and paid for it
in the postseason.
"We're struggling for that third starter; we're
inconsistent," Marquess said, noting that he'd
like to keep Holler in a relieving role. "I'd hate
to think that we can't find another third person
to start, so we can keep using Blake out of the
bullpen. He's really come of age out of the
bullpen, and responded so well."
Sunday night's offense just didn't pack the
power of the Golden Bears' lineup, and even the

usually flawless veteran infield committed two
errors, including junior Jed Lowrie's first of the
year.
"They pitched really well; you have to give a
lot of credit to their pitchers," Sorgi said. "We
lagged a little bit. We didn't play with as much
intensity as they did."
The game got even more ugly when Stanford
designated hitter Brendan Domaracki took a
fastball to the back of the head. As Stanford
pitchers and Cal batters appeared hostile to each
other earlier in the game, some construed the
plunking — which sent Domaracki to the ground
for several minutes before he left the diamond
with the help of the trainers — as intentional.
Before Sunday's 10-4 loss, the Cardinal had
bested the Golden Bears in 18 consecutive meet
ings, dating to 2002.
"A lot of times fate catches up to you when
you've beat a team 20 times in a row," Sorgi said.
"Sometime, they're going to play a good game."
Stanford will have a week off for finals before
returning to the field fora home-and-home
against Pacific March 19 and 20. The Cardinal
will have a midweek contest against San Jose
State March 22, followed by the annual two
game series against Sacramento State March 25
and 26.

The basepaths were familiar territory for Cardinal hitters last weekend, as Stanford pounded out 13 runs
in its two wins over Cal. The Cardinal's loss Sunday snapped an 18-game win streak against the Bears.
