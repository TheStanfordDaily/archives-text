# Equestrian riding high
## 
### ALEXIS PETERSON 
A tent and a very wet, temporary
arena. Typically, neither are consid
ered to be ideal practice spaces. But
ideal or not, this is what the Stanford
equestrian team has been faced with
at every practice for the past five
months while the Red Barn under
goes renovations.
But it is obvious that the team has
refused to let any of this prevent it
from enjoying a successful season; it
is currently preparing for Regionals,
on March 13. Forty riders and 15
horses strong, the equestrian team is
the largest it has been in its entire 22-
year history. Furthermore, Presi
dent Alex Herbert, a junior, has
placed into the Open Division, and
the team can boast riders in each of
the five levels of competition, which
range from Beginning to Open.
Fueled by an end-of-February
win in San Luis Obispo, Calif.—
the team's first win in over five years
— Stanford has good reason to be
optimistic about it chances at Re
gionals, and if all goes well, at Zones
and ultimately, at Nationals.
The underdog Cardinal beat
each of the other 10 schools in the re
gion to take High Point Team in En
glish riding. Senior Sarah Willeman
took High Point Rider, receiving the
highest placing in the entire show.
Willeman, who joined the team mid
year. has been ranked as one of the
top riders in the country and has
taken a High Point Rider award in
every show in which she has com
peted.
Meanwhile, at the same show,
Stanford's Western riding team
went on to take Reserve High Point
Team, the equivalent of second
place, for the third time in three
weeks.
Such a triumph bodes well for the
team's performance as it finishes out
the season. One aspect of showing to
be kept in mind, however, is that in

competition riders are randomly as
signed their mounts. Luck - or lack
thereof - has everything to do with
what horse a rider competes with,
meaning that riders are judged not
only on their form, but also on their
ability to handle a different horse
when the heat is on.
At the San Luis Obispo show,
one Stanford rider had a horse that
spooked and threw her before the
class even began. Another horse re
fused to pick up a lead in one direc
tion.
"You hope that the judge takes
the horse's faults into account, but
often they don't," coach Vanessa
Bartsch said.
The three riders heading to Re
gional this weekend to represent
the Cardinal are Herbert and sopho
mores Katherine Brainard and Kate
Farrell.
"All three are tremendously
strong riders who have really put in
the extra effort this year," Bartsch
said. '"There is always the wild-card
of drawing an unfamiliar horse, but
all three are fierce competitors."
This fierceness will come in
handy at Regionals, where competi
tion will be stiff. Fresno State, for ex
ample, has just gone varsity, and
now has University funding and 100
riders. Stanford has also set its sights
on UC-Davis, home to another
strong program.
The Cardinal continue to keep
things in perspective, however.
"1 think our main goals are to
have everyone become a better
rider, which also helps with winning
our shows, which we have been
doing lately," rider Margaux Ben
nett said. "Another goal is to have
fun."
The team is also looking to make
a name for itself and establish itself
more prominently in the sport.
"1 think a lot of [the team goal]
has been building the foundation of
the team and our presence in the
equestrian circles of the area and of
California," rider Caroline Feinberg
said.
Bartsch said she is also particularly
proud of how her team members sup
port each other. This is a sport in which
team support is especially important
because some of the members have
just started riding this year - because
there are five different divisions, a

rider who has just started riding is as
important to the team as the most
skilled riders.
"The fact is that you do not have to
have ridden a horse before to be on the
team, but you need to be committed to
learn," Bennett said.
Commitment seems to be in no
short supply on the equestrian team,
especially as the long-awaited dream
of riding in one of the nicest equine fa
cilities in the country comes closer to
realization.
"I feel like that is driving them to
work harder and stay focused,"
Bartsch said. "As Stanford elevates
the barn to World Class, the team is
committed to elevating their riding."
