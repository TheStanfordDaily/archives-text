# Medical Center plans to expand
## 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Medical Center announced plans late Febru
ary to move some ambulatory care clinics to a new outpa
tient facility in Redwood City, marking its first ever off
campus expansion.
The Medical Center has selected a vacant 360,000-
square-foot office building located at the Mid-Point Tech
nology Park near Highway 101 as the destination for the
facility. The building was originally constructed and occu
pied by the Internet service Excite@Home until the com
pany filed bankruptcy in 2(X)1. It will be renovated by late
2(X)7 to provide space for orthopedics, sleep, ophthalmol
ogy. surgical and imaging services.
Martha Marsh, president and chief executive officer of
Stanford Hospital and Clinics, announced the expansion
plan on Feb. 25.
"This new site will give patients additional access to the
unique and excellent care that we provide," Marsh said in
a press release. "The population of our area continues to
grow and as time passes our communities will have more
residents, particularly seniors who
are in need of locally accessible med
ical services. This center will help to
meet that growing need."
Located near the biggest traffic
artery on the Peninsula, the new cen
ter will provide convenient diagnos
tic and treatment services for its pa
tients in one building with updated
equipment and increased staff.
Stanford Medical School Dean
Philip Pizzo explained that the new fa
cility will respond to the general grow
ing trend in medicine toward outpa
tient care and surgical operations with
out overnight hospitalization.
"Our new facility will provide the
most up-to-date outpatient care and
will help bring forth new innovations
and discoveries to improve the care
of patients," Pizzo said in a press re
lease. "We are very excited to pro
vide this additional state-of-the-art
medical care on the Peninsula."
Besides Stanford, at least four
other local hospitals, including Se
quoia Hospital in Redwood City and
the Palo Alto Medical Foundation, are
planning new or replacement facilities
within the next decade. After re
bounding from huge financial losses in

the late 1990'5, hospitals across the na
tion are now beginning to see surging
profits, increased demand for medical
care, and thus, the ideal opportunity to
expand. The cost of the Stanford facil
ity has not been estimated, but will be
funded by the University.
The decision to move to Redwood
City was also influenced by increasing
constraints on both space and person
nel on the Stanford campus.
According to Eugene Carragee,
the director of the spinal surgery sec
tion of the Orthopedics Department,
expansion seemed to be an obvious
and necessary step.
We're very much at our capacity,"
Carragee said in a Feb. 27 article that
appeared in the San Jose Mercury
News. "Our clinic is full and our op
erating-room schedule is completely
booked."
Despite the looming need for ex
pansion, the Medical Center has
been unable to construct new build
ings on the Palo Alto medical cam
pus, simply because of a lack of
space.
The increased space, facilities and
doctors promised by the new center
are welcomed by Carragee and his
colleagues.
"1 believe this new state-of-the
art center will be very positive for
Redwood City," Marsh said. "It will
provide more health care options for
the local community."
