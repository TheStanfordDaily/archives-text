# A 						new Ray of hope

### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Talking with Stanford first-year
men's golf coach Conrad Ray, it is
hard not to think that he is the em
bodiment of a fresh start.
When athletic director Ted Le
land filled the vacancy left by four
year coach Jeff Mitchell, he found a
guy whose Stanford roots, youthful
enthusiasm and love for the school's
golf program are undeniable.
Fora program trying to recapture
its former glory, a member of the 1994
NCAA Championship team (along
with PGA professionals Notah
Begay and Casey Martin) and the
captain of the 1997 squad was a natu
ral choice.
For Ray. an AU-Pac-lOand Pac-10
All-Academic selection, the chance to
return to the Farm — even if it meant
moving with his wife Jennifer from
their comfort zone in Hilton Head,
S.C.. was too g<xxl to ignore.
"1 thought 1 was dreaming," Ray
said. "1 felt very fortunate, very hum
bled to have the chance. I treat Stan
ford University and Stanford athlet
ics with really high esteem, so to have
the chance to even be considered for
the position, 1 was really honored.
Stanford is the one coaching job I
would have changed [locations] for."
Despite his lack of formal coach
ing experience — he has spent most
of his time since his graduation in
1997 playing professionally on the
Nationwide Tour and others — Ray
brought with him a host of intangi
bles, including time spent playing
under Stanford legend and 1994 Na
tional Coach of the Year Wally
Goodwin.
"I've tried to set up a very formal
structure for everything we do, but
within that structure give the guys
freedom to explore and take their
games to the next level, based on their
own individual experiences." Ray
said. "There's a reason why [Stan
ford's recruits] are here: because
they're successful, and they're talent
ed and they've done it in the past, so
why would you want to infringe on
that? [Goodwin] was the master at
that. He brought in great recruits, set

up a structure and turned them loose,
essentially."
Yet it would be folly to mistake
Ray's flexibility about a player's
putting style fora lack of accountabil
ity within the program. The begin
ning of the Ray regime has been
marked by an increased emphasis on
discipline and responsibility.
"Practices, workouts and meet
ings are more focused and produc
tive," junior Scott Mac Donald said."
He has fostered a more intense, com
petitive environment on a day-today
basis."
Before Stanford finds its name on
another NCAA trophy, or regular
season tournament trophy for that
matter, Ray believes the Cardinal
must adopt a professional attitude
about what they do on and off the
course.
"He will compliment us when we
do well," freshman Rob Grube said,
"On the other hand, there is always
the expectation to, as he puts it, 'Act,
dress and play like champions."
The early returns have certainly
been positive, as Stanford put togeth
er a solid fall season that included a
pair of top-five finishes, equaling the
number of top-fives the Cardinal
posted all of last year.
Stanford's second-place perfor
mance at the season-opening Gold
Rush Tournament was the team's
best since consecutive runner-up fin
ishes in the fall of 2001. Seniors Kevin
Blue and Pat Phillips are the only two
players from this year's squad who
were around to witness those.
Nonetheless. Ray sees bigger and
better things on the horizon for this
year's group, which has bought into
his philt>sophy and shown a willing
ness to work.
"These guys have been dedicated,
putting in some early mornings in the
weight room," Ray said. "1 would say
confidently that we're one of the top
five or 10 teams in the region, for sure.
We host the [NCAA Western Re
gional at Stanford] in May, so one of
our big goals this year is to qualify for
the regional tournament. Once you
get there, anything can happen."
As captain of Stanford's ship
heading toward the postseason, Ray

can rest assured that his crew is in
tune with his every expectation.
"Coach Ray has been able to step
in and light a fire under us," sopho
more Zack Miller said. "He's a very
motivational guy who demands re
spect from his players."
Coaching a sport whose season ex
tends the length of the school year
and in which virtually nothing is de
cided by a single regular-season tour
nament. Ray has been dedicated to
keeping his team on an even keel
throughout the marathon that is the
college golf year.
"Our team has learned that we
need to stay steady in our improve
ment from one tournament to the
next," Blue said. "Coach Ray doesn't
get all worked up about short term re
sults, either success or failure, but
wants to see steady long term growth
for the program."
To that end, Ray says that recruit

ing young players to the Farm and en
suring Stanford's future success has
been one of his favorite parts of the job.
"I'm sold on Stanford, and I think
it sells itself." Ray said. "So, for me to
recruit and talk to people about the
place and what it has to offer is pretty
easy. Once you get past the [academ
ic] hurdle, it shouldn't be that tough to
get kids to come here."
Ray notched his first recruiting
victory earlier this winter, signing
high school standout Daniel Lim to a
letter of intent in the early signing pe
riod. A Cupertino. Calif., native, Lim
has claimed a pair of American Ju
nior Golf Association tournament ti
tles in his young career and will join
the Cardinal next fall.
In the meantime, the focus of this
year's team is singular, as it writes the
first lines of a new chapter in Stanford
golf history. If Ray is right, the ending
could be anything they choose.
