# Water polo suffers first MPSF loss
## Card beat Irvine, lose to Long Beach 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
Coming off a third-place per
formance in last week's 2005 Dak
tronics Gaucho Invitational, the
No. 3 Stanford women's water
polo team (10-3,3-1 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) started
the weekend looking to maintain
its momentum. But even that mo
mentum, combined with seven
strong quarters of play in their two
games, was not enough to keep
the Cardinal from suffering their
first conference loss of the year
Sunday at the hands of the Long
Beach State 49ers.
The Cardinal started the week
end off right, jumping to a 4-0 lead
against No. 13 UC-lrvine in the
first quarter. The Cardinal were a
model of efficiency in the first
stanza, converting all three of
their six-on-five advantages. Se
nior captain Kelty Luber netted
two of Stanford's four second-pe
riod goals and the Cardinal took
an 8-1 lead into the second half.
Junior driver Scotti Shafer and
sophomore two-meter Christina
Hewko both recorded second-half
goals and finished with two goals
apiece as the Cardinal cruised to
an 11-2 victory.
Sunday, the Cardinal headed
to Long Beach to take on the No.
4 49ers; the two teams met the pre
vious week at the Gaucho Invita
tional. Early on, the rematch
looked to be headed in the same
direction for the Cardinal. Junior
Laurel Champion got Stanford on
the board at the 4:16 mark of the
first period and Hewko tallied an
other on a six-on-five opportunity
to put the Cardinal ahead 2-0.
After Shafer netted her only
goal of the day with 4:58 to play in
the second period, the 49ers bat
tled back to tie the game two min
utes later. But Champion notched
her second goal of the game to
give the Cardinal the advantage
and the momentum at the half.

The Cardinal and the 49ers
played an even third period, with
each team scoring once, and the
game entered the final period of
play with the Cardinal ahead by
one. Senior captain Hannah
Luber buried her first shot of the
day to put the Cardinal ahead by
two with just under five minutes to
play.
But Long Beach State cranked
up its pressure on the Stanford de
fense and managed to score on
consecutive drives to tie the game
at 6-6 with three minutes remain
ing. The 49ers managed to extend
their possession scoring streak to
three when junior utility Alison
Braden found the back of the net
with 1:32 left in the game to give
Long Beach State its first lead of
the game.
The Cardinal had several scor
ing opportunities in the final sec
onds of the game but were unable
to answer Braden's goal before
the final horn sounded.
"Our loss was definitely disap
pointing," Kelty Luber said. "It
showed us that we have to play
every single possession with all
we've got, as if it were the last. It
came down to Long Beach [State]
making some great plays at the
end and us not responding with
our own."
While the loss dropped the
Cardinal to a 3-1 record in confer
ence play, it did have a silver lin
ing.
"The upside is that because of
the loss we've all come together
stronger and with more spirit,"
Kelty Luber said.
The Cardinal have the next two
weekends off from competitive
play. During that time, they will
have the chance to recover and
prepare for the second half of
their season. Stanford's spring
schedule opens with two tough
matchups - No. 8 UC-Santa Bar
bara on March 24 and defending
NCAA Champions No. 2 USC
four days later.
