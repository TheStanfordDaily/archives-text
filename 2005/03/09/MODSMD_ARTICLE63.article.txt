# Gymnasts fall to Alabama
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Go Elmo!" cheered the No. 24 women's
gymnastics team (3-7, 3-3 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) as its first gymnast mounted the balance
beam at Sunday's meet against No. 3 Alabama.
A fuzzy loose-limbed red puppet donning a Car
dinal leotard and tumbling across the beam
would have been quite a sight at Maples Pavil
ion. Instead, freshman Lauren "Elmo" Elmore
took to the beam.
Elmore scored a 9.80 to finish third, just 0.025
tenths behind freshman Tabitha Yim and Al
abama's Mari Bayer, who finished second and
first, respectively.
Elmore went on to set a season-high for her
self in the All-Around, scoring a 39.05 to earn
third place ahead of Alabama's Ashley Miles,
last year's national champion on vault and
floor.
Her efforts were not enough, however, to
pull the team to victory. The Cardinal fell to the
Crimson Tide 197.1 to 194.975.
Stanford was coming off one win and two
losses in a meet just two days earlier. On Friday
night, the team competed in front of an 11,088-
person crowd in Salt Lake City against No. 1
Utah, No. 6 Florida and No. 54 California..
The team set a season-high score of 196.025,
as the Cardinal finished ahead of Cal's 191.5 but
fell short of the Gators' 196.45 and the Utes'
197.425.
Freshman Liz Tricase led the Cardinal by
placing fourth in the All-Around with a team
season-high of 39.375 and junior captain Natalie
Foley followed in sixth place with a 39.25. The
Utes dominated the meet, boasting the top two
finishers in the All-Around and on each event.
Despite Tricase's season-best performance
against the Utes, she was on crutches two days
later. All-American junior Glyn Sweets also sat
out Sunday's meet with an injured foot that kept
her out of Friday's competition and will sideline

her for the next few weeks.
Lacking Sweets and Tricase, a national
champion on vault, Stanford only had five
vaulters (teams usually have six vaulters and
then drop the low score). Out of those five, only
three had vaults with a 10.0 start value. The team
recorded a 48.575 on the event, which put them
nearly a full point behind Alabama.
Junior captain Jessica Louie, who had been
out with an ankle injury since the first day of
practice, had to make her season debut on vault
so that Stanford could field a full team. Louie
scored a 9.55, but contributed a strong bar rou
tine to score a 9.825, tying for fifth with Elmore.
Stanford's highest-scoring events of the
weekend were bars and floor. Ranked 14th in
the nation on bars, Stanford posted a 49.125 at
Utah to edge out Florida for second place on the
event. Yim led the team on bars with a 9.9 to tie
for second place and Elmore and Tricase each
recorded 9.825s for fifth place. The team fell to
Alabama on bars, but still earned a respectable
49.075 to make the event Stanford's highest
scoring of the evening.
Stanford's floor score fell just behind its bar
score with a 49.05. The season high of 49.25 was
set against Utah under the lead of Tricase and
Foley who both scored 9.90s to tie for third.
Stanford has one meet left in its regular-sea
son competition on March 19 at San Jose State.
The team will then have a week off before com
peting at Pac-10 Championships hosted by
Berkeley on March 26.
After Pac-lOs, Stanford will likely compete at
NCAA Regionals and then move on to Nation
als in April. Teams advance to Regionals on the
basis of a regional qualifying score (RQS). The
RQS is an average of the team's top three home
scores and top three away scores after dropping
the highest score.
Stanford's RQS is currently 194.29, putting it
at No. 24 in the nation and a comfortable No. 3
in the West region behind UCLA and Oregon
State.

Stanford's floor score fell just behind its bar
score with a 49.05. The season high of 49.25 was
set against Utah under the lead of Tricase and
Foley who both scored 9.90s to tie for third.
Stanford has one meet left in its regular-sea
son competition on March 19 at San Jose State.
The team will then have a week off before com
peting at Pac-10 Championships hosted by
Berkeley on March 26.
After Pac-lOs, Stanford will likely compete at
NCAA Regionals and then move on to Nation
als in April. Teams advance to Regionals on the
basis of a regional qualifying score (RQS). The
RQS is an average of the team's top three home
scores and top three away scores after dropping
the highest score.
Stanford's RQS is currently 194.29, putting it
at No. 24 in the nation and a comfortable No. 3
in the West region behind UCLA and Oregon
State.
