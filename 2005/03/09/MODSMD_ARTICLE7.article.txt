# 'Die-in' aims to raise Darfur awareness
## 
### MARIE-JO MONT-REYNAUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Commonly known as the "inter
section of death," the corner of the
quad by the clock tower really
earned its name Monday as students
participated in a "die-in" protesting
the crisis in Darfur. Known for the
frequency of bike accidents, the
busiest intersection of the Universi
ty was covered by more than 50 stu
dents sprawled on the ground be
tween 10:50 and 11 a.m. as their
peers traveled to and from class.
Sophomore Elissa Test, one of
the co-founders of Stanford's chap
ter of Students Taking Action Now:
Darfur, or STAND, said that all the
protesters wore black at the event
and throughout the rest of the day to
raise awareness about the crisis in
Sudan. Participants wore on one side

a photo of a victim of the violence in
Darfur and on the other a page with
text explaining an aspect-of the con
flict.
The event caused a backup in
pedestrian and bicycle traffic for
about 20 minutes as some stopped
to read the signs posted on the backs
of the "bodies."
A large sign, held by STAND
members, reading "400,000 dead in
Darfur. What will you do?" stopped
many students in their tracks.

bikes and walk precariously over
the bodies on the ground.
"It was actually really scary to be
lying on the ground because I was on
the perimeter and there were mad
bikes going around everywhere,"
Test said. "I mean mad. There were
lots of them, and some of them were
angry."
Many of the protesters spoke
passionately about the need to take
extreme action to end the violence
in Darfur.
"I lay my body down because

400,000 of my brothers and sisters
have died in Sudan and their suffer
ing continues without public outcry,
unheeded by many of our politicians
and fellow citizens," said junior Lily
Grainger. "I lay my body down to
raise awareness about their suffer
ing and to ensure it is no longer ig
nored. 1 must believe that if people
truly knew what was happening in
Darfur they would do something to
help stop the violence."
While most onlookers said they
understood the demonstration?s
goal, several questioned the effec
tiveness of the campaign and how
lying on the ground could actually
make a difference.
"It is an important and pressing
issue that definitely needs atten

tion," said junior Bob Sensenbren
ner. "That said, 1 don't think that
blocking intersections during Dead
Week is the best way to get your
message across."
Sophomore Pablo Aguilera
agreed with Sensenbrenner.
"I honestly just thought it was
kind of interfering," he said. "It was
a disruption in a really messy inter
section, where there are already a
lot of accidents. 1 think people might
have been mad about it but I just
didn't pay too much attention to it
because I was late for class."
Frustrating students was actually
an objective of the event, said sopho
more Chrissie a, co-founder of
STAND.
"At the same time as students

were hanging up cell phones and
getting off their bikes, crimes
against humanity were being com
mitted in Darfur," she said. "Was
the ?die-in? met with typical objec
tions? Yes. But more importantly,
did il make people say the word
Darfur that wouldn't otherwise?
Absolutely."
The "die-in" succeeded in mak
ing some students stop and think
about the alleged genocide taking
place in Darfur, according to
Coxon.
"My automatic thought was that
it was slowing me down on my way
to class," freshman Eve Rips said.
"And my second thought was that it
was pretty superficial of me to have
had that first thought."
