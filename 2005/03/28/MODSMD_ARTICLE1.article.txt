# Stanford to lease land for hotel
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A 21 -acre triangular slice of land on the south
east corner of Interstate 280 and Sand Hill Road
is "just sitting there with nothing on it," said
Stanford Management Company spokesman
Bill Phillips. "It doesn't do anything to support
the University's mission — in fact, it's costing us
money in taxes."
That may soon change. The University last
week announced plans to build a 120-room luxu
ry hotel on the site. The proposal also calls for
new office buildings.
The hotel would be operated by Rosewood
Hotels and Resorts, a "privately-held ultra-luxu
ry hotel management company," according to its
Web site. Rosewood's properties, which include
The Carlyle in New York and The Mansion on
Turtle Creek in Dallas, tend to have nightly
room rates ranging upward from about $350.
Phillips said he expects the hotel to cater to
business visitors to Sand Hill Road's "venture

capital row" and the Stanford Research Park
area, as well as some visitors to the University
and Stanford Hospital and Clinics.
Before they can go forward, the plans will be
subject to an Environmental Impact Report and
a traffic study. The Menlo Park City Council
must then approve the project.
Phillips said the University is hoping to open
the hotel by summer 2008 if all goes well.
This is the second time Stanford has tried to
build a hotel on the site. In the 1980s, Stanford
contracted to lease the land to Westin Hotels for
a 350-room hotel, Phillips said. Those plans fell
through when the economy declined toward the
end of the decade.
The current proposal does not involve a lease;
rather, Stanford will own the land and the building,
while Rosewood acts as the hotel management
agent, sharing the revenues. Phillips said Stanford
approached several hotel chains, including the
Ritz-Carlton and the Four Seasons, and eventually
decided on Rosewood, which he said has the high
est revenue per available room of any major chain.

Meanwhile, a new Four Seasons is scheduled
to open in October along Highway 101 in East
Palo Alto — so that the Peninsula, which used to
lack top-end hotels, may soon have two.
In the past, Stanford has often faced stiff op
position from environmental groups when it tries
to build on undeveloped land. It is unclear
whether this project will encounter significant re
sistance. Bounded by Interstate 280, Sand Hill
Road and adjacent Stanford-owned office build
ings, the site is not environmentally sensitive,
Phillips contended.
David Johnson, Menlo Park's business devel
opment manager, said there would be "plenty of
opportunity for public comment on all sides of
the issue" after the Environmental Impact Re
port comes out.
Johnson said the project could be a financial
boon to Menlo Park.
"This is a very exciting revenue opportunity
for the city," he said. Menlo Park would reap a 10
percent Transient Occupancy Tax on every
room rental, in addition to property taxes.
