On March 2ti, 1977, The Daily re
ported a rape case that lacked a sus
pect. Below is an excerpt:
"Police say all leads have been ex
hausted and there are no suspects in
this year's first reported campus
rape which occurred in broad day
light during finals week.
"A 26-year-old student said she
was threatened with a knife and raped
at approximately 2:30 p.m. March 18
in a wooded area between Palm Drive
and the Mausoleum, according to
Marvin Herrington, director of the
Department of Public Safety.
"Herrington said the woman re
ported she was walking along the
path bordering Palm Drive, between
Arboretum Road and Campus
Drive, when the rapist, who had
been following her, brandished a
knife, forced her into the bushes and
raped her.
"Herrington said the case was
'frustrating' because the attack oc

curred on a Friday afternoon in a
busy section of campus only a few
minutes after patrol cars had been in
the area.
"The victim described the rapist
as a white male, about 5-feet, 10-
inches in his mid-20s, with brown
frizzy hair, a pot belly and an un
shaven moon-like face.
"The rapist was wearing blue
jeans and a sweat shirt with the
words "Brown University' in blue
letters and the school's emblem
printed on it, according to Detective
Sgt. Ray Pantiga of the Santa Clara
Sheriff's Department.
"The victim said the attacker was
wearing 'earth shoes,' Pantiga said.
"Herrington said the victim re
ported she had been walking along
the bike path and had stopped at the
spotlight at the intersection of Palm
Drive and Arboretum Road when
the rapist first appeared.
