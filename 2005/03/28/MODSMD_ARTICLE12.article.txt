# Multiple sclerosis drug proves fatal, recently recalled
## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
Elan Corp. and Biogen Idee, two drug devel
opment and manufacturing companies, have, as of
Feb. 28, voluntarily suspended all sales and clinical
trials of Tysabri, a new drug used to treat multiple
sclerosis. Lawrence Steinman, professor of neu
rology and head of the Immunology Department
at Stanford, participated in its testing.
"This decision is based on very recent reports
of two serious adverse events that have occurred in
patients treated with Tysabri in combination with
Avonex in clinical trials," stated a Biogen press re
lease. Avonex is another drug developed by Elan
and Biogen, also used to treat symptoms of multi
ple sclerosis.
()fficials at Biogen and Elan declined to speak
to The Daily concerning the recall.
Tysabri has been linked with a potentially fatal

neurological disease, known as progressive multi
focal leukoencephalopathy, or PML.
Arney Rosenblat, spokesperson for the National
Multiple Sclerosis Society, said that PM Lisa rare and
rapidly progressive disease of the nervous system.
"Symptoms include mental deterioration, vi
sion loss, speech disturbances, loss of coordina
tion, paralysis, ultimately coma and usually
death," she said in an interview with The Daily.
"There is no cure for PML and no effective treat
ment. except to treat some of its symptoms."
Two cases of the disease were reported by
Tysabri users, one of whom recently died. Moth pa
tients were involved in a two-year l< mgstudy in which
they added Tysabri to their usual d< >sage of Av< >nex.
Biogen executives said in a press release that
since there were no reports of PML in patients
who were taking Avonex without Tysabri, sus
pension of Avonex would not be necessary.
Patricia O'Looney, member of the research de-

partment of the National Mul
tiple Sclerosis Society, said in
an interview with The Daily
that Avonex has been on the
market for nearly a decade. It
was approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administra
tion. or FDA, in 19%, and
there have been a tremendous
number of clinical studies to
account for its safety.

She added that the Biogen and Elan corpora
tii ins will conduct a lull investigation with a panel of
experts on PML to determine if there is in fact any
correlation between the disease and use ol'Tysabri.
"It is still too early to determine whether or not
Tysabri is in any way connected with these inci
dents of PML," she said. "The patients may have
simply developed the disease as a result of a mal
function in their immune systems which was in no

way connected with Tysabri."
O'Looney added that the future of the drug de
pends on the results of the investigation conduct
ed by the two companies and the expert panel.
The drug was approved by the FDA in No
vember 2(X)4 as a breakthrough in the treatment
of multiple sclerosis. This approval came after
tvtfo-years of testing.
"The testing consisted of three standard phas
es: phase one was toxicity testing; phase two was
dose finding; and phase three was proof of efficacy
testing," Steinman said in an interview with The
Daily. "The tests were all placebo controlled and
phase three lasted for two years."
O'Looney said that the testing of Tysabri in
cluded two concurrent clinical trials, one in which
patients were given the drug by itself, and another
in which Tysabri was accompanied by Avonex.


Larry Steinman
"Approximately 1,0()0 patients par
ticipated in the two studies combined."
she said. "Of these 1,000 patients, only
two cases of PML were reported."
During the trial period. Steinman
repeatedly spoke and wrote about po
tential serious immune system side ef
fects that could result from the use of
the drug, including PML.
In a March 1 article in The New
York limes, Steinman said that he had
voiced his concerns about the drug in
speeches and in an article in the July
issue of Science magazine. He said he
had been asked by Biogen executives
to tone down criticism of the drug.
Steinman said the FDA should not
have approved the drug because Tysabri
interfered with the immune system,
making the risk of developing a serious
disease, such as PML. unavoidable.
"Despite this criticism, the FDA felt
that the data from the clinical trials was
sufficient to approve Tysabri,"
O'Ltxiney said. "The drug decreased
the rate of clinical relapses by two
thirds and decreased the development
of new brain tumors."
In an interview with The Los Ange
les Times, a spokesperson for Biogen
said that Steinman never met with the
companies to discuss his concerns.
Multiple sclerosis currently affects
approximately 4(X).(XX) people in the
United States.
Steinman told The Daily that ap
proximately 2.(XX) patients were taking
Tysabri at the time of its recall.
In a press release. Biogen and Elan
representatives said that they were test
ing the patients who had participated in
the clinical trials of Tysabri to check for
any adverse effects. TTie FDA, in a pub
lic health advisory issued on Feb. 28, sug
gested that patients being treated with
Tysabri contact their physician to dis
cuss appropriate alternative treatments.

lease. Avonex is another drug developed by Elan
and Biogen, also used to treat symptoms of multi
ple sclerosis.
()fficials at Biogen and Elan declined to speak
to The Daily concerning the recall.
Tysabri has been linked with a potentially fatal

neurological disease, known as progressive multi
focal leukoencephalopathy, or PML.
Arney Rosenblat, spokesperson for the National
Multiple Sclerosis Society, said that PM Lisa rare and
rapidly progressive disease of the nervous system.
"Symptoms include mental deterioration, vi
sion loss, speech disturbances, loss of coordina
tion, paralysis, ultimately coma and usually
death," she said in an interview with The Daily.
"There is no cure for PML and no effective treat
ment. except to treat some of its symptoms."
Two cases of the disease were reported by
Tysabri users, one of whom recently died. Moth pa
tients were involved in a two-year l< mgstudy in which
they added Tysabri to their usual d< >sage of Av< >nex.
Biogen executives said in a press release that
since there were no reports of PML in patients
who were taking Avonex without Tysabri, sus
pension of Avonex would not be necessary.
Patricia O'Looney, member of the research de-

partment of the National Mul
tiple Sclerosis Society, said in
an interview with The Daily
that Avonex has been on the
market for nearly a decade. It
was approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administra
tion. or FDA, in 19%, and
there have been a tremendous
number of clinical studies to
account for its safety.

She added that the Biogen and Elan corpora
tii ins will conduct a lull investigation with a panel of
experts on PML to determine if there is in fact any
correlation between the disease and use ol'Tysabri.
"It is still too early to determine whether or not
Tysabri is in any way connected with these inci
dents of PML," she said. "The patients may have
simply developed the disease as a result of a mal
function in their immune systems which was in no

way connected with Tysabri."
O'Looney added that the future of the drug de
pends on the results of the investigation conduct
ed by the two companies and the expert panel.
The drug was approved by the FDA in No
vember 2(X)4 as a breakthrough in the treatment
of multiple sclerosis. This approval came after
tvtfo-years of testing.
"The testing consisted of three standard phas
es: phase one was toxicity testing; phase two was
dose finding; and phase three was proof of efficacy
testing," Steinman said in an interview with The
Daily. "The tests were all placebo controlled and
phase three lasted for two years."
O'Looney said that the testing of Tysabri in
cluded two concurrent clinical trials, one in which
patients were given the drug by itself, and another
in which Tysabri was accompanied by Avonex.


Larry Steinman
"Approximately 1,0()0 patients par
ticipated in the two studies combined."
she said. "Of these 1,000 patients, only
two cases of PML were reported."
During the trial period. Steinman
repeatedly spoke and wrote about po
tential serious immune system side ef
fects that could result from the use of
the drug, including PML.
In a March 1 article in The New
York limes, Steinman said that he had
voiced his concerns about the drug in
speeches and in an article in the July
issue of Science magazine. He said he
had been asked by Biogen executives
to tone down criticism of the drug.
Steinman said the FDA should not
have approved the drug because Tysabri
interfered with the immune system,
making the risk of developing a serious
disease, such as PML. unavoidable.
"Despite this criticism, the FDA felt
that the data from the clinical trials was
sufficient to approve Tysabri,"
O'Ltxiney said. "The drug decreased
the rate of clinical relapses by two
thirds and decreased the development
of new brain tumors."
In an interview with The Los Ange
les Times, a spokesperson for Biogen
said that Steinman never met with the
companies to discuss his concerns.
Multiple sclerosis currently affects
approximately 4(X).(XX) people in the
United States.
Steinman told The Daily that ap
proximately 2.(XX) patients were taking
Tysabri at the time of its recall.
In a press release. Biogen and Elan
representatives said that they were test
ing the patients who had participated in
the clinical trials of Tysabri to check for
any adverse effects. TTie FDA, in a pub
lic health advisory issued on Feb. 28, sug
gested that patients being treated with
Tysabri contact their physician to dis
cuss appropriate alternative treatments.
Elan Corp. and Biogen Idee, two drug devel
opment and manufacturing companies, have, as of
Feb. 28, voluntarily suspended all sales and clinical
trials of Tysabri, a new drug used to treat multiple
sclerosis. Lawrence Steinman, professor of neu
rology and head of the Immunology Department
at Stanford, participated in its testing.
"This decision is based on very recent reports
of two serious adverse events that have occurred in
patients treated with Tysabri in combination with
Avonex in clinical trials," stated a Biogen press re
