# Water in the Milk Bottle
## Ignorance is bliss when it comes to banking 
### 
In the last year or so, a lot of my friends have told
me they've begun todisregard the news. "It's just too
depressing," they say. "I can't bring myself to face
it."
That is how I feel about my bank account.
With me, money flows like water. Flows out, that
is - rushes out in torrents, then dribbles away and all
the while there's that tiny bit at the top that's perpet
ually just evaporating.
As with any problem that needs correction, I try
to begin by observing the process, looking for the
chink in the pipes, the weakness where things go
wrong. So fora few months, I went around and
watched myself spend money. This was reasonably
pleasant.
Less pleasant was finally sitting down to eval
uate my transaction history. The evaporating bit
apparently comes from my foodie habit com
bined with a lack of kitchen skills (read: pa
tience). I have long since marked up this expense
as unavoidable. Instead, I'm choosing to target
the major leaks.
In my recent statements, the large purchases have
been a WWI 16mm movie camera off Ebay, with
lenses, etc., and a Fender Stratocaster, with amp, etc.
As the use of 'etc.' might suggest, I am still not
sure exactly what all I bought, as I have yet to make

use of the camera or learn to play
the guitar.
My penchant for creating such
useless outlets for my liquid cash
flow clearly indicates a false sense
of incredible wealth. The ques
tion then becomes. How can I
spend money in a way that makes
me feel as poor as I actually am?
Thus far. I've found only two
things that really make me cringe
- parking meters and vending ma

chines.
There's something about counting out weighty
little coins and feeding them one by one into the coin
slot that makes you feel the money passing out of
you. The coins are tricky to manipulate. The dimes
get jammed in together or you drop some nickels or
you don't count the change fast enough and the
vending machine refunds you, nonconsensually.
In short, coins do not flow like water. They flow
like toilet paper. Like toilet paper in a public re
stroom where the toilet paper roll has obviously
been compressed so that it does not actually roll.
I thought perhaps if all my transactions were as
ungainly as a misshapen roll of toilet paper. 1
might feel the same distress about my other pur
chases. So I tried paying for things in cash only,
coins only, which worked until I started confusing
Susie B's for quarters. And while I did feel deeply
saddened with each passing coin, I also felt em
barrassed.
People stare. People stare at me for many rea
sons, like when I sing to myself while snowboarding.
But when you pay for books in coins, and confuse
your coins, people stare because you are slow. Partly
because slow looks stupid, but also because slow pre
vents soccer moms from picking up their kids on time
and causes all kinds of people to hate you.
So I had to give up on that, but fortunately,
serendipitously, something else happened to curb
my regular free-spending ways.
During Dead Week, just before 1 went online to
flagrantly book a flight to Rome, I received a call
from my bank.
"Did you purchase any magazines or cosmetics
online over the weekend?" the lady asked.
I had not. Some random person, possibly my
guardian angel, had spent the weekend using my
debit card for calcium supplements and the DVD of
White Chicks. (Apparently the companies could
only ship to the billing address.)
In consequence, I spent nothing and went
nowhere fora week until I received my new debit
card. Now, while this does not permanently cripple
my debit spending habits, I did have to move money
around between accounts and ATMs and in the pro
cess I have gotten extremely confused about it all.
And, as I have mentioned, I do not like to look at
my statements.
Now that I have no idea how much money is be
hind the plastic, I've been spending quite conserva
tively.
