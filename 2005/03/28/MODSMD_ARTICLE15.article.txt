Although the words "spring break" usual
ly connote wild nights and days at the beach,
for many Stanford students, the past week
away from campus was not necessarily spent
with tanning oil in one hand and a margarita in
the other. From traveling to the other side of
the world to taking part in a cultural experi
ence, students found many ways to keep busy
after finals.
International student Karen Chiao. a fresh
man, returned home to Taipei. Taiwan, to visit
family and friends and to get a head start on
her summer job hunt.
Chiao was among the lucky students whose
finals schedule allowed her to enjoy almost a
week and a half of break. After the long plane
trip toTaipei, she said she was relieved to have
extra time to spend with her family and friends
before having to head back to campus.
"I left Stanford on Tuesday and got [home]
on Thursday," Chiao said. "1 went home to see
my parents and friends. 1 visited a lot of my
friends and we rode motorcycles together and
went into the mountains to watch the night
view. We haven't seen each other in a long
time and it was really c<x>l seeing each other
again. 1 also learned photography from my
Godbrother and we took a lot of pictures to
gether."
The break from classes and her return to

home allowed Chiao to re
flect on how she has devel
oped throughout her first
year at school thus far.
"I also met with two tu
tors I had in Taipei and we
exchanged feelings about

how I've changed after coming to Stanford,"
she said.
Chiao did not only socialize and relax over
break. She capitalized on her presence in
Taipei by interviewing fora summer intern
ship in marketing.
"This is the first time I've interviewed with
a company, and since I'm a freshman. I don't
really have any professional skills." she said.
"It was pretty intimidating."
For students who chose to stay in the Unit
ed States, Southern California was a popular
destination for many. Whether visiting friends
or taking a trip to the sunny beaches, the area
offered a multitude of opportunities for spring
breakers.
"I was visiting friends in SoCal at UC-San
Diego and Whittier," said Wendi
Chiong, a freshman. "The weather was perfect
for going to the beach."
Freshman Stephanie Fagliano Ux>k a road
trip with a group of friends throughout South
ern California.
"We first drove to San Juan Capistrano,
which is in Orange County," she said. "We
went to the beach, walked along the pier and
pretty much stayed in the
area for two days."
Their trip also afforded the group the
chance to play heroes. At the beach.
Fagliano's friends rescued three children who
were caught in the undercurrent. According to
Fagliano, the children were about nine years

old and their frantic mothers were grateful for
their efforts, which they said helped them jus
tify the lack of any form of schoolwork over
the break.
The group then headed north to Los An
geles. They stopped at the Rainbow shoe com
pany factory and then finally made their way to
Cayucos, a beach town, before heading back
to Stanford.
Senior Albert Chan engaged in a different
type of traveling over break. He Co-led a group
of students from the Redwtxxl Club. Stan
ford's back packing and camping club.thn uigh
Death Valley National Park.
"I decided to co-lead [this trip] because of
rumors of the best wildflowers in more than 50
years," Chan said. "In addition. Death Valley
has amazing, breath-taking scenes that seem
t(x> eerie to be real.
"In two days, we backpacked a 25-mile
ltx>p and saw ax>l marshes, lush springs, crazy
canyons and some of the most amazing rtx:k
formations. In addition, we also rose to watch
the sunrise over the famous sand dunes of

Death Valley. The ax>l thing about backpack
ing is that it's insanely cheap to do â€” you only
have to really cover food and gas for the trip,"
he added.
Despite the break from school work, some
students took a more educational approach to
the break. The Alternative Spring Break pro
gram. known as ASB. offered students a
unique learning experience.
Rita Ouseph. a freshman, took part in the
Filipino-American Identity ASB trip, which
took her to San Francisco. Stockton and Los
Angeles. During the week-long trip. Ouseph
saw many facets of Filipino-American life in
California that she had never encountered be
fore.
"We visited different organizations that
were dealing with Filipino Americans in the
United States." Ouseph said. "We went to an
anti-war rally and we labeled condoms and
lubes for an AIDS conference. We also
talked to former gang members in South
Central Los Angeles and saw a really cool
break dance battle."
