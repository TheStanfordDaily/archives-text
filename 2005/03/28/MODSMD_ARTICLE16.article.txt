# Spring Break 2005

Wilh made-for-TV movies like "Spring
Break: Shark Attack" and MTV broadcasts
titled "Spring Break: Cancun." many think
of spring break as a time to bask under the
sun. But sunny skies did not greet all stu
dents this break. Instead, the vacation plans
of many Stanford students took them away
from the mild weather of Palo Alto and
transplanted them into the colder, harsher
destinations in the East.
In a survey regarding the spring break ex

periences of the all-freshman dorm Donner,
roughly 60 percent of respondents reported
traveling east of the Mississippi River during
their week off from school.
As spring and sunshine unfold across the
West Coast, much of the East Coast cur
rently faces temperatures in the 30s or 4()s.
Trees remain barren and skies are often
gray. Parts of New Jersey and New York saw
the first late March snowstorms in years.
Of course, few ever travel to the East
Coast in search of sunshine. Many students
went to visit their homes, friends or family,
while others went to check out popular cities

like New York, Boston, Providence,
Philadelphia and Chicago. Some did both
simultaneously.
"I went to New York to visit some
cousins," freshman Jill Wurzburg said. "It
was my first time there, and 1 loved it. I did
all the touristy things, like seeing the Plaza
Hotel, a Broadway show and Times Square,
but 1 also just spent a lot of time walking
around, getting a feel for the city."
Although students by and large enjoyed
their trips, many were unprepared for the
weather and seemed shocked at the wintry
conditions. Jiun Haur Wang, a freshman
from Singapore, where the temperature
rarely falls below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, vis
ited friends and family in windy Chicago and
icy Michigan. He soon discovered that win
ter in these areas was far from the balmy
temperatures of his home in Singapore.
"Chicago was pretty fun," Wang said. "1
got to see a big city in the U.S.. which I don't

really get to see in Palo Alto. But it's bleed
ing cold. So bleeding cold. Uninhabitable."
Some East Coast veterans found the cold
less bothersome and enjoyed a little snow
and frost, but decided to try to find warmer
weather in their spring break futures.
"I plan on traveling in the future,
hopefully to someplace warm, but it was
perfect for me to be home this past week
because 1 miss the East Coast," said fresh
man Anne Barry, who went home to Rye,
New York.
Those on the West Coast seemed to have
had much more pleasant weather. At the
very least, they missed out on snow and
below-freezing temperatures.
"I went to Newport Beach to see the
beach and blondes â€” it's even better than
the O.C. on TV" Sam Fankuchen, a fresh
man and California native, said.
Had he been on the East Coast, he would
have sung a different tune.
