# Vacationing at home is just as nice...
## 
### JENNY BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Some of my friends hopped on planes to
Mexico or boarded ships fora week-long ex
cursion in the Caribbean. I, however, opted
for the 15-minute drive home in my dad's
white station wagon.
The decision to spend my spring break at
home was not a difficult one, mostly due to the
fact that I didn't have anything better to do.
Nonetheless, I conclude my break on the
evening of Easter Sunday completely satisfied
with a relaxing week in Los Altos, California.
I spent my first afternoon at home perusing
the kitchen cabinets and reuniting with canned
tuna fish, fresh strawberries and all the other
culinary wonders not offered in Wilbur Din
ing. Food was a major plus of spending my
spring break at home. Not only did I have an
open kitchen to make scrambled eggs at odd
hours of the night, but my parents were actual
ly excited to cook me dinner. The home cook
ing was definitely much appreciated.
I also became reacquainted with my favorite
restaurants of the area. Yes, I know that they
are available while I'm at school as well, but as
a freshman without a car. I am not able to visit

my favorite cheap Mexican restaurants and in
dependent coffee houses while living at school.
The Treehouse simply doesn't measure up.
Since not all of my high school friends were
home during the same time I was. I ended up
spending a large portion of the week with my
family. I went to an Irish dancing show with
them in San Jose to celebrate St Patrick's Day.
We bonded over gourmet leftover corned
beef and cabbage.
On a more serious note, 1 really enjoyed
spending time with my parents and sister
without having time constraints. For example,
over winter break, I didn't see my family very
much because 1 already had to balance time
catching up with high school buddies I hadn't
seen since the summer and spending time with
my boyfriend.
This quality time with my parents also
greatly improved our relations. Despite one
incident in which my mom discovered that I
used White-Out to cover a scratch I had made
on her car a couple years back, the week was
fairly free of family disputes.
A highlight of my break was spending
some time reuniting with my old group from
high school. I keep up with most of my close
friends, but I have found that it is really neces

sary to see them in person to notice the full ef
fects of the change they have underwent dur
ing their first year in college. It is always com
forting to he around a group of people you
have known for such a long time and have be
come very close with.
Another luxury of home is my beloved
white Volvo S7O. Although the rain and cold
kept me from taking the many anticipated
trips to Santa Cruz, having a car gave me the
independence I had lost since coming to Stan
ford. I lovingly jumped into the car and drove
to San Francisco with my mom and a friend
one day to go shopping around Union Square.
My "down time" over break was a great
time to get things done. Before you criticize,
remember, we're all still high-achieving Stan
ford students. I had a couple interviews for
summer internships at local newspapers and 1
worked on essays for an internship at a local
politician's office.
I also had time to curl up in bed and do
some free reading. Although we all read a lot
at school, there is nothing like reading for
pleasure. I read "A Confederacy of Dunces"
over break, and I thought it was a brilliant
novel with a hilarious main character (I won't
spoil the ending by sharing more).

Last, but not least, I made a trip to my old
school, Mountain View High School. It was so
nice to reminisce. I saw some of my favorite
teachers and I sat in on (and sort of disrupted)
my high school journalism class.
Although a spring break in Cancun or St.

John's would have definitely left me with bet
ter stories to tell and more experience under
my belt, my spring break spent in my home
town just about six miles south of Stanford
down El Camino allowed me to really take a
break for this one week.

have known for such a long time and have be

Another luxury of home is my beloved
white Volvo S7O. Although the rain and cold
kept me from taking the many anticipated
trips to Santa Cruz, having a car gave me the
independence I had lost since coming to Stan
ford. I lovingly jumped into the car and drove
to San Francisco with my mom and a friend
one day to go shopping around Union Square.
My "down time" over break was a great
time to get things done. Before you criticize,
remember, we're all still high-achieving Stan
ford students. I had a couple interviews for
summer internships at local newspapers and 1
worked on essays for an internship at a local
politician's office.
I also had time to curl up in bed and do
some free reading. Although we all read a lot
at school, there is nothing like reading for
pleasure. I read "A Confederacy of Dunces"
over break, and I thought it was a brilliant
novel with a hilarious main character (I won't
spoil the ending by sharing more).

Last, but not least, I made a trip to my old
school, Mountain View High School. It was so
nice to reminisce. I saw some of my favorite
teachers and I sat in on (and sort of disrupted)
my high school journalism class.
Although a spring break in Cancun or St.

John's would have definitely left me with bet
ter stories to tell and more experience under
my belt, my spring break spent in my home
town just about six miles south of Stanford
down El Camino allowed me to really take a
break for this one week.

Some of my friends hopped on planes to
Mexico or boarded ships fora week-long ex
cursion in the Caribbean. I, however, opted
for the 15-minute drive home in my dad's
white station wagon.
The decision to spend my spring break at
home was not a difficult one, mostly due to the
fact that I didn't have anything better to do.
Nonetheless, I conclude my break on the
evening of Easter Sunday completely satisfied
with a relaxing week in Los Altos, California.
I spent my first afternoon at home perusing
the kitchen cabinets and reuniting with canned
tuna fish, fresh strawberries and all the other
culinary wonders not offered in Wilbur Din
ing. Food was a major plus of spending my
spring break at home. Not only did I have an
open kitchen to make scrambled eggs at odd
hours of the night, but my parents were actual
ly excited to cook me dinner. The home cook
ing was definitely much appreciated.
I also became reacquainted with my favorite
restaurants of the area. Yes, I know that they
are available while I'm at school as well, but as
a freshman without a car. I am not able to visit

my favorite cheap Mexican restaurants and in
dependent coffee houses while living at school.
The Treehouse simply doesn't measure up.
Since not all of my high school friends were
home during the same time I was. I ended up
spending a large portion of the week with my
family. I went to an Irish dancing show with
them in San Jose to celebrate St Patrick's Day.
We bonded over gourmet leftover corned
beef and cabbage.
On a more serious note, 1 really enjoyed
spending time with my parents and sister
without having time constraints. For example,
over winter break, I didn't see my family very
much because 1 already had to balance time
catching up with high school buddies I hadn't
seen since the summer and spending time with
my boyfriend.
This quality time with my parents also
greatly improved our relations. Despite one
incident in which my mom discovered that I
used White-Out to cover a scratch I had made
on her car a couple years back, the week was
fairly free of family disputes.
A highlight of my break was spending
some time reuniting with my old group from
high school. I keep up with most of my close
friends, but I have found that it is really neces

sary to see them in person to notice the full ef
fects of the change they have underwent dur
ing their first year in college. It is always com
forting to he around a group of people you
