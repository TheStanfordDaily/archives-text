Less than a year after the ground
breaking ceremony, the Bridging the
Rift project, or BTR, began research in
January at its facility on 150 acres of
land straddling the Israeli-Jordanian
border. Scientists from Stanford and
Cornell, as well as researchers from uni
versities in the two Middle Eastern na
tions, are participating in the collabora
tion, which The Jerusalem Post called
the first joint biological field survey ever
conducted on both sides of the border.
The site, which were donated by the
Israeli and Jordanian governments,
has been deemed a "free education
zone" by the countries' leaders, ac
cording to the Stanford News Service.
Leaders in Israel and Jordan
agreed last February to remove the
barrier along the border to accommo
date the project. Scientists and mem
bers of the BTR team will eventually
be able to enter the site from either
country, using specially coded magnet
ic cards as substitutes for passports and
visas, according to the News Service.
Biological Sciences Prof. Marc
Feldman, who is currently serving as

the project's director and traveling be
tween Stanford and the BTR site, told
the News Service that he hopes scien
tists from Egypt, Lebanon and Pales
tine will eventually participate in re
search at the BTR project as well.
While the immediate goal of the
project is to collect information about
the unique ecology of the Dead Sea re
gion, the underlying objective is to
study science and build peaceful con
nections simultaneously.
"The development of a critical mass
of professionals and researchers in sci
ence is essential for more equitable eco
nomic advancement in the region,"
Feldman said in an interview with The
Daily. "As Israelis and Jordanians study
and work together with scholars from
around the world, the benefits of peace
will become too obvious to ignore."
Feldman began working with the
BTR project in 2001, when he was ap
proached by project Chief Executive
Director Mati Kochavi, an Israeli busi
nessman living in New York.
Kochavi envisioned a research cen
ter jointly operated by Israel and Jor
dan that would encourage the free ex
change of ideas between Arab and Is
raeli scientists, graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows, according to the
News Service.
Construction on the site is slated to
finish sometime in the next three to
five years. Plans for the facility include
a laboratory, research space and a con
vention center.
A project called the Library of the
Desert will operate under the manage
ment of Ron Elber, an Israeli citizen
and Cornell professor of computer sci
ence. The aim of the library is to as
semble a digital catalog and a bank of
living samples of all microbes, fungi,
plants, insects, vertebrates and inverte
brates in the region.
"The region is one of the most in
teresting natural laboratories for geol
ogists, microbiologists and environ
mental scientists in the world," Feld
man said. "There are numerous organ
isms in the Dead Sea — the most
saline body of water on Earth — and
in the desert, one of the hottest places
on the planet. How they are able to
survive in such extreme conditions is of
great interest to geneticists and other
life scientists."
Up to 1 .(XX) students, staff, faculty
and postdoctoral fellows will be able to
live at the project center after con
struction is completed, but no one cur
rently resides at the site.
"We expect people to come from
all over the Middle East," Feldman
said. "There's really no limit if people
of good will want to participate."
Stanford students could also even
tually have the opportunity to conduct
research on the site, Feldman added.
Although tenuous peace has exist
ed between Israel and Jordan since
1994, Feldman said, "everybody
would like to see a much warmer rela
tionship at the level of trade, com

merce and diplomacy."
The project's founders expressed
their hope that the center will foster
friendly relations on the institutional
level. Feldman noted that both King Ab
dullah II of Jordan and Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon of Israel have shown strong
support for the project and its goals.
The BTR team provided all of the
seed money for the project, mobilized
both governments to donate the land
and worked to secure the site and de
sign a research program appropriate
for the surroundings.
Kochavi said the legalities and se
curity issues associated with establish
ing the "free education zone" have
been very complicated. ,
"Nothing has been simple about
this project," he said. "But this kind of
effort is necessary if you want to make
a shift in the Middle East paradigm."
Having spent four years overcom
ing bureaucratic obstacles, Kochavi
told the Cornell news service that over
time the educational possibilities pre
sented by the new center could con
tribute to "ending an age-old para
digm of hate and conflict."
Harold Mooney, professor of envi
ronmental biology and senior fellow at
the Stanford Institute for International
Studies, participated in the first field
survey conducted on the site in January.
"It was exciting seeing the Israeli
and Jordanian scientists interact with
our group," Mooney said. "1 have felt
fora long time that science is an im
portant instrument for peace because
scientists speak a universal language."
Scientists in all parts of the world
hold meetings in which English is the
international scientific language, effec
tively eliminating the language barrier
in the communication of new ideas.
Mooney said.
Researchers everywhere read
many of the same journals and there
are groups working specifically to
maintain the free circulation of scien
tists between nations, regardless of po
litical divisions. Mooney said that
these groups played an important role
during the Cold War and continue to
do so today.
"It was a wonderful experience to
witness the excitement of the possibility
of [Israeli and Jordanian scientists] doing
work together in the future," Mooney
said. "The project made this possible."
Stanford will be hosting a conference
this spring on microbial ecology that will
bring together computer scientists from
Jordan and Israel. Feldman said. Partic
ipants will discuss future studies stimu
lated by the initial research that was con
ducted at the site in January.

"The development of a critical mass
of professionals and researchers in sci
ence is essential for more equitable eco
nomic advancement in the region,"
Feldman said in an interview with The
Daily. "As Israelis and Jordanians study
and work together with scholars from
around the world, the benefits of peace
will become too obvious to ignore."
Feldman began working with the
BTR project in 2001, when he was ap
proached by project Chief Executive
Director Mati Kochavi, an Israeli busi
nessman living in New York.
Kochavi envisioned a research cen
ter jointly operated by Israel and Jor
dan that would encourage the free ex
change of ideas between Arab and Is
raeli scientists, graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows, according to the
News Service.
Construction on the site is slated to
finish sometime in the next three to
five years. Plans for the facility include
a laboratory, research space and a con
vention center.
A project called the Library of the
Desert will operate under the manage
ment of Ron Elber, an Israeli citizen
and Cornell professor of computer sci
ence. The aim of the library is to as
semble a digital catalog and a bank of
living samples of all microbes, fungi,
plants, insects, vertebrates and inverte
brates in the region.
"The region is one of the most in
teresting natural laboratories for geol
ogists, microbiologists and environ
mental scientists in the world," Feld
man said. "There are numerous organ
isms in the Dead Sea — the most
saline body of water on Earth — and
in the desert, one of the hottest places
on the planet. How they are able to
survive in such extreme conditions is of
great interest to geneticists and other
life scientists."
Up to 1 .(XX) students, staff, faculty
and postdoctoral fellows will be able to
live at the project center after con
struction is completed, but no one cur
rently resides at the site.
"We expect people to come from
all over the Middle East," Feldman
said. "There's really no limit if people
of good will want to participate."
Stanford students could also even
tually have the opportunity to conduct
research on the site, Feldman added.
Although tenuous peace has exist
ed between Israel and Jordan since
1994, Feldman said, "everybody
would like to see a much warmer rela
tionship at the level of trade, com

merce and diplomacy."
The project's founders expressed
their hope that the center will foster
friendly relations on the institutional
level. Feldman noted that both King Ab
dullah II of Jordan and Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon of Israel have shown strong
support for the project and its goals.
The BTR team provided all of the
seed money for the project, mobilized
both governments to donate the land
and worked to secure the site and de
sign a research program appropriate
for the surroundings.
Kochavi said the legalities and se
curity issues associated with establish
ing the "free education zone" have
been very complicated. ,
"Nothing has been simple about
this project," he said. "But this kind of
effort is necessary if you want to make
a shift in the Middle East paradigm."
Having spent four years overcom
ing bureaucratic obstacles, Kochavi
told the Cornell news service that over
time the educational possibilities pre
sented by the new center could con
tribute to "ending an age-old para
digm of hate and conflict."
Harold Mooney, professor of envi
ronmental biology and senior fellow at
the Stanford Institute for International
Studies, participated in the first field
survey conducted on the site in January.
"It was exciting seeing the Israeli
and Jordanian scientists interact with
our group," Mooney said. "1 have felt
fora long time that science is an im
portant instrument for peace because
scientists speak a universal language."
Scientists in all parts of the world
hold meetings in which English is the
international scientific language, effec
tively eliminating the language barrier
in the communication of new ideas.
Mooney said.
Researchers everywhere read
many of the same journals and there
are groups working specifically to
maintain the free circulation of scien
tists between nations, regardless of po
litical divisions. Mooney said that
these groups played an important role
during the Cold War and continue to
do so today.
"It was a wonderful experience to
witness the excitement of the possibility
of [Israeli and Jordanian scientists] doing
work together in the future," Mooney
said. "The project made this possible."
Stanford will be hosting a conference
this spring on microbial ecology that will
bring together computer scientists from
Jordan and Israel. Feldman said. Partic
ipants will discuss future studies stimu
lated by the initial research that was con
ducted at the site in January.
Less than a year after the ground
breaking ceremony, the Bridging the
Rift project, or BTR, began research in
January at its facility on 150 acres of
land straddling the Israeli-Jordanian
border. Scientists from Stanford and
Cornell, as well as researchers from uni
versities in the two Middle Eastern na
tions, are participating in the collabora
tion, which The Jerusalem Post called
the first joint biological field survey ever
conducted on both sides of the border.
The site, which were donated by the
Israeli and Jordanian governments,
has been deemed a "free education
zone" by the countries' leaders, ac
cording to the Stanford News Service.
Leaders in Israel and Jordan
agreed last February to remove the
barrier along the border to accommo
date the project. Scientists and mem
bers of the BTR team will eventually
be able to enter the site from either
country, using specially coded magnet
ic cards as substitutes for passports and
visas, according to the News Service.
Biological Sciences Prof. Marc
Feldman, who is currently serving as

the project's director and traveling be
tween Stanford and the BTR site, told
the News Service that he hopes scien
tists from Egypt, Lebanon and Pales
tine will eventually participate in re
search at the BTR project as well.
While the immediate goal of the
project is to collect information about
the unique ecology of the Dead Sea re
gion, the underlying objective is to
study science and build peaceful con
nections simultaneously.
