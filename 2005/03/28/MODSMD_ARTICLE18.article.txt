Less than a year after the ground
breaking ceremony, the Bridging the
Rift project, or BTR, began research in
January at its facility on 150 acres of
land straddling the Israeli-Jordanian
border. Scientists from Stanford and
Cornell, as well as researchers from uni
versities in the two Middle Eastern na
tions, are participating in the collabora
tion, which The Jerusalem Post called
the first joint biological field survey ever
conducted on both sides of the border.
The site, which were donated by the
Israeli and Jordanian governments,
has been deemed a "free education
zone" by the countries' leaders, ac
cording to the Stanford News Service.
Leaders in Israel and Jordan
agreed last February to remove the
barrier along the border to accommo
date the project. Scientists and mem
bers of the BTR team will eventually
be able to enter the site from either
country, using specially coded magnet
ic cards as substitutes for passports and
visas, according to the News Service.
Biological Sciences Prof. Marc
Feldman, who is currently serving as

the project's director and traveling be
tween Stanford and the BTR site, told
the News Service that he hopes scien
tists from Egypt, Lebanon and Pales
tine will eventually participate in re
search at the BTR project as well.
While the immediate goal of the
project is to collect information about
the unique ecology of the Dead Sea re
gion, the underlying objective is to
study science and build peaceful con
nections simultaneously.
"The development of a critical mass
of professionals and researchers in sci
ence is essential for more equitable eco
nomic advancement in the region,"
Feldman said in an interview with The
Daily. "As Israelis and Jordanians study
and work together with scholars from
around the world, the benefits of peace
will become too obvious to ignore."
Feldman began working with the
BTR project in 2001, when he was ap
proached by project Chief Executive
Director Mati Kochavi, an Israeli busi
nessman living in New York.
Kochavi envisioned a research cen
ter jointly operated by Israel and Jor
dan that would encourage the free ex
