The only thing worse than sit
ting alone in the dark, sipping
hard liquor while contemplating
the fleeting misery that passes
for existence in these parts, is
doing the same with water.

about to launch into a tirade,

do so without acknowledging
the blinding hypocrisy of leclur-

C J I J —
ing on the merits of drinking while living a (tem
porarily) teetotal life.
Now, the more intelligent of you will have de
duced two things from the preceding paragraphs: I
don't drink, and I think you should drink more. The
object of today's lesson is the latter.
While 1 do not imbibe at the moment, 1 have
done so in the past and will do so in the future, so I
feel my thoughts on the matter have at least a little
value.
First things first: Before you decide to blame
your next hangover on my sage advice, I should
make it very clear that I don't care.
Having gotten that out of the way, let me make
an observation. The Stanford campus is a very quiet
place. Were you to wander around late at night, you
would mostly be greeted with silence. This is con
cerning — universities should, after all, be hot beds
of drunken revelry (or something like that).
When I was a young man (now that's a tragic
way to start a sentence), struggling toward my 8.A.,
it was rare that I made it home without stumbling
across drunken people singing and pools of con
gealing vomit. Ah, how 1 miss those days.
I must confess that my late night wanderings
are generally constrained to graduate habitats —
it may well be that in the younger, seedier parts of
campus there are all kinds of gallivanting and ca
vorting eoint» on But I doubt it.

The connection between deathly quiet and so
briety should be obvious to anyone who hasn't
been brainwashed by the cult of Absolute Fun.
However, it would be remiss of me not to offer
for consumption the meaty idea — that is to say
that vegetarians and other soulless vampires (syn
thetic blood only of course) may find this unpalat
able — that a life without occasional excess is bare
ly a life at all and is certainly not one brimming with
activity.
The thought of a life full of vim and vigor brings
me neatly (well maybe not so much) onto my next
point: Americans are crazy.
While this could be expanded into an entire
book, let me instead dwell on one little thing. You
can buy a shotgun, drive a car, be drafted into the
army and be executed — all at the tender age of 18.
And yet, you can't have a drink.
Even more concerning than the sheer absurdity
of the law is the fact that no one appears to com
plain. I mean, you grumble occasionally about var
ious regulations and rules the University may im
pose. But no one stands up to say: "The law is
wrong."
There are campaigns on campus for every polit
ical cause you could possibly imagine (and several
you probably couldn't), why not one to legalize the
fun and frolics of youth?
Of course, the downside of youthful drinking is
that one would lose the ability to hide from the
hoards of children by visiting a bar. The upside,
though—of having bars filled with exuberant
youth—probably makes up for it.
On that thought, I will end and propose a toast:
"To drinks, drunks and youth. May you all live in
harmony."

While this could be expanded into an entire
book, let me instead dwell on one little thing. You
can buy a shotgun, drive a car, be drafted into the
army and be executed — all at the tender age of 18.
And yet, you can't have a drink.
Even more concerning than the sheer absurdity
of the law is the fact that no one appears to com
plain. I mean, you grumble occasionally about var
ious regulations and rules the University may im
pose. But no one stands up to say: "The law is
wrong."
There are campaigns on campus for every polit
ical cause you could possibly imagine (and several
you probably couldn't), why not one to legalize the
fun and frolics of youth?
Of course, the downside of youthful drinking is
that one would lose the ability to hide from the
hoards of children by visiting a bar. The upside,
though—of having bars filled with exuberant
youth—probably makes up for it.
On that thought, I will end and propose a toast:
"To drinks, drunks and youth. May you all live in
harmony."

limail me at navins@stanford.edu if you're an under
aged, hard-drinking, blood-sucking vegetarian who
wants to start a campaign for teenage alcoholism.
