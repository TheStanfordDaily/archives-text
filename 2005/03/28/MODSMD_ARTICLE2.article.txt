### CAMILLE RICKETTS MANAGING EDITOR 
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger found him
self in the hot seat during a special live taping of
MSNBC's "Hardball with Chris Matthews" in Memorial
Auditorium on Monday, March 14. His appearance, part
of the show's nationwide college tour, drew 700 audience
members and more than 200 protesters outside, includ
ing many nurses, teachers and firefighters.
Many of the students who attended the invitation
only event sat on stage and served as the studio audience.
The hour-long episode addressed a variety of issues, in
cluding Schwarzenegger's plans for education reform,
the role of special interests and unions in the political
process and the use of steroids among pro athletes.
The governor vigorously defended his agenda to re
structure pensions for state employees, payment for
teachers, and rules governing the number of the nurses
working in hospitals. He was also asked for his reaction
to the ongoing violence in Iraq and the possibility of
changing same-sex marriage laws.

asked questions to get a sense of how
many Democrats and Republicans
were in attendance. While most of the
students on stage identified them
selves as Democrats, others had
crossed the street from the Hoover
Institution.
Matthews began the interview
with the announcement that a San
Francisco superior court had just
ruled California's laws preventing
gay marriage unconstitutional. While
the governor said that he is support
ive of domestic partnership rights in
lieu of marriage, he added that if the
state Supreme Court agrees that the
current laws should be changed, then
he will follow its lead.
"It is up to the people, and 1 am
just the people's representative,"
Schwarzenegger said. "Things
change over time and as we go on I
think people we become more com
fortable with domestic partnership

and then marriage."
I le said that he is more concerned
about the power being wielded by
mayors to change same-sex marriage
laws and that the ultimate decision
should come from the people rather
than individual politicians.
Matthews then asked
Schwarzenegger how it feels to be a
politician.
"Don't ask me what its like to be a
politician." Schwarzenegger said. "I
have been sent to Sacramento by the
people of California to fix a broken
system but not to be a politician."
He said his j>oal is to represent the
perspective of "the outsider, the ordi
nary citizen, or the guy who makes ac
tion movies, whatever," and that the
politicians currently elected "can't
get the job done."
Matthews noted that the governor
has recently become the target of
nursing and teaching organizations
several of which have funded neg
ative campaign commercials — and
asked whether the governor viewed
these public employees as adversaries
to his reform agenda.
"1 love nurses," Schwarzenegger

said. "Nurses have supported me;
they have saved my life when I was in
the hospital. 1 respect and honor what
they are doing. The same goes for
teachers."
He identified unions and special
interest groups as the real roadblock
to positive change and said that any
move to reduce the patient to nurse
ratio will only exacerbate the 14.000-
nurse shortage that already exists.
Decreasing the ratio will force more
hospitals to declare bankruptcy and
more emergency rooms to close their
doors, he said.
Schwarzenegger described special
interests as "anyone that is putting a
wedge between a legislator or a politi
cian that is supposed to make deci
sions on behalf of the people and the
people" — a definition that includes
unions.
Following the commercial break,
Matthews asked Schwarzenegger to
comment on the current situation in
Iraq and the Middle East.
"We see how happy some of the
people are in Iraq, even though there
is still incredible violence," the gover
nor said. "You can feel that it is going

in a positive direction and I think it is
because of the great influence that the
U.S. has over there."
He added that he believes democ
racy will ultimately prevail in the re
gion despite insurgency and other
problems facing U.S. forces.
Schwarzenegger quickly dis
missed mention of conflict between
himself and actor Warren Beatty, and
of a disagreement with Sen. Ted
Kennedy (D-Mass.), uncle of his wife,
Maria Schriver.
In response to Beatty's barbs that
the governor is attempting to "termi
nate" the state's decency and needs to
"be strong, stand up and confront the
wealthiest 1 percent of Californians,"
Schwarzenegger joked, "If he
promises not to give me advice on
politics, I promise not to give him ad
vice on adting."
While there appears to be a rift be
tween Schwarzenegger and Kennedy
over minimum wage, the governor as
sured that nothing could come be
tween him and his relative and that a
raise in the minimum wage would
harm the California economy in the
long-term.

"Minimum wage alone, looking at
it as a single item, makes no sense." he
said. "1 can say I would like to pay
everyone $100 an hour hut can our
businesses afford that? Can our econ
omy afford that? We have to consider
what creates jobs in the first place."
Several students in the audience
had the chance to ask questions,
which the governor handled with
ease.
When questioned what keeps him
up at night, Schwarzenegger replies
that he sleeps well because he con
science is clear and that "it's very im
portant with this profession that you
don't take your job to bed."
One student asked whether the
governor thought some of his more
divisive public statements — includ
ing the labeling of state Democrats as
"girlie-men"— hurt his efforts to
build bipartisan support for his objec
tives.
"I think I want to bring a little bit
of humor and a little bit of fun to the
political arena because it's so boring,"
Schwarzenegger said. "But one of the
things I'm most proud of is I've
brought Democrats and Republicans

together."
While the interview was absent of
classic Schwarzenegger catch-phras
es, most of the protest signs paraded
outside the auditorium capitalized on
the governor's action star alter-ego.
"Kindergarten Cop is a Kinder
garten Flop" and "Real Men Keep
their Promises to Students" were two
such slogans displayed on signs.
The protesters that crowded the
circle in front of the auditorium be
fore the taping included members of
the California Nurses Association,
the Peninsula Raging Grannies, the
Service Employees International
Union. Local 715 and the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition.
"We're here because Arnold is in
troducing a lot of plans that are hurt
ing education, healthcare and the
safety of workers," Greg Miller, a
member of the California Nurses As
sociation. told the Stanford News Ser
vice. "We fought for 10 years to have
safe staffing in hospitals."
The protest disbanded after
Schwarzenegger sped away in a black
SUV. There were no arrests or cita
tions.
