## Stanford men's basketball has 'heart' 
### JUAN ANTONIO GOVEA 
1 grew up idolizing bailers like Brevin Knight,
Dion Cross and Ryan Mendez. 1 remember the ex
cruciatingly long drives up Highway 101 to see a
game at Maples Pavilion as a kid, and to this day, 1
feel the same tingle 1 did back then when I see the
court. Through the years I've followed Cardinal
basketball — through the highs and the lows —
from Arthur Lee's clutch free throw shooting to
Casey Jacobsen sending Duke home with a loss at
the buzzer; from premature losses to Gonzaga,
North Carolina and Alabama to a heartbreaking
defeat to Jeff Sheppard and Kentucky in 1998. (I
now have trouble watching Ashley Judd movies.)
Last year was an amazing season for the men's
basketball team, and when I found out 1 would be
attending Stanford last spring, I looked forward to
more of the same. Then it happened: Some of the
things I was expecting to return did not. Josh Chil
dress, gone. Monty, gone.
Suddenly Cardinal basketball had a whole new
face. As the early season losses piled up. I kept hear
ing everyone tell me "You should have been here
last year," or "Last year was so much better."
At first I believed them, but as this year's season
progressed, I began to realize something: I was
watching a once-in-a-lifetime season unfold before
my eyes.
This year has given me some of the greatest bas
ketball i have ever seen. Bv no means has it been

pretty, overpowering or even consistent on the
court, but each and every game has been beautiful.
Outnumbered in every game they've played, this
group of individuals has overcome more obstacles
than a contestant on "American Gladiators."
Simply put, what makes this team great is their
collective "heart."
Heart is often referred to on ESPN or in the
movies, and it is usually the lone protagonist that
shows us all his heart. The movies highlight his per
severance in the face of overwhelming odds, his
focus and determination to get better and his unde
niable desire to win. This year on campus, you
haven't needed to rent "Rudy" or "Hoosiers" or
"Cool Runnings" to be inspired, you've merely had
to go down to Maples on game day. All of our play
ers have fought tooth and nail through game after
game of a long season and the fatigue that comes
with it to earn another trip to the Big Dance.
Despite this year's outcome, I have never been
more inspired as a fan of Stanford and college bas
ketball. This season has been a pleasure to watch,
and 1 would like to thank all those involved for mak
ing this season wonderful: the coaching staff, the
players, the trainers and medical staff, the 6th Man
Club, the fans, the Maples staff —everyone that has
shared the ups and downs that this season has
brought. I wouldn't trade this season for any other
— and definitely not last year's.
