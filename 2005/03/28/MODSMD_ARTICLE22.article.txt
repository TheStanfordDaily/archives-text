# Tales of a 19th-grade nothing
## What happened to 'Hello'? 
### 
After having been recently outed as a
graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy
(and also, interestingly enough, as a fas
cist), 1 can save some time in explaining
why it is that 1 never went to any campus
parties as an undergrad: Because every
one lived in the same building and wore
the same clothes to class, not to mention
all the "goose-stepping" or the fact that
there were eight guys to each girl. (Can
you say "artificially short supply and
stress-driven demand resulting in hyper-

inflated valuations"?)
Suffice it to say, my
first experience with
"real" dance parties
was here on the Farm.
While at these parties,
1 observed an alarm
ing phe menon that
1 just can't keep to my
self. It might just be
that I'm old. but. when
1 was in middle / high

suhkh, uie way u> asK a girl to dancc was:
"Hi. do you wanna dance?" Old fash
ioned, I know, because* then we'd just pop
in an 8-track and Frankenstein the night
away. (You do remember the Franken
stein school of slow dancing, right?
Locked arms, stiff legs and rocking side to
side?) Well, apparently, in modern times,
the way to ask a girl to dance is a little
more Discovery Channel, if you will.
From my observations, here's what
you do: First, spot a girl you'd like to
dance with who is, strangely enough, al
ready dancing (usually in a circle of her
closest female or gay male friends). Then
— and this is important — you wait for
her to turn away from you. At that point,
you quickly (because she might turn
back around) sneak up behind her. Fi
nally, and I'm sorry to alarm my more
sensitive readers, but this is actually true,
you begin ramming your pelvis into her
from behind. Once this "request" is
made, the female expresses her approval
or disapproval in an equally non-verbal
and rudimentary way. After taking a
quick glance back, and surveying the
opinions of her surrounding friends of

the would-be suitor, she either circles
away or pushes back against this ram
ming in acquiescence. Ah. young love.
At first, 1 was shocked, and 1 asked
some of my undergrad female friends
about this. They all immediately ex
pressed their disapproval and disgust.
Yet. not a week later. I saw two of them
personally engaging in this very same
behavior. Neat.
What's worse, I tried my old method
and got an even more shocking result.
One night, as 1 moved through the crowd
at a dorm party, I came face to face with ;i
young lady. Now, to be honest, she was a
little bit of a linebacker to my sort of wide
receiver. if one was to compare physiques,
but 1 thought I'd at least say hello. Now,
the only words that left my mouth were
"Hi, how's it going?" What happened
next still haunts me.
In a split second this girl latched her
self onto me with three of her four avail
able limbs (thankfully saving one for
standing purposes) like I was the last pint
of water on "Survivor: Palua" and began
bucking like a rodeo bronco. And just like
in rodeo, after the first eight seconds, 1
wanted off. But I was awash in confusion
and guilt. Perhaps in this brave new world
of sneak-attack pelvic thrusting and back
ing that thing up, my simple greeting had
a new and frightful meaning. 1 held on
until rescued by friends but wondered se
cretly: Had I brought this on myself?
1 suppose my question really is: What
ever happened to "hello"? Are we just
so smart that the simple habits of polite
society no longer apply? Is it wrong that
there are communication majors doing
this?
Whatever the case, it's still spring
break, so here's hoping you "bump into"
someone you like this year — as for me,
I'll be the only guy in Mexico saying:
"Hola, te queiro bailar?"

dance with who is, strangely enough, al
ready dancing (usually in a circle of her
closest female or gay male friends). Then
— and this is important — you wait for
her to turn away from you. At that point,
you quickly (because she might turn
back around) sneak up behind her. Fi
nally, and I'm sorry to alarm my more
sensitive readers, but this is actually true,
you begin ramming your pelvis into her
from behind. Once this "request" is
made, the female expresses her approval
or disapproval in an equally non-verbal
and rudimentary way. After taking a
quick glance back, and surveying the
opinions of her surrounding friends of

the would-be suitor, she either circles
away or pushes back against this ram
ming in acquiescence. Ah. young love.
At first, 1 was shocked, and 1 asked
some of my undergrad female friends
about this. They all immediately ex
pressed their disapproval and disgust.
Yet. not a week later. I saw two of them
personally engaging in this very same
behavior. Neat.
What's worse, I tried my old method
and got an even more shocking result.
One night, as 1 moved through the crowd
at a dorm party, I came face to face with ;i
young lady. Now, to be honest, she was a
little bit of a linebacker to my sort of wide
receiver. if one was to compare physiques,
but 1 thought I'd at least say hello. Now,
the only words that left my mouth were
"Hi, how's it going?" What happened
next still haunts me.
In a split second this girl latched her
self onto me with three of her four avail
able limbs (thankfully saving one for
standing purposes) like I was the last pint
of water on "Survivor: Palua" and began
bucking like a rodeo bronco. And just like
in rodeo, after the first eight seconds, 1
wanted off. But I was awash in confusion
and guilt. Perhaps in this brave new world
of sneak-attack pelvic thrusting and back
ing that thing up, my simple greeting had
a new and frightful meaning. 1 held on
until rescued by friends but wondered se
cretly: Had I brought this on myself?
1 suppose my question really is: What
ever happened to "hello"? Are we just
so smart that the simple habits of polite
society no longer apply? Is it wrong that
there are communication majors doing
this?
Whatever the case, it's still spring
break, so here's hoping you "bump into"
someone you like this year — as for me,
I'll be the only guy in Mexico saying:
"Hola, te queiro bailar?"

After having been recently outed as a
graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy
(and also, interestingly enough, as a fas
cist), 1 can save some time in explaining
why it is that 1 never went to any campus
parties as an undergrad: Because every
one lived in the same building and wore
the same clothes to class, not to mention
all the "goose-stepping" or the fact that
there were eight guys to each girl. (Can
you say "artificially short supply and
stress-driven demand resulting in hyper-

inflated valuations"?)
Suffice it to say, my
first experience with
"real" dance parties
was here on the Farm.
While at these parties,
1 observed an alarm
ing phe menon that
1 just can't keep to my
self. It might just be
that I'm old. but. when
1 was in middle / high

suhkh, uie way u> asK a girl to dancc was:
"Hi. do you wanna dance?" Old fash
ioned, I know, because* then we'd just pop
in an 8-track and Frankenstein the night
away. (You do remember the Franken
stein school of slow dancing, right?
Locked arms, stiff legs and rocking side to
side?) Well, apparently, in modern times,
the way to ask a girl to dance is a little
more Discovery Channel, if you will.
From my observations, here's what
you do: First, spot a girl you'd like to
dance with who is, strangely enough, al
ready dancing (usually in a circle of her
closest female or gay male friends). Then
— and this is important — you wait for
her to turn away from you. At that point,
you quickly (because she might turn
back around) sneak up behind her. Fi
nally, and I'm sorry to alarm my more
sensitive readers, but this is actually true,
you begin ramming your pelvis into her
from behind. Once this "request" is
made, the female expresses her approval
or disapproval in an equally non-verbal
and rudimentary way. After taking a
