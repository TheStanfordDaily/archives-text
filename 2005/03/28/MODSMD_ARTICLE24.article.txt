Stanford is taking more nuanced
view on hacked GSB admissions
Editor's Note: The Stanford Daily re
ported on March 9 that the University
has not decided on a course of action
regarding the 41 students who prema
turely accessed their admissions deci
sions online.
After reading the article "Stu
dents hack GSB admissions" (March
9). I cannot help but think that, while
unauthorized access to admissions
decisions cannot be justified, the eth
ical issue at hand is not black and
white.
As opposed to, say. cheating on
an exam, this "hacking" did not alter
any outcome and there was no real
harm caused. While it is clearly to an
applicant's benefit to know an ad
missions decision early, it is difficult
to imagine how this hurts other ap
plicants, the schools or anyone else.
In fact, if a school has decided on an
applicant and has even taken the
extra step of posting a decision letter
on the Internet, why not notify the
applicant immediately?
It is not clear the applicants knew
they were doing something wrong.
If an applicant is told his or her de
cision letter has already been post

ed on the Internet and is given a
special address on the Apply You
rself Web site to access that informa
tion. should they necessarily con
clude that accessing the letter would
be an ethical violation? Further,
since the applicant could only ac
cess the letter after first logging into
the Apply Yourself Web site, any
reasonable person would realize
that his or her actions could be
traced. Regardless of their ethical
character, would applicants know
ingly break the rules with the full
expectation that they would be
caught?
Focusing on the ethical lapse on
the part of the applicants distracts
from another important issue: Why
is information as sensitive and confi
dential as that in the admissions pro
cess being trusted to third parties
who can't even properly engineer a
simple Web site? Surely those who
allowed the unauthorized access to
occur so trivially deserve part of the
blame.
It has been suggested in the press
that, by summarily rejecting the ap
plicants in question, schools such as
Harvard, the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology and Carnegie
Mellon University have taken this

opportunity to publicly grandstand
in a low-cost way by making an ex
ample of a powerless group. I am
proud that Stanford is taking a more
nuanced view.

Republican involvement in Terri
Schiavo case is 'driven by 'ideo
logical dogma'
Once again the Republicans are
capitalizing on the raw human emo
tions surrounding the tragedy of
Terri Schiavo's comatose state to ad
vance their political agenda and pan
der to the religious right. This is rem
iniscent of the exploitation of the
human tragedy of Sept. 11, 2(M)1 to
justify the disastrous, unlawful at
tack on Iraq.
These intrusions in the private
life of Terri Schiavo are driven by
ideological dogma and not humani
tarian concerns. These same law
makers did not hesitate to send
more than 1,500 U.S. soldiers to
their graves and thousands more
condemned to a life of pain from
physical and psychological war in
juries. More than 100,000 innocent
Iraqi victims civilian have perished

and many more continue to lan
guish in prisons or have been bru
tally treated or killed by sadistic
prison guards.
It is cruelly ironic that the bio
ethics committee that made the de
cision to withdraw Schiavo's feed
ing tube was following the "right
to-die" law George Bush signed as
Texas governor in 1999. Bush has
now reversed his earlier position to
demonstrate his "reverence to the
preservation of life," once again
placing political expediency over
principle, the hallmark of this ad
ministration. Forgotten also are the
152 inmates who were executed
during Bush's tenure as governor of
Texas.

No Child Left Behind program is a
'scare tactic'
Thanks for your insightful editorial
on social security ("Social Security
matters to you." Feb. 28), which is a
cooperative safety net for the old
and for the disabled, not an invest
ment fund. Any money diverted
away from it weakens the system.
I would comment on a more sub

tie but similar political campaign.
Although the analogy is a little weak,
school vouchers can be similarly
seen as diversions from our "socialis
tic" public school systems. "No Child
Left Behind" is in essence a scare
tactic, to denigrate the public
schools, just as the "Society Security
system is going bankrupt" campaign
functions in the campaign against
Social Security. Diverting money
from our public schools — into, in
evitably. private schools — will lead
to their deterioration, not their im
provement.
It is. in my opinion, important to
understand that these campaigns
against socialized disability/retire
ment programs and public schools
systems are cynical attempts to tor
pedo these programs, rather than
improve them. The issues are ideo
logical. not pragmatic, and the re
solve to destroy dates back in some
cases to the forties. To see a more
forthright presentation of these
ideas than is given by the present ad
ministration, I would suggest con
sulting the writings of the Cato Insti
tute, many of which can be found on
the Internet.

Pakistani student still waiting for
student Visa
Regarding your article "Security clear
ances eased for international students"
(Feb. 23), there has not been any change
in the time taken for processing students
visas from Pakistan. It is taking, on aver
age, up to nine to 10 months for students
from Pakistan to get visas for schools in
the United States. 1 myself have been
waiting for ewer 11 months now to get
my student visa renewed so I could go
back and finish my last three semesters
of undergraduate education at Georgia
Tech. I am not sure how the easing of
clearances for foreign students will af
fect students from Pakistan.
