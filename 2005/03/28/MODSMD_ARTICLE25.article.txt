# Stanford ranks second in donations

### NICK HOY SARAH RIZK 
Stanford University attracted more
than $524 million in private donations
in the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31,
2(XW â€” placing the University second,
behind Harvard, for the amount of
such gifts received.
RAND Corporation's influential
survey of "Contributions to Colleges
and Universities" reported early in the
month that donations to Stanford in
creased by K percent last year, while as
a whole contributions to colleges in
creased by 3.4 percent.
The RAND Corporation is a non
profit research organization that eval
uates problems confronting both the
private and public sector.
While Harvard University fin
ished first in the nation for the sec
ond straight year (and for the 27th
year in 3b surveys) in private contri
butions. their donations decreased
slightly last year, from $545 million
to $540 million.
Still, Stanford and Harvard were
the only universities in the nation to
boast over $400 million in private do
nations. Cornell University was third
with $389 million in contributions, and
the University of Pennsylvania and
IJSC rounded out the top five with
$332 and $322 million in private dona
tions, respectively.

According to Martin Shell, Associ
ate Vice President for Development at
Stanford, Stanford's consistent high
performance in private contributions
is anything hut luck. He pointed to a
formula simple in theory, but one that
he said Stanford has clearly mastered
while many others have not.
"We have a strong institution with
great ideas. And great ideas with com
mitted donors can generate great
gifts," Shell said.
These gifts come from various
sources. Donations arrive largely from
alumni and foundations, Shell noted,
but Stanford also received than $125
million from individuals not directly
associated with Stanford last year, and
almost $50 million from corporations.
Donations to Stanford have hov
ered around the $500 million mark
ever since the fiscal year ending in
2(XK), when Stanford experienced a
$260 million jump in private donations
from the year before. During the
19905, donations gradually increased
to approximately $320 million in 1999.
Shell attributed the massive in
crease at the turn of the millennium to
timing, focused fundraising cam
paigns, and the general economic cli
mate, especially in the Bay Area.
"We had a series of mini cam
paigns, targeted fundraising, that were
all concluding around that time," Shell

observed. "And also that was the
height of the dot-com industry."
Of course, fundraising has become
more difficult since the crash of the
high technology sector and the subse
quent recession. Donations would in
evitably be harder to come by fora
university planted directly in the midst
of Silicon Valley's economic malaise.
Shell remarked. Even now. Shell said,
"there are a number of people in the
Bay Area who still feel the impact of
[the recession]."
Somewhat remarkably however,
Stanford's donations never suffered as
much as was originally feared. In ex
planation. Shell pointed to the
Hewlett Challenge, the $4(X) million
contribution from the Hewlett Foun
dation, that doubles the contributions
of certain private donors and thus en
courages them towards supporting or
establishing professorships, fellow
ships, and academic programs.
Perhaps even more importantly,
the Campaign for Undergraduate Ed
ucation, which commenced in the fall
of 2(XH), has recently reached its goal of
$1 billion in fundraising. The cam
paign is set to continue until Decem
ber of this year.
"I think we have a very engaged
academic leadership," Shell said.
"That engagement often leads to sig
nificant investment."
Stanford's leadership bodes well for
the future of the University, Shell re
marked, but ultimately the financial
well-being of Stanford rests largely on
the shoulders of its donors.
"Hopefully students while here will
realize the impact of donating," Shell
said.
