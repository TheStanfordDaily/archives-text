# Stanford wins three of four over break
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a 13-day break for finals, the No. 12
Cardinal baseball squad returned to the field
and managed to sneak in four games between
rainy days. Stanford emerged with a 3-1 record
after home-and-home series against Pacitic and
Sacramento State. Junior starter Jeff Gilmore
walked away from the break with two wins after
15 1 13 innings on the mound, while junior John
Mayberry Jr. maintained his team-high .333 bat
ting average and sophomore outfielder Jim
Rapoport came out of the gates with three mul
tiple hit games.

Cardinal battle for 9-6 win over Pacific
Stanford's first showdown with UOP - its first
game since March 7 - was anything but a pre
dictable return to the diamond.
After two consecutive complete game
shutouts, junior lefthander Mark Romanczuk al
lowed the Tigers a 3-1 lead and was yanked after
the second inning in favor of Gilmore. Gilmore
finished off the game, but the usually solid righty
plunked six batters en route to his third win of the
season.
The Stanford offense manned a fourth frame
comeback, headlined by junior Jed Lowrie's
three-run homer, bumping his team-leading sea

son total to eight.

The Cardinal jumped out to a 3-0 lead by the
third inning of their second game against Pacific
and never let it slip away. Sophomore Jim
Rapoport and freshmen Michael Taylor and
Brendan Domaracki combined for six of Stan
ford's 10 hits, while junior catcher John Hester
drilled his first dinger of the season.
Sophomore Matt Leva earned the win for the
Cardinal, giving up just one run on three hits in his
best - and at 6 1/3 innings, his longest - out
ingot the year. Sophomore Greg Reynolds
and junior Matt Manship followed Leva
with a scoreless frame apiece. UOP first
baseman Brett Manning accounted for half
of his squad's four base knocks.

A year ago, Sac State hurler Ethan
Katz outdid Stanford in a narrow 2-1 Hor
net win. Last week, Katz did it all over
again, holding the Cardinal scoreless in
eight innings of work. After Katz was lift
ed in the ninth, the Hornets gave up three
runs, and with two outs, Jim Rapoport sat
on second as the tying run. However, Sac
State reliever Marshall Plouffe prevented
the comeback from continuing and fanned
junior Chris Minaker to end the contest.
Ronuinc/.uk took the loss to add to an
already rough spring break, allowing nine
hits and four runs in the defeat.
Sac State downed by Stanford, 8-2
The Cardinal are y-l) when they score in
the first frame - and Saturday's first in
ning featured six Stanford runs, a welcome
change after the previous game's stagnant
offensive showing. Lowrie, Taylor and
Mayberry led the way with an RBI double
each in the inning, and four different play
ers chipped in multiple-hit contests.
Gilmore struggled again with hitting
batters - he hit five in the contest - but
otherwise put in a strong, 8 1/3 inning per
formance to garner his second win of the
break.
