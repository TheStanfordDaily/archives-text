# No. 1 Cardinal cruise to Sweet 16
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
No. 1 Stanford may not have en
tered its NCAA Tournament games
in Fresno as it had hoped — as a No.
2 seed instead of a No. 1 — but the
Cardinal left town last Monday just
as planned. Stanford followed up a
94-57 trouncing of 15th-seeded
Santa Clara on Saturday with an 88-
62 victory over l()th-seeded Utah
Monday night, punching a ticket to
Kansas City. Mo. and its second con
secutive Sweet Sixteen.
It had to feel like deja vu for the
Cardinal when Selection Sunday
2005 handed them their second dis
appointing seed in as many years.
While Stanford (31-2) is the top
team in the land according to both
the media and coaches polls, its
work nonetheless failed to merit one
of the championship's four No. 1
seeds in the view of the NCAA's Se
lection Committee.
This came on the heels of last
year's No. 6 tournament seed when
the Cardinal was ranked No. 10 by
the Associated Press. Seems like
somebody must be wrong here.
Fortunately fora West Coast
team, head coach Tara Van-
Derveer's club seems to thrive on
disrespect, advancing to last year's
Elite Eight and narrowly missing a
trip to the Final Four with a two
point loss to Tennessee.
The first step in the Cardinal's
quest for the Final Four was a fami
ly affair, as senior forward Sebnem
Kimyacioglu faced off for the first
time against her younger sister.

for Santa Clara.
"1 can't really describe the emo
tions - I'm so happy for our team
and obviously so glad we won, but at
the same time I was playing against
my sister," Kimyacioglu said. "At
the end, I said that they did a great
job, and that I'm proud of her."
Making a rare start, she respond
ed to the emotions of the night with
a trio of three-point field goals and
11 points, each of which tied her sea
son high.
In a match-up that required the
three-point-happy Broncos to shoot
the ball flawlessly, they did just that
for most of the first half. Despite just
40-percent shooting from the field in
the first half, Santa Clara found an
other gear from beyond the arc. hit
ting seven-of-12 before halftime.
"The three-point shooting is
their game," VanDerveer said.
"This is really different to always be
getting 'out' [on defense] when, a lot
of times, we've been trying to help
'in.'"
With an assist from Stanford's
poor shooting in the early minutes,
the Broncos held a two-point lead
with as little as 6:47 remaining in the
first half.
However, the torrid pace was
too much to sustain. Santa Clara was
just two-of-five from long range in
the second half and shot less than 26
percent from the field overall.

Candiee Wiggins, keyed a 49-9 Cardi
nal run over a 16-minute span in the
first and second halves.
Starting just one player taller than
five feet-nine inches, Santa Clara was
no match for Stanford inside, allowing
the Cardinal a 45-25 edge on the
hoards. Sophomore center Brooke
Smith led the way with 12 rebounds to
go along with 19 points. She also tallied
a season-high five blocks.
Against Utah, the Cardinal played
a rematch of their season opener, a 63-
57 victory in Salt Lake City. From the
opening tip, Stanford was clearly a dif
ferent team than the squad that battled
the Utes to the final minutes earlier in
the season.
Senior guard Susan King Bor
chardt, sidelined by a stress reaction
for the teams' first meeting, led the
Stanford backcourt alongside Wiggins
and fellow senior Kelley Suminski.
She finished with 11 points and
greased Stanford's offense with five as
sists.
Although Wiggins gashed Utah for
24 points the first time around, the Pac
-10 Player of the Year scored just eight
on four-of-seven shooting.
Yet the rest of the Cardinal offense
more than picked up the slack, as five
players notched double-digit points
for the sixth time on the year, led by 20
points from Smith inside.
"They weren't really doubling very
much, so 1 think that's what made it
easier in the first half" Smith said. "In
the second half they were playing a lit
tle bit of zone also, and they were dou
bling more."
Kimyacioglu chipped in a season
high 13. including three-of-four shoot
ing from beyond the arc. With 544
three-point attempts, Kimyacioglu
now holds the Stanford career record,
and is currently third in three-point
field goals with 202.
Other Notes
In a year when Stanford may feel a
bit snubbed by the Selection Commit
tee, the Pacific-10 Conference as a
whole has been extremely impressive,
sending five teams to the NCAA
Tournament and compiling a 5-0
record in the first round of play. It is
the first time the conference has to
taled five first-round victories.
All the success has sparked some
conference camaraderie, at least
among the fans. Cardinal partisans
chanted "Go Pac-10" in the closing
minute of Arizona State's victory over
Notre Dame in Fresno on Monday
night and applauded the Sun Devils as
they exited the Save Mart Center at

no match for Stanford inside, allowing
the Cardinal a 45-25 edge on the

Smith led the way with 12 rebounds to
go along with 19 points. She also tallied
a season-high five blocks.
Against Utah, the Cardinal played
a rematch of their season opener, a 63-

opening tip, Stanford was clearly a dif

the Utes to the final minutes earlier in

Senior guard Susan King Bor

Stanford backcourt alongside Wiggins

She finished with 11 points and

Although Wiggins gashed Utah for
24 points the first time around, the Pac

players notched double-digit points
for the sixth time on the year, led by 20
points from Smith inside.
"They weren't really doubling very

field goals with 202.
Other Notes
In a year when Stanford may feel a
bit snubbed by the Selection Commit
tee, the Pacific-10 Conference as a
whole has been extremely impressive,
sending five teams to the NCAA
Tournament and compiling a 5-0
record in the first round of play. It is
the first time the conference has to
taled five first-round victories.
All the success has sparked some
conference camaraderie, at least
among the fans. Cardinal partisans
chanted "Go Pac-10" in the closing
minute of Arizona State's victory over
Notre Dame in Fresno on Monday
night and applauded the Sun Devils as
they exited the Save Mart Center at
halftime of the Stanford-Utah game.
No. 1 Stanford may not have en
tered its NCAA Tournament games
in Fresno as it had hoped — as a No.
2 seed instead of a No. 1 — but the
Cardinal left town last Monday just
as planned. Stanford followed up a
94-57 trouncing of 15th-seeded
Santa Clara on Saturday with an 88-
62 victory over l()th-seeded Utah
Monday night, punching a ticket to
Kansas City. Mo. and its second con
secutive Sweet Sixteen.
It had to feel like deja vu for the
Cardinal when Selection Sunday
2005 handed them their second dis
appointing seed in as many years.
While Stanford (31-2) is the top
team in the land according to both
the media and coaches polls, its
work nonetheless failed to merit one
of the championship's four No. 1
seeds in the view of the NCAA's Se
lection Committee.
This came on the heels of last
year's No. 6 tournament seed when
the Cardinal was ranked No. 10 by
the Associated Press. Seems like
