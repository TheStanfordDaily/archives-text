### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
No. 1 Stanford may not have en
tered its NCAA Tournament games
in Fresno as it had hoped — as a No.
2 seed instead of a No. 1 — but the
Cardinal left town last Monday just
as planned. Stanford followed up a
94-57 trouncing of 15th-seeded
Santa Clara on Saturday with an 88-
62 victory over l()th-seeded Utah
Monday night, punching a ticket to
Kansas City. Mo. and its second con
secutive Sweet Sixteen.
It had to feel like deja vu for the
Cardinal when Selection Sunday
2005 handed them their second dis
appointing seed in as many years.
While Stanford (31-2) is the top
team in the land according to both
the media and coaches polls, its
work nonetheless failed to merit one
of the championship's four No. 1
seeds in the view of the NCAA's Se
lection Committee.
This came on the heels of last
year's No. 6 tournament seed when
the Cardinal was ranked No. 10 by
the Associated Press. Seems like
somebody must be wrong here.
Fortunately fora West Coast
team, head coach Tara Van-
Derveer's club seems to thrive on
disrespect, advancing to last year's
Elite Eight and narrowly missing a
trip to the Final Four with a two
point loss to Tennessee.
The first step in the Cardinal's
quest for the Final Four was a fami
ly affair, as senior forward Sebnem
Kimyacioglu faced off for the first
time against her younger sister.

for Santa Clara.
"1 can't really describe the emo
tions - I'm so happy for our team
and obviously so glad we won, but at
the same time I was playing against
my sister," Kimyacioglu said. "At
the end, I said that they did a great
job, and that I'm proud of her."
Making a rare start, she respond
ed to the emotions of the night with
a trio of three-point field goals and
11 points, each of which tied her sea
son high.
In a match-up that required the
three-point-happy Broncos to shoot
the ball flawlessly, they did just that
for most of the first half. Despite just
40-percent shooting from the field in
the first half, Santa Clara found an
other gear from beyond the arc. hit
ting seven-of-12 before halftime.
"The three-point shooting is
their game," VanDerveer said.
"This is really different to always be
getting 'out' [on defense] when, a lot
of times, we've been trying to help
'in.'"
With an assist from Stanford's
poor shooting in the early minutes,
the Broncos held a two-point lead
with as little as 6:47 remaining in the
first half.
However, the torrid pace was
too much to sustain. Santa Clara was
just two-of-five from long range in
the second half and shot less than 26
percent from the field overall.
While the Broncos ran cold,
Stanford was just heating up. 56-per
