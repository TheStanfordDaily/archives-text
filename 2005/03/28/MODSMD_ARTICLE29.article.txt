Question: How do you replace a 16-time All-Ameri
can. 11-time national champion and Olympic medalist
like Tara Kirk, who finished her college career by setting
a world record at last year's NCAA Championships?
Answer: Caroline Bruce.
Bruce, a freshman and Olympian, finished a remark
able debut season at Stanford with two national titles to
lead the No. 5 Cardinal to a fifth-place finish at the
NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships last week.
Though she was not the top seed in any event. Bruce
stepped up when it counted, swimming personal bests in
the finals of both the 100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke
races.
" It was a great experience and really exciting to sweep
both of the breaststroke events in my freshman year."
Bruce said. "Tara Kirk was an amazing collegiate swim
mer. Taking after her by winning my first one and follow
ing in her footsteps is quite an honor."
" Bruce claimed the 100-yard breaststroke title with the
third-fastest time in history, just over a second off of Tara
Kirk's record set at last year's NCAA meet. In the 200-
yard race, she came 1.3 seconds short of Kirk s American
record.

She also took third in the 2(X)-yard individual medley
and helped the 2(X)-vard and 400-yard medley relays to
fourth- and third-place finishes, respectively.
Bruce ended the meet ranked second in individual
scoring with 56 of a possible 60 points.
Senior Lacey Boutwell, swimming competitively for
the last time, finished seventh in the 50-yard freestyle and
sixth in the 100-yard freestyle. She also swam on the 400-
yard medley relay, which finished third, and all three
freestyle medleys.
"It was great to finish this way," Boutwell said.
"There's not a moment I regret. My time at Stanford with
coach [Richard] Quick and all of the girls in our program
has been wonderful."
"Lacey Boutwell is the kind of person you can huild a
team around, because she will do anything to have the
team be successful," Quick said. "She has been a great
competitor and great leader for four years. She's been
fantastic and Stanford swimming is going to miss her a
lot."
Junior Dana Kirk, a 2004 Olympian alongside Bruce
and sister Tara. finished fifth in both of the butterfly
events and swam the butterfly leg on both medley relays.
Also an Olympian, junior Kristen Caverly finished

yard freestyle, 22nd in the 100-yard
backstroke and 26th in the 100-yard

freestyle. She swam on both medley
relays and two of the three freestyle
medleys and was the Cardinal's top
finisher in the backstroke.
The distance swimmers, who have
been consistent throughout the sea
son, put in another good perfor
mance at the NCAA meet. In the
1650-yard freestyle, sophomore Lau
ren Costella led the Cardinal with a
sixth-place finish. Freshman Eliza
beth Durot was 10th. followed by
sophomores Desiree Stahley and
Morgan Hentzen, who finished 14th
and 22nd.
In the S(K)-yard freestyle, Hentzen
was the top Stanford finisher in 17th
place, with Durot right behind in
18th and Stahley in 21st. Hentzen
came into the meet seeded 40th in the
event.

Durot was the Cardinal's top fin
isher in the 200-yard freestyle, plac
ing 21st with Boutwell in 27th.
Two Stanford divers, senior Ash
lee Rosenthal and sophomore Cas
sidy Krug. were among the nine qual
ifiers from the Zone E Diving Meet
prior to the NCAA meet and com
peted in the one-meter and three
meter springboard. Rosenthal fol
lowed an 18th place finish in the one
meter by qualifying for the final in
the three-meter and placing eighth.
Krug finished 14th in the one-meter
and 13th in the three-meter.
The Cardinal returns from the
NCAA meet with 40 All-American
honors, including three for diving.
Bruce leads the team with six honors,
three individual and three for relays.
National champion Georgia,

which claimed ihe team title with a
margin of 117 points over runner-up
Auburn, established a strong lead on
the first day and would not relinquish
it. Arizona held on to third from be
ginning to end and Florida, in fifth
place after day one, managed to
overtake the Cardinal and finish
fourth overall.
"I thought our team swam really
well tonight and throughout the en
tire meet," Quick said. "We would
have liked to have finished higher hut
given everything it was probably
about the best we could do."
Stanford has now finished in the
top six in each of the 23 years of
NCAA swimming competition. The
Cardinal has won eight national
championships, most recently in
1998.
