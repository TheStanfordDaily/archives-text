Question: How do you replace a 16-time All-Ameri
can. 11-time national champion and Olympic medalist
like Tara Kirk, who finished her college career by setting
a world record at last year's NCAA Championships?
Answer: Caroline Bruce.
Bruce, a freshman and Olympian, finished a remark
able debut season at Stanford with two national titles to
lead the No. 5 Cardinal to a fifth-place finish at the
NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships last week.
Though she was not the top seed in any event. Bruce
stepped up when it counted, swimming personal bests in
the finals of both the 100-yard and 200-yard breaststroke
races.
" It was a great experience and really exciting to sweep
both of the breaststroke events in my freshman year."
Bruce said. "Tara Kirk was an amazing collegiate swim
mer. Taking after her by winning my first one and follow
ing in her footsteps is quite an honor."
" Bruce claimed the 100-yard breaststroke title with the
third-fastest time in history, just over a second off of Tara
Kirk's record set at last year's NCAA meet. In the 200-
yard race, she came 1.3 seconds short of Kirk s American
record.

She also took third in the 2(X)-yard individual medley
and helped the 2(X)-vard and 400-yard medley relays to
fourth- and third-place finishes, respectively.
Bruce ended the meet ranked second in individual
scoring with 56 of a possible 60 points.
Senior Lacey Boutwell, swimming competitively for
the last time, finished seventh in the 50-yard freestyle and
sixth in the 100-yard freestyle. She also swam on the 400-
yard medley relay, which finished third, and all three
freestyle medleys.
"It was great to finish this way," Boutwell said.
"There's not a moment I regret. My time at Stanford with
coach [Richard] Quick and all of the girls in our program
has been wonderful."
"Lacey Boutwell is the kind of person you can huild a
team around, because she will do anything to have the
team be successful," Quick said. "She has been a great
competitor and great leader for four years. She's been
fantastic and Stanford swimming is going to miss her a
lot."
Junior Dana Kirk, a 2004 Olympian alongside Bruce
and sister Tara. finished fifth in both of the butterfly
events and swam the butterfly leg on both medley relays.
Also an Olympian, junior Kristen Caverly finished
