# Daily burglarized, five monitors stolen
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In September, burglars hit the Stanford De
sign Group. In November, it was the Mechani
cal Engineering Department. This past week
end, it was The Stanford Daily-
Burglars — probably two, police said, judg
ing by the shoeprints — broke into The Daily's
layout office between 4 p.m. Saturday and 3
p.m. yesterday and made off with five flat
screen monitors.
Editor in Chief Cynthia H. Cho, a senior,
said she learned of the break-in around 6 p.m.
Sunday, when sophomore Sports Editor Alex
Gyr went into the layout room.

"He said, 'Cynthia, there are no monitors in
the back,' " Cho said. "I said, 'What do you
mean there are no monitors?' " The two then
noticed a broken window and shattered glass on
the floor and "put two and two together" and
concluded that the monitors had been stolen,
said Cho, who called the police.
Daily Business Manager Eric Eldon, Class of
2004, said he had worried in the past about the
security of the computers in the layout office.
They are plainly visible through a glass window
from the passageway between the Storke Publi
cations Building and the Mechanical Engineer
ing Building, both of which were broken into
last fall. (The Stanford Design Group and The
Daily are both located in the Storke Publica

tions Building.)
Eldon said he asked the police to increase
patrols of the area on weekends, when Daily
staffers are not working. He also installed cable
locks tying monitors to the desks.
"1 thought between those two things we'd be
alright," Eldon said.
But the burglars were apparently well-pre
pared. They entered the building at a time when
there are rarely staffers present; they had the
proper cutters to thwart the cable locks; and
they successfully carried away five large Apple
monitors.
"My guess is they probably knew what they
were facing," said Stanford Police
Sgt. Hilary Karp.
Karp said that cable locks are a
good idea for protecting computers,
but that they are often not enough,
especially when expensive equip
ment is visible to passersby.
"What caught my attention was
that the blinds were wide open,"
Karp said. "I mean, anybody walk
ing down there is going to see [the
monitors]."
Karp said one of the best ways to
deter burglaries on campus is for
people to report any suspicious ac
tivity they see.

"You've just got to call those in
and we'll go out and investigate,"
Karp said. "And then if we find out
there's nothing wrong, there's noth
ing wrong.
"You have a huge campus here,
and you may have two or three offi
cers patrolling," he added. "The
odds of the officer being right be
tween those two buildings at the
time of the break-in are miniscule,
but the odds of someone biking
through the area and seeing it are
much higher. We solve a lot of
crimes that way."
Karp said he didn't know
whether either of last fall's nearby
break-ins had been solved.
Eldon said the computers were
likely insured. Until they are re
placed, Cho said, the paper's nightly
production process may be slowed.
