# Injuries prove costly at Pacific-10 Finals
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
BFRKELLY. Calif. —The No. 29
women's gymnastics team (4-8, 4-3
Pacfic-10 Conference) walked into Pac
-10 Championships this past Saturday to
defend four individual titles and a team
title. They walked out with a fourth
place team finish, one second place in
dividual finish and two gymnasts on
crutches.
Although the team's score of 194.60
fell short of No. 3 UCLA's 197.10, No.
19 Arizona's 195.925 and No. 12 Ore
gon State's 195.90, the effort was com
mendable given the fact that half of
Stanford's gymnasts were either partial
ly or entirely limited by injuries.
Freshman phenom Li/. Tricase, who
led the team in the All-Around during
the regular season, was out with an
ankle injury, as was junior All-Ameri
can Glyn Sweets. Freshman Stephanie
Gentry, a key contributor on vault, floor
and beam, sprained her toe on a tum
bling pass halfway through her floor
routine. Unable to finish her routine,
she spent the remainder of the meet on
crutches.
Gentry was able to compete on bal
ance beam, the team's first event of the
meet. After struggling on beam
throughout the regular season, the Car
dinal finally hit their stride to score a
season-high of 48.875 on the event. Al
though it was the first time in four years
that the Cardinal did not win an indi
vidual beam title, they put forth a solid
team effort. Junior captain Natalie
Foley and freshmen Lauren Elmore
and Tabitha Yim all scored a 9.80 or
better.
"It was the best effort on beam I've
seen yet from the team this year," said
head coach Kristen Smyth. "They
looked strong and confident."
The team was motivated to compete
well on the beam after suffering an un
expected loss to No. 41 San Jose State
last weekend. Stanford started that
meet with two major mistakes on the
beam which put them more than half a
point behind the Spartans. Despite a
strong performance on bars, the Cardi
nal struggled on floor and only widened
their deficit to finish the meet 192.75 to
194.325. The score was just shy of being
their lowest mark this season.
"That meet definitely lit a fire in
them to come out strong |Saturday},"
said Smyth.
Although the team started with its
best performance on beam, it could not
carry its momentum from beam onto
the floor exercise. Elmore and fresh
man Aimee Precourt started the team

with twin 9.805. which ended up being
the team's highest floor scores of the
evening. That is unusual because
scores generally climb as more gym
nasts compete.
Gentry's injury and incomplete rou
tine seemed to make the remaining
gymnasts lose their focus. Yim and
Foley, who both have the potential to
score 9.85s or better on floor, made nu
merous errors and scored a 9.625 and a
9.525, respectively.
"They lost their focus," said Smyth.
"We need to work on mental toughness
in the coming weeks ... If we can stay
focused on floor then we'll be right in
the mix. Our top three performers have
to do their job."
The errors on floor cost Foley valu
able tenths in her All-Around score.
The defending Pac-10 All-Around
champion led her team in the All-
Around, but finished sixth in the overall
standings with a 39.075. UCLA's Kris
ten Maloney andTasha Schwikert, both
Olympians, tied for first place in the All-
Around with a score of 39.70.
After competing on floor, Stanford
progressed to vault. Without Gentry.
Tricase or Sweets, the team had only
five vaulters, leaving no room for mis
takes. The first three gymnasts - El
more. Precourt and junior captain Jes
sica Louie - competed clean layout
Tsukaharas, but since the vault only
starts from a 9.80, their scores only
ranged from a 9.60 to a 9.675. Foley fin
ished the event with a stuck landing
and a 9.825 which was good enough for
a tenth place finish on the event.
The Cardinal finished the meet on
their strongest event this year: the un
even bars. Although Louie crashed on
her dismount, the rest of the team was
not phased. Foley matched her person
al season-high of 9.85 and Yim posted a
9.90 to take second place to Schwikert
who scored a perfect 10.0. Yim. howev
er, competed a watered-down double
back dismount due to a recovering
Achilles injury.
The Cardinal have two weeks off be
fore competing at West Regionals on
April 9 in Seattle. Stanford will compete
against Washington, Boise, and three
other teams yet to be determined. Stan
ford lost to the Huskies in Washington
during the regular season, but edged
them out by 0.175 this past weekend.
Six teams compete at each of six re
gional meets around the country and
the top two teams from each region will
advance to Nationals in Alabama. Stan
ford has been among those twelve
teams for the past four years, but the in
jured team will need to be in top form at
Regionals to continue that streak.

"We need to work on mental toughness
in the coming weeks ... If we can stay
focused on floor then we'll be right in
the mix. Our top three performers have
to do their job."
The errors on floor cost Foley valu
able tenths in her All-Around score.
The defending Pac-10 All-Around
champion led her team in the All-
Around, but finished sixth in the overall
standings with a 39.075. UCLA's Kris
ten Maloney andTasha Schwikert, both
Olympians, tied for first place in the All-
Around with a score of 39.70.
After competing on floor, Stanford
progressed to vault. Without Gentry.
Tricase or Sweets, the team had only
five vaulters, leaving no room for mis
takes. The first three gymnasts - El
more. Precourt and junior captain Jes
sica Louie - competed clean layout
Tsukaharas, but since the vault only
starts from a 9.80, their scores only
ranged from a 9.60 to a 9.675. Foley fin
ished the event with a stuck landing
and a 9.825 which was good enough for
a tenth place finish on the event.
The Cardinal finished the meet on
their strongest event this year: the un
even bars. Although Louie crashed on
her dismount, the rest of the team was
not phased. Foley matched her person
al season-high of 9.85 and Yim posted a
9.90 to take second place to Schwikert
who scored a perfect 10.0. Yim. howev
er, competed a watered-down double
back dismount due to a recovering
Achilles injury.
The Cardinal have two weeks off be
fore competing at West Regionals on
April 9 in Seattle. Stanford will compete
against Washington, Boise, and three
other teams yet to be determined. Stan
ford lost to the Huskies in Washington
during the regular season, but edged
them out by 0.175 this past weekend.
Six teams compete at each of six re
gional meets around the country and
the top two teams from each region will
advance to Nationals in Alabama. Stan
ford has been among those twelve
teams for the past four years, but the in
jured team will need to be in top form at
Regionals to continue that streak.

The Cardinal started hot on the balance beam at last week's Pac-10 championshps but were unable to defend
their team title.
BFRKELLY. Calif. —The No. 29
women's gymnastics team (4-8, 4-3
Pacfic-10 Conference) walked into Pac
-10 Championships this past Saturday to
defend four individual titles and a team
title. They walked out with a fourth
place team finish, one second place in
dividual finish and two gymnasts on
crutches.
Although the team's score of 194.60
fell short of No. 3 UCLA's 197.10, No.
19 Arizona's 195.925 and No. 12 Ore
gon State's 195.90, the effort was com
mendable given the fact that half of
Stanford's gymnasts were either partial
ly or entirely limited by injuries.
Freshman phenom Li/. Tricase, who
led the team in the All-Around during
the regular season, was out with an
ankle injury, as was junior All-Ameri
can Glyn Sweets. Freshman Stephanie
Gentry, a key contributor on vault, floor
and beam, sprained her toe on a tum
bling pass halfway through her floor
routine. Unable to finish her routine,
she spent the remainder of the meet on
crutches.
Gentry was able to compete on bal
ance beam, the team's first event of the
meet. After struggling on beam
throughout the regular season, the Car
dinal finally hit their stride to score a
season-high of 48.875 on the event. Al
though it was the first time in four years
that the Cardinal did not win an indi
vidual beam title, they put forth a solid
team effort. Junior captain Natalie
Foley and freshmen Lauren Elmore
and Tabitha Yim all scored a 9.80 or
better.
"It was the best effort on beam I've
seen yet from the team this year," said
head coach Kristen Smyth. "They
looked strong and confident."
The team was motivated to compete
well on the beam after suffering an un
expected loss to No. 41 San Jose State
last weekend. Stanford started that
meet with two major mistakes on the
beam which put them more than half a
point behind the Spartans. Despite a
strong performance on bars, the Cardi
nal struggled on floor and only widened
their deficit to finish the meet 192.75 to
194.325. The score was just shy of being
their lowest mark this season.
"That meet definitely lit a fire in
them to come out strong |Saturday},"
said Smyth.
Although the team started with its
best performance on beam, it could not
carry its momentum from beam onto
the floor exercise. Elmore and fresh
man Aimee Precourt started the team

with twin 9.805. which ended up being
the team's highest floor scores of the
evening. That is unusual because
scores generally climb as more gym
nasts compete.
Gentry's injury and incomplete rou
tine seemed to make the remaining
gymnasts lose their focus. Yim and
Foley, who both have the potential to
score 9.85s or better on floor, made nu
merous errors and scored a 9.625 and a
9.525, respectively.
"They lost their focus," said Smyth.
