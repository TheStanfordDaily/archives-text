# Regulations correlated with drop in conduct violations
## Greek system cleans up act 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
After several fraternities and sororities
violated University conduct policies last
year, the Office of Student Activities, or
OSA, took action to increase communica
tion between administrators and Greek or
ganization leaders and to improve training
for these students. Given this year's lack of
incidents, these efforts seem to have paid off.
That no fraternities are on alcohol sus
pension or housing probation, seems to indi
cate that improvements have been made in
how such conduct issues are managed, espe
cially in comparison to the last two years,
during which several Greek organizations
faced hearings for alleged incidents of sexu
al assault and hazing.
While last year there were seven Judicial
Affairs hearings with Greek groups, this
year there have only been two heard by the
Organizational Conduct Board, or OCB,
which processes violations of University
policy committed by student groups.
Both cases involved incidents that oc-

curred last year and there are no pending
cases.
Two events last year had a major impact
on the Greek community: a Sigma Alpha
Epsilon pledge being sent to the hospital,
and Delta Delta Delta pledges participating
in a binge-drinking game with members of
the Stanford football team. TriDelt is on al
cohol suspension until June.
Both of these cases involved allegations
of hazing and consumption of alcohol by mi
nors. The latter incident also involved alle
gations of sexual assault.
Nanci Howe, associate dean of students
and director of student activities, and Joey
Greenwell, fraternity advisor and assistant
director of student activities, stressed that
the 2002-2003 academic year was an "anom
aly" and that the lack of major disciplinary
action this year is not unusual.
"In recent memory, this year is more simi
lar to past years," Howe said. "There were an
unfortunate set of circumstances all coming
that same year. It was not indicative."
Even so. OSA took note of the incidents
