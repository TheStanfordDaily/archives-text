# Regulations correlated with drop in conduct violations
## Greek system cleans up act 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
After several fraternities and sororities
violated University conduct policies last
year, the Office of Student Activities, or
OSA, took action to increase communica
tion between administrators and Greek or
ganization leaders and to improve training
for these students. Given this year's lack of
incidents, these efforts seem to have paid off.
That no fraternities are on alcohol sus
pension or housing probation, seems to indi
cate that improvements have been made in
how such conduct issues are managed, espe
cially in comparison to the last two years,
during which several Greek organizations
faced hearings for alleged incidents of sexu
al assault and hazing.
While last year there were seven Judicial
Affairs hearings with Greek groups, this
year there have only been two heard by the
Organizational Conduct Board, or OCB,
which processes violations of University
policy committed by student groups.
Both cases involved incidents that oc-

curred last year and there are no pending
cases.
Two events last year had a major impact
on the Greek community: a Sigma Alpha
Epsilon pledge being sent to the hospital,
and Delta Delta Delta pledges participating
in a binge-drinking game with members of
the Stanford football team. TriDelt is on al
cohol suspension until June.
Both of these cases involved allegations
of hazing and consumption of alcohol by mi
nors. The latter incident also involved alle
gations of sexual assault.
Nanci Howe, associate dean of students
and director of student activities, and Joey
Greenwell, fraternity advisor and assistant
director of student activities, stressed that
the 2002-2003 academic year was an "anom
aly" and that the lack of major disciplinary
action this year is not unusual.
"In recent memory, this year is more simi
lar to past years," Howe said. "There were an
unfortunate set of circumstances all coming
that same year. It was not indicative."
Even so. OSA took note of the incidents
and moved to remedy the situation by
requiring more individual meetings
with Greek chapter leaders and a
reevaluation of training sessions for
these students.
Although there have been minor
incidents this year, the chapters han
dled them very well internally said
Morris Graves, associate dean of stu
dents.
"They didn't intend to violate Uni
versity policy and they made a good
faith effort to correct their actions," he
said. "There were no egregious inci
dents that threatened the health and
safety of the Stanford community."
Fraternities are also making a
greater effort to follow University
guidelines in planning parties and
events, student chapter officers
said.
"Ciiven the alcohol probations of
the past years, I think most Greek or
ganizations are being more cautious
with open social functions," said senior
Graham Gilmer, former president of
Sigma Chi. "Fraternities have realized
that there are several sensitive periods
throughout the year — i.e. New Stu

dent Orientation and Admit Weekend
— during which they absolutely must
adhere to University policy or face se
rious ci >n sequences.
Former Kappa Sigma president
Michael Albanese, a senior, attrib
uted the absence of alcohol sanctions
on campus to concerted efforts made
by fraternities to improve party secu
rity and ensure legal alcohol con
sumption.
"The use of third-party security is
on the increase for most Greek hous
es," Albanese said. "This year we are
taking extra measures to make sure
that no [underage drinking| violations
take place a! all. These measures in
clude using hired security as IDcheck
ers and bartenders."
Dean ol Students (ireg Boardman
lauded the leadership of Greek orga
nizations that contributed to im
proved conduct on campus.
"It is my opinion that factors which
may be impacting a drop in the num
ber of OCB cases this year include
more actively engaged student orga
ni/ation leaders taking responsibility
for the education of then members
and holding theii members account
able for their individual actions." He
said. " There has been increased dia
logue and a renewed commitment on
everyone's part to address health and
safety issues."

Due to the recent deaths of frater
nity pledges at California State Uni
versity-Chico and the University of
Colorado, many Stanford fraternities
are facing pressure from their nation
al organizations to he careful.
"From our fraternity's national of
fice we are getting a clear anti-hazing
and pro-risk-management message
that is always keeping this issue in the
front of our mind," Gilmer said.
The decline in conduct violations
might also he attributed to heightened
awareness of University rules. For in
stance, the text of the University haz
ing policy was included in this year's
Course Bulletin.
TriDelt's alcohol suspension case
will he reviewed next quarter hy
Boardman, who could potentially
shorten the suspension period.
This could be the first year that no
fraternity or sorority is placed on
housing probation since the discipli
nary measure's inception three years
ago.
"We have hud only minor housing
issues this year," Howe said. "This is a
new review process. So as people begin
to understand the new standards, there
is positive improvement in meeting the
wide range of expectations."
It remains uncertain whether the
lack of major infractions of University
policy will be sustained with one quar

ter left to go.
"In the spring, Greek organiza
tions bring in new members that don't
understand what it means to be Greek
at Stanford and may have different ex
pectations," Greenwell said, adding
that he was confident that the current
state of affairs will persist.
However. Gilmer said he is not as
optimistic.
"Truthfully, 1 think this is a lucky
year and the entire community should
be thankful that no life-safety issues
have come up at fraternities or sorori
ties," he said. "Nationally, it has been
a miserable year and 1 am glad our
Greek community has been more re
sponsible than many of the chapters
around the country."
Graves said he was less concerned
about Greek organizations than the
approximately 87 percent of student
groups on campus that are not as
closely supervised — especially club
sports teams and house management
groups. He said he predicts that the
majority of future OCB cases will in
volve these groups.
"These are social organizations
that don't come into the OSA except
to register," Graves said. "The Greek
community is showing marvelous re
sults but I am cautious about what the
future holds with regard to non-
Greek organizations."

groups. He said he predicts that the
majority of future OCB cases will in
volve these groups.
"These are social organizations
that don't come into the OSA except
to register," Graves said. "The Greek
community is showing marvelous re
sults but I am cautious about what the
future holds with regard to non-
Greek organizations."
After several fraternities and sororities
violated University conduct policies last
year, the Office of Student Activities, or
OSA, took action to increase communica
tion between administrators and Greek or
ganization leaders and to improve training
for these students. Given this year's lack of
incidents, these efforts seem to have paid off.
That no fraternities are on alcohol sus
pension or housing probation, seems to indi
cate that improvements have been made in
how such conduct issues are managed, espe
cially in comparison to the last two years,
during which several Greek organizations
faced hearings for alleged incidents of sexu
al assault and hazing.
While last year there were seven Judicial
Affairs hearings with Greek groups, this
year there have only been two heard by the
Organizational Conduct Board, or OCB,
which processes violations of University
policy committed by student groups.
Both cases involved incidents that oc-

curred last year and there are no pending
cases.
Two events last year had a major impact
on the Greek community: a Sigma Alpha
Epsilon pledge being sent to the hospital,
and Delta Delta Delta pledges participating
in a binge-drinking game with members of
the Stanford football team. TriDelt is on al
cohol suspension until June.
Both of these cases involved allegations
of hazing and consumption of alcohol by mi
nors. The latter incident also involved alle
gations of sexual assault.
Nanci Howe, associate dean of students
and director of student activities, and Joey
Greenwell, fraternity advisor and assistant
director of student activities, stressed that
the 2002-2003 academic year was an "anom
aly" and that the lack of major disciplinary
action this year is not unusual.
"In recent memory, this year is more simi
lar to past years," Howe said. "There were an
unfortunate set of circumstances all coming
that same year. It was not indicative."
Even so. OSA took note of the incidents
and moved to remedy the situation by
requiring more individual meetings
with Greek chapter leaders and a
reevaluation of training sessions for
these students.
Although there have been minor
incidents this year, the chapters han
dled them very well internally said
Morris Graves, associate dean of stu
dents.
"They didn't intend to violate Uni
versity policy and they made a good
faith effort to correct their actions," he
said. "There were no egregious inci
dents that threatened the health and
safety of the Stanford community."
Fraternities are also making a
greater effort to follow University
guidelines in planning parties and
events, student chapter officers
said.
"Ciiven the alcohol probations of
the past years, I think most Greek or
ganizations are being more cautious
with open social functions," said senior
Graham Gilmer, former president of
Sigma Chi. "Fraternities have realized
that there are several sensitive periods
throughout the year — i.e. New Stu

dent Orientation and Admit Weekend
— during which they absolutely must
adhere to University policy or face se
rious ci >n sequences.
Former Kappa Sigma president
Michael Albanese, a senior, attrib
uted the absence of alcohol sanctions
on campus to concerted efforts made
by fraternities to improve party secu
rity and ensure legal alcohol con
sumption.
"The use of third-party security is
on the increase for most Greek hous
es," Albanese said. "This year we are
taking extra measures to make sure
that no [underage drinking| violations
take place a! all. These measures in
clude using hired security as IDcheck
ers and bartenders."
Dean ol Students (ireg Boardman
lauded the leadership of Greek orga
nizations that contributed to im
proved conduct on campus.
"It is my opinion that factors which
may be impacting a drop in the num
ber of OCB cases this year include
more actively engaged student orga
ni/ation leaders taking responsibility
for the education of then members
and holding theii members account
able for their individual actions." He
said. " There has been increased dia
logue and a renewed commitment on
everyone's part to address health and
safety issues."

Due to the recent deaths of frater
nity pledges at California State Uni
versity-Chico and the University of
Colorado, many Stanford fraternities
are facing pressure from their nation
al organizations to he careful.
"From our fraternity's national of
fice we are getting a clear anti-hazing
and pro-risk-management message
that is always keeping this issue in the
front of our mind," Gilmer said.
The decline in conduct violations
might also he attributed to heightened
awareness of University rules. For in
stance, the text of the University haz
ing policy was included in this year's
Course Bulletin.
TriDelt's alcohol suspension case
will he reviewed next quarter hy
Boardman, who could potentially
shorten the suspension period.
This could be the first year that no
fraternity or sorority is placed on
housing probation since the discipli
nary measure's inception three years
ago.
"We have hud only minor housing
issues this year," Howe said. "This is a
new review process. So as people begin
to understand the new standards, there
is positive improvement in meeting the
wide range of expectations."
It remains uncertain whether the
lack of major infractions of University
policy will be sustained with one quar

ter left to go.
"In the spring, Greek organiza
tions bring in new members that don't
understand what it means to be Greek
at Stanford and may have different ex
pectations," Greenwell said, adding
that he was confident that the current
state of affairs will persist.
However. Gilmer said he is not as
optimistic.
"Truthfully, 1 think this is a lucky
year and the entire community should
be thankful that no life-safety issues
have come up at fraternities or sorori
ties," he said. "Nationally, it has been
a miserable year and 1 am glad our
Greek community has been more re
sponsible than many of the chapters
around the country."
Graves said he was less concerned
about Greek organizations than the
approximately 87 percent of student
groups on campus that are not as
closely supervised — especially club
sports teams and house management
groups. He said he predicts that the
majority of future OCB cases will in
volve these groups.
"These are social organizations
that don't come into the OSA except
