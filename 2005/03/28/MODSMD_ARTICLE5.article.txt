"Mystique? What number is
she?"
Mystique is, of course, not a
player. It is the Connecticut
women's basketball team that has
dominated the sport for the last
three years. That phrase — which
decorated signs taped to Stanford
players' hotel room doors in Kansas
City, Mo. — was supposed to re
mind Cardinal players to look past
the "mystique" of the three-time
defending national champions.
And last night, Stanford did just
that as it held the Huskies to a 32.4
shooting percentage on its way to a
76-59 victory.

"[Connecticut] is not a national
championship team without a
Diana Taurasi — they've struggled
this year," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "I didn't feel like we
were playing against a ghost team."
At Saturday's press conference,
Connecticut head coach Geno Au
riemma commented that the
NCAA regional semi-final and
final were traditionally the most
dangerous games en route to the
national championship. On Sun
day, that was an understatement as
the No. 1 team in the polls clashed
with the defending national cham
pions for just the second time in
Tournament history.
