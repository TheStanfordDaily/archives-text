# No. 1 Stanford is simply 'elite'

"Mystique? What number is
she?"
Mystique is, of course, not a
player. It is the Connecticut
women's basketball team that has
dominated the sport for the last
three years. That phrase — which
decorated signs taped to Stanford
players' hotel room doors in Kansas
City, Mo. — was supposed to re
mind Cardinal players to look past
the "mystique" of the three-time
defending national champions.
And last night, Stanford did just
that as it held the Huskies to a 32.4
shooting percentage on its way to a
76-59 victory.

"[Connecticut] is not a national
championship team without a
Diana Taurasi — they've struggled
this year," head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said. "I didn't feel like we
were playing against a ghost team."
At Saturday's press conference,
Connecticut head coach Geno Au
riemma commented that the
NCAA regional semi-final and
final were traditionally the most
dangerous games en route to the
national championship. On Sun
day, that was an understatement as
the No. 1 team in the polls clashed
with the defending national cham
pions for just the second time in
Tournament history.


LINDSAY COLEMAN/The Stanford Daily
Freshman star Candice Wiggins started slow,but caught fire late to help
Stanford to a 76-59 win over the Connecticut Huskies.
Women to face No.l Michigan

It was the first time Stanford and
Connecticut have faced off since 1997,
and Stanford's victory snapped a two
game losing streak against the Huskies.
Alter demonstrating poise beyond
her years during both the regular and
post-season. Candice Wiggins. Nation
al Co-Freshman of the Year, appeared
rushed in the early minutes last night.
Despite playing nearly the entire first
half, she managed just six points, while
turning the ball over five times.
"It was a little frustrating, just be
cause I wasgettinga little rushed and that
led to turnovers," Wiggins said. "Every
one just got together and said "Let's take
care of the ball and play our game.'"
In the second half, Wiggins shot 11-
of-12 from the free throw line to ice the
game and lead the team in scoring with
21 points.
On offense, the well-oiled machine
that has made Stanford the seventh
highest scoring team in the nation found
itself in a first-half scuffle with the
Huskies. Sophomore Brooke Smith,
whose 61.2 shooting percentage was
eighth-best in the nation this year, found
space in the paint hard to come by.
The Huskies worked diligently to
deny Stanford's entry passes to the post
in the first half. When Smith did get the
ball down low, defensive help came
quickly and decisively, producing a pair
of blocked shots and a pair of
turnovers.
"They're just a really physical
team." Smith said. "They were dou
bling well and stuff, and at halftime
coach wanted us to battle back."
Perhaps the biggest surprise of the
first half, however, was the success of
the Connecticut full court press, which
generated several turnovers and led to
six of the Huskies' points in the first
half. Pressing after made baskets, Con
necticut was able to force the ball into
the hands of Smith and sophomore
center Kristen Newlin in the back
court.
The Husky offense, while unspec
tacular to say the least, was aided by
seven first-half steals and 10 total Stan
ford turnovers before halftime.
Though Connecticut trailed much of
the first stanza, they successfully turned
the game into a slugfest at Stanford's
offensive end and a track meet at their
own. Junior forward Barbara Turner
led the Huskies in scoring with 17
points on the night.
Connecticut headed into the locker
room leading 33-27; it was only the sec
ond time this year the Cardinal has

trailed at halftime. Their other halftime
deficit - 27-32 against Southern Cali
fornia in the Pacific-10 Conference
Tournament - turned into a 73-69
Stanford victory.
In the second half, VanDerveer's
team played for its post-season life.
A six-nothing run to start the half
pulled the Cardinal even, and then a
iunny thing happened - a Stanford
team that went 31-2 to this point decid
ed that 31-3 just wasn't acceptable.
"We decided we didn't want to go
home, we didn't want to be done," se
nior Susan King Borchardt said. "We
just love playing together. We had a
great game plan for this game, and we
just needed to execute it."
Forty-nine points in the second half,
keyed by three Borchardt baskets from
beyond the arc, left Connecticut's
struggling offense unable to catch up.
On the night, Borchardt scored 16
points, including a season-high-tying
four three-point buckets.
After shooting a meager 36.7 per
cent from the field and one-of-eight
from three-point range before half
time, the Cardinal saw the basket swell
along with their confidence in the sec
ond half.
57.7 percent shooting and six-of
nine from beyond the arc put the pres
sure back on the Huskies' offense to
trade baskets.
"1 said. 'We run the triangle offense
- we have to go inside in order for this
offense to work.'" VanDerveersaid. "1
really think it was Brooke - just getting
the ball to Brooke, and then she would
go to the basket, and that created things
for other people."
With Stanford's offense clicking,
the silence from Connecticut's leading
scorer, junior guard Ann Strother, was
defeaning. Averaging 13.2 points per
game on the year, Strother was held to
just four points under Borchardt's sti
fling defense.
"|Borchardt] guraded Ann
Strother and just battled her," Van-
Derveer said. "Ann's a great player
and Susan was really determined. She
sets the tone for as defensively, and she
did a great job."
With their victory, the Cardinal will
take on No. 1 seed Michigan State on
Tuesday, who defeated No. 5 Vander
bilt on Sunday night, 76-64.
"We didn't come here to just to win
one game, we came to win two," Bor
chardt said. "That's our big focus now,
and hopefully we'll be celebrating in a
couple days as well."
