The Economics Department is
awaiting responses to seven offers re
cently extended to potential new fac
ulty members.
"Since our goal is to be the best
Economics Department in the world,
the offers are to a mix of senior peo
ple of the first rank and junior people
we think are potential future stars,"
said Tim Bresnahan. chair of the Eco
nomics Department.
Jonathan Levin, a professor of
economics who served on the search
committee for junior faculty appoint
ments, said, "We've made offers to
some outstanding people, including a
woman at Harvard who is a leading
education scholar and a terrific young
public economist from Berkeley. If
we're able to convince a few of them
to come, it would be great in terms
building on and broadening the cur
rent strengths of the department."

It's rumored that the "leading ed
ucation scholar" is economist Caro
line Hoxby. On March 2, The Har
vard Crimson ran an editorial enti
tled "Sweet Caroline" persuading
Hoxby to remain in Cambridge, de
spite the pleasant weather in Palo
Alto. Hoxby is described in the article
as "one of the world's foremost ex
perts on the economics of education."
In addition to listing her many profes
sional accomplishments, the editorial
emphasized that Hoxby has one of
the highest professor ratings â€”38
percent of her students believe her to
be the best professor they had during
their academic careers.
"I think the goal is to recruit facul
ty who are both making major re
search contributions to economics
and who will be actively engaged in
the intellectual community so that
students and faculty will have the op
portunity to learn from them," Levin
said.
