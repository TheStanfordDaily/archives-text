# Stanford courts Harvard economist
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Economics Department is
awaiting responses to seven offers re
cently extended to potential new fac
ulty members.
"Since our goal is to be the best
Economics Department in the world,
the offers are to a mix of senior peo
ple of the first rank and junior people
we think are potential future stars,"
said Tim Bresnahan. chair of the Eco
nomics Department.
Jonathan Levin, a professor of
economics who served on the search
committee for junior faculty appoint
ments, said, "We've made offers to
some outstanding people, including a
woman at Harvard who is a leading
education scholar and a terrific young
public economist from Berkeley. If
we're able to convince a few of them
to come, it would be great in terms
building on and broadening the cur
rent strengths of the department."

It's rumored that the "leading ed
ucation scholar" is economist Caro
line Hoxby. On March 2, The Har
vard Crimson ran an editorial enti
tled "Sweet Caroline" persuading
Hoxby to remain in Cambridge, de
spite the pleasant weather in Palo
Alto. Hoxby is described in the article
as "one of the world's foremost ex
perts on the economics of education."
In addition to listing her many profes
sional accomplishments, the editorial
emphasized that Hoxby has one of
the highest professor ratings —38
percent of her students believe her to
be the best professor they had during
their academic careers.
"I think the goal is to recruit facul
ty who are both making major re
search contributions to economics
and who will be actively engaged in
the intellectual community so that
students and faculty will have the op
portunity to learn from them," Levin
said.

Harvard Economics Prof. Caroline Hoxby, one of the most
popular teachers, is likely one of seven professors to be of
fered positions in the Stanford Economics Department.
Bresnahan said that since eco
nomics is a large department at
Stanford, recruiting efforts are on
going. According to the Economics
Department Web site, there are
currently 49 faculty members, in
cluding 10 emeriti faculty. Peter
Hansen, whose research interests
include econometrics and forecast
ing, was the department's only new
arrival for the 2004-2005 academic
year.
"1 believe that there have been at
least a few outstanding offers at this
time of year at every point in the last
few decades," Bresnahan said. "The
amount of effort spent on recruit
ment ebbs and flows with retire
ments and resignations."
He described the faculty recruit
ing process as "extensive and care
ful." The Economics Department ex
amines candidates' teaching abilities
as well as research capabilities and
accomplishments.
"We are looking for the best peo
ple and put a suitable amount of en
ergy into convincing ourselves and
the University that we have found
them," Bresnahan added. "On the
candidates' side, it involves visits to
Stanford to see what it is like to teach
and research here. Candidates with
families often look at housing,
schools and other criteria. This is the
fun part of recruiting, selling people
on Stanford's atmosphere, students,
commitment to excellence and living
environment."
Students are also involved in the
recruiting process and help to attract
top faculty.
"Our typical recruiting seminar
has approximately an even mix of
faculty and students in the audi
ence," Bresnahan said.
Levin said, "When it comes to re
cruiting, certainly one attraction of
the department is that faculty get to
teach incredibly talented students at
both the undergraduate and gradu
ate level."
In a typical year, the Economics
Department has approximately 200
graduates, Bresnahan said. Around
1,500 students are enrolled in eco
nomics undergraduate courses each
quarter. In addition, around 20 stu
dents are enrolled in graduate-level
courses.

education scholar and a terrific young
public economist from Berkeley. If
we're able to convince a few of them
to come, it would be great in terms
building on and broadening the cur
rent strengths of the department."

It's rumored that the "leading ed
ucation scholar" is economist Caro
line Hoxby. On March 2, The Har
vard Crimson ran an editorial enti
tled "Sweet Caroline" persuading
Hoxby to remain in Cambridge, de
spite the pleasant weather in Palo
Alto. Hoxby is described in the article
as "one of the world's foremost ex
perts on the economics of education."
In addition to listing her many profes
sional accomplishments, the editorial
emphasized that Hoxby has one of
the highest professor ratings —38
percent of her students believe her to
be the best professor they had during
their academic careers.
"I think the goal is to recruit facul
ty who are both making major re
search contributions to economics
and who will be actively engaged in
the intellectual community so that
students and faculty will have the op
portunity to learn from them," Levin
said.

Harvard Economics Prof. Caroline Hoxby, one of the most
popular teachers, is likely one of seven professors to be of
fered positions in the Stanford Economics Department.
Bresnahan said that since eco
nomics is a large department at
Stanford, recruiting efforts are on
going. According to the Economics
Department Web site, there are
currently 49 faculty members, in
cluding 10 emeriti faculty. Peter
Hansen, whose research interests
include econometrics and forecast
ing, was the department's only new
arrival for the 2004-2005 academic
year.
"1 believe that there have been at
least a few outstanding offers at this
time of year at every point in the last
few decades," Bresnahan said. "The
amount of effort spent on recruit
ment ebbs and flows with retire
ments and resignations."
He described the faculty recruit
ing process as "extensive and care
ful." The Economics Department ex
amines candidates' teaching abilities
as well as research capabilities and
accomplishments.
"We are looking for the best peo
ple and put a suitable amount of en
ergy into convincing ourselves and
the University that we have found
them," Bresnahan added. "On the
candidates' side, it involves visits to
Stanford to see what it is like to teach
and research here. Candidates with
families often look at housing,
schools and other criteria. This is the
fun part of recruiting, selling people
on Stanford's atmosphere, students,
commitment to excellence and living
environment."
Students are also involved in the
recruiting process and help to attract
top faculty.
"Our typical recruiting seminar
has approximately an even mix of
faculty and students in the audi
ence," Bresnahan said.
Levin said, "When it comes to re
cruiting, certainly one attraction of
the department is that faculty get to
teach incredibly talented students at
both the undergraduate and gradu
ate level."
In a typical year, the Economics
Department has approximately 200
graduates, Bresnahan said. Around
1,500 students are enrolled in eco
nomics undergraduate courses each
quarter. In addition, around 20 stu
dents are enrolled in graduate-level
courses.
