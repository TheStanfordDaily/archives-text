# Students, int'l NGOs discuss tsunami relief
## 
### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
Students from Stanford and four other American
universities participated in a live videoconference
with representatives from several non-governmental
organizations, or NGOs, in Sri Lanka last night. The
dialogue focused on the relief and reconstruction ef
forts taking place there, one of the nations hardest-hit
bv the South Asian earthquake and tsunami last Dec.
26.
The videoconference took place only hours after
another powerful earthquake — jolting the seabed off
the west coast of Indonesia — killed at least 300 peo
ple and sent a ripple of panic across a region still dev
astated by the deadly catastrophe three months ago.
Gathering in a distance-learning center equipped
with a videoconference system in the capital city of
Colombo, the Sri Lankan participants agreed that
their country, where almost 31,000 people died in the
disaster and 555,000 people now live without shelters,
requires tremendous financial and human resources to
rebuild even the most basic necessities.

"Sixty-five thousand houses need to be rebuilt
within the next year or two," said one of the NGO rep
resentatives in Sri Lanka. "Before the tsunami, we
normally built only 5,000 houses every year. There's a
strong need for engineers and other technicians."
He added that more manpower is needed to both
rebuild the country and regenerate resources.
An environmental scientist in attendance ex
plained that, unless houses are quickly assembled, epi
demics and heightened crime rates could threaten
refugee camps in affected regions.
"When people are desperate, when they lose every
thing overnight, they might resort to committing
crimes," he said. "The crime rate hasn't increased sig
nificantly yet. but it's possible that it'll continue to
rise."
Some participants in the teleconference noted that
while the reconstruction of physical facilities demands
tremendous resources, the real problem confronting
Sri Lanka is not how to acquire more money — dona
tions worth some $1 billion have already been pledged
— but rather how to manage the
money. The international commu
nity, they said, should take this op
portunity to help the Sri Lankan
society enhance its civic capacity
and reduce the corruption that has
been so prevalent in the country's
political culture.
"It's not just aboul building houses,
it's more about building homes," an
NGO representative said. "When we
rebuild a village, we want new houses,
but we also want a new way of orga
nizing power politics in the village."
In response to a question raised
by a student about how the Indone
sian earthquake a few hours earlier
tested the tsunami warning system
in Sri Lanka and elsewhere, the
conferees said they were opti

mistic.
"The warning system went into
effect last night," said one of the
participants. "The government,
the armed forces and the police
acted very, very swiftly. The evacu
ation took place orderly and calm
ly. It demonstrates the power of
communication — a two-and-a
half-hour prior warning could
avert a large number of deaths."
Last night's event was orga
nized by the Americans for In
formed Democracy, or AID, a
global student organization, and
the Roosevelt Institution, the stu
dent think tank. The other univer
sities that took part in the video
conference included San Francisco
State. St. Mary's. Rice and Berke
ley.
Quincy Tanner, a freshman who
attended last night's event, said the
discussion afforded him a new per
spective on what people can do to
assist in the relief efforts.

"We always ask if our donation
is going to the right people or being
used properly," Tanner said. "But
no one ever asks what objectives
we have for the lives of those af
fected by the disaster and how we
should allocate the money to
achieve those objectives."
Veronica Canton of the San
Francisco State University chapter
of AID said she hoped that relief
efforts in tsunami-affected coun
tries would continue to have a
"human face."
"The impact of the tsunami was
immediately viewed worldwide,"
Canton said. "However, we must
not forget that reconstruction ef
forts will take time, money and
personal commitment. These con
ferences give our communities a
personal connection with young
people around the world in dealing
with problems collectively, not as
individual nations but as part of
the global community."
