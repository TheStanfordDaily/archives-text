# Students, int'l NGOs discuss tsunami relief
## 
### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
Students from Stanford and four other American
universities participated in a live videoconference
with representatives from several non-governmental
organizations, or NGOs, in Sri Lanka last night. The
dialogue focused on the relief and reconstruction ef
forts taking place there, one of the nations hardest-hit
bv the South Asian earthquake and tsunami last Dec.
26.
The videoconference took place only hours after
another powerful earthquake — jolting the seabed off
the west coast of Indonesia — killed at least 300 peo
ple and sent a ripple of panic across a region still dev
astated by the deadly catastrophe three months ago.
Gathering in a distance-learning center equipped
with a videoconference system in the capital city of
Colombo, the Sri Lankan participants agreed that
their country, where almost 31,000 people died in the
disaster and 555,000 people now live without shelters,
requires tremendous financial and human resources to
rebuild even the most basic necessities.

"Sixty-five thousand houses need to be rebuilt
within the next year or two," said one of the NGO rep
resentatives in Sri Lanka. "Before the tsunami, we
normally built only 5,000 houses every year. There's a
strong need for engineers and other technicians."
He added that more manpower is needed to both
rebuild the country and regenerate resources.
An environmental scientist in attendance ex
plained that, unless houses are quickly assembled, epi
demics and heightened crime rates could threaten
refugee camps in affected regions.
"When people are desperate, when they lose every
thing overnight, they might resort to committing
crimes," he said. "The crime rate hasn't increased sig
nificantly yet. but it's possible that it'll continue to
rise."
Some participants in the teleconference noted that
while the reconstruction of physical facilities demands
tremendous resources, the real problem confronting
Sri Lanka is not how to acquire more money — dona
tions worth some $1 billion have already been pledged
