When freshman Mozziyar
Etemadi decided to work for Air-
Logic, a wireless Internet company
his friends started in high school, he
was not expecting to soothe dissatis
fied customers, haggle with manu
facturers or climb a radio tower in 8-
degree, 40-miles-per-hour-wind
weather to fix the network when it
went down. But this was all in a day's
work.
"Entrepreneurs must be jacks-of
all-trades," Etemadi said. "1 cannot
stress that enough. I followed no
flowchart of things to do â€” it was all
by instinct."
That is exactly what Edward
Lazear, professor of human re
sources management and economics
at the Graduate School of Business,
found in a 1997 survey of former
Stanford business students that have
started their own companies.
Lazear, also the founding editor

of The Journal of Labor Economics,
sent out 12.CHX) questionnaires re
garding entrepreneurial experience
to business alumni. About 43 per
cent responded.
The survey allowed Lazear to test
the correlations between gender,
ethnicity, age and experience and
entrepreneurship. The one factor
that stood out was the number of
jobs respondents had held before
starting their own companies.
Lazear reported that the overall
probability of business graduates
founding companies at some point
during their careers was about 25
percent. However, he found that
fewer than 7 percent actually be
came entrepreneurs.
The probability of becoming an
entrepreneur rose 2.26 percent for
every additional job individuals had
held during their careers. Those with
fewer than three different jobs had
only about a 1 percent chance of
starting their own business, hut
those with more than 16 jobs had a
30 percent chance.
"If you perform different roles,
you pick up different skills and that
makes you multidimensional,"
Lazear told the Stanford News Ser
vice. But he stressed that this does
not mean that aspiring entrepre
neurs should hop from job to job.
The survey found that the length of
job tenure was positively correlated
with entrepreneurship.
Lazear said that even when en
trepreneurs go into business as part
of a team, with members fulfilling
distinctly different roles, they each
still need enough knowledge of vari
ous areas to choose other partners.
Etemadi agreed with Lazear.
"All of us basically did every
thing," he said referring to his expe
rience at Air Logic. "There were no
real 'roles.'"
Many people are wrong in as
suming that entrepreneurs must be
creatively blessed to start a business
from scratch, Lazear stressed.
"For the most part, they are busi
ness innovators," he said. "The in
novation may be as seemingly minor
as recognizing that a particular
street corner would be a good loca
tion fora dry cleaner."
Etemadi said he enjoyed working
with his friends but does not plan to
pursue a career in business after he
graduates.
"Eventually the fun stops," he
said. "Pleasing the customer be
comes a waste of time. 1 want to be a
professor or researcher so 1 can al
ways have the 'fun' of learning new
things with the minimum amount of
"polities' possible."
