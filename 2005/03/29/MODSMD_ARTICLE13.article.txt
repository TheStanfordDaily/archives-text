On March 29,1927, The Daily ran
an article about a German admiral
who praised Stanford's location dur
ing a visit to campus. Below is an ex
cerpt:
" 'Stanford stands out in my mind
from all other American universities
because of its singular location,' said
Admiral Paul Behncke, retired, of the
German navy, when he visited the
campus, its situation away from the
city, yet in close contact with the me
tropolis, should give its students
unique and envious advantages.'
"Restriction on enrollment was
particularly praised by Admiral
Behncke, who is touring the United
States in a purely private capacity.
Organizations and work of the uni
versities and modern developments
of industry, transportation and fi
nance have engaged his attention on
this trip. The Hoover War Library,
the aerodynamics laboratory, the sta
dium and the dormitory system made
a distinct impression upon the admi
ral."
On March 29,1971, The Daily cov
ered a story about the buildup of lethal
weapons by rebellious Stanford stu
dents, as reported by the Santa Clara
sheriff. Below is an excerpt:
"The Santa Clara County sheriff
defended the expenditure of over
$20,(KX) for campus riot and crowd
control between January 28 and Feb

ruary 12 because of an alleged build
up of a massive weapons arsenal by
militant Stanford students.
"Sheriff James Geary said that the
arsenal, which is either in a cache or
spread around the campus, consists of
hand grenades, semi-automatic
weapons, a sniper rifle, thousands of
rounds of ammunition and possibly
machine guns.
"Geary termed the arms build-up
as hazardous to Santa Clara deputies
and told the supervisors that instead
of being short-handed in a critical sit
uation. he was going to send enough
men to Stanford riots and incidents to
"dominate the situation.'
"Geary explained that the
weapons are purchased at gun shows
and that although a handful of gun
salesmen have been arrested in the
past few weeks, many firearms have
simply not been accounted for. He
also disclosed that a number of peo
ple identified as students have also
attempted to purchase conversion
kits.
"The only official University re
sponse to Geary's revelation came
from Associate Provost Robert
Rosenzweig who said:
" 'The University is, of course,
deeply concerned about the reported
presence in the area of large quanti
ties of lethal weapons." "
