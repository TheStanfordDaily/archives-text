## Journeys to the next Internet watering hole 
### DANIEL BERDICHEVSKY 
Where am I writing this column?
I could be writing it longhand in a note
book overlooking sometimes-full Lake
Lagunita. But let's assume fora moment
that I'm on a laptop computer and that I
require high-speed Internet access to re
search and procrastinate effectively.
I could be at a coffee shop. A lot of
people work in coffee shops nowadays;
Starbucks reinvented itself as a place to
check your e-mail when it introduced T-
Mobile wireless hotspots two years ago,
and many smaller competitors followed
suit. Even McDonald's is adding wireless
Internet access to all of its restaurants,
with the frightening slogan "Bites or
Bytes - We Do Both!"
Or, I could be inside an "eggshell," but
this would require that I be Hying Japan
Airlines in its new egg-shaped business
class seat - redesigned for privacy and
comfort, and the ideal way to avoid "sin
gle-serving friends." Several other airlines
including Lufthansa are introducing wire
less Internet access in the sky. More com
panies would have done so earlier, but the
original venture by Boeing, called Con
nexion, lost steam after Sept. 11. (So did
the Concorde, which should have checked
with al Oaeda for scheduling conflicts be
fore holding a public demonstration of its
safe return to flight that same September
morning.)
I could be at FedEx Kinko's. Kinko's
certainly wants me to be at Kinko's — it
claims to be "your office away from the of
fice," with no bites required. But frankly,
Kinko's is too much like an office, and not
a particularly nice office, for me to want to
spend any extra time there (though I did
shave at a Kinko's once — never again).
I could be tucked away in a back alley
leeching free Internet from an unencrypt
ed source. But this means finding the right
alley, which is too time-consuming to be
worth it, unless you have one of those
hotspot-tracking devices on clearance at
Fry's.
I could be writing in class while my pro
fessor lectures. This is hard in smaller
classrooms, but I know at least one person
who uses a tablet PC to quietly check e
mail without clicking any keys.
I could be at a municipal park with
wireless Internet, like the JFK Park in
Cambridge. But when it's sunny, I can't
see my screen; and during this time of
year, when it's not sunny in Cambridge,
it's cold.
I could be at a random motel in west
ern Wisconsin. I'm not, but I did finish a
take-home final at one in January. The
proprietor was very gracious when I
charged into his lobby claiming my paper
was an hour overdue; he set me up with a
table and a king-sized Snickers bar.
I could be in Half Moon Bay. Like
more and more small cities, from Athens
to Corpus Christi. Half Moon Bay pro
vides public wireless access anywhere in
its downtown area. You can still get a latte
with your e-mail at La Di Da Coffee Shop
— but now you can take both to go.
Or, I could be at the mall: Not just at a
cafe in any wireless-enabled mall (there
are lots), but at the Internet Home Al
liance's experimental "Connection
Court"in the Willow Bend Shops in
Piano, Texas. Unlike the cubicles at
Kinko's, these are plush waiting areas,
featuring plasma TVs, Aeron chairs, cher
ry oak desks — and yes, easy access to the
food court. Laptops are even available in
case you left yours in the car.
Or, I could just be at home or in Tresid
der Union. These are both difficult for me,
however, as I don't really live anywhere in
particular, and I haven't been on campus
since February.
So — where am I? Here's the answer: I
started this column yesterday in a Boston
bookstore cafe. Then I spilled green tea
on my laptop. It kept working for about a
minute, long enough for me to e-mail my
self a few files — including a thesis that I
was about three hours from presenting —
before it sizzled fragrantly to a halt.
Afterwards I relocated to Harvard's
harshly — lit computer cluster for the
night. Around eleven o'clock, I decided to
get a drink. The vending machine only
took my dollar bill after a half-dozen tries,
and when at last I pressed the Sprite but
ton, it clanged, and then gave me a Coke.
This reminds me why I avoid computer
clusters (and vending machines, which —
speaking of innovation — really ought to
accept Paypal or at least credit card.) For
tunately, today my backup laptop arrived,
and proving that it takes a lot to change a
bad habit. I'm at another cafe drinking tea
again.

Daniel has a unique relationship with com
puters; fortunately they don't always stay
broken. If his computer is working, you can

mail without clicking any keys.
I could be at a municipal park with
wireless Internet, like the JFK Park in
Cambridge. But when it's sunny, I can't
see my screen; and during this time of
year, when it's not sunny in Cambridge,
it's cold.
I could be at a random motel in west
ern Wisconsin. I'm not, but I did finish a
take-home final at one in January. The
proprietor was very gracious when I
charged into his lobby claiming my paper
was an hour overdue; he set me up with a
table and a king-sized Snickers bar.
I could be in Half Moon Bay. Like
more and more small cities, from Athens
to Corpus Christi. Half Moon Bay pro
vides public wireless access anywhere in
its downtown area. You can still get a latte
with your e-mail at La Di Da Coffee Shop
— but now you can take both to go.
Or, I could be at the mall: Not just at a
cafe in any wireless-enabled mall (there
are lots), but at the Internet Home Al
liance's experimental "Connection
Court"in the Willow Bend Shops in
Piano, Texas. Unlike the cubicles at
Kinko's, these are plush waiting areas,
featuring plasma TVs, Aeron chairs, cher
ry oak desks — and yes, easy access to the
food court. Laptops are even available in
case you left yours in the car.
Or, I could just be at home or in Tresid
der Union. These are both difficult for me,
however, as I don't really live anywhere in
particular, and I haven't been on campus
since February.
So — where am I? Here's the answer: I
started this column yesterday in a Boston
bookstore cafe. Then I spilled green tea
on my laptop. It kept working for about a
minute, long enough for me to e-mail my
self a few files — including a thesis that I
was about three hours from presenting —
before it sizzled fragrantly to a halt.
Afterwards I relocated to Harvard's
harshly — lit computer cluster for the
night. Around eleven o'clock, I decided to
get a drink. The vending machine only
took my dollar bill after a half-dozen tries,
and when at last I pressed the Sprite but
ton, it clanged, and then gave me a Coke.
This reminds me why I avoid computer
clusters (and vending machines, which —
speaking of innovation — really ought to
accept Paypal or at least credit card.) For
tunately, today my backup laptop arrived,
and proving that it takes a lot to change a
bad habit. I'm at another cafe drinking tea
again.

Where am I writing this column?
I could be writing it longhand in a note
book overlooking sometimes-full Lake
Lagunita. But let's assume fora moment
that I'm on a laptop computer and that I
require high-speed Internet access to re
search and procrastinate effectively.
I could be at a coffee shop. A lot of
people work in coffee shops nowadays;
Starbucks reinvented itself as a place to
check your e-mail when it introduced T-
Mobile wireless hotspots two years ago,
and many smaller competitors followed
suit. Even McDonald's is adding wireless
Internet access to all of its restaurants,
with the frightening slogan "Bites or
Bytes - We Do Both!"
Or, I could be inside an "eggshell," but
this would require that I be Hying Japan
Airlines in its new egg-shaped business
class seat - redesigned for privacy and
comfort, and the ideal way to avoid "sin
gle-serving friends." Several other airlines
including Lufthansa are introducing wire
less Internet access in the sky. More com
panies would have done so earlier, but the
original venture by Boeing, called Con
nexion, lost steam after Sept. 11. (So did
the Concorde, which should have checked
with al Oaeda for scheduling conflicts be
fore holding a public demonstration of its
safe return to flight that same September
morning.)
I could be at FedEx Kinko's. Kinko's
certainly wants me to be at Kinko's — it
claims to be "your office away from the of
fice," with no bites required. But frankly,
Kinko's is too much like an office, and not
a particularly nice office, for me to want to
spend any extra time there (though I did
shave at a Kinko's once — never again).
I could be tucked away in a back alley
leeching free Internet from an unencrypt
ed source. But this means finding the right
alley, which is too time-consuming to be
worth it, unless you have one of those
hotspot-tracking devices on clearance at
Fry's.
I could be writing in class while my pro
fessor lectures. This is hard in smaller
classrooms, but I know at least one person
who uses a tablet PC to quietly check e
mail without clicking any keys.
