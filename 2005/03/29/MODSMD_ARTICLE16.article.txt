You listen to the latest podcast from your iPod head
phones (which are permanently glued to your ears) and
you sport the latest, most tech-advanced cell phone. Your
Wi-Fi tablet PC connects you to the Internet wherever you
g°.
But wait, what is that you're riding? A bike?
Oh, come on — that is so last century.
Transportation on campus has varied widely over the
course of Stanford's history. Leland Stanford Jr. rode a
bike, and in the 1970's a leading landscape designer,
Thomas D. Church, sculpted the campus into a peripatetic
paradise.
Today, Stanford is one of the most expansive campuses
in the world, and the pioneering atmosphere and wide bike
paths have set the stage fora variety of options in trans
portation.
Not content with merely pedaling a bike or strutting to
class, some Stanford students are using the latest in inno
vative personal transportation technology. From electric
scooters to Segways, students are considering important
factors such as speed, comfort and price.
Juston Johnson, a junior, was one of the early adopters of
the electric scooter on campus. Johnson paid $250 on eßay
fora scooter that only required infrequent charges and al
lowed him to cruise along at 17 m.p.h. while standing up.
"After freshman year, I went through four cheap bicy
cles," Johnson said. "The pedals would fall off, or I would
bend the frames and the tires. The speed, convenience and
relatively low price of the scooter made it an attractive
choice."
Ironically, it seems that often the most fit on campus are
the ones who choose to use alternative forms of trans
portation.
"I think that innovation is spreading among the athletes
fastest," said Johnson, who is on the wrestling team. "After
wrestling practice, I was too tired to ride my bike uphill."
Junior Gerald Commissiong, a member of the football
team, shares Johnson's sentiment. Commission drives a
$ 1,60() electric golf cart.
"I broke my leg playing football and in the long run it
would have cost me more to rent a golf cart than to buy
one," Commissiong said.
The convenience and comfort of his electric vehicle
make it easier for Commissiong to get to classes and events,
and he can bring friends along for the ride.
"Now that I live off campus, I can drive to school and get
the golf cart and it saves me a lot of money on parking pass
es," added Commissiong.
Another user of innovative transportation on campus
is sophomore Fahad Al-Saud. Al-Saud operates a $4,000
Segway, the first two-wheeled, self-balancing, electric
transportation device to use dynamic stabilization tech
nology. Al-Saud first purchased the vehicle to remedy a
major back problem and now enjoys gliding around at 12
m.p.h. without having to worry about bending his back or
balancing.
"The Segway was something new and something differ
ent that demonstrated my original personality," Al-Saud
said. "It makes life much easier, it cannot be stolen because
it is activated by a magnet and no one can even stand on it
when it is off."
Many companies like Segway are catering to the bur
geoning college market. Stanford's own Alec Stuart re

cently began his own entrepreneurial efforts to cater to this
techie niche. Stuart, a graduate student in Mechanical En
gineering and Management Sciences, markets the E-Glide
Powerboard, an electric skateboard. Stuart's skateboard
can be controlled by a wired or wireless trigger and accel
erates from zero to 21 m.p.h. in four seconds.

"I thought of the idea as a new product to develop and
did some research and found that they were already being
manufactured in China and decided to buy a shipment and
try and sell them on campus," Stuart said. "It feels like you
are snowboarding to class and rides like a normal skate
board except that you are always going down hill."
