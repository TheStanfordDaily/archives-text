# A 						physicist's life-outside of the lab
## 
### SANAM SAABER 
The common perception of physicists is that they,
with their crazy hair and large glasses, spend their
days in dark rooms playing with incredibly complex
machines that toss electrons around. But the life of a
physicist goes far beyond the lab, as evidenced by
Quantum Diaries, a collection of Web logs, or blogs,
that chronicle the lives of physicists.
Launched on Jan. 13, the blogs are a collaboration
by the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, or SLAC,
and the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory,
which is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.
The blogs were created to lift the veil of mystery be
hind the life of a physicist.
How interesting is the life of a physicist? Enough
for thousands of people to click through a Web site
(http://interactions.org/quantumdiaries/physicists/).
During the first month, the blogs received over 45,000
clicks. Some physicists' blogs garner nearly 1,000 vis
its per day.
With such a high interest in the blogs, one might
ask where the motivation came from for the estab
lishment of this international effort. Neil Calder of
SLAC described the beginnings of the
Quantum Diaries as a hope to publicize the
start of "World Year of Physios 2005," an
international celebration of physics, by not
only illuminating the contributions that
physicists make to the scientific communi
ty, but also by highlighting their individual
ity.
"[We] wanted do something global and
international and above all different,"
Calder said.
Calder said many people picture scientists as in
troverted and lacking social lives, when in fact, the
opposite is often true. The idea behind the blogs was
that if physicists shared their lives online, the negative

stereotype associated with the image of a scientist
could be changed.
Therefore the concept of the blog was simple.
Equipped with digital cameras, training in blogging and
Web space, the scientists write daily about science and

details from their personal lives. The result is over 30
personal stories from physicists around the world.
Given this opportunity, what do particle physicists
write about?
Caolionn O'Connell, a 27-year-old Stanford grad
uate student studying plasma wakefield acceleration
at SLAC, decided to share her life online through
Quantum Dairies.
"1 am working on my thesis right now. so my blog
consists of all my frustrations and about how my
boyfriend just got his Ph.D.." O'Connell said.
Although O'Connell's blog is dominated by her
current work, Bryan Dahmes and Jose Ocariz, also
scientists at SLAC, cannot be too candid about their
current work due to intellectual property and securi
ty issues, so they utilize their blogs as "an excuse for
pictures," according to Dahmes.
Dahmes talks about being a member of the Tae
Kwon Do Club at Stanford and how he is a "workout
nut." He said his blog references mostly his personal
life. Ocariz also fills his blog with personal anecdotes.
Of all of the bloggers, Ocariz is the only Quantum Di
arist to write in Spanish, which lets Quantum Diaries
reach a broader international audience.
O'Connell. Dahmes and Ocariz agree that they
want to use the blogs as an avenue for outreach to
show that physics can be fun and that, contrary to the
public's notion of physicists, they too strive fora bal
ance between occupation and the outside world.
"Honestly, this is a little weird," said O'Connell.
"None of our experiences are that unique, and people
have realized that our experiences are the same."
They also wanted to provide a journal for them
selves such that they can remember, years down the
line, what they were doing at this exact moment and
how they were feeling.
All we are doing, said Dahmes, " is writing about
the generic experience of scientists."

"1 am working on my thesis right now. so my blog
consists of all my frustrations and about how my
boyfriend just got his Ph.D.." O'Connell said.
Although O'Connell's blog is dominated by her
current work, Bryan Dahmes and Jose Ocariz, also
scientists at SLAC, cannot be too candid about their
current work due to intellectual property and securi
ty issues, so they utilize their blogs as "an excuse for
pictures," according to Dahmes.
Dahmes talks about being a member of the Tae
Kwon Do Club at Stanford and how he is a "workout
nut." He said his blog references mostly his personal
life. Ocariz also fills his blog with personal anecdotes.
Of all of the bloggers, Ocariz is the only Quantum Di
arist to write in Spanish, which lets Quantum Diaries
reach a broader international audience.
O'Connell. Dahmes and Ocariz agree that they
want to use the blogs as an avenue for outreach to
show that physics can be fun and that, contrary to the
public's notion of physicists, they too strive fora bal
ance between occupation and the outside world.
"Honestly, this is a little weird," said O'Connell.
"None of our experiences are that unique, and people
have realized that our experiences are the same."
They also wanted to provide a journal for them
selves such that they can remember, years down the
line, what they were doing at this exact moment and
how they were feeling.
All we are doing, said Dahmes, " is writing about
the generic experience of scientists."
