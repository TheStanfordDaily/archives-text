## Editorial Increase in ASSU candidates should be applauded 
### 
The increase in candidates running for ASSU posi
tions this spring — after years of student apathy — is
a positive change that should build student awareness
and interest in the elections.
This year, the ASSU received more than 1(X) dec
larations of intent from undergraduate students run
ning for executive president, executive vice president
and class president or senator — more than double
the 48 candidates that ran last year.
In the past, the lack of competition has led some
candidates to win positions practically by default; last
year, there were only 35 candidates running for 14
open seats in the ASSU Undergraduate Senate.
This year's races, however, should be more hotly
contested. The increase in candidates should encour
age higher voter turnout — it is no secret that some of
the races turn into popularity contests, and voters
tend to cast their ballots for their friends. More candi
dates means more friends who have an incentive to
vote.
Moreover, the fact that there are two viable slates
running for the ASSU executive president and vice
president positions — which are currently held by ju
niors Chioke Borgelt-Mose and Kory Vargas Caro re
spectively — is another positive change from some re
cent years. Presidential candidate Victoria Carr and
her running mate Fernando Castillo, both juniors, as
well as presidential candidate Melanie Kannokada
and her running mate Aneto Okonkwo. also both ju-

niors, provide two legitimate choices for students in
the upcoming elections, which will take place on April
6 to 7.
Another improvement in this year's elections is the
concerted effort of the Graduate Student Council to
encourage graduate student participation in the elec
tions. In late February, the GSC held a question-and
answer session and a social mixer after its regular
weekly meeting at the Graduate Community Center
in an attempt to educate graduate students about the
elections process and to introduce them to some of
this year's candidates.
Though the number of GSC candidates who ran
for elected office increased last year, it is consistently
lower than the number of undergraduates who run,
and the effort to increase graduate participation in
these elections is certainly a commendable one. The
GSC has set a goal of 50 percent participation for
graduate students in this spring's elections, and
whether or not they can achieve that lofty mark, they
should be praised for their proactive approach to this
year's contest.
The high number of candidates this year is very
encouraging, but it should not be taken for granted.
We have to hope that this increase in interest is not
temporary — allowing students to choose between
more candidates ensures that those elected will bet
ter represent the interests of the student body as a
whole.
