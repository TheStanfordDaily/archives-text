# IDA to fall under CSRE major
## 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
Plans are in the works to expand
the popular Institute for Diversity
in the Arts into a concentration
within the Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity, or CSRE,
major.
The Institute for Diversity in the
Arts, or IDA, is currently a one
quarter course offered in the winter
through the Drama Department, in
which students work with visiting
California artists on projects con
cerning diversity, culture and race.
Created in 2000 with a grant
from the Irvine Foundation, the
program has received overwhelm
ingly positive feedback from stu
dents and faculty since its inception,
said Drama Prof. Harry Elam, who

also serves as director of IDA.
"IDA has been very popular
among students," he said. "We have
brought practicing artists to work
with students. It's a model we, the
University and other people in the
arts want to continue."
Senior Christina Knight, cur
rently an IDA Fellow, worked as a
teaching assistant in the winter and
will help choose future visiting
artists this spring.
"It's been amazing." she said.
"The program is really filling a
void."
Some students have already
taken steps to create their own ma
jors in the field after taking the
course, Elam added, so the move to
create a concentration within
CSRE seemed to be a logical step.
Elam added that he hopes to begin

offering the expanded program by
the 2006-2007 academic year. How
ever, the details of the concentra
tion have yet to be determined.
"Some courses would be de
signed to mix art practice and theo
ry," he said. "Senior year, all IDA
majors would likely do an art pro
ject. But it is not clear yet how IDA
will be expanding."
According to English Prof.
Paula Moya, the undergraduate
program director for the CSRE,
IDA will not be restricted or al
tered in any way after it is officially
moved under the CSRE umbrella.
"This is a way of institutionaliz
ing what's been done in IDA," she
said. "IDA will work with CSRE to
make an undergrad major but it will
not contained by CSRE."
Knight, who is currently major
ing in interdisciplinary studies in
the humanities, said she is opti
mistic that the new concentration
will attract student interest.
"1 would have been a CSRE

major with a concentration in IDA
if it had been offered when I was a
freshman," she said.
The expansion of IDA will bol
ster Stanford's reputation as a pio
neer in race studies, Moya said.
"I'm not aware of anything like
IDA anywhere else," she added.
"There are very few schools even
with a CSRE major. Other schools
like Berkeley and Columbia have
already looked to us as a model for
creating similar programs.
