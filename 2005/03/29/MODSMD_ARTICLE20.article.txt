## Stereotyping the Straight Guy 
### 
For some, spring break involves beaches, string bikinis
(either worn or seen worn) and lots of cheap tequila. For
me, spring break involved oral surgery, a fistful of vicodin

and a week on the couch.
Going through one of my final ado
lescent rights of passage, I got my wis
dom teeth removed. In a stroke of had
timing, it came just a few days before
March Madness began and I could
work my butt imprint into the sofa.
To pass the time, I engaged in an ac
tivity not done since boring August
days during high school: I randomly
channel surfed. And, for my efforts, 1

was rewarded with all the education 1 would ever need.
For free. In one hour. This font of wisdom and knowl
edge? "Straight Plan for the Gay Man."
Perhaps it was the pain killers, but I actually found my
self glued to the set. in horror.
Surprisingly, however, 1 was less offended as a gay guy
than I think I would have been as a straight guy. Yes, it
perpetuates all the wrist-flipping lisping stereotypes we all
know and have laughed at (or in my case, groaned at) on
shows like "Will & Grace."
However, what was so repulsive about this low-brow
"Queer Eye For the Straight Guy" parody was its percep
tion of the ideal heterosexual male.
During the episode, the straight guys were teaching
a gay man how to hit on women on a New York street
by using a ridiculously cute Labrador puppy. While
they sat in the van, he hit on women, first giving his
number to them, then getting their numbers, then even
tually having them offer to program his number

straight into their cell phones.
Despite getting at least ten women's numbers in a
few hours of merely standing on the street, the straight
guys were unhappy with his performance. "You're
being too nice to her. You're making gay friends with
her," one chided. Another explained: "You're acting as
if you really care about what they're saying. You don't
care!"
Next, the straight guys take him to a coach who in
structs him on straight male conversational skills. She tells
him that he's listening too much. "We're not interesting to
you, as a straight man," she says, "You just want to date
us, i.e. get in our pants." Then she coaches him how to
check out a woman's breasts (for equal-opportunity stu
pidity, when asked how he conveys sexual interest in a
guy, his tactic is to stare at the guy's crotch).
I understand that the show is on Comedy Central fora
reason. But 1 don't see what's funny, or healthy, about
perpetuating extremely negative stereotypes about
straight men. 1 don't know one female friend who's look
ing fora guy who objectifies her and has no interest in any
thing other than her breasts.
That isn't the way my straight guy friends act. If this
type of behavior is society's expectation of straight men,
then it's little wonder women supposedly like us gay guys
better.
Fortunately, 1 quickly put this marginalizing show be
hind me, as March Madness began the next day. At last. 1
was able to engage in what real straight guys do best:
watch sports on the couch.
