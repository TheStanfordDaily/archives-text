## The
						Easter Bunny is sad 
### JOSH BALK 
This Easter brought the traditional egg baskets and ham
dinners to our families' celebrations. With these animal
products making their way into our holiday traditions, we
often forget to consider how they got to our dinner plates in
the first place.
Arguably, the birds who laid our Easter eggs are the
most mistreated animals in modern agribusiness. Shortly
after birth, they have parts of their beaks sliced off with a
hot metal blade. They are then intensively confined in bat
tery cages, filing cabinet-sized, barren, metal cages so small
that the birds can t even spread their wings, let alone en
gage in other natural behaviors such as nesting, foraging,
perching or even walking. After about a year, they are
starved for up to two weeks in order to induce yet another
egg-laying cycle.
Millions of male chicks are killed annually since they are
unable to lay eggs and are a different breed from chickens
raised for meat. Right after birth, they are gassed, crushed or
suffocated, killed as unwanted byproducts of the egg industry.
The pigs who provided us with Easter hams have not es
caped the abuses of industrialized farming, either. Piglets
have their ears notched, their tails cut off, their teeth
clipped, and are castrated â€” all without painkillers. They
are then fattened in concrete holding pens inside factory
farm walls where their boredom causes fighting and psy
chological distress. These animals can never feel the earth
under their feet, root or even escape the nauseating stench
of their own manure.
Their mothers suffer even greater mistreatment. Con
fined in individual gestation crates so restrictive that they
can't turn around or even move side to side more than a few
inches, the sows withstand multiple cycles of impregnation,
gestation and birth. Intense frustration from the inability to
move results in debilitating, stress-induced behaviors such

as biting on cage bars and obsessive sucking on their water
bottles.
Unfortunately, the United States is lagging far behind
the European Union when it comes to farm animal welfare.
The EU has already begun phasing out conventional bat
tery cages and gestation crates, while American politicians
have failed to enact meaningful legislation to reduce the
suffering of animals on farms.
This lack of legal protection for farm animals is unfortu
nate, because preventing animal abuse really is a non-par
tisan issue. Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) stated on the floor
of the Senate that "our inhumane treatment of livestock is
becoming widespread and more and more barbaric
These creatures feel; they know pain. They suffer pain just
as we humans suffer pain."
Similarly, former Republican candidate for president
Pat Buchanan, told MSNBC, "I've certainly seen some of
these hog confinements They have no opportunity to
move. And it looks like it's cruel."
It's clear that we can no longer continue to treat animals
raised for food as unfeeling machines. These animals are
social, intelligent individuals who are capable of suffering
and care about their lives.
Politicians should act now to begin phasing out the most
egregious factory farm abuses, such as battery cages for lay
ing hens and gestation crates for mother pigs.
But it's not only politicians who should be acting follow
ing Easter to reduce the suffering of animals raised for food.
As consumers, we can each make a difference for animals
confined in cages and crates. By leaving factory farm prod
ucts out of our shopping carts and reducing our consump
tion of meat and egg products, we can help make this a
more humane world.
