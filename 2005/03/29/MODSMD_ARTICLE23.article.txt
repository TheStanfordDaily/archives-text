# Holt's harangue
## The
						End of Da(il)ys 
### 
The Stanford Daily has money
set aside in case of unforeseen mon
etary emergencies. The ASSU de
nied The Daily placement on the
special-fees ballot, in large part due
to this emergency account. The
Daily planned on using its emergen
cy money for printing costs since it
was denied special fees funding.
Still with me?
As reported in yesterday's edi
tion of The Daily, the Daily's of
fices were broken into over the

break, and the
thieves made off
with several ex
pensive comput
er monitors. The
Daily is now en
countering an
"unforeseen
monetary emer
gency" in which
it needs to use its

funding to replace the computers,
let alone pick up the publishing
costs special fees would normally
cover. The ASSU has been report
ed as saying: "Whoopsies."
Irony is not dead.
The ASSU assumed that The
Daily could get by without special
fees money, but after recent devel
opments, The Daily's situation is
murkier. The Daily has to make
some cutbacks in order to survive.
As a reaction, the Daily editors
have placed the paper in "Code Ma
roon," which, if the crisis board had
not been sold off to buy paper,
would mean something.
Around me, aspiring journalists
begin to pull their hair out. future
New York Times interns begin to re
sort to cannibalism and soulless,
naked managing editors gather in the
corners, waiting for the End of Days.
For these people, The Daily has been
their professional, collegiate and so
cial lives. They sleep under old pa
pers, mumbling comments about lay
outs and headlines of volumes past.
They wander around like characters
from "No Exit."
Surrounded by this chaos, I'll try
to explain how this will affect the
average student, like say, you the
reader. Well maybe not you the
reader. Apparently the average
Stanford student doesn't actually
read this paper, or else they would
have signed The Daily's special fees
petition or lit torches and led a mob
towards the ASSU office. Not that
I'm encouraging mob violence. The
ASSU office is located on the sec
ond floor of Tressider, and tar and
feathers can be purchased at local

stores. But I'm not suggesting ac
tion here.
Obviously, with this budget cri
sis, there will be some cutbacks.
Sacrifices will have to be made, and
quality will suffer, of course. For
starters, I wrote this column entire
ly by hand. The monitors have been
stolen and so the computers have
been sold on eßay.
Editors will now be forced to
work double shifts, which will likely
affect there abilility too spellcheck.
On the upside, the editors probably
won't notice if I slip in dirty words
(PORN). But again, the ASSU was
right in denying The Daily special
fees. Sure, in order to gain revenue
for printing costs, The Daily will
now consist of 15 percent actual re
porting and 85 percent ads, instead
of just 70 percent ads — but we all
could use more ads, right?
And yeah, I guess it's bad that two
out of the three classified bunnies will
be sold to animal testing facilities.
The third will recite non-sequiturs
until Cynthia Cho eats him. But those
cute bunnies had to die to insure the
special fees cost doesn't rise.
Due to budget cutbacks, The
Daily will only run Monday thru
Thursday. A contest is being run
to see what The Daily will be re
named. I'm hoping for the
"Whenever" or the "Every Other
Daily."
So here's what I propose: Let
The Daily die. See what happens if
The Daily has to begin cutting cor
ners, spending less time on accura
cy, or professionalism, or can't af
ford non-toxic ink. Let The Daily
become a rag that not only will peo
ple say they don't read, but for
once, it will actually be true. Don't,
under any circumstances, think that
the student body should have to pay
for the printing costs of its student
paper. Don't talk to your ASSU
representatives, or start another pe
tition, or grab some torches and
storm the ASSU office. I'm not en
couraging any such actions. You
bunny-killer.
Editor's Note: On March 26, the
Elections Commission accepted 54
signatures for the ASSU special-fees
petition it had previously rejected.
The Daily, if there is no contest from
the ASSU Undergraudate Senate
and GSC, will be on the special-fees
ballot next week.
