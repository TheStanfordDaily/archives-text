As the two ASSU Senators who
voted in favor of The Daily's special
fee request, we feel compelled to ex
plain our reasons for doing so and to
ask The Daily to account for many of
this year's editorial comments regard
ing special fees.
We strongly support a free press,
so we opted to support the special-fee
request of Stanford's leading publica
tion. We also felt The Daily's strong
student support in previous elections
merited placing it on the ballot. In
2004. The Daily received 3,384 sup
porting votes, the highest number of
votes in favor of any group on the bal
lot. While others in the ASSU felt that
the $900,000 "The Friends of The
Stanford Daily" foundation, which
has in the past funded scholarships for
editors and will in the future partially
fund The Daily's new building, was
strong enough to sustain The Daily,
we were willing to give The Daily the
benefit of the doubt when its Business

Manager argued that The Daily's spe
cial fee was necessary for The Daily to
function.
However, we are left wondering
what the motivation was behind The
Daily's March 1 editorial, "Re-evalu
ation of special-fees system needed."
The editorial* board argued the Sen
ate and GSC should only play a "min
imal" role in Special Fee ballot place
ment, "intervening only to prevent
fraud."
Yet on April 20. 2004, The Daily
argued that it was the Senate's "con
stitutional responsibility to review
groups" before placing them on the
ballot and that it should consider
"campus-wide engagement and cost
efficacy." On February 23 of that
year. TTie Daily stated that the ASSU
should adopt a "more stringent" pro
cess for ballot placement and even
proposed amending the ASSU Con
stitution to raise the signature re
quirement for ballot placement.

Daily's is inconsistent on special fees

While we acknowledge that The
Daily's editorial board is composed of
a completely different set of people
than a year ago, we are left in the awk
ward position of supporting an orga
nization whose current statements
are in direct contradiction with its
statements from one year ago.
Had the Senate and GSC adopted
The Daily's current position of stop
ping only fraud, undergraduates
would have been left voting for
$1,500,000 in special fees, a figure
33% higher than the $1,000,000 rec
ommended by the ASSU. There are
many groups that the students, the
Senate and the GSC all find worthy of
receiving special fees, but there are
specific expenses within otherwise
reasonable budgets that are an unfair
use of student money, such as trips for
group officers. The budgets that were
approved by the Senate are the result
of many, many hours of combing
through 350 pages of special-fee bud
gets line item by line item to preserve
the interests of the student body as a
whole. The Senate and GSC could
leave this task to the student body,
placing every requested line-item on
the ballot individually, but something
tells us that between attending classes,

maintaining social lives and partici
pating in the activities that these spe
cial fees go to fund, students would
not be particularly thrilled about the
prospect of an additional 350-page
reading assignment. Perhaps The
Daily's editorial board would step up
to the task of advising students on
such a hefty task. We do not believe
they would have the time to do so,
though we truly would appreciate the
help. Silting through special-fee bud
gets was one of those tasks people
elected us to do, and they do not ex
pect to have to do this themselves.

(Editor's Note: With the exception of
last year, The Daily has reviewed
groups' budgets line item by line item
and made recommendations for many
years. This year The Daily's editorial
board will be reviewing the budgets of
all new student groups and those who
had potentially contentious results on
the previous year's ballot.]
We invite all Stanford students to
read Article V, Section 2 of the ASSU
Constitution, in which they can see
that the students who voted to ap
prove the constitution clearly wanted
the Senate and GSC to sort through

these budgets and stop inappropriate
expenses from making it on to the bal
lot hidden behind a group's name.
On March l,The Daily also argued
that the GSC should place more stu
dent groups on the grad ballot and that
more groups should seek joint under
grad/grad special-fee funding to com
bat "complaints that many graduate
students feel isolated from the Stan
ford community." We are flabbergast
ed by these two suggestions. Many ex
isting joint groups have had to be
asked repeatedly to please cater more
to grad students because of their clear

undergrad tilt. The Daily's suggestion
that more groups seek joint funding is
unrealistic. Most groups cater only to
undergraduates, some only to gradu
ates, hut very few cater to both, and
among those, very few have expenses
high enough to even request special
fee funding. If groups desire to bring
graduate and undergraduate students
together, we suggest that groups at
tempt to plan joint programming be
fore requesting joint funding.
In the future, we hope The Daily
will be more consistent and pragmat
ic, so their most ardent supporters are

not left trying to explain The Daily's
inconsistent stances.

approved by the Senate are the result
of many, many hours of combing
through 350 pages of special-fee bud
gets line item by line item to preserve
the interests of the student body as a
whole. The Senate and GSC could
leave this task to the student body,
placing every requested line-item on
the ballot individually, but something
tells us that between attending classes,

maintaining social lives and partici
pating in the activities that these spe
cial fees go to fund, students would
not be particularly thrilled about the
prospect of an additional 350-page
reading assignment. Perhaps The
Daily's editorial board would step up
to the task of advising students on
such a hefty task. We do not believe
they would have the time to do so,
though we truly would appreciate the
help. Silting through special-fee bud
gets was one of those tasks people
elected us to do, and they do not ex
pect to have to do this themselves.

(Editor's Note: With the exception of
last year, The Daily has reviewed
groups' budgets line item by line item
and made recommendations for many
years. This year The Daily's editorial
board will be reviewing the budgets of
all new student groups and those who
had potentially contentious results on
the previous year's ballot.]
We invite all Stanford students to
read Article V, Section 2 of the ASSU
Constitution, in which they can see
that the students who voted to ap
prove the constitution clearly wanted
the Senate and GSC to sort through

these budgets and stop inappropriate
expenses from making it on to the bal
lot hidden behind a group's name.
On March l,The Daily also argued
that the GSC should place more stu
dent groups on the grad ballot and that
more groups should seek joint under
grad/grad special-fee funding to com
bat "complaints that many graduate
students feel isolated from the Stan
ford community." We are flabbergast
ed by these two suggestions. Many ex
isting joint groups have had to be
asked repeatedly to please cater more
to grad students because of their clear

undergrad tilt. The Daily's suggestion
that more groups seek joint funding is
unrealistic. Most groups cater only to
undergraduates, some only to gradu
ates, hut very few cater to both, and
among those, very few have expenses
high enough to even request special
fee funding. If groups desire to bring
graduate and undergraduate students
together, we suggest that groups at
tempt to plan joint programming be
fore requesting joint funding.
In the future, we hope The Daily
will be more consistent and pragmat
ic, so their most ardent supporters are

not left trying to explain The Daily's
inconsistent stances.

As the two ASSU Senators who
voted in favor of The Daily's special
fee request, we feel compelled to ex
plain our reasons for doing so and to
ask The Daily to account for many of
this year's editorial comments regard
ing special fees.
We strongly support a free press,
so we opted to support the special-fee
request of Stanford's leading publica
tion. We also felt The Daily's strong
student support in previous elections
merited placing it on the ballot. In
2004. The Daily received 3,384 sup
porting votes, the highest number of
votes in favor of any group on the bal
lot. While others in the ASSU felt that
the $900,000 "The Friends of The
Stanford Daily" foundation, which
has in the past funded scholarships for
editors and will in the future partially
fund The Daily's new building, was
strong enough to sustain The Daily,
we were willing to give The Daily the
benefit of the doubt when its Business

Manager argued that The Daily's spe
cial fee was necessary for The Daily to
function.
However, we are left wondering
what the motivation was behind The
Daily's March 1 editorial, "Re-evalu
ation of special-fees system needed."
The editorial* board argued the Sen
ate and GSC should only play a "min
imal" role in Special Fee ballot place
ment, "intervening only to prevent
fraud."
Yet on April 20. 2004, The Daily
argued that it was the Senate's "con
stitutional responsibility to review
groups" before placing them on the
ballot and that it should consider
"campus-wide engagement and cost
efficacy." On February 23 of that
year. TTie Daily stated that the ASSU
should adopt a "more stringent" pro
cess for ballot placement and even
proposed amending the ASSU Con
stitution to raise the signature re
quirement for ballot placement.

Daily's is inconsistent on special fees

While we acknowledge that The
Daily's editorial board is composed of
a completely different set of people
than a year ago, we are left in the awk
ward position of supporting an orga
nization whose current statements
are in direct contradiction with its
statements from one year ago.
Had the Senate and GSC adopted
The Daily's current position of stop
ping only fraud, undergraduates
would have been left voting for
$1,500,000 in special fees, a figure
33% higher than the $1,000,000 rec
ommended by the ASSU. There are
many groups that the students, the
Senate and the GSC all find worthy of
receiving special fees, but there are
specific expenses within otherwise
reasonable budgets that are an unfair
use of student money, such as trips for
group officers. The budgets that were
approved by the Senate are the result
of many, many hours of combing
through 350 pages of special-fee bud
gets line item by line item to preserve
the interests of the student body as a
