# Letters to the Editor

As the two ASSU Senators who
voted in favor of The Daily's special
fee request, we feel compelled to ex
plain our reasons for doing so and to
ask The Daily to account for many of
this year's editorial comments regard
ing special fees.
We strongly support a free press,
so we opted to support the special-fee
request of Stanford's leading publica
tion. We also felt The Daily's strong
student support in previous elections
merited placing it on the ballot. In
2004. The Daily received 3,384 sup
porting votes, the highest number of
votes in favor of any group on the bal
lot. While others in the ASSU felt that
the $900,000 "The Friends of The
Stanford Daily" foundation, which
has in the past funded scholarships for
editors and will in the future partially
fund The Daily's new building, was
strong enough to sustain The Daily,
we were willing to give The Daily the
benefit of the doubt when its Business

Manager argued that The Daily's spe
cial fee was necessary for The Daily to
function.
However, we are left wondering
what the motivation was behind The
Daily's March 1 editorial, "Re-evalu
ation of special-fees system needed."
The editorial* board argued the Sen
ate and GSC should only play a "min
imal" role in Special Fee ballot place
ment, "intervening only to prevent
fraud."
Yet on April 20. 2004, The Daily
argued that it was the Senate's "con
stitutional responsibility to review
groups" before placing them on the
ballot and that it should consider
"campus-wide engagement and cost
efficacy." On February 23 of that
year. TTie Daily stated that the ASSU
should adopt a "more stringent" pro
cess for ballot placement and even
proposed amending the ASSU Con
stitution to raise the signature re
quirement for ballot placement.

Daily's is inconsistent on special fees

While we acknowledge that The
Daily's editorial board is composed of
a completely different set of people
than a year ago, we are left in the awk
ward position of supporting an orga
nization whose current statements
are in direct contradiction with its
statements from one year ago.
Had the Senate and GSC adopted
The Daily's current position of stop
ping only fraud, undergraduates
would have been left voting for
$1,500,000 in special fees, a figure
33% higher than the $1,000,000 rec
ommended by the ASSU. There are
many groups that the students, the
Senate and the GSC all find worthy of
receiving special fees, but there are
specific expenses within otherwise
reasonable budgets that are an unfair
use of student money, such as trips for
group officers. The budgets that were
approved by the Senate are the result
