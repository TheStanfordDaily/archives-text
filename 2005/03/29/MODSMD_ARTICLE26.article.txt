## Soto Tape Chronicles Stanford women get no respect 
### 
In my last column before spring break, 1 wrote
that Stanford basketball gets no respect. 1 re
ceived a number of responses from readers,
ranging from the enthusiastic Sixth Man Club
member who agreed with a whole-hearted "Hell
Yeah!" to the thoughtful U-Dub fan who rightly
pointed out that Lorenzo Romar did a remark
able job leading the Huskies to a No. 1 seed and
deserved the Pac-10 Coach of the Year award.
The most insightful comment came from a
Duke alum who made the case that as long as
Stanford continues to suffer early exits from the
Tournament, we will not get the respect we
crave.
With those thoughts floating around what re
mained of my depleted brain after final exams, 1
sat down at the airport bar to watch Stanford
take on Mississippi State. You all know the rest

and I won't dwell on it because
this column isn't meant to be a
eulogy for the men's team, but
rather a resounding reaffirma
tion of the best bailers on cam
pus — the Stanford women.
As an offhand conclusion
to last week's column. I men
tioned that some experts
thought that Stanford might
not get a No. 1 seed unless they

won the Pac-10 tournament. I laughed out loud
when 1 read the analysis, and filed it away in the
"silly things that online reporters say when they
have no clue about basketball" folder.
What happened? We won the Pac-10 Tour
nament. We kept rolling with our three-month
unbeaten streak. We demolished every confer
ence opponent we faced.
And we were rewarded with a disdainful No.
2 seed.
1 will not use this opportunity to rail against
the selection committee. Its members have made
their egregious error and, if there is any justice in
this world, are now sitting at home with the lights
off and the phone disconnected, hanging their
heads in shame and hoping that the Cardinal
spare them the embarrassment of winning the
national championship.
The selection committee knows it was wrong
to underestimate the Pac-10. A 5-0 opening
round record is more than enough proof. USC
taking Michigan State to the wire was just further
confirmation. But there is nothing we can do
about it now. Let's move forward.
Connecticut came into Sunday night's game
with a 20-game winning streak in the NCAA
tournament. Three straight titles is worth some
thing, but I don't think the proper reward is a
first-round weekend at home in Storrs, Conn. 1
thought the NCAA moved to neutral sites a few
years ago.
Regarding the subject of the 20-game winning
streak in the NCAA tournament. I'm glad the
announcers reminded me of it every 15 minutes
because I might have forgotten it otherwise.
Kind of like those Avis commercials. Good thing
Avis has those free weekend deals! Did you
know the walnut was erected in 1972 and stands
15 feet high? Did you know that UConn hasn't


Jordi Mata-Fink
lost a tournament game since 1999?
Yeah, thanks. I'll be in the car.
It did make for sweet redemption,
though,at the end of the game. I must
admit that when Susan King Bor
chardt refused to run out the clock and
instead drove the lane for an open
layup with just seconds left, I felt a
surge of pride. Geno Auriemma,
please take your championship rings
and winning streak back to New Eng
land. I don't know what was better: the
look on Auriemma's face during the
postgame interview, Borchardt going
4-5 from behind the arc or the dude
who surreptitiously posed behind
Curtis Borchardt to get some face
time during the interview of the for
mer Stanford star.
Susan King Borchardt was just one
of the many Stanford seniors who
stepped up their performance in the
second half to carry the team to victo
ry. That didn't stop the announcers

and everyone else from fawning over
Candice Wiggins, who rebounded
from a poor first half to lead all Cardi
nal scorers with 21.
I'm waiting for the postgame wrap
when Lisa Leslie turns to Stacy Dales-
Schuman and says: "Wiggins! Wig
gins! Ooh. I looooove Wiggins!"
SDS: "I thought Suminski was
your favorite."
LL: "I recently changed my mind."
SDS: "Um ... I thought we had es
tablished that Wiggins was my fa
vorite."
If you have no idea what I'm talk
ing about, that's OK. Today at 4 p.m.
Stanford takes on Michigan State in
the Elite Eight. The Spartans are the
Claudius of this year's tournament —
usurpers of the top seed about to meet
their death at the hands of the rightful
heiresses.
Imagine Michigan State dejectedly
boarding the bus back to East Lansing,
the selection committee members
slouching lower in their shameful
chairs and Tara VanDerveer cutting
down the nets for the second of three
times this year...
Yessssss!

this world, are now sitting at home with the lights
off and the phone disconnected, hanging their
heads in shame and hoping that the Cardinal
spare them the embarrassment of winning the
national championship.
The selection committee knows it was wrong
to underestimate the Pac-10. A 5-0 opening
round record is more than enough proof. USC
taking Michigan State to the wire was just further
confirmation. But there is nothing we can do
about it now. Let's move forward.
Connecticut came into Sunday night's game
with a 20-game winning streak in the NCAA
tournament. Three straight titles is worth some
thing, but I don't think the proper reward is a
first-round weekend at home in Storrs, Conn. 1
thought the NCAA moved to neutral sites a few
years ago.
Regarding the subject of the 20-game winning
streak in the NCAA tournament. I'm glad the
announcers reminded me of it every 15 minutes
because I might have forgotten it otherwise.
Kind of like those Avis commercials. Good thing
Avis has those free weekend deals! Did you
know the walnut was erected in 1972 and stands
15 feet high? Did you know that UConn hasn't


Jordi Mata-Fink
lost a tournament game since 1999?
Yeah, thanks. I'll be in the car.
It did make for sweet redemption,
though,at the end of the game. I must
admit that when Susan King Bor
chardt refused to run out the clock and
instead drove the lane for an open
layup with just seconds left, I felt a
surge of pride. Geno Auriemma,
please take your championship rings
and winning streak back to New Eng
land. I don't know what was better: the
look on Auriemma's face during the
postgame interview, Borchardt going
4-5 from behind the arc or the dude
who surreptitiously posed behind
Curtis Borchardt to get some face
time during the interview of the for
mer Stanford star.
Susan King Borchardt was just one
of the many Stanford seniors who
stepped up their performance in the
second half to carry the team to victo
ry. That didn't stop the announcers

and everyone else from fawning over
Candice Wiggins, who rebounded
from a poor first half to lead all Cardi
nal scorers with 21.
I'm waiting for the postgame wrap
when Lisa Leslie turns to Stacy Dales-
Schuman and says: "Wiggins! Wig
gins! Ooh. I looooove Wiggins!"
SDS: "I thought Suminski was
your favorite."
LL: "I recently changed my mind."
SDS: "Um ... I thought we had es
tablished that Wiggins was my fa
vorite."
If you have no idea what I'm talk
ing about, that's OK. Today at 4 p.m.
Stanford takes on Michigan State in
the Elite Eight. The Spartans are the
Claudius of this year's tournament —
usurpers of the top seed about to meet
their death at the hands of the rightful
heiresses.
Imagine Michigan State dejectedly
boarding the bus back to East Lansing,
the selection committee members
slouching lower in their shameful
chairs and Tara VanDerveer cutting
down the nets for the second of three
times this year...
Yessssss!
In my last column before spring break, 1 wrote
that Stanford basketball gets no respect. 1 re
ceived a number of responses from readers,
ranging from the enthusiastic Sixth Man Club
member who agreed with a whole-hearted "Hell
Yeah!" to the thoughtful U-Dub fan who rightly
pointed out that Lorenzo Romar did a remark
able job leading the Huskies to a No. 1 seed and
deserved the Pac-10 Coach of the Year award.
The most insightful comment came from a
Duke alum who made the case that as long as
Stanford continues to suffer early exits from the
Tournament, we will not get the respect we
crave.
With those thoughts floating around what re
mained of my depleted brain after final exams, 1
sat down at the airport bar to watch Stanford
take on Mississippi State. You all know the rest

and I won't dwell on it because
this column isn't meant to be a
eulogy for the men's team, but
rather a resounding reaffirma
tion of the best bailers on cam
pus — the Stanford women.
As an offhand conclusion
to last week's column. I men
tioned that some experts
thought that Stanford might
not get a No. 1 seed unless they

won the Pac-10 tournament. I laughed out loud
when 1 read the analysis, and filed it away in the
"silly things that online reporters say when they
have no clue about basketball" folder.
What happened? We won the Pac-10 Tour
nament. We kept rolling with our three-month
unbeaten streak. We demolished every confer
ence opponent we faced.
And we were rewarded with a disdainful No.
2 seed.
1 will not use this opportunity to rail against
the selection committee. Its members have made
their egregious error and, if there is any justice in
this world, are now sitting at home with the lights
off and the phone disconnected, hanging their
heads in shame and hoping that the Cardinal
spare them the embarrassment of winning the
