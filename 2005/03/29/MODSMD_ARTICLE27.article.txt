# Stanford defeats UConn, 76-59
## Cardinal hit Elite Eight 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's a senior thing.
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer has said it all year
long, and with the Cardinal's second consecutive trip to the
Elite Eight, the phrase is becoming truer by the game.
"This is a group that we're really excited to play with," se
nior guard Susan King Borchardt said. "It is a senior-led team,
and we have confidence in every single member of our team."
While freshman Candice Wiggins and sophomore Brooke
Smith monopolize virtually every headline. Stanford's five se
niors have quietly won more games over their four-year ca
reers than any other class in school history.
The Cardinal's 76-59 win over Connecticut Sunday night,
their 23rd victory in a row, was a case in point.
Trailing the three-time defending national champions 33-27
after a half in which Wiggins and Smith accounted for seven of
10 Stanford turnovers, the Cardinal stormed back with an effi
cient offense and a suffocating defense that surrendered just 26
points after halftime.
The anchor of that defensive effort? All five feet six inches
of Susan King Borchardt.
"She is always focused and never lets up fora second," se
nior Kelley Suminski said. "She gets it in her mind that she will
stop someone, no matter who it is. [Ann Strother, who Bor
chardt held to four points Sunday night] was six-one, six-two,
so [ Borchardt] just made up her mind that she was going to stop
her."
Meanwhile, Suminski has missed just two minutes in Stan
ford's last two tournament games, while sporting a 10-3 assist
to-turnover ratio over that span.
With the return of senior T'Nae Thiel, who had suffered
from a fractured left foot, the class is once again whole and
ready to compete.
"They listen, they buy in," VanDerveer said. "This is a spe
cial season, and it makes coaching fun."
The last obstacle remaining on the road to Indianapolis and
the Cardinal's first national semi-final since 1997 is No. 1 seed
Michigan State (31-3), a program in the midst of a breakout
season.
In her fifth year at Michigan State, head coach Joanne P.
McCallie has not only steered her veteran team to its first Big
Ten Conference title, but the first 30-win season in school his
tory.
Although the two teams have not met since 1989, McCallie
was responsible for some of Stanford's well-documented
NCAA Tournament trouble in 1999. McCallie's No. 10-seeded
Maine team upset the seventh-seeded Cardinal in the first
round of the 1999 Tournament, 60-58. It was the second con
secutive first-round exit for VanDerveer's team, and the Black
Bears' first ever Tournament victory.
"What a great game that was," McCallie said. "Without
question, that was a highlight for Maine and a highlight for that
team."
Pardon the Cardinal if they feel like they're looking in the
mirror as they scout this Spartan team.
"They're very team-oriented, not star-centered," Van-
Derveer said. "They count on a lot of different players, we
count on a lot of different players. The little bit we've seen of
Michigan State, we recognize a lot of similarities."
Outside, Stanford will look to keep a lid on junior Lindsay
Bowen, who is 9-of-16 from beyond the arc in the Spartans' last
two games. The three-year starter's 220 career treys are al
ready the most in school history.

will give Smith and fellow post Kris
ten Newlin their nightly dose of
physical play.
Then there's Kristin Haynie. Her
First-Team Big Ten honor is a mere
shadow of her importance to this
team as a physical performer and an
emotional power plant, the second a
role that she shunned for much of

her early career.
"The way she handles herself, her
composure and her poise and the way
she plays the complete game, what
she's all about," McCallie said. "1
think she's a very special kid."
Haynie's triple-double (13-10-
10) against Vanderbilt Sunday night
came at a special time for the Spar
tans, as the team advanced to its
first-ever Elite Eight.
Playing in its 10th Elite Eight,
Stanford will tip off with Michigan
State at 4 p.m., and the game will be
broadcast on ESPN.

First-Team Big Ten honor is a mere

"The way she handles herself, her
composure and her poise and the way
she plays the complete game, what
she's all about," McCallie said. "1
think she's a very special kid."
Haynie's triple-double (13-10-
10) against Vanderbilt Sunday night
came at a special time for the Spar

first-ever Elite Eight.

It's a senior thing.
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer has said it all year
long, and with the Cardinal's second consecutive trip to the
Elite Eight, the phrase is becoming truer by the game.
"This is a group that we're really excited to play with," se
nior guard Susan King Borchardt said. "It is a senior-led team,
and we have confidence in every single member of our team."
While freshman Candice Wiggins and sophomore Brooke
Smith monopolize virtually every headline. Stanford's five se
niors have quietly won more games over their four-year ca
reers than any other class in school history.
The Cardinal's 76-59 win over Connecticut Sunday night,
their 23rd victory in a row, was a case in point.
Trailing the three-time defending national champions 33-27
after a half in which Wiggins and Smith accounted for seven of
10 Stanford turnovers, the Cardinal stormed back with an effi
cient offense and a suffocating defense that surrendered just 26
points after halftime.
The anchor of that defensive effort? All five feet six inches
of Susan King Borchardt.
"She is always focused and never lets up fora second," se
nior Kelley Suminski said. "She gets it in her mind that she will
stop someone, no matter who it is. [Ann Strother, who Bor
chardt held to four points Sunday night] was six-one, six-two,
so [ Borchardt] just made up her mind that she was going to stop
her."
Meanwhile, Suminski has missed just two minutes in Stan
ford's last two tournament games, while sporting a 10-3 assist
to-turnover ratio over that span.
With the return of senior T'Nae Thiel, who had suffered
from a fractured left foot, the class is once again whole and
ready to compete.
"They listen, they buy in," VanDerveer said. "This is a spe
cial season, and it makes coaching fun."
The last obstacle remaining on the road to Indianapolis and
the Cardinal's first national semi-final since 1997 is No. 1 seed
Michigan State (31-3), a program in the midst of a breakout
season.
In her fifth year at Michigan State, head coach Joanne P.
McCallie has not only steered her veteran team to its first Big
Ten Conference title, but the first 30-win season in school his
tory.
Although the two teams have not met since 1989, McCallie
was responsible for some of Stanford's well-documented
NCAA Tournament trouble in 1999. McCallie's No. 10-seeded
Maine team upset the seventh-seeded Cardinal in the first
round of the 1999 Tournament, 60-58. It was the second con
secutive first-round exit for VanDerveer's team, and the Black
Bears' first ever Tournament victory.
"What a great game that was," McCallie said. "Without
question, that was a highlight for Maine and a highlight for that
team."
Pardon the Cardinal if they feel like they're looking in the
mirror as they scout this Spartan team.
"They're very team-oriented, not star-centered," Van-
Derveer said. "They count on a lot of different players, we
count on a lot of different players. The little bit we've seen of
Michigan State, we recognize a lot of similarities."
