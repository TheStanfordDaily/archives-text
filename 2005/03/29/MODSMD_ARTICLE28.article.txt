### SAMUEL CHEN STAFF WRITER 
After three trying days of competi
tion against the nation's best in colle
giate swimming, the No. 3 Stanford
men's swimming and diving team (6-1,

3-1 Pacific-10 Conference) concluded
its season at the 2005 NCAA Division I
Men's Swimming and Diving Champi
onships, held from Mar. 24 to 26. With
36 teams scoring points, the Cardinal
came in second in the final team stand
ings with 414 points; falling behind only

the defending champion No. 2 Auburn
Tigers, who finished with 491 points.
This was a repeat of the 1-2 finish that
occurred at the 2004 meet. At the com
petition, held at the University of Min
nesota in Minneapolis, the Cardinal
team proved that they had what it takes

to compete and succeed with the best,
despite losing a strong senior class fol
lowing last season's second-place finish.
"Fans, swimming journalists and our
competitor teams all severely underes
timated us all year and so we were out
to prove ourselves and earn respect all
season," said sophomore Shaun
Phillips, who competed in the 200-yard,
500-yard, and 1650-yard freestyle
events, as well as the 800-yard freestyle
relay.
On the first day of competition, it
was obvious that it would be the com
petition in the field — not the record
books — that would set the pace for the
events of the meet. In the first event,
both California and Auburn broke
NCAA and American records in the
200-yard freestyle relay, with Cal fin
ishing on top with a blistering time of
1:15.78. Stanford touched the wall
fourth in the event, with the quartet of
sophomores Ben Wildman-Tobriner,
Kyle Ransom, Matt Crowe and senior
Jayme Cramer clocking a 1:17.46. In the
following 500-yard freestyle event, the
top Stanford performer was Phillips,
who came in fifth in another field whose
top finisher, Michigan's Peter Van
derkaay, broke a pool record, coming in
nearly five seconds ahead of his nearest
competitor. In the third event, the 200-
yard individual medley, Stanford junior
Tobias Oriwol finished seventh in the
finals, with a time of 1:46.66, while first
place finisher Florida junior Ryan
Lochte, broke NCAA and American
records in the event.
The trend only continued as the 50-
yard freestyle sprint approached, in
which Auburn senior Fred Bousquet
and Cal senior Duje Draganja both
broke NCAA and American records of
19.05 in their swims, with Bousquet fin
ishing at 18.90 in the finals. Earlier, in
the prelims for the event, Bousquet
