## 
### SAMUEL CHEN STAFF WRITER 
After three trying days of competi
tion against the nation's best in colle
giate swimming, the No. 3 Stanford
men's swimming and diving team (6-1,

3-1 Pacific-10 Conference) concluded
its season at the 2005 NCAA Division I
Men's Swimming and Diving Champi
onships, held from Mar. 24 to 26. With
36 teams scoring points, the Cardinal
came in second in the final team stand
ings with 414 points; falling behind only

the defending champion No. 2 Auburn
Tigers, who finished with 491 points.
This was a repeat of the 1-2 finish that
occurred at the 2004 meet. At the com
petition, held at the University of Min
nesota in Minneapolis, the Cardinal
team proved that they had what it takes

to compete and succeed with the best,
despite losing a strong senior class fol
lowing last season's second-place finish.
"Fans, swimming journalists and our
competitor teams all severely underes
timated us all year and so we were out
to prove ourselves and earn respect all
season," said sophomore Shaun
Phillips, who competed in the 200-yard,
500-yard, and 1650-yard freestyle
events, as well as the 800-yard freestyle
relay.
On the first day of competition, it
was obvious that it would be the com
petition in the field — not the record
books — that would set the pace for the
events of the meet. In the first event,
both California and Auburn broke
NCAA and American records in the
200-yard freestyle relay, with Cal fin
ishing on top with a blistering time of
1:15.78. Stanford touched the wall
fourth in the event, with the quartet of
sophomores Ben Wildman-Tobriner,
Kyle Ransom, Matt Crowe and senior
Jayme Cramer clocking a 1:17.46. In the
following 500-yard freestyle event, the
top Stanford performer was Phillips,
who came in fifth in another field whose
top finisher, Michigan's Peter Van
derkaay, broke a pool record, coming in
nearly five seconds ahead of his nearest
competitor. In the third event, the 200-
yard individual medley, Stanford junior
Tobias Oriwol finished seventh in the
finals, with a time of 1:46.66, while first
place finisher Florida junior Ryan
Lochte, broke NCAA and American
records in the event.
The trend only continued as the 50-
yard freestyle sprint approached, in
which Auburn senior Fred Bousquet
and Cal senior Duje Draganja both
broke NCAA and American records of
19.05 in their swims, with Bousquet fin
ishing at 18.90 in the finals. Earlier, in
the prelims for the event, Bousquet


The Stanford men's swimming and diving team fell to Auburn at the 2005 NCAA Division I Championships in Minneapolis
clocked an 18.74 to set the record.
Wildman-Tobriner finished third
in the event, touching the wall at
19.27. In the sixth and final event,
Stanford finally pulled it together
to win the 400-yard medley relay
with the quartet of seniors Gary
Marshall. Jayme Cramer and Matt
McDonald and sophomore Wild
man-Tobriner taking a come
from-behind win to set a pool
record of 3:06.45 by over two sec
onds. At the end of the day, Stan
ford was in fourth, following
Auburn, Arizona and Cal.
On the second day of competi
tion, the Cardinal's performance
propelled them into the second
spot, setting them up for an all-out
attack on Auburn's repeat title
hopes. In the 200-yard medley
relay, Stanford came in second, as
Cramer, McDonald, Wildman-
Tobriner and junior Ricky Eddy
were edged by Cal by less than a
tenth of a second. Both schools'
relay teams broke the previous
pool record. In the ensuing 400-
yard individual medley, Stanford
lost some ground as Oriwol, the
Card's top finisher, came in tenth
in the 33-man field. Pool records
were again set in the next two
events, though neither top finish
er was from Stanford. In the 100-
yard butterfly, Cramer took the
sixth spot, while McDonald fin
ished eighth in the finals. Finish
ing first in the preliminaries,
Cramer produced a personal best
at 46.20, and notched Stanford's
third-fastest time ever. Wildman-
Tobriner came in tenth, taking
second in the consolation final.
Sophomores Andy Grant and
Phillips performed well in the 200-
yard freestyle, as Grant took the
third spot and Phillips finished
seventh. In the same event, fresh
man Danny Beal was sixteenth
overall and eighth in the consola
tion final.
In the 100-yard breaststroke,
Marshall finished his collegiate ca
reer with the Cardinal's second top
finish of the meet, touching the wall
at 52.68. In the 100-yard backstroke,
Cramer and sophomore Hongzhe
Sun tied for fourth with 46.55, be
coming the last two swimmers to
finish within a second of victorious
Northwestern sophomore Matt
Grevers. In the final event, Stanford
took a disappointing fifth in the 800-
yard freestyle relay, as Beal,
Phillips, Grant and Cramer fell to
the teams from Auburn, Arizona,

Michigan and NCAA meet-record
setting Florida.
On the final day of the competi
tion, Stanford refused to cede the
competition to Auhurn without a
fight. In the 1650-yard freestyle
event, Phillips took the fourth
spot, as Southern Cal's Olympian
Larsen Jensen took the top spot.
Junior Mike McLean finished fif
teenth, clocking a 15:05.92. The
top Auhurn swimmer came in 20th
in the event.
In the next event, Florida's
Locke once again set an NCAA
meet record in the 200-yard back
stroke with a time of 1:38.37, while
top Stanford finisher Sun touched
the wall with a time of 1:41.62. In
the 100-yard freestyle sprint, Cat's
Draganja took the top spot, setting
NCAA and American records with
his 41.49 swim. Wildman-Tobriner
took fourth, with a time of 42.57. In
the next two events, pool records
were broken once again, while
Stanford's Marshall took third in
the 200-yard breaststroke and
Cramer and McDonald took fourth
and fifth, respectively, in the 200-
yard butterfly. With the outcome of
the Stanford-Auburn duel all but
sealed, the Stanford quartet of
sophomores Wildman-Tobriner,
Grant, Ransom and Crowe finished
eighth in the final 400-yard
freestyle relay event, while the vic
torious Cal team broke NCAA and
American records.
Despite the disappointment in
the final point tally, the Cardinal
swimmers do not feel that the meet
was not a success. Starting the sea
son with a preseason No. 4 rank
ing. the Stanford swimmers have
proven doubters wrong in at least
one department, competing with
the absence of any divers to help
their cause.
"The NCAA meet was the last
chance for us to finally prove
[skeptics] right by falling apart and
yet we responded by becoming the
best swim team in the nation, only
falling to second place in the meet
because of diving points," noted
Phillips.
Following the meet, swimmers
contend that this team had to com
pete in a superior way. This will
have to happen again, as following
this year, the swimming and lead
ership of seniors Marshall, Tomas
Brown, Eric Dilulio and co-cap
tains Cramer and McDonald, both
also seniors, will be missed.
"Any one of us would have
failed by ourselves, but through
the support, trust, and love of our
teammates we were all able to
band together and create a unit ca
pable of great things," said
Phillips.

eighth in the final 400-yard
freestyle relay event, while the vic
torious Cal team broke NCAA and
American records.
Despite the disappointment in
the final point tally, the Cardinal
swimmers do not feel that the meet
was not a success. Starting the sea
son with a preseason No. 4 rank
ing. the Stanford swimmers have
proven doubters wrong in at least
one department, competing with
the absence of any divers to help
their cause.
"The NCAA meet was the last
chance for us to finally prove
[skeptics] right by falling apart and
yet we responded by becoming the
best swim team in the nation, only
falling to second place in the meet
because of diving points," noted
Phillips.
Following the meet, swimmers
contend that this team had to com
pete in a superior way. This will
have to happen again, as following
this year, the swimming and lead
ership of seniors Marshall, Tomas
Brown, Eric Dilulio and co-cap
tains Cramer and McDonald, both
also seniors, will be missed.
"Any one of us would have
failed by ourselves, but through
the support, trust, and love of our
teammates we were all able to
band together and create a unit ca
pable of great things," said
Phillips.
After three trying days of competi
tion against the nation's best in colle
giate swimming, the No. 3 Stanford
men's swimming and diving team (6-1,

3-1 Pacific-10 Conference) concluded
its season at the 2005 NCAA Division I
Men's Swimming and Diving Champi
onships, held from Mar. 24 to 26. With
36 teams scoring points, the Cardinal
came in second in the final team stand
ings with 414 points; falling behind only

the defending champion No. 2 Auburn
Tigers, who finished with 491 points.
This was a repeat of the 1-2 finish that
occurred at the 2004 meet. At the com
petition, held at the University of Min
nesota in Minneapolis, the Cardinal
team proved that they had what it takes

to compete and succeed with the best,
despite losing a strong senior class fol
lowing last season's second-place finish.
"Fans, swimming journalists and our
competitor teams all severely underes
timated us all year and so we were out
to prove ourselves and earn respect all
season," said sophomore Shaun
Phillips, who competed in the 200-yard,
500-yard, and 1650-yard freestyle
events, as well as the 800-yard freestyle
relay.
On the first day of competition, it
was obvious that it would be the com
petition in the field — not the record
books — that would set the pace for the
events of the meet. In the first event,
both California and Auburn broke
NCAA and American records in the
200-yard freestyle relay, with Cal fin
ishing on top with a blistering time of
1:15.78. Stanford touched the wall
fourth in the event, with the quartet of
sophomores Ben Wildman-Tobriner,
Kyle Ransom, Matt Crowe and senior
Jayme Cramer clocking a 1:17.46. In the
following 500-yard freestyle event, the
top Stanford performer was Phillips,
who came in fifth in another field whose
top finisher, Michigan's Peter Van
derkaay, broke a pool record, coming in
nearly five seconds ahead of his nearest
competitor. In the third event, the 200-
yard individual medley, Stanford junior
Tobias Oriwol finished seventh in the
finals, with a time of 1:46.66, while first
place finisher Florida junior Ryan
Lochte, broke NCAA and American
records in the event.
The trend only continued as the 50-
yard freestyle sprint approached, in
which Auburn senior Fred Bousquet
and Cal senior Duje Draganja both
broke NCAA and American records of
19.05 in their swims, with Bousquet fin
ishing at 18.90 in the finals. Earlier, in
the prelims for the event, Bousquet


The Stanford men's swimming and diving team fell to Auburn at the 2005 NCAA Division I Championships in Minneapolis
clocked an 18.74 to set the record.
Wildman-Tobriner finished third
in the event, touching the wall at
19.27. In the sixth and final event,
Stanford finally pulled it together
to win the 400-yard medley relay
with the quartet of seniors Gary
Marshall. Jayme Cramer and Matt
McDonald and sophomore Wild
man-Tobriner taking a come
from-behind win to set a pool
record of 3:06.45 by over two sec
onds. At the end of the day, Stan
ford was in fourth, following
Auburn, Arizona and Cal.
On the second day of competi
tion, the Cardinal's performance
propelled them into the second
spot, setting them up for an all-out
attack on Auburn's repeat title
hopes. In the 200-yard medley
relay, Stanford came in second, as
Cramer, McDonald, Wildman-
Tobriner and junior Ricky Eddy
were edged by Cal by less than a
tenth of a second. Both schools'
relay teams broke the previous
pool record. In the ensuing 400-
yard individual medley, Stanford
lost some ground as Oriwol, the
Card's top finisher, came in tenth
in the 33-man field. Pool records
were again set in the next two
events, though neither top finish
er was from Stanford. In the 100-
yard butterfly, Cramer took the
sixth spot, while McDonald fin
ished eighth in the finals. Finish
ing first in the preliminaries,
Cramer produced a personal best
at 46.20, and notched Stanford's
third-fastest time ever. Wildman-
Tobriner came in tenth, taking
second in the consolation final.
Sophomores Andy Grant and
Phillips performed well in the 200-
yard freestyle, as Grant took the
third spot and Phillips finished
seventh. In the same event, fresh
man Danny Beal was sixteenth
overall and eighth in the consola
tion final.
In the 100-yard breaststroke,
Marshall finished his collegiate ca
reer with the Cardinal's second top
finish of the meet, touching the wall
at 52.68. In the 100-yard backstroke,
Cramer and sophomore Hongzhe
Sun tied for fourth with 46.55, be
coming the last two swimmers to
finish within a second of victorious
Northwestern sophomore Matt
Grevers. In the final event, Stanford
took a disappointing fifth in the 800-
yard freestyle relay, as Beal,
Phillips, Grant and Cramer fell to
the teams from Auburn, Arizona,

Michigan and NCAA meet-record
setting Florida.
On the final day of the competi
tion, Stanford refused to cede the
competition to Auhurn without a
fight. In the 1650-yard freestyle
event, Phillips took the fourth
spot, as Southern Cal's Olympian
Larsen Jensen took the top spot.
Junior Mike McLean finished fif
teenth, clocking a 15:05.92. The
top Auhurn swimmer came in 20th
in the event.
In the next event, Florida's
Locke once again set an NCAA
meet record in the 200-yard back
stroke with a time of 1:38.37, while
top Stanford finisher Sun touched
the wall with a time of 1:41.62. In
the 100-yard freestyle sprint, Cat's
Draganja took the top spot, setting
NCAA and American records with
his 41.49 swim. Wildman-Tobriner
took fourth, with a time of 42.57. In
the next two events, pool records
were broken once again, while
Stanford's Marshall took third in
the 200-yard breaststroke and
Cramer and McDonald took fourth
and fifth, respectively, in the 200-
yard butterfly. With the outcome of
the Stanford-Auburn duel all but
sealed, the Stanford quartet of
sophomores Wildman-Tobriner,
Grant, Ransom and Crowe finished
eighth in the final 400-yard
freestyle relay event, while the vic

event, Phillips took the fourth
spot, as Southern Cal's Olympian
Larsen Jensen took the top spot.
Junior Mike McLean finished fif
teenth, clocking a 15:05.92. The
top Auhurn swimmer came in 20th
in the event.
In the next event, Florida's
Locke once again set an NCAA
meet record in the 200-yard back
stroke with a time of 1:38.37, while
top Stanford finisher Sun touched
the wall with a time of 1:41.62. In
the 100-yard freestyle sprint, Cat's
Draganja took the top spot, setting
NCAA and American records with
his 41.49 swim. Wildman-Tobriner
took fourth, with a time of 42.57. In
the next two events, pool records
were broken once again, while
Stanford's Marshall took third in
the 200-yard breaststroke and
Cramer and McDonald took fourth
and fifth, respectively, in the 200-
yard butterfly. With the outcome of
the Stanford-Auburn duel all but
sealed, the Stanford quartet of
sophomores Wildman-Tobriner,
Grant, Ransom and Crowe finished
eighth in the final 400-yard
freestyle relay event, while the vic
torious Cal team broke NCAA and
American records.
Despite the disappointment in
the final point tally, the Cardinal
swimmers do not feel that the meet
was not a success. Starting the sea
son with a preseason No. 4 rank
ing. the Stanford swimmers have
proven doubters wrong in at least
one department, competing with
the absence of any divers to help
their cause.
"The NCAA meet was the last
chance for us to finally prove
[skeptics] right by falling apart and
yet we responded by becoming the
best swim team in the nation, only
falling to second place in the meet
because of diving points," noted
Phillips.
Following the meet, swimmers
contend that this team had to com
pete in a superior way. This will
have to happen again, as following
this year, the swimming and lead
ership of seniors Marshall, Tomas
Brown, Eric Dilulio and co-cap
tains Cramer and McDonald, both
also seniors, will be missed.
"Any one of us would have
failed by ourselves, but through
the support, trust, and love of our
teammates we were all able to
band together and create a unit ca
pable of great things," said
Phillips.
