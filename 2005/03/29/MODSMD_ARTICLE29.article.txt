# Lue returns for women
## Golfers finish third at Duck Invitational despite Stephanie Lue's comeback 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Few top-25 teams are able to add a top player to
their rosters during the course of a season, but that is
exactly what the No. 21 Stanford women's golf team
did last Monday at the Oregon Duck Invitational in
Junction City, Ore. Junior Stephanie Lue, sidelined
earlier in the season by a stress fracture in her lum
bar spine, got her fist taste of competition since Oc
tober as the Cardinal finished third in a field of 17
teams.
Lue's condition, which made it difficult for her to
walk at one point during the season, trimmed Stan
ford's small roster to just five players for much of the
year. Since each team sends five players to compete
in tournaments, coach Caroline O'Connor was left
with no room to maneuver her personnel.
Nonetheless, her teammates have picked up the
slack thus far, and are getting a lift just as they hit the
final leg of their season.
"Having Steph back is awesome," sophomore
Lauren Todd said. "She's a fighter, and she's able to
create solid scores out of tough rounds to help the
team. It also doesn't hurt that she's my best friend
and roommate — when she's out there I have this
extra edge."
On paper, the Oregon Duck Invitational was an
excellent chance for the Cardinal to claim their first
team victory of the year. The par-72 6,103-yard
Shadow Hills Country Club hosted just one team in
the nation's top 25 last week — Stanford — and
California was the only other squad in the top 30.
Oregon's winter weather, however, intervened to
complicate matters.
"The first day was just cold, and the second day
was cold, windy and rainy," junior Kelly Husted
said. "Consequently, the course played pretty long."
