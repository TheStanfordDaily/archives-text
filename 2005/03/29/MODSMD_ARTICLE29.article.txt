# Lue returns for women
## Golfers finish third at Duck Invitational despite Stephanie Lue's comeback 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Few top-25 teams are able to add a top player to
their rosters during the course of a season, but that is
exactly what the No. 21 Stanford women's golf team
did last Monday at the Oregon Duck Invitational in
Junction City, Ore. Junior Stephanie Lue, sidelined
earlier in the season by a stress fracture in her lum
bar spine, got her fist taste of competition since Oc
tober as the Cardinal finished third in a field of 17
teams.
Lue's condition, which made it difficult for her to
walk at one point during the season, trimmed Stan
ford's small roster to just five players for much of the
year. Since each team sends five players to compete
in tournaments, coach Caroline O'Connor was left
with no room to maneuver her personnel.
Nonetheless, her teammates have picked up the
slack thus far, and are getting a lift just as they hit the
final leg of their season.
"Having Steph back is awesome," sophomore
Lauren Todd said. "She's a fighter, and she's able to
create solid scores out of tough rounds to help the
team. It also doesn't hurt that she's my best friend
and roommate — when she's out there I have this
extra edge."
On paper, the Oregon Duck Invitational was an
excellent chance for the Cardinal to claim their first
team victory of the year. The par-72 6,103-yard
Shadow Hills Country Club hosted just one team in
the nation's top 25 last week — Stanford — and
California was the only other squad in the top 30.
Oregon's winter weather, however, intervened to
complicate matters.
"The first day was just cold, and the second day
was cold, windy and rainy," junior Kelly Husted
said. "Consequently, the course played pretty long."
Scores were high for the entire
event, and Stanford had to hang on
to keep itself in contention during a
rough opening round.
Todd, Husted and senior Wendra
Liang all shot first-round 78s, while
Lue and sophomore Jenni
Tangtiphaiboontana fired matching
His. Stanford's resulting 315 in the
first IS holes was the team's second
worst score of the year, but left the
Cardinal in just sixth place in the
rugged conditions.
Still within striking distance after
its early struggles, Stanford turned it
on in the afternoon round, shooting
a and climbing into fourth place
overall.
Tangtiphaiboontana led the way
with the Cardinal's best round of the
tournament, a two-under-par 70.
She was the only Stanford player to
find red numbers during the week.
Todd chipped in with a 74, while
Husted and Lue each shot 75, and
Liang added 76, leaving the Cardi
nal just nine shots behind leaders
Oregon and Washington State with
one round to go.
"We felt that this was a tourna
ment that we should have won,"
Husted said. "We just put ourselves
too far back after the first round."
Although Stanford's final-round
302 left the team five shots short of
the title, the Cardinal got one of
their best five-player efforts of the
season.
Todd's third-round 73 propelled
her into an eighth-place finish, her
best showing of the season and her
first visit to the top 10.
"Driving kept me in it the first
two rounds," Todd said. "[ln the last
round] it was all short game -1 had
12 one-putts. It was the best my short
game has been in at least a year."
Husted's 74 on Tuesday netted
her second lOth-place finish of the
year, and her sixth consecutive top
-25. Liang recorded a final-round 78
and grabbed 17th place overall, her
best performance of the season.
Tangtiphaiboontana wrapped up
20th place with a third-round 82,
while Lue shot 79 on Tuesday to tie
for 27th place, her best finish in just
three events this year.
"I'm definitely very excited to be
back and playing," Lue said. "It's
been a long time since the last time I
competed, and it's fun knowing that
I haven't forgotten how to com
pete."
The Cardinal will compete in
Tempe, Ariz, next week at the Ping
ASU Invitational.
