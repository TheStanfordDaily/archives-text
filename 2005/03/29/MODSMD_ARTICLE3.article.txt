# Sandhill project progresses

### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
From now till December, making a run to "secret
Safeway" will be a bit more complicated.
On March 12, construction crews closed Santa Cruz
Avenue between Junipero Serra Road and Sand Hill
Road. "Secret Safeway," dubbed as such by students
because most frequent the store on El Camino Real, is
located near the Sharon Green Apartments in the
Sharon Heights center.
The closure marks the beginning of "phase two" of
the Sand Hill Road Project, which began in April 2(X)4
and should be completed by the end of 2005.
The first phase of the project is in its finishing
stages: Sand Hill Road has been widened to four lanes,
Alpine Road has been widened near Junipero Serra
and holes three and four of the Stanford Golf Course
have been reconfigured to accommodate the changes.
The project, funded by Stanford and overseen by
the City of Menlo Park, is the last component of the
Sand Hill Road Corridor Projects, which include an
expansion of the Stanford Shopping Center, construc
tion of housing and the extension of Sand Hill Road to
connect with El Camino Real.

With Santa Cruz Avenue closed, traffic heading be
tween campus and Sand Hill Road must now detour
onto Stockfarm Road or Interstate 280. Cyclists can
use the Searsville Path between Sand Hill Road and
Campus Drive West.
Yesterday, a drive from the Row to the Sharon Park
Safeway around 5:15 p.m. — via the Stockfarm detour
— took 12 to 15 minutes, as opposed to the usual six to
eight. But the traffic in general seemed to be only a
minor inconvenience, and not a major problem.
"Traffic is flowing quite well right now," said Kent
Steffens, public works director for the City of Menlo
Park. "The first few days of the closure, there were
some backups on Alpine Road, but 1 think that's going
to improve as people realize they're better to stay on
280 than to use Alpine."
Steffens said the widening of Sand Hill Road has
mitigated traffic troubles, and that the city required
Sand Hill to be opened to vehicles before Santa Cruz
could close.
"Now on Sand Hill there's four lanes through the
entire project corridor," Steffens said. "In the pre-pro
ject conditions. Sand Hill backed up all the time."

Construction along the stretch of Santa Cruz Avenue between Junipero Serra Road and Sand Hill road slows
the route to the "secret Safeway."
