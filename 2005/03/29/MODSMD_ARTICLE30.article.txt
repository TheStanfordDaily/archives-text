# Men's golf struggles in Oregon
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With just three tournaments re
maining before the beginning of post
season play, the Stanford men's golf
team is running out of time to create
momentum. On its spring break trip
to Eugene, Ore. for the Oregon Duck
Invitational, the Cardinal finished a
disappointing eighth out of lb teams
with a 12-over-par total of 876.

The University of Washington
took top team honors at the two-day
event with a four-under-par total of
860, and the Huskies were the only
team to post an under-par score for
the tournament. Washington's James
Lepp tied Michael Putnam of Pep
perdine for first place individually
with an eight-under-par 208.
Traditionally, the Cardinal have
found themselves right at home at
Oregon's home course, the par-72

6,854-yard Eugene Country Club.
Last year, it was the site of Stanford's
best team finish, and the Cardinal
have found the top five in two of their
past three trips north.
Monday's opening round looked
like a return to Stanford's past suc
cess, as freshman Teddy Collins fired
a three-under-par 69, leading the
team to a one-over-par 289 â€” good
fora second-place tie after 18 holes.
Sophomore Zack Miller and

freshman Rob Grube also stormed
out of the gate in the first round, card
ing 71 and 72, respectively. Senior
Kevin Blue and sophomore Matthew
Savage, by contrast, struggled early,
posting matching 775.
Yet. the second round was a disas
ter from which Stanford could not re
cover. Collins ballooned to 76 and
Clrube to 77. Meanwhile. Miller stum
bled to a 75.
It was all part of a second-round
296 that dropped the Cardinal from
their second-place perch to ninth
place and safely out of the picture for
the team title at Monday's end.
"1 think the team was frustrated by
our second round," Grube said, it
took us out of contention."
During Tuesday's final IK holes,
Stanford tried to battle back, but was
unable to mount much of a charge,
moving up just one spot on the leader
board despite a solid 291 in the third
round.
Grube fired a 71 in his last round,
moving into a tie for 25th place indi
vidually. In his inaugural collegiate
campaign, Grube has finished in the
top 25 in all but two events.
Blue also shot 71, tying for 32nd
place. Miller and Savage tied for 37th
place, as Miller shot 76 in the final
round and Savage carded a 73.
Collins, who struggled mightily
after his hot start, recorded a third
round 78 and finished in a tie for 41st.
Despite the disappointing second
round, the team is optimistic heading
into the season's home stretch.
"Each week we are becoming
more confident and get that much
closer to where we want to be." Blue
said. "This past week we played su
perbly for the first and last round, but
we need to put it all together for the
entire week."
The Cardinal have a chance to re
bound immediately this week, as they
visit San Jose for the Western Inter
collegiate.
Played at the par-7() 6,445-yard
Pasatiempo Golf Club, the Western
has been a stumbling block for Stan
ford in the past, but the team will now
look to reverse the trend after not
participating in the event a year ago.
"We all want to win a tourna
ment," Grube said. "We're looking
forward to Pasatiempo."
The 54-hole event tees off today
with two rounds of competition and
teams will wrap up tomorrow with a
final round of 18.
