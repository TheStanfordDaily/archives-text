# Longtime Hoover archivist retires
## 
### ANDREW LEIFER 
After serving students and researchers
for over a decade, Cissie Hill will retire this
week from her post as the Hoover Institu
tion's exhibit coordinator.
Hill's job combines the duties of a histori
an. researcher and teacher. She is responsi
ble for delving deep into the Hoover archives
and compiling exhibits on interesting facets
of history for display at the Hoover Pavilion
— including the current exhibit, "Unlocking
Chinese History."
In addition. Hill has exposed undergradu
ates and researchers to the vast resources of
the Hoover archives. Each year. Hill intro
duces hundreds of Program in Writing and
Rhetoric students to the letters, posters, pho
tographs and other primary source docu
ments at the archives.
"It's a little trickier than just using a li
brary. which is what most students have been
doing for years," Hill said.
The archives are comprised of 60 million
documents, filling 25 miles of shelving space
and spanning the twentieth century. These
documents are drawn from across the politi
cal spectrum. Unlike a library, primary doc
uments in the Hoover archive don't always
have traditional book titles and authors,
making sources difficult to find.
Once students are oriented. Hill said she
always hopes to see familiar faces return to
the archives seeking primary sources to in
clude in their research projects.
"Contact with students is really special for
me," Hill said. "A lot of our students come
back. We've had some go on to win Boothe

prizes.
Hill's position at the archives has provid
ed an outlet for her diverse interests and
skills. Hill graduated from Stanford with a
bachelor's degree in anthropology and has
worked as a historian and librarian. She has
also taught middle school and high school.
"This particular job was perfect for me,"
Hill said. "It was just everything that I en
joyed doing in one place, at an institution
that was also very important to me."
With retirement in sight. Hill said she is
hesitant to limit her new opportunities.
"I have a lot of plans, but 1 don't want to
be confined to any particular thing," she said.
She added that she hopes to travel, spend
more time with her family and explore her

interest in Asian-clothing design. She also
isn't giving up on research and said she hopes
to channel her passion for writing to shed
light on the many stories she has come across
while working in the archives.
"In 10 years you read a lot of stories that
need publishing," Hill
said.
In the meantime, she will be training a
newcomer to fill her shoes. The Hoover Insti
tution will officially announce the name of
the new exhibit coordinator in coming weeks.
But Hill — who already knows the new cura
tor — seems pleased with the new choice.
"Its a great job," she said. "I've always
said it's the best job on
campus, and I think she will agree."
