# Law center will be undergrad space
## 
### MEGAN WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
The proposed changes in University housing —
including the planned Munger dorm for law stu
dents and the major restructuring of undergraduate
housing — will transform at least one of the cam
pus's popular common spaces, as well.
The Mark Taper Law Student Center, located
between Crothers and Crothers Memorial Halls at
the end of Escondido Road, currently serves as a
meeting place and recreation area for the law stu
dents who reside there. But when the Crothers
Halls become undergraduate housing following the
completion of the Munger Graduate Residences in

three to five years, the Taper Center will become
undergraduate space as well.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
John Bravman said that the law students' move
from Crothers to Munger will not leave their meet
ing and recreation space needs unfulfilled, despite
the loss of the Taper Center.
"The Munger Center is going to be amazing and
anything that takes place in the Taper Center now
will be moved over there," he said.
Sophomore Matt Sussman, an economics major,
has been to the Taper Center and sees potential for
positive changes once Crothers becomes under-
graduate housing.
"Currently Taper works really
well because it is limited in those who
can use it, preventing overcrowding,"
he said. "I would love to see it as an
undergraduate space, provided that
it's used in an intelligent manner. If
they plan the space right I think it
could really help to build the under
graduate community."
Bravman was also optimistic
about the Taper Center's benefits for
future undergraduates.
" The Taper Center is exactly the
kind of multi-purpose space that we
want much more of in undergraduate
housing," he said. "So it's great that
it's available over there."
Bravman said that plans to alter
the Taper Center have not begun be
cause the Munger residence will not
be completed for at least three years.
Several law students said they are
concerned about the loss of Taper
because they feel that the Center's
24-hour fitness area is essential to the
quality of life in the housing complex.
Law student Mike Kass said he
was disappointed to hear that Taper
would no longer be used for the law

school community and hoped that
Munger will include a space similar
to the Taper fitness area.
"It's really nice to have a facility
so conveniently located and not
overrun with huge crowds," he said.
"If nothing else, it gives us law stu
dents a place to meet up and relax
after class. I'd be disappointed to lose
that."
Imogen Hinds, the associate di
rector for undergraduate housing op
erations, emphasized that there
would be plenty of common space in
the Munger residence, although she
did not have details regarding the na

ture of new facilities.
Law student Jenn Chou, a college
assistant in Crothers Hall, said she
agreed with Bravman that the Taper
Center is a great space and could serve
the undergraduate community well.
Still, as a former resident assistant
in J unipero, Chou expressed concern
about the conversion of Crothers to
undergraduate housing because the
rooms are singles.
"I think that it's possible to have a
great undergrad community feeling
in a space like Crothers," she added.
"But you really need a trained, dedi
cated and large staff."
