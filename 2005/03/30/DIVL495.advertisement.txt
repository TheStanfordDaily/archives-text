Submit with your contact information, and up to two articles (250-1000 words each) to be considered for
inclusion in the Human Biology Newsletter. Photos are encouraged, but not necessary.
The articles can be in the categories of: Alumni, Current Course Related, Current Student
Innovations. To name a few choices: HB-REX alumni, Internships, Conferences, Alien Tort, New
Core Faculty, Storey House.
Articles generally tackle Human Biology related issues on a campus, local, state or national level,
written in an engaging manner. Our Newsletter is posted on our website and is read widely by
Human Biology Alumni, who are really interested to see what has changed since they were at
Stanford.

CME 332: Computational Methods for Scientific
Reasoning & Discovery
Pat Langley and Will Bridewell of Computational Learning Laboratory, Center
for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University
This course will examine computational approaches to representing, reasoning
with, and inferring scientific knowledge. We will begin by discussing the nature of
scientific theories and how scientists discover them. The remainder of the course
will cover approaches to automating key tasks that arise in every scientific field,
including the induction of descriptive laws and the construction of explanatory
models. Illustrative examples will range from the reconstruction of episodes from
the history of physics and chemistry to the generation of new results in biology and
Earth science. Each meeting, participants will read and discuss papers that
describe computational responses to
specific scientific problems. Our aim will be to understand the diverse set of
computational methods that one can use to represent, utilize, and infer scientific
knowledge in a variety of domains.

CME 340: Computational Methods in Data Mining
Sepandar D. Kamvar
In April of 1995, Lycos had the largest index of the web with 3.6 million web pages.
Today, 10 years later, the largest web index is Google's index with over 8 billion
pages. The proliferation of online data in the past ten years has increased the
visibility and importance of data mining, and has also caused some fundamental
changes in methods for data mining.
This project course will focus on methods for mining of large-scale unstructured
data sets. The format is seminar-style, and students will read recent research
papers in data mining and present them in class. Students should have basic
knowledge of machine learning and statistics.
A large portion of this course is the quarter-long project, in which students work in
groups of 2-3 on a self-defined data mining project. We will provide some basic
datasets for these projects, including the Enron e-mail corpus and a portion of
Google's crawl. All projects will be presented to a panel of VCs and thought
leaders in industry and academia. The best projects will receive prizes, including
an iPod mini and an internship at Google.
