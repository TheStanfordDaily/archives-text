# Spartans top Cardinal, 76-69, in Kansas City
## Title drive ends in Elite Eight 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Thanks to senior Susan King Bor
chardt's lock-down defense, Michigan
State's Lindsay Bowen only scored
four points. Unfortunately, they might
have been the most important four of
the game. Her jumper in the lane with
22.8 seconds remaining extended the
Spartans' lead to three points, and two
free throws iced a 76-69 victory over
Stanford last night in the Kansas City
Regional final.
Stanford was denied its first trip to
the Final Four since 1997, as the Spar
tans' Kristin Haynie scored 20 points,
pulled down seven rebounds and
handed out seven assists.
"It's about making runs and mak
ing big plays," Haynie said. "Stan
ford did a great job tonight, respond
ing, you know, but we just respond
ed better."
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
couldn't have been happy with what
she saw in the opening five minutes â€”
a pair of turnovers by sophomore cen
ter Brooke Smith and a breakdown in
transition defense led to an 8-0 open
ing run and an early 10-6 lead for the
Spartans.
