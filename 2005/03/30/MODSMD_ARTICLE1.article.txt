# Spartans top Cardinal, 76-69, in Kansas City
## Title drive ends in Elite Eight 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Thanks to senior Susan King Bor
chardt's lock-down defense, Michigan
State's Lindsay Bowen only scored
four points. Unfortunately, they might
have been the most important four of
the game. Her jumper in the lane with
22.8 seconds remaining extended the
Spartans' lead to three points, and two
free throws iced a 76-69 victory over
Stanford last night in the Kansas City
Regional final.
Stanford was denied its first trip to
the Final Four since 1997, as the Spar
tans' Kristin Haynie scored 20 points,
pulled down seven rebounds and
handed out seven assists.
"It's about making runs and mak
ing big plays," Haynie said. "Stan
ford did a great job tonight, respond
ing, you know, but we just respond
ed better."
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
couldn't have been happy with what
she saw in the opening five minutes —
a pair of turnovers by sophomore cen
ter Brooke Smith and a breakdown in
transition defense led to an 8-0 open
ing run and an early 10-6 lead for the
Spartans.

Sophomore center Brooke Smfrh scored 16 points against Michigan State last night but Stanford could not
overcome 20 points from the Spartans' Kristin Haynie in a 76-69 loss in the Kansas City Regional final.
Top-seed Spartans
upend Cardinal

But this Card doesn't fold. Just
ask Connecticut, which staked a
six-point halftime lead only to fall
to Stanford hy 17 on Sunday night.
Stanford stormed hack, taking its
first lead of the game with 10:54 re
maining in the first half on a three
point field goal by King Borchardt.
However, turnovers plagued the
Cardinal offense in the first half, as
Stanford gave the ball away eight
limes before halftime in contrast to
Michigan State's two turnovers.
The result? A 28-28 tie at intermis
sion despite the Cardinal's out
shooting the Spartans, 46.2 to 31.4
percent.
Michigan State battered Stan
ford inside, limiting Smith to just
four points in the first half on the
defensive end of the court, and
picking up seven offensive re
bounds.
In the second half of its victory
over Connecticut, Stanford sprinted
out of the locker room on a mission,
with more energy and discipline
than the defending champions.
Tuesday night was a different
story altogether.
The Spartans virtually flew out
of the locker room, piloted by
I laynie. Fresh off a triple-double in
the Regional Semifinal against
Vanderbilt, Haynie amassed an in
credible 18 points in the first 22
minutes of play.
"At halftime, we felt that we
weren't really playing our best bas
ketball," senior Kelley Suminski
said. "We thought, 'We have 20
more minutes to break open this
game and show how we can play,
and unfortunately that didn't hap
pen."'
I laynie's success even prompted
VanDerveer to switch her defen
sive alignment, ordering Bor
chardt. who had previously held
Connecticut's Ann Strother to just
four points, to guard Haynie.
Yet, Stanford's troubles didn't
stop at Haynie. They received a
bludgeoning on the boards, where

the Spartans extended nearly every
possession with an offensive re
hound, and made the Cardinal's
trips on offense one-and-done af
fairs.
Working inside, senior Kelli
Roehrig and junior Liz Shimek
controlled the paint like they held
the deed to the place. And just like
that, Stanford's dream was dead.
The Spartan lead was five. Then
10. Then a whopping 13 with 11
minutes remaining after Roehrig
drained a three-point field goal
from the wing.
But this Card doesn't fold, re
member?
A 15-2 Stanford run tied the
game with 7:06 remaining. The en
ergy, the momentum, the game,
was seemingly Stanford's.
In the end, however, there was
too much Haynie and Shimek.
Shimek collected a double-double
with game highs in points (24) and
rebounds (10). Big baskets down the
stretch kept Stanford at bay, and her
four offensive boards were as many
as the entire Cardinal team grabbed.
A three-point play by freshman
Candice Wiggins with 43.6 seconds
pulled the Cardinal to within a
point, but it wasn't enough.
"You dream about this moment,
and you dream about being able to
advance to the Final Four," Wig
gins said. "It's really hard, especial
ly when you have a team like this,
that you just know there's some
thing different about this team, it's
a special team, and it's just so sad. I
just like playing with these seniors
so much. I'm so thankful."
"1 was really proud of the way
we came back," VanDerveer said.
"We made some really good adjust
ments, we hit some big baskets, and
unfortunately we didn't make some
stops down the stretch when we
needed to."
Michigan's State's victory sends
the Spartans to their first Final
Four, where they will take on Ten

But this Card doesn't fold, re
member?
A 15-2 Stanford run tied the
game with 7:06 remaining. The en
ergy, the momentum, the game,
was seemingly Stanford's.
In the end, however, there was
too much Haynie and Shimek.
Shimek collected a double-double
with game highs in points (24) and
rebounds (10). Big baskets down the
stretch kept Stanford at bay, and her
four offensive boards were as many
as the entire Cardinal team grabbed.
A three-point play by freshman
Candice Wiggins with 43.6 seconds
pulled the Cardinal to within a
point, but it wasn't enough.
"You dream about this moment,
and you dream about being able to
advance to the Final Four," Wig
gins said. "It's really hard, especial
ly when you have a team like this,
that you just know there's some
thing different about this team, it's
a special team, and it's just so sad. I
just like playing with these seniors
so much. I'm so thankful."
"1 was really proud of the way
we came back," VanDerveer said.
"We made some really good adjust
ments, we hit some big baskets, and
unfortunately we didn't make some
stops down the stretch when we
needed to."
Michigan's State's victory sends
the Spartans to their first Final
Four, where they will take on Ten
nessee.

Freshman Candice Wiggins scored a team-high 19 points against Michigan State, but it wasn't enough.
The Spartans advanced to the Final Four with a 76-69 win.
Thanks to senior Susan King Bor
chardt's lock-down defense, Michigan
State's Lindsay Bowen only scored
four points. Unfortunately, they might
have been the most important four of
the game. Her jumper in the lane with
22.8 seconds remaining extended the
Spartans' lead to three points, and two
free throws iced a 76-69 victory over
Stanford last night in the Kansas City
Regional final.
Stanford was denied its first trip to
the Final Four since 1997, as the Spar
tans' Kristin Haynie scored 20 points,
pulled down seven rebounds and
handed out seven assists.
"It's about making runs and mak
ing big plays," Haynie said. "Stan
ford did a great job tonight, respond
ing, you know, but we just respond
ed better."
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
couldn't have been happy with what
she saw in the opening five minutes —
a pair of turnovers by sophomore cen
ter Brooke Smith and a breakdown in
transition defense led to an 8-0 open
ing run and an early 10-6 lead for the
Spartans.

Top-seed Spartans
upend Cardinal

But this Card doesn't fold. Just
ask Connecticut, which staked a
six-point halftime lead only to fall
to Stanford hy 17 on Sunday night.
Stanford stormed hack, taking its
first lead of the game with 10:54 re
maining in the first half on a three
point field goal by King Borchardt.
However, turnovers plagued the
Cardinal offense in the first half, as
Stanford gave the ball away eight
limes before halftime in contrast to
Michigan State's two turnovers.
The result? A 28-28 tie at intermis
sion despite the Cardinal's out
shooting the Spartans, 46.2 to 31.4
percent.
Michigan State battered Stan
ford inside, limiting Smith to just
four points in the first half on the
defensive end of the court, and
picking up seven offensive re
bounds.
In the second half of its victory
over Connecticut, Stanford sprinted
out of the locker room on a mission,
with more energy and discipline
than the defending champions.
Tuesday night was a different
story altogether.
The Spartans virtually flew out
of the locker room, piloted by
I laynie. Fresh off a triple-double in
the Regional Semifinal against
Vanderbilt, Haynie amassed an in
credible 18 points in the first 22
minutes of play.
"At halftime, we felt that we
weren't really playing our best bas
ketball," senior Kelley Suminski
said. "We thought, 'We have 20
more minutes to break open this
game and show how we can play,
and unfortunately that didn't hap
pen."'
I laynie's success even prompted
VanDerveer to switch her defen
sive alignment, ordering Bor
chardt. who had previously held
Connecticut's Ann Strother to just
four points, to guard Haynie.
Yet, Stanford's troubles didn't
stop at Haynie. They received a
bludgeoning on the boards, where

the Spartans extended nearly every
possession with an offensive re
hound, and made the Cardinal's
trips on offense one-and-done af
fairs.
Working inside, senior Kelli
Roehrig and junior Liz Shimek
controlled the paint like they held
the deed to the place. And just like
that, Stanford's dream was dead.
The Spartan lead was five. Then
10. Then a whopping 13 with 11
minutes remaining after Roehrig
drained a three-point field goal
from the wing.
