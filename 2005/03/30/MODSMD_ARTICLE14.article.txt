# But that's not the point...
## Dealbreakers versus Dealmakers 
### 
Some time ago, you might have read
an article in this paper about the "deal
breaker" — that one thing preventing
you from dating a person who might be
perfect in every other way. Using this

term always makes
me feel like a judg
mental bitch, which,
let's face it, I kind of
am. As I've already
proven, I'm kind of a
snob about every
thing, and when I am
not being a snob I al
ways have an excuse
(usually it's something
like "I like 'The Ashlee

Simpson Show,' ironically, so that makes
it okay"). In short, I can find something to
criticize in just about everyone I meet. I'm
not saying this is a good thing, but it does
lend itself toward being easily turned off
by people's minor quirks.
Having dealbreakers is a shallow con
cept. After all, if something as minor as a
weakness for Phil Collins could corrupt
my attraction to someone who otherwise
has an outstanding personality, winning
charm and irresistible good looks, I
would have to be a pretty bad person —
either that or a character from Seinfeld.
At any rate, I don't have dealbreakers.
I'm picky, but I'm not lucky enough to be
able to discriminate against people based
on really minor issues. Instead, I have
some basic guidelines that potential part
ners must live up to in order for me to date
them. In no particular order, they are:
1) They must use Instant Messenger. I've
made most of my close friends through
use of AIM, and since my crappy Veri
zon phone has no service anywhere on
campus, I rely on AIM to communicate.
2) The second rule is that they must
drink. I don't want alcoholics, but I also
don't want someone who is going to
judge me. It's also acceptable if they
used to drink, but don't anymore. The
idea behind this rule is that I want to be
with someone who understands how you
might act like an idiot after a couple of
margaritas.
3) The final rule is that they must go to
bed late. I don't plan on changing my
schedule in order to wake up for some
one's 8 a.m. class, and I also don't plan
on adding to my sleep debt. If you don't
stay up until at least 1 a.m., you might be
out of luck.
These rules don't limit the available
population of potential menfolk that
much, and men who don't fit these re
quirements are probably not the kinds of
guys I'd run into on a regular basis any
way, but the rules still serve their purpose.
I'm not going to say what effect these
rules have had on my dating status, and I
encourage you to think, say or e-mail
whatever snide comments you may have.
In addition to these very broad
ground rules though, I do have deaimak
ers. These aren't necessarily going to be
awesome enough to overcome bad qual
ities such as halitosis, a history of incest
or a taste for bad action movies. Howev
er, there are small things that make me
want to befriend someone immediately
— and this doesn't imply any romantic
or sexual involvement.
Dealmakers are the things that draw
you to people... things like quoting your
favorite movie without knowing it's your
favorite. Admitting to a room full of
sports fans that you have no idea what is
going on in the game, nor do you care.
Walking into your room, going straight
for your bookcase and immediately
jumping into conversation about what
you have there. Remembering something
you said a week before and connecting it
to a current conversation (this kills me).
Admitting that they Googled/Face
booked you (but not assuming they know
you because of what you said on your pro
file). I have a friend who is obsessed with
freckles — she says that without them,
people are not "interesting." Another
friend's dealmaker is watching MTV's
"Real World" and "Road Rules" reli
giously, even the challenges. When peo
ple do these things or have these charac
teristics, I get a headrush.
Maybe these things only dig me deep
er into an obsession with someone who is
otherwise not so cool. However, I like to
think about dealmakers. They make you
focus on the good aspects of people —
the humanity — instead of the annoying
tics. As we end this school year (and as
graduation day looms ever nearer for us
seniors), perhaps it is time to look at the
dealmakers and stop focusing on the
dealbreakers. To quote the great Angela
Chase, "When you really look closely,
people are so strange and so complicated
that they're actually beautiful. Possibly
even me." Pay attention and people
won't disappoint you.

If you know who Angela Chase is, that's
a dealmaker. E-mail Emily at em

one's 8 a.m. class, and I also don't plan
on adding to my sleep debt. If you don't
stay up until at least 1 a.m., you might be
out of luck.
These rules don't limit the available
population of potential menfolk that
much, and men who don't fit these re
quirements are probably not the kinds of
guys I'd run into on a regular basis any
way, but the rules still serve their purpose.
I'm not going to say what effect these
rules have had on my dating status, and I
encourage you to think, say or e-mail
whatever snide comments you may have.
In addition to these very broad
ground rules though, I do have deaimak
ers. These aren't necessarily going to be
awesome enough to overcome bad qual
ities such as halitosis, a history of incest
or a taste for bad action movies. Howev
er, there are small things that make me
want to befriend someone immediately
— and this doesn't imply any romantic
or sexual involvement.
Dealmakers are the things that draw
you to people... things like quoting your
favorite movie without knowing it's your
favorite. Admitting to a room full of
sports fans that you have no idea what is
going on in the game, nor do you care.
Walking into your room, going straight
for your bookcase and immediately
jumping into conversation about what
you have there. Remembering something
you said a week before and connecting it
to a current conversation (this kills me).
Admitting that they Googled/Face
booked you (but not assuming they know
you because of what you said on your pro
file). I have a friend who is obsessed with
freckles — she says that without them,
people are not "interesting." Another
friend's dealmaker is watching MTV's
"Real World" and "Road Rules" reli
giously, even the challenges. When peo
ple do these things or have these charac
teristics, I get a headrush.
Maybe these things only dig me deep
er into an obsession with someone who is
otherwise not so cool. However, I like to
think about dealmakers. They make you
focus on the good aspects of people —
the humanity — instead of the annoying
tics. As we end this school year (and as
graduation day looms ever nearer for us
seniors), perhaps it is time to look at the
dealmakers and stop focusing on the
dealbreakers. To quote the great Angela
Chase, "When you really look closely,
people are so strange and so complicated
that they're actually beautiful. Possibly
even me." Pay attention and people
won't disappoint you.

Some time ago, you might have read
an article in this paper about the "deal
breaker" — that one thing preventing
you from dating a person who might be
perfect in every other way. Using this

term always makes
me feel like a judg
mental bitch, which,
let's face it, I kind of
am. As I've already
proven, I'm kind of a
snob about every
thing, and when I am
not being a snob I al
ways have an excuse
(usually it's something
like "I like 'The Ashlee

Simpson Show,' ironically, so that makes
it okay"). In short, I can find something to
criticize in just about everyone I meet. I'm
not saying this is a good thing, but it does
lend itself toward being easily turned off
by people's minor quirks.
Having dealbreakers is a shallow con
cept. After all, if something as minor as a
weakness for Phil Collins could corrupt
my attraction to someone who otherwise
has an outstanding personality, winning
charm and irresistible good looks, I
would have to be a pretty bad person —
either that or a character from Seinfeld.
At any rate, I don't have dealbreakers.
I'm picky, but I'm not lucky enough to be
able to discriminate against people based
on really minor issues. Instead, I have
some basic guidelines that potential part
ners must live up to in order for me to date
them. In no particular order, they are:
1) They must use Instant Messenger. I've
made most of my close friends through
use of AIM, and since my crappy Veri
zon phone has no service anywhere on
campus, I rely on AIM to communicate.
2) The second rule is that they must
drink. I don't want alcoholics, but I also
don't want someone who is going to
judge me. It's also acceptable if they
used to drink, but don't anymore. The
idea behind this rule is that I want to be
with someone who understands how you
might act like an idiot after a couple of
margaritas.
3) The final rule is that they must go to
bed late. I don't plan on changing my
schedule in order to wake up for some
one's 8 a.m. class, and I also don't plan
on adding to my sleep debt. If you don't
stay up until at least 1 a.m., you might be
out of luck.
