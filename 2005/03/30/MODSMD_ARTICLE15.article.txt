### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
In March, the madness begins. College basketball fans na
tionwide devote their time and energy to filling out their
NCAA Tournament brackets to enter into pools with their
friends or against strangers on the Internet. Every match-up
and potential match-up is carefully analyzed — the stakes can
be high as fans attempt to predict which teams will advance to
the next round and who will come out the ultimate winner.
At Stanford, students are no different, with bracket pools
springing up in dorms, fraternities and even within some stu
dent organizations. Some even entered multiple brackets, al
though some of the students participating in bracket pools
were very knowledgeable about all of the teams, having fol
lowed NCAA basketball all season, most students did last
minute research and tried to get as much information as they
could before making their predictions.
"I didn't do jack besides read Web sites and then pretend
like I knew what I was talking about," said junior Kevin Gao.

Senior Victor Lin organized the Sigma Nu bracket

using the CBS Sports Web site, which allows people to
create groups among their friends. Lin picked Illinois,
Wake Forest, University of North Carolina and Syra-

cuse to be in the Final Four, with Illinois taking it all.
"My bracket is really busted, but I'm still in fourth
place," Lin said. "I picked Illinois because they were the

best team in the country going into the Tournament.
They have the best backcourt in the game with Dee
Brown, Deron Williams and Luther Head. They're
all shooting around 50 percent, so whenever that
happens, that means they shoot the three-ball well."
While some pools are just for fun, with very lit
tle to no stakes involved, some pools can be quite
expensive to enter. Junior Jeff Sun entered both
the Sigma Nu pool and an official CBS-sponsored
site that is open to the general public.
"I'm in the $30 entry pool for CBS, although it
ranges up to $300 an entry, and 1 almost won ev-<
erything until Oklahoma State lost," Sun said.
Junior Josh Smith is in a bracket with the Stan
ford Band. Smith is currently in second place out

of 26 entries. The Band's bracket was formed on Yahoo!,
which has the same service as the CBS site, but there is no
money on the line for the Band's contest.
However, Smith said that even though three of his Final Four
picks are correct, he picked Duke — which was eliminated by
Michigan State in the Sweet Sixteen — to win in the finals.
"I can't believe they lost after I voted for them," Smith said.
"I feel the same way about them as I do about John Kerry."
Many students are involved in more than just one bracket
pool, with different picks and outcomes for each bracket. Ac
cording to Sophomore Andrew Gay, there is a better chance
of winning if one enters multiple brackets with different win
ner in each one.
Gay is currently in three separate bracket pools, one with
Sigma Alpha Epsilon on campus, one with his friends from
other schools and one just between him and his father.

For the SAE pool, Gay said his Final Four was Ohio State
University, Louisville, UNC and Duke, but since UNC and
Louisville were eliminated, he said he has definitely lost at
this point. But he said that his bracket for the pool with his
friends — the one he has the most faith in — is still doing well,
and he has UNC winning in that bracket.
"I had the most faith in the bracket with North Carolina
winning the championship because college teams are like fine
wines," Gay explained. "They get better as they age and this
is the second year they have had the same team."
Gay said that his interest in the NCAA Tournament did
not correlate with the success of his brackets.
"Even when my brackets suck. I'm still interested because
1 still usually know all the teams pretty well and have someone
to root for."he said.
And even though Stanford is the home team, students still
had them losing early in the tournament.
"Last year 1 had Stanford going all the way. but this year 1

had them winning the first round and losing
in the second," Gay said.
"I had Stanford losing to Missis-

sippi State in the first round," said Sun.
Other houses and dorms simply

did not have a bracket pool due to a lack of in
terest from students, particularly with the poor
timing of the tournament. According to some
residential assistants who organized pools for
their dorms, there was poor turnout because it
was finals week and students were preparing to
leave for spring break.
Yet many students agreed that this year's
tournament has been very unpredictable, with
several key upsets that threw off many brack
ets. Senior Tim Chueh said that key in this type
of a situation is to hope that everyone else's
bracket is just as thrown off as your own.
"It's like the Stanford curve, you just hope
you can beat the curve," Chueh said. "Hopeful
ly everyone's bracket is also busted, so it comes
down to picking the national champ. Every
one's bracket is demolished, so it comes down
to whose |bracket] is the least busted."

Michigan State in the Sweet Sixteen — to win in the finals.
"I can't believe they lost after I voted for them," Smith said.
"I feel the same way about them as I do about John Kerry."
Many students are involved in more than just one bracket
pool, with different picks and outcomes for each bracket. Ac
cording to Sophomore Andrew Gay, there is a better chance
of winning if one enters multiple brackets with different win
ner in each one.
Gay is currently in three separate bracket pools, one with
Sigma Alpha Epsilon on campus, one with his friends from
other schools and one just between him and his father.

For the SAE pool, Gay said his Final Four was Ohio State
University, Louisville, UNC and Duke, but since UNC and
Louisville were eliminated, he said he has definitely lost at
this point. But he said that his bracket for the pool with his
friends — the one he has the most faith in — is still doing well,
and he has UNC winning in that bracket.
"I had the most faith in the bracket with North Carolina
winning the championship because college teams are like fine
wines," Gay explained. "They get better as they age and this
is the second year they have had the same team."
Gay said that his interest in the NCAA Tournament did
not correlate with the success of his brackets.
"Even when my brackets suck. I'm still interested because
1 still usually know all the teams pretty well and have someone
to root for."he said.
And even though Stanford is the home team, students still
had them losing early in the tournament.
"Last year 1 had Stanford going all the way. but this year 1

had them winning the first round and losing
in the second," Gay said.
"I had Stanford losing to Missis-

sippi State in the first round," said Sun.
Other houses and dorms simply

did not have a bracket pool due to a lack of in
terest from students, particularly with the poor
timing of the tournament. According to some
residential assistants who organized pools for
their dorms, there was poor turnout because it
was finals week and students were preparing to
leave for spring break.
Yet many students agreed that this year's
tournament has been very unpredictable, with
several key upsets that threw off many brack
ets. Senior Tim Chueh said that key in this type
of a situation is to hope that everyone else's
bracket is just as thrown off as your own.
"It's like the Stanford curve, you just hope
you can beat the curve," Chueh said. "Hopeful
ly everyone's bracket is also busted, so it comes
down to picking the national champ. Every
one's bracket is demolished, so it comes down
to whose |bracket] is the least busted."

In March, the madness begins. College basketball fans na
tionwide devote their time and energy to filling out their
NCAA Tournament brackets to enter into pools with their
friends or against strangers on the Internet. Every match-up
and potential match-up is carefully analyzed — the stakes can
be high as fans attempt to predict which teams will advance to
the next round and who will come out the ultimate winner.
At Stanford, students are no different, with bracket pools
springing up in dorms, fraternities and even within some stu
dent organizations. Some even entered multiple brackets, al
though some of the students participating in bracket pools
were very knowledgeable about all of the teams, having fol
lowed NCAA basketball all season, most students did last
minute research and tried to get as much information as they
could before making their predictions.
"I didn't do jack besides read Web sites and then pretend
like I knew what I was talking about," said junior Kevin Gao.

Senior Victor Lin organized the Sigma Nu bracket

using the CBS Sports Web site, which allows people to
create groups among their friends. Lin picked Illinois,
Wake Forest, University of North Carolina and Syra-

cuse to be in the Final Four, with Illinois taking it all.
"My bracket is really busted, but I'm still in fourth
place," Lin said. "I picked Illinois because they were the

best team in the country going into the Tournament.
They have the best backcourt in the game with Dee
Brown, Deron Williams and Luther Head. They're
all shooting around 50 percent, so whenever that
happens, that means they shoot the three-ball well."
While some pools are just for fun, with very lit
tle to no stakes involved, some pools can be quite
expensive to enter. Junior Jeff Sun entered both
the Sigma Nu pool and an official CBS-sponsored
site that is open to the general public.
"I'm in the $30 entry pool for CBS, although it
ranges up to $300 an entry, and 1 almost won ev-<
erything until Oklahoma State lost," Sun said.
Junior Josh Smith is in a bracket with the Stan
ford Band. Smith is currently in second place out

of 26 entries. The Band's bracket was formed on Yahoo!,
which has the same service as the CBS site, but there is no
money on the line for the Band's contest.
However, Smith said that even though three of his Final Four
picks are correct, he picked Duke — which was eliminated by
Michigan State in the Sweet Sixteen — to win in the finals.
