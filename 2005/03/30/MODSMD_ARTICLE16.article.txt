# The
						non-frat-Party Party
## 
### NANCY WANG STAFF WRITER 
Music blasts within the walls of the Roble
Dance Studio, and 200 to 300 students work
up a sweat dancing gracefully — and not so
gracefully — from 9 p.m. to midnight.
But this is no frat party or grad student so
cial. At these Jammix dance parties, held on
the second Friday of each month, rather than
busting out the hip hop, the dancers waltz,
swing, salsa or polka to a variety of beats.
Jammix was started about 10 years ago by
Richard Powers of the Drama Department,
the instructor for Social Dance 1,2 and 3, as
an extension of his social dance classes. Each
event is informal and allows students to
practice their moves or perhaps learn some
new ones from fellow dancers. Students pay
a $2 cover fee to enter, and each Jammix
often features performances by one or two
dance groups.
"It only seemed natural to provide a place
where my students could try out all of the
dances in a supportive, non-sketchy setting,"
Powers said.
Senior Jamie Yang started attending Jam
mix this year after taking Social Dance 1 at the
beginning of the year. A friend recommended
the dance parties, and Yang found that the at
mosphere at Jammix was very different from
the kind of parties she was used to attending.
"I was hooked after the first time and
have only missed one party because people
there were so patient with helping teach be
ginners," she said. "It was definitely a
change of pace and crowd from the typical

frat party."
Although Jammix is open to all stu
dents. most who attend have taken at

least one social dance
class. Powers requires

all social dance stu
dents to attend at least
one outside social
dance event, and since
more than 500 students
register for social dance

classes each quarter, there

usually isn't room for anyone else. As
a result. Powers prefers letting Jammix
spread by word of mouth, as opposed to
making formal announcements, to

avoid overcrowding.
Since students at all levels of social
dance attend, many find that the friendly
and informal atmosphere of Jammix is
important for making beginners feel at
ease and comfortable trying out new
moves.
"It doesn't matter what level you are
or how experienced in social dance you
are because there'll always be someone
with your expertise or someone willing
to teach you," Ronald Ho, a junior, said.
Powers selects the music and volun
teers his time to DJ at every Jammix.
Music is usually current and can vary

from traditional ♦racks to remixes
or new music from other coun-

tries. The selection most
often features swing.

waltz, polka, salsa and others used in social
dance classes. Although most music is
recorded, a live band put together for Jam
mix by one of Powers's previous students
was a large success at last month's event.
"1 also prefer music with the power to
physically and emotionally drive a floor of
200-plus dancers," Powers said.
Many students find that Jammix brings
out the social essence of social dance by pro
viding a friendly atmosphere to meet fellow
dancers or have fun with friends who also
enjoy dancing. Yang noted that the setting
Jammix provides for meeting people is quite
different from a typical campus party.
"1 think I enjoy the atmosphere —
there's something nice about having a per
son ask you to dance, or asking someone else
to dance and being able to accept or refuse
rather than having anonymous people start
dancing with you in a dim, jam-packed
room," she said.
Senior Eric Cheung agreed that Jammix
was a great way to connect with people
through dance, whether they are new dance
partners or old friends.
"1 enjoy social dancing," he said, "not
only the dancing itself, but also meeting up
with friends and people I've met through
dance classes over the years," he said.
