"Anything for the sake of
cuteness. I'm not down with
dressing for the weather. I
just bought these shoes three
days ago in Boston. I don't
usually spend a lot of money
on shoes, but these were ex
ceptional. I decided that I
had to wear them today, so I
dressed around them."


GREG WORSWICK
Junior majoring in English
"It was cold today, so 1
was going for something to
keep me warm. This is my
dad's old jacket from the
'70s, so it has some senti
mental value for me."
