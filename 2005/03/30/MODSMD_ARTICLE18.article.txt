## Editorial With 'Hardball,' Stanford was an intellectual softie 
### 
Fora university with a reputation for intellectual
rigor. Stanford made a poor showing on MSNBC's
"Hardball with Chris Matthews," televised from
Memorial Auditorium during Finals Week, that fea
tured Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Part of
MSNBC's national college tour, the event should
have depicted the political and intellectual climate at
Stanford â€” but it did not.
Right from the start, selective screening processes
on the part of the University limited the diversity of
audience members and attendees. Fora reason undis
closed to students, the live taping was marked by un
usual exclusivity unseen in similar events that brought
political figures such as Carol Mosely Braun or
Howard Dean to campus.
While organizers of most events that bring well
known speakers to campus are usually forced to re
strict the number of audience members due to space
constraints, such events are usually widely publicized
and tickets offered to all students on a first-come,
first-serve basis. This time, Stanford Events chose to
send e-mail invitations to student leaders of campus
groups and asked them to specifically invite core
members of their coalitions. As a result, most students
who were less involved with campus groups received
no advance notice of the event at all.
Selectivity only grew stronger for those admitted
into the event, as audience members were only per
mitted to ask questions of the governor by writing
them down on index cards and submitting the cards to
"Hardball" representatives. Although the self-de-

scribed purpose of the show's college tour was to
bring America's youth into the political process, the
questions lobbed at the governor barely grazed policy
issues, focusing instead on his personal history and
preferences. This was clearly an inaccurate reflection
of Stanford's rigorous political and intellectual cli
mate, both of which could have been better repre
sented if more students or a greater variety of students
were admitted to the event.
While it should be acknowledged that the event
was run primarily by the producers of "Hardball"
and thus may have been subject to certain restric
tions, Stanford certainly conducted student admis
sion procedures poorly. Due to the lack of publici
ty and audience selection based on campus group
involvement, what could have been a perfect
chance to increase overall student awareness and
interest in politics ended up catering to a small pop
ulation that most likely already participates in po
litical processes.
Furthermore, facilitating questions via index cards
prevented many who were admitted to the event from
voicing their concerns to the governor. In the end, the
lack of substance behind selected questions and the
lack of student opinion diversity reflected Stanford in
a negative light, as a University without the chops to
give a politician a run for his money, and it let a pow
erful political figure get off easy. By treating "Hard
ball" and Schwarzenegger differently from any other
prominent speaker on campus, Stanford came ended
up looking like an intellectual softie.
