"It's like try ing to prove the events that occurred in the
marital bedroom without being a Peeping Tom or having a
camera — it's a virtually impossible task," said History Pro
fessor Barton Bernstein, referring to the formation of links
between Stanford and the corporate world.
In recent years, the amount of funding faculty members re
ceive from corporations for research has risen dramatically.
Connections between corporations and institutions of
higher education began with the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980,
which allowed universities to automatically retain rights to
intellectual property resulting from taxpayer-financed re
search. Under the act, inventions produced with funds from
the government and tax-payers can easily lie licensed to for
profit companies.

Traditionally, universities con
sidered patents to be outside their
jurisdiction. Rather, their funda
mental goal as an institution of
learning was to spread knowledge.
Today, nearly every research uni

Stanford, has a technology-licens

manage the relationships between
corporations and the university.
While some faculty members
happily accept funding from major

companies, others said they are concerned that these con
nections may prove dangerous.
"There is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that suggests
that when it is profitable, researchers take their research out

of the university to private corporations," said Bernstein,
who has conducted research of his own on the role of uni
versities in the business world. "The University requires that
researchers are not consulting [with companies] more than
approximately 11 to 12 days a term. Short of having some
thing of a Gestapo to constantly monitor researchers, it's the
honor system and it doesn't always work very well."
Despite seemingly strict regulations on corporate control
over research and consulting. Bernstein said he found that
corporations sometimes get first dibs on research results.
"There is a gcxxi deal of indirect evidence that in various
engineering programs, corporations can gain privileged ac
cess to knowledge," he said. "It's a bizarre situation. While
the university is funded by public money — the tax-payers'
money — this money is often channeled into research that
