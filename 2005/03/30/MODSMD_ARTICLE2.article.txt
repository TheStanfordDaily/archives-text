# Corporate-funded research questioned
## 
### NILA BALA STAFF WRITER 
"It's like try ing to prove the events that occurred in the
marital bedroom without being a Peeping Tom or having a
camera — it's a virtually impossible task," said History Pro
fessor Barton Bernstein, referring to the formation of links
between Stanford and the corporate world.
In recent years, the amount of funding faculty members re
ceive from corporations for research has risen dramatically.
Connections between corporations and institutions of
higher education began with the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980,
which allowed universities to automatically retain rights to
intellectual property resulting from taxpayer-financed re
search. Under the act, inventions produced with funds from
the government and tax-payers can easily lie licensed to for
profit companies.

Traditionally, universities con
sidered patents to be outside their
jurisdiction. Rather, their funda
mental goal as an institution of
learning was to spread knowledge.
Today, nearly every research uni
versity in the country, including
Stanford, has a technology-licens
ing office and special programs to
manage the relationships between
corporations and the university.
While some faculty members
happily accept funding from major

iiuppuj aw*.|A . u .. ul .i£ ..V7... . .
companies, others said they are concerned that these con
nections may prove dangerous.
"There is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that suggests
that when it is profitable, researchers take their research out

of the university to private corporations," said Bernstein,
who has conducted research of his own on the role of uni
versities in the business world. "The University requires that
researchers are not consulting [with companies] more than
approximately 11 to 12 days a term. Short of having some
thing of a Gestapo to constantly monitor researchers, it's the
honor system and it doesn't always work very well."
Despite seemingly strict regulations on corporate control
over research and consulting. Bernstein said he found that
corporations sometimes get first dibs on research results.
"There is a gcxxi deal of indirect evidence that in various
engineering programs, corporations can gain privileged ac
cess to knowledge," he said. "It's a bizarre situation. While
the university is funded by public money — the tax-payers'
money — this money is often channeled into research that

corporations are deeply connected to."
For instance, corporate connections
are prevalent within Stanford's Global
('limate and Energy Pn>ject. or C JCEP.
()ne of the project's primary goals is to
develop low emission energy technolo
gies with funding provided by Exxon,
Toyota, Schlumberger and General
Electric.
Franklin Orr, director of GCEP, said

there is a clear division between corpo
rate interests and the research produced
a division that prevents conflicts of in
terest for the scientists involved.
"While corporations sponsor re
search projects that are proposed by fac
ulty, I don't think the funding influences
what people choose to work on," Orr
said. "I can't imagine Stanford faculty
doing research because someone pays
and tells them to. They're an indepen
dent lot."
Chemistry Professor Chris Chid
sey, who received GCEP funds for his
research on fuel cells, agreed with
()rr.

"I've reaped huge intellectual value
from frequent and substantive engage
ment with industry, and those interac
tions have often been seeded by the
availability of financial support from
those industries," Chidsey said, "The
money available is not sufficient to at
tract me to develop and manage re
search programs that 1 do not find intel
lectually important and personally excit
ing."
Even so, most researchers are more
likely to take on research that receives
corporate funding, and most of these
projects meet the demands of or provide
important information for the industries

that are financing them.
The Bio-X program, housed in the
James H. Clark C enter, has strength
ened connections between the I Jniversi
ty and corporations in biological fields.
Russ Altman, a professor of genetics
who is involved in the program, said he
has observed the influence of companies
on the research process.
"It can affect research directic ins a lit
tle bit," he said. "If I am thinking of
working on two projects and one of
them is interesting to a company, and
they want to provide resources, and if
they don't put too many restrictions on
what I can do, then I might uo with that

research direction."
Orr concurred that the line separat
ing corporations and the Stanford pro
jects they help fund is quickly fading. At
the same time, he said that this division is
actually benefits companies.
"Everyone understands that the
real benefit comes from the fact that
the University is an independent
group," Orr added. "The companies
have research labs. They don't need us
to do their corporate work. They're
funding us to do things they normally
wouldn't do.
Biological Sciences Professor Steven
Block, who also works in the Bio-X pro

gram, does not consult with companies
and does not receive company funding.
He said he believes that blurring the line
between corporations and traditionally
nonprofit research will change the na
ture of the University itself.
"I do not approve of outside corpo
rate influence on Stanford research,"
Block said. "A growing trend towards
close corporate collaboration appears to
be encouraged by our present adminis
tration. Speaking for myself, I do not
think the present trend towards entre
preneurial science is particularly
healthy, and it has the potential to cor
rupt basic research.

"It's like try ing to prove the events that occurred in the
marital bedroom without being a Peeping Tom or having a
camera — it's a virtually impossible task," said History Pro
fessor Barton Bernstein, referring to the formation of links
between Stanford and the corporate world.
In recent years, the amount of funding faculty members re
ceive from corporations for research has risen dramatically.
Connections between corporations and institutions of
higher education began with the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980,
which allowed universities to automatically retain rights to
intellectual property resulting from taxpayer-financed re
search. Under the act, inventions produced with funds from
the government and tax-payers can easily lie licensed to for
profit companies.

Traditionally, universities con
sidered patents to be outside their
jurisdiction. Rather, their funda
mental goal as an institution of
learning was to spread knowledge.
Today, nearly every research uni
versity in the country, including
Stanford, has a technology-licens
ing office and special programs to
manage the relationships between
corporations and the university.
While some faculty members
happily accept funding from major

companies, others said they are concerned that these con
nections may prove dangerous.
"There is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that suggests
that when it is profitable, researchers take their research out

of the university to private corporations," said Bernstein,
who has conducted research of his own on the role of uni
versities in the business world. "The University requires that
researchers are not consulting [with companies] more than
approximately 11 to 12 days a term. Short of having some
thing of a Gestapo to constantly monitor researchers, it's the
honor system and it doesn't always work very well."
Despite seemingly strict regulations on corporate control
over research and consulting. Bernstein said he found that
corporations sometimes get first dibs on research results.
"There is a gcxxi deal of indirect evidence that in various
engineering programs, corporations can gain privileged ac
cess to knowledge," he said. "It's a bizarre situation. While
the university is funded by public money — the tax-payers'
money — this money is often channeled into research that

corporations are deeply connected to."
For instance, corporate connections
are prevalent within Stanford's Global
('limate and Energy Pn>ject. or C JCEP.
()ne of the project's primary goals is to
develop low emission energy technolo
gies with funding provided by Exxon,
Toyota, Schlumberger and General
Electric.
Franklin Orr, director of GCEP, said

there is a clear division between corpo
rate interests and the research produced
a division that prevents conflicts of in
terest for the scientists involved.
"While corporations sponsor re
search projects that are proposed by fac
ulty, I don't think the funding influences
what people choose to work on," Orr
said. "I can't imagine Stanford faculty
doing research because someone pays
and tells them to. They're an indepen
dent lot."
Chemistry Professor Chris Chid
sey, who received GCEP funds for his
research on fuel cells, agreed with
()rr.

"I've reaped huge intellectual value
from frequent and substantive engage
ment with industry, and those interac
tions have often been seeded by the
availability of financial support from
those industries," Chidsey said, "The
money available is not sufficient to at
tract me to develop and manage re
search programs that 1 do not find intel
lectually important and personally excit
ing."
Even so, most researchers are more
likely to take on research that receives
corporate funding, and most of these
projects meet the demands of or provide
important information for the industries

that are financing them.
The Bio-X program, housed in the
James H. Clark C enter, has strength
ened connections between the I Jniversi
ty and corporations in biological fields.
Russ Altman, a professor of genetics
who is involved in the program, said he
has observed the influence of companies
on the research process.
"It can affect research directic ins a lit
tle bit," he said. "If I am thinking of
working on two projects and one of
them is interesting to a company, and
they want to provide resources, and if
they don't put too many restrictions on
what I can do, then I might uo with that

research direction."
Orr concurred that the line separat
ing corporations and the Stanford pro
jects they help fund is quickly fading. At
the same time, he said that this division is
actually benefits companies.
"Everyone understands that the
real benefit comes from the fact that
the University is an independent
group," Orr added. "The companies
have research labs. They don't need us
to do their corporate work. They're
funding us to do things they normally
wouldn't do.
Biological Sciences Professor Steven
Block, who also works in the Bio-X pro

gram, does not consult with companies
and does not receive company funding.
He said he believes that blurring the line
between corporations and traditionally
nonprofit research will change the na
ture of the University itself.
"I do not approve of outside corpo
rate influence on Stanford research,"
Block said. "A growing trend towards
close corporate collaboration appears to
be encouraged by our present adminis
tration. Speaking for myself, I do not
think the present trend towards entre
preneurial science is particularly
healthy, and it has the potential to cor
rupt basic research.
