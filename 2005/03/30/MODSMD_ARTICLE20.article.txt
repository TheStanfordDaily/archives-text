# Techie saves the world
## Stop worrying and love the aliens

I'd like to start this column by
telling you to vote for my roommate
(who was the star of my column on re
ligion) for the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate. His name is Nicholas Bran
don Benavides. He's a good guy, and
he might turn out to be a decent sena
tor, although I can't see why he wants
the job. Now, let us progress on to the
meat of this column.
A while ago, I was watching a CNN

special on illegal immigrants from Mexico. I was sur
prised to learn that nothing is being done to cast out
these wretched brown devils that are plaguing the U.S.
of A. with crime and demands for welfare. Why does our
government refuse to crack down on illegals? If the gov
ernment offered a $20 reward for information leading to
the whereabouts of an illegal, I would be able to turn in
a few. Doesn't the government know that illegals are ru
ining our country? Or are they?
In the Antebellum South, plantation owners lived
like kings. They sipped mint juleps and wrote the Con
stitution. while others did the work. In South Africa,
whites had a standard of living equivalent to the richest
European nations, despite their own nation's barely in
dustrialized status. As long as the labor market is kept
depressed, the ruling class gains the difference as profit.
Slavery pays. But it is also difficult to maintain — it re
quires force to coerce someone into working fora pit
tance while those holding the whip reap the benefits.
But our American solution is a marvel of social engi
neering. Our cheap laborers risk their lives to cross the
border, so they can clean the toilets of the rich for less
money than an American would ever take. And this sys
tem was not set up by chance. The government allows

these people to work in America, as long as they take
jobs no U.S. citizen wants.
Our system creates a class of workers that has no up
ward mobility. They don't have the papers to get any job
in which they aren't paid under the table by faceless con
tractors. If we allowed these industrious people to have
a normal range of options they would earn more money
and contribute more labor to our society, but at the cost
of jobs for American citizens. But if we make all the ille
gals compete for the low-status jobs, then the abundance
of labor at the bottom-rung makes these jobs pay very
little. This results in savings for the rest of us, especially
in food and domestic services.
And you know what the sick part is? I don't have one
of my clever solutions for you. The status quo is good for
legal residents, who get their food and floors cleaned for
much less money, and it's good for the illegals, who are
making more money than they would in Mexico. But
there's no reason for us to make it harder for them by
taking away their driver's licenses, not educating their
kids or broadcasting idiotic CNN specials.
These people come here willingly. And they stay
willingly. Their native countries have no jobs, or jobs
that pay a pittance. Even the worst we can offer is bet
ter than the best they could get at home. But don't think
they like it. They are no less able than legal residents.
There's no reason they should be making less money
just because they have no papers. You'd be a fool if you
think they're not angry. If we mistreat them too much,
our chickens will come home to roost. At best, they will
leave, and everything will become more expensive.
And at worst...
