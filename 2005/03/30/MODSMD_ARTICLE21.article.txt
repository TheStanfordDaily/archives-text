Undeveloped land is not 'just sitting there'
I'm writing in response to the article "Stanford
to lease land for hotel" (March 28). I would like
to call attention to a negative attitude that many
people have toward nature, which is dangerous
and ultimately destructive to our well-being. The
spokesman for the Stanford Management Com
pany, Bill Phillips, is quoted as saying that the
land slated for construction of a new hotel is "just
sitting there with nothing on it... it doesn't do
anything to support the University's mission —
in fact, it's costing us money in taxes."
It is a persistent hut misguided idea to think
that undeveloped land is undesirable or even
has "nothing on it." Stanford's campus is valued
tremendously for its natural beauty in the midst
of wall-to-wall development in the Bay Area.
Affiliates of the University and tourists alike
feel that they can breathe freely here. Trees,
plants and open spaces — cultivated by human
hands or not — have a lot to do with that feel
ing. The value of undeveloped land is in its
beauty and in the sense of well-being that
comes from the simple fact that it is there, that
it exists. And that's just the value to humans —
the value of the land to other species should be
obvious.
