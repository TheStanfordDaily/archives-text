## Politics, hypocrisy distort Schiavo case 
### 
Enough is enough.
The Terri Schiavo fiasco — and
yes, it is a fiasco — has dragged itself
out long enough. While I hope that
you never waste your time reading an
other article about this tragedy (after
this one, of course), please understand
that there are three aspects to this that
ought to he looked at separately —
one substantive, two preposterous.
The ethical dilemma: The debate
over euthanasia is significant, but it is
not new. To frame this debate, there

are several dis
tinctions that one
ought to make.
The first is be
tween active and
passive euthana
sia. Active eu
thanasia involves
withdrawing
treatment from a
patient causing

that patient to die, while passive eu
thanasia involves withholding po
tentially lifesaving treatment from
the outset. In essence, it's the differ
ence between killing someone and
allowing someone to die. Regard
less, if the patient is better off dead,
then the patient is better off dead.
How he or she gets to that point
seems peripheral.
The second distinction — be
tween voluntary and non-voluntary
euthanasia — is more important.
Voluntary euthanasia occurs at the
informed request of a competent pa
tient, while non-voluntary euthana
sia involves a patient who is not com
petent to give consent.
The Schiavo case involves active,
non-voluntary euthanasia. Whether
this form of euthanasia should be
legal is not an easy question, and cer
tainly not one 1 can solve in the 600
words The Daily gives me, but you
can do us all a favor by calling your
parents and siblings tonight and let
ting them know what you want to
happen to you. should you become
incapacitated in the future.
This would save us from the poli
tics, the second aspect in this fiasco.
I'm not a political conspiracy
junkie. 1 don't believe that Bill Clin
ton killed Vince Foster or that the
Skull and Bones society is running
this country from behind the scenes.

But let's consider the circum
stances here. There are hundreds of
instances each month in which life
prolonging treatment is withdrawn
at the behest of the nearest of kin,
and this is the first one to have been
blown-up on the national stage.
Why? Well, who's the governor of
Florida but the president's brother?
Good ole' Jeb has gotten a lot of press
recently, from the Schiavo fiasco to
representing the United States at an
international donor's conference in
the wake of the tsunami disaster.
While it's unclear as to whether Amer
ica can stomach electing a third Bush
in 2008. making him a household
name now certainly couldn't hurt.
This also brings the president's
"culture of life" positions to the fore
front. To his Right-wing base, there
is little difference between an abor
tion and euthanasia — both issues
bring conservatives out in full force.
Never mind that those who espouse
this culture of life are also adamant
supporters of the death penalty.
Consistency anybody?
Finally, the third aspect is
hypocrisy. The hypocrisy surround
ing the culture of life contingent pales
in comparison to the hypocrisy sur
rounding the Congressional leaders
who have taken up the cross to fight
for Terri's right to a feeding tube.
Consider Senate Majority Lead
er Bill Frist, an outspoken propo
nent of continuing Schiavo's life, and
a doctor. According to the New
York Times, Frist, in his capacity as
a physician, has certified that pa
tients were brain dead so that their
organs could be transplanted. How
is the Schiavo case different?
Also consider House Majority
Leader Tom DeLay. Sixteen years
ago, DeLay and his family members
made the decision to withdraw life
support from his father, after he suf
fered a major accident. I'm just
going to let this one speak for itself.
If we want to have a real, produc
tive debate, we must first separate
the ethical issue from the political —
and the hypocritical. The fact that
our leaders in Washington can't,
while not surprising, certainly does
not bode well for the rest of us.

blown-up on the national stage.
Why? Well, who's the governor of
Florida but the president's brother?
Good ole' Jeb has gotten a lot of press
recently, from the Schiavo fiasco to
representing the United States at an
international donor's conference in
the wake of the tsunami disaster.
While it's unclear as to whether Amer
ica can stomach electing a third Bush
in 2008. making him a household
name now certainly couldn't hurt.
This also brings the president's
"culture of life" positions to the fore
front. To his Right-wing base, there
is little difference between an abor
tion and euthanasia — both issues
bring conservatives out in full force.
Never mind that those who espouse
this culture of life are also adamant
supporters of the death penalty.
Consistency anybody?
Finally, the third aspect is
hypocrisy. The hypocrisy surround
ing the culture of life contingent pales
in comparison to the hypocrisy sur
rounding the Congressional leaders
who have taken up the cross to fight
for Terri's right to a feeding tube.
Consider Senate Majority Lead
er Bill Frist, an outspoken propo
nent of continuing Schiavo's life, and
a doctor. According to the New
York Times, Frist, in his capacity as
a physician, has certified that pa
tients were brain dead so that their
organs could be transplanted. How
is the Schiavo case different?
Also consider House Majority
Leader Tom DeLay. Sixteen years
ago, DeLay and his family members
made the decision to withdraw life
support from his father, after he suf
fered a major accident. I'm just
going to let this one speak for itself.
If we want to have a real, produc
tive debate, we must first separate
the ethical issue from the political —
and the hypocritical. The fact that
our leaders in Washington can't,
while not surprising, certainly does
not bode well for the rest of us.
