## Finding the moral clarity to save Schiavo 
### NATHAN MINTZ 
In a tyrannical society, the challenge is finding the
courage to confront evil; in a free society, the challenge is
finding the moral clarity to see evil. The fate of Terri Schi
avo is the tragic result of our failure to find the moral clar
ity to see the sinister forces at work in guiding her fate. This
case is only the tip of the iceberg — a much more sinister
undercurrent is moving to redefine the value of life in our
society on utilitarian rather than on moral and universal
principles. The tragedy is. Terri Schiavo may be dead by
the time you read this and we may stand one step further
down a very dark path.
In Terri Schiavo's case, a guardian ad litem was ap
pointed by the court to make decisions on her behalf; by
law. this is the person with the highest priority in deter
mining her fate. The appointed guardian. Richard Pearse,
was very suspicious of her husband's judgment. Terri Schi
avo's malpractice suit was concluded in 1994; her husband
is the sole executor of her estate. Until the time of this
$75(),(KX) settlement, Michael Schiavo never mentioned his
wife's desire to die. Furthermore, he was unable to present
an iota of conclusive evidence beyond his personal testi
mony of his wife's final wishes. Pearse denied the petition
by Michael Schiavo to remove the feeding tube. We see
that the courts have the hubris to assume that they know
better than this man, who by Florida law has the highest
priority in determining her fate. From the court's disregard
of her guardian's recommendations, it is clear that there is

something more afoot here than a legal decision.
What is being neglected here is the insidious agenda of
parties calling for Terri Schiavo's starvation. The cham
pion medical witness in the case was Dr. Ronald Cran
i'ord. Cranford has been an advocate of starving
Alzheimer's patients to spare them suffering and is an ac
tive campaigner for the legalization of euthanasia. He has
testified to starve the patient to death in no less than four
other cases of similar circumstances to Terri Schiavo's.
Dr. Cranford's "contribution" is not unique either — vir
tually every member of the euthanasia lobby has filed an
amicus brief on behalf of Michael Schiavo.
The intentions of the euthanasia lobby are made very
clear by an amicus brief filed last year by a committee of
bio-ethicists calling to starve Terri Schiavo. This work con
tains nothing short of pure sophistry — claiming, "The
courts having determined Terri Schiavo's personal decision
on clear and convincing evidence." The exact nature of her
final wishes remains unclear — two independent guardians
and 10 years of adjudication hasn't adequately determined
them. That the bio-ethicists are willing to change the basic
facts of this case in order to fit their agenda is disturbing.
Through the lens of moral clarity it can be seen that there
are forces at work hoping to instigate a fundamental
paradigm shift in how we view human life — that the quality
of life takes the place of the sanctity of life. It is not our place,
nor should it ever be. to judge what is considered an accept
able quality of life. We simply do not have a moral yardstick
by which to judge who among the innocent lives and dies. As

such, we must therefore operate under the assumption that
each life is sacred, unique and of immeasurable worth, irre
spective of its degree of suffering or consciousness.
Let me be emphatic on this point: the same people call
ing for Terri Schiavo's starvation are also advocating eu
thanasia and infanticide. This is the world that the forces
pushing to kill Terri Schiavo are paving the way for: ac
cording to a study by the American Society for Suicide Pre
vention. in the Netherlands euthanasia has skyrocketed to
fully 9 percent of the deaths in that country since its legal
ization in 1990 — furthermore, half of the procedures were
performed without the consent of the patient. Statistically
speaking, this would be the equivalent of 100,000 incidents
of involuntary euthanasia a year in the United States.
There is a word for this sort of thing — mass-murder.
In these troubled times, I cling to moral clarity. In the
Torah, or the first five books of the Bible, the words "You
shall fear God" are used no fewer than 36 times. In every
one of these incidents, the fear of God is elicited to defend
those who are unable to defend themselves. As a society
therefore, we will ultimately be judged by the vigor with
which we defend the most weak and defenseless among us.
In reflecting upon our actions and the path we are heading
down in this case, as a God fearing man, 1 find myself very
scared of where we are heading. I pray that it is not too late.

In a tyrannical society, the challenge is finding the
courage to confront evil; in a free society, the challenge is
finding the moral clarity to see evil. The fate of Terri Schi
avo is the tragic result of our failure to find the moral clar
ity to see the sinister forces at work in guiding her fate. This
case is only the tip of the iceberg — a much more sinister
undercurrent is moving to redefine the value of life in our
society on utilitarian rather than on moral and universal
principles. The tragedy is. Terri Schiavo may be dead by
the time you read this and we may stand one step further
down a very dark path.
In Terri Schiavo's case, a guardian ad litem was ap
pointed by the court to make decisions on her behalf; by
law. this is the person with the highest priority in deter
mining her fate. The appointed guardian. Richard Pearse,
was very suspicious of her husband's judgment. Terri Schi
avo's malpractice suit was concluded in 1994; her husband
is the sole executor of her estate. Until the time of this
$75(),(KX) settlement, Michael Schiavo never mentioned his
wife's desire to die. Furthermore, he was unable to present
an iota of conclusive evidence beyond his personal testi
mony of his wife's final wishes. Pearse denied the petition
by Michael Schiavo to remove the feeding tube. We see
that the courts have the hubris to assume that they know
better than this man, who by Florida law has the highest
priority in determining her fate. From the court's disregard
of her guardian's recommendations, it is clear that there is

something more afoot here than a legal decision.
What is being neglected here is the insidious agenda of
parties calling for Terri Schiavo's starvation. The cham
pion medical witness in the case was Dr. Ronald Cran
i'ord. Cranford has been an advocate of starving
Alzheimer's patients to spare them suffering and is an ac
tive campaigner for the legalization of euthanasia. He has
testified to starve the patient to death in no less than four
other cases of similar circumstances to Terri Schiavo's.
Dr. Cranford's "contribution" is not unique either — vir
tually every member of the euthanasia lobby has filed an
amicus brief on behalf of Michael Schiavo.
The intentions of the euthanasia lobby are made very
clear by an amicus brief filed last year by a committee of
bio-ethicists calling to starve Terri Schiavo. This work con
tains nothing short of pure sophistry — claiming, "The
courts having determined Terri Schiavo's personal decision
on clear and convincing evidence." The exact nature of her
final wishes remains unclear — two independent guardians
and 10 years of adjudication hasn't adequately determined
them. That the bio-ethicists are willing to change the basic
facts of this case in order to fit their agenda is disturbing.
Through the lens of moral clarity it can be seen that there
are forces at work hoping to instigate a fundamental
paradigm shift in how we view human life — that the quality
of life takes the place of the sanctity of life. It is not our place,
nor should it ever be. to judge what is considered an accept
able quality of life. We simply do not have a moral yardstick
by which to judge who among the innocent lives and dies. As

such, we must therefore operate under the assumption that
each life is sacred, unique and of immeasurable worth, irre
spective of its degree of suffering or consciousness.
Let me be emphatic on this point: the same people call
ing for Terri Schiavo's starvation are also advocating eu
thanasia and infanticide. This is the world that the forces
pushing to kill Terri Schiavo are paving the way for: ac
