# Study criticizes education schools
## 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ STAFF WRITER 
Flaws in curricula taught in edu
cation schools at universities across
the country are responsible for poor
quality teaching and weak leader
ship training for future teachers, ac
cording to a study spearheaded by
Arthur Levine, president of Colum
bia University's Teachers College,
and Alvin Sanoff, a former editor for
U.S. News and World Report.
The results of this study, entitled
"Educating School Leaders," identi
fies these flaws in administrative as
pects of education school curricula.
Hut these problems do not afflict
Stanford's School of Education, said
Deborah Stipek, dean of the school.
The study, part of a four-part se
ries, compiled data from 28 ease
studies and a national survey of re
sponses from educational adminis
trators, faculty and deans.
According to the study, the quali
ty of education leadership programs
range from "inadequate to ap
palling." Many suffer from low ad
mission and graduation standards.
Additionally, the study stated
that a number of these programs are
taught by unqualified faculty mem
bers who lack knowledge the disci
plines they are teaching. Many rely
on their own experiences or "war
stories" to educate students, but lack
a solid academic foundation.
Clinical courses at many educa
tion schools are sub-par and are not
prioritized relative to other classes
and coursework, the study stated. It
also underscored the frequency of ir
relevant research in education
schools. Much of the research con
ducted in these schools was found to
lack an empirical basis or any con
nection to the fields students intend
to study.
In contrast to this criticism,
Stipek lauded Stanford's School of
Education for offering rigorous de
grees and excellent research oppor
tunities, as well as attracting highly
qualified faculty and students.
"Stanford is very different from
most schools of education in that it
emphasizes both research and prac
tice and the connection between the
two," Stipek said. "We do this be
cause we attract committed and ex
perienced faculty."

While Stipek agreed that many
other education schools attract
lower-quality applicants and have
low graduation standards, she said
that this phenomenon is "not neces
sarily the fault of education
schools." Rather, she said likely re
sults from the disparity between the
low wages teachers earn and the
enormous amount of experience and
knowledge they must acquire for the
job.
John Baugh. professor of educa
tion and linguistics, also said he be
lieves that Stanford's School of Edu
cation deserves praise for quality

programs in areas that Levine's
study highlighted weaknesses.
"Stanford's School of Education
is absolutely the contrary to the
study's findings," Baugh said. "This
school leads programs that require
students to reach out to the sur
rounding communities in Palo
Alto."
Stanford Education Professor Ed
ward Haertel criticized Levine and
Sanoff's study as "tired and difficult
to substantiate."
Yet despite negative feedback,
Sanoff maintained that the study is a
crucial step toward addressing these

problems constructively.
"In my opinion, educational ad
ministration as a field has not really
addressed its problems," Sanoff said.
"As long as the profound problems
persist, the report is timely and rele
vant. I take criticisms of this study
with a grain of salt."
According to an article featured
on the Columbia Teachers College
Web site, Levine and others will
begin work on the second portion of
the four-part study, which will focus
on education schools' research pro
grams. It is projected to be finished
by next year.

While a recent study criticizes schools of education across the country, administrators at Stanford's School of
Education maintain that they avoid many of the problems identified in the study.
