## Right in the Babymaker Barry's threat to retire is a bluff 
### 
Wondering how the Giants will do with
Jason Ellison in left this season?
Thinking of selling your SBC Park
season tickets for San Jose Saber Cats seats?
Sobbing quietly and holding a razor to your
wrist over the sink because you spent your first
fantasy pick on Barry Bonds?
Don't sweat it.
Barry will be back this season for obvious
reasons, even despite his "Watch me retire —
I swear, I'll do it!" screed in Scottsdale last
week. By placing blame squarely on the media
for the hurricane of steroid accusations around
him. Bonds is starting a game of chicken that
he can't win. When he complained that a com
bination of knee problems and media-induced
stress would drive him into retirement, he was
essentially threatening to deny baseball fans

an opportunity to see the
home run record broken in
an attempt to paint himself as
someone who just doesn't
care enough to go on amidst
all the allegations.
Of course, that has all the
plausibility of Ron Artest
promising to behave.
If Bonds leaves, his legacy
will be that of a guy who

stepped down because he thought it would
make him look noble but ended up making
him the biggest waste of talent ever. Instead of
being a martyr. Bonds will wind up a pariah
and a self-imposed one, at that.
Barry's knees are rapidly healing, accord
ing to his manager, and he should be healthy by
mid-April. However, his injuries provide him
with a convenient platform to point the finger
at other people for his problems, including the
steroid scandal that has been bearing down on
him for the past month. For the time being,
too, it's worked — he's gotten his message out
to the world via Sports Center, and a lew peo
ple are starting to sympathize with him. That's
right. Barry Bonds, tortured soul, looks to you,
the public, for approval.
What I don't understand is how anyone be
lieves that Bonds would be willing to retire at
this point. Of course, he would love nothing
more than lor everyone to believe that those
nefarious leeches — the journalists — drove
him away from the sport he loved, causing so
much anguish for him and his family. But to
whom does that record matter the most? The
