## Right in the Babymaker Barry's threat to retire is a bluff 
### 
Wondering how the Giants will do with
Jason Ellison in left this season?
Thinking of selling your SBC Park
season tickets for San Jose Saber Cats seats?
Sobbing quietly and holding a razor to your
wrist over the sink because you spent your first
fantasy pick on Barry Bonds?
Don't sweat it.
Barry will be back this season for obvious
reasons, even despite his "Watch me retire —
I swear, I'll do it!" screed in Scottsdale last
week. By placing blame squarely on the media
for the hurricane of steroid accusations around
him. Bonds is starting a game of chicken that
he can't win. When he complained that a com
bination of knee problems and media-induced
stress would drive him into retirement, he was
essentially threatening to deny baseball fans

an opportunity to see the
home run record broken in
an attempt to paint himself as
someone who just doesn't
care enough to go on amidst
all the allegations.
Of course, that has all the
plausibility of Ron Artest
promising to behave.
If Bonds leaves, his legacy
will be that of a guy who

stepped down because he thought it would
make him look noble but ended up making
him the biggest waste of talent ever. Instead of
being a martyr. Bonds will wind up a pariah
and a self-imposed one, at that.
Barry's knees are rapidly healing, accord
ing to his manager, and he should be healthy by
mid-April. However, his injuries provide him
with a convenient platform to point the finger
at other people for his problems, including the
steroid scandal that has been bearing down on
him for the past month. For the time being,
too, it's worked — he's gotten his message out
to the world via Sports Center, and a lew peo
ple are starting to sympathize with him. That's
right. Barry Bonds, tortured soul, looks to you,
the public, for approval.
What I don't understand is how anyone be
lieves that Bonds would be willing to retire at
this point. Of course, he would love nothing
more than lor everyone to believe that those
nefarious leeches — the journalists — drove
him away from the sport he loved, causing so
much anguish for him and his family. But to
whom does that record matter the most? The

fans? In case Bonds hasn't noticed,
the American public's attention
span is not nearly long enough for
fans to spend time wailing over what
could have been. Hell, it's March,
and already last year's epic World
Series is ancient history.
It appears that there are no physi
cal problems stopping Bonds from
reaching the record, and so if he fails
to surpass it, it will weigh most heavi
ly not on the conscience of the fans or
the media, but on Barry himself. If we
have learned one thing from Bonds'
career, it is that the person to whom
Barry's accomplishments matter
most is clearly Barry, something that
the interview —in all its self-righ
teous glory — only solidified.
The best part of Bonds' explo
sion, though, was when he asked the
cameramen to step back and include
his son Nikolai in the frame in order
to "get my son in this, not me, be
cause I want to show the pain you've
caused my family." Yes. Barry. I'm
sure your son's pain is a result of the
media's slanderous speculation 011
whether his multimillionaire, world
famous father took steroids, rather
than the fact that his father allegedly
had a mistress and is using him as a
prop to gain public support. His son.
too, looked the part, staring listless
ly into the ground, probably bar
gaining with God to strike him dead
on the spot to prevent any further
embarrassment. Granted, Bonds
came off as a masterful director of
his little morality play, even dressing
Nikolai in a Barry Sanders jersey - a
calculated allusion to another super
star who retired early.
However, how staged does it look

when you're directing the cameras in
order to induce a particular reaction?
It seems that all Bonds wants to do is
put the fear of God into the media so
that they won't have poor ol' Barry to
needle anymore, as if the San Fran
cisco Chronicle doesn't have better
things to do than bring him down. 1
can just imagine the senior sports ed
itor leaning back in his chair and say
ing "Today's a slow news day ... let's
harass Barry Bonds fora while."
That's right, Barry. It was the
journalists who testified that they
used unknown substances; it was the
journalists who allied themselves
with a trainer whose associates were
of a less than sterling legal reputa
tion: and. lastly, it was the journalists
who dragged the woman claiming to
be your mistress out of hiding and
beat a statement out of her claiming
that you used steroids in the 19905.
It's all their fault. Now come on
back, please? All is forgiven.
This is precisely what Bonds
wants to hear. The gnashing of teeth
of thousands of Giants fans and
those who want him to break the
record is music to his ears. Having
realized that he is on the final steps
toward baseball's most sacred altar,
he plans to use exactly that status to
clear his name.
I love you, Barry. Love your .609
OBP. your 45 home runs and the way
you put the Giants on your back last
year and carried them to within a
Dustin Hermanson of the playoffs.
But if you think baseball fans can't
live without you, you are sorely mis
taken. However, since most of us
have called your bluff, it makes no
sense for you to retire. So see you out
there, good luck at the plate and good
luck in the courtroom. You'll need it.

Dan McCarthy is a junior who is a
"Harry-hating douche." Thanks,
