### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team's two star
competitors, co-captains Matt Gentry and
Imad Kharbush. fought hard but fell short
of their ultimate goals of individual nation
al titles in St. Louis over a week ago. De
spite going down in the tournament, both
wrestlers can look back on great seasons
for the Cardinal (6-7-1, 2-5-2 Pacific-10
Conference), and for Gentry, a senior, a
great collegiate career.
After a first-round bye, the 174-pound
Kharbush won his first match in a 4-1 deci
sion over Eastern Illinois' Kenny Robert
son. The junior continued with a 16-7 drub
bing of Northwestern's Jake Herbert in his
next bout.
The fourth round would be the begin
ning of the end as Kharbush fell 15-4 to
Cornell's Joe Mazzurco. In the consolation
bracket, Kharbush dropped a razor-thin 3-
2 decision to Mitch Hancock of Central
Michigan. That loss eliminated Kharbush

from competition and dropped him to hon
orable mention Ail-American status.
"All in all, it was bittersweet," Khar
bush said. "It definitely did a lot for my
confidence. The tournament showed me
that I'm at a level I need to be at to be a na
tional champion. Obviously though, it was
really disappointing to lose to a lower seed
in my third match. It was even more disap
pointing in my fourth match to lose a shot
at being an Ail-American."
Gentry began his title defense at an
amazing pace. After his own first-round
bye. the third seed put on back-to-back
clinics, earning 15-0 technical falls against
Danny Clum of Wyoming in five minutes
and then Matt Hill of Edinboro in three
minutes and 2 { ) seconds.
On the second day of competition. Gen
try was matched up against sixth-seeded
Trent Paulson of lowa State. The Cardinal
co-captain defeated Paulson via a 5-1 deci
sion in the semifinals of the Midlands Invi-
