### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team's two star
competitors, co-captains Matt Gentry and
Imad Kharbush. fought hard but fell short
of their ultimate goals of individual nation
al titles in St. Louis over a week ago. De
spite going down in the tournament, both
wrestlers can look back on great seasons
for the Cardinal (6-7-1, 2-5-2 Pacific-10
Conference), and for Gentry, a senior, a
great collegiate career.
After a first-round bye, the 174-pound
Kharbush won his first match in a 4-1 deci
sion over Eastern Illinois' Kenny Robert
son. The junior continued with a 16-7 drub
bing of Northwestern's Jake Herbert in his
next bout.
The fourth round would be the begin
ning of the end as Kharbush fell 15-4 to
Cornell's Joe Mazzurco. In the consolation
bracket, Kharbush dropped a razor-thin 3-
2 decision to Mitch Hancock of Central
Michigan. That loss eliminated Kharbush

from competition and dropped him to hon
orable mention Ail-American status.
"All in all, it was bittersweet," Khar
bush said. "It definitely did a lot for my
confidence. The tournament showed me
that I'm at a level I need to be at to be a na
tional champion. Obviously though, it was
really disappointing to lose to a lower seed
in my third match. It was even more disap
pointing in my fourth match to lose a shot
at being an Ail-American."
Gentry began his title defense at an
amazing pace. After his own first-round
bye. the third seed put on back-to-back
clinics, earning 15-0 technical falls against
Danny Clum of Wyoming in five minutes
and then Matt Hill of Edinboro in three
minutes and 2 { ) seconds.
On the second day of competition. Gen
try was matched up against sixth-seeded
Trent Paulson of lowa State. The Cardinal
co-captain defeated Paulson via a 5-1 deci
sion in the semifinals of the Midlands Invi-

Senior Matt Gentry failed to repeat his NCAA title performance on March 18.
tational Tournament this past win
ter. Both 157 pounders battled hard
to a 6-6 tie at the end of regulation.
In overtime. Paulson was able to se
cure the upset by scoring a takedown
fora sudden victory decision, 8-6.
The painfully close defeat ended
the senior's quest at repeating as na
tional champion, and Gentry en
tered the consolation bracket to face
seventh-seeded Matt Lebe of West
Virginia. The Cardinal co-captain
had another tight battle and once
again the match was deadlocked,
this time at three. Lebe scored a
takedown fora 5-3 sudden victory
decision.
"On the first day 1 was wrestling
really well and I won my first two
matches 15-0, which is a technical
fall, and that doesn't happen very
often in the NCAAs, so I was
happy," Gentry said. "On the sec
ond day, I just had an off day. 1 wres
tled two guys who 1 had beaten be
fore, and 1 lost to them in overtime. I
didn't wrestle my best, and to win
the NC'AAs you need to wrestle at
your best."
Gentry ended his collegiate ca
reer short of where he wished, but
the 157 pounder will remain a Cardi
nal wrestling legend. Gentry holds
the school's all-time and consecutive
wins records and remains Stanford's
only wrestling national champion.
"I guess some career highlights
would be obviously winning a na
tional title, and being Pac-10 cham

pion and Pac-1() wrestler of the year
last year," Gentry said. "But other
highlights would be the fight. It's
winning the close matches, [or]
fighting in the tough matches and
pulling it (nit. I guess I would want
my legacy to be someone who
worked hard and was exciting to
watch."
Though this was his last wrestling
for the Cardinal, Gentry will try to
continue his career in international
wrestling.
"I'm looking to see where I'll be
wrestling next year," Gentry said.
"They have some Olympic hopeful
programs in different places around
the country and I will visit them this
spring."
The Cardinal will try to tap their
young talent next year, in an attempt
to make up for the loss of Gentry,
125-pound starter senior Nathan Pe
terson and the other seniors.
Leading the charge will be Khar
bush. The Stanford grapplers will re
turn many starters next year and hit
the offseason not only training phys
ically, but also focusing on mental
improvement.
"1 think for me personally, I've
been physically prepared to wrestle
since 1 entered college." Kharbush
said. "I was lacking the confidence
and mental game and now 1 think
I'm there, and that will be the differ
ence between this year and next
year. Collectively, I'd like to see a lot
more emphasis on the team. If our
team works together, even though
this is an individual sport, we can be
firing on all 10 cylinders. If we're all
on the same page going into dual
meets. I think we can have more suc
cess next season."
