# Baseball upset by Pacific in extras
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
By the end of the ninth inning, most of the
fans had disappeared. The No. 12 Cardinal's
make-up matchup against Pacific had been a
revolving door of new pitchers, weak bats
and zeros dancing across the scoreboard.
The scoreless tie was taken all the way into
the l()th frame — making it the first extra
inning game of the season for the Cardinal
(14-9) — when UOP outfielder Matt
Bere/ay finally undid the knot. After going
0-for-4 in the first nine frames, the utility
man performed in a clutch bases-loaded sit
uation. dropping a two-RBI single into right
field for the 2-0 win.

The game had nearly ended a few batters
earlier, when Pacific loaded up the bases on
Stanford hurler Jeff Stimpson's watch.
Tigers outfielder Ramon Glasgow hit a
chopper to junior Jed Lowrie, who threw off
balance to home plate. UOP's run was called
safe on the grounds that Stanford catcher
John Hester had bobbled the throw, but an
appeal overturned the call. The Pacific
bench was outraged, and the game resumed
its 0-0 status.
The Cardinal took the series 2-1. having
locked up the series victory last week.
The game was ultimately a battle on the
mound, as bats proved dull weapons for the
night.
Sophomores Matt Leva and Greg

Reynolds and freshman Nolan Gallagher
combined for five perfect innings, relying on
the gloves of the outfielders to bring down
fly balls and collect outs. Freshman Erik
Davis had a little less luck, giving up the first
three Tiger hits of the game in the sixth
frame to load the bases. But the righthander
was still able to keep the line of zeros parad
ing on the scoreboard.
Pacific's hurlers were much less dominant
for most of the game, allowing a hit here and
there, though nothing that the Cardinal
could convert into a run. However, when the
Tigers' fiercest pitcher, closer Josh Schmidt,
flew in from the bullpen with a 0.62 ERA in
Pacific scores two in the tenth to win

29 innings to his name, the
ballgame could have be
longed to either team.
Despite being held hitless
for the first six frames of the
contest, by the end of the
game Pacific had out-hit Stan
ford by a 9-4 margin. More
than hall of the Tigers' big
hits came from the smallest
parts of their lineup. Glas
gow, Adam Ching and An
thony Jackson, all listed at 5-
foot-8 and appearing to
match the kneeling height of
Cardinal catcher Hester,
managed a combined six base
knocks on the night.
The cold, windy weather
hugged Sunken Diamond all
night, keeping every fly ball
inside the park and hindering
the Cardinal's offensive pro
duction. Lowrie had half of
Stanford's four base knocks,
while sophomore Jim
Rapoport and junior Chris
Lewis chipped in the others.
The Cardinal had a series
of opportunities to take over
the game, but each one was
blown. Stanford loaded the
bases in the eighth and had
two on in the third and sixth,
but the Cardinal simply
couldn't find their swing. A
one-two-three bottom of the
tenth sealed their fate.
The contest was Stanford's
last before the beginning of
the Pacific-10 Conference
schedule. The Cardinal will
face the Washington State
Cougars (15-13) in a three
game series this weekend in
Pullman. Wash.
