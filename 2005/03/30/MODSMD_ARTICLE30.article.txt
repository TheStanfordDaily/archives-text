### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
So close, hut not close enough was the
story for the No. 16 Stanford men's tennis
team yesterday. After a rough road trip
over spring break, the Cardinal (9-7, 1-1
Pacific-10 Conference) returned yester
day to Taube Tennis Stadium to face No.
2 Illinois and almost pulled off a huge
upset. However, Illinois managed to
bounce back from a loss last weekend to
No. 7 Pepperdine and edged out the Car
dinal. 4-3.
Prior to the match, head coach John
Whitlinger said, "| Illinois is] a very talent
ed team, from top to bottom. It's going to
take a great effort to beat them."
The Cardinal put forth a great effort
but in the end came up short.
The Fighting Illini claimed the doubles
point by marking wins at the first and sec
ond doubles positions, 8-6 and 8-1, re
spectively. At the third doubles spot,
Stanford sophomores Eric McKean and
James Wan tallied an 8-4 win.
In singles play, the Cardinal and the Illi
ni each picked up a win early in the match
â€” Stanford senior Sam Warburg winning
6-4, 6-0 and the lllini's Ruben Gonzales
beating freshman Phil Kao 6-4,6-2.
McKean then rebounded from a 6-1
first set loss to claim the second and third
sets and even the score at 2-2. Junior KC

Corkery picked up a 7-5, 5-7, 6-2 win as
well to place the Cardinal within one
match of an upset victory. After winning
the first set 6-4, senior Phil Sheng lost the
second set in a tiebreaker and gave up the
third set to tie the match count at three
apiece.
All eyes were on the third singles posi
tion, with Wan and his opponent battling
in the deciding match. After losing the
first set. Wan gained control of the match
and claimed the second set 6-4. With the
Cardinal leading 4-2 in the third set. fans
wondered if Stanford would be able to
pull off the win. However, Illinois proved
worthy of its ranking as Kevin Anderson
dug deep and won the next four games
and consequently the match for Illinois.
The three matches played over spring
break helped Stanford prepare for its im
pressive showing yesterday.
Because Stanford's match against
Santa Clara was postponed due to in
clement weather, the team's first matchup
during spring break was against top
ranked Baylor. The final scoreboard
marked a 7-0 loss to the Bears, but the
Cardinal competed fiercely early in their
matches. However, once the Bears
grabbed on to the match, they held on
tight and didn't let go.
"1 really liked the way Baylor played."
