## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
So close, hut not close enough was the
story for the No. 16 Stanford men's tennis
team yesterday. After a rough road trip
over spring break, the Cardinal (9-7, 1-1
Pacific-10 Conference) returned yester
day to Taube Tennis Stadium to face No.
2 Illinois and almost pulled off a huge
upset. However, Illinois managed to
bounce back from a loss last weekend to
No. 7 Pepperdine and edged out the Car
dinal. 4-3.
Prior to the match, head coach John
Whitlinger said, "| Illinois is] a very talent
ed team, from top to bottom. It's going to
take a great effort to beat them."
The Cardinal put forth a great effort
but in the end came up short.
The Fighting Illini claimed the doubles
point by marking wins at the first and sec
ond doubles positions, 8-6 and 8-1, re
spectively. At the third doubles spot,
Stanford sophomores Eric McKean and
James Wan tallied an 8-4 win.
In singles play, the Cardinal and the Illi
ni each picked up a win early in the match
— Stanford senior Sam Warburg winning
6-4, 6-0 and the lllini's Ruben Gonzales
beating freshman Phil Kao 6-4,6-2.
McKean then rebounded from a 6-1
first set loss to claim the second and third
sets and even the score at 2-2. Junior KC

Corkery picked up a 7-5, 5-7, 6-2 win as
well to place the Cardinal within one
match of an upset victory. After winning
the first set 6-4, senior Phil Sheng lost the
second set in a tiebreaker and gave up the
third set to tie the match count at three
apiece.
All eyes were on the third singles posi
tion, with Wan and his opponent battling
in the deciding match. After losing the
first set. Wan gained control of the match
and claimed the second set 6-4. With the
Cardinal leading 4-2 in the third set. fans
wondered if Stanford would be able to
pull off the win. However, Illinois proved
worthy of its ranking as Kevin Anderson
dug deep and won the next four games
and consequently the match for Illinois.
The three matches played over spring
break helped Stanford prepare for its im
pressive showing yesterday.
Because Stanford's match against
Santa Clara was postponed due to in
clement weather, the team's first matchup
during spring break was against top
ranked Baylor. The final scoreboard
marked a 7-0 loss to the Bears, but the
Cardinal competed fiercely early in their
matches. However, once the Bears
grabbed on to the match, they held on
tight and didn't let go.
"1 really liked the way Baylor played."

The Cardinal led Illinois, 3-2, but dropped their final
two matches to the Fighting lllini to narrowly miss pul
lling off the upset.
Whitlinger said. "We were pretty
competitive in most of [the first
sets], but once they got on top of us,
they just didn't let us get into the
match at all. That's what a good
team does — once they've got you
down, they don't let you up, and
Baylor did that."
The momentum swung Baylor's
way beginning with doubles as the
defending national champions tal
lied wins at the No. 2 and 3 spots.
"In doubles, I think we got off to
a pretty bad start." Wan said. "We
never got our feet set, and 1 guess
they just kind of rolled on us."
Although the doubles point had
been decided and despite the
stands packed with fans in green
and yellow waving signs, the third
ranked pair of Warburg and Cork
ery defeated the fifth-ranked duo
of Benedikt Dorsch and Matija
Zgaga, 8-6.
"I feel KC and I got off to a good
start," Warburg said. "We held
serve and we made pretty clear if
they were going to beat us, it would
have to be in a tiebreaker. Then we
did a good job of breaking when we
had the opportunity later in the
match."
Despite some close first sets,
Baylor clinched five of the singles
matches in straight sets. At the sec
ond singles position, Corkery won
his first set 6-3 but proceeded to lose
the second in a tiebreaker; thejunior
then lost the super-tiebreaker for
the third, thus completing the Bay
lor sweep.
"In singles, I definitely think it
was a result of having three weeks of
no matches," Warburg said. "It real
ly showed that our conditioning had
gone away from us a little bit. You
can't take three weeks off and then
all of a sudden be able to turn it on
against the number one team in the
country; you have to prepare bet
ter."
Only two days later, the Cardi
nal traveled north to take on then-
No. 19 Washington. In both teams'
Pac-1() opener, the Cardinal
dropped all three doubles matches
for the first time this season. Sur
prising was the upset at the top
doubles position where unranked
Huskies Daniel Chu and Alex
Slovic handed Corkery and War

burg an 8-2 loss, snapping the duo's
18-match winning streak and hand
ing the pair their first dual match
defeat of the season.
"It was one of those matches
where we couldn't get anything
going and they seemed to not miss,"
Warburg said.
Washington then claimed four
singles matches to tally a 5-2 win.
Wan won a decisive 6-0, 6-1 victory
to even the match. However. Cork
ery and Sheng were defeated in
straight sets to give Washington the
lead. McKean split sets at the No. 5
singles position but fell 4-6, 6-4. 6-2
in the deciding match. Kao split
sets at the No. 6 spot but was hand
ed a loss as well after a narrow third
set with a final score of 6-1,6-7,6-4.
At the top singles position, War
burg split sets as well and wks lead
ing 7-2 in the super-tiebreaker be
fore his opponent retired due to
cramping.
"1 was surprised that we lost to
Washington." Wan said. "We had
really close matches down at five
and six. and KC could have won at
two. I was surprised we didn't win
some of those matches."
Whitlinger shared similar senti
ments.
"We just didn't come out as sharp
as I would have liked to have seen,"
he said. "I've got to give Washington
credit: they did a good job. I was dis
appointed with our performance in
that match; I think we could have
done a better job but we didn't."
The following day, the team'
headed to Oregon and picked up a
Pac-1() win with its 6-1 defeat of the
Ducks. The Cardinal took an early
lead by clinching the doubles point
by winning two of the three doubles
matches. Corkery and Warburg tal
lied an 8-6 win at the top doubles po
sition, and the pairing of McKean
and Wan notched a 9-8 win to help
the Cardinal pick up the doubles
point.
Warburg. Corkery. Wan and Kao
marked straight set wins in singles at
the first, second, fourth and sixth po
sitions, respectively. McKean split
sets and won his third set super
tiebreaker while Sheng tallied a loss
in three sets.
"I really liked the way we came
back on Saturday," Whitlinger said.
"The guys were a little disappointed
[after Friday's match], but they
came out and played very well on
Saturday. It wasn't a great road trip,
but it was a good way to end that
road trip."
