## 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over spring break, the men's and women's track
and field teams did not have much of a rest. After
triumphs and letdowns at the 2005 NCAA Indoor
Track and Field Nationals before final exams, the
outdoor season continued last week at the Stanford
Invite.
At the NCAA Indoor Championships, both the
men and women saw positive and negative results,
but the men did much better then expected accord
ing to head coach Robert Weir.
"Indoor nationals was great because we had a
team that wasn't even ranked in the top 25.and we
finished a respectable 13th." Weir said.
The men were led by the stellar performances of
senior lan Dobson and the distance medley relay
team. Dobson won the 5,000 meters in a time of

-13:43.36. making him the fastest collegiate indoor
5.0(H) runner in the country.
"Lan Dobson is a terrific racer," Weir said. "He
came in not picked as a favorite."
The DMR. made up of redshirt freshman Rus
sell Brown, sophomore Joaquin Chapa, redshirt
freshman Michael Garcia and senior Nick Sebes,
finished fourth in 9:33.55, scoring valuable points
for the men's team.
For the women, the NCAAs were a trying
weekend, filled with adrenaline and emotion. The
women were contenders for the team title, but
came away with an eighth-place finish. But head
coach Edrick Floreal said he is optimistic about the
results.
"As bad of a finish as that was for us. that is what
will make us a whole lot hungrier and feistier dur
ing this outdoor season," Floreal said. "We really
came together and overcame adversity, and out

door is going to be better because of this."
The women saw a number of great perfor
mances at the championships.
Freshman Erica McLain finished second and
eighth in the triple jump and long jump, respective
ly, and became the first freshman in Stanford histo
ry' to become a two-time all American. Her triple
jump was 44' 8.25".
"Erica did a fantastic job," Floreal said. "She
might have had the best ever freshman finish in the
history of the program."
Coming off a disappointing mile run that failed
to qualify her for the finals, sophomore Katy Trot
ter performed well in the 3000 the following day,
finishing fifth in a time of 9:26.10.
"Katy embodies what the program is all about,"
Floreal said. "It is about making mistakes and corn-

ing back when it matters."
Junior Alicia Craig was competi
tive as always, finishing fourth in the
5.000 meters, in a time of 16:00.07.
Senior Sara Bei made a huge con
tribution to the success of the
women's DMR. as did senior Chris
tine Moschella. Moschella brought
the team from seventh to second on
her leg. The DMR, made up of Trot
ter, Moschella, junior Chinny Olfor
and Bei finished third with ;t time of
11:08.81.
The mile relay was disqualified
after officials ruled that Moschella in
terfered with a Clemson runner, but
Floreal said he still sees the race as a
good one.
"At a championship meet the mo

mentum is strong," Floreal said. "The
indoor track is a lot smaller too, so
there is much more contact between
the runners."
While the time was disqualified,
the relay beat the school record by
two seconds, and gave the Stanford
runners a valuable lesson.
"We had a few bad breaks, but we
need the experience in order to de
velop," Floreal said. "Many of these
women have never been in the posi
tion to win. so the meet was appropri
ate to toughen us up."
The Stanford Invite, held on
March 25 and 26. brought the out
door track season into full swing, with
more than 4.000 athletes competing
on the Cobb Track and Angell Field.
It was a stellar opener for both the
men's and women's teams.
Freshman Wopamo Osaisai fin
ished third in the men's 100-meter
dash in 10.45, and seniors Sebes and
Curt Goehrini; had first and second

400-meter dash.
Sophomore Brett Gotcher ran a
Regional qualifying time in the
l(),(KM), and redshirt freshman Nef
talem Araia and senior Chris Emme
qualified in the 5,000.
Sophomore Jon Pierce had a
strong performance in the men's
3,000-meter Steeplechase, in which
the runners complete seven laps
around the track while jumping over
eight obstacles.
For the throwers, redshirt fresh
man Mike Macellari earned an out
door personal best in the shot put.
and junior Michael Robertson threw
the third all-time longest discuss
throw in Stanford history.
The women had similar success.
Sophomore Janice Davis won both
the 1(H)- and 200-meter dash, qualify
ing for Regionals in both. Junior
Nashonme Johnson won the 4(H) and
sophomore Ashleigh Purnell finished

second in the 200. Both qualified for

in a time of 3:36.84.
Both Bei and Trotter qualified for

This weekend a handful of Stan
ford athletes will compete at the Uni
versity of Texas-Arlington and the
Johnny Matis meet at San Francisco
State.
Over spring break, the men's and women's track
and field teams did not have much of a rest. After
triumphs and letdowns at the 2005 NCAA Indoor
Track and Field Nationals before final exams, the
outdoor season continued last week at the Stanford
Invite.
At the NCAA Indoor Championships, both the
men and women saw positive and negative results,
but the men did much better then expected accord
ing to head coach Robert Weir.
"Indoor nationals was great because we had a
team that wasn't even ranked in the top 25.and we
finished a respectable 13th." Weir said.
The men were led by the stellar performances of
senior lan Dobson and the distance medley relay
team. Dobson won the 5,000 meters in a time of

-13:43.36. making him the fastest collegiate indoor
5.0(H) runner in the country.
"Lan Dobson is a terrific racer," Weir said. "He
came in not picked as a favorite."
The DMR. made up of redshirt freshman Rus
sell Brown, sophomore Joaquin Chapa, redshirt
freshman Michael Garcia and senior Nick Sebes,
finished fourth in 9:33.55, scoring valuable points
for the men's team.
For the women, the NCAAs were a trying
weekend, filled with adrenaline and emotion. The
women were contenders for the team title, but
came away with an eighth-place finish. But head
coach Edrick Floreal said he is optimistic about the
results.
"As bad of a finish as that was for us. that is what
will make us a whole lot hungrier and feistier dur
ing this outdoor season," Floreal said. "We really
came together and overcame adversity, and out

door is going to be better because of this."
The women saw a number of great perfor
mances at the championships.
Freshman Erica McLain finished second and
eighth in the triple jump and long jump, respective
ly, and became the first freshman in Stanford histo
ry' to become a two-time all American. Her triple
jump was 44' 8.25".
"Erica did a fantastic job," Floreal said. "She
might have had the best ever freshman finish in the
history of the program."
Coming off a disappointing mile run that failed
to qualify her for the finals, sophomore Katy Trot
ter performed well in the 3000 the following day,
finishing fifth in a time of 9:26.10.
"Katy embodies what the program is all about,"
Floreal said. "It is about making mistakes and corn-

ing back when it matters."
Junior Alicia Craig was competi
tive as always, finishing fourth in the
5.000 meters, in a time of 16:00.07.
Senior Sara Bei made a huge con
tribution to the success of the
women's DMR. as did senior Chris
tine Moschella. Moschella brought
the team from seventh to second on
her leg. The DMR, made up of Trot
ter, Moschella, junior Chinny Olfor
and Bei finished third with ;t time of
11:08.81.
The mile relay was disqualified
after officials ruled that Moschella in
terfered with a Clemson runner, but
Floreal said he still sees the race as a
good one.
"At a championship meet the mo

mentum is strong," Floreal said. "The
indoor track is a lot smaller too, so
there is much more contact between
the runners."
While the time was disqualified,
the relay beat the school record by
two seconds, and gave the Stanford
runners a valuable lesson.
"We had a few bad breaks, but we
need the experience in order to de
velop," Floreal said. "Many of these
women have never been in the posi
tion to win. so the meet was appropri
ate to toughen us up."
The Stanford Invite, held on
March 25 and 26. brought the out
door track season into full swing, with
more than 4.000 athletes competing
on the Cobb Track and Angell Field.
It was a stellar opener for both the
men's and women's teams.
Freshman Wopamo Osaisai fin
ished third in the men's 100-meter
dash in 10.45, and seniors Sebes and
Curt Goehrini; had first and second

place finishes, respectively, in the
400-meter dash.
Sophomore Brett Gotcher ran a
Regional qualifying time in the
l(),(KM), and redshirt freshman Nef
talem Araia and senior Chris Emme
qualified in the 5,000.
Sophomore Jon Pierce had a
strong performance in the men's
3,000-meter Steeplechase, in which
the runners complete seven laps
around the track while jumping over
eight obstacles.
For the throwers, redshirt fresh
man Mike Macellari earned an out
door personal best in the shot put.
and junior Michael Robertson threw
the third all-time longest discuss
throw in Stanford history.
The women had similar success.
Sophomore Janice Davis won both
the 1(H)- and 200-meter dash, qualify
ing for Regionals in both. Junior

sophomore Ashleigh Purnell finished

second in the 200. Both qualified for

man and Johnson earned an impres
sive second-place finish behind USC
in a time of 3:36.84.
Both Bei and Trotter qualified for
Regionals in the 1.5(H) meters and ju
nior Anita Siraki automatically qual
ified for the outdoor championships
in the 10.000. Sophomore Teresa
McWalters also qualified in the 5.000.
Floreal said he was impressed with
freshman Lindsay Allen's perfor
mance in the 3,000-meter
Steeplechase, while freshman Lind
say Oannaway jumped a personal
best in the high jump to qualify for
Regionals.
