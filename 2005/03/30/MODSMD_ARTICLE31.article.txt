### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over spring break, the men's and women's track
and field teams did not have much of a rest. After
triumphs and letdowns at the 2005 NCAA Indoor
Track and Field Nationals before final exams, the
outdoor season continued last week at the Stanford
Invite.
At the NCAA Indoor Championships, both the
men and women saw positive and negative results,
but the men did much better then expected accord
ing to head coach Robert Weir.
"Indoor nationals was great because we had a
team that wasn't even ranked in the top 25.and we
finished a respectable 13th." Weir said.
The men were led by the stellar performances of
senior lan Dobson and the distance medley relay
team. Dobson won the 5,000 meters in a time of

-13:43.36. making him the fastest collegiate indoor
5.0(H) runner in the country.
"Lan Dobson is a terrific racer," Weir said. "He
came in not picked as a favorite."
The DMR. made up of redshirt freshman Rus

women were contenders for the team title, but

coach Edrick Floreal said he is optimistic about the
results.
"As bad of a finish as that was for us. that is what

came together and overcame adversity, and out

door is going to be better because of this."
The women saw a number of great perfor
mances at the championships.
Freshman Erica McLain finished second and
eighth in the triple jump and long jump, respective
ly, and became the first freshman in Stanford histo
ry' to become a two-time all American. Her triple
jump was 44' 8.25".
"Erica did a fantastic job," Floreal said. "She
might have had the best ever freshman finish in the
history of the program."
Coming off a disappointing mile run that failed
to qualify her for the finals, sophomore Katy Trot
ter performed well in the 3000 the following day,
finishing fifth in a time of 9:26.10.
"Katy embodies what the program is all about,"
Floreal said. "It is about making mistakes and corn-
