# Cardinal fall to Pepperdine, beat USC
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITER 
It was a predictable spring break
road trip for the men's volleyball
team.
After the loss to No. 1 Pepper

dine (17-1, 17-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) — though it was
followed by a win over the unranked
USC Trojans (7-19, 3-15 MPSF)-
Cardinal ( l M MPSF) this week
slid to No. 10 in the national polls.
In the opening game against the

Waves last Friday, Stanford took
Pepperdine by surprise with a 30-23
victory.
"We were out of sync in game
one: everyone was on a little differ
ent timing." Pepperdine senior Sean
Rooney told College Sports Online.

"As the match wore on, we started to
find our rhythm on offense and with
the block. The block really started to
shut [Stanford] down and helped
turn the game around."
In fact, at the end of the match,
the Waves had 17 team blocks to
the Cardinal's three. Fighting back
from its loss in game one. Pepper
dine held Stanford to a mere .027
hitting percentage in the second
game. The Waves were up 15-9
early in that game and extended
their lead to 10 points at 27-17.
Stanford rallied toward the end but
could not make up the difference,
falling 21-30.
Struggling to regain control of
the match, the Cardinal gained a
15-13 lead in game three when Pep
perdine scored 10 unanswered
points. The Waves closed out that
game on a 5-1 run, making the final
score 21 -30.
On the brink of defeat, Stanford
struggled to stop Pepperdine's mo
mentum in game four. Although the
Waves claimed the lead early, the
Cardinal brought the game to within
one point, 24-25. Ultimately, the
Pepperdine block was too strong,
and Stanford was never able to take
the lead, falling just 27-30 to lose the
match.
Junior Ben Reddy led the Cardi
nal with 17 kills, followed by junior
Chris Ahlfeldt with 14 and senior
Craig Buell with 10. Defensively,
sophomore Brian Lindberg and se
nior David Vogel both had 14 digs.
Redshirt senior Kevin Hansen was
an all-around contributor, with 52
assists and 11 digs.
Having put up a solid effort
against the top-ranked Waves, the
Cardinal were prepared to take on
the unranked Trojans the following
evening.
It was a repeat of the Pepperdine
game with the roles reversed, as
Stanford was the higher-ranked
team that lost the first game of the
match.
In the second game, USC had a
20-18 lead when Stanford head
coach Don Shaw called a timeout.
The Cardinal jumped back into the
game to score four consecutive
points and eventually win the game
30-27.
Stanford built on this momentum
in game three, winning 30-23, and fi
nally closed out the match with a 30-
22 win in game four.
All five of the Cardinal attackers
recorded double-digit kills, led by
Vogel with 19. Reddy had 12, while
Ahlfeldt. Buell and redshirt junior
William Clayton each had 10 kills, in
large part due to Hansen's 53 assists.
Also in double-digits was the libero,
Lindberg. with 10 digs.
It was the second-to-last road trip
for the Cardinal this season.
