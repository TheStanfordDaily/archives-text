# Stem cell institute distributes funds
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Since the November passage of Proposition 71, the Cal
ifornia Stem Cell Research and Cures Initiative, the brand
new California Institute of Regenerative Medicine, or
CIRM, has been gearing up to invest $3 billion in stem cell
research via universities and research institutions.
After a day-long meeting on March 1 at Stanford, the
CIRM's governing board appointed Dr. Zach Hall as inter
im president of the CIRM, temporarily headquartered
across the bay in Emeryville.
"The chance to participate in such a bold, extraordinary
venture that couples state-of-the art science with radical
new therapies for diseases that currently have no effective
therapies is a wonderful opportunity," Hall said in an inter
view with The Daily."The idea that the people of the state
of California would invest $3 billion in stem cell research is
indicative of the enthusiasm and hope they have for this
project."
Hall identified Stanford as one of the leading universities
in stem cell research and anticipated that many Stanford sci
entists will apply to the institute for funding.
"The Institute is looking to Stanford for leadership in
formulating ideas because of Stanford scientists, such as Dr.
Irving Weissman, who have galvanized the community of
stem cell researchers," Hall said.
Hall and his colleagues plan to meet with Weissman —
director of Stanford's Institute for Cancer / Stem Cell Biol
ogy — and other members of the Stanford community
soon.
Since 2003, the CIRM, one of the University's four insti
tutes of medicine, has brought "together basic and clinical
scientists with an interest in stem cell and cancer research,"
Philip Pizzo, dean of the Stanford
Medical School and member of the
OR Ms board.
"In the foreseeable future it is ex
pected that investigators in Stanford
Institute for Cancer / Stem Cell Biol
ogy will receive funding from com
petitive grant applications to the
CIRM," Pizzo said.
He added that he is very opti
mistic about Stanford's innovative
contributions to stem cell research.
"We are fortunate to have ex
traordinary faculty committed to
the area of stem cell research al
ready present at Stanford, and we
are in the process of recruiting a
small number of individuals who
will even further extend out re
search expertise," Pizzo said. "It is
clear that the funding that the In
stitute will make available will
have a transformative impact on
the entire field and that California
and Stanford will truly be at the
epicenter of innovation and dis
covery in stem cell biology and
medicine."
Pizzo said he believes that Prop.
71 should fund efforts to encourage
more students to become stem cell
researchers.
"We need to learn much more
about stem cell biology — how to
jirow stem cells, how thev work and

self-renew and what that tells us
about the process of organ and
body system development," he
said. "We need to bring these dis
coveries to improve the lives of
people."
William Hurlbut, a professor of
human biology who teaches sever
al courses on biomedical ethics,
said he hopes that the funds will be
"used for research that seeks a
technological solution to our ethi
cal impasse over embryonic stem
cell research."
Hurlbut, who serves on the Presi
dent's Council on Bioethies. said
that "the Council is working on a re
port that includes several sugges
tions for such a solution." One of
these proposals, put forth by Hurl
but. is called Altered Nuclear Trans
fer. which would produce embryonic
stem cells without the formation of
an actual embryo.
"I believe that with a construc
tive conversation and creative sci
ence we could find a way to get
these cells that does not require the
destruction of human embryos,"
Hurlbut said. "This would preserve
our most fundamental moral prin
ciple — the defense of human life
— while opening positive
prospects for the future of biomed
ical science."
Hall said he believes that the
CIRM will "push forward the pace of
research for stem cell biology and
medicine as researchers gain greater
understanding of how stem cells op

erate in our bodies both to form and
repair our organs and tissues."
He added that California's in
volvement in this emerging field
would make it the world center for
stem cell research.
Hall also said that he has been
contacted by scientists and other
interested parties from Sweden,
Scotland, Singapore and South
Korea regarding the CIRM and its
work.
Gerald Dodson, an attorney at
the Palo Alto Office of Morrison
and Foerster who has worked with
Hall on patent litigation, noted that
Hall was "great to work with —
knowledgeable, cotlegial and deter
mined to obtain a positive out
come."
"1 was very impressed with his
knowledge of the science, negotiat
ing skills and his passionate commit
ment to the ideals of academic sci
ence during the process," Dodson
said. "The new Institute needs a
leader with a commitment to the
ideals of basic research and Zach has
that commitment."
Both Hall and Pizzo said the re
cent developments in stem cell biol
ogy are making a significant impact
on knowledge of human develop
ment and treatments for serious dis
eases.
"1 am pleased that we will be able
to carry out this important research
and proud that the citizens of Cali
fornia had the courage and vision to
help support it," Pizzo said.

The James H. Clark Center, home of fhe Bio-X program, is the major site for stem cell research on campus and
promises to become one of the key facilities for these studies in the state.
