# Stem cell institute distributes funds

### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Since the November passage of Proposition 71, the Cal
ifornia Stem Cell Research and Cures Initiative, the brand
new California Institute of Regenerative Medicine, or
CIRM, has been gearing up to invest $3 billion in stem cell
research via universities and research institutions.
After a day-long meeting on March 1 at Stanford, the
CIRM's governing board appointed Dr. Zach Hall as inter
im president of the CIRM, temporarily headquartered
across the bay in Emeryville.
"The chance to participate in such a bold, extraordinary
venture that couples state-of-the art science with radical
new therapies for diseases that currently have no effective
therapies is a wonderful opportunity," Hall said in an inter
view with The Daily."The idea that the people of the state
of California would invest $3 billion in stem cell research is
indicative of the enthusiasm and hope they have for this
project."
Hall identified Stanford as one of the leading universities
in stem cell research and anticipated that many Stanford sci
entists will apply to the institute for funding.
"The Institute is looking to Stanford for leadership in
formulating ideas because of Stanford scientists, such as Dr.
Irving Weissman, who have galvanized the community of
stem cell researchers," Hall said.
Hall and his colleagues plan to meet with Weissman —
director of Stanford's Institute for Cancer / Stem Cell Biol
ogy — and other members of the Stanford community
soon.
Since 2003, the CIRM, one of the University's four insti
tutes of medicine, has brought "together basic and clinical
scientists with an interest in stem cell and cancer research,"
