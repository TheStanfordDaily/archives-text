# Seniors get real, learn life skills
## 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The real world is about to get a
little less scary for seniors.
Senior class presidents are team
ing up with Stanford Dining and
the University's Parents' Club to
present a seminar series, aptly ti
tled "The Real World," designed to
equip seniors with the skills they'll
need to survive after graduation.
"It's a way to teach some practi
cal stuff in a fun and social way,"
said senior Jen Graham, one of the
class presidents and the om
budsperson for The Daily.
Three seminars are planned for
Tuesdays this quarter, the first of
which will take place April 19 and

focus on cooking basics. Parents
have donated recipes to be taught
and Stanford Dining has worked to
make the recipes practical for the
150 seniors who have signed up to
attend.
"We could not have done this
without Stanford Dining," Graham
said. "The core of the manpower
for this [event] has really been
Stanford parents volunteering their
time."
One parent even volunteered to
fly from Pennsylvania to partici
pate in the event, said Marijke Val
iaeys, president of the Parents'
Club.
"Everybody is really excited
about it and really wants to make it
successful and worthwhile," she
said.
This is the first time the Parents'
Club has participated in any such
seminar, Vallaeys said. Both moth
ers and professionals will be shar
ing cooking expertise with the se
niors who attend.
Rafi Taherian, director of Stan
ford Dining, said that the seminar
will be a fantastic opportunity for
the chefs who work at Stanford,
since many of them enjoy teaching
cooking and actually ao so off cam
pus.
Stanford Dining has participat-

Ed in events like this in the past he
said. For this event, chefs will help
set up a production line for the
recipes parents have donated.
"It's a very nice way of wishing
our graduating class well, so they
have good memories," Taherian
said.
The second seminar, scheduled
for May 3, will teach money man
agement basics, including taxes,
loans, investing and accounting.
The last of the three seminars will
be an introduction to wine drinking
and bartending and will be held on
May 17.
Senior Miguel Prieto-Valle said
he didn't see the need for the semi
nars since he knows how to cook
and manage his money. He did,
however, have an interest in the
bartending seminar.

"1 don't see a huge need for
something like that," he said, "I
would say it's a positive thing and a
way for communities that don't
normally interact to get together."
Senior Elba Garcia heartily
agreed.
"I have been cooking my whole
life, but I think it's a good idea," she
said. "It also seems like it would be
a good way for people to de-stress,
since everyone is so stressed-out
about graduating. It's a way of
building a community to talk about
how stressed out you are."
The senior class presidents said
they planned the series to encour
age seniors to interact with each
other while learning essential life
skills. More information on the se
ries is available on the class Web
site.
