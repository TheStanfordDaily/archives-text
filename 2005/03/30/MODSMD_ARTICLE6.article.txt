### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
The first ASSU Undergraduate
Senate meeting of spring quarter dealt
largely with modifications to the spe
cial-fees ballot and the upcoming
spring elections. Several of the key is
sues discussed included whether The
Stanford Daily and Six Degrees: A
Journal of Human Rights should be
placed on the ballot and whether the
Senate should annotate the ballot.
Electioas Commissioner Troy Stein
metz, a sophomore, announced the ap

proval of The Daily's special fees petition.
"We had originally not approved
the Daily for ballot placement because
we threw out two sheets of signatures,"
Steinmetz said. The loss of these 54 sig
natures put the Daily below the re
quired number.
"We had reason to believe that the
sheets were not collected for the
Daily," Steinmetz continued. "They
had another group's name at the top,
and it was whited out and the Daily was
written on top of that."
However, after the elections com-
However, alter the elections com
mission e-mailed 20 students whose
signatures were on the petition sheets
in question, they received adequate
confirmation that the sheets were
signed for The Daily.
Six Degrees, a student group which
did not receive the necessary number
of petition signatures for ballot place
ment, appealed the elections commis
sion decision to throw out their seven
graduate student signatures.
"There's a question of constitution
al validity in accepting graduate stu
dent signatures for an undergraduate
group," Steinmetz explained.
The matter of whether these signa
tures should be included was voted on
by the Senate, which ultimately reject
ed Six Degrees' appeal.
Regarding the special fees ballot,
the Senate also has the ability to anno
tate a group, positively or negatively, di
rectly on the ballot. This would be an
other method to inform the student
body of whether the Senate approves
the allocation of fees forstudent groups.
The logic behind including a state
ment of approval or opposition to cer
tain student groups is that the Senate Ls
educated on each organization's specific
budget. Thus, when students vote they
can make a more informed decision on
whether to give a group special fees
based on the Senate's recommendation.
Nonetheless, many senators dis
agreed with this move, stating that
once a student group has proven itself
by receiving ballot placement, the de
cision should be left entirely to the stu
dent body.
The Senate voted to not place any
annotations on the special-fees ballot.
