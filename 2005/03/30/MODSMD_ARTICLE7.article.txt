# The 						facebook.com comes to Palo Alto
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Thefacebook.com, the popular networking Web site on
college campuses, has found itself a physical home in down
town Palo Alto. The Web site, which boasts two million reg
istered users — including thousands of Stanford students —
will occupy an office at 471 Emerson Street, across from Pizza
My Heart.
As more students from both Stanford and UC Berkeley
were hired to work on the Web site, creator Mark Zucker
berg realized the need fora single office where everyone
could work together. Currently, the core staff works in an of
fice in Menlo Park.
"More than 60 percent of [users] come back [to Theface
book] every day," Zuckerberg said. "That's a lot of traffic,
and it requires a lot of computers to process all that. It re-

quires a few people just to maintain
those computers. Then there are
other people needed to make new
stuff, get ads, etc."
Zuckerberg signed a one-year
lease on the office and said he plans
to keep the office at the Emerson lo
cation in future years, especially
since the office interior has been
personalized with the work of a fa
mous graffiti artist, David Choe.
"We have some nice paintings
here, so I hope to stay here fora
while," Zuckerberg said. "1 like down
town Palo Alto and I like the office."

Zuckerberg would not say how
much he paid for the lease, but
added that "downtown Palo Alto
isn't cheap."
The building is a larger space
than Zuckerberg and his colleagues
required, so the staff has set up side
offices to resemble dorm rooms.
These rooms will be open to Stan
ford students looking to study or
hang out off campus. Zuckerberg
also said that "cool" grand opening
plans for the office are in the works.
Thefacebook.com staff originally
came to Palo Alto just for the sum
mer but eventually decided to stay.
Zuckerberg, who is currently taking
a break from Harvard University,
will not return to school in the fall
and is considering transferring to
Stanford or Berkeley.
