In 1991, The Israeli Air Force successfully evacuated the whole of Beta Israel,
Ethiopia's tribe of isolated Jews, from Ethiopia's capital, where they were being
held as political pawns by the collapsing regime. In one of the most successful air
evacuations in history 15,000 men, women and children were airlifted to safety to
Israel in less than 25 hours. Former Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia, Asher Nairn,
tells their story.
