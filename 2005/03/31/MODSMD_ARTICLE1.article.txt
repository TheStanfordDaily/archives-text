# Addiction may be related to genes
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
If drug addiction can be linked to a
person's genes, how can we blame ad
dicts for their crimes, and how should
this genetic information be handled
among scientists, the state and the public
at large?
A panel of scientists, policy experts
and journalists discussed these and other
questions yesterday at the inaugural
event of the Stanford Center for the In
tegration of Research on Genetics and
Ethics.
Many lawyers already look to ge
netic predispositions to justify their
clients' actions, said Donald Kennedy,
editor in chief of Science magazine and
former University president, asking
the panel whether addiction can trump
free will.
"Genetics is not destiny," said
Robert Malenka, professor of psychia
try and behavioral science. "There is a
very complex interplay between genet
ics and the environment."
Personal choices and environment
play a defining role in the development
of addiction, Malenka explained, even
in individuals with severe predisposi
tions toward substance abuse. The

prospect of lawyers manipulating the
loose link between heredity and addic
tion was a "scary" thought, he added.
Alexandra Shields, associate profes
sor at the Health Policy Institute at
Georgetown University, suggested an
other potential misuse of this research.
She raised the idea of a "scared
clean" program for at-risk youth that
would test teens for predispositions to

substance abuse. Youths with a high
likelihood of addiction would then be
more forcefully steered away from ex
perimenting with drugs.
Shields said such a program would be
unethical, because "we have no under
standing of the mechanisms, the path
ways, the function of these genes. So it
doesn't give us the lever you would need
to intervene more precisely."

Shields also discussed the threat of
"genetic discrimination," which could
result if people are denied jobs due to
known predispositions to drug abuse.
Genetic labeling of this kind could wors
en the stigma surrounding the "unde
serving poor," who. Shields said, already
do not receive sufficient healthcare and
social services.
Panelists agreed that public educa
tion is the key to avoiding problems such
as genetic discrimination and the use of
heredity as an excuse for illegal acts.
The general public is badly misin
formed about basic science, Kennedy
said.
"Something over 60 percent of
Americans believe that humans did not
descend in any evolutionary relationship
from other forms," he added.
Public ignorance results in a cycle of
misinformation, said Elizabeth Weise,
science reporter for USA Today. In
catering to uninformed readers, journal
ists are tempted to oversimplify scientif
ic findings and therefore fail to convey
the most important details, Weise ex
plained.
Shields urged researchers and the
media to cooperate in bridging the lan-

guage gap between scientists and the
general public.
"We are all struggling fora new
vocabulary to help us capture this
complexity," she said. "The same
misunderstanding and the miscon
strual of information is what gets us
into trouble at all levels."

Even primary care physicians,
who are responsible for informing
their patients on the latest research
in health are intimidated by genetics.
Shields said.
"A tiny fraction of primary care
physicians feel equipped to either in
terpret genetic tests or to counsel pa
tients," she added.
So even if useful genetic tests are
developed, their distribution would
be hampered by the ill-informed
doctors who would have to adminis
ter them. Shields said.

Because of this distribution prob
lem, and because genetic testing is
such a long-term project, funding for
research in this field is often threat
ened.
"Unless there is some ongoing in
vestment we are not going to know
what's possible," Shields said.
And the potential of this research
is great, Malenka said, likening it to
the 1997 film "Gattaca," in which
unborn children were genetically
tailored to social standards of the
strong and beautiful.
