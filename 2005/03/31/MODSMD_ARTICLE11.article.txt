# On this day in Stanford History...

On March 31, 1927, The Daily
printed an article about Tito Schipa, a
famous tenor, performing on the
Stanford campus. Below is an ex
cerpt:
"With a heavier advance ticket
sale for the Schipa recital in the
pavilion tonight than for any of the
four previous concerts in the Associ
ated Student Series, Wilfrid Davis,
manager of the series, expects a
completely sold out house.
"Schipa has recently given two
recitals in San Francisco and one in
Los Angeles. Reports from those
who heard these recitals indicate
that the premier tenor of the Chica
go Opera Company still radiates the
same magnetism of personality and
retains undimmed the vocal power
that has made him a favorite all over
the country.
"In all the roster of lyric tenors

there is no one name heard quite so
often, nor any voice used as a stan
dard of comparison for others so
consistently."
On March 31, 1971, The Daily
published an article exploring the
reasons behind Congress' refusal to
fund the Hoeing company's super
sonic transport project. Below is an
excerpt:
"The Senate's 52 to 46 defeat of
funds for the American supersonic
transport last week, after a similar
House vote of 215 to 204. has effec
tively shot down the last hopes for
Boeing's big plane.
"But just why the $134 million ap
propriation, to have been used to
complete two SST prototypes, was
denied is unclear. While ecology en
thusiasts claim the vote as a major
victory, many congressmen do not

seem to have been motivated by eco
logical principles. In many eyes the
most important question is the alfect
of the death of the SST project on
the nation's soaring unemployment.
"Despite recent rumors of a
Japanese interest in buying the SST
'scrap pile' — blueprints, mockups,
research and tools — at 10 cents on
the dollar and some faint specula
tion that a group of private business
concerns would miraculously ap
pear, $3(K) million in hand, to under
write the project, it appears that the
only thing that could have saved the
1,800 mph jet was a federal subsidy.
"Proponents relied on appeals to
American primacy in aviation, even
on the American 'sense of adven
ture;' the opposition's arguments
rested on largely unproven fears of
ecological disaster.
"The affect on American aviation
cannot be immediately determined.
But the affect on the unemployment
situation in Seattle — where Boeing
is still the largest employer — was
swift and staggering: company
spokesmen immediately announced
that another 7,000 employees would
be released.
"Many workers at Boeing are
now just waiting for the axe to fall —
as are thousands of workers outside
Boeing— for it has been estimated
that every job lost on the SST will
mean two. three or even four jobs
lost in supporting and service indus
tries."

In the article "Seniors get real,
learn life skills," published yesterday.
The Daily inaccurately reported that
150 seniors had already signed up for
the first of a series of seminars teach
ing life skills. In addition, parents will
help cook during the seminar along
with Dining hall staff members.
In the article "Test your luck in
march madness," published yester
day, The Daily incorrectly quoted An
drew Gay by saying that for the
NCAA basketball tournament SAE
pool, his Final Four were Ohio State
University, Louisville, UNC and
Duke and that because Louisville and
UNC had been eliminated. Gay had
lost the bracket. The Daily mistook
Ohio State University for Okalahoma
University. Also, at press time, UNC
and Louisville had not been eliminat
ed. but Duke had, so Gay still lost this
bracket, hut not another one he had
entered with his friends.
