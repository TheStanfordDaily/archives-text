# Chest congestion and career confusion
## 
### 
Every Finals Week, through a careful
ly coordinated schedule of pulling consec
utive all-nighters and licking public tele
phones, I manage to make myself sick.
Hence, I have come to expect to be sick
over every winter break and spring break
and do not make vacation plans anymore.
Last week was especially bad.
Besides the splitting headaches, unex
plained searing pains through my ab
domen and sneezing, there was the brain
rattling, chest-exploding cough. Not the
sissy kind of cough that just irritates your
throat, but the powerful kind that starts
deep in your lungs, shreds every last alve
oli on its way up and ends with the vile
(and yet somehow deeply satisfying) taste
of phlegm in your mouth. Delicious. Al
though it gave me the opportunity to
watch a few hours of "COPS" and catch
up on some reruns of "Roseanne" on
KICU Action 36. my infirmity was not a

pleasant experience.
Despite my dismal
health, I refused to go
to the doctor. Well,
technically I went to a
doctor — 1 just refused
to accept care. 1 had to
go in fora routine TB
test, but when asked by
the nurse about my
suspicious and poorly
concealed coughing, 1

responded with "Oh, I'm fine. Just a
cold."
Just a cold? More like the greatest
mother-of-all colds. But I am a really bad
patient and 1 enjoy doctor visits just about
as much as I'd enjoy a root canal per
formed by a blindfolded dentist to the mu
sical accompaniment of a fingernails-on
chalkboards symphony. This is more than
a little disconcerting since 1 was sort of
planning to become a doctor myself.
This realization of my discomfort
around doctors and clinics threw me once
again into the emotional whirlpool of in
decision that plagues many a freshman
taking organic chemistry — to be or not to
be a pre-med? Except that 1 am a junior
now. And not just a junior, but a junior
who has completed all the pre-med pre
requisite courses and is beginning to study
for the MCAT. A junior who still has a
frighteningly long way to go.
Not only do 1 already feel like I'm
falling behind on the road to medical
school, 1 still have lingering doubts about
the process as well. I want to help people
and make a difference. But beyond the
idealism, am 1 really ready to make the
sacrifices and devote my life to medicine?
Will 1 be happy? Like so much Robitussin
expectorant, my experience being sick
made me cough up the whole slew of ques
tions that had been trapped inside me.
Even though I was sick, 1 managed to
attend an admissions workshop at the UC-
San Francisco School of Medicine last Sat
urday. Besides the standard discourse on
how you basically need to have discovered
a new vaccine or have ended hunger in a
small developing nation to get into their
medical school, several faculty panelists
talked about the motivation needed to
pursue medicine. One panelist, who had
taken a more circuitous route to medicine
after teaching sociology and living in
Africa fora number of years, commented
that she now realizes she was destined to
be a doctor and couldn't imagine a more
rewarding career.
Her words were inspirational, but at
the same time somewhat intimidating be
cause I can't claim to have quite the same
passion for medicine. There are times
when I feel like I would be really happy
being a doctor and working to make peo
ple feel better. But there are also times
when I wonder if there might not be a ca
reer out there that is more fun, less stress
ful or just better suited for me.
These were just some of the concerns
that ran through my head, adding a level
of emotional turmoil to my already fragile
health status. But I'm a little better now,
so I only have the career indecision to deal
with as 1 break in the comprehensive
MCAT review book 1 recently purchased
from Walmart.com with mommy's credit
card. 1 guess I'm just not one of those kids
who knows his or her destiny from the age
of two, and maybe I'll never be 1 (K) per
cent sure about my career choice.
Maybe the only certain thing is that we
all get sick from time to time and need to
take some moments to rest and heal,
which is a surprisingly difficult task when
you consider today's typical lifestyle. And
maybe that's why we always need more
doctors —because even people who are
generally healthy get sick and whether
they are eager to receive it or not, they
often need help to get healthy again.
Being a doctor might be hard, but the
world could always use a little more com
passion and care. So maybe I will continue
to pursue medicine

to pursue medicine

Every Finals Week, through a careful
ly coordinated schedule of pulling consec
utive all-nighters and licking public tele
phones, I manage to make myself sick.
Hence, I have come to expect to be sick
over every winter break and spring break
and do not make vacation plans anymore.
Last week was especially bad.
Besides the splitting headaches, unex
plained searing pains through my ab
domen and sneezing, there was the brain
rattling, chest-exploding cough. Not the
sissy kind of cough that just irritates your
throat, but the powerful kind that starts
deep in your lungs, shreds every last alve
oli on its way up and ends with the vile
(and yet somehow deeply satisfying) taste
of phlegm in your mouth. Delicious. Al
though it gave me the opportunity to
watch a few hours of "COPS" and catch
up on some reruns of "Roseanne" on
KICU Action 36. my infirmity was not a

pleasant experience.
Despite my dismal
health, I refused to go
to the doctor. Well,
technically I went to a
doctor — 1 just refused
to accept care. 1 had to
go in fora routine TB
test, but when asked by
the nurse about my
suspicious and poorly
concealed coughing, 1

responded with "Oh, I'm fine. Just a
cold."
Just a cold? More like the greatest
mother-of-all colds. But I am a really bad
patient and 1 enjoy doctor visits just about
as much as I'd enjoy a root canal per
formed by a blindfolded dentist to the mu
sical accompaniment of a fingernails-on
chalkboards symphony. This is more than
a little disconcerting since 1 was sort of
planning to become a doctor myself.
This realization of my discomfort
around doctors and clinics threw me once
again into the emotional whirlpool of in
decision that plagues many a freshman
taking organic chemistry — to be or not to
be a pre-med? Except that 1 am a junior
now. And not just a junior, but a junior
who has completed all the pre-med pre
requisite courses and is beginning to study
for the MCAT. A junior who still has a
frighteningly long way to go.
Not only do 1 already feel like I'm
falling behind on the road to medical
school, 1 still have lingering doubts about
the process as well. I want to help people
and make a difference. But beyond the
idealism, am 1 really ready to make the
sacrifices and devote my life to medicine?
Will 1 be happy? Like so much Robitussin
expectorant, my experience being sick
made me cough up the whole slew of ques
tions that had been trapped inside me.
Even though I was sick, 1 managed to
attend an admissions workshop at the UC-
San Francisco School of Medicine last Sat
urday. Besides the standard discourse on
