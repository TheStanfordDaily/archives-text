# Rebuilding Indonesia's Health Infrastructure
## 
### JACKIE CRESPO, KENDALL MADDEN ROBIN PAM GUEST COLUMNISTS 
Editor's Mote: This column is the first in a
three-part series about the impact of the De
cember 2004 tsunamis on the health sector of
Indonesia. The columns were written by stu
dents in the Stanford in Washington program
who took a class on global health policy that
focused specifically on the allocation of aid
funds.

As the immediacy and visible trauma of
the 2(X)4 tsunamis in South Asia subside, the
media's attention has begun to shift. But the
most important work that will shape the fu
ture of Indonesia as a nation is just begin
ning.
The United States has pledged $950 mil
lion over the next five years to aid the vic
tims. In comparison to other items on the
budget, the war in Iraq for example, the do
nation is not a huge sum. but those dollars go
a long way. While $55,(HK) might buy a luxu
ry SUV in the United States, the same
amount buys a chartered boat and relief sup
plies for one town in Aceh, Indonesia, ac
cording to Yayasan IDEP, a non-profit orga
nization that advocates sustainable develop
ment programs in Indonesia. You may have
donated a couple dollars to Oxfam,
UNICEF or the Red Cross right after the
disaster but your donating isn't over: The
government's dollars come straight from
your tax dollars.
As Stanford students and global citizens,
we have a responsibility to be aware of and
informed about the world around us. We
were all affected in some small way on De
cember 26. but Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka,
Thailand and other countries will feel the
setback of the tsunamis for decades to come.
There are continued needs for international
funding and support of reconstruction ef
forts throughout Indonesia.
According to the Jakarta Post, more than
12(),0(X) Indonesians died and hundreds of
thousands more were left homeless and
without employment, mostly in Aceh
province in the north. The area, torn by civil
war. was one of Indonesia's least developed
and most neglected regions before the
tsunamis hit. Rapid deployment of interna
tional aid has, to some degree, served to stem
the chaos and to provide basic necessities to
the population.
The most intense crisis has passed, but the
most important work still remains: rehabili
tating a severely damaged health sector. The

reconstruction process, World Health Orga
nization, or WHO, officials have said, "pro
vides a unique chance to reconsider the
whole health sector and plan it on a compre
hensive, rational basis." In the wake of the
tsunamis, Indonesia has a chance to build an
equitable and sustainable health system and
lay the foundation for alleviating poverty in
the country.
Many of the non-governmental organiza
tions, or NGOs, that have been providing the
bulk of relief services will soon begin the
process of pulling out. Both the internation
al community and the Indonesian govern
ment have emphasized the need for transfer
ring skills and responsibility to Indonesian
citizens. They will replace the foreign scien
tists. doctors and administrators who have
been operating the relief efforts for the past
several months.
The WHO has indicated the importance
of a continuing partnership with other
United Nations agencies and the Indone
sian government during the next three to
five years of the recovery period. To create
a sustainable health care system in Indone
sia, however, all sides agree that the coun
try must grow its own base of professionals
and community workers. The WHO will
act as an overarching support structure but
the manpower must come from within the
country.
The reconstruction of public health
physical infrastructure is also vital to sus
tainability. Before the tsunamis, Indone
sia's health care system consisted primarily
in local health centers — "puskesmas" in
Indonesian — many of which were de
stroyed by the tsunamis. Efforts to rebuild
are focused not just on rehabilitating the
damaged facilities but on expanding the
health sector, building more clinics in high
ly populated locations, training more com
munity health workers, developing com
munity health education programs and in
stituting epidemiological surveillance sys
tems and drug distribution networks.
Many Indonesians' livelihoods have
been disproportionately affected by the
tsunamis. Thousands of acres of rice fields
have become salinated and unusable and
thousands of fishing boats have been de
stroyed. The United Nations Development
Programme, or UNDP, has funded labor
intensive cash-for-work projects to help
bring income to victims while rebuilding
the country.
The long-term goal for the WHO and
UNEP is to contribute to sustainable re
construction projects that empower In

donesians to continue to engage in recon
struction long after foreign aid workers have
departed.
The next several years will be a critical
time for Indonesia. The activities of the
health sector will have long-lasting impact
on stability of the nation as a whole. In a Feb.
7 Pan American Health Organization con
ference on global preparedness for biologi
cal terrorism. United States Surgeon Gener
al Richard Carmona said that "health is the
best tool we have for fighting terrorism. We
should make health promotion a fundamen
tal piece of our anti-terror agenda."
Terrorists and terrorism, he said, are fos
tered in poverty and poor health is a key
component of the "poverty trap" that de

fines the lives of more than two billion peo
ple. Through continued international sup
port. both monetary and administrative, In
donesia has the opportunity to rise above the
vicious poverty cycle. Whether this opportu
nity is realized depends on what infrastruc
ture is built up from the ruins. A sustainable
health sector and a strong Indonesia will re
quire extensive physical construction of fa
cilities, an effective administration system
and strong communication and outreach
networks.
