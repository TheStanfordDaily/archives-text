## Editorial On-line Course Guide is an underutilized academic resource 
### 
Even with a two-week shopping period, navi
gating through Stanford's deluge of courses can
be intimidating. Many of us rely almost entirely
on the feedback we get from others to pick class
es, whittling down the laundry list in the Time
Schedule to a handful of courses that we will actu
ally shop.
To help address this concern, the ASSU offers an
on-line Course Guide (http://courseguide.stan
ford.edu) that serves as a repository of student com
ments about courses they have taken. These com
ments are the ones we fill out at the bottom of
teacher evaluations at the end of each quarter. Ide
ally, the Course Guide would be a one-stop re
source for students to access a broad compilation of
student responses that we could use to make our
academic decisions. In reality, the Course Guide
does not live up to its potential.
The biggest problem with the Course Guide is
how outdated it is. Many courses — even the popu
lar ones that many students take — do not have
comments available from the last two to three
years. For instance, the comments for the first
course in the biology core, Bio 41. date back to the
fall of 2001.
Due to the infrequent or nonexistent updates,
the Course Guide has earned a dubious reputation
among Stanford students. Only a handful of peo
ple know about it.and even those who do rarely
use it. Few academic advisors even mention it to
their advisees, let alone recommend it. As a result,
the Course Guide is woefully underutilized. Fresh
men are too clueless to know of its existence, while
seniors are too jaded to actually use it.
This is a shame. After all, peer recommendations
go a long way in helping us make up our mind about
what classes to take.
Of course, peer recommendations are not with
out their limitations. The recommendations listed
in the Course Guide are not always constructive.

Many students use the end-of-quarter course evalu
ations as an opportunity to rant about everything
from leaching styles to grading policies. This is, ad
mittedly, one of the major drawbacks of posting stu
dent recommendations on-line.
But what about positive recommendations? In
spite of the negative comments posted on the
Course Guide, the Web site is also home to a num
ber of rave reviews, written by students who en
joyed a remarkable classroom experience. In this
way, the Course Guide offers a potential opportu
nity for students to find out about outstanding pro
fessors who are committed to student learning and
who teach amazing classes.
But for the site to be effective, it is imperative
that the Course Guide be kept up to date in a sys
tematic way. One possible solution would be to in
crease partnership with student groups to update
the listings for their relevant courses. Currently,
Tau Beta Pi, the engineering honors society, is in
volved in providing course evaluations for engi
neering classes. Other societies, such as Bioßridge
and the Stanford Undergraduate Psychology Asso
ciation. could get in on the act.
Another way to make the process more efficient
is to have students submit their course evaluations
on-line. Such information would then go directly
onto the Course Guide Web site, without having to
employ many people to input information into com
puters. It might also improve the quality of these
evaluations, since students would be less pressed
for time while completing them.
With a robust course evaluation system, Stan
ford students will be able to make more informed
choices about their classes without having to rely
too much on random, word-of-mouth recommenda
tions. Also, with improvements to the on-line
Course Guide, students will be more likely to pay
attention to course evaluations when they fill them
out at the end of the quarter.
