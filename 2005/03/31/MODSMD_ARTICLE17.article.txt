# Writing in the Margins
## The 						Futile Facade 
### 
Dust-jackets beg us to judge hooks
hy their covers. It's a beauty contest
fought among publishing houses and
graphic designers with the aim of
drawing people to the relatively small
billboard of the average novel. The
cover of Shirley Hazzard's novel
"The Great Fire" is one such work.
Fiery, impressionist depictions of
something burning in endless reds,
yellows and oranges make for an obvi-

ous tie to the novel's title, but the reflection of this con
flagration in the muted grays and blues of some body of
water hints at the tone of what lies within the cover, a
novel described as "atmospheric" and "quiet."
Unlike the photos authors take to slap onto their
works, most of the illustrations and graphics that adorn
the flimsy coats are approachable, attractive and not the
least bit off-putting. The cover art of "The Great Fire"
is no rare find. Aesthetically pleasing dust-jackets are
far more common than pictures of Alice Munro. Dust
jackets entice and dazzle, enchanting potential readers
as they walk by a "New and Notable Fiction" display be
cause that's why they exist.
The dust-jacket represents the publisher's last op
portunity to try and sell a novel to consumers before it
falls into the hands of the literati and Amazon.com re
viewers. The literary equivalent of a cereal box or film
trailer, it displays little about the book and often has
nothing to do with the text itself. But if it looks good,
who cares?
Edith Grossman's new translation of "Don Quixote"
features a striking image of a bronze colored helmet

floating against a deep, rich, red background. It's an ar
resting illustration, simultaneously raising questions
about whose head once resided within the metallic cage
anil appealing to the viewer's aesthetic sensibility. It's
also a little derivative. The cover of Seamus Heaney's
recent translation of "Beowulf" shows a chain-mail hel
met contraption which begs the question, "Whose
chain-mail is it?" just as the cover of "Don Quixote"
does. How can two books whose innards are so different
have covers that evoke similar feelings and inquiries?
Dust-jackets get in the way. I would rather not deal
with the paper covering while reading "Don Quixote."
As the spine opens wider and wider, the book's grip on
the jacket loosens, and it slowly unleashes itself, falling
off of the book's covers and into my lap. 1 have no pa
tience for pretty, informative pieces of paper that don't
stay where they are supposed to. 1 took the cover off of
"Don Quixote" and set it aside so that I could read
undisturbed.
The dust-jacket of "Don Quixote" resides some
where at the bottom of a stack of probable recycling ma
terials at the foot of my bed. It's just the latest victim of
dust-jacket syndrome — that vicious, congenital dis
ease that slowly cripples a book's coat until it can no
longer be found by the work's owner. Dust-jackets can't
escape their fate. They exist to advertise, and then once
a work is sold, no one needs pretty pictures that often
fail to communicate, or enhance, the text. A book's
cover becomes meaningless once one has come to un
derstand what lies within.
