Stanford played softball with
Schwarzenegger
As one of the four students who actually
got to ask a question at the live taping of
"Hardball." I have to say that I mostly agree
with The Daily's editorial ("With 'Hardball/
Stanford was an intellectual softie," March
30). There are a few comments I'd like to add.
First, for those who didn't make it into the
"Hardball" audience, they missed a produc
tion, but not really much else. Except for the
last five or 10 minutes, Matthews was pum
meled by the Governator. who was rather
well-prepared and did better than I expected.
Next, and what bothers me most, is that the
audience didn't accurately represent Stanford.
I'd say at least 80 percent were pro-
Schwar/.enegger conservatives. And of course
we all know that Stanford is pretty progressive.
Not even all the people who were in the "stu
dent" section were even Stanford students. I
talked to someone who was in the banking di
vision at Agilent Technologies who wasn't a

student and was extremely conservative â€” he
supported Tom McClintock in the recall.
In regard to the questions, not only did I
write down a less combative question than I
really wanted to ask to make sure I was at
least considered, I was told that I could only
ask a one sentence question, two maximum.
And I was told this right before 1 was about
to ask. The question I asked was: "You've re
ferred to critics of Republican economic
policies as 'Economic Girlie-men' and
you've referred to California Democrats as
'three stooges.' Do you think this school
yard name calling is helpful to build the bi
partisan atmosphere you talked about?"
Of course this was greeted by his standard
answer to this question and applause from
the audience. I would like to have added that
while Schwarzenegger does work occasion
ally with Democrats, the name calling almost
always occurs when he disagrees with his
critics. Isn't that when we want the most bi
partisan efforts anyway?
Sadly, what could have been a great oppor

tunity to have a dialogue with the governor
turned into another Hollywood production.

Schiavo's life should be seen as
intrinsically valuable
The fundamental question for our society in
light of Terri Schiavo's situation is: Do human
beings have instrumental or intrinsic value?
Humans with instrumental value are a
means to an end, worthwhile only for obtain
ing some other object of value.
In contrast, humans with intrinsic value
are valuable in themselves. They have inher
ent worth and do not need to achieve some
goal to be considered valuable.
Genocide, slavery and the euthanization of
the disabled and unwanted are logically per
missible from an instrumental paradigm. When
some humans cannot achieve a society's stan
dard of quality, they are worth less than others,
or simply "worthless," and can be discarded.

"Quality of life" arguments for ending or
prolonging human life reflect the instrumen
tal viewpoint because they regard humans as
valuable only insofar as they can function at
certain levels of happiness, ability, produc
tivity, etc. Of course, these levels are subjec
tive and alterable.
By contrast, intrinsic value grounds the
concept of "basic human rights" (such as life)
as an objective, fixed standard for all. There
fore, providing basic sustenance to severely
incapacitated persons is justified even if their
condition never improves. Even if they are
inconvenient and unwanted, they are still
valuable people.
For Terri Schiavo, who will die from star
vation and dehydration, rather than disease,
the grave consequences of the instrumental
viewpoint are quite evident. I hope that
Americans will reject that thinking and af
firm the intrinsic worth of human beings.

Stanford women's basketball players and
coaches ignored by ESPN
I am a resident of Washington state and
have been watching your Pacific-10 teams
over the years.
I was glad to see several women's Pac
-10 teams in the basketball playoffs. I am
very sorry Stanford lost to Michigan State.
I am equally upset about how both Stan
ford's team and coaches have been ignored
by ESPN commentators. This was very ob
vious in the game against Connecticut as
well. In fact, my friends and family mem
bers are disgusted by this.
1 am writing to let you know that even
though I attended USC and University of
Washington. 1 feel that the Stanford
women's basketball team and coaches are
wonderful, show a lot of integrity and should
be considered great role models.
