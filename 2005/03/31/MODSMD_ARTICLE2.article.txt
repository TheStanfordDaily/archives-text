# Daily approved for ballot

### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
During its first meeting of the quarter, the Gradu
ate Student Council last night voted 5-3 against a mo
tion to overturn the recommendation from the
ASSU Elections Commission to place The Stanford
Daily on the upcoming special-fees ballot. Two vot
ing members abstained and several non-voting mem
bers expressed concerns about the petition process.
While the outcome of the vote allows The Daily to
remain on the ballot, many GSC members said that
the vote was more a vote of confidence in the Elec
tions Commission rather than a vote in support of

The Daily's placement on the ballot.
" 1 voted to say the Elections Commission did their
job," said GSC member Thomas Lee, the represen
tative from the Graduate School of Engineering. "It
wasn't a statement about The Daily."
Funding Committee Chair John Davis, a graduate
student in electrical engineering, was the most out
spoken in favor of overturning the Elections Commi
sion's recommendation. He declined to speak to The
Daily.
Elections Commissioner Troy Steinmetz, a
sophomore, said the GSC had previously voted
unanimously against including The
Daily on the special-fees ballot, as
did the ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate. As a result, The Daily petitioned
for ballot placement.
The Elections Commission ini
tially rejected The Daily's petition
request, citing errors in the process,
Steinmetz said, a fact that many in
the GSC noted in opposition to The
Daily's placement on the ballot.
"The whole process screams
hanging chads," said GSC member
Surya P.N. Singh, a graduate student
in electrical engineering.
Following a request from The
Daily, the Elections Commission
closely investigated 54 signatures it
had originally rejected because the
petition forms appeared to have
been tampered with. On those par
ticular petition sheets, The Dailyts
name was written over a different
groupfs name that had been erased
with white-out. But the Elections
Commission confirmed with 20 stu

dents that they had indeed signed a
petition for The Daily, and so the
Commission reversed its original
ruling. The Daily?s business manag
er explained that the petition circu
lator for those 54 signatures had run
out of petition forms and used an
other group's forms for The Daily.
?They gave us enough convincing
evidence to put them on the ballot,"
Steinmetz told the GSC. "We always
err on the side of what people in
tended," Steinmetz said.
The debate underscored the
reservations many GSC members
have expressed about the current
electoral process in general.
"The petition process, as of right
now, is the thing most in need of
changing in the elections process,"
Steinmetz said.
GSC Chair Moriah Thomason
expressed confidence in the findings
of the Elections Commission.
"This commission's work is ulti
mately going to have an impact and
sometimes the mistakes are part of a
positive change," she said.
The GSC did reach a consensus
to include its opinion on whether
The Daily should receive special
fees in the soon-to-be-released elec

tion handbook.
Juniors Melanie Kannokada and
Aneto Oknkowo, candidates for
ASSU president and vice president,
respectively, spoke briefly in front of
the GSC as part of the second in
stallment of the "meet the candi
date" series. Kannokada, a junior
class president, discussed her per
sonal experience with student gov
ernment.
"We want to work with you
guys," she told the GSC members,
and explaining her plans to increase
diversity among graduate students
and to establish a mentoring pro
gram to connect the graduate stu
dent community more closely with
that of the undergraduate.
In order to raise student awareness
about the elections, the GSC is hosting
an elections party tonight at the Grad
uate Community Center. According
to Thomason. all six candidates for the
ASSU executive positions will be
there to campaign and interact with at
tending graduate students.
The GSC also unveiled the name
and logo of the new pub located in
the Graduate Community Center.
The pub is now named "The Seven
Fifty."
