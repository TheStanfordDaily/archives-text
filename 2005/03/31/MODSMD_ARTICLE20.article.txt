# Let it be
## Getting people to eat 
### 
Five years ago, I began my odyssey
in the anorexia treatment system, when
I was admitted to the Children's Medi
cal Center psychiatric ward.
No, I'm not going to tell the usual
story about how horrible anorexia is
and how much treatment helped me. 1
want to complain about some unfortu
nate aspects of treating anorexia as a
psychiatric disease.
First of all, treating anorexia with
psychotherapy has an incredibly low

success rate, so
low that you have
to wonder
whether people
would fare just as
well without ther
apy. In one study,
scientists in Berlin
tracked X4 anorex
ia patients over 12
years. They found

that only 41 percent recovered and 11
percent died.
That's worse than most cancer re
covery rates. You'd think getting peo
ple to eat would be easier than eradi
cating cancer cells.
Whereas positive thinking has been
shown to be vital to recovering from
cancer, it's almost banned in anorexia
treatment. Some of the first things you
hear when you start treatment (and
definitely what you hear when you're
trying to get out of treatment) are: "It's
going to take you a long time to recov
er," "You didn't get this disease
overnight; you won't get better quickly,
either," and most tellingly, "People
never recover from anorexia, they just
go into remission."
Tell us that enough, and it will be
come true.
While individual therapists proba
bly mean well, the treatment industry as
a whole has a stake in keeping anorexi
cs in treatment. If therapists started
telling patients that they'd be well in a
few months, once they got back to a nor
mal eating pattern and weight, they'd be
losing reliable customers. Ironically, re
lapsing isn't seen as evidence that the
psychotherapy failed or didn't help, but
rather that still more psychotherapy is
needed.
With millions of potential cus
tomers, eating-disorders treatment is a
huge business, employing thousands of
mental health professionals. If being
underweight were considered about
the same way as being overweight (that
is, as a medical problem requiring in
tervention in proportion to its severity),
then thousands of people who treat the
"psychiatric disease" of anorexia
would be out of business.
A few times while I've been at Stan
ford, 1 thought about checking myself
into the hospital but decided not to, be
cause it would cost so much. I wanted a
safe place where people would help me
gradually increase how much I was eat
ing, but in order to get that, I would

have had to pay for "individual thera
py, cognitive behavioral therapy, inter
personal therapy, psychodynamic ther
apy and family therapy."
And I felt like I didn't need these
services. 1 knew the reasons I'd lost
weight, and I'd changed my situation so
these reasons were gone. 1 didn't want
someone to analyze how my neglect of
food symbolized a wish not to grow up.
But I really needed an environment
where 1 could safely increase how
much I was eating.
I wish under-eating could be seen as
a biological condition rather than as a
psychiatric one. Anorexic thoughts and
behaviors start to show up in almost
anyone who severely under-eats, re
gardless of the reasons for their under
eating. Some healthy adults choose to
practice a calorie restriction diet in
hopes of prolonging their lives — they
often exhibit the same traits and habits
as anorexics. People starved for re
search experiments often become ob
sessed with food. It's obvious that these
people started eating less for non-psy
chiatric reasons. To think that all cases
of under-eating are psychiatric in origin
is ludicrous.
At times, I've had real fears of eat
ing more — and this fear of eating that
shows up in many underweight people
is one reason anorexia is classified as a
psychiatric disorder. At the time, I as
sumed I was afraid of gaining weight or
becoming fat, since that's what people
told me. But when I think about it, I was
actually afraid of the strange physical
effects of eating after starving fora long
time (an increased appetite, being un
able to sleep, feeling strange). If under
weight people could get support for in
creasing their food intake incremental
ly (the same way that de-tox centers
help drug addicts slowly decrease their
drug intake), then maybe they would
have less fear in the first place.
Is anorexia mainly a psychiatric dis
ease? Does psychotherapy really help?
Most people who go through it say that
it does help, but then again, most peo
ple who put lots of time and effort into
something are loathe to say they it
wasn't worth it. In"The Shrinking of
America," psychologist Bernie Zil
bergeld writes that psychotherapy
often succeeds with helping people
overcome low self-esteem and a lack of
assertiveness, but that it has a poor
track record with treating addictions to
drugs and under- or over-eating.
Talking about feelings might make
us feel good, or at least helps us feel like
we're doing something, but in the end,
we have to make a plan to change
things, and stick to it. If getting help in
healthily increasing or decreasing one's
food or drug intake were as easy as get
ting psychotherapy, the world would be
a wonderful place.
