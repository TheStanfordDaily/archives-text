# Tribe sues school over blood
## 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
A biomedical debate has consumed the Native-
American Havasupai village located in the depths of
the Grand Canyon. The tribe has alleged that re
searchers, including several at Stanford, duped the
Havasupai into giving blood under the pretense of al
leviating the tribe's diabetes epidemic, and instead
used it to study schizophrenia and inbreeding among
tribal members.
Two lawsuits were filed in February and March of
2(X)4 â€” one by the tribe and the other by 72 individual
tribal members. The cases are now pending in a U.S.
District Court in Phoenix, Ariz.
The Havasupai tribe is suing former Arizona State
University Prof. Therese Markow. who currently di
rects the University of Arizona Center for Insect Sci
ence, and her affiliates.
Both suits name Arizona State University, where
Markow and her colleagues initiated the research, as
well as the University of Arizona, the Arizona Board
of Regents and Stanford University, where Markow
enlisted the expertise of other researchers and al
legedly sent them blood samples.
Forty defendants from Stanford were listed in both
suits, including members of the Board of Trustees,
President John Hennessy and members of the Genet
ic Research Department.
"We are hopeful that Stanford will be dismissed
from the individuals' case as well, given that we had
such a peripheral role," said Ruthann Richter,
spokesperson for the Stanford Medical School, in an
interview with The Daily. "Given the fact that we
were dismissed from the case brought by the tribe, we
are hopeful that the ruling will be to dismiss Stanford
from the other case as well."
Both suits claim ethical violations, including
breach of trust, fraud and violation of tribal members'
civil rights.
Combined, the suits are asking for $75 million in

damages.
Both cases claim that almost 4(X) blood samples
from more than 180 donors were gathered between
1990 to 1994 by researchers John Martin, Therese
Ann Markow and Daniel Benyshek. They drew so
much blood that tribal members gave them the nick
name "Dracula."
Martin and Markow initially developed a project
to study the diabetes epidemic ravaging the Havasu
pai tribe, according to a 2003 report compiled by in
dependent investigators. The project was presented
"strictly as a diabetes project" to the seven-member
tribal council between 1989 and August 1990 to win
the tribe's approval, which was required to obtain
grants from the National Institutes of Health, the re
port stated.
Martin and Markow are also accused of having il
legally obtained medical records from the village clin
ic without permission. A doctoral candidate working
for Markow admitted to rifling through medical doc
uments for evidence of schizophrenia at night when he
was alone at the clinic, according to an article pub
lished May 27 in The Phoenix New Times.
"1 would like all the blood returned to us," Tribal
Vice Chair Dianna Uqualla told The New Times.
"These are people, loved ones, who gave blood and
who have passed away. But their blood is still out
there somewhere I think. Blood is very important to
us. We need a ceremony with Arizona State Universi
ty officials present to bury that blood."
In the meantime, the tribe has shut down all re
search projects on the reservation and expressed dis
trust in outside medical intervention.
"Absolutely shocking things have been alleged
here," said Paul Spicer, a psychiatry professor at the
University of Colorado who is involved in the case, in
The New Times article. "Hiding the true nature of
some research projects from the tribe is a strong basis
fora lawsuit. Because of this kind of thing, many tribes
remain un-persuaded that improvements in health
care are right around the corner, if at all."
