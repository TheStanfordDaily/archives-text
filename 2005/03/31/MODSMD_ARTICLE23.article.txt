## The
						Double Clutch Cheating bleeds into youth sports

Although it has somewhat faded from
the public memory, I still feel that a
proper decomposition of the congres
sional hearing on steroids in Major League
Baseball is in order.
The setup of the whole scene was downright
ridiculous. Their ranks are stuffed with some
rotten scalawags. (I'm referring to the
Congress.) But they made some great points,
some unintentionally, as they grilled MLB
Players' Association head Donald Fehr about
the "five strikes" testing policy and heard from
parents whose sons had committed suicide
from the psychological trauma of the drugs.
Two-time World Series winner Curt
Schilling (who skipped steroids and went di
rectly to never-before-done experimental
ankle reconstruction for last year's postsea-

son) claimed that substance
use was "society's problem,"
not baseball's.
Rafael Palmeiro's finger
wagging declaration that he
had never used steroids bore
strong and eerie resemblance
to "I did not have sexual rela
tions with that woman."
Additional irony was
added in that Palmeiro has

admitted to using other performance-enhanc
ing substances and in fact appeared in paid ads
testifying to it.(I heard a fan at Tiger Stadium
last spring taunt Palmeiro from the upper deck
with chants of "Viagra!" 1 believe the fan may
have been inebriated.)
Most farcical (or pathetic) was Mark McG
wire, who in a pale green tie presumably com
memorating St. Patrick's Day, said "It's not for
me to determine" if using steroids is cheating.
Visibly shaken in the opening statement. Big
Mac also tried to turn the ghosts of McCarthy
in his favor by saying he would not "name
names." When he was less than forthcoming in
one question, he was accused of taking the
Fifth.
McGwire knows, though, that there is no
Fifth Amendment in the court of public opin
ion.
For his part, Barry Bonds put on his best
show at a spring training press conference, in
dignantly demanding that the media explain
why they are demanding that he explain what
happened to his strong but sleek body over the
last decade.
Editorials pooh-poohed the hearings as
grandstanding posturing by Congressmen,
rhetorically asking if all of baseball was now to
be considered tainted. I have a hard time be
lieving baseball is on the up and up, steroids be
damned, when I look at the long and distin
guished history of rulebumping. Sharpening
spikes to injure fielders, stealing signs, tarring
bats, pinch-hitting midgets, All-Star thirdbase
men slapping fielders' arms to dislodge the ball
â€” people keep coming back, so I'm guessing
baseball will be okay.
What seems more to be society's problem is
people who don't respect the honor (for lack of
a better term) of their authority.
Presidents perjuring themselves to federal
grand juries. Marine colonels lying to
Congress. Tenured professors lying about
going to Vietnam and selling books on it.
