### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Nearly three weeks after top
ping its previous season-best score
by six points to upset No. 7 Califor
nia at home to end the regular sea
son, the Stanford men's gymnastics
team placed third at the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation Champi
onship in Norman, Okla., last
weekend. The hometown Sooners
dominated the competition to win
first-place team honors with a score
of 225.60 and Cal earned a little
payback by edging rival Stanford
for second place with 219.725
points â€” just ahead of Stanford's
score of 217.925.
The Cardinal, who placed third
last year as well, performed the
best as a team on rings with a 37.75
mark. Stanford was led by sopho
more Alex Schorsch's score of 9.8,
which was good enough for first
place. Schorsch earned first place
honors on rings with a 9.6 in Stan
ford's 222.675-219.775 win over Cal
on March 6.
"We definitely had a lot of mo
mentum going in to MPSFs,"
sophomore Dylan Carney said.
"The Cal meet was the first meet
that our whole team was there as a
group and we put everything to
gether."
Freshman David Sender, who
tweaked his knee in warmups and
did not compete on floor and vault
as a result, placed fourth on rings
with a 9.65 in the first day of com
petition at MPSFs.
The Cardinal were also without

the services of sophomore Peter
Derman, who suffered from a
minor bicep injury and sat out as a
precautionary measure, on rings.
On the high bar, junior Nate
Downs placed third with a 9.6 and
Carney and freshman Sho
Nakamori placed sixth and sev
enth, respectively.
"We started off really shaky on
floor and pommel horse," Carney
said. "The past couple of weeks the
pommel horse guys have upped
their training to gain more confi

horse, we got really pumped up for
rings, vault, parallel bars and high
bar."
In the individual event champi

won first place on the high bar with
a 9.65 and Nakamori placed fifth
with a 9.1. Nakamori performed
even better on floor, capturing sec
ond place with a 9.725.
Sender was Stanford's best per
former on rings, placing fourth with
a 9.625. Schorsch could not repeat
his dazzling routine of the night be
fore, but his 9.20 was still good
enough for seventh.
Carney placed fifth on the vault
and sophomore Peter Derman
placed seventh on the parallel bars,
while Stanford failed to place a
gymnast in the pommel horse
event. Sophomore Brice Rolston
placed seventh on the event with a
9.05 during the team competition
on Friday.
