# Card confidence on display in 5-2 win
## 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It wasn't just about good, old
fashioned rivalry.
It wasn't just about the quick
shutouts, the putaways, the down
the-line drives.
In a game in which player com
posure is requisite and stoic specta
tors is the norm, the Stanford
women's tennis team (15-0, 7-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) executed a
model 5-2 defeat of No. 17 Califor
nia (11-4, 3-4), right down to the
smallest, oft-unsung details. The
Cardinal had better first-serve per
centages, more complete court cov
erage and an aura of confidence
that rang true in a player's every
step at Taube Family Tennis Stadi
um yesterday afternoon.
And against Cal - a team that
shrugged off an early season slump
to clinch seven of its last eight
matches, including a 4-2 upset of
No. 2 Northwestern (13-2) — the
Cardinal's meticulous approach
made all the difference between a
bitter fight and a clean sweep.
"It's a very typical Cal team [we
had out here today]," Stanford head
coach Lele Forood said. "They're
gritty, they're good fighters."
But freshman Whitney Deason
(23-3, 6-0) wouldn't buy it, keeping
the Golden Bears' Monica Weisen
er pinned at the baseline as she rose
to a 6-2, 6-2 victory at No. 4 singles.
Time and time again. No. 45
Deason pushed powerful ground
strokes past Weisener's reach, leav
ing her to lunge a second too late for
the return or to throw her hands in
the air — an early concession of de
feat.
Deason lost her serve momen
tarily while up 5-2 in the second set.
In a last-ditch effort, Cal watched
and waited as Deason's hesitance
carried over into her ground
strokes.

Prompted by a gentle, "Focus,
you're OK," from Stanford assis
tant coach Frankie Brennan, Dea
son made a smooth comeback, re
gaining her first service to sail to the
finish.
Going into the match, Deason
had built up momentum from a 6-1,
6-0 shutout last Saturday against
Oregon's Jamie Marshall.
"In addition to playing my game,
I didn't allow [Jamie] to play hers,"
Deason said. "She wanted to blast
every shot away."
Weisener suffered a similar fate
and was cornered into making
shots off her back foot. These de
fensive shots landed short on Dea
son's side and primed her for the
putaway.
Junior Alice Barnes (17-5, 6-0)
and sophomore Theresa Logar (19-
2, 5-1) fought aggressively side by
side on courts two and three. Logar
decided the match for Stanford with
a 6-3, 6-0 win over Marion Ravelo
jaona.
Barnes finished just minutes be
fore, serving out a 6-1, 6-2 victory
over Stephanie Kusano.
No. 84 Anne Yelsey (16-5, 6-1)
continued her season trend of quick
conquests, overwhelming Jessica
Shu 6-3,6-0 at No. 5 singles.
However, Stanford's top singles
player, junior Amber Liu, suffered
a 7-5,6-0 loss to up-and-coming Cal
freshman Suzi Babos.
Boasting a 25-4 record. No. 4
Babos has matched wits against the
most formidable players in the cir
cuit, outlasting Northwestern's No.

"They were brilliant." Forood

The No. 38 tandem of Liu and

Freshman Lejla Hodzic and Dea

win over Christina Visico and

The top doubles team of senior

(11-11).
"At No. 1 doubles, the loss came
from a combination of Erin not
being able to serve at full strength
and Suzi being very good at lob
bing," Forood said. "We lost an
early break, and it was hard to get
back in the game."
While yesterday's overall big
win does not figure into the Pac-10
standings, it brought out some of
the best and brightest in Stanford
performances. The Cardinal will
need to continue in this vein to
power through their next five
league matches.
"Like us, Cal is also preparing
fora big weekend against the Ari
zona schools," Forood said. "With
the exception of Amber's match,
we played quite well today. We'll
know a lot more about the confer
ence standings after we shake out
these upcoming matches."

shrugged off an early season slump
to clinch seven of its last eight
matches, including a 4-2 upset of
No. 2 Northwestern (13-2) — the
Cardinal's meticulous approach
made all the difference between a
bitter fight and a clean sweep.
"It's a very typical Cal team [we
had out here today]," Stanford head
coach Lele Forood said. "They're
gritty, they're good fighters."
But freshman Whitney Deason
(23-3, 6-0) wouldn't buy it, keeping
the Golden Bears' Monica Weisen
er pinned at the baseline as she rose
to a 6-2, 6-2 victory at No. 4 singles.
Time and time again. No. 45
Deason pushed powerful ground
strokes past Weisener's reach, leav
ing her to lunge a second too late for
the return or to throw her hands in
the air — an early concession of de
feat.
Deason lost her serve momen
tarily while up 5-2 in the second set.
In a last-ditch effort, Cal watched
and waited as Deason's hesitance
carried over into her ground
strokes.

Prompted by a gentle, "Focus,
you're OK," from Stanford assis
tant coach Frankie Brennan, Dea
son made a smooth comeback, re
gaining her first service to sail to the
finish.
Going into the match, Deason
had built up momentum from a 6-1,
6-0 shutout last Saturday against
Oregon's Jamie Marshall.
"In addition to playing my game,
I didn't allow [Jamie] to play hers,"
Deason said. "She wanted to blast
every shot away."
Weisener suffered a similar fate
and was cornered into making
shots off her back foot. These de
fensive shots landed short on Dea
son's side and primed her for the
putaway.
Junior Alice Barnes (17-5, 6-0)
and sophomore Theresa Logar (19-
2, 5-1) fought aggressively side by
side on courts two and three. Logar
decided the match for Stanford with
a 6-3, 6-0 win over Marion Ravelo
jaona.
Barnes finished just minutes be
fore, serving out a 6-1, 6-2 victory
over Stephanie Kusano.
No. 84 Anne Yelsey (16-5, 6-1)
continued her season trend of quick
conquests, overwhelming Jessica
Shu 6-3,6-0 at No. 5 singles.
However, Stanford's top singles
player, junior Amber Liu, suffered
a 7-5,6-0 loss to up-and-coming Cal
freshman Suzi Babos.
Boasting a 25-4 record. No. 4
Babos has matched wits against the
most formidable players in the cir
cuit, outlasting Northwestern's No.

Yesterday was no different
against two-time defending NCAA
Singles Champion Liu (12-1, 6-1),

"They're both shot-makers,"
Forood said. "But after Babos was

closing out Nos. 2 and 3 doubles un
contested.
"They were brilliant." Forood
said.
The No. 38 tandem of Liu and
Yelsey improved to 13-2 as they
snubbed Ravelojaona and Shu, 8-0.
Freshman Lejla Hodzic and Dea
son (17-5) followed suit with an 8-2
win over Christina Visico and
Tiffany Lee.
The top doubles team of senior
Erin Burdette and Barnes deferred
8-3 to the duo of Babos and Kusano

(11-11).
"At No. 1 doubles, the loss came
from a combination of Erin not
being able to serve at full strength
and Suzi being very good at lob
bing," Forood said. "We lost an
early break, and it was hard to get
back in the game."
While yesterday's overall big
win does not figure into the Pac-10
standings, it brought out some of
the best and brightest in Stanford
performances. The Cardinal will
need to continue in this vein to
power through their next five
league matches.
"Like us, Cal is also preparing
fora big weekend against the Ari
zona schools," Forood said. "With
the exception of Amber's match,
we played quite well today. We'll
know a lot more about the confer
ence standings after we shake out
these upcoming matches."
Stanford continues the action at

In a game in which player com
