The emotional pendulum swung in full
force for the women's lacrosse team over
the past two weeks, as the squad experi
enced the joy of victory and the agony of
defeat on successive weekends. A four
game split moves Stanford to 5-4 overall
and 3-0 in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation on the eve of its tilt against
California.
The two-week run started on a positive
note, as Stanford emerged victorious over
the visiting Colgate Raiders 12-7 on Mar.
18. Junior attackers Sarah Bach and Megan
Burker netted four goals apiece for the
Cardinal, which never trailed in the con
test. Freshman goalie Laura Shane contin
ued her dominance, allowing only seven

goals on 21 shots to Colgate (7-3).
Just one day later, the Cardinal fol
lowed the Colgate triumph with an even
more impressive 8-4 win over visiting No.
14 Cornell (3-2). Freshmen accounted for
half of the Cardinal's scoring, as attacker
Daphne Patterson and midfielder Megan
McClain netted two scores apiece. Goals
by Bach, junior midfielder Nyerr Parham
and senior midfielders Kelsey Twist and
Nina Pantano rounded out the scoring and
ensured the Cardinal would never trail in
the contest. Stanford led 8-2 before Cornell
scored two goals in the last minute to make
the final margin look respectable.
"That was definitely a big weekend, es
pecially against Cornell," Pantano said. "It
was the first time we had ever beat them.
That was something I was looking forward

to since our freshman year, since they came
out here and beat us really big. It was awe
some because all our hard work paid off."
Head coach Michele Uhlfelder was
quick to agree that Stanford's countless
hours of practice buoyed the players
throughout their big weekend.
"Everything we worked on in practice,
especially midfield transition, helped us
win those games," Uhlfelder said. "We fin
ished the weekend with a lot of momen
tum."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, that
positive momentum would not stay with the
team as it journeyed to Nashville, Tenn last
Saturday. Duke (8-2) manhandled an out
matched Stanford squad, scoring the first
15 goals en route to an 18-1 drubbing. De
spite the final score, Shane actually played

well, recording 16 saves. Burker netted the
sole Cardinal goal, one of her 14 on the sea
son.
"We lost to a very good team who we
didn't necessarily match up very well
against," Uhlfelder said. "It was a game
where we were able to try a few different
looks we had worked on in practice and put
it into a game. Although the score was def
initely unbalanced, we feel we lost to a very
good team and learned a lot. A lot of very
young players got to play against an excel
lent team."
Just two days after the Duke loss, the
Cardinal wrapped up a frustrating week
end by dropping a nail-biter to Vanderbilt,
10-9. The Cardinal looked safe with a 5-1
