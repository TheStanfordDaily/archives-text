# Women go 6-3 over two weeks
## Stanford racks up shutout wins 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
A lot can happen to a team's record over the span of
nine games.
Over the past two weeks, the Cardinal softball team
saw its share of ups and downs, as Stanford went on a small
roller-coaster ride from No. 3 to No. 6 and finally back up
to No. 5 in the rankings. While two of the Cardinal's ace
pitchers had rough outings, the squad's relatively young
pitching staff record four shutouts.
Despite the cluster of four losses in March, Stanford is
still riding high as it heads into April with a 24-5 record.
While Stanford split a doubleheader on Monday against
Fresno State (21-8), it at least finds itself again in the
upper half of the top 10.
The Cardinal fell to the Bulldogs 4-1 in the first of the
two non-conference matchups. Junior ace Laura Severson
walked away with the loss after allowing four runs in the
second. Freshman righthander Lauren Nydam came in to
pitch four plus scoreless innings but her strong perfor
mance in the circle could not make up for the Cardinal's
offensive woes. The Stanford bats failed to put enough
runners on against Fresno's Jaime Southern, who ap
peared on top of her game and scattered three hits over
seven innings.
If Stanford's bats were absent or just went silent in the
first game, they made their presence known by sounding
off loudly in the second contest. The Cardinal routed the
Bulldogs 14-0 in five innings before the game was called.
Junior shortstop Lauren Lappin kicked off the scoring
barrage with a single and the Cardinal proceeded to chase
Amanda Nesbitt with five runs in the first. The runs kept
coming for the Cardinal, who even hit two home runs in
one frame.

Stanford pulled out a 4-2 win against Hawai'i when catcher Leah Nelson homered in
the bottom of the eighth. The senior's two-run bomb gives her 23 RBI on the season.
Junior Catalina Morris, who has a
nine-game hit streak, blasted her
eighth home run of the season to left
centerfield in the second inning to
bring in two. The centerfielder con
tinued her hot streak with dinger No.
9 in the fourth.
Freshman righthander Becky
McCullough recorded Stanford's
12th shutout of the season to im
prove her record to 7-0.
During spring break, the weather
prevented the Cardinal from playing
Utah (9-14) and Princeton at home
on March 19, but the rain stopped
long enough to allow the second
day's games to go on. The sun didn't
shine on the Cardinal against Prince
ton, though, as the Tigers handed
Stanford its third loss of the season,
2-0.
Stanford fared much better
against the Utes in a rain-delayed
matchup. McCullough took the 6-0
win for the then-No. 3 Cardinal, al
lowing one hit and striking out eight
in six innings of work.
By the time the Stanford Invita
tional kicked off four days later,
however, the host team had
dropped to No. 6 in the polls. Stan
ford hosted its last tournament at
the Boyd and Jill Smith Family Sta
dium and came away with four wins
in five games.
No. 23 Northwestern (18-9) -
which previously defeated the Car
dinal 6-1 this season - handed Stan
ford its only weekend loss, 7-2. A
two-run double by Wildcat Jaime
Dobson and teammate Sheila Mc-
Corkle's dinger with Dobson on in
the bottom of the first put the Wild
cats up 4-0. By the third, their lead

had extended to 6-0. Nydam was hit
hard in her brief, one-inning appear
ance, allowing four runs and three
hits.
The Cardinal had trouble bring
ing their runners around, and only
freshman third baseman Michelle
Smith, who had a solid 2-4 day,
notched RBI for the team. Eileen
Laney, who came into the game with
a 1.02 ERA, pitched six innings plus
and struck out six Cardinal for her
10th win.
Stanford's hurlers were their
usual dominant selves in the circle in
the Invite's other tilts. Nydam
pitched six solid innings and Sever
son came on to win in relief against
Hawai'i (20-17). A two-run home
run in the bottom of the eighth by ju
nior catcher Leah Nelson broke a 2-
2 tie.
Severson easily put the Gaels (5-
23) away in another shutout win.
The Cardinal tacked on runs in the
first, second, third and fifth en route
to a 7-0 victory.
McCullough had a nice day in the
circle and at the plate in a 3-1 win
against Illinois (15-11). With Morris
leading the first inning charge, the
Cardinal took a free pass with the
bases loaded to bring in one run. Mc-
Cullough's swing singled in two
more, and after allowing one Illini to
cross the plate, the rookie shut the
door on Illinois, striking out a ca
reer-high 11 batters.
UNLV (23-12) fell to Stanford 3-
0. McCullough put a cap on her great
weekend with a complete game
shutout.
While the three losses in nine
games might have been a slight dis
appointment, it appears that Stan
ford's young pitchers and star hitters
settled into their roles during that
period. Just in time as well, as Stan
ford heads into conference play in
two weeks.

and struck out six Cardinal for her
10th win.
Stanford's hurlers were their
usual dominant selves in the circle in
the Invite's other tilts. Nydam
pitched six solid innings and Sever
son came on to win in relief against
Hawai'i (20-17). A two-run home
run in the bottom of the eighth by ju
nior catcher Leah Nelson broke a 2-
2 tie.
Severson easily put the Gaels (5-
23) away in another shutout win.
The Cardinal tacked on runs in the
first, second, third and fifth en route
to a 7-0 victory.
McCullough had a nice day in the
circle and at the plate in a 3-1 win
against Illinois (15-11). With Morris
leading the first inning charge, the
Cardinal took a free pass with the
bases loaded to bring in one run. Mc-
Cullough's swing singled in two
more, and after allowing one Illini to
cross the plate, the rookie shut the
door on Illinois, striking out a ca
reer-high 11 batters.
UNLV (23-12) fell to Stanford 3-
0. McCullough put a cap on her great
weekend with a complete game
shutout.
While the three losses in nine
games might have been a slight dis
appointment, it appears that Stan
ford's young pitchers and star hitters
settled into their roles during that
period. Just in time as well, as Stan
ford heads into conference play in
two weeks.
A lot can happen to a team's record over the span of
nine games.
Over the past two weeks, the Cardinal softball team
saw its share of ups and downs, as Stanford went on a small
roller-coaster ride from No. 3 to No. 6 and finally back up
to No. 5 in the rankings. While two of the Cardinal's ace
pitchers had rough outings, the squad's relatively young
pitching staff record four shutouts.
Despite the cluster of four losses in March, Stanford is
still riding high as it heads into April with a 24-5 record.
While Stanford split a doubleheader on Monday against
Fresno State (21-8), it at least finds itself again in the
upper half of the top 10.
The Cardinal fell to the Bulldogs 4-1 in the first of the
two non-conference matchups. Junior ace Laura Severson
walked away with the loss after allowing four runs in the
second. Freshman righthander Lauren Nydam came in to
pitch four plus scoreless innings but her strong perfor
mance in the circle could not make up for the Cardinal's
offensive woes. The Stanford bats failed to put enough
runners on against Fresno's Jaime Southern, who ap
peared on top of her game and scattered three hits over
seven innings.
If Stanford's bats were absent or just went silent in the
first game, they made their presence known by sounding
off loudly in the second contest. The Cardinal routed the
Bulldogs 14-0 in five innings before the game was called.
Junior shortstop Lauren Lappin kicked off the scoring
barrage with a single and the Cardinal proceeded to chase
Amanda Nesbitt with five runs in the first. The runs kept
coming for the Cardinal, who even hit two home runs in
one frame.

Stanford pulled out a 4-2 win against Hawai'i when catcher Leah Nelson homered in
the bottom of the eighth. The senior's two-run bomb gives her 23 RBI on the season.
Junior Catalina Morris, who has a
nine-game hit streak, blasted her
eighth home run of the season to left
centerfield in the second inning to
bring in two. The centerfielder con
tinued her hot streak with dinger No.
9 in the fourth.
Freshman righthander Becky
McCullough recorded Stanford's
12th shutout of the season to im
prove her record to 7-0.
During spring break, the weather
prevented the Cardinal from playing
Utah (9-14) and Princeton at home
on March 19, but the rain stopped
long enough to allow the second
day's games to go on. The sun didn't
shine on the Cardinal against Prince
ton, though, as the Tigers handed
Stanford its third loss of the season,
2-0.
Stanford fared much better
against the Utes in a rain-delayed
matchup. McCullough took the 6-0
win for the then-No. 3 Cardinal, al
lowing one hit and striking out eight
in six innings of work.
By the time the Stanford Invita
tional kicked off four days later,
however, the host team had
dropped to No. 6 in the polls. Stan
ford hosted its last tournament at
the Boyd and Jill Smith Family Sta
dium and came away with four wins
in five games.
No. 23 Northwestern (18-9) -
which previously defeated the Car
dinal 6-1 this season - handed Stan
ford its only weekend loss, 7-2. A
two-run double by Wildcat Jaime
Dobson and teammate Sheila Mc-
Corkle's dinger with Dobson on in
the bottom of the first put the Wild
cats up 4-0. By the third, their lead

had extended to 6-0. Nydam was hit
hard in her brief, one-inning appear
ance, allowing four runs and three
hits.
The Cardinal had trouble bring
ing their runners around, and only
freshman third baseman Michelle
Smith, who had a solid 2-4 day,
notched RBI for the team. Eileen
Laney, who came into the game with
a 1.02 ERA, pitched six innings plus
and struck out six Cardinal for her
10th win.
