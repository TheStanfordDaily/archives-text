# Women go 6-3 over two weeks
## Stanford racks up shutout wins 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
A lot can happen to a team's record over the span of
nine games.
Over the past two weeks, the Cardinal softball team
saw its share of ups and downs, as Stanford went on a small
roller-coaster ride from No. 3 to No. 6 and finally back up
to No. 5 in the rankings. While two of the Cardinal's ace
pitchers had rough outings, the squad's relatively young
pitching staff record four shutouts.
Despite the cluster of four losses in March, Stanford is
still riding high as it heads into April with a 24-5 record.
While Stanford split a doubleheader on Monday against
Fresno State (21-8), it at least finds itself again in the
upper half of the top 10.
The Cardinal fell to the Bulldogs 4-1 in the first of the
two non-conference matchups. Junior ace Laura Severson
walked away with the loss after allowing four runs in the
second. Freshman righthander Lauren Nydam came in to
pitch four plus scoreless innings but her strong perfor
mance in the circle could not make up for the Cardinal's
offensive woes. The Stanford bats failed to put enough
runners on against Fresno's Jaime Southern, who ap
peared on top of her game and scattered three hits over
seven innings.
If Stanford's bats were absent or just went silent in the
first game, they made their presence known by sounding
off loudly in the second contest. The Cardinal routed the
Bulldogs 14-0 in five innings before the game was called.
Junior shortstop Lauren Lappin kicked off the scoring
barrage with a single and the Cardinal proceeded to chase
Amanda Nesbitt with five runs in the first. The runs kept
coming for the Cardinal, who even hit two home runs in
one frame.

Stanford pulled out a 4-2 win against Hawai'i when catcher Leah Nelson homered in
the bottom of the eighth. The senior's two-run bomb gives her 23 RBI on the season.
