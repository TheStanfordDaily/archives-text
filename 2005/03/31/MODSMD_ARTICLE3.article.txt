# Big healthcare change proposed
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Economics Prof. Emeritus Victor Fuchs has com
bined his intellectual interests in healthcare and eco
nomics to craft a proposal for an innovative universal
healthcare voucher system in an article that appeared in
the March 25 issue of the New England Journal of Med
icine.
The proposal, which Fuchs developed with co-author
Ezekiel Emanuel, an expert on end-of-life decision
making at the National Institutes of Health, consists of
10 fundamental features. It would allow patients to
choose their health care plans freely and purchase addi
tional services that exceeded the value of the vouchers.
It would also mean the elimination of Medicaid and sim
ilar programs and the phasing out of Medicare. Addi
tionally, the proposal calls for the creation of an Institute
for Technology and Outcomes assessment and a federal
health board for oversight purposes.
According to Fuchs and Emanuel's article, "every
American under 65 years of age would receive a vouch
er that would guarantee and pay for basic health ser
vices from a qualified insurance company or health
plan."
Unlike other universal healthcare plans, the proposal
provides a comprehensive package of healthcare bene
fits. However, further study is needed on economic, legal,
regulatory and financial concerns related to the proposed
package before it can be considered a
realistic option, Fuchs said.
"More detailed information
about implementation will emerge
from research over the next two to
three years." Fuchs said.
The cost of such a voucher system
cannot be determined until specific
services, deductibles and co-pay
ments are selected. But according to
the article, "it is reasonable to expect

[healthcare service] use to rise by ap
proximately 5 percent. However, ex
penditures [can be offset by] a com
bination of lower administrative
costs and more efficient delivery."
In the article, the authors identify
what they believe are flaws in the
current healthcare system. They
wrote that, for example, current em
ployer-based insurance programs
are inefficient because they create
distorted labor markets, high admin
istrative costs and discontinuous
coverage, and they are inequitable
because they provide "a greater sub
sidy to high-income people."
"The American public has not

been willing to embrace the two con
ditions necessary for universal cov
erageâ€” subsidization of the poor
and the sick and compulsory partici
pation." Fuchs said, explaining why
previous attempts to enact universal
coverage in the U.S. have failed.
Even so, the article states that the
"voucher system |or any other major
reform in health care| is not politi
cally feasible at this time."
Fuchs said he anticipates that
"opposition to the voucher plan will
probably come from those who op
pose any comprehensive reform and
those who favor a single-payer ap
proach to reform."
