# Univ. joins grassroots effort
## Students urged to donate blood 
### EUGENIE KIM DESK EDITOR 
For the generation of people who lived through
World War 11, donating blood on a regular basis was
considered to be a commonplace civic duty. Today it is
still these Americans, now reaching older ages, who
support blood banks. But as health problems require
them to request blood rather than donate, both older
and younger Americans may be faced with a shortage of
blood. The concern felt by many health officials is
whether this older generation will be able to depend
upon younger generations to sustain the blood supply.
To counter this potential future shortage, Stanford,
along with 15 other universities, is taking part in a grass
roots effort to promote blood donation.
"Basically, the problem we're running into is that it
seems blood is needed more and more and blood centers
are having a harder and harder time recruiting blood
donors among students." said Michele Hyndman, public
relations manager at the Stanford Blood Center.
"[Young people] have so much going on, so many
media messages out there that it's difficult to filter out
what's important," she added.
Because of this lack of awareness among people aged
17 to 24, the Ad Council decided to work in conjunction
with the three major blood groups — the American Red
Cross, America's Blood Centers and AABB (formerly
known as the American Association of Blood Banks) —
to create the Bloodsaves campaign. Though the three
blood organizations have worked together on smaller
projects, this is the first time they have joined forces to
support such a large campaign.
