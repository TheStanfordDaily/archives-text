# Univ. joins grassroots effort
## Students urged to donate blood 
### EUGENIE KIM DESK EDITOR 
For the generation of people who lived through
World War 11, donating blood on a regular basis was
considered to be a commonplace civic duty. Today it is
still these Americans, now reaching older ages, who
support blood banks. But as health problems require
them to request blood rather than donate, both older
and younger Americans may be faced with a shortage of
blood. The concern felt by many health officials is
whether this older generation will be able to depend
upon younger generations to sustain the blood supply.
To counter this potential future shortage, Stanford,
along with 15 other universities, is taking part in a grass
roots effort to promote blood donation.
"Basically, the problem we're running into is that it
seems blood is needed more and more and blood centers
are having a harder and harder time recruiting blood
donors among students." said Michele Hyndman, public
relations manager at the Stanford Blood Center.
"[Young people] have so much going on, so many
media messages out there that it's difficult to filter out
what's important," she added.
Because of this lack of awareness among people aged
17 to 24, the Ad Council decided to work in conjunction
with the three major blood groups — the American Red
Cross, America's Blood Centers and AABB (formerly
known as the American Association of Blood Banks) —
to create the Bloodsaves campaign. Though the three
blood organizations have worked together on smaller
projects, this is the first time they have joined forces to
support such a large campaign.

"This is really an unprecedented
partnership between the three
blood groups and the Ad Council,"
said Ellyn Fisher, manager of Cor
porate Communications at the Ad
Council.
Through a series of print, radio
and television advertisements and
public service announcements, or
PSAs, launched in September 2(X)4,
these organizations say they hope
to educate a new generation about
the importance of blood donations.
As part of the nationwide cam
paign, the Ad Council, a non-profit
organization that gathers volunteer
contributions from the advertising
industry to create public service an
nouncements, announced on Jan.
26 that it had selected 16 universi
ties to participate in a grassroots
public education campaign to pro
mote blood donations on campus.
Stanford kicked off its campaign
with blood drives on Feb. 28 and
March 1. The blood drives included
promotions such as a drawing fora
free Apple iPod Shuffle, distribu
tion of 2,000 red wristbands printed
with "Bloodsaves.com" and exten
sive flyering across campus to raise
awareness about the events.
The Bloodsaves' Web site
(http://www.bloodsaves.com) in
cludes facts and statistics about the
need for blood donors, a zip-code

search for nearby blood centers and an interactive quiz to ed
ucate the Web site visitors about myths about blood dona
tion.
According to the Web site, approximately 60 percent of
the United States population is eligible to donate blood, but
only 5 percent actually take the time and effort to donate.
"We do a lot of research before and during, and focus
groups show that young people really want to make a differ
ence in the world but that donating blood is just not on the
radar," Fisher said.
Sophomore Mark Liao, an executive officer of the Stan
ford chapter of the American Red Cross and Bloodsaves' on
campus student representative, said that he was heartened
by the attendance and enthusiasm of the students who par
ticipated in the blood drives at the University.
"We had a handful of students who we approached while

handing out the red Bloodsaves silicone bands that actually
stopped on the spot and went to donate," he wrote in an e
mail to The Daily. "They usually weren't aware they could
donate, and, thanks to our volunteers on that day, these on
the-spot donors took the time to donate blood. What a great
feeling."
Despite the success of being able to spur some students
into donating blood for the first time, Hyndman said that in
the short term, the Bloodsaves campaign on campus was not
as successful as event organizers had hoped it would be.
"Unfortunately, the blood drives that we had where we
used Bloodsaves actually did very poorly," she said. "We ac
tually had fewer people turn out this time than we usually do
during blood drives."
Organizers said they thought one major factor for the
lower turnout may have been that the blood drives were held

the week before Dead Week, when many
students were preoccupied with end-of
quarter assignments and did not feel that
they had time to donate blood.
Fisher said that the Ad Council is cur
rently in the process of evaluating the suc
cess of the Bloodsaves campaign by mea
suring the number of students who partic
ipated in the Bloodsaves-sponsored blood
drives and tracking the number of hits that
the campaign Web site received. Yet these
numbers may not provide the most accu
rate gauge of whether the Bloodsaves
campaign is reaching people in the long
term.
"Our goal with the [public service an
nouncement] campaign and the ad cam
paign is really not to increase short-term
donations but to create a new generation of
lifelong blood donors," Fisher said.
The organizations sponsoring the on
going Bloodsaves campaign are in the
midst of planning more events for college
campuses in the future, such as the June
14 World Blood Donor Day, according to
Fisher.
The Stanford Blood Center plans to
continue holding its own blood drives
alongside the Bloodsaves campaign to
generate interest in blood donation
among students.
"Events such as the Hemo Bowl,
where we compete against the "Cal"
Blood Donations centers, prizes that at
tract our generation of donors and out
reach to student groups such as fraterni
ties and sororities highlight the Blood
Center's commitment to keep the issue of
blood donations foremost on student's

minds," Liao wrote.
The Stanford Blood Center hopes that future blood drives
will reflect a growing student commitment to donating
blood. In reaction to the relatively low turnouts for the most
recent blood drives, despite increased advertisement across
campus and across the nation, Hyndman said that some were
disappointed at the numbers.
"We're really kind of at a loss," Hyndman explained,
adding that she didn't know exactly why the drives weren't
successful. "We're going to keep trying to do new things to
encourage young people to donate blood and get them excit
ed about doing so."
"We really need young people to understand that donat
ing blood should be a part of their lives," she said. "We need
then to continue to sustain the blood supply for their grand
parents and parents in the future."
