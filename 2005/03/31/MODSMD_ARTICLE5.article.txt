# SIG deadlines extended
## 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
For several years, Stanford in Government,
or SIG, has offered paid, competitive fellow
ships for students to gain work experience in
government offices nation- and world-wide,
from Sacramento, Calif., to Washington D.C.
to Brazil. The application deadlines for nine of
the fellowships were extended this year due to
a dearth of interested candidates and two spots
— one with the California Assembly Commit
tee on Environment Safety and Toxic Materi
als and one with the Committee on Water,
Parks and Wildlife — remain open still. The
deadlines for those are April 11.

But these deadline extensions are not un
usual, said senior May Chiang, chair of SIG. In
the past, low numbers of applicants for certain
fellowships signaled a need to increase public
ity in the right circles.
"Many of these fellowships require target
ed publicity in order to reach the right stu
dents," she said. "The students are definitely
out there for these fellowships. Sometimes we
need to do some extra work to let them know
about these opportunities."
Chiang added that SIG receives several
hundred applications a year on average and
has always filled available fellowships with

"highly qualified candidates." Ac
cordingly, she said she is not con
cerned that the two open fellow
ships will remain unfilled.
Interest in the program has in
creased in recent years but the posi
tions SIG offers in California have
traditionally been more difficult to
fill, she said.
"It is usually a little harder to get
students excited about the place
ments we offer in California, partic
ularly when our other fellowships
are offered in what students see as
more "exciting" places," Chiang
said. "Students often do not realize
that our state and local fellows have
just as good of an opportunity to do
a great deal of substantive work and

develop close relationships with
higher-level public servants as our
fellows in other locations."
Sophomore Omar Shakir, who
received a fellowship to work at the
Santa Clara e-Government Office
last summer, agreed with Chiang.
"I felt that the fellowships were
fairly well-publicized. I just think
that for most people, when they
think about fellowships, the interna
tional or national ones are more ap
pealing," he said. "For an interna
tional relations major, for example,
the prospect of working at a county
or e-government office might not be
as exciting or prestigious as working
at the World Bank."
Shakir noted that the deadline

for the Santa Clara e-Government
fellowship was extended last year as
well.
"I didn't apply until the second
deadline," he said. "I was afraid
from the description that it would
be too technical in nature, so 1 ap
plied for another one instead. When
the deadline was extended, 1 fig
ured that since I already had the ap
plication I might as well turn it in."
Chiang said that SIG and the
Haas Center for Public Service have
devised several publicity strategies
to highlight the remaining fellow
ships. The organization will send e
mail advertisements to department
lists and send paper mailings to stu
dents from the Sacramento area.

In-state fellowships remain available

Also, SIG has asked some faculty to
make in-class announcements
about the fellowships; SIG mem
bers will also publicize the openings
in classrooms. Also, SIG plans to
ask students who were turned down
from fellowships earlier in the selec
tion process to apply for the ones re
maining.
Shakir. who applied for his fel
lowship primarily because it was
close to his home in San Jose, said
that his experience last summer was
definitely worth the application
process.
"Originally, 1 had just wanted to
be home for the summer, but it
turned out to be a really amazing
experience," he said.
