Stanford alumnus Marcus Mabry will author
a biography of Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice for Rodale Publishers entitled "Twice as
Good: The Souls of Condoleezza Rice."
Mabry told The Daily his intent is to "give
readers insight into one of the most interesting
and least known figures in Washington."
The book will span Rice's life thus far, be
ginning with her childhood in segregated Birm
ingham and continuing through her recent ap
pointment to secretary of state. It will also in
clude a segment on Rice's term as Stanford's
provost.
While Rice is still relatively young, Mabry
said that now is an especially opportune time
to publish her biography.

"The interest in Condoleezza Rice is
greater than it has ever been before," he
added. "Not only is she the first African Amer
ican to be the secretary of state, but she is also
the most powerful African American in the
history of the U.S. government."
Mabry said that he hopes writing the book
will help him better understand Rice's mental
ity and perspective and allow him to gain in
sight into a number of related issues, including
race, class, identity and partisan politics.
Mabry, also a senior editor at Newsweek,
has written a previous book focusing on the
role of race and class in America entitled
"White Bucks and Black Eyed Peas."
He plans to finish the biography in roughly
IK months, and release it shortly
after its completion. Though he ex
pects to he stretched thin between
his day job and the biography,
Mabry said that Newsweek is one of
the easier places to manage the two
tasks simultaneously.
"Newsweek encourages its jour
nalists to write books, especially on
topics of interest to Newsweek
readers," he added.
Moth Rice and Mabry spent their
time at Stanford studying the Soviet
Union. The shared Stanford experi
ence has helped him understand and
explain Rice's character, Mabry said.
"Stanford is a family, a very strong
community with many shared val
ues." he added.
