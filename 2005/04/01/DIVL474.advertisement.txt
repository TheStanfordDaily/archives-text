J. E. Wallace Sterling Award
"Since every graduating class at Stanford is filled with
superlative students, I felt, and still feel, undeserving of
the Sterling Award; the award is a wonderful reminder
that, although we are students here fora relatively
short period, the connections we make and the work
we do leave lasting impressions
