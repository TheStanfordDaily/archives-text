# AT THE STARTING LINE
## Pac-10 schedule kicks off at WSU 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
From the beginning of the season,
baseball head coach Mark Marquess
has said that his team would rely on
pitching and defense, not offense, to
win games this year. That has been the
case so far: the team has posted a 3.64
ERA and made a number of run-saving
defensive plays. In a 2-0 loss to Pacific
last Tuesday, six pitchers combined for
a shutout through nine innings, an en
couraging sign for the staff.
But now, as the No. 12 Cardinal (14-
9) head into the Pacific-10 Conference
season, the entire team will have some
thing to defend: last year's Pac-10 title.
Stanford will travel to Pullman, Wash.,
to face Wash-

ington State
(15-14, 0-3 Pac
-10) this week
end.
"The Pac
-10 title goes
through us
right now, and
it's our job to
protect it," ju
nior shortstop
Chris Minaker
said.
Stanford
has struggled in
the non-confer
ence season,re
cently dropping
games to Sacra
mento State
and Pacific.
The Cardinal's
supremacy in
the Pac-10
looks shaky.
No. 10 Arizona
has crept ahead

of Stanford in the poll, and No. 24 Ari
zona State and USC are also knocking
at the door.
This is the time for the Cardinal to
start getting defensive.
"This is a new team, a new identity,"
junior catcher John Hester said. "The
last few years, it's been Sam Fuld's
team, Jonny Ash's team, Ryan Garko's
team. Now, it's our turn to show what
we can do. So it means a lot to us, espe
cially the older guys, that we belong in
the tradition of this program."
The team is still trying to find its
identity as players like Jed Lowrie and
John Mayberry Jr. step into newfound
leadership roles after the departures of
Fuld and Ash, along with a number of
other veterans.
The Cardinal have also struggled
with their consistency. The offense has
vanished at times, as it did Tuesday
against Pacific, when the team managed
only four hits in a shutout loss in extra
innings.
It was the team's second loss in three
games against teams that the Cardinal
should beat. The other was a 4-3 defeat
at the hands of Sacramento State last
Friday. The games were meant to be
tune-ups, but the losses seemed to ex
pose the team's flaws more than any
thing else.
They also gave the team something to
prove as they begin the Pac-10 season.
"We have to learn from each step
along the way, from the tough losses
against Fullerton and Texas, to a game
like [Tuesday night] where we got beat
by a team that on paper isn't as good as
us," Minaker, a Washington native,
said. "The ability to learn from both the
really hard portions of the schedule
we've played, and then some of the lit
tle road bumps we've hit, should help
us greatly as a team. We've mo ,r ed on
mentally and are ready to start fresh in
league."
The Cardinal have been trying to
work out the kinks in practice this
week, but there is nothing that they
can do to prepare themselves for the
weather in Pullman. It is forecast to

rain or snow tonight, with tempera
tures dropping into the low 30s—con
ditions that won't help the batters on
either team.
When the Cardinal played at Wash
ington State two years ago, one of the
games was snowed out, and the teams
played through snow flurries in another
contest. The weather is viewed more of
a home-field advantage for the Cougars
than the home crowd is.
"It's a challenge, not with the crowd
but with the conditions," Hester said.
"You have to overcome the weather,
but [Washington State is] dealing with
the same thing you are. You've just got
to be better than they are."
The Cougars are not known for hav
ing a strong baseball tradition, but they
are on their way up. They finished
eighth in the Pac-10 last year, the best
finish in the program's history.
The team has a strong nucleus this
year. It relies heavily on its Friday and Sat
urday night starters, James Freeman and
Wayne Daman Jr., who have combined to
go 10-2 with ERAs in the low threes,
though both were roughed up by Califor
nia when the team was swept by the Gold
en Bears at Berkeley last weekend.
The Cougars also have some fire
power at the plate. Freshman Jim Mur
phy, a corner infielder, has come on
strong, hitting .371 with five home runs.
Senior Brady Everett is batting .337
with seven homers and 34 RBI, and ju
nior Jay Miller, who led the team in hit
ting last season, is batting .360.
Washington State is still a team that
the Cardinal should beat, at least on
paper. They swept Washington State at
Sunken Diamond last year, drubbing
the Cougars by a combined score of 38-
17 in the three games.
The Cardinal will be playing with a
chip on their shoulder this weekend,
and that might bring them a bit closer to
finding the team identity that Hester
was talking about.
"We have to be ready [for the league
season], because it's here," Minaker
said. "We have a Pac-10 title to defend,
and that's exciting."

pose the team's flaws more than any
thing else.
They also gave the team something to
prove as they begin the Pac-10 season.
"We have to learn from each step
along the way, from the tough losses
against Fullerton and Texas, to a game
like [Tuesday night] where we got beat
by a team that on paper isn't as good as
us," Minaker, a Washington native,
said. "The ability to learn from both the
really hard portions of the schedule
we've played, and then some of the lit
tle road bumps we've hit, should help
us greatly as a team. We've mo ,r ed on
mentally and are ready to start fresh in
league."
The Cardinal have been trying to
work out the kinks in practice this
week, but there is nothing that they
can do to prepare themselves for the
weather in Pullman. It is forecast to

rain or snow tonight, with tempera
tures dropping into the low 30s—con
ditions that won't help the batters on
either team.
When the Cardinal played at Wash
ington State two years ago, one of the
games was snowed out, and the teams
played through snow flurries in another
contest. The weather is viewed more of
a home-field advantage for the Cougars
than the home crowd is.
"It's a challenge, not with the crowd
but with the conditions," Hester said.
"You have to overcome the weather,
but [Washington State is] dealing with
the same thing you are. You've just got
to be better than they are."
The Cougars are not known for hav
ing a strong baseball tradition, but they
are on their way up. They finished
eighth in the Pac-10 last year, the best
finish in the program's history.
The team has a strong nucleus this
year. It relies heavily on its Friday and Sat
urday night starters, James Freeman and
Wayne Daman Jr., who have combined to
go 10-2 with ERAs in the low threes,
though both were roughed up by Califor
nia when the team was swept by the Gold
en Bears at Berkeley last weekend.
The Cougars also have some fire
power at the plate. Freshman Jim Mur
phy, a corner infielder, has come on
strong, hitting .371 with five home runs.
Senior Brady Everett is batting .337
with seven homers and 34 RBI, and ju
nior Jay Miller, who led the team in hit
ting last season, is batting .360.
Washington State is still a team that
the Cardinal should beat, at least on
paper. They swept Washington State at
Sunken Diamond last year, drubbing
the Cougars by a combined score of 38-
17 in the three games.
The Cardinal will be playing with a
chip on their shoulder this weekend,
and that might bring them a bit closer to
finding the team identity that Hester
was talking about.
"We have to be ready [for the league
season], because it's here," Minaker
said. "We have a Pac-10 title to defend,
and that's exciting."

defense — in Washington this weekend.
