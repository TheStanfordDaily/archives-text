The Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission announced yesterday that
2,412 high school seniors have been
offered a place in the class of 2009.
Today, the 1.545 students who ap
plied to Stanford through the regular
decision review process will receive
their acceptance letters, and the other
867 students who applied early action
and were admitted in December will
receive follow-up letters.

Admitted students must decide
whether or not attend Stanford by
May 2 and are invited to attend Admit
Weekend 2005 on April 29 to 30.
For the first time in the Universi
ty's history; more than 20.000 stu
dents applied lor admission, a dra
matic increase over last year. The ad
mission rate, falling below 12 percent,
was also the lowest it has ever been.
Admission Director Anna Marie
Parras said the rise in application
numbers came as a surprise to ad
mission officers.

"While we are still studying possi
ble causes, 1 believe we can attribute
this increase in large part to Stan
ford's broad-based appeal and its ex
cellences across academic disci
plines," she said. "Moreover, we
have seen a significant level of inter
est expressed in Stanford's interdis
ciplinary programs such as Interna
tional Relations and Human Biolo
gy, which represent a particular
strength of Stanford's undergradu
ate program."
While the admission office no

longer releases the percentages of
ethnic or racial minorities who ap
plied or who were accepted, Parras
said that "this year's admission deci
sions again reflect Stanford's strong
commitment to admitting and en
rolling a student body that is both
highly-qualified and diverse."
More than 90 percent of the ad
mitted students whose class ranking
was reported fall within the top 10
percent of their high school graduat
ing class, and 80 percent earned a
grade point average of 4.0 or above.
