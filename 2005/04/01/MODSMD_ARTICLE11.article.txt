# ITSS penalizes late bill payers

### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The honor system may be effective at combating
plagiarism, but as ITSS has discovered, it doesn't pay
the bills.
ITSS. which stands for Information Technology
Systems and Services, has decided that enough is
enough for students who haven't paid their bills in
months, and it will soon begin enforcing stronger
penalties and cracking down on those who are more
than 60 days overdue in paying a balance of over
$100.
Students can pay late bills until April 30, after
which ITSS may disconnect their phone or in-room
Internejt connection services, place them on academ
ic hold — preventing them from registering for class
es or receiving a transcript — or even turn them over
to an outside collection agency.
ITSS administrators said they hope the severity of
these consequences will make students think twice
before throwing out the little pink envelopes that
show up in their P.O. boxes each month.
In November, The Daily reported that many stu
dents do not pay their monthly ITSS bills due to the
absence of such consequences. In the article. Eco
nomics Prof. David Johnson said that it makes sense
for students to postpone bill paying so that their
money can earn interest in the meantime.
Associate Controller Allison Baird-James. who
has been tracking the the number of students who pay
their bills, said the article may have exacerbated the
trend of late-payment.
"Once The Daily's report came out. it took a steep
dive," she said.
The University has only been using an honor sys
tem for the last few years. Baird-James said, and by
enforcing penalties on students, ITSS is merely "rein
stituting policies that have been there in the past."
Jay Kohn. executive director of shared services at
ITSS. said that giving students until the end of month
to pay is "something of an amnesty program,"' con
sidering that actions should probably be taken imme
diately.
Kohn said that ITSS has been trying to inform stu
dents of penalties by including notices in this month's
printed and electronic bills. She said that students
with especially large balances may also receive a
warning over the phone.
As for the strictest of the penalties — the use of a
collection agency — Baird-James said that this ac
tion would be considered only as a last resort in cases
where students have graduated and left Stanford with
outstanding debts.
Being turned over to a collection agency can im
pact a student's credit rating for up to seven years.
