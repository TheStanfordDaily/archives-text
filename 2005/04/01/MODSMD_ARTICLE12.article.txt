### JESSICA ZHANG STAFF WRITER 
Peninsula residents looking for used cars can shop to
their hearts' content on a stretch of El Camino Real
near the Stanford campus. About 20 cars are habitual
ly parked along (he curb on El Camino, beginning
across from the Town and Country Shopping Center on
Embarcadero Road and extending for nearly two
blocks to Serra Street. The lineup is mixed with sedans,
SUVs and minivans all bearing "for sale" signs and
phone numbers of private auto sellers.
According to Dave Mitchell, a locksmith and resi
dent of East Palo Alto who is currently selling his 1977
Chevy van on El Camino. parking cars in this area is a
popular way to sell vehicles among residents from sur

rounding cities.
"I saw other cars parked there, probably 60 origi
nally in the late spring, early summer of last year,"
Mitchell said. "And 1 got the idea that if Craig's List
isn't doing the trick. I'd try leaving the car there."
El Camino is the ideal spot to advertise selling a
car, Mitchell said.
"I've had several responses already," he said. "In
the four vehicles that I've parked there, I've gotten 15
calls total. I'm not reaching as many people as I would
with Craig's List but I'm getting through to people
through a different media and it's very different from
reading an ad. People can see and touch the car there."
El Camino is a busy street with plenty of traffic
throughout the day, so cars left can reach a large, ac
cessible audience at any time. And the parking spots
are free, which is another huge perk. Mitchell said.
"People who post on Craig's List feel like they've
gotten a bonus because the seller didn't have to pay

the same for selling on El Camino.
You can double the price and write
'ten percent off' and people will still
buy it."

El Camino as a car-selling hot spot.
An individual selling a 2000 Nissan
Maxima on El Camino who asked

heard of the site from friends who
had successfully sold cars there.
Leaving cars on El Camino is
something that goes back a long
time and appears to be perfectly
legal, according to Chris Quick of
the Palo Alto Police Department.
"That is something that has been
contested and looked at in the courts
i and there was a time when the city
did enforce an ordinance that prohib
ited leaving cars on El Camino,"
Quick said. "But I guess that was
stopped by a court appeal."
"I haven't had any complaints,"
he added.
