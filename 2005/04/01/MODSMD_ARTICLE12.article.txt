# Residents sell cars on El Camino
## Curb in front of Stanford becomes popular used-car lot 
### JESSICA ZHANG STAFF WRITER 
Peninsula residents looking for used cars can shop to
their hearts' content on a stretch of El Camino Real
near the Stanford campus. About 20 cars are habitual
ly parked along (he curb on El Camino, beginning
across from the Town and Country Shopping Center on
Embarcadero Road and extending for nearly two
blocks to Serra Street. The lineup is mixed with sedans,
SUVs and minivans all bearing "for sale" signs and
phone numbers of private auto sellers.
According to Dave Mitchell, a locksmith and resi
dent of East Palo Alto who is currently selling his 1977
Chevy van on El Camino. parking cars in this area is a
popular way to sell vehicles among residents from sur

rounding cities.
"I saw other cars parked there, probably 60 origi
nally in the late spring, early summer of last year,"
Mitchell said. "And 1 got the idea that if Craig's List
isn't doing the trick. I'd try leaving the car there."
El Camino is the ideal spot to advertise selling a
car, Mitchell said.
"I've had several responses already," he said. "In
the four vehicles that I've parked there, I've gotten 15
calls total. I'm not reaching as many people as I would
with Craig's List but I'm getting through to people
through a different media and it's very different from
reading an ad. People can see and touch the car there."
El Camino is a busy street with plenty of traffic
throughout the day, so cars left can reach a large, ac
cessible audience at any time. And the parking spots
are free, which is another huge perk. Mitchell said.
"People who post on Craig's List feel like they've
gotten a bonus because the seller didn't have to pay
