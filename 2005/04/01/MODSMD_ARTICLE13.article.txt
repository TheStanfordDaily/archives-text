# President addresses the Academic Council
## Hennessy reviews past five years 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Looking backward, thinking
forward," a title inspired by Edward
Bellamy's Utopian novel, graced the
introductory PowerPoint slide of the
Annual Meeting of the Academic
Council yesterday in Cubberley Au
ditorium, during which University
President John Hennessy addressed
the past year's accomplishments and
future goals.
Approximately 100 attendees
first listened to English Prof. Robert
Polhemus, chair of the 37th Senate
of the Academic Council, present
the Report of the State of the Aca
demic Council. Polhemus said he
was impressed by increased commu
nication between the faculty and the
Office of the President as well as the
reports presented in front of the Sen
ate by various groups, on topics
ranging from faculty recruitment
and diversity to the University Press.
Hennessy then reviewed Stan
ford's academic and administrative
achievements within the past five
years.
"We stand for excellence, for ad
vancing the frontiers of knowledge,
for communicating and sharing that
knowledge and for helping to put
that knowledge to work for the ben
efit of future generations," Hen
nessy said. "Ten years from now, I
hope that we will be seen as a leader
in multidisciplinary and interdisci
plinary research and teaching, as
well as a contributor of solutions to
some of the world's most intractable
challenges."
In 100 years, Hennessy said he
had no doubt that the challenges will
have changed, but that he hopes that
the University will continue to be a
pioneer and help ensure that future
generations of Stanford community
members will find the same range of
academic and other opportunities.
In his review of recent years,
Hennessy noted the University's
focus on interdisciplinary programs.
A committee identified the need for
such programs in the areas of bio
sciences and engineering, which pro
duced Bio-X, housed in the James H.

Clark Center; environment and pub
lic policy, which resulted in the Stan
ford Institute for the Environment;
and international affairs, which will
be formally launched this fall with a
focus on peace and security, good
governance and human develop
ment.
"Stanford, with its breadth of ex
cellence all located on one campus,
is well positioned to pursue such
multidisciplinary initiatives," Hen
nessy said.
Hennessy indicated that another
interdisciplinary initiative focusing
on the arts is currently being ex
plored. He stated that current pro
grams in the arts "do not play as cen
tral a role as they should at a univer
sity of Stanford's caliber."
Two long-term goals that Hen
nessy identified were the elimination
of any current financial contribution
requirements for families with annu
al income levels below $45,000 and
the movement toward need-blind
admission for international students.
Hennessy believes these goals are
"achievable with support of Stan
ford's alumni and friends around the
world."
The importance of globalization
was also a prime topic at the meet
ing. Stanford, according to Hen
nessy, plans to open additional inter
national campuses to allow students
to experience more overseas pro
grams as well short seminars for stu
dents unable to study abroad for an
entire quarter.
Hennessy said that the University
has not reviewed graduate education
for 40 years and that he expects that
the findings of the Commission on
Graduate Education, slated to be re
leased later this year, will show Stan
ford how to improve graduate edu
cation.
Regarding the rate of faculty
growth as a whole, 565 new members
have been added to Stanford in the
past five years. Hennessy identified
an ongoing struggle to strengthen
gender and ethnic diversity amongst
faculty. He said Stanford has contin
ued to make progress in this area; the
