# Speakers examine end-of-life ethics
## Panel discusses Schiavo case 
### XIN XIE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students, professors and workers convened at
the School of Medicine yesterday to listen to panelists dis
cuss the legal and ethical implications of the Terry Schiavo
case that has dominated the news in recent weeks. The
speakers at the event were David Magnus, director of the
Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, and Deborah
Rhode, director of the Stanford Center on Ethics.
Schiavo, the brain-damaged Florida woman who had
her feeding tube removed after her husband obtained a
court order to end her life despite her parents' wishes, died
yesterday, 13 days after the controversy began.
According to Rhode, the dispute surrounding the Schi
avo case stemmed from a question of whether Schiavo's
husband or her parents, the Schindlers, had the ultimate
say in her fate.
"While Schiavo's husband said consistently that she did
not want to continue living, the Schindlers held that they
wanted her to continue living even if it was against her
wishes, and even if drastic measures such as amputation or
open heart surgery were required," Rhode said. "The
Court ended up ruling in favor of her husband, saying that
she did not want to be kept alive."
Although both Magnus and Rhode said it was nearly
impossible to determine what Schiavo's wishes were, they
agreed that the patient's wishes are paramount in deter
mining when his or her life should be ended. Magnus said
he believed that the right decision was made in the Schiavo
case.
"In Florida, the law clearly states that the spouse is the
decision-maker on the fate of the patient unless there is
reason to believe that the spouse is not doing what the pa
tient would have wanted," Magnus said. "In spite of some
of the media coverage, the evidence clearly shows that
Michael Schiavo was an appropriate surrogate for many
years."
Magnus added that Michael visited his wife regularly at
the hospital and cared for her for many years when her par
ents did not. Moreover, there is no evidence that Michael
had incentive to end his wife's life since he had agreed early
on to relinquish any financial gain, and his perception of
Terry's wishes has been consistent.
"In addition, he agreed to allow the court to act as
guardian and make a substituted judgment," Magnus said.
Though the case sparked nationwide debate, Magnus
said that the case should not have been as controversial
from a legal, medical or ethical viewpoint. So what caused
exactly caused the media firestorm?
"One factor was the political
angle," Magnus said. "Even though
this is not a case that really has any
thing to do with abortion, abortion
politics really drove this."
He added that media outlets did
not present the issues involved in a
balanced manner.
"Even if 99.9 percent of neurolo
gists agreed that the patient is in a
persistent vegetative state and can
cite sound science to back that up, op
ponents can find a couple of religious
neurologists to disagree without pre
senting sound evidence to support

their views," Magnus said. "The
media will then present both sides,
thereby conveying the false impres
sion that there is controversy."
Whether or not they agreed with
the speakers, many who attended the
event said the forum was thought
provoking and worthwhile to attend.
Joshua Schiffman, a pediatric
graduate student, said that he went to
the talk because the Schiavo case is
relevant to the end-of-life issues he
often encounters when working with
young cancer patients.
"I enjoyed the event but I do not
think that the right decision was
made regarding this case," said fresh
man Andrew Buchan following the
panel. "I do not feel that there was
enough proof that Terry would have
wanted her life support removed."
