# Students respond to Arctic drilling
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The vote in favor of drilling in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or
ANWR. has provoked outcry from a
number ol Stanford student groups
concerned with energy efficiency
and environmental protection. They
have contacted senators, representa
tives and the White House and are
still campaigning against policy.
On March 16, the U.S. Senate
voted 51-49 against an amendment
to prevent drilling in the refuge. The
Senate's budget proposal also in
cludes Arctic petrol drilling and ex
ploration.
The drilling has been on Presi
dent George W. Bush's energy agen
da for several years and has been ap
proved by the 1 louse of Representa
tives twice, but both attempts to
push the legislation were blocked by
the Senate.
Junior Robin Pam, who worked
with the Sierra Club on a press con
ference, documentary screening and
rally in opposition to Arctic drilling,
expressed her frustration at the
precedent set by the measure.
"The Senate vote puts all of
America's wildlands in danger," she
said. "Drilling will not end our de
pendence on foreign oil. and it is cer
tainly not the way to a secure energy
future."

Freshman Seth Silverman of Stu
dents fbr a Sustainable Stanford,
which also organized opposition to
the measure, visited Arctic oil devel
opment sites over spring break.
"I was taken by surprise by the
extraordinary and harsh arctic cli
mate and ecosystem," he said. "The
flat sheets of snow that go on for
miles created for me a sensation that
I was practically on the moon. There
are few places in this world so strik
ing."
The Arctic refuge is one of the
few places left on earth where indus
trial processes have not yet dominat
ed the natural conditions, Silverman
said.
"The trip made me realize the ex
tent to which we must break our oil
addiction and reduce our consump
tion of fossil fuels," he added. "As
long as demand is high and profit
margins large, oil companies will
continue to go to the ends of the
earth and enter into relationships
with the most questionable regimes
to fuel that demand."
But not all students are opposed
to the development of the oil re
sources. Senior Capp Culver, former
vice president of the Stanford Col
lege Republicans, said he supports
the project
While environmental groups al
lege that the ANWR oil yield will be
negligible when compared to the

ecological toll, it will be nearly twice
the amount that the United States
currently imports Irom Iraq, Culver
said.
"The possible 5 percent of do
mestic consumption that would be
produced would allow for the U.S.
not to have to import from countries
that are in opposition to it."he ar
gued. "ANWR is a frozen wasteland
for nine months a year. All drilling
would take place when the land is
frozen and would shut down during
the thaw."
He said that the drilling is not
simply about providing a quick fix
for climbing gas prices, but rather to
maintain a sound energy policy for
years to come.
Both Silverman and Pam stressed
that while Congress is nearly certain
to green-light the ANWR measure
as part of this year's Budget Recon
ciliation Bill, battles over wilderness
drilling and petroleum dependence
are far from over. Both emphasized
ways in which Stanford students can
raise awareness and set an example
bv being more energy efficient.
"As students, we can't just press
for these changes on a national
level." Silverman said. "We must
also make these changes here at
Stanford ... demonstrating to law
makers that we do not need to mort
gage our national heritage to fill our
eneruv needs."
