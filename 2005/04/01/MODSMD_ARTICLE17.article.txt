On April 1, The Daily ran a story and an editorial
about the ways in which developments in the state milk
container law affected Stanford dormitories and frater
nities. Below is the editorial:
Last week the dairy and bottle manufacturers' lobby in
Sacramento won a profitable victory when a bill to ex
empt fraternities from the state milk container law was
tabled.
The law rules that milk consumed in public places
catering to the public must be served in individual con
tainers for each consumer. Milk cannot be poured from
the more economical five-gallon cans.
For restaurants that do cater to the public fora prof
it, the law is a good one. But when the same legislation is
applied to non-profit dormitories and fraternities, in par
ticular. the lobby-sponsored law is nothing but a racket.
A very large California dairy company backed the
bill. But the dairy doing most of its business with Stan
ford houses has been opposed to the measure. The legis
lation means this to campus dorms and fraternities:

1. Extra refrigeration amounting to thousands ot dol
lars must be purchased, installed, and maintained. In
some cases, extra building had to be added to existing
plant space.
2. Milk costs will be as much as 280 percent higher
with individual containers than with milk bought in live
gallon cans.
3. The individual container method of serving milk is
more likely to induce the spread of germs than the bulk
method. In handling the half-pint milk bottles, hashers
grasp the top of the bottles where milk Hows over into
the drinking glasses. In the five-gallon method, however,
sanitary lids prevent human hands from touching any
area covered by the milk as it is poured into drinking
glasses.
4. Dairies can raise bottled milk half a cent without
drawing much public criticism. With large containers,
however, a 10 or 15 cent boost—though more economi
cal in the long run that bottled milk —would be more no
ticeable to the public. Incidentally, the dairies control
the price of milk bottled in small containers.
While the milk container law involves off campus pol
itics. we students—especially fraternity men —can best
air our opinions by writing to our Calilornia legislators.
We advise you to address personal, not form, letters to
your representatives. Fight the dairy racket by making
your opinions known to California assemblymen. Tell
them, as Stanford Health Officer George Luckett has
suggested, that fraternities are not serving to the public.
Such an amendment would solve the entire problem.
