# Pop culture exposed
## Admit it... we're all stalkers at heart 
### 
This past spring break, in between
sleeping, eating and watching
TV, I found ample time for what
has become an infamous college pas
time — facebooking. And since then,
I've found that I've developed a much
greater respect for this world of friend
ships, groupies and, dare we forget,
poking.
Here's a world you can boost your
own ego by having more virtual friends
than other less fortunate and unpopu
lar people. Here's a world you can
showcase how cool you are through
your taste in movies, books and music,
and by cleverly displaying alcohol in
your profile picture to the point where
your real personality you has a hard
time competing with the cool, perpetu-

ally-wasted face
book counter
part.
Here's a world
where every kind
of social group
exists, from the
political ("High
er Education
Should Be Free
For AH") to the

academic ("Chem 33 Is Fucking
Gauche") to the activist ("I'm Here to
Burn Down Hoover Tower You
Fock").
Some, however, do not share my re
spect for the world of Thefacebook.
There are those who attempt to be "in
dependent" and "nonconformist" by
refusing to jump on the Thefacebook
bandwagon. They argue that Web site
is superficial, that it defines people by
hotness, popularity and meaningless
trivia. But these objectors are people
who would probably have blank walls
and only 20-something friends anyway,
and are therefore hardly even worth
considering.
But taking their argument to heart,
fora moment, I'd say they're still wrong
— those who deem Thefacebook an
excuse for virtual popularity have
failed to truly grasp the true purpose of
Thefacebook.
You may call it superficial, but it's
just the opposite. It's an art: the fine art
of Thefacebook stalking.
Thefacebook may appear shallow,
but the truly devoted will find it an in
credible tool for gaining deep insights
into both existing and prospective
friends (ProFris). Although commonly
known to most as "stalking," I prefer a
less harsh term that isn't so associated
with illegality and jail, like "screening"
or"research."
I thought AIM-away-message
checking was bad, but Thefacebook
just takes stalking to an entirely new
level. It's amazing how clicking on a
simple name can grant you access to
people's favorite movies, classes, polit
ical views, popularity status, relation
ship status, friends from other schools,
pictures, websites, and — my favorite
— the Wall.
"In a Relationship"? Interesting.
256 Friends at Stanford? Facebook
whore. Only two messages on The
Wall? Sad.
And though you may try to hide
from it, you. too, are a stalker on The
facebook. When you're not busy look
ing for prospects to add to your running
tally of friends, you're checking recent
ly-updated profiles, or reading people's
walls to understand inside jokes — and
then going back to check profiles to see
if anyone recently updated theirs while
you were reading someone else's Wall.
There's nothing significantly or
even legally wrong with this. In a way.
we're all stalkers at heart, just trying to
understand and learn about the people
who make up the wonderful communi
ty we live in. by befriending them, mes
saging them, maybe even one day pok
ing them. Hopefully we're not actual
stalkers — that would make Theface
book friendships somewhat awkward
— but more like figurative ones. Ones
that care.
Perhaps one day these valued as
pects of Thefacebook will transition to
the real world of human contact and we
will roam campus with laminated pro
files around our necks, poking people
and handing them "friend requests"
during class, all the while checking our
mailboxes periodically.
But until then, the Thefacebook
grants you the joy of socializing and
bonding with that cute guy from your I-
Hum section without any of the social
awkwardness — and it even comes
with poking too. That's something to
respect.
