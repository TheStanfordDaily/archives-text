# After seven wins in the circle,
## Card's McCullough a rookie only in name 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
The spring season has arrived at Stanford. The rays are shin
ing, the skies are blue and the grass is prime for laying out, as
dozens of ladies head outside to sunbathe. And for freshmen
who are experiencing their first spring on the Farm, nothing
could be better.
But if you're looking for first-year Becky McCullough chill
ing out in the sun, you might want to head to the library first. In
fact, the only time the 5-foot-9 golden-haired freshman might be
found soaking in the sun is out on the field. Not Roble field or
Wilbur field but Stanford's softball field.
Not that that's a bad thing for the No. 7 Stanford softball
team (24-5). If it wasn't for the righthanded pitcher focusing so
much of her time on the sport, the squad might have seven fewer
wins — and that's not counting the times McCullough's swing
has come in handy.
As one of three starters in the Cardinal rotation, the pitcher
has seen a lot of action in her first season on the Farm. Fortu
nately for the Cardinal, McCullough's outlook on taking the
circle so often was shaped while she was growing up, watching
Stanford play.
"After watching for 18 years, to actually be able to put on the
uniform..." McCullough trailed off at the mention of her dream
come true.
"It's definitely lucky that [I have the] opportunities to pitch
everyday," added McCullough, who went 2-0 this past week. "A
lot of freshmen at other schools don't get the chance."
According to junior pitcher Laura Severson, the rookie does
what all good, young players do: McCullough does what is asked
of her — and she does it well.
If McCullough were to hit some lows, however, she has a
mentor to turn to in Severson, or "Seves" to her teammates. In
addition to Severson, McCullough has fellow freshman and
starter Lauren Nydam to turn to.
"We have a lot of fun," said McCullough of her fellow
hurlers, who head out to practice one hour before the rest of the
squad. "Seves is showing me and Nydam the ropes."
Since she's been around a few years, Severson can play an
integral role in helping the younger righty through her
strains, McCullough said. At the halfway point of the season,
McCullough has struggled at times, but she has been quick to
improve.
