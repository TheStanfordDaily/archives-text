# After seven wins in the circle,
## Card's McCullough a rookie only in name 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
The spring season has arrived at Stanford. The rays are shin
ing, the skies are blue and the grass is prime for laying out, as
dozens of ladies head outside to sunbathe. And for freshmen
who are experiencing their first spring on the Farm, nothing
could be better.
But if you're looking for first-year Becky McCullough chill
ing out in the sun, you might want to head to the library first. In
fact, the only time the 5-foot-9 golden-haired freshman might be
found soaking in the sun is out on the field. Not Roble field or
Wilbur field but Stanford's softball field.
Not that that's a bad thing for the No. 7 Stanford softball
team (24-5). If it wasn't for the righthanded pitcher focusing so
much of her time on the sport, the squad might have seven fewer
wins — and that's not counting the times McCullough's swing
has come in handy.
As one of three starters in the Cardinal rotation, the pitcher
has seen a lot of action in her first season on the Farm. Fortu
nately for the Cardinal, McCullough's outlook on taking the
circle so often was shaped while she was growing up, watching
Stanford play.
"After watching for 18 years, to actually be able to put on the
uniform..." McCullough trailed off at the mention of her dream
come true.
"It's definitely lucky that [I have the] opportunities to pitch
everyday," added McCullough, who went 2-0 this past week. "A
lot of freshmen at other schools don't get the chance."
According to junior pitcher Laura Severson, the rookie does
what all good, young players do: McCullough does what is asked
of her — and she does it well.
If McCullough were to hit some lows, however, she has a
mentor to turn to in Severson, or "Seves" to her teammates. In
addition to Severson, McCullough has fellow freshman and
starter Lauren Nydam to turn to.
"We have a lot of fun," said McCullough of her fellow
hurlers, who head out to practice one hour before the rest of the
squad. "Seves is showing me and Nydam the ropes."
Since she's been around a few years, Severson can play an
integral role in helping the younger righty through her
strains, McCullough said. At the halfway point of the season,
McCullough has struggled at times, but she has been quick to
improve.

Freshman Becky McCullough has been proving her wortfi as a pitcher — and as
tfie only member of tfie Cardinal staff that bats as well.
After going through a period
where she was readjusting and chang
ing around her motion, McCullough
has gotten used to a different style
and is now better able to pitch a game
the way she wants.
But the veteran has seen a differ
ent kind of change.
"Her best improvement is her con
fidence," Severson said. "It's gotten
better as the improvement has on her
game."
If McCullough does happen to
head outside this spring, it'll be with
book in hand. Her hard work in class
mirrors her hard work on the field.
When asked what activities she does at
Stanford, McCullough names two:
school and softball. It's not surprising
that those are top focuses, however, as
the Moraga, Calif, native is just trying
to make it through Hum Bio courses.
McCullough does partake in one
other activity that makes a huge dif
ference in her life. After doing volun
teer and church work in high school,
she joined Stanford's Cardinal Life.
McCullough applied religious be
liefs to her approach of the game. In
stead of playing for other people, and
what people may think of her. Mc-
Cullough says she plays fora higher

being.
"It helps release stress that comes
out of the game." said McCullough,
who started playing the game at the
age of five. "It doesn't matter what
you do day-to-day as long as you play
for God. It makes the game a lot easi
er."
And her numbers thus far this sea
son make the game look easy. McCul
lough heads the Stanford pitching
staff in ERA, with a 1.37 mark. Her
seven wins are second to Severson's
11. McCullough has struck out 48 in
51 innings of work and she most re
cently tossed the first complete game
shutout of her collegiate career.
McCullough, who swings from the
left, isn't so bad at the plate either.
The only Stanford pitcher that bats,
she has hit two home runs and tallied
two RBI last weekend.
Despite already having so many
accomplishments in her rookie sea
son on the Farm. McCullough's next
three years look bright.
"I'm hoping I'll be able to come
out and be a dominant Pac-10 figure,"
McCullough said. "That's a long ways
away, but it's something I've tried
working on this season."
While the righty has big plans for
the future, her teammates have some
thing a little different in mind.
"She's very hard working in all as
pects," Severson said. "But we'd like
to get her out of the library and get her
to come out with us."
