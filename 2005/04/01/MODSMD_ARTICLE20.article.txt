# An Art Affair to remember
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
After spending countless hours together in classrooms, labs and libraries, most students
become familiar with each others' academic skills — it isn't too surprising to learn that the guy
next to you aced his econ problem set or that your lab partner already got her results. It can
be surprising to learn, though, that when many students go back to their rooms to relax, they'll
pick up a guitar or a paintbrush.
Today in White Plaza, those arts-minded students are finally getting the chance to put their
talents on display at the Student Organizing Committee for the Arts, or SOCA, sixth annual
event, "An Art Affair."
"One of SOCA's main goals has always been creating a community of expression for the
many talents artists and performers on this campus," said SOCA President senior James Lin.
"An Art Affair serves this goal very well by reaching out both sides of the Stanford Commu
nity — those who want the chance to share their art, and those who want to simply enjoy the
art. It's great to have one big centralized event where all the different artists, students groups
and performers can come together and share their work with their peers."
An Art Affair has been three to four months in the making, according to Lin. This year's
event features more than 80 performances spread out over 3 performance stages and more
than 300 pieces of visual art.
SOCA will be also giving away free copies of "The Stanford Soundtrack Vol. 4," a compi
lation of campus musicians and the SOCA Writing Anthology. The Stanford Cooking Club
will treat students to a free gourmet dinner, and, to kick off the weekend, a CD release party
will be held in the evening.
This year's An Art Affair features around 200 participants, according to Lin. There was no
selection or application process — anyone who wanted to could sign up to participate.
"This ties in with An Art Affair's goal of fostering a community of expression," he said. "If
anyone has something they want to share, they are more than welcome to at this event. And
we've got undergraduate, graduates, staff and even faculty who are participating."
The performance lineup includes everything from cultural dances and rock bands to jug
glers and spoken word. The event is free, and people can find information, as well as the Stan
lord Soundtrack and the Writing Anthology, at the information booth in front of the Birdcage
in White Plaza.
The Daily spoke with several students who will be performing or displaying their work in
An Art Affair. The following is profiles of five of them.
Fiction: Bristin Jones
After submitting some of her poetry to last year's An Art Affair, junior Bristin Jones de
cided to branch out and submit a short story. Her story, "Alternative Medicine," features a
girl who gets stranded in King City, Calif., when her Greyhound bus leaves without her at a
rest stop. Jones said that though it is partially based on a true story, "the story itself has be
come more real than reality."
"When I was driving back up to Stanford after break, I stopped in King City at the exact
location where my story takes place, this little Mexican food place that's sort of hidden from
view, and it didn't seem like I remembered it, but it turned out I was remembering how I had
designed and remodeled the setting and not how it really was," she explained. "Funny how
fiction and creative writing have that power."
Jones, who is majoring in earth systems, said she enjoys the opportunity An Art Affair
gives to share her creativity with others and to learn about other people's talents.
"It's very purifying to create a piece of artwork, and it's exhilarating to share that outward
manifestation of what's inside you with others," she said. "There are so many creative kids and
Stanford, but sometimes they keep their creativity locked up in the closet. An Art Affair gives
us the opportunity to see our fellow students, maybe the guy in your Chem section or the girl
you always see studying in the CoHo, in a new way."

"I decided to participate in An Art Affair
because I feel that Stanford as a whole lacks
the same kind of appreciation and attention
for student visual arts as it has for student ath
letics or performance groups," said sopho
more Katy Yan. also an earth systems major.
Yan, who is minoring in art history, will be
displaying paintings done in acrylic and Chi
nese watercolors, as well as Chinese brush
painting.
"The art I'm displaying represents a com
bination of Eastern and Western influences,
stylistically and conceptually," Yan said.
"The art 1 try to make mostly stems from a
tradition of paintings of flowers, landscapes
and figures. I tried fora time to paint more
politicized art, dealing with identity or the en
vironment, but 1 realized that 1 could convey
a message just by painting what I wanted to
because that revealed the issues 1 cared about
and also who I was."
Yan said she still tries to express her val
ues with regard to issues such as the preser
vation of nature, but does not expect others
to always take away the same message from
her art.
"It's only important to me that people

will recognize a new way of viewing the world — that there is more than one way of viewing
life," she added.

Musical performance: Jonathan Grossman
Freshman Jonathan Grossman, who has written and performed his own music since the
ninth grade, will be performing four of his songs at this evening's Stanford Soundtrack CD re
lease party. His song "Falling" is featured on the soundtrack.
"I'm having other people in my dorm play different instruments and do back up vocals, so
it'll be like a big dorm project," Grossman said.
Grossman has been playing the piano since he was six years old. He learned about the Stan
ford Soundtrack last year as a Pro Fro when he won a copy of last year's CD during a scavenger
hunt.
"In middle school I really got into listening to music, and I started thinking if someone else
could write all these songs I really like, why couldn't I?" he said. "I slowly developed my own
music theory on how chords should fit together started developing songs. My uncle is a musi
cian so he took me to a music studio in ninth grade, and I recorded my first song."
Visual art (Photography): Bernardo Malfitano
Even though Bernardo Malfitano just graduated from Stanford this past winter, he has dis
played his artwork in Art Affair for

the past three years.
Malfitano has been carrying
around a camera since he was 10, but
getting a digital camera four years ago
"really allowed me to take the pic
tures I really envisioned, to capture
what I wanted to capture," he said.
It wasn't long before Malfitano
started testing his camera's capabili
ties at air shows. He is such an avia
tion enthusiast that while at Stanford
he taught a mechanical engineering
class about aviation technology for
which he wrote a 170-page book. He's
been flown through loops and rolls in
jet fighters to take air-to-air pictures
of the jets, he takes pictures every
year for the Pacific Coast Air Muse
um during their airshow and some of

his airshow pictures have been featured by NBC.
"I just love capturing the beautiful lines and crazy motions of aircraft in airshows." Malfi
tano said. "Taking a picture that really captures the beauty and capabilities of these incredi
ble machines, and the amazing skill of their pilots, is really, really exciting to me."
Malfitano said he relishes the chance to get to show his artwork with the rest of Stanford.
"I'm not part of any classes or groups where my drawings or my photography get looked
at or discussed. I just show my friends every now and then since I just do it for myself," he said.
"I'm a mechanical engineering major, so it's nice that people like me have this chance to put
our little random projects on display, especially with no competition aspect to it."
Although Malfitano's work is meaningful to him. he stresses that others shouldn't look
deeply to enjoy the photography.
"What should others get out if it?" he asked. "Nothing too profound, important, emotion
al, artsy or anything like that. A simple, 'That's cool,' 'That's an awesome-looking jet,' or
'What a pretty sunset' is all I can hope for."

Like Malfitano, Aaron
Wang wanted a chance to
share his photography
with other students and
get their feedback. As a
third year M.D./ Ph.D.
candidate in bioengineer
ing, photography is cur
rently just a hobby for him.
"I don't expect my
photos to outshine other
photographers," he said.
"And most likely my
photos won't be able to
because all I use is a sim
ple digital camera, a
Canon S4OO, and the
workload of medical
school prevents me from
pursuing this newfound
passion with great
depth. All I hope is that

there are some who enjoy my photos as much as I enjoyed taking them."
He said taking pictures is a great way to learn about other people.
"By taking pictures and sharing them with people. I can show my friends my perspective
on life," he said. "At first, I didn't expect much, but as I started sharing more and more of my
pictures, I started getting a lot of positive feedback."
Wang's favorite photograph captured the reflection of a sunset on the side of the car.
"My friend was driving down the highway and 1 was sitting in the passenger seat," he said.
"The sun was setting behind us and 1 noticed that the sunset reflected off my side of the car and
the windows. To capture the reflection and not need to roll down the window to stick my head
out, I zoomed the camera into the side view mirror."
