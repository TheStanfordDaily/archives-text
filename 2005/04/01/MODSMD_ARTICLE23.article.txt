## Editorial GSB should use admissions debacle as a learning opportunity 
### 
Waiting for acceptance into a graduate program can
he incredibly agonizing and stressful. A posting a
month ago on Business Week Online explained to sev
eral hundred business school applicants how to access
their admissions information before being notified by
schools. Two weeks later. Harvard Business School,
claiming that attempts to gain information early were
an ethical violation, denied 119 applicants admission.
Stanford's Graduate School of Business has thus
far not taken as strong a stance regarding the actions.
I he Business School's pragmatic decision not to take
draconian measures will prove more fruitful in the
long term. These applicants did not view their actions
as seriously unethical, and denying them acceptance
benefits no one. That said, the Business School, as one
ol the leading business schools in the country, cannot
allow the actions to go without response. At a time
when corporate scandals appear regularly in news
headlines, business schools must he the foremost pro
ponent of ethics.
Part of the difficulty in making an outright moral
judgment is that the actions fall in a gray area. The ap
plicants, reading a post on the Internet, found a way to
access predetermined information. They were not
manipulating this information, only looking at it prior
to schools' desires. No one stood to materially gain or
lose by gaining access; therefore it is hard to articulate
why the actions were morally unacceptable.
In addition, the instructions for viewing admissions
were available on a public site. With the information
easily available to the masses, it becomes public infor
mation, and ethical standards are not as clear.
While many schools argue that the actions violate
their individual honor codes, this is not necessarily the
case. Fhe honor code is a pledge between two parties.
Part of the universities' end of the pledge includes not
making it easy to cheat. Learning one's admissions in
formation early may not be the same as cheating on a

olate the spirit of this pledge.
Despite the ease of "hacking" into the Web site,
there ought to be some consequence for the appli
cants. Every person who attempted to gain access to
the information knew they were doing something
wrong. While the extent of the wrong is a blurry line,
in the wake of Enron-like scandals, ethics must play
an important role in all aspects of business school.
These schools produce the future leadership of the
business community, and as such, it is their duty to en
sure that students follow a higher ethical code.
In an ambiguous case such as this one, a more
palatable solution may be to work with the applicants
rather than reject them. The applicants, who were ac
cepted by Harvard but later denied, will be accepted
to other business schools. They will later play roles in
Fortune S(K) companies. By rejecting them, Harvard
has taken a strong but unproductive stance. Instead of
rejecting the applicants, Stanford, Harvard and others
ought to use this case as a way to further the study of
ethics in business schools. Those applicants should be
required to take a course in business ethics, and busi
ness schools should spend more time discussing
morally ambiguous decisions.
Stanford's Business School, as the only top five
business school on the West Coast, must serve as a
beacon. However, throughout the controversy, the
Business School has been relatively silent. The school
has said it will handle each applicant on a case-by-case
basis; this is not sufficient. Stanford must take a
stronger, clearer stance.
The applicants who hacked into the admissions
Web site made an error in judgment; however the ac
tion was not severe enough to warrant being denied
admission. Business schools, Stanford's in particular,
ought to take advantage of this situation to increase
the awareness and discussion of ethics.
