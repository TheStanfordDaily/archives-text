## The
						pitfalls of red / blue reasoning 
### 
Since I entered this university in
2(H)|, a relative of mine in Maine has
made it a custom at family gatherings
to inquire into my ability to survive
California, distant as it is from my na
tive Massachusetts. Such interactions
usually close with the teasing re
minder that the Golden State is popu
lated (to say nothing of vegetated) by
"fruits and nuts."
This saying has always carried, to
my ear. an echo of homophobia. Also

unstated, hut crystal clear, is the assumption of ideologi
cal difference between me and my Republican uncle.
A related and more popular slogan is the invidious
supposed dichotomy between "red" and "blue" Ameri
ca. Its roots are in D.( \ punditry, but its branches entan
gle political discourse at the national level. This dichoto
my does not spark but rather forecloses debate, and its
constant invocation reveals a subtle cultural parochial
ism. Indeed, the left's condemnation of racial prejudice is
undermined by its own proclivity fora regional prejudice
that is no better.
My own brief political memory informs me that red /
blue emerged from the split portions of the 20(H) U.S.
presidential election, and their illustration on televised
maps. "Red America" has since become shorthand for
piety, explicit patriotism and a suspicion of behavior and
sexuality that "red-staters" deem deviant. "Blue," mean
while. draws together the museum-hoppers and hybrid
drivers of secular America.
But the continued use of such terms should not be taken
as unimpeachable accuracy. Indeed, their inadequacy is
shown in the two hubs of "blue" America familiar to me.
Massachusetts, for one, gave a greater share of the
popular vote to its own John Kerry in November than any
other state. But if votes determine colors, then 62 to 37
hardly argues fora uniform "blue." I know a good deal of
religious individuals hack home, and many of them over
came their own skepticism toward evolution to excel in
high school science and pass on to college. Individuals of
all political persuasions fly American flags from their
homes in this state, whose voter registration, at any rate,
is 51 percent independent.
Thanksgiving at my cousin's in San Jose speaks to sim
ilar complexities in the Bay Area. One registered Re
publican and seeming Kerry-voter professed dismay at
Bush's election; another person, a pro-gay-rights moder
ate, was swayed from Kerry only because of his vacilla
tion on the question of marriage. The accumulations of
"exceptions to the rule," which can likely be found any
where in the country, throw doubt upon the "rule" itself.
While I am largely unfamiliar with what is called "red"

America, I do not understand how Ohio is so often as
signed to the category. One friend of mine, reared in that
state, has recalled a strong brand of conservatism that ex
tends to science textbook-writing and Congressional rep
resentation.
But another friend of mine canvassed rather produc
tively for the AFL-CIO there, and returned intact to Cal
ifornia in September. If 62-37 cannot leave a distinct
"blue" in Massachusetts, then hardly renders Ohio,
that old hotbed of abolitionism, "red."
Still, red/blue reasoning persists, and it falls any
where between a sigh and a sneer. Some of the more ex
treme variants of the dichotomy were expressed in writ
ing by a few very serious left-wing comrades of mine after
the November election. They urged other "blue" folks to
enter "middle" America and enlighten "red-staters" by
exposing them to queers, non-Protestants and the like.
This kind of reasoning is on the fringe, to be sure, but
I think it exposes a nasty type of regionalism that under
lies even the most passive red / blue thoughts. For at the
base of all red / blue reasoning is the willingness to throw
whole swaths of American society into simplistic and in
accurate categories.
Then (to limit this critique to the left, of which 1 am a
part), the shorthand "red" is deployed either in wearied
resignation to unreformable backwardness, contempt for
"their" unwillingness to conform to "our" standards or
the sort of raw paternalism of the anecdote above.
A dichotomy can be the first words of a long, interest
ing conversation. But red / blue reasoning does quite the
opposite: it is the negation of social nuance. It substitutes
mischaracterization for real debate, stubbornly adheres
to what are historically ephemeral partisan lines, neglects
the humanist potential of individuals and favors a crude
conception of the political and cultural "other."
In light of my own course of study, it is hard not to see
the eerie similarities between red / blue reasoning and. to
put it simply, racism. I would hardly claim that regional
ism is a form of racism — though I think the former con
tains some of the latter — but rather that regionalism and
racism are siblings borne of the same regrettable traits:
the reduction of the "other" to certain cultural behaviors,
the denial of commonality, the insistence on an antago
nistic relationship and an ultimate sense of superiority.
The result, on the left, is that the very political camps
that purport to oppose and undo prejudice of all sorts can
succumb to another, related prejudice of their own. In the
end, red / blue reasoning poisons debate on all sides of
the political spectrum. We ought to expect and practice
something better.
