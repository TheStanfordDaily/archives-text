"It appears
that no rational
purpose exists
for limiting mar
riage in this state
to opposite-sex
partners. The
state's protracted
denial of equal
protection can
not be justified

simply because such constitutional
violation has become traditional."
This was the decision of San Fran
cisco Superior Court Judge Richard
Kramer in the case of Woo v. Locky
eron March 15. For many, this ruling
has been a lifetime in the making.
However, Kramer's decision will un
doubtedly be appealed all the way
up to the California State Supreme
Court. But even if this court rules in
favor of justice and equality — that
is, against institutionalized discrimi
nation — it is unlikely that the fu
ture of same-sex marriage will be se
cure in the Golden State.
The conservative right has de
clared that if this ruling holds, they
will introduce an initiative for
November's ballot that would in
scribe a ban on same-sex marriage
into the state constitution — a sce
nario almost identical to Oregon in
2004. In that state a trial judge made
a similar ruling, only to be stilled by
the constitutional amendment
passed last November. Thus, despite
California's liberal history, the door
to a constitutional ban on same-sex
marriage has been left ajar.
Such an end would be made possi
ble by the nature of the amendment
process — not an overwhelming
popular sentiment against gay-rights.
That is, opinion polls show that a ma
jority of California endorses equal
rights for gays and lesbians, and a lull
two-thirds of those Californians sur
veyed in a Decision Research May
20(H) statewide poll "believed that
gays and lesbians are capable <if
forming the same kind of long-term
and loving relationships as hetero
sexuals."
However, when confronted with
the stark yes-or-no nature of a ballot
initiative, a majority of Californians
might very well vote to inscribe a tra
ditional notion of marriage into their
constitution — especially if they're
afraid of setting the opposite prece
dent. This paradox will always favor a
conservative agenda. It cannot be
stressed enough that issues of civil
rights and equality should not hang
upon the sentiment of an arbitrary cit
izenry, subject to prejudice and even
bigotry.
So if ballot initiatives are not a rea
sonable option because of their in
evitably "black-and-white" appear
ance, where should the nation turn to

resolve questions of same-sex mar
riage? Civil unions, the intermediate
"shade of gray," would be the logical
alternative. However, the more that
the gay community must rely on do
mestic partnerships for freedom —
and the more that conservatives use
civil unions as a way to validate preju
dice — the more institutionalized in
equality becomes within this land of
opportunity. "At this point in our his
tory, it really should go without saying
that separate is not equal," comment
ed San Francisco City Attorney
Therese Stewart. In truth, the nation
should turn to its so-called "activist
judges." These are, after all, the citi
zens with their ears to the ground, re
lentlessly striving to abolish inequali
ty, from Brown v. Board of Education
in 1954, perhaps all the way to Woo v.
Lockyer.
Such a pro-equality ruling ought
to be made — and enforced — for
the simple reason that a ban on
same-sex marriage can be reduced
to a question of discrimination
based on sex — not sexual orienta
tion. That is, under current law, if
one man is in love with another
man. he cannot marry him. Howev
er, if the first man were a woman,
that marriage would be entirely
legal and unquestioned. Therefore
it follows that simply because the
first person is male he is barred
from a right that other members of
society, women in this case, take
for granted. That is sexual discrim
ination in its purest form. Such a
form of blatant discrimination
should not be institutionalized, es
pecially not in a progressive state
like California, where according to
the state constitution, "A citizen or
class of citizens may not be granted
privileges or immunities not grant
ed on the same terms to all citi
zens."
It would, in fact, appear "that no
rational purpose exists for limiting
marriage in this state to opposite
sex partners," to repeat Judge
Kramer's words. And, as San Fran
cisco Mayor Gavin Newsom articu
lated at the one-year anniversary of
last February's same-sex nuptials:
"Civil unions are not good enough.
Civil unions are not marriage. Mar
riage is marriage."
One can only hope that the rest
of the nation will follow in Califor
nia's trailblazing footsteps - that
other cities will heed the example of
San Francisco, a truly 21st century
"city upon a hill."
