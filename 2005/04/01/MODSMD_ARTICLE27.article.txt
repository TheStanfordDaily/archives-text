## Three questions to ask ASSU candidates 
### KAI STINCHCOMBE 
For those of us who didn't re
member that Stanford has a student
government, this week is the annual
reminder. Every year, the ASSU
pauses whatever it is it does to renew
a pledge of "accountability, trans
parency, and communication" or
some permutation. Candidates say
they want to raise awareness of what
the ASSU does and get more people
involved. They say they want to rep
resent YOU.
Want more than an annual week
of flyering from the ASSU? You're
not alone. Here's three questions we
should be asking candidates:
1. What will you do differently than
your predecessors?
Typically, candidates don't come
into the ASSU with a vision for what
they'd like to do with the office.
Upon election, they face a steep
learning curve and naturally turn to
those with "experience" — former
officeholders — to figure out what
they should do. Meanwhile, office
holders are often eager to pass on
their legacy and continue to groom
candidates even two and three years
out of office.
This leads to a high level of insti
tutional reproduction. For those who
think the ASSU is a great organiza
tion, that's not a problem. But if you
think the current ASSU is about a
three or a four out of 10, be skeptical
of a candidate who gives it a seven or
an eight. The first prerequisite for
changing an organization is being
able to see its problems.

2. What are three things you hope to
accomplish during your first two
months?
Criticism of business as usual is a
requirement, but it's just the first
step. Candidates should be coming
into office with a list of specific,
achievable goals.
Every year candidates run on the
same buzzwords. If this year's candi
dates are repeating last year's cam
paign promises, it's because last
year's candidates couldn't get it
done. The current officeholders are
bright, energetic and well-inten
tioned. Anyone who pledges to try
the same stuff again, but work hard
er, is doomed to failure.
Changing the ASSU culture will
require a focus on specific, achievable
goals. An A for effort isn't enough.
Campaign promises should be a
checklist, and candidates should be
able to give a"state of the campus"
speech orwrite an op-ed halfway
through their term and say which
they've achieved. Suggest that to the
candidate and see how they respond.
3. Who will you represent in office if
elected?
One reason the ASSU comes up
short is because of the limited coali
tion that's involved in selecting can
didates. Most students don't bring
their problems to the ASSU because
they don't know who it is and don't
expect that the ASSU will be helpful
to them.
The elephant in the room is race
politics on this campus. Fortunately,
we're starting to see more coopera
tion than in recent history. A new

generation of students are more will
ing to work together, the election
brought together a truly diverse
group of leadership around common
interests, the MEChA special-fees
debacle has made prominent groups
intent on assembling bigger coali
tions, and the candidates — all of
them — have done an admirable job
of working across dividing lines.
In order to serve the student
body effectively, a candidate should
know a broad range of students,
from ethnic and religious organiza
tions to club sports teams and soror
ities and be able to talk convincing
ly about their needs. Someone who
says they will represent "every
body," *the average student" — or,
worst of all. "YOU" — won't have
the sort of agenda of achievables a
successful candidate will need. Ask
them who they've talked to —
names — and what specific needs
they intend to serve for those peo
ple and groups.
The ASSU needs candidates who
have identified constituents and under
stood their needs, have a list of propos
als they'd like to enact and understand
that a cultural change is necessary in
order to get the program accomplished.
By asking these three questions, we can
get a good sense of who's running to
make the ASSU work better.

Km Stinchcombe is former president
of the Stanford Democrats and was
the first to discover that "business as
usual" is an anagram of "ASSV sin,
ASSU lube." He has advised various
candidates but is not affdiated with
any campaign.
