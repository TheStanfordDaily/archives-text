## Jeff Dorman Sucks! The
						curious case of Idda Utama 
### 
The secret cannot be kept
much longer. The once
well-enforced gag order
has leaked in the last few days,
and even the most casual of
eyes can see the makeshift
training facility behind Maples
Pavilion. Even after Stanford
initially attempted to cover
him up, this type of phe
nomenon cannot stay out of

the spotlight for long; his basketball prowess is
just too great.
In order to protect his privacy, Stanford is try
ing to hide an early admit who, if he attends
school, could legitimately be the greatest colle
giate athlete in recent history'. His name is Idda
Utama, and you will be hearing it for quite some
time.
Utama, who was admitted in December, has
one of the most unique pedigrees of any Stanford
Pro Fro. Born in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (formerly Zaire), Utama lived mostly in a
rural region until a chance turn of events prompt
ed him to become interested in Stanford Univer
sity. It was a men's basketball equipment manag
er, Preston McCaskill. who, on a community ser
vice venture in Congo, first saw the incredible
feats that are sure to become widely known.
