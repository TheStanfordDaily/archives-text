## Jeff Dorman Sucks! The 						curious case of Idda Utama 
### 
The secret cannot be kept
much longer. The once
well-enforced gag order
has leaked in the last few days,
and even the most casual of
eyes can see the makeshift
training facility behind Maples
Pavilion. Even after Stanford
initially attempted to cover
him up, this type of phe
nomenon cannot stay out of

the spotlight for long; his basketball prowess is
just too great.
In order to protect his privacy, Stanford is try
ing to hide an early admit who, if he attends
school, could legitimately be the greatest colle
giate athlete in recent history'. His name is Idda
Utama, and you will be hearing it for quite some
time.
Utama, who was admitted in December, has
one of the most unique pedigrees of any Stanford
Pro Fro. Born in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (formerly Zaire), Utama lived mostly in a
rural region until a chance turn of events prompt
ed him to become interested in Stanford Univer
sity. It was a men's basketball equipment manag
er, Preston McCaskill. who, on a community ser
vice venture in Congo, first saw the incredible
feats that are sure to become widely known.
"It was really strange, the first time I met


Spencer Porter
Idda," McCaskill said. "We were
building a latrine by his village, it was
probably 10 feet wide, and I was dig
ging it out. 1 looked to my right, and
there he was. Then all of a sudden, a
shadow Hashed across my shovel, and
there he was on the other side, grinning
at me. From a standing position, he had
jumped 10 feet, and cleared my head
by at least a foot. 1 thought to myself,
'Whoa, imagine what he could do on a
basketball court.'"
That afternoon, McCaskill set up a
makeshift hoop on the side of a tree,
with a rudimentary backboard made
of discarded aluminum. He fashioned
the rim out of an old milk crate. Utama
had never seen a basketball before,
much less a rim, so when McCaskill
told him how to shoot. Utama didn't
completely understand.
"1 couldn't speak his dialect very
well, so 1 told him to 'set the ball on top
of the hole,' or something close to that.
He would have been very good at this,
but didn't completely understand me.
He would set the ball on top of the
backboard, grinning as he came back
down to the ground. But that back
board must have been 13 feet high! At
that point, I knew 1 was dealing with
someone very special."
There was still the question of getting
Utama into Stanford, but as McCaskill
gave him a crash course in basic English,
Utama admitted that he was a remark
able linguist, having written a series of
essays for African newspapers and mag
azines. all under pseudonyms to protect
his privacy. When he applied to Stan
ford, his essays were the main focus of
his application, which included a letter of
recommendation from Dikembe Mu
tombo. current NBA player and native
of Congo, who has also agreed to pay for
Utama's college education.
Upon his acceptance, Utama Hew
from Congo to California, marking the
first time he had ever been out of his na
tive country. He was greeted by the
men's basketball staff, whisked away to
a local hotel (the identity of which is still
in question) and a secret training facili

ty was set up behind Maples Pavilion.
"There Ls such a focus on privacy,"
said a Stanford Athletics official who
asked to remain anonymous, "because
there is a fear that it NBA scouts get wind
of him, he will be a high lottery pick in the
upcoming draft. Also, some of this is to
protect lilda from the mass of paparazzi
that are sure to come — we aren't com
pletely sure that he can handle the in
tense scrutiny of a college basketball sea
son. The last thing we want is for him to
get homesick and head home."
His ability is unquestioned. Stand
ing at 6-foot-6, Utama is projected to
play small forward, and with a vertical
leap of 70.5 inches (almost six feet), he
can literally jump over your average
point guard on his way to the hoop. The
owner of the previous best vertical leap
is Harlem Globetrotter Michael "Wild
Thing" Wilson, who can rise 55 inches
off the ground. Wilson also owns the
world record for highest dunk, which
he did on a 12-foot lux>p. Utama has
successfully dunked on a 14-foot hoop.
But Trent Johnson and his staff
aren't the only ones interested in
Utama. Track and field coaches have
been spotted courting the Congan, and
the football program is particularly in
terested in a running back who can leap
over potential tacklers or a wide receiv
er that will win every jump ball in the
end/one. The men's volleyball squad
has also spoke to him. although Utama
frequently jumps over the net for fun,
and has shown only limited interest in
the game.
His aptitude, probable prominence
yet. and possibly radically important
legend, ferments oodles of loving Stan
ford die-hards and yuppies. Now, the
only question that remains is whether
Utama will take to the collegiate game,
as he has remained ambiguous as to his
future. 1 le has hinted that he would like
to concentrate on writing, traveling the
United States to relate his experiences
back to his homeland. He has not
signed any documentation or given any
verbal agreement to play any sport for
Stanford, so all we can do with the best
athlete in the world is wait — and hope.

his application, which included a letter of
recommendation from Dikembe Mu
tombo. current NBA player and native
of Congo, who has also agreed to pay for
Utama's college education.
Upon his acceptance, Utama Hew
from Congo to California, marking the
first time he had ever been out of his na
tive country. He was greeted by the
men's basketball staff, whisked away to
a local hotel (the identity of which is still
in question) and a secret training facili

ty was set up behind Maples Pavilion.
"There Ls such a focus on privacy,"
said a Stanford Athletics official who
asked to remain anonymous, "because
there is a fear that it NBA scouts get wind
of him, he will be a high lottery pick in the
upcoming draft. Also, some of this is to
protect lilda from the mass of paparazzi
that are sure to come — we aren't com
pletely sure that he can handle the in
tense scrutiny of a college basketball sea
son. The last thing we want is for him to
get homesick and head home."
His ability is unquestioned. Stand
ing at 6-foot-6, Utama is projected to
play small forward, and with a vertical
leap of 70.5 inches (almost six feet), he
can literally jump over your average
point guard on his way to the hoop. The
owner of the previous best vertical leap
is Harlem Globetrotter Michael "Wild
Thing" Wilson, who can rise 55 inches
off the ground. Wilson also owns the
world record for highest dunk, which
he did on a 12-foot lux>p. Utama has
successfully dunked on a 14-foot hoop.
But Trent Johnson and his staff
aren't the only ones interested in
Utama. Track and field coaches have
been spotted courting the Congan, and
the football program is particularly in
terested in a running back who can leap
over potential tacklers or a wide receiv
er that will win every jump ball in the
end/one. The men's volleyball squad
has also spoke to him. although Utama
frequently jumps over the net for fun,
and has shown only limited interest in
the game.
His aptitude, probable prominence
yet. and possibly radically important
legend, ferments oodles of loving Stan
ford die-hards and yuppies. Now, the
only question that remains is whether
Utama will take to the collegiate game,
as he has remained ambiguous as to his
future. 1 le has hinted that he would like
to concentrate on writing, traveling the
United States to relate his experiences
back to his homeland. He has not
signed any documentation or given any
verbal agreement to play any sport for
Stanford, so all we can do with the best
athlete in the world is wait — and hope.
