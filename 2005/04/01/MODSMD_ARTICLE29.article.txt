# Men hope to shake off the rust in Arizona
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
If the adage practice makes perfect is true,
the No. 16 Stanford men's tennis team
shouldn't have too much trouble this week
end as it travels to Arizona to take on the Sun
Devils and the Wildcats today and Saturday,
respectively. The Cardinal's last road trip fol
lowing Dead Week and Finals Week showed
that the team was a bit rusty, but with four
more dual matches under its belt, the squad is
much more ready than it was even a week ago.
Stanford has looked better and better in
every match it has played of late. The Cardi
nal resumed play following a short break
from matches starting with a matchup against
top-ranked Baylor on March 23. Following
their 7-0 loss to the Bears, the Cardinal were
upset by then-No. 19 Washington.
The team regained its composure and de
cisively handed Oregon a 6-1 loss to close out
the road trip. With a win under its belt, the
team then returned to Taube Tennis Stadium
to take on No. 2 Illinois. The Cardinal came
within one match of upsetting the Fighting
Illini, but despite an impressive performance,
could not come away with the 'W.'
"We've been close to beating two of the
top five teams in the country," head coach
John Whitlinger said. "I told the guys that it
was definitely a step in the right direction. I
feel good about our performance, but we still
lost the match [on Tuesday against Illinois].

We've got to do a few things better, but I re
ally liked the way we competed and was pret
ty proud of the guys."
Stanford proved victorious in its last meet
ing with the teams from Arizona in mid-
February, defeating Arizona State 5-2 and
Arizona 7-0. However, this time around, the
Sun Devils and the Wildcats will have the ad
vantage of playing at home.
ASU proved that it has the ability to hang
with the big teams as it upset No. 12 Southern
California in early March. Despite losing the
doubles point, the Sun Devils rallied back to
win four singles matches to beat the Trojans
4-3.
Today, look fora possible matchup be
tween former NCAA doubles champion. Sun
Devil Andy Colombo, and defending NCAA
doubles champions senior Sam Warburg and
junior KC Corkery. In their previous meet
ing, Warburg and Corkery walked away with
an 8-1 victor)'.
The third-ranked duo's 18-match winning
streak was recently snapped in Washington,
and the two were defeated on Tuesday as
well, 8-6, by the ninth-ranked pair in the na
tion.
"KC and Sam have hit a little bump, but
they're going to be fine," Whitlinger said.
Stanford also claimed the No. 2 doubles
match to win the doubles point against Ari
zona State in February, while the Sun Devils

The Cardinal claimed the doubles point in their last meeting with Arizona, and hope to
do so again with the help of senior Phil Sheng and his freshman partner, Phil Kao.
