# Powerhouse 'Zona awaits No. 7 Card
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
In the nation's strongest conference, the battle for the top spot is about
to begin. The No. 7 Stanford softball team (24-5) kicks off the Pacific-10
Conference season against one of the best teams in the country.
The Cardinal will face No. 2 Arizona (26-2) in the conference opener
today and then play two against No. 18 Arizona State (25-7).
"It's always a challenge to play any conference opponent," head coach
John Rittman said. "To open up against the No. 2 team in the country and
then follow that up with Arizona State will be a good test for us."
Stanford comes into the first matchup as the underdog, the young guns
taking on the established veterans. Against the Sun Devils, the Cardinal are
the favorite, but with a recent upset of No. 3 California, Arizona State is a
team that can put up a fight.
Arizona is trying to return to the level of national dominance it has en
joyed in the past. Last year's exit in the NCAA Regionals marked the first
time since 1987 that the Wildcats did not reach the Women's College
World Series, and in that span, they reached the finals eight times, winning
six titles.

Stanford meanwhile is continuing its rapid as
cent from club team to national contender. Since
Rittman took over in 1997 and softball became a
varsity sport, the Cardinal have reached the post
season seven straight times and qualified for the
World Series twice, including last year when the
squad finished in a tie for third.
Arizona with only two preseason losses —a 10-
inning, one-run game against No. 4 Texas and a 6-2
defeat at the hands of top-ranked Michigan—is
making a strong case fora return to the top. The
Wildcats had tallied 21 straight victories before the
loss to Texas.
"They have a lot of team speed and obviously a
good pitcher in Alicia Hollowell," Rittman said.
"They don't have the power they have had in the
past with homerun hitting, but they still have girls
who can hit it out of the park. They win with their
pitching, defense and speed."
Hollowell has shouldered much of the pitching
burden for Arizona, posting 17 wins against just a
single loss with a 0.49 ERA. Taryn Mowatt also
pitches regularly and is 7-1 with a 0.86 ERA. Kristie
Fox leads the Wildcats' offense with seven home
runs, 40 RBI and a .717 slugging percentage on the
season.
