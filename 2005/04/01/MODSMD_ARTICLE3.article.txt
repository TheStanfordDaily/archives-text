# Powerhouse 'Zona awaits No. 7 Card
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
In the nation's strongest conference, the battle for the top spot is about
to begin. The No. 7 Stanford softball team (24-5) kicks off the Pacific-10
Conference season against one of the best teams in the country.
The Cardinal will face No. 2 Arizona (26-2) in the conference opener
today and then play two against No. 18 Arizona State (25-7).
"It's always a challenge to play any conference opponent," head coach
John Rittman said. "To open up against the No. 2 team in the country and
then follow that up with Arizona State will be a good test for us."
Stanford comes into the first matchup as the underdog, the young guns
taking on the established veterans. Against the Sun Devils, the Cardinal are
the favorite, but with a recent upset of No. 3 California, Arizona State is a
team that can put up a fight.
Arizona is trying to return to the level of national dominance it has en
joyed in the past. Last year's exit in the NCAA Regionals marked the first
time since 1987 that the Wildcats did not reach the Women's College
World Series, and in that span, they reached the finals eight times, winning
six titles.

Stanford meanwhile is continuing its rapid as
cent from club team to national contender. Since
Rittman took over in 1997 and softball became a
varsity sport, the Cardinal have reached the post
season seven straight times and qualified for the
World Series twice, including last year when the
squad finished in a tie for third.
Arizona with only two preseason losses —a 10-
inning, one-run game against No. 4 Texas and a 6-2
defeat at the hands of top-ranked Michigan—is
making a strong case fora return to the top. The
Wildcats had tallied 21 straight victories before the
loss to Texas.
"They have a lot of team speed and obviously a
good pitcher in Alicia Hollowell," Rittman said.
"They don't have the power they have had in the
past with homerun hitting, but they still have girls
who can hit it out of the park. They win with their
pitching, defense and speed."
Hollowell has shouldered much of the pitching
burden for Arizona, posting 17 wins against just a
single loss with a 0.49 ERA. Taryn Mowatt also
pitches regularly and is 7-1 with a 0.86 ERA. Kristie
Fox leads the Wildcats' offense with seven home
runs, 40 RBI and a .717 slugging percentage on the
season.

The Cardinal are 4-35 all-time
against Arizona, including 1-4 last
season.
Though the Sun Devils do not
have as strong a squad as Arizona
does, they have been playing well
and the Cardinal cannot afford to
overlook a slightly weaker oppo
nent.
"Because there is really not much
difference between teams, you have
to prepare for one game at a time in
this conference," Rittman said.
In the most recent polls, four of
the top 10 teams in the nation are
from the Pac-10. Arizona and Cali
fornia barely trail Michigan for the
top spot, and UCLA is just behind
Stanford. Washington and Arizona
State are also in the Top 25, giving
the Pac-10 by far the greatest nation
al presence.
Stanford was picked in preseason
polls to finish fourth in the Pac-10
and fifth in the nation, with No. 8
Oklahoma the only non-Pac-10
team projected to be in the top five.
After stringing together eight
straight wins. No. IS Arizona State
lost two of its last four games. De
spite being picked to finish last in the
league, ASU posted an impressive 1 -
0 win over Cal in March and took
Texas to extra innings in a 1-0 loss
last week.
Mindy Cowles leads the Sun Dev
ils, hitting .352 with 10 home runs.
Sharee Zaleski also has 10 homers,
including a solo blast that gave the
Sun Devils the win over Cal. Katie
Burkhart (9-3) has posted 129 strike
outs with 0.64 F.RA and Desiree
Serrano (10-20) has 86 strikeouts
and a 0.95 ERA.
Stanford is 12-KS all-time against
Arizona State, but won all three
meetings in 2004. tallying two
shutouts.
The outcome of this weekend will
be important in defining the shape of
the season. A win over Arizona
would put Stanford at the top of the
conference. The two teams will not
meet again until the final weekend
of the season and that two-game se
ries will likely have postseason im
plications for both squads.
Rittman said he is confident that
his team is ready to challenge the na
tion's elite.
"We've learned a lot about our
team and where we are at right now."
he said. "We're as prepared as we
could be going into conference. This
year our pitching is young and its com
ing around. We have a lot of depth and
we've been hitting the ball well. They
keys for us in conference, because all
the teams are so good, will be good de
fense. good pitching and timely hitting.
If we can do that we should be able to
stay with the conference leaders."
