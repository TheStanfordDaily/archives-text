# Stifling defense downs Gauchos
## Women fall to USC 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Entering the final month of its regular
season schedule, the record of the No. 3
women's water polo team (11-4. 4-2
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
stands almost exactly as the Collegiate
Women's Top 20 Poll says it should. Of
the Cardinal's four losses, three have
come at the hands of the only two teams
of higher rank — No. 1 UCLA and No. 2
Southern California.
But as they continue their NCAA title
pursuit, that trend is one the Cardinal
would very much like to break. And last
week, coming off a two-week competitive
lull to take on No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara
and the 2004 champion Women of Troy,
the Cardinal had the chance to do just
that.
Stanford's spring season opener came
against a tough Gaucho squad, and the
Cardinal still seemed to be working off
exam-week rust as the two teams played
a scoreless first period. But in the second
quarter, things started to click for the
Cardinal in both ends of the pool.
"Our defense was nails during the ma
jority of this game, especially the second
quarter." junior Val Riss said. "We
forced them to dump the ball into the cor
ner numerous times because of the shot
clock."
In addition to their smothering defen
sive play, the Cardinal coordinated their
offensive effort to notch four goals in the
quarter. The last of the four came from
the hand of freshman driver Megan May
with one second remaining in the half to
put the Cardinal up 4-1.
Senior captain Hannah Luber tallied
her only goal of the day 1:37 into the third
quarter to increase Stanford's lead to

four. The Gauchos, however, refused to
quit and netted two unanswered goals be
fore the end of the quarter to cut the Car
dinal's lead in half heading into the final
period of play.
Neither team managed to score as the
clock wound down toward the two
minute mark until junior driver Laurel
Champion put a lob into the back of the
net to put the Cardinal up 6-3. Still, the
Gauchos recorded two more goals before
the final buzzer.
"They scored the last goal on a time
out play," jiihior two-meter Nancy El-
Sakkary said. "It was a great shot, but we
definitely can't allow a shot like that, es
pecially in the last few seconds of a
game."
"I think that we fell apart a little in the
last minute of the game, and that's some
thing we really need to work on - our end
of-game toughness," Riss added.
Immediately following the conclusion
of their UC-Santa Barbara game, the
members of the women's squad focused
their attention on their Saturday after
noon rematch with the Women of Troy.
In their first meeting this season, in the
2005 Daktronics Invitational semifinals,
USC turned a match that was close at the
half into a dominant 9-4 victory. Realiz
ing that the one-man advantage battle
had been the deciding factor of the first
match, the Cardinal made defending the
six-on-five advantage the top priority of
their practices leading up to the rematch.
The strategy paid off, but the Cardinal
still fell. 6-5, in double-overtime.
"Our five-on-six defense was great,"
El-Sakkary said. "Last time we played
them they scored on all six of their six-on
five opportunities, but this time we
Women of Troy score game winner in double overtime

blocked most of them."
The Women of Troy managed to con
vert only one of their six-on-five opportu
nities. Several of their other attempts were
thwarted by the Cardinal's solid coverage
and field shot-blocks.
The Cardinal offense also came out fir
ing. Junior driver Scotti Shafer put the
Cardinal on the board 14 seconds into the
game and was followed by sophomore
Katie Hansen, who buried a power play
goal to put the Cardinal up by two. South
ern California junior Lauren Wenger tal
lied the Women of Troy's first goal of the

day, hut Shafer responded with her second
goal of the day less than a minute later to
rebuild the Cardinal's lead to two.
The second quarter passed uneventful
ly after USC sophomore Erika Figge's
goal at 6:02 to bring her team within one
going into the second half of play.
The dramatic tension built as the two
teams broke their huddles to start the sec
ond half, and after three minutes of back
and-forth play, the Women of Troy posted
their third goal to tie it up. At 2:55, Luber
won possession of a rebound by fighting
off two USC defenders, then tipped a shot

into the back of the net to put the Cardinal
back on top.
Seconds later in the other end of the
pool, sophomore goalie Meridith McColl
turned in a highlight reel play of her own.
USC was awarded a penalty shot follow
ing a foul by senior captain Kelty Luber,
but McColl rose to the occasion to make
the save on the four-meter shot to main
tain the Cardinal's lead.
The see-saw battle continued when
Figge lied the game up again for USC with
1:54 remaining in the period, but Hansen
converted a penalty shot with six seconds

remaining in the period to put Stanford up
5-4- ... 4 I . nt WOiTAJO i
USC sophomore utility Brittany Hayes
notched her first goal Of the day 2:10 into
the fourth quarter to make the score 5-5.
And despite intense physical play and
timeouts by both teams during the final
minute of regulation play, the score re
mained the same.
Neither team managed anything more
than a scoring opportunity during the first
overtime period. The second overtime pe
riod proceeded in similar fashion until
Hayes ended it with three seconds remain

ing. Two Cardinal players were able to get
their lingers onto the shot, but neither was
able to prevent it from finding its way to
the back of the cage.
"Unfortunately, we still didn't consis
tently play our best, and there are a lot of
things we could have done to prevent los
ing," Hansen said. "But we'll come away
from this game knowing that if we play
with that level of intensity consistently,
it'll take a lot for any team to beat us."
The Cardinal look to regain their mo
mentum when they travel to Stockton,
Calif., this weekend to take on Pacific.

timeouts by both teams during the final
minute of regulation play, the score re
mained the same.
Neither team managed anything more
than a scoring opportunity during the first
overtime period. The second overtime pe
riod proceeded in similar fashion until
Hayes ended it with three seconds remain

ing. Two Cardinal players were able to get
their lingers onto the shot, but neither was
able to prevent it from finding its way to
the back of the cage.
"Unfortunately, we still didn't consis
tently play our best, and there are a lot of
things we could have done to prevent los
ing," Hansen said. "But we'll come away
from this game knowing that if we play
with that level of intensity consistently,
it'll take a lot for any team to beat us."
The Cardinal look to regain their mo
mentum when they travel to Stockton,
Calif., this weekend to take on Pacific.

The Cardinal had hoped to upset the national rankings by outdoing USC, but were still pleased with their strong showing against both UC-Santa Barbara and the Women of Troy.
Entering the final month of its regular
season schedule, the record of the No. 3
women's water polo team (11-4. 4-2
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
stands almost exactly as the Collegiate
Women's Top 20 Poll says it should. Of
the Cardinal's four losses, three have
come at the hands of the only two teams
of higher rank — No. 1 UCLA and No. 2
Southern California.
But as they continue their NCAA title
pursuit, that trend is one the Cardinal
would very much like to break. And last
week, coming off a two-week competitive
lull to take on No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara
and the 2004 champion Women of Troy,
the Cardinal had the chance to do just
that.
Stanford's spring season opener came
against a tough Gaucho squad, and the
Cardinal still seemed to be working off
exam-week rust as the two teams played
a scoreless first period. But in the second
quarter, things started to click for the
Cardinal in both ends of the pool.
"Our defense was nails during the ma
jority of this game, especially the second
quarter." junior Val Riss said. "We
forced them to dump the ball into the cor
ner numerous times because of the shot
clock."
In addition to their smothering defen
sive play, the Cardinal coordinated their
offensive effort to notch four goals in the
quarter. The last of the four came from
the hand of freshman driver Megan May
with one second remaining in the half to
put the Cardinal up 4-1.
Senior captain Hannah Luber tallied
her only goal of the day 1:37 into the third
quarter to increase Stanford's lead to

four. The Gauchos, however, refused to
quit and netted two unanswered goals be
fore the end of the quarter to cut the Car
dinal's lead in half heading into the final
period of play.
Neither team managed to score as the
clock wound down toward the two
minute mark until junior driver Laurel
Champion put a lob into the back of the
net to put the Cardinal up 6-3. Still, the
Gauchos recorded two more goals before
the final buzzer.
"They scored the last goal on a time
out play," jiihior two-meter Nancy El-
Sakkary said. "It was a great shot, but we
definitely can't allow a shot like that, es
pecially in the last few seconds of a
game."
"I think that we fell apart a little in the
last minute of the game, and that's some
thing we really need to work on - our end
of-game toughness," Riss added.
Immediately following the conclusion
of their UC-Santa Barbara game, the
members of the women's squad focused
their attention on their Saturday after
noon rematch with the Women of Troy.
In their first meeting this season, in the
2005 Daktronics Invitational semifinals,
USC turned a match that was close at the
half into a dominant 9-4 victory. Realiz
ing that the one-man advantage battle
had been the deciding factor of the first
match, the Cardinal made defending the
six-on-five advantage the top priority of
their practices leading up to the rematch.
The strategy paid off, but the Cardinal
still fell. 6-5, in double-overtime.
"Our five-on-six defense was great,"
El-Sakkary said. "Last time we played
them they scored on all six of their six-on
five opportunities, but this time we
Women of Troy score game winner in double overtime

blocked most of them."
The Women of Troy managed to con
vert only one of their six-on-five opportu
nities. Several of their other attempts were
thwarted by the Cardinal's solid coverage
and field shot-blocks.
The Cardinal offense also came out fir
ing. Junior driver Scotti Shafer put the
Cardinal on the board 14 seconds into the
game and was followed by sophomore
Katie Hansen, who buried a power play
goal to put the Cardinal up by two. South
ern California junior Lauren Wenger tal
lied the Women of Troy's first goal of the

day, hut Shafer responded with her second
goal of the day less than a minute later to
rebuild the Cardinal's lead to two.
The second quarter passed uneventful
ly after USC sophomore Erika Figge's
goal at 6:02 to bring her team within one
going into the second half of play.
The dramatic tension built as the two
teams broke their huddles to start the sec
ond half, and after three minutes of back
and-forth play, the Women of Troy posted
their third goal to tie it up. At 2:55, Luber
won possession of a rebound by fighting
off two USC defenders, then tipped a shot

into the back of the net to put the Cardinal
back on top.
Seconds later in the other end of the
pool, sophomore goalie Meridith McColl
turned in a highlight reel play of her own.
USC was awarded a penalty shot follow
ing a foul by senior captain Kelty Luber,
but McColl rose to the occasion to make
the save on the four-meter shot to main
tain the Cardinal's lead.
The see-saw battle continued when
Figge lied the game up again for USC with
1:54 remaining in the period, but Hansen
converted a penalty shot with six seconds

remaining in the period to put Stanford up
5-4- ... 4 I . nt WOiTAJO i
USC sophomore utility Brittany Hayes
notched her first goal Of the day 2:10 into
the fourth quarter to make the score 5-5.
And despite intense physical play and
timeouts by both teams during the final
minute of regulation play, the score re
mained the same.
Neither team managed anything more
than a scoring opportunity during the first
overtime period. The second overtime pe
riod proceeded in similar fashion until
