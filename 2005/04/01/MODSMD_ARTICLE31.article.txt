# No. 10 Cardinal host UC-Irvine
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford fans are mourning the
end of the basketball season, but the
volleyball team sees the brighter side
of things. With the court now open at
the newly renovated Maples Pavilion,
all but one of their remaining home
games this season will be held there.
The first of these games will take
place tonight, when the No. 10 Cardi
nal (9-11,8-9 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) host No. 13 UC-Irvine (6-
17,4-12).
In Stanford's previous meeting
with the Anteaters this season, the
Cardinal won with a shutout. What
made the victory even more impres
sive was that it came at Irvine, where
the Anteaters have found much more
success this season than on the road.
Their home record is currently 5-6.
while on the road the Anteaters are
only 1 -8.
Irvine is not a team to be tossed
aside lightly, however. In the third and
final game of that previous match, the
Anteaters pushed Stanford into extra
points before the Cardinal sealed a
31-29 victory.
Irvine sophomore Jayson Jablon
sky leads his team with 305 kills, while
the most kills for Stanford are rela
tively evenly spread between seniors
Craig Buell (211) and David Vogel
(230) and junior Ben Reddy, who
leads the team with 238.
The Cardinal defense is also evenly
distributed among sophomore libero
Brian Lindberg with 146 digs, redshirt
senior Kevin Hansen with 139 and
Vogel with 150.
The Anteaters look primarily to
sophomore Brandon Mel for defen
sive plays, as he leads the team with 149
digs this season. The only other Irvine
player with triple-digit digs is sopho
more Brian Thornton with 117.
By the numbers, then, the Stan
ford team hopes to defeat the
Anteaters this evening in preparation
for what should be a much tougher
match Saturday against No. 2 UCLA
(20-3,13-3 MPSF).
Offensively, the Bruins are a much
more balanced team than Irvine is.
Three of their players have over 200
kills apiece: redshirt seniors Jonathan
Acosta (242) and Paul Johnson (283),
as well as redshirt junior Allan Vince
(203). Senior Kris Kraushaar is close
to breaking the 200 mark with 190
kills and sophomore Steve Kloster
man is not far behind with 181.
Facing a UCLA team just as offen
sively balanced as they are, the Cardi
nal will have to be stronger defensive
ly if they want to achieve the upset. In
their previous meeting with the Bru
ins this season, the Cardinal had only
six team blocks, while the Bruins had
11. and Stanford's hitting percentage
fell to a negative .059 in the second
game.
However, the Cardinal rallied
halfway through that match. Down two
games and facing defeat, they pulled
ahead to a 25-21 lead in game three,
only to let UCLA come back to tie at
31-31. Instead of giving up, Stanford
scored two consecutive points to win
the game 33-31. But in game four, the
Cardinal fell from a 12-12 tie to lose the
game, 26-30, and the match.
Tomorrow evening, a more expe
rienced Stanford team will attempt to
pull off the upset they missed the last
time.
