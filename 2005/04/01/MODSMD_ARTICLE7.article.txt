# Pac-10 baseball squads proving unpredictable
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Layng down preseason bets is an enter
taining part of being a baseball fan. But if you
were hoping that it would also be a lucrative
activity, here's hoping that you paid no atten
tion to the Pacific-10 Conference coaches
when they projected conference finishes back
in January. With the conference schedule
starting on the West Coast, the favorites
(Stanford, Washington and Arizona State)
are faltering, the bottom dwellers (California
and Oregon State) are well poised to be spoil
ers and a certain team from Tucson, Ariz.,
looks determined to win the league crown.
As fortune would have it, the No. 12 Car
dinal-who some would argue maintain such a
high ranking by reputation and not exception
al play-kick off the league season against one
of the Pac-10's weaker squads, the Washing
ton State Cougars. The Cougars are already
off to the worst conference record in the Pac
-10. having been the victims of a Cal sweep, but
the young, inexperienced team and its brand
new head coach are not to be overlooked.
WSU was picked fora dead-last finish at
the start of the season, but at this point,
UCLA seems a much more likely contender
for that distinction. The Cougars are just
above .500 on the year, but the team's 6-8
away record prompts the possibility that a lit
tle home-field advantage could make WSU a
bigger surprise than it already has been.
While Washington State's decent season
start was unforeseen, no one — except maybe
OSU's coaching staff — could possibly have
predicted the early-season performances of
the Beavers, whom the Cardinal will face next
weekend. Oregon State was selected to fin
ished sixth in the Pac-10, considered to be a
not-too-special team with a couple of solid
athletes. Three months later, OSU is getting
national attention, as the Beavers have
amassed the Pac-10's best record (21-4) and
been catapulted into the No. 18 spot in the
country.
The Beavers are currently batting at a .319
clip as a team (second best in the conference)
and own the league's best ERA at 2.75. Jaco
by Ellsbury and Dallas Buck, whose summer
league performances were impressive to say

the least, have taken the team onto their
shoulders and led the way for the Beavers.
Ellsbury is batting .427 in 25 starts, while Buck
is one of two OSU starters with an unblem
ished 5-0 record and an ERA below 1 .(X).
The Cardinal's third conference series of
the season won't be a lock either, as Stanford
will face No. 24 Arizona State in Tempe. The
Sun Devils have struggled to a 18-13 record,
but the numbers are misleading. The team
began the season at No. 9. but has maintained
its national ranking by hanging tough with the
most unenviable non-conference schedule in
the Pac-10, dropping games only to elite
teams like No. 4Tulane, No. 5 Louisiana State
and No. 22 Long Beach State.
As preseason predictors knew, ASU
strength is in the bat, not on the mound, and cer
tainly not in the field. Like Washington State,
the ASU's season has been held together by its
offense-seven players are batting above .300. in
cluding Travis Buck, who, with his .362 average
and 18 extra-base hit, has emerged as one of the
conference's premier hitters.
The Cardinal, however, could match up
well against ASU, as Stanford's precise pitch
ing would neutralize the Sun Devils' power
threats. ASU's in-state rival might not be as
easily halted, however.
The No. 10 Arizona Wildcats, whom Stan
ford will face at the end of the conference sea
son, are a veritable reincarnation of the Car
dinal's 2004 squad. Decent pitching, unstop
pable hitting, a lineup that the most casual col
lege fan would recognize as a force, top to bot
tom.
The irony of it all is that Arizona is a jug
gernaut that few saw barreling into such
prominence. The Wildcats were only predict
ed to finish fourth in the conference, behind
Stanford. ASU and Washington. Now, with
an 18-10 record and its only series losses com
ing against top-ranked Texas and No. 2
Fullerton, Arizona has proven the oracle of
Pac-10 predictions wrong. However, offense
can usually only get you a conference crown.
Success in the postseason is about pitching
and defense, and just as Stanford's offensive
potency in '04 failed to send it to Omaha, the
'Cats could suffer a similar fate.

Junior catcher John Hester is one of several defensively tough Cardinal players, who, along with the Stanford pitching staff, put
the team in a good position to top the league's offense-heavy squads.
