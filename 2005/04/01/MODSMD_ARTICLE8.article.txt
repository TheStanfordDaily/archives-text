## Social events raise election awareness 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
Before the official ballot for this year's
spring elections is posted online next Wednes
day, the ASSU is hosting many activities for
candidates and students to increase voter
turnout.
According to Graduate Student Council
Chair Moriah Thomason. a fourth-year doc
toral candidate in neuroscience, there are two
main strategies that the GSC is using to en
courage the student body to rock the vote.
"The first is that we try to increase the num
ber of candidates," Thomason said. "And the
second is to get the information out about the
candidates so that people know who they are
and about the voting date."
Each year, 15 voting members are elected
to the GSC, and this year. Thomason said that
there are approximately 30 candidates run
ning for the slots.
To raise election awareness, GSC mem
bers spread the word within their respective
graduate schools, attending mixers and hand
ing out special GSC chapsticks.
"The chapsticks read 'Run for GSC,' and
have the date of the elections, the elections
Web site and the nominations committee
Web site," Thomason said. "And it was a pret
ty good flavor."
In addition, the GSC hosted a party at the
Graduate Community Center last night
where the GSC and ASSU executive slate
candidates mingled with graduate stu
dents.
"Our particular problem is that
graduate students don't realize what the
ASSU is, who the candidates are and
how they can affect our lives," said
Deputy C 'hair of the GSC Roger Stan
ley, a second-year student at the Gradu
ate Sch(K)l of Business. "So this is a
chance to come and meet these candi
dates and ask questions."
According to Thomason, the party
marked the first time that graduate stu
dents from all over campus were invited
to a forum for candidates to speak to
possible constituents.
The Elections Commission has also
been involved in planning several events
for the undergraduate student body. On
Monday night there will be an executive
debate in Tresidder Union near the
Pete's Coffee for students to attend and
ask questions of the candidates.
According to Elections Commis
sioner Troy Steinmetz, a sophomore,
such events are designed to spark peo
ple's interest as they go about their ev
eryday lives.
"We decided to bring the Senate
candidates to the voters," Steinmetz
said. "So we're going to be doing a din
ing hall tour of the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate candidates."
The candidates visited Florence
Moore Dining Hall yesterday and will
visit Stern today, Wilbur on Monday
and Lagunita on Tuesday.

For the individual class slates, the
elections commission has planned a bar
beque lunch at Lake Lag on Saturday
for juniors to learn about the prospec
tive senior class presidents and a water
balloon light later in the afternoon on
Roble Field for freshmen to do the
same.
"We keep trying to go back to the
idea of having events that people want
to come to just to enjoy themselves and
meet the candidates while they're
there," Steinmetz said.
On Tuesday afternoon there will be a
special-fees lair in White Plaza that will
give students the opportunity to ask
questions about groups and their bud
gets before making their decisions.
Attracting a high voter turnout at
this year's election is important to the
ASSU for several reasons.
Stanley said he believed that when few
students vote it creates an issue of sam
pling bias.
"If you have a small percentage that
votes, you sort of wonder who that small
percentage is and whether they're all the
same." Stanley said. "Frankly, I don't
think it's a random sample. If the word
doesn't reach certain areas, they be
come disenfranchised. We don't want
the election to be determined by a small
number of people."
Steinmetz stated that when more peo
ple vote, it's a clear indication that polit
ical and social awareness among stu
dents is on the rise.
"It's not just the number as much as it is
the message that a high voter turnout
sends," he said. "The more people you
get to vote, the more aware they are of
the ASSU and the more aware they are
of what the ASSU does."
