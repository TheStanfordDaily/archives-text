## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
This year the ASSU Undergraduate Senate is
placing an item called Measure A on the ballot,
which, if approved, could change the way Univer
sity fees are distributed.
Under the current system, general fees, which
are collected as a portion of Stanford students'
special fees on the University bill each quarter, are
divided into a programming fund and a communi
ty service fund. Both of these funds are used to

support student groups.
In recent years, however, there has not been
enough money in the programming funds and a
surplus of community funds.
if passed by the student body next week. Mea
sure A would combine the programming funds
and the community service funds without increas
ing the total amount of general fees. This is in
tended to give the Senate greater flexibility in al
locating funds to student organizations.
More information on the measure can be found
at yesona.stanford.edu.
