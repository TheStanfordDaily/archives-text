# Stanford Catholics reflect on pope's life
## Millions mourn pope's death 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the death of Pope John
Paul II late Saturday evening,
people all over the world, in
cluding members of the Stanford
community, went into mourning.
He died of heart and kidney
problems complicated by unsta
ble blood pressure. Until his fu
neral, expected to take place be
fore Wednesday, his body will
lie instate in St. Peter's Basilica.
Born Karol Wojtyla in
Krakow. Poland, he was the first
non-Italian pope in more than
450 years. He was also the most
traveled pontiff, having visited
more than 120 countries since he
was elected pope in 1978.
The Vatican describes the
pope as "the perpetual and visi
ble principle and foundation of
unity of both the bishops and of
the faithful."
"I'm very saddened by the
pope's death." said Father Carl
Schlichte, associate director and
parochial vicar of Stanford's
campus Catholic ministry.
"It is always hard to watch
someone that you know suffer
fora long time," he said, reflect
ing on the death of his parents.

"I had a very visceral reaction to
what the holy father seemed to
have been going through."
The Catholic Community at
Stanford — a religious group of
students, staff, faculty and their
families — will likely have a
memorial mass in the pope's
memory. A special prayer was
said in his honor Sunday morn
ing at Memorial Church, said
Veronica Juarez, Class of 2004,
currently an intern for the
Catholic Community at Stan
ford. Another event may be or
ganized contingent upon student
interest, she added.
Juarez spoke about the shock
she experienced when she heard
about the pope's death.
"You were aware that he was
sick," Juarez said. "But for it to
actually happen is a totally dif
ferent thing — the actual head
of your faith has now passed on
and for many of us, especially
students at Stanford, he has
been the only pope we have
known."
Sophomore Dennis Adams
echoed Juarez' sentiments.
"For me he meant a lot be
cause he has been the pope for
my entire life," he said.
"After a day of contemplat-

ing and thinking about the fu
ture of the church, it makes me
really happy to have had him as
a pope," Adams added. "He was
an amazing leader for the church
and unwaveringly devoted to the
transmission of truth to the
faithful."

Juarez said the pope will be
remembered for many things —
reaching out to other faiths,
traveling to many countries,
learning many languages and
pardoning the man who attempt
ed to murder him.
