# Feminist scholars gather
## 
### MICHAEL TAMKIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
To evaluate the impact feminist
scholarship has had on history, sci
ence. gender relations and culture,
Stanford's Institute for Research on
Women and Gender, or IRWG, held a
conference Saturday in honor of its
30th anniversary. The conference em
phasized the importance of feminist
scholarship in developing balanced
ideas and affecting cultural change.
The event, entitled " The Knowl
edge Revolution" and held at the
Stanford Humanities Center, was at
tended by over KM) people, including
members of I RWG and the general
public. The event kicked off with a
plenary composed of two talks called
"Revolutionizing Knowledge, East
and West."
The first speaker was Karen
Offen, a senior scholar at the IRWG
and one of the conference coordina
tors, who opened by defining the
term "knowledge revolution."
"A knowledge revolution happens
when feminist scholars — women and
some men — cease to be deferential

to the received wisdom of the elders,
the professors," she said. "It happens
when we challenge authority, when
we begin to question the wisdom and
focus of the textbooks and the canoni
cal ideas, priorities and narratives of
the great 'dead white men.' "
She argued that knowledge has
never been gender neutral, at least in
the western world.
"How do we know what we know,
how and why do we know it?" She
asked the audience. "And who de
cides what is important or not impor
tant?"
Offen then highlighted advances
feminist scholars have made in such
diverse fields as history, sociology,
anthropology, political theory, phi
losophy and literature, focusing
specifically on the evolution of femi
nist contributions in France.
"In the 1850s, a series of French
women began systematically to chal
lenge male-centered knowledge,"
she said. "This kicked off a period
which 1 have called the European
'knowledge wars.' To counter this
enormous anti-feminist current,
women called for the study of a real

women's history and a womanly ap
proach to the sciences and philoso
phy."
Offen ended her talk by praising
the work of fellow IRWCi scholars
and offering a vision for the future.
Offen called the feminist revolution
"still unfinished" and said that "the
knowledge revolution won't stick un
less it is passed on."
The second speaker of the "East
and West" plenary was Wang Zheng,
associate professor of Women's Stud
ies at the University of Michigan and
former IRWCi scholar. Zheng spoke
about her research on late 20th cen
tury Chinese feminism.
She explained that following Mao,
women's issues came to the forefront
of national dialogue as China transi
tioned to a market economy.
"New scientists tried to shape
modern femininity by creating corn
modified femininity," Zheng said.
"Authorities and commodiliers rein
forced new gender boundaries to
even include blatant sexism, where
the label 'women's studies' was ap
propriated to many things, such as
how to be lady-like."
She also called the increasing
number courses on women in gender
in China and in the United States an
"empowering experience for many
students. The goal of curriculum rev
olution is to create an intellectual
space that enables critical thinking
that can result in cultural changes."
Zheng ended her speech by de
scribing the difficulty of forming fem
inist groups in China due to the fear
of communist censorship, but added
that ultimately women in China must
"either forge ahead or be swept
back."
After the speeches, the confer
ence split into five workshops, enti
tled "Seeing Art Differently;"
"Third and Fourth Gender Women
in Native North America;" "Unveil
ing the Veil and Gender Issues in the
Middle East;" "Raising Boys;" and
"The Bio/Politics of Late Mother
hood."
The conference ended with a
closing plenary on the future of fem
inist scholarship. After a brief intro
duction by IRWG Senior Scholar
Marilyn Yalom, former IRWG
scholar Shelly Fishkin, director of
the American studies program, gave
a speech exploring the relationship
between feminist studies and the in
terdisciplinary field of American
studies.
"These fields intersect in four
areas: transnational questions, schol
ars complicating gender with race,
class and ethnicity, previously ig
nored groups gaining new attention
and broad narratives transformed
with women."
Fishkin said she hoped the confer
ence gave attendees a new perspec
tive on feminist issues.
"1 hope they will realize that fem
inist scholarship has had an impact on
everything that we study and teach,
and has the potential to continue to
shape our research agendas in the fu
ture in very productive ways," she
said. "It is a field that is continuing to
expand grow, and change."
