### MICHAEL TAMKIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
To evaluate the impact feminist
scholarship has had on history, sci
ence. gender relations and culture,
Stanford's Institute for Research on
Women and Gender, or IRWG, held a
conference Saturday in honor of its
30th anniversary. The conference em
phasized the importance of feminist
scholarship in developing balanced
ideas and affecting cultural change.
The event, entitled " The Knowl
edge Revolution" and held at the
Stanford Humanities Center, was at
tended by over KM) people, including
members of I RWG and the general
public. The event kicked off with a
plenary composed of two talks called
"Revolutionizing Knowledge, East
and West."
The first speaker was Karen
Offen, a senior scholar at the IRWG
and one of the conference coordina
tors, who opened by defining the
term "knowledge revolution."
"A knowledge revolution happens
when feminist scholars — women and
some men — cease to be deferential

to the received wisdom of the elders,
the professors," she said. "It happens
when we challenge authority, when
we begin to question the wisdom and
focus of the textbooks and the canoni
cal ideas, priorities and narratives of
the great 'dead white men.' "
She argued that knowledge has
never been gender neutral, at least in
the western world.
"How do we know what we know,
how and why do we know it?" She
asked the audience. "And who de
cides what is important or not impor
tant?"
Offen then highlighted advances
feminist scholars have made in such
diverse fields as history, sociology,
anthropology, political theory, phi
losophy and literature, focusing
specifically on the evolution of femi
nist contributions in France.
"In the 1850s, a series of French
women began systematically to chal
lenge male-centered knowledge,"
she said. "This kicked off a period
which 1 have called the European
'knowledge wars.' To counter this
enormous anti-feminist current,
women called for the study of a real

women's history and a womanly ap
proach to the sciences and philoso
phy."
Offen ended her talk by praising
the work of fellow IRWCi scholars
and offering a vision for the future.
Offen called the feminist revolution
"still unfinished" and said that "the
knowledge revolution won't stick un
less it is passed on."
The second speaker of the "East
and West" plenary was Wang Zheng,
associate professor of Women's Stud
ies at the University of Michigan and
former IRWCi scholar. Zheng spoke
about her research on late 20th cen
tury Chinese feminism.
She explained that following Mao,
women's issues came to the forefront
of national dialogue as China transi
tioned to a market economy.
"New scientists tried to shape
modern femininity by creating corn
modified femininity," Zheng said.
"Authorities and commodiliers rein
forced new gender boundaries to
even include blatant sexism, where
the label 'women's studies' was ap
