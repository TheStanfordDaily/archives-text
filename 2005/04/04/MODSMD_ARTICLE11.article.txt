# X chromosomes differ by gender

### GREG PRINCE DAILY COLLEGIAN 
(U-WIRE) UNIVERSITY
PARK, Pa. — Women now have an
other way to differentiate them
selves from men.
The chromosomal difference be
tween the sexes is larger than origi
nally thought, according to a study
released last week by a team of inter
national researchers that was co-au
thored by a Pennsylvania State Uni
versity professor.
Chromosomes are the small
packets of information in DNA that
determine how an organism will de
velop. The X and Y chromosomes
determine gender.
"The X chromosome is pretty big.
consisting of almost 1,100 genes,"

while the Y chromosome is much
smaller, having about one-third the
number of genes, said Laura Carrel,
assistant professor of biochemistry
and molecular biology at the College
of Medicine.
The combination of an X chro
mosome and a Y chromosome will
make an organism male, while two
X's will make it female.
Normally, one of the X chromo
somes in females is inactivated, or
"turned off," so that women and
men will have similar doses of X-as
sociated genes, which are thought to
be important in development. Carrel
said.
This means that females could
have two times the amount of genet
ic information if one of their X chro
mosomes were not turned off before

development. Carrel said.
"It is known that some genes es
cape this inactivation," she said.
In her most recent study. Carrel
and Huntington Willard.of the Insti
tute for Genome Sciences and Policy
at Duke University, were able to de
termine which genes were escaping
the inactivation.
There are three types of genes
that remain active, said Sharon
Shriver, assistant professor of biolo
gy. The pseudoautosomal gene is
needed for pairing in cell division,
the X-inactivation gene keeps the
chromosome inactive, and then
there are a handful of other genes
that are not actively used but can still
be activated.
"There are 'leaky' genes on the in
active chromosome," Shiver said,
"genes where researchers are able to
see a little expression."
In each of the 40 human female
subjects in the study, 94 genes on the X
chromosome were studied for expres
sion from the inactive chromosome.
Carrel said. Of the genes studied, 15
percent were the same in all of the sub
jects. while 10 percent were expressed
in some, but not all. of the subjects and
at variable levels.
"That handful of genes is much
larger than researchers originally
thought," Carrel said.
This inactive expression means
that some of the genes in females will
be expressed at a higher level than in

males, she added.
Carrel said that group of genes that
were expressed variably is what causes
differences between females.
One unique finding in the study
was that the genes that remain ex
pressed on the inactive chromosome
cluster together. Carrel said.
"They tend to be in areas that are
evolutionarily more recent," she
added.
In some cases, the extra expression
could lead to no noticeable changes.
Carrel said. However, in other areas,
the extra protein could have a signifi
cant impact on the genetic develop
ment.
These genes should be recognized
as potential factors in how certain dis
eases become manifest in females, she
said.
With the recent completion of the
X chromosome sequence, researchers
may get a better understanding of this
phenomenon, Shriver said.
