# X chromosomes differ by gender

PARK, Pa. â€” Women now have an
other way to differentiate them
selves from men.
The chromosomal difference be
tween the sexes is larger than origi
nally thought, according to a study
released last week by a team of inter
national researchers that was co-au
thored by a Pennsylvania State Uni
versity professor.
Chromosomes are the small
packets of information in DNA that
determine how an organism will de
velop. The X and Y chromosomes
determine gender.
"The X chromosome is pretty big.
consisting of almost 1,100 genes,"

while the Y chromosome is much
smaller, having about one-third the
number of genes, said Laura Carrel,
assistant professor of biochemistry
and molecular biology at the College
of Medicine.
The combination of an X chro
mosome and a Y chromosome will
make an organism male, while two
X's will make it female.
Normally, one of the X chromo
somes in females is inactivated, or
"turned off," so that women and
men will have similar doses of X-as
sociated genes, which are thought to
be important in development. Carrel
said.
This means that females could
have two times the amount of genet
ic information if one of their X chro
mosomes were not turned off before

development. Carrel said.
"It is known that some genes es
cape this inactivation," she said.
In her most recent study. Carrel
and Huntington Willard.of the Insti
tute for Genome Sciences and Policy
at Duke University, were able to de
termine which genes were escaping
the inactivation.
There are three types of genes
that remain active, said Sharon
Shriver, assistant professor of biolo
gy. The pseudoautosomal gene is
needed for pairing in cell division,
the X-inactivation gene keeps the
chromosome inactive, and then
there are a handful of other genes
that are not actively used but can still
be activated.
