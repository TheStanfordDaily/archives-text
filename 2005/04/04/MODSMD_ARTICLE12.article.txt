On April 4 1967, The Daily pub
lished an article on students getting
high off of a curiously growing list of
everyday foods and products. Appar
ently, smoking bananas should be
done only under the most desperate
of circumstances. Below is an excerpt:
"From one-a-day vitamins to nut
meg, your local grocer now offers the
easiest journey to 'Psychedelia.'
" 'There is a new emphasis on ex
perimentation these days,' reports a
sophomore. 'It was once a big thing
just to smoke pot or take acid, but how
when nearly half the student body has
tried one or the other, there is a need
for something new.'
"It seems that kicks just keep get
ting easier to find, and in strange ways.
" 'I smoked every brand of tea
available and nothing happened,'
sighed one frustrated coed, but other
results are more spectacular. Alter a
complex process of boiling, straining,
filtering and separating ordinary
paraffin wax, a history grad student
claims he can gather a small quantity
of opium and many a migrant worker
gets 'drunk' on the semi-solid fuel
Sterno.
"The traditional Indian and South
American psychedelicacies that have
dove into use here include beetle nuts,
the Magic Mushroom, peyote and

even marijuana.
"But what are the highlights of the
grocer)' shelves? Seven-Up and as
pirin, perhaps, and there's always nut
meg. saffron or bananas fora change.
Other enticements include morning
glory seeds [boiled], vitamins and the
gas from whipped cream cans [do not
shake, let contents settle at bottom,
and inhale fumes],
"And what mother would imagine
that the miracle medicine pargoric
that soothes a baby's teething pains is
a camphorated tincture of opium?
"But the dangers also present them
selves. Laughing gas, N2O, which is
the gas that propels the whipping
cream, and various deodorants can be
fatal if misused. Nutmeg, which is im
bibed as a 'tea,' is fatal after four
spoonfuls. Vitamins, pep pills, and as
pirin are dangerous in excess and the
various other ways to get high affect
people differently.
"For instance, the recently popular
ized banana smoking is considered 'a
mild, pleasant experience' by some,
while the Otero men reported in a
Letter to the Editor in The San Fran
cisco Chronicle that they tried smok
ing the banana, but suggested "eating
it raw.'"
