# Water in the milk bottle
## Who is my Jesus? 
### 
I've spent a lot of time puzzling over
the core question of youthful angst —
what should 1 do with my life? I have
yet to come up with an answer, but as the
end of my Stanford career draws near, it
seems it might be useful to formulate at
least a tentative one — soon.
I've been faced with many difficult
questions before, such as "What is the an
tiderivative of f(x) = In sin (x A x A 2)?"
Now, if I were to identify just one invalu
able thing that I've gotten out of my Stan
ford education, it would be the ability to
address these complex issues in a calm
and efficient manner. As long as you
haven't signed the honor code, turn and
ask a neighbor.
In the past month. I've been asking all
around. I started with my friends, who ap
parently see my unfortunate dilemma as
an opportunity to point out my character
Haws and offer no solutions.
"You are commitment-phobic," they
say. "Do whatever you want."
The lack of sympathy is frustrating,
but I have to forgive them. They may be
annoyingly model students destined for

equally annoying fu
ture success, but they,
too, question their life
choices with some fre
quency. So I decided
to move on to the peo
ple who've really got it
made — my profes
sors.
The venerable aca
demics, it appears,
have achieved consen-

sus on advice for young people in doubt:
Stay in school as long as possible. After
all, as my adviser assured me, "It's a scary
world out there. Just stay and get as many
degrees as you can."
The academics love academia. I sup
pose a sharper person would have figured
that one out and skipped the office hours.
I'm sure by now that academia isn't for
me. It's all about narrowing down that
specialization, that one tiny point of elite
knowledge that three other people in the
world understand. If this is your "pas
sion," then well and good, but that
doesn't quite apply to me.
I'm all about breadth over depth —
the comments on my English papers at
test to that. When 1 point this out to profs,
they nod, but still suggest the doctorate.
In essence, my professors are telling me
exactly what they would do if they were
me — they would be themselves.
I think what 1 need is a role model. I
need someone I admire, whose life I want
to pattern mine after. And if I follow
closely enough in the footsteps of my bold
predecessor, I will find the same grail,
reach the same higher plane. From within
the bubble, though, it's difficult to find
someone I admire in a field I might con
sider.
Fortunately, there's media. The media
bring me the opinions of thousands of
celebrities and public figures without any
need for me to ask. The life of my famous
role model would be well known and
therefore easy to follow through the
guide of biography, common pop-cultur
al trivia and Google.
Think WWJD bracelets or the boys of
South Park singing "What would Brian
Boitano do?" Who is my Jesus, my Brian
Boitano? For Stanford's many tech-savvy
entrepreneurs — who is my Bill Gates?
The obvious choice, of course, is Jon
Stewart. Never mind that I am neither
Jewish nor a man. Nor do I have the par
ticular configuration of facial features
that make his look of bemusement so
invitingly comic. But Jon Stewart is total
ly the shit, and I totally want to be Jon
Stewart. I want to be brilliantly quick-wit
ted. I want every college student to watch
me deliver fake news and make bawdy
jokes about politicians. I want to have
streaming video on Comedy Central.com.
But there are obvious impediments to
these worthy goals. Besides the facial fea
tures, I am not particularly quick-witted,
and I do not have the energetic TV per
sonality and the cojones to broadcast
bawdy jokes that might possibly be heard
by my family.
In other words. I am not Jon Stewart.
My choice of role model is still restricted
by my own natural tendencies, and the
question of who I want to imitate reduces
to the question with which I began —
what do I want to do with my life? A
sharper person might have figured that
one out much earlier, too.
Meanwhile, as long as I've mistakenly
started down this path, I will continue to
work on my fake news bulletin and twist
my neck while pulling at my tie (Why
does he do that?) and eventually, I hope,
I'll figure it out as I go.

If vou are some smart-ass math major
who wants to give me some smart-ass an
swer to the math question above, write me
at igliu@stanford.edu. I already have a
Stanford math degree, and I would like
you to know, you are pretty much unem
ployable. Ha.
