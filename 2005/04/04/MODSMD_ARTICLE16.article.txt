### COURTNEY WEAVER STAFF WRITER 
The thousands of colorful fliers with catchy slogans plastered around campus can only
mean one thing: The ASSU elections are soon to come. On Wednesday and Thursday,
students will he able to log into http://elections.stanford.edu to cast their votes for spe-

Avalanche of Diversity
Background: Junior Rishi Chanderraj, a history major, de
votes his extracurricular time fully to running for execu-

tive office. Carrie Kemper, a junior and an American
studies major, has no extracurricular activities to list.

Main Issues: "We're thinking big, but refuse to
make empty promises to the student body," Chan
derraj and Kemper said. "During our tenure, we

will accomplish three things: One, pull our
troops out of Iraq at all costs; two, completely
eliminate the national debt once and for all;
and three, hold at least two Absolute Fun

events each quarter, including fall."
Biggest challenge they think they'll face in of
fice: "Power corrupts, and absolute power
corrupts absolutely," Chanderraj and Kem
per said. "The ASSIJ executives are arguably
the most powerful people in the Bay Area.
We just hope that such power doesn't get to
our heads. We're seriously worried that we
might use executive power unethically — for
our own personal profit and not for the benefit

of the school."
Plans after Stanford: "Our plans depend on one
thing: winning this race. In fact, one of the main

reasons we're running for ASSU executive is to en
sure that we have very successful and lucrative ca
reers after Stanford. We all know that a Stanford

ASSU president or
vice president
doesn't not get into

Harvard Law School or, by
the same token, not get a job at

Goldman Sachs. God forbid, if we
don't win, we'll probably do Teach for

America."
Why they decided to run together: "Why
wouldn't we run together? We are in love
with each other. It is as simple as that."
Endorsed by: "We are not endorsed by
any student groups. Like we said earlier,
we're thinking big, and what's bigger than
being endorsed by big business?" the pair
said. "In the fall, we were offered sponsor
ship by hundreds of corporations. Trying
to decide among them all was one big
headache. A headache that was relieved
only by the most advanced formula for
pain on the market: Advil©." ■

Kannokadci/ Okonkwo
Background: Mechanical engineering major Melanie Kan
nokada is junior class president and involved with Kappa
Alpha Theta, Cardinal Competitive Cheer. Stanford Taek
wondo and ihe Hindi Film Dance Team. Vice Presidential
candidate Aneto Okonkwo is majoring in management sci
ence and engineering and minoring in computer science.
Okonkwo writes innovation columns for The Stanford
Daily, is a member of the junior class presidents' cabinet and
works at the Black Student Union.
Main Issues: "We will focus on diversity and coalition build
ing. |including} student voice in housing and dining, im
proving academic advising and programming, increasing
support of the arts and athletics, and connecting the under
grad and grad communities," Kannokada and Okonkwo
said.
Biggest challenge they think they'll face in office: "General
apathy of the student body to have faith in the ASSU."

school year."
Plans after Stanford: Carr

plans to obtain a master's degree in

education and later pursue a career in educational policy as a
policy advisor. Castillo plans to attend law school and then pur
sue a career in correctional and punishment policymaking.
Why they decided to run together: Although Carr and Castillo
agree that they come from "very different backgrounds" in
terms of extracurricular involvement, they feel that their differ
ent approaches "would allow [their] executive office to create
unique and creative approaches to problems faced by all stu
dents."

of the Asian American Students Association (AASA), the
Black Student Union (BSU). Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano

cial-fees, class presidents and — ihe most closely watched race of all — the ASSU exec
utive office. In order to give students an opportunity to get to know the executive office

Plans after Stanford: Kannokada hopes to found a "social
venture focusing on sustainability or biomedical devices for
developing nations" and Okonkwo plans to "lead high tech
nology entrepreneurship in increasing access to technology in
disadvantaged and developing communities and regions."
Why they decided to run together: Kannokada and
Okonkwo worked together this year on events for the Class
of 2006 and did a technology entrepreneurship class project
together last year. "We really enjoy working together and
are able to come up with creative solutions and execute
them quite efficiently," they said. "Also, together we bring
a wide diversity of leadership and experience with on-cam
pus groups and communities and feel that our vast repre
sentation of various student groups and organizations
would be very beneficial to the ASSU in making it more ac
cessible to students."
Endorsed by: Student Organizing Committee on the Arts
(SOCA), Club Sports, Interfratemity Council (IFC) and In
tersorority council (ISC).B

Carr/Castillo

munity Services Center program coordinator and

a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.
Junior Fernando Castillo is a mechanical engi-

neering major who is a part of JUST Prison
Reform, the Latino Recruitment Organiza
tion and El Centro Support Staff.
Main Issues: Carr and Castillo hope to ad-

dress the "lack of communication [and]
collaboration [among] Stanford students"
as well as the need fora "campus-wide 24-
hour space for studying, meeting and

working out." They also hope to
strengthen the connection between the
student body and the ASSU.

J
Biggest challenge they think they'll face
in office:
"The biggest challenge we would face as

ASSU Executives is time." Carr and
Castillo said. "We want to make a lot of
changes to the ASSU and meet as many stu
dents as possible, but we only have a year to

do it. That's why we both plan to spend the en
tire sum-
