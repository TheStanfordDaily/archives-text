## Editorial New SAT test should not affect Stanford admissions 
### 
Analogies: new SAT::
(A) Gold: miser; (B) Thirst: reservoir; (C) Di
nosaurs: earth; (D) None of the above.
The answer is C. Analogies, like dinosaurs, are
extinct. The analogical reasoning section has been
replaced with the essay-writing portion in the new
SAT. What does that mean for prospective Stanford
students? Not much, according to the admissions of
fice, which mailed out acceptance letters to the Class
of 2009 last week.
The Class of 2010 will be the first to submit scores
from the new SAT, which had its first silting in March.
With recent attention focused on the new SAT, it
seems like a good time to revisit the issue of standard
ized testing in the college admissions process.
The new SA T's 25-minute written essay section
replaces the SAT II Writing subject test, giving stu
dents the opportunity to take three subject tests in
stead of two. plus writing. (Under the old SAT sys
tem, most schools required or strongly encouraged
that applicants take the SAT 11 Writing subject test.)
Stanford strongly encourages — but does not re
quire — students take the SAT II Math 2C and two
additional subject tests.
Prospective students may submit scores from ei
ther the SAT or ACT, though if an applicant submits
both, the SAT scores are given preference. A new
ACT with a similar writing component as the new
SA T is also in the works for next year's applicants.
More tests lead to higher costs: The new SAT
costs $41.50; the SAT II is $41. Add a detailed score

report to those ($9 per sitting), and it's $100 to take
both. Considering that most high school students
take each exam at least twice, the fees are consider
able, even without exam counseling.
Unlike some schools that read the written portion
of the SAT test and use it to assess an applicant's writ
ing skills, Stanford looks at the score but does not for
mally use the essay submitted with the exam in the
admissions process. We applaud this decision. While
the written portion makes it more difficult for college
counselors to "teach to the test," we believe the per
sonal statement — comprised of three short essays
and one longer essay — is a truer reflection of most
applicants' intellect and skill than a proctored exam.
The growth of the college counseling industry —
with SAT classes that cost $1,000 or more and college
coaches that charge similarly high fees to advise stu
dents on everything from class schedules to extracur
ricular activities — has had a pernicious effect on the
admissions process. Top-tier schools like Stanford
have increasingly received applications from candi
dates, often from higher socio-economic backgrounds,
engineered to fit the profile of a perfect student.
Stanford's admissions office should continue to
take a holistic approach to the application process,
looking at much more than test scores — letters of
recommendation, essays and personal background,
for example — to get a better sense of the person be
hind the numbers. Test scores, regardless of the new
and slightly improved SAT, do little toward assess
ing how much intellectual vitality a student has.
