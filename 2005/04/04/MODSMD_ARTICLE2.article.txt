### SASHA FILIPPOVA 
English Prof. Seth Lerer recently braved
the snowy mountains of Pennsylvania to ac
cept the American Comparative Literature
Association's Harry Levin prize, one of the
most prestigious awards in comparative liter
ature.
The prize is awarded biannually to au
thors who address the history of literature
rather than literary theory, as Lerer did in his
book, "Error and the Academic Self: The
Scholarly Imagination, Medieval to Mod
ern."
Haun Saussy, a member of the associa
tion's advisory board praised Lerer's work
and the broad appeal of his writing style.
"Writing a book fora fellow specialist is
relatively easy, but putting specialized
knowledge in a way that anyone can under
stand is really impressive," Saussy said in an
interview with The Daily.
In his book. Lerer claims that "history is
not the pursuit of truth but is instead a histo
ry of constantly being mired in the wrong."
In this spirit, Lerer examines traditions
like errata sheets, or insertions of typograph
ical corrections into printed works. Lerer
points out that these records of error appear

almost simultaneously with printing; and,
more importantly, they focus more on errors
of substance rather than the spelling errors
they were initially intended to correct.
This trend creates a previously unexam
ined role for the scholar as a self-critic and

emphasizes the importance of criti
cism of previous work in gaining fur
ther knowledge. The book charac
terizes scholarship as a discipline
that thrives because of errors rather
than in spite of them.
Saussy applauded this acknowl
edgement of imperfection in the aca
demic process and agreed that er
rors invigorate the pursuit of knowl
edge. He also highlighted the fact
that contemporary scholars are
often terrified of mistakes and

would benefit from the message of
Lerer's hook.
"We're all fallible," Saussy said.
"Sometimes our mistakes create
new schools of thought."
The award recognizes Lerer's in
sight into the misadventures of
scholarship and places him among
the literary world's elite. Saussy also
complimented the appeal and
humor of the work, adding that the
hook is a good representation of
Lerer's lectures, which resemble a
stand-up comedy act.
Lerer himself modestly accepted
the compliments, remarking rather
on the epic nature of his trip to re
ceive the award in the blizzards of
the east coast.
