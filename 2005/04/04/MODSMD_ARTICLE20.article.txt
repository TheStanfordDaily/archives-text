## Living on the breadline 
### 
I had guests last week. Prospective
students were here to visit the
Physics department and see if they
liked the look of it. Needless to say I
did my best to persuade them to
come here — after all it seems terri
bly unfair to keep all the pleasure of
grad school to myself.
Other than doing my duty as a
faithful physics booster my main mo
tivation for generously offering
square inches of my apartment to

scruffy strangers (no disparagement intended, all
strangers are scruffy to a practiced eye) was hard cash.
The department generously (I use the word extreme
ly loosely) forks out $30 per guest, per night. With the
money I've made Ill he able to sustain my unhealthy ad
diction to glossy gourmet magazines fora little longer.
Just thinking about those pictures gets me all excited —
the lavish layouts with everything splayed before the
reader, the gleaming, dripping succulence, the ...
Anyway, as 1 reflected on the timely supplement to
the supposedly meager salary of a grad I found myself
wondering just how meager "meager" is.
Almost everyone 1 know out here in the New(ish)
World complains about how little they get paid for car
rying out a job that mostly benefits themselves and al
lows one to perpetually claim the moral high ground in
all career choice discussions.
Actually, it goes further. People (including myself)
have been known to claim abject poverty. This, of
course, is fairly ridiculous. Poverty is when you have to
decide which child gets three meals today. It's not when
you are forced to choose between a new il'od and a new
pair of shoes.
Now, 1 would hesitate to claim that every grad student
is swimming in iPods and Manolos, but the outward signs

of standard of living are somewhat more U than non-U
(look it up).
Given that, the desperate whining can be a little jar
ring. And there's so much of it.
Obviously 1 am annoyed by the pretense of poverty.
But not enormously so, given I fall victim to it as well.
However, there are some aspects of the thing that are a
bit much.
I 'ma regular reader of the su.market newsgroup, in a
bid to find the path to eternal bliss going cheap. One
thing 1 get from this experience is sense of the extraordi
nary lengths people will go to in order to make a little
extra money.
For example, a few weeks ago I saw the following ad
(albeit posted by an undergrad):
"I recently purchased two 1.0 L bottles of Listerine, Nat
ural Citrus flavor. I don't like natural citrus flavor (1 pre
fer the minty-fresh feeling), so i'm selling the other bot
tle ... Price: $2.50 (50% off!)"
While I understand that occasionally one might need
an emergency jolt of cash, what kind of crazed lunatic de
cides that selling spare bottles of mouthwash — for
$2.50! — qualifies as normal behavior? Whose time is
worth so little that a couple of bucks buys the effort to
market dental products?
Of course, coveting inflow is complemented by con
trolling outflow. On entering grad school, previously
generous souls will suddenly become enamored by
breaking down restaurant bills to the nearest cent and
noticeably reticent about pitching in for the next round
of drinks.
Now, given that I've been guilty of most of the above
on occasion, I can't be too harsh. However, few of us are
here for the money
Strapped for cash, email tiavins@slanford.edu if you have
any gourmet magazines to sell.
