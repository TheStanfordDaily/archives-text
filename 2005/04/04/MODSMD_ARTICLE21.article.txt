Daily editorial too lax in assessing GSB
admissions debacle
In last Friday's editorial, "Business School should use
admissions debacle as learning" (April 1). I do not be
lieve the Daily's editorial board correctly captured the
situation regarding the applicants who cracked the
GSB's Web site in order to learn their admission status.
The Board wrote, "It is hard to articulate why the actions
were morally unacceptable." Perhaps 1 can help.
First, let us name the crime. I suggest "trespassing" is
the least criminal choice, while "breaking and entering"
is the most. As an analogy, imagine sneaking into your
neighbor's house to watch his television while he is gone.
His door doesn't lock well, so you let yourself in. You
don't make a mess or eat his food, but you fail to respect
the property and privacy of your neighbor. You take
what is not yours. How you learned his locks were poor

and "crackable" is irrelevant.
Second, let us consider the seriousness of the crime. Is
it a felony or a misdemeanor? If the punishment fits the
crime, then Harvard's reaction suggests it views the crime
as felony breaking-and-entering. The Daily apparently
sees it as misdemeanor trespassing.
Harvard Business School is widely regarded as the
foremost business school in the world, whether we like it
or not. Harvard had no choice but to do what it did. Had
it not. it would have communicated that 119 trespassers
were better than any of the next 2(H) qualified candidates
for whom there was initially no room. Now a different
119 will receive a Harvard education.
If we hope to live in a meritocracy, we must prefer and
reward meritorious behavior. I see no merit in the cracking
of a website.
