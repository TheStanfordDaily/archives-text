# A 						break from the bubble
## My experience of death with dignity 
### 
1 recently saw the movie "Mar
Adentro" ("The Sea Inside"), the
Spanish-language best-foreign film
winner from this year's Academy
Awards. The movie follows the true
story of Ramon Sampedro, a
quadriplegic who fought a 30-year
campaign for the legal right to die in
Spain.

Viewing this
movie, coupled
with recent news,
has me thinking
about death,
something most
undergraduates
think about even
less than how
they're going to
spend their first

social security
checks. Theological arguments
aside, 1 can see no reason why en
lightened, modern societies deem it
proper to deny individuals the
human right to die il and when they
choose.
Although I stand firmly behind
intellectual beliefs, I also have per
sonal reasons for my conviction.
Several years ago, my father grew
ill and was hospitalized. Instead of
recovering, his condition slowly
grew worse until he was placed on a
respirator and feeding tube. My fam
ily â€” my mother, my sister and 1
were left with the decision of what to
do. Although his condition was rela
tively stable, the doctors informed us
that he had no chance til recovery.
The three of us were left to make
the painful decision of if and when to
remove the respirator. We spent sev
eral days coming to grips with the
knowledge that my father would not
be coming back. It is surreal, to say
the least, to have a loved one sitting
before you, knowing he's already
gone.
At last, knowing he would not
have wanted to remain in a vegeta
tive state, we made the decision to
have the respirator removed. At 3
p.m. on Wednesday, Auijusl 21,

2002, the respirators were turned
off. We held his hands, said our last
goodbyes, and at 3:06 p.m. the nurse
informed us that my father was gone.
Although that was easily the most
difficult decision I've made in my
life, I have never felt more confident
that 1 made the right one. We were
lucky that we knew my father's wish
es and had the legal ability to termi
nate his life; many terminally ill or
chronically debilitated patients are
not so lucky.
Having had a first-hand experience
with issues related to termination of
life, I find it incredibly difficult to un
derstand how someone can conjure
up the moral authority to justify con
tinuing another human being's suf
fering against his or her will.
At one point during "Mar Aden
tro," Ramon argues with a
quadriplegic priest who contends
that life is an obligation and that he
should discover what makes life
worth living. The priest argues,
"Freedom from life is not freedom."
Ramon responds, "A life without
freedom is not a life."
Regardless of one's individual
views of the morality of death with
dignity, 1 can come to no conclusion
but this: It is utterly inhumane to let
another suffer against his or her will.
In my situation, it was fortunate
that my dad had made clear to us his
wishes and even more so that we
were all in agreement to carry them
out, as he did not have an advanced
directive.
Although no college student
wants to have this conversation, I
urge you to talk to your parents and
loved ones about what they would
want done in such situations. Ad
vanced directives are easy to com
plete, and as shown in the Terri Schi
avo fiasco, help to soften an incredi
bly difficult situation no one hopes
they have to endure.
