# No plans to fill Lake Lagunita
## 
### BEA SANFORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Although Lake Lagunita is
more full than it has been in past
years due to heavy rains, officials in
the Stanford Water Department, or
SWD, say there are no concrete
plans to fill it artificially when it be
gins to dry up during the spring.
"As far as any grand scheme of
whether to fill it or not, we don't
really have one," said Richard
Souza of the SWD.
While Souza said that if the
water level remains high enough
the University may choose to fill
the lake a little bit more and main
tain it, he explained that there is no
set procedure for deciding when to
do this. If officials choose to artifi
cially raise the water level, they do
so by diverting water from a creek
into the basin.
"Lake Lagunita has two pur
poses," Souza said. "It's recre
ational when water is there, and it
provides a habitat for the tiger
salamanders."
He added that "full" is a relative
term and that Stanford could either
divert a little bit of water into the
lake to maintain the ponds that sup
port the tiger salamanders, or they

could add a lot of water, which
would make it possible for students
to use the lake for water sports.
Sophomore Kate Shreve said
she thinks the University should fill
the lake since they have made this
decision several times in the past.
"They should [fill the lake]
again instead of shipping people
off-campus for sports," Shreve
said, referring some of the water
sport teams that are forced to prac
tice off-campus.
She added that a fuller Lake
Lagunita would be more pleasant
for aesthetic reasons.
"When it rains and just gets
half-full, it gets stagnant," she said.
"If it were filled I'd probably be
more apt to go run over there be
cause it's so beautiful."
Sophomore Tina Drmanac said
that calling Lake Lagunita a
"lake" is misleading.
"All the poor freshmen look on
the map and see a lake but there's
really nothing there," Drmanac
said. "Stanford spends so much
money on grooming, they could
easily fill it."
Shreve also said she thought the
name "lake" wasn't appropriate.
"It's kind of weird to call a big,
dry ditch a lake."
