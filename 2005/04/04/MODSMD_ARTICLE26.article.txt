# An Art Affair takes over White Plaza

On a stroll through White Plaza on Friday, it
looked as though a circus were passing through
town.
"Is that the greatest thing you've ever seen in
your life?" said junior Emily Zander, as she
watched the Cardinal Whirlwinds hop and twirl
about the main stage.
Emily was one of the core members of the or
ganizing committee for the sixth annual An Art
Affair, organized by Stanford's Student Organiz
ing Committee for the Arts. The Cardinal Whirl
winds are among the few college-aged traditional
square-dance groups in the country. Throughout
the day, more than 300 works of visual art were
displayed and 80 performances took place.
"Even if you don't loife square-dancing, you
have to stop to Watch," Zander said.
An attendee could also, receive one of 3,000
free copies of Snapshots,' the 2005 Stanford
Soundtrack. SOCA also compiled an anthology
of creative writing and handed out complimenta
ry copies. A gourmet dinner of several courses
was prepared by the Stanford Cooking Club and

served to the masses.
An Art Affair is not a competitive or exclusive
event. Anyone who submitted work for display or
who wished to perform was welcomed to do so.
Megan Miller, a junior who is on the organizing
committee, said, "What you see here is the honest
truth about the art scene at Stanford." She added
that most of the work on display did not come
from people within the art departments at Stan
ford. "Everyone here has a hidden talent."
However, not all passersby were impressed.
Freshman Max Citron, who described Stanford as
"the place where art goes to die," said that he
found a general lack of substance in most of the vi
sual art on display and thought that much of the
work was "kind of trite."
Senior James Lin, the director of SOCA, said
he hoped that the event would inspire the creative
people in the audience to continue cultivating
their talents throughout their Stanford careers.
"Stuff like this makes me want to go home,
whip out my violin and write a few songs," he said.
In 1999, Seth Cohen, class of 2005, founded
SOCA as a way to celebrate all of the great art by
students and staff at Stanford. According to Scott
Cannon, who helped coordinate the technical de

tails of the first An Art Affair in 2000, Cohen cre
ated SOCA because he realized that a lot of stu
dents had artistic talent but that Stanford provid
ed too few opportunities for creative expression.
Cannon, currently an electrical engineering
graduate student at Stanford said, "It is a huge
event to coordinate and Seth did an incredible job
of pulling together a great team to make it hap
pen. He worked tirelessly and was a true vision
ary."
Cannon said he was pleased to see Friday's
event so well put together.
"I thought An Art Affair 2005 was fabulous
and James Lin and the [SOCA] team did an awe
some job of coordinating everything. The diversi
ty of art and performance was spectacular."
Cannon said part of what has made An Art Af
fair such a successful showcase event for perfor
mance and visual art is that SOCA puts a lot of ef
fort into maintaining its institutional memory.
Each year the team refines small details to try to
improve the event, making sure to keep what
works and fix what needs help.
Finding committed passionate people who can
build on what's been done previously is a chal
lenge face by any student group," Cannon said.
