# Borgs speaks on split of Christianity
## 
### DAISY CHUNG 
Marcus Borg explored the changing nature of
Christianity in the United States in front of a near
capacity audience at a lecture yesterday. Borg —
a professor at Oregon State University, a well
known religious scholar and prolific author — has
controversially argued that there is a fundamental
split within the American Christian community.
His talk, "A Tale of Two Christianities," took
its major points from his latest book, "The Heart
of Christianity,"
"My purpose is to help us understand what is
going on and equip us to speak about it, Borg said
to begin the lecture.
During his hour-long talk, which followed his
sermon delivered earlier that day, Borg addressed
issues ranging from homosexuality to the divide
between conservative Christians and what he calls
the "neo-traditional" Christian population.
The majority of people who attended the lec
ture were members of the surrounding communi

ty, rather than students or faculty.
Borg cited numerous sources during the talk,
including the book of Leviticus and the Sufi poet
Rumi and emphasized religious acceptance
throughout.
"All other enduring religions of the world are
responses to the experience of the sacred," he
said. "They are all valid and legitimate."
Religious Studies Prof. Thomas Sheehan said
he was impressed by Borg's skillful rhetoric.
"He was extraordinary in his inclusiveness and
was ready to reach out to those who were not in
ready agreement with him," he said.
However, Borg said, "We will not be able to
build a bridge to reach about 20 to 25 percent of
the conservative Christian community," stressing
that Christians are deeply divided in many ways.
The lecture focused largely on a dichotomy be
tween the two major forms of Christianity.
"Belief-centered Christianity is probably the
most common and publicly-visible form of Chris
tianity," Borg said. "It emphasizes that the Chris

tian life is about believing the gospels and the
Bible."
In contrast, Borg said that transformation-cen
tered Christianity "involves an appreciative inte
gration of the teachings of the Enlightenment.
The Christian life is about how a relationship with
God changes us and transforms us."
He asserted that "more than anything else, the
belief paradigm has been responsible for the de
cline in mainline denominations in the last 40
years."'
Borg emphasized that this decline did not
mean an abandonment of religion, but rather an
effort to seek a new form of spirituality.
Regarding homosexuality, Borg said, "you
can't understand the debate in the church about
homosexuality unless you know the two para
digms."
He said he found it "ironic and disheartening"
that most belief-centered Christians were taking
the biblical verses out of context or
too literally to justify discrimination.
He added that the emerging form
of Christianity "sees the Bible as an
ancient human product" that allows
Christians to take a historical and
metaphorical approach to the scrip
ture.
In his final point of the lecture,
Borg asserted that "the transforma
tion-centered paradigm allows peo
ple to resolve the intellectual stum
bling blocks of belief-centered
Christianity."
Borg said he was optimistic about
the emerging Christianity that fo
cuses less on literal interpretation
and more on the values that arise
from the Christian tradition.
Several of the students who at
tended the talk said shared Borg's
hopeful outlook, but that they are
aware the different attitudes still
exist.
"I'm from Texas and I'm going to
miss having a fellow audience that is
willing to consider a liberal Christ
ian viewpoint when I leave Stan
ford," said senior Katherine Vu.
