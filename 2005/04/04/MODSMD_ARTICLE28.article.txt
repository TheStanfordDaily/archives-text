## Fade into Bolivian Evil Empire rules in Ireland 
### 
The craic was mighty. The cigarette smoke
was omnipresent. And the Guinness was
flowing like an avalanche coming down
the mountain. Traditional logic would dictate
that this column he about something relevant to
today's sports world (of course traditional logic
also dictates that you go somewhere warm for
spring break, but in the interest of writing this
column, I spent my spring break in Ireland "re
searching"). Thus, while I almost wrote about
the opening of the baseball season, the NCAA
Tournament or my newfound vocation as an an
nouncer for the Stanford women's lacrosse team
(Hey Dad: I found a job! Granted it doesn't pay,
and the job ends in two weeks, but the hours are
great!). I decided to continue the grand tradition
of this column, and not risk writing about a rele
vant sports topic. Following on the heels of a

two-week holiday (as the Eu
ropeans like to call a vacation)
in Ireland with my brother
Eric, Gametime Sniitson and
Chemical Engineering All-
Star Russ Martin, this article
discusses the state of sports in
the Republic of Ireland.
One would think that with
Allen Iverson and 50 Cent
Reebok billboards plastered

over central Dublin, coupled with the impact of
American pop culture, Dubliners would be seen
pimping American basketball apparel. Howev
er. with roughly two basketball courts in all of
Dublin (both vacant during the duration of my
stay) I'm guessing that the company formerly
known as Reebok (now with the street savvy
name of RBK) might be better off with Kelly
Holmes billboards, instead of advertising a sport
that nobody plays.
While it's certainly true that Irish youth love
watching MTV (especially "Pimp My Ride," a
show that is apparently broadcast in Slovakia), I
believe that the glaring omission of BET from
any Irish programming lineup has led to two cul
tural confusions: I) the wearing ol jerseys by old

blokes and 2) the overabundance of
Yankees baseball caps.
Foremost, without BET's "Rap
City: The Basement," the Irish (and
apparently the entirety of the 2005
San Francisco Giants) missed Jay-Z's
announcement, "I don't wear jerseys,
I'm 30 plus." In stark contrast to peo
ple in the States, people of all ages are
found proudly wearing their local
city's Gaelic football jersey.
According to my calculations
based on my highly scientific observa
tional powers, the four most popular
American sports teams in Ireland are
the Yankees (everybody in Dublin is
apparently a Yankees fan). Red Sox,
Boston Celtics and Notre Dame.
Originally, I assumed that the pre
ponderance of Yankees hats was
somewhat akin to youth soccer play
ers in the States proudly wearing
ManU jerseys, while knowing abso
lutely nothing about the club. Howev
er, while Americans actually play soc
cer in the states, nowhere was a base
ball diamond to be found in Ireland.
Apparently the draw of the Evil Em
pire is so strong that in a country
where nobody plays baseball, the
Yankees still command a dominant
position in the sports apparel market.
Instead, the ample greenery is ei
ther overrun by sheep and cows, or in
use as a Gaelic football / hurling
pitch. Hurling, while sounding eerily
reminiscent of everybody's least fa
vorite Winter Olympic sport, is actu
ally a hybrid sport combining field
hockey, baseball, soccer and roughly
12 other sports. According to lads
eager to tell this American sportswrit
er about Irish sports, hurling is the
fastest land sport in the world and has
the fittest athletes in the world.
Did I understand the rules or even
how scoring worked? No. But on St.
Paddy's Day, I headed out to Croke
Park along with 30,000 Irish blokes to
bask in their drunken revelry. Leave
it to the Irish to fail to have a timer on
their scoreboard, as my brother and I
sat in the stands unaware of how
much time remained in the half.
Thus, while fully expecting Ireland
to be awash in throwback Troy Mur
phy jerseys (from his Notre Dame
days), I was met with a barrage of
Yankees caps as I walked amidst Joy
ceian Dublin. The only way for this
Yankees overload to be rectified
would be for the Yankees losing
streak to reach an epic half-decade,
and for the Yankees to return to their
1980s doldrums. Cheers to that.

Neil Davis misses Ireland, despite all
the Yankees hats. E-mail him at
