## Fade into Bolivian Evil Empire rules in Ireland

The craic was mighty. The cigarette smoke
was omnipresent. And the Guinness was
flowing like an avalanche coming down
the mountain. Traditional logic would dictate
that this column he about something relevant to
today's sports world (of course traditional logic
also dictates that you go somewhere warm for
spring break, but in the interest of writing this
column, I spent my spring break in Ireland "re
searching"). Thus, while I almost wrote about
the opening of the baseball season, the NCAA
Tournament or my newfound vocation as an an
nouncer for the Stanford women's lacrosse team
(Hey Dad: I found a job! Granted it doesn't pay,
and the job ends in two weeks, but the hours are
great!). I decided to continue the grand tradition
of this column, and not risk writing about a rele
vant sports topic. Following on the heels of a

two-week holiday (as the Eu
ropeans like to call a vacation)
in Ireland with my brother
Eric, Gametime Sniitson and
Chemical Engineering All-
Star Russ Martin, this article
discusses the state of sports in
the Republic of Ireland.

over central Dublin, coupled with the impact of
American pop culture, Dubliners would be seen
pimping American basketball apparel. Howev

Dublin (both vacant during the duration of my
stay) I'm guessing that the company formerly
known as Reebok (now with the street savvy
name of RBK) might be better off with Kelly
Holmes billboards, instead of advertising a sport
that nobody plays.
While it's certainly true that Irish youth love
watching MTV (especially "Pimp My Ride," a
show that is apparently broadcast in Slovakia), I
believe that the glaring omission of BET from
any Irish programming lineup has led to two cul
tural confusions: I) the wearing ol jerseys by old
