# Cardinal lacrosse able to hold off Cal
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team
gave its tans all they could have asked for
Friday night at Maloney Field, winning an
11-10 thriller over rival California. Sopho
more attacker Michelle DeChant notched
the game winner with 7:02 to play and
Stanford (6-4,4-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) relied upon its defenders and
freshman goalie Laura Shane to secure the
victory over the Golden Bears (6-5,1-1).
i didn't even realize I scored the
game-winner," DeChant said. "It wasn't
until I was walking off the field and some
body told me that I realized what 1 did."
Cal drew first blood, as Golden Bear
Laura Cavallo tallied the first of her two
goals just 55 seconds into the contest. Un
fazed by the quick score, Stanford held
California scoreless for the next 16 min
utes. while managing to notch four goals in
that span. Senior midfielder Kelsey Twist
led the Cardinal spurt with a goal and two
assists during the run. The teams traded
three scores apiece through the rest of the
first half, and the Cardinal took a 7-4 lead
into the break.
Despite the three-goal lead, DeChant
said she realized the game was far from
decided.
"We're usually winning at halftime,
and in the second half people always come
back," DeChant said. "We needed to win
the second half to win a game. The second
hall is when you win the game, the first half
is when you just play."
Sure enough, Cal started the second
half firing on all cylinders, recording four
goals in the first 11:07. The Cardinal could
only manage a single score from sopho
more midfielder Liz Piselli, and Stanford's
three-goal halftime lead evaporated into
an 8-8 tie.
Piselli's tally capped a stretch that re
flected Stanford's offensive balance, as
seven different Cardinal (Twist, freshman

midfielder Megan McC'lain. freshman at
tacker Daphne Patterson, junior attacker
Sarah Bach. DeChant, Piselli and senior
midfielder Nina Pantano) accounted for
Stanford's first eight goals.
Bach's second goal with 17:18 to play
looked to significantly bolster the Cardi
nal's cause, as both teams went scoreless
over the next six minutes, giving Stanford a
9-8 advantage with just over 11 minutes to
play. But Cal erased Stanford's lead once
again, as Molly Brady tied the contest at
the 11:14 mark. Just two minutes later,
Cavallo. who opened Cal's scoring, also
capped the Golden Bears' offensive out
put with 8:50 to play, giving the visitors a
10-9 edge, their first lead since 1-0.
Even after Cal's spirited comeback,
Stanford refused to panic.
"1 think we were just ready," DeChant
said. "We were expecting a tight game."
That sense of calm allowed the Cardi
nal to muster the determination that de
fines the Stanford-Cal rivalry and claw
right back. Pantano completed her hat
trick with 8:18 to play and after 52 minutes,
the teams were dead even.
A minute later, DeChant notched her
second goal to put Stanford ahead. 11-10.
Cal had several good looks in the last few
minutes, but Shane and the Stanford de
fense stood tall. The Cardinal reclaimed
possession with a minute to go, drained
the clock and preserved the hard-fought
victory.
"The win was huge," said DeChant,
who has scored four goals this season. "We
lost to them last year in the MPSF title
game, so it was a big deal. We were all
ready and this win was definitely necessary
in the middle of the season, because we've
had a lot of losses."
The Cardinal have no time to rest on
their laurels, as one of the toughest week
ends of the season looms on the horizon.

Friday before traveling to Notre Dame on
