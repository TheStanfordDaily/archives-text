### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
Citing the success of last year's Confer
ence on Innovation Journalism, the Stanford
Center for Innovations in Learning, or SCIL,
and The Swedish Innovation Journalism Fel
lowship Program will present the conference
a second time starting today at 8:30 a.m. in
Wallenberg Hall of Tresidder Union and
running through Wednesday.
"Innovation journalism is journalism ded-

icated to the coverage of innovation," said
David Nordfors, co-chair of the conference
and Senior Research Scholar at SCIL. "In
novation is the leading driver of economic
growth and the core activity of many leading
industries."
Innovation journalism is an aggregation
of business, technology, science and political
journalism. Nordfors said. The field covers
technical, business, legal and political aspects
of innovations and innovation systems. In
this way, journalism dedicated to covering in
novation is an essential component of mod
ern industrial economies.
"Although journalism about innovation
has existed fora long time, it had neither a
name nor a professional community until
2003," Nordfors said.
Since January 2005, innovation journal-
ism has been a key program at SCIL.
During the last year, an innovation
journalism program has been estab
lished in Finland, and a research
program on innovation communica
tion has been initiated in Germany.
This week will bring members of
the burgeoning international innova
tion journalism community together
on campus to compare experiences.
"The conference is much larger
this year," Nordfors said. "Delega
tions are coming from three coun
tries: Sweden. Finland and Ger
many. There are thirteen conference
papers and over fifty speakers and
panelists. Each day will feature a
keynote speaker."
This week's conference will delve
deeper into the core issues of inno

vation journalism, including the
trade's aims, methods, ethics and
best practices, Nordfors said.
Last year, attendance by Stan
ford students was low, and organiz
ers hope that this conference will be
different.
"This year we are expecting a
number of Stanford journalism stu
dents," Nordfors said. "We even
have volunteers from the journalism
graduate program."
He added that the graduate pro
gram in journalism is a co-sponsor of
the conference.
"Undergraduate students should
attend the conference because it's
time to recognize the importance of
journalism in innovation systems,
the systems of people and organiza
tions that participate in transform
ing an idea into a new product or ser
vice on the market," Nodrfors said.
"The importance of journalism in in
novation systems is obvious, but lit
tle looked into."
