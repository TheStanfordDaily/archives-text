Stanford's season may have
come to an end on Tuesday with
its loss to Michigan State in the
Kansas City Regional Final, but

for one Cardinal player, the ac
colades keep on coming. Satur
day, freshman Candice Wiggins
was one of 10 players in the
country named to the Kodak

Freshman Candice Wiggins was one of ten players named to the Kodak
All America Team.

Women's Basketball Coaches As
sociation.
For Wiggins, who greets suc
cess with the "aw, shucks" grin of
a kid on the playground, the on
court accomplishments seem to
include every statistical category.
She led her team in scoring with
17.4 points per game, while her 86
steals tied Stanford great Kate
Starbird for third-most in school
history. Wiggins' 612 points this
season make her the fifth-highest
single-season scorer in Cardinal
history. From the charity stripe,
her 162 successful free throws are
a new Stanford record, surpassing
Nicole Powell's old mark of 161.
When Wiggins arrived on the
Farm in the fall, she was young
enough —at age 17 —to be a
high school senior. Instead, head
coach Tara VanDerveer told her
that she would be treated as a col
lege senior, not a rookie. Eight
months later, those words seem
prophetic, as Wiggins has collect
ed post-season hardware like a
player in her sixth year on campus.
"[Her impact] was pretty much
instantaneous," senior Susan
King Borchardt said after Stan
ford's 76-59 victory over Con
necticut in the NCAA Tourna
ment. "She's a really special
freshman. She just wants to win so
badly, and she fit in great right
from the start."
Wiggins is just the ninth
woman in NCAA history to gar
ner an All-America selection as a
freshman, joining ranks with USC
legend Cheryl Miller and WNBA
star Chamique Holdsclaw.
She swept the Pacific-10 Con
ference awards ceremony earlier
this year, taking home both Pac
-10 Freshman of the Year and
Player of the Year honors, the
first time a Pac-10 player has won
both awards in the same year.
"I thought she would do really
well physically," VanDerveer
said. "The things that you never
know about are the intangible
things in terms of her maturity,
her intensity. What I didn't under
stand or know when we were re
cruiting her were the intangibles,
and that is what separates her
from other players."
