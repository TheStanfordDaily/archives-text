# Baseball sweeps Cougars in Pullman
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Junior shortstop Chris Minaker
and sophomore third baseman
Adam Sorgi have been perfecting
the craft of left-side fielding all sea
son. But this past weekend, the de
fensively sound duo morphed into a
potent top-of-the-order offensive
threat, posting a combined 10 hits
and six RBI in the No. 12 Cardinal's
(17-9, 3-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
sweep of Washington State (15-17,
0-6).
The weekend's final scores —
14-5 on Friday, 11-4 in the series
clincher and 8-6 yesterday after
noon— tell of an offensive jump
for the entire Cardinal lineup,
which has been the most inconsis
tent part of Stanford's game. With
the help of Minaker and Sorgi set
ting the tone for the offense in the
one and two spots, Stanford's bats
were loud all weekend, smashing 44
base knocks.
Junior Jed Lowrie, whose bat
ting average was boosted to .340
over the weekend, had a simple ex
planation for the explosion:
"We've been working hard, and
we're seeing the results of that
now."
This weekend was the first se
ries in which the Cardinal offense
clearly saved the pitching staff,
which allowed 32 hits in Pullman,
Wash. Even Saturday starter Jeff
Gilmore, who has been one of
Stanford's most reliable pitchers,
was roughed up for 10 hits in only
5 2/3 innings, though he managed
to keep the damage to only four
runs.
The Cougars depended heavily
on their top two starters during the
non-conference season. Five-foot-9
senior ace Jason Freeman entered
Pac-10 play with a perfect 6-0
record. But Freeman's numbers
were marred in last week's meeting
against Cal, and the damage contin
ued on Friday. Eleven of the Cardi
nal's hits came during Freeman's
four-inning outing, and Freeman
took his second loss in as many ap
pearances.
Junior lefthander Mark Ro
manczuk tossed six innings for the
Cardinal, allowing three runs on
five hits, while freshman righty
Nolan Gallagher finished the con
test off, also giving up five hits and
one earned run.
Stanford got at least two hits
from eight places in its lineup on
Friday, including a 4-for-5 perfor
mance from freshman right fielder
Michael Taylor. Only the Cardi
nal's consistently feeble designated
hitters failed to record a hit.

Junior pitcher Mark Romanczuk did his part picking up a win Friday night as ifie Cardinal swept the Cougars on their
home field in Pullman.
Saturday was a hit parade, led by
a two-homer game from Lowrie and
two-hit, two-RBI performances
from Sorgi and junior John Mayber
ry, Jr. Washington State hurler
Wayne Daman, Jr., like his counter
part Freeman, took his second loss of
the season, both at the hands of a
Pac-10 foe. Daman and Freeman
now have conference ERAs of 14.04
and 19.50, respectively.
Washington State came close to
the Cardinal yesterday, actually
managing a narrow 6-5 lead after the
seventh inning. The lead disap

peared in the eighth after RBI by Mi
naker and Mayberry, and one more
Cardinal run in the ninth completely
buried the chances of a demoralized
Cougar squad.
Stanford's pitching was once
again generous in hits allowed (10),
but somehow managed to limit the
damage. Sophomore Blake Holler
was the bright spot, allowing only
one base knock and no runs in the
final innings of the game to maintain
Stanford's lead and solidify his posi
tion as the Cardinal's best reliever.
The Cardinal's next contest will
be on Tuesday night, when Stanford
takes on the Santa Clara Broncos
(14-15, 1-7 West Coast Conference)
at Sunken Diamond. The Broncos
currently hold a 3-7 record away
from home.
