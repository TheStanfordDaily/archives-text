# Baseball sweeps Cougars in Pullman
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Junior shortstop Chris Minaker
and sophomore third baseman
Adam Sorgi have been perfecting
the craft of left-side fielding all sea
son. But this past weekend, the de
fensively sound duo morphed into a
potent top-of-the-order offensive
threat, posting a combined 10 hits
and six RBI in the No. 12 Cardinal's
(17-9, 3-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
sweep of Washington State (15-17,
0-6).
The weekend's final scores —
14-5 on Friday, 11-4 in the series
clincher and 8-6 yesterday after
noon— tell of an offensive jump
for the entire Cardinal lineup,
which has been the most inconsis
tent part of Stanford's game. With
the help of Minaker and Sorgi set
ting the tone for the offense in the
one and two spots, Stanford's bats
were loud all weekend, smashing 44
base knocks.
Junior Jed Lowrie, whose bat
ting average was boosted to .340
over the weekend, had a simple ex
planation for the explosion:
"We've been working hard, and
we're seeing the results of that
now."
This weekend was the first se
ries in which the Cardinal offense
clearly saved the pitching staff,
which allowed 32 hits in Pullman,
Wash. Even Saturday starter Jeff
Gilmore, who has been one of
Stanford's most reliable pitchers,
was roughed up for 10 hits in only
5 2/3 innings, though he managed
to keep the damage to only four
runs.
The Cougars depended heavily
on their top two starters during the
non-conference season. Five-foot-9
senior ace Jason Freeman entered
Pac-10 play with a perfect 6-0
record. But Freeman's numbers
were marred in last week's meeting
against Cal, and the damage contin
ued on Friday. Eleven of the Cardi
nal's hits came during Freeman's
four-inning outing, and Freeman
took his second loss in as many ap
pearances.
Junior lefthander Mark Ro
manczuk tossed six innings for the
Cardinal, allowing three runs on
five hits, while freshman righty
Nolan Gallagher finished the con
test off, also giving up five hits and
one earned run.
Stanford got at least two hits
from eight places in its lineup on
Friday, including a 4-for-5 perfor
mance from freshman right fielder
Michael Taylor. Only the Cardi
nal's consistently feeble designated
hitters failed to record a hit.
