# Cardinal go one for three in 'Zona
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
In the bottom of the second
against No. 2 Arizona on Friday,
freshmen Tricia Aggabao, Becky Mc-
Cullough and Amanda Beardman hit
successive singles for the No. 6 Stan
ford softball team (25-7, 1-2 Pacific
-10 Conference). Stanford had already
taken a 2-1 lead and the chance to
blow the game wide open was one
swing away.
But with three on and nobody out,
the Cardinal proceeded to make
three straight outs en route to a 4-2
loss to the Wildcats.
"Arizona has a really good pitch
er," said junior centerfielder Catalina
Morris of Alicia Hollowell. "We did
have opportunities a few innings, we
just didn't string together hits or
make the most of our scoring oppor
tunities."
The situation very closely de
scribes what many Pac-10 teams saw
this past weekend: Close games in
which one swing would change the
outcome. For the Cardinal, that swing
didn't come in two of their three
matchups.
Despite dropping two of three, ju
nior shortstop Lauren Lappin looked
at what the team could take from the
Arizona series.
"We were 1-2 but that doesn't
show how we are," Lappin said.
Stanford entered Friday's game as
the underdog but the team got on the
board quickly. 2-0. Morris led off with
a single to center. Lappin's bunt was
taken by Hollowell but the star pitch
er threw the ball into foul territory
and both Morris and Lappin were
able to score.
Arizona scored once in the third
and took the lead in the fifth. Shelly
Schultz knocked in one run and an
error by Lappin allowed the Wildcats
to pad their lead. 4-2. After six innings,
McCullough had been handed her first
loss of the season and the Cardinal had
seen their first league loss.
"It was the first Pac-10 game of the
season," Morris said. "We were all a
little nervous. [The game] is good to
show us what competition is going to
be like this year. We have to know
what the Pac-10s are going to look
like."
Stanford played the best that any
team has against Hollowell this sea
son. as the Wildcat was tagged with a
season-high seven hits. But after leav
ing the bases loaded in the second, the
Cardinal were unable to put more
runners on the basepaths. Hollowell

retired the side in the last three in
nings 1-2-3.
While Saturday's desert tilt with
No. 18 Arizona State turned out bet
ter for the Cardinal, the game was still
a very close one. ASU, recognized by
the Cardinal as having improved
from last year, came out ready. The
Sun Devils put up a fight trying to
pick up their first conference win.
having been slated to finish last in the
Pac-10 earlier this season. With the
sun down for the night game, it was
Stanford, however, that went to bed
with a 2-1 victory.
McCullough, starting for the sec
ond straight day, redeemed herself of
Friday's loss by scattering four hits in
seven innings and giving up only one
unearned run. She held up a potential
rally in the third by getting the Sun
Devils to line out to short fora double
play and to second base for the final
out. The rookie pitcher picked up her
eighth win in Saturday's pitchers'
duel.
Senior Meghan Sickler hit a solo
shot to center in the second against
Desiree Serrano that put the Cardinal
ahead by one. After ASU managed to
tie it in the third off the unearned run,
Stanford's bats came alive against
Serrano in the fifth.
Morris' bunt single landed her on
base, and Smith followed with her
first hit as part of a 2-for-4 night. The
Sun Devils sent in relief pitcher Katie
Burkhart but Cardinal senior catcher
Leah Nelson batted in the go-ahead
run with a flare to center that was mis
handled by the Sun Devils' defense.
Stanford's batters picked up eight
hits Saturday night and left nine on
base. The inability to push runners
across the plate continued on Sunday
afternoon. Playing in 80-degree heat
ASU picked up its first conference
win, 2-0.
ASU sent Burkhart, who leads the
program's pitching staff, out into the
circle for the start. Burkhart shut the
door on Stanford, tossing a four-hit
complete game shutout. The fresh
man ace has six shutouts this season.
"We faced another good pitcher
but we didn't manage to string our
hits together." Morris said. "We
never really had runners in scoring
position."
Lappin and Nelson, Stanford's
seasoned players, were the only Car
dinals able to make good contact
against Burkhart, ending the game
with two hits apiece. Unfortunately,
those hits weren't enough to get run
ners past second.
"A lot of people hit the ball pretty

hard," Lappin said. "(Leah and I]
were lucky enough to find holes. We
just have to be positive and we'll pro
duce runs."
The Sun Devils handed junior
righthanded hurler Laura Severson
(11-4) a loss, with Heidi Knabe going
3-3 with an RBI and Ashley Wer
schky going 2-3 with one RBI. After
Severson recorded the first out, Wer
schky singled to deep short with a

runner on in the bottom of the first.
Two frames later, Stanford had sent
in freshman Lauren Nydam but with
two outs and one on. a double by
Knabe gave ASU one more run.
With the three close games, Mor
ris admitted the weekend was a bit
stressful. But. she added, a lot of Pac
-10 games will be close and "it's some
thing we've got to get used to."
Other scores around the confer

ence this weekend were California
over ASU, 4-2, Arizona over Cal, 4-2,
and Cal over Arizona, 6-3. With Pac
-10 play having kicked off this past
weekend with some of the best teams,
the close margins provide a glimpse
of what's to come in May.
"The Pac-10 is a very competitive
conference," Lappin said. "Most like
ly we'll see a lot of one-run, two-run,
three-run games."

thing we've got to get used to."

over ASU, 4-2, Arizona over Cal, 4-2,

the close margins provide a glimpse
of what's to come in May.
"The Pac-10 is a very competitive
conference," Lappin said. "Most like

three-run games."

The Cardinal went 1-2 to open the Pac-10 season with a 4-2 loss to Arizona and a split with Arizona State, 2-1, and
0-2.
In the bottom of the second
against No. 2 Arizona on Friday,
freshmen Tricia Aggabao, Becky Mc-
Cullough and Amanda Beardman hit
successive singles for the No. 6 Stan
ford softball team (25-7, 1-2 Pacific
-10 Conference). Stanford had already
taken a 2-1 lead and the chance to
blow the game wide open was one
swing away.
But with three on and nobody out,
the Cardinal proceeded to make
three straight outs en route to a 4-2
loss to the Wildcats.
"Arizona has a really good pitch
er," said junior centerfielder Catalina
Morris of Alicia Hollowell. "We did
have opportunities a few innings, we
just didn't string together hits or
make the most of our scoring oppor
tunities."
The situation very closely de
scribes what many Pac-10 teams saw
this past weekend: Close games in
which one swing would change the
outcome. For the Cardinal, that swing
didn't come in two of their three
matchups.
Despite dropping two of three, ju
nior shortstop Lauren Lappin looked
at what the team could take from the
Arizona series.
"We were 1-2 but that doesn't
show how we are," Lappin said.
Stanford entered Friday's game as
the underdog but the team got on the
board quickly. 2-0. Morris led off with
a single to center. Lappin's bunt was
taken by Hollowell but the star pitch
er threw the ball into foul territory
and both Morris and Lappin were
able to score.
Arizona scored once in the third
and took the lead in the fifth. Shelly
Schultz knocked in one run and an
error by Lappin allowed the Wildcats
to pad their lead. 4-2. After six innings,
McCullough had been handed her first
loss of the season and the Cardinal had
seen their first league loss.
"It was the first Pac-10 game of the
season," Morris said. "We were all a
little nervous. [The game] is good to
show us what competition is going to
be like this year. We have to know
what the Pac-10s are going to look
like."
Stanford played the best that any
team has against Hollowell this sea
son. as the Wildcat was tagged with a
season-high seven hits. But after leav
ing the bases loaded in the second, the
Cardinal were unable to put more
runners on the basepaths. Hollowell

retired the side in the last three in
nings 1-2-3.
While Saturday's desert tilt with
No. 18 Arizona State turned out bet
ter for the Cardinal, the game was still
a very close one. ASU, recognized by
the Cardinal as having improved
from last year, came out ready. The
Sun Devils put up a fight trying to
pick up their first conference win.
having been slated to finish last in the
Pac-10 earlier this season. With the
sun down for the night game, it was
Stanford, however, that went to bed
with a 2-1 victory.
McCullough, starting for the sec
ond straight day, redeemed herself of
Friday's loss by scattering four hits in
seven innings and giving up only one
unearned run. She held up a potential
rally in the third by getting the Sun
Devils to line out to short fora double
play and to second base for the final
out. The rookie pitcher picked up her
eighth win in Saturday's pitchers'
duel.
Senior Meghan Sickler hit a solo
shot to center in the second against
Desiree Serrano that put the Cardinal
ahead by one. After ASU managed to
tie it in the third off the unearned run,
Stanford's bats came alive against
Serrano in the fifth.
Morris' bunt single landed her on
base, and Smith followed with her
first hit as part of a 2-for-4 night. The
Sun Devils sent in relief pitcher Katie
Burkhart but Cardinal senior catcher
Leah Nelson batted in the go-ahead
run with a flare to center that was mis
handled by the Sun Devils' defense.
Stanford's batters picked up eight
hits Saturday night and left nine on
base. The inability to push runners
across the plate continued on Sunday
afternoon. Playing in 80-degree heat
ASU picked up its first conference
win, 2-0.
ASU sent Burkhart, who leads the
program's pitching staff, out into the
circle for the start. Burkhart shut the
door on Stanford, tossing a four-hit
complete game shutout. The fresh
man ace has six shutouts this season.
"We faced another good pitcher
but we didn't manage to string our
hits together." Morris said. "We
never really had runners in scoring
position."
Lappin and Nelson, Stanford's
seasoned players, were the only Car
dinals able to make good contact
against Burkhart, ending the game
with two hits apiece. Unfortunately,
those hits weren't enough to get run
ners past second.
"A lot of people hit the ball pretty

hard," Lappin said. "(Leah and I]
were lucky enough to find holes. We
just have to be positive and we'll pro
duce runs."
The Sun Devils handed junior
righthanded hurler Laura Severson
(11-4) a loss, with Heidi Knabe going
3-3 with an RBI and Ashley Wer
schky going 2-3 with one RBI. After
Severson recorded the first out, Wer
schky singled to deep short with a

runner on in the bottom of the first.
Two frames later, Stanford had sent
in freshman Lauren Nydam but with
two outs and one on. a double by
Knabe gave ASU one more run.
