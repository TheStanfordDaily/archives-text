# No. 2UCLA too much to handle
## Card split two in Maples opener 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITE 
The men's volleyball team split
their weekend with a win and a loss,
but the numbers don't tell the whole
story.
On Friday, a shutout win against
No. 12 UC-Irvine (6-18,4-13 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
wasn't the Cakewalk the score indi
cates for the No. 10 Cardinal (10-12,
9-10).
Senior Craig Buell, who prac
ticed just one day last week and was
on injured reserve with knee prob
lems until just before the game, re
turned to the lineup and was one of
the driving forces behind Stanford's
win.
Buell led the team with 14 kills
out of 19 attempts fora .737 hitting
percentage, as Stanford played its
first match in Maples Pavilion this
season.
Head coach Don Shaw men
tioned that there are both pros and
cons to playing in Maples.
"It's a huge venue compared to
Burnham." Shaw said. "Burnham is
such a cozy little place and a little
more intimate; the fans are right
there on top of you. Fortunately we
had a big crowd tonight, but it's a lit
tle more spacious. This size of a
crowd would have been real loud at
Burnham."
Stanford won the first two games
of the match, 30-21 and 30-24, on
Irvine service errors.
The Anteaters' frustration was
evident on the court by the middle
of the second game. After using
their second timeout at 14-9, Irvine
players yelled at each other to "pick
it up" and irritably punched the air
as they gave up more and more
points.
"I think Irvine actually picked it
up," Buell said. "I'll give them cred
it for that. They're on a rough streak
right now; they've lost a lot in a row,
but they played pretty hard."
The third game was the most
tightly fought, but Stanford turned a
17-17 tie into a 30-24 win.
"We got a little sloppy, but I
thought we steadied out," Shaw said.

"It was tighter in game three, hut we
just play consistently and hope the
other team falters a little bit or we'll
make an extra play or two."
Shaw said he was impressed with
his team's effort overall, especially
considering that it was a huge im
provement over their performance
against Irvine earlier this season.
"Irvine made just enough mis
takes and we made enough plays to
get a decent lead earlier in the games
than the last time we played them,"
Shaw said. "When we played them
(in Irvine], it was very tight down to
the 20s, and then we managed to pull
ahead toward the end. In this case,
once we got into the 20s we already
had the lead, even though we g<*t be
hind early."
While the Cardinal fell 3-1 to No.
2 UCLA (22-3, 15-3) the following
evening, the match was much closer
than the score indicates.
In the first game, the Cardinal
gained an early lead that fell to a 17-
17 tie after two scrambles into the
bench by Stanford players. After
Stanford took a 21-19 lead, the Bru
ins called a timeout to stop the Car
dinal momentum, but to no avail, as
Stanford went on to post a 30-25 vic
tory.
The Cardinal broke a series of
early ties in the second game to
prompt an early UCLA timeout at
11-8. This time, momentum did
shift, and Stanford was forced to
call a timeout as the Bruins pulled
ahead 19-15. The Cardinal forced a
tie at 23-23 and the teams battled
back and forth for the remainder of
the contest. After the Cardinal
failed to capitalize on two game
points, the Bruins took game two
35-33.
After the Bruins took a 17-12
lead in game three. Shaw inserted ju
nior Nick Manov into the lineup.
Manov, who has seen relatively little
playing time this season, made two
kills in two attempts.
A Stanford communication error
resulted in a dropped ball and a 26-
17 lead for UCLA, which went on to
win 30-21.
