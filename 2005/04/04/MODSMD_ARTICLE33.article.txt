# No. 2UCLA too much to handle
## Card split two in Maples opener 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITE 
The men's volleyball team split
their weekend with a win and a loss,
but the numbers don't tell the whole
story.
On Friday, a shutout win against
No. 12 UC-Irvine (6-18,4-13 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation)
wasn't the Cakewalk the score indi
cates for the No. 10 Cardinal (10-12,
9-10).
Senior Craig Buell, who prac
ticed just one day last week and was
on injured reserve with knee prob
lems until just before the game, re
turned to the lineup and was one of
the driving forces behind Stanford's
win.
Buell led the team with 14 kills
out of 19 attempts fora .737 hitting
percentage, as Stanford played its
first match in Maples Pavilion this
season.
Head coach Don Shaw men
tioned that there are both pros and
cons to playing in Maples.
"It's a huge venue compared to
Burnham." Shaw said. "Burnham is
such a cozy little place and a little
more intimate; the fans are right
there on top of you. Fortunately we
had a big crowd tonight, but it's a lit
tle more spacious. This size of a
crowd would have been real loud at
Burnham."
Stanford won the first two games
of the match, 30-21 and 30-24, on
Irvine service errors.
The Anteaters' frustration was
evident on the court by the middle
of the second game. After using
their second timeout at 14-9, Irvine
players yelled at each other to "pick
it up" and irritably punched the air
as they gave up more and more
points.
"I think Irvine actually picked it
up," Buell said. "I'll give them cred
it for that. They're on a rough streak
right now; they've lost a lot in a row,
but they played pretty hard."
The third game was the most
tightly fought, but Stanford turned a
17-17 tie into a 30-24 win.
"We got a little sloppy, but I
thought we steadied out," Shaw said.

"It was tighter in game three, hut we
just play consistently and hope the
other team falters a little bit or we'll
make an extra play or two."
Shaw said he was impressed with
his team's effort overall, especially
considering that it was a huge im
provement over their performance
against Irvine earlier this season.
"Irvine made just enough mis
takes and we made enough plays to
get a decent lead earlier in the games
than the last time we played them,"
Shaw said. "When we played them
(in Irvine], it was very tight down to
the 20s, and then we managed to pull
ahead toward the end. In this case,
once we got into the 20s we already
had the lead, even though we g<*t be
hind early."
While the Cardinal fell 3-1 to No.
2 UCLA (22-3, 15-3) the following
evening, the match was much closer
than the score indicates.
In the first game, the Cardinal
gained an early lead that fell to a 17-
17 tie after two scrambles into the
bench by Stanford players. After
Stanford took a 21-19 lead, the Bru
ins called a timeout to stop the Car
dinal momentum, but to no avail, as
Stanford went on to post a 30-25 vic
tory.
The Cardinal broke a series of
early ties in the second game to
prompt an early UCLA timeout at
11-8. This time, momentum did
shift, and Stanford was forced to
call a timeout as the Bruins pulled
ahead 19-15. The Cardinal forced a
tie at 23-23 and the teams battled
back and forth for the remainder of
the contest. After the Cardinal
failed to capitalize on two game
points, the Bruins took game two
35-33.
After the Bruins took a 17-12
lead in game three. Shaw inserted ju
nior Nick Manov into the lineup.
Manov, who has seen relatively little
playing time this season, made two
kills in two attempts.
A Stanford communication error
resulted in a dropped ball and a 26-
17 lead for UCLA, which went on to
win 30-21.

Junior Chris Ahifeldt and senior Kevin Hansen led the Cardinal to a 3-0 sweep of No. 12 UC-lrvine, but Stanford fell
the next night to No. 2 UCLA 1 -3.
Facing a loss in a match that had
been theirs to win. the Cardinal came
out strong and determined in game
four. At 12-6, a stunned UCLA team
called a timeout. The Bruins man
aged to pull within two by 21-19, then
tie at 23-23 and take the lead a point
later.
Struggling out of a 25-25 tie, a ball
into the scorer's table was saved by
senior Kevin Hansen with a sliding
kick that brought the crowd to its feet
and the score to 27-25. Amid the
deafening roar of the crowd, the Bru
ins called another timeout. The Car

dinal responded with a solo block by
junior Chris Ahlfeldt, but UCLA
quickly brought it back to a tie, 28-28.
Starting at 29-28, Stanford had
four game points and the Bruins had
three, the last of which they convert
ed to a 34-36 win.
UCLA outblocked the Cardinal
as a team, 15 to nine, and was led by
senior Paul Johnson with 23 kills.
Stanford junior Ben Roddy respond
ed with 23 kills of his own, accompa
nied by 19 digs.
Despite the loss, Shaw said the
team would remain optimistic.
"I don't think we've lost any
ground," Shaw said. "As long as we can
keep winning and beating the teams we
need to beat, we're in pretty gtxxl
shape. We're getting a little more firm
ly entrenched in the playoff picture."

Sophomore Josh Schwarzapel and
freshman Matt Ceran did not dress
for either game. Schwarzapel has had
lingering back trouble, and Ceran has
been out with a broken thumb for
several weeks.
"Josh is practicing, but his back is
still not there KM) percent, so there is
a likelihood that we'll redshirt him
because he has only played one
match this year," Shaw said. "We're
not sure if Ceran will make it back by
the end of the season. He could be
out, but we're going to wait and see. If
we can get into the playoffs, into a
round or two. he may be able to come
back."
Neither player will see playing
time tomorrow, when Stanford takes
on California in an exhibition match
at Burnham Pavilion.
