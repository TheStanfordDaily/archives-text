# Teens who pledge abstinence still hooking up
## 
### JILL COLVIN COLUMBIA DAILY SPECTATOR 
(U-WIRE) New York. N Y. — Teens who
pledged to remain abstinent until marriage are
more likely to engage in other types of sexual
activity that increase their risk of acquiring sex
ually transmitted diseases, according to a new
study co-authored by Columbia University's
Sociology Department Chair Peter Bearman
and Yale University professor Hannah Bruck
man.
The article that published these findings,
which appears in April's issue of the Journal of
Adolescent Health, is a follow-up to a study
presented in March of last year at the National
STD Prevention Conference in Philadelphia.
That study found that teens who pledged absti
nence were just as likely to have STDs as their
nonpledging peers. The recent study may help
to explain why pledgers, who have fewer sexu
al partners and marry at an earlier age, are still
at a high risk for infection.
Although many pledgers abstained from
vaginal intercourse, the recent study found
that they still participated in other forms of
sex that may have exposed them to STDs.
The study found that young adults who took
virginity pledges were six times more likely to
have had oral sex than nonpledging teens,
and that male pledgers were four times more
likely to have engaged in anal sex than male
nonpledgers who had not had vaginal sex. In
addition, the researchers found that absti
nence pledgers were significantly less likely
to use contraception when they did engage in

sexual activity, compared to their nonpledg
ing peers. Male pledgers, for example, were
20 percent less likely to use condoms during
sex than nonpledgers. The study even re
vealed that of pledgers who have had sex, the
vast majority — 88 percent — had done so
before marriage.
Both studies were based on data from the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health, which has tracked the health-related
behaviors of about 12,000 teens, beginning in
grades 7-12.
Bearman and Bruckman's findings provide
striking evidence against the effectiveness of
abstinence-only sexual health education pro
grams.
"Advocates for abstinence-only education
assert that premarital abstinence and postmar
ital sex are necessary and sufficient for avoid
ing negative consequences of sexual activity,
such as STDs. This assertion collides with the
realities of adolescents' and young adults'
lives," the report said.
"As a social policy, pledging does not ap
pear effective in stemming STD acquisition
among young Adults," the study concluded.
Abstinence-only education programs cur
rently receive approximately $170 million dol
lars in government funding, according to the
ACLIJ.
The current study has already drawn fire
from members of the political right and those
who endorse total abstinence as the only way
to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted
diseases. Leslee Unruh. president of the Na
tional Abstinence Clearinghouse in Sioux

Falls, S.D., told the Associated Press that she
believes that Bearman and Bruckman's study
is "bogus." Unruh disputes that the partici
pants in the study had pledged abstinence be
cause "kids who pledge abstinence are taught
that any word that has 'sex' in it is considered a
sexual activity."
Bearman. however, defended the validity of
his research.
"Just because science doesn't yield what
you want does not make it 'bogus', or 'ideolog
ically motivated,"' he said in an e-mail. "In
contrast to Leslee Unruh, 1 care about the
health of all young people and all adolescents."
According to Bearman, "The pledge works
for some kids in some contexts. It does not
work for all kids in all contexts. And because
pledgers are less likely to use condoms at first
sex, their risk to acquiring an STD is not lower
than nonpledgers."
Bill Smith, public policy vice president for
the Sexuality Information and Education
Council of the United States, agreed.
"Not only do virginity pledges not work to
keep our young people safe, they are causing
harm by undermining condom use, contracep
tion and medical treatment," he told The
Washington Post last week.
Virginity pledging became popular in the
early 19905, when a group called True Love
Waits was founded to encourage teens to ab
stain from sex until marriage. It has been re
ported that more than 2.4 million young people
around the country have signed True Love
Waits pledge cards, which oblige an individual
to "make a commitment to God. myself (and)

my family to he sexually abstinent from this
day until the day I enter a hihlical marriage re
lationship."
But, as Bearman and Bruckman wrote.
"The all-or-nothing approach advocated hy
many abstinence-only programs may create
additional barriers to knowledge and protec
tion for adolescents."
Jenny Gottstein. member of the board of
Students For Choice, is also highly critical of
abstinence-only education in schools.
"Presenting the facts at school |has come to
be] seen as liberal propaganda or perverse,"
she said, and can be very "dangerous" for
young people. "Tiptoeing around the issue is a
problem. It spreads false ideas about health
and safety. The conservative effort to save stu
dents from themselves is ultimately hurting
students," Gottstein said.
Instead. Bearman and Bruckman's study
calls fora "systematic and rigorous evaluation
of the health impact of abstinence-only pro
grams (to) accompany the generous federal
and state funds that abstinence-only programs
have enjoyed."
"If we put aside ideology and concentrate
on evidence — what works — it is obvious that
pledging is not a magic bullet solving our pub
lic health woes," Bearman said.
Despite the significance of their findings,
however. Bearman is skeptical that his re
search will result in any significant policy
changes.
"Unfortunately," said Bearman, "policy is
rarely influenced by social science research
these days."

"As a social policy, pledging does not ap
pear effective in stemming STD acquisition
among young Adults," the study concluded.
Abstinence-only education programs cur
rently receive approximately $170 million dol
lars in government funding, according to the
ACLIJ.
The current study has already drawn fire
from members of the political right and those
who endorse total abstinence as the only way
to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted
diseases. Leslee Unruh. president of the Na
tional Abstinence Clearinghouse in Sioux

Falls, S.D., told the Associated Press that she
believes that Bearman and Bruckman's study
is "bogus." Unruh disputes that the partici
pants in the study had pledged abstinence be
cause "kids who pledge abstinence are taught
that any word that has 'sex' in it is considered a
sexual activity."
Bearman. however, defended the validity of
his research.
"Just because science doesn't yield what
you want does not make it 'bogus', or 'ideolog
ically motivated,"' he said in an e-mail. "In
contrast to Leslee Unruh, 1 care about the
health of all young people and all adolescents."
According to Bearman, "The pledge works
for some kids in some contexts. It does not
work for all kids in all contexts. And because
pledgers are less likely to use condoms at first
sex, their risk to acquiring an STD is not lower
than nonpledgers."
Bill Smith, public policy vice president for
the Sexuality Information and Education
Council of the United States, agreed.
"Not only do virginity pledges not work to
keep our young people safe, they are causing
harm by undermining condom use, contracep
tion and medical treatment," he told The
Washington Post last week.
Virginity pledging became popular in the
early 19905, when a group called True Love
Waits was founded to encourage teens to ab
stain from sex until marriage. It has been re
ported that more than 2.4 million young people
around the country have signed True Love
Waits pledge cards, which oblige an individual
to "make a commitment to God. myself (and)

my family to he sexually abstinent from this
day until the day I enter a hihlical marriage re
lationship."
But, as Bearman and Bruckman wrote.
"The all-or-nothing approach advocated hy
many abstinence-only programs may create
additional barriers to knowledge and protec
tion for adolescents."
Jenny Gottstein. member of the board of
Students For Choice, is also highly critical of
abstinence-only education in schools.
"Presenting the facts at school |has come to
be] seen as liberal propaganda or perverse,"
she said, and can be very "dangerous" for
young people. "Tiptoeing around the issue is a
problem. It spreads false ideas about health
and safety. The conservative effort to save stu
dents from themselves is ultimately hurting
students," Gottstein said.
Instead. Bearman and Bruckman's study
calls fora "systematic and rigorous evaluation
of the health impact of abstinence-only pro
grams (to) accompany the generous federal
and state funds that abstinence-only programs
have enjoyed."
"If we put aside ideology and concentrate
on evidence — what works — it is obvious that
pledging is not a magic bullet solving our pub
lic health woes," Bearman said.
Despite the significance of their findings,
however. Bearman is skeptical that his re
search will result in any significant policy
changes.
"Unfortunately," said Bearman, "policy is
rarely influenced by social science research
these days."
