### CAMILLE BRELAND DAILY MISSISSIPIAN 
(U-WIRE) OXFORD, Miss. — For our
neighbors to the north, heroin users may now re
ceive their daily dose on the government's tab in
a new clinical trial.
The C anadian Institutes of Health Research is
conducting a clinical trial called the North Amer
ican Opiate Medication Initiative in Canadian
cities to give free heroin to addicted users in an ef
fort to take them off the streets, lower the crime
rate and prevent health hazards, according to a
press release by the CIHR.
NAOMI plans to have 470 participants en
rolled in the program at three sites. Enrollment
began Feb. l ) in Vancouver, British Columbia and
will start this spring in Montreal and Toronto, ac
cording to CIHR.
The $8.1 million study will provide half of the
volunteers pharmaceutical-grade heroin while
the other half will receive methadone, a treat
ment for heroin addiction and cravings. The study
is funded by CI NR. the Canadian government's

health research agency, and ultimately Canadian
tax payers.
"I think it will be interesting to see what hap
pens," said Christopher McCurdy, assistant pro
fessor of medicinal chemistry and pharmacology.
McCurdy, said there is a lot of research going
on about addiction and a craving associated with
the drug, and the Canadian study could produce
successful results.
"There's a lot of relation to the whole addic
tive process that addicts go through," McCurdy
said. "Certain situations, environments and stress
are different keys that may trigger [heroin users]
to relapse."
The trial program will take between 21 and 24
months to complete. Participants receiving hero
in will be treated for 12 months before receiving
the methadone treatment for another three
months.
As fora similar program in the United States,
McCurdy said he does not see one happening in
the immediate future but could depend on results
from the Canadian trial.
"I think since [drug abuse] is such a big prob

lem in the country it should be looked into and
studied to try and make society better and health
ier," McCurdy said.
But one Ole Miss student said she does not
think a similar program would work in the U.S.
"U.S. taxpayers wouldn't be too thrilled at
paying for illegal drugs for drug addicts," said
Kezia Pigford. a senior marketing communica
tions major. Pigford, a native of Hattiesburg, said
the Canadian program "gives too much leeway
for the addicts."

ture. according to the NIDA.
The Web site also listed long-term effects of
the drug as collapsed veins, liver disease and lung
complications.
