# Law group forges ties with athletes

### BOB BOREK 
In order to develop relationships
with Stanford athletes making the
transition to professional sports, the
Stanford Entertainment and Sports
Law Association, or SESLA, held a
pair of roundtable discussions last
Friday on NCAA compliance and
mid-market sports.
"We had hoped to begin forging a
relationship with [Stanford athletes]
with our program," said law student
Seth Graham, the association's pres
ident.
To achieve this goal, SESLA in
vited National Football League
agent Stephen Baker to sit on one of
the panels. Graham, said Baker "is a
very popular agent with graduating
Stanford athletes."
Other participants included Stan
ford Athletic Director, Ted Leland;
Deputy Commissioner and General
Counselor of the National Lacrosse
League George Daniel; and the
President and General Manager of
the San Jose Earthquakes Major
League Soccer team Alexis Lalas.
The first discussion addressed the
growing trend of players leaving col
lege early for professional careers
and the pros and cons of such a deci
sion. The group explored what the
trend means in terms of player qual
ity at both the collegiate and profes
sional levels.
The second talk focused on play
er compensation in mid-market
sports and what will happen as the

sports gain higher status and salaries
begin to rise.
Though practice schedules pre
vented a number of athletes from at
tending the discussion, the smaller
turnout did not dash Graham's
hopes for networking.
"In the future, we hope to offer
programming opportunities to ath
letes which will tell them a little
more about the sports market, their
individual rights as athletes, put
them in touch with agents and pro
vide general support," he said.
SESLA was re-chartered this
year by a group of first-year students
at Stanford Law School. A student
run organization, it seeks to provide
career advice and a community for
students interested in entertainment
and sports industry careers. It al
ready has more than 50 members,
with a core group of around 15 full
time, first-year students.
Though the group has received
occasional assistance from law pro
fessors, the students do all the work
of developing relationships with in
dustry professionals, structuring
their programming efforts and inves
tigating topics of common concern.
Despite the fact that the law
school does not currently have any
classes focused on sports law, there
are classes in labor law, negotiations
and contract law, which all provide
necessary background for sports
law.
