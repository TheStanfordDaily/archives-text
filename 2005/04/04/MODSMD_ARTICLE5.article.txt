# iPods lure students to watch video
## Some students exploit loophole in Sexual Harassment Policy Office awareness campaign 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
Did you receive e-mail about sexual harass
ment and iPods recently? The giveaway of the
popular MP3 players is part of a campaign to
increase awareness of sexual harassment is
sues on campus. Until May 20, students who

watch an online training video produced by the
Sexual Harassment Policy Office are automat
ically entered into a drawing to win one of the
three iPod minis.
Laraine Zappert, the director of the Sexual
Harassment Policy Office, said that although
the office has been pushing greater awareness
of sexual harassment issues on campus since its
formation in 1993, the video is part of a recent
goal to develop a more comprehensive train
ing program for students and to inform them
about the various resources available.
"Stanford has a unique program that enlists
the efforts of 60 sexual harassment advisers
across campus who act as the 'eyes and ears' of
the University and as resources for anyone
wishing to come forward with a question or
concern about sexual harassment," she said.

"In addition, confidential resources are also
available. We decided to take advantage of
[online training] at this time and design an en
gaging and informative program that could
reach large numbers of students."
The video, which is available only to PC
users, features information about sexual ha
rassment from Vice Provost of Campus Rela
tions LaDoris Cordell, as well as a scenario
that covers the definition of sexual harassment
in a university setting and ways to prevent it.
According to the video, students who experi
ence pervasive and persistent harassment that
interferes with their experience at Stanford,
especially from other students, are often reluc
tant to come forward and report it. The video

offers several strategies and resources
to deal with sexual harassment.
Although the scenario presented
in the video deals with sexual harass
ment by a teaching assistant, Zeppert
said that the majority of sexual harass
ment incidents brought to the atten
tion of the Sexual Harassment Policy
Office involve peer-to-peer incidents.
However, the video also addresses
sexual harassment in consensual rela
tionships— especially in potentially
problematic relationships in which
one individual oversees the other, cre
ating a basic conflict of interest.
"The policy states that when such a
role exists, the person in the position
of greater authority must ensure that
he or she does not exercise any super
visory or evaluative function over the
other person in the relationship, re
cuse him or herself, and notify their
supervisor of the alternative supervi
sory arrangements put into place," she
said.
After students watch the video —
which is just under 20 minutes long —
their e-mail addresses are automatical
ly entered in a contest to win one of
three new iPod minis. However, the e
mail sent to students also offered a
chance to enter the drawing without
viewing the video, a loophole Sexual
Harassment Policy Office assistant di
rector Nan Andrews said occurred due
to compliance with California law.
Freshman Evan Kutter said that
this additional opportunity to enter
the drawing made watching the video
seem unnecessary.
"What I found funny was that the
e-mail had all these stipulations about
watching the entire video in order to
win the iPod but offers a way to get
around it,"he said. "Why would 1
watch the video?"
Andrews said that more than 100
people, many who are Mac users, have
entered the drawing by e-mail without
watching the video.
Junior Michael Bernstein, who
didn't watch the video, said he
thought sexual harassment issues are
mostly common sense.
"1 haven't heard much about the
sexual harassment policy in general,
but I feel like most people are pretty
smart about it,"he said. "I might have
watched the video if 1 didn't already
have an iPod — 1 think it's a good
start to spread the word, though."
