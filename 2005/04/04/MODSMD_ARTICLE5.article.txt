# iPods lure students to watch video
## Some students exploit loophole in Sexual Harassment Policy Office awareness campaign 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
Did you receive e-mail about sexual harass
ment and iPods recently? The giveaway of the
popular MP3 players is part of a campaign to
increase awareness of sexual harassment is
sues on campus. Until May 20, students who

watch an online training video produced by the
Sexual Harassment Policy Office are automat
ically entered into a drawing to win one of the
three iPod minis.
Laraine Zappert, the director of the Sexual
Harassment Policy Office, said that although
the office has been pushing greater awareness
of sexual harassment issues on campus since its
formation in 1993, the video is part of a recent
goal to develop a more comprehensive train
ing program for students and to inform them
about the various resources available.
"Stanford has a unique program that enlists
the efforts of 60 sexual harassment advisers
across campus who act as the 'eyes and ears' of
the University and as resources for anyone
wishing to come forward with a question or
concern about sexual harassment," she said.

"In addition, confidential resources are also
available. We decided to take advantage of
[online training] at this time and design an en
gaging and informative program that could
reach large numbers of students."
The video, which is available only to PC
users, features information about sexual ha
rassment from Vice Provost of Campus Rela
tions LaDoris Cordell, as well as a scenario
that covers the definition of sexual harassment
in a university setting and ways to prevent it.
According to the video, students who experi
ence pervasive and persistent harassment that
interferes with their experience at Stanford,
especially from other students, are often reluc
tant to come forward and report it. The video
