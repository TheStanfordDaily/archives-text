GAP CEO funding campaign against California
students and working families.
Shouldn't a store that sells to students stick up for students?
Not the GAP.
GAP founder Don Fisher is one of Governor Schwarzenegger's
leading special interest fundraisers — and one of his biggest donors.
Together, Fisher and his family have given over $150,000
to Schwarzenegger and are helping him raise millions of dollars
more — even though Schwarzenegger has raised student fees,
cut school funding, vetoed the "Car Buyers Bill of Rights" and
terminated consumer, patient and environmental protections,
while calling students and nurses "special interests."
After promising to fully fund California schools, the Governor
shortchanged K-12 students by over $2.4 billion. 10,000 students
were turned away from our colleges and universities last year
because of his higher education budget cuts.
Now Don Fisher is out raising money for the Governor's special
election attacking teachers, school funding and worker pensions
— and he's one of the leading contributors to a right-wing scheme
to silence the voice of working people.
When you pay the GAP, you pay the price.
