# Organ registry debuts
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than 87.000 Americans — about
18,000 of whom are Californians — are waiting
for an organ transplant, and 17 patients on the
waitlist die every day. In response, the Califor
nia Transplant Donor Network, or CTDN, an
nounced yesterday in White Plaza the launch
of the DonateLifeCalifornia.org, a statewide
online organ-donation registry. Officials said
they hope the registry will decrease the time
patients wait for life-saving operations.
The press conference, which included a
speech by Palo Alto mayor Jim Burch, kicked
off a four-hour event to promote organ dona

tion at Stanford. The CTDN showcased a race
car owned by heart transplant recipient Wen
dell Chambers; raffled off the snowboard of
2002 Olympic bronze medalist and liver trans
plant recipient Chris Klug; and provided com
puters in the plaza to encourage passersby to
register on the newly created Web site.
The site allows users to register if they wish
to donate organs upon their death by entering
basic demographic information and an e-mail
address. Several other states have switched to
online donor registries. California officials said
they are following suit because the online sys
tem is superior to their previous system, in
