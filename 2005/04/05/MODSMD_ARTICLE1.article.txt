# Organ registry debuts
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than 87.000 Americans — about
18,000 of whom are Californians — are waiting
for an organ transplant, and 17 patients on the
waitlist die every day. In response, the Califor
nia Transplant Donor Network, or CTDN, an
nounced yesterday in White Plaza the launch
of the DonateLifeCalifornia.org, a statewide
online organ-donation registry. Officials said
they hope the registry will decrease the time
patients wait for life-saving operations.
The press conference, which included a
speech by Palo Alto mayor Jim Burch, kicked
off a four-hour event to promote organ dona

tion at Stanford. The CTDN showcased a race
car owned by heart transplant recipient Wen
dell Chambers; raffled off the snowboard of
2002 Olympic bronze medalist and liver trans
plant recipient Chris Klug; and provided com
puters in the plaza to encourage passersby to
register on the newly created Web site.
The site allows users to register if they wish
to donate organs upon their death by entering
basic demographic information and an e-mail
address. Several other states have switched to
online donor registries. California officials said
they are following suit because the online sys
tem is superior to their previous system, in

which potential donors indicated
their preferences merely by affixing
a small pink sticker to their driver's
licenses.
"1 think it'll help to organize a
database," said first-year law stu
dent Liz Oosterhuis who, along
with five other first-year medical
students, helped organize the press
conference as a public service pro
ject. "In case someone doesn't have
a donor card on them, this can now
serve as the backup method."
CTDN Community Outreach
Coordinator Cathy Olmo agreed
with Oosterhuis.
"Today's a great day for the state
of California," Olmo said. "In the
previous system, donors weren't
registered anywhere and the dots
often fell off. Now, donors can sign
up and make that decision stick. We
hope we will save the lives of many
more people."
But precisely how many more
people the online registry will res
cue remains to be seen.
"There is no concrete goal be
cause this is the first stab at the
issue," Oosterhuis said.
Senior Afraaz Irani, who also
helped bring the press conference
to Stanford, said he just hoped the
event's publicity would encourage
students to consider donating.
"The campus is close-knit," Irani
said. "Our primary goal is to start a
discussion and no matter what peo
ple decide, we've done our job."
No matter how many additional
donors the site recruits, surgeons
and organ recipients alike have said
they will appreciate every individ
ual who volunteers.
"The limiting factor in the entire
transplantation process is the short
age of organs," said Carlos Esquiv
el, the chief transplantation surgeon
at Stanford Hospital. "Too many
die waiting for organs."
Many who attended the event
said that the online registry will
usher in a new wave of organ dona
tion efforts.
"I honestly don't even know how
to put this event into words," said
junior Chris Truxaw, a recipient of a
heart transplant in June 1997. "It's
something we've needed for awhile
and it's great to see California's get
ting behind this."
Burch echoed Truxaw's enthusi
asm for the registry.
"One of the real privileges of my
job is getting invited to events like
this," Burch said. "This is the ulti
mate recycling program. 1 think it's
important that people are made
aware of the need to donate organs.
I think people are aware of the mir
acle that occurs, but not the need to
register."
