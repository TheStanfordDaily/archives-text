On April 5,1937, The Daily reported
an automobile incident that occurred
on campus. lielow is an excerpt:
"Eleanor Kennedy and Winifred
Horn, Robleites, were injured last
Friday when their auto crashed into
a car operated by Mrs. Arthur Hard
castle, Los Altos school-teacher, at
the hlind intersection of Foothill
Boulevard and Page Mill Road be
hind the campus.
" The condition of Miss Kennedy,
who suffered minor fractures of sev
eral vertebrae and a severely bruised
back, is reported by the Palo Alto
Hospital as being improved. Miss
Horn escaped with minor lacera
tions, as did Mrs. Hardcastle, who
was treated for shock.
"Mrs. Hardcastle, returning from
Los Lomitas school where she teach
es, was hit as she entered the inter
section by the Robleites, who were
driving south on Page Mill Road.
Her car was torn almost in two by the
crash, while Miss Kennedy's car
swerved across the road, through a

fence and overturned. The occu
pants were thrown out."
On April 5, 1994, The Daily reported
that the Dish collapsed to the ground
during a maintenance operation.
Below is an excerpt:
"Instead of gathering radio waves
for scientific examination, the Dish
is gathering dust as it lies nose first in
the ground after a cable in the sup
port mechanism snapped last month.
"SRI International workers ex
amining the Dish's antennae March
18 were attempting to lower the
13,9(X) pound tripod mechanism —
the part with the antenna that ex
tends out in front — when the cable
holding the mechanism broke.
"All three of the Dish's legs also
buckled, said SRI Program Manager
Mike Cousins. In addition, the upper
leg punctured the Dish's surface,
breaking some struts.
"Cousins said repairs will proba
bly begin in a month and could take
as long as three months to complete.

Until then, admirers of the Dish
must wait to see the monument back
on its feet.
44 'Chances are pretty good that
we will get the Dish fixed,' Cousins
said. 'But we've also gotten cost esti
mates to remove the Dish. But no
one's very happy about that idea.'
"The cable that snapped is 24
years old. Cousins said, and its
'strands began to lray.'
Although the cable was exam
ined periodically, it was never re
placed because the deteriorating
area was 'not accessible and it was
not obvious there was a problem
there,' Cousins said, adding that he
had since learned the correct proce
dure to replace the cable periodical
ly. . J ,
44 'Everyone who ever raised the
tripod wondered what it would be
like if it were to fall,' Cousins added.
'They found out the hard way, but
fortunately no was injured.' 44
