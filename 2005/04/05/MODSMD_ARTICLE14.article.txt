### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
This week marks the beginning of 2005 In
tersorority Council, or ISC, recruitment. But
rush will be a little different this year, with
ISC is switching to an online system for the
first time.
"We're all very excited about the new sys
tem," said junior Carly Geehr, one of ISC's
recruitment chairs and a member of Delta
Delta Delta. "The system will make it easier
for the chapters and the ISC to keep track of
women as they progress through each round
of recruitment."

Senior Molly Melcher, also a recruitment
chair, said the online registration stands to
help not only the ISC and individual sorori
ties, but also prospective members.
"1 think the ease of online registration has
boosted enrollment," she said. "Even with a
day left until orientation, we already had
more women signed up than participated last
year."
Junior Mira Rapp-Hooper, president of Fi
Beta Phi, said that in the recent years, interest
in sororities and the number of girls who sign
up for recruitment has been declining.
" This year, however, we had a peak the in
numbers of girls who signed up for recruit

ment," she said. "I think this is, in part, be
cause of the new and easy online system."
Geehr said that the ISC has been widely
advertising the new process so that women on
campus are aware that they need to register
online to formally rush sororities.
"We've been heavily using e-advertising
—we used Thelacebook.com, the resident
assistant e-mail list and e-flyers," Geehr said.
"Plus, we've been tabling; we put a banner up
in White Plaza, we flyered, we went to house
meetings and we made the Internet address
an easy one to remember —
recruitment.stanford.edu. The easier it is, the
more people will register."

Some students, however, said the ISC's ad
vertising efforts have not been visible
enough.
"The advertising efforts of the sororities
were almost completely ineffective," said
freshman Yuri Yamaguchi. "Handbooks
lying around and several e-mails were all I
got."
Freshman Amanda Mendoza agreed that
she had heard little about the new online sys
tem and ISC recruitment in general.
"Everything I heard about it was mostly
from word of mouth." she said.
