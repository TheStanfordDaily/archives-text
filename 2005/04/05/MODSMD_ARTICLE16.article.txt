## Is Compassionate Capitalism the Cure? 
### 
This week we interviewed David Green, founder
and executive director of Project Impact. Green's in
novations in technology and distribution have helped
make healthcare accessible in developing countries.
He is a past recipient of both a Mac Arthur Fellowship
and an Ashoka Fellowship.
The Daily: You've helped prevent disabilities across
the developing world. How did you do it?
David Green: There are basically two ideas behind
what I've done. The first idea is [that] it is possible
make healthcare both self-sustaining and still orien
tated towards providing for the poor. You can do this
with a multi-tiered pricing system — where free is the
lowest price. The second big idea is that you can re
duce the price of key medical products.
TD: How do you reduce the cost of medical prod
ucts?
DG: Consider the case of intraocular lenses. In the
1970s in America, using intraocular lenses became
the procedure-of-choice cataract surgery. 1 was get
ting lots of intraocular lenses donated, since cataracts

are the main cause of
blindness in the world.
When the donation
of lenses started drying
up, we started looking to
making interlocutor
lenses. That's when we
set Aurolab in south
India, which now sells
over 600,000 lenses a
year to over 80 coun
tries. It meets the same
regulatory requirements
as other companies do in
order to sell in Europe.

When we started, the lenses sold for $3(X) in de
veloped country markets and oversloo in markets in
India. Now, our price is around $4. We have been
able to bring down the price to key technology and
make them available to non-profit programs. In turn,
this helps those programs become sustainable.
Since then, we have done the same for producing
suture and hearing aides.
TI): You promote a "sliding-scale" of payment for
medical services. How can that be sustainable?
DG; A lot of my earlier work I did in conjunction with
Aravind Eye Hospital in India. It is one of the largest
eye care programs in the world.
Aravind Eye Hospital has a model where 47 per
cent of patients pay nothing, 10 percent pay two
thirds cost, and 35 percent pay well above cost. That
model allows it to be self-sustaining. For every dollar
they spend, they make about a $1.60. They do over
220,(KK) surgeries a year.
With multi-tiered pricing, you can offer first-rate
quality to rich and poor alike, rather than offer third
rate quality to people.
TI): You design, produce and distribute medical de
vices—just like any other company. What's differ
ent about your approach?
DG: We have consciously chosen to maximize distri
bution — while still remaining sustainable.
That's quite different from how most corporations
exist. Most corporations have an ethical responsibili
ty to provide a return on investment to shareholders.
In the case of Aurolabs, we have no shareholders.
Our shareholders are the communities and the peo
ple that benefit from our work. It's a different busi
ness model.
TI): Obviously, there's a lot of need at the "bottom of
the pyramid." Why aren't multinational corporations
serving those people better?
DG: Multinational corporations usually are not con
vinced that developing markets are viable for them to
go into. Usually, multinationals perceive such mar
kets as costing too much to develop and having too
low of margins.
We consciously decided that if we can't convince
companies to lower their prices and still make mar
gins, then we would instead try to gain control of tech
nology, production, distribution and pricing to better
serve the poor.
For me, the question is this: How can we transform
corporate behavior so that corporations use more of
their core competencies and assets to help the world?
How do you make important products more afford
able to those that need them?
TI): Some people think that capitalism is all about the
bottom line. How does one practice more compas
sionate capitalism?
DG: There are two ways you can pursue compas
sionate capitalism.
First, you can do what we have done and develop
a fresh approach. That is really hard. You have to be
willing to take risks, and you have to be ready for fail
ure. Most ventures like mine fail.
Second, you can be a force for change in the cor
porate environment in which you find yourself. This
route is probably equally hard. Most corporations in
the industries 1 work in have similar cost structures to
mine and have a lot more wherewithal.
Stanford students as they move into the corporate
world have the intelligence and wherewithal to bring
about that level of transformation in their corpora
tions.
