# Student group offers Web design workshops
## 
### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Do you have a Web site that could be enhanced with
Javascript? Have you been meaning to learn Photoshop
but can't fit a Web design class into your schedule? Could
your student group benefit from a snazzier Web pres
ence? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then
you are exactly whom Stanford Technology Assist by Stu
dents, otherwise known as TABS, is out to help with its
Webworks workshops. TABS is a student organization
that offers Web design services to non-profit groups.
First offered in spring quarter of 2003, Webworks
workshops consist of five hour-long, weekly classes on
various topics of Web design, including Web site layout
strategies, Photoshop. HTML and Javascript. The classes,
taught by one of eight Webworks course leaders, are open
to all student? on a first-come, first-serve basis. However,
no Stanford units are offered.
"The spring workshops, which covered HTML, Pho
toshop and style sheets, proved extremely successful, so
we decided to continue them this year," said Brian De
Chesare. TABS projects officer. "We expanded the focus
to include dynamic Web site building using PHP, so stu
dents could make their own photo galleries, shopping
sites and more."
Sophomore Harry Zhong, a course leader, noted that
this spring quarter the workshops would focus on Web
basics topics, including HTML and Dream Weaver, which
are tools that allow people to build Web sites.
Like Zhong, the instructors of the workshops are all
students, looking to share Web design skills with the
broader Stanford community. Although they are all
part of the same program, their computer backgrounds
differ significantly. Zhong had designed several Web
pages, but had never taken any computer science class
es when he started teaching, while another course lead
er, junior Eden Adogla, is an electrical engineer major
with a concentration in Software. And junior Tim
Chang, who started Webworks and designed the origi
nal curriculum during the winter of 2003, knew C++ but
had never built a professional Web site until he joined
TABS.
"I got into TABS because they advertised that people
with any level of ability were welcome to teach." said se
nior Vanessa Baker, another TABS workshop leader. "1
actually wanted the opportunity to teach so that I could
learn more. I'm actually an English major, but I'm also an
RCC at Roth, and I like having technical expertise."
Course leaders are completely responsible for their
workshops, though they may be guided by handouts and
curricula from previous courses.

"We prepare our own curriculum and materials and
make decisions on how to run the workshops," Adogla
said.
The desire for technical expertise is what draws a wide
mix of participants in Webworks workshops. Attendees
include computer science and English majors alike, as
well as some Stanford faculty and staff members.
"Most of them participate simply because they want to
learn about how to make Web sites, and we can teach it to
them easily within this five week series," Chang said.
However, students don't necessarily treat the work
shops like a continuous course. Course leaders have no
ticed that attendance at the classes tends to drop off
around midterms. But the Photoshop workshop is a par
ticularly popular topic and draws students who don't at
tend other workshop sessions.
"Attendance depends on the season, how exciting or
scary or exotic or esoteric the topic of the workshop
sounds," Adogla said.
While Webworks workshops allow members of the
Stanford community to learn about Web design, Adogla
pointed out that the other main function of these classes
is to provide the opportunity for Stanford students to
share their expertise as course leaders. The workshops
are also an important part of the TABS mission to sup
port Bay Area non-profit organizations and Stanford stu
dent groups, such as Stanford Project on Hunger and

Stanford Beyond Bars, in constructing and maintaining
their own Web presence. Teams of TABS students vol
unteer to construct Web sites for such groups but they
have found that once completed, groups do not have the
skills to maintain them. That's where the workshops
come in.
"We believe many in both the Stanford community
and nonprofit community would benefit from knowing
basic Web design, in order to both create new projects
and maintain existing ones that TABS has created for
them." DeChesare said.
And participants in the Webworks workshops can use
their new skills to continue promoting the TABS mission.
Students are encouraged to participate in Projects Day,
an event sponsored by TABS, where students build Web
sites for local non-profits.
"Not only does this provide experience for the student,
it also gives them a way of having an impact on the outside
community," Chang said.
Clearly, the skills being taught in Webworks work
shops will be applicable beyond Stanford campus. Sev
eral of the course leaders shared the conviction that
Web design is an important skill that is useful for every
one.
"We're hoping our workshops can help people set up
their own basic sites and be piqued by the medium to pur
sue it further on their own with help from us," Zhong said.
