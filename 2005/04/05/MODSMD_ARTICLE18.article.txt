# BlackBerrys pop up around campus

### AMANDA MITCHELL 
Senior Michael Ortiz first discovered the benefits of
the Blackßerry device, a type of Personal Data Assis
tant (PDA), while interning at the office of U.S. Sena
tor Harry Reid (D-NV). Everyone on staff had the de
vice. he said, and in the beginning of 2(X)5. he purchased
one for himself.
The sleek Blackßerry device — which integrates
wireless phone, Internet, data and e-mail technologies
— now boasts two million subscribers worldwide, com
posed mainly of business professionals. Yet a growing
number of college students, like Ortiz, have joined the
Blackßerry craze and enthusiastically praise its innova
tive capabilities.
"With courses, work and activities. 1 found I was
away from my computer for most of the day," Ortiz
said. "With the Blackßerry. I can respond to e-mails,
especially those warranting immediate attention. Since
I carried a phone and Palm Pilot with me during the
day. 1 figured why not add an e-mail function and only
use one device."

The Blackßerry's "Push" technology, which sends
e-mails from a subscriber's computer directly to the de
vice, is one of its most acclaimed features, leading the
Blackßerry Web site to boast that they carry "the best
messaging phones in the business."
However, this is not the only feature that has cos
turners raving.
"Although I like to be able to send and receive e
mails from wherever I am. I use Blackßerry to organize
my life," Eser Chamoglu, a senior, said. "I keep track of
all of my appointments and deadlines on my Blackßer
ry. It serves as my address book, and I occasionally use
it to take notes."
Each Black Berry device also features a high resolu
tion LCD screen. Bluetooth wireless capabilities and an
HTML browser. Its Sure Type keypad, with a QWER
TY design (like a keyboard) and software that learns
frequently used words, makes typing e-mails and notes
simple.
"The Blackßerry's keyboard is great," Chamoglu
said. "I have tried out many of the competing devices,
and the Blackßerry is the most ergonomic. Each letter

has its own key, and the keys are large enough and
spaced wide enough apart that I can use my thumbs to
type out messages without making typos."
Though it faces tough competition from other
PDAs, such as Palm One's Treo or Microsoft's Pocket-
PC, Blackßerry subscribers believe the advantages of
their devices outweigh those of competing brands.
"Although many of the competing devices have fea
tures that the Blackßerry lacks [such as, built-in cam
eras, MP3 players, etc.] those devices are nowhere near
as useable as the Blackßerry when it comes to doing
what the Blackßerry does best — sending and receiv
ing e-mails," Chamoglu said. "The purpose of the
Blackßerry is to enable instant communication, and it
does that extremely well."
The recent 7100 series of Blackßerry products,
available in five different models, feature full interna
tional coverage and quad-band frequencies that allow
subscribers to use their devices easily in North Ameri
ca, Europe and Asia.
"I was in Europe over winter break," Chamoglu
said. "And before I stepped off the plane my Black-
Berry had started downloading my e-mails. It's pretty
neat."
"Also, business travelers who use Blackßerry have
e-mail and phone access wherever they are," he added.
"This also means that travelers don't have to carry lap
tops to keep in touch, which can be a pain because ho
tels make it costly and difficult to get online."
Due to its expense, the Blackßerry world, successful
as it may be, remains primarily a service for profession
als in need of fast, reliable Internet and e-mail tools.
"Everyone 1 know that uses Blackßerry works in a
government or business position," Ortiz said, 'it's be
come a very important product to executives in those
fields."
An especially attractive feature for those profes
sionals considering Blackßerry devices is the growing
trend of companies that finance them for their employ
ees in hopes of improving client communication. While
those higher up in the ranks are happy about this con
venience, the Blackßerrys keep employees connected
all of the time — which can sometimes be a curse rather
than a blessing.
Freshman Casey Zuber, who does not have a Black-
Berry, joked, "My dad's company bought him one. He
calls it his leash."
Yet for the average student, whose routine commu
nication needs may not include instant e-mail response
capabilities and international Internet access, the
Blackßerry may not be an essential gadget.
"For someone who stays mostly on campus, I would
not recommend the Blackßerry," Chamoglu said.
"There are plenty of ways to readily access the Internet
from campus, so the features of the Blackßerry would
probably not be worth the cost."
The Blackßerry devices, which sell for approxi
mately $300 at Cingular and T-Mobile, also require a
$39.99 monthly fee for data access in addition to anoth
er monthly fee for voice capabilities. Competing gad
gets, such as the Treo devices, retail at similar prices at
Sprint.
Freshman Kevin Montag noted cost as one of the
factors that would keep him from subscribing to Black-
Berry.
"It would probably be too expensive for what 1 need
now," he said. "But I would definitely consider it in the
future, especially if my company paid for it. It seems
like the wave of the future."

Yet for the average student, whose routine commu
nication needs may not include instant e-mail response
capabilities and international Internet access, the
Blackßerry may not be an essential gadget.
"For someone who stays mostly on campus, I would
not recommend the Blackßerry," Chamoglu said.
"There are plenty of ways to readily access the Internet
from campus, so the features of the Blackßerry would
probably not be worth the cost."
The Blackßerry devices, which sell for approxi
mately $300 at Cingular and T-Mobile, also require a
$39.99 monthly fee for data access in addition to anoth
er monthly fee for voice capabilities. Competing gad
gets, such as the Treo devices, retail at similar prices at
Sprint.
Freshman Kevin Montag noted cost as one of the
factors that would keep him from subscribing to Black-
Berry.
"It would probably be too expensive for what 1 need
now," he said. "But I would definitely consider it in the
future, especially if my company paid for it. It seems
like the wave of the future."
