## Editorial Clean your own room 
### 
Earlier this year, some entrepreneurial Harvard stu
dents stirred up a controversy when they introduced Dor
m Aid, a cleaning service for Harvard students "tcx) busy"
(read: lazy) to clean their own rooms. This practice was
loudly and rightfully denounced by other students and by
The Harvard Crimson.
Before you poke fun or criticize Harvard students, you
should know that Stanford students also choose to partici
pate in a dorm-cleaning program — one that not only use
lessly pampers its custc>mers, but also serves t< > highlight the
discrepancies among Stanford's socioeconomic classes.
The Stanford University Student 1 lousing Houseclean
ing Enterprise is a service offered by Residential Housing.
The program offers weekly, bi-weekly, monthly or one
time cleaning services for all Stanford rooms and apart
ments, and is available to all students living on campus. The
program also offers dry cleaning services.
The program's Web site guarantees the satisfaction of
its users, and promotes its "dependable, consistent, uni
formed and supervised two-person teams."
Cleaning costs differ depending on residence. The fee
fora standard d( >rm r< x>m is $2(), while cleaning a residence
in Schwab with a bathroom and a kitchenette costs $4<).
There are a few potential excuses students could use to
justify taking part in the dorm-cleaning program, but very
few — if any — of these excuses are legitimate:
"I hate when my room is messy, and they do a great job
cleaning it." Dorm life is an essential part of every student's
experience at Stanford, and messy dorm rooms are an inte
gral part of college. Part of the fun of keeping one's entire
life in one small room is figuring out where to put every
thing, and for many students, the answer is clear: on the

floor, chaotically stashed in the closet, thrown behind the
desk. The only people wh< > aren't guilty of these sins are the
students who would be least likely to request cleaning ser
vices.
"I'm so busy, and I just don't have time to clean my
room." Regardless of how often a student cleans his room,
undertaking that cleaning process is a rite of passage that
should not be eliminated. Findinga lost item buried in a pile
of clothes or stumbling upon a $20 bill stuffed into some
dirty pants pocket is an exhilarating feeling that is lost when
students ask Residential Housing's already busy staff to
clean up after their mess.
"Last year my mom made sure I was organized and that
my room was clean; how can I be expected to be self-suffi
cient only a few months later?" College is supposed to pre
pare us for what lies ahead; it is not a continuation of high
sch(«)l, and students should no longer count on mom to do
their dirty work for them. TTie dorm-cleaning program
pampers students too much; by paying to have their rooms
cleaned, students are neither living in the reality of college
nor are they preparing themselves for the future.
In addition, because this is not a necessary service, the
program itself separates the wealthy students from the less
well off; students who regularly shell out money for dorm
room cleaning are effectively putting a neon sign on their
foreheads that reads: "I have money, and I don't care if 1
waste it." Messy dorm rooms should transcend socioeco
nomic lines.not create a deeper schism between them.
"My roommate is a nightmare. This is the <inly way that
1 can keep his or her mess out of control and prevent the llies
from gaining a secure foothold for their invasion of our
room." We 11... yeah, that sucks. Good luck. You'll need it.
