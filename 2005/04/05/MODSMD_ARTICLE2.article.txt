# GSB rejects online hackers
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Patience is a virtue, and impatience — as some
Graduate School of Business applicants learned
the hard way — can override one's dreams of a
Stanford Masters of Business Administration.
On Thursday. Business School Dean Robert
Joss announced that none of the 41 applicants
who hacked into the system to sneak an early
peek at their admission status would be admitted.
On March 2, someone with the username
"brookbond" hacked into Apply Yourself. Inc.s

application software to view admission decisions
and posted instructions on the Business Week on
line forum showing others could to do the same.
In the nine hours before the problem was
patched, 150 students attempted to view their ad
mission status for the business schools at Stanford,
Harvard, Duke, Carnegie Mellon, Dartmouth
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The ruse turned out to be a twofold mistake
for the applicants. Most of the decisions had not
yet been posted, and worse yet. Apply Yourself
technicians quickly exposed the
names of the hackers to the universi
ties. But unlike Harvard and
Carnegie Mellon — who immediate
ly denied admission to all offenders
— Stanford did not reject the guilty
applicants outright.
Instead, as Business School Admis
sions Director Derrick Bolton told
The Daily in a March 8 article, "Stan
ford reaches admission decisions indi
vidually and will not make a collective
judgment on individual applications."
The decisions for this year's admis
sion process were released on Thurs
day and all 41 Stanford applicants who
reportedly hacked were denied admis
sion.
"We asked each applicant who had
breached the Apply Yourself software
to contact us with an explanation,"
Joss said in a statement on the Business
School's Web site. "None of those who
gained unauthorized access was able
to explain his or her actions to our sat
isfaction."
Joss added that he hopes the appli
cants involved "might learn from their
experience."
Sanford Kreisberg, an independent
admissions consultant for students ap
plying to elite business sch<x)ls, served
as an advisor for many of the offenders
— including about 50 of the 119 Har

vard hackers — after Apply Yourself
released their names.
"I give Stanford a lot of credit for
the way they handled this," Kreisberg
said in an interview with The Daily.
"They treated it with due process and
respect for the applicants, and they
treated it as a learning process."
In contrast, Kreisberg said he de
plored Harvard's treatment of the situ
ation, calling it "grandstanding and de
monizing."
"Business schools have a problem
with ethics," he said, adding that the
outright rejection of some students
may have been a way for MBA pro
grams to save face in the wake of "gi
gantic waves of ethical scandals," such
as the Enron debacle, that have shak
en the business world in recent years.
Stanford business student lan Hill
agreed that Harvard's approach was
unwarranted, considering how simple
he believes the "hacking" instructions
to have been.
"I don't think that billing it as 'hack
ing' is acceptable because all you had
to do is delete part of the URL to get
access to the admissions site," Hill said.
If accessing the information was more
difficult. Hill said he believes many of
the students would have more readily
taken a moment to reflect on what
they were doing.
He added that he could see himself
"in the moment and in the excitement"
neglecting to consider whether such an
easy act was unethical, and thinking,
"well, what does it technically matter if
I found out a bit early?"
