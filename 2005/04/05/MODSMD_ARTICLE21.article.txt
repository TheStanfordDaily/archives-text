# Tales of a 19th-grade nothing
## The
						shallow end of the gene pool 
### 
I hate the Mountain View Wal-
Mart. If there is a bright center to the
universe, that's the place it's farthest
from. The only thing more remark
able than how much 1 loathe my trips
there is the fact that 1 keep going back.
I mean, I know Target is right across
the street, but still I go to Wal-Mart.
Where the hell else am I going to find
trash cans, coffee makers and string?
No matter how bad I'm feeling about

my life, a little wading through the shallow end of the
gene pool always makes it seem not so had. And for all
the crap I'll take for writing this, you have all had the
same experience and are laughing and nodding despite
yourself.
It starts in the parking lot. No matter what time or
what day you go, there is a major parking crisis. The bare
ly navigable lot is lull of notably unhurried elderly drivers
and parking place stalkers for whom the extra hundred
yards of walking is an intolerable hardship. Combine this
with a group of pedestrians who have the same sensibili
ty to oncoming traffic as possums and deer do, and a col
lection of unseemly individuals who, as hard as it is to be
lieve, seem to just be "hanging out" around the entrance
and you've a recipe for annoyance and discomfort long
before you even get into the store.
Once inside, you get a brief glimpse of the war zone
that is the customer service counter followed by per
haps the most tragic alliance of culturally pervasive
American commercial icons ever: the in-store McDon
ald's. Ugh. As if my experience wasn't unpalatable
enough. Then you get to navigate the sea of sloth and
discord that is the checkout lines (which you'll get to
revisit soon enough), and for your viewing pleasure
you get to see the finest of the customer base, those
who shop for clothing there. There are two discoveries
in this carnival-esque introduction: (1) no one except
you is in any sort ol hurry, including (perhaps especial
ly) the employees and (2) the one thing the wretched
masses seem to be really good at is reproducing. I'm
not saying that I hate kids, but when they come out
with a discount store that only allows single, profes
sional adults to shop there, I'll be first in line. S.P.A-
Mart, anyone?

In the store-proper, can someone explain to me why
the building layout seems to have perplexed everyone
except me? Every corner or main aisle has caravans of
cart-toting families and couples, each sporting that
minimum-wage stare. You know, the one that makes
you think the most natural thing to come out of their
mouth would be: "Fries with that?" And God help you
if you need assistance from a Wal-Mart associate.
Aside from being harder to locate than respectable
night-time entertainment in Palo Alto, the only differ
ence between them and the other unsavory shoppers is
their neat little blue vest. They don't even try to sound
authoritative, they just mumble and look around until
you just get frustrated and walk away.
Once you've finally gotten what you need, it's time
to get out — and fast. But, no matter how busy it was
when you first walked in the store, or what time of
year, as soon as you walk up the Christmas rush hits
and it's time fora cashier shift change. What's worse,
the people you could previously avoid by moving
briskly and purposefully through the store now com
pletely surround you. After selecting what looks to be
the shortest line, you'll discover that someone in front
of you is paying in the slowest method available. Per
sonally, I've seen checks, food stamps and,honestly, a
ziplock bag of spare change — and he was buying
jeans. There will also be, at least, one loud and poorly
behaved child nearby. And no matter how little you
purchase, you'll set off the security system, leading to
a bag check from the world's least intimidating securi
ty employee. Seriously, just exactly who is grandma
going to stop from fleeing the store with their ill-gotten
$4.99 DVD? Then, you get to re-navigate the parking
lot, and finally, hopefully, drive away — your faith in
humanity destroyed, vowing never to return.
Maybe I've confirmed the belief of my critics that I
am. in fact, a fascist. Either way, 1 know I'll get that same
familiar knot of terrible anticipation in the pit of my
stomach the next time 1 run out of string and trash bags.
And. revealing the business genius of Sam Walton, I'll go
back anvways.

(Jlenn Truitt is not a Target employee and still doesn V know
why he buys string anyways. Relate yr mr own personal Wal-
Mart horror stories to him at glennt97@stanford.edu.
