# Holt's harangue
## I am Charlotte Stanfordite 
### 
Taking a cue
from Tom Wolfe,
I've decided to
write a story
about college life.
Unlike Tom
Wolfe though, I
won't be wearing
white suits that
make me look
like Colonel

Sanders. And instead of Charlotte
Simmons, I'll call my character Char
lotte Stanfordite.
Charlotte is an idealistic student
who attends a prestigious university
and wants to make change or, at the
very least, pad her resume. She de
cides to run for an ASSU position.
She wakes up one morning and finds
that the entirety of White Plaza has
been covered in a six-inch deep thick
blanket of posters. There is nowhere
on White Plaza that the word
"white" now applies, for every sur
face is choked by neon posters and
fliers espousing a specific candidate's
cause. Charlotte realizes that she has
woken up a day late and now is in
trouble of losing the election. Al
though she finds not a single flier ac
tually espouses a political message
other than "change," she realizes she
is at a major disadvantage.
So she begins to make her own
fliers and posters. She realizes that
being on the ASSU must be diffi
cult, because she gets a taste of the
tough decision-making process im
mediately: should she create a slo
gan that involves a terrible pun on
her last name or perhaps a pop-cul
ture reference to a movie over 10
years old? Charlotte ultimately de
cides on "Vote Stanfordite, Aite?!"
She then covers the poster with pic
tures of her looking very Stanford
ish. She is smiling at parties, at
sports events, at the bookstore.
There are so many pictures of her
smiling that on Friday night a stu
dent on acid is convinced she is
Satan and is after his gallbladder.
Somehow, Charlotte is able to
find space in White Plaza to put her
posters. She staples a large number
on the column by the bookstore that,
after the election is over, will be re
vealed to be a tree. She hires a plane
to spell out her name in the sky, just
to be sure. She is aghast that some
students are hiring friends to hold
signs up on bikes or making t-shirts.
That's beneath her, she assures her
self, as she orders the plane to make
another pass over the school.
She hasn't thought of a political
campaign yet, but then again, none
of her adversaries have either. She
ultimately puts on the Web site for

the election that she wants to change
the ASSU, increase communication
with the student body, and then
throws in some overly optimistic goal
that sounds good but would only
happen when toasters fly. Charlotte
promises: "To reduce the cost of liv
ing."
Charlotte then finds, to her hor
ror, that she is still being bested. Her
opponents have used
Thefacebook.com, that devilishly
popular stalking tool, to gain an edge.
On the site, her opponents have invit
ed the entire campus to join their
"groups." These groups are basically
all united in that they will vote for the
person that is the namesake of the
group, and otherwise have nothing in
common. Half of them haven't actu
ally read the groups' description,
which could range from "Get me
elected, k?" to "1 will breed a loyal
army of mutant squirrels to eat the
brains of the ASSU Senate."
Charlotte creates her own face
book.com group and invites every
one on the campus. She has a picture
of her with a red cup in her hand,
smiling like a Cheshire Cat. She uses
the words "totally" and "communi
cation" 20 times on the Web page.
With her and her opponents all cre
ating facebook groups, they have in
creased the spam that people receive
exponentially. A humor columnist
working for The Daily begins to pull
out his hair in clumps.
At the debate, nothing is actually
talked about. The candidates bad
mouth one another, claiming their
opponents haven't talked to enough
campus groups or have no experi
ence/are a slave of the system. Ulti
mately, it breaks down into a slam
rap event very similar to a scene from
"8 Mile." Votes are tallied by noise
level. Charlotte is able to call her op
ponent a "special interest slut" and
this more than anything wins the
election, grabbing her victory from
the jaws of actual debate and safely
lulling the campus back to a state of
student-government-apathy for an
other year.
I'm not Charlotte Stanfordite. Or
Charlotte Simmons.
I'm a jerk. Call me cynical, but I
just really haven't seen the ASSU de
liver on anything in the last year that
really made me go "Oh good, I'm
glad they were elected ... instead of
a deceased mountain lion."
Forget the dark horse candidate.
This year, I want to see the dead fe
line candidate win.
