Arctic drilling is not a sound energy policy
I appreciated the article "Students respond to Arctic
drilling" (April 1) and the coverage that The Daily gave
to this important and controversial issue. That said, I
would like to take the opportunity to dispel some of the
myths postured by the anti-refuge advocates and point
out some of the fallacies that they use to promote drilling
in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR. as a
real energy policy.
In The Daily's article, former College Republicans
vice president Capp Culver suggested that "the 5 per
cent of domestic consumption that would be produced
[by drilling in ANWR| would allow for the United
States not to have to import from countries that are in
opposition to it." However, the United States Geologi
cal Survey, which was in charge of evaluating the oil de
velopment potential in ANWR in the form of an Envi
ronmental Impact Assessment (EIA), predicted that

the most significant amount of oil that could be extract
ed profitably from ANWR is only 6.7 billion barrels
over the course of 10 years. This generous estimate is
still less than the 7.3 billion barrels the United States
consumes yearly. These oil resources will not even
enter U.S. markets for at least another 10 years. The
EIA predicts that only slightly over 1 percent of pro
jected U.S. oil consumption through 2050 could be sat
isfied by the oil developed in ANWR.
The United States represents only 5 percent of the
world's population; however it consumes around 28 per
cent of all oil produced. With only 3 percent of the
world's established oil reserves, we cannot drill our way
to oil independence. There are other routes, however,
that we as a country can take that will allow us to take
much more significant steps away from relying on oil
regimes that violate human rights and pose security
threats. Just to give one example, simply raising the Cor
porate Average Fuel Economy standards, which would

increase the minimum fuel efficiency of automobile en
gines with available technology, would save more oil in a
year than estimates of all the oil that could ever come out
of ANWR.
Contrary to Culver's claims, drilling in ANWR is not
a "sound energy policy," but rather a distraction from the
development of a real one. What we need is an energy
policy that couples methods to conserve our fossil fuel re
sources with new, renewable technologies like wind and
solar power.

New SAT essay should supplement old
college application essays
Apparently the editorial board of the Daily got a heap
ing teaspoon of Pollyanna powder with its morning
bowel of grape nuts ("New SAT shouldn't affect Stan

ford admissions," April 4). The editors think that the ad
missions office will get a more "holistic" look at Stan
ford's applicants, "a better sense of the person behind
the numbers," by relying more heavily on students' ap
plication essays than the new proctored SAT essay. Even
discounting the holistic mumbo jumbo, a code word for
affirmative action, the new SAT essay should replace the
old essays, not supplement them.
While acknowledging the "pernicious effect" that
the coaching industry has had on admissions, your edi
torial amnesiacs don't account for the fact that the
coaches often write those lovely personal essays.
Though students' grade point averages and SATs may
not perfectly predict academic promise, they are a
much more honest measure than turning the process
into an academic decathlon among the applicants' pur
chased surrogates.
