### CAMILLE RICKETTS MANAGING EDITOR 
When Junior Albert Chang
saw Secretary Colin Powell ex
cuse himself from a conference,
the then-State Department in
tern followed â€” right into the
men's restroom, where Chang
promptly informed Powell that
he trumped Albert Einstein as
his childhood idol.
The secretary wished him
luck with his career, and it must
have worked since Chang was re
cently named one of 75 students
nationwide to receive the Harry
S. Truman Scholarship, a
$30,000 award for graduate
study given to undergraduate
students committed to careers in
government.
But then again it's hard to be
lieve luck was involved at all,
considering that Chang has al
ready worked for two foreign
policy think tanks in addition to
his stint at State this past fall. He
has also already published three
papers on international security.
A political science and East
Asian studies major, Chang tells
most people point blank that he
hopes to one day be secretary of
state or national security advisor.
He said he thinks it was this can
dor, coupled with a cool and ca

the Stanford nominating com
mittee and ultimately the panel
that interviewed finalists last
quarter.
"I think it was the laughs, and
I told a lot of anecdotes," Chang
said. "I told them I thought I
must be working hard because I
already have a few gray hairs.
They seemed to like that."
In response to a question
about what he would do to dif
fuse tensions between Taiwan
and mainland China, Chang as
signed roles to each panelist to

play in the scenario as he pre
sented his ideas. At one point he
was even asked to sing, and with
out skipping a beat, he delivered
a theatrical rendition of "A
Whole New World" from Dis
ney's "Aladdin."
But the interview wasn't all
fun and games and many of the
questions caught him by com
plete surprise, he said. Among
other things, they asked him to
name his favorite painting and
three ancient battles that offer
lessons on contemporary mili
tary strategy.
"There was no way I could
have possibly prepared for it,"
Chang said. "They want to push
you into a corner and make you
upset to see if you can handle the
pressure."
