# Bionic eye could stimulate sight in blind
## 
### KATHERINE COX 
A group of Stanford researchers
this February unveiled a new tech
nology that could someday simulate
vision for the blind.
Collaborating in an interdiscipli
nary effort to present this innovation
— a highly sensitive retinal prosthe
sis called the bionic eye — a team of
researchers and faculty members
from the Departments of Ophthal
mology, Cell Biology, Physics and
Neurobiology, as well as from the
Hansen Experimental Physics Labo
ratory, published an extensive article
in the Journal of Neural Engineer
ing.
Harvey Fishman, director of
Stanford's Opththalmic Tissue Engi
neering Laboratory, spearheaded
the research, which was funded by
the Air Force Office of Scientific Re
search.
The bionic eye system described
in the article is said to be dramatical
ly restorative, unlike corrective laser
surgery, and it could potentially ben
efit people suffering from degenera
tive retinal diseases, particularly
muscular deterioration that occurs
with age.
Patients whose photoreceptor
cells degenerate become increas
ingly blind. On his Web site, article

co-author Daniel Palanker, an as
sistant professor of ophthalmology,
wrote that although photorecep
tors can be destroyed, "many of the
retinal neurons that transmit sig
nals from the photoreceptors are
preserved fora prolonged period of
time."
The bionic eye theoretically re
stores lost sight by sidestepping de
funct photoreceptors and stimulat
ing these neurons on the inner reti
na.
The group of researchers began
working on the concept four years
ago and is currently developing the
actual practical machinery, Palanker
said in an interview.
According to the article, the key
component of the system is a light
sensitive chip, which would be im
planted into a patient's eye. The chip
picks up light signals and transmits
them to neurons in the retina, where
the remaining healthy portion of the
eye will naturally process the impuls
es.
Palanker said that information is
exchanged between the chip and
other elements of the bionic eye, in
cluding a tiny camera, a compact
portable computer and infrared
video goggles.
Because the material costs of the
invention are insignificant.

Palanker said he anticipates that
"the prosthesis itself will not be
much more expensive than a
cochlear implant [a device that en
hances hearingj, which is covered
by medical insurances."
The idea for the retinal implant
was pioneered in 1988 by John
Wyatt, professor of electrical engi
neering and computer science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy, and Joseph Rizzo, associate
professor of ophthalmology at Stan
ford.
Currently, there are several other
groups in the United States, Ger
many and Japan conducting similar
research. In fact, the Stanford team
collaborates regularly with re
searchers at Harvard, the University
of Southern California and Rizzo's
project at MIT, said Mark Blu
menkranz, chair of Stanford's Oph
thalmology Department.
The Stanford bionic eye research
is distinguished because of the
group's progress with alternative
pathways to neurons in the retina,
and also because its goal is to create
a very sensitive and accurate pros
thesis.
"Our goal is to develop what we
consider a high resolution product
that would allow the patient to
read," Blumenkranz said.

Because the number of elec
trodes included on the device is di
rectly correlated to the resolution,
Stanford researchers knew they
needed to find a way to place as
many electrodes near to the neurons
as possible without damaging the
retina, and they did.
Stacey Bent, associate professor
chemical engineering and a member
of the project, said Stanford's re
search is different also in its use of a
chemical chip that uses neurotrans
mitters to stimulate neurons.
"There are only a couple of
groups to my knowledge taking this
chemical approach," she said. "Most
others are working on an electrical
chip using electrical current to stim
ulate the neurons."
However, development of this
chemical chip is still in the prelimi
nary stages, Blumenkranz said,
adding that "this approach is more
sophisticated by closer to a physio
logical process."
The public, he said, is more likely
to see the electronic version of a
bionic eye sooner, a prototype of
which will be tested on animals later
this year. Human testing will likely
commence within another two years,
and the first device suitable for clini
cal use could be available within five
to 10 years.
