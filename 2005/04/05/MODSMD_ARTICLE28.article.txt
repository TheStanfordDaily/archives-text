## Soto Tape Chronicles Wiffle ball: A glove story 
### 
Let me tell you something about me. 1 don't
shop. 111 had a choice between spending a
day at the mall and doing anything else,
"anything else" would win unless it involved root
ing for Ohio State. That said, on Sunday I learned
that I should never be let lwse in a sporting goods
store without a leash, muzzle, straightjacket and
one of those electric dog collars for good mea
sure.
I drove down to Big 5 on El Camino with a
steely resolve to buy nothing but a Frisbee to re
place the one I lost in the gutter by the Chemical
Engineering Gazebo last fall. I don't know if it
was the extra spring in my step from winning Bat
tle of the Bands the night before or the dorm re
imbursement check weighing in my pocket, but
my iron will crumbled as soon as I walked through

the door.
By the time I escaped to the
parking lot I had relieved the
store of a good portion of its
spring inventory. The capstone
of my spree is a dark brown
Wilson fielder's mitt with black
cowhide lacing, a deep pocket
and a rich smell of new leather.
It's a bit stiff, but has potential.
1 had to replace my old

glove because it has an irreparable tear where the
lacing of the webbing ripped through the leather
of the thumb. My old glove, which I got in first
grade, was never oiled or pampered, but hours of
playing catch molded it softly into the shape of my
hand. The heel of the glove reaches midway down
my palm and the pocket is worn nearly white.
The personal touches are still there too, chron
icling the stages of my life. It has "ANA" written
on the pinky in permanent marker because it
used to be my sister's glove. I borrowed it one
winter when I was too scared to go down to the
dark basement to get my own, and never gave it
back.
Pedro Guerrero's signature is stamped into
the Snap-Action pocket, and though I never saw
the third baseman play, he was often the protago
nist of my baseball fantasies.
The glove came with me to old Tiger Stadium
on the corner of Michigan and Trumbull, where
Dad would point out Alan Trammell and Lou
Whitaker and show me how they effortlessly
turned double plays. We would go twice a year
and sit down the first base line, and every time
Cecil Fielder came up to the plate I would put
down my hot dog and slip on my glove in hopes of
catching a foul ball.
In middle school, the glove came with me to
Three Rivers Stadium as the Pirates bumbled
around the ugly concrete bowl with the football
endzone showing beneath the infield turf. The
glove skipped school with me on April 9,2(X)1, to
go to the first game ever at PNC Park, where I wit
nessed the Pirates start another nouveau-retro
era of futility. And freshman year 1 clutched the
glove tightly as I sat glued to the TV screen watch
ing the Giants throw away their best shot at a
World Series.
My glove survived sweat, dirt, grass stains, i ain
and those IM Softball grapefruits before finally
calling it quits. The new glove has a lot of living to
do before it can secure a space in my heart.
But it is early April, baseball season has start
ed, hope is in the air and it is time to move on with
my life. To help my grieving process, a few good
friends took me down to White Plaza Saturday af
ternoon for an inaugural game of Wiffie Claw-
Ball.
For those of you who have never played, the
rules are simple. Teams are made up of one per-


Jordi Mata-Fink
son and an infinite number of ghost
runners. The pitcher stands behind
the fountain to protect from line
drives up the middle. The batter can
swing at as many pitches as he or she
wants to, but once the fielders deem
the batter to suffer from obscenely
poor hand-eye coordination, a strike
out rule comes into play. The bases
are the four sides of the fountain, and
the water is meant to slow the runner
to allow fielders to chase after the
ball. Excessive splashing is strongly
encouraged.
I wish I could say that, in a farewell
salute to my Pedro Guerrero mitt, I
dominated the competition and won
the championship of Wiffle Claw-Ball.
Unfortunately, after a line drive to the
face courtesy of my girlfriend, I
couldn't pick up the rotation of the
pitches and only managed four runs in
two innings: good for last place. I
couldn't even beat the Brazilian who
rationalized every fielding error with
"I'm from Brazil and my favorite soc
cer player is Maradona! What is this
'Wiffeelee ball'?"
I'm not totally crushed. There will
be more chances for Wiffle ball re
demption, and I might one day make
Pedro Guerrero proud. Until then,
though, my old mitt will go back into
the box of sports stuff with the scuffed
fcx>tball and cracked cleats. It's time to
start a new era.
