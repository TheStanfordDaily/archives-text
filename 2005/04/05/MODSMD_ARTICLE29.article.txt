# Women's tennis drops ASU, UA
## No. 1 Card continues Pac-10 roll 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
It was almost as if time stood still as Stanford's top
doubles team of junior Alice Barnes and senior Erin
Burdette (18-6, 4-4 Pacific 10 Conference) pushed
their way to an 8-all tiebreak on Friday against No. 33
Arizona State (7-7, 3-5).
Arizona State's Lauren Colalillo had served her
way through eight deuces to go up 7-6 with partner
Kady Pooler (12-8, 2-6).
That's right, eight deuces, giving the No. 1 Stanford
team enough time to take the advantage five times to
the Sun Devils' three, but not enough time to allow ei
ther team to express just how strongly they wanted the
match.
With the tentative balance of power already tipped
in the Cardinal's favor, 1-0, Burdette held her own
serve to finally force the 12-point decision, setting in
motion the host of events that propelled the Cardinal
to a 7-0 victory over the Sun Devils.
The No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team (17-0,9-0)
held fast at Taube Family Tennis Stadium through Sat
urday, downing Arizona (6-9, 0-7), 6-1.
"We've been struggling a little bit in the doubles,"
Barnes said. "It was nice to win a tight one finally, be
cause it's just that much harder to refocus in the singles
if you don't."
Barnes faced a weathered Sabrina Capannolo in
singles, moving up to the No. 1 singles slot after No. 14
Amber Liu. a junior, decided to sit out the match be
cause of illness. Coming off the nail-biting doubles de
cision, Barnes proved unstoppable as she served out a
6-0 first set against the No. 89 Arizona State sopho
more.
Barnes had two aces in the second set as she closed
out the match, 6-2.
Capannolo had fought valiantly in a No. 55 pairing
with Jessica Leitch at No. 2 doubles against No. 38
Anne Yelsey and Liu, dropping a 8-6 decision. Togeth
er, the Wildcat duo incited an air of frenzy in their op
ponents, causing Liu and Yelsey to clash their rackets
in a mad dash for the ball.
While "nothing but net" might be used to describe a
perfect shot in basketball, it could also describe how
Capannolo lost her groundstroke timing and sacrificed
several games Friday. Cappanolo's lanky, 5-foot-9
frame now worked against her as she seemed to forget
