# Women's tennis drops ASU, UA
## No. 1 Card continues Pac-10 roll 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
It was almost as if time stood still as Stanford's top
doubles team of junior Alice Barnes and senior Erin
Burdette (18-6, 4-4 Pacific 10 Conference) pushed
their way to an 8-all tiebreak on Friday against No. 33
Arizona State (7-7, 3-5).
Arizona State's Lauren Colalillo had served her
way through eight deuces to go up 7-6 with partner
Kady Pooler (12-8, 2-6).
That's right, eight deuces, giving the No. 1 Stanford
team enough time to take the advantage five times to
the Sun Devils' three, but not enough time to allow ei
ther team to express just how strongly they wanted the
match.
With the tentative balance of power already tipped
in the Cardinal's favor, 1-0, Burdette held her own
serve to finally force the 12-point decision, setting in
motion the host of events that propelled the Cardinal
to a 7-0 victory over the Sun Devils.
The No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team (17-0,9-0)
held fast at Taube Family Tennis Stadium through Sat
urday, downing Arizona (6-9, 0-7), 6-1.
"We've been struggling a little bit in the doubles,"
Barnes said. "It was nice to win a tight one finally, be
cause it's just that much harder to refocus in the singles
if you don't."
Barnes faced a weathered Sabrina Capannolo in
singles, moving up to the No. 1 singles slot after No. 14
Amber Liu. a junior, decided to sit out the match be
cause of illness. Coming off the nail-biting doubles de
cision, Barnes proved unstoppable as she served out a
6-0 first set against the No. 89 Arizona State sopho
more.
Barnes had two aces in the second set as she closed
out the match, 6-2.
Capannolo had fought valiantly in a No. 55 pairing
with Jessica Leitch at No. 2 doubles against No. 38
Anne Yelsey and Liu, dropping a 8-6 decision. Togeth
er, the Wildcat duo incited an air of frenzy in their op
ponents, causing Liu and Yelsey to clash their rackets
in a mad dash for the ball.
While "nothing but net" might be used to describe a
perfect shot in basketball, it could also describe how
Capannolo lost her groundstroke timing and sacrificed
several games Friday. Cappanolo's lanky, 5-foot-9
frame now worked against her as she seemed to forget

Freshman standout Whitney Deason picked up two singles victories as well as two doubles wins with freshman partner Lejla
Hodzic as Stanford defeated both Arizona and Arizona State.
that extensive court coverage must
be accompanied by getting down
for Barnes' low-slung, sliced re
turns.
With Barnes dictating play, Ca
pannolo (13-15, 1-7) was resigned
to continuing her disappointing
singles match play record from last
month. Since March, Cappanolo
has dropped six of seven confer
ence contests.
"I think Sabrina likes to play a
hard-hit, true kind of hall, but 1 like
to mix things up a bit and hit some
slices and other junk balls," Barnes
said. "Perhaps from the start, she
knew it wasn't going to be such a
good matchup for her. 1 think she
played better when we played the
away match. 1 did expect her to be
a little bit more aggressive."
Cappanolo notched three more
games last month against Liu. who
is renowned for her unforgiving
brand of baseline drives.
After suffering her first loss of
the season to Cal powerhouse
Suzanne Babos last Wednesday,
Liu (13-1, 7-1) made a quick
turnaround on Saturday, cruising
to an 8-1 doubles victory with
Yelsey over Kasia Jakowlew and
Jessie Rochefort.
Heading the singles lineup once
again, Liu got the best of No. 37 Di
anne Hollands (21-15, 3-5 Pac-10),
recovering from a service break at
4-all in the first set to pull out a 7-5,
6-1 win.
"I went out there and just tried

to play my game, work on some
shots, and keep a positive attitude
[despite] the fact that 1 wasn't at
100 percent," Liu said. "I think in
the beginning of the first set, I was
getting frustrated and missing
more than I do, hut I won a couple
of crucial games, and was able to
roll with that in second set."
Hollands lost the aggressiveness
and deft net plays she had carried
over from her doubles match,
where she and Maja Mlakar (20-9,
6-2) defied Barnes and Burdette
for the second time this season, 8-5.
"This Saturday I served a lot
better than I did on Wednesday,"
Liu said. "I want to work on that so
1 always get a good start to the
point, and I want to see that pay off
in the (upcoming matches] this
week."
Meanwhile, the Cardinal moved
in perfect unison to close out
matches at Nos. 4-6 singles against
Arizona. Twenty minutes into the
singles contest, freshman Whitney
Deason, sophomore Theresa
Logar and sophomore Yelsey had
all notched five games and allowed
their opponents none.
No. 38 Logar improved to 21-2
for the season as she trounced
Camelia Todorova, 6-0, 6-1.
With an identical score over
Kasia Jakowlew, No. 84 Yelsey im
proved to 18-5.
No. 45 Deason (24-3) continued
her undefeated streak in the Pac
-10, also conceding only a single
game to Jakowlew.
To cap a weekend of Cardinal
glory, two seniors. No. 16 Erin Bur
dette and walk-on Kara Guzman,
were honored for their final career
conference match at home.
