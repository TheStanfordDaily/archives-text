## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
()n Saturday, the NT, > 16 Stanford men's tennis team lost
two of three double > matches and consequently the dou
bles point to Arizona. Winless in six previous matches
after losing that crucial first point, Stanford appeared
headed for another loss.
This time, however, the Cardinal (11-7, 3-1 Pacific-10
Conference) turned it around and grabbed the four sin
gles matches it needed to claim the victory over the Wild
cats.
"Our history is we lose the doubles point, we lose the
match," head coach John Whitlinger said. "We have yet
to [do otherwise). I didn't really mention [this), but the
guys knew it at 'halltime.' It was nice to see our guys re
spond to the challenge because Arizona has always been
a difficult place to play. They're tough there, they have

the crowd and they battle hard. They're a tough team,
and we rose to the challenge to win four singles matches."
In Tucson, Stanford began play with an 8-5 win from
the No. 3 ranked pair of senior Sam Warburg and junior
KC Corkery. The defending NCAA champions defeated
the No. 15 duo of Roger Matalonga and Colin O'Grady.
The top Wildcat pair has been on a tear of late, upsetting
Cal's No. 11 pair last weekend as well as UCLA and
Southern California's top teams in recent matches.
"Arizona came out and they were on a high [since)
they beat Cal the day before," Whitlinger said. "They
played some good doubles."
The other Cardinal pairs enjoyed less success, as the
second and third doubles spots were both handed 8-5 de
feats. The second doubles tandem featured a new face as
senior Phil Sheng paired up with junior Jon Wong. Sheng
has gone through a number of doubles partners this sea
son. including sophomores Eric McKean and James Wan,

who formed the third doubles pair Saturday, and fresh
man Phil Kao. Both doubles pairs were broken early in
the match and had multiple opportunities to break back
in the last games but could not convert.
Despite defeat, Sheng said he was satisfied with how
he and Wong played.
"[Against Arizona], we had a few unlucky games in
that match," Sheng said, "but overall, we played really
well. [Our team is] struggling [with doubles]. It's proba
bly one of the weaker parts of our game right now, but
we're working on it and trying new things out and seeing
how that goes."
However, as singles play commenced, the Cardinal
lineup proved especially tough as the top four singles po
sitions snagged wins to complete the 4-3 defeat of Ari
zona. No. 33 Corkery was the first Cardinal to tally a win.
defeating No. 47 Matalonga at the
second singles position, 6-4, 6-2.
Warburg then followed his doubles
partner's suit and defeated
O'Grady, 6-4, 6-4. At No. 3 singles.
Sheng rebounded from the previ
ous day's loss to win, 7-6, 6-1.
"(Saturday's match] was the
first match I'd won in awhile,"
Sheng said. "It was good to get back
and hopefully start a good winning
streak. I haven't been playing that
well lately, but I'm feeling confi
dent — I played well [against Ari
zona]."
Arizona responded with a 6-1,7-

6 defeat of Kao at the final singles
position, but Wan clinched the win
for Stanford with a 7-5, 6-3 victory.
Stretched to three sets, McKean
could not maintain the momentum
after winning the second set and
lost 7-6. 3-6, 6-3.
While Saturday's match went
down to the wire, Friday's 6-1 win
against Arizona State was compar
atively easier. The Cardinal swept
all of their doubles matches to
claim the first point, and the first
and third doubles spots both
snagged 8-5 victories.
As McKean and Wan have
played more matches together, the
duo is becoming more comfortable
with each other.
"There were some tough condi
tions out there," McKean said,
"[the heat] and the altitude; it was

an adjustment. But we played pret
ty well the whole weekend, and I
was content with how we did."
Sheng and Wong walked away
with a narrow 9-7 victory in their
first match as partners at the sec
ond doubles position.
Whitlinger said he was pleased
with the new pair.
"We weren't having a lot of suc
cess [at the second doubles posi
tion] so we had to do something,"
he said. "I thought they did a good
job. I thought Jon played great, and
they worked together well, so we'll
see how this one works."
Again. Corkery's was the first
singles match to be completed, fin
ishing with a score identical to Sat
urday's. The Sun Devils picked up
their first and only win at the
fourth singles position, where

Sheng was defeated in straight
sets. No. 2 Warburg and Kao only
needed two sets to claim their
wins, while Wan and McKean split
their first two sets. Both played
super-tiebreakers for the third
sets, and the partners proved vic
torious in the end.
McKean evaluated his perfor
mance in three set matches this sea
son as he has often been stretched
to the third set.
"I actually really enjoy super
tiebreakers when everything's on
the line - they're really intense."
"We're happy to come out of
Arizona with two wins whatever
way we can get them." Whitlinger
said. "It's a tough trip but the guys
did well, and I'll take anything I can
get. I think we're all pleased with
the wins."

Warburg then followed his doubles
partner's suit and defeated
O'Grady, 6-4, 6-4. At No. 3 singles.
Sheng rebounded from the previ
ous day's loss to win, 7-6, 6-1.
"(Saturday's match] was the
first match I'd won in awhile,"
Sheng said. "It was good to get back
and hopefully start a good winning
streak. I haven't been playing that
well lately, but I'm feeling confi
dent — I played well [against Ari
zona]."
Arizona responded with a 6-1,7-

6 defeat of Kao at the final singles
position, but Wan clinched the win
for Stanford with a 7-5, 6-3 victory.
Stretched to three sets, McKean
could not maintain the momentum
after winning the second set and
lost 7-6. 3-6, 6-3.
While Saturday's match went
down to the wire, Friday's 6-1 win
against Arizona State was compar
atively easier. The Cardinal swept
all of their doubles matches to
claim the first point, and the first
and third doubles spots both
snagged 8-5 victories.
As McKean and Wan have
played more matches together, the
duo is becoming more comfortable
with each other.
"There were some tough condi
tions out there," McKean said,
"[the heat] and the altitude; it was

an adjustment. But we played pret
ty well the whole weekend, and I
was content with how we did."
Sheng and Wong walked away
with a narrow 9-7 victory in their
first match as partners at the sec
ond doubles position.
Whitlinger said he was pleased
with the new pair.
"We weren't having a lot of suc
cess [at the second doubles posi
tion] so we had to do something,"
he said. "I thought they did a good
job. I thought Jon played great, and
they worked together well, so we'll
see how this one works."
Again. Corkery's was the first
singles match to be completed, fin
ishing with a score identical to Sat
urday's. The Sun Devils picked up
their first and only win at the
fourth singles position, where

Sheng was defeated in straight
sets. No. 2 Warburg and Kao only
needed two sets to claim their
wins, while Wan and McKean split
their first two sets. Both played
super-tiebreakers for the third
sets, and the partners proved vic
torious in the end.
McKean evaluated his perfor
mance in three set matches this sea
son as he has often been stretched
to the third set.
"I actually really enjoy super
tiebreakers when everything's on
the line - they're really intense."
"We're happy to come out of
Arizona with two wins whatever
way we can get them." Whitlinger
said. "It's a tough trip but the guys
did well, and I'll take anything I can
get. I think we're all pleased with
the wins."
