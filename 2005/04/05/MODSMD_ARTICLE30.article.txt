### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
()n Saturday, the NT, > 16 Stanford men's tennis team lost
two of three double > matches and consequently the dou
bles point to Arizona. Winless in six previous matches
after losing that crucial first point, Stanford appeared
headed for another loss.
This time, however, the Cardinal (11-7, 3-1 Pacific-10
Conference) turned it around and grabbed the four sin
gles matches it needed to claim the victory over the Wild
cats.
"Our history is we lose the doubles point, we lose the
match," head coach John Whitlinger said. "We have yet
to [do otherwise). I didn't really mention [this), but the
guys knew it at 'halltime.' It was nice to see our guys re
spond to the challenge because Arizona has always been
a difficult place to play. They're tough there, they have

the crowd and they battle hard. They're a tough team,
and we rose to the challenge to win four singles matches."
In Tucson, Stanford began play with an 8-5 win from
the No. 3 ranked pair of senior Sam Warburg and junior
KC Corkery. The defending NCAA champions defeated
the No. 15 duo of Roger Matalonga and Colin O'Grady.
The top Wildcat pair has been on a tear of late, upsetting
Cal's No. 11 pair last weekend as well as UCLA and
Southern California's top teams in recent matches.
"Arizona came out and they were on a high [since)
they beat Cal the day before," Whitlinger said. "They
played some good doubles."
The other Cardinal pairs enjoyed less success, as the
second and third doubles spots were both handed 8-5 de
feats. The second doubles tandem featured a new face as
senior Phil Sheng paired up with junior Jon Wong. Sheng
has gone through a number of doubles partners this sea
son. including sophomores Eric McKean and James Wan,

who formed the third doubles pair Saturday, and fresh
man Phil Kao. Both doubles pairs were broken early in
the match and had multiple opportunities to break back
in the last games but could not convert.
Despite defeat, Sheng said he was satisfied with how
he and Wong played.
"[Against Arizona], we had a few unlucky games in
that match," Sheng said, "but overall, we played really
well. [Our team is] struggling [with doubles]. It's proba
bly one of the weaker parts of our game right now, but
we're working on it and trying new things out and seeing
how that goes."
However, as singles play commenced, the Cardinal
lineup proved especially tough as the top four singles po
sitions snagged wins to complete the 4-3 defeat of Ari
zona. No. 33 Corkery was the first Cardinal to tally a win.
