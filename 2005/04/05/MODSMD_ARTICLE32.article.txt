# Pole vaulters excel at Berkeley
## 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Six members of the Stanford
track and field team competed at
Berkeley and one other athlete trav
eled to Arlington, Tex., as part of a
quiet but successful Saturday.
The conditions at Berkeley were
perfect for pole vaulting and Stan
ford's entrants at the Johnny Mathis
Invitational took advantage to
sweep the men's and women's com
petition.
Freshmen Benjamin Dickens and
Anna McFarlane won the men's and
women's pole vaulting event, respec
tively, as McFarlane vaulted an out
door personal best 12'5.5", which is
also a regional qualifying mark.
"That was a huge turnaround for
her," head women's coach Edrick
Floreal said. "She did not compete
very much in indoor to give herself a
break before outdoor."
Dickens vaulted 16'3.25", close to
the 16'6.75" qualifying mark.
At the Arlington Invitational, ju
nior Michael Robertson won the dis
cus event, his specialty, with a throw
of 192'-3". Robertson finished third

in the discus last year at the 2(X)4
NCAA Championships and threw
the fourth-best mark in Stanford his
tory last week at the Stanford Invita
tional.
"It was a standard performance
for Michael," head men's coach
Robert Weir said. "Conditions were
not favorable. Michael is one of the
top throwers in the conference. The
real job is getting him ready to do
well at Regionals."
The rest of the track team got a
needed break this weekend in prepa
ration for the upcoming week, which
includes three meets all over the
country.
Floreal. who doubles as the sprint
and jump coach, will take a contin
gent of sprinters, hurdlers and
jumpers to Austin, Tex., for the
Texas Relays.
Weir, also the throwing coach,
will travel to Los Angeles with the
rest of the men's team and the throw
ers. There, the UCLA Bruins will
host the Rafer Johnson / Jackie
Joyner-Kersee Invitational, named
after the two world-famous UCLA
alumni.
The rest of the athletes and most

of the middle-distance women will
make the drive to Berkeley for the
Brutus Hamilton Invitational, where
the middle-distance competition
should heat up.
"They will all be quality meets for
the people going," Floreal said. "The
Rafer Johnson should be very good
in the throws area and the men's
middle distance events."
With the team splitting up in
three directions, logistics were diffi
cult to sort out, but the athletes
should be aided by competing at
meets suited to their events.
Based on the caliber of athletes
going anil the meet conditions, the
coaches decide which meets might
produce the best results for the vari
ous outdoor events.
The athletes are used to going
separate ways, and will come togeth
er as a complete team for the Con
ference and Regional meets.
As for this weekend, all three of
the meets should be exciting.
"We are coming into our third
week now for outdoor track," Weir
said. "We are transitioning from
training mode, from indoor mode,
into competition in outdoor."
