# Crew excels in San Diego

### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was a big weekend for Stanford
crew at the 32nd annual San Diego
Crew Classic. All three Stanford
squads put forth inspired perfor
mances over the course of the regatta's
two days of competition.
But it would be difficult to decide
which pertbnnance was the most im
pressive of the three. Was it the nine
second victory posted by the
lightweight women to take the A. W.
Coggeshall Cup? Or perhaps it was
that of the No. 13 women's squad,
which recorded top-three finishes in its
two Sunday finals'? Or was it the No. 1 4
men's team's incredible upset of No. 2
Cal in its Saturday afternoon matchup?
No matter how you kx)k at it, it is
unmistakably clear that the three Stan
ford crew teams are off to a flying start
as they begin their pursuits of their re
spective end-of-the-year titles.
Stanford's weekend began dramat
ically with the first heat of the Copley
Cup. The Cardinal men were slated to
start next to six-time Copley Cup
champion Cal in an event that ulti
mately turned into a two-boat race.
Within the first S(X) meters, the Car
dinal recovered from an early deficit to
stroke their way to a slight lead over the
Bears. The Cal men managed to make
up a few inches over the next 500 me
ters, and the two boats passed the half
way mark separated by less than half a
second. But the Cardinal tcx)k control
in the last 1 ,(XK) meters to finish more
than two seconds ahead of the defend
ing champion's boat.
It was an effort that made a loud
statement to the rest of the Cardinal's
competition and that drew praise even
from their rival's coach.
"Stanford tix>k the race from the
first stroke, and every time we tried to
make a move, Stanford had the
strength and the will to counter it," Cal
head coach Steve Gladstone said.
"That race was not a fluke."
Though unable to pull off a repeat
upset in the Sunday afternoon Copley

Cup Final, the Cardinal posted a strong
performance, finishing in second-place
only 1.5 seconds off the pace of the Cal
boat.
What makes the Cardinal men's
performance even more impressive
and encouraging is the rarity of such
close competition between two crews
ranked so far apart in the polls. And not
only did the Cardinal compete with the
No. 2 squad in the nation, but they also
defeated No. 5 Navy and No. 8 Penn
sylvania in the process.
The Cardinal men look to build on
that momentum this weekend at the
Windermere Collegiate Classic at
Redwotxi Shores, Calif.
"We're excited and looking for
ward to representing Stanford and
Stanford crew the way we're accus
tomed to," men's coach Craig
Amerkhanian said. "The Windermere
regatta is going to feature some of the
top crews in the country, so it'll be a
great opportunity for learning and will
let as know where we stand."
The women's lightweight squad
was the only one of the three Stanford
teams to actually capture a title at the
San Diego Crew Classic, and it did it in
dominating fashion.
The lightweight boat took its Satur
day morning heat handily, building a
seven-second lead within the first 1 ,(XX)
meters of the race. The San Diego State
boat made a charge late in the race, but
the Cardinal lightweights had more
than enough left to put the race away.
Moreover, in doing so they also
showed their ability to perform in close
contests. In races earlier this season, the
outcomes of the Cardinal lightweights'
races were often decided at an early
stage, something about which head
coach Al Acosta was mildly concerned
heading down to San Diego. But the
lightweight boat's performance over
the weekend dispelled any such con
cerns.
In the A. W. Coggeshall Cup Final
event, the Cardinal lightweights again
pulled away to an early lead and never
looked back. They finished the two
kilometer course in 7:08.10, nearly 10

seconds faster than the second-place
UC-Santa Barbara boat.
"We've progressed well," Acosta
said. "We still have a ton of stuff to
work on. but the foundation fora real
ly gtxxl season is there. The varsity
eight Ls better than we've had in the last
three years. We were looking forward
to putting it all together this weekend,
and it was great to improve on last
year's finish."
Rounding out Stanford crew's stel
lar weekend in San Diego was the
women's squad, which garnered a sec
ond-place and a third-place finish in
Sunday's competition. Entering their
final events the women's first and sec
ond varsity boats were still riding the
momentum of their Saturday perfor
mances, in which each boat led its re
spective heat from start to finish. In
doing so, the second varsity eight
earned a spot in the Junior Varsity
Eight Final event, and the first varsity
eight was placed in the Jessep-Whittier
Cup Final event.
In the Junior Varsity Eight Final,
the members of the women's second
varsity boat found themselves in the
last position as they passed the 1,000-
meter mark midway down the course.
Refusing to give up. they used the next
500 meters to move past the UCLA
boat, then rallied over the final stretch
of the race to pick up two more spots
and claim third place.
The women's first varsity eight boat
took notice and pulled off a similar
comeback of their own less than an
hour later in the Jessep-Whittier final.
Despite dropping to fourth within the
opening 500 meters, the first varsity
pushed toovertake the boats of UCLA
and then Southern California en route
to a solid second place finish.
"We are encouraged by these early
season results, but we are hungry for
more and are working hard to put our
selves at the top of the Pac-10," senior
cox Kelly Garneski said.

The No. 18 Stanford women's crew team earned a second-place and a third-place finish over the weekend at
the Jessep-Whittier Cup, mounting an impressive comeback in its final race.
It was a big weekend for Stanford
crew at the 32nd annual San Diego
Crew Classic. All three Stanford
squads put forth inspired perfor
mances over the course of the regatta's
two days of competition.
But it would be difficult to decide
which pertbnnance was the most im
pressive of the three. Was it the nine
second victory posted by the
lightweight women to take the A. W.
Coggeshall Cup? Or perhaps it was
that of the No. 13 women's squad,
which recorded top-three finishes in its
two Sunday finals'? Or was it the No. 1 4
men's team's incredible upset of No. 2
Cal in its Saturday afternoon matchup?
No matter how you kx)k at it, it is
unmistakably clear that the three Stan
ford crew teams are off to a flying start
as they begin their pursuits of their re
spective end-of-the-year titles.
Stanford's weekend began dramat
ically with the first heat of the Copley
Cup. The Cardinal men were slated to
start next to six-time Copley Cup
champion Cal in an event that ulti
mately turned into a two-boat race.
Within the first S(X) meters, the Car
dinal recovered from an early deficit to
stroke their way to a slight lead over the
Bears. The Cal men managed to make
up a few inches over the next 500 me
ters, and the two boats passed the half
way mark separated by less than half a
second. But the Cardinal tcx)k control
in the last 1 ,(XK) meters to finish more
than two seconds ahead of the defend
ing champion's boat.
It was an effort that made a loud
statement to the rest of the Cardinal's
competition and that drew praise even
from their rival's coach.
"Stanford tix>k the race from the
first stroke, and every time we tried to
make a move, Stanford had the
strength and the will to counter it," Cal
head coach Steve Gladstone said.
"That race was not a fluke."
Though unable to pull off a repeat
upset in the Sunday afternoon Copley

Cup Final, the Cardinal posted a strong
performance, finishing in second-place
only 1.5 seconds off the pace of the Cal
boat.
What makes the Cardinal men's
performance even more impressive
and encouraging is the rarity of such
close competition between two crews
ranked so far apart in the polls. And not
only did the Cardinal compete with the
No. 2 squad in the nation, but they also
defeated No. 5 Navy and No. 8 Penn
sylvania in the process.
The Cardinal men look to build on
that momentum this weekend at the
Windermere Collegiate Classic at
Redwotxi Shores, Calif.
"We're excited and looking for
ward to representing Stanford and
Stanford crew the way we're accus
tomed to," men's coach Craig
Amerkhanian said. "The Windermere
regatta is going to feature some of the
top crews in the country, so it'll be a
great opportunity for learning and will
let as know where we stand."
The women's lightweight squad
was the only one of the three Stanford
teams to actually capture a title at the
San Diego Crew Classic, and it did it in
dominating fashion.
The lightweight boat took its Satur
day morning heat handily, building a
seven-second lead within the first 1 ,(XX)
meters of the race. The San Diego State
boat made a charge late in the race, but
the Cardinal lightweights had more
than enough left to put the race away.
Moreover, in doing so they also
showed their ability to perform in close
contests. In races earlier this season, the
outcomes of the Cardinal lightweights'
races were often decided at an early
stage, something about which head
coach Al Acosta was mildly concerned
heading down to San Diego. But the
lightweight boat's performance over
the weekend dispelled any such con
cerns.
In the A. W. Coggeshall Cup Final
event, the Cardinal lightweights again
pulled away to an early lead and never
looked back. They finished the two
kilometer course in 7:08.10, nearly 10

seconds faster than the second-place
UC-Santa Barbara boat.
"We've progressed well," Acosta
said. "We still have a ton of stuff to
work on. but the foundation fora real
ly gtxxl season is there. The varsity
eight Ls better than we've had in the last
three years. We were looking forward
to putting it all together this weekend,
and it was great to improve on last
year's finish."
Rounding out Stanford crew's stel
lar weekend in San Diego was the
women's squad, which garnered a sec
ond-place and a third-place finish in
Sunday's competition. Entering their
final events the women's first and sec
ond varsity boats were still riding the
momentum of their Saturday perfor
mances, in which each boat led its re
spective heat from start to finish. In
doing so, the second varsity eight
earned a spot in the Junior Varsity
Eight Final event, and the first varsity
eight was placed in the Jessep-Whittier
Cup Final event.
In the Junior Varsity Eight Final,
the members of the women's second
varsity boat found themselves in the
last position as they passed the 1,000-
meter mark midway down the course.
Refusing to give up. they used the next
500 meters to move past the UCLA
boat, then rallied over the final stretch
of the race to pick up two more spots
and claim third place.
The women's first varsity eight boat
took notice and pulled off a similar
comeback of their own less than an
hour later in the Jessep-Whittier final.
Despite dropping to fourth within the
opening 500 meters, the first varsity
pushed toovertake the boats of UCLA
and then Southern California en route
to a solid second place finish.
"We are encouraged by these early
season results, but we are hungry for
more and are working hard to put our
selves at the top of the Pac-10," senior
cox Kelly Garneski said.
