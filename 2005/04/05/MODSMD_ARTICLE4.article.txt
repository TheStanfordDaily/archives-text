# Medical students' proposal could become state law
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After reviewing 129 submissions, local Califor
nia State Senator Joe Simitian (D-l Ith District) an
nounced on Mar. 31 five winners of the annual
"There Oughta Be A Law" contest, including a
team of five first-year Stanford medical students.
The contest, spearheaded by Simitian. asked Cali
fornians to send in ideas that they want to see be

come state laws.
The Stanford team's winning concept, according
to a press release from Simitian's office, was to es
tablish a program that "would allow pharmacies to
distribute previously sold, unexpired and unopened
prescription drugs to patients, especially those with
low income or severe disabilities."
The Stanford team will testify in front of a meet
ing of the state's health legislative committee in
Sacramento on April 27.

"This is a district full of smart, caring and en
gaged folks," Simitian said. "And Stanford, of
course, is a particularly forward-thinking communi
ty. When I read the med students' proposal, it im
mediately impressed me as an innovative approach
to the high cost of prescription medicines."
Last fall, in a course entitled "Practice of Medi
cine," the team, consisting of Emily Chang. Michael
Mancuso, Josemaria Paterno, Joe Per
aza and Shila Ravi, agreed to collabo
rate on the medication waste project
idea that Paterno originally proposed.
"As someone who is soon to join a
profession where cost, efficiency and
access to care are defining issues of
today's health system, I would feel
very comforted to know that some
people who often have to choose be
tween food and prescription drugs
could be helped by this program," Pa
terno said, adding that he had known
of international medication redistrib
ution programs that export unused
HIV drugs from the United States.

"The logical extension of those in
ternational programs is that valuable,
expensive, unused drugs are needed
by patients here," he said. "It makes
sense to try to establish some sort of
domestic program for American pa
tients. In the United States, unused
medication waste means hundreds of
millions of dollars of potential savings
and many potentially saved lives."
Paterno emphasized that the med
ications given to the indigent and poor
in the proposed program are not to be
inferior, used or recycled.
"Although medication redistribu
tion may seem like a risky idea, new
technologies, packaging advances,
proper protocols and safety inspec
tions can make it reasonably safe or at
least safer than no medicine at all for
whole groups of people," he said.
Since pharmacies can recover han

dling and inspection costs with a min
imal handling fee for recipients when
they redistribute the drugs, the cost of
the program to the state should be
close to nothing, Paterno said.
"The program is revenue-neutral
and self-sustaining," Paterno added.
"Medicines would not have to be re
manufactured, just verified. Many
tablets or capsules already are pack
aged individually in tamper-proof
wrappings with the name and date of
expiration stamped on each one."
After conducting preliminary re
search, Paterno said he recognized
that "the only way to get this program
done would be through establishing a
state law to permit medication redis
tribution to provide liability protec
tion for participating pharmacies."
During winter quarter, the team of
students worked with Simitian's staff

to plan a sustainable, efficient and safe
program.
"We had to review issues such as
the legal language, the distribution
model and the formulary," Paterno
said.
Rei Onishi. a senior staff member
in Simitian's office, told Paterno that
if the law gets through committee
there's a good chance it will pass.
"If passed, our proposal would
show that even a small group of stu
dents can accomplish great strides for
those in need," Peraza said. "I hope it
provides underserved populations
with continued attention, support and
representation."
Chang said the proposed bill could
be a practical way to combat what she
sees as a disturbing injustice.
"With proper medications, educa
tion and management, the morbidity

and mortality associated with diseases
such as heart disease and diabetes
could be alleviated or avoided," she
said. "However, the cost of prescrip
tion drugs is so prohibitively high that
without insurance or a six-digit in
come, few can afford to pay for them
over the course of months or years."
Chang added that although the
proposed bill is not a permanent solu
tion to this problem, it would provide
help to those who need it the most as
soon as possible.
In developing the proposal, Pater
no said the team also collaborated
with relevant professionals across the
nation, namely Linda Johnston, phar
macy director of Tulsa County, who
has been advocating for drug redistri
bution in Oklahoma for six years, and
Greg Prouty, pharmacy director for
Stanford Hospital.
