### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
The three ASSU executive slates
faced off at Peet's Coffee in Tresidder
Memorial Union last night during the an
nual ASSU Executive Debate.
The event was moderated by Gradu
ate Student Council Deputy Chair Roger
Stanley, a second-year business student,
and ASSU Undergraduate Senate Chair
Chris Lin, a senior. While last year's de
bate drew more than 1(X) people, there
were only about 30 students present to lis
ten to the candidates.
During its opening statement, the
Avalanche of Diversity slate, consisting
of presidential candidate Rishi Chander
raj and vice presidential candidate Carrie
Kemper, both juniors, ate Subway sand
wiches and fed each other Oreos while
playing music.
Presidential candidate Victoria Carr
and vice presidential candidate Fernando
Castillo, also juniors, began by stressing
the importance of improving interaction
between groups at Stanford and said that
they plan to spend the summer at Stan
ford to work on their plans.
"Both Fernando and 1 feel that com
munication and collaboration are really
important to Stanford's quality of life,"

Carr said. "Creating coalitions is the key
to making a difference here. We're com
mitted to bringing people together so that
everyone feels united."
The last opening remarks were deliv
ered by presidential candidate Melanie

Victoria Carr and Fernando Castillo (left) and Melanie Kannokada and Aneto
Okonkwo discuss their goals for next year at the executive slate debate.
Kannokada and vice presidential
candidate Aneto Okonkwo, both ju
niors. They focused on the team spir
it that they have already built with
each other.
"We have a strong working dy
namic because we've worked this
whole year on junior class projects,"
Kannokada said. "A lot of slates
come in without that experience in
teamwork."
One of the main issues covered in
the debate was the lack of attention
given to student opinions in formu
lating the new plans for housing and
dining.
"A lot of students feel that their
voice was not heard and one way you
can fix that is by reworking the Nom
inations Commission, which is an or
ganization that recruits students to
represent various University com
mittees," Carr said. "We feel that re
working the commission would help
NomCom do a more effective job in
recruiting qualified candidates."
Okonkwo agreed that there was a
lack of student involvement in these
decision-making processes.
"I've had the opportunity to work
on the housing situation through the
|Black Student Union]," Okonkwo
said. " The plan needs to go back to
the drawing board. We can't predict
how it's going to affect the campus."
The Avalanche of Diversity sang a
song to represent the student voice.
Another major topic was the rep
resentation of different campus com
munities and how each slate would
work to bridge gaps between these
segments of the student body.
The Kannokada / Okonkwo slate
said that it is important that every stu
dent has the opportunity to voice his
or her concerns.
"Each student should be able to
use the ASSU as a vehicle of change,
and the ASSU should be accessible to
everyone," Kannokada said. "We
want everyone to have faith in the
process."
Castillo emphasized the need to
bring all of the community's voices
together so that students can collabo
rate with each other and work more
effectively.
"We don't feel that the student
voices disagree with each other,"
Castillo said. "The key to represent
ing the student voice would be to
open the lines of communication be
tween the groups."
Both the Carr/Castillo slate and
the Kannokada/Okonkwo slate ex
pressed the need to foster interaction
between the undergraduate and
graduate student bodies.
During the debate, each slate out
lined their three most important
agenda items.
"The first item of importance is to
build coalitions between student
groups," Kannokada said. "The sec

ond is to increase the amount of 24-
hour study space on campus and the
third is to create greater accessibility
to the ASSU."
Carr and Castillo stated that in
creased collaboration between stu
dent groups and more 24-hour study
spaces were already being worked on
this year, and that instead, the ASSU
should focus on being more accessi
ble to the student body and fostering
more constructive communication.
The Avalanche of Diversity asked
for the audience's opinion on what
the most important issues were, but
they ran out of time before their poll
could be conducted.
"Once we put them out there, you
decide what the three most important
issues are out of personal space,
hunger plan and Absolute Fun,"
Chanderraj said.
All slates discussed where they
stood on ethnic and race issues at
Stanford.
"We feel it's important that diver
sity is valued at Stanford," Carr said.
"We don't just represent the ethnic
communities that we are a part of."
The Kannokada/Okonkwo slate
described their plan to be more
proactive in listening to the concerns
of all Stanford students.
"We're devoted to attend as many
group meetings as we can to establish
working relationships with group
leaders," Kannokada said.
The Avalanche of Diversity ex
plained that it took them a whole
night to come up with their name and
that it represented their position on
diversity well.
"It's satirical, it is witty, it is catchy
and it is short enough to catch your
eye," Kemper said. "And when you
see that ballot up on your computer
screen on Wednesday and Thursday,
you're going to vote for us just be
cause of our name."
Each slate explained what they
planned to do even if not elected.
"One of the things we would like
to change here is the room reserva
tion process for student group
meetings," Kannokada said.
"Right now the system isn't cen
tralized and we would really like to
work with academic computing to
create a system so that it is very
simple for any student group to re
serve a room."
Carr and Castillo said that even if
not elected, their first priority would
still be to work on opening the doors
of communication between the di
verse campus communities.
Kemper said, "If Rishi wasn't
elected president and I wasn't elected
vice president, I'd be fine with being
president and Rishi could be vice
president."
The Carr/Castillo slate is backed
by the Student Color Coalition and
the Stanford Democrats, while the
Kannokada/Okonkwo slate is being
endorsed by Club Sports and the
Inner Fraternity and Inner Sorority
Council.
Chanderraj said that his both par
ents were 110 percent behind him.
