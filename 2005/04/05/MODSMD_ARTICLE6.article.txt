# Ballot details and logistics explained

### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
For the past week, campaign flyers
have covered the walls of dormitories ask
ing students to choose from over 30
prospective undergraduate senators and
11 different class slates. With such a high
number of candidates, many students are
left wondering how their vote will actual
ly count in the elections tomorrow and
Thursday.
The ballot will be posted at
elections.stanford.edu at midnight on
Wednesday and will be remain up until the
end of Thursday. Results will be annouc
ned on Friday. Sophomore Chris Nguyen,
chair of the Undergraduate Senate's Rules
Committee, explained that items will ap
pear on the ballot in this order:
Ballot Measure A

into a programming fund and a communi-

ty service fund for student organiza
tions. If passed. Measure A would
merge these two funds into a single
general-fee fund so that the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate could have
greater flexibility in allocating money
to student groups.
In order for Measure A to pass, at
least two-thirds of those who vote on
the item must vote in favor of it. This
two-thirds must also account for at
least 15 percent of the undergraduate
student body.
Two Advisory Referenda
Unlike Measure A, the two refer
enda that will appear on the ballot are
purely advisory and non-binding.
They exist so that the ASSU can
gauge student support for potential
policy changes.
Advisory Referendum 1 address
es door-to-door distribution. Cur
rently, Residential Education policy
prohibits door-to-door distribution
of publications in dormitories unless
a student specifically requests that it
be allowed. The referendum asks if
students feel that door-to-door distri
bution should be allowed by default
and only prohibited if a student
specifically requests it to be so.
Advisory Referendum 2 deals
with the allocation of general-fee

funds to partisan student groups.
Right now, the Senate does not pro
vide financial support through gener
al fees to groups that specifically
identify with a political party. The
referendum asks if students feel that
partisan student groups should be al
lowed to receive funding for non-par
tisan activities, such as information
sessions.
Special-Fees Groups
Next on the ballot will be a list of
student groups that are up for consid
eration for special-fees funding.
There will be joint special-fees
groups, for both graduate and under
graduate students to vote upon, as
well as groups that only undergradu
ate or only graduate students can
vote upon.
A link will be provided for each
student group, containing a copy of
the group's budget and a statement
from the group about why it needs
special fees.
In order fora special-fees group
to receive the funding it requested, it
must be approved by at least 50 per
cent of those students who vote
within the relevant student popula
tion. For example, a graduate spe
cial-fees group will need to receive
the support of at least 50 percent of
the graduate students who vote. This
majority vote must also comprise at
least 15 percent of the respective stu
dent population.
Students can vote for as many spe
cial-fees groups as they wish.

ASSU Executive Slates
The three executive slates running
for ASSU president and vice presi
dent will appear next on the ballot.
Students will be asked to rank the
three slates in their order of prefer
ence.
Once all voters' ranks have been
submitted, the executive slates will be
placed through two rounds of elimi
nation to determine the winner.
In the first round, the slate with
the lowest amount of number one
rankings will be eliminated. All the
students who ranked the eliminated
slate as number one will then have
their number two slate ranked as
their first choice.
The process is then repeated to
see which slate has the most votes.
That slate will then be declared the
winner.
Undergraduate Senators and Grad
uate Student Council Members
Whether the voter is an under
graduate or a graduate student will
determine what appears next on the
student's ballot.
For undergraduates, there will be
a list of 34 undergraduate senatorial
candidates. Since there are 15 seats
available in the Senate, each student
will be able to vote for 15 senators.
The 15 candidates who receive the
most votes will be declared the win
ners.
Over 30 candidates for the
Graduate Student Council, or

GSC, will appear on graduate stu
dents' ballots to fill the available 15
seats.
According to Article II Section
1A of the GSC by-laws, 10 of these
members will come from districts
represented by each professional
school. Each graduate school re
ceives one representative, except for
the School of Engineering, which re
ceives two, and the School of Hu
manities and Science, which receives
three.
These 10 GSC members are elect
ed specifically by the students in the
graduate school that they belong to
by a majority vote.
The other five members are elect
ed through at-large elections which
consider the entire graduate student
population.
While all district candidates are
initially considered part of the at
large elections, once the winners of
the non-at-large district elections are
determined, they are excluded from
winning the at-large elections.The
five candidates with the most overall
votes win the remaining seats on the
GSC.
Class President Slates
Appearing last on the ballot will
be the class presidential slates. Each
undergraduate student will be asked
to rank the slates that are running
for their particular class, and the
winner is determined in the same

tive election.

In order fora special-fees group
to receive the funding it requested, it
must be approved by at least 50 per
cent of those students who vote
within the relevant student popula
tion. For example, a graduate spe
cial-fees group will need to receive
the support of at least 50 percent of
the graduate students who vote. This
majority vote must also comprise at
least 15 percent of the respective stu
dent population.
Students can vote for as many spe
cial-fees groups as they wish.

ASSU Executive Slates
The three executive slates running
for ASSU president and vice presi
dent will appear next on the ballot.
Students will be asked to rank the
three slates in their order of prefer
ence.
Once all voters' ranks have been
submitted, the executive slates will be
placed through two rounds of elimi
nation to determine the winner.
In the first round, the slate with
the lowest amount of number one
rankings will be eliminated. All the
students who ranked the eliminated
slate as number one will then have
their number two slate ranked as
their first choice.
The process is then repeated to
see which slate has the most votes.
That slate will then be declared the
winner.
Undergraduate Senators and Grad
uate Student Council Members
Whether the voter is an under
graduate or a graduate student will
determine what appears next on the
student's ballot.
For undergraduates, there will be
a list of 34 undergraduate senatorial
candidates. Since there are 15 seats
available in the Senate, each student
will be able to vote for 15 senators.
The 15 candidates who receive the
most votes will be declared the win
ners.
Over 30 candidates for the
Graduate Student Council, or

GSC, will appear on graduate stu
dents' ballots to fill the available 15
seats.
According to Article II Section
1A of the GSC by-laws, 10 of these
members will come from districts
represented by each professional
school. Each graduate school re
ceives one representative, except for
the School of Engineering, which re
ceives two, and the School of Hu
manities and Science, which receives
three.
These 10 GSC members are elect
ed specifically by the students in the
graduate school that they belong to
by a majority vote.
The other five members are elect
ed through at-large elections which
consider the entire graduate student
population.
While all district candidates are
initially considered part of the at
large elections, once the winners of
the non-at-large district elections are
determined, they are excluded from
winning the at-large elections.The
five candidates with the most overall
votes win the remaining seats on the
GSC.
Class President Slates
Appearing last on the ballot will
be the class presidential slates. Each
undergraduate student will be asked
to rank the slates that are running
for their particular class, and the
winner is determined in the same
process used for the ASSU execu
tive election.
