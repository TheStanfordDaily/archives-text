# Forum on Islam promotes tolerance
## 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
To provide a forum for all mem
bers of the Stanford community to
ask questions about and acquaint
themselves better with the Islamic
faith, two Islamic student groups
hosted a panel last night entitled
"Islam Reflections and Percep
tions," including both students and
Muslim leaders.
Sponsored by the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network, or
MSAN, in partnership with the Is
lamic Society at Stanford University,
or ISSU, the panel featured senior
Rania Eltom. MSAN president; doc

toral student Ibrahim Almojel, pres
ident of ISSU; Ameena Jandali, sec
retary of the Islamic Networks
Group â€” a nonprofit designed to
educate the public about Islam; and
Hisham Abdallah. imam of the Mus
lim Community Association of
Santa Clara. Thom Massey, associ
ate dean of students and cultural ed
ucation affairs, moderated the
event.
The speakers each described the
major tenets of Islam, focusing
mainly on the misperceptions of the
religion.
Abdallah outlined the five pillars
Panel on Islam questions assumptions

of Islam: faith in the oneness of God, daily prayer,
charity, fasting and the pilgrimage to Makkah for
those who are able.
"Islam is a religion where the main focus is the
relationship with God," Jandali said, adding that
many assumptions about Islam are perpetuated
by people who are unfamiliar with the belief sys
tem.
For instance, contrary to some people's suppo
sitions, Muslim women wear head scarves as a
sign of modesty, not because men forced them to.
she said.
"There is so much diversity to Islam." Jandali
said. "There are over 1.2 billion people worldwide
who consider themselves Muslim, yet the media
tends to portray only one side of the religion."

All four speakers highlighted this one-sided
ness and the inaccuracies it leads to.
During the question-and-answer session, one
audience member asked why many of the world's
terrorists happen to be Muslim.
Abdallah replied that the actions of terrorists
are not in accordance with the teachings of Islam,
especially with the ideal of perfect moral character.
"Islam does not condone terrorism," Eltom
added.
Jandali said she believes that each generation
of Americans seems to identify a particular
enemy, contrived to fit ideologies or economic ne
cessities.
"During the Cold War the Russians were our
enemies and now it is the Muslims," she said.

"Our memory of history is short."
Eltom said MSAN decided to host the forum
because there are few Stanford classes that ex
plain the central tenets of Islam. Though Islam is
represented in the University's student body, it is
not reflected in the class listings for the Depart
ment of Religious Studies, she said.
She added that there have been events on cam
pus that portrayed Islam in a negative light, and
that this year vandals have scrawled words, in
cluding "terrorist," on MSAN flyers.
"There is something that is missing on our
campus, a lack of attention, appreciation or try ing
to understand," Eltom said. "I hope that the event
will provide a greater sense of tolerance at Stan
ford."
