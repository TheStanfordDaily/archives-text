## 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Technology and global entrepre
ncurship experts from around the
world are on campus today and for
the rest of this week to meet and dis
cuss their experiences and careers in
the United States and Asia.
The theme for the seventh annu
al Stanford summit, put on by the
Stanford Asian-Pacific Student En
trepreneurship Society, or ASES, is
Beyond Borders: Entrepreneurship
in the Global Context. Senior Evan
Tana, president of ASES, describes
ASES as a global organization that
aims to inform and network students

interested in business, technology
and entrepreneurship in the Asia-
Pacific region.
"ASES, particularly the summit,
helps plant the seed for entrepre
neurship," Tana said. "We hope that
exposure to entrepreneurship
sparks the imagination of students
around the world and eventually re
sults in the formation of new global
ventures."
He added that several start-up
companies have already been found
ed by former ASES members.
According to Tana, the summit
hopes to bring together students
from a variety of backgrounds to
meet and learn about entrepreneur
ship in a global context.
"The speakers will be addressing
a variety of things — everything
from personal entrepreneurial expe
rience, specific skills like negotiation
and venture financing, to industry
specific news," he said.
Today's events include seminars
and lectures on skills and strategies
for start-up companies. The day will
start off with a presentation from Fred

Greguras and Andrew Luh from Fen
wick & West LLP. a local law firm, on
financing requirements and the legal
aspects of starting a company. The
keynote speaker of the day will be
Min Zhu, co-founder and president of
WebEx Communications.
The summit is one of the two
major conferences put on by ASES,
which has a number of chapters at
universities across both the United
States and Asia. The next summit
will be held in Singapore in August.
"The Asia-Pacific is a huge op
portunity for the U.S. in that it will
be a major driver of global growth."
Tana said. "Furthermore, there are
many ways of leveraging resources
here in Silicon Valley in creating

value both in Asia and the United
States."
Tana said he hopes that this con
ference and the discussions that
arise from it will inspire students as
they confront obstacles they en
counter in forming their own busi
nesses.
"The challenges are numerous
but learning to work with people
from many different cultures and
backgrounds will be one of the
greatest challenges," Tana said.
"The summit is one step toward
preparing entrepreneurs for that
challenge."
Many of the summit's events will
be hosted on the Stanford campus
and are open and free to the public.
