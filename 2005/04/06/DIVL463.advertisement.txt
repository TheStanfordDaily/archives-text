How I Write is a series of conversations with faculty and other advanced
writers to explore the nuts and bolts, pleasures and pains, of all types of
writing. While content is always an issue, the conversation will primarily focus
on work styles, such as where, when, and how a writer composes, allowing us
to examine habits, idiosyncrasies, techniques, trade secrets, hidden anxieties,
and delights. We will discuss how a writer generates ideas, sustains large-scale
projects, combines research with composition, overcomes various impediments
and blocks, and cultivates stylistic innovations. Writing communities share
experiences (even bad ones), so that all writers can learn and grow, and
Stanford is an exceptionally rich community for gaining such insights.
Join Hilton Obenzinger, Associate Director for Honors Writing, Undergraduate
Research Programs, in a conversation on the techniques, quirks, and joys of
advanced writers producing work in all fields and genres.
Conversations, Spring 2005
