The Catholic
Community

Statement to the Stanford University community
regarding the death of
Pope John Paul II
The death of a pope is a significant event in the life the Church and of the world; it is
more so with the death of one as widely known as His Holiness, Pope John Paul 11. We
can and no doubt will argue about his tenure in the Shoes of the Fisherman, but now
is not that time. The world has lost an energetic and courageous witness to hope, one
who profoundly influenced the lives of millions, outside and inside the Catholic com
munity. He took seriously his call to serve the Gospel of Jesus Christ and to be a ser
vant of humanity.
The Christian Scriptures tell us, "From everyone to whom much has been given, much
will be required; and from the one to whom much has been entrusted, even more will
be demanded." (Luke 12:48) It is a scripture that challenges all of us in leadership
(and those who will be leaders), to remember that we are accountable to Another for
our stewardship; and the greater the responsibility, the greater the personal cost.
In these next days, as we mourn the loss of Karol Jozef Wojtyla and honor his earthly
remains, I invite all members of the Stanford community, non-Christian and Christian
alike, to join the Catholic Community in praying that Almighty God forgive his sins
and that he may hear the voice of Jesus say, "Enter into the joy of your master."
(Matthew 25:21) Eternal rest grant to him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon
him.
May he rest in peace.
