The University announced yesterday
that His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama
Tenzin Gyatso will visit Stanford on Nov.
4 and 5 to teach meditation; speak on the
importance of nonviolence and tolerance;
and discuss the influence of Buddhism on
the human mind with neuroscientists.
Dean of Religious Life Scotty McLen
nan said the University is predicting the
scheduled events to draw thousands of
people from both on and off campus.
A meditation workshop followed by a
question-and-answer session will be led
by the Dalai Lama at 9:30 a.m. on Friday,
Nov. 4 in Maples Pavilion. At 2:30 p.m.,
McLennan will host a conversation with
the Dalai Lama entitled "The Heart of
Nonviolence" in Memorial Church as part

of the Heyns Lecture Series. On Saturday
at 10 a.m. in Memorial Auditorium, scien
tists from Stanford and peer institutions,
as well as other Buddhist scholars, will
have a dialogue with the Dalai Lama
about the Buddhist perspective on human
craving, suffering and choice.
Some of the weekend's events will he
open to the public and others will be invi
tation-only. While members of the gener
al public can purchase tickets for the three
main events, the number of tickets sold to
those outside the Stanford community for
the lecture on nonviolence will be limited
to ensure that enough spaces are available
for students. McLennan said roughly 30
percent of the tickets for this event will be
reserved for students.
Tickets will go on sale for students, fac-
