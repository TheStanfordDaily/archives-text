# Dalai Lama to visit
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS MANAGING EDITOR 
The University announced yesterday
that His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama
Tenzin Gyatso will visit Stanford on Nov.
4 and 5 to teach meditation; speak on the
importance of nonviolence and tolerance;
and discuss the influence of Buddhism on
the human mind with neuroscientists.
Dean of Religious Life Scotty McLen
nan said the University is predicting the
scheduled events to draw thousands of
people from both on and off campus.
A meditation workshop followed by a
question-and-answer session will be led
by the Dalai Lama at 9:30 a.m. on Friday,
Nov. 4 in Maples Pavilion. At 2:30 p.m.,
McLennan will host a conversation with
the Dalai Lama entitled "The Heart of
Nonviolence" in Memorial Church as part

of the Heyns Lecture Series. On Saturday
at 10 a.m. in Memorial Auditorium, scien
tists from Stanford and peer institutions,
as well as other Buddhist scholars, will
have a dialogue with the Dalai Lama
about the Buddhist perspective on human
craving, suffering and choice.
Some of the weekend's events will he
open to the public and others will be invi
tation-only. While members of the gener
al public can purchase tickets for the three
main events, the number of tickets sold to
those outside the Stanford community for
the lecture on nonviolence will be limited
to ensure that enough spaces are available
for students. McLennan said roughly 30
percent of the tickets for this event will be
reserved for students.

November to speak on issues of tolerance and
nonviolence.
ulty and staff beginning May 31,
and for the general public on June
13. For those who are unable to at
tend, the three events will be web
cast live on dalailania.stanford.edu.
Ticket prices were not listed, al
though McLennan said that they
would likely be free to students for
at least one of the events.
The Dalai Lama will also attend
an invitation-only reception hosted
by the Stanford Center for Bud
dhist Studies.
"The Dalai Lama is one of the
major contemporary religious fig
ures in the world," said Michael
Zimmermann, assistant professor
of religious studies who sits on the
committee for Tibetan studies.
"The fact that he is visiting is a
great honor to the University."
McLennan said he has offered
the Dalai Lama an invitation for
three years, as has Dean of the
Medical School Philip Pizzo.
"He's a very busy man,"
McLennan said. "We are very hon
ored that he decided to come."
The weekend's events are being
co-sponsored by the Office for Re
ligious Life, Stanford Continuing
Studies, the Center for Buddhist
Studies — a part of the Asian Reli
gions and Cultures Initiative —
and the Stanford Medical School.
McLennan said that neuroscien
tists on campus and from surround
ing areas are "very interested in
looking at Buddhism in terms of its
understanding of the mind and the
spiritual and scientific dimensions
of the human mind in relation to
craving and suffering."
He also said that the Dalai
Lama is the ideal figure to speak on
the global necessity for peace and
tolerance, since he received the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 and has
always discouraged the use of vio
lence in the Tibetan liberation
movement.
The Dalai Lama, born in 1935
to a peasant family in Tibet, was
identified as the reincarnation of
his predecessor at the age of two.
He became the political leader of
Tibet in 1950, following the Chi
nese invasion. He was forced to
leave in 1959, and took 80,000 Ti
betans with him. He currently re
sides in Dharamsala, India,
where he still serves as the head
of state and religious leader for
Tibet.
McLennan said he believes that
most students, even those without
an active interest in Buddhism, will
want to attend the weekend's
events.
"He's an international figure, a
global citizen and I think that is in
teresting for everyone," he said.
Freshman Marci Pepper agreed
with McLennan and said she would
definitely seize the opportunity to
see the Dalai Lama speak.
"It would be a privilege to be in
the presence of the Dalai Lama,"
she said. "He is admirable — re
gardless of your individual faith —
someone from whom we can all
learn."
