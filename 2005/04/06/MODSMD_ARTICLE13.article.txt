On April 6,1965, The Daily ran an
article about one professor's experi
ment on computer-based learning for
elementary school students in the field
of mathematics. Below is an excerpt:
"Professor Patrick Suppes, direc
tor of the institute for Mathematical
Studies in the Social Sciences has an
nounced that a computer-based labo
ratory for learning and teaching has
been developed at the Computation
Center.
"At present 12 first graders are

coming in every day for 30 minutes to
work individually at computer termi
nals. A complete mathematics cur
riculum is being presented to them
under computer control. Also on a
daily basis, two bright second graders
and two kindergarten children are
being presented and taught special
curriculums.
"Initial work was begun in 1963
with a $ 1 million dollar grant from the
Carnegie Foundation.
"The computer-based laboratory

consists of six student stations located
in a special addition built to the Com
putation Center. At each station is an
IBM terminal which displays a micro
film image on which the student may
respond with a light pen and a Philco
cathode ray tube.
On April 6, 1959, The Daily cov
ered a story about the destruction of
former President Hoover's antiques in
a fire. Below is an excerpt:
"Antiques and art objects collect
ed by former President Herbert
Hoover were destroyed as the home
of Hoover's late brother Theodore
burned to the ground last Friday
night.
"The four-story, 30-room ranch
home was situated on the coast, 15
miles north of Santa Cruz. Mrs.
Hulda McLean, Theodore's daugh
ter, estimated the loss at $50,000.
"No one was at home at the time
of the fire, which was discovered by a
Cal student on a botany field trip."
