# Students kick off Herstory
## 
### SARAH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
To celebrate a history of women's accomplish
ments, the Stanford Women's Community Center,
or WCC, hosted the kick-off last night for the annu
al month-long series of events known as Herstory.
"This year one of the themes we are trying to ad
dress is the intersection of class, gender and sexual
ity," said Lisa Moore, assistant dean of the women's
center. "This will he accomplished through a panel
co-sponsored with the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans
gendered-Community Resources Center on social
class in the queer community, as well as a panel on
socio-economic status and student life."
While the WCC is sponsoring all of the events in
the series, the center is not solely responsible for it;
many of the events have been planned by other or
ganizations on campus, including sororities and po
litical groups.
"1 think this [the collaboration of groups] will
bring together different types of students," said
Raphael Ginsburg, who attended the opening event.
One of the events expected to draw a large
turnout is "Take Back the Night," which will take
place on April 21. It will focus on sexual assault and
violence toward women. The event will begin with
a rally in White Plaza, followed by a walk around
campus from one emergency blue light to another
and then a discussion at the WCC.
Other events expected to be popular include
those featuring well-known speakers. The most

noteworthy speaker, Moore said, is Johnetta Cole,
the first black president of Spelman College who
has spoken out about issues of racism and sexism.
She will speak on April 19. Other popular events
include lectures delivered by Community Health
Specialist Donnovan Yisrael and renowned femi
nist scholar and Stanford History Prof. Estelle
Freedman.
The kick-off event addressed the overall goals
of the series and the upcoming events, and includ
ed a discussion of the murals in the WCC, painted
by senior Anna Mumlord.
She painted one of the murals two years ago as
part of an exploration of women's imagery. A more
recent work, which depicts the female aging
process and contains more political messages, fea
tures a woman with a microphone to symbolize
women becoming more vocal. The mural also por
trays women speaking barcodes, symbolizing how
women's bodies have become increasingly like
commodities.
"I like to do art that comments on the larger so
ciety that 1 am a part of," Mumford said, adding
that she is particularly drawn to marginalized
groups. One of her murals in the CoHo attacks
labor issues, and she is currently considering a way
to address queer and disability issues in her art.
Mumford's art served as an appropriate opening
for Herstory because of the many issues the series
will bring to the surface. As the month progresses,
these issues will be explored from various per
spectives.
