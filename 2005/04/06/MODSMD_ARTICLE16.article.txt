# But that's not the point...
## Trials and Tribulations of a Consumer Whore 
### 
I compulsively spend money. I am a
shopaholic, and 1 waver between being
proud of it and feeling horribly, horri
bly guilty about it. I'm guilty of all the
crimes: I use shopping to soothe bad
moods (I think it's better than a lot of
other options, like abusing drugs), and

I use it to reward
myself fora task
that has been fin
ished or a stressful
week that is over.
I think I've fig
ured out the reason
for all this spending:
it can all be attribut
ed to my socioeco
nomic background.
When I was a kid, we

didn't order sodas on the rare occa
sions we went out to dinner because
that $1.50 mattered quite a hit. I don't
remember ever shopping at anyplace
like the Gap until I was at least 13. I
wasn't really aware of it at the time, but
we were pretty damn broke.
Now, things are much more com
fortable. Full-time jobs for both of my
parents, hefty financial aid and an RA
paycheck mean that I can pretty much
cover my needs, and usually 1 manage
to do more than that. In fact, my spend
ing is a little ridiculous. It's gotten to
the point where I come home from
shopping trips, show my friends what
I've bought, listen to them mock me for
a bit, and within five minutes I'm shak
ing my head, wailing hysterically and
burying myself in my sheets.
What do I buy, you ask? To be hon
est, 1 kind of lose track on a daily basis,
but if I think about it I can come up
with a list. I spend money on clothes,
food, margaritas. magazines that I buy
off the rack instead of subscribing, gas,
TiVo, Netflix and cable subscriptions,
and various necessities such as clear
nail polish, alphabet beads or a new vo
tive candle holder.
The problem is that I never learned
how to spend or save money. If I have
any money, I am going to spend it on
something. Why hold back? If I want a
Diet Coke with dinner, well then I'm
going to get a Diet Coke with dinner. I
know that in principle, just because I
have the money in the bank account
doesn't mean I can "afford" it, but I can't
quite hammer it into my head, so my
monthly balance drops lower and lower.
I've tried various methods to cope
with this spend-oholism, but none of
them have really worked. The only tac
tic that came close to working was leav
ing my debit card at home (I say debit
because I haven't yet opened the Pan
dora's box of credit cards). Less drastic
measures, of course, include vowing to
only buy what I need — something that
is entirely worth the money, or some
thing that is going to be so useful so
often that it's impossible to pass up. I
have tried the "one hour rule" — leav
ing the coveted item behind in the store
while I shop on, and then going back for
it — but that didn't work. I have tried
the"I can return it later" rule, but I al
ways end up wearing the pair of jeans I
buy as soon as I get home, and then it's
too late. My own personal quirk is writ
ing a mental letter to my father when
ever I'm buying something ridiculous,
such as, "Dear Dad, today I spent $35 at
Target. The thing is that I really needed
boys' gym shorts and that pair of cheap
earrings." Obviously, "need" is rela
tive. I really need TiVo, you know, and
if I don't have Bermuda shorts for
spring quarter I might not be able to
graduate on time.
Most men don't understand this
spending problem because they can't
stand spending more than 20 minutes
in a mall and never buy anything that
isn't on sale. Men usually don't impulse
buy, either, whereas I'm always finding
something new that I can't live with
out. It comes down to a matter of disci
pline, which you need if you're a girl in
a mall, and I don't have. I feel about
money the same way I feel about
studying (which I can't discipline my
self about either, and I believe it's be
cause I went to public high school). It's
almost hopeless now.
I'm sorry to say that I don't have an
uplifting message for you this week, ex
cept to tell you that if you are having
buyer's second-guessing (remorse is
too strong a word) about a recent pur
chase, you're not alone. Join me in my
endless justifications. Sure, that money
is gone and you'll never get it back, but
at least you probably have a great pair
of shoes to show for it. Right?

I know what you're thinking. Dan,
Pablo and Sean, you know where I live.
Everyone else, direct your mockery to
emwood@stanford.edu. And Dad, I'm
sorrx ahead of time. I promise I'm work
ing on it.
