# For some seniors, spring quarter is last chance to play on the Farm
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
A long to-do list sits on senior Alejandra
Villalobos' desk: order cap and gown, plan
graduation dinner, apply to graduate on
Axess. But as time begins to run out for her
and other seniors as they get ready to leave
the Farm, they have another list in mind —
all the things they want to do before they
graduate from Stanford.
"I've already done steam-tunneling and

fountain-hopping," Villalobos said. "I'd
just really like to hook up with a hot TA or
prof.," she joked.
For other students, there is no list:
Spring quarter is simply a chance to enjoy
Stanford and hang out with friends.
"I wanted to take the minimum course
load and just relax," senior Laura Avina
said.
Scott Hartley, also a senior, said that his
list is less about tangible activities and more
about taking time to appreciate there

sources and aesthetics of Stanford.
"I think it's important to appreciate
what's around you," Hartley said. "It's
about stepping back and saying, 'Wow, this
is perfect.' This is the only time when it will
be 'my' Stanford."
Auditing classes is a popular option
for those who don't want to increase
their unit load during their last quarter.
Senior Wendy Salazar is auditing "Only
Almodovar," a Spanish literature class,
for fun.

Many seniors look at graduating in a bit
tersweet way, excited about the possibili
ties that lie ahead and sad to leave their col
lege years behind them.
"I looked at the Stanford Web site and
saw the number of students admitted to the
class of 2009 and realized that we are just
one of many classes," said Hartley. "The
process just keeps going and going."
