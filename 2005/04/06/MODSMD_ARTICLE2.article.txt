An ambitious student from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy, David Zopal came to Stanford
in 1996 with the intent to find a cure
for HIV. He was excited to work
with Garry Nolan, a professor of
molecular pharmacology and micro
biology and immunology at the
School of Medicine. Nolan, howev
er, was also a co-founder for the
startup company Rigel Pharmaceu
ticals. Zapol soon determined that
his research goals were being com
promised by Nolan's involvement in
Rigel, and decided to leave Stanford.

Inc.," Jennifer Washburn describes
situations like Zapol's as an all-too
common phenomenon. Published in
February, the book grew out of an
article Washburn published for The
Atlantic Monthly in 1998.
"My interest in the subject stayed

tionship between UC Berkeley and
the corporation Novartis [which fo
cuses on genetically altered crops],"
