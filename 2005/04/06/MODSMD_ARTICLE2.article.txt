# Business, academic ties outed
## 
### NILA BALA STAFF WRITER 
An ambitious student from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy, David Zopal came to Stanford
in 1996 with the intent to find a cure
for HIV. He was excited to work
with Garry Nolan, a professor of
molecular pharmacology and micro
biology and immunology at the
School of Medicine. Nolan, howev
er, was also a co-founder for the
startup company Rigel Pharmaceu
ticals. Zapol soon determined that
his research goals were being com
promised by Nolan's involvement in
Rigel, and decided to leave Stanford.
In her new book, "University,
Inc.," Jennifer Washburn describes
situations like Zapol's as an all-too
common phenomenon. Published in
February, the book grew out of an
article Washburn published for The
Atlantic Monthly in 1998.
"My interest in the subject stayed
with me after I investigated a rela
tionship between UC Berkeley and
the corporation Novartis [which fo
cuses on genetically altered crops],"
she said in an interview with The
Daily."I realized the article was in
adequate to deal with this subject
and received a book contract to ex
plore it further."
Most universities, including Stan
ford. have protocols governing cor
porate-university relations. But after
interviewing Zapol and fellow grad
uate student Michael Rothenberg,
Washburn found a number of clear
conflicts-of-interest between the cor
poration and Stanford.
"At first, Zapol was extremely ex
cited about mapping out the HIV-re
lated research he was going to pursue
as part of his Ph.D. thesis," Wash
burn wrote in the book. "But there
was one problem: his thesis was built
around the same genomic screening
technology that now lay at the core of
Rigel's new technology."
Rothenberg also claimed in the
book that their technology had been
featured in a company presentation
without any acknowledgement of
their authorship, and before being
published in a peer-review journal.
When questioned by Washburn and
The Stanford Daily in a follow-up in
terview, Nolan claimed he had no
recollection of the incident.
Washburn noted that Nolan's re
luctance to describe the event was
something she frequently encoun
tered while writing the book.
"It really was very hard to get
people to talk to me," she said.

"Even tenured professors who
would speak freely on a one-on-one
basis were not comfortable with
going on the record. There is a cul
ture of cooperation with corpora
tions. If professors speak out their
ability to get resources, such as lab
space and grad students, is threat
ened."
So how do such ties between in
dustry and academics — which
Washburn describes as cloaked in se
crecy— affect research outcomes?
In the article that eventually led to
Washburn's book, she discussed the
dangers posed by corporate-spon
sored research, which tends to ignore
unprofitable ventures, like vaccines
for undeveloped nations.
According to Washburn, even
10 years ago, tangible corporate in
fluence on research was apparent.
In 1996, Biomedical Ethics Prof.
Mildred Cho co-authored a study
in The Annals of Internal Medi
cine that found that 98 percent of
papers based on industry-spon
sored research reflected favorably
on the drugs being examined, com
pared with 79 percent of papers
based on research not funded by
industry.
Washburn also suggested in the
book that the traditionally open at
mosphere of academic institutions is
being lost due to exclusive licensing,
under which basic research tools are
restricted to those who will pay for
them, under exclusive licensing
agreements. In the period between
1986 and 1992, nearly 60 percent of
licenses at Stanford were granted on
a relatively exclusive basis, according
to Washburn.

Kathy Ku, director of the Stan
ford Office of Technology and Li
censing, or OTL, said that in the past
year the numbers have shifted and
only 40 percent of licenses are now
exclusive.
Even for nonexclusive licenses,
however, there is payment involved
because inventions are usually re
quested by corporations.
"We usually license to corpora
tions, so we expect them to make a
product which they would pay and
earn royalties on," Ku said in an in
terview with The Daily.
Washburn said that exclusive li
censes harm students and professors
who are trying to conduct research
by building on past research. She
cited in her book a paper that found
that imposing excessive proprietary
restrictions could block access to one
of the most vital public resources —
knowledge — and thus stifle further
research and innovation.
Washburn did not offer an explic
it solution for Stanford, or any other
institution named in her book, which
has already gone into its second
print. But she added that addressing
the situation doesn't mean severing
all ties with corporations.
"I don't advocate a total cut-off,"
she said in an interview. "Universi
ties have long had relations with pri
vate industry and the industry needs
to have access to the university.
There needs to be a third-party in
dependent technology licensing of
fice, which would remove some of
the profit motive. The relationship
can be positive with stricter conflict
of-interest policies on university sci
entists."
