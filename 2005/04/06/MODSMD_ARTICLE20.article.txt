# Techie repairs the world
## The 						ownership society 
### 
Does anyone understand how the
economy works, really? 1 have to say
that I'm baffled. To me it all seems like
a juggling act. We buy some Japanese
stuff, they do some sort of crazy judo
with our money, and somehow we
manage to have an economy devoted
to selling cheeseburgers.
We bought the United States from
the British back in 1776 on some sort of
lay away plan and to make our payments

we've been borrowing continuously. Our debt keeps grow
ing, and no one seems to think it's weird that we owe China
a trillion dollars â€” but at the same time our boats are all
that's stopping it from invading Taiwan. What would hap
pen if China just decided to repossess the carriers?
What do we do in this country precisely? I mean, I know
that somewhere in the middle we pay farmers not to grow
food. Sometimes we dig things out of the ground. Other
than that we seem to design iPods, which are mass-pro
duced in Taiwan and bought from Apple by kids with
money they got from their parents whose wages are paid
by Apple's revenue, which comes from iPods.
Now 1 don't mean to suggest that our economy doesn't
work, because it clearly does. 1 just wanted to point out that
no one knows how it works. Honestly does anyone really
know why money is worth anything? Or why anything is
worth anything? The economy seems to be powered by
magic.
And I feel like George W. Bush and I are on the same
page here. His family has basically been living on invested
income for generations. They don't do any real work. Yet
they're still rich. I bet one day he was like, "Huzzah mates,
why can't everyone just give their dough to a broker and
live on the dollars he gives us back?"
And that makes sense to me. I mean, what would hap
pen if there were no payroll taxes and everyone invested all

their money in the market? Then the companies would
have way more money to do what they do (i.e. buy com
puters, whores, desks, cocaine, iPods, the souls of the
damned, etc.). Then with whatever money they had left
over, the companies could buy robots (or Mexicans) to do
all the actual work.
The robots would produce everything. They'd be the
clerks, receptionists and truck drivers. But who would buy
their stuff? If the. robots put everyone out of work then
there's no one to huy anything. So the companies would
have to take their filthy, filthy profits (which would be
much greater because they now have no wages to pay) and
pay them out as dividends. And we could use our dividends
to go buy iPods, just like before. With one key difference,
none of us would have to work. We could just sip mint
juleps next to a bonfire of money. Basically we'd all be
George Bush.
So you see now why I'm totally lor the ownership soci
ety. Oh, I'm sure some of you are saying it could never
work. Something catastrophic would happen if everyone
suddenly poured all their spare money into the market.
But other people would say the same thing about rapidly
mounting debt or massive trade imbalances. And they
were wrong. 1 think the lesson we need to learn is that no
matter what ridiculous things we do to the economy, as
long as the magic is there, things will work. And by magic I
mean drugs.
Let's take a historical look here. The Great Depression
was a result of Prohibition. Early '80s stagflation was
caused by the end of the drug-friendly disco era. The '90s
boom roughly corresponds to the rise in the use of crack.
So smoke dope and invest.

This piece Ls not a satire about George Hush. It is what hap
pens whenever anyone honest writes about the economy. If
you want to explain any of these conundrums to Rahul, email
