## Better communication needed between ASSU and voters 
### MIKEY LEE 
Today and tomorrow, you will be able to
vote fora number of candidates who promise
to make next year better. They promise to ex
tend hours and drop costs. They swear that
they'll build coalitions and communicate bet
ter with you.
I've been involved in student life fora very
long time. My biggest frustration is hearing,
year after year, "I don't care about the elec
tions. I don't even know what the ASSU does
for me."
More shocking is that many students have
no idea who their ASSU president is. That's
shameful.
Not shameful of you for not knowing.
Shameful of them for not making sure that you
know.
Look around: No one knows. No one cares.
Check the ASSU Web site. The calendar post
ings are of the first day of class last fall. That's
an unacceptable level of inefficiency from
those who have been given so much responsi
bility.
The biggest problem that we face is not cost
of living. It's not investment disclosure. It's not
the housing issue — they're all important, but

the bigger problem is a lack of communication
(and related cliches — "accountability" and
"accessibility").
What is to blame for this problem? En
dorsements.
As far as 1 can remember, no slate that
sought the ASSU executive position has won
without an endorsement from the Students of
Color Coalition, or SOCC.
SOCC is a coalition of the leaders from the
Black Students Union. Asian American Stu
dents Association, Stanford American Indian
Organization and Movimiento Estudiantil Chi
cano de Aztlan and represents a lot of votes.
Now, I don't want to undermine the work
done by past officers — many of them have
done phenomenal things for student life.
They've improved undergraduate advising,
given you hassle-free laundry and helped put
on dozens upon dozens of past events.
My grievance concerns the process by
which special interests groups choose to en
dorse candidates that eventually feeds the lack
of knowledge about the ASSU.
Most organizations like SOCC will stand by
their endorsed candidates, saying that they
"best represent us."
I respect that notion, but then I hear stu

dents saying that they don't know what the
ASSU does for them. And I realize what the
bottom line is: knowing what your leaders do
for you, without your having to go dig for that
information.
And now, I don't blame endorsements. 1
blame you. The voter.
I blame you because in this democracy, ev
eryone gets a chance to vote for candidates
who are supposed to represent you, but then 1
hear you complaining that the ASSU gets
nothing done. I pick up a copy of The Stanford
Review with an article criticizing BSU-affiliat
ed senators voting on bills that support the
groups they represent.
Uh. do you think that BSU-affiliated sena
tors would vote against giving more funding to
Black Liberation Month? And how is that a
bad thing? In his response to the article in The
Review. BSU Co-Chair Michael Brown writes,
"Why does [The Review] consider corrupt
those senators affiliated with the BSU who
voted on issues relating to the black communi
s is simply not true."
I couldn't agree more. After all, we as a stu
dent body put all of those senators in office last
year. If you have a problem with how they
voted on a bill, don't blame them.

My point is this: Don't vote based on affilia
tions. Often it's their friends putting that affilia
tion together for them. Often it involves politi
cal crap that you don't want to know about any
way. If it so happens that the best candidates for
senate are BSU-affiliated (or affiliated with any
other organization for that matter), then great.
You have good leaders in office. Stop com
plaining.
I must make it clear that I am in no way say
ing that those who are affiliated with an orga
nization SOCC or otherwise are not good can
didates. I'm saying that you, as a voter, should
look very closely at who the candidates are.
Most importantly, ask yourself: "Are these
people really going to get anything done? And
if they do, will I know about it? Or are they just
another set of candidates that got a block of
votes?"
The winners will be your leaders for one full
year. They will have a great opportunity to get
things done. Make sure you pick the right ones.

communication and psychology. He won the
ASSU Executive race last year before it was un
constitutionally overturned by the Undergradu
