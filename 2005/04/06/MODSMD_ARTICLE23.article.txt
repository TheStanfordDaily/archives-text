Yes, we're in
college, hut in
many respects,
campus elections
are even more of
a popularity con
test than they
were in high
school. The Asso
ciated Students
of Stanford Uni
versity sounds like

such an official organization, but for
a host of reasons, it is little more than
a body that facilitates student activi
ties. With this in mind, does it matter
who you vote for?
All the candidates run on the
same issues, and all those who are
elected will fail to achieve much
meaningful progress on these same
issues. Next time you go to the bath
room, take a look around. Today, 1
counted no fewer than 26 fliers in my
stall, all advocating the same things.
Reform meal plans and make late
night dining options available on
weekends. Great — but not going to
happen. The ASSU has zero control
over Residential & Dining Enter
prises. The Senate can pass resolu
tion after resolution calling for these
changes, but the administration has
no reason to listen to them and, judg
ing from experience, won't.
My favorites are those people who
claim that they will '.'improve student
life.? What on earth does that mean?
Here's a way to improve my life,
buster: Think of something achiev
able that you would do to if elected
before you put up your little fliers.
There are several institutional
reasons why elected candidates will
not get anything done. First, they
have no incentive to do so. Elected
officials in government get things
done because they want to be re
elected. ASSU executive slates
never run again and senators rarely
do. So once somebody is elected, he
or she has no motivation to actually
get out there and improve my life.
It's sad, but true.
The other main reason why noth
ing gets done is that the ASSU has a
limited budget, in comparison to
Stanford's, and has little statutory
control over any meaningful Univer
sity policy and thus has little power.

Can the Senate extend the hours of
Green library by decree? No. Can
the Senate mandate a reduced tu
ition bill or lower course reader
prices from the Bookstore? No.
What the ASSU can do is ?work
with administrators to help address
these problems? How many times
have you heard this before? And
how many times will you hear it be
fore you realize where the ASSU?s
power and function really lies?
The ASSU is an elaborate mech
anism for funding student groups
and creating community here on
campus. In no way am I trying to
trivialize the role that the ASSU fills
— indeed, it is vital to creating and
maintaining a thriving and healthy
community here on the Farm.
All I'm asking is for you not to be
fooled by promises of progress in
arenas that are out of the scope of
the ASSU.
And for whom you vote does
matter, immeasurably. While there
are not two dominant competing
viewpoints within the undergradu
ate Senate as there are in the U.S.
Senate, your vote will have a huge
impact on the person you vote for.
With a campus this small, odds
are that you know a number of peo
ple who are running for one office or
another. Vote for them. Vote for
your friends. They've decided it's
worth their time and money to go
through this campaign process, so
reward them by voting for them, and
then tell them you've done so. It will
make their day.
I know this, because 1, Nick
Fram, am running with three other
brilliant people for senior class pres
ident. Vote for me, not because I'm
going to make it so that you can opt
out of your meal plan — nobody can
do that for you — but because I
know how the ASSU's powers can
be best utilized: creating fun stuff for
you.
And vote for your friends.
Hi, I'm your new friend Nick.

And please do vole. It's easy and re
warding and you might be entered to
win an iPod. Kidding. But you really
have no excuse not to vote at
ballot.stanford.edu or e-mail Nick at
ndfram@stanford. edit.
