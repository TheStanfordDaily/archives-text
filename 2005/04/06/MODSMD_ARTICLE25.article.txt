'Gene pool' column 'disgusting'
Glenn Truitt's column, "The
Shallow End of the Gene Pool"
(April 5), was easily the most dis
gusting and offensive piece I have
ever read in The Daily. The refer
ence to typical Wal-Mart shoppers
(which popular opinion over
whelmingly holds to be poor mi
norities) as "the snallow end of the
gene pool"; the reference to their
"minimum-wage stare"; the sugges
tion that "the one thing the
wretched masses seem to be really
good at is reproducing"; and many
other similar comments are nothing
but shallow, barely concealed clas
sism and racism.
This column accomplishes noth
ing except to reinforce negative
stereotypes of underprivileged mi
norities, who, in many cases, have
no choice but to shop at Wal-Mart.
The fact that it is presented as a
comedy piece is even more offensive
since it creates a bogus sense of com
fortable intimacy between the au
thor and the audience.
This creates the illusion that the
audience privately shares the au
thor's racism, and that it's all a bit of
a wink-and-a-nod joke, thus making
it seem more acceptable while fur
ther reinforcing class and racial divi
sions.
How did this article make it past
the editors at The Daily? How could
any supposedly respectable newspa
per print this disgusting diatribe? I
have already asked fora refund
from the ASSU for my fees support
ing The Daily, which I will never
support again. 1 firmly believe
Glenn Truitt's tenure at the newspa
per should be terminated, that both
he and The Daily owe the public an
apology, and furthermore that the
editors should hand in their resigna
tions, since this article's publication
is a sign that they have no business
running a newspaper.
Of course, what it says about the
Stanford community at large — that
a graduate student at the Law
School would think this piece was
acceptable and that The Daily
would be willing to print it — is an
even more worrisome issue.
