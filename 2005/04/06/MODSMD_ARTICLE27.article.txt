## Editorial Carr / Castillo best choice for ASSU 
### 
In national presidential elections, the electorate
often chooses between less-than-ideal choices —
and the upcoming ASSU executive election looks to
be no different. While there are faults in every candi
date, we believe the best choice is Victoria Carr and
Fernando Castillo as they offer the most passion for
the ASSU and the most attainable agenda.
The three slates offer a diversity of knowledge
and experience, but none of the slates have full
knowledge of the campus issues. When The Daily's
editorial board interviewed the slates about their
platforms, they were sometimes vague and unaware
of the details. Given the number of promises we hear
repeated year after year, executive candidates ought
to be able to explain how they plan to address issues
and solve problems, so we won't be hearing the same
thing next year.
In addition, the agendas of the slates are extraor
dinarily similar. Kannokada /Okonkwo and Carr/
Castillo both offer improvements to NomCom, more
24-hour study space and easier access to recreational
athletic space. When it comes to a far-reaching vision,
neither of the "serious" slates differ. And even the
Avalanche of Diversity's desire for personal profit is
likely shared on some level by all the candidates.
Still, of the slates, Carr / Castillo stand the best
chance of accomplishing the goals they set forth.
Overall, they offer a smaller platform, allowing them
to focus and achieve their goals. Goals such as a lead
ership summit for Voluntary Student Organizations
and a more defined freedom-of-speech policy are
both laudable and realizable. Melanie Kannokada
and Aneto Okonkwo offer over 12 different agenda
points that they say University administrators have
committed to address. But the details of these com

mitments are uncertain. Such a large agenda will he
too difficult to achieve. While ambition is worthy of
our applause, it is often the case that when slates
promise a sizeable agenda they become over
stretched complete less.
Because of the similarity of the slates' platforms,
their commitment to the position becomes increas
ingly important. Carr and Castillo have pledged to be
on campus this summer and take minimal course
loads next year. Kannokada and Okonkwo were not
able to give the same assurances. This slate believes
their better time management skills will allow them
to handle larger course loads. However, past ASSU
officers' experiences have shown that even the most
time-efficient individuals have difficulty balancing
ASSU and class responsibilities. The need to have
representatives often available and consistently
working on issues heavily favors Carr / Castillo.
Also, Carr and Castillo have the best working re
lationship. In the editorial board's interviews, they
clearly got along well. As the ASSU executives spend
significant amounts of time together, this relationship
is more important than it seems. In past years when
relationships have not been as strong, infighting oc
curred that divided the ASSU and its political capital.
This is less likely to happen under Carr / Castillo.
Let us not forget the Avalanche of Diversity slate.
In meeting with the slate, it became abundantly clear
that they did not have the emotional stability to han
dle the rigors of the position; presidential candidate
Rishi Chanderraj came close to tears.
While it is unfortunate that we are not endorsing
one slate wholeheartedly, Victoria Carr and Fernan
do Castillo offer the best opportunity for the student
government lor the next year.

Cardinal t/CO 4 I
Ballet Company: Ytu J
Total Special-Fees Request:
$13,860.00
Yearly Fee Per Student: $2.60
Cardinal Ballet Company is an
accomplished group of classically trained
dancers who perform both for the Stanford
campus and for neighboring communities.
Voting for Cardinal Ballet to receive special
fees supports their request for $13,860 to put
on their two major performances of the year
and invite guest choreographers to expose the
community to new forms of dance. Although
the group does some outside fundraising, we
encourage Cardinal Ballet to seek more
sources for funds to expand the scope of
programming.

Total Special-Fees Request:
$13,925.78
Yearly Fee Per Student: $2,61
The Muslim Student Awareness
Network, or MSAN, sponsors speaker series,
film festivals and Islamic cultural events that
are open to all students at Stanford. Its goals
of promoting awareness of Muslim issues
and increasing the understanding of Islamic
faith and culture at Stanford have been well
served by events such as Islam awareness
month, the Iraqi film festival, Fastathon and
Ramadan dinner. We hope MSAN continues
to reach out to the Stanford community and
support their $13,926 special fees request.

Movimiento Estudiantil urft
Chicano de Aztlan: Y H)

Total Fee Request: $30,872
Yearly Fee Per Student: $5.78
MEChA is requesting $30,872 to help
fund Chicano Latino events and organiza
tions. Some of the assistance goes to funding
Dia de Los Muertos, Cesar Chavez Com
memoration, Ballet Folklorico and many
more. These are events that have become part
of the Stanford culture and assist in creating a
welcome community for all. The MEChA
request is financially responsible and is only
for events that can benefit the entire Stanford
community. Also, the organization has made
a substantial effort to seek outside funding.
For these reasons, MEChA deserves our
endorsement.

Axe Committee: |\||J
V
Total Special-Fees Request: $7,680.00
Yearly Fee Per Student: $1.44
After not receiving special fees for this
academic year, the Axe Committee sought
outside funding from various university offices
to coordinate the Big Game Pep Rally, boost
school spirit, and cheer on sports teams
throughout the year. We are in full support of
school spirit but encourage the Axe Committee
to again tap other campus resources for fund
ing as it attempts to regain the Stanford Axe
from Cal. Furthermore, other student resources
like the Office of Freshman and Transfer
students should be encouraged provide further
funding to groups like the Axe Committee,
which serve the overall morale of the Farm.
Stanford VCO -ki
Dance Marathon: Y (u
Total Special-Fees Request: $21,509.00
Yearly Fee Per Student: $4.03
Dance Marathon not only represents a
tremendous fund-raising opportunity, but also
serves as a campus event that appeals to all
Stanford students and community members.
As such, we feel the need to affirm the poten
tial for Dance Marathon to grow in the years to
come. We disagree with the ASSU's stance in
denying special-fees to Dance Marathon; on
the contrary, we feel that the group should not
be penalized for its resourcefulness in seeking
outside funding for the first year of its exis
tence. Nevertheless, the group could do more
in expanding the scope of the event by organiz
ing more education programs in a week-long
awareness drive, for instance. The group
« should also aim to be more modest in its spend
ing by putting up an event on a scale that is in
keeping with its budget.

Scientific Review: 7 PO "W
Total Fee Request: $9,000
Yearly Fee Per Student: $1.69
The Stanford Scientific Review twice a
year produces a journal that covers recent
scientific discoveries as well as ongoing
scientific debates. Its entire special-fee budget
pays for the journal's printing costs. In addi
tion, the scientific review raises one-fourth of
its buduet from outside sources. The unique
ness an undergraduate-produced science
journal, as well as the efforts to raise outside
funds, warrant an endorsement. In future years
it may consider ways to reduce its printing
costs, including using less color.

For over 15 years, The Stanford Daily has endorsed groups that apply for special fees in
the ASSU elections. The purpose of this special section is to help the student body make informed
voting decisions about the 42 groups applying for special fees this year.
Last year, the editorial board chose not to print endorsements for special-fees groups. This
year, the board focused on those groups that had not decisively passed or decisively failed to
obtain special fees - i.e., groups that received between 45 and 55 percent "yes" votes - and on
groups new to the ballot. Whenever possible, the editorial board conducted interviews with group
representatives in addition to examining their budgets.
Our decisions were based on three criteria: 1) whether a substantial proportion of students
benelit from the group, 2) whether the group's special-fees money will pay for activities that
contribute to campus life and 3) whether the group has made a good-faith effort to exhaust outside
sources of funding.
Our endorsements are in no way absolute: students should read the on-line elections hand
book (http://elections.stanford.edu/handbook) and vote for groups that they believe have a posi
tive effect on student life at Stanford. We hope that this section will help students make more
informed choices.

Measure A: YES*!
Measure A will consolidate the Programming General Fee and the Community Service
General Fee into a single Programming and Community Service General Fee. According to
ASSU Senate Chair Chris Lin, the Senate - responding to group demand - has consistently
spent more than the money allotted for programming and spent less than the money allotted for
community service. This measure will help give the Senate greater flexibility and to distribute
money in a way that better reflects student wants. However, community service is and should
remain an important part of Stanford life, and we hope that the Senate will continue to keep its
eye on the distribution between programming and community service funds and reassess the
situation should they fall unhealthily out of balance.

Stanford Film Society: YES *
Total Special-Fees Request: $34,485.00
Yearly Fee Per Student: $6.46
The Stanford Film Society, which hosts
numerous film festivals and puts on various
screenings throughout the year, deserves
special-fees money because of what it adds to
the Stanford community. Though the society
could probably use the money it gets more
efficiently, we feel that its events — especially
the United Nation Association Film Festival
and the Student Film Festival — are both
popular with students and necessary to
Stanford's cultural scene. We encourage the
society to be proactive in its search for outside
funding, but we nonetheless support its request
for special-fees money as well.

Martial Arts Program: «
Total Special-Fees Request: $32,669.82
Yearly Fee Per Student: $6.12
Serving more than 300 students and
spanning disciplines including capoeira,
taekwondo and kickboxing, we support the
Stanford Martial Arts Program's mission state
ment of preserving martial arts as a part of
campus culture, as well as educating the com
munity about the various styles. The majority
of the special fees amount requested will be
allocated towards honoraria, as stated by their
budget, which may allow the groups to invite
martial arts experts to give demonstrations and
workshops on campus. Although this seems to
be a reasonable use of student fees, we strongly
recommend that more efforts be made on
behalf of the various martial arts groups to
better publicize and increase the number of
events open to the entire campus. We look
forward to seeing more of their presence on
campus and hope these fees will enable
improved community interaction with the
program as a whole.
Stanford Progressive: YES *
Total Special-Fees Request: $10,500.00
Yearly Fee Per Student: $1.97
The Stanford Progressive is the only
political publication on campus that is
University-based and (officially, at least) non
partisan in nature. We applaud the
Progressive's efforts to experiment with differ
ent content and layout designs while working
within budgetary constraints — the magazine
has seen an extraordinary amount of improve
ment this academic year. We understand that
the Progressive needs special-fees funding to
establish a financial base for future publica
tions. However, we hope that the organization
will take serious steps toward financial
self-sufficiency.

Stanford Shakespeare YtS *
i " J
Total Special-Fees Request: $15,809.00
Yearly Fee Per Student: $2.96
The Stanford Shakespeare Society puts
on multiple performances of various Shake
speare plays throughout the year, and these
performances take place in different campus
locations - some traditional, some unique. We
feel that the society deserves special-fees
money because it adds some much needed
culture to our campus. The performances are
always heavily attended by students and are
free for both Stanford affiliates and other, non-
Stanford attendees. In addition, the society's
experimentation with non-traditional spaces
for its performances, such as the History
Corner and Old Union, as well as an upcoming
performance at the Cantor Arts Center are
praiseworthy.

Stanford Solar klfl
Car Project: l*U r
Total Special-Fees Request: $30,850.00
Yearly Fee Per Student: $5.78
The Stanford Solar Car Project builds a
new solar car every two year and races it in the
North American and World Solar Challenges.
While this is an exciting project for those
involved, we are not convinced that the student
body outside of the group's 30 members derive
any real benefit from the project - and espe
cially from the car, which is what the special
fees money pays for. We applaud the group's
current plans fora lecture series and a student
initiated course, but these outreach events are
not being paid for by the project's special fees
and we cannot justify spending $30,000 on 30
students.

Stanford Chaparral: YES *
Total Special-Fees Request: $25,321.25
Yearly Fee Per Student: $4.74
The Chappie requests $2,000 fora Web
server and another $23,000 for publishing
costs, with an additional $6,000 in budgeted
expenses offset by ad revenue and Stanford
Fund money. It publishes six issues a year as
well as a fake edition of the Daily. As the
campus's only designated humor magazine, it
fills a much-needed role for irreverence and
hijinx in Stanford's publication mix (not to
mention certain ASSU elections). That being
said, it would be appreciated if more effort was
devoted to making the Chappie's "distinctive"
brand of humor more accessible to the rest of
campus; being consistently funny docs not
equal pandering, and sometimes (most times,
actually) an unfunny joke really is an unfunny
joke.
