# Cool Products Expo to display cutting edge tools
## 
### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE 
Toyota, General Motors and Honda are just a
few of the companies that will be represented at
this year's Cool Product Expo taking place today
from 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. in McCaw Hall of the
Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center.
The Cool Product Expo, or CPE, was created in
2001 by former business and engineering students
Greg Lamps and Dan Ostrower and former busi
ness student Dave Lyon, all Class of 2001. They
said created the expo to show students that there is
"more to life than the Internet."
"The Cool Product Expo celebrates products
that represent real advancement in product design
or innovation," said second-year Business School
student Filippo Vadda, president of the Product
Design and Manufacturing Club and head of this
year's CPE.
Coordinators said they hope that this year's
event will be as successful as in years past.
"About 1,000 people participated in last year's
Expo," Vadda said. "Around two-thirds were stu
dents, mainly from the Graduate School of Busi
ness and engineering."
According to the CPE Web site, organizers
used four criteria to choose "cool" companies and
products for the event: the product must be an
end-user item, or not a component of a larger
product; the product's "coolness" must be readily
apparent; the product must be radically new; and
the product must have a function that combines
the best of design and manufacturing.
Second-year Business School student Bryan
Gregory, vice-president of the Product Design and
Manufacturing Club, said the CPE is designed to
benefit all students.
"Anytime we can bring leaders of industry to
Stanford, it provides a great opportunity to moti

vate and turn on our student body to the chal
lenges of tomorrow," he said. "The event is an in
credible opportunity for the top creative minds in
industry to mingle with and show off their cre
ations to tomorrow's talent. Not to mention, it's
just plain fun."
One invention that will likely garner attention
is Daimler-Chrysler's F-Cell Fuel Cell Mercedes
Benz, an electric-motored car powered by com
pressed oxygen. With top speeds of about 90 mph,
the concept car can travel roughly 100 miles on two
kilograms of compressed hydrogen.
Another notable innovation is the rolling carry
all ZUCA — a large backpack with wheels — cre
ated by a company of the same name based in San
Jose. According to the Web site, ZUCA President
Laura Udall aims to help lighten kids and adults'
loads "one back at a time." The new apparatus
could someday replace backpacks, workout bags
and can even carry laptops and heavy books. The
futuristic-looking ZUCA comes in four fashionable
styles: chili, construction. Malibu and obsidian.
With these and other new product develop
ments, Gregory hopes that the Expo will whet the
creative appetites of business and engineering stu
dents.
"[We also want to] show all the attendees the
power of a great idea," he said. "With the Wal-
Marts of the world dominating the business land
scape by beating everyone on costs, it seems pret
ty clear that product differentiation and innova
tion is a key way for entrepreneurs to show their
value to customers. The expo hits at the heart of
that idea."
The CPE is hosted by the student-run Stanford
Graduate School of Business Product Design and
Manufacturing Club and is sponsored by the Al
liance for Innovative Manufacturing, made up of
both students and professionals.
