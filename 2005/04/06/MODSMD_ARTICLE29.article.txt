# One night stands leave behind commitment
## 
### OMAR RASCHID DAILY ORANGE 
(U-WIRE) SYRACUSE, N.Y. â€”The old
equation, though a cliche, seems to be true.
Take two hormonally charged students, add a
splash of alcohol, a sprinkling of non-commit
ment, and the common product will usually be
a one-night stand. As there is a never ending
supply of both alcohol and willing participants,
college campuses certainly see their fair share
of the momentary mambo.
However, make no mistake of the power of
the one-night stand. This isn't some half-way
hook-up. The term one-night stand implies the
full monty, the big show or going all the way. The
key factor in determining a one-shot, however, is
a clean break afterward. The one-night stand is
viewed as pure, unadulterated non-committal
sex, with absolutely no later entanglements.
While there are the obvious exceptions, the
common consensus seems to be that the event
can have very different perceptions from each
member of the party. One side may think this
is the beginning of something serious, while
the other may see the activities as a mere mid
night snack.
"I think that, in my experience, one-night
stands are very different things for girls and
guys," said Alisha Ricardi, a junior magazine
major. "Girls are more open to continuing re
lationships. Guys are more comfortable with

hanging a girl fora night."
Many believe the reasons for this differenti
ation stem from a variety of factors. First, pop
ular belief still pervades that women are more
emotional than men. and therefore the sexual
act is deemed more monumental and not to be
wasted on a simple one-night tryst. It is seen as
an investment toward something deeper,
rather than a single evening's transaction. This
type of thought process can then lead to the
aforementioned problem where one contes
tant in the horizontal hip-twist assumes the act
is the first of many in an ongoing relationship.
Disparity can cause a number of problems
within the pseudo-relationship when one
member of the duo is seeking ways to desper
ately cut off future connections.
"I've definitely seen people looking for dif
ferent things in a one-night stand," said Amie
Owen, a sophomore business and communica
tions major. "Some people go into it looking for
a relationship. When they aren't looking for the
same thing, they will get different results."
Both men and women have used their fare
share of tactics to get rid of a one-night
standee who hopes to turn it into something
more. Not answering calls, feigning illness,
changing instant messenger names, blatantly
ignoring and even conjuring non-existent sig
nificant others are popular tactics students
have employed to get the message across.
"People take things differently going into a

one-night stand," said Greg Cignavitch, a
sophomore computer science major. "It's too
bad when one gets the wrong impression."
While one-night stands may have different
expectations for each participant, there are yet
more reasons why they occur in the first place.
However, there is still a disparity between tem
porary temptresses and single-use studs as to
the reasons why such behavior happens. Fears
of commitment, stress-free fun and general
drunkenness are cited as explanations for the
popularity of one-night stands as an accepted
way to occupy one's evening.
"They're fine by me," Cignavitch said. "As
long as you have two consenting parties, 1
don't see what's wrong with it. People want to
get busy."
According to many students, the act of get
ting busy usually involves copious amounts of
alcohol. Students said that whilst imbibing
their preferred beverages, inhibitions are
lower. These marginalized inhibitions have
two different effects. First, increased confi
dence to make the move; second, less rationale
to say no to the augmented advances. A literal
mating of both of these effects gives birth to
the one-night stand.
"People get drunk and things get out of con
trol," said Steve Cooper, a senior international
relations and history major. "I think a lot of one
night stands are alcohol-related. That's when
hormones are flowing and inhibitions are low

ered."
"People get drunk, and they don't know
what they hell they're doing," Owen said.
Yet another factor for the prevalence of
these single-night screws seems to be plain and
simple revenge. Many students said that the
easiest way to either get over a past love or to
get hack at a previous mate is to go forth in
search of meaningless sex.
Passionate, no-strings attached copulation
is a common way to release stress and make
one feel better about oneself. To a variety of
students, sex is seen as the ultimate compli
ment. If one is willing to do the deed with an
other, it usually indicates that the "chosen
one" has somehow made the grade. For many
students, permission to board the mothership
is a boost to one's ego. This rise in self-esteem
is all-important if one has just been spurned by
a former flame.
"I've definitely seen one-night stands as a
rebound after a girlfriend," Cignavitch said
Whatever the reason, one-night stands are a
mainstay and vital component to the college
experience. Whether by way of alcohol, hor
mones, or just plain revenge, the one-night or
gasmo is a common feature on the Hill, and
thus further propagates notions of the non-ex
istence of normal relationships on campus.
"There is definitely a lot of hooking up
going on, that's for sure," Ricardi said. "There
must be a fear of commitment on this campus."
