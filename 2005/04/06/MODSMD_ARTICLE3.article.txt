## Stanford graduate dies 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Spend an unplanned weekend in Paris.
Cook like Wolfgang Puck. Set up a scholar
ship for high school students. Play guitar like
John Mayer. Dan Jacobs, an economics
major of the Class of 2003, included these
items on a white-board list of things he want
ed to do before he died about a week prior
to his death.
On the evening of March 6, the 24-year
old Robbinsdale, Minn., native suffered a
fatal attack of arrhythmia, an irregularity in
the heart's rhythm, in his San Francisco
apartment. He had no serious heart prob
lems in the past.

"Dan was incredibly
devoted to his friends
and work," said Jacobs'
girlfriend, Marisa Anz.
"He gave all of himself
to everything he was in
volved in. He was always
trying to make someone
else's life better."
He had a gift for
making others realize

what they had in their lives and reminded
them to enjoy it, Anz said, also Class of 2003.
"1 think that after we graduate we some
times forget all the opportunities we've been


Dan Jacobs
given at Stanford," she added. "Dan
never did and he made the most of
every opportunity."
Jonathan Olsen, also Class of
2004 and Jacobs' roommate in San
Francisco, noted that Jacobs was ex
tremely capable but humble.
"Dan was a self-made person,"
Olsen said. "Yet he was never inter
ested in his accomplishments; he was
an easy going person you couldn't
help enjoy being around because he
was so focused on other people. He
had his priorities right very early on
in his life. That fact is reflected in
everything that he did. He knew
where he wanted to go and really fo
cused on his friends."
Far/.ad Soleimani, a second-year
medical student, emphasized that Ja
cobs lived his life with integrity.
"What made Dan really special
was the fact that he was very trust
worthy," Soleimani said. "He was
open to his friends and I trusted him
with my life and the things that were
happening to me."
Soleimani and Jacobs became
best friends after rooming together
for two years as Stanford undergrad
uates. Soleimani recalled many great
memories with Jacobs, including or
ganizing a pre-party for Full Moon
on the Ouad. taking skiing and golf
ing trips, discussing plans to start a
beer company together and sam
pling Jacobs' gourmet cooking.
"I will miss him being here with
us," Soleimani said. "We had so
many dreams. We had wanted to do
a lot of stuff together and share our
successes with each other. I wish we
could have done that."
Soleimani said that Jacobs re
mained determined and strong even

through tough times, like the death
of his mother during junior year of
college.
"1 was always so proud of Dan be
cause he dealt with his mother's
death very strongly," Soleimani said.
"His mom was basically the only sup
port he had. It was very honorable
the way Dan managed to graduate
and get a job in investment banking
that allowed him to be as indepen
dent as possible."
Jacobs told Olsen how apprecia
tive he was for his life experiences.
According to Olsen, the two most
defining moments in Jacobs' life
were being accepted to Stanford and
getting into Stanford's Fleet Street
Singers group. Jacobs also planned
to one day create a scholarship for
students from his high school, so that
others could entertain Stanford as a
life-altering choice as it was for him.
Olsen said it is challenging to see
a silver lining when it comes to the
loss of someone so young.
"I am thankful that I am able to
look at Dan as an example of how we
can all be â€” appreciative of the mo
ment and all the things that we
have," Olsen said. "Good friends
from Stanford can have an impact on
how we approach life. I think that
Dan's attitude was outstanding and
taught me a lot about how to live
life."
While at Stanford, Jacobs was the
president of Alpha Kappa Psi from
2002 to 2(K)3, a perf(>rmer in the Stan
lord Fleet Street Singers and house
manager of Yost. He also worked
part-time during his sophomore, ju
nior and senior years at U.S. Ban
corp Piper Jaffray. Jacobs was work
ing in private equity investment
banking at Harris Williams in San
Francisco prior to his death.
There will a memorial service for
Jacobs at 4 p.m. tomorrow at Stan
lord's Memorial Church.
