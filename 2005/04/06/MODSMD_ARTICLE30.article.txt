# PA makes bid for stem cell institute
## 
### ADAM WIDMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Palo Alto recently bid to become the
home for the California Institute for Regen
erative Medicine, or CIRM, the agency that
will distribute and manage stem cell research
funds granted under California Proposition
71, which passed in November.
The measure gave CIRM the responsibil
ity of distributing over $3 billion to research
institutions. A selection committee will rec
ommend a location for the CIRM on April
22, and the CIRM's employees will begin
working at its permanent location in mid-
August.
The state requested that cities interested
in housing the CIRM offer to lease land and
about 17,(MK) square feet of office space at lit
tle or no cost. Officials said the chosen loca
tion should house the CIRM for at least 10
years.
If its bid is successful, Palo Alto plans to
lease part of the Stanford Research Park and
use it as office space to accommodate 50
CIRM employees. Although the offices will
be on Stanford land, the University will not

be involved in the deal. Any undue involve
ment with the agency could bar the Univer
sity from applying for research funds.
The CIRM would bring few immediate
economic benefits to Palo Alto, said Irv
Weissman. professor of cancer biology and
director of Stanford's Institute of Cancer/
Stem Cell Biology and Medicine. He esti
mates that the combined salaries of the
CI RM employees will be less than $y million
a year.
However, city council members suggest
ed that the CIRM could add to Palo Alto's
prestige and make the city an attractive loca
tion for growing biotech industries.
"We're looking at this as a long-term in
vestment in the economic health of the
area." said Susan Arpan. Palo Alto's manag
er for economic development and redevel
opment. in a March IS Palo Alto Weekly ar
ticle.
Palo Alto possesses a number of traits
that make it a desirable location for the
CIRM, Weissman said. A number of promi
nent CIRM individuals already live in the
Bay Area, and Palo Alto's proximity to Stan
ford would allow CI RM staff to easilv attend

research functions and lectures at the Uni
versity and keep track of progress made in
stem eel! technology, he added.
These advantages are matched by few
other cities in California and make Palo Alto
one of few places that seem likely to host the
CIRM. Weissman said.
"La Jolla, the San Francisco Bay Area
and Los Angeles are the only other real con
tenders that could provide the educational
update opportunities for the CIRM staff,"
he added.
While the CIRM could have a major eco
nomic impact on Palo Alto and other local
communities, Weissman said he thinks that
its presence in Palo Alto would have only a
minimal affect on Stanford's ability to pro
cure state funds for stem cell research.
"All grants will be judged on merit by
peer review groups solely or mainly from out
of state,"he said. "Proximity should not af
fect scoring of research, facilities or clinical
trials grants."
Weissman said that even if the CIRM se
lects Palo Alto, Stanford would have no ad
vantage in securing research funds and that
"it would be improper if it could."
