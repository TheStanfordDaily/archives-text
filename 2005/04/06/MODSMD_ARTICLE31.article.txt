# Urbana-Champaign students find news ways to make fake IDs
## 
### DAVID VALDES DAILY ILLINI 
(U-WIRE) CHAMPAIGN, 111 — It is
no secret that many underage students use
fake ID cards.
If the fake is good enough, they can get
underage students past the campus bars'
bouncers and into their favorite nighttime
hot spots. With the bars' high level of pop
ularity on campus, University of Illinois
students are finding ways to obtain fake
I Ds and, apparently, they are not that hard
to come by.
In order to report this story an
anonymous source was used. He said he
makes fake IDs for college students and
that they are easy to make with a little
help from eßay, Photoshop, and
Kinko's.
"Go on eßay and buy a fifty stack of
PVC cards," the source said. "After you
do that, you can go to Kinko's. Thev have
white or clear sticky-back paper."
The source said to use Photoshop and
to scan the picture onto the over-21-year
old's ID.
"You can print the image of the ID on
the clear or white paper and put that on
the PVC card," the source said. "And you
have your ID."
The source also said that he uses an ID
book that most bars and even banks use as
a reference to ensure that water marks
and seals are added if needed,
"You can make a really good ID or
you can have a piece of paper stuck to a
PVC card," the source said. "There are
varying degrees of how to do it. At a
school in the city (Chicago) where bars
are the only place (students) can go, you
can get someone to pay you $150 if (the
fake ID card) is good enough."
The source added that for students on
campuses like the University of Illinois.

he usually charges about $75. He said this
is because there are other outlets for
nightlife aside from the bars, and students
are not willing to pay that much fora fake
ID card.
The source compared the process of
producing and selling fake ID cards to the
business of selling drugs. The source said
his profits, upwards of $5,000, were
enough to live on.
" 1 never had a job my freshman year of
college," he said. "1 never needed one."
Not all fake IDs. however, are good
enough.
Kevin Casey, doorman at The
Clybourne and sophomore at Illinois,
said that he spots about 10 fake IDs a
week.
Casey said that there is no formal
training for doormen, but they are ex
pected to complete two courses that
teach them how to identify ID fraud at
the bars.
There is a rumor that females have an
easier time getting into bars with fake IDs
than male students do, and Casey admit
ted that he is aware of the bias toward
girls.
"I know some people might (be less
strict with females), but 1 know
Clybourne and C.O.'s (Daniels) cut down
on that." Casey said. "You're really not
supposed to do that. You're just supposed
to do your job."
Freshman Jose Paz said that a more le
nient fake ID and drinking policy is es
sential to the bars' success.
"I don't think there is any way that
there could possibly be as high of a turn
out if the bars actually enforced the
drinking policies and admittance poli
cies," Paz said. "People go to the bars to
drink. If they want to sit around and
chat they would go to a cafe or some
thing."
