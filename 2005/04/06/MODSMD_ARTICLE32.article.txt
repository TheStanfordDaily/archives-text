## Right in the Babymaker 2005 forecast: The usual in Chicago and a rematch of the '91 World Series 
### 
Oh, Major League Baseball, how I've
missed you. You raised eyebrows over
the winter with your steroid indiscre
tions and clumsy posturing, but I knew you'd
be back. Your slightly uglier cousin, the NFL.
has fallen by the wayside, and I managed to
overcome my sports-horny desperation and
avoided your slutty friend, the NBA. Like
every other April, it's time to re-evaluate what
this year has in store for our relationship.
Since only two teams exist in the American
League, it would be best to address them first.
The Yankees will win the East again, despite
having possibly the worst chemistry of any

team ever assembled, sur
passing the 2002 Giants, who
would have played in three
separate ballparks if they
could have. I know everyone
loves to get all misty over the
Red Sox' borderline-homo
erotic clubhouse environ
ment, but no amount of ca
maraderie will overcome the
Yankees' pitching staff.

Also, there are three other teams in this divi
sion; I believe one is from Canada, one is from
Tampa Bay and the other one is the Orioles
(I've been doing some research).
To answer your question: Yes. the Los An
geles Angels of Anaheim is the worst team
name in the history of organized sports, even
behind the Oklahoma Yard Dawgz, the Jack
sonville Lizard Kings and the North Texas
Mean Green, which sounds like a Little
League team sponsored by an industrial
cleaning solvent manufacturer. Keep in mind,
this is a franchise that is now on its fourth offi
cial title, without ever leaving the same region
— and it's only been around since 1961. How
ever, that will not stop them from winning the
AL West, just as it will not stop me from wish
ing the bubonic plague on owner Arte
Moreno for renaming the team.
The Twins will run away with the AL Cen
tral, which continues to exist as the American
League's version of soy farming — Midwest
ern, unsexy, altogether unappealing. This is a
division that includes the Tigers. Royals and
Indians, teams that if you combined them —
obviously, with an end product of one über
mediocre squad based in Indianapolis —
would not be able to compete in the East. In
fact. I'm pretty sure the Royals are just hiring
migrant workers to stand in the outfield,
which would still be an upgrade over Terrence
"the Himalayas were formed in less time than
it takes me to complete a full swing" Long.
In the National League, I'm going to go out
on a limb and pick Jake Peavy and the young
gun Padres to win the West. The Giants will
last just long enough for Barry Bonds to blame
the media for his knee injury before their out
fielders' skeletal structures turn to dust a la
Walter Donovan in Indiana Jones and the
Last Crusade. (Seriously, how old is Marquis
Grissom now? 60?) And as for the Dodgers,
they'll probably manage second place,
spurred forward by the 150 RBIs and .550
OBP of offensive powerhouse Hee Seop Choi
(Ha!).
The NL East is probably the most balanced
division in baseball, top to bottom... which
means nothing because the Braves are going
to take it again, and, as usual, it will be because
of their outstanding pitching and defense. The
Marlins and Mets are both teams that have the
potential to explode, with Florida having
probably the best non-Bobby-Cox-related
shot at winning the NL pennant. The Phillies
also warrant mentioning. Theoretically they
have an outside chance to win, but God hates
them because they play in Philadelphia and, to
a lesser extent, because Jimmy Rollins wears
his hat lopsided.
The Central Division ... well, the most ex
citing race in the NL Central will be between
the Pirates and Brewers for the title of "Least
Appealing Team to Root For Even Despite
Being a Small-Market Underdog." The Cardi
nals will win. and the Cubs —
"WOO! CUBS! THIS YEAR'S THE
YEAR! 2005 WORLD SERIES CHAMPI
ONS! WE BLEW UP THE BARTMAN
BALL! IT'S GONE FOREVER! PRIOR IS
HEALTHY NOW. MAN! I HAVE A SE
CRET PLAN TO ASSASSINATE AL
BERT PU — "
The Cubs will lose.
So the World Series will probably involve
the Braves and the Twins, assuming the Red
Sox collapse under the wave of endorphins
still seeping out of Boston from last October
and the Yankees become so massive that they
implode into a singularity of talent coated in
thousand-dollar bills and hormone residue.
Now. if you'll excuse me, I have to get start
ed on my "Tony Torcato for Pope" sign for the
upcoming Giants series.
