## CARDINAL STORM BACK TO BUCK BRONCOS 
### ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the Cardinal, Tuesday nights are supposed to be a
hit of a breather â€” a chance to face a local non-confer
ence opponent and give the younger guys some real-game
experience. As No. 10 Stanford has found out, however,
the midweek matchups aren't always the cakewalks that
many expect.
For the second straight Tuesday, the Cardinal were
challenged by a local team that conventional wisdom
would dictate has far less talent. Last week the Cardinal
fell 2-0 in 10 innings to the visiting Pacific Tigers. For the
first five innings last night it looked like the Cardinal
might be headed to another disappointing loss, but key
hits by freshman Brendan Domaracki and strong pitch
ing down the stretch propelled Stanford (18-9,3-0 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) to a 7-6 victory over the Santa Clara
. Broncos (14-16).
After falling behind 6-0, the Cardinal rallied with
seven unanswered runs in the fifth, sixth and seventh
innings.
This was the second straight week Stanford
struggled to pick up runs early despite having a
number of good opportunities. The Cardi
nal stranded four runners through the first
two innings without picking up a run.
