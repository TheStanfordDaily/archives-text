## CARDINAL STORM BACK TO BUCK BRONCOS 
### ALEX GYR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the Cardinal, Tuesday nights are supposed to be a
hit of a breather — a chance to face a local non-confer
ence opponent and give the younger guys some real-game
experience. As No. 10 Stanford has found out, however,
the midweek matchups aren't always the cakewalks that
many expect.
For the second straight Tuesday, the Cardinal were
challenged by a local team that conventional wisdom
would dictate has far less talent. Last week the Cardinal
fell 2-0 in 10 innings to the visiting Pacific Tigers. For the
first five innings last night it looked like the Cardinal
might be headed to another disappointing loss, but key
hits by freshman Brendan Domaracki and strong pitch
ing down the stretch propelled Stanford (18-9,3-0 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) to a 7-6 victory over the Santa Clara
. Broncos (14-16).
After falling behind 6-0, the Cardinal rallied with
seven unanswered runs in the fifth, sixth and seventh
innings.
This was the second straight week Stanford
struggled to pick up runs early despite having a
number of good opportunities. The Cardi
nal stranded four runners through the first
two innings without picking up a run.

"Sometimes we see a team that
we should beat on our schedule and
just automatically assume that we
can go out an they will lay over and
die, which is exactly the opposite he
cause they see Stanford on their
schedule and they want to come out
and take it to us," Domaracki said.
"They're playing their hardest and if
were not playing our hardest were
going to get behind like we did
tonight and it's going to take a good
effort to come from behind."
Domaracki played a pivotal role
in sparking the Cardinal comeback
by going 2-2 with a single and a triple
— the latter driving in the go-ahead
run in the bottom of the seventh.
With one out and freshman
Michael Taylor on first, Domaracki
smoked an offering from Broncos
pitcher Patrick Overholt down the
first base line into the rightfield cor
ner for an RBI stand-up triple.
Domaracki's pinch-hit single to
lead off the sixth started a four-run
Cardinal rally that tied the game at
six.
"You have to be ready to go all
game," Domaracki said. "You can't
just sit back and watch the game go
by. You really have to be mentally in
the game and be able to come in on
the spot to lead off an inning or drive
in a big run."
Santa Clara scored the first six runs
of the game, including four on one

swing of the hat hy designated hitter
Michael Thompson. Alter a double,
two free passes and an error by junior
first baseman John Mayberry, Jr.,
Thompson crushed the 3-1 pitch from
freshman pitcher Erik Davis over the
leftlield wall fora grand slam.
Davis, who was making his first
collegiate career start, pitched three
innings and gave up four unearned
runs and two hits to go along with his
one strikeout. Davis struggled with
his control, allowing three walks and
a hit batsman. The leadoff hitter
reached base in each of Davis' three
innings.
The Broncos used an inexperi
enced starter of their own in Adam
Sanabria. Sanabria, a senior transfer
from Florida, was making his first
start in a Santa Clara uniform. While
he had been used in 13 games this
season, all came in relief.
Sanabria looked like a veteran
starter for the first four innings as he
shut down a Cardinal attack that
scored 33 runs in three games last
weekend, giving up just three hits
and no runs.
However. Sanabria found trou
ble in the fifth as junior second base
man Jed Lowrie hit a grounder
sharply up the middle to score two
and put the Cardinal on the board. It
looked as if Santa Clara second
baseman Michael Lange might have
a chance to make the play, but the
ball bounced off the heel of his mitt
and rolled into the outfield, allowing
two runs to cross the plate.
The Broncos picked up two runs
more in the fourth to give them a 6-0
lead. After a single by left fielder

Ryan Chiarelli, third baseman Ryan
Conan attempted to lay down a sac
rifice bunt. Stanford sophomore
pitcher Jeff Stimpson came up with
the ball cleanly and made the throw
to second, but not in time to get the
speedy Chiarelli. Two batters later
that decision cost the Cardinal as a
bloop single by leadoff hitter Kevin
Drever drove in one. The Broncos
scored again later that inning to
build up a six-run lead.
But that would be the end of the
Santa Clara scoring as junior Matt
Manship, sophomore Greg
Reynolds and freshman Nolan Gal
lagher combined to hold the Broncos
scoreless for the final four frames.
Manship. one of the more experi
enced members of the Stanford relief
staff, looked especially strong, throw
ing two innings of scoreless ball.
"Every game is the same," Man
ship said. "You know your job and
you know what you have to do.
There is basically no substitute —
you have to shut them out. If you
don't shut them out, you never know
what is going to happen."
The six-run deficit was the largest
overcome by the Cardinal this sea
son, and the victory also marked their
seventh come-from-behind win.
"There are nine innings in the
game," Manship said. "If we don't
score in the first few. we know we
can score — we know we're capable
of doing it."
Stanford remains at home to face
No. 16 Oregon State Friday, Satur
day and Sunday, before taking on
San Francisco in next week's Tues
day night battle.
