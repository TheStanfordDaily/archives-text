the 100-meter breaststroke to earn a spot on
the 2005 World Championships Team.
"What Tara Kirk has done here at the
World Championship Trials really puts her
in good position for the next three years,"
Stanford head women's swimming coach
Richard Quick said in a release, referring to
the 2008 Olympics. 'Tm so proud of what
she has accomplished this year."
"I've never swept both breaststroke
event at a national meet, so I'm really excit
ed," said Kirk, who won the NCAA title in
the 100 breast all four years on the Farm
(going 35-0 in the event during that span)
and the 200 breast title in each of her last
three seasons.
Junior Kristen Caverly placed second in
the 200 breast in a personal-best time of
2:27.31 to earn her own spot on the World
Championships Team, while freshman Car
oline Bruce placed fifth and earned a spot
on the World University Games Team.

"I'm very proud of all three," Quick said
in the release. "It's obviously really good for
Stanford and says something about our pro
gram when we have three of the top five fin
ishers in a single event at a meet like the
World Championship Trials."
