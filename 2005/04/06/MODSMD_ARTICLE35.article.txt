# Card place ninth at ASU Invite
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Golf is a game of adjustments.
Tiny adjustments. Hardly percepti
ble, I-made-that-same-swing-last
time-but-it-went-straight adjust
ments. After a ninth-place finish out
of 17 teams at last weekend's ASU /
Ping Invitational, the No. 21 Cardi
nal women's golf team thinks it's
that close to breaking through with
its first team victory of the year.
With last week's third-place
showing at the Oregon Duck Invita
tional, this weekend's ninth-place
finish against a stacked field is just
the latest baby step toward a team
photo with some much-anticipated
hardware.
"I think we're really close," head
coach Caroline O'Connor said.
"There are a couple adjustments
that we've had to make, certainly we
need to make more birdies. Certain
ly there's no reason we shouldn't
win at home this week."
While Stanford contemplated
what might have been. No. 4 Ari
zona State (Golfstat Rankings) stole
the show at its own tournament,
edging No. 3 UCLA in a tiebreaker
for top team honors with a three-day
total of 870 (six over par). By the
event's end, the two teams were
playing in a tournament of their
own, as they each cleared the rest of
the field by 24 strokes.
And what a field it was. Of the 17
teams competing in Tempe, Ariz.,
11 were ranked in the nation's top
25, including the No. 3 (UCLA). No.
4 (Arizona State) and No. 5 (Pep
perdine) teams.
Despite their ninth-place finish,
the Cardinal found themselves just
six shots out of the top five at the end
of the weekend, against a field that is
likely the strongest they will face be
fore the NCAA Regional Champi
onship in May.
After struggling in their opening
round in Oregon the week before,
the Cardinal once again stumbled
out of the gate in Arizona, carding a
17-over-par 305, their worst round
of the tournament. Stanford stood in
ninth place after Friday's first
round.
"We're not entirely sure what the
problem is [with the slow starts),"
sophomore Jenni Tangtiphaiboon
tana said. "I guess because people
have seen that there's a pattern.

there might be a slight mental block,
but we're trying to figure our way
out of that."
Continuing her breakout year,
junior Kelly Husted led Stanford on
the first of three days of competition
with a three-over-par 75. Close on
her heels were sophomore Lauren
Todd and senior Wendra Liang,
who shot matching rounds of 76.
Tangtiphaiboontana and junior
Stephanie Lue each recorded a first
round 77. It is Lue's second tourna
ment since returning from a stress
fracture to her lumbar spine that
sidelined her for all but two tourna
ments before last week. Her ar
rival has been a shot in the arm fora
team that had just five active players
during her absence.
In six rounds of action, Lue's
score has counted toward the team
total each time. In order to count, a
player's score must be one of the
four best out of the team's five play
ers.
After posting a score of 300 in
Saturday's second round. Stanford
slipped one spot to 10th place and
trailed front-running UCLA by 27
shots with Sunday's round remain
ing.
In their final 18 holes, the Cardi
nal finally got comfortable, firing a
seven-over-par 295. Husted charged
up the leader board with a one-over
par 73, tying her for 11th place indi
vidually: it was her seventh consecu
tive top-25 finish in eight events this
year. Only a double-bogey on her
54th and final hole of competition
kept her out of the top 10.
"Eliminating the dumb mistakes
is basically the main thing fora lot of
us," Husted said. "I think every
body's game is really good right
now-it just comes down to managing
the courses better."
Todd followed close behind with a
74, locking up a 20th-place finish
her third consecutive visit to the top
25.
Tangtiphaiboontana matched
Husted's 73 in a round that included
just two bogeys, as she claimed 45th
place.
Lue's final-round 75 left her a
stroke behind her teammate, tied
for 46th. Liang's final round was de
railed by a dreadful front-nine 44, en
route to an 81. She finished in 65th
place. Sophomore Jenna Seki, com
peting as an individual, shot 84-79-
81 to tie for 86th.
