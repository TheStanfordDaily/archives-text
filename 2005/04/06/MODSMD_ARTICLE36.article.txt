hall team shook off a loss to UCLA

give the team some momentum head

key kills. Meredith finished the match
with 12 kills while Jones had three.
The Cal squad, which features
basketball forward Rod Benson,
notched its only win of the night in
game three, jumping to a 12-7 lead
that it would not relinquish in a 30-25
victory. Benson tallied three kills but
finished with a -.125 hitting percent
age. Albrecht Glitz, the NCCVL

percentage. Freshman Matt Wahl tal
