# Contest promotes conservation
## 
### SAM FLOAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Great Annual Stanford Energy Bowl and
Water Derby kicked off on April 1, marking the official
start of what contest organizers said they hope will be
come a new Stanford tradition. The dorm that reduces
its energy and water consumption by the largest per
centage, relative to that of last year, will be declared the
winner of the competition.
Students fora Sustainable Stanford and Residential
& Dining Enterprises are coordinating the event,
themed "Do it in the Dark," which will run until May
27. Although these organizations have worked to pro
mote conservation in the past, this is the first time that
such a contest has been organized.

A similar event was held during the 2(XX)-2001
school year for houses on the Row and in the Cowell
Cluster, which competed on energy reduction only.
This year the competition will only include residences
in Florence Moore, Roble, Lagunita, Wilbur, Stern,
Governor's Corner and Freshman Sophomore Col
lege. Next year the organizers hope to expand the
event to other dorms, co-ops and Row houses.
Standings will be announced halfway through the
competition and the winner will be declared at the end.
The winning dorm will receive a trophy and conserva
tion technologies, such as Energy Star refrigerators
and low-flow toilets. Every individual in the winning
dorm will also receive a thermos that can be used to re-

ceive discounts at several campus
eateries, including the CoHo and
Jamba Juice.
Members of Students fora Sus
tainable Stanford, such as freshman
Seth Silverman, said they hope to
make Stanford a community that
minimizes its negative ecological
impacts. The group also looks at en
vironmental issues and concerns
that transcend the Stanford campus.
"Mostly we are looking to
demonstrate how simple, un-intru
sive lifestyle changes and a bit of
raised consciousness regarding per
sonal habits can save huge amounts
of energy, water and money," Sil
verman said. "We're hoping that
framing it in the form of a competi
tion will create excitement."
He added that the plan is for the
competition to increase in scope
each year it is held.
"All it takes is for each individ
ual to consciously reduce their per
sonal energy and water consump
tion by doing easy things like turn
ing off the lights in the bathroom,
common areas and their room while
not in use; running only full loads of
laundry; and turning off appliances
and faucets when not in use."
The coordinators of the compe
tition are relying on the network of
dorm environmental representa
tives to spread the word across cam
pus and get people interested in the
event while minimizing the use of

flyers to save paper.
A comprehensive tip-sheet for
reducing energy and water con
sumption was distributed to each
participating dorm, and members
of Students fora Sustainable Stan
ford plan to visit dorms during
house meetings to drum up support.
Freshman Di Dang, environ
mental representative for Cardenal
in FloMo, has been posting infor
mational flyers and posting energy
conservation tips all over her dorm
to encourage her fellow residents to
conserve and recycle.
"1 consistently harass people to
recycle and attempt to guilt them
for throwing away recyclable mate
rials," Dang said. "I think the Water
Derby and Energy Bowl competi
tion is great because it encourages
students to be more careful about
their own water and energy con
sumption with prizes as incentives."
During the last fiscal year. Stu
dent Housing used 21.4 million kilo
watt hours of electricity, costing $2.5
million, and 217.5 million gallons of
water at a cost of $1.5 million. The
target usage amounts for Student
Housing this fiscal year are 22 mil
lion kilowatt hours of electricity and
220 million gallons of water.
Energy and water conservation
is a high priority for Student Hous
ing officials.
Larry Hoffman, the student
housing energy management and
building renewal program coordi
nator, said he works throughout the
year to complete energy and water
conservation retrofit projects
across campus. Some of the recent
projects include installing low-flow

showerheads, washing machines
and toilets, switching light fixtures
to more energy efficient lamps, and
replacing appliances with Energy
Star models.
"By encouraging students to be
come aware of energy uses, we can
partner them in their dormitories to
use these energy resources more
wisely," Hoffman said. "Addition
ally, managing our utility usage and
costs contributes to keeping room
rates lower and achieving our goal
of using energy and water resources
responsibly."
He added that housing officials
are optimistic about the competi
tion's ability to increase student
awareness of conservation issues.
Such contests are not unique to
Stanford. Ohio University holds a
similar event each year during
which students participate in eight
week long residence challenges,
and dorms with the greatest water
and energy use reductions win
prizes.
Coordinators of the Great An
nual Stanford Energy Bowl and
Water Derby said they hope to
demonstrate the impact of accumu
lated individual effort and provide
participants with simple, habit
forming changes for more sustain
able lifestyles.
"Of course to be successful such
an effort will require the participa
tion and involvement of the individ
ual members of Stanford's commu
nity," Silverman said. "1 know that
together we really can make a sig
nificant impact, and I hope that this
will show in the results of the com
petition at the end of May."
