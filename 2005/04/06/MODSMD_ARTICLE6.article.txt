The ASSU Undergraduate Senate assem
bled for its weekly meeting last night to review
several budget modifications. Also Elections
Commissioner Troy Steinmetz, a sophomore,
and several senators, discussed their hopes for
the ASSU election.
The primary focus of the meeting was to allo
cate funding to certain student groups for vari

of the Arts, the Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice. Bioscience Quarterly, Reorient
Magazine and the Student Alliance for Service

election would be a success if voter turnout is
higher than average which it very well could be,
given the highly competitive nature of this year's
elections."
Steinmetz agreed and said that he wanted
students' votes to be accurately reflected in the
election results.
"For me the biggest thing is that the will of
the voters is what happens," Steinmetz said.
"That's what my job is, to make sure that what
people voted and intended is what really hap
pened."
Steinmetz said that when something goes
wrong in an election — when the ASSU is most
visible to the student body — it might give stu
dents a negative impression of the governing
bodies.
"When you have an elections controversy, it
detracts from what the ASSU does," he said.
In regards to a potential election controversy,
Steinmetz said that if problems arise, they would
most likely result from individuals' campaign
behavior.
"The largest concern will be candidates' and
their supporters' actions over the next two
days," Steinmetz said. "Voters should hold can
didates accountable for their campaign actions."
