# Senate lays out election hopes, goals
## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate assem
bled for its weekly meeting last night to review
several budget modifications. Also Elections
Commissioner Troy Steinmetz, a sophomore,
and several senators, discussed their hopes for
the ASSU election.
The primary focus of the meeting was to allo
cate funding to certain student groups for vari
ous planned activities. Among these organiza
tions were the Student Organizing Committee
of the Arts, the Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice. Bioscience Quarterly, Reorient
Magazine and the Student Alliance for Service
through the Arts.
Following this discussion, Steinmetz and sen
ator Chris Nguyen, a sophomore, outlined what
they would perceive to be a successful election.
"Voter turnout would be the most quantifi
able information," said Nguyen, who also serves
as chair of the Senate's Rules Committee. "The
election would be a success if voter turnout is
higher than average which it very well could be,
given the highly competitive nature of this year's
elections."
Steinmetz agreed and said that he wanted
students' votes to be accurately reflected in the
election results.
"For me the biggest thing is that the will of
the voters is what happens," Steinmetz said.
"That's what my job is, to make sure that what
people voted and intended is what really hap
pened."
Steinmetz said that when something goes
wrong in an election — when the ASSU is most
visible to the student body — it might give stu
dents a negative impression of the governing
bodies.
"When you have an elections controversy, it
detracts from what the ASSU does," he said.
In regards to a potential election controversy,
Steinmetz said that if problems arise, they would
most likely result from individuals' campaign
behavior.
"The largest concern will be candidates' and
their supporters' actions over the next two
days," Steinmetz said. "Voters should hold can
didates accountable for their campaign actions."
The Senate did not certify the executive elec-
lions last spring, and special elections
had to be held. In January, the Con
stitutional Council declared the Sen
ate's process of election validation
unconstitutional.
"Last year they had to certify the
election, now it's automatically certi
fied by nature," Steinmetz said.
While the Senate still has the op
tion of invalidating the election re

sults, it would require two-thirds ap
proval by the Senate and the Gradu
ate Student Council.
In addition, the rules for invali
dating an election are more specific
this year than they have been in the
past.
"The rules were vague enough
last year so that the elections could
be stopped for anything considered
out of the ordinary," Nguyen said.
"This year to stop the elections
something big has to happen, such as
if campus computers stop working,
an earthquake hits or someone hacks
the elections Web site."
