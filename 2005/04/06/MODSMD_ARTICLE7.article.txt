# New group tackles sexual violence
## 
### JESSICA HANLEY 
A new committee to address sexual assault issues is
being formed by interim Dean of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman in conjunction with staff members from
Stanford's sexual assault prevention and response re
sources.
"The group will serve an advisory function to Dean
Boardman and will be able to make suggestions for im
proving the University's services," said Ira Friedman,
director of the Vaden Student Health Center.
The committee's 15 to 20 members — students and
University staff from Vaden — will work together to
prevent assault and encourage victims to come forward
and seek help.
Education will play an important role in strengthen
ing the system of preventing and reporting sexual as
sault incidents. In some cases, students are unaware
that they have sexually assaulted and fail to file report.
According to Carole Pertofsky, director of Health
Promotion Services at Vaden, sexual assault that is re-
ported at Stanford occurs most fre
quently between acquaintances and
often involves alcohol and poor
communication. Because the key
phrase in the definition of sexual as
sault is "lack of consent," unwel
come fondling or intercourse need
not be forceful or violent to consti
tute assault, she said.
When the perpetrator, most
often a man, assumes the woman's
consent without actually obtaining
it, Pertofsky refers to the man's
presumed "entitlement factor."
When this sense of entitlement
leaves a woman feeling violated,
sexual assault has occurred, she
said.
"It's not just bad manners,"
Pertofsky added. "It's a violent
crime against women."
By educating both potential vic
tims and perpetrators about what
behavior qualifies as sexual assault,
committee coordinators said they
hope to decrease its occurrence.
"Women don't say no often, so
we want to educate how to say no,"
Pertofsky said. "We want to teach
women to say, 'No, if you continue, I
will consider this sexual assault.' "
The committee will also encour
age students to report sexual assault
when it occurs and to provide a sup
portive environment for victims
seeking help.
Part of the committee's job will
be to ask: "How can we best serve
the person who's been assaulted?"
Pertofsky said.
While multiple resources al
ready exist for victims of sexual as
sault — beginning with resident as
sistants and including phonelines

and on-duty counselors — Pertof
sky said that feedback collected
from victims suggests room for im
provement.
"Victims had to tell their story a
lot and felt the system could he bet
ter coordinated," she said.
Several students said they feel
that the committee will help make
the campus safer when it comes to
sexual assault.
"I think the committee will be an
important step in strengthening the
University's reaction to sexual as
sault," junior Allison Rose said.
"The services provided hy Vaden
are good, but it would be great to de
velop more prevention programs
that incorporate student input and
reach more people."
Members of the committee on
sexual assault issues are currently
being selected, and the group plans
to meet once this quarter before be
coming fully operational in the fall.
