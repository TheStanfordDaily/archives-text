# Some say title undeserved
## Stanford ranked No. 1 for Hispanics 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
Stanford was named the best university for educating
Hispanic students in the nation in last month's issue of
Hispanicmagazine.com. Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Harvard and Duke ranked second, third
and fourth, respectively.
The top 25 listed schools were required to have a His
panic enrollment of at least 7 percent and were ranked
based on their academic quality, according to the Web
site. Hispanic students compromise 12 percent of Stan
ford's undergraduate student body.
Ironically, none of the schools in the top 10 ranked
among the top 100 schools that award the most bache
lor's degrees to Hispanic students.
Frances Morales, director of El Centro Chicano, said

Stanford was recently named as the best university for educating Hispanic students by Hispanic
magazine.com. El Centro Chicano is one of the features that garnered high marks for Stanford.
that important criteria for Hispanic
students when choosing a university
include academic programs, finan
cial aid options and community sup
port.
"I believe this is an area where
Stanford outshines its competitors,"
she said, referring to the community
support. "Stanford has a long stand
ing commitment to diversity and af
firmative action."
Morales said that, in her experience,
the welcoming Latino community and
rich cultural traditions that many stu
dents encounter during Stanford's
Admit Weekends are a major factor in
their decisions to attend Stanford.
Morales also praised El Centro
Chicano as a key aspect of the His
panic community at Stanford.
"Student Satisfaction Surveys
conducted in the past reveal that 94
percent of Chicano and Latino stu
dents who use the services provided
by El Centro Chicano agree that the
center enhances community life and
offers support for their academic en
deavors," she said.
Many students, however, dis
agreed that Stanford provides a
friendly and supportive environ
ment for its Hispanic students.
"This campus' Latino community
is extremely exclusive, categorical,
creates many limitations and is very
unwelcoming," said sophomore
Laura Rodriguez. "It is a place of
discomfort and anger."
Freshman George Morris con
curred that the atmosphere of the
Stanford Latino community is less
than ideal. Students in the Latino
community are not very active at
Stanford, he said.
"Evervone is concentrated at

C'asu Zapata arid horrible Latino
events including fake Mexican
food and very few cultural events
and speakers â€”do not help," he
said.
Other students, while not unhap
py with the Stanford Latino commu
nity, said they thought that Stan
lord's high ranking was unwarrant
ed.
"I think Stanford is the ideal en
vironment for all students and it has
nothing to do with your race," fresh
man Amanda Mendoza said. "I
think that the award promotes sepa
ratism and I do not support it."
Anna Marie Porras, director of
undergraduate admission, said that
the award says lit tic about the spe
cific experience of Latino students
on campus. Rather, it demonstrates
that Stanford provides a good expe
rience for students in general.
" This ranking confirms what so
many students have already experi
enced here - that Stanford unique
ly encourages students to be chal
lenged intellectually in a comfort
able way, to develop the cultural
competence necessary to succeed in
today's diverse world and to partici
pate actively in the creation of
knowledge and the discovery of new
ideas," Porras said.
She added that while the Univer
sity is pleased to be, once again,
ranked as the best school for His
panic students, Stanford does not
actively seek such titles or rankings.
"We will continue to promote the
best experience lor our students, re
gardless of such recognition," Porras
said. "()ur most important responsi
bility is educating and nurturing our
students intellectually and cultural
ly. There is. in other words, nothing
we will be doing to ensure that we
maintain this ranking, nor will we
allow such rankings to drive any fu
ture changes to our programs."
