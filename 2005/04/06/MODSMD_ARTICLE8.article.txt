# Some say title undeserved
## Stanford ranked No. 1 for Hispanics 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
Stanford was named the best university for educating
Hispanic students in the nation in last month's issue of
Hispanicmagazine.com. Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Harvard and Duke ranked second, third
and fourth, respectively.
The top 25 listed schools were required to have a His
panic enrollment of at least 7 percent and were ranked
based on their academic quality, according to the Web
site. Hispanic students compromise 12 percent of Stan
ford's undergraduate student body.
Ironically, none of the schools in the top 10 ranked
among the top 100 schools that award the most bache
lor's degrees to Hispanic students.
Frances Morales, director of El Centro Chicano, said
