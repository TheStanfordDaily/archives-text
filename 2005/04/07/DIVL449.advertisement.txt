Correction
In the article "Ballot details and
logistics explained." published on
April 5, The Daily inaccurately
defined Advisory Referendum 1
regarding door-to-door distribu
tion of student publications. Cur
rently residences, not students,
opt-in to distribution, and the ref
erendum will gauge whether stu
dents believe residences should
opt-out.
In the article "Medical students'
proposal could become state
law," published on April 5. The
Daily incorrectly spelled first
year medical student Emiley
Chang's name.
Next to the article "Contest pro
motes conservation," published
yesterday. The Daily ran an inac
curate graphic. The numbers re
ported as the contest's goals were
the actual amounts of electricity
and water consumed for 2005
without any active conservation
efforts. The contest organizers
did not set a specific goal for the
contest.
