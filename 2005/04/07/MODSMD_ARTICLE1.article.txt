# Univ. hosts grad students of color
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A host of events — including meetings with faculty
and dinners with current graduate students — de
signed to attract master's and doctoral minority stu
dents will take place starting today and ending Sunday
as a part of Stanford's Graduate Diversity Admit
Weekend.
The weekend will also feature presentations on ca
reer options for post-doctoral students and a formal re
ception with University President John Hennessy and
University Provost John Etchemendy. On Saturday, at
tendees will be taken on a tour of the Mission and Cas
tro districts of San Francisco and will spend the evening
in the city.
Unlike its undergraduate Admit Weekend, Stan
ford has no similar event for all of its graduate students.
Instead, individual departments within the University
host their own admitted students at different times,
making GDAW unique in bringing together students
from across disciplines.
"We want to give our diversity students the oppor
tunity to meet each other." explained Claudia Guzman
Schweikert, assistant dean of graduate diversity.
"GDAW is an opportunity for admits to ask questions
about Stanford and about graduate school in general so
that they can make a more informed decision about
whether this is the right place for them."
While diversity has been a long-standing goal for the
University for both graduate and undergraduate popula
tions, minority students are more strongly represented
among undergrads. Students identifying as African
American comprise 10 percent of the undergraduate stu
dent body compared to 5 percent of graduate students:
Hispanics make up 12 percent of the undergraduate pop-
ulation and 5 percent of all graduate
students.
Schweikert said that part of the
goal of GDAW is to create a sense
of community for minority stu
dents who are considering Stanford
for graduate school.
"Although there may not be
very many students from diverse
backgrounds in a particular depart
ment, there is a broader communi
ty on campus, and we want our ad
mits to know that they can tap into
this community as well," she said.
Most prospective graduate stu
dents will be making their deci
sions on or before April 15.
