# On this day in Stanford History...

On April 7, 1961, The Daily pub
lished a piece about a strange night
time troublemaker on the prowl on
campus. Below is an excerpt:
"A stocky purse-snatcher appar
ently not interested in money has hit
the Stanford campus twice within
the past month, Police Chief Gordon
Davis reported yesterday.
"In both cases the snatcher
grabbed a girl's purse at night and
then threw it away without disturb
ing the contents. Davis said the
snatchings were 'the only two in my
memory' at Stanford.
" The second instance occurred
Tuesday night when someone
yanked the purse from the hand of
freshman Lyn Wolfe as she walked
up the bike path to Roble.
"The person ran, but a Stanford
police officer later found the purse
about 150 feet from where the inci
dent happened.
"Miss Wolfe described the per
son as being short, about 5-feet, 6-
inches tall, of dark complexion,
weighing about 170 pounds and
about 18 years old.

"Earlier, on March 13, a bicycle
riding male of the same description
snatched a purse from a girl near the
Union on Santa Teresa Street.
Again, the purse later was found
near the spot-its contents unmolest
ed.
"That incident took place at 9:05
p.m. Tuesday's snatching happened
at 10:05 p.m."
On April 7, 2004, The Daily pub
lished a story about the declining
trend in computer science enroll
ment. Below is an excerpt:
"Amid concerns over the out
sourcing of technical jobs and the
end of the dot-com boom, the num
ber of Stanford students majoring in
computer science has significantly
declined over the past two years,
mirroring a national trend.
"The number of students de
claring computer science or com
puter systems engineering as their
major decreased eight percent be
tween the 2000-2001 and 2001-
2002 academic years and by 20 per
cent between the 2001-2002 and

2002-2003 years, according to
Claire Stager, a student services
officer in the Computer Science
Department.
"Universities and colleges na
tionwide have experienced similar
drops, according to a new study by
the Computing Research Associa
tion. The last year saw a sudden 23
percent drop in newly declared com
puter science majors.
"The most significant reason for
this decline, according to Maggie
Johnson, a senior lecturer in the de
partment. is the shrinking number
jobs in the industry, due in part to the
end of the dot-com boom.
"Also of concern to potential ma
jors, she added, was the threat of off
shore outsourcing, a business trend
that has gained the media's attention
in recent months.
"Despite the sharp drop in com
puter science majors, Prof. David
Dill does not see the problem as
long-term.
" it may well be that once we re
cover from the collapse of the dot
com bubble there will be plenty of
jobs. I also believe that off-shoring is
a bit of a fad. and once companies
find out that it doesn't work well in
some cases, those jobs will come
back to the U.S.'
"Regardless of the future of the
computer science industry. Dill had
some parting advice for students
worried about the marketability of
their majors.
" 'Overall, I would advise stu
dents to do what they love to do,' he
said. 'Maybe you won't make a for
tune, but the resulting satisfaction
will be worth a fortune.' "
