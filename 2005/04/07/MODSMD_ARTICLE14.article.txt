## The 						stigma of snacks and quickies 
### 
When renowned Chilean writ
er Isabel Allende spoke at
Stanford last May, she told
her audience that the words "snack"
and "quickie" are particular to the
American version of the English lan
guage. She suggested that in no other
culture in the world are people so con
cerned with time and efficiency that
they would be willing to sacrifice a sit
down meal or a marathon lovemaking
session just to get more things done.
Linguistics aside, it seems to me
that if the fast pace of our lives is in
deed responsible for these neolo
gisms. then Stanford should be the
snack and quickie paradise. We bike
from classes to labs to club meetings at
breathtaking speed, often forgetting
about lunches and dinners, let alone
romantic encounters.
We know that leading a fast-paced
lifestyle may not be the healthiest
thing in the world, but we feel that we
can't afford to slow down at the ex
pense of not taking advantage of yet
another educational opportunity. Is

there a way to
reconcile the rig
ors of Stanford
with a healthy
tempo of living?
Or has the re
laxed lifestyle be
come a preroga
tive of those hip
pies across the
Bay who suppos
edly do not face

the same kind of stress that we do?
There is little we can do to slow
down the pace of a community that is
as vibrant as Stanford. But even with
20 units of science classes, an honors
thesis and extracurricular commit
ments, it is possible to avoid the nutri
tional trap of unintelligent snacking.
Whether you are one of the lucky
upperclass people with 24-hour access
to an open kitchen or whether you are
a freshman on a meal plan, there are
always healthy and palatable alterna
tives to Hershey's bars. (My dad hap
pens to work for M&M's, so I felt
compelled to make an anti-Hershey's
comment at least once in this article).
A healthy snack does not have to
be celery sticks and baby carrots; it
could be a homemade sandwich, a
protein bar, fresh fruit or even (gasp!)
candy. However, there are several im
portant considerations to keep in
mind.
First of all, anything could make a
great snack if the size of your portion
is reasonable. If you happen to like
brie and crunchy French baguette, do
not be deterred by the gargantuan
amount of calories and fat in one serv
ing. Instead, watch your portion size
and enjoy every bit of it.
If you have trouble with portion sizes,
take the "Portion Distortion Quiz" on
the National Institutes of Health Web
site at http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/portion
and follow the fairly intuitive guide to
portion control.
Secondly, the "Nutrition Facts"
box is your friend. When Ralph Nader
spearheaded the fight to put nutrition
labels on all food products sold in the
United States, he had a good idea in
mind. The nutritional label not only
suggests a reasonable serving size, it
also contains a ton of useful informa
tion. For example, seemingly
"healthy" foods like granola bars are
often packed with sugars, fats and
many processed ingredients.
The moral of the story: Do not
trust the catchy commercials until you
have seen the back of the package.
Finally, just because it is a snack it
does not mean that it has to be de
voured during the three seconds of
your free time between classes. Nu
merous research studies have shown
that eating slowly helps with portion
control, since the brain gets the"I am
full" signal while you are still eating. It
is also a lot more enjoyable to chew on
a sandwich while reading outside of
Green Library' than to swallow huge
chunks of leftover cake while biking to
lecture.
We can stigmatize snacks and peo
ple who snack all we want, but the con
cept of a fast meal will be a part of the
college lifestyle for as long as we keep
trying to make the most out of these
four years. There is absolutely nothing
wrong with snacking â€” but like ev
erything else at Stanford, it has to be
done intelligently.
And now that we have discussed
snacks, what about quickies? Stay
tuned for another article.
