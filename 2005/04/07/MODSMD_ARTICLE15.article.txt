Research led by June McNicholas, a health psy
chologist from the University of Warwick in
Britain, revealed that more people feel confident
in talking to the opposite sex when wearing contact
lenses than when wearing glasses. This research,
reported by Health on the Net Foundation, a non
governmental organization for Internet health ed
ucation, the participants felt more confident be
cause they felt more attractive without glasses.
Also, many young adults do not want to be
stereotyped as "nerds" and "geeks" when they wear
glasses.
Although some may attempt to avoid this nega
tive connotation by switching to contact lenses —
some researchers believe that since the 1980's more
and more young adults have been trading in their
glasses for contact lenses — the fact is that those
who wear contacts have a higher chance of obtain
ing some types of eye irritation or injury.
"I tried wearing contacts in seventh grade and
initially it was great — Ididn't have to worry about
my glasses slipping off or worry about breaking
them in sports," said freshman Amy Yu. "It was also
exciting when I was in orchestra and 1 could look up
at the conductor and see her clearly."
But Yu soon discovered that contacts were not a
perfect alternative to glasses.
"After about two weeks, my eyes became ex

tremely irritated and turned red," Yu said. "My eyes
hurt incredibly and my ophthalmologist has told me
that 1 can not wear contacts because my eyes are
much too sensitive."
Dr. Steven Binder, an optometrist at the Stan
ford Eye Center, said that "there is an increased risk
for infection to the cornea and conjunctiva" in con
tact lens wearers.
The cornea is the outermost layer of the eye,
where the contact lenses are placed. The conjuncti
va is the clear tissue surrounding the cornea that
covers the surface of the eye.
Binder said he has seen a variety of eye problems
related to contact lenses, including "allergies due to
protein and lipid build-up to the surface of the con
tact lens."
Generally, contact lens wearers should watch out
for discomfort, blurred vision, redness in the eye,
itchiness, puffy eyelids, pain, drainage of a sticky dis
charge and sensitivity to light as symptoms of con
tact lens problems.
