# Ditching Glasses for Contacts?
## Not So Fast! The risks of wearing contact lenses 
### JILLIAN WAHMEI WONG 
Research led by June McNicholas, a health psy
chologist from the University of Warwick in
Britain, revealed that more people feel confident
in talking to the opposite sex when wearing contact
lenses than when wearing glasses. This research,
reported by Health on the Net Foundation, a non
governmental organization for Internet health ed
ucation, the participants felt more confident be
cause they felt more attractive without glasses.
Also, many young adults do not want to be
stereotyped as "nerds" and "geeks" when they wear
glasses.
Although some may attempt to avoid this nega
tive connotation by switching to contact lenses —
some researchers believe that since the 1980's more
and more young adults have been trading in their
glasses for contact lenses — the fact is that those
who wear contacts have a higher chance of obtain
ing some types of eye irritation or injury.
"I tried wearing contacts in seventh grade and
initially it was great — Ididn't have to worry about
my glasses slipping off or worry about breaking
them in sports," said freshman Amy Yu. "It was also
exciting when I was in orchestra and 1 could look up
at the conductor and see her clearly."
But Yu soon discovered that contacts were not a
perfect alternative to glasses.
"After about two weeks, my eyes became ex

tremely irritated and turned red," Yu said. "My eyes
hurt incredibly and my ophthalmologist has told me
that 1 can not wear contacts because my eyes are
much too sensitive."
Dr. Steven Binder, an optometrist at the Stan
ford Eye Center, said that "there is an increased risk
for infection to the cornea and conjunctiva" in con
tact lens wearers.
The cornea is the outermost layer of the eye,
where the contact lenses are placed. The conjuncti
va is the clear tissue surrounding the cornea that
covers the surface of the eye.
Binder said he has seen a variety of eye problems
related to contact lenses, including "allergies due to
protein and lipid build-up to the surface of the con
tact lens."
Generally, contact lens wearers should watch out
for discomfort, blurred vision, redness in the eye,
itchiness, puffy eyelids, pain, drainage of a sticky dis
charge and sensitivity to light as symptoms of con
tact lens problems.

from using contact lenses longer
than prescribed and from failing
to clean contacts thoroughly. To
avoid damage to the cornea and
to prevent eye injuries, the
Health Scout Network, a
provider of consumer health in
formation. said optometrists
strongly recommend that individ
uals always clean their hands
thoroughly before touching the
contacts. In addition, prevention
of such symptoms includes:
1. Washing contact containers and
other objects that contacts might
touch well.
2. Making sure to follow instructions
for the contact lenses. If they are
once-a-day disposable lenses, you
must discard them each night and
use new lenses the next day.
3. Only using commercial solutions,
as opposed to homemade contact so
lutions.
4. Putting on eye makeup after
putting in contact lenses.
5. Having your contact lenses
checked by a professional each year.
Despite up-to-date contact lens
cleansing treatments and precau
tions, people still face a greater risk
for wearing contact lenses that is
sometimes unavoidable.
People who are inattentive to
cleaning procedures or who absent
mindedly fall asleep while wearing
contacts face the danger of infection.
Binder said that sleeping with
contacts restricts oxygen flow to the
eye. As a result, the cornea swells
and bacteria can more readily pene
trate the corneal surface, also called
the epithelium.
Extended contact-lens wear in
creases the probability of serious in
fections such as bacterial keratitis.
Bacterial keratitis is the most com
mon type of infectious keratitis and
people who obtain keratitis can suf
fer from photophobia and acute
pain. Medical treatment, which
varies for each patient, should be im
mediate because keratitis can result
in the formation of scar tissue in the
cornea that can lead to blindness.
Researchers are working on new
technology to improve contact lens
es for those who have sensitive eyes
and reduce general adverse side ef
fects.
A yearlong study directed by
Dr. Philip B. Morgan, an op
tometrist at the University of
Manchester in England, found that
eye patients wearing new contact
lenses made of silicon hydrogel
were less likely to suffer from an
eye infection than patients wearing
regular contact lenses.
The silicon hydrogel allows oxy
gen to pass through to the cornea, re
ducing the risk of eye injuries. Even
though these contact lenses were
found to be safer, Binder said he still
recommended removing contact
lenses before sleeping.
