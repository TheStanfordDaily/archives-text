# Rebuilding After the Tsunamis:
## ADDRESSING INFECTIONS DISEASES IN INDONESIA 
### PRISCILLA GONZALEZ, WHITNEY HARRIS KIM KOMATSUBARA GUEST COLUMNISTS 
Editor's Note: This column is the second in a
three-part series about the impact of the Decem
ber 2004 tsunamis on Indonesia 's health sector.
The columns were written by students in the
Stanford in Washington program who took a
class on global health policy that focused specif
ically on the allocation of aid.
Immediately following the South Asian
tsunamis, many public health experts warned
of a possible second wave of deaths — those
due to outbreaks of infectious diseases. With
the goal of preventing further mortality the in
ternational community, including organiza
tions such as the World Health Organizations
and the United Nations, has devoted signifi
cant amounts of funding and technical support
to disease treatment and prevention efforts.
Nearly three months into the post-tsunami re
building efforts, we must ask: Has the global
community managed to effectively utilize its
resources to address the threat of infectious
diseases?
Three prominent disease threats — tuber
culosis, cholera and malaria — can shed light
on Indonesia's progress, success and shortcom
ings in addressing public health challenges.
Tuberculosis
Because of the increase in overcrowded liv
ing areas, shortage of medical supplies, inabili
ty to monitor cases and complications due to
the spread of other diseases, the WHO deems
the spread of tuberculosis a serious threat. Still,
the manifestation of a predicted tuberculosis,
or TB, epidemic has yet to be seen.
There are several reasons that Indonesia
has been able to avoid a full-on TB epidemic.
The United Nations and other donor organiza
tions have worked to set up infrastructure that
would aid in the reduction of TB cases. Such ef
forts include a system to document new TB
cases, monitor what medications were adminis
tered and educate the population about how to
recognize symptoms.
As a result, more patients have been able to
identify TB symptoms and seek help in the
makeshift facilities that are available. As the
roads are rebuilt and sanitation resources are
instituted, the U.N. will hopefully re-create the
medical supply chain and an efficient way to
document TB patients. As all of these plans
come to fruition, Indonesia's fears of a tuber
culosis outbreak following the tsunami should
subside.
Cholera
Cholera, a water-borne diarrhoeal disease
caused by an infection of the Vibrio cholerae
bacterium, remains a top priority in the pre
vention activity. It is primarily spread through
the ingestion contaminated food and water or
by fecal-oral transmission.
Although past outbreaks have reached 40
percent of the population, appropriate treat
ment can reduce it to one percent, according to
the WHO. The contamination of the water

supply and poor sanitation systems pose imme
diate threats to a water-borne outbreak, which
calls for the continued prevention, surveillance
and control of post-tsunami conditions.
Current efforts to prevent outbreaks in
clude using data from the electronic disease
outbreak surveillance system called the Early
Warning and Response Network, or
EWARN. to closely monitor any outbreaks.
In addition, UNICEF is leading efforts to re
build the health care infrastructure to have ac
cess to clean water and sanitation. The WHO
advises the use of oral cholera vaccines, which
have a 70 percent protection rate for at least
one year. However, these vaccines are limited
in supply.
Still, current efforts have resulted in suc
cessful prevention and a controlled strategy
that can decrease the chance of a cholera epi
demic. The Global Task Force on Cholera
Control has developed a comprehensive re
sponse plan in case of an outbreak. Although
no cholera cases have been confirmed, the con
tinued high surveillance, prevention and access
to clean water are imperative to prevent a fu
ture outbreak.

Malaria
Malaria, a parasitic disease predominantly
transmitted through mosquitoes, results in a
high fever, flu-like symptoms and, in some
cases, death. Malaria is endemic to Indonesia
— according to the Roll Back Malaria Partner
ship, a global initiative to decrease malaria in
fections, approximately 20,440 cases of malaria
were diagnosed in the Aceh province alone in
2003.
Having contracted malaria once, however,
provides no added immunity from future out
breaks.
In fact, Indonesians are now even more sus
ceptible to the disease. Poor nutrition can re
sult in weakened immune systems and in
creased malaria susceptibility. While the threat
of cholera and dysentery outbreaks continues
to diminish by day — due to increased accessi
bility of clean water — the danger of malaria
and dengue fever epidemics is still growing.
Overcrowded and makeshift living condi
tions, combined with stagnant, mosquito
breeding pools of salt and rain water, have set
the stage fora future malaria epidemic. Ac

cording to Richard Allan, the director of Men
tor Initiative, a non-governmental organiza
tion that focuses on malaria control, the disease
could take an additional 100,000 lives if tsuna
mi-affected countries fail to implement effec
tive preventative measures.
While infectious diseases continue to
threaten the future of public health in Indone
sia, the international community has helped to
stage an effective battle against malaria. In
order to aid tsunami-affected countries in their
malaria prevention efforts, the WHO has is
sued emergency guidelines for mosquito con
trol and malaria prevention. In addition,
UNICEF has shipped to Indonesia 20,000
ready-to-use and pre-treated mosquito bed
nets.
The U.N. agencies, along with other private
donor organizations, have together appropri
ated 20,000 rapid malaria diagnostic tests and
150,000 combination therapy treatment cours
es for Banda Aceh alone.
Supporting the efforts of the U.N. agencies,
other organizations such as the World Bank.


JEREMY GORDON/The Stanford Daily
USAID, Doctors Without Borders,
ExxonMobil and Novartis are also
working to reduce the threat of
malaria. The international communi
ty has thus far successfully aided In
donesia in staving off a malaria epi
demic; however, future health out
comes remain uncertain and health
infrastructure rebuilding remains in
complete.
As part of its plan to reconstruct
Indonesia's dilapidated health sys
tem, the WHO has requested $67
million to implement vector control
strategies and establish proper
drainage systems. Reconstruction is
still in progress and tsunami-affected
countries will continue to require
much aid in order to sustain the posi
tive results thus far experienced.
Looking to the future
With the assistance of internation
al relief efforts, Indonesia has risen to
the challenge and has effectively ad
dressed the threat of infectious dis
eases. On Jan. 13, U.N. Relief Chief
Jan Egeland said he no longer feared
the "second wave of death" following
the Indian Ocean tsunamis.
However, we must remember that
reconstruction is a continuous pro
cess and that ongoing funds are nec
essary to maintain progress.
Experts have recently expressed
concern that aid organizations have
focused our efforts too heavily on
temporary strategies, overlooking
the need to build long-term infras
tructure to address endemic diseases
such as TB and malaria.
The international community
must continue channeling funds to
tsunami-affected countries, not just
to provide temporary relief but to
reestablish infrastructure that will
foster healthy communities.
