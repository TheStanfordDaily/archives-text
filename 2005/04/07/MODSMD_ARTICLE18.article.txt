## Editorial No, seriously, please vote 
### 
Today is the second day of the annual ASSU /
GSC election. And a lot of you are probably thinking,
"So what?" Or maybe, "Thank God — all those an
noying campaign flyers and their vomit-inducing puns
are finally going to disappear." The majority of stu
dents seem to think that the ASSU isn't any more sig
nificant than the average high school student council
and the election isn't that different from those old
popularity contests.
That's understandable. It seems like no one really
knows what the ASSU president, vice president. Un
dergraduate Senate or Graduate Student Council re
ally do: we doubt that there are many students who
could speak knowledgeably about what outgoing
President Chioke Borgelt-Mose and Vice President
Kory Vargas Caro have accomplished this year. This
isn't to say that they haven't done anything, just that
no one seems to know about it.
And (ack) the fliers! Admittedly, it's hard to com
municate a nuanced campaign platform on a single
sheet of hot pink paper, but most candidates don't
even try. They settle instead for facile puns — in other
words, blatant attempts to get name recognition with
out actually offering any substance. When these are
the tools by which senators get elected, it's hard for
anyone to take the ASSU seriously.
But, if you haven't voted already, you shouldn't let these
things deter you from logging on to ballot.stanford.edu.
For one thing, you'll also be determining the fates
of 42 student groups. Even if you don't care who wins
the popularity contests, you should be concerned
about whether the organizations that make campus
life as diverse and vibrant as it is receive the money
necessary to continue their work. And conversely,
you should care whether student money (including
your own) is spent on groups that do little to better the
Stanford community.
And, yes, it really does matter who is in charge of
the ASSU. Sure, the campaigns are W percent empty
flash, and absolutely, there are many ASSU officers

and potential officers who are just looking to pad their
resumes. But. love it or hate it, the ASSU is the main
representative of student concerns to the University
administration. Everyone has serious complaints
about Stanford — about Bookstore prices, late-night
study space, student housing and countless other is
sues — and the ASSU is one of the most effective
ways through which students can try to address these
concerns. Choose someone without a clear plan, and
nothing happens. Choose someone who doesn't even
take the job seriously, and improvements will be even
more distant and difficult to achieve.
So please take a little time with your vote. Every
year, we hear the same promises about change, ac
countability and accessibility. Look for candidates
who seem to possess a thoughtful vision, have a clear
idea of how the ASSU functions and present a believ
able, detailed plan for implementing their proposed
reforms. Beware of grandiose claims and vague
promises of "working for YOU." As much as we'd
like to believe that an ASSU senator can extend Late-
Nite to weekends and make Big Game free for stu
dents, it seems extremely unlikely — and these kinds
of campaign promises imply that the candidate hasn't
thought seriously about what they can and should ac
complish while in office.
The Daily has tried to present you with some of the
knowledge needed to make informed decisions in this
election, both through its ongoing election coverage
and the editorial board's endorsements — of one of
the three executive slates and 12 special-fees groupS
— on page 10.
But these are not a substitute for individual
thought and research. The ASSU Elections Hand
book (elections.stanford.edu/handbook) is easy-to
read and informative; all students should take the
time to look through it.
Vote wisely. And if we're very, very lucky, we may
start seeing new campaign promises next year, be
cause the ones made this year will have been fulfilled.
