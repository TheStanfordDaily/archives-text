# Hennessy addresses visas, endowment
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
University President John Hennessy fielded
questions that addressed a variety of topics with
student representatives at the first joint Under
graduate Senate and Graduate Student Council
meeting of the year held last night at the Law
School.
The first topic of the evening dealt with Stan
ford's current investment monitoring system and
how confident Hennessy is that the University
would have divested from Apartheid South
Africa without the pressure applied by student
protest.
"It is not obvious that we would have divested
without some organized discussion generated by
the students," Hennessy said. "Students played a
very valuable role to bring the Apatheid effort
front and center."
He added that there should be a forum to dis
cuss access to investment policies.
One student pointed out the fact that despite
the interest since Sept. 11 in the Middle East and
Islam, there has not been a significant increase in
the number of classes offered.
"Our intention is to hire additional faculty in
this area," Hennessy said. "Depending on the out
come of the faculty search this year, we can then
offer more courses."
Another student questioned the decrease in
enrollment of international students because of
visa restrictions. Hennessy responded by saying
that there have been several improvements and
that the visa process has been streamlined.
"People understand that the next big things

that will happen to improve the situation is im
provement in the computer systems used so that
the process of applying fora visa can happen
faster," Hennessy said. "One of our big problems
right now is that the nation has sent a message to
foreign students that they are not welcome. After
the basic visa concerns are solved there will need
to be outreach."
Some attendees said they appreciated the pres
ident's focus on international student concerns.
"I am glad that the University is working to
improve the situation for international stu
dents," said Thomas Lee, third-year doctoral
student in the electrical engineering department
and a GSC representative. They face a lot of
challenges that domestic students do not, and
these challenges have only gotten more difficult
since Sept. 11."
Hennessy also expressed interest in creating
need-blind admission policies for international
undergraduate applicants.
"I am glad to hear the president advocate for
international student financial aid," said sopho
more Anita Mukheijee, deputy chair of the Sen
ate. "I'm always surprised to hear that last year
was the first time in our school's history that a
large amount of money was raised for this pur
pose. Even though he said that going need-blind
for international students will be a difficult issue, I
believe that it needs to be a priority."
Marcus Folch, fifth-year doctoral student in
the Classics Department and GSC representative,
highlighted graduate student concern that doctor

not always have adequate stipends.
"The University has been strug
gling with how to balance the size of
graduate programs with the length of
support," Hennessy said. He suggest
ed that possible options include reduc
ing the length of Stanford's doctoral
programs or reducing the number of
doctoral students.
Lee asked Hennessy to describe his
vision for the Commission on Gradu
ate Education, or CGE, a group that is
studying the academic and lifestyle
concerns of the graduate population.
"Stanford is a great institution;
we've managed to do a tremendous
job with undergraduate education by
taking a studious look at it," Hennessy
said. With the University's current
look at graduate education, he hopes
to create a vision that identifies poten

tial opportunities and ways to imple
ment them.
A member of the Senate, noting
the recent meeting between conserva
tive critic David Horowitz and Senior
Assistant to the President Jeff Wach
tel, asked whether Stanford planned
to restrict freedom of speech on cam
pus.
"The motto of the University is the
wind of freedom blows," Hennessy
said. "We have freedom of speech. It is
a right and a privilege. Stanford will do
its best to protect that freedom in all
forms."
Hennessy also said that it is impor
tant for students and the University to
hear and critique a wide variety of con
servative and liberal viewpoints on
campus.
"I'm really glad to hear President
Hennessy express his firm commit
ment to freedom of speech, especially
regarding viewpoints that are unpopu
lar on campus," said Senator Chris
Nguyen, a sophomore.
Alice Lincoln, third-year chemistry

doctoral student and chair of the GSC
diversity community, asked how Stan
ford is working to increase the number
of minorities and women in the gradu
ate populations.
"If we don't increase our diversity
within the sciences and engineering
[graduate populations], we will not be
able to make further progress on fac
ulty diversity," Hennessy said.
He also indicated that it was impor
tant to recognize that great progress
has been made in the number of fe
male faculty members in the engineer
ing and science departments. Hen
nessy said that when he first came to
Stanford, there were no women facul
ty members in mechanical engineer
ing, computer science, chemical engi
neering or aeronautics and astronau
tics, and that there was only one in
electrical engineering.
The meeting concluded with a dis
cussion of the upcoming Munger grad
uate residences project. Mike Beman
and Matthew Ginder-Vogel, the GSC
earth sciences representatives who sit

on a committee about the project, re
ported the latest developments.
Munger will be a six-building plan
with dorm-like elevations. Construc
tion will begin April 2006 and complet
ed June 2007 at the earliest. Beman and
Ginder-Vogel are currently working to
plan the use of the common space in
two of the new buildings.
One GSC member raised an addi
tional consideration for the Munger
housing project.
"I'm concerned that the housing
changes may overlook the needs of
international engineering students
who previously had inexpensive in
dividual housing in Crothers
Memorial Hall," said Daniel
Woods, a first-year master of com
puter science student and Crothers
Memorial resident.
At the beginning of the meeting,
the GSC presented a gift to the presi
dent in appreciation of his work with
students, according to Moriah
Thomason, GSC chair and fourth
year neuroscience doctoral student.
