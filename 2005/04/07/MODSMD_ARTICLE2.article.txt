# Hennessy addresses visas, endowment
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
University President John Hennessy fielded
questions that addressed a variety of topics with
student representatives at the first joint Under
graduate Senate and Graduate Student Council
meeting of the year held last night at the Law
School.
The first topic of the evening dealt with Stan
ford's current investment monitoring system and
how confident Hennessy is that the University
would have divested from Apartheid South
Africa without the pressure applied by student
protest.
"It is not obvious that we would have divested
without some organized discussion generated by
the students," Hennessy said. "Students played a
very valuable role to bring the Apatheid effort
front and center."
He added that there should be a forum to dis
cuss access to investment policies.
One student pointed out the fact that despite
the interest since Sept. 11 in the Middle East and
Islam, there has not been a significant increase in
the number of classes offered.
"Our intention is to hire additional faculty in
this area," Hennessy said. "Depending on the out
come of the faculty search this year, we can then
offer more courses."
Another student questioned the decrease in
enrollment of international students because of
visa restrictions. Hennessy responded by saying
that there have been several improvements and
that the visa process has been streamlined.
"People understand that the next big things

that will happen to improve the situation is im
provement in the computer systems used so that
the process of applying fora visa can happen
faster," Hennessy said. "One of our big problems
right now is that the nation has sent a message to
foreign students that they are not welcome. After
the basic visa concerns are solved there will need
to be outreach."
Some attendees said they appreciated the pres
ident's focus on international student concerns.
"I am glad that the University is working to
improve the situation for international stu
dents," said Thomas Lee, third-year doctoral
student in the electrical engineering department
and a GSC representative. They face a lot of
challenges that domestic students do not, and
these challenges have only gotten more difficult
since Sept. 11."
Hennessy also expressed interest in creating
need-blind admission policies for international
undergraduate applicants.
"I am glad to hear the president advocate for
international student financial aid," said sopho
more Anita Mukheijee, deputy chair of the Sen
ate. "I'm always surprised to hear that last year
was the first time in our school's history that a
large amount of money was raised for this pur
pose. Even though he said that going need-blind
for international students will be a difficult issue, I
believe that it needs to be a priority."
Marcus Folch, fifth-year doctoral student in
the Classics Department and GSC representative,
highlighted graduate student concern that doctor
al candidates in the Humanities Department do
