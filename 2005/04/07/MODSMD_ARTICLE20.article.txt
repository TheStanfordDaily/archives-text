# Writing in the Margins
## The 						Storyteller's Son 
### 
Last week, when I returned from
class, a package sat in my doorway,
staring me down, limblessly throwing
down the gauntlet. Cadmus Profes
sional Communications left me bewil
dered. I sat down next to it fora while
and assumed that it held a bomb.
Eventually, I got over my surprisingly
rational paranoia and tore the parcel
apart with my Exacto knife. Cadmus,
it turns out, was not trying to throw

down the gauntlet at all. Forced out of his home in Illi
nois, he acted as a mule for Poetry magazine, which had
promised to send me its April issue. Unfortunately, poor
innocent Cadmus died in the process and has been sent
to the recycling facility.
I haven't read Poetry yet, but there is poetry in the air.
1 Hung a copy at each door in the dorm just as copies of
Marge Piercy's "A Work of Artifice" began to scale the
walls, announcing an imminent poetry reading. Before
long, though, poetry will not only be in the atmosphere, it
will propagate itself into my flesh. I'll be at the reading of
"A Work of Artifice" this Friday, and I'll have read Po
etry magazine by sometime before then. It'll take some
work — arduous, mind-shattering labor — but I'll shed
my verseless world in favor of verse and meter and
rhythm.
Ms. Massoudi offered extra credit as the impetus for
writing poetry in seventh grade. Back then, I loved extra
credit, for reasons I'm still not certain of — that attitude
certainly did not follow me to Pre-Algebra or Biology
with Ms. Shah. A poem flew out of me every night. I
made sure to print the poem and ready it for display. Ms.
Massoudi displayed the poems, and they helped me ac
crue hundreds of extra credits points. Those verses of
mine, I'm proud to say, dotted the walls of Ms. Massou
di's bungalow like chickenpox: conspicuous, obvious
and annoying as hell.

1 couldn't write poetry then, and I probably can't write
poetry today, even with the removal of all that middle
school angst. 1 never edited my poems, and 1 believed that
each line should end with a comma. Oh, and poems came
in one form: endless, stanza-less blocks of free verse. They
were filled with awful,surreal, nonsensical imagery, which
my friend John never failed to point out. "Stuff my chest
with cotton," he'd recite laughing his way though it. I see
the humor now, but back then, I was so proud of my chick
en scratch lines. One day, a cousin of Cadmus will accost
someone, and the copies of Poetry magazine he possesses
will contain a few of my stanzas, because I'm still oh-so
proud of my limited poetic abilities.
Nudibranch,
I love you
Because you are so pretty,
and, because you are
a hermaphrodite
(simultaneous style).
Nudibranch. will you marry me?
I'll move to the tide pool,
or ocean bottom for you.
I'll eat tunicates,
or sponges for you.
Nudibranch,
I'll let you touch me with your radula.
Nudibranch.
I'll let you stroke me with your rhinophores.
Nudibranch,
won't you be mine?
I'll be yours.
