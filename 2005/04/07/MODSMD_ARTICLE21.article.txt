## Elect responsible, dedicated ASSU officers 
### 
As the outgoing Undergraduate Senate Chair,
I'd like respond and add to the past week's nu
merous op-eds on the ASSU and provide context
for what the ASSU does and why it's important to
elect strong student leaders to the ASSU Gradu
ate Student Council, Undergraduate Senate and
executive offices.
The ASSU is significantly different from other
governing bodies. Frankly, there are few policy is
sues by which candidates or slates can distinguish
themselves. They can argue about the amount and
allocation of ASSU fees or whether to advocate
on certain issues, but beyond that, elections are
about the people, not the ideas.
In the end. the most important part of a strong
ASSU leader isn't his or her position on dining,
housing, 24-hour space or communication bills
(although these are good indicators of how in
tune the candidate is with campus opinion). What
makes strong ASSU leaders is not their ability to
talk about problems on campus or their numerous
promises to fix them.
Instead, the success or failure of the ASSU lies
in the characteristics of the leaders themselves â€”

their desire to work hard in a traditionally thank
less job determines the direction of the ASSU.
Holding an elected office, for the most part, is
not a glorious position. The ASSU is first and
foremost about responsibility to the students, not
public recognition.
The ASSU is responsible for promoting stu
dent life on campus (mainly through the distribu
tion of fees to student groups) and ensuring a stu
dent voice in University decisions.
The ASSU GSC and Undergraduate Senate's
most direct responsibility is funding student
groups. While this is an amazing power, it's also a
tremendous burden involving long meetings look
ing over pages and pages of budgets from hun
dreds of student groups. It requires making ex
tremely tough decisions after spending long hours
meeting with students, combing over budgets and
finding compromises.
The ASSU's responsibility to amplify student
voice is a little harder to define, but equally im
portant. As Daily columnist Nick Fram noted (in
("Don't be fooled by false promises, vote for
friends," April 7), the ASSU has little direct

power over University decisions or allocation of
resources, hut can serve as a strong focal point for
advocacy.
The ASSU needs to do a better job of becom
ing the strong link between administrators and the
student body, but in order to make this happen,
students need to put in the necessary time and en
ergy.
I urge you to vote for your friends, not simply
because they are your friends, but because you
know them well enough to know that they enjoy
working tirelessly and thanklessly to advocate stu
dent interests. Vote for them not just because they
can talk about what's flawed with student life or
the ASSU, but because they're willing to devote
hours and hours to brainstorming, attending
meetings with administrators and students to find
realistic solutions.
Most importantly, vote for them because they
have a sense of obligation and duty to the respon
sibilities of the position.
