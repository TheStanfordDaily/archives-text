# Let it Be
## Who's the crazy one here? 
### 
Last Sunday. I talked to the most
important man in the world —at
least according to him.
He boarded the free hus at Wal-
Mart. lugging two backpacks and
bike wheels. As we approached

campus, 1 heard
him asking a Chi
nese person for
the Mandarin
word for rain.
"Here's the inter
esting person I've
been looking
for," 1 thought,
and 1 asked him if
I could interview

him for my journalism assignment.
'"I'm actually a very interesting
person, although entirely by acci
dent," he said.
In the Coffee House, I asked him
about his family and childhood, but
he interrupted my line of question
ing because these questions had
nothing to do with the real reason he
was interesting — he was a conduit
from God and for all he knew, the
only one.
He told me he'd been having
"earth-shaking" visions since he was
a child that gave him insight into re
ligion and the "modern condition."
After leaving graduate school, he
started getting messages that he was
"not at liberty to talk about, because
they involve life and death issues for
a lot of people and some politics."
"It's dangerous in a revolutionary
sense ... [because people] can blow
up whole cities and we wouldn't
know who did it. You can come in
with a backpack and blow up Chica
go," he said.
Other than fearing small bombs,
he also worried about the govern
ment monitoring his e-mails, which
he saved as drafts rather than send
ing.
"Right now, I'm a visionary.
That's my main job."
Doctors probably would have di
agnosed him with paranoid
schizophrenia. But from a viewpoint
outside the human race (say. from an
extraterrestrial or a god), would he
seem any crazier than the rest of us?
Many of our species' behaviors
seem like symptoms of mental dis
ease.
Denial: not thinking about how
we are destroying our environment.
Self-destructive behavior: wreak
ing havoc on our sole life-support
system, the biosphere.
Addiction: using technology in an

attempt to correct problems other
technologies created, like an alco
holic using alcohol to alleviate a
hangover.
Dependence: relying on various
technologies so heavily that we lose
the ability to do things on our own.
Grandiosity: telling ourselves we
are the most important species and
that all other life exists for our bene
fit.
Delusions: thinking that we in
definitely can continue our unsus
tainable use of natural resources.
As the interview ended, I asked
the man about his lifestyle, and
whether he often had a chance to
talk with people. He said that no, he
didn't, and the more he was alone,
the more trouble he had making
sense to people.
There's a definite norming effect
to being connected to people, but 1
sometimes have to wonder whether
society banishes delusions or creates
them.
1 like to walk around the Dish or
go for walks outside when 1 can't
sleep. 1 watch the red-winged
blackbirds, the ground squirrels,
and at night, the owls. Sometimes 1
see moles. After a while, 1 start to
lose the hype I've picked up from
other people. Making myself fa
mous starts to seem a lot less im
portant than living. The double
think I ask people to help me be
lieve disintegrates when I'm away
from their influence. Ostensibly,
I'm losing touch with reality, but it
sure feels like I'm gaining it.
The man said he was grateful I
hadn't been judgmental, since he
knew many people think his ideas
are crazy. I could empathize: people
think my ideas are crazy, too. There
are plenty of things I've learned not
to say, because our culture considers
them heresy. I wish more people
would trust their personal experi
ence and speak up about what
makes sense based on it. even if that
means reporting visions from God.
Given what people have done to the
world in the past few thousand years,
trusting the majority might be as il
logical as trusting someone with
schizophrenia.
And speaking up for what we be
lieve could make any of us, in some
sense, the "most important person in
the world."
