Do nice clothes also deepen
the gap between haves
and have nots?

The Daily's editorial hoard
claims that a dorm cleaning service
further deepens the schism between
socioeconomic lines ("No more ex
cuses — clean your room," April 5).
1 agree 100 percent.
This is why I would like to point
out another on-campus service that
strains the tension between the
haves and the have-nots: the Stan
ford Shopping Center.
You see, here at the mall, you can
buy "nice things."
These purchase items are often
expensive, usually more expensive
than that $20 it would cost to clean
your room.
Oh my God, there are some in the
dorm that have nice clothes! How
unbearable! Didn't they know it is a
"rite of passage" to go through life

clothed in tattered rags?

Truitt dehumanizes the poor with
his "elitism and snobbery"
In his latest column ("The shal
low end of the gene pool," April 5),
Glenn H. Truitt takes himself to be a
modern-day übermensch who must
endure encounters with "the mass
es" when he frequents the local Wal-
Mart. Truitt's reference to the "shal
low end of the gene pool" makes it
clear that he believes that those who
shop at Wal-Mart (his euphemism
for the poor) are less evolved than he
is. He dehumanizes the poor not
only by referring to them as the
masses but also by denying them so
cial mobility by tying their socioeco
nomic status to their genes.
I would argue that the only
traits that Truitt possesses in ex
cess of your average person
among "the masses" are snob
bery and elitism. His diatribe
against those who must pay for
items with "checks, food stamps
and, honestly, a ziplock bag of
spare change" shows a shocking
lack of compassion for residents
in our area who are in less fortu
nate circumstances than he is.
What disturbs me most, howev
er, is Truitt's assumption that we all
share his attitude toward the poor.
A Stanford education is truly a priv
ilege, but not one that gives us li
cense to condescend toward others.
1 hope that students who read his ar
ticle did not "laugh and nod" as he
predicted, but were appalled by his
attempt to veil his own callousness
through humor.
