Do nice clothes also deepen
the gap between haves
and have nots?

The Daily's editorial hoard
claims that a dorm cleaning service
further deepens the schism between
socioeconomic lines ("No more ex
cuses — clean your room," April 5).
1 agree 100 percent.
This is why I would like to point
out another on-campus service that
strains the tension between the
haves and the have-nots: the Stan
ford Shopping Center.
You see, here at the mall, you can
buy "nice things."
These purchase items are often
expensive, usually more expensive
than that $20 it would cost to clean
your room.
Oh my God, there are some in the
dorm that have nice clothes! How
unbearable! Didn't they know it is a
"rite of passage" to go through life

clothed in tattered rags?

Truitt dehumanizes the poor with
his "elitism and snobbery"
In his latest column ("The shal
low end of the gene pool," April 5),
Glenn H. Truitt takes himself to be a
modern-day übermensch who must
endure encounters with "the mass
es" when he frequents the local Wal-
Mart. Truitt's reference to the "shal
low end of the gene pool" makes it
clear that he believes that those who
shop at Wal-Mart (his euphemism
for the poor) are less evolved than he
is. He dehumanizes the poor not
only by referring to them as the
masses but also by denying them so
cial mobility by tying their socioeco
nomic status to their genes.
