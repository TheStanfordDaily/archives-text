## Carr/Castillo best choice for ASSU 
### 
In national presidential elections, the electorate
often chooses between less-than-ideal choices —
and the upcoming ASSU executive election looks to
be no different. While there ate faults in every candi
date, we believe the best choice is Victoria Carr and
Fernando Castillo as they offer the most passion for
the ASSU and the most attainable agenda.
The three slates offer a diversity of knowledge
and experience, but none of the slates have full
knowledge of the campus issues. When The Daily's
editorial board interview**! the slates about their
platforms, they were sometimes vague and unaware
of the details. Given the number of promises we hear
repeated year after year, executive candidates ought
to be able to explain how they plan to address issues
and solve problems, so we won't be hearing the same
thing next year.
In addition, the agendas of the slates are extraor
dinarily similar. Kannokada / Okonkwo and Carr /
Castillo both offer improvements to NomCom, more
24-hour study space and easier access to recreational
athletic space. When it comes to a far-reaching vision,
neither of the "serious" slates differ. And even the
Avalanche of Diversity's desire for personal profit is
likely shared on some level by all the candidates.
Still, of the slates, Carr / Castillo stand the best
chance of accomplishing the goals they set forth.
Overall, they offer a smaller platform, allowing them
to focus and achieve their goals. Goals such as a lead
ership summit for Voluntary Student Organizations
and a more defined freedom-of-speech policy are
both laudable and realizable. Melanie Kannokada
and Aneto Okonkwo offer over 12 different agenda
points that they say University administrators have
committed to address. But the details of these com

mitments are uncertain. Such a large agenda will be
too difficult to achieve. While ambition is worthy of
our applause, it is often the case that when slates
promise a sizeable agenda they become over
stretched complete less.
Because of the similarity of the slates' platforms,
their commitment to the position becomes increas
ingly important. Carr and Castillo have pledged to be
on campus this summer and take minimal course
loads next year. Kannokada and Okonkwo were not
able to give the same assurances. This slate believes
their better time management skills will allow them
to handle larger course loads. However, past ASSU
officers' experiences have shown that even the most
time-efficient individuals have difficulty balancing
ASSU and class responsibilities. The need to have
representatives often available and consistently
working on issues heavily favors Carr / Castillo.
Also, Carr and Castillo have the best working re
lationship. In the editorial board's interviews, they
clearly got along well. As the ASSU executives spend
significant amounts of time together, this relationship
is more important than it seems. In past years when
relationships have not been as strong, infighting oc
curred that divided the ASSU and its political capital.
This is less likely to happen under Carr / Castillo.
Let us not forget the Avalanche of Diversity slate.
In meeting with the slate, it became abundantly clear
that they did not have the emotional stability to han
dle the rigors of the position; presidential candidate
Rishi Chanderraj came close to tears.
While it is unfortunate that we are not endorsing
one slate wholeheartedly, Victoria Carr and Fernan
do Castillo offer the best opportunity for the student
government for the next year.
