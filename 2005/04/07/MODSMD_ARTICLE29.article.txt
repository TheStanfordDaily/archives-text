# Stanford rankes third with students, first with parents
## NYU named top dream school 
### LI TAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As thousands of high school se
niors consider their college options
in the coming weeks, the very lucky
ones will attend their dream schools.
For many of them, this dream school
is not Harvard or Stanford, but New
York University.
In a nationwide survey recently
released by The Princeton Review,
Stanford was ranked number three,
behind NYU and Harvard as the
college that students considered
their dream school. Even so, Stan
ford was the top choice among par
ents, with Harvard second and NYU
10th.
Several Stanford community
members said they understood why
NYU topped the list.
Stanford Economics Prof.
Steven Tadelis noted that NYU
began attracting professors and stu
dents alike simply by spending more
money, among other factors.
"After the drop in crime and
[New York City Mayor Rudolph]
Giuliani's cleanup during the late

90's, New York became an attrac
tive place to live," Tadelis said.
Combined with handsome offers to
top-notch professors, he added that
NYU built up many of its depart
ments such as economics, law and
philosophy, which, in turn, have be
come very attractive to students.
Robert Franek of The Princeton
Review said the survey demon
strates a trend that students are
seeking schools for more practical
reasons, such as location.
"One of the reasons students are
drawn to NYU is its easy access to fi
nancial centers," he said.
Many students are drawn to
Stanford for similar reasons.
"[Stanford] has great access to
Silicon Valley and centers of tech
nology," Franek said.
When the time comes to choose a
college, 55 percent of respondents
— both students and parents —
would choose the college that fit
them best overall. Meanwhile, 24
percent said they would make the
decision based on career interests;
13 percent cited cost as the prime
factor; and only 8 percent said they

were most concerned with the col
lege's prestige.
Stanford Freshman Yvonne
Chan defined a dream school as one
that "helps you grow as a person"
and "opens up your perception of
the world."
But the main concern facing par
ents and students was not "getting
in" or even possibly regretting their
choice of college. According to the
survey, 30 percent of students and
parents were worried about not
being able to afford tuition, and an
other 26 percent were anxious over
the debt they might confront after
graduation. Meanwhile, 64 percent
of students and parents reported
they had felt a "high" or "very high"
level of stress during the college ap
plication process.
Overall, 2,885 students and 1,045
parents responded to the survey,
which was conducted as a tear-out in
The Princeton Review book "Best
357 Colleges," and as a Web survey
on Princetonßeview.com. The sur
vey was conducted to "find out the
feelings of current college students
and their parents," Franek said.
