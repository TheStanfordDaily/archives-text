# Law clinic aids in court cases
## Students help to win two U.S. Supreme Court cases 
### KILLEEN HANSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Supreme Court Liti
gation Clinic, an organization that
provides law students with hands-on
experience, successfully represented
clients in front of the U.S. Supreme
Court in cases argued last Wednesday
and this past Monday.
In the Wednesday ruling. Smith v.
City of Jackson, Mississippi, the

Supreme Court determined that
workers over the age of 40 do not have
to prove intention of age discrimina
tion, only the effect of it, to receive
damages under the Federal Age Dis
crimination in Employment Act, or
ADEA.
The city of Jackson raised the
salary of its police officers to bring
them up to the regional average. How
ever, this increase in wages of junior
officers was proportionally greater
than that of older, senior officers. The
elder officers filed suit declaring that
although the salary increase was not
intended to affect them specifically, it
had. The officers sought reparations
under the ADEA.
In the case, a majority of five jus

tices determined that "disparate im
pact" claims may be brought under the
ADEA for workers over the age of 40.
"This case allows workers to fight
against practices put in place by em
ployers that {unintentionally] discrimi
nate against age," said Stanford law stu
dent David Sapp, one of about nine stu
dents in the clinic.
The decision will affect how fast
employees must work, how many
breaks they receive and the length of
these breaks, among other things.
However, employers will still be
able to argue that some policies were
developed to benefit the company and
were not necessarily dependent on
employee age.
In Rousey v. Jacoway, decided on
Monday, the court decided unani
mously in favor of exempting from
bankruptcy any money in individual
retirement accounts. Accordingly, if
someone declares bankruptcy, funds
in his or her retirement account will be
off limits to creditors.
The Stanford Supreme Court Liti

gation Clinic, led by Law Prof.
Pamela Karlan and lecturers Thomas
Goldstein and Amy Howe, offers law
students the opportunity to work on
cases appearing before the Supreme
Court.
The clinic was established in the
spring of 2003 to "give students a range
of experience that they would not have
had in the classroom and involving
them in the practicalities of litigation
missing from the classroom," said law
student Lee Reeves.
Students typically take part in
everything except the actual argu
ment. They work between nine

months and a year, "helping frame the
argument, editing the brief, participat
ing in moot arguments, and helping
prepare the counsel for arguments,"
Reeves explained.
The recent successes in court are
triumphs for the clinic.
Of the 80 cases the Supreme Court
agrees to hear each year, three were
cases represented by the clinic. A
fourth is scheduled for early next year.
The organization works on a pro
bono basis, which allows them to rep
resent clients who might not be able
to pay for the court fees themselves.
Such was the case in Rousey and with

the police officers represented in
Smith.
"This is a terrific experience be
cause we get to do what some lawyers
in a 50-year career might never do,"
Sapp said. "We get terrific guidance
and support."
Reeves added, "It is a fantastic ex
perience, and is, bar-none, the best ex
perience in my law-school years. We
get to work with top-notch practition
ers and work on real-life cases."
In teams of two to five, the students
prepare briefs, do whatever research is
necessary and work with lawyers to
prepare for oral arguments.
