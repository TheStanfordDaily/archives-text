City of Jackson, Mississippi, the

Supreme Court determined that
workers over the age of 40 do not have
to prove intention of age discrimina

intended to affect them specifically, it
had. The officers sought reparations
under the ADEA.
In the case, a majority of five jus

tices determined that "disparate im
pact" claims may be brought under the
ADEA for workers over the age of 40.

against practices put in place by em

able to argue that some policies were
developed to benefit the company and
were not necessarily dependent on
