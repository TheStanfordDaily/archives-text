# Getting a head start
## Students find work during school year 
### RACHEL TEITELBAUM THE COLLEGIATE TIMES 
(U-WIRE) BLACKSBURG,
Va. â€” Summer always seems to
come to mind when thinking about
an internship. But did you know that
internships are available during the
school year? Although taking on the
extra work of an internship may
seem like a heavy load, it truly is
worth the experience.
Participating in an internship in
general has an infinite number of
benefits, but doing it during the
school year definitely has major
perks.
According to Pam Herrmann, as
sistant director of experiential edu
cation at Career Services at Virginia
Tech, "The biggest benefit is that
many employers would like to have a
student that will be with them fora
long period of time. If the student
does a co-op or internship during the
school year they will be there five or
six months longer than a summer in
ternship, it gives the student more
time to develop the skills employers
are looking for."
Summer internships are more
sought out by students than those oc
curring during the school year. Com
panies are usually overwhelmed with
excessive competitive applicants
during the summer, making it rather
difficult for students to obtain an in
ternship during this time. "Students
interested in fields that are more
technical in nature should consider
participating in a co-op to combine
work and school." Herrmann said.
However, different fields require
different skills; a summer internship
may be the best fit for some students.
Many students are confronted
with the difficult question of whether
they should intern in the summer or
during the school year. "It's impor
tant that students realize this and Ca
reer Services can help with this deci
sion," Herrmann said.
Career Services offers internships
in a wide variety of fields. Herrmann
explained, "We have resources and
services for various students, but it's
up to the student to go to Career Ser
vices and talk to a counselor to find a
possible co-op or internship for
themselves."
Having a paid internship or one
that provides course credit, are other
variables students need to look at.
"Everyone chooses to intern dur
ing the summer, making it more

competitive. Students interested in
combining an internship into the fall
or spring will encounter a more re
duced number, but the internships
that Career Services has to offer are
only those that are usually paid be
cause they come in all shapes, sizes
and colors." Herrmann said. "Stu
dents must be aware of what they are
getting into. Some can find [intern
ships] for academic credits through
specific departments. A person who
is very active and aggressive should
have a very successful outcome."
Career Services offers paid and
un-paid internships and co-ops.
There are many benefits to an in
ternship even if it is unpaid. "It cer
tainly enhances skills and communi
cation ability. Gaining real world ex
perience and learning the ins and
outs of a corporation are great things
to have. It's a great way to test your
decisions and see if that's what you
really want to do," Herrmann said.
According to the latest National
Association of Colleges and Em
ployers survey, more than 80 percent
of employers indicated all of their
new hires had done an internship or
co-op.
"The biggest benefit of an intern
ship and co-op is that it could turn
into a full-time position," Herrmann
said.
Approximately 650 students are
participating in both paid and unpaid
internships through the Career Ser
vices program. But there are other
ways to get internships and co-ops,
too. Internships that earn academic
credit can be set up through the dif
ferent academic departments at
Tech.
Atitaya Pratoomtong, junior soci
ology major and psychology minor,
is currently interning for Joel Jack
son, a private attorney in downtown
Blacksburg, Va., for academic credit.
She obtained the internship through
the department of sociology.
Pratoomtong said her internship
will be a beneficial experience.
"I want to go to law school. It's a
good experience to see what I'm get
ting into in the future. It's really
opened my eyes to what lawyers re
ally do, there's a lot of work that peo
ple wouldn't expect that takes a lot of
time and effort."
When people think of internships the
image of a college student running to
make the perfect cup of coffee for
the CEO usually comes to mind. Pra
toomtong said this isn't the case.
