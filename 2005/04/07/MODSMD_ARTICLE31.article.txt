# Spring brings out casual behavior
## 
### COLLEEN CORLEY INDIANA DAILY STUDENT 
(U-WIRE) BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — It
happens every year. When the sun shines, sitting
in a classroom sounds like an impossible task.
Students arrive late, toting snacks and drinks
and wearing smaller, shrunken versions of their
winter wardrobe. It seems the day spring arrives,
the rules of classroom behavior go out the win
dow.
"It just becomes a lot more loose," said
sophomore Clay Cook.
Cook is not the only person to notice the
change. Professors have to deal with students
whose reverence for formality has dropped
tremendously since they went to college, when
dressing to go to class often meant a nice shirt
and slacks for men or dresses for women — not
the uniform of miniskirts. Hip-flops and tank
tops visible each spring on lU's campus.
"Every generation has its features," said
Randall Powell, a professor in the Kelley School
of Business. "It was hot pants at one time, then
miniskirts. It was [about] really making a fashion
statement in the 70's and KO's. Now it's much
more about anything goes. You see anything in
the classroom today."
In the 19505, Indiana University had a LJni
versity-imposed dress code for dining rooms,
and Dean of Students Richard McKaig said he
would not be surprised if at one time the code ex
tended to classrooms as well. Today, though,
professors must establish their own rules regard
ing student clothing.
"As long as it is related to the purpose of the
course and could be logically explained," McK
aig said, "absolutely the University would sup
port that."
A University-published pamphlet called

"Guidelines for Dealing with Disruptive Stu
dents in Academic Settings" outlines what facul
ty can and cannot do to control behavior in their
classrooms. The University conducted a study in
1997 investigating what professors consider as
disruptive behavior before publishing the guide
lines.
"Usually there are issues related to classroom
disruption." McKaig said. "Typically it's behav
ior (where) most students would encourage the
faculty member to take action" because it in
hibits the learning environment, McKaig said.
Other distractions besides dress that might
escape student awareness relate to technology.
Laptops, iPods and cell phones appear in almost
every class, allowing students to do anything but
pay attention to their professors. For some stu
dents, class time has become an opportunity to
check e-mail, listen to music and text message
friends who are doing the same thing in a class
room across campus.
And students think the professors don't no
tice.
"I think that students aren't thinking about
the faculty," said Christine Barbour, a political
science senior lecturer. "1 could be wrong about
this, but we don't have a University culture of ci
vility and mutual respect."
Barbour said she blames not only students for
their bad behavior but also faculty members who
encourage the behavior by allowing disruptions
in their classrooms, she said.
"We don't ask enough of students," she said.
"We let them get by with it."
Barbour, who teaches several large classes,
has seen students crawling over seats to talk to
nearby friends and another student who poured
drinks for his friends out of a thermos, martini
style, during class.
"The biggest single behavior problem in large

classes is slovenliness," she said. "1 don't really
care if people bring a Coke or cup of coffee to
class, [hut] 1 walk out of class in Woodburn 100,
and it looks like a 747 after a transatlantic flight."
Some semesters, Barbour said she tries to
combat these problems by tying grades to atten
dance, which usually results in better overall
grades for students. At other times, Barbour
puts her faith in students' desire to learn at col
lege, even when it is sunny out, she said.
Like Barbour, many faculty members try to
circumvent behavioral problems by establishing
rules at the beginning of the semester. When a
student violates the rules, professors have sever
al options, such as speaking to the person in pri
vate or addressing the student in class — every
classroom sleeper's worst nightmare.
It happened to Cook last week, when much to
his instructor's annoyance, Cook fell asleep in
class.
"He called me out [and said], i do have some
self-respect,'" Cook said, adding that it does not
bother him when other students fall asleep or are
mildly disruptive in class as long as it is not a con
stant problem. "As long as you're not a distrac
tion it doesn't bother me."
Junior Lindsay Wade has the opposite reac
tion. Among the most irritating student behav
ior for her are smelly or noisy foods — chips are
the worst — and ringing cell phones.
"Everyone's cell phones go off," she said.
"There are people who will pick it up and have a
conversation [in class]."
Part of the problem could be the gradual evo
lution from a strict classroom environment to a
more lax setting, where students and professors
sometimes can resemble equals. Students ad
dress instructors by their first names, leave class
at their leisure and carry on conversations with
classmates when the professor is speaking.
