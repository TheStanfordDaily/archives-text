## The 						Double Clutch Parents forget it's only a game 
### 
My first stop when I visited my home
town over spring break was a blast
from the past: to see my beloved alma
mater play softball.
Seattle Prep had a powerhouse fastpitch
program in the late '90s that has recently fallen
on some hard times (mostly due to the popular
ity of the school's new lacrosse program). We
sent a pitcher to Villanova and were a regular
entry at state, and when cutting track practice to
attend games I had a ball chatting it up with
players' families, whether I knew them or not.
Boy. was I in fora surprise last month.
This year's parents seemed to resent my
being there. In between their talk of who didn't
gel in to what college and a laughable tale of a
"lockdown" at an elementary school in Bill
Gates' neighborhood, they found little time to

converse with or even ac
knowledge me. Not to men
tion they weren't even cheer
ing on their daughters.
I said to one of them,
"You look very familiar.
What is your name?"
She looked at me fora
second and replied "urn,
Liz." with a questioning tone
in her voice.
And then they all laughed

at me.
Well, pardon me, "Liz." Next time, I won't
take an afternoon to cheer on a team that gets
beat 10-0 and that isn't getting any verbal sup
port from its parent corps. I won't dare inter
rupt your gossip with concerns about what's
happening on the field.
I was shocked at the insolence; I had never been
to a sporting event with a less receptive attendance.
I recounted the incident to a good friend
who played catcher for the school. Her mom
had interesting advice for such parents: 'if
you're not going to cheer, then at least go
home and cook a good dinner."
Another person surprised by the incident
was family friend Dennis Olson, who taught
and coached at the school for over two
decades.
"I'm ready to leave sports behind, even for
kids," he said. "When 1 was young, youth
sports were not organized the way they are
now. Our parents didn't even come to the
games."
Olson added that baseball was a pickup
game on a dirt field.
He criticized win-now attitudes.
"People's priority these days is naming
someone the champion," he said. "After that,
it's being able to say you're better than some
one else or some other team."
He decried the lack of fundamentals he saw
in hisgrandkids'sportsexperience.
His talk reminded me of the question my
pole vault coach would ask me after meets:
"Did you have fun and did you learn any
thing?" ("Um. yeah ... I should have gone to
practice instead of watching Softball.")
Let me be sure at this point - many, many
Stanford students can tell of the positive im
pact of youth sports — the teamwork, the con
fidence-building. the free food after games.
And the outright fun — let's not forget that
part.

However, anyone who's played
sports knows stories of prepubescent
kids convinced they were going pro,
with dad acting as an agent. The name
Todd Marinovich comes to mind.
This sort of pushiness is mocked
by the catchall term "Little League
dad," and of course, it's the coach's
fault if things don't work out.
For some, the year-round training
and summer leagues are an invest
ment 6 not for fun, but for the hope
the kid will earn a college scholarship.
In high school football, parents
have gradually gained direct-dial ac
cess to school board members, ath
letic directors and even the superin
tendent. Coaches can land in hot
water for disciplining players, not
preparing kids for"the next level"
(as if colleges were turning down
can't-miss athletes because they
didn't play in the right offense) and
even running schemes that are "too
boring," winning notwithstanding.
This is not to mention the fear of

a lawsuit from parents who feel their
child was deprived of his civil right to
get playing time. (In those cases, a
termination is cheaper than fighting
the suit. Case closed.)
Now. I'm all for accountability in
the public sector, but this stuff is be
yond the pale. This is megalomania.
The ingrates running the asylum.
The foxes guarding the henhouse.
Kobe coaching the Lakers.
Administrators have gotten more
creative lately in disposing of coach
es at the behest of squeaky wheels.
Instead of being fired, coaches are
now "non-renewed" — simply not
contracted for the next season. Be
cause of unions, it is much more dif
ficult to terminate a teacher, but
those in coaching positions have no
legal recourse.
Things got even wackier in the
past year, as a number of coaches
across the country saw their jobs
"opened up" to other applicants.
The coaches were invited to reapply,
of course. I'll let the reader decide if
that's insulting or just emasculating.
