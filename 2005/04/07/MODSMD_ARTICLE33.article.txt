# Softball overcomes slow start in 2-0 win
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was clear from early on that the
No. 9 Stanford softball team (26-7,1-
2 Pacific-10 Conference), which post
ed eight blowout wins in the presea
son, would need to work a lull seven
innings to dispatch unranked San
Jose State, 2-0. in a non-conference
contest last night.
The Spartans (25-17) did little to
threaten the Cardinal, but the Stan
ford offense was less potent than
usual. Neither team could make
much happen at the plate early in the
game, with only one runner from
each squad reaching base in the first
inning.
The score remained scoreless in
the top of the second, although San
Jose State managed to put two run
ners on base following an awkward
throw by Stanford's senior catcher
Leah Nelson. Though it looked like
an easy out at second, the ball slipped
out of Nelson's hand and landed hard
at her feet. Clutch pitching by ace
Laura Severson got Stanford out of
the jam. as the junior struck out two
to retire the side.
The only score of the game came
in the bottom of the fourth inning
with two on when freshman in fielder
Tricia Aggabao sent the ball deep
into the right-centerfield gap off of
San Jose's Carol Forbes (15-13). Ag
gabao was credited with a double and
advanced to third on a fielding error,
the first time any player in either
dugout saw third base. Junior short

stop Lauren Lappin and Nelson, who
had both walked, scored on the play,
putting the Cardinal up 2-0.
A sacrifice bunt in the top of the
fifth gave San Jose its best scoring
chance of the night, putting runners
on second and third, but the Spartans
could not capitalize. A fly out to cen
ter stranded the runners and Stanford
held onto the two-run advantage.
It looked like the Cardinal would
extend the lead in the fifth inning, but
a spectacular defensive play by Spar
tan first baseman Lindsey Allen kept
the deficit at two. As junior outfield
er Catalina Morris crossed home
plate following a groundball by Nel
son. Allen laid out fora wayward
throw, keeping a toe on the bag for
the third out of the inning.
As the end of the game drew near,
the Cardinal clamped down defen
sively, preventing the Spartans from
getting anywhere near second base in
the last two innings. A quick three
outs in the top of the seventh inning
ended the game, giving Stanford the
victory.
Aggabao led the Stanford hitting
effort, going 2-for-3 with two RBI
while Nelson and Lappin each went
l-for-2. Severson (12-4) picked up
the win with three strikeouts in four
innings of work. Freshman Becky
McCullough finished the game in the
circle and tallied a save with two
strikeouts in the seventh inning.
Stanford will return to conference
play with a game against UCLA to
morrow and two more against Wash
ington on Saturday and Sunday.

Junior shortstop Laura Lappin scored one of Stanford's two runs yesterday against San Jose
State. Lappin went 1 -for-2 on a night when the Cardinal seemed to be out of their usual rhythm.
