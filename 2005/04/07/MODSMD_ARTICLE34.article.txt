# Precourt fills in for women
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Before coming to Stanford, freshman Aimee Precourt had
only competed nationally on two occasions. Four of her fellow
freshman teammates had competed nationally every year in
high school, three had garnered international experience and
two had placed in the top 10 at Olympic trials.
"Coming in on the low end was intimidating," Precourt said.
In Stanford's first meet of the season, she only competed in
one event and posted the team's lowest score of the evening.
But with half of her teammates now injured, Precourt will
compete in three, and possibly four, events in this weekend's
NC A A West Regional meet. Her scores will make a crucial dif
ference as to whether the No. 30 Stanford team (4-8.4-3 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) ends its season or continues on to its fifth
straight appearance at NCAA Nationals.
Intimidated, nervous, or pressured might be the first words
one would be inclined to use to describe the rookie's state of
mind.
Precourt, however, says that she has never felt im>re confident.
The Texan with a French first name has improved her gym
nastics throughout the season, beginning solely on the uneven
bars in the first meet and then adding floor exercise in the third
meet. She tied for third place in her first performance on beam
in the middle of the regular season and stepped up to vault for
the team for the first time at Pacific-10 Championships two
weeks ago. She was Stanford's third-highest scorer on vault and
beam at that meet and posted Stanford's highest score on floor.
Just two weeks before the meet, Precourt was not vaulting at
all due to some lingering back problems she encountered in
preseason training. She started doing some drills on the vault
with her teammate after practice, however, because "they
looked fun," she said.
Her coaches noticed that they also looked really good.
Two weeks later Precourt was competing a layout
Yerchenko at Pac-lOs.
Without her help, Stanford may not have had enough
healthy gymnasts fora full vault lineup at the championships.
Freshman phenom LizTricase, a National Champion on vault
was out with an ankle injury; Ail-American junior Glyn Sweets
was out with a foot injury; freshman Stephanie Gentry was out
with a sprained toe; and freshman Tabitha Yim. a fourth-place
finisher at Olympic trials, was still limited by a recovering
Achilles' tendon rupture.
"We've definitely had bad luck as a team this year with in
juries," Precourt said. "It has been discouraging because we
work really hard in the gym and think that we are doing well.
Then some injury comes up and we can't do as well as we had
thought."
As the team's struggle with injuries intensified over the
course of the season, Precourt faced more pressure to step up
the competitive caliber of her gymnastics.
"I felt the need to hit more routines in practice and at
meets," Precourt said. "It was no longer a matter of earning a

spot in the line-up, but a matter of
being in the line-up and having to
make my routines really good."
"I felt a real change in my gym
nastics and my outlook," she contin
ued. "Gymnastics was no longer
about me getting to compete, hut
about the team doing well."
The change in focus from her
own goals to the team's goals came
as a welcome surprise to the athlete
who, like all gymnasts, had been
used to competing primarily as an
individual before coming to Stan
ford.
Like her teammates, Precourt
has had her bouts with injury, too.
She sat out her sophomore season in
high school with a serious knee in
jury and still has the scar to prove it.
This year, she battled bulging discs
and inflammation in her lower back
during the preseason. The setback
makes her progress since then even
more remarkable.
"Aimee has just skyrocketed in

past months," head coach Kristen
Smyth said. " Her confidence, execu
tion and performance quality have
stepped up to a whole other level.
She is coming along beautifully just
in the nick of time for us."
Precourt's strengths are beam
and floor — two events that Stan
ford will need to shine in to qualify
for Nationals this weekend. Twelve
teams will be vying for the top two
spots to advance to Nationals. No. 2
UCLA has all hut secured the top
spot, hut Stanford, No. 12 Oregon
State, No. 24 Washington and No. 34
Boise State all have a viable chance
at claiming the second spot.
The Beavers topped the Cardinal
hy over a whole point at Pac-l()s, but
Stanford won the regular-season
meet held at the Farm. No. 24 Wash
ington beat Stanford in the regular
season, but fell just short of the Car
dinal at Pac-lOs. Washington will
have the home "mat" advantage this
weekend.
"It will be a great meet," Smyth
said. "We're in one of toughest re
gions with some spectacular teams.
Our focus is to hit 24-for-24 routines.
If we do that, we'll feel great about
ourselves and secure a spot."
