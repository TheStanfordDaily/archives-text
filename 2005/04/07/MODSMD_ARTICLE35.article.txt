With the playoffs just around the corner,
the pressure is on.
The No. 10 Stanford men's volleyball
team (10-12, 9-10 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) will play its last away game of
the regular season tomorrow against No. 12
Pacific (12-15,6-13).
Though the Cardinal, ranked seventh in
the conference, are currently set to play
into the postseason. Pacific will be fighting
to change that. The Tigers are just one spot

Clayton finished that season fifth on the
team with 64 kills and third for service aces,
with 14.
"Contrary to all my expectations coming
in, I ended up getting a lot of playing time
my freshman year in a position 1 never ex

member being totally surprised when the
head coach included my name in the open

made a mistake."
Years of experience in the sport helped
Clayton transition from high school to col
lege play successfully. He has been playing
volleyball since seventh grade, when a Boy
Scout leader who coached a local high
school team let him play at a camp for fresh
men and sophomores.
