# After mission, Clayton back on the court

### ALICE ANN SPURGIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the playoffs just around the corner,
the pressure is on.
The No. 10 Stanford men's volleyball
team (10-12, 9-10 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) will play its last away game of
the regular season tomorrow against No. 12
Pacific (12-15,6-13).
Though the Cardinal, ranked seventh in
the conference, are currently set to play
into the postseason. Pacific will be fighting
to change that. The Tigers are just one spot

out of the playoffs, and they are hoping to
climb into playoff contention at the last
minute.
Redshirt junior Will Clayton feels that
the Cardinal are ready to defend their play
off position.
"We've been playing our best volleyball
all season during the last couple weeks,"
Clayton said. "I think it's really important
for us to continue the momentum we've
built up through the next two weekends and
into the playoffs."
Clayton ought to know what he's talking
about. After all. he first joined the team as

a freshman five years ago for the 2000-2001
season.
Prepared to play at the outside hitter or
opposite position, Clayton was surprised
when the coaching staff switched him to
middle blocker. Standing only 6-foot-4, he
did not have the height of most middle
blockers. However, it was a perfect fit.
Clayton finished that season fifth on the
team with 64 kills and third for service aces,
with 14.
"Contrary to all my expectations coming
in, I ended up getting a lot of playing time
my freshman year in a position 1 never ex

pected to be playing," Clayton said. "I re
member being totally surprised when the
head coach included my name in the open
ing game starting lineup — I thought he'd
made a mistake."
Years of experience in the sport helped
Clayton transition from high school to col
lege play successfully. He has been playing
volleyball since seventh grade, when a Boy
Scout leader who coached a local high
school team let him play at a camp for fresh
men and sophomores.
"I was puny compared to most of the
Clayton well-traveled and well-read

guys, by far the shortest guy on the court,"
Clayton said. "But this gave me some good
motivation to improve my skills so 1 could
compete with guys who were better than 1
was."
Despite his dedication to his sport and
his promising freshman season, Clayton
left the team for two years. Recognizing a
greater dedication to his faith, he traveled
to Baltimore, Md.. to complete his Mor
mon mission.
"1 don't regret my decision fora sec
ond," Clayton said. "My mission is the
most valuable experience of my life thus
far. Some pursuits take priority over others
— they're simply more important. And it's
been my experience that when I've priori
tized the most important things, God has
facilitated the other areas of my life."
Rejoining the team after his time off, he
admits, was a challenge.
"I didn't do any weight-training or play
any volleyball, because I was focused on
my mission responsibilities," Clayton said.
"As a result, I lost 40 pounds of muscle
mass while I was gone. There were lots of
wide-eyed family members wondering how
1 got so skinny. But the coaches and my
teammates were absolutely patient and

supportive as I got back into volleyball
shape. I was really impressed by the way
they encouraged and helped me. All in all,
it took about eight months before 1 felt like
myself on the court again —just at the end
of last season."
At the end of that season, Clayton was
named to the All-MPSF Scholar-Athlete
Team.
"Yes, 1 am a nerd," Clayton joked.
"This is going to ruin my street cred, but
I've been waiting for the right moment to
pull this out: I have read every play ever
written by William Shakespeare. It was
part of an English course earlier this year,
and it nearly killed me."
Though being an English major means
staying up late into the night after a long
day of classes and practice, the experience
has been great for Clayton.
"For some reason, I think it's a lot easi
er to read a book or outline a paper than to
do a problem set when you're traveling,"
he said. "You can read a book with you
anywhere — on a plane or a bus or in a
hotel room. Doing problem sets and lab re
ports can be trickier."
While the life of a student-athlete at
Stanford can be challenging. Clayton feels

that being a part of the volleyball team is an
invaluable experience.
"Truth be told, it requires a lot of men
tal and physical stamina to get through the
season successfully," he said. "When you
try to stay in top competitive form from
September through April, you get tired
sometimes. But the length of the season is
also one of the things that have made it a
valuable experience. Who else has the op
portunity to compete against such highly
ranked teams and develop their skills in
such an intensive way? Because the season
is so long and demanding, you feel like
you've been part of something that was
truly important when the season ends."
That season ends in three more regular
season games, starting with tomorrow
evening's match against Pacific. Are the
Cardinal ready for the playoffs?
"1 think we've proven to the rest of the
league that we are a very dangerous team,"
Clayton said. "Regardless of who we play,
we have a legitimate chance of winning and
advancing far into the playoffs if we play
our best volleyball. We've played very
close matches against the top-ranked
teams. 1 think we can beat anybody if we
play the way we're capable of playing."
