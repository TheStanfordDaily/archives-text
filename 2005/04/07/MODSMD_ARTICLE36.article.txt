# Redesigned course to open
## Women host Barnard Invite 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After two-and-a-half months of digging, surveying,
grading and paving, the widening of Sand Hill Road is
complete, as is the redesign of the Stanford Golf Course to
accommodate said widening. As the commuter artery ex
panded onto the grounds of the golf course, holes No. 3
and No. 4 changed from a par 3 and par 4, respectively, to
a pair of par 3s. They will open for business for the first
time during Friday's practice round as the No. 21 Stanford
women's golf team hosts the Peg Barnard Invitational this
weekend.
"Those are a couple of new holes that we actually won't
even see until the practice round," head coach Caroline
O'Connor said. "We don't really know what to expect
there, so unfortunately we won't have any advantage on
those holes compared to the rest of the field."
The opening of the two new holes is just part of the ex
citement during a weekend that will see the Cardinal try to
defend their home course for the second year in a row. They
claimed the team title at last year's event, posting a com
fortable 14-shot victory over second-place Washington.
Stanford has been on the road since the beginning of its
spring season in early February, and its return home
couldn't come at a better time.
As the Bay Area's spring showers give way to sunny
skies, the rough at Stanford has sprouted up anywhere
from four to six inches high.
Come Saturday morning's opening round, it will have
developed an insatiable appetite for balata, gobbling up er
rant tee shots without remorse. It is a challenge that
doesn't worry the Cardinal. In fact, they are counting on it.
"The course looks good â€” I think it's set up to our
strengths," O'Connor said. "The rough is thick, and I cer
tainly think that plays into our strengths because we hit it
pretty straight."
If all goes according to plan for Stanford,
opposing players will need a full assortment
of gardening implements to find their golf
balls this weekend amidst the hay-like grass
that lies beyond the second cut of rough.
As the Cardinal look for their first team
victory of the season, expect junior Kelly
Husted to lead the charge. Her stroke aver
age of 74.9 is the lowest on the team and
nearly three strokes better than her previous
career average as she continues to forge one
of the most consistent seasons in recent
school history.
Also look for sophomore Jenni
Tangtiphaiboontana to take her game to the
next level amidst friendly surroundings.
"I've been playing pretty well,"
Tangtiphaiboontana said. 'But I'll have a

few holes where I'll get in a little slump, and
it takes me a little while to get out."
She was lights-out at this tournament a
year ago, shooting 74-71 to claim fifth place,
her best career finish.
With the forecast pointing to blue skies,
the 36-hole event will begin at 8:30 a.m. Sat
urday with a shotgun start and 18 holes of
competition. The second round will begin at
8 a.m. Sunday.
"This week, when we have home-field
advantage, it should play into our hands,"
Husted said. "If we just go out and play the
way we can, we can certainly win."
Meanwhile, Stanford's men are in
Tempe, Ariz., where they will compete in
the Thunderbird Invitational, hosted by No.
15 Arizona State. The two-day, 54-hole
event kicks off tomorrow with a full day and
36 holes of play, followed by a final 18 holes
on Saturday.
Coach Conrad Ray will take with him a
roster that includes freshman Rob Grube,
sophomores Zack Miller and Matt Sav
age, junior Kyle Gentry and senior Kevin

Blue, as the Cardinal try to erase the
memory of a 12th-place finish last year in
Arizona.
Despite still searching for their first win
of the year, the men are whistling a tune
quite similar to that of the women: success is
just around the corner.
"I'd say the confidence level is strong to
quite-strong heading into this weekend,"
Miller said.
Miller is the rare Cardinal player whose
memories of last year's Thunderbird are
happy ones. He notched a sixth-place finish
a year ago as part of a string of five consecu
tive top-10 showings in his freshman cam
paign.
In contrast to the women's tournament,
where scoring conditions will likely be diffi
cult. the men will look to take a more offen
sive approach in the desert this weekend.
"We need to make lots of birdies,"
Blue said. "The scores have traditionally
been very low at this tournament. We
need to be smart and pick our spots when
to be aggressive."
