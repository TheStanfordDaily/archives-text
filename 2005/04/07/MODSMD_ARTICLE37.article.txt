# Card head to NCAAs
## 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's gymnastics team
hopes it has saved its best for last as the Car
dinal travel to the United States Military
Academy in West Point, N. Y., this weekend
for the NCAA Championships.
The Academy will host the pre-qualify
ing sessions and the national championship
over the next three days at the Hollendar
Center, Pre-qualifiying begins today, and
the Cardinal must finish in the top three in
the Session One qualifier to move on. The
top three all-around competitors not on one
of the qualifying teams, in addition to the
top three individuals on each event not al
ready qualified on a team or as an all
around competitor, will advance from each
of the two pre-qualifying sessions to the fi
nals session.
The Cardinal are sending three of their
freshmen to compete in the All-Around:
Jason Shen, David Sender and Sho
Nakamori. Both Sender and Nakamori are
expected to place highly.
Ohio State lops the pack of schools at
NCAAs as the No. 1 seed. The Buckeyes are
looking to qualify for their 25th straight
team championship. Last year's champion,
Penn State, dropped to the five spot this
year, but is still a threat as it searches for its
NCAA record 12th title. Former power
house, Oklahoma, grabbed the No. 3 spot in
the ranking while Stanford is at No. 8.
The Cardinal have been gaining strength
as the season has progressed. The team
looks to end its season with a bang â€” the
squad reached two of the highest points of
its season in their last regular-season home

meet and in last weekend's Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation Championships.
On March 6, the then-No. 10 Cardinal
crushed No. 7 California at home with a
score of 222.675 to 219.775. Stanford took
first place on the rings, pommel horse, vault
and parallel bars, hut also did well on the
high bar in the upset.
The meet reached two different points
on emotional spectrum. It marked an
achievement on the scorecard. but it also
marked a sad time for some in the program,
as three seniors performed at their last
home meet. The team will be without Am
bert Young, Daniel Torres-Rangel and
Kelly Lang next season.
"it was a big right of passage coming
from an individual athlete and to see its evo
lution into a team sport," Young said.
As the Cardinal moved away from the
notion of being singular performers, they
inched closer to becoming a more cohesive
team. Stanford picked up steam as the sea
son went on and placed third at MPSFs.
That success should boost the Cardinal's
confidence as they head into the champi
onships.
Not only did the last home meet mark
the end of an era in the Cardinal gym, but
these NCAA championships also mark a
crossroad for the team; their senior mem
bers will participate for the last time, while
the freshman will compete in their first
NCAA championships.
According to freshman Chris Harper,
the Cardinal have had solid practices all
week in preparation for the NCAAs. Yes
terday was the men's final chance to test the
equipment in West Point before the pre
qualifiers kick off today.
