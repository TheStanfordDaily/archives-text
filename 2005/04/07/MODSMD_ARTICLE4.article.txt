# Trail through campus debated
## 
### ANDY SCHNEIDER 
In 1972, Nonette Hanko, founder of the Mid-Peninsu
la Regional Open Space District, envisioned a 15-mile
long trail extending from the San Francisco Bay to the
foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Thirty-three years
later, her dream is almost a reality.
Thanks to financial contributions from Palo Alto,
Santa Clara County, the Coastal Conservancy and pri
vate grants, the necessary land has been opened up for
the construction of the trail. The construction project will
likely require $3 million in funding, according to officials
involved in the project.
The trail will start at the Palo Alto Baylands, pass
through Palo Alto, and cross Stanford land before arriv

ing at the Enid W. Pearson-Arastradero Preserve. From
there, the path will guide hikers through Foothills Park,
onto the LosTrancos Open Space Preserve and finally to
the Monte Bello Open Space Preserve.
The trail will climb 1,800 feet and offer hikers a mix of
marshlands, levees, grasslands, woodlands, wildlife and
views of the bay.
Craig Britton, current general manager of the Mid
peninsula Regional Open Space District, said the trail is
"mostly there." But in order to create a continuous, safe
path, it will need to undergo some realigning, rebuilding
and even relocating.
Because much of the trail already exists, however,
there will be "very light disruption" in finalizing the plans
Britton said, adding that he estimates
the trail will be completed by the fall.
Anyone will be able to use the
trail for hiking, but no biking, horse
back riding or any other non-walking
activity will be permitted.
Though the idea for the Bay to
Foothills Trail appeals to regional
administrators, there has been some
controversy over Stanford's role in
the plans. To link Palo Alto and the
Arastradero Preserve, Stanford cur
rently offers hikers several trails
that run along the perimeter of its
land.
Britton contends that the trails —
one of which runs along the traffic
heavy Page Mill Road — are not
only unpleasant in ambiance, but are
also "unsafe." As a result, many are
urging Stanford to approve a trail

that would run along the southern
end of the Dish ridge. Such a route,
they argue, would be more aestheti
cally pleasing and direct.
Yet despite pressure from envi
ronmental organizations, public and
private agencies and hikers, Stanford
has been steadfast in prohibiting the
construction of this trail.
Jean McCown, director of com
munity relations for Stanford, ex
plained the University's opposition.
First, she said Santa Clara County
originally proposed the outer trails to
which Stanford agreed in 2(XH).
An "agreement is an agreement,"
McCown said, adding that if the
county had asked Stanford to allow
the trail to be built by the Dish, Stan
ford would have disagreed.
Second, McCown said the Uni
versity wants to preserve the land in
question. She said the trail would be
a "public road" that would attract
"too much traffic" and have an "im
pact on (the land's] long-term po
tential."
