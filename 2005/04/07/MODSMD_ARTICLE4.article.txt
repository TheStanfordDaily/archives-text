# Trail through campus debated

### ANDY SCHNEIDER 
In 1972, Nonette Hanko, founder of the Mid-Peninsu
la Regional Open Space District, envisioned a 15-mile
long trail extending from the San Francisco Bay to the
foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Thirty-three years
later, her dream is almost a reality.
Thanks to financial contributions from Palo Alto,
Santa Clara County, the Coastal Conservancy and pri
vate grants, the necessary land has been opened up for
the construction of the trail. The construction project will
likely require $3 million in funding, according to officials
involved in the project.
The trail will start at the Palo Alto Baylands, pass
through Palo Alto, and cross Stanford land before arriv

ing at the Enid W. Pearson-Arastradero Preserve. From
there, the path will guide hikers through Foothills Park,
onto the LosTrancos Open Space Preserve and finally to
the Monte Bello Open Space Preserve.
The trail will climb 1,800 feet and offer hikers a mix of
marshlands, levees, grasslands, woodlands, wildlife and
views of the bay.
Craig Britton, current general manager of the Mid
peninsula Regional Open Space District, said the trail is
"mostly there." But in order to create a continuous, safe
path, it will need to undergo some realigning, rebuilding
and even relocating.
Because much of the trail already exists, however,
there will be "very light disruption" in finalizing the plans
