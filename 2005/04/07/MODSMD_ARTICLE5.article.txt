# Investment disclosure denied
## 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford owns everything. At least according to
George Parker, chairman of the Advisory Board on
Investment Responsibility, who spoke at last night's
town-hall meeting addressing the University's invest
ment policies. According to Parker, Stanford current
ly owns or at some point during the last year has
owned shares in just about every company in the
world.
"Disclosure is off the table if we own everything."

Parker said. "If you have a problem with a company,
just assume we own it. The University holds so many
stocks that there is a large possibility we have a hold
ing in that company."
The meeting was called to provide a forum for ad
ministrators, faculty and students to discuss invest
ment disclosure and divestment of the University's
$12 billion endowment. Many of the Stanford com
munity members who attended lobbied passionately
for Stanford to invest more responsibly.
