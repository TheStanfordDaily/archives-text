# Investment disclosure denied
## 
### CASSIDY DELINE STAFF WRITER 
Stanford owns everything. At least according to
George Parker, chairman of the Advisory Board on
Investment Responsibility, who spoke at last night's
town-hall meeting addressing the University's invest
ment policies. According to Parker, Stanford current
ly owns or at some point during the last year has
owned shares in just about every company in the
world.
"Disclosure is off the table if we own everything."

Parker said. "If you have a problem with a company,
just assume we own it. The University holds so many
stocks that there is a large possibility we have a hold
ing in that company."
The meeting was called to provide a forum for ad
ministrators, faculty and students to discuss invest
ment disclosure and divestment of the University's
$12 billion endowment. Many of the Stanford com
munity members who attended lobbied passionately
for Stanford to invest more responsibly.

The Advisory Board on Investment Responsibility convened last night to discuss investment disclosure. Admin
istrators said that disclosue was out of the question because it is not practical or good for the University.
Panel discusses investments in Sudan

"Stanford has $12 billion dollars invested in
corporations that have a big influence in the
world," said senior Anna Mumford, a member of
the Stanford Coalition for Investment Disclo
sure, or SCID. "Stanford can have a really posi
tive or really negative influence."
Mumford and her peers' arguments for disclo
sure were met with an uncompromising attitude
from Parker and the other board members, who
argued that making the University's holdings
available to the public is logistically infeasible.
"It is primarily an issue of practicality," Parker
said. "The investment portfolio of the University
is dynamic, not static. Yesterday's disclosure is
not today's holdings."
He added that managers who govern the Uni
versity's holdings cannot do their job as effective
ly if information is disclosed as fast as it is re
ceived.
The board members seemed more open to dis
cussions regarding divestment of Stanford hold

ings in companies associated to Darfur, Sudan.
They confirmed that the University has $1 million
invested in the large oil company Petro-China —
one of the five identified companies helping to
fund the Sudanese government — and likely has
holdings in the other four. Yesterday, Harvard
announced its decision to divest from Petro-
China.
The board members said that Stanford's $1
million holding is insignificant considering that
the market value of Petro-China is about $12 bil
lion. However, Seth Silverman, a representative
from Students Taking Action Now: Darfur, or
STAND, insisted that the $1 million matters.
"The example of South Africa shows that di
vestment has contributed to the dismantling of a
oppressive regime that violates human rights,"
Silverman said, referring to the University's 1987
decision to divest from companies supporting the
South African government to protest Apartheid.
"And I do think that there is something to be said

about having a clean conscience and to give a cer
tain amount of assurance to every member of the
community that Stanford's dollars are not going
towards funding genocide."
The Darfur issue raised several issues of pro
cedure and identified the lack of mechanisms to
investigate companies.
"The panel says that they are there to respond
to student concerns, but then there is no way to
contact them," said senior Raphael Ginsburg, a
member of SCID. "They say that they expect stu
dents to initiate changes, but then they set this re
ally high bar for anything actually to get done.
They say that they don't have the resources to do
anything."
Those who attended the meeting agreed to de
velop a better system of communication between
board members and students.
"Overall I think that this was an interesting,
productive meeting," Parker said. "Free and
open dialogue is imperative to the University."
