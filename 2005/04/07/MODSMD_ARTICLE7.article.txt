"As the saying goes, in a PhD, you know
more and more about less and less,"
quipped Vijay Somandepalli, co-chair of
the Graduate Student Programming
Board, or GSPB.
Accordingly, the more doctoral stu
dents learn about one subject, the more dif
ficult it becomes for them to explain their
work to their peers in different fields.
To remedy this problem, the GSPB has
spearheaded an initiative to give those heav
ily involved in research a chance to work on
their communication skills, so that they can
present their work in layman's terms.
In coordination with the Office of the
Dean of Research and Graduate Policy and
the Graduate Life Office, the GSPB will be
holding an I-Rite mixer on April 14 at 6
p.m. in the Havana Room at the Graduate
Community Center. The I-Rite program is
designed to help graduate students present

their research sans technical jargon.
Students who attend will be offered free
dinner, a seminar on communication skills
from Carolyn Gale of the Stanford Re
search Communication Program and a
chance to meet one-on-one with a student
from a different department to practice
presenting their research in simpler, easily
understandable terms.
Somandepalli said that the people host
ing the event are "acutely aware of the fact
that advanced graduate students become
more and more isolated as their research
becomes more important."
He added that "these graduate students
interact with fewer people â€” mostly peo
ple in their own research groups and maybe
their departments at best."
The event is advertised as an opportunity
to "explain your research in Elevator-speak."
When presenting research, the two most com
mon problems that graduate students face are
