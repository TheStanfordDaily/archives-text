# Even underpressure...
## Taylor lives up to hype 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Coming into the season, Michael Tay
lor knew that he would face a high-pres
sure situation. Not only would the fresh
man have to adjust to the college game
and show that he belonged on one of the
best baseball teams in the country, but he
would also be thrown right into the start
ing lineup, taking Brian Hall's spot in
right field.
But if Taylor's feeling the heat, he's
not showing it. He was cool as a cucumber
last Tuesday, coming around from first to
score what proved to be the winning run
against Santa Clara to cap a six-run Car
dinal comeback.
And earlier this year, the heat of play
ing in Texas against the No. 1 Longhorns
didn't make Taylor sweat, either. He
broke out of a season-opening 5-for-28
slump that weekend, collecting three con
secutive multi-hit games and providing
some energy to an otherwise stagnant
Cardinal lineup. (Since that series, he's
hit .338 to raise his season average to
.293.)
Taylor came to the Farm with big ex
pectations riding on his broad shoulders
(he stands at an imposing 6-foot-6 and
weighs in at 235). There hadn't been a
more anticipated arrival at Sunken Dia
mond since that of John Mayberry, Jr., a
first-round draft pick, two years ago. Tay
lor was handed a starting job at the begin
ning of the season — an honor "that not
even Mayberry, Jed Lowrie or Sam Fuld
was awarded — and he was billed as a
true five-tool player.
How does Taylor handle the pressure?
All he has to do is think of the alternative.
"It's a lot better being here right now
than being in some podunk town, eating
7-11 hot dogs and nachos and stuff," he
said, referring to the travails of a minor
league baseball player. "Here you get fed
well, get taken care of, get a chance to
have an education, get a chance to play
some high-caliber baseball with these
great players. It's definitely worth it."
Taylor, like Mayberry, decided to
forego the draft and sign with Stanford,
though he was almost guaranteed a spot
