# Even underpressure...
## Taylor lives up to hype 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Coming into the season, Michael Tay
lor knew that he would face a high-pres
sure situation. Not only would the fresh
man have to adjust to the college game
and show that he belonged on one of the
best baseball teams in the country, but he
would also be thrown right into the start
ing lineup, taking Brian Hall's spot in
right field.
But if Taylor's feeling the heat, he's
not showing it. He was cool as a cucumber
last Tuesday, coming around from first to
score what proved to be the winning run
against Santa Clara to cap a six-run Car
dinal comeback.
And earlier this year, the heat of play
ing in Texas against the No. 1 Longhorns
didn't make Taylor sweat, either. He
broke out of a season-opening 5-for-28
slump that weekend, collecting three con
secutive multi-hit games and providing
some energy to an otherwise stagnant
Cardinal lineup. (Since that series, he's
hit .338 to raise his season average to
.293.)
Taylor came to the Farm with big ex
pectations riding on his broad shoulders
(he stands at an imposing 6-foot-6 and
weighs in at 235). There hadn't been a
more anticipated arrival at Sunken Dia
mond since that of John Mayberry, Jr., a
first-round draft pick, two years ago. Tay
lor was handed a starting job at the begin
ning of the season — an honor "that not
even Mayberry, Jed Lowrie or Sam Fuld
was awarded — and he was billed as a
true five-tool player.
How does Taylor handle the pressure?
All he has to do is think of the alternative.
"It's a lot better being here right now
than being in some podunk town, eating
7-11 hot dogs and nachos and stuff," he
said, referring to the travails of a minor
league baseball player. "Here you get fed
well, get taken care of, get a chance to
have an education, get a chance to play
some high-caliber baseball with these
great players. It's definitely worth it."
Taylor, like Mayberry, decided to
forego the draft and sign with Stanford,
though he was almost guaranteed a spot
in the first round, ranking eighth on Baseball Ameri
ca's list of the top 100 high school baseball prospects.
His adjustment to college ball has been a difficult
one, but Taylor has handled it in typical fashion — by
bearing down and working hard, a trait that he values
immensely.
"I've come through a lot of hard work and adjust
ments," he said. "I cut down my stride, right off the
bat, and I also had to make sure that my hands get to
the ball. You can get away from them in high school,
because pitchers don't keep fastballs down and the
breaking balls are a lot worse. 1 had to come here and
square some of those things away, and I'm still trying
to work hard at that."
He said that he is also trying to put the ball in play
more often to give himself a chance to use his speed
on the basepaths (he has stolen five bases in as many
attempts). His power game is still developing — he
has six doubles and a triple to his credit this season,
but no home runs yet — but Taylor is confident that
it will come with experience.
Part of the reason that he doesn't feel the pressure
of living up to the expectations he's created is that,
well, he doesn't pay much heed to what people say
about him.
"The pressure is not anything more than I put on
myself to come out every day and perform," he said.
"There's pressure just trying to win. I mean, what
other people think about me off the field is for them
to do. Guys like you are going to write your articles,
and I don't even really read them anymore. I stopped
picking up papers and reading articles after my
sophomore year [of high school in Apopka, Fla.J be
cause 1 just realized that the game's fickle. One week
end you're everything, the next weekend you're
awful. If you never read anything, then you're just
who you are to yourself."
Taylor certainly does not lack confidence, some
thing that Lowrie thinks is a key ingredient of his suc
cess thus far.
"He's a confident guy, and that's what you need
to be," Lowrie said. "1 think he straddles the line of
confidence and cockiness pretty well, which is espe
cially important fora baseball player. You have to
believe in yourself before anyone else will believe
in you."
But Lowrie also characterized Taylor as a team
player, someone who will lay down a bunt when the
situation calls for it, and said that the freshman has
worked hard on his game.
And that, more than any other accolade, is what
Taylor wants to be remembered for.
"When I'm done playing baseball, whether that's
three years from now or twenty-five years from now,
1 want to sit back and say I put everything I had into
the game, and 1 was either good enough or 1 wasn't,"
he said. "I never want to look back and say I should
have gotten more out of myself here or there. I just
want to be able to say I gave it everything I had, and
this is how it worked out."
If the early results are any indication, he is well
on his way.

believe in yourself before anyone else will believe
in you."
But Lowrie also characterized Taylor as a team
player, someone who will lay down a bunt when the
situation calls for it, and said that the freshman has
worked hard on his game.
And that, more than any other accolade, is what
Taylor wants to be remembered for.
"When I'm done playing baseball, whether that's
three years from now or twenty-five years from now,
1 want to sit back and say I put everything I had into
the game, and 1 was either good enough or 1 wasn't,"
he said. "I never want to look back and say I should
have gotten more out of myself here or there. I just
want to be able to say I gave it everything I had, and
this is how it worked out."
If the early results are any indication, he is well
on his way.
