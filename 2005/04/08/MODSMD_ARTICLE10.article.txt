# Students spice it up in cook-off

### FRANCIE NEUKOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Pan-seared salmon skin, salted spaghetti
squash and mangoes sliced paper-thin are
not items usually seen on the daily menu in
the Wilbur dining hall. But nothing was off
limits at yesterday's second annual Cardinal
Cook-Off, in which five pairs of students
competed fora grand prize of a $1 ,(XX) and a
set of chef's knives.
The contest was sponsored by Unilever,
the food-distribution company known for
Best Foods-brand mayonnaise, and the stu
dent cooks were required to use at least one
Unilever product from its Knorr division
line, which produces soup bases and olive

oils. In exchange, Knorr supplied the prizes
and professional chef's jackets with each
participant's name embroidered on the
front.
The student teams were also required to
use salmon as the main ingredient in their
own original recipe.
"We had the competition last year, but we
didn't have a theme ingredient," said Terry
Nahavandi, the general manager and execu
tive chef of Wilbur and Stern Dining. "It was
the first year, and we weren't sure of the kids'
competence. We thought if we let them
make grandma's chicken or a recipe they
were familiar with, it would be easy for them.
But once we realized their level of culinary
capability, we knew we could introduce a

new factor into the contest."
The competitors were chosen from a pool
of 20 team applicants. Each team submitted
a recipe to a panel of professional chefs who
followed the recipes and judged the results.
They made their selections based on recipe
creativity and adherence to the contest rules.
"Two seniors won last year, so we know
we'll get new winners this time," said Jeff
Rosen, a chef and production manager at
Wilbur Dining. "Two of the teams were par
ticipants last year."
Teams' starting times were staggered by
ten minutes, and each had 75 minutes to cook
and present their dish. They were required to

make four portions of their entree,
two for display and two for the four
judges to sample. The judges scored
entrants on a 40-point scale, rating
such factors as the team's organiza
tion, sanitation and safety practices,
creativity, serving presentation and
minimal waste of ingredients.
Senior Sarah Bei and sophomore
Leah Sawyer reigned victorious this
year, winning fora meal of pecan
crusted salmon with Rhode Island
johnnycakes, warm five-spring
onion salad and chardonnay-maple
sauce. The two teammates squealed
with delight, hugged and jumped up
and down when the awards were an
nounced.
"I can't believe we won," Sawyer
said. "I was in the competition last
year with someone else and we got
last place. We just tried too hard and
made the recipe a little too gourmet.
I was so mad and wanted to try again.
It's not really the money I'm excited
about â€” I just really like winning."
She added that Rosen had acted

as their team's chef mentor, and that
she was pleased to be able to "win
for him."
Sawyer said she began baking in el
ementary school to learn fractions and
has loved cooking ever since. Eve so,
she has no plans to become a chef. In
stead, her ambition is to one day work
for the Food and Drug Administration.
Bei had watched Sawyer in last
year's competition and when Sawyer
mentioned entering again, Bei eager
ly volunteered to be her partner. The
two prepared the salmon dish about
eight times in the Wilbur kitchen
under Rosen's guidance.
"Leah is better at the technical
things," Bei said. "1 have always
loved cooking, but I'm more a baker
than a chef. I was in 4-H when I was
little and did stuff like entering my
preserves in fairs."
In addition to cooking, Bei also
runs on Stanford's track team.
"I'm going to run professionally
fora few years after I graduate," she
said. "After that I want to teach in
Latin American countries. I'm going
to be on more mission-type things,
so I won't have time for cuisine. But
then I'll get to be inventive with my
food preparation, which is really
what makes cooking fun."
