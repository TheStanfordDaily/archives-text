Pan-seared salmon skin, salted spaghetti
squash and mangoes sliced paper-thin are
not items usually seen on the daily menu in
the Wilbur dining hall. But nothing was off
limits at yesterday's second annual Cardinal
Cook-Off, in which five pairs of students
competed fora grand prize of a $1 ,(XX) and a
set of chef's knives.
The contest was sponsored by Unilever,
the food-distribution company known for
Best Foods-brand mayonnaise, and the stu
dent cooks were required to use at least one
Unilever product from its Knorr division
line, which produces soup bases and olive

oils. In exchange, Knorr supplied the prizes
and professional chef's jackets with each
participant's name embroidered on the
front.
The student teams were also required to
use salmon as the main ingredient in their
own original recipe.
"We had the competition last year, but we
didn't have a theme ingredient," said Terry
Nahavandi, the general manager and execu
tive chef of Wilbur and Stern Dining. "It was
the first year, and we weren't sure of the kids'
competence. We thought if we let them
make grandma's chicken or a recipe they
were familiar with, it would be easy for them.
But once we realized their level of culinary
capability, we knew we could introduce a

new factor into the contest."
The competitors were chosen from a pool
of 20 team applicants. Each team submitted
a recipe to a panel of professional chefs who
followed the recipes and judged the results.
They made their selections based on recipe
creativity and adherence to the contest rules.
"Two seniors won last year, so we know
we'll get new winners this time," said Jeff
Rosen, a chef and production manager at
Wilbur Dining. "Two of the teams were par
ticipants last year."
Teams' starting times were staggered by
ten minutes, and each had 75 minutes to cook
and present their dish. They were required to
