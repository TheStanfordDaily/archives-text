# Education profs, combat high school stress
## 
### JOE SEXTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For many students, admission to Stan
ford was the crowning accomplishment
after years of grinding college preparation.
While the thick envelope in the mailbox
justified all the late nights, long practices
and hours of community service — as the
admit folder famously points out — some
Stanford educators are concerned that high

school stress is taking too high of a toll on
American adolescents.
The problem inspired Stanford Educa
tion Prof. Denise Clark Pope to initiate a
project called Stressed Out Students, or
SOS, in 2(X)4 to combat academic stress in
both middle and high schools in the south
ern Bay Area.
"When we talk about academic stress,
we see students who have too much work to
do and too little time in which to do it," she

said in an interview with The Palo Alto
Weekly. "We send messages as parents, ed
ucators and as a society that those who get
the best grades and who go to the best
schools are considered successful."
Pope said that many of these people
have a problematic definition of success.
According to SOS co-founder Mollie
Galloway, a researcher at the School of Ed
ucation. the project is intended to challenge
what many educators believe to be a nar

row and destructive approach to learning
and student development.
Galloway said SOS is "an intervention
and research project" that puts on an annu
al conference in local middle and high
schools.
The first such conference was held last
spring and brought SOS educators together
with parents, teachers, students and admin-
istrators to brainstorm strategies to
steer secondary schools away from
becoming pressure-cookers fo
cused exclusively on college admis
sions.
"We live in an achievement-ori
ented society and there is a constant
stress that we have to be the best at
whatever we do," Galloway said in
an interview with the Daily. "Our
definition of success is based on
outcome and so kids believe that
the only way to achieve success is to
get the best grades to get in to the
best colleges, which will lead to a
successful career."
She added that it is critical that
educators remember that kids are
still kids.
"They have to have time to be
creative, to just hang out and to
relax," Galloway said. "To me, the
best thing to recommend is to edu
cate not just for academic achieve
ment. We also need to think about
the physical, the social and the emo
tional. We need to make sure that
education is focused on the whole
kid."
To this end, SOS organizers urge
that secondary schools switch to
block-scheduling so that teachers
can present material in alternative
ways and cultivate better relation
ships with their students. SOS coor
dinators also want schools to evalu
ate the way they reward academic
scholarship and consider placing
less emphasis on grades. Teachers
should also cut down on the amount
of busy work assigned.
But some at Stanford are wary of
these potential changes.
"I wouldn't say that a heavy
focus on college admissions in high
school is necessarily good or bad —
it's just the reality," said junior
Scott Chanatry. "I don't think high
school should stop preparing kids
for college, but if there are exces
sive pressures put on students it can
be detrimental."
Intense pressure was a reality for
most Stanford students in high
school. And while most are proud
of their admission to one of the na
tion's top universities, some said
look back on their high school ex

periences with regret.
"There were a couple instances
in high school where the adminis
tration discouraged me from taking
the kinds of classes that I wanted
because they wouldn't look good
on a high school transcript," sopho
more Bharat Venkat said. "I
thought it was really irritating in
terms of the fact that 1 wanted to
learn something that was valuable
to me as opposed to some stupid
AP class."
Galloway said this approach to
education not only stifles creativity
and passion for learning, but can
also lead to destructive behaviors
like cheating.
"There are several reasons why
kids cheat," she said. "They don't
have enough time to do their work,
so they cheat. They are forced to do
busy work that they feel won't
teach them anything, so they cheat.
They fear that they won't get the
grades to get into a good college,
and so they cheat."
The annual SOS conference,
which will be held at Stanford May
13-14, includes a workshop dedicat
ed to addressing the issue of cheat
ing and its relationship to academic
stress.
Organizers of SOS said their
greatest fear is that the current state
of secondary education will give
rise to a generation of adults who
are narrow-minded, overly achieve
ment-oriented and burdened by
psychological disorders.
At Stanford, Vaden Student
Health Center and the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center provide services
to help students cope with stress
and other problems that might re
sult from a lifestyle of constant
pressure.
"[Academic] stress is our number
two [most demanded] category of
counseling after relationship stress,"
said senior Brett Lockspeiser, a
Bridge counselor. "I wouldn't say
that students are usually burned out
from high school, but [life at Stan
ford] is a continuation of that high
stress, overcommitted mentality."
Galloway said that parents have
good reason to be concerned about
the situation.
"Parents see their kids becoming
robots," she added. "They're not
even engaging in the learning pro
cess. It's scary to think that might be
the kinds of adults we're creating."
