## 
### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Thousands of people, includ
ing many families with young
children, are expected to come to
campus from Palo Alto and sur
rounding cities this Sunday for
Stanford's fourth annual Com
munity Day celebration. The
day-long event will take place be
tween the Oval and the Quad
where students will host art exhi
bitions, music performances and
athletic events. Faculty members
from various departments will
also deliver lectures.
The festival, sponsored by the
Office of University Communi
cations, is designed to forge a
stronger relationship between

Stanford and nearby communi
ties.
Ryan Foley, the event coordi
nator, said he kept this goal in
mind while planning the day's ac
tivities.
"We want to make them
aware of what the University of
fers them, their communities and
region," Foley said. "We try to
make them aware of the Univer
sity's academic and research mis
sion and how they can take ad
vantage of the public programs
we offer."
There will be three key facul
ty lectures in the afternoon at the
History Corner.
Tom Robinson, associate pro-
fessor of pediatrics, will speak
about childhood obesity in his talk
entitled, "Keeping kids healthy and
fit: Responding to the obesity epi
demic."
"We are facing a tremendous
health crisis," Robinson said. "As
more and more people are becom
ing aware of its severity, they want
to know what they can do, for
themselves, their families, their
schools, their communities and the
country or world as a whole. I hope
to inform them of the facts and help
them identify strategies that they
can implement in their own lives."
Profs. Jeffrey Koseff and Buzz
Thompson, from the Stanford In
stitution for the Environment, will
speak on environmental sustain
ability, and a panel of distinguished
physicists including Robert Byer,
Andrei Linde, Doug Osheroff and
Helen Quinn will discuss the great
est achievements in physics over
the past 100 years.
Last year, approximately 10,000
people took part in the festivities.
According to Alan Acosta, director
of university communications, hun
dreds of people from the Stanford
community are helping to make the
day run smoothly. This year, there
are 28 student groups, 25 Universi
ty offices and many more student
volunteers involved.
"We funded more student
groups this year because the sur
veys suggest that parents appreci

ate the opportunity for their chil-*
dren to interact with Stanford stu-J
dents," Acosta said. "In fact, about*
75 percent of our visitors bring chil-}
dren."
Participating student groups are",
given a $ 1,000 grant to put together;
their day's presentations, which
range from lessons on the basics ofj
Frisbee by the Women's
Frisbee Team to a booth on Peking'
Opera run by the Forum for Amer-"
ican / Chinese Exchange at Stan-'
ford.
While the main goal of thel
event is to strengthen community
relations, members of Stanford's.
Amnesty International
said they want to use their presen-*
tation to raise awareness about
important international issues.!
According to group member
Grainger, a junior, the groups
hopes to take this opportunity to
share their human rights advoca-*
cy work with the broader commu-,
nity.
"If just one visitor to our table is
motivated to join Amnesty Inter-*
national or write a letter to their
senator or representative express
ing concern over the genocide oc-J
curring in Darfur or examine our
administration's human rights
record at home and abroad, our!
presence at Community Day will
be well worth the effort," Grainger
said.
Community Day, which will end
at 4 p.m., is also held in conjunction
with the University's Founder's"
Day celebration. The Mausoleum,
The Cantor Arts Center
Hoover Tower will also be open to
the public on Sunday.
