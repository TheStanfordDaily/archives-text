# Phone scammers offer fake grant money
## 
### CHUAN-MEI LEE DESK EDITOR 
Last Sunday, freshman Danielle
Lostaunau answered a call on her cell
phone and was told that she had been
chosen to receive a very special $8,000
grant. All she needed to do was provide
her bank account number over the tele
phone. Lostaunau almost complied.
"I actually did not know it was a scam
until my friend who was here told me it
was," she said.
The man who called her had a heavjf
foreign accent and introduced himself as
Frank Taylor, a representative of the Na
tional Government Grant, Lostaunau
said.
The man identified Lostaunau by her
full name and claimed that he had ob
tained her information through the city
government of Palo Alto.
She was told that she was eligible for
grant money because her records showed
that she had paid her taxes and had not
declared bankruptcy. Throughout the
conversation, the caller was very pushy
and continually pressed Lostaunau for
her bank account number. When she
asked why the information was neces
sary, the caller maintained that making
out a check for the grant would be im
possible without it and that the funds
needed to be transferred directly into a
bank account.
Sophomore Ryanne Brown received
a similar phone call on her cell phone the
Monday before spring quarter classes
began. Like Lostaunau, Brown was told
that she would receive a grant from the
government if she provided a bank ac
count number. Brown also noted that the
caller seemed to know that she was a col
lege student because he asked her about
scholarships.
"Fora moment I was really scared be
cause I got on the government's do-not
call list two months before, and the per
son must have gotten my phone number
illegally," Brown said. "But I equated it
was like e-mail spam to rationalize things
and decided not to worry about it fur
ther."
Neither Brown nor Lostaunau knew
how the callers obtained their names and
cell phone numbers.
Deputy Ken Bates of the Stanford
University Department of Public Safety,
or SUDPS, suggested that the phone
scam callers might have been able to lo
cate students using local telephone direc
tories or the Stanford Who Web site.
While Lostaunau and Brown avoided
falling victim to identity theft, Bates cau
tioned that the best thing students can do
is protect their cell phone information
and financial records. Bates will be giving
a talk on identity theft at the School of
Medicine on April 13 at noon.
The SUDPS reported that so far this
year, there have been 10 cases of identity
theft on campus, five of which involved
students. Last year there were a total of
21 cases, including six cases involving stu
dents.
While Lostaunau did not report the
incident to the police, she and two friends
sent out an e-mail message to members
of her dorm informing their classmates
that they might be at risk. The e-mail was
then circulated by resident assistants to
students in other dorms.
"We wanted to warn other people
who didn't know [about the phone scam]
to not be as naive as I was," Lostaunau
said. "1 was about to give them my bank
account number because 1 had no previ
ous experience with phone scams what
soever."
