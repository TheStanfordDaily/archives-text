On April 8, 1968, The Daily pub
lished a story about the rallying of
black students at Stanford against
racism in America by burning a flag
in response to the death of Martin
Luther King Jr. Below is an excerpt:
"The burning of an American
flag last Friday at noon accompanied
a warning from black Stanford stu
dents that Stanford whites had bet
ter 'get together' and
'clear your own house.'
"The Black Student Union-spon
sored rally on White Plaza featured
eight black speakers whose reac
tions varied from mild prophesies to
bitter hatred and vivid threats.
"One of the speakers, Dolores
Mack, told the crowd of over a hun
dred whites, 'I don't want to see your
white faces. 1 don't even want to talk
to you. You killed Martin Luther
King, you, the people in front of
me."
"One of the more militant speak
ers, Art Wilson, gave the students an
ultimatum: 'You [whites] have been
killing us fora long time but now it's
not going to be us who are going to
die.'
"Black Student Union Co-Chair
man Kenny Washington finished the
program by telling the crowd, ' This
j King's murder] is nothing new to us.
Whites have been exterminating
blacks for 400 years. For 30 years
after the civil war whites were killing
off blacks at the rate of one every
other day. During the period of 1900
to 1926, whites were killing one
black every third day. We expected
Dr. King to be shot.' "

On April 8, 1963, The Daily cov
ered a story about the challenge made
from the University of California
Davis firemen to the Stanford fire
men fora race. Below is an excerpt:
"The Stanford Student Firemen's
Association has been challenged to a
Make and Break' race by the Stu
dent Firemen of the University of
California Davis.
"The challenge came about as the
result of an article on the Stanford
student firemen in the Pacific Coast
Fire Journal. The Davis firemen, not
to be outdone, issued the challenge,
which Stanford answered in a letter
saying that 'Make and Break' races
were 'trivial pastimes indulged in
only by rural departments which
have nothing more productive to
do.'
"To compensate the Davis fire
men for this parliamentary nuisance,
Stanford offered 'to reciprocate by
sending a book of matches with com
plete instructions for their ignition
and extinction.'
"Inside sources report that the
Stanford team is now 'practicing
madly' for the 'Make and Break'
contest, a type of relay race that
involves the successive coupling
of 50-foot lengths of hose to the
engine, each other and the nozzle
by each member of a four-man
team.
"Stanford's Four will meet Davis'
'on the field of glory' on Saturday,
April 27,1963."
