## Erotica for the I-Hum kid and other travesties 
### 
Unlike some people, I love movie trail
ers—partly because I have the at
tention span of a five year old and 1
can t handle more than two or three minutes
of visual stimulation at a time and partly be
cause they usually end up being way better
than the movies they are advertising.
The "Sin City" trailer, for example, kicks
ass. You've got your gratuitous violence
(courtesy of Quentin Tarantino), awesome
soundtrack, sharp camera shots, pretty peo
ple and a plot so complicated you don't un
derstand. It's fantastic. And so you assume
the movie itself is probably decent.
Not that I would know, though. As a
freshman without a car, I have limited mobil
ity. I often forget that I am capable of driving
a car and that I'm not a high school freshman
anymore, even though I still have to bum
rides off of upperclassmen and ride public
transportation to get anywhere.
So instead of seeing "Sin City" this past
weekend like most others on campus (read:
upperclassmen). I saw "Closer" at FLiCKS,
the only movie worth seeingwithin biking/
walking distance. Or so I

thought.
I was heartlessly de
ceived by the trailer of this
movie. When 1 saw the
trailer, I'd thought. "Wow
— nice music, seemingly
interesting plot, deep nar
ration, famous (and pret
ty) actors — this might be
a good movie."
But instead of an off-

beat romance / drama I got something that
may as well have been erotica for the I-Hum
kid. There's a lot of sex, or at least talk about
sex (both online and offline), "deep" intellec
tual conversation, sluts, hookups, breakups
and just your general whoring around.
I'd rather have bought "Careßears: Jour
ney to Joke-A-Lot" from the $5 bin at Target
than spend $6 to see this Oscar-nominated
film. At least the Careßears wouldn't have
spent the entire two hours sleeping around
with each other, cheating, engpgyig in intel
lectual discussion and ther\ sleeping qroi+nd
some more.
But "Closer" wasn't my only disappoint
ment. To be honest, movies this past year
have been less than satisfying. From "Con
stantine" (which stars Keanu Reaves in his
most challenging role yet since "Bill and
Ted's Excellent Adventure") to "Guess
Who" (with Ashton Kutcher playing... the
same guy he always plays) to "The Ring
Two" (which I'll admit was scary but only be
cause that freak of a girl is in it), none of the
movies this year have managed to live up to
expectations.
Which is why I propose the trailer replace
the movie as a form of art, since it's almost al
ways better anyway. Those glorious two to
three minutes of explosions, really long dra
matic make-out scenes and punch lines, all
narrated by an eerie deep-voiced man to the
latest Top 40 Hit, highlight the parts of a
movie actually worth seeing and skip over the
unnecessary ones, like plot progression or
character development.
In general, the trailer is better than the
movie in the way that Zach Braffs "Garden
State" is a lot better than the actual Garden
State or in the way that (as some "Passion of
the Christ" viewers insist) the book is better
than the movie. You can't really beat
Matthew's account of Jesus' teachings or
Mark's account of Jesus' death. Plus, the
whole Aramaic-with-English-subtitles thing
is so overdone — if I wanted to spend two
hours reading, I would've just broken out the
big book myself.
But back to the point. If directors just
made trailers and didn't bother with the full
length feature they'd save us all the hassle of
being disappointed.
Take the Star Wars trailers. The trailers
for Episode II (and now lll)generated insane
amounts of hype and for good reason. They
didn't include Hayden Christensen acting
like a whiny little sissypants Jedi — they
showed him brooding, skilled and hot. They
didn't show Anakin and Padme frolicking
awkwardly through the meadow — they
showed crazy gladiatorial light saber fights
with a hell of a lot of Jedis.
What would best save the Star Wars pre
quel trilogy is if they kept the films as trailers
rather than full-length movies. Don't worry
about fleshing out the plot or making Hayden
Christensen act; a good trailer with lots of ex
plosions and fight scenes and minimal acting
or dialogue is all you need.
Now, I realize that there are fundamental
flaws to this otherwise original and practical
suggestion, such as how can you replace
movies with trailers when trailers are meant
to promote movies?
I don't know. I didn't really think this one
out that well. To be honest, I just started writ
ing this because I was bitter about being
forced to watch "Closer" since I couldn't get
a ride to "Sin City." But that doesn't make my
proposition any less probable.
In a world where the Careßears can make
better movies than the combined powers of
Jude Law, Natalie Portman. Julia Roberts
and Give Owen, anything is possible.

In a world where the Careßears can make
better movies than the combined powers of
Jude Law, Natalie Portman. Julia Roberts
and Give Owen, anything is possible.

If you have a car and can give Shivani a ride to
a movie theater nearby, e-mail her at
