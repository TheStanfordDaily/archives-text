# In good ‘Company’
## 
### EMMA VAUGHN STAFF WRITER 
As the curtain closes at the end of Act I in this year's Ram's Head The
atrical Society's production of "Company," Director Merritt Baer tells
the actors to take a five-minute break during their long rehearsal before
they have to reassemble for Act 11. There are only 14 performers in the
production, an unusually small number fora spring musical, but their
stage presence, combined with a uniquely majestic set, more than com
pensates for the lack of bodies.
"Things are going well tonight," said Baer. a sophomore and first-time
musical director. "We've been in full dress rehearsal for almost two
weeks so I think the show should be really strong by the first perfor
mance."
"Company, which opens tonight in Memorial Auditorium, marks a
departure from many of the standard Ram's Head musicals. Unlike past
productions such as "Kiss Me Kate" or "West Side Story," "Company"
epitomizes the Broadway transition from the standard happily-ever-after
plot line to the non-linear, concept piece.
"Theoretically, the concept we're developing is that the entire show is
taking place in my head as I'm making a wish at my birthday party," said
senior Chris Babson, who plays the lead character Bobby. "There are re
peated birthday parties throughout, in order to tie this conceptual line of
the metaphysical "birthday' throughout the story. Every thing that hap
pens has happened at one point, but it's all going on in my head."
Originally written as a collection of one-act plays, the story was mold
ed into a musical by director Harold Prince and Stephen' Sondheim.
When the show first appeared on Broadway in 1970, it stunned audiences
and was awarded a record number of Tony Awards, including "Best Mu
sical,' "Best Music" and "Best Lyrics." Tlie production closed in 1972
after 7()6 performances.
The story follows the lite of 35-year-old bachelor, Bobby, as he grap
ples with the significance of intimacy and relationships through experi
ences he has had with 10 friends, who are all in relationships.
"He has five couples of married or soon-to-be married friends," said
freshman Clea Alsip, who plays one of Bobby's past girlfriends. "They
comment on his life throughout the play and serve as a kind of Greek cho
rus because they're always on stage."
While the story centers around Bobby's personal experience, it is also
a commentary on the complexities of love and marriage and the sacrifices
that are part of each.
"'Company' is probably the closest thing that you can get to 'Sex and
the City, the musical'" said Baer. "It's very Manhattan, very edgy, very
trendy and very chic. We play around a lot with the story, trying to blend
the atmospheres of both 2005 and 1970 so that people will relate to it
more."
The music in the show is famous for its distinctively non-stereotypical
numbers. Unlike mainstream musicals with fright melodic ballads. Sond
heim's pieces are far more copiplex and said.

"They are complex out of necessity," he said. "It may
be initially harder to work through for both the per
formers and audience, but it is much more fulfilling in
the end."

The emotional intensity present in Sondheim's
songs also adds a unique level to his work.

"What makes his songs the best is that you
begin every single one of them with a complete
sense of security in who you are and what your
ideals are," said Babson. "But by the end
you're completely lost and you don't know
where to go."
The cast and crew have been in daily re
hearsals since the beginning of winter quar
ter, including eight-hour-days during spring
break.

"We started in January, rehearsing five
nights a week for four hours," said Babson.
"Now we're up to about six hours a day. But
a lot ol people, besides me, have more than
two days a week when they don't have to be
there."

For Babson, who hopes to pursue acting
and music after he graduates this spring, it's

been a particularly rigorous process. With
six songs and hundreds of lines, he leaves
the stage fora total of only 10 minutes

during the entire two-hour production.
Learning the songs and dances,
however, was only one of the many
tasks that the "Company" ensemble
took on in the last few months. During
spring break, the group spent the ma
jority of time building the intricate set.
"We were going for minimalism on
a grand scale," said Baer. "It is intend-

Ed to reflect the embodiment of
New York City on a stage
while keeping the distinction
between reality and fantasy
intact."
One would assume that
spending more than 30 hours
a week with the same group of
people might get slightly ex
hausting. The crew of this show,

however, said they are al
ready sad about their
separation — even ( be r
fore the curtains liave
risen for opening night.
"It's really awesome
because everyone is so
close to one another,"
Alsip said. "The small cast
makes people even closer.
Initially we did a lot of cast
bonding exercises like im
prov. and various activi
ties that really brought us
together, and it's been re
ally nice since."
Some of the cast
members attribute this
amiability to the specific
rehearsal methods that
have been used.
"I've really enjoyed
the way that Merritt has
set it up." said sopho
more Kanyi Maqubela,
who plays one of the hus
bands in the play. "He's

had each couple work together on their own fora lot of the lime, and then
he s moved us into the whole group. It makes me feel like I'm first a part
of my couple and then part of the whole ensemble."
Baer contributed much of this cohesiveness and smoothness to the
fact that there are so few characters in the production, which allows ev
eryone to have a distinct place.
"Everyone has a role and everyone is important." said Baer. "There's
no chorus, and everyone has their own song or at least their own verse in
a song. It really makes it so that a lot of people can shine."
Baer said he hopes that students will come away from the show with
an understanding that not all musicals need a happy ending.
"In this musical it's about losing something." said Baer. "It's about los
ing your way and realizing that you can feel the notion of 'being Alive'
without having a happy ending."

however, said they are al
ready sad about their
separation — even ( be r
fore the curtains liave
risen for opening night.
"It's really awesome
because everyone is so
close to one another,"
Alsip said. "The small cast
makes people even closer.
Initially we did a lot of cast
bonding exercises like im
prov. and various activi
ties that really brought us
together, and it's been re
ally nice since."
Some of the cast
members attribute this
amiability to the specific
rehearsal methods that
have been used.
"I've really enjoyed
the way that Merritt has
set it up." said sopho
more Kanyi Maqubela,
who plays one of the hus
bands in the play. "He's

had each couple work together on their own fora lot of the lime, and then
he s moved us into the whole group. It makes me feel like I'm first a part
of my couple and then part of the whole ensemble."
Baer contributed much of this cohesiveness and smoothness to the
fact that there are so few characters in the production, which allows ev
eryone to have a distinct place.
"Everyone has a role and everyone is important." said Baer. "There's
no chorus, and everyone has their own song or at least their own verse in
a song. It really makes it so that a lot of people can shine."
Baer said he hopes that students will come away from the show with
an understanding that not all musicals need a happy ending.
"In this musical it's about losing something." said Baer. "It's about los
ing your way and realizing that you can feel the notion of 'being Alive'
without having a happy ending."

"Company," which opens today. The Tony-
Award-winning musical, produced by the
Ram's Head Theatrical Society, is directed
by Merritt Baer. Performances are this
weekend and next weekend at 8 p.m.
As the curtain closes at the end of Act I in this year's Ram's Head The
atrical Society's production of "Company," Director Merritt Baer tells
the actors to take a five-minute break during their long rehearsal before
they have to reassemble for Act 11. There are only 14 performers in the
production, an unusually small number fora spring musical, but their
stage presence, combined with a uniquely majestic set, more than com
pensates for the lack of bodies.
"Things are going well tonight," said Baer. a sophomore and first-time
musical director. "We've been in full dress rehearsal for almost two
weeks so I think the show should be really strong by the first perfor
mance."
"Company, which opens tonight in Memorial Auditorium, marks a
departure from many of the standard Ram's Head musicals. Unlike past
productions such as "Kiss Me Kate" or "West Side Story," "Company"
epitomizes the Broadway transition from the standard happily-ever-after
plot line to the non-linear, concept piece.
"Theoretically, the concept we're developing is that the entire show is
taking place in my head as I'm making a wish at my birthday party," said
senior Chris Babson, who plays the lead character Bobby. "There are re
peated birthday parties throughout, in order to tie this conceptual line of
the metaphysical "birthday' throughout the story. Every thing that hap
pens has happened at one point, but it's all going on in my head."
Originally written as a collection of one-act plays, the story was mold
ed into a musical by director Harold Prince and Stephen' Sondheim.
When the show first appeared on Broadway in 1970, it stunned audiences
and was awarded a record number of Tony Awards, including "Best Mu
sical,' "Best Music" and "Best Lyrics." Tlie production closed in 1972
after 7()6 performances.
The story follows the lite of 35-year-old bachelor, Bobby, as he grap
ples with the significance of intimacy and relationships through experi
ences he has had with 10 friends, who are all in relationships.
"He has five couples of married or soon-to-be married friends," said
freshman Clea Alsip, who plays one of Bobby's past girlfriends. "They
comment on his life throughout the play and serve as a kind of Greek cho
rus because they're always on stage."
While the story centers around Bobby's personal experience, it is also
a commentary on the complexities of love and marriage and the sacrifices
that are part of each.
"'Company' is probably the closest thing that you can get to 'Sex and
the City, the musical'" said Baer. "It's very Manhattan, very edgy, very
trendy and very chic. We play around a lot with the story, trying to blend
the atmospheres of both 2005 and 1970 so that people will relate to it
more."
The music in the show is famous for its distinctively non-stereotypical
numbers. Unlike mainstream musicals with fright melodic ballads. Sond
heim's pieces are far more copiplex and said.

"They are complex out of necessity," he said. "It may
be initially harder to work through for both the per
formers and audience, but it is much more fulfilling in
the end."

The emotional intensity present in Sondheim's
songs also adds a unique level to his work.

"What makes his songs the best is that you
begin every single one of them with a complete
sense of security in who you are and what your
ideals are," said Babson. "But by the end
you're completely lost and you don't know
where to go."
The cast and crew have been in daily re
hearsals since the beginning of winter quar
ter, including eight-hour-days during spring
break.

"We started in January, rehearsing five
nights a week for four hours," said Babson.
"Now we're up to about six hours a day. But
a lot ol people, besides me, have more than
two days a week when they don't have to be
there."

For Babson, who hopes to pursue acting
and music after he graduates this spring, it's

been a particularly rigorous process. With
six songs and hundreds of lines, he leaves
the stage fora total of only 10 minutes

during the entire two-hour production.
Learning the songs and dances,
however, was only one of the many
tasks that the "Company" ensemble
took on in the last few months. During
spring break, the group spent the ma
jority of time building the intricate set.
"We were going for minimalism on
a grand scale," said Baer. "It is intend-

Ed to reflect the embodiment of
New York City on a stage
while keeping the distinction
between reality and fantasy
intact."
One would assume that
spending more than 30 hours
a week with the same group of
people might get slightly ex
hausting. The crew of this show,

however, said they are al
ready sad about their
separation — even ( be r
fore the curtains liave
risen for opening night.
"It's really awesome

Alsip said. "The small cast
