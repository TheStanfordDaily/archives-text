# Pac-10's top pitching staff comes to town
## Card face OSU 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In January, the baseball world
wasn't paying any attention to Oregon
State. The Beavers were picked to fin
ish sixth in the Pacific-10 Conference,
their postseason hopes looked grim
and their top players were outshone
by conference stars from Stanford,
Arizona and Washington.
Just a few months later, the base
ball world's wide-eyed stare is direct
ed right at Corvallis, Ore., as everyone
waits to see what the No. 16 Beavers
(24-4,3-0) will do next.
They've already burst into the na
tional top 25 and only one nationally
ranked team has fewer losses than
OSU. They've accumulated the low
est team ERA in the Pac-10 and the
second-highest team batting average.
They've helped boost players like
Dallas Buck and Jacoby Ellsbury into
the national spotlight.
The only thing left to do is prove
that it's for real.
Oregon State's schedule to this
point has presented few major chal
lenges. The squad did win its only
matchup with a top 25 team â€” nab
bing a 12-6 victory over No. 24 Arizona
State in February. And OSU swept its
first conference series of the season last

weekend
against a
mediocre Cali
fornia team.
But it takes
bigger wins
than those to
prove that
you're not a
fluke, not just a
group of lucky
ballplayers,
which is why
the Beavers
could be play
ing a little
harder when
they roll into
Sunken Dia
mond this
weekend to
face the No. 10
Cardinal (18-9,
3-0).
"Anytime
a team comes
here, they
love to beat

us," sophomore righthander Jeff
Gilmore said. "It's not a tribute to
what we've done lately; it's more of
a tribute to what the guys that came
before us have done in this pro
gram. Beating us at home produces
prestige."
Keeping Oregon State from
earning some of that prestige will
not be an easy task for Stanford,
which is also coming off of a confer
ence sweep over a weak Washing
ton State squad. The Beavers of
fense, headed by Ellsbury's league
leading .448 average, is not tremen
dously powerful, but has made a
habit of getting on base often and
crossing the plate when it counts.
In order to harness the OSU of
fense, Gilmore said that the strategy is
simple.
"We have to keep the leadoff man
off base," he said. "That ties the man
ager's hands. They can't bunt, can't
steal."
The Cardinal pitching staff's abil
ity to employ that strategy will be es
pecially crucial because of Oregon
State's speed. Ellsbury and Tyler
Graham have swiped a combined 27
bases on the season, which is more
than the entire Stanford squad has
for the year.
OSU's pitching may be an even
bigger concern for the Cardinal.
Coming into the weekend with a 6-0
record and a league-best 0.84 ERA
in 53 2/3 innings, righthander Buck
has been an unmatched ace for the
Beavers. He is followed by equally
strong starting arms in lefthander
Anton Maxwell (5-0, 4.03) and
righthander Jonah Nickerson (6-0,
1.17). Two other hurlers, Nate Fogle
and Kevin Gunderson, have com
bined for 10 saves and boast ERAs
of 1.32 and 2.61, respectively.
According to Cardinal catcher
John Hester, the Stanford offense's
performance hinges on focus, some
thing that the team was able to do in
its 44-hit weekend in Pullman.
"We were fired up at Washington
State because it was our first confer
ence game," Hester said. "We have to
keep that mentality, focus from the
first pitch to the last pitch."
The matchup between the Pac
10's only remaining undefeated
squads will begin today at 6 p.m., and
tomorrow and Sunday's contests will
kick off at 1 p.m.

Sophomore third baseman and leadoff man Adam Sorgi will have the challenge of sparking the Stanford
offense this weekend against one of some of the conference's most dominant hurlers.
