## Editorial Conservatives deserve a better paper than The Review 
### 
For the second year in a row. The Stanford Review
has unfairly attacked a minority student group re
questing special fees. Last year it was MEChA. this
year it is the Black Student Union, or BSU. To make
matters worse, this year's article was distributed only
days before the ASSU's election.
While many students dismiss and ignore The Re
view's smear campaigns, there is no denying that the
conservative newspaper has influenced the last two
ASSU elections; last year, MEChA failed to receive
the required number of votes to get special fees, and
this year, the BSU has had to fight hard to defend it
self against The Review's attacks.
So the question becomes: does The Review exist
solely to create controversy?
The Review is, on the whole, an unprofessional
publication. The aesthetics of the newspaper — its
poor layout and fuzzy pictures — do not do justice
to the exorbitant funding it receives from its
founder, Peter Thiel, Class of 1989 and founder of
the on-line payment company Pay Pal. As the so
called voice of the conservative minority on campus.
The Review has a responsibility to hold itself to a
high standard of professionalism and accuracy. At
the very least, its staff must begin to double-check
its facts before printing articles that make unsub
stantiated inflammatory statements and misrepre

sent the parties involved.
More importantly, The Review ultimately fails at
its job < >112 properly representing the conservative voice
on campus.
There are, of course, many liberals who denounce
The Review for its politically extremist articles, but
there are also many moderately conservative students
who find themselves embarrassed by the newspaper
that is supposed to represent their views. For exam
ple, the size of the Stanford College Republicans club
is significantly larger than the contributing staff of
The Review.
While it should not hesitate to print unpopular
opinions. The Review's writers must work harder to
base their articles on logic and substantiated facts. In
doing so, The Review would take large steps in fos
tering better political dialogue that leads to construc
tive, illuminating discourse between groups on cam
pus, particularly those with differing ideologies.
In order to achieve these goals, The Review should
consider turning to the Hoover Institution for help.
While members of the Hoover Institution often take
equally contn >versial views, these opinions are gener
ally backed up by research. And if the institution can
not take an active advisory role with the newspaper,
Review staffers would do well to follow the Hoover
Institution's example.
