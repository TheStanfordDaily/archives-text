# Counting sheep
## Equal admission, equal housing 
### 
Last Tuesday at approximately 10
p.m. my slatemates and I left the all
frosh Rinconada Dorm in Wilbur, the
very last stop oti 'our week-long;
dorm-to-dorm, room-to-room cam
paign trail. After reciting our plat
form at least S(X) times, often to audi
ences made up of a single freshman, I
have come to the conclusion that dur
ing each of those campaign stops we
unknowingly omitted a crucial facet ol

what will or will not be a winning policy proposal: all
freshmen should live in all-freshman dorms.
The difference between those constituents living with
the upperclassmen and those freshmen surrounded by
peers was striking. For one, the ratio of open to closed
doors in the four-class dorms is daunting and certainly
stand-offish. As simple and insignificant as the status of
doors may seem, it is in fact perhaps the most telling fea
ture of the dorm experience.
Nothing is more disheartening (to a campaigner) or
preventative to forming relationships than a closed door.
If these doors could talk, it seems like the one-sided con
versation would go something like this: "Hello, my name
is Bob. I drew a 2.7(H), so let me wallow in my own self
pity. Have a nice year." I would contend, and* I believe
few would disagree, that no freshman deserves such a
welcome — especially if their peers are off in a Junipero
or a Donner or a Branner discovering the Farm with Ko+
first-years.
That's another thing. Not only are the freshmen who
wind up in Granada or Arroyo or Twain, etc. dispersed
amongst upperclassmen (who in all fairness are by no
means all bad news), but there are also that many fewer
freshman with whom to create meaningful friendships.

Personally, I had the immense good fortune to wind up
in Otero (the all-freshman "manwich") and have made
some amazing friends with the guys on my floor and the
girls above and below (hence, the "manwich"). Each of
those freshmen were basically at my fingertips — the
friendships nearly automatic. There exists, after all, an
undeniable tendency to bond first and foremost with
those one lives with.
I do not wish to imply, however, that those freshmen
in four-class dorms cannot make just as enduring friend
ships. Rather, creating those relationships is just that
much harder — or so I've heard repeatedly. From here I
will operate on the understanding that is widely taken
for granted at Stanlord — the freshman experience is,
on average, more positive in all-frosh dorms.
So why should 1 have been so lucky as to be selected
for an all-frosh dorm? Chance, it would seem. Now
where is the fairness in that? Each freshman was admit
ted on equal terms, so why not afford them all equal op
portunities to have the optimal freshman experience?
It is high time that all freshmen are placed in the all
freshman dorms.
And while it may be Hue that the inclusion of freshmen
in four-class dorms livens up the experience for those
who draw unpreferred, a group of randomly selected
freshmen should not have to sacrifice their freshman ex
periences for this end. The arbitrariness of how the
freshman housing "cookie" crumbles is ridiculous.
Equality is key. And I'd have thought Stanford, with its
keen focus on first-years, would be acutely aware of this
truth.

Kaliuii praises God that campaign week is over and
couldn't be happier to retreat back to his "manwich."
