Campus Latino community is not exclusive or fake
When I read the article "Stanford ranked No.l for His
panics" (April 6), I had to check the front page to make
sure I wasn't reading The Stanford Review. The article
seemed to suggest "many students" were unhappy with
campus' Latino community: there were negative com
ments from two students and none from the other side.
To write a story about how Stanford is a good school for
Latinos and only print negative opinions from a couple
of students is completely one-sided.
Not every Latino student is involved in the Latino
community, and not every Latino student has to be. It's
your own choice. But to say the Latino community is "ex
clusive" and "fake" is just straight-up wrong. The com
munity puts on numerous events, especially during Ori
entation — such as the Centro Welcome, the Festival
Latino and the Big Sib Lil' Sib Program — and everyone
is (extensively) invited to come and see if they want to
become part of a Latino student group or just part of the
community. No one is excluded from the community,
just ask any student (Latino or not) who has actually
wanted to be involved. Sometimes students are so shy or

insecure that no welcoming event will persuade them to
stop by El Centro Chicano. And that's fine, but you can't
call that "exclusion."

Views in news article are unrepresentative
of Latino community
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the arti
cle "Stanford ranked No. 1 for Hispanics" (April 6).
The Latina/o students interviewed for this article ex
press some very negative opinions about Stanford's Lati
na/o community. Not only are their opinions unfounded,
but they are also unrepresentative of the majority of
Latina/o students on campus. It is unfortunate that The
Daily did not find it necessary to interview a single stu
dent who, unlike those interviewed, finds value in com
munity centers like El Centro Chicano and who does not
subscribe to a colorblind ideology.
