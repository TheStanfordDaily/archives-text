## Pope John Paul II and the ethics of responsibility 
### 
The death of
Pope John Paul
II last Saturday
was grieved by
the millions of
Catholics to
whom his passing
was both unsur
prising and un
bearable, was
met with ambiva
lent mourning by
those left disaf-

fected by the crimes and corruption
of the Church and provoked deep
thinking among all of us who con
template the vexed role of Catholi
cism in the modern world.
The old question, "Is the Pope a
Catholic?" has always had the obvi
ous affirmative answer. But was the
now-late Karol Wojytla a Catholic,
in the universal sense of the word?
The answer is far less simple.
The paradoxes of the Catholic
Church and the Pope were best illu
minated for me as 1 traveled in Chile
last year. On the one hand, 1 read
about the 1987 visit in which the
Pope cautiously but clearly de
nounced the dictatorship of Augusto
Pinochet. By then, global attitudes
had made it politically correct to dis
claim Pinochet, but the Pope's mes
sage was no less inspiriting.
On the other hand, I also heard
stories of public-health "matrons"
who today substitute their own reli
gious views on sexuality for actual
medical advice. Such views are fed by
conservative clerics, who in turn take
their cues from the Pope's trenchant
positions against contraception, mas
turbation. divorce and women's em
powerment. The Pope's influence on
the well-being of Chile has been com
plex and contradictory.
John Paul's sexual views were
often defended by invocation of
Scripture or tradition. But the
Church, like all modern institutions,
has changed tradition for the pur
pose of continued global relevance,
and it has deemphasized the Bible's
more retrograde lessons so as not to
countenance slavery and other evils.
The Church has shown, in short, a
wise willingness to adapt its pedigree
to the demands of a modern, earthly
world.
This history of practical mal
leability, along with the Church's
professed commitment to the wel
fare of the poor, compels one to
measure its tenets against secular
and earthly standards of progress. In
this sense, the shortage of sexual
self-autonomy among certain seg
ments of the Chilean population
must be due in part to the passed
down ideology of the papacy.
If the oppression of women re
tards ethical, material and cultural
development, and if we are to lay the

rose of fairness at the grave of John
Paul, then we must take his own role
in that oppression as a sign that cow
ardice — along with courage —
were as well-attested in the late
Pope as they are in all of human so
ciety. He has been both too Catholic,
and not Catholic enough.
If Hannah Arendt and an Israeli
court found that a simple-minded
"functionary" like Adolf Eichmann
was a source of immoraf statecraft of
the highest magnitude, then the con
verse can also be true. Thus, it is our
duty to locate some of the blame for
the human consequences of high
level dogma in the thoughtless per
mission of our revered international
leaders.
It has always struck me, from my
Catholic upbringing, that religion is
a question of locality. The pastor in
my hometown was loving and noble,
and he earned our adoration for rea
sons perhaps more secular than
pious. The parochial school one city
north, meanwhile, was sexist and
small-minded.
When I speak of locality, I would
be remiss to ignore that I am from
Massachusetts, the heart of the cler
gy sex-abuse irruptions. The blame
for these enormous crimes extends
from knowing parishioners who
maintained their silence; to priests
who promoted docility by shrinking
from even questioning their over
seers; to Bishop Thomas Dupre,
who officiated my confirmation and
now faces serious accusations of
sexual abuse; to the Papacy, which
gave Bernard Law. the unspeak
ably corrupt former cardinal of
Boston, an exculpatory appoint
ment in Rome.
This has been the rare week in
which a great many individuals were
referred to by a great many news
sources as "sheep" flocking to the
obsequies of their "shepherd" and
took it as a compliment.
One hopes that those of the
"flock" pick up the dissident spirit of
the many Catholics in Massachusetts
who have either committed to be
burrs in the saddles of their parishes
or who have gathered to form splin
ter groups.
Those of the flock and of the
cloth will all do well to remember
that human ethics are more impor
tant than dogmatic morals, and that
ethical rigor flows both from child to
Pope and from Cardinal to lay per
son. If the failings of the Pope and
his institution remain forgotten or
ignored, as papal history demon
strates they might be, then any po
tential for the Church to engage the
world positively will be squandered
altogether.
