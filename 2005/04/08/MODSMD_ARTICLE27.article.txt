# Engineer relates work to terrorism
## Isenberg analyzes threat posed to U.S. infrastructure 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Engineer Jeremy Isenberg discussed the role of
civil engineering in homeland security last night at
the fifth annual John A. Blume Distinguished Lec
ture entitled "A Rational Defense Against Irra
tional Acts: Civil Engineering Aspects of Home
land Security."
Approximately 1(X) attendees listened as Isen
berg explained how protecting U.S. infrastructure
involves not only politics but also economics and
technology. Since Sept. 11,2001 there has been re
newed interest in how different aspects of engi
neering can protect vital bridges, tunnels and build
ings.
"We cannot eliminate risk, we can only hope to
manage it," Isenberg said. "We hope to find rea
sonable responses to these irrational acts."
Funding for retrofitting and research on U.S. in
frastructure typically comes from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. De
partment of Defense, respectively. Local agencies

handle maintenance and operations.
Isenberg said that quantifying risk helps clarify
how much money should be spent to fortify struc
tures that could potentially he damaged in case of
an attack or natural disaster.
"1 think one of the real strengths of Jeremy's
talk was his idea of demystifying the problems,"
said Gregory Deierlein, the director of Stanford's
John A. Blume Earthquake Engineering Center
and professor of civil and environmental engineer
ing. "Developing a framework to look at the likeli
hood of a terrorist event is key. Once each part is
analyzed, we can integrate this information into a
full assessment."
Isenberg described two components of risk as
sessment: developing a system to identify high-risk
structures and discovering scientific ways to deter
mine the likelihood that they could be targeted in
an attack. Armed with this knowledge, officials can
evaluate what needs to be done to strengthen an at
risk structure or site.
For example, Isenberg noted that most of the in
juries and deaths in terrorist attacks occur because
of flying glass, lo minimize this risk, he recom
mended using laminated glass and structural sili
cone sealant.
In addition to locating at-risk infrastructure,
more accurate risk assessment can aide those who
are considering buying terrorist insurance. Isen

berg said that insurance is often an unknown com
ponent of risk management. He noted that an in
creasing number of people are purchasing insur
ance against terrorist acts. Currently, more than 50-
percent of building owners have some insurance,',
but not enough, he added.
Students in attendance were impressed by the
discussion.
"What I found particularly interesting was the
collaboration of methods in earthquake engineer
ing and in blast engineering not often seen in class
es I've taken in school," said Kyle Douglas, a third
year doctoral student in civil engineering.
Cameron Hufford, first-year graduate student;
in structural engineering, said he believes that peo
ple take the existence of safe buildings for granted.
"I thought this talk was particularly valuable in il--
lustrating the amount of energy that has gone into pro
tecting American infrastructure and lives," he said. 'T,
also thought it was interesting how it highlighted a few;
ways that Stanford contributed to that effort."
lsenberg is the present and CEO of WeidlingeÂ£
Associates, Inc., a civil and structural engineering;
and software development firm that was
in designing the window system for the U.S. Pen-;
tagon that was partly installed prior to the Sept. 11
2001 attack. No one in the restructured section of
the building perished in the terrorist attacks, Isen-;
berg said.
