# Minority women earn more than white peers
## 
### SARA INÉS CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When it comes to money, gender equality is be
coming a little less black and white.
On March 28, The New York Times ran a story
reporting that "black and Asian women with
bachelor's degrees earn slightly more than similar
ly educated white women," and that "a white male
with a college diploma earns far more than any
similarly educated man or woman.'
The U.S. Census Bureau supported this finding
in March when it released data showing that in
2(X)4 non-Hispanic white males with bachelor s
degrees earned a median of $51,650, while their fe
male counterparts earned a median of $32,006, al
most $20,000 less.
The bureau's report also broke down wages by
ethnicity. Asian women earned a median ol
$36.974."b1ack women earned a median of $35.107,
and Hispanic women earned a median of $32,459.
But the accuracy of this data, and its signifi
cance remains unclear. "You can choose
numbers that will suit whatever axe you want to
grind," said Stanford Economics Prof. John Pen
cavel. "The more you know [about the people you
are analyzing), the harder it is to be definite about

it."
Pencavel, who specializes in labor economics,
said that articles like the one that appeared in The
New York Times must be taken with a grain of
salt.
"Numbers like this are reported very often," he
said. "But the appropriate context and qualifica
tions are rarely provided."
First off, the article used the mean of the data
gathered instead of the median. Pencavel and stu
dents from his labor economics class agreed that
using the mean is not the best strategy to produce
meaningful figures.
"The median [of national wage data] is less af
fected by outliers," said senior Joey Natoli. "The
Bill Gateses of the world — who make incredible
sums of money — sort of distort it."
When millionaires' earnings are averaged in
with those made by people living below the pover
ty line, the resulting average wages are not repre
sentative of most people's yearly income.
In addition. The New York Times article used
figures for white, rather than white non-Hispanic
individuals, which also skews the data. Political
Science Prof. Luis Fraga said.
"You have to use non-Hispanic white numbers
to be more accurate," he said.

In the past the Census Bureau reported that
about 48 percent of Hispanics identified them
selves as white, which has a major impact on earn
ings studies.
Yet, while the data might have been manipu
lated in the article to draw attention to the pay dis
parity between white and minority women, there
are underpinnings of truth.
One possible explanation for the difference is
the fact that more white women are married to
white men. who bring in higher incomes than an\
other group. For this reason, white women have
less need to make high wages.
Using statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Labor.
Natoli demonstrated that non-Hispanic more
white women work part-time relative toother eth
nic groups. And working less hours translates di
rectly into lower annual earnings.
" That seems to indicate a pretty strong reason
as to why white women appear to earn less per
year," Natoli said.
Pencavel and his students also attributed the
discrepancy to cultural, geographical, and educa
tional differences. Language barriers and discrim
ination also play into how much money women of

varying ethnicities make each year.
Feminist Studies Chair Andrea
Lunsford underlined the wage gap be
tween genders as the most important
finding.
"I'm all for all women earning
more — and more, and more, and
more, and never apologizing for it,"
she said.
The amount of time women take
off from work to have children, the
amount of hours worked, cultural dif
ferences and marital status all play
strong roles in determining how much
women earn compared to their male
peers and one another, Natoli said.
