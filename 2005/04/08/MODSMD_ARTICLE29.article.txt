# Judicial Affairs puts out Honor Code guide
## 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
Freshman Laura Holmes admits
that she is uncertain of what what
exactly qualifies as an Honor Code
violate and what does not.
"I'm taking a computer science
class this quarter and the staff kept
stressing how important the Honor
Code is," she said. "It's kind of con
fusing for us as students: for exam
ple, my 1-Hum teaching fellow en
courages peer revision and sharing
ideas. To go from that to computer
science — where using even a line
of the same code can get you in trou
ble — can be disorienting."
Holmes isn't alone. Although
most students have heard the phras
es Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code repeatedly during
their time at Stanford, few know ex
actly what they include.
While the Fundamental Standard
asks students to be "good citizens,"
the Honor Code covers academic vi
olations, like plagiarism and cheat
ing. Sanctions for violations of the
Fundamental Standard vary widely
due to its subjective nature, but stu
dents who break the Honor Code in
any way face a quarter-long suspen
sion and 40 hours of community ser
vice.
The Office of Judicial Affairs, or
the J AO, which administers the stu
dent judicial process at Stanford, re
cently released a guide to help stu
dents, faculty and staff better under
stand the system of identifying vio
lations and assigning penalties.
According to the JAO, 124
Honor Code violations were report
ed to the Office of Judicial Affairs
by Dec. 9 for the previous school
year. Of the 48 cases that were
heard by a panel, 45 resulted in
sanctions against students.
Laurette Beeson. judicial advisor
for the JAO. said that the guide is
intended to be a reference for pan
elists at judicial hearings.
"The JAO also gets a lot of ques

tions from students in the middle of
the judicial process, and we hope
that this guide will help them as
well," she said. "Of course, this is
not a case of picking your own
penalties. But a list of mitigating or
aggravating circumstances, for ex
ample, will make sure that there are
no surprises. My personal goal is for
the judicial process to be transpar
ent."
The guide also addresses the im
pact of sanctions on individual stu
dents. While judicial panels must
consider facts in each case as well as
any precedents, they have the dis
cretion to consider evidence of "un
duly or unreasonably harsh im
pact."
The guide covers the possible
consequences violations to both the
Honor Code and Fundamental
Standard have on academics, inter
national visas, scholarships, athletic
eligibility, job offers and graduate
school admissions.
Undergraduate and graduate
students account for six of the 15
people sitting on the Board of Judi
cial Affairs, which creates Universi
ty policy in regard to student judicial
affairs. A student also serves as co
chair of the board and chairs every
judicial hearing; four of the six pan
elists who hear cases must be stu
dents as well.
Senior Sarah Belton, a member
of the Board of Judicial Affairs, said,
that most of the policies that impact
students were influenced by student,
input.
"Students play a large part in how
judicial processes are determined,"!
she said. "They might not be as visi
ble, but there's definitely a large ef
fort of the J AO, the Board, and the
panels to make the process transpar
ent while maintaining confidentiality.!
Our main focus is to make sure
cial policy is efficient and in line with
the charter, and there's always room
for improvement."
