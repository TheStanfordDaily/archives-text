# Women meet 2004 champs
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
This week. Major League Baseball
players all over the country suited up
for the long season ahead. For these
men, there's still plenty of time to
tweak batting stances and shore up in
consistencies. For the Stanford soft
ball team (26-7,1-2 Pacific-10 Confer
ence), however, the window for mak
ing adjustments is getting smaller.
While more than 20 games remain
on the schedule, the time has arrived
for the No. 9 Cardinal to pick up any
slack from the previous two months.
Stanford's tough Pac-10 schedule,
which continues today with a game
against No. 12 UCLA (26-2, 0-3) at
Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadium,
doesn't allow much room for trying
out new techniques.
The Cardinal, however, seem to
have settled into a groove. Leaders
who remain from last year's Women's
College World Series team —junior
shortstop Lauren Lappin and senior
catcher Leah Nelson — have been
hitting well, with 34 and 35 hits, re
spectively. In addition, junior center
fielder Catalina Morris is fulfilling her
role as the Cardinal's offensive spark
with 34 RBI.

the only ones

"We're right there," Lappin said of
where the team stood with highly
ranked rivals last Sunday. "Anyone in
the Pac-10 can beat anybody else. The
conference will prepare us for the
World Series and the postseason."
With the time until the NCAA
Tournament ticking. Stanford does
have a few kinks to work out. The Car

This weekend, freshman Tricia Aggabao and the No. 9 Cardinal
will face UCLA, against whom Stanford has a 7-31 all-time record.
ting slump. While the hats are ahle to
connect, timely hitting has been a prob
lem of late.
As of March 28, Stanford had
outscored its opponents 188-53 in 25
matchups. The team played only three
one-run games and only seven two-run
games and scored more than six runs in
12 tilts. The Cardinal scored two runs
or fewer in only five games.
Since the conference season kicked
off, however, the Cardinal have gone 2-
2 and have scored a total of only six
runs.
This weekend would be a perfect
lime for the Cardinal lineup to return
to its early-season form. After one
game against UCLA, Stanford will
take on No. 20 Washington (17-11.1-2)
tomorrow and Sunday.
Today's 7 p.m. start will be the first
meeting between the top-notch pro
grams since the Bruins sent the Cardi
nal home in last year's WCWS. After
defeating Stanford 3-1 in 12 innings,
UCLA went on to capture the 2(X)4
NCAA Championship.
UCLA holds a decisive lead in the
overall series, 31-7, but Stanford took
all three regular-season matchups last
season.
Angelica Seledon has helped carry
the Bruins this season, with 11 wins in
16 decisions. Seledon has an eye-pop
ping 0.37 ERA and a whopping 233
strikeouts thus far, but those stats
couldn't help out her team last week in
Oregon, where UCLA dropped all
three games.
Tomorrow and Sunday's 1 p.m.
games against Washington will fea
ture the Huskies' Ashley Charters,
who is hitting .447, and Kristen Riv
iera, who is hitting .397. Riviera has
proved she isn't invincible, however,
as she was stuck in a seven-game hit
less streak earlier this season. Though
conference play has just gotten under
way, Riviera, along with Stanford's
Lappin. has been selected as a finalist
for USA Today's Collegiate Player of
the Year award.
The Washington pitching staff has
been less spectacular this season. De
spite having a respectable 2.17 ERA,
Washington's ace has a 6-4 record. The
Huskies' second starter has been tagged
for seven losses.
The Huskies, who are coming off two
non-conference wins, will head to
Berkeley before playing their two
games here, while the Bruins will trav
el across the bay to cap off their nine
game road trip after tonight's game.
