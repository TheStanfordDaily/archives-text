# Women meet 2004 champs
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
This week. Major League Baseball
players all over the country suited up
for the long season ahead. For these
men, there's still plenty of time to
tweak batting stances and shore up in
consistencies. For the Stanford soft
ball team (26-7,1-2 Pacific-10 Confer
ence), however, the window for mak
ing adjustments is getting smaller.
While more than 20 games remain
on the schedule, the time has arrived
for the No. 9 Cardinal to pick up any
slack from the previous two months.
Stanford's tough Pac-10 schedule,
which continues today with a game
against No. 12 UCLA (26-2, 0-3) at
Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadium,
doesn't allow much room for trying
out new techniques.
The Cardinal, however, seem to
have settled into a groove. Leaders
who remain from last year's Women's
College World Series team —junior
shortstop Lauren Lappin and senior
catcher Leah Nelson — have been
hitting well, with 34 and 35 hits, re
spectively. In addition, junior center
fielder Catalina Morris is fulfilling her
role as the Cardinal's offensive spark
with 34 RBI.

Stanford
veterans aren't
the only ones
contributing to
the postseason
bound squad.
Third baseman
Michelle Smith
has banged out
10 home runs
in her rookie
season and also
has 25 RBI.
And de
spite going 1-2
in Tempe and
Tucson for the
Pac-10 season
openers, all

four hitters did well in the Arizona se
ries.
"We're right there," Lappin said of
where the team stood with highly
ranked rivals last Sunday. "Anyone in
the Pac-10 can beat anybody else. The
conference will prepare us for the
World Series and the postseason."
With the time until the NCAA
Tournament ticking. Stanford does
have a few kinks to work out. The Car
dinal have been mired in a slight hit-

This weekend, freshman Tricia Aggabao and the No. 9 Cardinal
