Bicyclist hits Marguerite
A Stanford student on his bicycle collid
ed with a Marguerite shuttle yesterday on
Serra Street in front of the Main Quad, ac
cording to the California Highway Patrol.
The student, a junior, was taken to Stanford
Hospital with scrapes and bruises and was
released soon after.
The student moved into the path of the
Marguerite, which was heading toward the
Engineering Quad. The accident occurred
around 1 p.m.
A representative from Parking and
Transportation Services said that the acci
dent is still under investigation.
Students fast for relief funds
About 1(X) Stanford students joined their
peers across the country in a fast yesterday
to mark the anniversary of the beginning of
the Rwandan genocide and to raise money
for the victims of the humanitarian crisis in
Darfur, Sudan.
The event, called STANDFast, was not
the first instance of student activism ad
dressing this issue, but it marked the first
time that both the Islamic Society at Stan
ford University, or ISSU, and Hillel have
partnered with Students Taking Action
Now:Darfur, or STAND, a national organi
zation devoted to raising students' aware
ness about the alleged genocide in Sudan.
"It's beautiful to see us working together
in a cause for humanity," said senior Rania
Eltom, one of the fast organizers and a
member of ISSU. She added that she was
born in Sudan and hopes to return once the
country becomes democratic.
Students who participated in the fast
were asked to donate the money they saved
from not buying what event organizers
called "luxuries" like gum, snacks and cof
fee during the day. The organizers collected
the money and will give all of it to the hu
manitarian group Doctor's Without Bor
ders, which currently works in Sudan
refugee camps.
The fast concluded at 5:30 p.m. with a
special dinner featuring the a capella group
Talisman. Stanford Dining contributed to
the event by providing food at a low cost.

The organizers and some of the participants
wore black as a show of solidarity.
Organizers thought that MTVu, the col
lege division of the MTV network, might he
sending a camera crew to cover the event.
As of press time, the channel had not yet re
ceived permission from the University to
set up by Tresidder Union. MTVu has been
working with STAND on the national level
to publicize the event.
Sophomore Elissa Test, the co-founder
of the Stanford STAND chapter, said that
the fast was an "apolitical event."
"This is about the humanitarian crisis,
not any kind of political intervention," Test
said.
Junior Brennan Takayama, who partici
pated in the fast, said he was "pretty hun
gry" by the time he arrived at the dinner.
"Fasting is about personal denial in
order to achieve greater things," he said.
"Every time you get hungry it reminds you
why you are fasting."
