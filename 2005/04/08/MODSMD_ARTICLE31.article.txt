# FACES kicks off week-long conference
## 
### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
Forty university students from across the Unit
ed States and China will assemble on campus next
week to participate in a week-long conference on
U.S.-China relations. The event is intended to
promote grassroots diplomacy between the two
countries and foster ties among their prospective
leaders.
"On Common Ground 2005" will be the third
annual conference organized by the Forum for
American / Chinese Exchange at Stanford, or
FACES. The goal of this student group is to cre
ate opportunities for academic and cultural ex
changes between the countries by bringing to
gether students, academics and politicians from
both nations.
"We aim to change people's lives by involving
them in an unforgettable experience," said senior
Ross Perlin, president of FACES. "Many past del
egates have said FACES did just that — change
their lives — and I know it has changed mine by
exposing me to China in a unique way."
Twenty of the conferees hail from the United
States and the other twenty are from China.

Chosen from a large pool of 550 applicants, they
represent a diversity of American universities,
including Stanford, Harvard, Brown and Duke,
as well as top institutions in China, such as Ts
inghua, Peking and the University of Hong
Kong. By participating in workshops, debates
and simulations, those who attend are set to ex
plore various issues that can impact U.S.-China
relations, from international security to bilater
al trades.
Throughout next week, FACES will host more
than 10 panel discussions and lectures, all of which
are open to members of the Stanford community.
Business executives, policymakers and re
searchers will offer views on China's rapid eco
nomic and social advances.
Elizabeth Economy, director of Asia studies
for the Council on Foreign Relations, will deliver
a public lecture on April 11 about the prospect of
sustainable development in China and the possi
bility for cooperation on environmental protec
tion. In a seminar the next day, scholars from
Berkeley, the Hoover Institution and Washington
D.C.-based Brookings Institutions will examine
recent tension between mainland China and Tai
wan.

James Lilley, the U.S. ambassador to China
from 1989 to 1991, will deliver one of the keynote
speeches of the conference in Cubberley Audito
rium on Thursday, April 14. He will address the
issue of trans-Pacific relations in the 21st century.
Previous conference speakers have included
Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's
national security advisor; William Perry, Presi
dent Bill Clinton's defense secretary; and Robert
Kapp, former president of the U.S.-China Busi
ness Council.
Attendees will be split into cross-cultural
groups to collaborate on projects related to U.S.-
China relations and will meet again in November
at Peking University in Beijing to present their re
sults. Organizers expect that some of the confer
ees will produce traditional academic papers,
make documentaries, set up business and social
ventures or even found FACES groups on their
own campuses.
"We very explicitly are and want to be more
than just a conference," Perlin said. "FACES is
one of the largest student exchanges on campus
and is part of a larger effort to make Stanford the
place to study and understand Asia, China in par
ticular."
