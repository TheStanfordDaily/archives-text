## Jeff Dorman Sucks! Making weight a heavy burden 
### 
In what would seem like every morning, she
would wake up at 5:30, change into black
spandex shorts and throw on a red Stanford
warmup. And even though I dated her for the
better part of my sophomore spring, I barely
noticed her absence from the single bed. I
would always be woken up with a slight kiss on
the cheek, a reminder to close the door when I
left and a wish fora good day.
I hated those morning practices. I hated the
seemingly draconian measures to enforce fit
ness, team chemistry and sober weeknights for
girls subjected to the harshest requirements of
any Stanford sport.
Kerin Lanyi ("Hot Stuff," as you'll recall
from past columns, ex-girlfriend of this young
columnist thanks to a tragic "Sports Center"
incident), made one of the toughest and easiest

decisions of her life about
one year ago. She gave up the
one sport that provided a
place for her on this campus,
the one group that depended
on her leadership, yet also
the one team that made the
non-athletic side of her life
miserable.
She quit the lightweight
crew team and maybe you

should too.
But it wasn't just the morning practices.
It was the weigh-ins. 1 welcome and encour
age letters to the editor in Monday's paper,
most likely comments from the lightweight
team saying that the weigh-in is just one small
part of the sport. But it's not, and they're
wrong.
You see, there is a reason why there are
multiple women's crew teams at Stanford. One
is an openweight team, on which girls of all
shapes and sizes can compete. The other is a
lightweight team, on which one number dic
tates who can race and who can watch. The
number is 130, and you have to weigh less than
that to be in the boat. If you miss that number,
notch a 133 on the pre-race weigh in, every
practice you've had that entire year is a wasted
morning, because you aren't touching an oar.
You've let yourself down, let your coach down
and let your team down.
"Never confident," Lanyi said, explaining
her mentality while stepping on the scale, "If
you're over by a certain amount, you can't
race, and if you can't race, you're not useful to
the team, and then since you're not a
lightweight, you shouldn't even be a member
of the team. The other thing is that [your
weight is] indicative of a weakness that you
don't want other people to see. Because you
are a lightweight athlete ... a gain in weight
shows instability that you don't want your
coaches to see."
To make sure she didn't show weakness,
Lanyi, along with the rest of her teammates,
would resort to unhealthy tricks to flirt with
128 instead of 133.
"I generally didn't drink water [the night
before a weigh-in]," Lanyi said. "I wasn't sup
posed to do that, obviously because you want
to know how much you weigh, but I was always
pretty afraid."
Because water is heavy, many lightweight
athletes dehydrate themselves before the offi
cial weigh-ins the day before a race, sneaking
under the 130-pound cutoff momentarily, but
will frantically rehydrate in the 24 hours before
the actual race. However, the national champi
onships are unique in their testing and take ill
conceived measures to calculate a racer's true
weight.
"[At Nationals], if you win your heat, or if
you are going to advance on to the next round,
then you have to weigh in again," Lanyi ex
plained. "And the problem with that — and
that's the only race where they do that — is
that you're being weighed-in before and after
the race. Because so many people dehydrate to
weigh in at the right weight before a race and
then just rehydrate for the race, when you have
[a weigh-in] before and after, you can't rehy
drate, so [athletes] are racing dehydrated, hun
gry and weak. There were people on our team
who were naturally 143 pounds, racing at 130,
and a day later they'd be back up at 138."
In sports like wrestling, where weigh-ins are
used to determine weight classes, recent rule
changes have discouraged athletes from using
unhealthy methods to cut weight before meets.
Across the nation, high schools have adopted
weight-testing plans that monitor hydration
and body fat while disqualifying wrestlers who
lose more than 1.5 percent of their body weight
in one week. This type of reform is long over
due for lightweight crew.
Brett Johnson, communications director
for USRowing, the organization that legislates
the sport, said that there are no specific rules
that discourage the unhealthy weight-cutting
practices.
"There are no set standards for anyone to
follow," Johnson said. "But we run articles on
our web site and magazine regarding making
weight and how to make weight healthily."
But it wasn't just the weigh-ins, Lanyi said.
There was also the ergometer machines, which
measures the effectiveness and efficiency of an
athlete's rowing over a period of time. The
workouts are long, monotonous and painful,
with only the aesthetics of the Ford Center to
stare at. The seemingly endless repetition took
a toll on Lanyi.
"We had 2 to 3 practices a day," Lanyi said.
"Sometimes [we had] surprise erg practices at
6 a.m. where the coach would have us do a 20-
