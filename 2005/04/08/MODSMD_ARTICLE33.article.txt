# Duo does it all for No. 3 Stanford women
## 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The first thing that jumps out at you about senior twins
Hannah and Kelty Luber is their height. Both listed at 6-
foot-2, they tower over all but a few of their competitors.
But in women's water polo, which features a wide range of
positional roles, it is difficult to imagine players of their size
being able to excel in more than one dimension.
But that's where the Luber twins defy the odds. Com
bining speed, strength and agility, they have developed,
over their four years on the Farm, into two remarkably ver
satile forces capable of handling any opponent or situation.
And beyond their unquestionable contributions in the
pool, the Luber twins provide a leadership presence that is
as great a reason as any for the high hopes held by the No.

as they enter the final stages of their season.
The official position listed beside Kelty and Hannah's
names in the team media guide is "2-meter / defender." It
is a listing that clearly denotes responsibilities in both ends
of the pool, but it doesn't do justice to the array of talents
and abilities these two players possess. Not only do they
have the size and tenacity to compete for inside possessions
near the two-meter mark, but they also demonstrate the
quickness and vision of the pool needed to run the offense
from the perimeter.
Hannah and Kelty's styles of play reflect respective ori
entations — Hannah's toward offense, and Kelty's toward
defense — but that doesn't stop either of them from fac
toring prominently into both the Cardinal's attack and de
fensive schemes.

"They have similar playing styles and complement each
other really well in the water," head coach John Tanner
said. "Hannah plays a fair amount of two-meter offense,
and Kelty plays a fair amount of two-meter defense. But
they both do a lot of driving and have major roles on our
power play. They're also both fast, so they can cover a lot
of mound."
Their versatility is probably due to the fact that their
particular positional roles have evolved slightly in each of
the four seasons they have played for the Cardinal.
"Basically we're just utility players and try to do what
ever the team needs us to do," Hannah said.
And true to their word, the Luber sisters have done just
that — especially this year when the call of duty has ex-

tended far beyond the Avery Aquat
ic Center pool. As the only senior
members of this year's squad, Kelty
and Hannah's charge as captains has
been to strike a very delicate balance
— the balance of pushing their
teammates to new heights while re
maining focused and approachable.
And if the Cardinal squad's cohe
siveness at this stage of the season is
any indicator, then the Lubers have
struck that balance with the greatest
possible precision.
"Their level of play is intimidat
ing to me, but never their attitudes
or personalities," freshman Megan
Nesland said. "They each make it a
point to help the younger players on
the team and to make themselves
available for whatever we need. I've
never been on a team that has
meshed as completely as this one.
and Hannah and Kelty both play a
large role in the maintenance of that
atmosphere."
But of course, the Lubers' com
bined eight years of collegiate expe
rience also translates to a pool lead
ership presence from which the en
tire Cardinal squad benefits. The
Luber twins make it a point to build
trust and build confidence not only
in each other, but in every other
member of the team.
"As a freshman, they have really
helped me become acclimated to
this level of play." freshman driver
Jenna Scalmanini said. "They al
ways help me out by reminding me
about little things to improve on in
the pool."
Considering how well-rounded
their playing and leadership abilities
are as members of the water polo
team, it should come as no surprise

to learn that Hannah and Kelty's
academic and world interests are
equally well-rounded.
"They're both really determined
people and come from a really bal
anced background," Tanner said.
"They have a lot of activities and in
terests and know so much about
movies, music and the arts in addi
tion to being really good athletes,"
Having spent summers they
spent with their aunt in Barcelona,
Spain, the twins gained an early ap
preciation for the diversity of cul
tures, peoples and language. That
appreciation has been with them
ever since.
During their time here at Stan
ford, they have developed their pro
ficiency in Spanish and Portuguese
while gaining substantial introduc
tions to French, Italian and Swahili.
According to Hannah, their musical
preferences range from "60s and 70s
stuff like Jackson Browne or George
Harrison, to dorky 80s like Oingo
Boingo and XTC, to blues like RL
Burnside and John Lee Hooker, to
funky world music from Brazil, parts
of Africa and France, to newer
music like Elliot Smith, Ray LaMon
taigne and Tracy Chapman."
Both agreed that it would be im
possible to name a favorite cinema
piece, song or artist.
Looking ahead to what awaits
them beyond graduation, both Han
nah and Kelty expressed their desire
to simply relax fora bit and enjoy
themselves. Ultimately, both hope
to continue their travels and to pur
sue the variety of life experiences
the world has to offer.
But no matter what challenges
come their way, the Lubers need do
only what they've done in the pool
their last four years as members of
the Cardinal — relax, breathe and
let their passion, skills and desire
take care of everything else.

teammates to new heights while re
maining focused and approachable.
And if the Cardinal squad's cohe
siveness at this stage of the season is
any indicator, then the Lubers have
struck that balance with the greatest
possible precision.
"Their level of play is intimidat
ing to me, but never their attitudes
or personalities," freshman Megan
Nesland said. "They each make it a
point to help the younger players on
the team and to make themselves
available for whatever we need. I've
never been on a team that has
meshed as completely as this one.
and Hannah and Kelty both play a
large role in the maintenance of that
atmosphere."
But of course, the Lubers' com
bined eight years of collegiate expe
rience also translates to a pool lead
ership presence from which the en
tire Cardinal squad benefits. The
Luber twins make it a point to build
trust and build confidence not only
in each other, but in every other
member of the team.
"As a freshman, they have really
helped me become acclimated to
this level of play." freshman driver
Jenna Scalmanini said. "They al
ways help me out by reminding me
about little things to improve on in
the pool."
Considering how well-rounded
their playing and leadership abilities
are as members of the water polo
team, it should come as no surprise

to learn that Hannah and Kelty's
academic and world interests are
equally well-rounded.
"They're both really determined
people and come from a really bal
anced background," Tanner said.
"They have a lot of activities and in
terests and know so much about
movies, music and the arts in addi
tion to being really good athletes,"
Having spent summers they
spent with their aunt in Barcelona,
Spain, the twins gained an early ap
preciation for the diversity of cul
tures, peoples and language. That
appreciation has been with them
ever since.
During their time here at Stan
ford, they have developed their pro
ficiency in Spanish and Portuguese
while gaining substantial introduc
tions to French, Italian and Swahili.
According to Hannah, their musical
preferences range from "60s and 70s
stuff like Jackson Browne or George
Harrison, to dorky 80s like Oingo
Boingo and XTC, to blues like RL
Burnside and John Lee Hooker, to
funky world music from Brazil, parts
of Africa and France, to newer
music like Elliot Smith, Ray LaMon
taigne and Tracy Chapman."
Both agreed that it would be im
possible to name a favorite cinema
piece, song or artist.
Looking ahead to what awaits
them beyond graduation, both Han
nah and Kelty expressed their desire
to simply relax fora bit and enjoy
themselves. Ultimately, both hope
to continue their travels and to pur
sue the variety of life experiences
the world has to offer.
But no matter what challenges
come their way, the Lubers need do
only what they've done in the pool
their last four years as members of
the Cardinal — relax, breathe and
let their passion, skills and desire
take care of everything else.
