# Duo does it all for No. 3 Stanford women

The first thing that jumps out at you about senior twins
Hannah and Kelty Luber is their height. Both listed at 6-
foot-2, they tower over all but a few of their competitors.
But in women's water polo, which features a wide range of
positional roles, it is difficult to imagine players of their size
being able to excel in more than one dimension.
But that's where the Luber twins defy the odds. Com
bining speed, strength and agility, they have developed,
over their four years on the Farm, into two remarkably ver
satile forces capable of handling any opponent or situation.
And beyond their unquestionable contributions in the
pool, the Luber twins provide a leadership presence that is
as great a reason as any for the high hopes held by the No.

as they enter the final stages of their season.
The official position listed beside Kelty and Hannah's
names in the team media guide is "2-meter / defender." It
is a listing that clearly denotes responsibilities in both ends
of the pool, but it doesn't do justice to the array of talents
and abilities these two players possess. Not only do they
have the size and tenacity to compete for inside possessions
near the two-meter mark, but they also demonstrate the
quickness and vision of the pool needed to run the offense
from the perimeter.
Hannah and Kelty's styles of play reflect respective ori
entations — Hannah's toward offense, and Kelty's toward
defense — but that doesn't stop either of them from fac
toring prominently into both the Cardinal's attack and de
fensive schemes.

"They have similar playing styles and complement each
other really well in the water," head coach John Tanner
said. "Hannah plays a fair amount of two-meter offense,
and Kelty plays a fair amount of two-meter defense. But
they both do a lot of driving and have major roles on our
power play. They're also both fast, so they can cover a lot
of mound."
Their versatility is probably due to the fact that their
particular positional roles have evolved slightly in each of
the four seasons they have played for the Cardinal.
"Basically we're just utility players and try to do what
ever the team needs us to do," Hannah said.
And true to their word, the Luber sisters have done just
that — especially this year when the call of duty has ex-
