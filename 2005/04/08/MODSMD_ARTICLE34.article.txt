# Men to play two SoCal rivals
## McKean steps up in first year 
### CARUNG NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Five, four, three, two, one! A crowd counted
down and cheered as Eric McKean hurls a gallon
of milk from the third-story balcony of Sigma Nu
on Tuesday night, the fraternity's first night of
rush. From the energetic and friendly expression
on the sophomore's face, one would never have
guessed that he had to wake up at 6:30 a.m. for the
first of that day's two practices, in addition to at
tending three hours of classes, a field trip and mul
tiple meetings and errands.
The typical overachieving Stanford student is
involved in a number of extracurriculars as well as
classes. McKean does this in addition to starting
for the No. 18 Stanford men's tennis team (11 -7,3-
1 Pacific-10 Conference). Luckily, McKean
doesn't have to go through his day alone; he's got
his best friend, roommate and teammate â€”
sophomore Dave Ryan.
The two met at a tennis tournament in sixth
grade, ended up attending school together and be
came best friends within a year. While both
played on the same high school team, Ryan didn't
play college tennis when he first arrived on the
Farm.
"Dave has a ton of talent," McKean said. "He
just didn't quite pursue the tournaments as much
when he was younger."
While McKean lived in Arroyo and Ryan lived
in Paloma their freshman year, the two remained
close friends and are now roommates in Sigma
Nu. After displaying his tennis abilities earlier this
year, Ryan walked on to the team, and it was like
high school all over again. As teammates and
roommates, Ryan and McKean share much more
than their rooms, including similar schedules and
a liking of Tim McGraw.
"There will be weeks where we wake up, we'll
be [at tennis] from 6 to 9 a.m., we'll have class to
gether from 9 until 11 a.m. and then we'll come
back here and eat lunch," Ryan said. "Then we'll
go straight to practice and get dinner afterward.
And then we'll go back in our room and watch Se
infeld, do work and go to bed."
McKean's sister and brother played tennis at
Harvard, and it looked like he was headed there as

Freshman Eric McKeari has made the transition to college tennis with a little help from Cardinal veterans, and his best friend,
roommate and teammate, Dave Ryan.
well. But following what he called a
sub-par recruiting trip to Boston,
McKean looked to Stanford.
McKean recalled: "I came out
here, met with [former] Coach
Gould and talked for awhile and
then met with some of the guys. I
grew up with KC [Corkery]; he
went to my elementary school. 1 re
ally got along with Sam [Warburg],
and 1 knew Phil [Sheng] from
Southern California. I just really
connected with the guys and had a
good time.
"Harvard's program is great,
but it isn't quite the dynasty of
Stanford," McKean continued.
"Here, every day, the goal is to win
the national championship. Not
many schools have that goal and 1
think it's awesome."
Since arriving at Stanford, McK
ean has looked to his older, more
experienced teammates as men
tors.
"When 1 first came here, I was
blown away by the pace of the ball
and just how quick the guys are,"
McKean said. "But my forehand
got a lot bigger, and I started being
able to compete. Also, [there are]
obviously great guys to train with.
Sam Warburg's the best of the
best."
McKean saw limited playing
time during his frefhman year but
has moved into the starting lineup
for both singles and doubles this
year.
"It's nice to see him have some
of the success he's having because
he's such a hard worker,"
Whitlinger said. "He had a little bit
of a lull in February at the Indoors
where he struggled a little bit, but
the thing about Eric is he just keeps
working and working and working
and it's paying off. I'm very happy
that he's starting to play like I think
he can play."
McKean has shifted between
the fifth and sixth singles position
this season and has played with var
ious partners, including Sheng and
sophomore James Wan. Wan is
McKean's most recent partner and
the pair has a 5-3 record in dual
matches, including an 8-4 win
against Illinois.
"They're a good complement
because Eric loves playing the net

and James is good on the baseline,"
Whitlinger said. "I like what 1 see
with them. Are they going to win
every match? No, but I think
they're competitive in every match
and they're going to win a lot of
matches because of their competi
tive spirit."
The match against Illinois was
significant, not only because Stan
ford was within one match of upset
ting the second-ranked Fighting
lllini, but also because McKean
was the only Stanford player who
could say he won both his singles
and his doubles match. The sopho
more came back from losing the
first set 6-1 to fight three match
points in the second set and beat
Pramod Dabir, a player who he
used to train with. McKean said he
felt that his "game really took a
turning point that day."
"I'll definitely remember that
match; it was one of the biggest
matches in my Stanford career,"
McKean said. "I can remember the
points, the motions, the bad and
the good. It was a great match."
Some coaches and teammates
have observed that McKean has al
ways had the potential to be a great
player and now has the confidence
to take advantage of that potential.
"He's just more relaxed on the
court, because I think sometimes
he would just get a little uptight,"
Whitlinger said. "And when you
get uptight, the balls start going a
little shorter, and you give the
other guy a little more of a look.
Now he just seems to be a little
more assured of himself, and it
seems like he's hitting through the
ball better."
Ryan echoed similar senti
ments.
"Some people have said that
he's been better in practice than in
matches, that he's shown a lot of
great potential in practice," Ryan
said. "[I think] he's just turned up
what he does in practice in his
matches. Sometimes, his shots
haven't been big in the past, but
lately, he's been playing the way he
needs to play. Now he's not afraid
to hit his shots and he's not afraid
to miss. And that's a big part of why
he's playing better."
Look for McKean's energy, his
positive attitude and his killer fore
hand today and tomorrow as Stan
ford takes on No. 13 Southern Cal
ifornia and No. 6 UCLA. There's
no doubt that the crowd will be
cheering for him again.
