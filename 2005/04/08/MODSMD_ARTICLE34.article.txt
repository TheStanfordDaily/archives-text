# Men to play two SoCal rivals
## McKean steps up in first year 
### CARUNG NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Five, four, three, two, one! A crowd counted
down and cheered as Eric McKean hurls a gallon
of milk from the third-story balcony of Sigma Nu
on Tuesday night, the fraternity's first night of
rush. From the energetic and friendly expression
on the sophomore's face, one would never have
guessed that he had to wake up at 6:30 a.m. for the
first of that day's two practices, in addition to at
tending three hours of classes, a field trip and mul
tiple meetings and errands.
The typical overachieving Stanford student is
involved in a number of extracurriculars as well as
classes. McKean does this in addition to starting
for the No. 18 Stanford men's tennis team (11 -7,3-
1 Pacific-10 Conference). Luckily, McKean
doesn't have to go through his day alone; he's got
his best friend, roommate and teammate â€”
sophomore Dave Ryan.
The two met at a tennis tournament in sixth
grade, ended up attending school together and be
came best friends within a year. While both
played on the same high school team, Ryan didn't
play college tennis when he first arrived on the
Farm.
"Dave has a ton of talent," McKean said. "He
just didn't quite pursue the tournaments as much
when he was younger."
While McKean lived in Arroyo and Ryan lived
in Paloma their freshman year, the two remained
close friends and are now roommates in Sigma
Nu. After displaying his tennis abilities earlier this
year, Ryan walked on to the team, and it was like
high school all over again. As teammates and
roommates, Ryan and McKean share much more
than their rooms, including similar schedules and
a liking of Tim McGraw.
"There will be weeks where we wake up, we'll
be [at tennis] from 6 to 9 a.m., we'll have class to
gether from 9 until 11 a.m. and then we'll come
back here and eat lunch," Ryan said. "Then we'll
go straight to practice and get dinner afterward.
And then we'll go back in our room and watch Se
infeld, do work and go to bed."
McKean's sister and brother played tennis at
Harvard, and it looked like he was headed there as
