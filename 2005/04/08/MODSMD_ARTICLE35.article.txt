# Cardinal women take on Trojans
## 
### MIA LEE STAFF WRITER 
As the undefeated top-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team (17-0,
9-0 Pacific-10 Conference) heads
into its toughest weekend of compe
tition all season, you might expect the
players to be in "all work, no play"
mode.
Today, the Cardinal take on No. 4
Southern California (15-1, 7-1) on
Trojan turf. With a single. Cardinal
dealt blow to their record, the
Women of Troy are gunning for re
demption and a shot at the Pac-10
title.
Saturday, Stanford will take on
No. 11 UCLA (12-4,6-2) in a match
that Stanford assistant coach Frank ie
Brennan characterizes as "unpre
dictable, with tough Bruins fans."
While gearing up for one last

home practice, sophomores Anne
Yelsey and Theresa Logar bantered
back and forth. In a game in which
mental fortitude can mean the differ
ence between close victory and ago
nizing defeat, Yelsey and Logar pro
vide a reminder that a light heart and
a morale boost from teammates can
help keep things in healthy perspec
tive.
Of course, it also helps when
you've been winning all year.
Posting a 20-2 record this season.
No. 45 Logar went on a 23-league
match win streak from freshman
year, falling to Oregon's Davina
Mendiburu two weeks ago at No. 4
singles, 6-3,6-3.
"We're just going to cruise past
that, forget about that," Logar said.
With a 17-5 record, Yelsey has
dropped just one league match her
self, and has vet to endure more than

one three-set battle in the Pac-10.
"Its kind of sadistic, but Anne
and I are getting into a competition to
see who can get off the court quick
er," Logar said. "It's really encourag
ing to know that you're not just out
there fighting to win. but fighting to
see who will win first."
In last week's match against Ari
zona. Logar edged Yelsey by a mat
ter of seconds as the two raced to
identical 6-0,6-1 victories.
Logar joked, "Sometimes I'd see
her take a break and think, 'Now's
my chance, I have to start this point,
I m going to pull ahead."'
There's a method to the madness,
with freshman Whitney Deason fill
ing out the Cardinal's solid Nos. 4-6
singles lineup at No. 5.
"We're not going to struggle that
much on the backcourts," Logar said.
"It's nice to know that we're taking

care of business, even when Nos. 1-3
singles might he getting some
tougher matches."
On a team whose members pride
themselves on being closer-knit than
other teams in a very individual
sport, Logar and Yelsey create a cap
tivating spectrum of personalities
and playing styles.
A native of Newport Beach,
Calif., Yelsey radiates a laid-back,
California-girl confidence that has
tempered her competitive spirit since
she started playing at age six.
"1 just remember beating my dad
and my brother, who were both pret
ty good back then," Yelsey said.
Raised a doubles player, Yelsey
thrives at No. 2 doubles with partner
Amber Liu. The No. 29 pair boasts a
13-3 record, and will be looking to
avenge its 8-4 loss to the Trojans' No.

"[Doubles isj about setting up the

While Yelsey focuses extensively
on mixing up her shots before charg
ing the net for the kill, Logar prefers
to dominate the game from the base
line.
"Anne's more of a finesse play
er," Logar said. "I'm more of a
wham, bam, thank-you-ma'am kind
of player. I'm your meat-and-pota
toes player. I just like to hit the [felt]
off the ball."
Logar hails from Rochester Hills,
Mich., and plays a glib counterpart to
Yelsey's quieter side.
"We're exact opposites, but it
works so well that way," Logar said.
One thing the two sophomores
have in common is a shared rever
ence for the National Team Indoor
Championships, which Stanford won
fora record eighth time in February.
"1 really loved Indoors because
it's the first time we all traveled as a
team," Yelsey said. "It's not sup
posed to be a high point for you in the
season, but we just tore through that
tournament and got us off to great
start."
In a determined display of in
creased maturity and better training,
Logar clinched the semifinal round
for the Cardinal by surviving a har
rowing three-set match, 7-5,6-1,6-0,
against Georgia's Caroline Basu.
"I moving a lot better now be
cause I've been taking better care
of myself," Logar said. "I feel like
last year I was winning, but I got
worse as the season went on. Last
year, I couldn't really do third-set
things."
Logar and Yelsey play part of a
flawless singles lineup, which hopes
to mask the Cardinal's uncertainty in
doubles this weekend.
"I think the theme of the Pac-10
all year has been uncertainty," Bren
nan said. "With us, we've lost the
doubles point to these teams, but
come back strong. As for UCLA,
they'll go out and beat someone real
ly good one week, but if a couple of
them lose their focus, we'll finish
strong there, too."

No. 11 UCLA (12-4,6-2) in a match
that Stanford assistant coach Frank ie
Brennan characterizes as "unpre
dictable, with tough Bruins fans."
While gearing up for one last

home practice, sophomores Anne
Yelsey and Theresa Logar bantered
back and forth. In a game in which
mental fortitude can mean the differ
ence between close victory and ago
nizing defeat, Yelsey and Logar pro
vide a reminder that a light heart and
a morale boost from teammates can
help keep things in healthy perspec
tive.
Of course, it also helps when
you've been winning all year.
Posting a 20-2 record this season.
No. 45 Logar went on a 23-league
match win streak from freshman
year, falling to Oregon's Davina
Mendiburu two weeks ago at No. 4
singles, 6-3,6-3.
"We're just going to cruise past
that, forget about that," Logar said.
With a 17-5 record, Yelsey has
dropped just one league match her
self, and has vet to endure more than

one three-set battle in the Pac-10.
"Its kind of sadistic, but Anne
and I are getting into a competition to
see who can get off the court quick
er," Logar said. "It's really encourag
ing to know that you're not just out
there fighting to win. but fighting to
see who will win first."
In last week's match against Ari
zona. Logar edged Yelsey by a mat
ter of seconds as the two raced to
identical 6-0,6-1 victories.
Logar joked, "Sometimes I'd see
her take a break and think, 'Now's
my chance, I have to start this point,
I m going to pull ahead."'
There's a method to the madness,
with freshman Whitney Deason fill
ing out the Cardinal's solid Nos. 4-6
singles lineup at No. 5.
"We're not going to struggle that
much on the backcourts," Logar said.
"It's nice to know that we're taking

care of business, even when Nos. 1-3
singles might he getting some
tougher matches."
On a team whose members pride
themselves on being closer-knit than
other teams in a very individual
sport, Logar and Yelsey create a cap
tivating spectrum of personalities
and playing styles.
A native of Newport Beach,
Calif., Yelsey radiates a laid-back,
California-girl confidence that has
tempered her competitive spirit since
she started playing at age six.
"1 just remember beating my dad
and my brother, who were both pret
ty good back then," Yelsey said.
Raised a doubles player, Yelsey
thrives at No. 2 doubles with partner
Amber Liu. The No. 29 pair boasts a
13-3 record, and will be looking to
avenge its 8-4 loss to the Trojans' No.
37 Anca Anastaciu and Lindsey Nel
son.
"[Doubles isj about setting up the
points well to make your volleys, and
Amber makes my job so easy for
me."
While Yelsey focuses extensively
on mixing up her shots before charg
ing the net for the kill, Logar prefers
to dominate the game from the base
line.
"Anne's more of a finesse play
er," Logar said. "I'm more of a
wham, bam, thank-you-ma'am kind
of player. I'm your meat-and-pota
toes player. I just like to hit the [felt]
off the ball."
Logar hails from Rochester Hills,
Mich., and plays a glib counterpart to
Yelsey's quieter side.
"We're exact opposites, but it
works so well that way," Logar said.
One thing the two sophomores
have in common is a shared rever
ence for the National Team Indoor
Championships, which Stanford won
fora record eighth time in February.
"1 really loved Indoors because
it's the first time we all traveled as a
team," Yelsey said. "It's not sup
posed to be a high point for you in the
season, but we just tore through that
tournament and got us off to great
start."
In a determined display of in
creased maturity and better training,
Logar clinched the semifinal round
for the Cardinal by surviving a har
rowing three-set match, 7-5,6-1,6-0,
against Georgia's Caroline Basu.
"I moving a lot better now be
cause I've been taking better care
of myself," Logar said. "I feel like
last year I was winning, but I got
worse as the season went on. Last
year, I couldn't really do third-set
things."
Logar and Yelsey play part of a
flawless singles lineup, which hopes
to mask the Cardinal's uncertainty in
doubles this weekend.
"I think the theme of the Pac-10
all year has been uncertainty," Bren
nan said. "With us, we've lost the
doubles point to these teams, but
come back strong. As for UCLA,
they'll go out and beat someone real
ly good one week, but if a couple of
them lose their focus, we'll finish
strong there, too."
Match play begins today at 1:30
p.m. at Marks Tennis Stadium. The
action resumes Saturday at noon at
Los Angeles Tennis Center.
