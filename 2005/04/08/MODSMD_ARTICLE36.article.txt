# Fencing finishes 11th
## 
### ALEXIS PETERSON 
The Stanford fencing team thinks it can do bet
ter. That says something, because after the squad
finished its season ranked No. 11 nationally and
with two All-Americans, disappointing is hardly the
first word that comes to mind.
Five of the 28 Cardinal team members com
peted at NCAAs in Houston two weeks ago,
where they faced a field of 144 competitors. Se
nior standouts Iris Zimmerman and Steve Ger
berman each walked away from the four-day
competition with Second Team All American ti
tles. Zimmerman placed fifth, and Gerberman
placed eighth.
Impressed? How would you feel if you knew that
Zimmerman — an Olympian in 2(KM) — had partic
ipated in exactly zero competitions this year before
packing up to take on the field in Texas?
Zimmerman began the year by enjoying a break
from training after trying for the Athens Olympics.
Then in October, she underwent knee surgery. Re
covering from that would be trial enough, without
aiming to compete nationally a mere five months
later. But compete she did. in an event that had con
siderable depth, against many national team
fencers.
Zimmerman had been unsure what to expect at
the tournament, not only because of her surgery but
also because she was contending with some rule
changes. Her preparation for the event, however,
was simple.
"Fencing, cross training, stressing out that 1
would never make it through the quarter," Zim
merman said.
Gerberman, who was a member of the United
States fencing team two years ago and competed all
over the world last year while trying to make the
team that went to Athens, was disappointed by his
personal performance at the championships.
Although Gerberman had his sights set on win
ning, and felt he had the skills to do so. Finals and
Dead Week fell right before NCAAs this year. His
training during that final stretch suffered as a result.
"I trained pretty hard until the week before

NCA As. which was the end of Dead Week and be
ginning of Finals week." Gerberman said. "I found
it pretty hard to do anything outside of schoolwork
during this week."
And while Gerberman's personal goals may not
have been fully realized at the end of the season, he
said the team realized its goal to develop greater
unity and cohesion in what is otherwise a very indi
vidual sport.
"This will help us in the long run when we try to
develop a new and stronger team for the years to
come," Zimmerman said.
Building next year's team is now the challenge
for the fencers. The team will graduate a number of
seniors this year, including senior Jeni Williams.
Described by her teammates as one of the strongest
team leaders. Williams walked on to the team four
years ago and has proven herself to be one of the
team's most dedicated and passionate members.
Next year, the team will look to take most of its
strength from the three underclassmen who com
peted at NCAAs: juniors Jonathan Pearlstein and
Martin Lee, and sophomore Curtis Andrus. Junior
Nina Acuna, who is credited with being a driving
force on the team this year, also looks to be a major
player.
In keeping with the team goal of trying to quali
fy as many people as possible for NCAAs every
year, the team is also excited about the new fresh
men they will be bringing in, and the degree of new
talent next year promises.
As the Cardinal continue to make strides and
push even closer to being in the top 10 nationally,
they remember to keep their successes and disap
pointments in perspective.
"We always get caught up in winning, especially
at a school like Stanford where there are so many
champions and competitive people," Zimmerman
said. "But sometimes it is nice to recognize the heart
and desire of a person who just wanted to be the
best that she could and gave everything she had."
While Zimmerman was speaking specifically of
teammate Williams, it is that sort of attitude and
leadership that will carry the Cardinal through an
other strong season.
