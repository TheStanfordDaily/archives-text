# Saving the best for last
## Nelson leads team in final year 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
Senior Leah Nelson, starting
catcher for the No. 6 Stanford soft
ball team, is the perfect picture of
the talented, intelligent and dedi
cated student-athlete.
A star on the field, running the
Stanford machine from behind the
plate. Nelson aspires to be a leader
long after her softball days are
over. Inspired by her love of sport
and a strong interest in issues of
race and social justice — she is a
comparative studies in race and
ethnicity major — the Oakland,
Calif, native says she wants to make
a positive impact on the world.
Nelson aspires to bring much
needed change to her hometown
and other cities, where education
and health systems are desperately
in need of reform. She draws her in
spiration for this from what she ob
served about the quality of urban
life and a sense of responsibility to
use her talents and passions fora
good cause.
"I started seeing inequality in
the inner city," she said. "And I
wanted to find a way to fix it, basi

cally achievingjustice for those who
can't do it themselves. 1 think I want
to work in a nonprofit eventually."
She combined this drive for
change and her interest in health
and nutrition in an internship last
summer with CANFit, the Califor
nia Adolescent Nutrition and Fit
ness Program.
"[I wasj teaching nutrition in
formation to low-income minority
youth, ages 10 to 14, a pretty specif
ic group," Nelson said.
CANFit is a nonprofit organiza
tion that works to combat the
spread of health problems by run
ning summer sessions, creating
programs for schools to use and ad
vocating for policy change to in
crease the quality of health educa
tion in American schools. It was the
perfect combination for Nelson, al
lowing her to pursue her social
goals while teaching a subject she is
passionate about.
"I have always been interested
in health," she said. "When I was
young 1 wanted to be a doctor or I
wanted to be an EMT. And 1 have
always been an athlete so I am in-
terested in nutrition and things like
that."
Sports have been a part of Nel
son's life from a young age, though
she never set out to be the star she has
become.
"I really just stumbled on athlet
ics," she said. "My dad played foot
ball at San Jose State, and baseball,
football and track in high school, so it
was always an interest of his. I started
out just playing on the playground,
basketball or kickball or something
like that."
When a group of local softball
coaches started the Oakland Bobby
Sox league in 1992, Nelson's mother
suggested she give it a try.
"I had never played before but I
got into it," Nelson said. "Later on I
played soccer also, but I stuck with
softball."
And Stanford is lucky that she did.
She has started in each of the Cardi
nal's 29 games this season and all but
19 in her four years on the Farm, al
though this is her first season behind
the plate. As Stanford's catcher, her
leadership is a key to the team's de
fensive success, since she touches the
ball on nearly every play and controls
the pitching game.
Nelson is also a force in the batter's
box, with the highest batting average
among the team's starters (.409).
Ranked third on the squad in RBI
with 23 and fourth in slugging percent
age at .675. she is well on her way to
the best hitting year of her career.
In a preseason victory over Cal
State-Fullerton, Nelson accounted
for five of the Cardinal's six runs with
a three-run blast early and a two-run
homer soon after.
In last week's win over Arizona
State, Nelson hit an RBI single that
turned out to be the difference in the
Cardinal's first conference win. She
was 4-for-9 in the three-game open
ing weekend of Pacific-10 Confer
ence play.
Though she will be graduating this
year. Nelson said she does not plan to
leave softball completely behind.
"I would consider being a
coach," she said. "I really like
working with kids and I like a lot of
things about sports, like the disci
pline. I like teaching skills and also
just helping out kids. And if they
turn out to want to play softball [in
college and beyond], that would be
great to see."
And if they turn out to be as 1 Con
cerned and dedicated to change as
Nelson, well, that would be great to
see as well.
