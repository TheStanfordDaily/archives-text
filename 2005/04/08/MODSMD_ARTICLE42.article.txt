# Roots declare selves legendary. perform legendarily

### BOB BOREK INTERMISSION BOB 
"Right now we're performing at
about seventy percent capacity," de
clared The Roots emcee, Tariq
"Black Thought" Trotter about forty
minutes into their show last Sunday
night at Santa Clara University.

"With your help, we gonna start
bringing that up, so, by the time we
finish, you will have no doubt that we
are the legendary Roots crew," he
continued.
The band made good on their
promise, concluding their show after
about two hours and then going on to
play a forty minute encore in which
they covered such varied artists as
Burning Spear, Salt and Pepper,
Black Sabbath, N.O.R.E, The White

Stripes, Talib Kweli, Nirvana, The
Eagles and Sir Mix Alot.
The Roots are widely recognized
as one of the finest live groups in the
world of hip hop. Their first album,
"Organix," was produced simply so
that they could have something to sell
at their shows. In a recent article in
"Paste" magazine, they were com-

pared to the Grateful Dead of
rap. The crew spends roughly
250 nights a year on the road,
having a combined ninety
years of touring experience
among all its members.
The crowd at the Leavey
Center pulsed with a nervous
expectant energy as they
waited for The Roots to take
the stage. The opening act.
Forty Watt High, played a
great set. but they stirred up
the largest cheers when they
kept reminding the audience
that The Roots were waiting
backstage. The stage set itself
gave away that this wasn't just
any rap group â€” there were
two drum sets, a bass and lead
guitar, a keyboard and three
mics across the center of the
stage draped in white athletic

towels.
The stage managers ran about
strategically placing bottles of water
and Pepsi's and Red Bull's for the mu
sicians. Then the lights went out and
the crackly spoken word intro to The
Roots new hit, "Star," came through
the speakers as they marched up the
stairs at the back of stage to the sound
of thousands of screaming fans.
Black Thought took the mic as the
rest of the group got comfortable at

their instruments and started in on a
three minute solo rap of "Web," a
song that does without a chorus, just
four minutes of non-stop rhyming and
bliss.
As he finished off, the rest of the
group joined in and they dove back
into "Star." The Roots are one of the
few groups in hip hop that feel totally
at ease with improvisation and simple
jamming. Only in the strictest of
venues, such as at this week's
NAACP awards, do they play a
straightforward version of their songs.
Halfway through "Star," Black
Thought cut in, "We never know how
this shit is gonna end."
Most of the set came from their
most recent album, "The Tipping
Point," which is currently up fora pair
of Grammys. There were a fair share
of flashbacks to the days of "Illadelph
Halflife" and "Things Fall Apart,"
with less of an emphasis on their big
commercial splash, "Phrenology."
"Phrenology" is a point of debate for
many serious fans. Historically, The
Roots have had more critical than
popular success, and their ability to
constantly border on the mainstream
without altogether submitting to it
may be part of their huge appeal.
While "Phrenology" brought The
Roots the widespread success that
had eluded them up to that point,
some thought of it as the band selling
out on their values.
The Roots are a dynamic group,
quite open to adapting to new mem
bers and slight changes in sound.
The core group is made up of Black
Thought, drummer ?uestlove, i
bassist Leonard "Hub" Hubbard
and keyboardist Kamal Grav- The

Roots were also
the launch-pad
off which now
famous beat
boxer Rahzel
was first sent
into orbit. On
The Tipping
Point, the beat
boxing is absent,
but in its stead
are the guitar of
new Root's
member Cap
tain Kirk Dou
glas and the per
cussion of Frank
Knucles.

More than anything, it was clear
that The Roots were having fun while
they were performing on stage. They
were constantly challenging each
other to push their limits, but it came
across as nothing but playful banter.

In the middle of one
of Black Thought's
raps, Kamal

slowed the
beat on the
keyboard

down, at which

point Black Thought immediately
began stretching his words and drawl
ing, rapping in mock slow motion. .
?uestlove and Frank Knuckles had plen
ty of fun dueling from their respective
percussion sets, always building up to
one coordinated rhythmic sound. While
the crowd stands there swaying and
shaking their heads in awe. The Roots
shuffle around on stage joking with each
other and laughing, ?uestlove's wide
smile remains always visible under his
enormous afro as he presides over his
hip hop circus.
