## FRANK MILLERS SIN CITY Black, white and red all over 
### SCOTT HOWARD INTERMISSION PENITENT ANTHONY HA INTERMISSION PRODIGAL SON 
Twenty years ago, superhero films
were huge geek events marked by car
avans of fanhoys camping out in ticket
lines and passionate debates over cast
ing decisions that could realistically
end in (attempts at) fistfights. Today,
most of their mystique has faded
thanks to a movie market oversaturat
ed with mostly subpar comic book
movies designed to cash-in on the pop
ularity of "Spiderman."
Few people remember when Tim
Burton's "Batman" ruled the summer
of 1989 and eventually racked up
around $1.5 billion. It was the highest
profile film of its kind since the first
"Superman" was released over a
decade before, and provided a dark,
thrilling alternative to its competition
("The Little Mermaid," "Look Who's
Talking," "Honey 1 Shrunk The
Kids"). It would never do that type of
business today, partly because we no
longer have mega-blockbusters that
stay at #1 for months and months (the
closest in 2005 so far was "Hitch."
which was #1 for two weeks), but most
ly because it would have trouble differ
entiating itself from crap like "Dare
devil" and"The Punisher" that trans
plant comic book characters into dumb
action movies that make me nostalgic
for the later work of Jean-Claude Van
Damme.
That's why "Sin City" is such a god
send (har har), a tremendously enter
taining film that provides a dark,
thrilling alternative to its competition
("The Pacifier," "Guess Who," the
aforementioned "Hitch"). Though it's
a movie based on a comic book series
about a town full of morally-chal
lenged villains and antiheroes created
by Frank Miller, who co-directs with
Robert Rodriguez and "special guest
director" Quentin Tarantino. it's more
of a hybrid than an adaptation.
It takes archetypes from our nation
al mythology (the one good cop. the
smooth hitman, the corrupt
senator/priest, the muscle-bound thug,
etc.) and a nonstop barrage of fantastic
noir narration and puts them into one
of the most visually compelling envi
ronments I 've ever seen in order to cre

ate a history of American badasses.
Detractors who have complained that
its plot is lacking miss the point; this is
a visceral experience of a movie in
tended to excite and amuse, and it's the
first great film of 2005.
"Sin City" is a triumphant fusion of
styles and mediums, but it's also a fu
sion of the two artists who have brought
it to life. Miller didn't want to work in
Hollywood again because studio exec-

utives butchered his screenplay for
"RoboCop 2," and didn't agree to
the project until Rodriguez, offered

to make the movie with him. Ro
driguez, the prolific DIY guerrilla be
hind the El Mariachi and Spy Kids

trilogies, even resigned from the Di
rector's Guild when they arbitrarily

decided that Miller's name
couldn't be listed as the film's co-

director.

The two make a great team,

with Miller's concep-

tual mastery and
Rodriguez's
technical genius

(he even edits,
scores and designs
the computer ef
fects for his films)
t_: r ii..

meshing perfectly.
The brilliant edit
ing and imagery
recreate the intri-

cacies of comic book
language like no film
before by painstaking-

ly recreating the panels of the original
books. And although it all originally
came out of Miller's mind years ago,
it's Rodriguez's version of "Pulp Fic
tion" in many ways, from the overlap
ping time structure to the comical
graphic violence to the endlessly
quotable dialogue.
And like "Pulp Fiction," "Sin City"
has a flawless ensemble cast without
whom the film would just be a
slideshow of pretty pictures on a
screen. Everyone is in top form here. '
with Clive Owen finally finding a pro
ject worthy of his talents and Bruce
Willis delivering a (hopefully) career
saving performance based around that
confused / angry look he does so well.
Benicio Del Toro hams it up wonderful
ly as one of the sleaziest corrupt cops
this side of Bernard Kerik. delivering
his quirkiest and most enjoyable charac
terization since "The Usual Suspects."
Josh Hartnett, Nick Stahl and Elijah

Wood ditch

their teen
heartthrob

roots by

convincingly

playing a serial killer,
a serial killer rapist and

a serial killer cannibal, re-l

spectively. Devon Aoki,

Powers Boothe, Jaime Kingl

and Rosario Dawson all register!

strongly in smaller roles.
But Mickey Rourke gives the piece
its heart and steals the show in a blis-

tering comeback performance as

Marv, a deformed thug out for
vengeance against the killer of a
beautiful woman who showed

him kindness. I never thought
I'd say this, but thank God for
Mickey Rourke.

"It's a lousy room in a lousy pail
of a lousy town." So begins the first
book in Frank Miller's "Sin City"
series of graphic novels, and the
story that follows is exactly what
you'd expect: dark, mesmerizing
and melodramatic. The men are
tough, the '•dames" are gorgeous
uud the villains are really, really
"Sin City" is also really goddamn
gory. After oil, this u> the writer who
had Batman shove a shard of glass
into a rough dudtj's arm and threat
en to let him Weed to death.
Marv, the (anti)hero of "The
Hard Goodbye," makes Batman
look lik£ my mom. Marv wakes
after one glorious ifand inexplica-a
ble) night of passion with the myste
rious and beautiful Ooldie. only to
fiud ihal she was piurdeyed while he
slept. Swearing vengeance. Marv- <
starts "killing his way to the truth,"
leaving a long trail of mutilated

bodies that eventually
stretches from Basin City's

filthiest al
leyways to
its most pris
tine halls
rof power.
Bas i -
. cally, "The

Hard Good
bye" is noir

squared. The dra
matic, cynical
monologue; the

brooding hero and the ever-present
rain slashing through darkest night
— all the elements are here, taken
about as far as anyone can take
them without becoming completely
absurd. But it's filtered through
Miller's comics-shaped sensibility
-—Marv leaps from building to
building, trenchcoat billowing be
hind him like a cape, and Miller isn't
coy about the violent, messy details
— not by a long shot.
Miller's tendency to embrace
the most cliched noir tropes can be
hard to stomach — sometimes it
seems like every woman in town is a
hooker with a heart of gold. But his
reverence for the material and his
comfort with the melodramatic
style — no self-consciousness here,
thank God — ultimately won me
over. I don't have much patience for
manly men, curvy women and the
revenge narratives they star in. but
Miller's lush black-and-white pan
els cast their spell on me. While I
wasi-eading "The Hard Goodbye,"
T found myself rooting for Marv's
bloody vengeance and anxiously
following every twist in the plot.
Really, above and beyond
Miller's talent, the thing that pulled
me through "The Hard Goodbye"
was Marv, who grabbed my atten
tion from the opening scene. He
may not be anyone's idea of
Humphrey Bogart, but there is
something pure and irresistible
about his burning anger and his
quaint chivalry.
The most remarkable thing
about "The Hard Goodbye" is not
the fact that Miller gets away with
macho nonsense that went

out with the '50s, but
rather the perfect balance
he strikes between Grand
Guignol violence and
smaller, more human mo-

ments (moments. I
should note, which were
often missing from the
film). Yes. the setting is a
fantasy, and yes. the vio
lence and dialogue are
highly stylized, but

Miller's bleak city
and lonely hero

are still stun
ningly real.

over. I don't have much patience for
manly men, curvy women and the
revenge narratives they star in. but
Miller's lush black-and-white pan
els cast their spell on me. While I
wasi-eading "The Hard Goodbye,"
T found myself rooting for Marv's
bloody vengeance and anxiously
following every twist in the plot.
Really, above and beyond
Miller's talent, the thing that pulled
me through "The Hard Goodbye"
was Marv, who grabbed my atten
tion from the opening scene. He
may not be anyone's idea of
Humphrey Bogart, but there is
something pure and irresistible
about his burning anger and his
quaint chivalry.
The most remarkable thing
about "The Hard Goodbye" is not
the fact that Miller gets away with
macho nonsense that went

out with the '50s, but
rather the perfect balance
he strikes between Grand
Guignol violence and
smaller, more human mo-

ments (moments. I
should note, which were
often missing from the
film). Yes. the setting is a
fantasy, and yes. the vio
lence and dialogue are
highly stylized, but

Miller's bleak city
and lonely hero

are still stun
ningly real.



Twenty years ago, superhero films
were huge geek events marked by car
avans of fanhoys camping out in ticket
lines and passionate debates over cast
ing decisions that could realistically
end in (attempts at) fistfights. Today,
most of their mystique has faded
thanks to a movie market oversaturat
ed with mostly subpar comic book
movies designed to cash-in on the pop
ularity of "Spiderman."
Few people remember when Tim
Burton's "Batman" ruled the summer
of 1989 and eventually racked up
around $1.5 billion. It was the highest
profile film of its kind since the first
"Superman" was released over a
decade before, and provided a dark,
thrilling alternative to its competition
("The Little Mermaid," "Look Who's
Talking," "Honey 1 Shrunk The
Kids"). It would never do that type of
business today, partly because we no
longer have mega-blockbusters that
stay at #1 for months and months (the
closest in 2005 so far was "Hitch."
which was #1 for two weeks), but most
ly because it would have trouble differ
entiating itself from crap like "Dare
devil" and"The Punisher" that trans
plant comic book characters into dumb
action movies that make me nostalgic
for the later work of Jean-Claude Van
Damme.
That's why "Sin City" is such a god
send (har har), a tremendously enter
taining film that provides a dark,
thrilling alternative to its competition
("The Pacifier," "Guess Who," the
aforementioned "Hitch"). Though it's
a movie based on a comic book series
about a town full of morally-chal
lenged villains and antiheroes created
by Frank Miller, who co-directs with
Robert Rodriguez and "special guest
director" Quentin Tarantino. it's more
of a hybrid than an adaptation.
It takes archetypes from our nation
al mythology (the one good cop. the
smooth hitman, the corrupt
senator/priest, the muscle-bound thug,
etc.) and a nonstop barrage of fantastic
noir narration and puts them into one
of the most visually compelling envi
ronments I 've ever seen in order to cre

ate a history of American badasses.
Detractors who have complained that
its plot is lacking miss the point; this is
a visceral experience of a movie in
tended to excite and amuse, and it's the
first great film of 2005.
"Sin City" is a triumphant fusion of
styles and mediums, but it's also a fu
sion of the two artists who have brought
it to life. Miller didn't want to work in
Hollywood again because studio exec-

utives butchered his screenplay for
"RoboCop 2," and didn't agree to
the project until Rodriguez, offered

to make the movie with him. Ro
driguez, the prolific DIY guerrilla be
hind the El Mariachi and Spy Kids

trilogies, even resigned from the Di
rector's Guild when they arbitrarily

decided that Miller's name
couldn't be listed as the film's co-

director.

The two make a great team,

with Miller's concep-

tual mastery and
Rodriguez's
technical genius

(he even edits,
scores and designs
the computer ef
fects for his films)

The brilliant edit
ing and imagery
recreate the intri-

cacies of comic book
language like no film
before by painstaking-

ly recreating the panels of the original
books. And although it all originally
came out of Miller's mind years ago,
it's Rodriguez's version of "Pulp Fic
tion" in many ways, from the overlap
ping time structure to the comical
graphic violence to the endlessly
quotable dialogue.
And like "Pulp Fiction," "Sin City"
has a flawless ensemble cast without
whom the film would just be a
slideshow of pretty pictures on a
screen. Everyone is in top form here. '
with Clive Owen finally finding a pro
ject worthy of his talents and Bruce
Willis delivering a (hopefully) career
saving performance based around that
confused / angry look he does so well.
Benicio Del Toro hams it up wonderful

this side of Bernard Kerik. delivering
his quirkiest and most enjoyable charac
terization since "The Usual Suspects."

its heart and steals the show in a blis-
