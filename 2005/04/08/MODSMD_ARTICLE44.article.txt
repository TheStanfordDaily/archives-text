# Catholicism: Currently one-billion strong, this one's here to stay for quite a while
## 
### VICTOR FUSTE INTERMISSION ALTAR BOY 
Taking into account the somber times the
Catholic Church is experiencing with the re
cent death of the much beloved Pope John
Paul 11, I have to keep my sarcastic tenden
cies to a respectful minimum out of defer
ence for this great man.
To be completely honest, Tam was sup
posed to write this article because she i a
much better Catholic than I am. I dp
think that 1 have been to Church on Sundi\
since... well, ever. That's right, a man who
thinks waking up at the crack of dawn to sit in
aii uncomfortable pew is crazier than barrel
full of monkeys, was chosen by Intermission
to be the foremost authority on all things
Catholic. Nuts, I say. Sadly, considering that
I am currently the only Catholic in the office
at the moment, I think thai they have chosen
the right man for the job.
The Church is steeped in a rich
history So rich in fact, that
most of the holy relics are
gold plated thanks to those
wonderful ancient civi
lizations of the Incans - ;

and the Mayans. Forget that whole "vow of
poverty" business the Church could swim in
a giant money bin like Uncle Scrooge on
Duck Tales.
Yet despite the potential moral dilemma
of pillaging cultures, the Roman Catholic
Church has thrived through decades of per
secution. Until the Emperor Constantine,
Christians were still hors d'oeuvres to those
pesky lions. (A little known fact. Christians
will go lose bladder control at the sound of a
lion's roai ) Fast forward a couple centuries,
and nearly one-sixth of the entire world's
population w 'Catholic. That's a pretty good
, turn-around if yIMi .isk me. Which you didn't.
Bui it you did, that's what I would say.
But what does it
mean to be

a Catholic?
Some people say it is about creating a closer
relationship with God and his only son, Jesus
Christ. Personally, I really wish that I had gotten
to know Jesus in the flesh for one reason. I bet
he was killer at parties That whole turning
water into wine business? He could save so
much on catering it's unbelievable. And don't
even get me started on his party tricks. Walking
on water and giving sight to the blind ? Oy vey!
Other people say that being Catholic is
about the guilt. Which is why I can't say any
more about that because I'm afraid about
what my mother would say. (Interestingly
enough, this could be the one aspect of
the Roman Catholic Church that
could re-unite us with our

Jewish brothers, or at least the Jew
ish mothers.)
On a deeper level. I think being
Catholic is about love. And if you
think that I'm going to make some
crack about the priest abuse scandal,
then you've got another tiling com
ing. Those men were beyond stupid
and should be excommunicated.
Now the Church is facing one of
the greatest obstacles in its history.
With the passing of the Pope, the
Church has an opportunity to re-

form some of its frankly archaic prac
tices and traditions. It is a time to cele-

emu v* *" m »»' v "-~
brate the life of a great man, but it is also
time to examine bow the Church can finally

move into the 21st century.
