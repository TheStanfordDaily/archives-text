# Judaism: It's not just for the Jews

### SAM TANZER INTERMISSION FAILED JUDAISM INVESTIGATOR 
You know those reporters who live on the
streets fora week so they can write more era
pathetically aboul the experience ofhomelcss
ness? Well, that's kind of what 1 did for Inter
mission's investigation of religion... except in
stead of becoming homeless, I decided to give
Judaism a try (not to imply any connection be* /
tween Judaism and homelessncss.)
Being a pseudo (read: bad) Jew already, the
conversion was not ail that difficult for me. It
had been a while since I'd given religion aiy
serious thought, but 1 was ready to give Ju
daism my full at tention. I was finally ready ho
get past the stereotypes, to delve deeper than
all the yarmulkes and the Manischewitz
and into the very heart of the Jewish faith.
Sadly, I didn't get all that far. |F
1 decided to start by investigating the opUons
for Jewish life on campus. Fortunately, the e
mail list for my freshman dorm is regularly
fl<K)ded with notifications for upcoming Hillel
events and on-campus speakers that address
issues relevant to the Jewish community at
large.
Unfortunately, I was recently "removed"
from that e-mail list for sending a series of "in
appropriate" messages.
I had never paid much attention to the Hillel
advertisements, but now 1 missed them sorely.
I wanted desperately to become involved in
on-campus Jewish life, but 1 didn't know who
to turn to.

So I started asking aroimd. Unfortunately,
most of the answers I received were unhelpful.
According to one well-meaning sophomore,
"Being Jewish is awesome!" According to an
other, I should "totally rush the Jewish frat" if I
wanted answers. Obviously, I wasn't getting
anywhere.
So what does it mean to be a Jew? No one I
knew could answer this simple question, so I de
cided to let Google answer it for me.
Apparently, there are three branches of Ju
daism: Orthodox, reform/ and conservative.
These rill sounded vaenely familiar to me. En-
into the matter more deeply.
According to Jews are
"Jews who strictly observe the Mosaic Law as
interpreted in the Talmud®
Hmm. That sounded a little confusing, so 1
tried Wikipedia, where 1 discovered that ortho
doxy is characterized by "su ict adherence to Ha
lakha," which is apparently a code of Jewish law.
This was no fun at all. The words were big
and foreign-sounding, and I didn't feel 1 was get
ting any closer to the heart of the matter.
So finally, I got back to basics. It turns out I
had forgotten some of the basic facts of the reli
gion. It also turns out Judaism has quite a history.

Judaism is one ot the
world's first monotheistic faiths, as weli
as one of the oldest religions still practiced
today. The basic tenets of Judaism underlie
Islam and Christianity, and these tenets have

helped shape the Western world.
Suddenly this wasn't so hard to under
stand, so I read on. Apparently, the Jewish
people have made incredible contribu
tions to the arts, literature and science -

especially relative to their small popula
tion. Albert Einstein, Woody Allen,
Adam Sandler — all Jews. An incredi
bly high proportion of standup comics
are Jewish. So is half of Lenny Kravitz.
Hmm. All of a sudden. Judaism was
starting to seem like a pretty solid reli
gion. Famous members, illustrious his
tory, resistance to persecution.

So why all the stereotypes? Why the
bad rap? Honestly, 1 can't answer those

questions. In investigating Judaism, I ran

into countless dead ends, ambiguities and

blank stares. I didn't get many answers, and 1
came away more confused than anything else.

Confused, but a little bit interested.
Every year, Passover reminds the rest of
America that Easter is somewhere near
by and all 1 can think about is how
much 1 dread that crunching sound
of matzah nearby, invading my
sphere of leavened bread. This time
around, I'm kind of looking forward to
that awful, awful wine.
