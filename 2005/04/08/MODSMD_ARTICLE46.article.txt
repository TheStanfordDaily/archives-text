# Church of Scientology: It's kind of like Enron, only it actually makes money

### SOMEONE SPECIAL INTERMISSION "CLEAR 
Human beings have come a long way in

the past oh, three million years or so. But while
man has now advanced to the stage where he

can split an atom and level a city, it's hard to
say he's made much progress in under
standing himself.

But according to the Church of Scien
tology, that is aD about to change. Or

rather, it already has for those who have
opted to come join the Scientologist flock

since the Church was first formally estab
lished as a non-profit organization in 1953. The

very purpose of the "religion" is to help tnan "re
store the balance" between knowledge of the self

;md the physical reality in which he resides.
That sounded like a semi-reasonable starting

point (hey, at least they accept evolu
tion), so I decided to investigate

the Church a bit further

and live a day in

the life of a
Scientol-

ogisl.

Plus, its founder is L. Ron Hubbard, an old
school sci-fi writer. Now I'd never read any of his
books, but 1 figured that his background had to
mean the group's required readings would be more
interesting than your average Biblical passage.
(Not that I even read sci-fi, but 1 definitely thought
"Ender's Game" was pretty coo! back in the day.)
So I did my best to "clear" my mind of any un
favorable preconceived notions and take in every
thing with an open mind.
Ftrst of all, little did I know that by using the
would "dear" 1 was already well on my way to be
coming a true blue Scientologist. Apparently, Hub
bard developed a theory of the mind called "Dia
netics" that complements his religion. A key conijl
ponent of this theory is the notion of a dichotomy
between a person's "reactive" mind and "anal\ifr>
cal" mind. Now, don't ask me how Hubbard just
Even though you might not be "conscious,"
Hubbard would say you're still perceiving things.
Yeah, so that live band playing in the backgn >und?
You're pretty much doomed to flashback to your
red-asphall-style face plant whenever you hear it
for the rest of your life. Those birds cheerfully
chirping in the background on that sunny spring

afternoon? TheyH be reminding you of the sear
ing pain you endured for years to come.

That is, of course, unless you follow Hub
bard's Dianetics course and become a "Clear"
who is no longer plagued by that silly oP reac
tive mind of yours. Unfortunately Hubbard
ain't no Gideon, and you'd have to shell out
some cash to buy his book to find out exactly
how to reach this state. In fact, the entire Sci
entology Web site reads much like an in
formercial, promising you a complete cure for
a few easy payments (but without the loudly
touted 30-day money back guarantee).
That's probably got something to do with why

the Church lost its tax-exempt status in 1967 when
the IRS charged that Hubbard was getting rich in
stead of saving souls. But the Church got that ex
emption status back in 1993, so I'm sure everything
is cool now. Unless you believe Germany or Bel
gium or any of those other Eurotrash whackos.
But that's all water under
the bridge, right?
So while I wasn't able
to leam quite as much

as I would have liked to about other aspects of
Scientology due to that whole "we want your
money" issue, old man Hubbard was a bit more
forthcoming with his theories on educationalpsy
chology. And 1 was excited to find out if I coukJ
improve my study habits all while doing that
whole "being religious'' thing at the same time.
The Scientologists' online treatise "Keys to
Understanding Life" is indeed a fascinating
read on educational technique. Apparently, "Is
our kids learning" is the wrong question to ask.
It's not an issue of proper school funding or ac
countability-based standardized testing: It's
whether or not you give them a tractor.
That's right, a big problem with education is
the "lack of mass" in everyday instruction. It's
just so much easier, Hubbard maintains, to lean)
when you've got "the real thing" in front of you.

don't know what something means, it's hard to un
derstand the concept Hubbard obviously had this
hi mind when he tried to dumb down his Dianetics
theory by using everyday terms like "engram.^
Needless to say, I was pretty excited by this
point I felt Hubbard had hit the nail on the head:
His theory pretty much summed up why I was not
fully getting multivariate non-linear regression.
Butwhen I asked my professor to bring more
"mass" into lecture, he just looked at me like I
was a pervert When I told him the course's "gra
dient" was "too steep," he just told me to take
Stats 60. And when I told him I didn't under
stand the "Abbe-Helmert criterion" and that
misunderstood words were undermining my ed
ucation, he just said that was why I needed to
"come to lecture" and "read the book."
But oh well, maybe Scientology shouldn't be
applied to statistics. After all, I would guess the
Church's claim its educational methods actually
work—based on citing that one school in South
Africa received a 91. percent pass rate while an
other control group received a 27 percent pass
rate —is perhaps an example of selective statistics
usage. And wouldn't that be a big statistics no no?
But, you know, whatever. At least they're "dear."
Anyway, toward the end of my day as a Sci
entologist, I felt more confused than when I had
started. I didn't know any more about myself,
but I did know that this entire endeavor of be
coming self-aware was going to prove uncom
fortably expensive. And besides, the whole
"figuring yourself out," "taking responsibility
lor your actions" and "being a good person"
stuff was starting to sound like a lot of work.
Oh wait. That kind of
sounds like some of those
other religions I know.
