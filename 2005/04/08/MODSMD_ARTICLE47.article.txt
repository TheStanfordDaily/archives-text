## Go bananas with Kong's 'Kongas' 
### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION GORILLA EXPERT 
A disturbing trend is sweeping tlie
video game industry. More and
more, games are either rehashed se
quels with only superficial
makeovers or technological demos
with no depth of content whatsoever.
That's why. regardless of the current
position in the console wars, 1 ap
plaud Nintendo enthusiastically for
continuing to make unique and

more importantly — fun
i

games.
Hnter "Donkey
Kong: Jungle
Beat," Nintendo's

latest

creation: a
solid plat- i

former
controlled J
complete-1

ly with

Nintendo's

bongo con-

troller. But is
Nintendo's!

* m
quest for innovation

realized in this strange came, or is it

just another gaming world gimmick?
The major attraction of "Jungle
Beat" is definitely its unique control
scheme. When using the bongo con
trollers, players can pound quickly on
either the right or the left drum to
move DK (or tap slowly if you want
him to walk). Slapping both of the
drums simultaneously makes the big
ape to jump in the air. and clapping
your hands makes Donkey Kong
reach for any objects or enemies near
him (the bongos have a built-in micro
phone). The clapping function is defi
nitely the most important. Not only do

you have to clap your hands to grab

vines and other critters to propel you

further into the level, clapping is also

the primary method of attacking
the opposition.

Don't want to clap out loud

ind attract unwanted attention

(you closet gamer)? You can also

tap on the sides of the controller to
perform the equivalent function.

When first playing the game, expect
to take a few minutes to get used to

the controls. But tz.ive it some time

after a few beginning levels, the

controls will seem second nature

When you start to get into it, the

bongos actually become quite fun to
play with.

With the exception of the control
scheme, the rest of "DK: Jungle Beat"
is pretty standard. The graphics are of
the usual Nintendo bright and cheery
palette — they look great on the
"cube, but it's nothing you haven't
seen before. The up-beat musical
score earns big points for setting the

cheerful tone and offering an ex-

cellent immersive experience.

Actual gameplay consists

of playing through the
game's 16-plus stages to try

and
acquire

ihe most bananas
possible (medals

are awarded
for collecting

more, allowing
you to unlock
new stages and
other goodies).
Throughout the

levels are opportunities to string to
gether combos of different events

that allow DK to collect more ba
nanas (called beats) than usual. The

fun comes when you start to
realize that in order to earn

the highest scores in each

level, you'll have to create
an incredible number of

(lawless combos in

order to amass
. the most

beats.

Currently,

there are only two games

available thai
' take advantage of the

bongo controllers.!
The first game, "Don-

key Konga," is a de
cent rhythm game

with a good variety/

of songs to drum to.

Jungle Beat is a different, hut just as
good experience with a unique twist tc
a traditional genre. Is it worth the extra
moolah for the bongos to play this

game? Definitely. The simple fact is, re
gardless of what people may

■ say about this game, it really
is fun to play. It's so well put

together that my biggest com

plaint is the length — it ends too
fast!
Sure, it might be a little embar
rassing fora 21-year-old to walk up
to a cash register with a pair of

miniature bongo con
|trollers in hand. But

i give it a few minutes,
I and you'll find yourself

actually enjoying it.
After an hour or so.

[you'll have to pull your

Pretty soon, it's impossible to stop..
which reminds me ... I have some
um, laundry that has to get done
Right. Laundry.
