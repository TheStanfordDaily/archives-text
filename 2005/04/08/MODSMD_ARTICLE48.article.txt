# Red shoes:
## Ballet after birth 
### EMILY HITE INTERMISSION RESIDENT DANCER 
When I visited the San Francisco home
of photographer Lucy Gray and took my
first look at the pictures in her exhibit. "No
More Red Shoes; The Art of Ballet and
Motherhood," 1 was surprised and a little
confused. I was expecting to see the San
Francisco Ballet stars at what 1 thought
would be their finest-graceful beings in pol
ished, classical ballet positions. But instead
of ethereal figures swept up in tulle and
rhinestones, these ballerinas were por
trayed as real people and working mothers
whose profession was dancing.
The series of photographs, which is cur
rently on display at the Institute for Re
search on Women and Gender on campus,
captures SFB principal dancers Tina
Leßlanc, Kristin Long and Katita Waldo at
work and at home with their children. Gray
shows the women rehearsing in the dance
studio, warming up onstage, sharing inti
mate moments with their children, taking
baths and even giving birth. The exhibit is
not about the glamorous ideal of the danc
ing star, even though these extremely suc
cessful women are at the top of their field in
ternationally.

"Everyone thinks it's about dance, but
it's really a labor story," Ms. Gray ex
plained. "It's about the issue of women in
the workplace, and ballerinas epitomize
this more than anything." The ballet pro
fession depends critically on the condition
and health of the dancers' bodies. Gray
comments that historically, female
dancers could either have retired before
having children or not have had them at
all. Firing a dancer for getting married and
having children was legal and considered
acceptable.
Certain brave women have wanted to
have children and continue their careers,
and have struggled to make this situation
work. Lately, SFB artistic director Helgi
Tomasson has helped make this choice pos
sible for his dancers by allowing them to
take a leave of absence. Additionally, all
three dancers featured in the exhibit tried to
time their pregnancies in order to give birth
during the off-season and to spend a mini
mal amount of time away from work. These
dancers' dedicated husbands are essential
to this plan, and play an important role in
childcarc.
The dancers Leßlanc, Long and Waldo
support their families with their income,
and so took a great risk by having children.

Not knowing what would happen to their
bodies after pregnancy, each was fortunate
to return to dancing in not just sufficient, but
actually improved health. Both critics and
audience members agree that motherhood
has enriched all three ballerinas' careers.
"They're better dancers and performers
since they had kids," Gray says."And great
mothers. Because they have something else
to focus on, they have gained greater life
perspective and have more experience to in
form their acting and dancing."
More than anything else, "No More Red
Shoes" celebrates working mothers. Ac
cording to Gray, the exemplary ballerinas
show that "procreating doesn't have to hold
women back in the workforce, and it
doesn't mean their kids will be ruined be
cause they're not home all day."
"It doesn't mean every woman has to go
back into the workforce if she wants to stay
home with her kids," Gray added. "It just
means that it can be done."
Lucy Gray's, "No More Red Shoes," will be
on exhibition April l-June 26 at Serra
House, 556 Salvatierra Walk. There will be
an opening reception tonight from 5-7pm, at
which Ms. Gray will speak about her project
and the ballerinas will answer any questions.


This brings entirely new meaning to ihe term "stage mom."
