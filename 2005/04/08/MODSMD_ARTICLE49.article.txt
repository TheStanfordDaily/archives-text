## Mew kids on the Bloc may trigger 'Alarm' 
### LY CHHENG INTERMISSION MUSIC ALARM 
With the new wave revival in full swing,
everything that once was old and tired is now
new and exciting once again. For better or
worse, bands no one seemed to care about just
a few years ago are now emerging from their
parents' basements and garages to posture
themselves for popular acceptance among the
twenty-something, scarf-wearing hipsters,
whose musical tastes change with their under
wear. South London's Bloc Party — the latest
in a long line of European new wave to wash up
on American shores — offers up a delectable

dish of diversion with their debut album "Silent
Alarm," a breakout LP released on Vice
Records that's equipped with all the bells and
whistles necessary to qualify Bloc Party fora
spot in every nit-picky scen-

ester's scrupulously loaded
iPod.
Each member of this seven
year-old British quartet brings
something worthwhile to the
musical table. If you're not in
stantly seduced by lead singer
Kele Okereke's supple yet su
personic voice — reminiscent

of Hot Hot Heat's Steve
Bays' — then you'll defi-

nitely fall for the flirty guitars which play
off one another like hot tango dancers
hypnotizing the listener.
Okereke and fellow guitarist Russell
1 .issack paint a dreamy technicolor land
scape of ferocious fun with the steel of
their six strings. Bassists Gordon
Moakes provides the extra nudge to get
you off your feet and on the dance floor,
which is where you belong when this
album is playing. However, the coolest
person at this party, hands down, has to
be drummer Matt Tong, whose percus
sive panache pumps this album full of
hot young sweat and raw punk power.

'Silent Alarm'
Bloc Party

The fills are innovative
and syncopated with good
uses of accents on the
snares.
The fourteen

track album opens
strong with "Like
Eating Glass," a
flourish-filled
audio assault on the
eardrums and
heartstrings, which
contains lnterpol
esque guitar mo
ments interwoven
with rapturously

raw vocals. Keeping the
party going is the next track
"Helicopter," propelled by

volatile guitar work and searing choruses. The
debut single "Banquet" opens with a toe-tap
ping, head-bobbing riff. a-la-Franz Ferdinand,
which commands you to get on the dance floor
and dance in that weird hipster way that you
dance. Tracks like these introduce Bloc Party as
a band riding a pulsating current of visceral musi
cal electricity headed straight for your synapses.
However, these songs are contrasted on the
album by softer, more cerebral ballads which
show a different side of Bloc Part) - . "This Modern
lx>ve", "So Here We Are" and "Blue Light"

ache with the tense, earnest voices of twenty
somethings trying to figure out everything from
love to politics. These same songs, however, show
too clearly lead singer Okereke's ambitions of
being a balladeer and shortcomings as a vocalist.
You can sometimes hear his voice struggling to
please you. While not all of the tracks on this
album achieve the tight and polished level of the
earlier tracks — the middle drags and some of
the ballads feel forced and weak — and often
times the album dips into being overtly political,
there is still a lot at this party worth checking out.


Twenty points if you can identify the obscure band t-shirt in the rear


Kids really love Kix, but Bloc Party would really love to get some haircuts.
