# REEL BIG FISH, REEL BIG LETDOWN: ’WE'RE NOT HAPPY'
## 
### CHRIS HOLT INTERMISSION SKA ENTHUSIAST 
Reel Big Fish's fifth album might
make the hand happy, but it's going to
have trouble pleasing anybody else.
When seven of the songs have self
referential lyrics about the band's rise
and fall from fame, it's hard to take
this album out of context. A brief his
tory lesson: the genre of "ska" en
joyed its fifteetf Jninutes of fame in
IW6 and 1997, a year-long stint that
elevated the likes of the Mighty
Mighty Bosstones, Save Ferris, and
Reel Big Fish to superstar status. And
then pop-punk happened and they
dropped off the charts.
But Reel Big Fish has never for
gotten the feel of the limelight. The
band has been clinging to its previous
status as superstars like a Goltum
character in some cave — flrvesting
hate, bitterness and sarcasm'fot 1 near
ly ten years.
That isn't to say hasn't
evolved-?-it Radio
Off employed fast guitars',' louphorns,
and a sarcastic Vit that feflKijuld rival.
"Why Do was a
more consistem^iek 1 112 sKaalbum that
juxtaposed upbeat singing and horns

with bitter lyrics. By "Cheer Up," the
band was more poppy and less fresh,
but more eclectic.
In "We're Not Happy Until You're
Not Happy," the energetic punk beats
are gone and the horn section that

made the band famous often sounds
boring and flat compared to previous
endeavors. Aaron Barrett, the band's
lead singer, has a fairly successful side
project with The Forces of Evil. This
project seems to have sucked any
humor (and much of the songwriting

ability) from the band that made him
famous. When you realize that The
Forces of Evil are still funny, energetic
and horn-intensive, you have to recog
nize that they are playing Reel Big
Fish's music better than Reel Big Fish.

One The Forces of
Evil song asks, "Remember
bands that made you dance,
and laugh so hard you nearly
wet your pants?" Although
Barrett wrote that song, her
doesn't employ those themes
in "We're Not Happy."
Rude boys will have a hard
time dancing to this one, and
the humor that is so refresh
ing in Reel/Big Fish's previ
ous aibuttts has
placed "by an Vicerbift: rerttfv
tive series tyf rters'Vty
life's a joke and the jpkd's on
me" and "thkvdoh\ love
you, they one
song."

Barrett seems to view every lracjie
writes in a song as significant and
groundbreaking, as he often repeats it
as the chorus — at least a dozen
times. The self-referential half-mock
ing of their decline in popularity has
been stretched through three albums

and the joke has worn thin. This
album seems to be the point where
the anger overshadows the special
something that made them popular to
begin with. s
There are little moments that will
remind the listener of the old RBF,
but they cannot salvage the overall
album. "The Fire" and "Say Good
Bye" combine solid horn lines with
some catchy, if uninspired lyrics.
Again with the self-referential theme.

one of the better tracks is
called "Turn the Radio

Off' which shares its
namesake with the '96

"Take on Me," you will be
disappointed. Their cover of the reg

by Tracy Chapman, is marred by poor
production quality. Morrissey's "We

Successful" fits their angry-bitter

theme well, and while not particularly
inspired, Barrrett s voice melds well
with Morrissey's lyrics. "Story of My
Life" is a reggae-style cover of Social
Distortion — the original is better.
RBF is arguably at its best when it
makes fun of drinking, relationships
and social issues. "Say Good Bye" and
"AWESOME" have energy, but the
horn parts are almost as forgettable as
the lyrics (count how many times Bar
rett says "awesome" in the song).

"Drinkin"' is entertaining
it stale, and it echoes
"Beer" (from their %
I release) — which was
' much better.
That is part of why
this album is disap
pointing— RBF has
the talent to make great
music and has in the past.
The fact that their past

fame is continually is ref
erenced in "We're Not Happy" only
makes the current effort sadder.
Marred by poor lyrics, unoriginal
horns and an overall bitter mood, this
album falls well short of their previous
efforts. They seem to mock what they
used to have but at the same time make
poor attempts to regain that magic.
