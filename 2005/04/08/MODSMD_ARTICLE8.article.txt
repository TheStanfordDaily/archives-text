## Graduate schools rank high Cal bests Stanford in fuzzy departments; Stanford dominates on techie front 
### COURTNEY WEAVER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford University fared well in U.S. News
& World Report's 2006 edition of the annual
"America's Best Graduate Schools" published
April 4. The University's business, education,
engineering and medical schools all ranked with
in the top 10. Moreover, the University's biolog
ical sciences, economics, political science and
psychology departments all placed in the top
three nationwide.
The magazine surveyed 1,3(X) academic pro
grams and 9,600 faculty members and profession
als. The different types of graduate schools were
evaluated according to different rating systems.
The rankings for the business, education, en
gineering, law and medical schools are based on

two types of data — "expert opinion about pro
gram quality and statistical indicators that mea
sure the quality of a school's faculty, research
and students."
University President John Hennessy, howev
er, said he was skeptical about the merits and ac
curacy of the rating system.
"The way in which the ratings are done probably
distorts some things due to their metrics and scales,"
Hennessy said in an interview with The Daily.
Philip Pizzo, dean of the School of Medicine,
has always felt similarly dissatisfied with the ac
curacy of the U.S. News rankings.
"The methodology employed by popular
magazines, including U.S. News, is highly varie
gated and imperfect," he said in an interview
with The Daily. "Indeed, the methods employed
to rank schools is frequently based on 'reputa
tion scores' which can, of course, be subjective."
In particular, Pizzo found flaw in the maga
zine's measure for funding received from the Na
tional Institute of Health, or NIH. After making
multiple visits to U.S. News and World Report
over the course of three years, he convinced the
publication to include funding per medical
school faculty member, rather than the overall

NIH funding for the school.
"Even though the editors [now publish) the
data showing funding per faculty member, the
current methodology is still unduly biased by
size of faculty rather than the quality of the fac
ulty," he said.
This year's edition of the magazine also of
fered additional insight into the rivalry between
Stanford and UC Berkeley. While Stanford's
business, education, engineering, and law
schools came out on top. Cat's schools in the hu
manities performed better.
Rankings aside, Hennessy suggested that
both schools offer excellent programs.
"Cal would give us a run for the money in his
tory, English, anthropology, economics and po
litical science, but not psyche" he said.
Regardless, he conceded that both schools
were closely matched in their academics.
But some agree that Berkeley's high rankings in
the humanities and Stanford's dominance in the
technical sciences seems to have an element of
truth.
Marcus Folch, a fifth-year doctoral candidate
in classics said, "I have often heard
humanities grad students lament
that Stanford — which some refer
to as StanTech — cares more
about the sciences, and that the
University does not do as much to
cultivate a vibrant intellectual cul
ture in the humanities as it does for
the science and business-related
fields."
Folch said that Berkeley seems
to have a much different approach
to developing their humanities de
partments.
"UC Berkeley has made a sus
tained, concerted effort to develop
a superior school of humanities,"
he said. "Culturally and intellectu
ally, at Berkeley ideas matter in a
way that they do not at most other
places."
However, there may be less of a
gap between Stanford and Berke
ley than a cursory glance at the
rankings might suggest. Berkeley
outranked Stanford in English and
history by a 0.1 difference on a 5.0

scale. Some believe that the dis
tinction is even smaller than that.
"You can't really see how close
things are and that's very unfortu
nate," Hennessy said. "You give
this impression of an absolute
ranking which is just silly."
Business and master's student
Roger Stanley agreed.
"I look at the rankings of the
schools at the very top in the way I
look at medalists in the Olympics,"
he said. "Is the gold medalist in an
event 'better' than the silver or
bronze medalists when they were
separated by only thousandths of a
second?"
Stanley also pointed out that the
ratings do not take into account the
needs of individual students.
"Each person needs to look at
the methodology of the rankings to
make sure he or she agrees with the
weighting of criteria," Staneley
said. "If he or she agrees complete
ly with everything, perhaps the
ranking is then accurate, but only
for him or her. ?We just have to
keep in mind that while the data is
indisputably quantitative, the
method used to produce the rank
ing is most certainly subjective,"
Stanley said.
