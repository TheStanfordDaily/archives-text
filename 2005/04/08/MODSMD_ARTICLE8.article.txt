## Graduate schools rank high Cal bests Stanford in fuzzy departments; Stanford dominates on techie front 
### COURTNEY WEAVER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford University fared well in U.S. News
& World Report's 2006 edition of the annual
"America's Best Graduate Schools" published
April 4. The University's business, education,
engineering and medical schools all ranked with
in the top 10. Moreover, the University's biolog
ical sciences, economics, political science and
psychology departments all placed in the top
three nationwide.
The magazine surveyed 1,3(X) academic pro
grams and 9,600 faculty members and profession
als. The different types of graduate schools were
evaluated according to different rating systems.
The rankings for the business, education, en
gineering, law and medical schools are based on

two types of data â€” "expert opinion about pro
gram quality and statistical indicators that mea
sure the quality of a school's faculty, research
and students."
University President John Hennessy, howev
er, said he was skeptical about the merits and ac
curacy of the rating system.
"The way in which the ratings are done probably
distorts some things due to their metrics and scales,"
Hennessy said in an interview with The Daily.
Philip Pizzo, dean of the School of Medicine,
has always felt similarly dissatisfied with the ac
curacy of the U.S. News rankings.
"The methodology employed by popular
magazines, including U.S. News, is highly varie
gated and imperfect," he said in an interview
with The Daily. "Indeed, the methods employed
to rank schools is frequently based on 'reputa
tion scores' which can, of course, be subjective."
In particular, Pizzo found flaw in the maga
zine's measure for funding received from the Na
tional Institute of Health, or NIH. After making
multiple visits to U.S. News and World Report
over the course of three years, he convinced the
publication to include funding per medical
school faculty member, rather than the overall

NIH funding for the school.
"Even though the editors [now publish) the
data showing funding per faculty member, the
current methodology is still unduly biased by
size of faculty rather than the quality of the fac
ulty," he said.
This year's edition of the magazine also of
fered additional insight into the rivalry between
Stanford and UC Berkeley. While Stanford's
business, education, engineering, and law
schools came out on top. Cat's schools in the hu
manities performed better.
Rankings aside, Hennessy suggested that
both schools offer excellent programs.
"Cal would give us a run for the money in his
tory, English, anthropology, economics and po
litical science, but not psyche" he said.
Regardless, he conceded that both schools
were closely matched in their academics.
But some agree that Berkeley's high rankings in
the humanities and Stanford's dominance in the
technical sciences seems to have an element of
truth.
