# Univ. pledges funds for annex to Black House
## 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
The meeting room in the Black Com
munity Services Center is a cozy place.
There's an old TV in one corner and a
magazine stand, stocked with some issues
of Ebony, in another. A wall full of photos
of famous African American alumni over
looks a small table circled by several
chairs and a couch. The room, however,
might be a little too cozy. While there are
682 black students at Stanford, the cen
ter's meeting room comfortably fits only
about 15.
But those at the Clack Community
Center, BCSC, hope this will soon be
changed by a planned $1.3 million expan
sion project that was recently pushed for
ward with a pledge from University Presi
dent John Hennessy and University
Provost John Etchemendy two weeks ago
to match fundraising efforts up to
$650,000.
BCSC leaders said they expect to raise
the necessary funds before the end of the
year and that actual construction is ex
pected to be completed by mid-2006. So
far, nearly $400,000 in cash and pledges
has been raised for the construction of a
new 2,500-square-foot building and a
deck that will connect the existing struc
ture to the new one.
The BSCS, referred to as "the Black
House," currently operates in a 1,400-
square-foot building at the corner of
Santa Teresa Street and Lomita Drive.
Currently, all gatherings of more than 20
people have to be held in other locations,
such as El Centro Chicano or Ujamaa, the
African-American theme dorm in Lagu
nita. The expansion would effectively
triple the area of the existing center and
create new meeting space that would ac
commodate 115 students.
"We will also have the deck, which can
hold performances," said BSCS student
coordinator Aneto Okonkwo, a junior.
"Overcrowding will be alleviated and
we'll finally be able to centralize instead
of having our meetings elsewhere."
According to Assistant Dean of Stu
dents Jan Barker-Alexander, the BCSC
director and primary force behind the
fundraising efforts, discussion of expand
ing the center has been a "30-year conver
sation" among student groups and mem
bers of the Stanford community.
"We didn't just recently start talking it,
the dialogue has been going on for many,
many years," said co-terminal student
Donielle Newell, who serves as co-chair
for the Black Student Union, or BSU.
"We had alums come back and say 'Wow,
we're still on the same small space yet the
community has grown so much.' Those
were comments coming from alums who
attended Stanford when there were like
30 black students."
The expansion project was set in
motion two years ago by members of
the BSU,
"During the 2001-2002 school
year, the BSU held a forum on the
topic of the BCSC," Newell said.
"That was the catalyst. [Former BSU
Co-Chair] Michael Brown took it on
and began to take steps. We tried to
formalize the proposal and get the
petition signed by students."
Since the beginning of 2005, a com
mittee of alumni has run an intensive
fundraising campaign in conjunction
with the BCSC, holding events in
major cities and contacting alumni.
"We're in the stages of mailing and
reaching out for donors," Okonkwo
said. "It's very impressive that all the
money raised so far has been done
without any systematic mailing and
only done through talking to key peo
ple and spreading the word."
Thom Massey, assistant dean of
students at the Graduate Life Office,
said that fundraising events have al
ready been held this year in Dallas
and Los Angeles, and more recep
tions are scheduled to take place be
fore the summer in Chicago, New
York, Washington and Atlanta.
"We're hoping to have all the
money in by the beginning of sum
mer," Massey said. "We'll break
ground and commence construction
as soon as the money is raised."
Though the pledge from Hen
nessy and Etchemendy provided a
significant boost in the fundraising

campaign. Okonkwo said that the
BCSC will not scale-back efforts to
raise the full estimated amount.
"The expectation is that the
BCSC would raise the full amount
but the University wanted to be in
partnership and show good faith,"
Massey said.
But showing good faith can ex
tend beyond simply contributing the
dollars. Massey said that non-
African Americans, faculty mem
bers and "everyone who is an ally of

that space" is helping out with the
project in their own way.
Okonkwo also encouraged stu
dents to get involved.
"It is now a question of manpow
er," Okonkwo said. "We're going to
need a lot of help with stuffing en
velopes, drafting proposals. The av
erage student can help by just being
aware and talking to people who
have money, because obviously this
will affect not just the black commu
nity but the entire campus."

The fundraising success so far,
many say, is simply a reflection of
the positive influence the BCSC has
had on African-American Stanford
students past and present.
"Some alums who are giving
back now have never given to
Stanford before," Newell said
about the recent donations. "Now
they have a project that they can
connect to â€” something that was
instrumental to their experience
here at Stanford."

The Black Community Services Center is too small to fit the black student body's needs.
