# Univ. pledges funds for annex to Black House
## 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
The meeting room in the Black Com
munity Services Center is a cozy place.
There's an old TV in one corner and a
magazine stand, stocked with some issues
of Ebony, in another. A wall full of photos
of famous African American alumni over
looks a small table circled by several
chairs and a couch. The room, however,
might be a little too cozy. While there are
682 black students at Stanford, the cen
ter's meeting room comfortably fits only
about 15.
But those at the Clack Community
Center, BCSC, hope this will soon be
changed by a planned $1.3 million expan
sion project that was recently pushed for
ward with a pledge from University Presi
dent John Hennessy and University
Provost John Etchemendy two weeks ago
to match fundraising efforts up to
$650,000.
BCSC leaders said they expect to raise
the necessary funds before the end of the
year and that actual construction is ex
pected to be completed by mid-2006. So
far, nearly $400,000 in cash and pledges
has been raised for the construction of a
new 2,500-square-foot building and a
deck that will connect the existing struc
ture to the new one.
The BSCS, referred to as "the Black
House," currently operates in a 1,400-
square-foot building at the corner of
Santa Teresa Street and Lomita Drive.
Currently, all gatherings of more than 20
people have to be held in other locations,
such as El Centro Chicano or Ujamaa, the
African-American theme dorm in Lagu
nita. The expansion would effectively
triple the area of the existing center and
create new meeting space that would ac
commodate 115 students.
"We will also have the deck, which can
hold performances," said BSCS student
coordinator Aneto Okonkwo, a junior.
"Overcrowding will be alleviated and
we'll finally be able to centralize instead
of having our meetings elsewhere."
According to Assistant Dean of Stu
dents Jan Barker-Alexander, the BCSC
director and primary force behind the
fundraising efforts, discussion of expand
ing the center has been a "30-year conver
sation" among student groups and mem
bers of the Stanford community.
"We didn't just recently start talking it,
the dialogue has been going on for many,
many years," said co-terminal student
Donielle Newell, who serves as co-chair
for the Black Student Union, or BSU.
"We had alums come back and say 'Wow,
we're still on the same small space yet the
community has grown so much.' Those
were comments coming from alums who
attended Stanford when there were like
30 black students."
