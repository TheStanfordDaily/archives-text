# Univ. takes over EPA charter school
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This summer, Stanford plans to
assume full operation of East Palo
Alto High School, a charter school
that the University has run jointly
with Aspire Public Schools since it
opened in 2(X)1. Stanford plans to
add grades kindergarten through
eighth to the school, which it envi
sions as both a boon to the East

Palo Alto community and a valu
able teaching site for students and
faculty at Stanford's School of Edu
cation.
The University recently
launched a non-profit subsidiary,
the Stanford School Corporation,
to run the school, which will likely
be re-named the Stanford New
School. It will continue to serve
East Palo Alto and east Menlo Park,
where 90 percent of students are clas
sified as low-income. The high
school's population is 67 percent Lati
no, 20 percent African American and
13 percent Asian/Pacific Islander.
Ravenswood school district grant
ed the corporation a charter fora K-12
school on March 25, and Stanford
now awaits approval from the state
government. The target date for
opening the elementary and middle
schools is Fall 2006 — they will start
by enrolling students in kindergarten,
first grade and sixth grade, and add
new grades each year as the students
move up.
Stanford and Aspire — a non
profit organization that builds and
runs charter schools in cities across
California — started East Palo Alto
High School in the same way, and in
June the school will graduate its first
senior class.
A local alternative
Deborah Stipek, dean of the
School of Education, who helms the
Stanford School Corporation, said the
charter school provides a unique ser
vice to East Palo Alto students as the
only public high school in the
Ravenswood school district.
"It's their own local school, rather
than being bussed," Stipek said. "It's a
very small school. It's very personal
ized."
In 1976, Ravenswood High School
was shut down in accordance with a
court desegregation order, and since
then East Palo Alto students have
been bussed not only to Menlo-
Atherton High School but to places as

far away as Belmont and Woodside.
Relatively few East Palo Alto stu
dents succeed in these large, distant
schools full of local students who tend
to be better-prepared for the rigors of
a college preparatory environment,
said Ravenswood School Board Pres
ident Marcelino Lopez. He added
that students from East Palo Alto are
often under-served, but that he
doesn't blame the other districts.
"It has been the case fora long
time that our kids are not prepared to
go to high school," Lopez said in an in
terview with The Daily. "I don't like
for them to be marginalized — 'Oh.
they're kids from Ravenswood, let's
put them in a separate room' — but to
put a kid who's prepared and a kid
who doesn't know what he's talking
about [together in a classroom], it's
hard."
Stipek said the charter school
serves East Palo Alto students better.
"The dropout rate of kids from
EPA who are bussed out of EPA to
high school is over 60 percent," Stipek
said. In contrast, she added. East Palo
Alto High School's graduation rate is
90 percent, and many students from
its first graduating class plan to attend
four-year colleges.
Lopez, whose youngest son at
tends the charter school, agreed that it
has great advantages. For one thing,
he said, he can pick his son up after
school, rather than relying on his son
to take a long bus ride home and stay
out of trouble on the way.
Perhaps even more importantly,
the school provides individual atten
tion and an expectation of success —
whereas at other schools, "our kids
are getting frustrated and tending to
drop out," Lopez said.
'Hie charter school may not be for
everyone, Stipek said. Because of its
small size, athletic opportunities and
class offerings are limited. Still, both

Stipek and Lopez said there is plenty
of demand for the school's services.
Not everyone can attend
Not all families have the option of
sending their children to the charter
school because eligibility is deter
mined by lottery.
Stipek acknowledged that it would
be nice to be able to serve more stu
dents but stressed that the school's
small size is crucial to its success.
During the 2(X)3-2(X)4 academic year.
East Palo Alto High School had 240 stu
dents. If all goes as planned, the Stanford
New School will eventually enroll about
75() students in grades K-12.
That's part of why Aspire and
Stanford parted ways, said Laura
Noss, spokesperson for Aspire.
"Over the years both organiza
tions realized we share a common
mission, which is to provide more
choices for families for kids to receive
a quality education," Noss said. "In
order to do that, what we need to do is
build more schools. So we agreed to
split," allowing Stanford to expand its
school to K-12 while Aspire works to
build a new public high school.
Aspire's school would be the first
public high school within the borders
of East Palo Alto since Ravenswood
High School's closure in 1976. East
Palo Alto High School is located in
east Menlo Park, at 475 Pope Street,
off of Willow Road.
Benefits for Stanford
Noss said she expects Stanford's
school to continue to be successful as
it expands, even if it encounters initial
setbacks without Aspire's infrastruc
ture and expertise.
"I think that Stanford has as much
potential as anybody to operate a suc
cessful school," she said. "They draw
on some of the best research."

Stipek said that the School of Edu
cation will benefit from the challenge
of running a school on its own.
"1 think, one, you learn humility
very quickly when you try to prac
tice what you preach, and, two, you
learn much more deeply what the is
sues are than if you're studying
other people's schools," she said.
"We can serve as a better resource
to the Bay Area education commu
nity if we're trying to do what
they're doing and we have a model
school that they can visit."
The school will be staffed by ac
credited teachers, but it will also be a
key site for students in Stanford's
teaching certification program to do
student teaching. Stipek said the
school will also partner with the Haas
Center for Public Service to provide
community service opportunities for
undergraduates. And, she said, it
could be a perfect site for research by
education professors.
In a press release, Education
Prof. Linda Darling-Hammond said
the school also provides "an oppor
tunity to prepare a pipeline of certi
fied teachers for Ravenswood
schools find to work collaboratively
with teachers and administrators to
improve student learning through
out the district."
Stipek said, "If you look at the
EPAHS faculty, you'll probably no
tice that a very large proportion of the
teachers there are Stanford graduates.
That's not completely coincidental,
though it's not a requirement."
If the K-12 school works as well as
those involved hope, it could serve as
a model for other universities looking
for ways to improve their teacher
training programs.
Stipek said Stanford's proposal is
"fairly unusual, although there are a
few other universities now that are
starting charter schools."
