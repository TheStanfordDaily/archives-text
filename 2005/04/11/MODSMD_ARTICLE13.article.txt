On April 11,1V66, The Daily cov
ered a story about the fate of the
Sigma Chi fraternity of Stanford Uni
versity after encountering problems
with possible racial discrimination,
lielow is an excerpt:
"Sometime this week Stanford's
Alpha Omega chapter of Sigma Chi
will find out if it will he readmitted to
the national or permanently ex
pelled. Various sources indicated
the chapter will probably be allowed
to return, but no official word has yet
been released.
"The chapter was put on a year's
suspension last April for 'disregard
of and active opposition to ritual,'
but the national's announcement
came the same week a Negro was
pledged.
"Since the suspension, which was
upheld by a national convention in

June by a 3-1 margin vote, there has
come a wave of protest throughout
the country against alleged de facto
discrimination.
"Sigma Chi has no stated discrim
ination policy, but a 'social accept
ability' clause requires that no chap
ter propose anyone for membership
'who for any reason is likely to be
considered personally unacceptable
by any chapter or any member any
where.'
"In January the membership
committee refused to approve initia
tion of a Lafayette College. Pennsyl
vania. pledge of Korean ancestry.
"Since its suspension. Alpha
Omega has been forbidden to use
the Sigma Chi name when answering
the phone or on any correspon
dence. The question remains
whether ritual or race were the pri-

Mary factors for suspension."
On April 11, 1958, The Daily ran
an article about the stance of Pakistan
Vice-Consu, Abdul Sattar, on the
issue of the Indian government's poli
cies in Kashmir. Below is an excerpt:
"it is absolutely clear ... that all
the Indian government wants to do is
get out of its obligation of giving
human rights to the people of Kash
mir,' said Pakistan Vice-Consul
Abdul Sattar in a speech yesterday
which refuted the Indian stand on
the Kashmir problem.
"Sattar placed the main emphasis
of proof for the above statement on
the divided religion of the country.
When Britain granted the states of
India their freedom, they decided that
the Moslem states which were being
subjected to Hindu rulers would go to
Pakistan while the Hindu states
would remain as India. India took
over two of the states which did not
comply, and Kashmir is the third.
"Although 80 percent of the
Kashmir population was Moslem,
and according to Britain's plan
should have acceded to Pakistan, the
ruler was Hindu and 'started con
spiring with India.'
"The question came before the
United Nations Security Council in
1949, which decided that a plebiscite
be taken."
