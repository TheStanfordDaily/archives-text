# Water in the milk bottle
## My spiral ascent to fame 
### 
Growing up in a Chinglish-speaking
environment — where we mingled
English and Chinese freely — 1
learned at an early age thai y° u can't
always trust those near and dear to
you. 1 took all my pronunciation cues
from my parents and their friends until
one day, at the age of four, I got
laughed at by a bitchy girl, Veronica,
for requesting a glass of "worm milk."
Since then, older and wiser people
have frequently offered me sound
bites of unsolicited advice. "Dress for
the job you want, not the job you have"
is an old favorite. It's a great career tip
that speaks to a greater truth — act the
part first and the transformation will
follow. It's the magical metamorphosis
from the outside in, the self-fulfilling
prophecy in human behavior.

I have never
wanted a job. I
have, however,
always wanted to
be brilliant, lumi
nous and widely
admired. I've yet
to uncover the
hidden talent that
will bring me this
acclaim, but older
and wiser people

assure me that chance favors the pre
pared.
So I've tried to be wary of the for
eigners, the academics, the goofs,
dorks and other groups whose man
nerisms might weigh me down in my
ascent into the stratosphere of fame.
Rather than absorb the quirks of those
around me. I've adopted the habit of
staring wildly at the inessential screen
action in movies, trying to rectify my
own irregularities.
I've learned many invaluable things
from film. For instance, when making
an impassioned point, you should
squint and bob your head to properly
convey your level of conviction. Also
that you should locate the front, back
and arms of a sweater before putting it
on so as to minimize the amount of
time you spend mumbling and twisting
a mass of wool around your head.
Details, perhaps — but if God is in
the details, so, too, must be God-like
status.
But despite my careful years of ob
servations, I'm no closer to deity than 1
was at four, and I've been forced to re
assess my approach to future glory.
I've realized that my blundering com
patriots, whom I previously refused to
credit with having ambitions equal to
mine, have been following similar prin
ciples all along. Obvious, perhaps, but
I think I suppressed the memory of the
summer I was 12, sitting poolside while
my friends devoted hours to nailing the
dance from the music video of *N
Sync's "Bye Bye Bye."
It seems the crucial tool in imple
menting my strategy is a flawless filter
on screen behavior. But. with no live
performances to compare them to, it's
tough to identify which gestures and
phrases would further my goals.
1 should have realized this problem
long ago when 1 pondered the way
movie characters clean their teeth:
They brush while staring at their hot,
foamy reflections. They spit. Then
they walk away. I have tried this, and it
sucks.
So movies can be misleading, but 1
won't swing around and say they al
ways steer you in the wrong direction.
I've seen plenty of real-world evidence
that you should plan before pulling on
a sweater and squint and bob when ar
guing a point. I'm sure my audiovisual
cultural guides have saved me often
from falling back on the awkwardness
familiar to me. Nonetheless, 1 suspect
watching movies won't be propelling
me to stardom anytime soon.
While disappointed. I've been try
ing to find another route to greatness
by examining some tangible specimens
of admirable people. I've located a
few, most notably Louis Dang, Cass of
•01. who is regarded by many as the
coolest person on earth. The one thing
he and the others have in common is
that — God help me — they are nice
people, not condescending pricks who
carefully evaluate the way each ac
quaintance blows their nose.
So while I'm weaning myself off this
imitation of the movies, I'll be trying to
get in on the whole "good-person"
thing, too. I'll have a lot to work on,
and I can't stop kicking myself for not
getting a jump on it earlier. Even in my
younger days, the older and wiser peo
ple were already giving me their ad
vice.
"Hey!" they screamed, as I bopped
Veronica on the head. "Play nice!"

Is there anyone in the world who really
spits and doesntt rinse? Please, someone,
enlighten igliu@stanford. edit.
