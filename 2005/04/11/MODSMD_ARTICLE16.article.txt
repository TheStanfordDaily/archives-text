# New service to prevent drunk dialing
## 
### CHRISTOPHER PEDREGAL 
You wake up Saturday morn
ing after a long night of partying.
You're sitting in bed, trying to
piece together what you remem
ber from the previous night,
when a sudden fear grips you.
You grab your cell phone and
check the last numbers you
called, praying your parents' or
ex-girlfriend's or current crush's
number don't appear on the list
of outgoing calls.
If this has ever happened to you,
you are well aware of the dangers
of calling people while intoxicated.
Due to a new cell phone service,
however, drunk dialing may soon
be a thing of the past.
Drunk dialing has become a
major problem (or pastime) at
American universities where there
is no shortage of cell phones, alco
hol or young people.
Virgin Mobile Australia is of
fering a new service that allows cell
phone users to block certain num
bers from being called when drunk.
For the service to work, users
need to dial "333" plus the phone
number they want to protect. That
number is then off limits until 6
a.m. the next morning.
The hope is that users will pro
tect themselves from embarrass
ment and block important phone
numbers — those of their boss,
their parents or other relatives —
before they go out and party.
Virgin Mobile Australia decid
ed to offer the service after notic
ing an epidemic rise in drunk-dial
ing across the country. A recent
survey done by the company of
more than 400 people concluded
that 95 percent of cell phone users
drunk dial, and that 30 percent of
those calls were to former signifi
cant others.
Virgin Mobile USA is consider
ing offering the service, but does
not yet have a definitive timeline.
Sophomore Anish Hariharan
says he would consider using the
service if it came to Stanford.
"My mother really doesn't ap

predate my drunken calls, so it
might be useful."
He does not think, however,
that the service would solve the
drunk dialing problem at Stanford.
"The reason people drunk-dial
is because they think it's fun, so a
service like this won't stop it. 1
don't think Stanford students
would use it."
He may be right - at least six stu
dents have drunk dialing listed as
one of their interests on their pro
files on TheFacebook.com, and
with free night time minutes, the
practice is becoming more and
more popular.
Freshman Matt Spitz thinks
drunk dialing is harmless most of
the time, but it has the potential to
complicate relationships.
"It can be fun if you drunk dial
the right people. But if you call
the wrong people, it can be really,
really tragic. Since the person is
not standing in front of you, it's
much easier to say things you
don't mean, and that can cause
problems."
Another problem with the ser
vice is that it is not fail-proof. In
case of emergency, a user can clear
all blocked numbers by dialing
"333-CLEAR." This is necessary
for safety reasons, but seems to
void the service since there is noth
ing to stop people from doing that
while under the influence.
Using the service also has its
costs — Virgin Mobile Australia
argues that the 25-cent charge is a
small price to pay for your peace of
mind. The company has yet to say
whether the service has been suc
cessful.
The website Slackertown.com
also hopes to curb the problem of
drunk-dialing. The premise of the
Web site is that instead of calling
your friends while drunk, you
should call the Web site's phone
number, (321) 6(H)-1200.
The calls are then posted on the
Web site for the enjoyment of ev
eryone on the internet, and are
ranked by gender, drunkenness
and comic value.
