Editor's Note: This spring, The Daily will feature a story
every Monday reporting on the past weekend's on-campus
social events.
The weekend may have been dry because of fraternity
and sorority recruitment, but that doesn't mean there wasn't
lots to do, especially if you were involved in the rush process.
Sorority recruitment started last Monday with an orienta
tion and continued for the rest of the week. Hundreds of girls
packed into the conference rooms at Tresidder for hours on end.
Events included meeting different sorority members and get
ting entertained by slideshows, skits and lots of conversation.
Tonight, the girls who have stayed through the rush pro

cess will be treated to "Preference Night" at the Sheraton
Hotel in Palo Alto, where they ultimately will decide which
sorority fits them best
Fraternity recruitment has just completed its first of two
weeks and has filled many a crazy night for both the frater
nity members and the prospective members. Highlights in
cluded two mechanical bull-riding events, at Phi Psi and
Kappa Sig, a water fight between Sigma Chi and Sigma Nu,
and "Smashy Smashy" at the DKE, where party goers were
given hammers and told to annihilate an old car, which was
purchased for this purpose.
ZAP hosted the only large-scale open party of the week
end — and since the house could serve alcohol — the party
was packed with students desperate to bump and grind.
Masquerade-themed "Club Uj," thrown by Ujamma,

was the most publicized social event of the weekend. The
event was well attended; great beats and plenty of booty
shaking action made for an enjoyable night for all.
For those not involved in the Greek scene, given that
there was less to do than on an average weekend, many Stan
ford students found or created their own social scene. From
basement parties, trips to San Francisco and skiing for one
of the last available weekends, people kept busy. Many stu
dents hit up the silver screen to see newly released movies
including the notorious comic-booked-based "Sin City" and
the new romantic comedy "Fever Pitch."
Once the Greeks have made their choices and students
are free again to kick back with keg beer at parties, spring
quarter socializing will be on its way again. Stay tuned for
the happenings of next weekend.
