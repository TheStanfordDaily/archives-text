## Editorial Yeah, we were shocked too

Alter more than a week of heavy campaigning —
that included putting up colorful fliers, sending out e
mails and.for one candidate, camping out in White
Plaza the 2005 ASSU elections have come to an end.
I here were notable improvements over last year's
election and signs of promise for the upcoming term.
The controversy over the 2(H)4 election caused
many students to question the electoral process and
the purpose of the ASSU. Nevertheless, more stu
dents came out to the polls this year than last, signal
ing a reignition of school spirit and belief in the candi
dates. We predicted, along with the ASSU, that the
higher number of candidates would also increase
voter turnout. And it did, as a total of 5,096 students
voted, a small increase from 4,K96 last year. Overall,
the competition proved to be positive, and none of the
candidates participated in the traditional election
mudslinging.
While we are glad that students were supportive of
groups applying for special fees — in fact, approving
all groups except ('lub Sports for graduate students —
we do wish that they had shown a little more care in
their voting; there were certainly groups applying for
special fees whose money will not benefit much of the
Stanford community.
For students who voted to approve all groups,
please continue to support these groups and refrain
from requesting a special-fees refund. You saw the
amounts listed next to each group; so do not be sur
prised when your ASSU dues go up because you
clicked on every bubble on the election screen.

Measure A — which will consolidate the Program
ming General Fee and Community Service General
Fee into a single Programming and Community Ser
vice General Fee — passed and will allow greater
flexibility in funding student groups. Therefore, re
gardless of special-fees results, this new system should
enable more than a hundred student groups to better
serve the community.
Almost twice as many candidates ran for the Un
dergraduate Senate and Graduate Student Council
than there were positions available. Both groups ap
pear to have diverse students with various back
grounds in campus politics, which should ensure the
participation of a variety of campus communities in
future ASSU endeavors.
The biggest news was probably the victory of
Melanie Kannokada and Aneto Okonkwo in their
campaign to be Stanford's next ASSU president and
vice president, respectively. Judging by the terribly
poor turnout at the executive debates last Monday,
many students were not terribly excited by the race.
However, Kannokada and Okonkwo won 1,757 to
1,501 against runners-up Victoria Carr and Fernando
Castillo in first-round voting — proving that endorse
ments from the Students of Color Coalition, the Stan
ford Democrats and The Stanford Daily do not make
or break an election. Although we endorsed Kann
odaka / Okonkwo's competitors, we are eager to see
the kinds ol changes and improvements they make in
the coming year. Their agenda is broad and ambitious,
and we wish them success.
