"The Cardinal Classic is our
chance to show Stanford the dance
community and what we love to do,"

Group member Kaisa Snellman,
a sociology graduate student, called
the event the "local highlight of the
year."
Kao noted that the number of en
tries has increased by approximately
10 percent each year. As a result, the
SBDT has had to start the competi
tion earlier each time.
"Every year we strive to make
the competition bigger and better,"
Kao said. "We push the boundaries
and come up with new ideas to ex
ceed everyone's expectations. The
caliber of dancing in the evening ses
sion has skyrocketed to rival some of
the local professional competitions
held in this area."
Competitors this year included
students from Stanford, Berkeley.
UC San Diego, UC Davis, UC Santa
Barbara, San Diego State University
and Cal Poly San Luis Obisbo, in ad
dition to local amateurs.
Newcomers inexperienced with
ballroom dance competitions were
also able to test their skills on the

dance floor.
"Collegiate competitions are the
best place to have your first compe
tition," Kao said. "All the competi
tors from beginning to advanced lev
els know what it's like to dance your
very first competition. During this
event, every competitor cheers for
all the newcomer dancers. It's quite
a sight to see."
The Cardinal Classic featured the
Lithuanian Latin champions Vaidas
Skimelis and Jurga Pupelyte in the
final dances of the evening. Each
year the Classic highlights profes
sional dancers who perform either
Latin or standard dances. The
Lithuanian standard champions per
formed in 2004 and a professional in
ternational standard couple will ap
pear at next year's competition.
"It is exciting that we were able to
get Jurga and Vaidas to perform at
our competition because this is the
best way to highlight a
collegiate competition," said physics
doctoral student Lidiya Polukhina,
the SBDT financial officer."It is
very inspirational."
Those organizing the event said
they appreciated the support and re
spect of local professionals.
"I have put my heart and soul
into running this competition," Kao
said. "It represents my blood, sweat
and tears and it is something that I
am so proud to be a part of. All the
hard work of the previous organiz
ers has culminated year after year in
making each year bigger and better
and I don't foresee that stopping
anytime soon."

rience, and also performs and com
