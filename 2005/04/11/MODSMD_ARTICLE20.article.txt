## A 						column about nothing in particular 
### 
I had some trouble thinking
about a topic for this week's rant (1
mean, this week's intellectual probe
into the plummeting depths of the
human condition at grad school
circa 2005).
The obvious choice would have
been last week's terribly important
ASSIJ election and its effect on our
lives. However, apparently these
pieces need to be at least 400 words
long, and frankly, student elections

don't have 400 words worth of consequences on my life.
Actually, 1 care so little about the annual struggle for
pseudo-political dominance that I'm almost loathe to
write about it. Almost.
I Jntil I sat down to write this 1 had no idea who the
candidates were. After a quick Google search, I still have
no idea who the candidates are. So far, so illuminating.
There are, apparently, 15 voting members of the
Graduate Student Council, or GSC, and last week you
made your choice of representatives. When 1 say "you,"
I mean, of course, the eight people who voted. Well
maybe more than eight, but I've yet to meet anyone
who'll admit to it.
Anyway, this "election" business (the quotation
marks are there fora reason) got me thinking about the
purpose of the GSC — horrible experience, something
like staring al an Escher drawing and trying to figure out
where the lines begin.
It has a lovely website (http://gsc.stanford.edu/)
where you can go to find out all about how hard your
elected representatives work for you. Such selfless dedi
cation almost makes me tear up.
As well as organizing "hot and happening" parties
with help of the Graduate Student Programming Board,

better known as the GSPB (apparently we spend thou
sands each year on generating acronymed subcommit
tees), our people also produce such insightful docu
ments as the "Dental and Vision Report" (45 pages of
fun, fun, fun).
Now, I'm not suggesting that 45 pages on teeth and
eyes is a waste — no, actually 1 am suggesting that. In
fact, as I pointed out above, 1 don't care. However, I
can't help but feel that the existence of such entities as
the GSC on the fringes of my life is little upsetting.
It bothers me that simply by virtue of being a gradu
ate student I'm still associated with the bureaucratic ed
ifice of student organization. You know, people in the
real world would find this ridiculous. Actually, most of
the people here find it ridiculous.
I guess I'm just frustrated by people who care. And
care about such irrelevant things — flyering of the Grad
uate Community Center, or GCC (more acronyms),
made it on the February 16th agenda. Why can't people
just be apathetic? Normal folks don't debate how much
money to spend on toys for the GCC family room.
It's kind of Kafkaesque as well — well possibly
Kafkaesque, I haven't actually read any Kafka, but some
one once explained it to me in a bar, and 1 really wanted
to use a long word here. There's a sense of abstraction
from the surreal cabal (well cabal may be a little harsh)
who operate the machinery of our pathetic lives, and it's
often hard to find the method behind the madness.
Still, if they do nothing else (and they won't) at least
the week's politicking provided a break from dead pon
tiffs and royal weddings. Plus, despite my earlier reser
vations, I managed to get 574 words out of it.

Are you a Kafka reader who wants to educate me on the
finer points of twentieth century literature while teaching
me long words? E-mail navins@stanford.edu.
