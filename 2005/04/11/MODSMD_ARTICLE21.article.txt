Crew team is about much more than weight
I am writing in response to Spencer Porter's
article, "Making Weight a Heavy Burden"
(April K). While there is some validity to
Porter's claims regarding the level of dedica
tion and the difficulty of training required of
lightweight crew members, his article offers
only one perspective of the sport and places ex
cessive and unnecessary emphasis on the issue
of weight.
I am a senior on the lightweight crew
team, but 1 did not begin crew until more
than halfway through mv sophomore year
and definitely spent my first year-and-a-half
at Stanford living up the traditional "college
no parents!" experience. Don't get me
wrong — of course I had an amazing time.
But alter a while, I wanted to remember
Stanford for something other than "wild par
ties" and "dating Daily columnists who
watch "Sports Center" more times than is so
cially acceptable."
At times my best friends, and even 1, have

wondered if the early mornings, difficult prac
tices and weight-watching were all worth it.
But. when I look back over the past couple of
years — and especially at moments such as
winning the San Diego Crew Classic last week
or last Saturday's victory over Georgetown —
there is not a doubt in my mind. Winning aside,
the experiences of competing and being part of
a team, which even includes those early morn
ing practices, have been worth it.
Yes, crew is not easy. Erging is painful, but
college-level sports in general require in
tense (read: difficult) training. Our team has
amazing coaches who do push hard, but si
multaneously realize our physical and mental
limitations. Making weight is not the most
fun experience either, but the number on the
scale is only a number. I'm not going to deny,
as Porter predicted, that weight is a signifi
cant issue on the team; if you weigh in at over
130 pounds, you do not row in a race. It's
true. But, all of the athletes on the team are
aware of the 130-pound weight limit, work to
lose weight (if they need to) on a regimented

schedule and know that the more unhealthy
methods, such as dehydration, are only a last
resort. Also, although there are no officially
enforced restrictions in the sport, Stanford
coaches usually don't let an athlete who
weighs more than 140 pounds join and expect
her to drop the weight later.
While I understand the criticisms. Porter's
column was an inadequate effort to describe
the sport or explain the pressures of making
weight.

Daily's criticism of The Stanford Review
was hypocritical
It would have been nice if The Daily prac
ticed what it preached in criticizing The
Stanford Review for not double-checking its
facts ("Conservatives deserve a better paper
than The Review," April 8). It is hypocritical
of The Daily to make these type of state
ments without providing any facts of its own

to hack it up.
The Review is accused of being unprofes
sional and is told that "its staff must begin to
double-check its facts before printing articles
that make unsubstantiated inflammatory
statements and misrepresent the parties in
volved." Perhaps the editorial should have
cited the facts that were not double-checked to
support its point.
The Daily characterizes the Review's arti
cles on Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de
Aztlan and the Black Student Union as "smear
campaigns." Where are the facts that back up
such an inflammatory statement?
The editorial concluded by suggesting that
The Review look to the Hoover Institution for
help. Where should The Daily look for help?
The New York Times?
The Daily's accusations of The Review are
as baseless as those they claim The Review has
made. That is the definition of hypocrisy.
