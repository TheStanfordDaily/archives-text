# A 						break from the bubble
## The 						only kind of inflation we like 
### 
The scene: a recent econ class at a
community college. The witness to
the following bizarre interaction:
me. Upon receiving our most recent
midterm back, a student raised her
hand, was called on and proceeded
to complain that the professor grad
ed too harshly — the average on the
test was a "C" — and that he wasn't

effectively teach
ing the material.
Grade infla
tion has fre
quently (and in
Harvard's case,
famously) been
discussed by the
popular media.
It seems to be
undisputed that
grades are going

up. But is this such a bad thing?
(Anyone who has taken Ethics of
Development in a Global Environ
ment, or EDGE, will answer no.)
In defending my college grades
being higher than my mom's (she
simply won't accept the argument
that I'm smarter). I asserted that
even it my "B" was equivalent to her
"C," it should be. My average final
paper is roughly 3,00() words, some
thing my mom couldn't contemplate
back in the dark ages of typewriters.
Though technology may make it
easier to type 3,000 words, it means
having more to write about, and
therefore requires additional re
search. My mother would be lucky
to get a "C" today for B-level work
she did back in the day.
However, others argue that pro
fessors are pressured into giving high
er grades. In his intriguing article,
"The Truth about Harvard," in the
March issue of The Atlantic Monthly.
Ross Douthat, a recent Harvard
graduate, wrote about one professor
who gave both a "public," or inflated
grade to be displayed on transcripts,
and an "ironic" grade to let students
know what they reallv deserve.

The implication of this policy and
of (he grade inflation discussion in
general is that students are seeking
(and sometimes demanding) higher
grades than they deserve. At least at
a school like Stanford, what they
"deserve" is hard to measure. Just as
an example, medical schools often
reject applicants with CPAs below a
certain number. Is it fair fora stu
dent at Stanford to have taken more
rigorous pre-requisites (and there
fore received a lower grade) than a
student who aced less difficult mate
rial at a state school? (A shout-out
to my often miserable pre-med
friends: You'll be saving the world
someday, and I'll be making your
lattes.)
Perhaps the entire discussion of
grade inflation is indicative of a larg
er problem: We've become more
concerned with the grade we earn
than the knowledge we learn.
Maybe it's not that we're being
molly-coddled. Maybe it's just that
we're all trying to over-achieve
more than our forebears, and this
extra competitiveness has translated
to our grades.
My economics professor had the
perfect response to my fellow class
mate: He wasn't concerned about
her first complaint. He may give
lower grades than other profs, and if
so, well, he's just an old curmud
geon.
But he was concerned about her
second grievance, that he wasn't ef
fectively teaching the material.
Maybe we should spend less time fo
cusing on the grade we receive, and
more time ensuring that we are
learning everything we need (and
want) to know.
