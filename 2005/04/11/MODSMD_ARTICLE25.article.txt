# 'Company' cast pleased by opening
## 
### SARAH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
Friday night marked the opening
of "Company," a musical put on by
Ram's Head Theatrical Society star
ring senior Chris Babson as the only
single one in a group of friends who
are paired off in couples. The show
was widely acknowledged as a suc
cess, not only by those involved in
the production, but also by the audi
ence.
"The cast and crew put on an ex
cellent show," said freshman Lauren
Harper, who saw the performance
on Saturday. "The quirky characters,
the songs and the set made it truly
entertaining."
Others in the audience seemed
similarly enthusiastic — impressed
with the small cast of 14 and the cal
iber of acting. A few viewers criti
cized the occasional off-key note,
but Director Merritt Baer, a sopho
more, attributed this, in part, to
poor acoustics in Memorial Audito
rium, where the performance took
place.
The producer of the show, sopho
more Sara Kaiser, noted that about
half the seats available were filled
both nights. She also said that the au
dience seemed to enjoy the show,
which made it more fun for the stu
dents to perform.
"1 think [the cast] felt really good
afterward," Kaiser said. "Especially
the opening night, the audience was
laughing at every joke. You can hear
that from the stage."
The cast members and director

echoed this sentiment, agreeing that
the audience improved the perfor
mance.
"It's amazing having an audience
to watch what we've been spending
all this time working on," said senior
Lisa Rowland who played Joanne,
an embittered woman who has been
married many times. "That added
energy just heightened everything
for me and in fact helped me focus
more intensely on what goes on on
stage."
One of the main challenges, the
actors said, was that none of them
have experienced marriage or di
vorce. both of which are central to
the show's plot. This lack of experi
ence existed for most of the play's
audience members too. Baer said he
tried to address this problem while
working with the cast.
"One of the biggest challenges is
that a bunch of 20-somethings are
playing a bunch of 30-somethings,"
he said. "We tried to orient [the pro
duction] toward a younger genera
tion so that students could relate to
the relationships."
Several of the cast members said
that they had some difficulty relating
to their characters at first, both be
cause of the gap in life experience
and because many of the characters
are so exaggerated that it was diffi
cult to depict a real life version of
them. In order to overcome these
difficulties, the actors said they tried
to relate to the character on some
level and then seek to understand
him or her completely.
"It's true that my own experi

ences and outlook share very little
with those of Joanne." Rowland
said. "Her extreme negativity and
sarcastic, cynical view of the world
are not something that 1 can say I
share with her, hut her behaviors are
not so foreign."

Similarly, junior Mamie Rhein
gold said her portrayal of Amy — a
neurotic woman terrified of mar
riage — is based partially on shared
experiences but also on suppositions
about Amy's true nature.
"I think 1 connect with Amy's

high energy and passion and I'm
lucky to have a devoted boyfriend
like Amy's adorable Paul," Rhein
gold said. "But Amy's neuroses are
unique to her. I guess my biggest
challenge was making Amy believ
ably eccentric, but still loveable."

With two performances down
and three to go, the cast hopes to
keep their energy level high and to
draw more students and community
members to the performance, which
will continue on this Thursday, Fri
day and Saturday.
