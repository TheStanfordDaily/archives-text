### RAGHAV THAPAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After 28 years of teaching improvisation and
drama at Stanford, Patricia Ryan is holding her
final class. But there was nothing improvised
about her decision to make this the final quarter
of her distinguished teaching career. She said it is
time to move on.
She will begin on a new chapter of her life —
promoting her new book. "Improv Wisdom:
Don't Prepare. Just Show Up." giving improvisa
tion lectures and running workshops and semi
nars.
Since stepping foot on the Stanford campus in
1977 with a master's degree from Lane State Uni
versity, Ryan has taught more than a dozen class
es and served as the head of Stanford's Under
graduate Acting Program. In 1998, she won the
Dinkelspiel award for outstanding teaching.
Yet she says her greatest accomplishment was
founding the Stanford Improvisers, or Simps, in
1991. She called the group more a "fraternity than
a regular organization" because of the intense
bond that members form with one another. Ryan

added that the Simps gave her what she considers
her greatest moment at the University.
"For the 10-year reunion of the Simps, we had
a show at Dinkelspiel Auditorium where all the
alumni returned to show their skills," she said. "It
showed me what an amazing group of alumni we
had."
Simps members said they will miss her be
cause she played such an integral role in the
group's development.
"As far as the Simps are concerned, she is the
karmic center of our group," senior Andrew
Waxman said. "We are a very capable and proac
tive group, but she is the knowledge and energy
force for us."
Aside from teaching her students the art of im
provisation, she has also taught them life lessons
— like telling a joke. For instance, she stressed
that students should tell a story instead of simply
skipping to the punch-line, and she encouraged
her students to build positive relationships with
one another.
Improvisation skills can also help out in real
life, she said. She told her students that it is im
portant to take the time to remember names even

if they insist that they are "bad with names." By
the end of every first class meeting, Ryan has
everyone's name memorized.
On the whole, Ryan has brought the Stanford
community more than laughter.
"Patricia's classes are life-altering as she does
not just train us how to improv. she teaches us
how to live improve," Waxman said. "Her classes
give students invaluable skills to face challenges
in academia. life and later on in the business
world."
Ryan said there is one key lesson that she
wants to offer all students.
" I hope Stanford students can take classes out
side the general curriculum that can open up their
heart and their mind," she said.
Ryan said she plans to stay close to campus
and attend Simps shows whenever possible.
"Teaching at Stanford is one of the greatest
jobs there is," she said. "I cannot imagine a
more wonderful environment and I hope stu
dents step back and pay attention to the miracle
of being able to study at a university with such
amazing resources. 1 cannot think of a better life
for myself."
