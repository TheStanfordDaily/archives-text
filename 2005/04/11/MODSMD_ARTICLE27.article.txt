# Alameda County tackles HIV/AIDS
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
OAKLAND — Given the fo
cused media coverage that HIV /
AIDS has had in international re
gions such as sub-Saharan Africa,
Latin America and Asia, it is often
easy to forget that the disease still
hits very close to home.
At the opening of the confer
ence of the American Foundation
for AIDS Research, or AmFAR,
Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D
-yth district), Co-Chairmen of the
conference Mervyn Silverman
and Arnold Perkins and Execu
tive Director of the Native Amer
ican AIDS Prevention Center
Michael Bird addressed both local
and national issues in light of the
AIDS epidemic.
The conference is currently
taking place in Alameda County,
which includes major cities such as
Berkeley, Fremont and Oakland.
The county was the first munici
pality to ever declare a state of
emergency for AIDS-related is
sues, due to the seriousness of the
epidemic in the area. For this rea
son, Silverman, a trustee of the
AmFAR. called the location of
the conference a "model county
for attacking the epidemic."
Perkins, director of the
Alameda County Public Health
Department, addressed the steps
that the county is currently tak
ing to address the high rates of
HIV / AIDS that still exist there.
Although AIDS rates are declin
ing in the United States in gener
al, the rates in Alameda County
exceed those of the state and na
tion. In addition, in Alameda
County — as in many communi
ties in the United States — AIDS
has hit communities of color par

ticularly hard.
"The epidemic has changed
colors," Perkins said. "We are fo
cusing on addressing the issues of
the marginalized communities."
Lee also addressed national is
sues such as President George W.
Bush's abstinence-only education
policy, calling it a "death sentence
for many." She said she is current
ly pushing the administration to
pass the Responsible Education
About Life Act — also known as
the REAL act — which would
provide comprehensive sex edu
cation in schools.
"Young people need to know
the science, they need to be en
couraged to know about all of the
options they have," Lee said.
When asked about AIDS
treatment for illegal immigrants,
an important issue in California,
Perkins replied that he did not be
lieve that politics should play into
critical health issues.
"I'm not in politics," Perkins
said. "I'm in health. We have to
step up and deal with our own
communities. Church groups
have to help. Civic clubs have to
help — this is a community prob
lem. If we didn't have all of the im
migrants coming from Mexico, we
wouldn't have the wealth we have
today, so we have a responsibility
to address."
The conference, which will run
until Wednesday, will highlight
both the medical and social issues
associated with HIV and AIDS.
"You can't just look at a med
ical model [of HIV/AIDS],"
stressed Lee at the briefing. "We
don't have a universal health care
system and there are huge health
disparities in the nation. Often, it
is the underprivileged people who
end up bearing the burden."
