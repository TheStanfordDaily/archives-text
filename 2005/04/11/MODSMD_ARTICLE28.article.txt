# Disability conference addresses pornograpy
## 
### NEIL HUGHES INDEPENDENT FLORIDA ALLIGATOR 
(U-WIRE) GAINESVILLE,
Fla. â€” The great porn debate con
tinued at UF on Thursday night - sort
of.
"I think we should all watch
midget porn. It's fun," said Bethany
Stevens, president of the Union of
Students with Disabilities.
And with that attention-grabbing
statement, Stevens introduced one
of the more controversial speakers
to visit the University of Florida.
Former porn star Bridget "the
Midget" Power/ was the main attrac
tion at the "Building a DisAbility
Movement" conference in the Reitz
Union Grand Ballroom.
Power/ was one of a number of
speakers who discussed sexuality
and disability in a blunt and, at times,
brutally honest fashion.
"I did catch an STD (sexually
transmitted disease) doing an adult
film," Power/said. "It was, 1 believe,
chlamydia. For those of you not fa
miliar, it is treatable if it's caught on
time."
"I didn't want to die," she added.
Power/'s negative experiences in
porn led her to leave the industry.
She remains, however, an adult
dancer, which she said earns her a lot
of money.
"My left knee is crooked," she
said, referencing her disability, "so
that's why I always wear leg warmers
when I'm on stage dancing."
Power/ said she believes her
roles in mainstream films such as
"Confessions of a Dangerous

Mind" and "SWAT" have given
positive exposure for people with
disabilities.
Stevens, who organized the con
ference, said she received a great
deal of criticism for having a porn
star represent disabled people.
She remarked that she is comfort
able talking about her sex life, noting
that a nude painting of her was fea
tured in the presentation by artist
Sunny Taylor, who also spoke at the
conference.
"Grow up. Wake up. It's just sex.
It's just expression," Stevens said.
Sexologist Mitchell Tepper spoke
of sex that most of the media won't
discuss - sexual activity between peo
ple with disabilities.
"People with disabilities have
routinely been viewed as childlike
and not interested in sex or sexual
behavior, nor primary targets for re
production," Tepper said.
Tepper, who uses a wheelchair,
has done research on people who ex
perience orgasms after spinal-cord
injuries; they are typically perceived
not to experience sexual pleasure.
But the spiritual and emotional
pleasures of sex are just as important
as the physical ones, he said.
Immediately after injury, people
feel "sexually devastated," he said,
but years later, disabled people can
have a healthy sex life.
"Sex is a bonding mechanism that
can bring and keep people together,"
he said.
The event's other speakers were
radio talk-show host Greg Smith and
self-described "adrenaline junkie"
and wheelchair daredevil Tyler
Deith.
