do, a service for cell phones that provides a map
with the location of your friends, does that and
more — it also gives you personalized information
about local hot spots, events and parties.
While the finished product isn't ready, the team
of four Stanford students working on Viendo took
a step closer to making the service a reality on Sat
urday at the first ever Business Symposium when
they won $2,(HK) in the Business Plan Competition.
The symposium, sponsored by the Business As
sociation of Stanford Engineering Students, or
BASES, in conjunction with the Asian Business
Association of UC Berkeley, included more than
just the contest. Six workshops covered topics
ranging from accounting and finance to social en
trepreneurship. Speakers hailed from companies
such as Intel and Deloitte Consulting.
"Our speakers are our sponsors
and alumni — most of whom have
assisted us before in events like
this," said junior Nancy Gong, an
officer of BASES Interact, a com
ponent of BASES. "Throughout
the year, we invite them to mixers
and other events to ensure that
they are kept up to date with
BASES' events. UC Berkeley also
recruited their sponsors and alum
ni."
BASES is one of the largest pro
fessional groups in the Bay Area.
Created in 1996 by a group of Stan
ford engineering students to pro
mote entrepreneurship, it has since
expanded to include students of all
disciplines and degrees. In addi
tion to the Business Plan Competi
tion, BASES sponsors three other
business plan competitions, entre
preneurial workshops and semi
nars and several other events.
Senior Karen Law. one of the
event organizers and vice president
of BASES Interact, said that orga
nizers wanted to hold a large-scale
event to attract undergraduates,
since the other competitions attract
a larger number of graduate stu
dents.
"Our goal was to reach out to stu

dents who ordinarily wouldn't enter
these competitions and expose them
to some of the key aspects of entre
preneurship, to inspire them to pur
sue their own ideas," Law said. "Be
cause we wanted the Business Sym
posium to be more prominent than
other Interact events within Stan
ford, we looked to Berkeley to ex
pand the event."
The symposium featured the
final round of the Business Plan
Competition, which included pre
sentations to a panel of Bay Area
business representatives by nine
teams chosen from a preliminary
round. Their presentations were
judged according to innovation,
plausibility, analysis of obstacles, fi
nancial sustainability, value to soci
ety and management.
The teams created extremely dif
ferent products and services, includ
ing software to facilitate tutoring in
East Palo Alto, a college laundry
service and leather laptop bags mar
keted especially for the "metropoli
tan woman." The judging panel
asked questions about the specific
details of the business plans.
While Stanford students repre
sented six of the nine teams in the
final round. Law said that most of
the initial participants in the compe
tition were from Berkeley.
"While we had a large group of
participants coming from Berkeley,
we had hoped we would have more
Stanford participation outside of the

teams that advanced to the final
round," she said. "The response we
received was strongly in favor of
making the Business Symposium an
annual event, so increasing the num
ber of participants, especially from
Stanford, will be a goal for next
year."
Viendo, the winning team, con
sists of sophomore computer science
majors Sam Altman, Alok Desh
pande and Nick Sivo, and senior
Peter Deming, a management sci
ence and engineering major. Altman
said that the team had begun work
ing on the concept of a cell phone so
cial network well before they en
tered the competition.
"I got together with some
friends of mine from the dorm and
my CS classes," he said. "We didn't
prepare for this competition very
much, but 1 think {he presentation
went well."
Junior Vinay Mahagaokar, the
creator of Textopedia — the Web
site that allows students to sell text
books to other students on campus
— and a BASES Interact officer,
said that BASES and business plan
competitions help students pursue
business ideas.
"Writing a business plan forces a
student to think through all aspects
of his or her idea," he said. "While
presenting a business plan, judges
ask difficult questions that challenge
one's ideas. This forces the students
to improve upon the weaker points

in their business plans."
NetVention, a company from UC
Berkeley that created a system to co
ordinate convention-scale events,
took second place. Stanford sopho
more George Kwon, juniors Adam
Kircher and Schuyler Ullman and
senior Josh Seifert won the third
place prize with campuSmart, a free
online marketplace to connect local
users.
Kircher said his own experiences
contributed to the concept behind
campuSmart.
"This project was inspired by the
pain and suffering I went through as
a freshman on campus trying to find
a bike," he said. "1 tried everything:
Craig's list, eßay, SUMarket — but
nothing worked out. 1 realized that
other people probably have the
same needs, since there's no good
way to sell things yourself here."
Kwon said that the success of
campuSmart in the competition was
based, in part, on its simplicity.
"There aren't very many compli
cated components in our venture,"
he said. "The questions the judges
asked were really basic — they
didn't probe as much as they did with
the other groups, so we weren't real
ly nervous during the presentation."
The $500 prize for the campuS
mart team will go toward funding the
venture, the team members said.
"First we'll probably have a cele
bratory dinner," Kircher said. "But
after that, it's all hard work."

sue their own ideas," Law said. "Be
cause we wanted the Business Sym
posium to be more prominent than
other Interact events within Stan
ford, we looked to Berkeley to ex
pand the event."
The symposium featured the
final round of the Business Plan
Competition, which included pre
sentations to a panel of Bay Area
business representatives by nine
teams chosen from a preliminary
round. Their presentations were
judged according to innovation,
plausibility, analysis of obstacles, fi
nancial sustainability, value to soci
ety and management.
The teams created extremely dif
ferent products and services, includ
ing software to facilitate tutoring in
East Palo Alto, a college laundry
service and leather laptop bags mar
keted especially for the "metropoli
tan woman." The judging panel
asked questions about the specific
details of the business plans.
While Stanford students repre
sented six of the nine teams in the
final round. Law said that most of
the initial participants in the compe
tition were from Berkeley.
"While we had a large group of
participants coming from Berkeley,
we had hoped we would have more
Stanford participation outside of the

teams that advanced to the final
round," she said. "The response we
received was strongly in favor of
making the Business Symposium an
annual event, so increasing the num
ber of participants, especially from
Stanford, will be a goal for next
year."
Viendo, the winning team, con
sists of sophomore computer science
majors Sam Altman, Alok Desh
pande and Nick Sivo, and senior
Peter Deming, a management sci
ence and engineering major. Altman
said that the team had begun work
ing on the concept of a cell phone so
cial network well before they en
tered the competition.
"I got together with some
friends of mine from the dorm and
my CS classes," he said. "We didn't
prepare for this competition very
much, but 1 think {he presentation
went well."
Junior Vinay Mahagaokar, the
creator of Textopedia — the Web
site that allows students to sell text
books to other students on campus
— and a BASES Interact officer,
said that BASES and business plan
competitions help students pursue
business ideas.
"Writing a business plan forces a
student to think through all aspects
of his or her idea," he said. "While
presenting a business plan, judges
ask difficult questions that challenge
one's ideas. This forces the students
to improve upon the weaker points

in their business plans."
NetVention, a company from UC
Berkeley that created a system to co
ordinate convention-scale events,
took second place. Stanford sopho
more George Kwon, juniors Adam
Kircher and Schuyler Ullman and
senior Josh Seifert won the third
place prize with campuSmart, a free
online marketplace to connect local
users.
Kircher said his own experiences
contributed to the concept behind
campuSmart.
"This project was inspired by the
pain and suffering I went through as
a freshman on campus trying to find
a bike," he said. "1 tried everything:
Craig's list, eßay, SUMarket — but
nothing worked out. 1 realized that
other people probably have the
same needs, since there's no good
way to sell things yourself here."
Kwon said that the success of
campuSmart in the competition was
based, in part, on its simplicity.
"There aren't very many compli
cated components in our venture,"
he said. "The questions the judges
asked were really basic — they
didn't probe as much as they did with
the other groups, so we weren't real
ly nervous during the presentation."
The $500 prize for the campuS
mart team will go toward funding the
venture, the team members said.
"First we'll probably have a cele
bratory dinner," Kircher said. "But
after that, it's all hard work."

While the finished product isn't ready, the team
of four Stanford students working on Viendo took
a step closer to making the service a reality on Sat
urday at the first ever Business Symposium when
they won $2,(HK) in the Business Plan Competition.
The symposium, sponsored by the Business As
sociation of Stanford Engineering Students, or
BASES, in conjunction with the Asian Business
Association of UC Berkeley, included more than
just the contest. Six workshops covered topics
ranging from accounting and finance to social en
trepreneurship. Speakers hailed from companies
such as Intel and Deloitte Consulting.
"Our speakers are our sponsors
and alumni — most of whom have
assisted us before in events like
this," said junior Nancy Gong, an
officer of BASES Interact, a com
ponent of BASES. "Throughout
the year, we invite them to mixers
and other events to ensure that
they are kept up to date with
BASES' events. UC Berkeley also
recruited their sponsors and alum
ni."
BASES is one of the largest pro
fessional groups in the Bay Area.
Created in 1996 by a group of Stan
ford engineering students to pro
mote entrepreneurship, it has since
expanded to include students of all
disciplines and degrees. In addi
tion to the Business Plan Competi
tion, BASES sponsors three other
business plan competitions, entre
preneurial workshops and semi
nars and several other events.
Senior Karen Law. one of the
event organizers and vice president
of BASES Interact, said that orga
nizers wanted to hold a large-scale
event to attract undergraduates,
since the other competitions attract
a larger number of graduate stu
dents.
"Our goal was to reach out to stu

dents who ordinarily wouldn't enter
these competitions and expose them
to some of the key aspects of entre
preneurship, to inspire them to pur
sue their own ideas," Law said. "Be
cause we wanted the Business Sym
posium to be more prominent than
other Interact events within Stan
ford, we looked to Berkeley to ex
