## Fade Into Bolivian New look Golden State on a roll 
### 
Come playoff time, the Golden State
Warriors will once again not be among
the 16 teams competing for the NBA
title. No Warriors team has made the playoffs
since Latrell Sprewell and Chris Webber led
the team to 50 wins in 1994 (of course Webber
was soon traded for Tom freakin' Gugliotta
and Spree would later lose his Converse spon
sorship as well as his ability to feed his kids).
And while the fact that the Warriors
haven't made the playoffs since the height of
flannel doesn't warrant a Daily article, the
Jesus-like resurrection of the Warriors (com
ing off their first 10-win month since April of
1994), deserves some attention.
My immediate reaction after discovering
that Warriors have the best record of any NBA
team from Cali since the All-Star break was

that that their inability to lose
key games down the stretch
was ruining their chances at
securing the No. 1 lottery
pick. Imagine that: since the
All-Star break, the Warriors
have a better record, at 13-7,
than the Kings, the Clippers
and the Lakers.
However, as my buddy
Mahesh so eloquently points

out — it doesn't matter how many ping-pong
balls the Warriors have as they will inevitably
draft a Mike Dunleavy, Jr. Example No. 1: In
1995 the Warriors were "blessed" with the first
overall pick and subsequently drafted Joe
Smith. So, even when the ping-pong balls do
bounce the right way, the Warriors still get
screwed. Example No. 2: In 2002 the Warriors
tied for the worst record (with the similarly
newly resurgent Bulls) which somehow netted
them the third pick and the rights to Dunleavy,
and Warriors fans worldwide immediately
asked themselves in a highly rhetorical man
ner, "Why the hell did we draft Dunleavy with
the third pick?"
You know you've failed as a third pick
when the only time that Warriors fans unani
mously cheer you during the season is when
you get ejected for going ballistic on the refs in
a nationally televised game against the Mavs.
So what can Warriors fans look forward to
next year? In addition to their hideously or
ange alternate uniforms, look fora team that
puts up points and will actually be enjoyable to
watch. Granted, they have a center who feels
more comfortable discussing democracy in
Africa and writing poetry than he does around
a basketball (and he's signed to a $40 million
contract), but with Mickael Pietrus ready to as
sume his deserved nickname, "The Michael
Jordan of France," the Warriors will continue
their recent trend of putting up over 100 points
a game.
Sidenote: Is being called the Michael Jor
dan of France really that great? I mean who
else has France produced? You have the play
er formerly known as Olivier Saint-Jean (also
known as the dude who refused to stand for the
national anthem). Apparently Dominique
Wilkins was actually born in Paris, but in no
way does anybody associate "The Human
Highlight Film" with France.
Perhaps realizing that the Warriors haven't
been this exciting since the days of Run TMC, GM


Neil Davis
Chris Mullin scored a huge coup in his
trade for the offensive-minded Baron
Davis. Paired with J-Rich, the War
riors have now put up 100 points in 11
of their last 12 games, which has re
sulted in 11 victories, including wins
against the playoff bound Kings and
Suns.

Some doubters of the Warriors
recent success might tell Warriors
fans that, as a team out of the playoff
race, the Warriors have absolutely
no pressure to perform. While this
argument holds some validity, as a
long-suffering fan of the Warriors
forced to watch the Team Formerly
Known as the Warriors (a.k.a. the
Wizards) about to make the playoffs
in the East, as well as endure draft
day blunders, eight straight victories
represents a renaissance in War
riorsville.

My prediction for next year: As
suming the continued health of in
jury-prone Baron Davis, combined
with the continued growth of 18-
year-old Latvian sensation Andris
Biedrins, the Warriors will return to
the playoffs as a seven seed. Pande
monium will ensue.

night's Warriors game, where he got
