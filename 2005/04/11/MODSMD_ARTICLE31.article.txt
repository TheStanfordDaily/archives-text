# One heartbreaker, one upset for Card

### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Phil Sheng had just broken his op
ponent in the previous game to gain a
6-5 lead in the third set.
Advantage Stanford.
The senior paused fora second,
glanced at the service box and then
served an ace down the T. His Trojan
opponent didn't even make contact
with the ball, and that point clinched
the game, set and match for the No.
18 Stanford men's tennis team, which
wrapped up an upset win over No. 13
Southern California yesterday after
noon at Taube Tennis Stadium.
"It would have been very easy for
the whole team to put their heads
down and think about what might
have been [in Saturday's loss to
UCLA] or what might have been [in
March's 4-3 loss to] Illinois," head
coach John Whitlinger said. "We've
had a lot of 'what might have beens,'
but the guys really focused well. They
had a great warmup. and it was espe
cially nice to see the bottom of the
lineup put those three 'S's on the
board."
After a narrow 4-3 loss to No. 6
UCLA on Saturday, the Cardinal
(11-8, 3-2 Pacific-10 Conference) re
grouped and resumed their match
against the Trojans on Sunday. The
match against USC began on Friday
but was postponed until yesterday
due to rain. When play was halted,
each team had won three of the first
sets apiece in singles. Because of the

weather and time constraints, singles
play began first with doubles play
pending on results.
As play resumed, four of the
matches finished in straight sets. At
the second singles position. No. 18 ju
nior KC Corkery won three games to
finish out his match, 6-4, 6-2. No. 93
Johan Berg of USC won five consec
utive games to defeat sophomore
James Wan 6-2, 6-4 at the third sin
gles position.
Although Stanford's final two sin
gles positions had been dealt defeats
the previous day, both players pulled
through and won in straight sets.
Sophomore Eric McKean played at
the fifth singles position and clinched
a 7-5, 6-3 victory, and freshman Phil
Kao battled in a close match and ulti
mately prevailed, 7-6,7-5.
With the match score in Stan
ford's advantage, 3-1, the crowd was
torn between which of the two re
maining matches to watch: Sheng was
at the fifth position and No. 2 Sam
Warburg, the team's other senior,
was at the first spot. Sheng's third set
was on serve and tied at 5-5. That's
when the senior seized his opportuni
ty and sealed the Stanford victory.
"It's tough for [opponents] to
stick with [Phil] if he's hitting his
serve and his forehand well," assis
tant coach David Hodge said.
On the other side of the stadium,
Warburg was down a set and 3-4 in
the second set as play began yester
