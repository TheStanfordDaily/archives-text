# One heartbreaker, one upset for Card
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Phil Sheng had just broken his op
ponent in the previous game to gain a
6-5 lead in the third set.
Advantage Stanford.
The senior paused fora second,
glanced at the service box and then
served an ace down the T. His Trojan
opponent didn't even make contact
with the ball, and that point clinched
the game, set and match for the No.
18 Stanford men's tennis team, which
wrapped up an upset win over No. 13
Southern California yesterday after
noon at Taube Tennis Stadium.
"It would have been very easy for
the whole team to put their heads
down and think about what might
have been [in Saturday's loss to
UCLA] or what might have been [in
March's 4-3 loss to] Illinois," head
coach John Whitlinger said. "We've
had a lot of 'what might have beens,'
but the guys really focused well. They
had a great warmup. and it was espe
cially nice to see the bottom of the
lineup put those three 'S's on the
board."
After a narrow 4-3 loss to No. 6
UCLA on Saturday, the Cardinal
(11-8, 3-2 Pacific-10 Conference) re
grouped and resumed their match
against the Trojans on Sunday. The
match against USC began on Friday
but was postponed until yesterday
due to rain. When play was halted,
each team had won three of the first
sets apiece in singles. Because of the

weather and time constraints, singles
play began first with doubles play
pending on results.
As play resumed, four of the
matches finished in straight sets. At
the second singles position. No. 18 ju
nior KC Corkery won three games to
finish out his match, 6-4, 6-2. No. 93
Johan Berg of USC won five consec
utive games to defeat sophomore
James Wan 6-2, 6-4 at the third sin
gles position.
Although Stanford's final two sin
gles positions had been dealt defeats
the previous day, both players pulled
through and won in straight sets.
Sophomore Eric McKean played at
the fifth singles position and clinched
a 7-5, 6-3 victory, and freshman Phil
Kao battled in a close match and ulti
mately prevailed, 7-6,7-5.
With the match score in Stan
ford's advantage, 3-1, the crowd was
torn between which of the two re
maining matches to watch: Sheng was
at the fifth position and No. 2 Sam
Warburg, the team's other senior,
was at the first spot. Sheng's third set
was on serve and tied at 5-5. That's
when the senior seized his opportuni
ty and sealed the Stanford victory.
"It's tough for [opponents] to
stick with [Phil] if he's hitting his
serve and his forehand well," assis
tant coach David Hodge said.
On the other side of the stadium,
Warburg was down a set and 3-4 in
the second set as play began yester
day. but the senior managed to fight
back and claim the second set, 6-4.
Trailing his opponent. No. 10 Jamil
Al-Agbaled3-1 in the third, Warburg
fought back to claim the set. 6-3, and
the final singles win to make the score
5-1 in Stanford's favor.
"Sam's not going to go down with
out a fight." Whitlingersaid. "1 thought
Jamil played a good match, but Sam
just held it together. We changed up a
couple things [like] a little more pres
sure on Jamil's second serve and trying
to get to the net a little bit."
This weekend evoked a feeling of
deja vu as the Cardinal claimed the
victory against USC and suffered a
defeat to UCLA. When Stanford
traveled to Los Angeles at the end of
February, the team posted a 1-1
record as well against the L. A. teams
with the Cardinal losing 4-3 to the
Bruins that time as well.
On Saturday, the Bruins claimed
the doubles point by sweeping all
three of the doubles matches. No. 3
Warburg and Corkery suffered an 8-
6 loss to No. 59 Alberto Francis and
Kris Kwinta. Sheng and junior Jon

Wong were dealt an 8-5 defeat, while
McKean and Wan led 7-1 only to lose
eight games in a row to the Bruins.
Singles play proved suspenseful.
UCLA took an early 2-0 lead with a
straight set victory over McKean at
the fifth singles position. At the top
spot. Warburg won 6-0,6-2 over No.
7 Luben Pampoulov and with the
score 2-1 in the Bruins' favor, the
remaining matches all went to three
sets.
Wan got broken in the final set to
go down 3-4 but immediately broke
back to even the score and then held
serve to go up 5-4. Both Wan and Kao
were at 5-4 in the third sets with their
opponents serving. Wan broke once
again to win his match and even the
overall score at 2-2. But Kao could
not close out his match against No. 66
Fhilipp Gruendler and ultimately
lost, 6-2,0-6,7-5.
After winning the first set
tiebreaker. Corkery jumped to an
early 5-2 lead in the second set but
could not complete the set against
No. 8 Benjamin Kohlloeffel.
Sheng was broken at 3-3 in the
final set. The senior did not tally an
other game following that break and
fell to UCLA's Chris Lam. With the
match already decided at 2-4, Cork
ery managed to close out his own
match by winning the third set. 6-3.
