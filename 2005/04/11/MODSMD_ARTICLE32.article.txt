# Fourth place ends season
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"I can't wait for next year" was likely the thought running
through the head of every Stanford gymnast after the No. 16 Car
dinal (4-8,4-3 Pacific-10 Conference) failed to qualify to NCAA
Nationals this past weekend.
The team needed to place second at the West Regional on
Saturday in order to qualify, but it placed fourth with a 194.75 be
hind No. 2 UCLA, No. 11 Penn State and No. 24 Washington.
With help from its three Olympians, UCLA finished well ahead
of the pack with a 197.025. Only 0.625, however, separated the
Cardinal from second place and what would have been a five
year streak of qualifying to Nationals.
"The beauty of it, though, is that the entire squad returns next
year and three great incoming freshmen have signed letters of in
tent," head coach Kristen Smyth said. "We'll get this team
healthy and the future looks very bright."
The future of this season still looks bright for Tabitha Yim,
one of the team's six freshmen. The fourth-place finisher at
Olympic trials secured herself an individual bid to compete in
the All-Around at Nationals in Alabama from April 21 to 23.
She earned her spot by having one of the top two All-Around
scores excluding those posted by gymnasts on qualifying
teams.
Yim scored a 39.25 in her debut as an All-Around competitor
for the Cardinal, putting her in fifth place at Regionals behind
competitors from UCLA and Penn State. She will enter Nation
als as the top-seeded individual qualifier and has a good chance
to make a mark on the podium on beam and bars.
"It was unbelievable to see Tab perform as well as she did in
her first time competing All-Around in college," Smyth said.
"Her comeback [from a pre-season injury] was absolutely in
spiring."
At the beginning of the season, however, no one would have
guessed that Yim would be competing alone at Nationals. With a
preseason rank of No. 3, a third-place finish at Nationals last year,
and two freshmen coming off top-10 finishes at Olympic trials, the
team's sights were set on a national championship. The thought
of failing to qualify for nationals was hardly on the radar screen.
Injuries changed all that.
Freshmen Liz Tricase and Stephanie Gentry, along with ju
nior All-American Glyn Sweets, three of the team's best com
petitors, stood on the sidelines at Regionals due to respective
ankle, toe and foot injures.
Their presence was particularly missed on the vault, Stan
ford's weakest event of the evening. With only three of six
vaults having the requisite difficulty to start from a 10, Stanford
posted a mere 48.225. The score just edged out last-place fin
isher, No. 14 Central Michigan, and was over a point behind
second-place finisher Penn State. Although the Cardinal
outscored Penn State on every other event, they could not
make up the deficit incurred on vault. ,
Injuries on vault likely cost Stanford their qualifying spot.
When Tricase, Gentry, Sweets and Foley were all healthy at the
same meet (it only happened once, on Feb. 18 against UCLA),
Stanford scored a 49.0 on vault. Had the squad been healthy

No. 16 Stanford performed well on beam at Saturday's regionals, but a poor performance on the vault prevented the
Cardinal from qualifying for Nationals.
enough to duplicate that performance,
Stanford would have beaten Penn State
and qualified with a l()th and a half of a
point to spare.
Yim's debut on vault was Stanford's
one highlight on the event. After recu
perating from a ruptured Achilles? ten
don over the past nine months, Yim re
turned to the vault to score a 9.75 and tie
with junior Natalie Foley for 15th place.
Despite the team's low-scoring per
formance on vault, Stanford shined on
balance beam. Even without its injured
gymnasts, the team scored a season
high on the event of 49.0. Only UCLA
scored higher.
Stanford's mark is particularly im
pressive since sophomore Stacy Spran
do fell off the apparatus twice and scored
the lowest score of the meet, an 8.65.
Teams are often shaken when a gymnast
falls and Stanford had been no exception
to the rule this year. At the UCLA meet
in February, the Cardinal could not stop
a cycle of major mistakes and they
scored the lowest mark in Smyth's four
year tenure as a coach on the Farm.
This time, however, Stanford was
able to recover its focus. Two months of
mental toughness training on beam
paid off, as no gymnast other than
Sprando scored below a 9.75.
"[Freshman] Aimee Precourt was
after Stacy and stopped the bleeding as
we call it." Smyth said. "She looked
composed and confident, like a sea
soned veteran For her to step up
under that pressure as a freshman was
unbelievable."
Freshman Lauren Elmore led the
team with a personal best score of
9.9<). the team's second highest mark
on beam this season. She tied for third
place, a particularly remarkable feat
in light of the fact that she competed
first for the team, in a sport where
scores generally climb as more ath
letes compete.
"For our first person up, Lauren was
truly phenomenal," Smyth said. "She
was confident and aggressive; she
nailed her skills and stuck her dis
mount."
Stanford performed solidly on bars
with Yim and Foley taking third and
fourth, but it was short on athletes for
the floor exercise. Only five of a possi
ble six gymnasts were healthy enough
to compete, but the team still finished
in the middle of the pack with a 48.775.
All five of the gymnasts who did floor
also did the Ail-Around for Stanford.
The other teams at Regionals only
had two or three gymnasts in the Ail-
Around, an indicator of just how lim
ited Stanford was by its injuries.
"Regionals were a good way to end
a season filled with so much adversity,"
Smyth said. "So many freshmen got
great experience that they'll take with
them next year. It definitely lit a spark in
them and they are excited and motivat
ed for next year."
The team returned to the gym yes
terday. They will practice alongside
Yim for the next two weeks before tak
ing two weeks off and then starting
training once more.
"We're starting our quest for next
year's Nationals right now," Smyth
said.

in the middle of the pack with a 48.775.
All five of the gymnasts who did floor
also did the Ail-Around for Stanford.
The other teams at Regionals only
had two or three gymnasts in the Ail-
Around, an indicator of just how lim
ited Stanford was by its injuries.
"Regionals were a good way to end
a season filled with so much adversity,"
Smyth said. "So many freshmen got
great experience that they'll take with
them next year. It definitely lit a spark in
them and they are excited and motivat
ed for next year."
The team returned to the gym yes
terday. They will practice alongside
Yim for the next two weeks before tak
ing two weeks off and then starting
training once more.
"We're starting our quest for next
year's Nationals right now," Smyth
said.
"I can't wait for next year" was likely the thought running
through the head of every Stanford gymnast after the No. 16 Car
dinal (4-8,4-3 Pacific-10 Conference) failed to qualify to NCAA
Nationals this past weekend.
The team needed to place second at the West Regional on
Saturday in order to qualify, but it placed fourth with a 194.75 be
hind No. 2 UCLA, No. 11 Penn State and No. 24 Washington.
With help from its three Olympians, UCLA finished well ahead
of the pack with a 197.025. Only 0.625, however, separated the
Cardinal from second place and what would have been a five
year streak of qualifying to Nationals.
"The beauty of it, though, is that the entire squad returns next
year and three great incoming freshmen have signed letters of in
tent," head coach Kristen Smyth said. "We'll get this team
healthy and the future looks very bright."
The future of this season still looks bright for Tabitha Yim,
one of the team's six freshmen. The fourth-place finisher at
Olympic trials secured herself an individual bid to compete in
the All-Around at Nationals in Alabama from April 21 to 23.
She earned her spot by having one of the top two All-Around
scores excluding those posted by gymnasts on qualifying
teams.
Yim scored a 39.25 in her debut as an All-Around competitor
for the Cardinal, putting her in fifth place at Regionals behind
competitors from UCLA and Penn State. She will enter Nation
als as the top-seeded individual qualifier and has a good chance
to make a mark on the podium on beam and bars.
"It was unbelievable to see Tab perform as well as she did in
her first time competing All-Around in college," Smyth said.
"Her comeback [from a pre-season injury] was absolutely in
spiring."
At the beginning of the season, however, no one would have
guessed that Yim would be competing alone at Nationals. With a
preseason rank of No. 3, a third-place finish at Nationals last year,
and two freshmen coming off top-10 finishes at Olympic trials, the
team's sights were set on a national championship. The thought
of failing to qualify for nationals was hardly on the radar screen.
Injuries changed all that.
Freshmen Liz Tricase and Stephanie Gentry, along with ju
nior All-American Glyn Sweets, three of the team's best com
petitors, stood on the sidelines at Regionals due to respective
ankle, toe and foot injures.
Their presence was particularly missed on the vault, Stan
ford's weakest event of the evening. With only three of six
vaults having the requisite difficulty to start from a 10, Stanford
posted a mere 48.225. The score just edged out last-place fin
isher, No. 14 Central Michigan, and was over a point behind
second-place finisher Penn State. Although the Cardinal
outscored Penn State on every other event, they could not
make up the deficit incurred on vault. ,
Injuries on vault likely cost Stanford their qualifying spot.
When Tricase, Gentry, Sweets and Foley were all healthy at the
same meet (it only happened once, on Feb. 18 against UCLA),
Stanford scored a 49.0 on vault. Had the squad been healthy

No. 16 Stanford performed well on beam at Saturday's regionals, but a poor performance on the vault prevented the
Cardinal from qualifying for Nationals.
enough to duplicate that performance,
Stanford would have beaten Penn State
and qualified with a l()th and a half of a
point to spare.
Yim's debut on vault was Stanford's
one highlight on the event. After recu
perating from a ruptured Achilles? ten
don over the past nine months, Yim re
turned to the vault to score a 9.75 and tie
with junior Natalie Foley for 15th place.
Despite the team's low-scoring per
formance on vault, Stanford shined on
balance beam. Even without its injured
gymnasts, the team scored a season
high on the event of 49.0. Only UCLA
scored higher.
Stanford's mark is particularly im
pressive since sophomore Stacy Spran
do fell off the apparatus twice and scored
the lowest score of the meet, an 8.65.
Teams are often shaken when a gymnast
falls and Stanford had been no exception
to the rule this year. At the UCLA meet
in February, the Cardinal could not stop
a cycle of major mistakes and they
scored the lowest mark in Smyth's four
year tenure as a coach on the Farm.
This time, however, Stanford was
able to recover its focus. Two months of
mental toughness training on beam
paid off, as no gymnast other than
Sprando scored below a 9.75.
"[Freshman] Aimee Precourt was
after Stacy and stopped the bleeding as
we call it." Smyth said. "She looked
composed and confident, like a sea
soned veteran For her to step up
under that pressure as a freshman was
unbelievable."
Freshman Lauren Elmore led the
team with a personal best score of
9.9<). the team's second highest mark
on beam this season. She tied for third
place, a particularly remarkable feat
in light of the fact that she competed
first for the team, in a sport where
scores generally climb as more ath
letes compete.
"For our first person up, Lauren was
truly phenomenal," Smyth said. "She
was confident and aggressive; she
nailed her skills and stuck her dis
mount."
Stanford performed solidly on bars
with Yim and Foley taking third and
fourth, but it was short on athletes for
the floor exercise. Only five of a possi
ble six gymnasts were healthy enough
to compete, but the team still finished
in the middle of the pack with a 48.775.
All five of the gymnasts who did floor
also did the Ail-Around for Stanford.
