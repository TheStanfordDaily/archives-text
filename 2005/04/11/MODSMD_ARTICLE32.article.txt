# Fourth place ends season
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"I can't wait for next year" was likely the thought running
through the head of every Stanford gymnast after the No. 16 Car
dinal (4-8,4-3 Pacific-10 Conference) failed to qualify to NCAA
Nationals this past weekend.
The team needed to place second at the West Regional on
Saturday in order to qualify, but it placed fourth with a 194.75 be
hind No. 2 UCLA, No. 11 Penn State and No. 24 Washington.
With help from its three Olympians, UCLA finished well ahead
of the pack with a 197.025. Only 0.625, however, separated the
Cardinal from second place and what would have been a five
year streak of qualifying to Nationals.
"The beauty of it, though, is that the entire squad returns next
year and three great incoming freshmen have signed letters of in
tent," head coach Kristen Smyth said. "We'll get this team
healthy and the future looks very bright."
The future of this season still looks bright for Tabitha Yim,
one of the team's six freshmen. The fourth-place finisher at
Olympic trials secured herself an individual bid to compete in
the All-Around at Nationals in Alabama from April 21 to 23.
She earned her spot by having one of the top two All-Around
scores excluding those posted by gymnasts on qualifying
teams.
Yim scored a 39.25 in her debut as an All-Around competitor
for the Cardinal, putting her in fifth place at Regionals behind
competitors from UCLA and Penn State. She will enter Nation
als as the top-seeded individual qualifier and has a good chance
to make a mark on the podium on beam and bars.
"It was unbelievable to see Tab perform as well as she did in
her first time competing All-Around in college," Smyth said.
"Her comeback [from a pre-season injury] was absolutely in
spiring."
At the beginning of the season, however, no one would have
guessed that Yim would be competing alone at Nationals. With a
preseason rank of No. 3, a third-place finish at Nationals last year,
and two freshmen coming off top-10 finishes at Olympic trials, the
team's sights were set on a national championship. The thought
of failing to qualify for nationals was hardly on the radar screen.
Injuries changed all that.
Freshmen Liz Tricase and Stephanie Gentry, along with ju
nior All-American Glyn Sweets, three of the team's best com
petitors, stood on the sidelines at Regionals due to respective
ankle, toe and foot injures.
Their presence was particularly missed on the vault, Stan
ford's weakest event of the evening. With only three of six
vaults having the requisite difficulty to start from a 10, Stanford
posted a mere 48.225. The score just edged out last-place fin
isher, No. 14 Central Michigan, and was over a point behind
second-place finisher Penn State. Although the Cardinal
outscored Penn State on every other event, they could not
make up the deficit incurred on vault. ,
Injuries on vault likely cost Stanford their qualifying spot.
When Tricase, Gentry, Sweets and Foley were all healthy at the
same meet (it only happened once, on Feb. 18 against UCLA),
Stanford scored a 49.0 on vault. Had the squad been healthy

No. 16 Stanford performed well on beam at Saturday's regionals, but a poor performance on the vault prevented the
Cardinal from qualifying for Nationals.
