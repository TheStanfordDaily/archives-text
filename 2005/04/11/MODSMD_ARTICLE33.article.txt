The Cardinal knew they would he in tor a
long day after the team's Friday night game
against Oregon State was canceled due to
rain, setting up a Saturday doubleheader.
There wasn't a cloud in sight on Saturday,
but the No. 16 Beavers (26-5, 5-1 Pacific-10
Conference) poured on the runs and swept
the doubleheader on comeback wins of 9-7

Oregon State jumped out to a 5-0 lead after
two innings off of Stanford ace Mark Ro
manczuk (5-3). The junior lefty would go on

nings and allowing only two runs (one un
earned) the rest of the way.
The Cardinal got all five runs back in the
bottom of the fourth on a sacrifice fly by John
Hester and a two-out grand slam by junior
Chris Lewis, the first of his career and his fifth
home run this season. It was an especially
