# No. 10 Stanford blows two leads to drop series
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal knew they would he in tor a
long day after the team's Friday night game
against Oregon State was canceled due to
rain, setting up a Saturday doubleheader.
There wasn't a cloud in sight on Saturday,
but the No. 16 Beavers (26-5, 5-1 Pacific-10
Conference) poured on the runs and swept
the doubleheader on comeback wins of 9-7
and 11-10, making the seven hours of baseball

seem even longer than that for the No. 10 Car
dinal (19-11,4-2). The Beavers erased deficits
of 7-5 in the first game and 9-2 in the second.
But Stanford took a comeback win. 4-3. of
its own on Sunday, avoiding a series sweep by
picking up the winning run when junior Jed
Lowrie singled in sophomore Adam Sorgi in
the bottom of the seventh.
"There are a lot of teams [in the Pac-10]
who are capable of winning it, so if you get
swept, it's hard to overcome that," head
coach Mark Marquess said after the game.

" But when you get a chance to sweep, like we
did last weekend, that's huge, too."
The Cardinal hit the ball well for the sec
ond weekend in a row, but the team's pitch
ing and defense, usually its bread-and-butter,
faltered this weekend as the team allowed 24
runs and 39 hits over the weekend.
In the first game of Saturday's twin bill,
Oregon State jumped out to a 5-0 lead after
two innings off of Stanford ace Mark Ro
manczuk (5-3). The junior lefty would go on
to settle down after that, pitching 7 1/3 in

nings and allowing only two runs (one un
earned) the rest of the way.
The Cardinal got all five runs back in the
bottom of the fourth on a sacrifice fly by John
Hester and a two-out grand slam by junior
Chris Lewis, the first of his career and his fifth
home run this season. It was an especially
tough pill to swallow for Beaver pitcher Dal
las Buck because all four runs were unearned
after John Mayberry, Jr. had reached on an
error by shortstop Darwin Barney
earlier in the inning.
Junior Chris Minaker helped
Stanford to a 7-5 lead with a two-run
homer in the bottom of the seventh,
but the Cardinal defense failed to
hold it. Sophomore hurler Blake
Holler came on for Romanczuk in
the eighth and issued a bases-loaded
walk with two outs. Jacoby Ellsbury
drove in the tying and go-ahead runs
with a single through the right side,
and Oregon State added an insur
ance run in the ninth.
The Cardinal's pitching woes con
tinued in the second game as the team
failed to hold on after taking a 9-2 lead
in the third frame. Catcher John Hes
ter hit a two-run shot to left in the first
inning, and Stanford added six runs in
the third on five hits, highlighted by
two-run doubles by Mayberry and
freshman Michael Taylor.
But the Stanford pitching staff
could not hold the lead. Junior hurler
Jeff Gilmore (5-1), usually the most
dependable cog in the rotation, al
lowed seven runs and 12 hits in four
innings, including four in the top of
the fourth.
His replacement, sophomore Greg
Reynolds, took a 10-7 lead into the
top of the seventh but allowed four
runs in that inning, all of them coming
with two outs. With runners on first
and second. Reynolds gave up three
consecutive singles to allow three runs
that tied the game at 10.
Oregon State scored what proved
to be the winning run when Chris
Campos scored all the way from sec
ond tina wild pitch by freshman
Nolan Gallagher, who replaced
Reynolds. The pitch was a called third
strike and would have ended the in
ning. but it got by Hester.
The Cardinal redeemed them
selves in a pitcher's duel on Sunday.
Sophomore Matt Leva was shaky in
his fourth start of the year, scattering
10 hits over four innings but held Ore

gon State to three runs.
Stanford played effective smallball
on Sunday to outlast the Beavers.
Lowrie hit a sacrifice fly to center field
to score Sorgi in the first inning. The
Cardinal added two more runs on
sloppy plays by Oregon State in the
fourth. With the bases loaded and one
out, Lewis hit a slow roller that
skipped through the legs of Beaver
second baseman Ryan Gipson. A bat
ter later, Sorgi hit a chopper to short
that was bobbled by Barney, allowing

another run to score.
Holler (6-1) was sharp on Sunday
after taking the loss on Saturday,
pitching 3 2/3 scoreless innings to take
the win.
"It's always tough coming back on
a second day because you're more
tired." Holler said. "But when you
come back after a day like yesterday,
you have to make sure that you come
back with something extra, something
more than you had the day before."
With a runner on second and the

Cardinal leading 4-3 in the eighth.
Marquess decided to give a free pass
to Ellsbury and put the potential go
ahead run on first.
"We weren't going to give him a
chance to beat us again." Marquess
said.
The move paid off. Junior Matt
Manship came on and got Tyler Gra
ham to ground to Sorgi at third for the
final out of the inning. Manship
pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to earn his first
save of the season.

two-run doubles by Mayberry and
freshman Michael Taylor.
But the Stanford pitching staff
could not hold the lead. Junior hurler
Jeff Gilmore (5-1), usually the most
dependable cog in the rotation, al
lowed seven runs and 12 hits in four
innings, including four in the top of
the fourth.
His replacement, sophomore Greg
Reynolds, took a 10-7 lead into the
top of the seventh but allowed four
runs in that inning, all of them coming
with two outs. With runners on first
and second. Reynolds gave up three
consecutive singles to allow three runs
that tied the game at 10.
Oregon State scored what proved
to be the winning run when Chris
Campos scored all the way from sec
ond tina wild pitch by freshman
Nolan Gallagher, who replaced
Reynolds. The pitch was a called third
strike and would have ended the in
ning. but it got by Hester.
The Cardinal redeemed them
selves in a pitcher's duel on Sunday.
Sophomore Matt Leva was shaky in
his fourth start of the year, scattering
10 hits over four innings but held Ore

gon State to three runs.
Stanford played effective smallball
on Sunday to outlast the Beavers.
Lowrie hit a sacrifice fly to center field
to score Sorgi in the first inning. The
Cardinal added two more runs on
sloppy plays by Oregon State in the
fourth. With the bases loaded and one
out, Lewis hit a slow roller that
skipped through the legs of Beaver
second baseman Ryan Gipson. A bat
ter later, Sorgi hit a chopper to short
that was bobbled by Barney, allowing

another run to score.
Holler (6-1) was sharp on Sunday
after taking the loss on Saturday,
pitching 3 2/3 scoreless innings to take
the win.
"It's always tough coming back on
a second day because you're more
tired." Holler said. "But when you
come back after a day like yesterday,
you have to make sure that you come
back with something extra, something
more than you had the day before."
With a runner on second and the

Cardinal leading 4-3 in the eighth.
Marquess decided to give a free pass
to Ellsbury and put the potential go
ahead run on first.
"We weren't going to give him a
chance to beat us again." Marquess
said.
The move paid off. Junior Matt
Manship came on and got Tyler Gra
ham to ground to Sorgi at third for the
final out of the inning. Manship
pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to earn his first
save of the season.

Junior reliever Matt Manship helped the Cardinal hold off tfie Beavers in tfie third game of the series, picking up his
first save of the season.
The Cardinal knew they would he in tor a
long day after the team's Friday night game
against Oregon State was canceled due to
rain, setting up a Saturday doubleheader.
There wasn't a cloud in sight on Saturday,
but the No. 16 Beavers (26-5, 5-1 Pacific-10
Conference) poured on the runs and swept
the doubleheader on comeback wins of 9-7
and 11-10, making the seven hours of baseball

seem even longer than that for the No. 10 Car
dinal (19-11,4-2). The Beavers erased deficits
of 7-5 in the first game and 9-2 in the second.
But Stanford took a comeback win. 4-3. of
its own on Sunday, avoiding a series sweep by
picking up the winning run when junior Jed
Lowrie singled in sophomore Adam Sorgi in
the bottom of the seventh.
"There are a lot of teams [in the Pac-10]
who are capable of winning it, so if you get
swept, it's hard to overcome that," head
coach Mark Marquess said after the game.

" But when you get a chance to sweep, like we
did last weekend, that's huge, too."
The Cardinal hit the ball well for the sec
ond weekend in a row, but the team's pitch
ing and defense, usually its bread-and-butter,
faltered this weekend as the team allowed 24
runs and 39 hits over the weekend.
In the first game of Saturday's twin bill,
Oregon State jumped out to a 5-0 lead after
two innings off of Stanford ace Mark Ro
manczuk (5-3). The junior lefty would go on
to settle down after that, pitching 7 1/3 in

nings and allowing only two runs (one un
earned) the rest of the way.
The Cardinal got all five runs back in the
bottom of the fourth on a sacrifice fly by John
Hester and a two-out grand slam by junior
Chris Lewis, the first of his career and his fifth
home run this season. It was an especially
tough pill to swallow for Beaver pitcher Dal
las Buck because all four runs were unearned
after John Mayberry, Jr. had reached on an
error by shortstop Darwin Barney
earlier in the inning.
Junior Chris Minaker helped
Stanford to a 7-5 lead with a two-run
homer in the bottom of the seventh,
but the Cardinal defense failed to
hold it. Sophomore hurler Blake
Holler came on for Romanczuk in
the eighth and issued a bases-loaded
walk with two outs. Jacoby Ellsbury
drove in the tying and go-ahead runs
with a single through the right side,
and Oregon State added an insur
ance run in the ninth.
The Cardinal's pitching woes con
tinued in the second game as the team
failed to hold on after taking a 9-2 lead
in the third frame. Catcher John Hes
ter hit a two-run shot to left in the first
inning, and Stanford added six runs in
the third on five hits, highlighted by
two-run doubles by Mayberry and
freshman Michael Taylor.
But the Stanford pitching staff
could not hold the lead. Junior hurler
