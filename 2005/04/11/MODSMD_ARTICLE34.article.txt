# McCullough contains UW

### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
In the major leagues, you would almost never see a
pitcher throw 12 innings in a row. Even a complete game
is a rare occurrence. But for Stanford freshman Becky Mc-
Cullough, that's just another weekend of Softball on the
Farm.
After pitching all seven innings for No. 8 Stanford (28-
7,3-2 Pacific-10 Conference) in the first game against No.
20 Washington on Saturday, she took the circle less than
24 hours later, fresh and ready to go, opening the game
with a strikeout.
"Becky's been throwing our best lately," head coach
John Rittman said of the decision to start McCullough in
both games. "She kept them off balance yesterday and we
thought we were going to do the same thing this morning
until she ran out of gas."
McCullough pitched 4 1/3 innings Sunday before head
ing to the bench in line to pick up the win.
"It's pretty normal," McCullough said of the two starts.
"In summer ball, you always have to pitch two games in a
weekend. These games are a lot more intense, so more of
a mental challenge, but you get used to it."
The Cardinal recorded a 6-3 victory on Saturday, led by
the hot bat of freshman Michelle Smith, who continued to
lead the way in a 4-3 win on Sunday. A scheduled game
against UCLA was cancelled due to rain on Friday, but it
will be added to the two-game series in Los Angeles at the
end of the month.
The Cardinal got on the board right away Saturday,
with an RBI double by Smith early in the first inning. Se
nior Meghan Sickler kept things going with another dou
ble in the inning, scoring Smith and junior Lauren Lappin.
The Washington coaching staff decided to change
things up, pulling starting pitcher Ashley Boek (11-7) in
favor of Caitlin Noble (6-6). With no outs, Boek had been
tagged for three hits, three runs and two walks by the first
five hitters she faced.
