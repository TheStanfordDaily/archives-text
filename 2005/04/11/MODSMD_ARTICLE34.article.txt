# McCullough contains UW

### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
In the major leagues, you would almost never see a
pitcher throw 12 innings in a row. Even a complete game
is a rare occurrence. But for Stanford freshman Becky Mc-
Cullough, that's just another weekend of Softball on the
Farm.
After pitching all seven innings for No. 8 Stanford (28-
7,3-2 Pacific-10 Conference) in the first game against No.
20 Washington on Saturday, she took the circle less than
24 hours later, fresh and ready to go, opening the game
with a strikeout.
"Becky's been throwing our best lately," head coach
John Rittman said of the decision to start McCullough in
both games. "She kept them off balance yesterday and we
thought we were going to do the same thing this morning
until she ran out of gas."
McCullough pitched 4 1/3 innings Sunday before head
ing to the bench in line to pick up the win.
"It's pretty normal," McCullough said of the two starts.
"In summer ball, you always have to pitch two games in a
weekend. These games are a lot more intense, so more of
a mental challenge, but you get used to it."
The Cardinal recorded a 6-3 victory on Saturday, led by
the hot bat of freshman Michelle Smith, who continued to
lead the way in a 4-3 win on Sunday. A scheduled game
against UCLA was cancelled due to rain on Friday, but it
will be added to the two-game series in Los Angeles at the
end of the month.
The Cardinal got on the board right away Saturday,
with an RBI double by Smith early in the first inning. Se
nior Meghan Sickler kept things going with another dou
ble in the inning, scoring Smith and junior Lauren Lappin.
The Washington coaching staff decided to change
things up, pulling starting pitcher Ashley Boek (11-7) in
favor of Caitlin Noble (6-6). With no outs, Boek had been
tagged for three hits, three runs and two walks by the first
five hitters she faced.
Noble took control of the game fora while, quickly

No. 8 Stanford took down Washington twice this weekend. The match-up against defending
champions UCLA was rained out and will be rescheduled later this season.
ending the first inning with two
strikeouts and holding Stanford
scoreless for the next three innings.
While she was keeping the Cardi
nal offense silent in the circle. Noble
also did some damage in the batter's
box. She hit a three-run home run just
over the centerfield wall to tie the
game in the fourth inning. It was the
first home run of the rookie's colle
giate career and those in her person
al cheering section, 20 friends and
family members, went wild.
Smith broke the tie with a three
run blast, her 11th this season, in the
fifth inning. The ball sailed into the
hedge below the scoreboard, well be
yond the 220-foot outfield wall. Stan
ford would hold on to the three-run
lead, taking the first game of the se
ries by a score of 6-3.
McCullough (10-1) tallied the win
for the Cardinal, pitching the whole
game and giving up three runs on five
hits with five strikeouts.
Noble and McCullough both
started on Sunday, but while McCul
lough lasted into the fifth inning.
Noble faced only two batters in the
game. After giving up an extra base
on a wild pitch and a walk. Noble was
quickly bumped to designated hitter
and relieved by Boek.
Smith welcomed Boek to the
game by sending the first pitch she
saw out of the park, almost to the
scoreboard. Smith tallied three RBI
with the swing, her 12th homer of the
season and second three-run blast of
the weekend. Boek rebounded well
though, retiring three straight to end
the inning.
Senior Katherine Hoffman, who
came on to pinch run for Stanford in
the second inning, scored on a double
by sophomore Jackie Rinehart to
push Stanford's lead to 4-0.
The Huskies got on the board in
the fourth with a solo homer by Kris
ten Rivera that fell over the left field
wall, barely out of Rinehart's reach.

In the next inning. Ashley Charters
tallied an RBI double off McCul
lough, who left the game in the mid
dle of her 12th inning of work for the
weekend. Junior Laura Severson (12-
4) finished the game in the circle for
the Cardinal and earned her first save
of the season.
Severson got into trouble early,
giving up an RBI double to the first
batter she faced and loading the
bases with an intentional walk with
only one out. But with some clutch
pitching, she got herself out of that
jam, striking out one batter swinging
and one looking to strand all three
runners.
Neither team scored again and the
Cardinal came away with the 4-3 vic
tory. McCullough got the win, giving
up three runs on three hits, with three
strikeouts. Severson finished the
game with five strikeouts, a walk and
allowed only one hit. Though she only
faced two batters. Noble took the loss
for the Huskies, dropping to b-6 on the
season.
Smith led the way in the batter's
box, going 3-for-6 in the two games
with two home runs and 7 RBI. She
now has 12 homers and 32 RBI this
season and leads the team in both cat
egories.
"(Smith is) very capable of hitting
the long ball and she's been very
clutch for us all year," Rittman said.
"In this game you've got to have good
pitching, you've good to have good
defense, and you need timely hitting
and she's been really good at that this
year."
With the sweep, the Cardinal im
prove to 3-2 in the conference,
ixmncing back from two losses last
weekend to rejoin the conference
leaders in the standings.
"In our conference it really
doesn't matter," Rittman said. "Any
team is capable of beating you and
every game you play is going to be a
battle. That's something that our up
perclassmen arc very prepared for.
Our underclassmen are learning on
the run. But, this time of year, you
can't look at rankings, you can't look
at the past, you have to play one game
at a time."
