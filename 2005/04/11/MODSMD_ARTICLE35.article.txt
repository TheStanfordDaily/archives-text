# Stanford shuts out Pacific
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITER 
Facing a team just one spot out of
the playoffs, the No. 10 Cardinal (11-
12. 10-10 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) knew they had little
room for error.
So when they took the court
against No. 12 Pacific (12-16, 6-14)
last Friday, the Cardinal responded
to the Tigers' challenge with a deci
sive shutout.
Pacific, fighting for its postseason
lite, put in its host performance in its
past five matches. The Tigers out-hit
the Cardinal .343 to .305 and regis
tered 11.5 team blocks to Stanford's
five.
But it was not enough to over
come another strong Cardinal effort,
and the Tigers finished the season
winless against Stanford. The Cardi
nal won both of the two teams' pre
vious meetings 3-0, just as they did
this past weekend.
A major factor in the match was
service. Pacific had almost twice as
many service errors (20) as Stanford
(II). Hut when it came to service
aces, it was the Cardinal who had
double the number, registering six to
the Tigers' three.
Stanford started off on a strong
note, winning the first game, 30-27. It
was the widest margin of victory it
would see in what was to be a fierce
match.
In the second game, the Cardinal
climbed to an 11-4 lead when Pacific
suddenly kicked into gear. With the
Tigers struggling to even the match,
there were 15 tie scores and seven
lead changes.
Stanford only hit . IK9 in the
game, while Pacific hit .256. Howev
er, the Cardinal managed to score
points at the right time and when
they needed it most. The Tigers
came back from a six-point deficit to
foil a Stanford game-point. After
denying the Tigers three game-point
opportunities, the Cardinal then ral
lied to claim a 36-34 victory.
Although both teams improved
their hitting percentages in the third
and final game. Pacific still out-hit
Stanford, .433 to .371.
Refusing to let their playoff

hopes slip out of their hands, the
Tigers fought back to tie the game at
29-29. However, a service error fol
lowed by an attack error gave the
match to the Cardinal, as they
squeaked out a 31-29 victory.
Junior Chris Ahlfeldt led Stan
ford with 12 kills in the match and ju
nior Ben Reddy and senior David
Vogel both contributed II Senior
Kevin Hansen once again carried the

offense with 41 assists.
The Cardinal return home for
their final two games of the regular
season. They will face last year's
NCAA National Champions, No. 7
Brigham Young University (18-9,
13-7), in Maples Pavilion for hack
to-hack matches on Friday and Sat
urday.
