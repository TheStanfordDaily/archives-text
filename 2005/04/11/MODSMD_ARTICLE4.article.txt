# Kannokada and Okonkwo win election
## 
### CYNTHIA H. CHO EDITOR IN CHIEF 
When the result of the ASSU executive
election was announced on Friday, the 150 or
so students gathered in the CoHo began to
scan the room to find the winners. The
Avalanche of Diversity slate was there with
supporters including megaphone-equipped
members of The Chaparral and an inflatable
turkey displayed on stage. But it seemed as if
neither the Carr / Castillo slate nor the Kan
nokada / Okonkwo slate had shown up.
Within minutes, however, the victorious

Some surprised about election outcome

Melanie Kannokada and Aneto Okonkwo,
both juniors, made their way from the back of
the CoHo to the stage to greet friends and sup
porters.
Kannokada, who describes herself as a
"normally calm person," seemed to hold back
tears as she received hugs and shook hands.
"What did I tell you? What did I tell you?"
shouted one eager supporter as he approached
the ASSU president-elect.
But Kannokada would be the first to say
that she was shocked by the results.
"Everything that could have gone wrong
went wrong," she said of her campaign in an in
terview with The Stanford Daily following the
announcement. She listed the late delivery of
fliers and the failure to receive endorsements
from some student organizations — including
the Students of Color Coalition and The Daily
— as two things that did not work in her slate's
favor. Both Kannokada and Okonkwo admit
ted that before coming to the CoHo, they
thought that their chances of a victory were
slim.
However, no one seemed more shocked
than Victoria Carr. Surrounded by a dozen
supporters, the normally talkative junior re
mained silent and seated at a table while her
running mate, junior Fernando Castillo, stood
by. The silence, it seemed, was to maintain her
composure. When she told The Daily that she
would prefer not to be interviewed, her eyes
brimmed with tears. Castillo also chose not to
comment.
The Carr / Castillo slate had run a more vis
ible campaign — in White Plaza, for example,
the duo's posters greatly outnumbered those of
the Kannokada / Okonkwo slate — and while
no slate had a clear edge going into the two
days of voting, there had been some talk on
campus that Carr and Castillo would come out
on top. Among those who gathered to listen to
Elections Commissioner Troy Steinmetz, a
sophomore, announce the results of the elec
tion, there were more than a handful of stu
dents who seemed surprised by the outcome.
While Kannokada and Okonkwo were
being interviewed by The Daily, for example,
one student approached the pair and asked,
"How did you do it? I mean, did you get the
IFC [Interfraternity Council] vote?" The slate
had received official endorsements from both
the IFC and the Intersorority Council, as well

as the Jewish Leadership Council and Club
Sports.
Okonkwo said that while he and Kannoka
da had not received what some would say are
key endorsements, they received support from
smaller student groups whose leaders encour
aged members to vote. He also explained that
the pair ran a "grassroots" campaign that fo
cused on door-to-door outreach in order to

"Everything that
could have gone
wrong went
wrong."
— Melanie Kannokada,
reflecting on her campaign

"meet as many people as possible." And he
said that they "focused on getting out the grad
vote."
Though there is no way to determine which
get-out-the-vote strategies were successful and
which ones were not. the last tactic seemed to
have worked. A total of 1.021 graduate stu
dents voted in the executive race, whereas only
748 voted last year. Kannokada and Okonkwo
captured more graduate-student votes than did
Carr and Castillo; they also won more under
graduate-student votes.
ASSU Undergraduate Senate Chair Chris
Lin, a senior, said that voter turnout was higher
than that of last year. This year, a total of 5,096
people — 3,538 undergraduates and 1,558 grad
uate students — voted in the election overall, an
increase from last year, when 4,8% people —
3,572 undergraduates and 1,324 graduate stu
dents — voted.
The ASSU executive election, however, was
a different story. The total number of people
who voted for one of the three major slates last
year was 4,020. This year, that number was

3,995.
The executive election is conducted under
an instant runoff voting system in which the
winner must receive the majority rather than a
simple plurality (in a plurality election, a can
didate can win even if he or she receives less
than 50 percent of the vote).
All voters are asked to rank candidates in
order of preference. If one candidate receives
the majority of the votes in the first round, then
he or she is declared the winner. If not, the last
place candidate is eliminated and all of the bal
lots are counted again in a new round. Fora
voter who ranked the defeated candidate as his
or her first choice, the voter's second-choice
candidate is then counted instead. This process
— of eliminating last-place candidates and re
counting the ballots — continues until one
candidate receives the majority of the votes.
In round one of the executive race. Kan
nokada / Okonkwo received 1,757 votes. Carr
/ Castillo received 1.501 and Avalanche of Di
versity received 737. In the second round, with
Avalanche of Diversity out of the running,
Kannokada / Okonkwo received 2,008 votes
and Carr / Castillo received 1,724. Kannokada
/Okonkwo received the majority of the votes
(50.03 percent of all votes cast in the executive
election) in this round.
While there was no need to advance to an
other round, the Elections Commission ad
vanced to a third round to get an indication of
how many people had ranked Kannokada /
Okonkwo as any of their three choices, ac
cording to Lin and Steinmetz. In the third
round, Kannokada / Okonkwo received 3,019
votes.
Kannokada and Okonkwo will take office
on April 20. as long as the Senate or the Grad
uate Student Council do not invalidate the re
sults. But they have no plans to sit around and
relax for the next two weeks. Okonkwo, when
asked when he would start working, said,
"We've already been working." And when out
going Vice President Kory Vargas Caro, a ju
nior. approached Kannokada and Okonkwo to
offer his congratulations, Okonkwo said, with
a smile, "I'll be calling you a lot."
But the two did make some time to cele
brate on Friday night.
"Can we have the party in the office?" Kan
nokada said as she left the CoHo.
Which office? The ASSU office, of course.

vote."
Though there is no way to determine which
get-out-the-vote strategies were successful and
which ones were not. the last tactic seemed to
have worked. A total of 1.021 graduate stu
dents voted in the executive race, whereas only
748 voted last year. Kannokada and Okonkwo
captured more graduate-student votes than did
Carr and Castillo; they also won more under
graduate-student votes.
ASSU Undergraduate Senate Chair Chris
Lin, a senior, said that voter turnout was higher
than that of last year. This year, a total of 5,096
people — 3,538 undergraduates and 1,558 grad
uate students — voted in the election overall, an
increase from last year, when 4,8% people —
3,572 undergraduates and 1,324 graduate stu
dents — voted.
The ASSU executive election, however, was
a different story. The total number of people
who voted for one of the three major slates last
year was 4,020. This year, that number was

3,995.
The executive election is conducted under
an instant runoff voting system in which the
winner must receive the majority rather than a
simple plurality (in a plurality election, a can
didate can win even if he or she receives less
than 50 percent of the vote).
All voters are asked to rank candidates in
order of preference. If one candidate receives
the majority of the votes in the first round, then
he or she is declared the winner. If not, the last
place candidate is eliminated and all of the bal
lots are counted again in a new round. Fora
voter who ranked the defeated candidate as his
or her first choice, the voter's second-choice
candidate is then counted instead. This process
— of eliminating last-place candidates and re
counting the ballots — continues until one
candidate receives the majority of the votes.
In round one of the executive race. Kan
nokada / Okonkwo received 1,757 votes. Carr
/ Castillo received 1.501 and Avalanche of Di
versity received 737. In the second round, with
Avalanche of Diversity out of the running,
Kannokada / Okonkwo received 2,008 votes
and Carr / Castillo received 1,724. Kannokada
/Okonkwo received the majority of the votes
(50.03 percent of all votes cast in the executive
election) in this round.
While there was no need to advance to an
other round, the Elections Commission ad
vanced to a third round to get an indication of
how many people had ranked Kannokada /
Okonkwo as any of their three choices, ac
cording to Lin and Steinmetz. In the third
round, Kannokada / Okonkwo received 3,019
votes.
Kannokada and Okonkwo will take office
on April 20. as long as the Senate or the Grad
uate Student Council do not invalidate the re
sults. But they have no plans to sit around and
relax for the next two weeks. Okonkwo, when
asked when he would start working, said,
"We've already been working." And when out
going Vice President Kory Vargas Caro, a ju
nior. approached Kannokada and Okonkwo to
offer his congratulations, Okonkwo said, with
a smile, "I'll be calling you a lot."
But the two did make some time to cele
brate on Friday night.
"Can we have the party in the office?" Kan
nokada said as she left the CoHo.
Which office? The ASSU office, of course.
When the result of the ASSU executive
election was announced on Friday, the 150 or
so students gathered in the CoHo began to
scan the room to find the winners. The
Avalanche of Diversity slate was there with
supporters including megaphone-equipped
members of The Chaparral and an inflatable
turkey displayed on stage. But it seemed as if
neither the Carr / Castillo slate nor the Kan
nokada / Okonkwo slate had shown up.
Within minutes, however, the victorious

Some surprised about election outcome

Melanie Kannokada and Aneto Okonkwo,
both juniors, made their way from the back of
the CoHo to the stage to greet friends and sup
porters.
Kannokada, who describes herself as a
"normally calm person," seemed to hold back
tears as she received hugs and shook hands.
"What did I tell you? What did I tell you?"
shouted one eager supporter as he approached
the ASSU president-elect.
But Kannokada would be the first to say
that she was shocked by the results.
"Everything that could have gone wrong
went wrong," she said of her campaign in an in
terview with The Stanford Daily following the
announcement. She listed the late delivery of
fliers and the failure to receive endorsements
from some student organizations — including
the Students of Color Coalition and The Daily
— as two things that did not work in her slate's
favor. Both Kannokada and Okonkwo admit
ted that before coming to the CoHo, they
thought that their chances of a victory were
slim.
However, no one seemed more shocked
than Victoria Carr. Surrounded by a dozen
supporters, the normally talkative junior re
mained silent and seated at a table while her
running mate, junior Fernando Castillo, stood
by. The silence, it seemed, was to maintain her
composure. When she told The Daily that she
would prefer not to be interviewed, her eyes
brimmed with tears. Castillo also chose not to
comment.
The Carr / Castillo slate had run a more vis
ible campaign — in White Plaza, for example,
the duo's posters greatly outnumbered those of
the Kannokada / Okonkwo slate — and while
no slate had a clear edge going into the two
days of voting, there had been some talk on
campus that Carr and Castillo would come out
on top. Among those who gathered to listen to
Elections Commissioner Troy Steinmetz, a
sophomore, announce the results of the elec
tion, there were more than a handful of stu
dents who seemed surprised by the outcome.
While Kannokada and Okonkwo were
being interviewed by The Daily, for example,
one student approached the pair and asked,
"How did you do it? I mean, did you get the
IFC [Interfraternity Council] vote?" The slate
had received official endorsements from both
the IFC and the Intersorority Council, as well

as the Jewish Leadership Council and Club
Sports.
Okonkwo said that while he and Kannoka
da had not received what some would say are
key endorsements, they received support from
smaller student groups whose leaders encour
aged members to vote. He also explained that
the pair ran a "grassroots" campaign that fo
cused on door-to-door outreach in order to

"Everything that
could have gone
wrong went
wrong."
