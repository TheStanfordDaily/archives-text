# All undergrad groups pass for special fees
## 
### 
All of the joint and undergraduate student groups
that requested special fees were approved. ASSU
Senate Chair Chris Lin, a senior, said that there hasn't
been a time in recent memory that all undergraduate
groups passed. He also said that the ASSU Student
Activities Fee (a combination of both special and gen
eral fees) would be a little above $80 per quarter. The
exact figure will not be available until mid-May.
In all, six joint groups and 35 undergraduate
groups will receive special fees. The Stanford Axe
Committee received the fewest number of votes and
just barely passed with 50.73 percent support. Student
Initiated Courses and the Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center received the highest percentage of sup
port, at 83.75 percent and 83.67 percent, respectively.
The only student group that did not pass was
Stanford Club Sports for graduate students, which,
despite having received support from 67.6 percent
of those who voted, did not pass because it was not
endorsed by 15 percent of the graduate population.
