# All undergrad groups pass for special fees
## 
### 
All of the joint and undergraduate student groups
that requested special fees were approved. ASSU
Senate Chair Chris Lin, a senior, said that there hasn't
been a time in recent memory that all undergraduate
groups passed. He also said that the ASSU Student
Activities Fee (a combination of both special and gen
eral fees) would be a little above $80 per quarter. The
exact figure will not be available until mid-May.
In all, six joint groups and 35 undergraduate
groups will receive special fees. The Stanford Axe
Committee received the fewest number of votes and
just barely passed with 50.73 percent support. Student
Initiated Courses and the Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center received the highest percentage of sup
port, at 83.75 percent and 83.67 percent, respectively.
The only student group that did not pass was
Stanford Club Sports for graduate students, which,
despite having received support from 67.6 percent
of those who voted, did not pass because it was not
endorsed by 15 percent of the graduate population.
In order for any student group to receive special-fee

funding, it must receive support from
both the majority of voters and at
least 15 percent of the relevant stu
dent population. Stanford Club
Sports will receive special fees from
undergraduate students, and the
group will have the choice to charge
graduate students who want to partic
ipate in club sports an extra fee
though it does not have to.
"Frankly, I was disappointed-par
ticularly in the graduate voting on
Stanford Club Sports," Graduate Stu
dent Council Deputy Chair Roger
Stanley, a second-year business stu
dent, stated. "Anytime a measure has
the overwhelming support of voters,
but fails simply for lack of voters, it's a
loser not only for graduate students in
general but for the entire democratic
process."
"The turnout was actually higher
than last year's." he added. "I'm happy
that we had more voters, but only wish
we could've had the 271 more votes re
quired to enact the will of the graduate
population on Stanford Club Sports."
Dan Stringer, a junior, received the
most votes in the Undergraduate Sen
ate race. Freshman Kai Lukoff, who
received 650 votes, was the last candi
date to win a seat in the governing
body. The 15 people to receive the
most number of votes were elected;
there were 34 people listed on the bal

lot and there were 2 write-in candi
dates. Freshman Ryan Tracey re
ceived the fewest votes, 290. His poor
showing could have been a result of a
negative campaign that was launched
after he wrote a story in The Review
that criticized the Black Student
Union's finances. On Monday, April 4,
an e-mail sent to the Diaspora and Ser
vice4All e-mails lists read: "Vote
"NO" for Ryan Tracey."
Ballot Measure A, the initiative to
combine the programming and com
munity service components of the gen
eral fees fund, passed with 78.1 percent
of the vote. ASSU officers said they
hope this measure will grant them
greater flexibility when distributing
fees to student groups.
Advisory Referendum 1 asked stu
dents whether or not door-to-door distri
bution of publications should be allowed
unless a residence specifically decides to
opt-out. Though the referendum was
only advisory and will not affect the ban
on distributing off-campus advertising
and flyers, 52.9 percent of students voted
in favor of the opt-out system.
Advisory Referendum 2 asked stu
dents whether or not politically parti
san student groups should be allowed
to receive general-fees funding for
non-partisan activities, such as infor
mation sessions. While the results of
are non-binding, 64.3 percent of stu
dents voted no. that partisan student
group should not receive general fees.
