### PAMELA SUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Saturday afternoon, Wilbur Field glistened
with brightly-colored powder strewn across clothes,
faces and even hair. The rainbow-hued powder
fight celebrated Holi, the Hindu holiday that marks
the beginning of spring — known to many as "the
festival of colors."
"It was my first time celebrating Holi," said
sophomore Aarti Rao. a member of the Hindu Stu
dents Council executive board. "Celebrating for the
first time with Hindus and non-Hindus alike was
such a wonderful experience."
During the celebration, students threw powder
and water at one another, creating a montage of
greens, reds and yellows streaked across their bod
ies. Students arrived decked out in old clothes and
left covered head to toe in color.

members, it is the executive
board of eight that meets weekly
to organize campus-wide events
like the Holi festival.
The fliers promoting the event
— complete with the warning
"Dress for Mess" — attracted
more than 120 people over the
course of the afternoon. "I think
the music pulled a lot of people
in," said sophomore Deepa
Alagesan, president of the Hindu
Students Council."The goal of
this big event was to increase our
visibility on campus, especially to
non-Hindus."
Sophomore Hada Flores, a
non-Hindu who participated in
the festivities, said that "every
one was together, laughing and
playing. It was fun to experience

my first Hindu holiday."
In India, Holi celebrates the
coming of spring, good harvests
and the fertility of land. The ori
gins of the festival are ancient,
likely extending several centuries
before the birth of Jesus Christ.
Initially, it was performed as a
special rite by married women to
ensure the health and happiness
of their families.
The birth of the holiday has
been passed down in local legend
and folklore. The name Holi is
short for Holika, the mythologi
cal sister of an evil king who
wanted to be viewed as a deity.
When his son refused to see him
as more than a man. the king or
dered Holika, who was immune
to fire, to sit on a pyre with his
son on her lap so that he would be
burnt to death. But when the boy
chanted Vishnu's name Holika
was burned instead. Vishnu is
seen as the preserver of the uni
verse and represents mercy and

goodness. The festival mark's the
day of Holika's death and is used
to preach the idea that power
must be derived from religious
devotion.
The Hindu Students Council
also organizes various religious
ceremonies, or Pujas, throughout
the year. Currently, the group is
running a spring speaker series,
which most recently brought
Marma therapy healer Vaidya
Priyanka to campus to present on
Ayurveda, a medical practice
that has been followed in India
for millennia.
Next Sunday it will host a
panel on Kashmir moderated by
Ron Howard, professor of man
agement science and engineering.
He teaches a course entitled
"Voluntary Social Systems,"
which examines the structure of
societies that do not depend on
coercion to operate. Students in
the class discuss how to non-vio
lently change coercive systems.
