# Law school hosts tech conference
## 
### DAISY CHUNG 
More than 300 students and community members at
tended a day-long series of panels hosted on campus as part
of the first Bay Area Law School Technology Conference.
Saturday's event was a collaboration between students
from Stanford Law School, Berkeley's Boalt Law School,
the University of California's Hastings Law School and the
University of San Francisco Law School.
Nearly 60 panelists participated in a discussion on chang
ing laws in today's technology-driven society. The major is
sues were divided into four tracks: nanotechnology, fair use
policy in the 21st century, e-Democracy and international in
tellectual property.
Each of the law schools assembled three to four panels to
address the key questions within one of the tracks. Panel
topics ranged from "Out with the Hanging Chad, in with the
Black Box" to "What Nanotech Developments Are on the
Immediate Horizon?"
Panelists shared personal anecdotes, referred to scholar
ly literature and cited legal documents pertaining to the sub
jects at hand.
"The conference started because some people here
talked to their friends at other schools about a year ago," said
Stanford law student Steve Keane, the conference coordi-
nator. "We delegated most of the lo
gistical tasks to a small army of stu
dents from all four law schools, which
made it easier to reach a wide range of
speakers and experts."
Conference organizers received
financial assistance from Bay Area
law firms as well as student groups,
like ASSIJ Graduate Student Fund
ing and the Stanford Law School
Council.
"We're touching on things that are
nascent issues in law," said Yar

Chaikovsky, a lawyer from Weil, Got
shal and Manges, who spoke on the
panel "International Adoption of Free
and Open Source Software and its Im
plications for Worldwide Business."
"Open-sourcing is unknown and
hasn't been studied at length. We need
to pay more attention to it."
Chaikovsky said.
Students from all four law schools
attended the conference for various
reasons.
"It's a networking opportunity for
some people," said USF law student
Shoshana Francis. "You get to met
people who are at the top in their
field."
Patrick Tsao, a Bay Area resident
who is not involved in law, said, "I

came because I wanted to know how
the field ol nam (technology might play
out. It'ssonewthat no one knows right
now."
As for future conferences, all the
participating schools were eager to
make it an annual event.
Keane said the unofficial mission
statement of the coordinators was "to
bring together students and practition
ers to hear about these issues and con
sider he>w the law is changing as a result
of them."
Plans have been tentatively made
for Hastings Law School to host the
conference next year, and coordina
tors said they are confident that they
will continue to attract panelists and
funding.
