On April 12, 1977, The Daily re
viewed a highly-publicized musical
produced by the Soto dorm. While
the acting was less than professional,
enthusiastic actors made it a success.
Below is an excerpt:
"The dorm play or musical as a
genre of drama has several peculiar
characteristics: for its conception,
planning and execution, it draws
upon the resources of a random ag
gregate of individuals who have lit
tle in common beyond their resi
dence; for its production it draws
upon whatever talents, incongru
ously large or embarrassing small,
those individuals happen to possess,
and for its audience it draws upon a
captive and benevolent community
eager to avoid finding fault in gratu
itous diversion.
"It is scarcely fitting then, to eval
uate the success of any particular
dorm production in the same way
less random dramatic undertakings
are judged; rather, the sole appro
priate criterion for such an evalua
tion is the amount of entertainment
the play provided for all involved,
both actors and audience.
"On this basis, the Soto produc
tion of Damn Yankees earned four
stars from this reviewer.
"It was obvious from start to
finish that the high degree of en
thusiasm with which the beyond
capacity (yes, there were people
standing in the cold outside watch
ing the proceedings through the
curtains of the Soto lounge) Satur
day night audience responded was
a natural result of what must have
been an equally-high degree of en
thusiasm brought to the produc

tion by the participants.
"To observe that the voices of
Tom Pulliam (as Joe Hardy),
Karen Honey (as Meg Boyd) and
Amy Glick (as Lola) sometimes
took liberties with the songs of the
Adler and Ross while Mark Mur
ray (as Applegate) and Pulliam, in
particular, manifested a credible
acting ability is merely to affirm, as
stated above, that dorm plays call
upon various types and sizes of tal
ents.
"Since a lively pace is the best in
surance fora well-received dorm
production and director Jodi Ann
Corwin saw to it that the action
never lagged, the production was a
credit to all involved."
On April 12,1985, The Daily report
ed a new TV deal for PAC-10 sports
that would benefit Stanford. Below is
an excerpt:
"The Pacific 10 Conference?s
deal with Turner Broadcasting Sys
tem for live, prime-time broadcast
ing of football games will be worth
about $5 million to the conference
over the two years of the agreement.
Pac-10 Executive Director Tom
Hansen said yesterday.
"The money will be distributed
among conference teams 'accord
ing to a sharing formula that bene
fits more those teams which partic
ipate in the televised games,'
Hansen said.
"Hansen said that there was an
immediate indication of interest by
Turner's Super Station WTBS in
carrying other sports, such as bas
ketball."
