# Water in the Milk Bottle
## Toilet technology talks 
### DANIEL BERDICHEVSKY 
"Welcome to Taiwan," said the toilet, which
then broke out in birdsong.
My bathroom had become the Tiki-Tiki
room. I hesitated fora while before remember
ing why I was there — and flinched when the
trashcan to my right whirred loudly and opened
its own lid. The air then crackled behind me:
Some kind of dangerous deodorizing process, I
guessed. And that's when I fled.
At the time 1 was in Taipei fora spring break
exchange program at National Taiwan University.
While there I did my duty as an Innovation colum
nist. I visited a warren of side streets that sold gad
gets like Fry's Electronics gone mad, spread out
over 10 city blocks. I flew in jumbo jets, took tours
of high-tech chip manufacturing plants and even
met a professor of parapsychology (i.e. ESP).
Companies had karaoke rooms for their employ
ees; the coffee shops featured wireless Internet
and very good gelato. Vending machines served
hot sandwiches or — if you were in the mood for it
— a sports drink called "Pocari Sweat."
But nothing impressed me more than the toi
lets.
Mind you, I went to a high school where the
custodians were lucky if students remembered
what toilets were for and didn't rip them out of
the ground for sport.
So this, for me, was culture shock.
My very first night, I encountered a toilet with
a heated lid and a button marked "shower."
Against my better instincts I pressed it — then
jumped to my feet as hot water sprayed me
where I wasn't meant to be sprayed. It hit the
ceiling instead.
Since returning stateside, I've done a little re
search. It turns out my experience was far from
unique: An American diplomat at a function in
Japan once pressed the wrong toilet button and
ended up on his hands and knees trying to dry out
the bathroom before he caused a political incident.
I learned that Taiwan may be tops when it
comes to memory chips, but Japan is indis
putably the world's toilet leader. Some recent
Japanese units recognize whether someone is
standing over them, then lift and lower their lids
automatically for male visitors. Others take your
blood pressure and other vital signs, relaying
them directly to your doctor. (While I'm certain
this must be very useful, I'm not sure I'd want my
doctor knowing my bathroom habits.)
I even came across a press release about a
new toilet that includes a slot for SD memory,
the same format used in PDAs. MP3 players and
digital cameras. It was in Japanese, so I couldn't
make out precisely what the slot was for, but I
have my guesses: You can probably have the toi
let play whatever music makes you the most...
comfortable.
Japanese toilet technology is not all about com
fort; it can also be ecologically friendly. In 1988, a
top Japanese toilet manufacturer, Toto, released
the Otohime, a toilet accessory that simulates the
sound of running water. Its target audience: Peo
ple who are shy about others overhearing them
"powdering their noses" and so would ordinarily
flush the toilet an extra time for camouflage.
Toto estimated that a Japanese company with
4(M) female employees (who, their market stud
ies indicated, were more bathroom-shy) could
save 10 million liters of water per year by elimi
nating these unnecessary flushes. Market incen
tives triumphed, and the Otohime proved to be a
huge success.
Hoping to expand its clientele, Toto recently
introduced its Neorest toilet in the United
States. It is heated, offers both "shower" and
bidet functions and automatically deodorizes it
self. The last would be perfect for dorms, partic
ularly over the weekend. The cost, though, may
not win many fans in the University housing ser
vice: about $5,000 per toilet.
Japanese companies don't have a monopoly
on premium toilets. One American company
sells a model with lumbar support, drink holders
and a security system for keeping away unautho
rized users.
Even in the United States, I sometimes come
across a public toilet with a sterile plastic wrap
that rotates around the seat, along with a label
assuring me that the wrap is destroyed after each
use. Some more ambitious cities, including
Boston and Seattle, have installed self-cleaning
bathrooms in urban areas. The ones in Boston
charge a quarter and include space for advertise
ments to help recoup costs.
Most often, though, we're just stuck putting
flimsy covers on our very conventional toilet
seats and pretending that they actually block a
meaningful amount of the bacteria.
I've often heard that every new technology
can be benevolent or dangerous, depending on
how it is used, and toilets are no exception. One
had a label warning that "children, elderly per
sons and persons with sensitive skin are advised
not to sit long on the warmed seat" because it
might "cause low temperature burns."
Fortunately. I came through unscathed.
I can only imagine the luture. Toilets that re
ward children for good aim. Toilets that massage
you. Toilets with flat-screen entertainment units.
Toilets with attached sinks for brushing your
teeth. Toilets that weigh you — both before and
after.
The talking toilet in Taipei may not have had
nearly that many bells and whistles, but it
worked: I felt so welcomed in Taiwan that I'm
heading back in May. This time, I'm bringing
along plenty of bathroom reading.

Toilets were just the beginning; over spring break
Daniel also encountered three-way showers and
aggressive bathroom doors. To learn more, e

can be benevolent or dangerous, depending on
how it is used, and toilets are no exception. One
had a label warning that "children, elderly per
sons and persons with sensitive skin are advised
not to sit long on the warmed seat" because it
might "cause low temperature burns."
Fortunately. I came through unscathed.
I can only imagine the luture. Toilets that re
ward children for good aim. Toilets that massage
you. Toilets with flat-screen entertainment units.
Toilets with attached sinks for brushing your
teeth. Toilets that weigh you — both before and
after.
The talking toilet in Taipei may not have had
nearly that many bells and whistles, but it
worked: I felt so welcomed in Taiwan that I'm
heading back in May. This time, I'm bringing
along plenty of bathroom reading.

Toilets were just the beginning; over spring break
Daniel also encountered three-way showers and

"Welcome to Taiwan," said the toilet, which
then broke out in birdsong.
My bathroom had become the Tiki-Tiki
room. I hesitated fora while before remember
ing why I was there — and flinched when the
trashcan to my right whirred loudly and opened
its own lid. The air then crackled behind me:
Some kind of dangerous deodorizing process, I
guessed. And that's when I fled.
At the time 1 was in Taipei fora spring break
exchange program at National Taiwan University.
While there I did my duty as an Innovation colum
nist. I visited a warren of side streets that sold gad
gets like Fry's Electronics gone mad, spread out
over 10 city blocks. I flew in jumbo jets, took tours
of high-tech chip manufacturing plants and even
met a professor of parapsychology (i.e. ESP).
Companies had karaoke rooms for their employ
ees; the coffee shops featured wireless Internet
and very good gelato. Vending machines served
hot sandwiches or — if you were in the mood for it
— a sports drink called "Pocari Sweat."
But nothing impressed me more than the toi
lets.
Mind you, I went to a high school where the
custodians were lucky if students remembered
what toilets were for and didn't rip them out of
the ground for sport.
So this, for me, was culture shock.
My very first night, I encountered a toilet with
a heated lid and a button marked "shower."
Against my better instincts I pressed it — then
jumped to my feet as hot water sprayed me
where I wasn't meant to be sprayed. It hit the
ceiling instead.
Since returning stateside, I've done a little re
search. It turns out my experience was far from
unique: An American diplomat at a function in
Japan once pressed the wrong toilet button and
ended up on his hands and knees trying to dry out
the bathroom before he caused a political incident.
I learned that Taiwan may be tops when it
comes to memory chips, but Japan is indis
putably the world's toilet leader. Some recent
Japanese units recognize whether someone is
standing over them, then lift and lower their lids
automatically for male visitors. Others take your
blood pressure and other vital signs, relaying
them directly to your doctor. (While I'm certain
this must be very useful, I'm not sure I'd want my
doctor knowing my bathroom habits.)
I even came across a press release about a
new toilet that includes a slot for SD memory,
the same format used in PDAs. MP3 players and
digital cameras. It was in Japanese, so I couldn't
make out precisely what the slot was for, but I
have my guesses: You can probably have the toi
let play whatever music makes you the most...
comfortable.
Japanese toilet technology is not all about com
fort; it can also be ecologically friendly. In 1988, a
top Japanese toilet manufacturer, Toto, released
the Otohime, a toilet accessory that simulates the
sound of running water. Its target audience: Peo
ple who are shy about others overhearing them
"powdering their noses" and so would ordinarily
flush the toilet an extra time for camouflage.
Toto estimated that a Japanese company with
4(M) female employees (who, their market stud
ies indicated, were more bathroom-shy) could
save 10 million liters of water per year by elimi
nating these unnecessary flushes. Market incen
tives triumphed, and the Otohime proved to be a
huge success.
Hoping to expand its clientele, Toto recently
introduced its Neorest toilet in the United
States. It is heated, offers both "shower" and
bidet functions and automatically deodorizes it
self. The last would be perfect for dorms, partic
ularly over the weekend. The cost, though, may
not win many fans in the University housing ser
vice: about $5,000 per toilet.
Japanese companies don't have a monopoly
on premium toilets. One American company
sells a model with lumbar support, drink holders
and a security system for keeping away unautho
rized users.
Even in the United States, I sometimes come
across a public toilet with a sterile plastic wrap
that rotates around the seat, along with a label
assuring me that the wrap is destroyed after each
use. Some more ambitious cities, including
Boston and Seattle, have installed self-cleaning
bathrooms in urban areas. The ones in Boston
charge a quarter and include space for advertise
ments to help recoup costs.
Most often, though, we're just stuck putting
flimsy covers on our very conventional toilet
seats and pretending that they actually block a
meaningful amount of the bacteria.
