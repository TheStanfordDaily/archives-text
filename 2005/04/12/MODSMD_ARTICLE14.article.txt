## Stanford grad prepares to launch Discovery space shuttle 
### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
For many kids and adults alike, working
at NASA would be a dream come true. For
Kenneth Attocknie, Class of 19%, working
for one of the world's most innovative
space programs is a reality.
Attocknie, who majored in mechanical
engineering, is now preparing for the
launch of the Discovery Space Shuttle, the
first manned space flight since the
Columbia accident two years ago. Attock
nie works as an officer for the Thermal Op
erations and Resources division of the Mis
sion Control Center at the NASA Johnson
Space Center in Houston, Texas, and he
and is responsible for protecting sensitive
components of the Space Station from
thermal stress. When the Discovery Space
Shuttle launches on May 15 — taking its
31st voyage into space — Attocknie will
spend nine straight days working at Hous
ton monitoring the docking of the shuttle to
the International Space Station, specifical
ly monitoring heat-generating processes.
The Daily caught up with Attocknie re
cently in order to gain insight into the
preparation that goes into getting ready for
a space shuttle launch.
The Daily: How did you start working at
NASA?
Kenneth Attocknie: It was luck, really.
Right after graduation, I started working
with the U.S. Space Camp Foundation in
Moffet Field and met a lot of people. I start
ed talking to one person, and [he] put me in
touch with their supervisor, who put me in
touch with someone else .... It's really
funny how it all happened. It's always
something I wanted to do. It's definitely a
dream job.

TD: 1 m sure the words you'd least like to
hear are "Houston, we have a problem." I
imagine you must have gone through ex
tensive simulations to plan for every possi
ble system failure.
KA: We've gone through all types of
doomsday scenarios. They really prepare
us for that. It's a high-stress, high-pressure
environment; we all have to work together
to solve a problem. When we are working
real-time, it's actually kind of boring, as op
posed to the high-stress simulations. But
I'd take the boring anytime over an actual
problem.
TD: What is one worst-case scenario? How
would you deal with it?
KA: The Space Station is very integrated
— when we have a problem, it affects ev
eryone. For example, there are a lot of
micro-meteorites — space debris — that
hit the shuttle. In one scenario, a piece hits
the ammonia cooling lines, depleting my
ability to cool down the station. The fluid
leaking out also provides an additional
propulsion jet, so you have to compensate
for the propulsion force that could take the
shuttle out of orbit. If the shuttle is out of
orbit, the solar rays won't hit the panels at
the right angle and we won't be able to gen
erate enough power. The key is to priori
tize and deal with things in the right order.
You have to look at the big picture —
that's very critical in space station opera
tions.
TD: Because you can't physically go out
and fix the problem, how are you able to
correct these types of problems from the
ground?
