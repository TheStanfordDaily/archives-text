# A 						breeding ground for start-ups...

### ROSE JENKINS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If necessity is the mother of invention,
then Stanford students are masters at iden
tifying needs. The Bay Area is home to
many innovative new companies founded
by Stanford students and graduates — and
they're not just technical start-ups but also
social entrepreneurships.
One such student is senior Jeannette
Mellinger. who has been involved in Quest-
Bridge, a Palo Alto-based social venture,
since its founding in August 2003.
Mellinger, a human biology major, first
worked for Questßridge's parent program,
the Quest Scholars Program, an academic
summer enrichment program for under
privileged high school students held at Stan
ford. But the Quest program is restricted to
20 students per session, so when Quest or
ganizers began looking for ways to broaden
their impact, Mellinger got involved in ex
ploring and analyzing opportunities.
"We have a lot of donors who say about
the programs, 'Let's make more,'" she ex
plained. "If the whole point is to help the
kids, expanding makes sense, but it's hard
to scale up."
That's where Questßridge came in. It
uses the pool of highly-qualified applicants
to Quest to make matches between stu
dents and universities seeking to attract
precisely the kinds of low-income and mi
nority students applying to Quest.
"These are the kids that colleges want,
but they do a really bad job of recruiting
them." Mellinger said. "One thing we can
offer the colleges is that we have information
that they do not. We have a huge knowledge
base on how to attract these kids."
In a process that stretches from June to
December. Questßridge screens appli
cants and recommends particularly strong
candidates to participating colleges, such
as Duke. Cornell, Rice and Amherst. The
organization supports students by helping
them explore colleges and revise essays.
Participating colleges usually select two to
five students to whom they offer binding
admission and full-tuition scholarships.
Schools pay to be members of Quest-
Bridge's programs and pay additional fees
for each student that they accept.
"It's still so much cheaper than they
would have paid to find these students,"
Mellinger said. "Schools come on readily.
The only limiting factor is how much they
can offer for student scholarships."
Mellinger devotes a significant amount
of time to Questßridge, but she balances
her involvement with her studies by ob
taining academic credit for her work.
"The cool thing about this is that aca
demics is not all that's going on in your
life," Mellinger said. "By allowing it to be
part of my academic life, I've found it is re

warding to learn as you go."
Mellinger is not alone in seeking to make
a difference in the world through her work.
Corwin Hardham, a doctoral candidate
in mechanical engineering, first met the
four Massachusetts Institute of Technolo
gy graduates who started Squid Labs
thanks to a shared love for kite-sailing. The
original Squid Labs partners were teaching
a class on kite-building that Hardham at
tended. The workshop was right in line
with the philosophy of Squid Labs, which
opened in Emeryville last summer, since
many of its projects focus on enabling peo
ple to create their own things.
"One of the main goals is to teach peo
ple how to effectively build their own
stuff," Hardham said. "That's pretty huge.
That's one of the reasons why I joined.
Throughout my life I've built a lot of my
own stuff for kite and wind-sailing."
One of the early projects by the founders

of Squid Labs was the design and creation
of their own kites for kite-sailing. Since
commercially-produced kites are very ex
pensive, the team dissected them and built
them themselves. Then they posted direc
tions online in a project that Hardham de
scribes as "open-source kiting." The com
pany is still working on kites, designing
ones that allow them to virtually fly them
selves and stay steady in the face of wind.
Squid Labs has also developed a series of
one-page cartoons, called "Howtoons," that
teach kids how to build their own toys, such
as an air marshmallow shooter constructed
from plastic pipes. The idea is that kids
should be able to create things on their own,
even improvising on the books' designs.
"With a little bit supervision and a few
bucks, you can go to the hardware store
and have several days of entertainment,"
Hardham said.
The company is in the process of getting

these cartoons syndicated in newspapers
worldwide. In the meantime, they are de
veloping an online program that allows
adults to exchange how-to's on designing
and creating their own items.
Squid Labs is also venturing into the
healthcare field with a new corrective-vi
sion eyeglass technology that would allow
the individual production of glasses. In
jectable molds would allow small-scale
producers in developing nations to create
prescription glasses without the large
amount of equipment normally needed.
"The idea is to be able to bring prescrip
tion eyeglasses to one billion people who
need them but don't have any way of get
ting them." Hardham said. "The whole
group is very green, as far as we'd like work
on green technologies or things that might
bring about social good, if not environmen
tal good."
While Squid Labs addresses issues be
yond Stanford, other start-ups work closer
with issues faced by those still living on
campus. One such company is Addage, a
Web portal start-up founded by Mikey
Lee, a senior in communications.
Addage, which will launch a site called
Stanford Central within the next month,
serves small communities by tying together
listings, event calendars and other communi
cations tools in targeted Web sites. The idea
arose from addressing the needs of college
students, who are often bombarded with in
formation from a variety of mediums.
"The idea of Addage was spurred by a
need for reliable communication within a
very decentralized campus with students
who have short-attention spans, high-de
mands and too many things to keep track
of," Lee said.
Lee co-founded the company with Ryan
Brumberg, a first-year law student at Stan
ford, and is also working with a technology
team based in Seattle. Both of the co
founders have a lot of contacts among Stan
ford alumni, trustees, professors and current
students, all of whom have provided input on
planning and direction for the company.
Though the founding idea of Addage is
clearly derived from his experiences at
Stanford, Lee said that much of the busi
ness direction and technical design process
had also been formed through his personal
experiences.
"While I don't have as much of a techni
cal background, a lot of the social engineer
ing skills I have are based on my course
work and classes I've audited," Lee said.
In creating his start-up. Lee shares a line
of thinking with both Mellinger and Hard
ham. starting with a desire to improve so
cial conditions.
"Since I have a great passion for im
proving student life and since I have a drive
to get things done, I came up with what I
figured was the perfect solution," Lee said.

pensive, the team dissected them and built
them themselves. Then they posted direc
tions online in a project that Hardham de
scribes as "open-source kiting." The com
pany is still working on kites, designing
ones that allow them to virtually fly them
selves and stay steady in the face of wind.
Squid Labs has also developed a series of
one-page cartoons, called "Howtoons," that
teach kids how to build their own toys, such
as an air marshmallow shooter constructed
from plastic pipes. The idea is that kids
should be able to create things on their own,
even improvising on the books' designs.
"With a little bit supervision and a few
bucks, you can go to the hardware store
and have several days of entertainment,"
Hardham said.
The company is in the process of getting

these cartoons syndicated in newspapers
worldwide. In the meantime, they are de
veloping an online program that allows
adults to exchange how-to's on designing
and creating their own items.
Squid Labs is also venturing into the
healthcare field with a new corrective-vi
sion eyeglass technology that would allow
the individual production of glasses. In
jectable molds would allow small-scale
producers in developing nations to create
prescription glasses without the large
amount of equipment normally needed.
"The idea is to be able to bring prescrip
tion eyeglasses to one billion people who
need them but don't have any way of get
ting them." Hardham said. "The whole
group is very green, as far as we'd like work
on green technologies or things that might
bring about social good, if not environmen
tal good."
While Squid Labs addresses issues be
yond Stanford, other start-ups work closer
with issues faced by those still living on
campus. One such company is Addage, a
Web portal start-up founded by Mikey
Lee, a senior in communications.
Addage, which will launch a site called
Stanford Central within the next month,
serves small communities by tying together
listings, event calendars and other communi
cations tools in targeted Web sites. The idea
arose from addressing the needs of college
students, who are often bombarded with in
formation from a variety of mediums.
"The idea of Addage was spurred by a
need for reliable communication within a
very decentralized campus with students
who have short-attention spans, high-de
mands and too many things to keep track
of," Lee said.
Lee co-founded the company with Ryan
Brumberg, a first-year law student at Stan
ford, and is also working with a technology
team based in Seattle. Both of the co
founders have a lot of contacts among Stan
ford alumni, trustees, professors and current
students, all of whom have provided input on
planning and direction for the company.
Though the founding idea of Addage is
clearly derived from his experiences at
Stanford, Lee said that much of the busi
ness direction and technical design process
had also been formed through his personal
experiences.
"While I don't have as much of a techni
cal background, a lot of the social engineer
ing skills I have are based on my course
work and classes I've audited," Lee said.
In creating his start-up. Lee shares a line
of thinking with both Mellinger and Hard
ham. starting with a desire to improve so
cial conditions.
"Since I have a great passion for im
proving student life and since I have a drive
to get things done, I came up with what I
figured was the perfect solution," Lee said.

If necessity is the mother of invention,
then Stanford students are masters at iden
tifying needs. The Bay Area is home to
many innovative new companies founded
by Stanford students and graduates — and
they're not just technical start-ups but also
social entrepreneurships.
One such student is senior Jeannette
Mellinger. who has been involved in Quest-
Bridge, a Palo Alto-based social venture,
since its founding in August 2003.
Mellinger, a human biology major, first
worked for Questßridge's parent program,
the Quest Scholars Program, an academic
summer enrichment program for under
privileged high school students held at Stan
ford. But the Quest program is restricted to
20 students per session, so when Quest or
ganizers began looking for ways to broaden
their impact, Mellinger got involved in ex
ploring and analyzing opportunities.
"We have a lot of donors who say about
the programs, 'Let's make more,'" she ex
plained. "If the whole point is to help the
kids, expanding makes sense, but it's hard
to scale up."
That's where Questßridge came in. It
uses the pool of highly-qualified applicants
to Quest to make matches between stu
dents and universities seeking to attract
precisely the kinds of low-income and mi
nority students applying to Quest.
"These are the kids that colleges want,
but they do a really bad job of recruiting
them." Mellinger said. "One thing we can
offer the colleges is that we have information
that they do not. We have a huge knowledge
base on how to attract these kids."
In a process that stretches from June to
December. Questßridge screens appli
cants and recommends particularly strong
candidates to participating colleges, such
as Duke. Cornell, Rice and Amherst. The
organization supports students by helping
them explore colleges and revise essays.
Participating colleges usually select two to
five students to whom they offer binding
admission and full-tuition scholarships.
Schools pay to be members of Quest-
Bridge's programs and pay additional fees
for each student that they accept.
"It's still so much cheaper than they
would have paid to find these students,"
Mellinger said. "Schools come on readily.
The only limiting factor is how much they
can offer for student scholarships."
Mellinger devotes a significant amount
of time to Questßridge, but she balances
her involvement with her studies by ob
taining academic credit for her work.
"The cool thing about this is that aca
demics is not all that's going on in your
life," Mellinger said. "By allowing it to be
part of my academic life, I've found it is re

warding to learn as you go."
Mellinger is not alone in seeking to make
a difference in the world through her work.
Corwin Hardham, a doctoral candidate
in mechanical engineering, first met the
four Massachusetts Institute of Technolo
gy graduates who started Squid Labs
thanks to a shared love for kite-sailing. The
original Squid Labs partners were teaching
a class on kite-building that Hardham at
tended. The workshop was right in line
with the philosophy of Squid Labs, which
opened in Emeryville last summer, since
many of its projects focus on enabling peo
ple to create their own things.
"One of the main goals is to teach peo
ple how to effectively build their own
stuff," Hardham said. "That's pretty huge.
That's one of the reasons why I joined.
Throughout my life I've built a lot of my
own stuff for kite and wind-sailing."
