# Brian Mohr, come on down!
## Senior wins $10,000 on 'The Price is Right' 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
Brian Mohr, a senior psychology major and
resident assistant in Soto, doesn't have to
worry about scoring a paid summer job any
more. Yesterday, on a dorm excursion to see
"The Price is Right' in Los Angeles, Mohr won
$ 10.000 in addition to a set of cookware valued
at about $600
"I also got a lovely autographed picture of
Hob Barker," Mohr said.
The specific game that Mohr won — enti
tled the Grand Game — requires contestants
to choose four of six items commonly found in
a grocery store that he or she believes is under
$10. The contestant begins with $1 and the
prize money is multiplied by 10 for each cor
rect item chosen, up to $10,000. The game is
over if the contestant chooses one of the two
overpriced items.
"I chose gelatin, cleanser, adhesive and a
laxative remedy all in a row," Mohr said.
Mohr said he attributes his victory to "some
dude named Craig from San Luis Obispo,"
who he met in line while waiting to get into the
studio. Craig just happened to be a grocery
store clerk and Mohr looked to him for an
swers during the game.
"I think I was probably better at 'The Price
is Right' games when I was in elementary
school because I watched it so much, like when
I was home sick," Mohr said. I le added the fact
that he won was "lucky and awesome."
Mohr was lucky, indeed. He was among the
first players chosen from the audience to play
the bidding name in which various contestants

must estimate the price of an item on display.
The contestant with the closest guess is al
lowed to proceed to a more substantial on
stage game. Mohr won his second attempt at
the preliminary bidding game, which enabled
him to play the Grand Game. At the end of the

show, he got to compete for the grand prize in
the "Showcase Showdown," a bid-off between
the two top winners. Unfortunately. Mohr lost
this final test of bidding prowess.
Mohr said that he was sure to wear his
"Stanford Dad" sweatshirt to the show, both to
demonstrate Stanford pride and to humor his
current residents in Soto and his former resi
dents in Cedro, where he was an RA last year.
"I convinced my Cedro frosh last year that I
had a three-year-old son named Scotty," Mohr
said. "This will be Scotty's second time in The
Daily," he added with a chuckle.
Seventeen out of about 90 Soto residents
went on the "Price is Right" trip, Mohr said.
Each resident only had to pay $25 for the drive,
a night in a hotel and entrance to the show. The
expenses were subsidized by dorm funds.
While Mohr was the only Soto resident to
come home with winnings, the 17 residents said
they all felt that they were a part of the excite
ment. according to freshman Rohini Sankaran,
who claimed that she's going to be a "Bob
Barker Beauty" one day.
"We screamed for 30 minutes," Sankaran
said. "It was insane. I'm so tired."
She added that they all got a kick out of see
ing the "Price is Right" studio and Bob Barker
in person.
"We got in there and felt like we had en
tered into an LSD trip," Sankaran said.
"Everything looked like it was from the
19705."
When the taping of the show airs on April
29. Soto residents said they would host a dorm
wide viewing, complete with delicacies pre
pared using Mohr's new cookware.
Mohr said that although he told Bob Bark
er on air that he would use the $10,000 to pay
back student loans, he will probably spend it on
a new entertainment system or a cool trip.
"It will make fora good summer," Mohr
said.
