## Editorial "BCSC's expansion benefits the entire Stanford community" 
### 
University President John Hennessy and Provost
John Etchemendy recently pledged to match fundrais
ing efforts for the expansion of the Black Community
Services Center, or BCSC, up to a maximum of
$650,(XX).
We applaud them for this decision. The black com
munity needs more student space for its activities. The
current BCSC is too small for the number of students it
serves. The expanded BCSC will serve as a gathering
place for black students at Stanford and should
strengthen the black community.
But the expansion of the BCSC is a step forward not
just for the black community, but for the entire Stanford
community. It is an affirmation of the role that the black
community plays in developing a dynamic and vibrant
campus culture. Indeed, the community has organized a
wide range of programs that involve the entire student
body. We believe that the black community would ben
efit from the expanded space and increased support
from the University. This would lead to more programs,
reaching an even larger segment of the Stanford com
munity.
We strongly urge the black community to use the ex
panded BCSC to create programs that actively involve
students across campus. While there is a need fora focal

point on campus for the black community to rally
around, the BCSC should not be solely restricted to
members of that community. The role of this student
space should be to establish links between all Stanford
students regardless of ethnicity and to expose Stanford
students to broader issues of racial and ethnic diversity.
The BCSC could even consider opening their expanded
space to other ethnic groups who may occasionally re
quire larger venues for their programming needs.
We also hope that other ethnic communities will
take note of the success of the black community in fund
ing the expansion of the BCSC. They, too, can gain
some insight into the University's policies for funding
similar expansion initiatives. As such, we urge them to
explore similar opportunities.
At the same time, we are concerned that the expansion
of the BCSC might be seen as an easy way to justify the pro
posed relocation of Ujamaa. Certainly, expanding the
BCSC does address some of the concerns about lost activ
ity space. But moving Ujamaa to smaller premises in Flo
rence Mtxire Hall could still have a detrimental effect on
the black student life, and perhaps on campus life as a
whole. As such, University administrators should work
with community members to come to a consensus on this
controversial issue.
