# Tales of a 19th-grade nothing
## No one's looking at you 
### 
I don't work out at the gyms on cam
pus, especially Arrillaga. There are any
number of reasons: (1) there are stu
dents there and sometimes even (albeit
rarely) law students, and I (a) don't want
to see them during my time away from
school or (b) don't want them to see me
when I'm straining through my last set;
(2) many non-athlete students have no
idea what they're doing in the gym and
are consequently completely ignorant of

Glenn Truift

gym etiquette (e.g. the bench is not a place to sit and rest); and
(3) the Gym Nazis (spoken "weight room attendants") sent
around to make sure that you don't let any of your weights so
much as touch the floor are so unsettling as to nearly invali
date the endorphin rush that I'm there to get.
That said, there is one phenomenon that I was hoping
to escape from that may not be unique to Stanford. While
at the gym, I employ the universal sign language for"I
don't want to talk" or, as you may know them, head
phones. I'm not antisocial. 1 just want to get in and get out,
because 1 don't like the smell in the gym and I have other
things to do with my day (like catch up on my TiVo). I
probably spend a good bit of time scowling, although not
on purpose — lifting is a very personal and very visceral
experience for me. Once in a while, however, I will look up,
take in my surroundings and offer a smile or nod to fellow
fitness enthusiast as they pass by.
Now 1 don't think that I look particularly imposing or
smarmy at the gym. I wear a t-shirt, workout pants and
sneakers. No gloves, no gold chain and no tank top. I don't
have any sweatbands of any kind or visible tribal arm-band
tattoos. Regardless of all this, the same thing keeps hap
pening. When I walk by a young woman in the gym, re

gardless of her size, shape, fitness level or other physical
characteristic, I always get the same look from her. You
know, the one that looks like she's memorized the entire
local sex offender registry and she's just trying to match up
my picture. My theory is that girls practice this face in their
mirror while they're young and keep it as a weapon. What
I cannot figure out is why it gets directed at me.
I have a message for these women: no one's trying to look
at you! I'm certainly not. I didn't even say anything to you. The
fact that I tossed a little emotional charity your way does not
give you license to treat me like some cat-calling construction
worker who just whistled at you on your lunch break.
Now I firmly believe that a woman does not ask for cer
tain things simply by the way she dresses. Sexual assaults,
harassment and other crimes can never be blamed on what
someone wears, however, you can dress yourself into
being looked at. Not leered at, looked at. fight pink jazz
pants and a matching sports bra are your business, not
mine. But if I happen to glance at you below the neck when
you walk by as a result, that doesn't make me sexually de
viant nor — and this is important so pay attention — does
it mean that I want to sleep with you. I know that you're a
special little princess and that you are above being ogled by
the proletariat, but that's not me, and there are people at
the gym who are actually there to work out and not to look
at you, believe it or not. If you can't handle basic social
niceties without getting indignant, stay home or workout
somewhere far from my weight room. Either way, stop
with the look. You're just not that special.
