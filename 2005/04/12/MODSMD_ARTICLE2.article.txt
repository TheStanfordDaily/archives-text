# Law student collapses while running
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Between classes yesterday, many law
school students made trips to Stanford Hos
pital to visit classmate Steve Jones, who re
portedly collapsed while jogging Saturday
night.
Jones, a first-year law student from Las
Cruces, N.M., is recovering in the hospital's
intensive care unit. According to an e-mail
sent on Sunday to all law students from Larry
Kramer, dean of the Law School, Jones "was
without oxygen for some number of minutes"

after his collapse, the cause of which remains
unclear.
Yesterday, Jenifer Rajkumar, a fellow law
student, sent an e-mail to her classmates with
the good news that Jones had begun moving.
"He can squeeze a hand, can respond to
questions by nodding and is moving his arms
and legs around," she wrote after visiting
him. "His eyes are almost opening."
She added that Jones had started breath
ing on his own without the assistance of a res
pirator.
"We are still not sure what the prognosis
is, so keep thinking of him and wishing him a

complete and speedy recovery," she added in
the e-mail.
Craig Segall, one of Jones' classmates, vis
ited the hospital yesterday afternoon. He said
the news of Jones's collapse "was a real shock
for all of us." Steve's just this basically kind,
decent guy."
Segall described Jones as a "kind, decent
guy," and said Jones was"the major force be
hind organizing our section dinners. He
helped us get out of the Law School and get
to know each other socially. Most recently, he
helped put together the admit din
ners."
He added that in December Jones
planned and put together an elabo
rate holiday party for the section
members.
"He rented out a room in Rains,
got us all together there — he wore a
Santa hat," Segall said. "This is De
cember, so it's when we're all study
ing for exams. It's such a competitive
place generally, and Sieve's just not
about that at all."
Segall said the Law School com
munity has been doing everything it
can to support Jones and his family.
So many students have been visit
ing the hospital that Rajkumar wrote
in her e-mail. "The doctors say we
should keep down the amount of
stimulus he receives now, since he is

in the recovery phase. They say we
should stop visiting now and should
begin visiting again later (in a day or
a couple days maybe)."
She added that the incident has
really drawn the Law School class to
gether.
Cathy Glaze, the Law School's as
sociate dean of student affairs, has
also visited Jones in the hospital.
In an e-mail that Segall forwarded
to his classmates, Glaze wrote,
"Stanford is picking up the cost of
housing [for Jones's parents) and we
think we can do the airfare too. I un
derstand that people have been great
about taking food over to Steve's
mom at the hospital. It would be
wonderful if you kept that up, espe
cially because I am sure it does her
good to see his friends."
During lunch hours yesterday and
today, law student F'red Smith has
been manning the lounge in the Law
School with cards and pens.
"Those cards have been filling up
pretty fast," Segall said.
