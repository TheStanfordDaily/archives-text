## The 						truth about Nicaragua 
### GALEN THOMPSON 
After returning from a profound
ly humanizing and validating trip to
Condega, Nicaragua — through a
spring break trip organized by the
American Jewish World Service — I
feel a moral imperative to respond to
"Old Foe of U.S. Trying fora Come
back in Nicaragua," an article in The
New York Times by Ginger Thomp
son (April 5).
Thompson wrote something that
is absolutely true: "Nicaragua was
once as much the epicenter of United
States foreign policy as Iraq is today."
However there is an important dis
tinction between these two cases. In
Iraq, the United States chose to inter
vene against a regime widely held as a
dictatorship. In Nicaragua, the Unit
ed States backed the Somoza govern
ment, which used the National Guard
to brutally murder thousands of
Nicaraguan citizens. The Sandinistas
organized a very popular rebellion
which overthrew and expelled the
Samoza regime.
Samoza left Nicaragua $1.5 bil
lion in debt, and, concurrently, the
United States engaged in an illegal
campaign to stop the Sandinistas.
The Contras Thompson mentioned
were not just "rebels armed and or
ganized by the U.S." They were
Honduran, Salvadoran and Costa
Rican mercenary groups, along with
members of Samoza's old National
Guard, illegally funded by the CIA
against the will of the U.S. Congress.
According to everyone we talked to
in Condega, a city just south of the
Honduras border, the Contras were
active and violent. The United States
also mined harbors and ports and

disrupted commerce, leading to a
suit filed by Nicaragua in the Inter
national Court of Justice, or ICJ, for
violation of sovereignty. After the
ICJ ruled in favor of Nicaragua, the
United States set an international
precedent by pulling out of the court.
During this time, the Sandinistas
were forced to spend half of the
Gross Domestic Product on defense
against the onslaught. Yet they still
managed to make healthcare and ed
ucation completely free and widely
accessible, build 52 new hospitals
and cut infant mortality in half. The
Sandinistas were not perfect for
many reasons, but they were chosen
by the Nicaraguans who died to
overthrow Samoza. They provided
for the people, and the people I
spoke to cared far more about basic
human rights than ideological titles.
The United States and Thomp
son in particular are revisiting all the
old bad words the U.S. administra
tion used against the Sandinistas and
Daniel Ortega in the "Marx
ist," "revolutionary strongmen,"
"entrenched leader," "coman
dante." And to incite American citi
zens with a modern vocabulary of
fear, there are some new bad words
being applied to Nicaragua, "Axis of
Evil" with Venezuela and Cuba,
"war on terror" and "Al-Oaeda."
This rhetoric was once successful at
painting an evil picture of Nicaragua
and the Sandinistas, and it worked in
rallying enough public support for
intervention in Iraq and
Afghanistan. There is no leftist army
waiting for Ortega to lead them in at
tacks on the United States. Ortega
lost the last election for one reason,
which we heard again and again.

Nicaragua is tired of fighting, and
they are tired of drawing attention
from the United States.
A war-torn and bleeding
Nicaragua did not elect Ortega in
1987. From the revolution in 1979
until that election, the United States
ensured that the fighting never
stopped in Nicaragua. As Thompson
pointed out, Ortega is marked with
war. However, it is not our job to
make the decision for the
Nicaraguan people. How can
democracy ever be integrated into
all aspects of society if the United
States dictates and limits people's
choices? The Sandinistas were once
popular and are still, only as far as
they provide for the basic needs of
the people. The United States can
not represent the people of
Nicaragua, and if Nicaragua decides
Ortega can, that is not our business.
The United States does have one
key role in Nicaragua politics and
economics. According to one woman
in Condega, the disruption of the
economy during the Contra period
put Nicaragua 250 years behind the
United States. The ICJ agreed that
we acted illegally and violated the
sovereignty of Nicaragua. We should
not respond by repeating history, we
should instead pay up old debts and
aid in any way possible whoever
Nicaragua picks to lead. Salman
Rushdie, in his book "The Jaguar
Smile," writes it well: "One didn't
have to like the people [Sandinistas]
to believe in their right not to be
squashed by the United States."
