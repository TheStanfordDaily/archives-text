Daily editorial makes logical
and factual errors
The Daily editorial "Conserva
tives deserve a better paper than The
Review" (April 8) fails to make its
case. The Daily offers no evidence to
substantiate its claim that The Re
view was guilty of printing unsub
stantiated statements. For the 19th
year in a row. The Review has fairly
investigated some aspect of campus
politics and sparked debate and in
terest among students in accordance
with our mission.
The Review was entirely fair in its
presentation of the Black Student
Union's connections to the ASSU.
Our Special Election Edition fea
tured BSU Co-Chair Michael
Brown's perspective on the back
page â€” the second-most prominent
part of our newspaper. We deter
mined this would onlv be fair, given

that the issue was our last before the
ASSU election.
The Daily's call for articles based
on "logic and substantiated facts" is
ironic considering their glaring non
sequitur. The editorial suggests that
many moderately conservative stu
dents are embarrassed by our news
paper because the Stanford College
Republicans club is larger than the
contributing staff of The Review.
This conclusion simply does not log
ically follow. If the conclusion were
true, 1 challenge those conservatives
who want to engage with ideas to
join The Review and make the paper
better.
In addition to this logical error.
The Daily made an egregious factual
error when it claimed that The Re
view receives "exorbitant funding"
from our co-founder Peter Thiel. He
does not fund The Review at all. If
The Daily were interested in double

checking its own facts, it would have
asked me. Before The Daily admon
ishes The Review about accuracy, I
suggest it put its own house in order.
