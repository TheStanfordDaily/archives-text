## Soto Tape Chronicles Jordi ponders hockey's absence 
### 
The neighborhood surrounding the HP
Pavilion in San Jose is a sad scene of run
down bars that have old hockey murals
painted on the walls and tattered Sharks flags
hanging in the windows. The panorama is repre
sentative of the current state of the NHL, which
will return to action with blue ice and digital-age
gimmicks, but will struggle to overcome the gen
eral apathy that plagued it in recent seasons.
1 walked through those no-named streets Sat
urday night on my way to the U2 concert. Behind
the limousines and glamorous concert-goers, for
gotten hockey fans looked out over their tall cups
of Molson and Bud Ice through the dirty tinted
windows at the brightness outside.
The glow outside wasn't sunshine and it
wasn't the gloomy yellow of hanging lamps in a
dusty saloon. It was anticipation and excitement

on the (aces of fans mixed with
the neon lights of the mega
marquee advertising in the sky.
Hockey used to be that way.
There used to be hope and ex
citement. In small towns up
north and across the border
hockey was the center of life
because people played the
game. Look at the photos of
children in the Dominican Re-

public playing stickball in the streets if you ever
wonder why professional baseball is such a hit
there.
In places where real winter strikes early and
heavily, kids lace up their skates and go out to the
frozen pond to whack a puck around. It's idyllic
and inspiring, but the NHL has somehow failed
to build on this homegrown love of the game.
Over the past decade, teams from Minnesota,
Quebec, Winnipeg and Hartford have been re
placed with flashy alternatives in Miami, Tampa,
Phoenix, Atlanta, Carolina, Nashville and Dal
las. Expansion has wrested the sport from the
places where it flourished, and poor financial
management has eliminated it from the public's
consciousness.
(I'll to come down off of my soapbox now.
You can tell that I'm suffering from a bit of a
Bono complex.)
The U2 concert reminded me of how hockey
used to be. There was a guy in the parking lot who
had driven his beat-up black van with neon "Sa
cred Dice" decals on the windows all the way to
San Jose in the hope of finding last-minute tick
ets. He was lucky enough to meet Bono that af
ternoon when the rock star was signing auto
graphs for fans waiting in line. He told Bono that
Pop Mart was brilliant, no matter what the ex
perts said, and Bono replied that that was the
smartest thing he'd heard all day. The guy gave
Bono a mix CD he had made for the occasion,
and I know that even if he didn't get in to the con
cert, the little exchange made the entire trip
worthwhile.
Hockey was once like that. Pittsburghers feel
the same way about Mario Lemieux as the Sa
cred Dice guy did about Bono. On game days, the
parking lots near the Civic Arena - a neighbor
hood that reminds me a lot of the one in San Jose
- are full of grown men in their Penguins jerseys
and hats who would undoubtedly give up every
thing just to skate with Mario for an afternoon.
What will hockey need if it hopes to come
back and restore the dreams that so many fans
have put on hold? Maybe the NHL could learn
some lessons from U2.
The NHL needs a flag-bearing hero much like
U2 needs Bono. The rest of the band is certainly
indispensable, but it is Bono's public persona and
stage presence that sets the group apart. Without
Bono on the catwalk crooning into the crowd, a
live concert wouldn't be the same.
In the same way, the NHL has to find replace
ments for the inimitable Mario, Wayne Gretzky
and Steve Yzerman. Hockey needs new players
with new names who will recapture the imagina
tion of fans with lightning moves and unbeliev-

able goals. Hockey needs players that
can rock packed arenas and give fans
something to buzz about.
The NHL also needs a new song to
sell to fans. The new U2 album rocks
hard like "Achtung Baby" and other
great records of the past. Music fans
love the fact that the band has not for
gotten the roots that made the music
great.
Similarly, the soul of hockey is still

alive and thriving. Just watch the
NCAA Frozen Four to see kids that
play hard and fans that cheer like it's
the end of the world. The NHL needs
to celebrate this love of the game and
put a new product on the ice that
shines brightly without letting go of
the tough, frozen pond mentality that
underlies the game.
There is hope for hockey. U2 will
be back in November with their star
power and adoring fans. Hopefully
we'll be able to say the same about
the NHL.
