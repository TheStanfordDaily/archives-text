# Cardinal clinch Pacific-10 title
## 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After weeks of doubting the
strength of its doubles lineup, the
No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team
(19-0, 11-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
was in fora pleasant surprise this
weekend. The top-ranked Cardinal
unexpectedly clinched the doubles
point against No. 3 Southern Cali
fornia (16-2,7-1) and No. 11 UCLA
(13-5,6-2) to pull out two tight wins,
4-3 and 5-2, respectively.
The Pac-10 league title was at
stake at Marks Tennis Center on Fri
day, as the Trojans took the court
against the only team that has beat
en them all season.
Members of both teams held
their breath as two of the Trojans'
top three singles players shook off
early upsets to get the best of Stan
ford's No. 9 Amber Liu (13-3, 7-3)
and No. 45 Theresa Logar in three
sets.
Ranked right behind two-time
defending NCAA Singles Champi
on Liu at No. 10, freshman Nicole
Leimbach proved her own mettle,
causing Liu to sacrifice a 6-0 sweep
in the first set and a tiebreaker in the
second to finally topple, 0-6,7-6,6-3.
Logar (21-3), a sophomore, came
up short in a closer three-set battle
with Anca Anastasiu at No. 3 sin
gles, 5-7,7-6,6-1.
The Trojans' Lindsey Nelson,
meanwhile, had already topped
Alice Barnes in doubles and carried
the momentum over to singles. Nel
son cruised to a 6-4,6-1 victory over
the Stanford junior.
With the fate of the match resting
squarely on the shoulders of Stan
ford freshman Whitney Deason (26-
3), all eyes were on court 4 as No. 51
Deason pried the conference title
from Diane Matias' hands, 3-6, 6-2,
7-5.
The Cardinal captured its 18th
consecutive Pac-10 title on Friday
and steeled itself against a feisty
Bruins lineup on Saturday.
But what already constituted an
epic weekend for the undefeated
team was even more monumental in
the glaring absence of No. 20 senior
Erin Burdette.

Burdette, named to the ITA Na
tional Doubles Team of the Year in
2004 with former partner Lauren
Barnikow, was stifled by a persistent
shoulder injury and sat out from
match play all weekend.
"When you take your most expe
rienced doubles player out of the
mix, [and] you're playing the two
toughest [opponents] in the confer
ence, it's going to be a completely
different situation," said Stanford
head coach Lele Forood. "Given the
uncertainty over whether Erin
would be able to play this weekend,
I think we did an outstanding job to
come out this weekend with two
wins."
In light of the setback, Stanford's
quick adjustments and recovery
showed that the team's resilience
only reinforces its already daunting
record.
Liu and sophomore Anne Yelsey
led gracefully at the doubles helm,
posting a decisive 8-4 victory over
Matias and Leimbach.
On Saturday, the No. 29 duo kept
their cool as they edged No. 2
Daniela Bercek and Riza Zalameda
in a tiebreak, 9-8 (5).
Putting the Cardinal-Bruins
showdown in perspective, Yelsey
and freshman standout Zalameda
were doubles partners in the junior
circuit, where they secured a spot in
the U.S. Open main dr§w in 2002.
At No. 2 doubles, junior Alice
Barnes took on Logar as a new part
ner. As expected, it took some time
for Barnes and Logar to get used to
each other's styles of play.
Logar and Barnes dropped an 8-6
decision to Nelson and Carine Ver
meulen on Friday, but bounced back
to win 8-4 against UCLA's Laura
Gordon and Alex McGoodwin.
"Our goal in the switch-ups was
to break up as few teams as possi
ble," Forood said. "I was really
proud to see Amber and Anne go 2-
0 for the weekend. Also, Alice is an
experienced doubles player, and
Theresa can certainly play. After
facing a strong team on Friday, they
were that much better on Satur
day."

Freshman standout Lejla Hodzic split her doubles contests over the weekend with partner Whitney Dea
son, defeating USC but falling to UCLA. The Cardinal won both team matches.
Rounding out the doubles lineup.
Deason and freshman Lejla Hodzic
continued their trend of close
matches and last-minute come
backs, surviving one 9-7 decision
against the Trojans' Anastasiu and
Taylynn Snyder but dropping anoth
er to UCLA.
These results are nearly identical
to when Stanford hosted the two
schools in late February. The Bru
ins' Sarah Gregg and Tracy Lin have
now troubled Stanford's No. 3 duo
twice this season, while the Trojans
switched in a new No. 3 team in a
foiled attempt to claim the doubles
point.
Going into the match, Stanford
assistant coach Frankie Brennan
conveyed an optimistic ambivalence
about the freshmen's prospects.
"When they're on. Whitney and
Lejla play like a top-20 team," Bren
nan said. "But it's still a learning ex
perience for them. While we'd like
them to get back to making more

strong starts, mounting those late
comebacks can be a great asset for
NCAA nationals."
Turning to singles, Barnes,
Logar, and Deason all hedged their
losses against UCLA, posting a
string of straight-set victories.
No. 29 Barnes sealed Saturday's
match by downing No. 23 Zalameda,
6-4.6-2.
Before heading into the home
matches against No. 33 Arizona
State and Arizona earlier this
month, team captain Barnes had ex
pressed concern over the team's un
lettered success.
"My only main worry for the
team would be complacency,"
Barnes said. "But I think we have
worked too hard to have that be a
factor. We know that these other
teams are working and that they
want the title as much as we do."
Barnes' words may have proved
prophetic, but with lingering doubt
over the league title cleared up,
Stanford can afford to breathe a lit
tle easier before NCAAs next
month.

son, defeating USC but falling to UCLA. The Cardinal won both team matches.
Rounding out the doubles lineup.
Deason and freshman Lejla Hodzic
continued their trend of close
matches and last-minute come
backs, surviving one 9-7 decision
against the Trojans' Anastasiu and
Taylynn Snyder but dropping anoth
er to UCLA.
These results are nearly identical
to when Stanford hosted the two
schools in late February. The Bru
ins' Sarah Gregg and Tracy Lin have
now troubled Stanford's No. 3 duo
twice this season, while the Trojans
switched in a new No. 3 team in a
foiled attempt to claim the doubles
point.
Going into the match, Stanford
assistant coach Frankie Brennan
conveyed an optimistic ambivalence
about the freshmen's prospects.
"When they're on. Whitney and
Lejla play like a top-20 team," Bren
nan said. "But it's still a learning ex
perience for them. While we'd like
them to get back to making more

strong starts, mounting those late
comebacks can be a great asset for
NCAA nationals."
Turning to singles, Barnes,
Logar, and Deason all hedged their
losses against UCLA, posting a
string of straight-set victories.
No. 29 Barnes sealed Saturday's
match by downing No. 23 Zalameda,
6-4.6-2.
Before heading into the home
matches against No. 33 Arizona
State and Arizona earlier this
month, team captain Barnes had ex
pressed concern over the team's un
lettered success.
"My only main worry for the
team would be complacency,"
Barnes said. "But I think we have
worked too hard to have that be a
factor. We know that these other
teams are working and that they
want the title as much as we do."
Barnes' words may have proved
prophetic, but with lingering doubt
over the league title cleared up,
Stanford can afford to breathe a lit
tle easier before NCAAs next
month.
The Cardinal face Cal Poly (8-8)
Thursday at 1:30 p.m. atTaube Fam
ily Tennis Stadium.
After weeks of doubting the
strength of its doubles lineup, the
No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team
(19-0, 11-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
was in fora pleasant surprise this
weekend. The top-ranked Cardinal
unexpectedly clinched the doubles
point against No. 3 Southern Cali
fornia (16-2,7-1) and No. 11 UCLA
(13-5,6-2) to pull out two tight wins,
4-3 and 5-2, respectively.
The Pac-10 league title was at
stake at Marks Tennis Center on Fri
day, as the Trojans took the court
against the only team that has beat
en them all season.
Members of both teams held
their breath as two of the Trojans'
top three singles players shook off
early upsets to get the best of Stan
ford's No. 9 Amber Liu (13-3, 7-3)
and No. 45 Theresa Logar in three
sets.
Ranked right behind two-time
defending NCAA Singles Champi
on Liu at No. 10, freshman Nicole
Leimbach proved her own mettle,
causing Liu to sacrifice a 6-0 sweep
in the first set and a tiebreaker in the
second to finally topple, 0-6,7-6,6-3.
Logar (21-3), a sophomore, came
up short in a closer three-set battle
with Anca Anastasiu at No. 3 sin
gles, 5-7,7-6,6-1.
The Trojans' Lindsey Nelson,
meanwhile, had already topped
Alice Barnes in doubles and carried
the momentum over to singles. Nel
son cruised to a 6-4,6-1 victory over
the Stanford junior.
With the fate of the match resting
squarely on the shoulders of Stan
ford freshman Whitney Deason (26-
3), all eyes were on court 4 as No. 51
Deason pried the conference title
from Diane Matias' hands, 3-6, 6-2,
7-5.
The Cardinal captured its 18th
consecutive Pac-10 title on Friday
and steeled itself against a feisty
Bruins lineup on Saturday.
But what already constituted an
epic weekend for the undefeated
team was even more monumental in
the glaring absence of No. 20 senior
Erin Burdette.

Burdette, named to the ITA Na
tional Doubles Team of the Year in
2004 with former partner Lauren
Barnikow, was stifled by a persistent
shoulder injury and sat out from
match play all weekend.
"When you take your most expe
rienced doubles player out of the
mix, [and] you're playing the two
toughest [opponents] in the confer
ence, it's going to be a completely
different situation," said Stanford
head coach Lele Forood. "Given the
uncertainty over whether Erin
would be able to play this weekend,
I think we did an outstanding job to
come out this weekend with two
wins."
In light of the setback, Stanford's
quick adjustments and recovery
showed that the team's resilience
only reinforces its already daunting
record.
Liu and sophomore Anne Yelsey
led gracefully at the doubles helm,
posting a decisive 8-4 victory over
Matias and Leimbach.
On Saturday, the No. 29 duo kept
their cool as they edged No. 2
Daniela Bercek and Riza Zalameda
in a tiebreak, 9-8 (5).
Putting the Cardinal-Bruins
showdown in perspective, Yelsey
and freshman standout Zalameda
were doubles partners in the junior
circuit, where they secured a spot in
the U.S. Open main dr§w in 2002.
At No. 2 doubles, junior Alice
Barnes took on Logar as a new part
ner. As expected, it took some time
for Barnes and Logar to get used to
each other's styles of play.
Logar and Barnes dropped an 8-6
decision to Nelson and Carine Ver
meulen on Friday, but bounced back
to win 8-4 against UCLA's Laura
Gordon and Alex McGoodwin.
"Our goal in the switch-ups was
to break up as few teams as possi
ble," Forood said. "I was really
proud to see Amber and Anne go 2-
0 for the weekend. Also, Alice is an
experienced doubles player, and
Theresa can certainly play. After
facing a strong team on Friday, they
were that much better on Satur
day."
