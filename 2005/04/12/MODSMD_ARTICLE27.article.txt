# Junior Chris Hernandez to declare for NBA draft
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford junior point guard Chris Her
nandez will declare for the NBA draft but
will not hire an agent, leaving open the pos
sibility that he will return to the Farm fora
final season head coach Trent Johnson told
ESPN.com's Andy Katz yesterday.
Johnson said that Hernandez, a two
time All-Pacific-10 Conference selection
who averaged 15.2 points per game this
season, wants to see if he will receive an in
vitation to the four-day Chicago pre-draft
camp that starts June 7. The Chicago camp
most often includes players projected to be
drafted in the second round or not at all.
Underclassmen have until May 14 to
declare for the June 28 draft and can with
draw their names up until June 21. Pac-10
stars Dijon Thompson and Nate Robin
son took part in last year's Chicago camp

but opted to return to school.
Hernandez, who sat out the 2002-2(X)3
season with a broken foot and has battled
other nagging injuries throughout his ca
reer, was on track to graduate this June.
He could not be reached for comment.
"Everyone is in full support of Chris'
decision to test the waters," senior center
Rob Little, who played four years along
side Hernandez, said. "He's been a very
productive guard in the Pac-10 and he has
nothing to lose in seeing where he stands.
If anything he'll come back with a better
idea of what he needs to do to make it at
the next level."
Meanwhile, Little did wonders to his
hopes of playing professional basketball
after recording three straight double
doubles at the 53rd Portsmouth Invita
tional Tournament last week.
