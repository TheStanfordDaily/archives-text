# Junior Chris Hernandez to declare for NBA draft
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford junior point guard Chris Her
nandez will declare for the NBA draft but
will not hire an agent, leaving open the pos
sibility that he will return to the Farm fora
final season head coach Trent Johnson told
ESPN.com's Andy Katz yesterday.
Johnson said that Hernandez, a two
time All-Pacific-10 Conference selection
who averaged 15.2 points per game this
season, wants to see if he will receive an in
vitation to the four-day Chicago pre-draft
camp that starts June 7. The Chicago camp
most often includes players projected to be
drafted in the second round or not at all.
Underclassmen have until May 14 to
declare for the June 28 draft and can with
draw their names up until June 21. Pac-10
stars Dijon Thompson and Nate Robin
son took part in last year's Chicago camp

but opted to return to school.
Hernandez, who sat out the 2002-2(X)3
season with a broken foot and has battled
other nagging injuries throughout his ca
reer, was on track to graduate this June.
He could not be reached for comment.
"Everyone is in full support of Chris'
decision to test the waters," senior center
Rob Little, who played four years along
side Hernandez, said. "He's been a very
productive guard in the Pac-10 and he has
nothing to lose in seeing where he stands.
If anything he'll come back with a better
idea of what he needs to do to make it at
the next level."
Meanwhile, Little did wonders to his
hopes of playing professional basketball
after recording three straight double
doubles at the 53rd Portsmouth Invita
tional Tournament last week.

Senior center Rob Little picked up three double-doubles at the 53rd Portsmouth Invitational in
Virginia. He now awaits an invitation to the NBA pre-draft camp.
Little was among 64 college se
niors invited to the four-day, eight
team, 11-game tournament, which
serves as a chance for seniors to show
case their talent before NBA scouts,
general managers and agents in the
only pre-draft camp prior to Chicago.
"Coach Johnson and the rest of
the staff had a lot to do with getting
me in there," said Little, who aver
aged nine points and 6.1 rebounds in
his senior season on the Farm.
Little teamed with Vermont star
center Taylor Coppenrath on the Nor
folk Sports Club team in Portsmouth,
which is just a half-hour drive from his
hometown of Hampton, Va.
"It's a community event, so there
are lots of kids who want to get auto
graphs, and there are also a ton of
agents swarming to guys after the
games," Little said. "Of course I had
a lot of family down there. It was re
ally fun overall."
Despite playing just 16 minutes
due to foul trouble. Little finished
with 10 points and 10 rebounds on
Wednesday, when he matched up
against Cincinnati's Jason Maxiell.
"The refs want to see you get
physical but they also have to con
trol things." Little said. "1 was going
at it pretty good with Maxiell in the
first game."
Playing against a familiar foe,
Oregon State center David Lucas,
on Thursday. Little managed to stay
out of foul trouble and play 27 min
utes, finishing with 14 points and 12
rebounds.
Little was equally effective in his
final game of the tournament, scor
ing 11 points and grabbing 11 re
bounds — six of them on the offen

sive end — in a one-point loss to the
Norfolk Naval Shipyard team that
included Pacific's Guillaume Yango
and West Virginia's D'or Fischer.
Little credited his physical style
of play for his success in the tourna
ment.
"Along with lowa State's Jared
Homan, we were probably the only
true bangers per se in Portsmouth."
Little said. "We kind of stuck to our
guns, banging in the post, playing
good interior defense."
Little has hired agent Joel Bell,
who represents several NBA play
ers, including big men Theo Ratliff,
Tony Battie and Marc Jackson and
former Maryland point guard Steve
Blake. Bell also recently signed
Kentucky junior Kelenna
Azubuike.
"Things are looking good right
now," an upbeat Little said. "My
selling point is being a banger and a
post defender. I'm not going to be a
big scorer but I'm going to do the
dirty work. The most important
thing for me at Portsmouth was the
rebounds. I could have scored zero
points and been happy with my pro
duction. and a lot of my points were
off of put-backs. If you just do what
you do well and are okay with it,
you'll find a job."
While he awaits a possible invita
tion to the Chicago pre-draft camp
along with Hernandez. Little is fo
cusing on improving his condition
ing. Already with enough credits to
graduate, Little is taking a light
course load and working out with
fellow senior Nick Robinson —
often two times a day — and mixing
in some yoga as well.
Little said he is cautiously opti
mistic about his chances.
"1 think 1 made a good statement
and I heard back from scouts that I
made a good case for myself, but
nothing is guaranteed," Little said.
