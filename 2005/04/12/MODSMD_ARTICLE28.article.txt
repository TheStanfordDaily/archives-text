# Crew teams impressive
## 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
At the San Diego Crew Classic a week ago,
each of the Stanford crew teams made a loud
statement. The previously No. 14-ranked men
pulled off a dramatic upset against defending
champion No. 2 Cal, the No. 10 women's
squad placed in the medals twice in their finals
competition and the lightweight women took
the A. W. Coggeshall Cup final by a margin of
more than nine seconds.
And competing this weekend at the 3rd
annual Windermere Collegiate Crew Classic,
each of the three teams emphatically sent
those statements resonating to every corner
of the collegiate rowing world.
Held at Redwood Shores Lagoon in Red
wood City, Calif., the Windermere regatta
featured crews representing 20 collegiate
programs from across the nation. Conducted
in a Henley-style format, each event matched
two boats fora head-to-head sprint down the
two-kilometer course. The race format alone
was a major factor that every crew had to fac
tor into their race strategy.
"Dual races are always psychologically
tougher than multiple boat races," sopho
more lightweight Meredith Coleman said.
"In a dual race, second place is also last place,
and is therefore a harder position to cope

with emotionally. Thus, the general strategy
is to get ahead early to mentally break the
other boat."
Coleman's lightweight boat did a solid job
executing that strategy in convincing victories
over San Diego State and Georgetown in Sat
urday's competition. But defeating their East
Coast rivals was definitely the sweeter ac
complishment of the two.
"Much of our winter training has been
motivated by thoughts of beating George
town, and winning that race was the culmina
tion of a lot of hard work," senior captain
Kristina Peterson said.
Out-pacing the Hoyas from start to finish,
the Cardinal crossed the finish line nine sec
onds before the team that placed fourth in
last year's national championships.
"They have traditionally had a very strong
program, so to beat them by such a significant
margin really puts us at a new level of com
petitiveness," senior captain Cady Kintner
said.
The lightweight women fell short in their
bid fora perfect weekend in their final race,
falling behind Princeton's boat early and fail
ing to make up the ground. But according to
Coleman, it was an effort that nonetheless
contained reason for optimism.

The No. 5 Stanford men's crew team.defeated No. 8 Dartmouth and No. 9 Yale at the Windermere Regatta.
"We had an awesome start and
rowed the first half of the race faster
than we ever have before," she said.
"Our ending sprint was also solid, but
unfortunately a good start and finish
aren't enough â€” we need to stay just
as strong through the middle."
That ability is one the Cardinal
clearly have the potential to develop,
and they will be looking to hone it
during their preparation for next
weekend's Knecht Cup in Cherry-
Hill, New Jersey.
The No. 10 women's squad
strengthened its case for an NCAA
bid by coming away from the week
end with a 5-1 overall record. The
Cardinal's two varsity boats faced
tough Texas boats but both managed
to emerge victoriously. The second
varsity passed the course's halfway
mark deadlocked with the Longhorn
boat, but worked three seconds of
separation over the next 5()0 meters
that eventually proved to be the dif
ference in the race.
The highlight matchup of the
weekend for the Cardinal women was
against No. 14 Wisconsin. The first
varsity boat trailed midway through
the race, fighting to stay within one
length of the Wisconsin boat. The
Cardinal collected themselves to
surge to a slim lead going into the final
500 meters, then dug deep to close out
the effort.
"They gave us a fight all the way
down the course," senior Sam Magee
said. "We just tried to stay relaxed
and kept pushing away in the second
thousand."
The second varsity team didn't
fare as well in its Wisconsin show
down, but recovered nicely to hand
Clemson's boat a six-second loss Sun

day morning. An hour later, the
women's first varsity followed suit,
posting their fastest course time of the
weekend. And yet despite their ac
complishments, there was an encour
aging sense of discontent among the
members of the women's squad.
"While our boat was disappointed
with our performance in some aspects
of the weekend, we try to remember
that our performance represents a
whole new level of depth for our
team," said junior Alexis Peterson,
who rowed in the women's second
varsity boat. "The fact that we're not
satisfied with results that might have
thrilled us in years past is actually a
great sign."
The Cardinal men, meanwhile,
looked to build on last weekend's ef
fort, which bumped them from No. 14
to No. 5 in the national polls. Despite
being handed losses by perennial
powerhouse No. 4 Washington, the
Cardinal rebounded to post strong
showings against crews representing
several legendary collegiate pro
grams. The men's first varsity boat
overpowered No. 8 Dartmouth and
then held off a late charge by No. 9
Yale to conclude its weekend. The
men's second boat earned its only win
of the weekend Saturday afternoon
over Dartmouth.
"Overall, we showed that we can
hang with the best in the country, but
the weekend definitely illuminated
some of our weaknesses," junior Jake
Cornelius said. "Our race against
Washington was really disappointing,
but we responded to our early loss
well and used it to gauge where we
were as a program. Pulling together
after such a tough loss reflects a level
of maturity we haven't had at Stan
ford in the past."
That maturity, combined with an
imposing depth of talent, is a strong
reason to be optimistic as the Cardi
nal look ahead toward the challenges
still awaiting them this season.
