# Crew teams impressive

### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
At the San Diego Crew Classic a week ago,
each of the Stanford crew teams made a loud
statement. The previously No. 14-ranked men
pulled off a dramatic upset against defending
champion No. 2 Cal, the No. 10 women's
squad placed in the medals twice in their finals
competition and the lightweight women took
the A. W. Coggeshall Cup final by a margin of
more than nine seconds.
And competing this weekend at the 3rd
annual Windermere Collegiate Crew Classic,
each of the three teams emphatically sent
those statements resonating to every corner
of the collegiate rowing world.
Held at Redwood Shores Lagoon in Red
wood City, Calif., the Windermere regatta
featured crews representing 20 collegiate
programs from across the nation. Conducted
in a Henley-style format, each event matched
two boats fora head-to-head sprint down the
two-kilometer course. The race format alone
was a major factor that every crew had to fac
tor into their race strategy.
"Dual races are always psychologically
tougher than multiple boat races," sopho
more lightweight Meredith Coleman said.
"In a dual race, second place is also last place,
and is therefore a harder position to cope

with emotionally. Thus, the general strategy
is to get ahead early to mentally break the
other boat."
Coleman's lightweight boat did a solid job
executing that strategy in convincing victories
over San Diego State and Georgetown in Sat
urday's competition. But defeating their East
Coast rivals was definitely the sweeter ac
complishment of the two.
"Much of our winter training has been
motivated by thoughts of beating George
town, and winning that race was the culmina
tion of a lot of hard work," senior captain
Kristina Peterson said.
Out-pacing the Hoyas from start to finish,
the Cardinal crossed the finish line nine sec
onds before the team that placed fourth in
last year's national championships.
"They have traditionally had a very strong
program, so to beat them by such a significant
margin really puts us at a new level of com
petitiveness," senior captain Cady Kintner
said.
The lightweight women fell short in their
bid fora perfect weekend in their final race,
falling behind Princeton's boat early and fail
ing to make up the ground. But according to
Coleman, it was an effort that nonetheless
contained reason for optimism.
