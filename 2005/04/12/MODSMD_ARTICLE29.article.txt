# Cardinal struggle, recover late
## Women's golf third at home 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The finish wasn't what they wanted, but there is little
doubt about the heart of the No. 21 Stanford women's
golf team after this weekend's rollercoaster perfor
mance. The Cardinal placed third in their only home
tournament of the spring, six shots behind winner No. 6
Washington, which shot a 19-over-par 587 for the two
round event.
Fora team looking to build confidence before the be
ginning of Pacific-10 Conference Tournament play next
Monday, Saturday's opening round was something of a
punch to the stomach. On their home turf, where they
claimed victory over a nearly identical field without
breaking a sweat a year ago, the Cardinal appeared lost
from tee to green.
Returning home to perfect conditions after playing a
series of events on the road this spring, Stanford might
have expected to have a little fun in front of its home fans
and under spring quarter's sunny skies.
An 18-over-par 302 on Saturday, however, left lit
tle for the birds to chirp about, as the Cardinal
dropped behind the only two legitimate contenders
in the tournament, Washington and No. 24 Washing
ton State.
While Stanford struggled, the Huskies and Cougars
looked glad to escape the rainy Washington spring and
take control of a tournament the hosts were only too
happy to give away. Washington's 287 on Saturday
staked the Huskies to an eight-stroke lead over the sec
ond-place Cougars.
Meanwhile, Washington State's Kim Welch was mak
ing the cup look more like a hula hoop as she rolled in
birdie putts from every direction en route to a women's
course-record five-under-par 66. The only blemish on
Welch's scorecard came when a sliding three-foot par ef
fort lipped out at No. 14.
For Stanford, what should have been a victory romp
was more like a slow trudge.
Sophomore Jenni Tangtiphaiboontana led the way
with a one-over-par 72. while junior Kelly Husted and se
nior Wendra Liang each shot 74.
However, junior Stephanie Lue, who never seemed
to get comfortable this weekend, shot 82, and sopho
more Lauren Todd carded an 84. her worst score of the
year.
Todd held her emotions in check just long enough to
shake hands with her playing partners on the 18th green
before tears began to How.
Her disappointment was shared by the entire team,
which maintained all week that this was its tournament
to win.
On Sunday, those who rose early enough to catch the
8 a.m. shotgun start saw the team they'd been hearing
about. "We had a couple rounds the first day that were
really anomalies," Liang said. "All season we've typical
ly had strong finishing rounds, so 1 think everyone be
lieved that regardless of the first day's result, we could all
come out and have a great Sunday."
You can say that again.
Despite bogeying her final hole,
Husted posted a 71, tying for fourth
place individually â€” her best finish
of the year. Tangtiphaiboontana
joined her in the top 10. shooting 75
on Sunday to tie for eighth place.
Liang's second consecutive 74
tied her for 13th place, while an 88
from Lue dropped her to 72nd over
all.
Then there was Todd. After
struggling off the course Saturday,
she literally bounded to hand Sun
day's scorecard to coach Caroline
O'Connor. "71!" she shouted tri
umphantly, after a round in which
she birdied four of her final seven
holes. Stanford's 291 on Sunday was
the best round of the day.
"After the first round, I was
crushed." Todd said. "But I talked to
my parents, who are the best parents
in the world, and they just told me
there was no reason why the last
round would be more of the same.
It's the perfect weekend going into
post-season. Saturday was a swift
kick in the ass and Sunday gave me
the confidence to know that I can go
low."
For the Stanford men, this week
end was one they'd prefer to leave in
the past. The Cardinal ran into a
solid field in Tempe. Ariz., at the

ASU Thunderbird Invitational,
where they finished 12th in a field of
15 teams. No. 2 UNLV claimed top
team honors in the event, despite
playing without senior Ryan Moore,
who took 13th place playing as an
amateur in this weekend's Master's.
Senior Kevin Blue paced Stan
ford in Arizona, posting scores of 70-
76-71 to finish in a tie for 18th place
individually. Four shots behind him
was freshman Rob Grube (70-73-
78), who tied for 32nd.
Sophomore Zack Miller (76-76-
74) wrapped up the weekend in an
eight-way tie for 51st place, while
fellow sophomore Matt Savage was
just three strokes behind him and
tied for 69th. Junior Kyle Gentry
rounded out the team scoring for the
Cardinal, shooting 77-75-81 to tie for
75th place. Competing as an individ
ual. but not contributing to the team
score was freshman Teddy Collins,
who fired rounds of 75-78-76 to tie
with Savage for 69th place.
Stanford will try to bounce back
this weekend as the team returns for
its home tournament, the U.S. Inter
collegiate. The two-day event will
begin Saturday morning and consist
of 54 holes of competition.
"We won't completely forget
about last week, because we will not
get better unless we are aware of
what contributes to a good or bad
performance," Grube said. "On the
other hand, we try not to let last
week's performance bruise our con
fidence."
