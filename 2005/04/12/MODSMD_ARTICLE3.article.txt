# UCSD prof. discusses openness in the media

### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
Michael Schudson, author and profes
sor of communication at UC San Diego, ar
gued last night that increasing openness in
the media and society is a double- edged
sword, one that can provoke discussion but
also violate privacy rights.
"I like the openness in communication,
but 1 don't like e-mail spam and telemar
keters calling my home," Schudson told a
crowd in Turing Auditorium for this
spring's Carlos McClatchy Lecture. "There
are limits, particularly to personal privacy,
that we should protect."
Schudson detailed the "development of
a culture of disclosure and its conse
quences." The 1940s and 19505, he said,
were a time of over-cooperation between
Congress and the media, which led to little
public oversight of government. But the ex-

cessive secrecy of the Cold War gave birth
to the Freedom of Information Act in 1964.
Following the act, scandals like Watergate
and government deception in the Vietnam
War invigorated the media.
"Journalists developed a reflex of dis
trust," Schudson said. "A new skepticism
flourished and received blessings from the
news establishment."
Trust in public institutions dropped pre
cipitously during this period and have
never bounced back, he added.
This era of heightened skepticism and
openness has been a largely positive factor
in American life, Schudson said, citing well
known author Judy Blume's groundbreak
ing stories on more controversial adoles
cent issues and former First Lady Betty
Ford's public battle with breast cancer.
But this new freedom also marked the

beginning of a slow decline in media
decency. Privacy concerns were more
often trumped hy ratings wars and the
public's hunger for gossip. Schudson
cited the contrast between the Nixon
White Mouse tapes — from which ex
pletives were carefully deleted — and
the sexually-graphic report by Ken
Starr during the Monica Lewinsky
scandal.
"Civility is no longer the law of the
land, nor the custom." he said, adding
that the American public is more than
just generally dissatisfied with govern

ment institutions. Today, the public
has become disillusioned with the
overall attitude that drives culture and
the media.
"We're not only grumpy about the
state of our institutions, we're grumpy
about our state of grumpiness," Schud
son said.
The danger of an increasingly open
society, Schudson argued, is that in
creasingly toxic discourse could push
"good people to shun it."
"The very openness of society
could weaken it, or even shut it down,"
he added.
Many students and faculty in atten
dance said they were impressed by
Schudson's research.
"Schudson is an important and
novel thinker," said Robert Samet, a

first-year doctoral student in cultural
and social anthropology. "One of the
things 1 got excited about was what it
means to he open and what the costs of
that are for democracy."
Fred Turner, assistant professor of
communication, praised Schudson's
original and creative approach to the
topic.
"Michael has identified the culture
of disclosure we knew existed and gave
it a name," he said.
Turner added that he appreciated
Schudson's argument that Ford pub
licly announced her struggle with
breast cancer as a response to the se
crecy of the Nixon Administration.
Schudson was creative to argue that
"Betty Ford's breast was an instrument
of the state," Turner said.
