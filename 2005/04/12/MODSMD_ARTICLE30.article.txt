# Lacrosse splits at N'western, ND
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team (7-5, 4-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) split its week
end trip in two drastically different
contests over the weekend, getting
stomped by No. 1 Northwestern 16-
3 on Friday before squeaking past
Notre Dame 6-5 in a Sunday
thriller.
Stanford knew heading into its
game against Northwestern (12-0)
that visiting the No. 1 team in the
country and emerging victorious
would be a tall order.
"I think we just saw it as a huge
opportunity," head coach Michelle
Uhlfelder said. "Good things are
going to come out of playing the
No. 1 team. We were looking for
ward to the challenge and knew we
were going to prosper from playing
a great team."
Despite Stanford's optimistic
approach, the Wildcats still caught
the Cardinal off-guard in the first
half. Northwestern scored eight
straight goals en route to a 10-2
halftime lead. Senior midfielder
Kelsey Twist and freshman mid
fielder Megan McClain netted
first-half scores for the Cardinal,
and junior attacker Sarah Bach
notched one of her team-leading 22
scores in the second half, but the
Wildcats tallied the last five goals
of the contest and rolled to the 16-3
final margin. Freshman goalie
Laura Shane recorded ten stops in
the loss.
"It was a pretty tough game," se
nior midfielder Nina Pantano said.
"I was definitely disappointed af
terward. Northwestern is a great
team, probably the better team, but
we could have played better."
Even in the wake of the lopsided
loss, Stanford managed to regroup
in time for the Sunday showdown
against Notre Dame (3-8).
"We actually took some mo
mentum from the end of the North
western game into the Notre Dame
game," Uhlfelder said. "We were
able to cause some turnovers and
work on some pressure defense
within the Northwestern game. I
think that game actually gave our
defense a lot more opportunities,
because of adversity, to grow and
gain better chemistry."
The defense showed its mettle
against the Irish, for while the
Northwestern match turned into a

rout, the Notre Dame contest
evolved into a classic. Five times,
Stanford or Notre Dame scored a
goal to put them ahead by one goal.
Five times the other team battled
back and immediately answered
with a goal of their own. Sopho
more midfielder Liz Piselli, Twist,
junior attacker Megan Burker,
Bach and McClain accounted for
the first five Cardinal goals, but, try
as they might, Stanford could not
build any sort of permanent lead.
Neither team ever led by more than
one score, and the game stood
squared at 5-5 with 7:18 left in the
second half.
Although both teams had great
looks in the waning minutes of the
contest, neither Stanford nor Notre
Dame could convert in a game that
looked to be heading for overtime.
Pantano had other ideas, however.
In her third shot of the game, the
senior finally struck gold, whizzing
a bullet past the left side of Notre
Dame goalie Carol Dixon. With
only 18 seconds left, Stanford easi
ly ran out the clock to clinch the 6-
5 victory.
"I knew that there was not that
much time when I first got the
ball," Pantano said. "I wasn't look
ing to attack at first, but just real
ized there was space for me to
move inside. There was a double
team, but 1 managed to get the ball
over their sticks and past the
goalie."
Both Pantano and Uhlfelder
agreed the Notre Dame victory
bodes well for the team's future.
"The Notre Dame victory shows
that our team is learning how to
win, learning how to stand up in
pressure situations and learning
how to come through," Uhlfelder
said. "The seniors were great lead
ers throughout the weekend."
"We just knew Notre Dame was
the turning point," Pantano said.
"We needed to win this game. I'm
really proud of everyone: we fixed
some of the things we worked on,
we played the full 60 minutes and
we didn't die. I think it was a great
ending and we're really looking
forward to finishing the season out
strong."
Only four regular-season games
now remain on the Cardinal's
schedule. This weekend Yale visits
Maloney Field at 7 p.m. on Friday,
and Stanford concludes its MPSF
regular season with a 1 p.m. Sunday
visit from Denver.

much time when I first got the
ball," Pantano said. "I wasn't look
ing to attack at first, but just real
ized there was space for me to
move inside. There was a double
team, but 1 managed to get the ball
over their sticks and past the
goalie."
Both Pantano and Uhlfelder
agreed the Notre Dame victory
bodes well for the team's future.
"The Notre Dame victory shows
that our team is learning how to
win, learning how to stand up in
pressure situations and learning
how to come through," Uhlfelder
said. "The seniors were great lead
ers throughout the weekend."
"We just knew Notre Dame was
the turning point," Pantano said.
"We needed to win this game. I'm
really proud of everyone: we fixed
some of the things we worked on,
we played the full 60 minutes and
we didn't die. I think it was a great
ending and we're really looking
forward to finishing the season out
strong."
Only four regular-season games
now remain on the Cardinal's
schedule. This weekend Yale visits
Maloney Field at 7 p.m. on Friday,
and Stanford concludes its MPSF
regular season with a 1 p.m. Sunday
visit from Denver.
