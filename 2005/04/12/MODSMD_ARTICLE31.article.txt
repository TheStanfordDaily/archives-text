# Men's gymnasts earn fourth at NCAAs
## 
### ABBY ZEITLIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The men's gymnastics team ended its
2005 collegiate season this past weekend
at the NCAA championships at the U.S.
Military Academy in West Point, N.Y.
The Cardinal entered the pre-quali
fying competition both physically and
mentally prepared, but in a tense, high
energy competition like the NCAAs, the
fate of the team rested in their ability to
execute perfectly every hard routine.
The NCAA Championship consists
of a team competition and an individual
competition.
The Cardinal earned fourth place in
the pre-qualifying competition on
Thursday, finishing with a 218.375, just
1.5 points shy of qualifying for Friday's
team finals.
The Cardinal missed big routines on
every event, yet despite the disappoint
ments throughout the evening, the Car
dinal fought to the bitter end, managing
to secure the fourth place seed. A team
must secure one of the top three seeds to
move on to the finals.
Oklahoma won the NCAA team
championships with a score of 225.675,
followed by Ohio State. Illinois rounded
out the top three.
The Cardinal have at a minimum
three athletes on each event with strong
start values of at least a 9.8, while the
other men competing have lower start
values. Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
there was no room for error on Thursday
night, especially when compared to the
depth and seniority of the other teams.
"You just can't reproduce the energy
of the crowd in practice, and with such a
young team, they definitely learned a lot,
and I think that they are aware of what
it's going to take in the future," coach
Thom Glielmi said.
Junior Nate Downs has been out
most of the season with an injury, but
still managed to score well enough on
the high bars to reach the qualifiers.
On an exercise that the Cardinal has
struggled with throughout the season,
freshman Jason Shen performed well on
the pommel horse, earning a 9.175.
In a surprising twist, freshman David
Sender was the only member of the
men's team to continue on to the indi
vidual final competition on Saturday.
He placed tenth on the parallel bars with
an 8.925.
"For Sender to make the finals on the
parallel bars was exceptional," Glielmi
said.
Unfortunately, Sender suffered from
the unlucky position of being the first
competitor of the meet on the floor ex
ercise in the individual qualifiers.

This NCAA Championship not only
marked the end of the Cardinal's season,
but also the end of outstanding careers
for Cardinal seniors Kelly Lang, Ambert
Young, and Daniel Torres-Rangel.
They provided an unprecedented
strength in their leadership.
Although the Cardinal were disap
pointed with the results of the NCAA
championships, Glielmi chalked this
season up to growth that will be valuable

next year as his team gains seniority and
experience competing together on the
college level.
The team this year was composed
mostly of sophomores and freshmen,
and this year served as a learning experi
ence for the young team, both physical
and also mental. Glielmi admitted to
running a tight regime in the gym based
on consistency and numbers that many
of the young gymnasts are not used to.

The Cardinal have used this year as a
growth experience, and now that they
have gotten a taste of the NCAA cham
pionships. they will begin to prepare for
a strong season next year.
Although the collegiate season has
ended, the Cardinal barely gets time to
breathe before they again begin train
ing in preparation for the USA Cham
pionships and the World Team this
summer.
