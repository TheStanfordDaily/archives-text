# Early U.S. newspapers to be digitized
## 
### MICHELE GOLDMAN 
Currently, if a history student wanted to learn
about local reactions to the first successful air
plane flight by the Wright Brothers, he or she
would have to trudge to the library and peruse
reel after reel of microfilm for hours on end.
But beginning in September 2006, the Na
tional Digital Newspaper Project will enable stu
dents to access early 20th century periodicals by
simply surfing the Internet.
Last Monday, the Library of Congress and
the National Endowment for the Humanities de
clared that four universities and two public li
braries had received grants to digitize local
newspaper articles published between 1900 and
1910. If it is successful, program directors will ex
pand the project to include periodicals published
from 1836 to 1922.
Institutions piloting the program include the
Library of Virginia, the New York Public Li
brary, UC Riverside, the University of Florida,
the University of Kentucky Research Founda
tion and the University of Utah. Stanford did not
apply fora grant to participate in the program.
Several students said they are elated at the
prospect of no longer having to rely on microfilm,
which can often be difficult and tedious to use.
"Eased access to this information will expand
the possibilities for students of history farther
than ever before," said sophomore Matt Smith,
an American studies major. "A true history
lover would be nuts to not jump at the opportu
nities that this project will offer."
The project is part of a burgeoning trend to
ward digitizing print resources. Last year,
Google decided to collaborate with Stanford and
other universities to make more than 50 million
library books available online in the Google
Print Library Project.

While it is not involved in the National Digi
tal Newspaper Project, Google praised the pro
ject's aim.
"Our mission is to make offline information
available online," said Nathan Tyler, a Google
spokesperson, in an interview with The Stanford
Daily. "We welcome the endeavor of any institu
tion to make more information available to the
world."
The process of digitally preserving newspaper
articles poses an even greater challenge than
Google's initiative to digitize library books, said
Mark Sweeny, Library of Congress member and
program manager of the National Digital News
paper Project, in an interview with The Stanford
Daily.
Newspaper articles are text intensive and in
clude diverse fonts, point sizes and graphics, he
said. By utilizing optical character recognition
software, project leaders will not only provide a
PDF image of the page, but will also convert ar
ticles into searchable texts, making them more
accessible and easy to browse.
Research professors are thrilled by the pro
gram, having relied on a limited database of dig
itized periodical articles in the past. History Prof.
David Kennedy said that The New York Times
has long contained the only reliable index for re
searchers to examine specific topics, individuals
or events.
" This marvelous project will enhance the ca
pacity to do research at local levels through a
similar index," Kennedy said. "It will open up re
search possibilities."
He added that it is significant that the Nation
al Digitalization Project will initially focus on the
first decade of the 20th century, a decade brim
ming with social, economic and political issues.
The decade prompted the era of pluralism and
the Progressive Movement, as well as the grow

ing perception of the United States as a global
power.
'It makes a lot of sense that the project will
begin in this time period," Kennedy said. "This
decade was the incubator in which American so
ciety began to confront its identity and it has con
tinued to influence us ever since."
The Library of Congress said that it also
chose to concentrate on this decade due to its cli
mactic accomplishments in the field of journal
ism.
"1909 marked the high watermark for publi
cations of American newspapers," Sweeny said.
"This year had the greatest number of daily and
news publications in the United States, as it pre
ceded the radio and television, and hence the
consolidation of American news publications."
This proliferation of periodicals especially
manifested itself on the grassroots level, yet
knowledge of local events has since been
eclipsed by national news coverage. The News
paper Project coordinators said they hope to re
vive an appreciation for American history from
a local perspective.
"Local newspaper documents and local play
ers are often not documented in the great annals
of history," Sweeny said. "So when a local news
paper ceases, we lose a sense of the past."
The movement to digitize local newspapers
has broad implications not only for history stu
dents. but for journalism students as well.
"Journalists say that they write the first draft
of history." said William Woo, a visiting profes
sor in the Communication Department. "If I was
teaching a history of journalism class, it would be
wonderful to easily ask students to compare sto
ries on local elections, national disasters and
other events and see how the journalistic world
approached it. This project will demonstrate the
evolution of the newspaper."

" This marvelous project will enhance the ca
pacity to do research at local levels through a
similar index," Kennedy said. "It will open up re
search possibilities."
He added that it is significant that the Nation
al Digitalization Project will initially focus on the
first decade of the 20th century, a decade brim
ming with social, economic and political issues.
The decade prompted the era of pluralism and
the Progressive Movement, as well as the grow

ing perception of the United States as a global
power.
'It makes a lot of sense that the project will
begin in this time period," Kennedy said. "This
decade was the incubator in which American so
ciety began to confront its identity and it has con
tinued to influence us ever since."
The Library of Congress said that it also
chose to concentrate on this decade due to its cli
mactic accomplishments in the field of journal
ism.
"1909 marked the high watermark for publi
cations of American newspapers," Sweeny said.
"This year had the greatest number of daily and
news publications in the United States, as it pre
ceded the radio and television, and hence the
consolidation of American news publications."
This proliferation of periodicals especially
manifested itself on the grassroots level, yet
knowledge of local events has since been
eclipsed by national news coverage. The News
paper Project coordinators said they hope to re
vive an appreciation for American history from
a local perspective.
"Local newspaper documents and local play
ers are often not documented in the great annals
of history," Sweeny said. "So when a local news
paper ceases, we lose a sense of the past."
The movement to digitize local newspapers
has broad implications not only for history stu
dents. but for journalism students as well.
"Journalists say that they write the first draft
of history." said William Woo, a visiting profes
sor in the Communication Department. "If I was
teaching a history of journalism class, it would be
wonderful to easily ask students to compare sto
ries on local elections, national disasters and
other events and see how the journalistic world
approached it. This project will demonstrate the
evolution of the newspaper."
