Despite the mounting piles of papers and
midterms that will plague many in coming weeks.
Stanford students have many opportunities to
enjoy themselves on the Farm. Reflecting stu
dents' talent for balancing work and fun, a recent
survey conducted by the Consortium on Financ
ing and Higher Education, or COFHE, confirmed
that Stanford students are on average more satis
fied with their undergraduate experiences than
their peers at other elite universities.
The survey was conducted in 2002 and the re
sults were withheld from the public, according
to COFHE officials. The data came to light on
March 29 when The Boston Globe published an
article on the subject after obtaining an internal
memo regarding the survey results from Har
vard.
The Globe reported that Harvard students feel
less satisfied about the campus social life, sense of
community, faculty availability and quality of in-

struction than students at other elite schools based
on the data gathered by COFHE from 2002 Har
vard graduates. On a five-point scale, they rated
their overall satisfaction at 3.95 while the average
score for the COFHE membership schools was
4.16.
COFHE — an organization of 31 private col
leges and universities that researches financial aid,
admissions and institutional and administrative
policy — conducts a survey every four years of
graduating seniors at all of its member institutions
which include Princeton, the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology and liberal arts colleges such as
Amherst and Pomona. According to Kristine Dil
lon. president of COFHE, its member schools
take part in various cooperative studies regarding
admissions, financial aid and student life.
"Membership in the Consortium provides
schools with comparable data from peer institu
tions, all of which use the data to maintain and im
prove the quality of their highly competitive un
dergraduate programs," Dillon said in an inter
view with the Daily.

According to Tim Warner, vice provost for
Stanford's Budget and Auxiliary Management
and Stanford's liaison to COFHE, Stanford
scored high marks when the Class of 2002 was sur
veyed on its feelings toward campus life and the
sense of community.
"Of the responses that Stanford received from
COFHE, Stanford did come out more positively
than the COFHE average school participant."
Warner said.
I lowever. Warner added that the response rate
of Stanford graduates that year was rather low and
therefore not comprehensive enough to draw de
finitive conclusions.
"One shouldn't put too much stock in those re
sults." Warner said. "Nonetheless, 1 do think that
Stanford graduates feel very positively about their
experiences here. And we do see this through
anecdotal evidence as well as the very incomplete
results of this survey."
COFHE will conduct another such survey next
spring for the Class of 2006 and the University
hopes that more students will participate.
