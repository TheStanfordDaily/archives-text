### REBECCA PERLOW ARKANSAS TRAVELER 
(U-WIRE) FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. —
Monsignor James Mancini, pastor at St. Joseph's
Catholic Church of Tontitown and exorcist for
the Arkansas Diesis for the Roman Catholic
Church, discussed exorcism and deliverance
ministry.
"A lot of the things that we think are so inhu
man are inhuman," Mancini said.
More than 1(K) people turned out to hear
Mancini's talk on deliverance ministry, prayer,
and means of freeing people from demonic pos
session. Many were members of the Chi Alpha
Christian Fellowship and Catholic Campus Min
istry, the sponsoring organizations of the pastor's
lecture.
Mancini first became involved in deliverance

ministry 25 years ago as a national board member
for the Charismatics, an informal fellowship of
Christians who believe in present-day manifesta
tions of the Holy Spirit such as healing, miracles
and speaking in tongues. Mancini led a sympo
sium of theologians, counselors and psychologists
in Houston in 1480 on deliverance prayer and pos
sible demonic interference in people's lives. Later,
he was invited to assume his exorcist position by
the bishop of the Arkansas Diesis of Roman
Catholic Church.
"When we talk about spirits, we're talking
about substantial beings without material compo
sition," Mancini said. "It's very much a part of our
Christian and Jewish belief that there are spirits in
the world. Most of the world cultures have some
reference or some word that indicates spirit — the
invisible but real."
He described demons as being atmospheric

or personal spirits with a nature superior to that
of humans and highly manipulative. Atmos
pheric spirits include tangible emotions such as
temptation and aggravation, which have to he
dealt with individually. Personal spirits, spirits
with a name and a malevolent agenda, can be
described as demonic possession. An exorcism
is performed only in cases of demonic posses
sion. he said.
According to the Catholic ritual of exorcism,
which was written in the 14th century, one of the
earliest steps requires the exorcist to determine
whether the trouble that the person is experienc
ing is natural or supernatural.
"Mental anguish, mental disease, emotional in
stability — those are real things, too," Mancini
said. "They're not necessarily caused by demons
by any means. We do enough trouble as human
beings to get the trouble from that."
