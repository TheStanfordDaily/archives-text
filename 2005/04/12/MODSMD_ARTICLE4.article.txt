# Flowers planted behind MemChu
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Memorial Church, considered by many to be the
campus's main attraction for visiting tour groups and
prospective students, is about to smell a lot nicer.
Part of the renowned camellia collection of Mar
jorie O'Malley, a Woodside resident who has culti
vated camellia flowers for 50 years, is being trans
ferred to the grassy areas behind the church. The col
lection was donated by Bill Davidow, a former tech

industry executive and
Stanford alumnus who
purchased O'Malley's
home and garden follow
ing her death in 2004.
Camellias are
spring-blooming, shal
low-rooted shrubs with
flowers that vary from
white to red. Some of the
specimens in the O'Mal
ley collection are over a
half-century old and large
enough to be mistaken

for small trees. The col
lection includes one-of
a-kind hybrids and
plants with bicolor com
binations of red and
white.
"There will be a riot
of color in the spring,"
said Herb Fong, manag
er of Stanford's
Grounds Services De
partment.

Grounds crews began working in earnest last week
to transform the lawns behind the Church into
planters suitable for the camellias. They could be seen
digging and planting even in the inclement weather
last Friday â€” a contrast of yellow rain slickers against
the red and white flowers. The planting should be fin
ished within two weeks, Fong said.
At their former Woodside home, the camellias
resided under a grove of old-growth oak trees. Davi
dow said he decided to donate the camellias in order
to ensure the health of the oaks.

Newly-planted, water-saving flowers are beginning to bloom
behind Memorial Church.


"They wanted to clear out the
garden so that the oak trees would
survive," said Cathy Blake, the assis
tant director of campus planning
and design and the University's se
nior landscape architect. "Typically
you don't do planting and watering
under mature oak trees."
The landscaping is also designed
to save future water and labor costs
since the shrubs will be much more
water-efficient than the lawns that
were in place up until a week ago.
They also won't require tedious edg
ing or mowing.
"It's more economical in the long
run to have a planting that is a non
lawn situation," Fong said. "Lawns
are more of a luxury item and limit
ed in their use."
In fact, the new garden will save
more than 1.87 million gallons of
water per year, according to an arti
cle in The Stanford Report on
March 2.
Stanford received only about
one-third of the total collection; the
rest will go to the Strybing Arbore
tum in Golden Gate Park.
To facilitate the transition and
ease some of the stress on the plants,
grounds crews were told to cut off
two-thirds of the buds.
"This year the bloom is kind of
modest because the buds were cut
off," Blake said. "But next year
should be pretty spectacular. It's
very showy in the spring. The
blooms will be amazing."
