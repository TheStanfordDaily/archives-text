# Week of events marks 11th anniversary
## Students remember Rwanda genocide 
### KILLEEN HANSON STAFF WRITER 
Between April and June of 19 l )4,800,000
Rwandans were killed in just 100 days. Stan
ford students are acknowledging the an
niversary of the genocide this week in a se
ries of events entitled " 11 Years After Geno
cide: Rwanda Past. Present and Future" that
will explore the personal, humanitarian,
legal and political impacts of the crisis.
Event coordinators Cammie Lee and
Chrissie Coxon. both sophomores, said the
week's activities were largely inspired by a
freshman introductory seminar they took
fall quarter of last year entitled "The Rwan
dan Genocide," taught by Political Science
Prof. Stephen Stedman, a senior fellow at
the Stanford Institute for International
Studies who is on leave this year to work for
the United Nations Secretariat.
"The conference is especially pertinent
now because of the crisis in Darfur and be
cause of the issue of U.S. involvement in the
crisis there," Lee said. "We hope to not only
promote more academic awareness of these
issues but also inspire policy changes as
well."
Lee said coordinators tried to host the
conference last year but were unable to do
so because of time constraints. Since early
winter quarter this year, Lee and Coxon
have been working for hours to organize the
week's events, along with freshman Chris
tine Cacioppo and senior Alice Braithwaite.
The Rwandan genocide occurred as part
of the civil war between two ethnic groups
— the Tutsis and the Hutus. The genocide
was sparked by the death of Rwandan Pres
ident Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu.
After his assassination, the mass murder
ing began with Hutus killing Tutsis and
moderate Hutus by the thousands. Civilians
were encouraged to take part, killing their
neighbors for incentives like food and
money.
The Rwandan genocide was largely ig
nored by the international community, and
U.N. trooped withdrew following the deaths

of only 10 of their soldiers.
Lee said that this week's "conference
highlights American actions in Africa, espe
cially in Darfur today where the crisis has
been occurring for almost two and a half
years."
"Stanford needs to be made aware of
these issues," she added.
The scheduled events are designed to
spark discussion about the responsibility
that the United States and other interna
tional powers have in maintaining world
peace, Lee said.
"11 Years After Genocide: Rwanda Past,
Present and Future" includes a photo exhib
it of scenes from Rwanda taken by Braith
waite during her time working at the U.S.
Embassy in Rwanda; a screening of the PBS
documentary, "Ghosts of Rwanda"; a full
day conference this Saturday with personal
stories from Rwandan genocide survivors
and perspectives on the different facets of
the conflict; and a screening of "Hotel
Rwanda" will close out the week.
"We're excited to be appealing to the
growing human rights community on cam
pus," Lee said.
Among the speakers at Saturday's panel
will be Telesphore Kagaba, a political assis
tant from the U.S. Embassy in Rwanda. Ro
main Murenzi. the Rwandan Minister of
Education, has also contacted Lee and the
other organizers to ask if he might speak at
the conference. His travel plans have not
been finalized, but Lee and the other orga
nizers hope to resolve them soon.
"Our speakers are 50 percent native
Rwandans, which 1 think is a wonderful
combination," Lee said.
"This is not a political event," Lee said.
"It is meant only to promote discussion and
provide a framework for considering the
genocide. This is not a partisan dialogue."
Sponsors of "11 Years After Genocide:
Rwanda Past, Present and Future" include
the Roosevelt Institution Center on Inter
national Development, Six Degrees: A
Journal of Human Rights and the Society
for International Affairs at Stanford.
