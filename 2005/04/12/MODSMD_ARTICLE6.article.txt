# Environmental activism discussed
## Young experts speak out on environment 
### DANIEL NOVINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Empty chairs were few and far between on
Monday night as more than 100 Stanford students
and community members participated in a 90-
minute round-table discussion with environmen
talists Adam Werbach and Michael Shellenberg
er. The event spanned a wide breadth of topics,
with the two keynote speakers identifying and
suggesting solutions to current problems within
the environmental movement.
Both speakers brought impressive experience
to the dialogue. Werbach became the president of
the Sierra Club at age 23 and founded Act Now
Productions, a San Francisco-based advertising
company that works with non-profits. He has au
thored two environmental works and currently
serves as the executive director of the Common
Assets Defense Fund, an organization that urges
U.S. citizens and institutions to protect natural
resources.
Like Werbach. Shellenberger is also a pub
lished author of environmental essays. He co
founded the Apollo Alliance, a group of labor,
business and environmental leaders who believe
that decreasing America's dependence on foreign
oil will create three million new American jobs in
the energy sector.
Junior Ben Grant, director of the Roosevelt
Institution Committee on the Environment and
Energy, moderated the event, which was spon
sored by the Roosevelt Institution, and intro
duced the two speakers.
"None of us believe you have to wait until
you're 50 to become a leader," Grant said, noting
the youth of the two speakers.
Shellenberger opened by arguing that the
mainstream environmental movement has pur
sued its goals with too narrow a scope over the
last generation. He argued that while environ-
mental activists have been fighting
for specific causes with limited suc
cess, they should emphasize how
these environmental issues con
nect to society at large.
" The big ecological crises we
face today, such as global warming
and global habitat destruction, are
much more complex crises than the
ones we faced in the I%o's and
1970'5," Shellenberger said. "They
are international in scope and have
to do with our economy and the
way we organize human life. We
need to take a hard look at the kind
of world we want to live in."
Werbach then took the floor,
echoing Shellenberger's call for
broader environmental policies.
"I believe we should substitute
technical policies for something
much larger â€” larger values that
encompass environmental ism,"
Werbach said. "I can protect all
the trees in the world, but I can still
have a world I don't want to live in.
You're not going to protect the
Amazon just by protecting parks;
you need to talk about creating a
sustainable economy. The main
stream environmental tactics don't
just need to be better funded, we
need to focus on better goals."
The duo then took questions
from the audience and continued
to argue fora more comprehensive
environmental policy.
Shellenberger drew laughs from
the audience when, in response to
a question, he critiqued the narrow

scope of modern-day environmen
talism with an analogy.
"Sustainability should not be
the goal," Shellenberger said. "No
one wants to have a 'sustainable'
marriage. You want a beautiful
marriage, a loving marriage."
Roosevelt Institution member
and sophomore Lyuba Wolf posed
the final question, asking what
Stanford students could do to con
tribute to the environmental cause.
Both speakers agreed that stu
dents must discuss ideas and mobi
lize to create change.
"Take over now, right now,"
Werbach said. "Your ideas are so
desperately needed."
Members of the Roosevelt In
stitution said they felt the presen
tation was not only informative,
but also reflected the overall goals
of the group.
"The Roosevelt Institution's vi
sion is about not only bringing stu
dents' ideas to political movers and
shakers; it's also about bringing
the movers and shakers here,"
Roosevelt Institution Communica
tions Director and sophomore
Vilas Rao said. "Our country is
longing for new innovative ideas.
We just have to get out there."
Roosevelt Institution Events
Director Kevin Hilke, a sopho
more, said he appreciated the
speakers' broad perspectives.
"They articulated a vision for
the progressive movement not just
limited to traditional environmen
tal problems," Hilke said. "Affect
ing change on a national and glob
al scale is how they're approaching
ideas. By changing things on a
more comprehensive scale, we can
have a much larger effect."
