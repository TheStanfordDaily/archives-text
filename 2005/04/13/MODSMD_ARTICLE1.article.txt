## ASSU ready for new era 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
Many senator-elects attended last night's ASSU
Undergraduate Senate meeting to watch current
ASSU Executive President Chioke Borgelt-Mose, a
junior, deliver her State of the Association speech, dur
ing which she highlighted the accomplishments of the
student government over the past year. The meeting
also focused on budget modification and the allocation
of general funding to student groups.
While Borgelt-Mose focused her remarks on past
achievement, she also offered suggestions for what
next year's administration.
"It goes without saying that the administration and
rules committee hs worked continuously through this
year," Borgelt-Mose said. "I am very impressed by the
committee's determination."
She also commended the appropriations committee
for its work with student groups and funding requests,
as well as the communications committee.
"Improving communications is one of the hardest
things for the ASSU to do," Borgelt-Mose said. "Com
munication with the student body will continue to be a
lot stronger in the future."
She also touched on the need to restructure and im
prove the Nominations Commission, and encouraged
the new Senate to continue the dialogue on student
housing and space with University administrators.
"You owe it to your fellow students and to the Uni
versity as a whole to continue to work for the better
ment of the University," Borgelt-Mose said.
Elections Commissioner Troy Steinmetz, a sopho
more, presented the 2(X)5 ASSU election results to the
Senate and voiced his satisfaction with the absence of
post-election problems.
"Thank you to everyone who voted," he said. "As
of right now, I'm not aware of any crises or impending
controversies, which is great."
Several bills concerning budget appropriations and
modifications were then brought before the Senate.
A representative from the Stanford Canoe and
Kayak Team explained the complications and costs of
obtaining new equipment in response to the appropri
ation committee's recommendation that no money be
allocated to the team for new beginner boats.
The Senate decided to recommend $ 1,850 in fund
ing to the team, and all other bills were approved.
Several wording changes were made to the Sen
ate's by-laws to accommodate the recently passed
Measure A — which combined
the programming and community
funds into a single general fees
fund — and the new election in
validation procedure.
The Senate also passed a bill to
make April 24 the official com
memoration of the 90th anniversary
of the Armenian genocide in 1915.
Before the vote, several senators
said they were worried that the
issue was too political to be voted
upon by the Senate.
