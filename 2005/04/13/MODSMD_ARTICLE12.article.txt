ered an article about the support for
the l ootl for Peace program by Ore
gon Congresswoman Edith (ireen,
combating the threat of Communism
spreading to poor nations. Below is
an excerpt:
"The great and compelling ap
peal of America must be its immense
agricultural capacity, a power more
potent in a hungry world than all the
nuclear bombs ever manufactured,
Congresswoman Edith Green told
the Tuesday Evening Series.
"Most of the world cannot afford
the luxury of ideological conflicts,
she declared. The offer of freedom
from Communist dictatorship is not
compelling to people suffering from
economic and social oppression.
"Mrs. Green advocated the for
mation of a Farmers Corps as pro
posed by Senator McGovern to
share agricultural techniques with
underdeveloped countries. For the
United .States to spend $2 billion to
reduce agricultural production must

seem criminal to those dying of
hunger.
"Admiring the Food for Peace
program instituted in 1954, Mrs.
Green warned against sinking back
into complacency and self satisfac
tion. She noted that in 1965 the U.S.
spent four times more on defense.
"The United States now has the
possibility to combat famine in
India. Mrs. Green recalled the
Berlin airlift supplies for $266 mil
lion. It was a relatively inexpensive
gesture, yet it represented a brilliant
chapter in the struggle against Com
munism."
On April 13, 1971, I he Daily cov
ered a story about the challenge
against 'sexist-racist' policies of Stan
ford University. Below is an excerpt:
"President Lyman, Provost
Miller, the deans of undergraduate
and graduate admissions, Fred Har
gadon and Lincoln Moses, and the
board of Trustees have been named
as defendants in a lawsuit which

challenges alleged sexist-racist Uni
versity policies.
"According to Dr. Nancy Jewell
Cross, a Stanford alumna, and a co
plaintiff in the suit, "the Court is
being asked to issue a temporary re
straining order and an order to show
cause, a preliminary injunction, and
permanent injunction against imme
diately threatened sex-race privi
leged admission and financial aid
distributions.
"Dr. Cross and her co-plaintiff,
Linda Crouse, a system programmer
at the medical center cited the
founding grant of Stanford Universi
ty which says 'The Trustees shall
have the power and it shall be their
duty to afford equal facilities and
give equal advantages to the Univer
sity to both sexes.
"Dr. Cross sharply criticized
the undergraduate admissions pol
icy which allegedly establishes
quotas before application are re
ceived. [She] asserted, 'Without
collating qualifications of appli
cants competitively, defendant
dean of admissions announced the
freshman class at Stanford Univer
sity for fall 1971 would consist of
500 women, 900 men, 75 blacks, 71
Mexican-Americans and 21 Amer
ican Indians.'
"Dr. Cross's charges of sexist and
racist policies comes during the vfery
week that high school seniors are no
tified of their acceptance. Despite
the legal action taken by Dr. Cross
the undergraduate admissions office
reported that notices of acceptances
were mailed yesterday."
