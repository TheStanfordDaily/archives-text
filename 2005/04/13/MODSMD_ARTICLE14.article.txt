# But that's not the point...
## Just call me 'Headband'

My kindred spirit Angela
Chase once said, "It just
seems like you agree to have
a certain personality or something.
For no reason. Just to make things
easier for everyone. But when you
think about it... how do you know
it's even you?" Teen angst aside, I
suspect that Angela, as usual, was
speaking the truth.
When I was in high school, I never
let my real self shine through. A liber
al living in a mostly conservative com
munity, I found myself at Bible study
gatherings and in Girl Scout meet
ings, trying to understand my peers'
commitment to these values and be
lief systems in order to feel a little
more part of the group. But of course
none of it worked. I decided to come
to Stanford because I suspected that
here, I could become the person I
wanted to be, whoever that was.
In some ways, I've managed to de
fine myself over the past four years,
but not as a coherent, cohesive indi-

vidual. Rather, I've
gotten much better
about letting my lit
tle personality
quirks stand out —
and a lot more
comfortable show
ing off my neu
roses, as this col
umn proves.
But it's not just

that I ve gotten comfortable with my
neuroses —I've also managed to
pick up more of them. College might
be when you find yourself, but it's
also, at least for me, the time for pick
ing up weird habits, phobias and para
noias. Case in point: I overmedicate
myself. The second I have a symptom
of a cold I go straight to the pharmacy
department at Safeway and buy 20
bucks worth of Zinc lozenges and at
least two different types of Advil. I
never did this in high school.
On a related note, it's in college
that I've really developed my
hypochondria. I've learned from the
best: One of my good friends is gener
ally paranoid of every kind of sick
ness, including developing random al
lergies that have sent her to the hospi
tal. I used to only be afraid of mono
and meningitis, but now I'm off to
Vaden whenever I feel a scratch in my
throat.
Many of the quirks I've picked up
weren't even close to being mine to
begin with. I never used to be afraid
of birds, for example, but thanks to
my friend who is terrified of them, I'm
now afraid of flocks of birds (al
though the occasional sparrow
doesn't frighten me a bit). I never
gave a thought to feet before, but now
I'm somewhat grossed out by a non
pumiced heel.
My quirks aren't all bizarre or
medical — I suppose I've also picked
up a taste for hip hop and for arts and
crafts. I never used to cry in movies,
but now I am at the point where I cry
at the previews for movies. My shop
ping fanaticism, the subject of last
week's column, has definitely been
guided into fruition by that same
friend who taught me to fear feet —
ironically, it is thanks to her that I
have a couple pairs of great shoes.
Another quirk that I cannot claim
original ownership of is the use of "In
ternet-speak" in real life, such as the
ever-present "J / K " or the much
scorned "BRB." Although that's
pretty bad, it could be worse. One of
my dad's friends in high school was
named Headband because every sin
gle day he wore a headband and
bathrobe. I could have picked that up.
Sometimes 1 wonder how I man
aged to absorb all of my friends' pho
bias and oddities. Maybe I'm just im
pressionable. What I can't figure out
is why this malleability doesn't seem
to apply in classes. In the case of
quirks, however, I'm like a sponge. I
guess it's just that when you live with
people, you start to see things the way
they see them, without even meaning
to. It's like realizing that a really bad
song is stuck in your head, and not
only do you not know where you
heard it last, but you realize you know
all the words.
I know I'm supposed to graduate
with a new, broader way of perceiving
the world, but I feel like I haven't got
ten that from classes. You can't tell
me to have an open mind; it just has to
happen. Picking up all these new neu
roses has led me to see beyond my
own narrow perspective more than
any class could teach me — it's just
given me some weird issues in the bar
gain.

Got a weird quirk you feel like sharing?

but now I am at the point where I cry
at the previews for movies. My shop
ping fanaticism, the subject of last
week's column, has definitely been
guided into fruition by that same
friend who taught me to fear feet —
ironically, it is thanks to her that I
have a couple pairs of great shoes.
Another quirk that I cannot claim
original ownership of is the use of "In
ternet-speak" in real life, such as the
ever-present "J / K " or the much
scorned "BRB." Although that's
pretty bad, it could be worse. One of
my dad's friends in high school was
named Headband because every sin
gle day he wore a headband and
bathrobe. I could have picked that up.
Sometimes 1 wonder how I man
aged to absorb all of my friends' pho
bias and oddities. Maybe I'm just im
pressionable. What I can't figure out
is why this malleability doesn't seem
to apply in classes. In the case of
quirks, however, I'm like a sponge. I
guess it's just that when you live with
people, you start to see things the way
they see them, without even meaning
to. It's like realizing that a really bad
song is stuck in your head, and not
only do you not know where you
heard it last, but you realize you know
all the words.
I know I'm supposed to graduate
with a new, broader way of perceiving
the world, but I feel like I haven't got
ten that from classes. You can't tell
me to have an open mind; it just has to
happen. Picking up all these new neu
roses has led me to see beyond my
own narrow perspective more than
any class could teach me — it's just
given me some weird issues in the bar
gain.

Got a weird quirk you feel like sharing?
