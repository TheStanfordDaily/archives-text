# Legacy admissions: does family history at the Farm matter?
## 
### NOAH WEISS STAFF WRITER 
They are the students who have owned a Stanford sweatshirt of every size, from a baby small to tin
adult large; went to nursery school in Escondido Village; and were in the stands to watch the Big Game
when "The Play" put a sour end to Elway's collegiate career.
They are the children of alumni.
At Harvard, their acceptance rate was 4() percent in 2003. At Princeton, 35 percent and at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, 41 percent. With acceptance rates at these top universities in the low teens,
legacy applicants are more than three times as likely than other students to receive thick admission
packages.
Cornell University even sends children of alumni letters encouraging them to apply.
Unlike all of the Ivy League schools, which now fully disclose their legacy admission statistics, Stan
ford does not report on both the percentage of legacy applicants admitted and what percent of the
study body are children of alumni.
"We do not release any data that is broken down by any subgroup of applicants, whether broken
down by legacy connection, special talent, geography [or] academic interest," said Director of Ad
missions Anna Marie Porras.
The only legacy information Porras could divulge was that "each year [Stanford is] unable to

offer admission to the majority of legacy applicants."
At other top-tier universities like Harvard, Princeton and University of Pennsylvania, lega-

cy students on average make up about 13 percent of the student body.
In defense of Stanford's non-disclosure policy, Porras said, "This is not a practice in
place to keep legacy data private. This is a consistent and long standing practice for all sub
groups of applicants."

The Office of Undergraduate Admissions does, however, provide admission data of
ethnic- and racial-minority students. The class of2ooB is 8.45 percent Black and 10.82 per
cent Hispanic.

Legacies bring sense of tradition
It is argued that children of alumni bring a sense of tradition and a link to a school's

history that other students do not.
"This is a university that was founded by parents in memory of their child," Por-

ras said. "This is a community that honors family ties at its core but also rec
ognizes our important responsibility to invite new members into the Stan-

ford family."
Howard Wolf, president of the Stanford Alumni Association, sup
ports the legacy policy because it "provide[s] for intergenerational

transfer of loyalty to Stanford."
Moreover, "Stanford's legacy admission policy acknowledges the

vital role in support of one of the University's most valu
able stakeholders — its alumni," Wolf said.

Measuring the legacy factor
The extent to which legacy contributes to an appli
cant's admission varies across universities. At the Uni
versity of Michigan, applicants are rated on a "selec
tion index" of 150 points, where 100 points is usually
enough to be admitted; students with legacy receive
four points.
At Harvard, the admissions dean personally reads
every application from alumni children and uses the
legacy status "as a tie-breaker between comparable
candidates," according to a series of Pulitzer Prize
winning articles published by The Wall Street Journal
published in 2003.
Stanford uses a similar approach in evaluating possi
ble applicants.
"Among equally qualified candidates, [legacy]
could be a plus factor," Porras said. "Such considera
tion, however, is never enough to admit a student who
would not be compelling in our process without such
consideration."

Porras emphasized that by no means do legacy consid
erations compromise the academic standards Stanford to which it
holds admitted students.

"Legacy is an additional factor that is considered in an application," she said. "It does not sub
stitute for academic success in high school and preparation for the rigors of Stanford."
One freshman, who asked to be called "Tom" to maintain his family's privacy, believed that
legacy played a much bigger factor.
"I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't closely read the essays on my application," Tom said. "I
think the legacy overshadows everything else. As long as you have halfway decent grades and can
be near the top of your class in high school, you can make it."
Tom's legacy spans four generations and includes 10 people, from his great-great grandfather

and great-great uncle in the 1910s, to him and his two cousins who are currently students. He said he
thought that the weight legacy has in admission considerations was evident in his application.
"The only spot on the entire application form where they said 'attach another sheet if you need
more space' was the 'relatives at Stanford' space," Tom said. "I needed to attach another sheet."
In his high school's history, the only other student Stanford admitted was a football player on an
athletic scholarship.
"Without the legacy factor, I would not have gotten in here," said Tom, even though he was salu
tatorian. "But now that I'm here, I feel like I fit in. And who knows, maybe this will show Stanford that
kids from my area can make it here."
Freshman David Sinsky had similarly suspect feelings about the importance of legacy, even though
his family's record paled in comparison to Tom's. Sinsky has a sister who is currently a junior and a dad
who attended Stanford in the 19705.
"When they asked for the graduation date [of my dad], I had to leave that blank," Sinsky said.
"Hopefully my kids won't have to do that for me, but at the rate I'm going, you never know."
Sinsky attributed much of his admission to his sister.
"Part of the reason my sister helped me was that we had a lot of the same test scores, even though
she's a lot smarter than me," Sinsky said. "After they accepted her, it probably made it harder for them
to reject me."
Trade Stanford a building for an admission?
Another special group of applicants are those students whose families have been major donors to
the University. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal published on April 13,2003, former Dean
of Admissions Robin Mamlet said, "I will certainly factor in a history of very significant giving to Stan
ford." Each year, the Office of Development sends the admissions office a list of students whose fam
ilies have been major donors.
While the media has often depicted legacy admissions as affirmative action for wealthy white stu
dents, this image is changing.
"The legacy 1 pool is becoming more and more diverse," Porras said. "We have begun to see appli
cations from the children of alumni whose backgrounds were significantly underrepresented on cam-

pus before Stanford's successful affirmative-action programs of the 1970s and 1980s."
Alumni Association President Wolf noted, "Our alumni of color are as interested
in maintaining our legacy admission policy as are our majority alumni."
Wolf recalled that during the Minority Alumni Conference last spring, one

woman stood up during Mamlet's question-and-answer session in support of
continued attention to legacy. "Don't get rid of legacies, because it's our chil
dren now," she said, according to an article in the July 2004 issue of Stanford
Magazine.
"Her comment was met with a round of applause from the crowd,"
Wolf said.

Political pressure
Lately, there has been an upsurge in political criticism of legacy ad
missions. On Aug. 6,2004, CNN.com reported that President George
W. Bush, a Yale legacy admit, said admission should be based only on
merit and that there should be no "special exception for certain peo
ple."

In an article published on Oct. 29,2003, The Wall Street Journal re
ported on a bill introduced by Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-
Mass.), who was a legacy admit at Harvard, that would require col
leges "to report on the race and economic status of first-year stu
dents who are relatives of alumni."

With a history of calling for the end of legacy admissions,
Senator John Edwards (D-N.C.) was a key support-

er of the bill.
"Requiring these disclosures should encourage
colleges to take a hard look at a practice that tilts
the admissions process against the kids who face the
biggest obstacles," Edwards said.
Administrators at top universities balked at
having to hold their admissions process accountable

to the government. The bill has yet to be voted on.
Without government intervention, changing
the legacy admissions policy will be difficult.

Universities depend on their alumni for both
their financial support and their volunteer ef
forts. Many alumni feel tied to their alma mater
because they want to have their children follow
their legacy.
"The vast majority of legacy applicants are de
nied admission to Stanford," Wolf said. "We are
concerned and actively involved in creating real
istic expectations for the alumni parents of stu
dents who wish to apply by educating them as to
the competitive nature of the admission process."
The want — and the expectation — that one

might share her cherished Stanford experience with
her child is something most students and alumni have.
In 1982, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day

O'Connor, whose son Jay was a sophomore at the time and her
son Scott had graduated, succinctly expressed this desire in
her commencement address.
"You will all be lucky enough to have
your children attend this paradise on earth .
.. that we call Stanford," she said.

to reject me."
Trade Stanford a building for an admission?
Another special group of applicants are those students whose families have been major donors to
the University. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal published on April 13,2003, former Dean
of Admissions Robin Mamlet said, "I will certainly factor in a history of very significant giving to Stan
ford." Each year, the Office of Development sends the admissions office a list of students whose fam
ilies have been major donors.
While the media has often depicted legacy admissions as affirmative action for wealthy white stu
dents, this image is changing.
"The legacy 1 pool is becoming more and more diverse," Porras said. "We have begun to see appli
cations from the children of alumni whose backgrounds were significantly underrepresented on cam-

pus before Stanford's successful affirmative-action programs of the 1970s and 1980s."
Alumni Association President Wolf noted, "Our alumni of color are as interested
in maintaining our legacy admission policy as are our majority alumni."
Wolf recalled that during the Minority Alumni Conference last spring, one

woman stood up during Mamlet's question-and-answer session in support of
continued attention to legacy. "Don't get rid of legacies, because it's our chil
dren now," she said, according to an article in the July 2004 issue of Stanford
Magazine.
"Her comment was met with a round of applause from the crowd,"
Wolf said.

Political pressure
Lately, there has been an upsurge in political criticism of legacy ad
missions. On Aug. 6,2004, CNN.com reported that President George
W. Bush, a Yale legacy admit, said admission should be based only on
merit and that there should be no "special exception for certain peo
ple."

In an article published on Oct. 29,2003, The Wall Street Journal re
ported on a bill introduced by Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-
Mass.), who was a legacy admit at Harvard, that would require col
leges "to report on the race and economic status of first-year stu
dents who are relatives of alumni."

With a history of calling for the end of legacy admissions,
Senator John Edwards (D-N.C.) was a key support-

er of the bill.
"Requiring these disclosures should encourage
colleges to take a hard look at a practice that tilts
the admissions process against the kids who face the
biggest obstacles," Edwards said.
Administrators at top universities balked at
having to hold their admissions process accountable

to the government. The bill has yet to be voted on.
Without government intervention, changing
the legacy admissions policy will be difficult.

Universities depend on their alumni for both
their financial support and their volunteer ef
forts. Many alumni feel tied to their alma mater
because they want to have their children follow
their legacy.
"The vast majority of legacy applicants are de
nied admission to Stanford," Wolf said. "We are
concerned and actively involved in creating real
istic expectations for the alumni parents of stu
dents who wish to apply by educating them as to
the competitive nature of the admission process."
The want — and the expectation — that one

might share her cherished Stanford experience with
her child is something most students and alumni have.
In 1982, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day

O'Connor, whose son Jay was a sophomore at the time and her
son Scott had graduated, succinctly expressed this desire in
her commencement address.
"You will all be lucky enough to have
your children attend this paradise on earth .
.. that we call Stanford," she said.

They are the students who have owned a Stanford sweatshirt of every size, from a baby small to tin
adult large; went to nursery school in Escondido Village; and were in the stands to watch the Big Game
when "The Play" put a sour end to Elway's collegiate career.
They are the children of alumni.
At Harvard, their acceptance rate was 4() percent in 2003. At Princeton, 35 percent and at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, 41 percent. With acceptance rates at these top universities in the low teens,
legacy applicants are more than three times as likely than other students to receive thick admission
packages.
Cornell University even sends children of alumni letters encouraging them to apply.
Unlike all of the Ivy League schools, which now fully disclose their legacy admission statistics, Stan
ford does not report on both the percentage of legacy applicants admitted and what percent of the
study body are children of alumni.
"We do not release any data that is broken down by any subgroup of applicants, whether broken
down by legacy connection, special talent, geography [or] academic interest," said Director of Ad
missions Anna Marie Porras.
The only legacy information Porras could divulge was that "each year [Stanford is] unable to

offer admission to the majority of legacy applicants."
At other top-tier universities like Harvard, Princeton and University of Pennsylvania, lega-

cy students on average make up about 13 percent of the student body.
In defense of Stanford's non-disclosure policy, Porras said, "This is not a practice in
place to keep legacy data private. This is a consistent and long standing practice for all sub
groups of applicants."

The Office of Undergraduate Admissions does, however, provide admission data of
ethnic- and racial-minority students. The class of2ooB is 8.45 percent Black and 10.82 per
cent Hispanic.

Legacies bring sense of tradition
It is argued that children of alumni bring a sense of tradition and a link to a school's

history that other students do not.
"This is a university that was founded by parents in memory of their child," Por-

ras said. "This is a community that honors family ties at its core but also rec
ognizes our important responsibility to invite new members into the Stan-

ford family."
Howard Wolf, president of the Stanford Alumni Association, sup
ports the legacy policy because it "provide[s] for intergenerational

transfer of loyalty to Stanford."
Moreover, "Stanford's legacy admission policy acknowledges the

vital role in support of one of the University's most valu
able stakeholders — its alumni," Wolf said.

Measuring the legacy factor
The extent to which legacy contributes to an appli
cant's admission varies across universities. At the Uni
versity of Michigan, applicants are rated on a "selec
tion index" of 150 points, where 100 points is usually
enough to be admitted; students with legacy receive
four points.
At Harvard, the admissions dean personally reads
every application from alumni children and uses the
legacy status "as a tie-breaker between comparable
candidates," according to a series of Pulitzer Prize
winning articles published by The Wall Street Journal
published in 2003.
Stanford uses a similar approach in evaluating possi
ble applicants.
"Among equally qualified candidates, [legacy]
could be a plus factor," Porras said. "Such considera
tion, however, is never enough to admit a student who
would not be compelling in our process without such
consideration."

Porras emphasized that by no means do legacy consid
erations compromise the academic standards Stanford to which it
holds admitted students.

"Legacy is an additional factor that is considered in an application," she said. "It does not sub
stitute for academic success in high school and preparation for the rigors of Stanford."
One freshman, who asked to be called "Tom" to maintain his family's privacy, believed that
legacy played a much bigger factor.
"I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't closely read the essays on my application," Tom said. "I
think the legacy overshadows everything else. As long as you have halfway decent grades and can
be near the top of your class in high school, you can make it."
Tom's legacy spans four generations and includes 10 people, from his great-great grandfather

and great-great uncle in the 1910s, to him and his two cousins who are currently students. He said he
thought that the weight legacy has in admission considerations was evident in his application.
"The only spot on the entire application form where they said 'attach another sheet if you need
more space' was the 'relatives at Stanford' space," Tom said. "I needed to attach another sheet."
In his high school's history, the only other student Stanford admitted was a football player on an
athletic scholarship.
"Without the legacy factor, I would not have gotten in here," said Tom, even though he was salu
tatorian. "But now that I'm here, I feel like I fit in. And who knows, maybe this will show Stanford that
kids from my area can make it here."
Freshman David Sinsky had similarly suspect feelings about the importance of legacy, even though
his family's record paled in comparison to Tom's. Sinsky has a sister who is currently a junior and a dad
who attended Stanford in the 19705.
"When they asked for the graduation date [of my dad], I had to leave that blank," Sinsky said.
"Hopefully my kids won't have to do that for me, but at the rate I'm going, you never know."
Sinsky attributed much of his admission to his sister.
"Part of the reason my sister helped me was that we had a lot of the same test scores, even though
she's a lot smarter than me," Sinsky said. "After they accepted her, it probably made it harder for them
to reject me."
