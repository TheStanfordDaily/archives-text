I "It's hard to say because at a private
> university, a lot is dependent on the
alumni family, but [admitting lega
cies] picks up a bad reputation as

"No. It should be based completely
on merit. I see a lot of rich kids who
get into good schools and don't real
ly appreciate it."
PHIL MIESZKOWSKI,
Ist year Masters Student in Civil Engineering


"I don't think it should be taken into
account — legacy students should
have the same opportunities, but not
greater."
LAURA BILLADELLO,
junior, Human Biology


"I think they should just look at
what people have accomplished.
Family ties are important for fam
ilies, not universities."
NICK CASEY,
senior, Anthropological Sciences
