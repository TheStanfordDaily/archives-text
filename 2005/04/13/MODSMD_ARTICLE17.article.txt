## Editorial University's Community Day doesn't achieve professed goal 
### 
On Sunday, hundreds of Stanford's neighbors
streamed down Palm Drive to be greeted by Univer
sity administrators and some student groups. Howev
er, among those enjoying the event, Stanford students
were few and far between.
Stanford bills Community Day as a day "designed
to promote partnerships and increase understanding
among Stanford and its neighbors," but there's little
to encourage students to participate in the event,
which features student performances, academic pre
sentations and talks by University administrators.
It is true that the University offers incentives for
student-group participation. For instance. Communi
ty Day organizers offer grants every year to student
groups to create interactive displays. This year, 30 stu
dent groups to participated in Community Day. These
sorts of funding and outreach opportunities are com
mendable, but that is the effective extent of the stu
dent involvement in Community Day.
If the University's goal for Community Day is to
truly increase "understanding among Stanford and its
neighbors," it needs to work to get all students out and
mingle with local residents. For the last three years, no
activities at Community Day have been aimed to at
tract Stanford students, nor have there been enter
tainment to draw that demographic to the event.
For an event like Community Day, students should
want to attend. The event is usually on a picturesque
day early in spring quarter, so students are not bur
dened by work. And the University wants to prove
what a fun place it is, another reason to expect stu
dents to turn out. However, by failing to offer any stu-

dent-focused entertainment, organizers effectively
tells regular students that their participation is not a
priority. This, in turn, hides the majority of the student
body.
The University's stated goal may not be entirely in
line with its actual goal. Some believe the University's
primary goal is to use Community Day as a vehicle to
decrease the ongoing tension between Stanford and
its neighbors. But without greater student involve
ment and attendance. Community Day is really only
about a small part of Stanford life. Simply sharing a
superficial glimpse of the University is not likely to
improve relationships between Stanford and its
neighbors.
Making Community Day an event that attracts fac
ulty, staff and students will allow local residents to see
the diversity and energy of the campus population.
This, in turn, should make them a little more tolerant
of the inconveniences that are created by living near a
large university.
And getting students to turn out is not that diffi
cult. Organizers just need to spend more time think
ing about the kind of activities that students want to
participate in. Providing free food on a Sunday, when
some cafeterias do not offer lunch, or putting on more
student entertainment would be a start.
Community Day, in its current form, does a good
job. But it's not enough. Community Day ought to be
about uniting neighbors, and without more student in
volvement, a huge portion of the campus population
is being left out.
