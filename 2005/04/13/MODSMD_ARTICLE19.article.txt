## Social Insecurity 
### 
There are so many problems with I
Social Security and Medicare that 1
could fill this entire column without
including a single joke about Soylent
Green.
First, there is no Social Security
trust fund. All the money that comes
into the system from payroll taxes
that is not paid out as benefits is
loaned out to the government. The
government is basically writing an

1.0. U. to itself. When Social Security decides to cash the
1.0. U., the spent money won t magically reappear. The
government will just have to go further into debt or cut
spending in other areas to pay Social Security back.
This means payroll taxes (which are supposed to go to
Social Security and Medicare) are like any other taxes.
They go to pay for the military and for high schools and
Pell Grants. But they are only levied on the first $89,000
of income. This makes them somewhat regressive. A ma
jority of Americans pay more in payroll taxes than in in
come taxes, but to those who are very rich these payroll
taxes are barely a drop in the bucket. If we want the poor
to pay for everyone's retirement, that's fine, but let's at
least admit it.
Second, current retirees get way more back from the
system than they put in. Even if they had invested that
money instead of paying it in, they are still making
money from Social Security
Third, the number of retirees is going to skyrocket. Not

only will the number of checks being mailed out have to in
crease, but since older folks require more healthcare the
cost of medical care will increase as well. Thiseffect will not
be felt in 2042, when the trust fund runs out, or in 2018,
when benefits exceed payroll taxes. It is being felt now, and
will be felt from now until that day when the majority of the
baby boomers have died off. A larger and larger portion of
the budget will go towards these programs, leaving less
money for other things.
There are only three ways to make the system sol
vent. First, the comedy option: Eat all the old people.
And then there are some very simple solutions: In
crease the retirement age, lower benefits and raise taxes.
When Social Security was created, the average life ex
pectancy was 65. People were expected to work until
near death. Now, average life expectancy is around 75.
People expect golden years of leisure and golf. This is
nice, but perhaps not reasonable. Benefits right now are
tied to increases in wages, rather than increases in infla
tion. This means that retirees live in a manner compara
ble to modern workers rather than a manner comparable
to when they were workers. Finally, the payroll tax
should be eliminated, and the budget should be balanced
through a general income tax increase.
Of course none of these things will happen, so I vote
for just ignoring the problem.
