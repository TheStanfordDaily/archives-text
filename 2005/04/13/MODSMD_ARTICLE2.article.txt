sion hosted at the Harold and Libby
Ziff Center for Jewish Campus Life
Monday after a heated conversation
about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Three employees of the worldwide
organization Israel at Heart, a group
that educates college students about
life in Israel, discussed their experi

personally.

nightlife, the food â€” people don't
know about it. We want people to un
