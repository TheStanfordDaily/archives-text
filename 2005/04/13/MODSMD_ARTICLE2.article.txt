# Muslim leaders leave Israel event
## 
### LAURA CARWILE 
Two leaders in the Stanford Mus
lim community walked out of a discus
sion hosted at the Harold and Libby
Ziff Center for Jewish Campus Life
Monday after a heated conversation
about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Three employees of the worldwide
organization Israel at Heart, a group
that educates college students about
life in Israel, discussed their experi
ences in and perspectives on the Mid
dle Eastern country where they have
lived for several years.
Merav Mov is a 23-year-old woman
who served in the Israeli National
Guard; Shlomit Aylin, also 23, immi-

grated to Israel from Ethiopia at age
three; and Eytan Schwartz, a 30-year
old game show winner. The three
spoke on both the major social and po
litical issues in Israel today, as well as
what Judaism means to each of them
personally.
"We want people to know about
the vibrant life in Israel," Schwartz
said. "The hangouts, the sports, the
nightlife, the food — people don't
know about it. We want people to un
derstand how much we love living in Is
rael."

Palestinians came up later in the con-

versation. Senior Rania Eltom, presi
dent of the Muslim Students Aware
ness Network, and sophomore Omar
Shakir. Co-president of the Coalition
for Justice in the Middle East, left the
event following several comments that
they said they found disrespectful.
"I was requested to attend the event
by organizers the day before, so I came
out of respect for them." Eltom said.
"However, when we entered the event,
it was made very obvious that we were
outsiders. As soon as the speakers start

ed generalizing Palestinians as wanting
to kill all soldiers, it hit a nerve within
me, especially [since it was) one day
after three Palestinian school kids were
shot dead by Israeli soldiers."
Eltom added that she was very of
fended when the speakers talked
about how suicide bombers are glori
fied in Palestinian classrooms.
"1 had to leave instead of engaging
in an argument that might compromise
my dignity and the event." she said.
Shakir said he was also upset by the
atmosphere at the discussion.
"I walked into this event to gain in
sight and because I was curious to learn
more about the topic of Israeli life," he
said. "But I left the event because I felt
disrespected and insulted at the fact

that the first thing I saw as I walked into
the Ziff Center was a flyer showing that
three out of the first four events in Hil
lel's programming for the quarter in
volves blasting the Islamic faith."
He cited an event scheduled for
next Monday entitled "The Trouble
with Islam."
"Dialogue and cooperation re
quires mutual respect, and the direc
tion this organization has taken has
made me feel that such respect simply
does not exist on that side," Shakir
said.
All three speakers said that they
were disappointed when they saw
Eltom and Shakir get up to leave.
"I don't understand why they left,"
Avlin said. "We wanted to talk to

them, and we wanted to discuss
things."
Mov and Schwartz said they were
frustrated by the situation.
"We are here to engage in dia
logue." Schwartz said. "We are not
here working for the Israeli govern
ment. We are regular people with per
sonal experiences who just want to talk
about the situation. Our goal is not to
lay blame or distort facts. It is to pro
mote peace."
Freshman Roei Kashi. who orga
nized the event, said that it is hard to
accomplish any of these goals without
g(xxl communication.
"It's hard to talk about these is
sues," he said. "There are emotions in
volved and I understand that. Howev

er, 1 think we should be able to discuss
them; nothing is accomplished when
no one is willing to talk about it. 1 feel
like this was an example of how I never
have a partner to speak to about the
conflict because no one is willing to lis
ten to the other side."
Mov and Aylin said that their main
goal at the event was to demonstrate to
students that the images of the Israeli
army they see on television are not al
ways correct.
"What 1 want is that when people
see Israeli soldiers on the television. 1
want them to see us." Mov said. "To
see that the Israeli and Palestinian sol
diers have faces and lives, and that all
anyone wants is understanding, com
munication and peace."

lay blame or distort facts. It is to pro
mote peace."
Freshman Roei Kashi. who orga
nized the event, said that it is hard to
accomplish any of these goals without
g(xxl communication.
"It's hard to talk about these is
sues," he said. "There are emotions in
volved and I understand that. Howev

er, 1 think we should be able to discuss
them; nothing is accomplished when
no one is willing to talk about it. 1 feel
like this was an example of how I never
have a partner to speak to about the
conflict because no one is willing to lis
ten to the other side."
Mov and Aylin said that their main
goal at the event was to demonstrate to
students that the images of the Israeli
army they see on television are not al
ways correct.
"What 1 want is that when people
see Israeli soldiers on the television. 1
want them to see us." Mov said. "To
see that the Israeli and Palestinian sol
diers have faces and lives, and that all
anyone wants is understanding, com
munication and peace."
