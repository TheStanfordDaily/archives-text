# Op-Ed
## The 						face of our community 
### BERNARD FRAGA, AMANDA JOHNSON GASPER MARTINEZ 
Members of the Latino community at Stanford are
proud that Stanford has been ranked as the number one
institution for Latinos, despite what last week's article
("Stanford ranked No. 1 for Hispanics." April 6) may
have suggested. As Stanford has won the award for the
past four years in a row, we feel honored that our uni
versity has taken such great care in fostering and nurtur
ing our community, allowing it to become nuestra comu
nidad for so many Latinos on campus.
In fact, the Latino community and El Centro Chicano
have come to serve as the benchmark for many other
Latino communities at other universities, including the
University of Southern California and Purdue. More
than anything, we feel the award is a reflection on other
ethnic communities on campus, who also garner respect
nationally and a commitment of support from the ad
ministration.
Within the Latino community, however, problems do
exist. However, the best way to resolve them is to do so
constructively, through communication and resolution
with others within the community, something we active
ly do through events like "Checking the Box." Our com
munity also attempts to reach out to all students who
have not previously been active in the Latino communi
ty, in addition to attempting to resolve conflicts and en
sure a growing community that can be enjoyed by any
one. With new organizations being created every year,
we attempt to outreach to all sectors of campus, in addi
tion to holding traditional events such as Zoot Suit Week
and Floricanto. Active dialogue is the top priority for our
community.

In the article written last week, three Latinos were in
terviewed from the same dormitory by the reporter, re
sulting in an unrepresentative cross-section of the Latino
community; conclusions about student sentiment cannot
be drawn by simply quoting a handful of students who
are convenient. The timing of the article was poor, con
sidering that the Latino community, along with the Stu
dents of Color Coalition, was campaigning heavily for
MEChA's Special Fee, one of the primary monetary
sources for the Latino community.
Although we are very active members of the commu
nity, this should in no way be seen as a requirement for
inclusion in the Latino community. Rather, we encour
age all students to participate in their own way they feel
comfortable. The Latino community is very diverse, con
sisting of students from nearly every Latin American
country and many non-Latinos as well. Our events are
welcoming to everyone. Latino or not, leading us to be
lieve that our events are not only for the Latinos on cam
pus, but for all of Stanford in general.
In conclusion, this op-ed is not meant to be an attack
on the individual students who were quoted in The Daily
story, but rather the presentation of a vision of our com
munity shared by three very different members who ap
preciate and enjoy what the Latino community has to
offer Stanford. We feel that being active in our commu
nity is, in fact, being active at Stanford â€” the two are not
mutually exclusive.
