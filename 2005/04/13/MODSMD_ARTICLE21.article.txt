## Campus Democracy 
### 
"It all comes
down to turnout."
That was the pre
diction a running
mate of mine
made in the hours
before the polls
opened. "If peo
ple we know de
cide to vote, we
win."

If his theory holds, then either we
don't know that many people or peo
ple just don't vote. And I know a lot of
people.
Sorry, this whole thing isn't me on
my high horse crying about how
democracy failed me last week, but it
is me on my high horse crying about
how people, in general, just don't vote.
The reasons to vote far outweigh
the reasons not to. It's free. It's fun. It's
easy. It's digital. And the computer
thanks you for doing it at the end. Who
doesn't like a thank you?
The negatives: It takes up time, and
perhaps you don't know enough
about the candidates and issues.
Voting will always take up time;
there's no way around that, and
frankly, there shouldn't be a way
around that. Citizens of a community
ought to take the time to become in
formed on issues that matter to the
community (i.e. issues and candidates
on the ballot) and there's a real easy
way to make sure this happens:
mandatory voting.
On the face of it, this looks a bit,
well, scary. Forcing people to vote?
That seems more authoritarian than
democratic, and would it really lead to
a better outcome?
In the case of campus elections, the
answer is absolutely yes. Should peo
ple be compelled to vote, they would
vote for their friends and for issues
that they have at least a passing inter
est in supporting. And that's what
campus elections ought to be about —
friends and community.

To get off my high horse and beat a
dead one, there are few real issues that
face the ASSU, and there are even
fewer real issues that faced voters in
last week's elections.
According to official tallies, 3,572
undergraduates and 1,324 graduate
students voted last week. Not bad for
the young'uns — downright pathetic
for the grads.
Perhaps all you molecular pharma
cology grad students don't know very
much about the bio-chem grad student
running for the Graduate Student
Council, but that's your own fault. Get
out of your lab and meet him.
Forcing people to vote would ener
gize campaigns and make the process
more competitive. If candidates knew
that the entire student body is looking
at them and judging them, they are li
able to refine their campaigns and
make their case to voters based on is
sues that they can affect.
Alternatively, it would prompt
only the wittiest of campaign slogans
to garner votes. No offense, but no, 1
can't "Hendel it."
The argument for mandatory vot
ing is even more applicable when it
comes to special fees. This is money
that the ASSU is going to take out of
your pocket and give to student
groups whether you vote or not. If ev
erybody were to vote, then perhaps
the special fees we all pay would more
accurately reflect the community we
want. This would reduce refunds (as
only groups that are widely regarded
as integral to the community would re
ceive funds) and ensure the long-term
viability of the special fees system.
Other democracies have mandato
ry voting, and while Stanford isn't ex
actly a democracy, this would be a way
to improve ASSU elections.
And the Chappie slate might actu
ally win. That would be the best thing
to ever happen to the ASSU.
