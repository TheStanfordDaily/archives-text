## Beating Arnold 
### KAI STINCHCOMBE 
Six months ago. Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger seemed unbeatable.
Thanks to sky-high approval ratings, in
ternational celebrity status ;ind a pliant
media, no amount of criticism seemed to
stick to him. Today, he is looking more
beatable than ever.
A campaign by the teachers, nurses
and firefighters unions against his retire
ment-privatization plan didn't melt away
like previous challenges, and he's been
forced to back down.
This weekend, the California Demo
cratic Party will convene in Los Angeles
with an eye toward the 2(X)6 gubernato
rial election. A formerly almost-empty
field of Democratic hopefuls is now
quickly thickening.
If Democrats want to retake the gov
ernorship, they must perform five tasks.
First, they must make the case against
Schwarzenegger. This Ls not very hard.
People voted for Arnold because he said
he had a secret plan to close the budget
gap without cutting education. Two
years later, he's raided the voter-man
dated education budget twice — after
promising not to and then promising it
was a one-time thing — and still hasn't
figured out how to close the deficit.
Schwarzenegger ran as a miracle
worker and has governed as a panderer.
He's promised, but he hasn't produced.
When he said he had a plan, he was lying.
Second, Democrats need to reestab
lish trust with the taxpayer.
Proposition 55, which would have re
duced the threshold for passing a budget
in the Democratic-controlled state as
sembly from two-thirds to 55 percent,
was recently voted down overwhelming
ly by the people. This means that most
people voted for Democrats, but most

people don't want to let them write the
budget.
No Democrat will be able to govern
effectively without public confidence
that his proposals are a good use of tax
payer money. This may mean, for the
time being, scaling back more ambitious
proposals for healthcare, pensions and
environmental protection in favor of
lowering taxes — because any Demo
crat who is seen as indifferent to the busi
ness climate will get nowhere on these is
sues anyhow.
Third, they must make a positive case
for government. California's success in
the global economy has rested on excel
lent public investment. Without an edu
cated workforce, we cannot create jobs
and remain as the high-tech capital of the
world. The infrastructure that makes it
cheaper to ship produce from California
to Mexico City than from most parts of
Mexico Is overburdened and decaying,
and it will not indefinitely support a
growing, export-driven economy. Police
using donated surplus old-model radios
cannot fight crime. While every dollar
spent must be justified to the taxpayer,
the Republican plan to slash investment
and lower taxes will not produce long
term growth in a global economy.
Fourth, Democrats must embrace
political reform. The current system of
gerrymandered districts guarantees a
legislative majority, but it's a toothless
majority because the voters don't trust
the Democrats to pass laws. Honest
competition will stimulate both parlies
and result in better government, though
it will mean cleaning out some of the
dead wtxxl in Sacramento. Democrats
who oppose Schwarzenegger's redis
tricting proposal should come up with a
better plan. The rest should get on board.
Fifth, Democrats must be willing to

buck organized labor.
Firefighters and police officers deserve
a stable pension system, healthcare
would improve if there were more nurs
es and educators trusted with our chil
dren's future should be paid like the
professionals they are. But we shouldn't
break the bank with pensions, mandate
more nurses-per-patient when there's
already a shortage or protect the jobs of
unqualified teachers.
Some of labor's demands coincide with
the public interest, others do not. The first
Democrat who acknowledges that will
touch off a firestorm but it is a prerequisite
for establishing trust with the taxpayer and
proving to the public that government pro
grams are not union giveaways.
The people voted for Arnold be
cause they were sick of the business-as
usual Democrats in Sacramento and be
cause they liked what he was promising.
Arnold hasn't quite broken every
promise he made, but he's come close.
With record-low approval ratings, the
people are ready to ditch him. But unless
the Democrats learn to think outside the
mold and accomplish these five tasks —
starting this weekend in Los Angeles —
they'll drive the people right back into
Arnold's arms.
