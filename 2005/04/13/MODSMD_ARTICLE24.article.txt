Stanford's proposal lack "good and
safe connectivity"
The "agreements" to which Stanford
Community Relations Director Jean
McCown referred in the article "Trails
through campus debated" (April 7),
include a key meeting hack in Decem
ber 2002, at which the Santa Clara
Board of Supervisors caved in to the
bully boys from Stanford on this issue.
At that meeting the Board discreetly
voted to remove from further study
the two trails recommended by its
County Parks and Recreation staff, in
cluding the "Cherry Stem" route,
which was only minimally intrusive to
Stanford land.

The trails left for consideration
constitute inferior roadside pathways
that do not even start to approach the
good and safe connectivity to the
Arastradero preserve that is an implic
it requirement in the Stanford Gener
al Use Permit, or GUP.
The process leading up to the
Board's vote started with the intimida
tion described by the Palo Alto Week
ly. in its Sept. 18. 2002 editorial, as a
"full court press" by Stanford manage
ment. The Weekly noted that "no one
can recall any precedent for such high
level lobbying behind closed doors."
That was followed by a barrage of liti
gation threats fjom Stanfordfs army of
lawyers.

What is also of concern is that a
new precedent thus appears to have
been established — one where on an
issue ol primary concern to a given dis
trict. the Santa Clara Board no longer
defers broadly to the Supervisor for
that District. Thus the concerns of the
Palo Alto and Stanford communities
with Stanford foothills issues are like
ly to be effectively ignored, as they
were in this case. That has very serious
implications for the longer term, par
ticularly when we have Stanford man
agements whose values appear to mir
ror closely the current corporate ethic.
