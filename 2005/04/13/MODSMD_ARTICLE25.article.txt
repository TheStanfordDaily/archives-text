# RIAA cracks down on i2hub users
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Officials of the Recording Industry Associa
tion of America, or RIAA, anticipate filing law
suits against 405 unidentified students on IK
campuses nationwide, with a maximum of 25
students per school, on April 13, according to an
RIAA press release. These students, some of
whom attend the University of Southern Cali
fornia, UC San Diego, UC Berkeley and Har
vard, have illegally shared over 1.5 million files
total. Only the most egregious abusers — indi
viduals using i2hub who have shared on average
more than audio, software and video files
— will be affected in the initial lawsuits filed by
the RIAA.
The i2hub software is a "groundbreaking,
peer-to-peer solution proven effective for online
collaboration between students [and) is the first
and largest student community in the world." ac
cording to the company's website. The software
allows users connected by Internet 2 — a high
speed computer network available at more than
3(H) universities, including Stanford, and other
institutions — to copy music and movie files at
faster rates than with other available file-sharing
programs. A movie takes approximately 5 min
utes and a song takes approximately 20 seconds
to download using i2hub.
♦'We cannot let this high-speed network be
come a zone of lawlessness where the normal rules
don't apply," said Cary Sherman, president of
RIAA, in the press release. "We have worked
very constructively with the university communi
ty. improving educational effortsat colleges across
the country, expanding partnerships between
schools and legal online services and providing a
clearinghouse for expertise on technological anti
piracy solutions. We cannot let rampant illegal
downloading on Internet 2 jeopardize this collabo
rative work. By taking this initial action, we are
putting students and administrators everywhere
on notice that there are consequences for unlaw
ful uses of this special network."
Sherman, according to the press release, has
written letters to university presidents request
ing that their institutions stop current illegal file
distribution and explore means so that students
can share files legitimately. These letters have
not only been sent to the IK schools where stu
dents will be sued by the RIAA. but also to an
other 140 schools where the RIAA believes
copyright infringement has also occurred.
Wayne Chang, i2hub's founder and chief ex
ecutive officer, is currently on leave of absence

from the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst.
"|i2hub| does not condone activities and ac
tions that breach the rights of copyright own
ers," Chang said in an article printed yesterday
in The Los Angeles Times. "Our companies are
focused on bringing together students and con

necting them in ways never before achieved."
He added in ;in email to The Daily that i2hub
can he described as a hybrid between AOL In
stant Messenger and Internet Relay Chat. It is
based on open-source technology and does not
host any tiles centrally nor does it have any in
dexes of files on the network.
