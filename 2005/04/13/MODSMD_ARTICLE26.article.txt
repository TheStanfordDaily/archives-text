# Organization cites chicken-harming hormone as reason for protest
## PETA boycotts KFC chain 
### KEN TRAN DAILY TEXAN 
(U-WIRE) AUSTIN, Texas-
Three protesters for People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals held
signs reading "KFC is Cruelty" and
"Broken Legs and Wings," while a
person dressed in a chicken suit
crossed the street on crutches in ef
forts to protest against Kentucky
Fried Chicken and the inhumane
treatment of chickens used by the
chain.
The protest was meant to sym
bolize chickens whose legs broke
because their hormone-induced

growth rendered them unable to
support their own weight, said Chris
Link, campaign coordinator for
PETA. It was part of a tour the
group was taking to 12 cities in
Texas to raise awareness about
PF.TA's KFC boycott.
Derrick Walker, manager of the
KFC targeted by the protest, wor
ried that PETA was focusing on the
wrong issues.
"There's no nice way to kill a
chicken," he said. "We have more
important stuff to worry about, like
our soldiers overseas."
Walker said he didn't see why the
protesters were targeting KFC

when the chicken farms and proces
sors are committing the cruelty.
"Ain't no chicken comes in here still
alive," he said. "We don't kill
them."
Walker said he didn't think the
protest would have much impact on
business because it occurred at 3
p.m. "Maybe if they had done it dur
ing the lunch rush." he said.
Link believes that KFC's parent.
Yum! Brands, Inc., has enough in
fluence to demand change. "Ulti
mately, it does come down to the
suppliers, but KFC can demand
higher standards from them," he
said.
