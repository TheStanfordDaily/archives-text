# SAT more important than once believed
## 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
In recent years, educators have
disputed the importance that SAT
scores should hold in college admis
sions processes, thrusting many high
school students into confusing, ever
changing degrees of standardized
test-related stress. New data indicat
ing a higher average of SAT scores
for those admitted to University of
California schools in 2004, however,
may convince college applicants
who believe SAT scores are trivial to
crack open those Princeton Review
books after all.
According to an article published
last Monday in the Los Angeles
Times, 51 percent of students with
SAT scores below 1000 were accept
ed to one or more of the University
of California schools in the fall of
2(X)4, while 63 percent of applicants
with these scores were admitted in
the fall of 2003.
This data comes a year after
John Moores, chairman of the UC
Berkeley Board of Reagents in
2003, criticized Berkeley for plac
ing too little emphasis on SAT
scores in admissions processes and
letting too.many low-scoring appli
cants into its freshman class, ac
cording to the article.
Specifically, Moores reported
that in the fall of 2002, UC Berkeley
accepted 381 applicants with SAT
scores under 1000. but rejected 2,577
students with scores in the 1401 to
1500 range and 641 applicants with
scores at or above 1500.
In 2003. out of a maximum score
of 1600. high school students both
nation and statewide score an aver
age of 1030. reported the College
Board, the organization that admin
isters the SAT.
According to an article last Tues
day in the Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation. Moores and other critics at
tribute the admission of low-scoring
applicants in large part to the UC
schools' comprehensive review poli
cy â€” a method initiated in 2002 that
urnes admissions officers to evaluate

applicants based not only on acade
mic criteria such as grades and SAT
scores, but also on tactors such as
struggles with difficult personal situ
ations.
Some critics of comprehensive
review believe that this year's de
crease in low-scoring UC admits in
dicates that the schools reacted di
rectly to the Board of Reagent's
complaints.
But Susan Wilbur, a director of
University of California admissions,
told the Los Angeles times that this
year's admissions process was no dif
ferent than it has been in the past.
In the Chronicle of Higher Edu
cation article, Ravi Poorsina, a UC
Berkeley spokesperson, said that
the decrease in low-scoring admits
may have resulted because UC
schools received fewer applications
and admitted an overall smaller
number of students in 2004 than in
2003. She said that the data does not
suggest that the average SAT scores
of applicants has increased.
Anna Marie Porras, director of
admissions at Stanford, told The
Daily. "While we do not release spe
cific data on any subgroup of appli
cants, we have not seen a shift in the
scores of either our application pool
or our admitted class this year." Her
comments support further support
ing the UC schools' claims that this
year's decreased admission of low
scoring applicants should not be
considered part of a new admissions
trend.
Freshman Alex Williamson,
however, said he still teels that the
SAT pressure is mounting.
"1 think they're getting more
competitive, especially at the top
schools, in terms of the numbers of
students with high scores all vying
for the same spots," said freshman
Alex Williamson.
Notably, SAT scores will now be
calculated on a 2,400-point scale in
stead of a 1,600-point scale, perhaps
changing the nature of the ways in
which students and admissions offi
cers approach and conceptualize
the test.
