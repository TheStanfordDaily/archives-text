### Laura Griffith DAILY EASTERN NEWS 
(U-WIRE) CHARLESTON, 111 —Four days
after Pope John Paul II died, his likeness was
seen in Thomas Dining Center, put up for auc
tion on eßay and removed from the Web site —
all within 24 hours.
E.J. Rouzin-Moy, a freshman undecided
major at Eastern Illinois University, was eating
his lunch with a friend Wednesday when he no
ticed one of his baked chicken breasts looked
strangely like a man and decided to inspect it
more closely.
"You could tell there was a nose," Rouzin-
Moy said. "That's the first thing that makes it
look like a man."
The seasoning on the breast is situated in
such a way that it looks like the pope's pileolus,
his small hat, Rouzin-Moy said.
Immediately, Rouzin-Moy mentioned to his
friend Mike Margolis, a freshman biology major,
he had seen items that looked like people sell tor
big money on eßay, and he was going to put the
breast up for auction.
"He saved it, put it in a napkin and brought it
to his room," Margolis said.
Going hungry did not worry Rouzin-Moy.
"I got another piece of chicken so I thought.

'why not?'" he said.
He told his parents about his venture into the
world of online auctioning.
"They thought it was hilarious," Rouzin-Moy
said.
Margolis said the breast looks like a man, al
though he doesn't think it looks specifically like
the pope, but Rouzin-Moy, a Christian from
Skokie who wouldn't describe himself as an avid
churchgoer, disagrees.
Margolis is not the only person who is skepti
cal.
"I think its kind of ridiculous. I just don't be
lieve that his food was shaped like John Paul,"
said Jenny Enlow, a student supervisor at
Thomas Dining Center.
Once the "pope chicken" was posted on
eßay, the bidding was set at 99 cents. The only
comments Rouzin-Moy received concerning the
item were from one supporter and another per
son who said the auction of the "pope chicken"
was "tasteless," he said.
After 20 hours, S.(XK) page hits and a total of
three bids, the "pope chicken" was removed
from the Web site, but the reason was unclear at
first to Rouzin-Moy. he said.
Rouzin-Moy received an e-mail from eßay
notifying him about the item's removal, claiming
the "pope chicken" was not consistent with the

site's material.
He reviewed eßay's auction policies and
could not find any rules or guidelines the chick
en didn't meet, he said. He sent the site adminis
trators an e-mail asking why it was removed and
didn't hear anything back until Monday night.
Rouzin-Moy did not properly list the item as
a collectible, and therefore it was considered a
food item, which cannot be sold on eßay, he
said.
Rouzin-Moy cited Golden Palace.com, which
once purchased a grilled cheese sandwich lor
$28,000 from eßay that looked like the Virgin
Mary. Wednesday, Golden Palace.com paid
$10,600 dollars to purchase a pretzel that resem
bles Mary holding the baby Jesus from eßay. A
Dorito resembling the pope's miter was also
purchased from eßay for $1,200, Rouzin-Moy
said.
"I'm trying to get it back on (eßay)," he said
about an hour before it was put back up for auc
tion at 5:37 p.m.
Rouzin-Moy is preserving the "pope chick
en" in a freezer in his dorm room, and he said he
isn't too worried about freezer burn. He is curi
ous to see if he will receive any higher bids.
"I saw the other stuff, so 1 thought why not?"
Rouzin-Moy said. "If it doesn't sell, at least I
took a shot."
