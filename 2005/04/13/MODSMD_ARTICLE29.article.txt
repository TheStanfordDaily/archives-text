## Right in the Babymaker Have you ever wondered why... 
### 
The unanswerable questions of baseball:
Why do the A's wear white shoes with
their road uniforms? It makes them look
like a traveling ballet troupe. The white spikes
with the whiter-than-J.J. Redick-and-Curt
Schilling-combined home uniforms are OK. I
guess, but they look like jogging shoes with the
road greys.
Why did "Fever Pitch" get made? Serious
ly. The fact that Jimmy Fallon is still alive
makes my cellular structure ache. He can't
make it through a two-minute SNL sketch
without laughing — who decided he could
act?
Why is there instant replay in professional
football but not baseball? If the big complaint
is that it slows games down, isn't baseball al
ready a game of stoppages? The fact that

ESPN has the K-Zone fea
ture should have already
made it obvious that, at the
very least, plate umpires are
borderline obsolete.
Why can't they ever cast
realistic-looking athletes in
baseball movies? Further
more. why can't they get the
uniforms right? The players
in "Major League" looked

like they were dressed as baseball players for
Halloween — hats under the helmets, too
tight pants, stirrup socks halfway up the calf.
Isn't there an actors union like "Men Who Can
Throw Better than Tim Robbins?"
Why do stadium designers insist on eccen
tricities that both fans and players complain
about (Petco Park, Minute Maid Park)? It's
like the city of San Diego hired Frank Gehry to
slap together some steel girders and then just
said "Here you go. Padres; hope there's
enough room fora baseball field in the mid
dle."
Why did Arte Moreno rename the Ana
heim Angels the "Los Angeles Angels of Ana
heim"? Did he think Dodgers fans would be
drawn south? Was he trying to fool the
Rangers' team bus into driving into Watts fora
weekend series? Did the mayor of Anaheim
sleep with his wife? Please, someone get back
to me on this.
Why can't players like Sammy Sosa speak
English yet? I mean, even if your teammates
communicated with you exclusively in Span
ish. how could you have a 16-year career in a
foreign country and not pick up on something
like subject-verb agreement?
If Fred McGriff does make it into the Hall
of Fame, will he go in wearing the cap of the
Blue Jays, the Braves or the Tom Emanski De
fensive Drills video series? Speaking of which,
does anyone know what Tom Emanski actual-


Dan McCarthy
