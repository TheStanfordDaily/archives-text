That's exactly what the No. 14
in a 7-1 win last night
The Cardinal (20-11, 4-2 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) took advantage of a series of extra oppor
tunities, but none more crucial than the one in
bottom of the second inning. After sopho
more centerfielder Jim Rapoport reached first
| on an error by USF third baseman Cy Donald,
junior leftfielder Chris Lewis appeared to hit into
| a double play. However, first base umpire Chad
* McCardell called a balk before the pitch that
moved Rapoport to second and gave Lewis a sec
ond chance at the plate.
San Francisco manager Nino Giarratano ar
gued the call to no avail.
One more pitch was all Lewis needed to drive
a liner into centerfield that plated Rapoport
to give Stanford a 3-1 lead, and the Cardi
al* nal weren't done.
Freshman Brendan Domaracki and
sophomore third baseman Adam Sorgi
kept the inning going with two straight hits, be
fore junior shortstop Chris Minaker drove in an
other run with a sacrifice fly, extending the Car
dinal lead to 5-1.
"That was the key highlight of the game," said
Sorgi, who went three-for-three in the game. "It
was good integrity on Chris [LewisJ's part to get
back and realize that you have a second chance
and get a good base hit. I think that's what this
team is all about."

Junior John Mayberry, Jr. was hidess in lour at-bats, but his teammates picked up the offensive slack and freshman Erik Davis earned his first win with five strong innings of work.
Rapoport extends hit streak to 10 games

gon State last weekend, the Cardinal
were able to fend off the Dons de
spite allowing nine haserunners in
the last five innings.
The best opportunity for USF to
cut into the Stanford lead came in
the top of the seventh. After two
quick outs by sophomore reliever
Jeff Stimpson. Dons catcher Jon
Norfolk earned a walk, before both
Donald and Tavo Hall singled to
load the bases.
It was up to the No. 3 hitter, junior
Stefan Gartrell, to put a dent in the
Cardinal lead. He nearly did, crush
ing a ball to the warning track in
deep center, but Rapoport was able
to make a running catch to end the
threat.
Despite having a number of op
portunities, the Dons were held to
one run, which came on a solo homer
by second baseman Royce
Fukuroku. The 5-foot-3 senior

smacked the first pitch he saw from
freshman pitcher Erik Davis over
the left field wall.
Davis, making his second career
start, earned his first collegiate victo
ry, throwing five innings and giving
up one run on five hits.
He struggled with his control in
last week's Tuesday night start, al
lowing three walks and hitting a bat
ter in three innings, but he didn't give
up a single walk to the Dons.
"That was my first start last Tues
day." Davis said. "1 was a little bit
nervous going out there. This time 1
just went out there and did what I al
ways do."
The outing was also the longest of
Davis' young career. Nearly all of his
previous outings came in short relief.
"I'm just happy to pitch, whether
it be on the weekend or five innings
on a Tuesday," Davis said.
The Cardinal opened hot to give

Davis and the Cardinal pitching
staff some early run support. Sorgi
led off the game for Stanford with a
nine-pitch at-bat that culminated in
a single to center. Minaker fol
lowed it up with an RBI double,
and the Cardinal were quickly on
the board.
Stanford also tacked on two in
surance runs in the eighth. Junior
catcher John Hester singled to lead
off the inning and freshman Michael
Taylor followed with another single.
Two batters later, Domaracki
smacked a single to left to drive in
both runs.
With his hit, Hester extended his
career-high hitting streak to eight
games. Rapoport also kept his hit
streak going, lengthening it to 10
games, after his two-for-three per
formance. He leads the team with a
.370 batting average.
One of the more heated moments

in an otherwise routine game came
in the sixth inning after Stanford
turned a quick 6-4-3 double play. Gi
arratano disagreed with the call
made at first and once more came
out to argue with McCardell. This
time McCardell wouldn't hear it and
threw Giarratano out of the game.
That double play, one of five in
the game, was critical in helping the
Cardinal escape the sixth without
giving up a run.
" The losses to Oregon State fired
us up and we realized that whoever
comes into this ballpark we've got to
defend this as our home-field," Sorgi
said. "Whoever it is — whether San
Francisco, Oregon State, Arizona or
anybody, we're going to do our best
and take a victory out of it."
The win wrapped up a five-game
hoinestand for the Cardinal, who
travel to Tempe to take on Arizona
State this weekend.

That's exactly what the No. 14
in a 7-1 win last night
The Cardinal (20-11, 4-2 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) took advantage of a series of extra oppor
tunities, but none more crucial than the one in
bottom of the second inning. After sopho
more centerfielder Jim Rapoport reached first
| on an error by USF third baseman Cy Donald,
junior leftfielder Chris Lewis appeared to hit into
| a double play. However, first base umpire Chad
* McCardell called a balk before the pitch that
moved Rapoport to second and gave Lewis a sec
ond chance at the plate.
San Francisco manager Nino Giarratano ar
gued the call to no avail.
One more pitch was all Lewis needed to drive
a liner into centerfield that plated Rapoport
to give Stanford a 3-1 lead, and the Cardi
al* nal weren't done.
Freshman Brendan Domaracki and
sophomore third baseman Adam Sorgi
kept the inning going with two straight hits, be
fore junior shortstop Chris Minaker drove in an
other run with a sacrifice fly, extending the Car
dinal lead to 5-1.
"That was the key highlight of the game," said
Sorgi, who went three-for-three in the game. "It
was good integrity on Chris [LewisJ's part to get
back and realize that you have a second chance
and get a good base hit. I think that's what this
team is all about."

Junior John Mayberry, Jr. was hidess in lour at-bats, but his teammates picked up the offensive slack and freshman Erik Davis earned his first win with five strong innings of work.
Rapoport extends hit streak to 10 games

gon State last weekend, the Cardinal
were able to fend off the Dons de
spite allowing nine haserunners in
the last five innings.
The best opportunity for USF to
cut into the Stanford lead came in
the top of the seventh. After two
quick outs by sophomore reliever
Jeff Stimpson. Dons catcher Jon
Norfolk earned a walk, before both
Donald and Tavo Hall singled to
load the bases.
It was up to the No. 3 hitter, junior
Stefan Gartrell, to put a dent in the
Cardinal lead. He nearly did, crush
ing a ball to the warning track in
deep center, but Rapoport was able
to make a running catch to end the
threat.
Despite having a number of op
portunities, the Dons were held to
one run, which came on a solo homer
by second baseman Royce
Fukuroku. The 5-foot-3 senior

smacked the first pitch he saw from
freshman pitcher Erik Davis over
the left field wall.
Davis, making his second career
start, earned his first collegiate victo
ry, throwing five innings and giving
up one run on five hits.
He struggled with his control in
last week's Tuesday night start, al
lowing three walks and hitting a bat
ter in three innings, but he didn't give
up a single walk to the Dons.
"That was my first start last Tues
day." Davis said. "1 was a little bit
nervous going out there. This time 1
just went out there and did what I al
ways do."
The outing was also the longest of
Davis' young career. Nearly all of his
previous outings came in short relief.
"I'm just happy to pitch, whether
it be on the weekend or five innings
on a Tuesday," Davis said.
The Cardinal opened hot to give

Davis and the Cardinal pitching
staff some early run support. Sorgi
led off the game for Stanford with a
nine-pitch at-bat that culminated in
a single to center. Minaker fol
lowed it up with an RBI double,
and the Cardinal were quickly on
the board.
Stanford also tacked on two in
surance runs in the eighth. Junior
catcher John Hester singled to lead
off the inning and freshman Michael
Taylor followed with another single.
Two batters later, Domaracki
smacked a single to left to drive in
both runs.
With his hit, Hester extended his
career-high hitting streak to eight
games. Rapoport also kept his hit
streak going, lengthening it to 10
games, after his two-for-three per
formance. He leads the team with a
.370 batting average.
One of the more heated moments

in an otherwise routine game came
in the sixth inning after Stanford
turned a quick 6-4-3 double play. Gi
arratano disagreed with the call
made at first and once more came
out to argue with McCardell. This
time McCardell wouldn't hear it and
threw Giarratano out of the game.
That double play, one of five in
the game, was critical in helping the
Cardinal escape the sixth without
giving up a run.
" The losses to Oregon State fired
us up and we realized that whoever
comes into this ballpark we've got to
defend this as our home-field," Sorgi
said. "Whoever it is — whether San
Francisco, Oregon State, Arizona or
anybody, we're going to do our best
and take a victory out of it."
The win wrapped up a five-game
hoinestand for the Cardinal, who
travel to Tempe to take on Arizona
State this weekend.
