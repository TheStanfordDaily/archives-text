# Water polo returns to Farm with three wins
## 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford women's water polo team (14-4,7-2
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) returned home Sun
day from a perfect weekend swing through Arizona and
southern California. Posting victories over No. 11 San
Diego State, No. 17 Arizona State and Pomona-Pitzer, the
Cardinal pushed their record away from home to an im
pressive 9-2.

The Cardinal opened their weekend in Tempe, Ariz.,
taking on a tough Arizona State squad. The Sun Devils en
tered the contest riding high after their stunning overtime
upset of then-No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara a week earlier.
Standout freshman goalie Caylinn Wallace set a team
record with 22 saves, shutting out the Gauchos in the final
period to take the game into overtime.
Anticipating the challenge, the Cardinal approached
their Saturday afternoon matchup knowing that their exe
cution of opportunities would be a major key to the game.

"They have been playing very well at home," head
coach John Tanner said. "Any team wanting to beat them
needs to finish its scoring chances and play good individual
defense."
Despite the rank differential between the two teams,
the Cardinal were never able to put the game away for
good. Senior two-meter Hannah Luber struck first for
the Cardinal, netting a power-play goal 34 seconds into
the first period. Five minutes later,
junior driver Scotti Shafer notched
her first goal of the day to put the
Cardinal up by two. The Sun Devils
cut the lead in hall with only 12 sec
onds remaining in the period on the
strength of sophomore driver Ash
ley Bower's four-meter penalty
shot conversion. But sophomore
Katie Hansen rebuilt the Cardi
nal's lead with her 23rd tally of the
season as time expired for the first
period of play.
The Arizona State defense held
the Cardinal scoreless in the second
period of play, and sophomore Katie
Hedley managed to send a lob shot
over the head of sophomore Cardi
nal goalie Meredith McColl to bring
the Sun Devils back within one going
into the half.
But that was as close as the Sun
Devils would come, as the Cardinal
came out of their half-time huddle
and dominated the third period of
play. Junior two-meter Nancy El-
Sakkary and Shafer combined for
two goals to put the Cardinal ahead
5-2 before Bower gave the Sun Dev
ils hope by netting her second of the
day with two seconds remaining in
the third period.
The Cardinal defense, however,
shut down the Arizona State attack
in the final period of play, and Shafer
posted her third score of the day to
complete the hat trick as the Cardi
nal took the contest by a final of 6-3.
The Cardinal then headed to San
Diego, Calif., where the playing con
ditions proved to be almost as great
a challenge as their opponents.
"The chlorine was absolutely
horrendous at the pool in San Diego
for some reason," Hannah L.uber
said. "Even halfway through the
game wc were barely able to glimpse
each other in the water our eyes hurt
so badly. As a result, we had to com
municate even more with one anoth
er and back each other up."
Continuing a trend of many of
their games this season, the Cardinal
jumped out to an early lead in their
match against San Diego State.
Hansen capitalized on her opportu
nities to put Stanford ahead, and the

Cardinal defenders proved more
than capable of handling the A/tec
offensive.
"Katie's two lightning speed
goals in the first quarter got us off to
a great start and our solid defense
enabled us to control the rest of the
game," said sophomore two-meter
Christina Hewko, who scored one of
Stanford's six goals in the game.

The Cardinal picked up their
third tally of the day from the hot
hand of Shafer to go up 3-0. By the
time the Aztecs tallied their second
goal in the final period of play, two
goals from Luber and another from
Hewko had put the game beyond
reach, and the Cardinal won, 6-2.
The Cardinal's second match of
the day pitted them against perenni

al Division 111 powerhouse Pomona-
Pitzer, but the Cardinal proved to be
too strong for the Sagehens and won
by an overwhelming score of 19-1.
This weekend the Cardinal have
their final regular season underdog
assignment, as they take on the No.
1 UCLA Bruins and No. 14 UC-
Davis at home at the Avery Aquatic
Center.
