# Track teams shine over the weekend
## 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In outdoor track and field, fractions
of a second and quarters of an inch
count a lot more than one might expect,
and those tiny differences are greatly
affected when wind and rain are fac
tored in.
But despite some pesky weather,
members of the Stanford men's and
women's track and field teams
achieved personal bests and came close
to breaking school records in three
parts of the country last weekend.
At the Texas Relays in Austin,
freshman Erica McLain jumped 44' 4"
to win the triple jump, a mark that
would have broken the current school
record, except that the mark was wind
aided. A tail wind of 2.1 meters per sec
ond or more determines a mark in the
triple jump as wind-aided and disquali
fies it as a record.
The women's 400-meter relay team
placed fifth in a time of 44.28, which
qualified the women for NCAA Re
gional and was the second best in Stan
ford history.
The sprint medley relay made up of
sophomores Janice Davis and Ashleigh
Purnell, junior Chinny Off or and senior
Christine Moschella placed third in a
time of 3:50.31. Davis and Moschella
sprinted the 200-meter legs, Purnell
sprinted the 400-meter leg and Offor
anchored the race with the 800-meter
leg.
"The 4xloo women came within one
10th of breaking the school record,"
head women's coach Edrick Floreal
said. "And the sprint medley lost by a
couple of yards, but came very close to
winning. It was very exciting."
Four Cardinal women ran the
4xBoo-meter relay for the first time all
year. Freshmen Laura Mottaz and
Claire Cormier, sophomore Ashley
Freeman and Offor ran the 4xBoo in
8:45.48, placing second to Arkansas,
which won in 8:38.03.
The women's mile relay squad saw
success as well. The team did not ad
vance to the finals, but its time of
3:36.27 was an NCAA regional qualify

ing mark and the sixth-best time in
school history.
The men's most notable feat at the
Texas Relays was the first-place finish
in the sprint medley relay. Freshman
Wopamo Osaisai, redshirt freshman
Michael Garcia and seniors Nick Sebes
and Curtis Goehring won the race in
3:21.18.
"It was a very exciting race," Floreal
said. "Garcia won in the last 25 meters;
he had a fantastic finish."
At the Rafer Johnson / Jackie Joyn
er-Kersee Invitational, held at UCLA,
the Cardinal throwers were busy
breaking personal bests and recording
NCAA regional marks.
Head men's coach and throwing
coach for the men and women, Robert
Weir, said he saw progress in the per
formances of his throwers.
Freshman Melissa Yunghans quali
fied for NCAA Regionals with her
48'4.25" mark in the shot put.
"Melissa increased her throw from
42' to 48'4," Weir said. "That was a sig
nificant improvement. She is doing re
ally well."
Yunghans also competed in the dis
cus, finishing sixth with a best throw of
130'6".
Hours of practice paid off for red
shirt junior Sarah Hopping and redshirt
sophomore Katy Elsbury, who placed
second and third, respectively, in the
hammer throw. Hopping's best throw
was 184-5 and Elsbury's was 183-7.
"Hopping went from fifth place to
second place on her last throw," Weir
said. "And Katy increased her perfor
mance in the hammer from 178' to
1837".*
Two Cardinal pole-vaulters com
peted at UCLA as well, tying for fifth
place with 12'5.5" vaults. Junior
Samantha Shepard and freshman
Anna McFarlane both cleared the
NCAA Regional mark.
McFarlane is coming very close to
hitting her own previous personal best
of 13 feet, which she did during her ju
nior year of high school, in collegiate
competition.

The women's 4XBOO relay team finished second to Arkansas in a time of 8:45.48 at the Texas Relays in Austin.
"Within the next meet she should
get over it." pole vault coach Kris
Mack said. "She keeps coming very
close and just nicking the top."
The biggest news at UCLA, how
ever, came from the men's side. Ju
nior Michael Robertson, who cur
rently holds the best discus throw in
the Pacific-10 Conference, finished
fourth with a throw of 195'6". That
throw was third best in school history
and qualified him for Regionals.
Freshman thrower Daniel Schaer
er competed in the discus as well. He
did not advance, but he increased his

personal best from 164' to 176' and
earned a regional qualifying mark.
Redshirt freshman Russell Brown
placed fifth in the 800-meter run, fin
ishing in 1:51.35.
"Russell had a solid perfor
mance." Weir said. "But he is capable
of a lot more than that."
The Brutus Hamilton Memorial
Invitational at Berkeley rounded out
the weekend's track and field events,
but due to terrible weather condi
tions the results were not quite as im
pressive as the Cardinal hoped they
would be.
Sophomore Arianna Lambie had
the best performance of the meet, fin
ishing fourth in the 800-meter run.
Her time of 2:09.13 just barely broke
the NCAA regional qualifying mark
of 2:09.80.
