# New passport laws affect U.S. travelers
## 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the movie "Born in East
L.A.," actor Cheech Marin's char
acter Rudy — a U.S. citizen —
gets deported to Mexico and isn't
allowed back in because he doesn't
have the proper identification.
Starting on Jan. 1, 2008, life could
imitate art.
The Department of Homeland
Security, along with the U.S. State
Department, announced the West
ern Hemisphere Travel Initiative,
or WHTI, last week, which will
change requirements for U.S. citi
zens reentering the United States
from Mexico, Canada, South
America, the Caribbean and
Bermuda.
Valid U.S. passports will be
come the "documents of choice"
for citizens who want to re-enter
the country from countries in the
Americas, Bermuda and the
Caribbean, according to officials at

the Department of Homeland Se
curity. Other forms of identifica
tion that will he valid include Bor
der Crossing Cards, and SENTRI,
NEXUS and FAST cards, which
are granted to individuals who reg
istered with international frequent
traveler programs.
This may pose inconveniences
for students going abroad. Senior
Naishin Fu didn't take her passport
when she went to Cancun, Mexico
over spring break.
"My passport was pretty old
and 1 hadn't been out of the coun
try since I was 12," she said, adding
that she did not experience any in
convenience when she crossed the
border back into the United States.
Foreign nationals who leave the
country will not be impacted by the
changes, provided that they are
able to produce valid passports.
"It's basically elevating the level
and the security of travel to that
which is required in Europe," said
Christiana Halsey, a spokesperson
for U.S. Customs and Border Protec
tion, a division of Homeland Securi
ty-
Starting Dec. 31, 2(X)5 this docu
mentation requirement will apply to
all air and sea travel to or from the
Caribbean. Bermuda, and Central
and South America. A year later, the
requirement will apply to all air and
sea travel to or from Mexico and
Canada. Finally, on Dec. 31,2007, the
new requirements will be enforced at
all air. sea and land border crossings.
There will be no grace period for
enforcement of these regulations.

The WHTI is part of the Intelli
gence Reform Act passed by Con
gress in 2004, according to Customs
and Border Protection spokesperson
Jim Hawkins. In order to make the
transition as smooth as possible over
the next three years, both depart
ments will be issuing an advance no
tice of proposed policies in the Feder
al Register for 60 days so the public
can give feedback on the plan.
So what's the big deal? People
should just bring their passports
along with them on vacation, right?
Currently, for people 15 years of
age and under, the total cost of a pass
port is $X2. For persons aged 16 or
older, the cost is $*)7. These figures do
not include the cost of taking passport
photos.
And what about emergency trav
el? Passports normally take several
weeks to be processed. In the event of

an emergency, however, and fora fee
of $60, one can receive their passport
within three days.
"Financially, that could be a bur
den." said senior Bobby DeHaro,
who also went to Cancun over spring
break. "It's a valid concern."
John Pearson, director of Stan
ford's Bechtel International Center
said WHTI would not affect his work
too much.
"All countries now are doing
more and more to have evidence of
who is standing in front of them in a
line," he said. "It's not something that
is affecting our work; it concerns
more U.S. citizens."
So what happens if you decide to
test the waters and come back from
spring break in 2008 without a pass
port?

be a hus>e inconvenience."
