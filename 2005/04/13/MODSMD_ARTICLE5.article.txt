## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Board of Trustees unani
mously approved the most recent de
sign for the new Munger graduate
residences at its two-day meeting,
which ended yesterday. The Trustees
also agreed that while the building of
a new performing arts center would
benefit the campus community, the
University does not have the re
sources to finance such a project at
this time.
The discussion on the center came
in response to plans for an arts initia
tive presented by Jonathan Berger,
chair of the Music Department, and
Bryan Wolf, associate chair of the
Art and Art History Department.
While Stanford does not yet have
the funding fora performance cen
ter, Burt McMurty, chair of the
Board of Trustees, said in a debrief
ing to media yesterday that Universi
ty President John Hennessy would

like to see a meaningful investment
made in Stanford's arts program
ming.
The future of international stud
ies and research at Stanford was also
discussed, with Coit Blacker, director
of the Institute for International
Studies, and M. Elisabeth Pate-Cor
nell, chair of the Management Sci
ence and Engineering Department,
presenting their ideas on how to ex
pand existing programs in these
areas.
"It is encouraging to see that our
faculty is thinking broadly about how
Stanford can have more of an inter
national presence and involvement
in research at both the graduate and
undergraduate levels," McMurty
said.
The Board also discussed general
funding issues, including the
prospect of offering need-based fi
nancial aid to international students
