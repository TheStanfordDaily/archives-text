# Board approves Munger housing
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Board of Trustees unani
mously approved the most recent de
sign for the new Munger graduate
residences at its two-day meeting,
which ended yesterday. The Trustees
also agreed that while the building of
a new performing arts center would
benefit the campus community, the
University does not have the re
sources to finance such a project at
this time.
The discussion on the center came
in response to plans for an arts initia
tive presented by Jonathan Berger,
chair of the Music Department, and
Bryan Wolf, associate chair of the
Art and Art History Department.
While Stanford does not yet have
the funding fora performance cen
ter, Burt McMurty, chair of the
Board of Trustees, said in a debrief
ing to media yesterday that Universi
ty President John Hennessy would

like to see a meaningful investment
made in Stanford's arts program
ming.
The future of international stud
ies and research at Stanford was also
discussed, with Coit Blacker, director
of the Institute for International
Studies, and M. Elisabeth Pate-Cor
nell, chair of the Management Sci
ence and Engineering Department,
presenting their ideas on how to ex
pand existing programs in these
areas.
"It is encouraging to see that our
faculty is thinking broadly about how
Stanford can have more of an inter
national presence and involvement
in research at both the graduate and
undergraduate levels," McMurty
said.
The Board also discussed general
funding issues, including the
prospect of offering need-based fi
nancial aid to international students
and eliminating parental contribu
tions to tuition for families with an
nual incomes below $45,(XK).
Investment disclosure was also a
major issue addressed, prompted by
last Wednesday's heated town
meeting on whether or not the Uni
versity should be investing in com
panies that have business ties to the
current Sudanese government. The
Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility debated whether or
not Stanford needs to change the
way it currently manages invest
ment activities.

"Our investment responsibility
profile [and policies] address not in
vesting in companies that are creat
ing substantial social harm." VlcMur
ty said.
Also related to the University's fi
nancial situation, Business Prof.
William Meelian presented a finan
cial model that was developed by his
students to predict how the Universi
ty will compared to its peer in
stitutions.
"The objective of the model was
lo build the endowment and create
an operating surplus while keeping
the University in the top five of col
lege rankings," McMurty said. Mee
lian had presented a similar model at
the Board's retreat last year.
"It was a very useful exercise to
hear from students and an unusual

treat [for the Board] to get that kind
of input," McMurty added.
Also at the meeting, Anthony
Bryk, professor of organizational
studies in education and business,
updated the Board regarding the
School of Education's plans to man
age East Palo Alto High School, a
local charter school.
"This plan will give terrific train
ing for students and research op
portunities for students and facul
ty," McMurty said. "Our conclu
sion is that the project has been
thought through exceptionally well
and that very high quality people
are leading the charge, so we feel
very good about what they are
doing."
The Board will meet again in early
June prior to commencement.
