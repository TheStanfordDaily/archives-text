# Students describe violence in Gaza
## 
### BOB BOREK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"One soldier can decide whether
you go to university or not," said
Hekmat Bessiso, a student from the
Gaza strip currently attending Al-
Ouds Open University.
Bessiso was one of three Palestin
ian students to speak at event enti
tled "Education Under Occupa
tion." hosted last night by the Coali
tion for Justice in the Middle East,
or CJME.
The presentation officially
kicked off of the group's Palestine
Awareness Month and was held in
conjunction with the Organization
of Arab-American Students in Stan
ford and the Muslim Students
Awareness Network.
While many students see the im
ages of violence along the Gaza strip
in the news, the event was an at
tempt to "give people an idea of
what education in Gaza is actually

like," said CJME co-president
Omar Shakir, a sophomore.
Bessiso was born in Gaza and has
lived there her entire life. She said
that her speaking tour is an opportu
nity "to start building a dream to end
the occupation together."
She emphasized numerous times
during the event that she was not
telling isolated stories, but that simi
lar anecdotes are lived out every day
by over a million Palestinians living
in the Gaza strip.
"There is a policy in Israel against
the Palestinians, to make the Pales
tinians feel that they are nothing,"
Bessiso said.
The other two speakers were
Mostafa A1 Kayali, a sophomore at a
university on the Gaza strip studying
English and computer technology,
and Adel Alghoul, who told stories
about his time in Israeli prisons with
the help of translator Badawi
