# Students describe violence in Gaza
## 
### BOB BOREK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"One soldier can decide whether
you go to university or not," said
Hekmat Bessiso, a student from the
Gaza strip currently attending Al-
Ouds Open University.
Bessiso was one of three Palestin
ian students to speak at event enti
tled "Education Under Occupa
tion." hosted last night by the Coali
tion for Justice in the Middle East,
or CJME.
The presentation officially
kicked off of the group's Palestine
Awareness Month and was held in
conjunction with the Organization
of Arab-American Students in Stan
ford and the Muslim Students
Awareness Network.
While many students see the im
ages of violence along the Gaza strip
in the news, the event was an at
tempt to "give people an idea of
what education in Gaza is actually

like," said CJME co-president
Omar Shakir, a sophomore.
Bessiso was born in Gaza and has
lived there her entire life. She said
that her speaking tour is an opportu
nity "to start building a dream to end
the occupation together."
She emphasized numerous times
during the event that she was not
telling isolated stories, but that simi
lar anecdotes are lived out every day
by over a million Palestinians living
in the Gaza strip.
"There is a policy in Israel against
the Palestinians, to make the Pales
tinians feel that they are nothing,"
Bessiso said.
The other two speakers were
Mostafa A1 Kayali, a sophomore at a
university on the Gaza strip studying
English and computer technology,
and Adel Alghoul, who told stories
about his time in Israeli prisons with
the help of translator Badawi

Hekmat Bessiso described her life as a Palestinian student in the Gaza strip
last night, ushering in Palestine Awareness Month.
Qawasmi, a first-year graduate student at Stanford.
Alghoul was first detained by Israeli soldiers when he
was only 13 years old. He had been demonstrating against
verdicts of the Arab Summit, a meeting not related to the
Israeli occupation.
"It was a very hard experience fora kid who did not
know much about what was going on around him," said
Alghoul.
The soldiers made him strip naked even though it was
a very cold day in Gaza and then blindfolded him and
smacked him with scissors on his thighs and lower stom
ach, he said.
"They were moments of horror to me," Alghoul said.
"I can't forget it. It's like a nightmare."
He compared the treatment he received to those that
inmates at Iraq's Abu Ghraib received; he said that he
once witnessed a close friend suffer sexual assault.
"I don't have enough words to explain what goes on in
the prisons," he said. "The life of refugees is a life of
death."
Raised by his mother because his father was working in
overseas to support their family, A1 Kayali said the task of
completing university study in Ga/.a extremely difficult.
"Even after students finish secondary school, many can
not find a better life because they are not allowed to leave
Gaza," he said.
Earlier this year, Al Kayali had the opportunity to visit
the West Bank for the first time fora conference with both
Israeli and Palestinian students seeking to end the occu
pation.
Al Kayali said the conference was personally signifi
cant.
"It was my first chance to meet Israeli people, many Is
raelis supporting and working for peace," he said.
Unfortunately, two of the students that attended the
conference with Al Kayali were arrested, and he and his
friends had to spend six hours negotiating the students out
of an Israeli prison.
After last night's talks, there was a brief question-and
answer session.
One man asked whether any Palestinians actively fight
or revolt against the Israelis.
Alghoul smiled and said that if the Palestinian popula
tion on the Ga/.a strip is 1.3 million, then there are 1.5 mil
lion people who will revolt.
"Everyone contributes and fights against the occupa
tion in their own way," he said.
When a student expressed concern over dehumanizing
language regarding Israelis in a video shown at the begin
ning of the presentation, Bessiso responded that anything
that opposes human rights can be called a devil.
She discounted the stories in the media of Palestinian
mothers who send their children off to become suicide
bombers and kill Israelis.
Bessiso also said that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon is responsible for planting the ideas that lead to
suicide bombings, and that if there is another culprit in the
violence it is the silence of the world, which makes the
Palestinians feel misunderstood.
