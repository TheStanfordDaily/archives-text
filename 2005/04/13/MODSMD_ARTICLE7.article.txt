The Stanford Center for Professional Develop
ment, or SCPD, has launched a new online comput
er security program to teach software professionals
the principles of designing more secure systems.
"This program is designed to equip industry
professionals with both theoretical background
and hands-on problem solving," said Carissa Lit
tle, the professional education program manager
for the SCDP. "Since computer security is con
stantly changing, as is computer science in gener

al. engineers have to keep themselves up to date
on the latest technologies to remain competitive in
the marketplace."
Neil Daswani, a Stanford graduate who will be
teaching the course, said that the program consists
of three modules: computer security principles, in
troduction to cryptography and secure program
ming techniques.
"The first module will teach the basic blue print
for constructing secure computer software; the
second module will provide extra tools that pro
grammers can use to build security; and the third
module will teach students how to ensure that all

components are implemented correctly," he said.
Daswani said that because the computer indus
try is so vulnerable to security breaches there is a
great need for this program.
"Everyday in the news we hear of a new attack
taking place on computer securityâ€”just yester
day data for 310,000 people was stolen from Lex
isNexis." he said. "Corporations have an unmet
need with respect to making sure that all of their
programmers and software developers under
stand how to make sure that their software code is
