# Center offers computer security courses
## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Center for Professional Develop
ment, or SCPD, has launched a new online comput
er security program to teach software professionals
the principles of designing more secure systems.
"This program is designed to equip industry
professionals with both theoretical background
and hands-on problem solving," said Carissa Lit
tle, the professional education program manager
for the SCDP. "Since computer security is con
stantly changing, as is computer science in gener

al. engineers have to keep themselves up to date
on the latest technologies to remain competitive in
the marketplace."
Neil Daswani, a Stanford graduate who will be
teaching the course, said that the program consists
of three modules: computer security principles, in
troduction to cryptography and secure program
ming techniques.
"The first module will teach the basic blue print
for constructing secure computer software; the
second module will provide extra tools that pro
grammers can use to build security; and the third
module will teach students how to ensure that all

components are implemented correctly," he said.
Daswani said that because the computer indus
try is so vulnerable to security breaches there is a
great need for this program.
"Everyday in the news we hear of a new attack
taking place on computer security—just yester
day data for 310,000 people was stolen from Lex
isNexis." he said. "Corporations have an unmet
need with respect to making sure that all of their
programmers and software developers under
stand how to make sure that their software code is

not easily vulnerable to attacks. This
program has been built to address
this need."
While there are a number of sim
ilar courses offered throughout the
country, Little said that the Stanford
program has certain advantages
over others.
"It blends academic and industry
perspectives to provide a program
that is quite unique from what our
competitors are offering," she said.
"It is both cost and time effective —
10 hours, quick and to the point. It is
available for companies to license
and for groups to sign up at a dis
counted rate. It is available 24[hours
a day], 7[days a week] and is online
and self-paced."
The course is similar to the cur
rent offerings in the Computer Sci
ence Department but cannot be
taken for academic credit.
"It assumes that you have at least
a bachelor's degree-level back
ground in computer science and pro
vides an overview rather than the in
depth offering of the theory behind
the topics covered." Little said. "The

Computer Science Department ot
ters many quarter-long courses
which can provide a more in-depth
study for those wanting credit or
more information."
The program. Daswani said, is
targeted primarily at professionals
who are crunched for time.
He said that the course is offered
online in a series of 45-minute lec
tures that include an audio-stream
with synchronized slides. After lis
tening to all of the lectures, students
must then pass an exam. If a student
passes the exam for all three mod
ules. he or she will be awarded a cer
tificate of completion.
"Overall we've seen considerably
higher enrollments than some of our
other offerings in the first few weeks
after launching the program, which
indicates a strong interest in the
market," Little said.
Daswani said that while this pro
gram is a good start, he believes that
a change in the general trend of com
puter science education is needed.
"Computer science is a relatively
new field, but computer software is
used for very critical aspects of every
day life," he said. "We need to bring
a new level of maturity to the field of
computer science and move comput
er security into the basic curriculum
of the field."
