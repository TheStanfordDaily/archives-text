### CHUAN-MEI LEE DESK EDITOR 
It was standing room only in the Oak
East Room at Tresidder Memorial
Union last night as several hundred stu
dents squeezed in to hear the founders
of Thefacebook.com. Napster, Paypal
and J unglee talk about the next big thing
in technology.
In a panel discussion entitled "Find
ing the Next Google," the four well
known, young Silicon Valley entrepre
neurs chatted about the future of tech
nological entrepreneurship.
Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel, Class
of 1989, predicted that the next success
ful technology startup will come from
within a 10-mile radius of Stanford.
"All of you are pretty fortunate —
you at Stanford — if you want to get in
volved with the new economy," Thiel
said. "The new economy is here to stay.
It's all happening in a few mile radius of
here. We were super fortunate to have

started up Paypal in this whole area."
Venky Harinarayan, co-founder of
Junglee, a Sunnyvale-based database
provider acquired by Amazon.com,
who earned a doctorate in computer sci
ence from Stanford in 19%, agreed with
Thiel.
"It's almost a crime if you go to Stan
ford and don't go to a startup from
there," he said, half-jokingly.
Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and
chief executive officer of Thefacebook,
and Sean Parker, co-founder of Napster
and current president of the Theface
book, illustrated Silicon Valley's unique
dynamism with an anecdote about how
the two met.
"We met on the street one day,"
Zuckerberg said. He described giving
Parker his phone number after spotting
him in Palo Alto moving boxes from his
car.
"The point about this area is that it
would not happen somewhere else,"
Parker added.

The talk was casual and largely unre
hearsed, and sushi chefs hired by The
facebook executives prepared food for
members of the audience.
When asked during the question
and-answer session what the "poke"
function on Thefacebook actually does,
Zuckerberg quipped: "I'm sorry, we
can't tell you."
After the talk, students had the op
portunity to network with the panelists
and with representatives from several
firms, including Clarium Capital, Cos
mix, Efficient Frontier and Palantir

Technology. Students lined up to talk to
Zuckerberg and Parker, who have be
come entrepreneurial icons to many col
lege students nationwide. Students were
also able to submit resumes to a pool for
all the companies represented at the
event.
"[This is] such a meat market." said
Dave Sanford, a junior with an individu
ally-designed major in markets and en
trepreneurial management. "1 mean
