## The
						effects of Barbie dolls on happiness and health 
### 
When I was little, I really wanted a Barbie
doll. My mother, however, refused to buy me
one. She said I wouldn't like it. But everyone
at school had 10 or so Barbie dolls — not to
mention the pink Barbie Dreamhouse and
the pink Barbie convertible.
And I wanted a Barbie, too. I was a dis
gruntled first-grader, and I knew that
nothing but an 11-inch tall, perpetually
tiptoed woman could make me happy. So
1 begged and begged until my mother fi
nally gave in and bought me one for my
sixth birthday.
I hated it. What exactly are you sup
posed to do with a miniature plastic 25-
year-old woman? Enraged, I ripped off her
clothes and popped out her skinny little
legs. The lesson of the story: Beyond the
basic necessities of life, even the most
tempting material things cannot bring us
happiness.
Happiness is often thought of as an ab
stract concept, something that is difficult to

define, let alone quantify.
Yet it is widely accepted
as a major determinant of
our health status, shaping
our emotional well-being
and even influencing our
immunity to disease.
Some studies have even
proposed that a positive
attitude can improve re
covery from cancer. In
many cases, happiness

translates into healthiness.
But what exactly makes us happy?
Money? Power? Fame? A pint of fudge
brownie ice cream and a new episode of
"Desperate Housewives?" No, no, no and,
we 11... no. According to recent studies at
the University of Michigan and the Universi
ty of Illinois, there are three things that bring
us happiness: pleasure, connecting with oth
ers and activities that give us a sense of pur
pose.
While things like money, power and even
television are nice and can provide some
pleasure, studies show that this is the most
fleeting and least important form of happi
ness. Income, education, youth and weather
are not significant determinants of overall
satisfaction.
Instead, the studies found that people
are happiest, and remain so for the longest
time, when they connect on a personal
level with other human beings. Exercising
interpersonal virtues such as gratitude,
kindness and love seems to be the secret to
a happy life.
During my devoted hour-long Google
quest in search of the secret of happiness,
health and a well-balanced life, I happened
upon a short quiz published in Time maga
zine called "How happy are you?"
(http://www.time.com/time/2005/happi
ness/graphics/quiz.html).
Wonderful! Even in the information age,
who would've thought that exploring the
depths of the human psyche and exposing
the truth about a person's emotional well
being could be so easy? Nevertheless, seven
questions and 45 seconds later, my quiz was
scored and my happiness summed up in one
short sentence: "You are slightly dissatisfied
with your life."
Gee, thanks. Perhaps it was a little pre
sumptuous to expect an online quiz to solve
all my problems, but I had come to expect a
little more of the good people from Time.
But while the quiz may not have given me
much along the lines of concrete sugges
tions, it did make me consider that any dis
satisfaction I feel is probably due more to
my attitude than any physical factors in my
life.
There are bound to be a few potholes as
you drive down the road of life and stretch
es where the A / C is broken and the only
thing on the radio is that horribly over
played Kid Rock-Faith Hill duet. This is
unavoidable.
But if you often find yourself dissatisfied
or unhappy, there is the possibility that you
are looking for joy in the wrong places. The
secret to a happy life (at least as I have come
to understand it after the extensive research
I conducted in order to write this article) is in
two words — people and purpose.
Surround yourself with people you care
for and devote yourself to those relation
ships. Put your time and your energy into
working fora cause you believe in and never
forget to perform random acts of kindness.
According to the experts, this will boost your
self-esteem and optimism and help you keep
your own problems in perspective. Your life
may not become perfect, but you will be hap
pier. If you're happier, you will probably be
healthier.
And if any of you do collect Barbies and
Barbie-related paraphernalia, I don't mean
to condemn you or your tiny, frighteningly
disproportionate supermodel buddies. I am
simply informing you, as a friend who
learned the lesson the hard way, that Barbie
cannot fill the void in your heart or mend
your spirit. Trust me.
