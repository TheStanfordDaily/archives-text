# Stanford Hospital revamps heart lab

### HUONG THAI 
To the untrained eye, the heart is a com
plicated, heating mess. Large and small
blood vessels connect to this vital organ in
every which way. To put it mildly, perform
ing surgery on this organ is no small task.
But a new high-tech suite at the Stanford
Hospital is set to make several heart-related
surgical procedures safer and easier to per
form.
The high-tech lab — formally known as
the Catheterization Angiography Labora
tory, or Cath Angio lab — will now include
a radiology room called the Cath Angio
Suite. Three-dimensional imaging technol
ogy developed by Siemens installed in the
suite will allow doctors to create images
while they are performing catheterization
procedures.
In a catheterization procedure, a small
tube — the catheter —is inserted into an
artery or vein in an arm or a leg and then
slowly pushed into the chambers of the
heart. Doctors use catheters to measure
blood pressure, blood oxygen content and
pumping ability into the heart. A catheter
procedure can also be life-saving: When
coronaries are clogged with cholesterol, a
catheter with a balloon is inserted into the

coronary and carefully inflated, enlarging
the coronary artery and allowing blood to
pass through.
"The most helpful aspect about the new
technology is that we're able to see very
small-sized blood vessels and understand
anatomy in three dimensions that we
could not previously understand,"
Michael Marks, chief of interventional

neuroradiology, said. "Fortunately the
new technology is all computer driven and
very user-friendly."
Stanford Hospital is the first hospital in
the western United States and the third in
the nation to have this new imaging tech
nology. The 916-foot suite is an important
investment for the Hospital, and is estimat
ed to have cost over $3 million, according to

Bob Tallerico, the lead technologist.
"[The new technology] is absolutely fan
tastic and interesting because you're able to
visualize things so nicely and be able to vi
sually manipulate the images and data, thus
treating patients that before would have to
go to surgery elsewhere," Tallerico said.
The new imaging technology includes a
main room at the hospital where procedures
take place and an attached room with a
computer screen for the imaging technolo
gy. There is a small section of the room be
hind glass that holds all of the computer
screens, which show surgeons the three-di
mensional images.
There is also a new operation room type
of table for surgical procedures.
For example, if there is a stroke patient
that needs to have a clot removed, the pa
tient would be brought to the suite for the
physician to remove the clot with a catheter,
according to Tallerico.
While this is happening, the new imaging
technology captures three-dimensional im
ages of the procedure, which greatly aid the
physician during the process.
"This is what makes the room so spe
cial," Tallerico said. "Never before have we
had the capability to actually see and ma
nipulate 3D images of this quality during a
cath procedure."
The new imaging technology also bene
fits patients, who do not need to pay any ad
ditional fees on top of the cost for the surgi
cal procedures. Doctors inform all of their
patients about how the new technology
works.
"I'm sure that our patients feel more se
cure knowing that they have the latest tech
nology in the world to diagnose and treat
their problems," Tallerico said.
Marks said he was optimistic about the
potential uses of the new imaging system.
"With this particular new technology,
we're going to be able to obtain images at a
much higher frame rate very soon," he said.
"We're going to obtain soft-tissue resolu
tion in the Angio Lab that we previously
could not obtain."
"What this means is that we're going to
get CT scan-like images in the Angio Lab."
he added, "This will open up a whole new
vista for us in terms of getting immediate
imaging of patients at the time of proce
dures."
