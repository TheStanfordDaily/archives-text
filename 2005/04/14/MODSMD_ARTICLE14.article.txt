# The
						Tsunami Generation:
## DRPHANED CHILDREN IN THE WAKE 
### TORI BABIN, CHELSEA TROTTER ALLISON WO GUEST COLUMNISTS 
Editor's Note: This column is the third in a three-part series
about the impact of the December 2004 tsunamis on Indone
sia 's health sector. The columns were written by students in
the Stanford-in-Washington program who took a class on
global health policy that focused specifically on the allocation
of aid.

As people struggle to rebuild their lives following the
devastating tsunamis in Southeast Asia, one group among
the many struck by the disaster has been left especially vul
nerable — orphaned children. Accounts vary widely on the
numbers of children who lost one or both parents in the
tsunamis, or whose parents may still be separated or miss
ing, but UNICEF estimates that as many as one third of the
disaster's 150,000 victims were children under the age of 16,
and that 50,000 of the children who survived have now been
left alone without parents.
Today, the lives of thousands of surviving children hang
in the balance, as they are among the groups most vulnera
ble to disease and neglect.
"The situation is not getting better," said UNICEF In
donesia Communications Officer John Budd, of the chil
dren in Aceh, in a statement released through UNICEF on
Dec. 29.
But what were the children's lives like before the
tsunamis struck the coastal towns and cities? How will their
lives be impacted by the disaster?
Even before the tsunamis, childhood was especially dif
ficult in Aceh. Civil war was brutal, violently reignited by in
the 19905. During this decade, thousands of children's par
ents, victims of liberation armies, disappeared in the night.
Children were drafted into the militia or coerced to act as
spies and messengers for warring factions, leaving genera
tions of child soldiers pulled into the conflict.
As of May 2003, the violence had displaced an estimated
23.(XX) children, according to the Global IDP Project, an in
ternational non-governmental organization that aids people
who have been displaced within their country by conflict.
The civil war also impeded children's education: More
than 500 schools were burned to the ground between 20(H)
and 2003, without any fulfilled promises to rebuild them.
About 17 percent of children in Aceh had never attended
school, but of those who did attend school, about 12 percent
dropped out early, according to Global IDP Project. The
most commonly cited reason is that they could no longer af
ford school supplies or had to work to earn money.
In the wake of the tsunamis, children's programs have re
ceived limited attention, and some aid missions have been
cut short by the government or for safety reasons.
A new level of suffering for tsunami's young victims
The health threats and needs of orphaned children mir
ror those of the adult survivors, but are magnified in sever
al ways. Children have a higher risk of contracting diseases
such as malaria or tuberculosis as a result of malnutrition.
Trauma and separation from their parents can hit children
hard: Post-traumatic stress syndrome may haunt these chil
dren for many years to come.
Unique regional conditions can also make both adults

and children susceptible to health risks in the aftermath of
this natural disaster. In Sri Lanka, for example, plastic land
mines have been dislodged by the waves and in India, the
BBC has reported that family members split up orphans to
seek the monetary rewards promised to survivors.
In addition, the children's vulnerability as orphans also
puts them at risk of abuse, kidnapping and trafficking.
Southeast Asian countries are notorious for their in
volvement in the $12 billion criminal enterprise known as
child trafficking and many have worried that the increased
vulnerability of tsunami-affected children will amplify such
operations.
"In environments like this, children are much more vulner
able to violence, unscrupulous exploitation and abuse, which is
why it is essential to identify them," said UNICEF's head of
Child Protection in Sri Lanka in a Mar. 1 public statement.
Solutions underway
Shortly after relief efforts began, international organiza
tions such as UNICEF and the Red Cross established sys
tems of registering orphaned or separated children and built
centers to protect them. Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand
have imposed a moratorium on the departure from the

country of all children under the age of 16 who are unac
companied by verifiable parents —an important step
against child trafficking.
Countries hard hit by the tsunamis have established refugee
camps and centers for care to protect orphaned children.
UNICEF promotes four goals to rebuild a positive in
frastructure for orphans in the wake of this tragedy: keeping
the children alive, caring for separated children, protecting
them from exploitation and eventually getting them back
into school.
In the past few months, the international aid community
and on-site relief groups have made significant strides in ful
filling these four goals. Children were returning to school in
some of the hardest hit areas of Thailand and Indonesia
nearly one month after the tsunamis hit.
However, the future of the "Tsunami Generation," a
name which has stuck to this group of children, still hangs
precariously in the balance of continued aid support and
media attention to this region. The trauma that flooded
their worlds in late December will subside slowly, if at all.
While the shock and sympathy of the initial weeks after the
tragedy may have faded for the rest of the world, it is still
overwhelmingly real for thousands of orphans.
