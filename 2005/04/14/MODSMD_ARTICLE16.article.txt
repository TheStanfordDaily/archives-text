## Editorial ITSS penalties must be publicized 
### 
That stack of unpaid ITSS bills sitting next to
your computer could hurt your credit rating if you
take too long to pay for your services.
ITSS, which stands for Information Technology
Systems and Services, recently announced that it
would enforce stricter punishments for students
who are habitually late in paying their bills. Under
the old policy, there was no punishment for not pay
ing bills on time, and consequently, many students
postponed payment for as long as possible.
Students who are more than 60 days late in pay
ing bills of over $100 will be subject to the new pun
ishments, including: phone or in-room Internet ser
vices being disconnected, being placed on academic
hold — which would prevent students from regis
tering for classes or receiving a transcript — or, at
worst, being turned over to an outside collection
agency. Students have until April 30 to pay their late
bills before the new punishments go into effect.
The most serious of the new penalties — being
turned over to an outside collection agency — can neg
atively impact a student's credit rating for up to seven
years, possibly barring him from receiving a loan to buy
a car or a home. ITSS administrators have said that this
action would only be used as a last resort imposed on

Unpaid bills are a serious problem, and ITSS'
new policy may indeed be necessary to force stu
dents to pay on time. However, these drastic new
measures have come without proper warning or ex
planation. ITSS should have been and should con
tinue to be more vocal in publicizing the new pun
ishments. The April 30 deadline is certainly a gener
ous amnesty period. However, ITSS should have
done more than enclose a small announcement with
students' most recent bills. Because so many stu
dents throw out their bills before even opening
them, this warning, most likely, did not reach the
students it would affect most.
This lack of communication raises a larger, more
important issue regarding the University and its
contact with students about financial issues. Be
cause financially related problems are very impor
tant to students, University administrators need to
increase and improve dialogue on this front. Instead
of inserting hidden warnings in the middle of little
read pamphlets and uninformative cards in the folds
of oft-unopened bills, the University should reach
out to students and openly inform them about all fi
nancial policies.
