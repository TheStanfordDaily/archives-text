I complained last week that rare
ideas get labeled as "crazy," even if
they're decently rational.
Stanford takes care to promote di
versity of backgrounds and lifestyles.
Could we also promote diversity of
ideas? Here are some radical opinions
that probably don't get much air time
at Stanford.
• "In modern industrial society only
minimal effort is necessary to satisfy

one's physical needs .... Thus it is not surprising that
modern society is lull of surrogate activities. These in
clude scientific work; athletic achievement; humanitar
ian work; artistic and literary creation; climbing the
corporate ladder; acquisition of money and material
goods far beyond the point at which they cease to give
any additional physical satisfaction; and social activism
that addresses issues that are not important for the ac
tivist, as in the case of white activists who work for the
rights of nonwhite minorities. These are not always
pure surrogate activities, since many people may be
motivated in part by needs other than the need to have
a goal. Scientific work may be motivated in part by a
drive for prestige, artistic creation by a need to express
feelings and militant social activism by hostility. But for
most people who pursue them, these activities are in
large part surrogate activities. For example, the major
ity of scientists will probably agree that the "fulfill
ment" they get from their work is more important than
the money and prestige they earn." That's what
Theodore Kaczynski wrote in"The Unabomber's
Manifesto."
From Derrick Jensen in"A Language Older than
Words": "Every morning when I wake up I ask myself
whether I should write or blow up a dam. Every day I
tell myself that I should continue to write. Yet I'm not
always convinced I'm making the right decision. I've
written books and I've been an activist. At the same
time I know neither a lack of words nor a lack of ac
tivism kills salmon here in the Northwest. It is the pres
ence of dams."
John Zerzan is a former Stanford student and current
anarchist. He's one of the most radical thinkers
around, criticizing not only recent technologies, but
symbolic culture in general — numbers, language ...
even keeping track of time. Here's what he said in an
interview with Derrick Jensen (from Zerzan's book,
"Running on Emptiness"):
Zerzan: In the 19605, many people, including me,
quit wearing watches.
Jensen: Fora while in my early twenties, I asked vis
itors to take off their watches as they entered my
home.
Zerzan: Even today children must be broken of
their resistance to time. This was one of the primary
reasons for the imposition of this country's manda
tory school system on a largely unwilling public.
School teaches you to be at a certain place at a cer
tain time, and prepares you for life in a factory. It
calibrates you to the system ... If I can share anoth

er quote, it would be Wittgenstein's: "Only a man
who lives not in time but in the present is happy."
• Zerzan wrote in the same book, "Surviving non-agri
cultural peoples often exhibit, in the interplay and in
terpretation of the senses, a very much greater sensory
awareness and involvement than do domesticated in
dividuals. Striking examples abound, such as the Bush
men, who can see four moons of Jupiter with the un
aided eye and can hear a single-engine light plane sev
enty miles away . . . Symbolic culture inhibits human
communication by blocking and otherwise suppressing
channels of sensory awareness. An increasingly tech
nological existence compels us to tune out most of what
we could experience."
• Bob Black is another interesting anarchist. Here's a
sample from one of his more famous essays, "The Abo
lition of Work":
"No one should ever work. Work is the source of
nearly all the misery in the world. Almost any evil
you'd care to name comes from working or from liv
ing in a world designed for work. In order to stop
suffering, we have to stop working ... The secret of
turning work into play, as Charles Fourier demon
strated, is to arrange useful activities to take advan
tage of whatever it is that various people at various
times in fact enjoy doing. To make it possible for
some people to do the things they could enjoy it will
be enough just to eradicate the irrationalities and
distortions which afflict these activities when they
are reduced to work. I, for instance, would enjoy
doing some (not too much) teaching, but 1 don't
want coerced students and I don't care to suck up to
pathetic pedants for tenure."
• John Taylor Gatto, New York Teacher of the Year in
1991, wrote in "Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden Cur
riculum of Compulsory Schooling":
"Mass-schooling damages children. We don't need
any more of it... Before [compulsory schooling
began] schooling wasn't very important anywhere.
We had it, but not too much of it, and only as much
as an individual wanted. People learned to read,
write and do arithmetic just fine anyway; there are
some studies that suggest literacy at the time of the
American Revolution, at least for non-slaves on the
Eastern seaboard, was close to total .... Were
the colonists geniuses? No, the truth is that reading,
writing and arithmetic only take about 1(X) hours to
transmit as the audience is eager and willing to
learn. The trick is to wait until someone asks and
then move fast while the mood is on. Millions of
people teach themselves these things, it really isn't
very hard. Pick up a fifth-grade math or rhetoric
textbook from 1850 and you'll see that the texts
were pitched then on what would today be consid
ered college level."
As 1 said at the outset, these aren't my ideas, and 1
admit that they are "crazy," but seeing other people brave
enough to say what they think might inspire us to do the
same.

I complained last week that rare
ideas get labeled as "crazy," even if
they're decently rational.
Stanford takes care to promote di
versity of backgrounds and lifestyles.
Could we also promote diversity of
ideas? Here are some radical opinions
that probably don't get much air time
at Stanford.
• "In modern industrial society only
minimal effort is necessary to satisfy

one's physical needs .... Thus it is not surprising that
modern society is lull of surrogate activities. These in
clude scientific work; athletic achievement; humanitar
ian work; artistic and literary creation; climbing the
corporate ladder; acquisition of money and material
goods far beyond the point at which they cease to give
any additional physical satisfaction; and social activism
that addresses issues that are not important for the ac
tivist, as in the case of white activists who work for the
rights of nonwhite minorities. These are not always
pure surrogate activities, since many people may be
motivated in part by needs other than the need to have
a goal. Scientific work may be motivated in part by a
drive for prestige, artistic creation by a need to express
feelings and militant social activism by hostility. But for
most people who pursue them, these activities are in
large part surrogate activities. For example, the major
ity of scientists will probably agree that the "fulfill
ment" they get from their work is more important than
the money and prestige they earn." That's what
Theodore Kaczynski wrote in"The Unabomber's
Manifesto."
From Derrick Jensen in"A Language Older than
Words": "Every morning when I wake up I ask myself
whether I should write or blow up a dam. Every day I
tell myself that I should continue to write. Yet I'm not
always convinced I'm making the right decision. I've
written books and I've been an activist. At the same
time I know neither a lack of words nor a lack of ac
tivism kills salmon here in the Northwest. It is the pres
ence of dams."
John Zerzan is a former Stanford student and current
anarchist. He's one of the most radical thinkers
around, criticizing not only recent technologies, but
symbolic culture in general — numbers, language ...
even keeping track of time. Here's what he said in an
interview with Derrick Jensen (from Zerzan's book,
"Running on Emptiness"):
Zerzan: In the 19605, many people, including me,
quit wearing watches.
Jensen: Fora while in my early twenties, I asked vis
itors to take off their watches as they entered my
home.
Zerzan: Even today children must be broken of
their resistance to time. This was one of the primary
reasons for the imposition of this country's manda
tory school system on a largely unwilling public.
School teaches you to be at a certain place at a cer
tain time, and prepares you for life in a factory. It
