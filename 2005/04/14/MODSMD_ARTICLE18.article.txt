Controversial speakers should be
heard and addressed, not silenced
1 attended the event described in
"Muslim Leaders Leave Israel
Event"( April 13). The students
walked out as the speaker relayed
her personal experience of walking
through a Palestinian school and see
ing posters glorifying suicide
bombers. She may have implied that
these images are pervasive, but not
that all Palestinians glorify violence.
Rania Eltom and Omar Shakir
were exposed to a different perspec
tive, just as I and other Jewish stu

dents are when we attend Muslim
Students Awareness Network-spon
sored events that are critical of Is
rael. Last night, several of my Jewish
and Israeli friends heard Israelis
being referred to as "devils" at the
"Education Under Occupation"
event hosted by the Coalition for
Justice in the Middle East. They sat
in an environment which was un
comfortable for them, listened and
asked challenging questions respect
fully as we had expected from Eltom
and Shakir.
I would also like to correct and re
spond to one of the events Shakir erro

neously described as anti-Muslim. The
speaker is Irshad Manji, a proud, prac
ticing Muslim who speaks about her
experience as a feminist and lesbian
who calls for reform within her reli
gious tradition. This lecture, entitled
"Confessions of a Muslim Dissident:
Why I Fight for Women. Jews, Gays..
. And Allah" is co-sponsored by a vari
ety of non-Jewish groups besides Hil
lel. "The Trouble with Islam Today"
— the name of her book — is certain
ly a provocative title, but no reason to
silence her voice. Irshad Manji has a
thought-provoking and important mes
sage. I encourage all to hear her speak
and to ask her challenging questions.

Legacies don't hurt Stanford's high
standards
Regarding the article about legacy ad
mission ("Legacy admissions: does a
family history at the Farm matter?"
April 13), in my nearly 30 years of vol
unteer fundraising for Stanford, we
have consistently been told that admis
sion rate for legacy students is approxi
mately double that of non-legacy stu
dents. The specific percentages have
been different each year so I believe it is
a true reporting. Typically the number
is in the high 20 percent to mid 30 per
cent range. The admission rate appears

not to be by design, but rather a consis
tent consequence.
Or to be mure dramatic, typically
over two-thirds of legacy applicants do
not gain admission — and many more
legacies don't even apply.
I think it is appropriate that the ad
mission stall be given the flexibility to
use legacy, giving history, academic and
athletic department requests and other
special circumstances as tie-breakers
when considering candidates.
I'm confident that special "status"
is only considered once the candidate
makes the qualified pool. Look
around. All of us have far more stories
of qualified candidates that didn't get
accepted versus fellow students who
didn't have what it takes to cut it aca
demically.
I'm proud of Stanford's high stan
dards. And my family will attest, every
new generation appears to face higher
standards of comparison than the previ
ous one.
