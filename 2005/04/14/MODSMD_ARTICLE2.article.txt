More than half of immigrants current
ly involved in legal proceedings do not
have legal representation. Stanford Law
Prof. Jayashri Srikantiah — herself an
immigrant — has decided to change that.
Srikantiah is the founder and director
of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at the
Law School. Originally from India, she
grew up in an immigrant community in

San Jose and has spent the majority of her
career working on immigrants' rights.
The clinic's goal is to provide law stu
dents with invaluable experience and to
provide first-class legal assistance to the
Bay Area's booming immigrant popula
tion, she said.
"What 1 am really looking for is stu
dents who are really committed to learn
ing about immigrants' rights," Srikantiah
said. "1 really welcome students who want
to learn more about something and want

to try it out."
The clinic is now working on five cases,
which Srikantiah selected based on the
educational value for students and the
needs of the Bay Area immigrant com
munity. All five cases involve either fe
male survivors of domestic violence seek
ing to change their immigration status or
lawful permanent residents with past con
victions who are in deportation proceed
ings.
Creating a brochure about the cash as

sistance program for immigrants and in
vestigating abuses in Bakersfield immi
grant detention centers are two of the
nine projects the clinic is working on.
Third-year law student Yulia Garteis
er, who is a Russian immigrant, said the
clinic has been really rewarding. She
added that the experience she gained
from participating in all aspects of devel
oping cases — especially arguing cases in
the immigration court in San Fran
cisco— confirmed her interest in
pro-bono immigration law.
"The more people involved, the
more good we can do for the world
— the better we can change peoples'
lives." Garteiser said.
The Immigrants' Rights Clinic is
the seventh clinic launched by the
Law School. Students had to apply to
work with the clinic by submitting re
sumes and essays, and eight students
were selected by Srikantiah. ITiere
number of applicants far exceeded
the available spaces, she said.
"Doing immigrant rights work is
something that is really necessary
here in the Bay Area," Srikantiah
said. "These kinds of cases provide
really meaningful learning opportu
nities for Stanford law students."
The clinic serves immigrants from
diverse backgrounds — people from
Vietnam. Romania, Mexico ant'
Korea — but the people involved in

the clinic are just as diverse. Sonya
Sanchez, a second-year law student
from New Mexico, said her experi
ence in the clinic has been amazing.
"I am the first person in my fami
ly to go to college," Sanchez said.
"I've been exposed to inequality my
entire life. The clinic is a way to work
towards equity."
Two students are assigned to
work on each of the five cases. They
are supervised by Srikantiah and at
tend weekly meetings with other at
torneys to discuss their progress. The
class component, a lecture, meets
once a week.
The clinic will be taught every se
mester, although there are currently
no plans to increase capacity. Stu
dents who wish to stay with the pro
gram will be able to continue on to an
advanced stage of the clinic.
Sanchez, who will be the only stu
dent pursuing this option during the
next academic year, said she is
hooked.
"Jayashri sets a very high bar for
the students because she wants the
people we represent to get the best
legal advice they can." she said. "It
couldn't get any better."
