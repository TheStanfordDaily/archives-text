School is bogus. I would rather
do my laundry than spend another
minute on French. Unfortunately,
I'll probably spend another minute
doing French and never do my laun
dry. Doing laundry would require
me to wait around fora machine to
open up, and god knows I have at
least three weeks of laundry to do.

You do not want
to know how
good I smell be
cause words just
can't even begin
to describe it. I
need to enroll in
a five-unit class
devoted to
chores, because
no one's going to

penalize me for not doing my laun
dry.
Fresh out of high school and des
perately afraid of college courses. 1
cared a little too much first quarter.
Required reading spilled out of me;
my life revolved around my work
load. I was no hermit, that's for sure,
hut if you didn't go to Stanford, you
probably didn't hear much from me.
The stress of putting school ahead of
life forced me to crack open a book
for pleasure. 1 needed 40 to 50 min
utes a day to devote to the mellow
pleasures of escaping into someone
else's world.
These days, I enjoy avoiding my
work. I do my work, don't get me
wrong, but I'd really rather eat in the
dining hall seven days a week than
do my work. The stack for this week
seems fairly tall. Knowing this, 1
brought Nietzsche with me to Lake
Lagunita in order to read while my
friend Lauren and 1 conquered the
Lake on our co-opted raft/flotation
device.
I stared at Lake Lag all last quar
ter. I've always liked the lake, ever
since I ventured there during Admit
Weekend, but when it's sky blue,
and the ducks are resting on the sur

face as the wind blows little waves, I
love Lake Lag. To prove my love, I
will include this embarrassing statis
tic: 1 have 107 pictures of Lake Lag's
water-filled glory. Now that it's
spring quarter, and the Lake's days
are numbered, it's time to stop tak
ing it for granted and launch my fat
ass out onto the water.
Today has been one of the more
exciting days of my life. It took Lau
ren and me awhile to figure out how
to properly steer and name Bound
erby. but give Stanford students
three hours and two large pieces of
wood, there isn't anything we can't
do. We stopped every now and then,
determined to read, and so we did,
but no matter how interesting Niet
zsche is, he's just not compelling
when I'm on a thing called Bounder
by, and we float around conquering
forests of aquatic plants in the name
of God, Glory and Amazalondra.
No book can compete with the
murky water, strange plants and
gentle rocking. Not even Alice
Munro could steal me away from the
amazing world right before me. I'm
not sure any author could convey my
day properly in the written word. I
can't either. Neither Lauren nor I
brought a camera, causing us great
distress. Sometimes words fail to
communicate.
My life at that moment is more
interesting than anything in any
book, assigned or pleasurable. Sure,
it seems sort of trite, I can image
being 65 and telling young people
about that time when I was on a raft
on a tiny, temporary lake. One day,
it'll be written in some coming-of
age novel, but that's for another
time. 1 have to go back to the lake.
We're going to raft in the darkness
and avoid doing work, because real
ly, school is bogus, man.
