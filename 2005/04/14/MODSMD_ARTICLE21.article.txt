## 'Israel at Heart' program went beyond political slogans 
### ADINA DANZIG 
The Daily's coverage of the "Is
rael at Heart" program ("Muslim
leaders leave Israel event," April 13)
does an injustice to the quality of the
program that took place. Three Is
raeli young adults shared their expe
riences living in Israel as part of a
program enabling Stanford students
to go beyond political slogans and
newspaper headlines by speaking in
person with young Israelis.
Unfortunately, the article's title
focused the readership on two Mus
lim students' decision to walk out
rather than engage in conversation
with the Israeli visitors. A more accu
rate title and article would have fo
cused the readership on the complex
dynamics of Israeli life discussed by
the presenters. In striking contrast,
on the same front page yesterday.
The Daily ran a story entitled, "Stu
dents Describe Violence in Gaza."
That article focused on the content of
the speakers of that program — and
did not include the reactions of Jew
ish students who attended.
Moreover, Omar Shakir's quote

that "three out of the first four
events in Hillel's programming for
the quarter involves blasting the Is
lamic faith" was irresponsibly print
ed without any editorial due dili
gence.
The first program on the flyer
Shakir saw was a lecture about the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict by former
left-wing Israeli Knesset member
Avraham Burg. (Interestingly, The
Daily did not elect to cover Mr.
Burg's lecture.) The third program
on that list describes film screenings
and discussions Hillel is co-sponsor
ing with the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual
and Transgender Center this week,
featuring Sandi Dubowski — a gay
Jew with a traditional religious back
ground who has stirred the Jewish
community world-wide by drawing
attention to the tensions between
traditional religious Judaism and the
challenges of gay Jews living in that
traditional world.
1 assume Shakir's comment re
ferred to two other speakers (not
three) that Hillel is co-sponsoring
with numerous other organizations
— Dr. Khaleel Mohammed, an

imam and professor of religion at
San Diego State University, and
best-selling author Irshad Manji,
who is speaking on campus on Mon
day in a lecture entitled "Confes
sions of a Muslim Dissident: Why I
Fight for Women, Jews, Gays ...
and Allah." Both speakers are prac
ticing Muslims who care about their
faith and are part of a small group of
Muslims who call fora reformist
movement within Islam. Mo
hammed and Manji both articulate
messages relevant to the Jewish
community, as they explore anti-
Semitic trends within institutional
Islam, issues relevant to Israel and
the Middle East, as well as issues re
lating to women and gays.
