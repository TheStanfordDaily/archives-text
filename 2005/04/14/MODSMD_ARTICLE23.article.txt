RE: Stanford Football 2005
Dear Coach Harris:
By this point, you hopefully have gotten to
know the men you will command when football
Reason rolls around in September. Spring practice
is underway, where the critical steps of teaching
and teambuilding begin.
The squad is returning 15 starters, very talent
ed and a year smarter. Stanford's considerable
skill will play a part in determining if anyone in the
Pac-10 will unseat USC's three-year run of domi
nance. The rest will be supplied by you, the coach.
Through your winter perusal of game films,
you will also be familiar with the team's history.

Last season's 4-2 start gave
way to a five-game losing
streak. While the team was in
position to win five more
games that it didn't, declining
health and effectiveness culmi
nated at Big Game in Berkeley
where Cal literally ran over the
Cardinal (307 rushing yards).
The 41-6 loss was all the more
besmirched by bad focus, bad
play calls and a series of ugly

personal fouls.
It was nothing like the squad that took USC to
the wire.
The tapes should show you a team with abili
ty, hut at times strategically confused and emo
tionally dead. A team that blew opportunities or
allowed the opponent to capitalize.
Indeed, these are the very reasons a coaching
change was made. It is a tide that's your responsi
bility to turn. Attitude. Confidence. Leadership.
Tempo.
The experience across the offensive line
(which my high school team affectionately re
ferred to as 'the fat guys') will hopefully keep the
offense anchored while the air game comes up to
speed. You will certainly have an able comple
ment of running backs to keep the opposing de
fense bruised.
Your reputation with quarterbacks is well
suited to dynamic Trent Edwards and impressive
backup T.C. Ostrander, who proved an ad
mirable fill-in the last three games of the season.
With the right offensive knowledge, the passing
game should be OK.
A place that might need a little work is the
catching game. Last year's Big Game featured,
among other things, an unacceptably high num
ber of drops by wide receivers.
You have already convinced Evan Moore and
Mark Bradford to drop basketball; now it's time
for them and senior Justin McCullum to become
focused, reliable football players.
Your dossier at Pitt included several outstand
ing wide receivers. Here's hoping the magic touch
continues with this year's crop.
Jon Alston and Julian Jenkins highlight key
returnees to a headhunting defensive unit that
had the unfortunate tendency to tire. While Jared
Newberry and Oshimogho Atogwe are gone, a
seasoned corps remains in the front seven to ha
rass the opposition.
People may have told you that football doesn't
matter on this campus. Well, let it be said that it
matters to me and to a lot of damn people around
here. We'll be behind the team, and winning will
bring the rest of them out of the woodwork.
As far as the (in)famous Band goes, we 11...
