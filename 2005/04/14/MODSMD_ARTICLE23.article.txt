# The 						Double Clutch

RE: Stanford Football 2005
Dear Coach Harris:
By this point, you hopefully have gotten to
know the men you will command when football
Reason rolls around in September. Spring practice
is underway, where the critical steps of teaching
and teambuilding begin.
The squad is returning 15 starters, very talent
ed and a year smarter. Stanford's considerable
skill will play a part in determining if anyone in the
Pac-10 will unseat USC's three-year run of domi
nance. The rest will be supplied by you, the coach.
Through your winter perusal of game films,
you will also be familiar with the team's history.

Last season's 4-2 start gave
way to a five-game losing
streak. While the team was in
position to win five more
games that it didn't, declining
health and effectiveness culmi
nated at Big Game in Berkeley
where Cal literally ran over the
Cardinal (307 rushing yards).
The 41-6 loss was all the more
besmirched by bad focus, bad
play calls and a series of ugly

personal fouls.
It was nothing like the squad that took USC to
the wire.
The tapes should show you a team with abili
ty, hut at times strategically confused and emo
tionally dead. A team that blew opportunities or
allowed the opponent to capitalize.
Indeed, these are the very reasons a coaching
change was made. It is a tide that's your responsi
bility to turn. Attitude. Confidence. Leadership.
Tempo.
The experience across the offensive line
(which my high school team affectionately re
ferred to as 'the fat guys') will hopefully keep the
offense anchored while the air game comes up to
speed. You will certainly have an able comple
ment of running backs to keep the opposing de
fense bruised.
Your reputation with quarterbacks is well
suited to dynamic Trent Edwards and impressive
backup T.C. Ostrander, who proved an ad
mirable fill-in the last three games of the season.
With the right offensive knowledge, the passing
game should be OK.
A place that might need a little work is the
catching game. Last year's Big Game featured,
among other things, an unacceptably high num
ber of drops by wide receivers.
You have already convinced Evan Moore and
Mark Bradford to drop basketball; now it's time
for them and senior Justin McCullum to become
focused, reliable football players.
Your dossier at Pitt included several outstand
ing wide receivers. Here's hoping the magic touch
continues with this year's crop.
Jon Alston and Julian Jenkins highlight key
returnees to a headhunting defensive unit that
had the unfortunate tendency to tire. While Jared
Newberry and Oshimogho Atogwe are gone, a
seasoned corps remains in the front seven to ha
rass the opposition.
People may have told you that football doesn't
matter on this campus. Well, let it be said that it
matters to me and to a lot of damn people around
here. We'll be behind the team, and winning will
bring the rest of them out of the woodwork.
As far as the (in)famous Band goes, we 11...


Christopher
Anderson
I've spent enough ink defending them. You'll be
in the locker room whenever they're doing their
deeds anyway, so don't worry about them.
As you know, every game is important. How
ever, you will have three benchmark games by
which your first campaign will be judged: USC,
Notre Dame and Cal (in order of importance).
They are all in November, and while injuries
may be a factor, by that time the entire team
should be playing on the same page.
Notre Dame may be the toughest, because it
comes after Big Game, with the team mentally ex
hausted and with many fans at home. Nonethe
less, a three-game home winning streak against
the Irish was broken two seasons ago with a 50-
point blowout.
The team is ready fora great season. We in the
community are as well, and hungrily awaiting it.
I will leave you with one final request. I may be
alone in this, but I think the program should re
move the black trim from the uniforms that was
installed at the start of the Teevens era.
For decades, the only adjustment to the Stan
ford uniform was to resize the'S' on the helmet. It
was quite simply the Stanford Uniform. That was
good enough for Darrin Nelson, Michael Cordo
va and John Elway; John Lynch and Ed McCaf
frey; and the Rosey bunch that included Todd
Husak, Willie Howard, Troy Walters and Marc
Stockbauer.
The need to modify the uniform was not clear
to me, and at the front of what is hopefully a re
birth, I suggest we return to tradition, starting with
what's on the outside.
The age of the Trim is one that the program
would just as soon forget anyway. Call it an idea
whose time has gone.
Sincerely,
Christopher P. Anderson

the wire.
The tapes should show you a team with abili
ty, hut at times strategically confused and emo
tionally dead. A team that blew opportunities or
allowed the opponent to capitalize.
Indeed, these are the very reasons a coaching
change was made. It is a tide that's your responsi
bility to turn. Attitude. Confidence. Leadership.
Tempo.
The experience across the offensive line
(which my high school team affectionately re
ferred to as 'the fat guys') will hopefully keep the
offense anchored while the air game comes up to
speed. You will certainly have an able comple
ment of running backs to keep the opposing de
fense bruised.
Your reputation with quarterbacks is well
suited to dynamic Trent Edwards and impressive
backup T.C. Ostrander, who proved an ad
mirable fill-in the last three games of the season.
With the right offensive knowledge, the passing
game should be OK.
A place that might need a little work is the
catching game. Last year's Big Game featured,
among other things, an unacceptably high num
ber of drops by wide receivers.
You have already convinced Evan Moore and
Mark Bradford to drop basketball; now it's time
for them and senior Justin McCullum to become
focused, reliable football players.
Your dossier at Pitt included several outstand
ing wide receivers. Here's hoping the magic touch
continues with this year's crop.
Jon Alston and Julian Jenkins highlight key
returnees to a headhunting defensive unit that
had the unfortunate tendency to tire. While Jared
Newberry and Oshimogho Atogwe are gone, a
seasoned corps remains in the front seven to ha
rass the opposition.
People may have told you that football doesn't
matter on this campus. Well, let it be said that it
matters to me and to a lot of damn people around
here. We'll be behind the team, and winning will
bring the rest of them out of the woodwork.
As far as the (in)famous Band goes, we 11...

I've spent enough ink defending them. You'll be
in the locker room whenever they're doing their
deeds anyway, so don't worry about them.
As you know, every game is important. How
ever, you will have three benchmark games by
which your first campaign will be judged: USC,
Notre Dame and Cal (in order of importance).
They are all in November, and while injuries
may be a factor, by that time the entire team
should be playing on the same page.
Notre Dame may be the toughest, because it
comes after Big Game, with the team mentally ex
hausted and with many fans at home. Nonethe
less, a three-game home winning streak against
the Irish was broken two seasons ago with a 50-
point blowout.
The team is ready fora great season. We in the
community are as well, and hungrily awaiting it.
I will leave you with one final request. I may be
alone in this, but I think the program should re
move the black trim from the uniforms that was
installed at the start of the Teevens era.
For decades, the only adjustment to the Stan
ford uniform was to resize the'S' on the helmet. It
was quite simply the Stanford Uniform. That was
good enough for Darrin Nelson, Michael Cordo
va and John Elway; John Lynch and Ed McCaf
frey; and the Rosey bunch that included Todd
Husak, Willie Howard, Troy Walters and Marc
Stockbauer.
The need to modify the uniform was not clear
to me, and at the front of what is hopefully a re
birth, I suggest we return to tradition, starting with
what's on the outside.
The age of the Trim is one that the program
would just as soon forget anyway. Call it an idea
whose time has gone.
Sincerely,
Christopher P. Anderson
