## Kosty looks back 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITER 
In the 15 years he has been with the
Stanford men's volleyball program, asso
ciate head coach John Kosty has seen his
share of great players. After all, he
helped lead Stanford to the national title
in 1997.
But as the No. 9 Cardinal (11-12, 10-
10 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
end regular season play this weekend
against No. 6 Brigham Young (18-9, 13-
7), Kosty admits that it will be particular
ly hard to see this year's three seniors
leave.
"It will be a huge difference [next
year]," Kosty said. "I think Craig Buell
brings a lot of energy and emotion, espe
cially in matches. Dave Vogel brings con
sistency to our outside hitting position.
And Kevin Hansen is Kevin Hansen. So,
it's going to be really different next
year."
Hansen, a redshirt senior, is third on
Stanford's list in career assists. He has
been named to the All-MPSF team three
times and was named a third-team All-
American at the end of last season.
"Kevin's the best setter in the coun
try, and you can't replace him," Kosty
said. "He's been here five years; he's
been a fixture. There are a lot of teams
that are happy that he's leaving. They're
tired of seeing him on the other side of
the net."
The Cougars, the defending NCAA
champions, will see Hansen a lot this
weekend, as they play back-to-back
matches Friday and Saturday against the
Cardinal. Friday will be the first meeting
between the teams this season.
"I'm expecting the hardest jump
serves we've seen all season," Kosty said.
"I think the firepower of BYU is some
thing we're going to have to figure out
and control. I don't think they're a great
passing team; they rely on their serves
and their outside hitters. They've got
Victor Batista, who is a tremendous
force."
From his position on the sidelines,
Kosty remembers what it was like to be
out there on the court. He has been play
ing volleyball competitively since 1979,
when he was a sophomore in high school.
He was an All-American at UC-Santa
Barbara and a member of the U.S.J unior
National Team. But the move from all
star to coach was a small challenge.
"It's easy now," Kosty said of coach
ing. "It's easy when you're out of shape,
and you can't play any more. When I first

started, it was difficult. I kind of got that
out of my system. You evolve as a coach.
Most coaches start as a player, and
there's a line you have to cross from
being a player to a coach. The faster you
make that transition, the better [a] coach
you're going to be."
Being a good coach means more than
just knowing how to run an effective
practice. As associate head coach, Kosty
is responsible for everything from prac
tice feedback to making sure the game
balls are where they need to be for
matches. With only one head coach, the
behind-the-scenes work becomes largely
the associate's responsibility.
"The most challenging part of my job
is to make sure all the little things get
done," Kosty said. "Just to make sure
that the athletes are taken care of, and if
they're not being taken care of, making
sure that things happen ... That's the
toughest thing for me: to make sure
things don't fall through the cracks."
The reward of seeing the team run ef
ficiently and smoothly is just one of the
things Kosty enjoys about his job in ath
letics. He's undertaken numerous pro
jects outside of his responsibility to the
Cardinal, from running golf tournaments
to running summer camps, but matches
and practices, he says, are the fun thing
about coaching.
Kosty's dedication to his job is evi
dent to anyone involved with the team.
In fact, he laughs that if there's one thing
the players don't know about him, it's
that there's more to him than Stanford
volleyball.
"Since I live 25 miles away, only a few
players in 15 years have ever been to my
house," he said. "A few players know
that I go waterskiing every summer. And
I have a six-month baby daughter now.
But sometimes they think I live here.
Sometimes I think I live here!"
Still, looking back on this year, Kosty
said he feels that his efforts have paid off.
"I think it's been a successful season
for us so far," he said. "We've got the
confidence going into the playoffs that
we can beat anybody."
There's no denying that the MPSF
playoffs will be challenging for the Car
dinal as the bottom seed. According to
Kosty, playing in the strongest league in
the country creates a dangerous situa
tion: if one match is dropped in tourna
ment play, he says, the Cardinal will miss
out on the NCAAs.
Kosty said that Stanford has im
proved over the course of the season.

Junior Ben Reddy, one of the many Cardinal players assistant John Kosty has worked with dur

While the seniors have carried the team, other
players have played key roles as well.
"Brian Lindberg's growth as a starting libero

"And then there's Kevin," he added. "Our
team is Kevin Hansen. When Kevin plays well,
like he did against UCLA, we can beat any
body."
Prior to the start of Saturday's match,
Hansen, Buell and Vogel will all be honored in
a special ceremony. Though sad to see them
leave. Kosty said he has enjoyed having the op
portunity to coach them and the countless other
players he has seen come and go.
"It's an honor to be a part of this university
and to be coaching at this university and in this
league," Kosty said. "It's been a fast and fun
road the last 15 years, and I look forward to
hopefully another 15 years here."

league," Kosty said. "It's been a fast and fun
road the last 15 years, and I look forward to
hopefully another 15 years here."
In the 15 years he has been with the
Stanford men's volleyball program, asso
ciate head coach John Kosty has seen his
share of great players. After all, he
helped lead Stanford to the national title
in 1997.
But as the No. 9 Cardinal (11-12, 10-
10 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
end regular season play this weekend
against No. 6 Brigham Young (18-9, 13-
7), Kosty admits that it will be particular
ly hard to see this year's three seniors
leave.
"It will be a huge difference [next
year]," Kosty said. "I think Craig Buell
brings a lot of energy and emotion, espe
cially in matches. Dave Vogel brings con
sistency to our outside hitting position.
And Kevin Hansen is Kevin Hansen. So,
it's going to be really different next
year."
Hansen, a redshirt senior, is third on
Stanford's list in career assists. He has
been named to the All-MPSF team three
times and was named a third-team All-
American at the end of last season.
"Kevin's the best setter in the coun
try, and you can't replace him," Kosty
said. "He's been here five years; he's
been a fixture. There are a lot of teams
that are happy that he's leaving. They're
tired of seeing him on the other side of
the net."
The Cougars, the defending NCAA
champions, will see Hansen a lot this
weekend, as they play back-to-back
matches Friday and Saturday against the
Cardinal. Friday will be the first meeting
between the teams this season.
"I'm expecting the hardest jump
serves we've seen all season," Kosty said.
"I think the firepower of BYU is some
thing we're going to have to figure out
and control. I don't think they're a great
passing team; they rely on their serves
and their outside hitters. They've got
Victor Batista, who is a tremendous
force."
From his position on the sidelines,
Kosty remembers what it was like to be
out there on the court. He has been play
ing volleyball competitively since 1979,
when he was a sophomore in high school.
He was an All-American at UC-Santa
Barbara and a member of the U.S.J unior
National Team. But the move from all
star to coach was a small challenge.
"It's easy now," Kosty said of coach
ing. "It's easy when you're out of shape,
and you can't play any more. When I first

started, it was difficult. I kind of got that
out of my system. You evolve as a coach.
Most coaches start as a player, and
there's a line you have to cross from
being a player to a coach. The faster you
make that transition, the better [a] coach
you're going to be."
Being a good coach means more than
just knowing how to run an effective
practice. As associate head coach, Kosty
is responsible for everything from prac
tice feedback to making sure the game
balls are where they need to be for
matches. With only one head coach, the
behind-the-scenes work becomes largely
the associate's responsibility.
"The most challenging part of my job
is to make sure all the little things get
done," Kosty said. "Just to make sure
that the athletes are taken care of, and if
they're not being taken care of, making
sure that things happen ... That's the
toughest thing for me: to make sure
things don't fall through the cracks."
The reward of seeing the team run ef
ficiently and smoothly is just one of the
things Kosty enjoys about his job in ath
letics. He's undertaken numerous pro
jects outside of his responsibility to the
Cardinal, from running golf tournaments
to running summer camps, but matches
and practices, he says, are the fun thing
about coaching.
Kosty's dedication to his job is evi
dent to anyone involved with the team.
In fact, he laughs that if there's one thing
the players don't know about him, it's
that there's more to him than Stanford
volleyball.
"Since I live 25 miles away, only a few
players in 15 years have ever been to my
house," he said. "A few players know
that I go waterskiing every summer. And
I have a six-month baby daughter now.
But sometimes they think I live here.
Sometimes I think I live here!"
Still, looking back on this year, Kosty
said he feels that his efforts have paid off.
"I think it's been a successful season
for us so far," he said. "We've got the
confidence going into the playoffs that
we can beat anybody."
There's no denying that the MPSF
playoffs will be challenging for the Car
dinal as the bottom seed. According to
Kosty, playing in the strongest league in
the country creates a dangerous situa
tion: if one match is dropped in tourna
ment play, he says, the Cardinal will miss
out on the NCAAs.
Kosty said that Stanford has im
proved over the course of the season.

Junior Ben Reddy, one of the many Cardinal players assistant John Kosty has worked with dur
ing his 15 years on the Farm, and No. 9 Stanford take on BYU this Friday and Saturday.
While the seniors have carried the team, other
players have played key roles as well.
"Brian Lindberg's growth as a starting libero
in this league has been tremendous," Kosty
said. "He's shown that he belongs in this
league."
"And then there's Kevin," he added. "Our
team is Kevin Hansen. When Kevin plays well,
like he did against UCLA, we can beat any
body."
Prior to the start of Saturday's match,
Hansen, Buell and Vogel will all be honored in
a special ceremony. Though sad to see them
leave. Kosty said he has enjoyed having the op
portunity to coach them and the countless other
players he has seen come and go.
