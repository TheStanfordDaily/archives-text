# Men fall in familiar fashion to Pepperdine
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 16 Stanford men's tennis team
lost a close 4-3 match on Tuesday afternoon
to a top-10 team after losing the doubles
point.
Sound familiar?
By now, it should. This is the sixth time
this season the Cardinal (12-9, 3-2 Pacific
-10 Conference) have been edged out by this
score by one of the top teams in the nation.
Stanford prepared itself fora test
against No. 8 Pepperdine at home. Stanford

had played matches in three of the previous
four days and had taken early morning
practice on Monday before Tuesday's
match with the Waves, who upset then-No.
2 Illinois at the end of March.
Tuesday's victory marked Pepperdine's
12th consecutive win, with its last loss com
ing against top-ranked Baylor back in
February.
"It was one of those close [4-3] matches
again," head coach John Whitlinger said.
"We just need to find one more point some
where. The guys see the light at the end of
the tunnel, but they can't quite get there

yet. We're so close and have been saying
that all season so there's a little bit of frus
tration mounting."
Doubles play was suspenseful and frus
tratingly close. At one point, senior Sam
Warburg and junior KC Corkery were even
at 6-6 in the top doubles spot, senior Phil
Sheng and junior Jon Wong were up 6-5
and sophomores Eric McKean and James
Wan were down 5-6.
In the third doubles match, a lob over
Wan gave Pepperdine the advantage, and
then a low volley into the bottom of the net
gave the Waves the break. With Pepper

dine leading 7-5 in the following game and
on match-point, a Stanford forehand sailed
long to give the third doubles match to the
Waves.
Shortly after McKean and Wan finished,
the remaining two matches went to
tiebreakers.
Pepperdine picked up the doubles point
as Wong dropped a volley into the net.
Stanford's Corkery and Warburg and the
Pepperdine duo had two match-points
apiece in the top spot before the score
broke even at 8-8 in the tiebreaker. How-
ever, with a double fault and a
missed return, the Cardinal tandem
suffered the final doubles defeat.
"Our returning has not been as
good recently," Warburg said. "Usu
ally we break people really easily but
we have not been able to break a lot
lately."
Warburg's partner said he agreed
that the duo has recently hit a small
bump.
"We just aren't getting as good of
starts as we normally get, and it's frus
trating in a pro-set where everything
happens so fast," Corkery said. "I feel
like we'll get it back together."
As singles play began, the score
board was divided right down the
middle. Stanford won the first game
in all top three singles matches,
while Pepperdine picked up the first
game in the bottom half. The scores
foreshadowed later results.
While Corkery broke in his first
game, his opponent. No. 46 Scott
Doerner, broke back immediately
and took the rest of the first set. Sim
ilarly, while Wan broke Jonas Berg
in their first game. Berg replied with
a break in the following game and
both players had a difficult time
holding serve in the match.
With a shot past Berg's back
hand, Wan won the first set, 6-3. The
sophomore and Warburg were the
only Stanford players to win their
first sets. Stanford players in the re
maining four matches won a total of
five games.
On Warburg's match-point. No.
13 Pedro Rico's attempt to make a
backhand pickup went into the net,
giving Warburg a 6-4,6-2 victory and
the first Stanford point.
But only moments later, fresh
man Phil Kao walked slowly off his
court after being handed a 6-0. 6-3
defeat.
After losing nine straight games.
McKean managed to pick up one
game to go 1 -4 in the second set. The
sophomore's loss gave Pepperdine
its third point.
Stanford needed to win all three
of the final matches to defeat Pep
perdine, and Corkery and Sheng

were both at 6-6 and down a set.
Wan led 5-4 in the second set and
picked up another Cardinal win.
While Corkery won his second
set tiebreaker versus Doerner 7-5,
Sheng could not do the same.
Sheng's loss gave the Waves their
fourth point and consequently, the
win.
The Stanford men then quietly
made their way behind Corkery's
court to support their teammate in
his final set. Appearing much more
at ease than in his first set, Corkery

won the third, 6-1, throwing in a be
tween-the-legs shot in the middle of
the set.
"1 came out, I was frustrated
[from doubles] and before I knew it,
the first set was over," Corkery said.
"But I thought I did a good job of
staying focused and giving myself a
chance to win the match. You're not
going to play your best every time
you go out on the court. Today I was
fortunate enough to find a few things
that were working for me, even
though normally what I'd be trying

to do wasn't there."
Stanford will face California Sat
urday on Senior Day, which will
honor Sheng and Warburg. The
match will be another challenging
one - the Bears upset No. 7 UCLA
last weekend and they have the No.
16 singles competitor and the No. 21
doubles duo.
"I really think our guys will come
out fired up on Saturday, and when
ever Stanford and Cal get together
for any sporting event, it's always a
great match." Whitlinger said.
