### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 16 Stanford men's tennis team
lost a close 4-3 match on Tuesday afternoon
to a top-10 team after losing the doubles
point.
Sound familiar?
By now, it should. This is the sixth time
this season the Cardinal (12-9, 3-2 Pacific
-10 Conference) have been edged out by this
score by one of the top teams in the nation.
Stanford prepared itself fora test
against No. 8 Pepperdine at home. Stanford

had played matches in three of the previous
four days and had taken early morning
practice on Monday before Tuesday's
match with the Waves, who upset then-No.

Wan were down 5-6.
In the third doubles match, a lob over
Wan gave Pepperdine the advantage, and
then a low volley into the bottom of the net
gave the Waves the break. With Pepper

dine leading 7-5 in the following game and
on match-point, a Stanford forehand sailed
long to give the third doubles match to the
Waves.
Shortly after McKean and Wan finished,
the remaining two matches went to
tiebreakers.
Pepperdine picked up the doubles point
as Wong dropped a volley into the net.
Stanford's Corkery and Warburg and the
Pepperdine duo had two match-points
apiece in the top spot before the score
broke even at 8-8 in the tiebreaker. How-
