# Practices now simulate races
## Women jump to No. 2 with strong outing 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a boost from their excellent performances at
the St. Francis regatta last weekend, the Stanford
women's and coed sailing teams continued their ascent
in the national rankings. The competition, co-hosted
by Stanford Sailing and the St. Francis Yacht Club,
saw 31 teams assemble at the shores of the San Fran
cisco Bay for two days of competition.
Amid winds that approached 15 knots at times, the
coed squad finished third at the regatta with a total
score of 91 points.
"We sail primarily double-handed boats called
FJ's, or Flying Juniors," coach Amy Kehoe said.
"They are sailed by two people: the skipper and the
crew. A team consists of four sailors, two in [each of
the] two boats. Each boat sails separate races, in the A
division and B-division, and their scores are totaled for
a combined score. The team with the lowest score
wins."
In coed racing, men sail with women because the
boat needs to be of lighter weight and still be compet
itive. Because the optimal weight is no more than 250
pounds, the easiest way to accomplish this goal is to
have a male skipper paired with a lightweight and
strong female crew.

crew Becca Levin in the A-division;
they scored 40 points. In the B-divi
sion, freshman Eddie Conrad and ju
nior Anna Vu raced Saturday but
were replaced on Sunday by the se
nior skipper-crew duo of Pete Dem
ing and Lucy Horton. Stanford fin
ished first in the B-division with 51
points, and thanks to the solid show
ing the coed team jumped from 14th
to 11th in the country and third in
California.
"The results were great," Amy
Kehoe said. "We were second all day
behind [No. 7] UC-Irvine, but got
passed by [No. 5 Southern Califor
nia] in the last two races."
This weekend, Stanford will send
its three coed duos to King's Point,
N.Y.. for the Admiral's Cup at the
U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.
The same three pairs will head to
Long Beach. Calif., for the national
qualifiers from April 29 to May 1.
"The Admiral's Cup is a three-di
vision event," Amy Kehoe said.
"The A-division [will sail) in 420's, a
two-person dinghy. The B-division
will compete in FJ's, and the C-divi
sion in Lasers, a single-handed boat.
There will be 20 teams there, mostly
from the East Coast. It's the last big
regatta before the national champi
onships in June."
The women's team was also im
pressive at the St. Francis regatta as it
finished first among all the women's

teams and fifth overall with a score of
200 points. Freshmen Evan Brown
and Mariana Beardsworth sailed in
the A-Division Saturday, followed
by seniors Liz Rountree and Julie
Pitts on Sunday. Cardinal sopho
mores Caroline Young and Alexa
Binns competed in the B-Division.
Riding this success, the Stanford
women jumped from fourth to sec
ond place in the national rankings
behind top-ranked Charleston.
"This team is exactly where we
want to be," coach Jay Kehoe said.
"The women's qualifier is next week
and it's a home event so we're
primed to do well. We get great lead
ership from Rountree, Young and
others. Freshman Evan Brown is
sailing amazingly right now. Talent
wise, we're a deep and young team,
and that's great."
The women's Pacific Coast Cham
pionships will head out from the Stan
ford Boathouse on April 23 and 24.
For both the women's and coed team,
seven national regions hold qualifiers
for the National Championships to be
held at Texas, which will span the first
10 days of June.
In order to prepare for these pres
sure-packed races, both teams have
varied their practices in order to
more directly apply them to racing.
"In the beginning of the year we
practice a lot of boat handling ma
neuvers and try to get them down
pat." Jay Kehoe said. "In sailing,
there are a lot of repetitions, so now
we're working on those. Sailing can
be a lot like chess, and it's because of
that that our practices are now de
signed to simulate races."

behind top-ranked Charleston.
"This team is exactly where we
want to be," coach Jay Kehoe said.
"The women's qualifier is next week
and it's a home event so we're
primed to do well. We get great lead
ership from Rountree, Young and
others. Freshman Evan Brown is
sailing amazingly right now. Talent
wise, we're a deep and young team,
and that's great."
The women's Pacific Coast Cham
pionships will head out from the Stan
ford Boathouse on April 23 and 24.
For both the women's and coed team,
seven national regions hold qualifiers
for the National Championships to be
held at Texas, which will span the first
10 days of June.
In order to prepare for these pres
sure-packed races, both teams have
varied their practices in order to
more directly apply them to racing.
"In the beginning of the year we
practice a lot of boat handling ma
neuvers and try to get them down
pat." Jay Kehoe said. "In sailing,
there are a lot of repetitions, so now
we're working on those. Sailing can
be a lot like chess, and it's because of
that that our practices are now de
signed to simulate races."
