With a boost from their excellent performances at
the St. Francis regatta last weekend, the Stanford
women's and coed sailing teams continued their ascent
in the national rankings. The competition, co-hosted
by Stanford Sailing and the St. Francis Yacht Club,
saw 31 teams assemble at the shores of the San Fran
cisco Bay for two days of competition.
Amid winds that approached 15 knots at times, the
coed squad finished third at the regatta with a total
score of 91 points.
"We sail primarily double-handed boats called
FJ's, or Flying Juniors," coach Amy Kehoe said.
"They are sailed by two people: the skipper and the
crew. A team consists of four sailors, two in [each of
the] two boats. Each boat sails separate races, in the A
division and B-division, and their scores are totaled for
a combined score. The team with the lowest score
wins."
In coed racing, men sail with women because the
boat needs to be of lighter weight and still be compet
itive. Because the optimal weight is no more than 250
pounds, the easiest way to accomplish this goal is to
have a male skipper paired with a lightweight and
strong female crew.

of sophomore skipper Emery Wager and sophomore


Both the coed and women's teams saw their spot in the rankings change for the better after the St. Francis Regatta in San Francisco.Three coed duos head to New York this weekend.
