# Stanford hosts pivotal tourney
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal finished fifth at the U.S. Intercollegiate, their
second home tournament, wrapping up a lackluster regular sea
son. They followed it up with a disastrous lOth-place perfor
mance at the Pacific-10 Conference Championships and a 24th
place showing at the NCAA Western Regional.
That, folks, was last year.
Under first-year head coach Conrad Ray, the Cardinal have
collected three top-five finishes compared to last year's two and
have an eye on their fourth as they close out their regular season
at home. This team has worked for bigger things this time
around.
"We set some goals at the beginning of the year that definite
ly stemmed out of disappointment last year and maybe the year
before, also," junior Scott Mac Donald said.
Before the team can make its postseason amends, however, it
must take care of business here and now. Teams don't just turn
on the success once the stage is big and the lights are bright. Low
scores in Palo Alto this weekend are critical to seeing more of
the same in two weeks.
"1 think our whole season pretty much rides on this home
tournament," junior Kyle Gentry said. "This is our house, and
we've got to protect it. We know this track better than anyone
else. If we can't succeed at this tournament and on our home
course, then I don't know where we can."
Stanford is coming off a disappointing 12th-place finish at the
ASU Thunderbird Invitational in Tempe, Ariz., and hopes that
some home cooking will be just the thing to get the team back on
track.
"Stanford's the type of course that if you play it a lot, there's
definitely an advantage," Ray said. "I think with all that factored
in and the fact that we've got great weather coming in and a re
ally super field, it definitely gets everyone's attention and gets
them to want to play well."
If history is any indication, sunny Stanford skies could bring
Ray's squad some much needed momentum. A fourth-place fin
ish at this year's Nelson Invitational at Stanford is one of the sea
son's best, and a fifth-place showing at last year's Intercollegiate
should provide some confidence as the Cardinal try to defend
their home course once again.
Gentry notched a fourth-place finish individually a year ago,
the best showing of his career, while sophomore Zack Miller and
senior Kevin Blue both found themselves in the top 25.
Of course, Stanford isn't the only team with pleasant memo
ries from last year's event. No. 14 UCLA has spent the past year
polishing its team trophy and is no doubt eager to get a firsthand
look at this year's new model.
After missing last year's tournament. No. 12 Arizona State,
No. 16 Arizona and No. 19 Southern California will also be on
the Farm this weekend, adding to a field that should be even
tougher than the one that will compete at the Pac-10 Tourna
ment.
San Diego State's Aaron Goldberg will look to defend the in
dividual title he won by three shots over UCLA's John Merrick.
As Stanford gears up for its final regular-season event and the
impending postseason, there is one other complication worth
noting. The Cardinal men will play holes No. 3 and 4 for the first
time this weekend, just as the women did a week ago.
The widening of Sand Hill Road and the subsequent remod
eling of the golf course will make Friday's practice round the first
peek at the new landscape for host and visitor alike.
"[Playing those holes for the first time] is going to be really
difficult," Gentry said. "Based on what I've seen, if I can get
through there with two bogies I'll be ecstatic, because those
holes are tough."
Players will tackle No. 3, No. 4 and Stanford's 16 other holes
beginning with an 8 a.m. shotgun start Saturday. Play will be con
tinuous for 36 holes Saturday, with a closing 18 holes beginning
at 8 a.m. Sunday.

With holes No. 3 and No. 4 now open at the Stanford golf course, sophomore Matt Savage and the Cardinal will
play a slightly different course this weekend. The men aim fora better finish at this year's U.S. Collegiate.
