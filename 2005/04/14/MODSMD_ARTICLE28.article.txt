# Progressive community strives to heal rifts
## 
### JENNY BAER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a growing number of progressive groups
on campus, some politically active students have
expressed concern that rills are opening between
the more radical and moderate wings of the liber
al community.
While some groups, such as the Stanford De
mocrats and the relatively new Roosevelt Institu
tion. adhere more often to the Democratic party
line, more specialized organizations, including the
Anti-Lemmings Collective, the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition, or SLAC, and the Stanford
Community for Peace and Justice, advocate major
changes to the American political system.
Many students belong to multiple groups with
in one category or the other. Freshman Lindsay
Reinsmith â€” who belongs to the staff of The Pro
gressive, Stanford's liberal publication, the Stan
lord Democrats and the Roosevelt Institution
said she does not favor one group over the other.
"The Progressive is important to me because
we ptoduce something that students enjoy read
ing.'' she said. "While I really enjoy my work in the
Roosevelt Institution, it's meaningful to me in a

different way. I'm slill surrounded by students
who share similar views and I get to contribute to
the group."
Very few students, however, bridge the gap be
tween the more traditional liberal organizations
and their activist peers.
"I feel like some groups are more interested
than working within the system." said sophomore
Alexandra Goldman, a member of the Anti-Lem
mings Collective and SLAC. "Those people might
go on to work with the Democratic Party and pol
itics. while other groups recognize that working
within the system often doesn't work to make real
change."
Goldman added that she believes there are
more effective ways to make a difference in society
than writing policy papers. She said that the Roo
sevelt Institute itself is founded on the prestige of
the students who organized it and does not strive to
challenge the privilege these students enjoy.
"Parents of kids who come to Stanford are gen
erally not service workers," Goldman said.
"Through considering these situations and deal
ing with issues ol labor and class we [at SLAC]
have a consciousness of the class of people who
gel to come to a university like Stanford."

Goldman added that it is apparent that not
everyone within Stanford's progressive communi
ty agrees with other groups' tactics, hut that gen
erally speaking these students are trying to forge a
broader, inclusive coalition.
In this spirit, events such as last Saturday's Pro
gressive Potluck are aimed to facilitate communi
cation between the various organizations and dis
solve any burgeoning tensions.
"There is still a lot of unification to be done,"
Goldman said. "Not all the groups that have pro
gressive agendas feel that the Progressive Potluck
is a place to make change. Not all groups were in
volved for various reasons. The Progressive
Potluck by no means defines the community."
Graduate student Kai Stinchcombe, one of the
leaders of the Roosevelt Institution, said that he
found the dialogue at the potluck to be very valu
able. Sophomore Marie Jonas, president of the
Stanford Democrats, echoed this sentiment,
adding that ultimately all of the groups share a
common cause.
"If there is a general message from the pro
gressive community, it is to get involved with
something and become aware of our surround
ings," she said.
