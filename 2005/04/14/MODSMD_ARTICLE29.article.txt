# Goal set to strengthen GSC-ASSU relations
## New members join GSC 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council meeting
appeared unusually crowded last night, as
the governing body welcomed newly-elect
ed members from last week's ASSU elec
tions to their first official meeting in the
Graduate Community Center.
"It's really an exciting day for me to
welcome new faces to the GSC family,"
said current GSC Chair Moriah Thoma
son. "I look forward to what is to come
this upcoming year."
She also congratulated the winners of
the ASSU executive election, juniors
Melanie Kannokada and Aneto Okonkwo,
who were in attendance. The chair pledged
to work with the new ASSU members from
the start of their tenure, hoping to continue
the trend of improving GSC-ASSU rela
tions.
However, Thomason told her audience
that there remains ample room for im
provement, admitting that "a lot of grad stu
dents don't understand the relationship be
tween the GSC and the ASSU."
Kannokada said she was also commit
ted to improving the relationship be
tween graduate students and undergrad
uate students, and planning a number of
programs to strengthen ties between the
two communities.
"One of the things we want to work with
GSC and the Undergraduate Advising Pro
gram is to begin a mentoring program be
tween grad students and juniors and se
niors," she said. "It will foster a better rela
tionship between graduate students and un
dergrads."
According to the president-elect, anoth
er proposition is to have a graduate student
on the executive cabinet "to have direct in
teraction" with herself and vice president
elect Okonkwo.
"The most important thing is to hear
their ideas," Kannokada added. "There
still is a huge learning hill we have to
climb to understand their issues. We're
open to their suggestions. We really want
to commit ourselves to working with
them and addressing their concerns. We
want more of them presenting their ideas
to us."
According to Kannokada, other long
term goals include increasing doctoral stu
dent stipends as well as helping internation
al students obtain financial aid.

"We want to work with the Board of
Trustees to find creative ways to get finan
cial aid," she said.
Elections Commissioner Troy Stein
metz, a sophomore, was on hand to ensure
that the GSC raised no concerns or calls for
election invalidation.
"I wanted to make sure nobody had any
issues, concerns or complaints with the bal
lot," he said.
Introducing an ASSU-GSC joint bill,
Steinmetz told the GSC that the elections
reform process is not completely over.
"There are still some things in the
rules and by-laws that need to be cleaned
up," he said. "We're just trying to make
everything as clear and as smooth as pos
sible."
The GSC passed the bill — designed to
remove outdated language from the ASSU
by-laws — by a unanimous vote. The bill
had already passed an ASSU vote Tuesday
night.
Steinmetz also noted that the number of
graduate students who voted increased
from 1,324 students last year to 1,558 this
year, meaning that roughly 5 percent of
graduate students voted in last week's elec
tions.
While the turnout was low compared
to that of the undergraduate population,
Thomason emphasized the importance
of including any interested students in
graduate community leadership and ex
tended open arms to those interested in
the GSC who were not elected in last
week's balloting.
"We really want to get everyone in
volved," she said, stressing that non-elected
graduate students who want to work with
the CiSC can hold critical positions within
the council.
"The more people that are involved in
our organization, the more we can get done
as a group," she said. "We're working hard
to make sure these people are still tied into
our community."
Adam Beberg. a first-year engineering
doctoral student and member of several
GSC committees, agreed.
"Unlike the Senate, non-voting mem
bers can participate as much as voting mem
bers in the GSC," he said.
The GSC also passed by consensus three
funding requests from the Hopkins Marine
Graduate Student Organization, the Niger
ian Students Association and the Persian
Association.
