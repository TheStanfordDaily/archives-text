# Lambda Nu renamed Jerry in honor of chef
## 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
Next year, students will no longer have to
venture off campus to immerse themselves in
the Dead House scene. Beginning in fall 2005,
Lambda Nu, a residence overlooking Lake
Lagunita, will officially bear the name "Jerry,"
after Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead.
According to senior C.B. Buente, the res
ident assistant in Lambda Nu, current resi
dents chose to rename the house in honor of
their beloved and long-time chef Sandy
Coulson, an avid Grateful Dead fan. Coul
son is extremely dedicated to the house's res
idents, Buente said.
Coulson told The Daily that she has been
a Grateful Dead enthusiast for more than 25

years — about the same amount of time she
has worked as a chef in Lambda Nu. In fact,
the kitchen walls are decorated with an array
of Grateful Dead paraphernalia, a testament
to her passion for the band.
"When Jerry died in 1995," Coulson said,
"I just didn't know how 1 was going to go on.
But the kids in this house have been amazing
for me. They've helped me through a lot, so
I'm there for them, too."
Coulson said she is thrilled about the de
cision to rename the house Jerry, and added
that the residents' arduous efforts to push
their idea through the administration make
her "feel very loved."
"It's exciting that the University listened
to students," said senior T.G. Falcon,
a resident of Lamda Nu. "We're all
trying to make Stanford a better place
and it's great that the University let us
do so."
Jane Camarillo, director of Resi
dential Education, said that stu
dents wishing to change their resi
dence's name must submit a peti
tion with a list of three to four sug
gestions for names, ranked accord
ing to preference. They must also
give a brief explanation for each
name, and Residential Education
will have the final say.
"We suggested Jerry, The Grate
ful Dorm, Good Lovin' and Broke
down Palace," Falcon said. The latter
two preferences are the names of fa
mous Dead tunes.
Camarillo added that students
must also submit "a proposal that
should invite the involvement of the
whole house, ensuring that everyone
currently living there has a say in
shaping the proposal."
The staff at Lambda Nu had to ob
tain a large enough percentage of sig
natures from the residents to con
vince the administrators to accept the
proposal, Buente said.
"t)ut of 60 residents, 57 signed the
petition," Falcon informed The Daily.
"Our policy was to refrain from asking

people more than once, so that it was
based on their first reaction. The fact
that we got 57 signatures right away
shows that most people in the house
are pretty happy about the decision."
According to Buente, a small num
ber of last year's Lambda Nu residents
originally came up with the idea for the
name change. I"he pitch failed, howev
er. because only about 11 residents of
fered to sign the petition.
Aware of the already-existent
"Dead Houses," houses in Palo Alto
named after Grateful Dead songs
where some upperclassmen reside,
the Lambda Nu staff asked Rob Lev
itsky, owner of the Dead Houses, if he
approved of the idea.
"I think it's great," he said. "1 sup
port it, and it's good because now it
won't sound like the house is a frat
anymore."

t-shirt designs. Falcon said.
Surely, most students living in
Lambda Nu will be happy It) sport the
shirts in appreciation of Coulson.
"People were really passionate
about what this would mean to
Sandy." Buente said.
In addition to feeling honored,
Coulson said she is excited about the
name change because "if there's one
thing I'd like to accomplish, it would
be to have people remember Jerry
all he did, and all of the love that he
stood for."
