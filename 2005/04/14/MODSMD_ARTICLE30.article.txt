Judge Akua Kuenyehia, the first vice
president of the International Criminal
Court, delivered the keynote speech of
Africa Week on the importance ol educat
ing youth in building tomorrow's global
leaders.
Wearing a bright African shawl over a
white tailored suit, Kuenyehia challenged
students to pass up the allure of corner of
fices and large bonuses to take up the cause
of transforming the African continent. She
told the story of her own decision to pass up
a top job at the United Nations to return
home to Ghana and teach at a university.
"You are the privileged few who have

access to education," she said. ' What you
do with your education, when you have all
of the resources, is your decision. Are you
— the leaders of tomorrow — prepared to
take the challenge? Are you prepared to
forgo the fat pay checks and make do with
the meager pay checks?"
Speaking largely to the African interna
tional students in the audience she encour
aged them to return to the continent and
give back the education that Stanford has
provided them. She insisted that sending
money home was not enough — that their
presence and ideas were needed in Africa.
"One of the best things you can do for
your continent is to get the best education
you can here and then go back," she said. "It
is your continent. We need you back home
to inject new ideas, to think strategically, to
begin to make your voices heard so that you
can begin to make a difference."
She insisted that education is the foun
dation of change and emphasized the need
for equal education for both male and fe
male students. As a law professor and the
dean of faculty at the University of Ghana,
Kuenyehia is known for her work on the
major issues confronting women in Africa.

On average, less than 20 percent of univer
sity students on the African continent are
female, she said, which reflects a deep-seat
ed cultural bias.
"If you are going to lead tomorrow you
have to learn how to harness the whole po
tential of Africa — both male and female,"
she said.
She also vocalized the importance of de
veloping a zero-tolerance policy for corrup
tion in Africa and blamed the last genera
tion of African leadership for succumbing
to greed and avarice.
"By promoting and condoning the prac
tice of corruption, the leaders of Africa have
been setting the wrong examples," Kuenye
hia said "They have not always respected the
rule of law. They have not always protected
the basic human rights of their people. Inter
nal conflict is destroying the very fabric of
the communities of Africa."
She concluded by verbally passing the
torch of leadership off to the students sitting
in the audience.
"All of us are transient," she said. "I've
put in my time, done my national service, as
we say in Ghana. Now it's time for you all to
take up the battle."
