# WorkLife Office subsidizes child care
## Faculty and staff can apply to the University for tax-free child-care subsidies during the month of May 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
The University Work Life Office will
accept applications for six-month child
care subsidy grants from May 2 until May
20 for employees hired or employees who
have added child-care-needing depen
dents between Oct. 1. 2004 and May 13,
2005.
Typically, eligible employees may re
ceive up to $5,000 tax-free per full year
from the University, based on calculations
considering family income and the number
of children and their ages.
Among the requirements for eligibility

are that employees must work at least half
time, have an appointment of at least six
months — four months if represented by
the United Stanford Workers union — and
earn an annual adjusted gross family in
come of under $125,(XX).
Families with two or more children may
receive an additional $I,(HK).
Eligible applicants who apply in the May
period for the six-month grant will receive
up to $2.5(M) in prorated grants on July I for
the second half of 2(X)5.
"Employees must enroll on a yearly
basis and we have an annual signup period
during certain dates," said Work Life Office
Director Teresa Rasco.
The child care subsidy program first
began distributing grants in 2001, as the
result of a survey conducted under the
direction of former Provost Condoleez
za Rice.
"Rice had asked the Work Life Office to
survey everybody to see what the needs
were," Rasco said. "As a result of the
Childs Care Needs Assessment, it was rec
ommended that there be some sort of sub
sidy available to help with costs of raising
children for employees."
According to Rasco, feedback for the

program has been overwhelmingly posi
tive. though not everyone who needs it can
get it.
"People who do receive this money feel
very grateful that they're getting a hit of
help, especially if you look at child care
costs in this area." Rasco said, referring to
the Peninsula. "But there are federal regu
lations on the process to begin with. It is to
wards working parents, for example, and
doesn't fit everybody."
Rasco said no labor unions or activist or
ganizations have yet voiced any complaints
over the child care grants. She maintained
that Stanford is continually improving child
care services for its employees.
"We do have a child care working
group that is looking at the child care ser
vices that we have in place to see how we
can reasonably help other issues, so 1 feel
like Stanford is very attentive to this
area," Rasco said.
Applications and information about the
program can be accessed online now at
http://worklife.stanford.edu, and must be
postmarked by the deadline. May 20.
Application materials must be sent by
U.S. mail; fax, II) mail or drop-in applica
tions will not be accepted.
