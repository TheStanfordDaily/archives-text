# Eucalyptus enthusiast prof. writes book on Stanford trees

### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
You will not meet a more passionate de
fender of the Eucalyptus trees on campus
than Electrical Engineering Prof. Ronald
Bracewell. Perhaps it is because they share
so much in common — for instance, they're
both native Australians.

Bracewell, a mathemati
cian, physicist and radio as
tronomer by training.

book, "Trees of

many, including former 1
University President Donald

Kennedy, as the foremost ex- ]
pert.
Maybe, he hopes, it will also con-

vince critics to lay off the genus Eu
calipto.
"Eucalvpto-phobes just want to kill ,

them cause they're aliens," he said. These
"Eucalypto-phobes," according to
Bracewell, fit into the larger family of "Ex
treme Enviros," people who take radical,
uninformed stances on environmental is
sues and who are "bringing into disrepute"
the practice of environmentalism. They be
lieve, for example, that all non-native
species are necessarily bad.
So Bracewell took great pleasure in

learning recently that the Monarch
butterflies, of which the Eucalyp-

to-phobes are fond,
have taken to roost-

ing in the Eucalyp
\ tus groves around

Monterey during
their migration

between Cana
. da and Mexi-
I co. And so

112 people are
often torn.
"People hate

» aliens, but love
butterflies," he

said.
Bracewell and insects go way

back. In his book, he describes collecting
caterpillars from trees as a young boy grow-

Prof, finds inspiration in nature

ing up in Sydney. Australia — an ac
tivity that led to his interest in
botany.
He modestly calls botany a
"hobby," but it is one that has en
gaged his fascination for many
decades.
In 1973 he put together the first
"samizdat" edition of "Trees of
Stanford," which he still keeps on a
shelf in his office. It is a thick, loose
ly-bound collection of typewritten
sheets, filled with heavy marginalia
and the occasional leaf.
Bracewell has also taken an ac
tive role in preserving elements of
the Stanford landscape.
In 1979 he joined a protest to save
six avocado trees. According to one
source, the leader of the revolt
threatened that Bracewell would
chain himself to the first avocado to
be bulldozed.
Herb Fong, manager of Stan
ford's Grounds Services Depart
ment, said he first met Bracewell
more than 30 years ago, when he
directed the removal of some un
attractive shrubs from a median
strip.
The "shrub" turned out to be a
particularly low-growing form of
Eucalyptus, as Fong discovered

when he received a series of ur
gent phone calls from the anxious
professor.
After that, Fong worked closely
with Bracewell and also helped
with the research for his recent
book.
Bracewell reports being con
tinually amazed by the "complex
ity and interconnection" found in
natural life and points to the ex
ample of the oak moth, which
may exist in a symbiotic relation
ship with one particular species of
oak tree.
Students may recognize the oak
moth as the squirming, dangling
caterpillars that hit them in the face
as they bike to class.
Bracewell said he believes that
ordinary people would be better
equipped to deal with environmen
tal problems if they had a better un
derstanding of the intricacies of the
natural world, just outside their
back door.
"People never stop to look at
leaves or bark or flowers," he said.
" They're not observant."
Bracewell, on the other hand, is
very observant. During his interview
with The Daily, he noticed a tiny in
sect on one of his chairs, and he sus

pected that this reporter had
brought it in.
His office is cluttered with the ac
cumulation of years of observation,
including books of botanical water
colors, a mounted sample of the
"biggest leaf on campus" and a wide
collection of Eucalyptus operculum
— the hard cap that protects the
budding flowers.
There are also a few tall Coast
Redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens)
swaying outside his window.
Bracewell said he hopes to use the
redwoods to interest more students
in trees by starting a competition to
find the tallest specimen on campus
using the trigonometric process out
lined in his book.
For his next project. Bracewell is
writing a history of radio astronomy.
He also studies the sun and says he
"still has some solar problems in the
back of his mind."
He said he considers himself for
tunate to work on such a lush cam
pus, where he can watch the trees
bloom year-round. One of his fa
vorites is the Coral Gum. a species of
Eucalyptus that produces full, red
(lowers which, as Bracewell said,
"are good for picking and putting in
your buttonhole."
