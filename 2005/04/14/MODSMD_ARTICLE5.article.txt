# Laborers seek wage increase, promotions
## UC workers go on strike 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A massive one-day strike began this morning at all
nine University of California campuses, unhinging opera
tions and urging some professors to cancel classes in sup
port of service workers — including cashiers, cooks and
bus drivers — who are striking for higher wages, better
training and more opportunities for promotion.
The strike comes after more than eight months of
failed negotiations between UC officials and leaders of
the American Federation of State County, Municipal
Employees local 3329, or AFSCME, the organization that
represents the more than 7,300 workers involved in the
strike.
"They are the lowest paid workers in the system, most
ly immigrants," said AFSCME Spokesperson Faith
Raider in an interview with The Daily. "They haven't had
a raise in two years."
Raider said that the union met with UC officials 27
times, including meetings on April 4 and 5, at which a neu
tral mediator tried to find common ground between the
parties involved.
The workers have the support of many student and
faculty organizations, Raider added. A committee in the
UC's academic council maintained that service worker
salaries should be the top priority in the budgeting
process, above the salaries of the council members them
selves.
"They recognized that people are living from hand-to
mouth," she added.
More than 1,000 workers are striking at UC Berkeley,
which is expected to be one of the campuses most crippled
by the strike, despite the university's efforts to hire tem
porary workers to fill in.
UC Berkeley sophomore Sabina Sadykhova said that
her English professor has canceled today's class.
"Many professors are still holding classes but a lot of
them are not — just to show their support for the strikes,"
said Berkeley junior Beata Shneyer.
Many other classes have been moved off campus for
the day.
