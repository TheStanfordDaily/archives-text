# Stanford Dining amends meal-plan changes to satisfy light eaters, provide more flexibility
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In response to student feedback and
pressure from the ASSU, Stanford Dining
announced to ASSU Senators last week and
confirmed with The Daily this week that it
will make a change to the dining overhaul
that it made public almost two months ago.
Under the plan introduced last quarter,
students would have three all-you-care-to
eat choices, all priced at $4,656 for the entire
year: the "unlimited" 19-meal-per-week
plan, which will not include Cardinal Dol
lars; a 14-meal-per-week plan with 370 Car
dinal Dollars; and a 12-meal-per-week plan
with 585 Cardinal Dollars. The amendment
announced recently — the only one that will
be added before the new dining plan goes
into effect for the 20()5-2(X)6 school year —

replaces the last plan with one that offers 10
meals per week and 750 Cardinal Dollars.
The other two meal plans will not be affect
ed and the prices will remain the same for all
three.
The original reform plan was based on
student feedback concerning the current
dining structure, said Rafi Taherian, execu
tive director of Stanford Dining. But after
the plan was made public, comments and
complaints continued to pour in, both to
dining officials and ASSU Senators.
"I've gotten a lot of e-mails from students
about problems with the plan, especially
asking for more flexibility," said ASSU
President Chioke Borgelt-Mose, a junior.
The student reactions sparked a series of
negotiations between dining officials and
the ASSU.
According to sophomore Russell Husen,

an ASSU senator who serves as the liaison
to Stanford Dining, it was "apparent" that
light-eaters and upperclassman — who
want the most flexibility in their dining
habits — would be most adversely affected
by the changes. It was on their behalf that
the ASSU lobbied most, Husen said.
"The Senate suggested offering a smaller
and less expensive meal plan for light
eaters," said senior Chris Lin, chair of the
ASSU. But Stanford Dining would not
allow the option, mainly because it would
complicate the new meal plan system, which
is advantageous in its simplicity.
Financial feasibility was also a factor in
the negotiations. "Adding more services
without adding price" does not make busi
ness sense for Stanford Dining, Taherian

The Florence Moore Dining Hall will become an all-you-care to eat establishment and accept Cardinal Dollars under the new plan.
