# Leva loving starting spot
## Second-year hurler has come a long way since first relief appearance 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Sophomore righthander Matt Leva
made his first appearance in a Cardinal
uniform more than a year ago, but he still
grimaces a little when he tells the story.
Leva made his collegiate debut
against eventual 2004 College World Se
ries Champion Cal State-Fullerton. With
the Titans up 5-4 in the sixth inning, head
coach Mark Marquess sent Leva to the
bullpen to warm up.
"Being a reliever is tough, especially
the way it works here," Leva said. "Nine
(Marquess) tells you to run down there
and stretch, and 10 seconds later he wants
you all the way."
Former Cardinal pitcher Drew Ehrlich
was sent to the pen to signal Marquess
when Leva was warm. After Leva had
tossed about five pitches, Ehrlich — a vet
eran reliever — asked if he was ready.
"I thought he was joking," Leva said,
conjuring up the horrified look he had
given Ehrlich that day. "1 asked him if he
was serious."
Five pitches later, Ehrlich asked Leva
again if he was ready to take the mound.
Leva twisted his face into an uncertain,
uncomfortable expression and said,
"Sure. I guess."
Leva lasted just 2 / 3 of an inning on
the mound that day, and because of Stan
ford's four-run sixth inning surge, he got
his first career win. But the outing rein
forced what Leva knew all along — he's
a starter through and through.
"1 don't like being rushed," said Leva,
who is now happily a member of the Car
dinal's starting rotation. "1 like to take
my time. I need the mental preparation,
the time to think about what's ahead of

me, or even try not to think about what's
ahead of me."
After a few more middle relief outings
last season, Leva finally got the starting
chance he'd wanted all along. The Cardi
nal's midweek contests picked up in
March, and Leva became a starter.
Leva readily admits that the Tuesday
games aren't as crucial to the team as
conference contests, but the starts gave
him a chance to be himself as a pitcher.
He was able to throw more before step
ping on the mound — he begins warming
up an hour before gametime, which is
more preparation than any other Stan
ford pitcher requires — and it served him
well both mentally and physically. Leva
was 5-2 by the end of the regular season
and worked his way into the weekend
starting rotation for the final three Sun
days of the year.
"[Relief pitching] was kind of tough
for him," said sophomore reliever Jeff
Stimpson, who is also Leva's roommate.
"When you're coming out of the bullpen,
you only get about 10 pitches to deter
mine how well you pitch. And that's not
really his style. He needs a few pitches to
settle down and get his game going. He
has a much better chance to perform well
as a starter."
Still, even in the starting role, Leva
hadn't quite "found his groove," as
Stimpson put it. It took the biggest pres
sure situation possible for Leva to show
his ability.
In last season's Regionals, the Cardi
nal found themselves in an elimination
game against St. John's, faced with a fa
miliar postseason dilemma — the team
had to win the game, but also had to con
serve its pitching staff for later contests.
Leva got the start and to the surprise of
just about everyone, the Houston native
tossed the first complete game of his ca
reer, despite the fact that his previous
season-high was four innings. He gave up
just two runs on seven hits and fanned a
season-high five batters in the Cardinal's
crucial win.

Just as Leva can recreate his tentative
feelings about his early relieving role, the
shy but animated hurler can easily revive
the grin the he donned after becoming
the Cardinal's postseason savior.
"It was just one of those things," Leva
said. "I had all three of my pitches work
ing that game. My arm just never seemed
to get tired."
This season, Leva has once again had
to work in relief to earn the starting spot,
but his Sunday starting role came much
more quickly than last year. In four starts
— two against Pac-10 foes — he is 1-1 on
the season, but with the staff's second
best ERA (3.48) among hurlers with
more than 20 innings pitched.
Stimpson contends that slowly, but
surely, Leva has been building up his
strengths and improving his pitching, es
pecially his ability to locate his best pitch
— his changeup — with more precision.
"Now that he's a starter he's got a cou
ple of innings to settle in and really get
going," Stimpson said. "That's his style."
Leva noted with a wry smile that his
"style" has still resulted in four-inning out
ings. "If you look at my first few starts,
nothing has changed [since last year]," he
said.
But despite the righthander's charac
teristically self-deprecating manner, he
expressed confidence that his stamina
would improve and any mechanical is
sues will be figured out. By the end of
practice on Wednesday, Leva could only
assume that Sunday's starting job against
Arizona State would be his. Despite the
fact that ASU clobbered him last season
and the Sun Devils have the same offen
sive firepower on their 2005 squad. Leva
said he is more than ready for the oppor
tunity — even if he could never have pre
dicted it.
"Coming in here, I knew that Stanford
was one of the best programs in the coun
try, and I never expected to be starting on
Sundays," Leva said. "I've always just
tried to do my own thing and see where it
gets me."

Sophomore Matt Leva has filled in where needed for head coach Mark Marquess during his two sea
sons on the Farm, but he said he feels most comfortable as a starter.
