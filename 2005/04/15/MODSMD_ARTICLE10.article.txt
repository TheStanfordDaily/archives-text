# Feminist decries war on women
## 
### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
Incidents similar to the Sept. 11 ter
rorist attacks are occurring every day in
the United States and around the world,
but few people are doing anything about
it. This was the overarching message
presented by leading feminist Catharine
MacKinnon during a provocative lec
ture yesterday that underscored the par
allels between the ongoingwar on terror
STrid what she sees as a war on women.
"A kind ol war is being fought, but
iSSferie is no name for this war in which
men are the aggressors and women the
victims," she said. MacKinnon, a profes
sor at the University of Michigan Law
School, is one of the most widely cited
legal scholars in the English language.
Just like terrorist attacks, acts of vio
lence against women are carefully
planned, targeted at civilians and driven
by ideology. Gang rape, pornography
and other acts that humiliate and re
press women are methodically orga
nized; the targeted victims are essential
ly all civilians; and the misogynist atti
tude is as ideological as Islamic funda
mentalism, MacKinnon contended.
"The number of people who died at

[the terrorists'] hands is the same as the
number of women who die at men's
hands-every year," she said. "9/11 hap
pens in this very country every year."
More importantly, MacKinnon ar
gued, public responses to the two types of
war differ radically. Wars and disputes
among nation-states have generated in
ternational discussions and conventions.
But men's war against women has not
even brought about an ad-hoc tribunal.
"Aggression against women isn't
fcalled The violation of peace, us aggres
sion against nation-states is'
said. "There's no Geneva Convention
for this war, and the domestic criminal
laws are so under-enforced that they can
be considered not there."
MacKinnon also challenged the audi
ence to reflect on the parallels between
the military conflict in Iraq and the hos
tilities between the sexes.
"The major rationale for the war in
Iraq is the preemption of threats posed
by Saddam Hussein's regime — be
cause we're scared of you, we can kill
you," she said. "Imagine what it would
be like if women did the same to men
one day."
MacKinnon acknowledged that her
speech was intended to provoke

thought, debate and a
fresh way of viewing
women's subordina
tion. She stressed,
however, that the war
on women is by no
means a metaphor.

"International law
today doesn't capture the reality that
half of society is attacking the other
half," she said. "This is a real war that
has gone on for millennia." ,
An audience meinbei expressed eon-

session that MacKinnon's ideas are too
tonfrontational to effectively bridge the
divide between the two sexes. But
MacKinnon assured that shedding light
on the violence perpetrated against
women is necessary to make gender
equality possible.
"If we're worried that we'll be
knocked down as soon as we stand up,
then we'll always be crawling on the
floor," she responded.
The outspoken MacKinnon, who
taught at Stanford's Law School in the
1980s, has proven to be as much a light
ning rod as she is a magnet of admirers.


Catharine MacKinnon
MacKinnon argues men victimize women

She has long championed the prohibition of
pornography, asserting that producing and
viewing pornography degrade women and
should be considered a violation of their civil
rights.
In introducing MacKinnon, former Law
School Dean Kathleen Sullivan applauded
MacKinnon's scholarly contribution to the
women's liberation movement. Sullivan referred
to the French feminist Siinone de Beuuvpir —
whose book "The Second Sex" offered ground
breaking critique of the social structure that op
pressed women — in describing MacKinnon's

influence on the contemporary study of femi
nism.
"There are many other prominent feminist
theorists in our times, but none of their philoso
phy is as sweeping and profound as MacKin
non's," Sullivan said.
Carol Li, a second-year law student who had
studied under MacKinnon at the University of
Chicago where MacKinnon served as a visiting
prafossQL praised her as an iconic figure in femi
nist legal theory.
"Her speech was very loaded and thought
provoking," Li said following the lecture, which

was sponsored by the Women of Stanford Law, a
student group, and the Institute for Research on
Women and Gender. "MacKinnon doesn't at
tack things just on the surface; she goes incisive
ly into the culture and politics. I think she offers
a powerful voice to the women who've been sub
ordinated in society."
MacKinnon, 58, received her bachelor's de
gree from Smith College and her law degree
from Yale Law School. She also holds a doctor
ate in political science from Yale University. She
is holding a book-signing event today in room
180 of the Law School at 12:30 p.m.
