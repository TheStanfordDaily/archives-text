# Study raises questions about Teach for America
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For some seniors, an appealing way
to "save the world" right out of college
has been through Teach for America,
an organization that trains and places
young people, many of whom are re
cent college graduates, to teach low-in
come students.
But a controversial study released
today by the School of Education sug
gests that uncertified teachers — in
cluding those recruited through Teach
for America — may be doing more
harm than good. Some educators, how
ever, question the methods used in the
study, and Teach for America repre
sentatives say that other studies have
shown contradictory results.
The study linked the achievement
data of more than 130,000 fourth and
fifth graders to the certification status
of more than 4,(XK) teachers in Hous
ton. Texas. The students took six differ
ent reading and mathematics tests over
a six year period, and those taught by
certified teachers consistently out-per
formed the students of uncertified
teachers.
"A lot of questions have been raised
as to whether bright college students
can be effective when thrown into a
classroom setting and asked to teach,"
said Linda Darling-Hammond, the
School of Education professor who
conducted the study with three of her
colleagues. The bottom line of their
findings is that "certified teachers al
ways out performed uncertified teach
ers," she added.
While the typical Teach for Ameri
ca participant has a strong background
in their field, is eager to help the kids ad
vance and receives training the sum
mer prior to the start of his or her first
school-year, Darling-Hammond said
this is not enough.
"They didn't know what kids are

supposed to learn in third grade," she
said. "They don't know how to put a
curriculum together. They didn't know
how to assess the student's achieve
ment."
This often frustrates the young in
structors and can make them resort to
stricter teaching strategies, simply be
cause they do not know what the alter
natives are for creating a curriculum
that is exciting and engaging, Darling-
Hammond said.
"It is common for these teachers to
create a setting in which the kids are
under very, very tight control," she
added.
Special education students and non
native English speakers had the lowest
academic growth rates when taught by
under-qualified teachers.
Assessing the Costs
Besides having a negative effect on
the academic achievement of their stu
dents. Darling-Hammond said Teach
for America recruits tend to leave only
two to three years after they are hired.
The cost of replacing them ranges from
$8,000 to $48,000.
"This raises the question of whether
the money spent on replacing teachers
quickly wouldn't be better spent re
cruiting better teachers," Darling-
Hammond said.
Largely due to a shortage of funds,
many California school districts avoid
hiring large numbers of qualified appli
cants because they must be paid signif
icantly more than their younger, less
qualified counterparts.
"What they seem not to have fac
tored in is the turnover cost," Darling-
Hammond added.
These problems vary depending on
the policies of individual school dis
tricts, and some have made significant
strides toward putting a certified teach
er in every classroom, she said.
