# Study raises questions about Teach for America
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For some seniors, an appealing way
to "save the world" right out of college
has been through Teach for America,
an organization that trains and places
young people, many of whom are re
cent college graduates, to teach low-in
come students.
But a controversial study released
today by the School of Education sug
gests that uncertified teachers — in
cluding those recruited through Teach
for America — may be doing more
harm than good. Some educators, how
ever, question the methods used in the
study, and Teach for America repre
sentatives say that other studies have
shown contradictory results.
The study linked the achievement
data of more than 130,000 fourth and
fifth graders to the certification status
of more than 4,(XK) teachers in Hous
ton. Texas. The students took six differ
ent reading and mathematics tests over
a six year period, and those taught by
certified teachers consistently out-per
formed the students of uncertified
teachers.
"A lot of questions have been raised
as to whether bright college students
can be effective when thrown into a
classroom setting and asked to teach,"
said Linda Darling-Hammond, the
School of Education professor who
conducted the study with three of her
colleagues. The bottom line of their
findings is that "certified teachers al
ways out performed uncertified teach
ers," she added.
While the typical Teach for Ameri
ca participant has a strong background
in their field, is eager to help the kids ad
vance and receives training the sum
mer prior to the start of his or her first
school-year, Darling-Hammond said
this is not enough.
"They didn't know what kids are

supposed to learn in third grade," she
said. "They don't know how to put a
curriculum together. They didn't know
how to assess the student's achieve
ment."
This often frustrates the young in
structors and can make them resort to
stricter teaching strategies, simply be
cause they do not know what the alter
natives are for creating a curriculum
that is exciting and engaging, Darling-
Hammond said.
"It is common for these teachers to
create a setting in which the kids are
under very, very tight control," she
added.
Special education students and non
native English speakers had the lowest
academic growth rates when taught by
under-qualified teachers.
Assessing the Costs
Besides having a negative effect on
the academic achievement of their stu
dents. Darling-Hammond said Teach
for America recruits tend to leave only
two to three years after they are hired.
The cost of replacing them ranges from
$8,000 to $48,000.
"This raises the question of whether
the money spent on replacing teachers
quickly wouldn't be better spent re
cruiting better teachers," Darling-
Hammond said.
Largely due to a shortage of funds,
many California school districts avoid
hiring large numbers of qualified appli
cants because they must be paid signif
icantly more than their younger, less
qualified counterparts.
"What they seem not to have fac
tored in is the turnover cost," Darling-
Hammond added.
These problems vary depending on
the policies of individual school dis
tricts, and some have made significant
strides toward putting a certified teach
er in every classroom, she said.
One recent success story took place
in San Diego, where school districts
have hired approximately I,(XX) certi
fied teachers and raised salaries to keep
them there. The result, Darling-Ham
mond said, has been higher test scores
overall.
Likewise, in New York City, half of
all teachers lacked credentials. But
when the city raised salaries by 20 per
cent, the amount of certified teachers
rose to 9(1 percent within a year —
demonstrating that the turnaround can
happen very quickly, Darling-Ham
mond said.
But according to Abigail Smith, vice
president of research and public policy at
Teach for America, the teachers recruit
ed right out of college receive proper
training before they face their students.

Besides reading curriculum text
books, these teachers must complete a
five-week "intensive" training pro
gram and must shadow a veteran teach
er to get a feel for the classroom setting.
Smith explained.
In districts such as Houston, all
Teach for America recruits must enroll
in a certification program while they
are actively teaching. The program re
quires them to take weekend or
evening classes for their first two years
on the job.
However, Darling-Hammond said
that these teachers tend leave almost as
soon as they become certified, a trend
which exacerbates the problem of
turnover costs.
Flawed Methodology?
Susanna Loeb, assistant professor at
the School of Education, questioned
the methods Darling-Hammond used
in interpreting the data.
"While the research raises some im
portant questions. 1 would want to see

some more detail," Loeb said. "There
aren't too many analyses in the paper
so far, and often you need to look at the
study in multiple ways to make the re
sults more robust."
Smith, of Teach for America, also at
tacked the rigor of Darling-Hammond's
methods, and said that Darling-Ham
mond has an "inexplicable, 12-year
vendetta against Teach for America."
Although Smith said Teach for Amer
ica teachers are Ux)king to get better at
working with students who are learning
English, she said that certification alone
does not guarantee a good teacher.
"Certification status per se is not my
concern," Smith said. "My concern is
whether teachers are having a positive
impact on their kids. There are lots of
factors that go into that."
As an alternative to Darling-Ham
mond's research, both Smith and Loeb
suggested an alternative study put out
last summer by the Mathematica Policy
Research, Inc., an independent policy
research firm.

The study — titled "The Effects of
Teach For America on Students: Find
ings from a National Evaluation" —
compared Teach for America instruc
tors with other inexperienced and often
uncertified teachers, and concluded
that "Teach for America teachers had
larger impacts on both math and read
ing achievement when compared with
novice control teachers."
Loeb added that Darling-Hammond's
comparison between Teach for America
recruits and older, certified and more ex
perienced teachers may not have been fair.
Darling-Hammond is slated to pre
sent her study today at the annual
meeting of the American Educational
Research Association in Montreal,
where Loeb predicts it will face criti
cism from experts in the field.
"We are eager to see the peer re
view process for this study," Smith said,
it other researchers give positive re
views in terms of the methodology of
this study, then we are extremely open
to it."
