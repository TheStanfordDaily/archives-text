### JESSICA ZHANG STAFF WRITER 
In the keynote speech for the
week-long conference sponsored by
the Forum for American / Chinese
Exchange at Stanford, or FACES,
James Lilley, former U.S. ambas
sador to the People's Republic of
China and South Korea, discussed
past and present Chinese politics,
including the need for the U.S. gov
ernment to work with the Chinese
government in talks with North
Korea. He also defended the Amer
ican sale of arms to Taiwan over the
past several decades.
He called on personal experi
ence to construct a brief, yet histor
ical history of China before delving
into the more hard-hitting issues.
When his family first settled in
China, Lilley said the nation had
only just begun recovering from
both the Opium War with Great
Britain and the Boxer Rebellion,
two events that left a very China
with a very negative impression of
the Western world.
"Westerners existed in a privi
leged oasis in a sea of suffering in
China," he said. "From the Chi
nese point of view, it was a period
of humiliation and victimization.

and how foreigners exercised their
will on China has resonance
today."
Using this history to explain
China's current political system, Lil
ley argued that the chaos and con
stant violence that existed in China
before World War II prompted the
need fora strong central govern
ment.
It took visionaries like President
Richard Nixon and Henry
Kissinger, his secretary of state, to
change the nature of U.S.-China re
lations — to dispel distrust and en
courage collaboration, Lilley said.
"Nevertheless, the American-
Chinese relationship has a cyclical
nature, with ups and downs," he
added.
Shifting his attention to Taiwan
and North Korea, Lilley warned the
audience to be skeptical of buz
zwords used by the media.
"There is preoccupation with the
most dangerous concepts in history
right now — self-determination,
forced unity, premature indepen
dence and exercise of sovereignty,"
he said. "You heard these buz
zwords in pre-ward Europe."
Justifying the U.S. sale of arms to
the Taiwanese government, Lilley
said, "You work in Taiwan to give
them a sense of confidence so that
they go and deal with China. We
provided the material and spiritual
support they needed."
He stressed the importance of
maintaining open communication
along the Taiwan Strait.
"Because of American policy,
there emerged a more civilized dis
course out of China because Ameri
can presidents would not tolerate
unilateral changing of the status quo
in Taiwan," he said. "There is reason
to be more optimistic."
The situation in North Korea, Lil
ley said, is much uglier. He referred
to the nation as a failed economic
state based on Stalinist totalitarian
ism, and even compared it to 1935
Nuremberg, Germany. He added
that North Korea currently spends
30 percent of its GDP on the military
while 2 million of its citizens are
starving.
"We have to work with our part
ners. and China is critical in this —
but their interests are different," he
said, explaining that China does not
want North Korea to collapse for
fear that an American-backed, uni

fied Korea could emerge. Ultimate
ly, China wants the nation to be sus
tained.
"This is not an American prob
lem," Lilley said, referring to North
Korea. "It is a Chinese, South Kore
an and Japanese problem, and if the
Chinese want to support them, we
have to allow that."
Following his talk, Lilley fielded
questions from the audience relat
ed to economic development and
interdependence. In response, he
warned against the Western notion
that democracy must accompany
capitalism.
"Political liberty accompanying a
market economy is a Western impo
sition," he said. "Watch your step
when you begin to bring premature
democracy in Rwanda or to the
Congo. Certain cultures are closer
to western values, but in other coun
tries with different systems, you
have to be very careful."
Many audience members, includ
ing FACES delegates, who attended
the speech said they enjoyed Lilley's
presentation.
"I thought the breadth and depth
of his understanding was extensive
and that he had a lot to offer to this
type of audience and this type of
conferences," said FACES delegate
Kaitlin Solimine, a first-year gradu
ate student at the University of
Southern California. "He provided
a unique and invaluable perspective

unavailable to someone of our age
group because he has a long-stand
ing history with U.S.-China rela
tions."
Emily So, a senior at the Univer
sity of Hong Kong, echoed Solim
ine's comments.
"I'm particularly impressed with
him saying that capitalism works
best, but that you have to watch out
for human rights and democracy,"
she said. "This stance is rarely seen

in U.S. diplomatic relations."
During his four-decade career in
government, Lilley also worked in
the Central Intelligence Agency, the
White House, the State Department
and the Department of Defense. He
also served as director of the Ameri
can Institute in Taiwan, a nonprofit
private corporation that oversees all
programs and transactions conduct
ed by the U.S. government in respect
to Taiwan.
