### JESSICA ZHANG STAFF WRITER 
In the keynote speech for the
week-long conference sponsored by
the Forum for American / Chinese
Exchange at Stanford, or FACES,
James Lilley, former U.S. ambas
sador to the People's Republic of
China and South Korea, discussed
past and present Chinese politics,
including the need for the U.S. gov
ernment to work with the Chinese
government in talks with North
Korea. He also defended the Amer
ican sale of arms to Taiwan over the
past several decades.
He called on personal experi
ence to construct a brief, yet histor
ical history of China before delving
into the more hard-hitting issues.
When his family first settled in
China, Lilley said the nation had
only just begun recovering from
both the Opium War with Great
Britain and the Boxer Rebellion,
two events that left a very China
with a very negative impression of
the Western world.
"Westerners existed in a privi
leged oasis in a sea of suffering in
China," he said. "From the Chi
nese point of view, it was a period
of humiliation and victimization.

and how foreigners exercised their
will on China has resonance
today."
Using this history to explain
China's current political system, Lil
ley argued that the chaos and con

It took visionaries like President
Richard Nixon and Henry
Kissinger, his secretary of state, to
change the nature of U.S.-China re
lations — to dispel distrust and en
courage collaboration, Lilley said.
"Nevertheless, the American-
Chinese relationship has a cyclical
nature, with ups and downs," he
added.
Shifting his attention to Taiwan
and North Korea, Lilley warned the
audience to be skeptical of buz
zwords used by the media.
"There is preoccupation with the
most dangerous concepts in history
right now — self-determination,
forced unity, premature indepen
dence and exercise of sovereignty,"
he said. "You heard these buz
zwords in pre-ward Europe."
