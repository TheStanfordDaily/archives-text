## Police on lookout for DUIs 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Drunk driving is never a good idea, but doing it
this weekend is particularly ill-advised.
On Saturday night, police will be running sev
eral sobriety checkpoints on campus and issuing
driving-under-the-influence citations to intoxicat
i eii duvets. U will-be the-first-such efiaeUn at least

The Stanford £epwtment of Public Safety, or
SDPS, is currently setting up#ie checkpoints, bring
ing in officers from the Los Altos and Palo Alto po
lice departments to aid in the effort. The SDPS re
fused to disclose the location of the checkpoints be
fore they open on Saturday at 9 p.m.
However, the number of arrests will likely be
lower than it might be on other weekends because
there are few all-campus parties planned and because
many fraternities will be away on post-rush retreats.
SDPS Deputy Ken Bates said the checkpoints
were not prompted by any increase in the number
of DUI arrests and are simply part of an effort to
increase awareness about the dangers of drunk
driving.
Bates, who has worked at Stanford for 15

years, said that he could not recall the last time the
department had used on-campus checkpoints. In
fact, before the idea was proposed, officers had to
research the correct procedure for setting up such
checkpoints.
The legal blood alcohol content fora 21-year
old driver in California is 0.08. The police have re
ported 22 DUI arrests on campus so far this year,
and two arrests were made under
&rQ tolerance" law, which mates it illegaiiar un
derage drivers to have any alcohol in then system.
Anyone driving oh Stanford's campus this Sat
urday night is liable to be stopped. Officers will ran
domly check motorists, including those in golf carts.
"You can be arrested in a Hummer or you can
be arrested in an EZ Cart and suffer the same con
sequences," Bates said.
These consequences include fines, suspension
of driving privileges, towing charges, a night in jail
and — for most people — higher insurance rates.
Though bikers will not be specifically targeted,
students should be wary about hopping on their
Schwinns after a few Coronas.
"If we see bikes crashing or falling, of course
we're going to find out what's going on," said Stan
ford Deputy Eric Fenton.
