### SAM FLOAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The annual week-long Cesar Chavez commem
orative celebration will conclude today at 7 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The focus of this year's
celebration is the spirituality and nonviolent social
transformation that Chavez represented during his
lifetime.
Over the past week, speakers and workshops
have addressed topics ranging from the history of
Filipinos and Mexicans in the United Farm Works
union to current problems within the ethnic com
munity, including agricultural pesticide use and
contemporary labor issues.
The event, hosted by Stanford's El Centro Chi
cano and the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de
Aztlan, or MEChA, is a tribute to Chavez's impor
tant role in securing rights for farm workers.
Monsignor Eugene Boyle will deliver tonight's
keynote address on how faith and spirituality can
complement nonviolent activism. Boyle, who
knew Chavez personally, is a retired priest of the
Diocese of San Jose and chair emeritus of the In
terfaith Council on Religion. Race, Economic and

Social Justice of Santa Clara County.
Actor Pablo Rodriguez will perform his one
man show "Pendejo Heaven," which demonstrates
the challenges he has faced as an artist and com
munity leader and how theater can be used as a
form of peaceful protest.
Stanford's Mariachi Cardenal and Ballet Folk
lorico will also perform on stage, and freshmen
Nydia Cardenas and Nancy Mata will deliver
speeches on a course they took related to the
event's main themes of faith and activism.
The results of the Cesar Chavez Art and Essay
Contest — a MEChA-sponsored contest that
awards cash prizes to Bay Area elementary, middle
and high school students — will also be an
nounced. The winners will then have the opportu
nity to share their work with the audience.
Freshman Rebecca Perez won the contest in
1999 as a seventh-grader for an essay about how
Cesar Chavez's struggles have personally im
pacted her life since her father is an agricultural
worker.
"Without the contest, perhaps I would never
have had the option or dream to come [to Stan
ford]," Perez said. "If this contest has made this im

pact on me, it is likely to have that impact on other
students."
Senior Maria Medina, who has been in charge of
designing posters and marketing for the event, said
she has been involved in planning the celebration
since January.
More than 300 people are expected to turn out
for tonight's event, which will have a large impact
on the Stanford community as a whole, Medina
said.
"It is important to make people aware of histor
ical figures and our cultural practices and beliefs,"
Medina added. "This brings a lot of groups togeth
er because anyone can volunteer if they are inter
ested and everyone comes together to work."
The final event, the "Corridos Pa'l Cesar"
dance party, will be held after the Dinkelspiel pro
gram at 10 p.m. in Casa Zapata. All events are free
and open to the public.
Cardenas stressed the importance of celebrat
ing Chavez's legacy each year.
"Cesar Chavez represents the possibilities of
what nonviolent activism can do to change unjust
conditions, but there is a lot still left to be done,"
she said.
