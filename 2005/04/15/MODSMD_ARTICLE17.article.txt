In the article "New members join
CiSC" published yesterday. The
Daily inaccurately referred to the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate as the
ASSU. The ASSU governs both un
dergraduate and graduate students.

It also stated that Elections Com
missioner Troy Steinmetz intro
duced an ASSU-GSC hill at this
week's Graduate Student Council
Meeting. Rather the bill was a Sen
ate-GSC bill. Also, the article re
ported that only 5 percent of gradu
ate students voted in last week's

election, when the figure should be
approximately 20 percent.

In the article, "Univ. takes over
EPA charter school" published
April 11, The Daily neglected to
credit reporter Zubin Agarwal, who
provided additional information.
