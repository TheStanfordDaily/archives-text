# Pop Culture Exposed
## Asthmatics are people, too 
### 
In between publicizing major world
changing events such as the Pope's
death and Britney Spears' pregnancy,
the media have long been responsible for
perpetuating numerous discriminatory
stereotypes—Muslims as terrorists,
blacks as either rappers or gangsters (or
both), Michael Jackson as a scary, de
formed child molester.
But the one 1 found to be most unwar
ranted, spiteful and just plain mean was
about the people with whom I most iden
tify with: the asthmatics.
The media would have you believe
that all asthmatics are geeks who wear
suspenders and pocket protectors, or
nerds with weak lungs and easily collapsi
ble bronchial tubes (that part actually is
true — minus the nerds bit) or poor
dressers in constant need of corrective
lenses.
In "Gilmore Girls," for example, a

member of Lane's
rock band who, in
comedic contrast
to his band mates,
suffers from per
petual nasal con
gestion, wheezing
and nerdish bab
ble.
And the nerds
at "Saved by the
Bell's" Bayside
High, along with
most of Screech's
friends, often had
some respiratory

problem, if not asthma itself. This offered
the other characters multiple opportuni
ties to make jokes about inhalers and
asthma. Hilarious comedy ensued.
This is absolutely appalling.
The portrayal of asthmatics in the cur
rent media (and by "current," I would in
clude the 80s) is not only untrue but also
simply unnecessary.
Some of the coolest people I knew in
high school had asthma. They didn't wear
glasses. They didn't have pocket protec
tors. They were cool even when they
couldn't breathe sometimes. That's what
I call genuine popularity.
And asthmatics do not always wear
corrective lenses or dress poorly, with
tucked in shirts or suspenders. In fact, 1
think that asthma patients have some of
the best fashion sense in the country.
These gross stereotypes stem from a
popular misconception about asthma as
the "geekiest" of diseases. On the hierar
chical scale of illnesses — from the com
mon cold to cancer — asthma probably
ranks somewhere between allergies and
diabetes. I personally think our inability
to breathe at moments would push us
past the diabetics, who only suffer from
minor setbacks such as high blood pres
sure and the risk of death, but that's just
me.
Yet for some reason, people do not
take asthma as seriously as they do other
conditions.
You don't make fun of the disabled
kid in the wheelchair for having no legs.
Or maybe you do, you sick, sick bastard.
But you don't mock Siamese twin babies
for being conjoined at the head. So why
make fun of a kid when his bronchial tube
collapses? Where is the love?
Not to mention how some people
think asthma is just "all in your head."
1 remember once, when 1 was starting
to have an asthma attack in school, my
teacher said something like, "Just imag
ine a beautiful rainbow. See yourself
breathing in all the beautiful rainbow col
ors. See your bronchial tubes and lungs
opening and filling with soothing rain
bow light."
I did not imagine the rainbow. I did
not breathe in the rainbow light. It was
somewhat difficult for me, considering
how, at the time, I'd pretty much stopped
breathing all together.
The time has come for asthmatics to
be taken seriously. We are a sensitive
people whose struggles with air and
bronchial tubes may not have strength
ened our lungs, but have certainly
strengthened our character and resolve.
We are survivors of a serious disease, one
that is complicated and nuanced. It cer
tainly requires somewhat more complex
and effective solution than "rainbow
light."
I recommend we start an asthmatics
society on campus and join the campaign
for student fees. Or at least start a club on
Thefacebook.com, where we could
gauge our numbers and send important
reminders to take your inhaler today.
And poke each other. But not to the
point where we can't breathe anymore.
So to all you asthmatics out there,
break out that inhaler in style — Advair,
Proventil, whatever your weapon of
choice — and unite.

Shivani is down to her last inhaler. If you
have a prescription for Advair, please con
