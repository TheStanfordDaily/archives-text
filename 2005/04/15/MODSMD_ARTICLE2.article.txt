# Cardinal host No. 1 UCLA
## 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Tough as nails" — that's the defensive
standard to which the members of the No. 3
women's water polo team (14-4,7-2 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) hold themselves
every time they jump in the pool. One glance
at a season stat sheet and you can clearly see
that they have succeeded in that effort.
In 18 games thus far, the Cardinal have
surrendered only 72 goals to their opposi
tion. That works out to an even 4.00 goals
against average — the lowest in the nation.
Top-ranked UCLA holds the next best
mark of just over five goals per game.
The Cardinal's strong defense has been
one of the greatest factors in the squad's suc
cess this season. Solid defensive play pays div
idends in more ways than one, especially fora

team possessing as much speed as the Cardi
nal. In addition to breaking an opponent's
momentum, a well-timed steal creates scoring
opportunities on the counterattack — oppor
tunities that the Cardinal have taken advan
tage of frequently this season.
"Stanford water polo has always taken
pride in its great defensive play, and our
team this year continues that tradition,"
sophomore goalie Meridith McColl said.
"Good defense is the first step in our of
fense, so the two are directly related."
And while the Cardinal always approach
defense as a collective team undertaking, a
core of five players stands out as the back
bone of the team's defensive efforts — Mc-
Coll, sophomore Alison Gregorka, juniors
Laurel Champion and Val Riss and senior
Kelty Luber.
