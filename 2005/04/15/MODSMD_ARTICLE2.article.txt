# Cardinal host No. 1 UCLA
## 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Tough as nails" — that's the defensive
standard to which the members of the No. 3
women's water polo team (14-4,7-2 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) hold themselves
every time they jump in the pool. One glance
at a season stat sheet and you can clearly see
that they have succeeded in that effort.
In 18 games thus far, the Cardinal have
surrendered only 72 goals to their opposi
tion. That works out to an even 4.00 goals
against average — the lowest in the nation.
Top-ranked UCLA holds the next best
mark of just over five goals per game.
The Cardinal's strong defense has been
one of the greatest factors in the squad's suc
cess this season. Solid defensive play pays div
idends in more ways than one, especially fora

team possessing as much speed as the Cardi
nal. In addition to breaking an opponent's
momentum, a well-timed steal creates scoring
opportunities on the counterattack — oppor
tunities that the Cardinal have taken advan
tage of frequently this season.
"Stanford water polo has always taken
pride in its great defensive play, and our
team this year continues that tradition,"
sophomore goalie Meridith McColl said.
"Good defense is the first step in our of
fense, so the two are directly related."
And while the Cardinal always approach
defense as a collective team undertaking, a
core of five players stands out as the back
bone of the team's defensive efforts — Mc-
Coll, sophomore Alison Gregorka, juniors
Laurel Champion and Val Riss and senior
Kelty Luber.

Freshman driver Megan Nesland and the No. 3 Stanford women's water polo team will face
the top-ranked and undefeated Bruins today at 7 p.m. at Avery Aquatic Center.
Anchoring the Cardinal's defense
is McColl, who, alter a successful
freshman campaign last season, has
continued to make great strides in de
veloping as a goalkeeper.
"She has really improved as a shot
blocker, passer and defensive leader,"
head coach John Tanner said. "A
goalie solid in all three of those as
pects is going to get a lot of good re
sults."
McColl has produced a number of
highlights this season, making spec
tacular saves on both shots from the
field and four-meter penalty shots.
She posted seven saves in a 6-5 over
time loss to No. 2 Southern California,
holding the Women of Troy to their
lowest regulation goal total of the sea
son.
McColl's increased willingness and
ability to direct coverage assignments
in the defensive zone has made her
even more valuable to the Cardinal.
Over the course of the season. McColl
and Stanford's defensive position
players have worked on honing their
communication between one anoth
er. Now it is not uncommon to see Mc-

Coll come out of the net to makes
plays, acting effectively as a seventh
field player.
"I think that as a team we've all
gotten more coordinated defensively
through good communication togeth
er and sharp anticipation skills on the
perimeter," Luber said.
The Cardinal's field defense takes
advantage of its players' wide range of
capabilities. Gregorka and Champion
have the difficult task of "fronting" —
maintaining a position that prevents
the opposition's two-meter player at
set from receiving a pass inside. 11 is an
assignment requiring both strength
and finesse, but one that both players
perform admirably.
"Alison and Laurel are simply
amazing defenders," McColl said. "In
addition to their athleticism, they play
with an agility and grace that really
sets them apart from many other two
meter defenders. They can complete
ly shut down some of the most effec
tive hole-sets in the country."
Riss and Luber help minimize the
goal totals of opposing teams as the
Cardinal's top shot blockers in the
field.
"A lot of it comes down to shot
blocking and shrinking the cage in the
eyes of the shooter," Tanner said.
Additionally, both display a tena
cious and smart style of play that en

ables them to perform a variety of
coverages. Luber's size and quickness
give her the versatility to cut off pass
openings, but also to guard against op
posing players driving toward the
two-meter mark. Riss contributes a
powerful presence off the bench that
Tanner can effectively use to wear
down opposing players.
"Val is tremendously tough at two
meter defense, grinding on her mark
and going all out until she gets the
ball." Luber said.
In a way, the commitment of these
five players to making themselves
"tough as nails" is ironically fitting.
Nails are relied upon to fulfill the es
sential function of holding everything
together, and yet in the framework of
an entire project they are almost al
ways overlooked. The same can be
said for defensive specialists in an of
fense-driven game like water polo.
But no matter how unnoticed or un
publicized Stanford's defensive ef
forts may go, they will be depended
upon greatly as the Cardinal enter
their end-of-the-year tournaments
and look to regain the NCAA title.
These five members of the Cardi
nal will play particularly important
roles this weekend as Stanford plays
host to undefeated UCLA tomorrow
at 7 p.m. and No. 14 UC-Davis Sun
day at 1 p. m.
