# Handing your paper into your mother
## 
### LIZ ROMERO STAFF WRITER 
From afar, they look and act like any other student on
campus. They join fraternities and sororities, travel abroad
and work — and party — hard.
But when these students go home, they go home to the
professors who teach your classes and grade your exams.
Faculty brats — that's what they call themselves on The
facebook.com.
Nathan Kurz is one. A junior and history major, Kurz is
the son of Mordecai Kurz, a economics professor, and his
mother received her Ph.D. in political science at Stanford.
Other faculty brats include John McGee, a freshman
whose mother Sharon Long is a professor of biological sci
ences; JJ Ross, a junior majoring in psychology whose father,
Brian Ross, is a visiting professor of cognitive psychology
from University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign; and Krysia
Rose Zajonc, a sophomore film studies major whose parents
are social psychology professors Robert Zajonc and Hazel
Rose Markus.
These high-profile students face many issues — privacy,
heightened academic expectations from peers and faculty,
and the touchy question of whether they were admitted be
cause of their parents.
For many, choosing the right college meant getting as far
away from parents as possible in a quest for self-discovery,
freedom and privacy. However, as a general trend, these stu
dents said that their parents had no effect on their decision to
come to Stanford, even if it meant taking the risk of bumping
into them on campus once in a while.
Most children of faculty said they typically saw their par
ents once or twice a week. Yet some students were more ex
treme in the amount of time they spent with their parents.
"Just to show how physically large this campus is, I've
only run into him once around Stanford," said Kurz about his
father.
McGee concurred. "It really isn't a big deal, you will
rarely see them." he said.
Zajonc, however, said that she sees her parents "pretty
much every day."
Students seemed to have a fair amount of control over
their exposure to their parents.
A senior, who wished to remain anonymous to protect her
family?s privacy, explained: "My freshmen year, I made it a
point to only go home over vacations, when everyone else
went home too. But, now, as a senior, I like being able to see
my parents more often than once every three months."
When asked what they would do if parents tried to ac
cess their thefacebook.com profile given that faculty are
allowed to open accounts on the Web site, Zajonc said,
"My mom actually was thinking about using profiles on
Thefacebook.com to gather data about Stanford students.
I immediately asked her if she had seen mine. She told me
she tries to stay out of that realm of my life. Yeah right.

mom. You read it. And yes, those are
forties duck-taped to our hands. "
These students mentioned that their
peers often had heightened expecta
tions of their academic abilities, partic
ularly in the area where their parents
were professors.
"When I took Econ 1 last year, I cer
tainly felt a little pressure. 1 think 1
struggled with some of the concepts at
the beginning, and everyone looked at
me kind of funny," Kurz said. "They
were like, ?shouldn't this stuff be in
your blood or something?? By the end,
I had a pretty good mastery of the basic
concepts, and I like some of the ways of
thinking in economics, but it just didn't
interest me enough to warrant further
courses."
This was good for Kurz because, as
he jokingly added, "My dad said he'd
kick me out of class if I ever showed
up."
Prof. Kurz, however, said that he
was happy to have his son at Stanford
"since it is such a fine school."
The question of expectations can be
a more sensitive issue when the student
chooses to major in his or her parents?
professed area of concentration. Ross
is currently majoring in psychology,
the field in which her father is a profes
sor.
"If my parent taught a class I'd
probably take it. since it would be one
I'd want to take anyway," Ross said.
Ross admitted that it was added
pressure being the daughter of some
one on faculty, but the status did have
its perks.
"It's really great. Because he knows
so much about what it's like to go into
the field, he's a huge help," she said.
And the million dollar question: How

did you get in?
Kurz said that although the question bothered him at first,
he feels that after three years on campus he has risen above
the issue.
"I think when I first got here, I felt like it was a curse.
I was always proud of my dad and his accomplishments,
so I never gave it a second thought when I told people he
was a professor here," Kurz said. "My parents are a big
part of my identity, there's no way around it. But I think
some people assume that the only reason I got into Stan
ford was because of his presence as a tenured faculty

member. If people still think that way now, it doesn't
bother me, because I feel like I've carved my own path
here."
Zajonc said she has had a very positive experience at
Stanford and is glad she has had the opportunity to study
where her parents teach.
"It is definitely a gift," said Zajonc. "It gave me an oppor
tunity to be exposed to my parents' passions and ideas ... a
chance that few kids seem to have. When friends of mine who
have taken my parents' classes have good things to say, 1 am
forced to reevaluate my own childish thoughts about my par
ents. I am extremely proud of them."

"If my parent taught a class I'd
probably take it. since it would be one
I'd want to take anyway," Ross said.
Ross admitted that it was added
pressure being the daughter of some
one on faculty, but the status did have
its perks.
"It's really great. Because he knows
so much about what it's like to go into
the field, he's a huge help," she said.
And the million dollar question: How

did you get in?
Kurz said that although the question bothered him at first,
he feels that after three years on campus he has risen above
the issue.
"I think when I first got here, I felt like it was a curse.
I was always proud of my dad and his accomplishments,
so I never gave it a second thought when I told people he
was a professor here," Kurz said. "My parents are a big
part of my identity, there's no way around it. But I think
some people assume that the only reason I got into Stan
ford was because of his presence as a tenured faculty

member. If people still think that way now, it doesn't
bother me, because I feel like I've carved my own path
here."
Zajonc said she has had a very positive experience at
Stanford and is glad she has had the opportunity to study
where her parents teach.
"It is definitely a gift," said Zajonc. "It gave me an oppor
tunity to be exposed to my parents' passions and ideas ... a
chance that few kids seem to have. When friends of mine who
have taken my parents' classes have good things to say, 1 am
forced to reevaluate my own childish thoughts about my par
ents. I am extremely proud of them."

From afar, they look and act like any other student on
campus. They join fraternities and sororities, travel abroad
and work — and party — hard.
But when these students go home, they go home to the
professors who teach your classes and grade your exams.
Faculty brats — that's what they call themselves on The
facebook.com.
Nathan Kurz is one. A junior and history major, Kurz is
the son of Mordecai Kurz, a economics professor, and his
mother received her Ph.D. in political science at Stanford.
Other faculty brats include John McGee, a freshman
whose mother Sharon Long is a professor of biological sci
ences; JJ Ross, a junior majoring in psychology whose father,
Brian Ross, is a visiting professor of cognitive psychology
from University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign; and Krysia
Rose Zajonc, a sophomore film studies major whose parents
are social psychology professors Robert Zajonc and Hazel
Rose Markus.
These high-profile students face many issues — privacy,
heightened academic expectations from peers and faculty,
and the touchy question of whether they were admitted be
cause of their parents.
For many, choosing the right college meant getting as far
away from parents as possible in a quest for self-discovery,
freedom and privacy. However, as a general trend, these stu
dents said that their parents had no effect on their decision to
come to Stanford, even if it meant taking the risk of bumping
into them on campus once in a while.
Most children of faculty said they typically saw their par
ents once or twice a week. Yet some students were more ex
treme in the amount of time they spent with their parents.
"Just to show how physically large this campus is, I've
only run into him once around Stanford," said Kurz about his
father.
McGee concurred. "It really isn't a big deal, you will
rarely see them." he said.
Zajonc, however, said that she sees her parents "pretty
much every day."
Students seemed to have a fair amount of control over
their exposure to their parents.
A senior, who wished to remain anonymous to protect her
family?s privacy, explained: "My freshmen year, I made it a
point to only go home over vacations, when everyone else
went home too. But, now, as a senior, I like being able to see
my parents more often than once every three months."
When asked what they would do if parents tried to ac
cess their thefacebook.com profile given that faculty are
allowed to open accounts on the Web site, Zajonc said,
"My mom actually was thinking about using profiles on
Thefacebook.com to gather data about Stanford students.
I immediately asked her if she had seen mine. She told me
she tries to stay out of that realm of my life. Yeah right.

mom. You read it. And yes, those are
forties duck-taped to our hands. "
These students mentioned that their
peers often had heightened expecta
tions of their academic abilities, partic
ularly in the area where their parents
were professors.
"When I took Econ 1 last year, I cer
tainly felt a little pressure. 1 think 1
struggled with some of the concepts at
the beginning, and everyone looked at
me kind of funny," Kurz said. "They
were like, ?shouldn't this stuff be in
your blood or something?? By the end,
I had a pretty good mastery of the basic
concepts, and I like some of the ways of
thinking in economics, but it just didn't
interest me enough to warrant further
courses."
This was good for Kurz because, as
he jokingly added, "My dad said he'd
kick me out of class if I ever showed
up."
Prof. Kurz, however, said that he
was happy to have his son at Stanford
"since it is such a fine school."
The question of expectations can be
a more sensitive issue when the student
chooses to major in his or her parents?
