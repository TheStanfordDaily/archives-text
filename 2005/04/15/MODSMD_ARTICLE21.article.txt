# Hooray! Three cheers for Camp Stanford
## 
### EMMA VAUGHN STAFF WRITER 
What would a Stanford Utopia look like? Spending time
under the sun without a worry in the world. Hanging out
with friends without a midterm pending the next day. Using
Stanford's vast array of resources and facilities for personal
fulfillment. Sound impossible?

Not to some. There is a real group of individuals dis
persed throughout campus who do get to enjoy this kind of
Stanford. They are the seniors, who, with careful planning
and little bit of luck, have managed to become exempt from
the burdens of class spring quarter.
Welcome to Camp Stanford.
These students are tapping into the undiscovered secrets
and joys of college life, such as watching TV, excessively tan
ning and exercising, drinking too much and the unprece
dented reading-for-pleasure. For them, Stanford is nothing
but a beautiful playground in which to do exactly what they
desire.
"I've been unbelievably busy," said senior Jennifer Shen.
"I'm working with a visiting scholar from the International
Rescue Committee. I joined the Stanford Alumni Mentor
ing program leadership team. I'm working of a tsunami re
lief project. I have a couple part-time jobs, and I'm doing
prep work for summer and long-term jobs."
This kind of schedule, however, are the minority. Most of
the seniors are enjoying the virtues of having nothing to do.
Senior Graeme Mullen, who is currently pursuing screen
writing, has adopted a different mentality. He hopes that his
current spring quarter life-style will continue indefinitely.
"I don't really ever want to find a job," said Mullens. "I
might do some restaurant work or something like that but I
don't want to get in a career. I just want to write and pursue
that on my own."
However, life isn't totally carefree for Mullens, who has
been battling with the Registrar's Office since the beginning
of the quarter, ever since his petition to graduate during win
ter quarter did not go through because of a computer glitch.

Mullens could not physically go to the Registrar either, since
he was in Oxford during winter quarter.
"It's been a long battle with the bureaucracy," said Mul
lens. "They were trying to charge me $2,500 for absolutely
nothing. They said it for the permit for service only status,
which is for seniors who are writing their thesis and using the
library and other facilities, but I'm not using anything. After
petitioning for awhile, I've now gotten them down to $100."
The issue of money is yet another perk for these already
privileged seniors. The majority of those who are not doing
thesis work only have to pay for housing and food, which can
be as low as $1,500. When compared with the $13,000 that a
normal student has to pay each quarter, staying on campus
without enrolling is definitely less taxing on the budget. It
also presents a viable justification for parents who are not
too keen on the idea of no-classes.
"I figured that my parents would be pretty upset," said se
nior Bobby Deharo. "But because the financial savings are
so great, they're actually thrilled,"
Then there are the social trends of having no class. With
no papers due or exams to take, partying takes on a whole
new level for these seniors.
To further identify and connect with each other, these se
niors have even set up their own thefacebook.com group,
entitled "senior badasses without classes." With 55 current
members, the group emphasizes the mentality of "living it
up" and "going out in the middle of week."
"We can basically drink whenever we want and there's a
lot of sex and hooking up floating freely around," Deharo
said. "Nobody is really pursuing love but everyone is kind of
after their last hoorah."
