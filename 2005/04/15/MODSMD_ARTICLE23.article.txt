## Editorial Anyone know where the exit is?

Two years alter the fall of Saddam Hussein, the
American-led military campaign in Iraq has made
enough progress in fighting insurgents and training
Iraqi security forces to convince the Pentagon to plan
for significant troop reductions. But we still have no
exit strategy.
January 30 has passed and the new president of
Iraq, Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani, has been elected
and sworn in along with a new prime minister and two
new vice presidents; collectively they represent a
cross-section of Iraq's diverse population. With a new
275-member National Assembly, Iraqi leaders have,
on multiple occasions, voiced their dedication to the
principles of democracy and respect for human rights.
If the U.S. government and the United Nations have
confirmed these facts, why are our troops still there?
Maybe there's more to the situation than the Bush
administration's claim that everything is going
smoothly. True, reports have confirmed that attacks
on allied forces have dropped to 30 to 40 a day, down
from an average of 140 per day in the weeks leading
up to the elections. On average, however, one or more
Americans still die every day in Iraq from roadside
bombs and troop warfare, not to mention that many
of Americans have been injured. Just this week,
American worker Jeffrey Ake was kidnapped in
Baghdad and shown in a videotape on A1 Jazeera tele
vision network. The situation may be worse than most
Americans think — but that only adds more urgency
to the question, "What goals must we meet before our
troops can go home? How much longer must we put
American lives on the line?"
Late last year. President George W. Bush an
nounced that January 30 would be a turning point in
the involvement of the American-led forces, saying
that the election of a secure democratic Iraqi govern
ment would be the ultimate goal of the campaign. De
spite the Bush administration's claims that important
goals have been met, American leaders have not put
forth an exit strategy that in any way reflects our de
sire to see Iraq govern itself.
This week began with a series of protests and
marches in Baghdad by Iraqi citizens who also want-

Ed to know when American troops would leave Iraq.
In addition, these protestors begged the question that
many Americans have forgotten to ask, "When will
Saddam Hussein be tried for crimes against humani
ty?" Our stated purpose in going to war against the
wishes of United Nations was to oust a man who
threatened the livelihood of his people and to try him
in a court of justice for the crimes he committed (at
least, that's what the Bush administration tells us now
that those pesky weapons of mass destruction are
nowhere to be found).
However, after his statue fell in Baghdad's Firdos
Square and Hussein was found in a foxhole, the
American public forgot to demand that its govern
ment finish the job it started — to bring Saddam Hus
sein to "justice." We have been, for the last few weeks,
focused on reports about Terri Schiavo, the death of
the Pope, Michael Jackson and social security. Mean
while, our government is spending $4 billion a month
on a war that we are supposedly winning — but we're
not winning by enough to plan how we are going to
end the war.
Bush, Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice
have all said that great strides have been made in Iraq
but that there's still long road ahead. At what point do
the Iraqi people need to travel that road alone? Is the
new goal to ensure perfect democracy in Iraq or to get
them on that road so that they may define their own
form of democracy? We were told we invaded Iraq to
seize weapons of mass destruction, but now we are fo
cused on democratizing the nation. While establishing
a stable democracy in the Middle East may very well
be in our national security interest, prolonged Amer
ican military presence may hinder — not help — this
goal by catalyzing insurgency and civil unrest. It seems
that we do not have the slightest idea of how democ
racy might manifest itself and when our presence in
Iraq is no longer needed. The Bush administration
needs to resolve this issue.
We demand to know when our troops are coming
home and we insist that our government stop placat
ing the public with stories of victory and tales of cau
tion. What is our exit strategy?
