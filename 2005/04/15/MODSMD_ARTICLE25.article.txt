## Notes from the Rolodex university 
### 
It is either the malleability of the
English language or the dutiful mech
anization of American society that al
lows one person to describe another
as an "automaton" and intend it to be
a compliment. Unruffled, predictable,
harmonic. These qualities, or at least
traits, apply to many of us, from re
ceptionists to debate champions to
copy editors.
So too. generally speaking, do they
apply to Stanford students. Consider
the three essential questions upon

meeting another undergraduate: "What year are you?"
"Where do you live?" and "What is your major?"
These three queries do not trip off everyone's tongues
in each new interaction, of course, but 1 — and 1 think
most others — find it difficult to avoid asking at least one
or two of them, and probably within the first moments of
conversation.
When unknowns become acquaintances, and even
friends, most of their conversations still begin with some
variant of the meeting questions: "What classes are you
taking?" "How is your dorm?"
Our habits are certainly dictated to some extent by so
ciological realities. And standard questions at least lay a
common ground from which more intriguing dialogue
emerges.
"Least," however, is the operative term. Verbal space
fillers are useful only if dialogue actually follows; but how
often — as we meet on a sidewalk, mingle at a gathering

or exit class — do we awkwardly part ways, lelt with little
to say after the perfunctory greetings? When the pre
tense of conversation yields nothing more, then our cour
tesy greetings become, in a way. quite shallow.
1 have a friend who abhors schmoozing and would
not touch a cocktail party with a 10-foot pole (which,
at any rate, would be rather inappropriate). He calls
these greetings "token conversation." When such
greetings accumulate on the campus-wide level, one
might say that we inhabit a Rolodex university in
which we seem intent on keeping mental dossiers of
all our fellow travelers. Year, residence, coursework:
we wish to situate each other in the safe confines of
time, space and academics. Is such ephemera all we re
ally care about?
Of course not. But the weight we put on the ephemer
al, however well-intentioned, renders us rather inatten
tive to the emotional and the intellectual livelihood of
those who stand in front of us.
What are the roots of the Rolodex university? They
might lie in the collective national obsession over mag
azine rankings, along with the orderly upbringing with
which most students are delivered to fancy universi
ties. What results is not the closing of the American
college mind, but its empricizing. And when the em
pirical mind is satisfied with the perfunctory greeting,
then superficiality becomes not just satisfying, but ap
pealing.
