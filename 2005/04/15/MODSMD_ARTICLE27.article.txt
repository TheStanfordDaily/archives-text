## 'Roll me out, RoHos' 
### 
At around 7
a.m. Wednesday,
1 was awoken for
the umpteenth
time by what has
become com
monplace in my
all-frosh dorm:
rollouts. It seems
that the multitude
of student organi-

zations at this institution have found
every last reason for which to arouse
an entire dorm in an über-enthusias
tic demonstration of acceptance. So
as 1 gawked about this morning in
confusion and tired stupor, wonder
ing, as I always do, whether or not I
should duck and cover, I began to
think of just how bizarre this rolling
out business really is.
When I realized that this was not,
in fact, an earthquake, and my ex
citement died down (1 tend to get
"excited" about unordinary things,
including the prospect of having
mono), 1 realized with immense re
lief that I was not the target of all the
banging and the shouting. As it turns
out, some sort of remarkable (albeit
weekly) act usually precedes these
rollouts — sorority acceptance in
today's case. Regardless of the mer
its of these aforementioned rollouts,
however, they are undeniably one of
Stanford's many idiosyncratic tradi
tions, the quirks that make Stanford
Stanford, and what sets it apart from
(and dare 1 say above) competing
universities.
So in honor of Admit Weekend
(which will take place April 28-30),
and seeing that 1 myself will have a
Pro Fro visiting today, I thought that
1 would examine some of these id
iosyncrasies. To begin, as a HoHo,
RoHo and a potential Humßio
major, let me discuss the endless
acronyms and abbreviations.
The first warning sign undoubt
edly came more than six months be
fore my first class on the Farm, and
came in the form of the infamous
"Admit Weekend dictionary." Con
tained within the handbook — real
ly just a single page, in all honesty —
was a list of Stanford lingo. These
abbreviations ranged from the
CoHo to MemChu to HooTow to
FloMo and FroSoCo. Honestly, I
understand the necessity and clever
ness of some, but is it really that dif
ficult to say "Hoover Tower"?
Over my first months at Stanford,
I have been introduced to even more

rhetorical lethargy. VoCo and SoCo
(not to be confused with FroSoCo),
to mention a few. Then all the ma
jors: PoliSci, Chem-E and Humßio.
Orig, these threw me fora loop, but
ult 1 have come to recognize the ab
brevs as just another of Stanfo's
many endearing idiosyncs.
And then there are the bike acci
dents, marked by the inexperienced
ticking time-bombs wreaking havoc
on the unsuspecting passersby at,
but not restricted to, the so-called
"intersection of death." This is yet
another of Stanford's many seem
ingly insignificant traits (well, in
significant until you comprise half
the pile-up) that distinguish this
University from others. Plus, there's
nothing like biking between the
Clock Tower and the LangCorn (1
know, I know) at 10:50 a.m. to make
you feel alive.
Of course, there's the obvious
things — the Stanford cliches. But
you know, cliches are cliches fora
reason (cliche, cliche, cliche ... I fig
ured I hadn't said it enough). The
Tree and the one and only, truly in
comparable LSJUMB (there I go
again) certainly fall within this cate
gory, as does "All Right Now," but
more specifically yet, it's the 5-6-7-8-
Jump that is the true gem here.
The multitude of hand motions
and cheers at 6th Man games and
FMOTO (this parenthesis is to back
handedly underscore the preceding
acronym) also add to our eccentrici
ty. But the best traditions are, of
course, the hybrids of multiple ritu
als — and what fits with absolutely
anything like a good old 6 a.m. roll
out? I'm referring to, of course, the
early Valentine's morning guys-to
girls serenade (my dorm sang an in
spiring rendition of "Build Me Up
Buttercup") and the first day of the
class rollout/fountain hopping ex
travaganza.
So ultimately I don't mind being
woken up at 6 a.m. on a weekly basis
if it means maintaining these quirky
traditions, which more than any
thing make Stanford great. And hell,
for that split second I can get
wrapped up in the excitement of a
9.0 earthquake.

Kalani went to the U2 concert last Sat
urday and hasn't thought about any
thing else since (including during the
time in which he wrote this column).
