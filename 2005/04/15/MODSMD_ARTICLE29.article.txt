## Armenian genocide must not be forgotten 
### ANI KARDASHIAN 
Throughout the 1990s and today, crimes
against humanity in Rwanda, Kosovo and
the Darfur region of Sudan have compelled
Stanford students to take an active role in ad
dressing worldwide issues of human rights
crimes and genocide. Last Saturday, about
100 students joined in STANDFast. a nation
wide fast commemorating the 11th anniver
sary of the beginning of the Rwandan geno
cide. to raise money for the victims of the cri
sis in Darfur. The burgeoning interest among
the undergraduate population in genocide
affairs is a small step toward galvanizing na
tional action against these recent crimes
against humanity. Stanford students took an
even bigger moral step forward this week
with the passage of an Undergraduate Sen
ate bill commemorating the 90th anniversary
of the Armenian Genocide.

And it's about time.
I am always pleasantly surprised by the
few people I meet on campus who know of
the first genocide of the 20th century, the Ar
menian genocide of 1915, perpetrated by the
Young Turks in an attempt to systematically
eradicate the Armenian population through
out the Ottoman Empire. Yet my elation is
always clouded by the disturbing fact that the
majority of the people on campus have not
even heard of the genocide, an event that ac
counts for more than 1.5 million deaths and
for the displacement of an entire ethnic pop
ulation from their homeland.
At the turn of the 20th century, the Young
Turk regime emerged, consisting of radical
young military officers who were troubled by
the decline of Ottoman power, the numerous
minority groups inhabiting the empire and
the stagnant environment of the empire.
They espoused a form of Turkish national
ism called Pan-Turkism, or Turanism, which

created a new and improved empire sans the
problem of minorities. As U.S. Ambassador
Morgenthau observed, "The time had finally
come to make Turkey exclusively the coun
try of the Turks." The Armenians, as the
biggest minority within the empire, became
the main obstacle to Turanism and beginning
in April 1915 the defenseless victims of geno
cide. Under the guise of World War I, the
Young Turk regime displaced the Armenian
population from their villages to the Syrian
Desert for the next eight years, using depor
tations as a new form of massacre.
While making no attempt to conceal these
atrocities, the Turkish government denies
that the Armenian genocide ever occurred.
Turkish denial of the genocide and attempts
to erase their past atrocities from the history
books has prompted the members of the in
ternational community, including the United
States, to refuse acknowledging that the
genocide actually occurred. This denial has

arguably contributed to future genocides, in
cluding the Holocaust and more recent geno
cides in Rwanda and Darfur. Only three
decades after the Armenian genocide for ex
ample, Hitler realized this international ig
norance and used it as fodder for executing
the Jewish Holocaust, remarking "Who,
after all, speaks today of the annihilation of
the Armenians?"
Nine decades later, as the memory of the
Armenian genocide lives on. it is imperative
that we recognize this abhorrent crime
against humanity and fight inaction, which
inevitably leads to future genocide. Hopeful
ly the passage of the genocide bill by the Sen
ate will promote greater awareness on cam
pus and stress the need to act against such in
humane offenses that occur today. In con
junction with the passage of the genocide
bill, the Armenian Students Association is
holding Fast For Armenia, a charity event
commemorating the victims of the genocide

and constructing a brighter future for the Re
public of Armenia.
While the Armenian community is pro
moting awareness on campuses like Stanford
and throughout the world, the active denial
from Turkey hinders closure from the past.
The wounds inflicted by the Turks, still raw
and tender, continue to fester, unable to heal
from the stigma of denial. And while we wait
for the day to come when Turkey will own up
to its responsibilities as it proceeds to join the
European Union, we must recognize the im
portance of shedding light on the memory of
such minority groups as the Armenians,
Jews, Sudanese in Darfur. and Rwandans
that flicker with hope fora brighter future
rather than fade away with the past.
