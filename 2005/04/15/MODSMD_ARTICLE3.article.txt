# Smith sizzles at the hot corner

### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
One day in the second grade. Michelle
Smith, clutching a flier fora local recre
ational team, announced to her parents
that she wanted to play softball.
Her father, Russ Smith, a former out
fielder at Cal State-Northridge, was ecstatic.
"I couldn't wait to teach her all I knew,
so we spent a lot of time practicing togeth
er from the get go," he said. "She's a quick
learner. She caught on fast." Throughout
Michelle's childhood, Russ played modi
fied fast-pitch softball for his bank in a Los
Angeles financial league.
"He taught me how to catch and he
taught me how to throw and hit before I got
on to a team and then from there the coach
es would teach me more," Michelle said.
"But he was the first one that showed me

how to do anything."
Her father wasn't lenient, though. If
Michelle got it wrong, he corrected her and
he wouldn't let her do something wrong
twice. But once she got it correct, he says,
he backed off.
"He would try and teach me as much as
he could up to a point as I was getting
through high school," Michelle said. "And
even then he would listen to what my
coaches were telling me and he would try to
learn from that and then still help me."
When Stanford started recruiting Smith
a few years ago, it was not only a dream
come true for the right-sided hitter, but for
the whole family as well. The dream seems
to be getting better and better for father
and daughter, as Smith helps power her
team toward the Women's College World
Series in Oklahoma.
The third baseman has been coming

through in recent Pac-10 games, both at the
plate and on the field. Smith made head
lines twice, hitting three-run home runs in
back-to-back games against No. 20 Wash
ington last weekend. Her performance
earned her a nomination fora third Pac-10
Player of the Week award.
Last week's showing was a routine
Michelle has donÂ» a lot this season. A
power hitter most of her career, Michelle
now has a team-leading 12 home runs. Her
seven RBI in the past two games give her
32 RBI this season, which also leads the
team. She sits fourth in average among
starters with a .327 mark in 35 games.
One can't ask much more from the fresh
man starter. Smith already played at a high
level before coming to college, which gave
her a glimpse of some of the best pitchers in
