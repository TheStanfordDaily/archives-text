# Smith sizzles at the hot corner

### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
One day in the second grade. Michelle
Smith, clutching a flier fora local recre
ational team, announced to her parents
that she wanted to play softball.
Her father, Russ Smith, a former out
fielder at Cal State-Northridge, was ecstatic.
"I couldn't wait to teach her all I knew,
so we spent a lot of time practicing togeth
er from the get go," he said. "She's a quick
learner. She caught on fast." Throughout
Michelle's childhood, Russ played modi
fied fast-pitch softball for his bank in a Los
Angeles financial league.
"He taught me how to catch and he
taught me how to throw and hit before I got
on to a team and then from there the coach
es would teach me more," Michelle said.
"But he was the first one that showed me

how to do anything."
Her father wasn't lenient, though. If
Michelle got it wrong, he corrected her and
he wouldn't let her do something wrong
twice. But once she got it correct, he says,
he backed off.
"He would try and teach me as much as
he could up to a point as I was getting
through high school," Michelle said. "And
even then he would listen to what my
coaches were telling me and he would try to
learn from that and then still help me."
When Stanford started recruiting Smith
a few years ago, it was not only a dream
come true for the right-sided hitter, but for
the whole family as well. The dream seems
to be getting better and better for father
and daughter, as Smith helps power her
team toward the Women's College World
Series in Oklahoma.
The third baseman has been coming

through in recent Pac-10 games, both at the
plate and on the field. Smith made head
lines twice, hitting three-run home runs in
back-to-back games against No. 20 Wash
ington last weekend. Her performance
earned her a nomination fora third Pac-10
Player of the Week award.
Last week's showing was a routine
Michelle has don» a lot this season. A
power hitter most of her career, Michelle
now has a team-leading 12 home runs. Her
seven RBI in the past two games give her
32 RBI this season, which also leads the
team. She sits fourth in average among
starters with a .327 mark in 35 games.
One can't ask much more from the fresh
man starter. Smith already played at a high
level before coming to college, which gave
her a glimpse of some of the best pitchers in

In addition to her stellar offensive numbers, freshman third baseman Michelle Smith has been steady in the field for the No. 8 Cardinal.
the country, head coach John Rittman
explained.
"She's patient," Rittman said.
"Teams kind of pitch around her or
pitch to her weaknesses. She must be
selective at the plate and wait for her
pitch."
The freshman has said that com
petitiveness is what she loves most
about sports. But being competitive
doesn't mean she doesn't love to share
the glory.
"As long as someone gets the job
done, that's OK with me," Smith said.
While Smith remains humble, it's
evident to others how her competi
tiveness drives her. According to assis
tant coach Trisha Dean, Smith comes
in almost every day for extra hitting
and to ask about certain situations.
Smith then goes on the field and takes
the same eager approach.

"She lakes a lot of pride in fielding
ground balls," Dean said. "She gets
dirty every practice, diving and slid
ing."
Smith and the Stanford infield —
comprised of lreshnien Erin Howe
and Tricia Aggabao and junior Lau
ren Lappin — have quickly grown
close.
"You can always rely [on Smith],"
Howe said. "When the ball is hit to
third. 1 am very sure there is going to
be an automatic out. She's come
through all year. When there are two
outs and the ball is hit to third, I am
pretty much walking off the field."
The competitiveness that moti
vates Smith when she's in uniform also
motivates her off the diamond.
"I'm considering a Humßio major
and 1 heard that's a really competitive
major," she said. "So I'm going to have
to do whatever I can because I want to
go to med school."
While she has yet to declare her
major. Smith already has plans after
college. Not surprisingly, they involve
sports. She hopes to become an ortho

pedic surgeon specializing in sports
medicine.
"I've had many of the injuries I'd
be working with, so 1 figure I'd know
more about them," Michelle laughed.
Now that Michelle is blazing her
own path in college, her father, aside
from attending most of her games,
plays a smaller role in coaching his old
est daughter.
"Now, since he can't be here to see
what I'm learning and what my coach
es are telling me, he pretty much men
tions things like 'Oh, your swing looks
really good.' He'll still give advice,"
Michelle said.
The athletic talents run in the fam
ily, giving Russ Smith another shot at
sharing his knowledge and love all
over again. Michelle's younger sister,
Andi, is coached by their father. The
younger Smith has often been in
Michelle's long shadow, but the Smith
Softball genes are there. Still, accord
ing to Russ, Andi's challenges will be a
little different than Michelle's.
"She has big shoes to fill," he said.
