# Conference addresses women's role in sciences
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's Institute for Research on
Women and Gender begins its two-day con
ference on the impact of gender analysis in sci
ence, medicine and engineering today. The
event, entitled "Gendered Innovations in Sci
ence and Engineering," will bring together
professors, scientists and industry representa
tives from around the world.
The event has taken on a special signifi
cance for many of the coordinators due to the
controversial comments made by Harvard
President Lawrence Summers on January 14
that women may be at an innate disadvantage
in the fields of math and science.
Londa Schiebinger, director of Stanford's
Institute for Research on Women and Gen
der, explained that while the Summers contro
versy has piqued interest in scientific educa
tion for women, it is only one of many issues
related to the role of gender in the sciences.
"The firestorm surrounding Summers' re
marks has focused attention on the need to get
more women into the hard sciences and engi
neering," Schiebinger said. "But those de
bates have not touched one of the key aspects
of recruiting girls and women into math, sci
ence and engineering — how gender impacts
scientific thinking.?
She added that many women tend to clus
ter in particular subfields of science.
"Why is this so?" she said. "What is it about
these subfields that attract women?"
Schiebinger emphasized that while the con
ference seeks to address inequalities between
the genders in scientific disciplines, its larger
goal is to explore how gender can alter the
landscape of these academic areas.
Topics covered at the conference will range
from women's health to the influence of gen
der on technological design. The title of one
talk, for instance, is "Archaeology and the

Feminist Method Debate." Another is "Are
Photons Gendered? A Woman's View of As
tronomy and Physics."
The conference will also feature a
roundtable discussion on public policy relat
ing to the sciences with representatives from
the ethics and science unit of the European
Commission and the German Aerospace Cen
ter.
Schiebinger described the goal of the con
ference as threefold: to showcase examples of
creative scientific successes inspired by gender
analysis; to explore methods of applying gen
der analysis to new fields; and to contribute to
an understanding of the effect of gender on
science as a whole.
"We want to move the debate to a new
level by analyzing how gender analysis can
create new knowledge," Schiebinger said.
"Disciplines are somewhat arbitrary ways
of cutting up knowledge," she added. "We
need to be open to the possibility that human
knowledge — what we know, what we value,
what we consider important — may change
dramatically when women become full part
ners."
While the conference will touch on a broad
variety of topics, much attention will be fo
cused on gender inequality and Summers'
comments. While few academics seem to sup
port his assertions, many expressed approval
for their unintended consequence — height
ened awareness of women?s role in science.
"It gets the topic into the newspapers," said
Cherrill Spencer, a mechanical engineer at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, in a Jan
uary Stanford Report article. "I don't see any
thing wrong with getting it into the newspa
pers as long as people read to the end."
The conference, which will take place in
Wallenberg Hall, is co-sponsored by the
Provost Office Gabilan Fund and the Nation
al Science Foundation. It is free and open to
the public.
