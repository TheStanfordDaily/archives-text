# Faculty Senate hears stem-cell proposal
## 
### ANDREW LEIFER 
The Faculty Senate met yesterday
afternoon to address the University's
stem-cell research policies and to re
view progress on a new campus-wide
database and finance system.
The Senate's committee on re
search presented a draft of a policy
proposal entitled Human Embry
onic Stem Cell Research," which
seeks to formally codify Stanford
regulations to reflect new federal and
state legislation.
In the past five years, the govern
ment has placed increasing restric
tions on the use of government funds
for stem cell research. On Aug. 9,
2001 President George W. Bush en
acted laws prohibiting researchers
from using federal funds to conduct
research on any human embryonic
stem cells other than those derived
from pre-existing sources.
When these existing sources,
called stem-cell lines, are depleted,
no researcher will legally be able to
use federal funds to study any human
embryonic stem cells. In Nov. 2(XH,
California voters passed Proposition
71 which provided more than $3 bil
lion for stem cell research in Califor
nia, providing that researchers fol
lowed guidelines outlined by the
state.
The draft presented to the Senate
would formalize University policies
to separate stem-cell funding from
other sources of research funding.
Associate Dean of Research Ann
Arvin presented the draft for com
ments and feedback.
"We are accustomed to doing
biomedical research with support
from multiple funding sources, and
we usually do not have to segregate
these activities," she said.
The policy would create provi
sions for tracking all stem-cell re
search and funding at the University.
It would also provide for the training
of stem-cell scientists about federal
rules and regulations, and would cre
ate infrastructure to monitor re
searchers' compliance with existing
laws. It has yet to be determined ex
actly how restrictive the laws accom
panying this funding will be in prac
tice.
For example, Stanford must be
careful not to use federal funding for
the physical costs of maintaining lab
oratory space for stem-cell research.
Stanley Falkow, a professor of micro
biology and immunology, said he was
unsure how far this line of reasoning

would go.
"Can you use common equip
ment or do you have to buy a new mi
croscope to look at these (stem
cells]?" Falkow asked Arvin.
Questions such as these will be
ironed out at a future date in operat
ing procedures set by the Office of
Research Administration.
Stem cells are undifferentiated
and have the potential to develop
into any number of primary cells and
tissues. Researchers hope to use
these rarefied cells to light diseases
by growing specific organs and tis
sues to suit a patients' needs.
In addition to this research, the
Faculty Senate reviewed progress on
updating the University's outdated
financial database. The Senate heard
a report from the Huron Consulting
Group, which assessed the progress
of installing and transitioning to a
new database system produced by
Oracle.
Stanford's current financial
database software system was writ
ten by People Soft, a company that
was acquired by Oracle in early 2005.
University President John Hen
nessy and Provost John Etchemendy
have allocated $6 million in project
funds and an additional $2 million for
the transition to the new Oracle sys
tem. The new program will include
advanced features to allow faculty to
be easily reimbursed online and to
streamline the process of purchasing
various supplies.
Any new system will be challeng
ing to create and implement, said
Stanford's Director of Procurement
Susan Webert.
"Our decentralized workflow
rroodel is wholly unlike any other in
stitution in industry," she said, refer
ring to the complicated approval pro
cess inherent in a large research insti
tution.
Etchemendy defended Stanford's
choice to purchase a commercial
software solution instead of collabo
rating with other universities to write
their own.
"My experience with collabora
tive software projects — particularly
among different universities — is
that they tend to fail miserably," he
said. "And it is not obvious at all that
a consortium will produce a solution
that will be any easier to implement
than any commercial solutions."
According to Huron Vice Presi
dent Randy Livingston, the transi
tion to the new software is half-way
complete.
