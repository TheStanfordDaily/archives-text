# iProcrastinate competes with Thefacebook.com
## 
### NILA BALA STAFF WRITER 
Amid red swirling hypnotic circles,
the homepage of iPtocrastinate.com
lists its features: "Blogs, photos, cal
enders, IM with video chat, import
facebook profiles, open to every
school, find parties and events."
Released on April 11 by Miami
Merchants Inc., a student-founded
business at the University of Miami,
iProcrastinate.com was developed to
rival Thefacebook.com. Already
boasting 94,309 users, the Web site
has a competitive edge because it al
lows all users with .edu e-mail ad
dresses to register.
"Schools that have been forsaken
by Thefacebook will be welcomed by
iProcrastinate from day one because
everyone with a .edu e-mail address
can sign up," said Margaret Scott,
head of media and public relations for
Miami Merchants. "On Theface
book, your school has to have prior
approval in order for students to be
able to register."
The Web site claims to be the "col
lege social networking site of the fu
ture."
College Junction, an online auc
tion site for people with .edu address
es, is another high-profile Miami
Merchants production, and those
who are registered on the College
Junction site were immediately
signed up for iProcrastinate.
Senior Josh Seifert, a resident
assistant in Larkin, is one of the six
Stanford students currently regis
tered on iProcrastinate for this
reason.
"It's really strange, 1 don't remem
ber registering on iProcrastinate," he
said, "I got on College Junction fora
research project on college auction
Web sites and didn't know that I
would be registered in iProcrasti
nate.com. The first time I ever logged
on was when I was told I was listed on
the site."
Another Stanford registrant is
freshman Elizabeth Amstutz, who,
like Seifert, was signed up uninten
tionally.
"I know virtually nothing about
iProcrastinate," she said. "I was actu
ally added as an import from some

one else's friends list from Theface
book. From the one time I've looked
at it, it doesn't seem as user-friendly as
Thefacebook or Myspace.com."
As soon as a student completes the
iProcrastinate registration process,
Columbia student Steve Hofstetter
automatically becomes his or her
friend.
Hofstetter is "on a quest to get a
bazillion Facebook friends," Scott
said. "The automatic friending of
Steve gives people a base to commu
nicate with."
Students who have checked out
the Web site said they found it slow
and cumbersome and disliked the in
terlace in comparison with Theface
book. Several mentioned that the au
tomatic befriending of Hofstetter
seemed strange and turned them off
the site.
"The interface and design isn't as
good," said sophomore Yi-ren Chen.
"iProcrastinate seems kind of messy,
with almost dichotomous colors of
red and green."
He added that the Web site was
cluttered with too many random links
and advertisements that seemed irrel
evant to its content.
"iProcrastinate may claim a com
petitive advantage, but their database
is worthlessly slow," Seifert said.
"Thefacebook has a critical mas of
users; iProcrastinate simply doesn't."
While Scott said that iProcrasti
nate and Thefacebook have main
tained a "healthy competitive spirit"
thus far, Chris Hughes, spokesperson
for Thefacebook, said that his compa
ny has not felt any impact since its
competitor's debut.
It doesn't seem to be growing at
all," Hughes said, referring to iPro
crastinate. "We're currently at 495
schools and almost 2.3 million users."
When asked if she was at all con
cerned that iProcrastinate would
distract even more students from
schoolwork, Scott said that the site's
users will likely exercise good judg
ment.
"Just the fact that you have been
admitted to college proves that you
have a sensible head on your shoul
ders to make judgment calls on things
like, when to and not to procrasti
nate." she said.
