## Jeff Dorman Sucks! Tennis can be good for the soul 
### 
I have a beer in my hand, a smile on my
face and it's my serve. I call out "Moon
ball! and proceed to hit a forehand sky
high, as if testing the upper limits of my in
calculable strength. The ball is returned in
three hits, prompting my teammate to lunge
for the ball, deflecting it to me. I swing,
grunting as I hit my forehand, aiming fora
box on the baseline.
As the ball nears its target, 1 yell "Hit the
case! Hit it!" and sure enough, the ball
smacks the case of Keystone on the baseline,
prompting my team to erupt in cheers and
the other team to drown their misery in a
mandatory chug.
So you all play beer pong. Fine. You've
kicked a sloshball. Cool. Hell, some of you
might even play quarters, which is a true test

of skill. But none of you,
lest you be one of the 10 or
so people that have played
the game, have played the
greatest drunk sport of all
time. Yes, of all time. It is
called Drunk Tennis, and it
is going to change your life.
On a side note, Mitch
Hedberg died a few days
ago. He was one of my fa-

vorite comics and a true inspiration to many.
Drunk Tennis, I'm sure, is a sport he would
have supported 100 percent. For those of
you who have never heard of him, here's a
joke of his:
"My friend asked me if I wanted a frozen
banana and I said, 'No, but I want a regular
banana later, so, yeah!"'
But back to Drunk Tennis. Don't read
this column and write it off as one of
Spencer's lame ideas. This is a well thought
out game that deserves some respect and
should become as popular as Diet Coke in Pi
Phi. So in order to give this game to the
masses, here is a "how-to" on how to play
Drunk Tennis:
Gather 10 of your best friends, flush with
tennis racquets and balls. These people can
include dormmates, girlfriends and casual
acquaintances. Parents, ex-girlfriends and
officers of the law are not recommended.
Buy two cases of cheap, light beer. Do not
buy Coors Light, because it will prompt a
negative reaction from a liberal friend of
yours who will whine on and on about how
Coors doesn't let their workers unionize,
and honestly, at 8 p.m. on a Friday night,
who wants to get into an in-depth discussion
of labor regulation in the alcohol industry?
Not you, that's for sure.
You have already reserved a tennis court,
so when you show up with two cases of beer
on court seven, squashed between two
courts chock full of graduate students, smile
politely and say, "Don't worry, we re Mor
mons." This will confuse the hell out of
them.
Make two teams. Generally, keep the
