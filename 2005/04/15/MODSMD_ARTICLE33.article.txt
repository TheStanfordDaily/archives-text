## Jeff Dorman Sucks! Tennis can be good for the soul 
### 
I have a beer in my hand, a smile on my
face and it's my serve. I call out "Moon
ball! and proceed to hit a forehand sky
high, as if testing the upper limits of my in
calculable strength. The ball is returned in
three hits, prompting my teammate to lunge
for the ball, deflecting it to me. I swing,
grunting as I hit my forehand, aiming fora
box on the baseline.
As the ball nears its target, 1 yell "Hit the
case! Hit it!" and sure enough, the ball
smacks the case of Keystone on the baseline,
prompting my team to erupt in cheers and
the other team to drown their misery in a
mandatory chug.
So you all play beer pong. Fine. You've
kicked a sloshball. Cool. Hell, some of you
might even play quarters, which is a true test

of skill. But none of you,
lest you be one of the 10 or
so people that have played
the game, have played the
greatest drunk sport of all
time. Yes, of all time. It is
called Drunk Tennis, and it
is going to change your life.
On a side note, Mitch
Hedberg died a few days
ago. He was one of my fa-

vorite comics and a true inspiration to many.
Drunk Tennis, I'm sure, is a sport he would
have supported 100 percent. For those of
you who have never heard of him, here's a
joke of his:
"My friend asked me if I wanted a frozen
banana and I said, 'No, but I want a regular
banana later, so, yeah!"'
But back to Drunk Tennis. Don't read
this column and write it off as one of
Spencer's lame ideas. This is a well thought
out game that deserves some respect and
should become as popular as Diet Coke in Pi
Phi. So in order to give this game to the
masses, here is a "how-to" on how to play
Drunk Tennis:
Gather 10 of your best friends, flush with
tennis racquets and balls. These people can
include dormmates, girlfriends and casual
acquaintances. Parents, ex-girlfriends and
officers of the law are not recommended.
Buy two cases of cheap, light beer. Do not
buy Coors Light, because it will prompt a
negative reaction from a liberal friend of
yours who will whine on and on about how
Coors doesn't let their workers unionize,
and honestly, at 8 p.m. on a Friday night,
who wants to get into an in-depth discussion
of labor regulation in the alcohol industry?
Not you, that's for sure.
You have already reserved a tennis court,
so when you show up with two cases of beer
on court seven, squashed between two
courts chock full of graduate students, smile
politely and say, "Don't worry, we re Mor
mons." This will confuse the hell out of
them.
Make two teams. Generally, keep the


Spencer Porter
teams fair, based on athletic ability. But make
sure to split up any couples; nobody wants to lose
a point because a man known as "Bobbado Gi
gante" was getting frisky with his girlfriend in the
doubles alley (cough cough). Have each team
place a case of beer in the center of the baseline
and make sure each player has a beer in hand at
all times.
The more obnoxious team serves first, so just
see which team has more Texans and let them
start. Serves are supposed to be tame, so just lob
the ball into the opposite side. Don't worry about
putting it"in," as long as it is playable by any
member of the opposing team, it's "in."
Of course, when the girl from Beverly Hills
throws together a lame and eventually unsuccess
ful attempt to play the ball, yelling "Oh my god,
that was so out!," laugh at her. When this girl then
tells you that you have "no chance with me
tonight," believe her. And when she says that "you
say '1 love you' too much," she's probably right. If
you are dating this girl, well then, you are me.
As soon as possible, finish your beer. Once you
have an empty beer can in your hand, casually
stroll up to someone on the other team that isn't
drinking enough. This person will not-so-coinci
dentally also be putting a little too much effort
into his performance. Throw your empty beer can
at him. If it hits him, he must drink. If you miss,
drink another! If you, in the process of throwing
your beer can, grip it on the sharp part of the
opening of the can, split your finger open and
bleed all over your t-shirt, you are, again, me.
Ask what the score is. If the other team tells
you that you are losing by more than five points,
vehemently and belligerently disagree. Haggle
your way down to a two-point deficit.
When they serve, make sure you set up your
return shot well. Remember, you are allowed un
limited hits per side, but only two consecutive hits
per individual player, so passing is key. Bump-set
spike is your best friend. Full baseball swings that
launch the tennis ball into court six are your worst
enemy and will increase tension in the already
tenuous detente you have going with your grad
school neighbors. By now, they know you aren't
Mormons.
But seriously, make sure you win the game.
Don't step on the discarded beer cans at your
feet; they are land mines and will lose the point
for your team. Do play dirty. Hitting other play
ers with your racquet is an excellent strategy. And
whatever you do, make sure you aim for the other
team's case of beer. If you hit it, the point is yours
and the other team must chug what they have.
So when you find yourself at 14-0 tonight,
needing one point to win the game, thank your
humble columnist and remember that rice is great
if you're hungry and you want to eat two thou
sand of something. Thanks, Mitch.

But back to Drunk Tennis. Don't read
this column and write it off as one of
Spencer's lame ideas. This is a well thought
out game that deserves some respect and
should become as popular as Diet Coke in Pi
Phi. So in order to give this game to the
masses, here is a "how-to" on how to play
Drunk Tennis:
Gather 10 of your best friends, flush with
tennis racquets and balls. These people can
include dormmates, girlfriends and casual
acquaintances. Parents, ex-girlfriends and
officers of the law are not recommended.
Buy two cases of cheap, light beer. Do not
buy Coors Light, because it will prompt a
negative reaction from a liberal friend of
yours who will whine on and on about how
Coors doesn't let their workers unionize,
and honestly, at 8 p.m. on a Friday night,
who wants to get into an in-depth discussion
of labor regulation in the alcohol industry?
Not you, that's for sure.
You have already reserved a tennis court,
so when you show up with two cases of beer
on court seven, squashed between two
courts chock full of graduate students, smile
politely and say, "Don't worry, we re Mor
mons." This will confuse the hell out of
them.
Make two teams. Generally, keep the


Spencer Porter
teams fair, based on athletic ability. But make
sure to split up any couples; nobody wants to lose
a point because a man known as "Bobbado Gi
gante" was getting frisky with his girlfriend in the
doubles alley (cough cough). Have each team
place a case of beer in the center of the baseline
and make sure each player has a beer in hand at
all times.
The more obnoxious team serves first, so just
see which team has more Texans and let them
start. Serves are supposed to be tame, so just lob
the ball into the opposite side. Don't worry about
putting it"in," as long as it is playable by any
member of the opposing team, it's "in."
Of course, when the girl from Beverly Hills
throws together a lame and eventually unsuccess
ful attempt to play the ball, yelling "Oh my god,
that was so out!," laugh at her. When this girl then
tells you that you have "no chance with me
tonight," believe her. And when she says that "you
say '1 love you' too much," she's probably right. If
you are dating this girl, well then, you are me.
As soon as possible, finish your beer. Once you
have an empty beer can in your hand, casually
stroll up to someone on the other team that isn't
drinking enough. This person will not-so-coinci
dentally also be putting a little too much effort
into his performance. Throw your empty beer can
at him. If it hits him, he must drink. If you miss,
drink another! If you, in the process of throwing
your beer can, grip it on the sharp part of the
opening of the can, split your finger open and
bleed all over your t-shirt, you are, again, me.
Ask what the score is. If the other team tells
you that you are losing by more than five points,
vehemently and belligerently disagree. Haggle
your way down to a two-point deficit.
When they serve, make sure you set up your
return shot well. Remember, you are allowed un
limited hits per side, but only two consecutive hits
per individual player, so passing is key. Bump-set
spike is your best friend. Full baseball swings that
launch the tennis ball into court six are your worst
enemy and will increase tension in the already
tenuous detente you have going with your grad
school neighbors. By now, they know you aren't
Mormons.
But seriously, make sure you win the game.
Don't step on the discarded beer cans at your
feet; they are land mines and will lose the point
for your team. Do play dirty. Hitting other play
ers with your racquet is an excellent strategy. And
whatever you do, make sure you aim for the other
team's case of beer. If you hit it, the point is yours
and the other team must chug what they have.
So when you find yourself at 14-0 tonight,
needing one point to win the game, thank your
humble columnist and remember that rice is great
if you're hungry and you want to eat two thou
sand of something. Thanks, Mitch.

I have a beer in my hand, a smile on my
face and it's my serve. I call out "Moon
ball! and proceed to hit a forehand sky
high, as if testing the upper limits of my in
calculable strength. The ball is returned in
three hits, prompting my teammate to lunge
for the ball, deflecting it to me. I swing,
grunting as I hit my forehand, aiming fora
box on the baseline.
As the ball nears its target, 1 yell "Hit the
case! Hit it!" and sure enough, the ball
smacks the case of Keystone on the baseline,
prompting my team to erupt in cheers and
the other team to drown their misery in a
mandatory chug.
So you all play beer pong. Fine. You've
kicked a sloshball. Cool. Hell, some of you
might even play quarters, which is a true test

of skill. But none of you,
lest you be one of the 10 or
so people that have played
the game, have played the
greatest drunk sport of all
time. Yes, of all time. It is
called Drunk Tennis, and it
is going to change your life.
On a side note, Mitch
Hedberg died a few days
ago. He was one of my fa-

vorite comics and a true inspiration to many.
Drunk Tennis, I'm sure, is a sport he would
have supported 100 percent. For those of
you who have never heard of him, here's a
joke of his:
"My friend asked me if I wanted a frozen
banana and I said, 'No, but I want a regular
banana later, so, yeah!"'
