# Women drop Cal Poly, set for Bears
## 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On a day marked by seven
straight-set victories and a 7-0
shutout of Cal Poly, the top-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team (20-0,
11-0 Pacific-10 Conference) breezed
through a tune-up match yesterday
and has set its sights on tomorrow's
match against No. 21 California (11-
7,4-7).
Junior Alice Barnes and fresh
man Whitney Deason relinquished
just one game to their Mustang op
ponents, Chelsey Thompson and Ca
role Lee, at Nos. 2 and 4 singles, re
spectively.
Sophomores Theresa Logar and
Anne Yelsey also captured 6-0 sets in
the third and fifth singles positions,
respectively.
Thursday's quick win at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium brought the
Cardinal yet another step closer to
ending the regular season on a per
fect note.
With just one conference match
remaining, the Golden Bears are
well aware of Stanford's formidable
presence atop the player heap.
Rounding out 18 consecutive
years as the top Pac-10 team, the
Cardinal are familiarly poised to ran
kle the hearts and minds of one final
opponent before hunkering down
for the month-long stretch of prac
tice between now and the NCAA
Championships.
Since last year, Stanford has
racked up 49 consecutive wins.
Cal, meanwhile, under the guid
ance of seasoned head coach Jan
Brogan, will try to break its three
match losing streak and shake a sea
son of mixed results at Hellman Ten
nis Center at Berkeley.
Brogan, who has coached the Cal

ifornia squad since 1980, is just one
victory shy of her 500 th match win.
In those 25 years, Cal has appeared
at NCAAs 23 times and finished in
the nation's top 10 18 times.
The challenges of shaping a
young team — seven of 10 players
are freshmen — are reflected in
Cal's dip in the 2005 national stand
ings. This time last season, California
was ranked No. 10.
But to consider the dip a serious
cause for concern neglects the Gold
en Bears' recent 4-2 upset of No. 3
Northwestern.
To write Cal's youthfulness off as
a fatal Achilles' heel would be to ig
nore the stellar season of freshman
phenom Suzi Babos (30-6, 8-3), the
top player in the region and No. 4 in
the country.
While Stanford topped Cal 5-2 in
their meeting last month, Babos shut
down No. 9 junior Amber Liu, 7-5,6-
0.
Liu said she is prepared for an
other tough fight in the regular sea
son finale.
"It was good to have that 4-3
wake-up call against Southern Cali
fornia last weekend," Liu said. "I had
kind of a tough weekend, but I'm
[still] just working really hard. I
know that if you give it 100 percent,
you're inevitably going to gain more
confidence."
In their last meeting, Liu was ill
and Babos unstoppable.
But Liu and Babos both struggled
in sunny SoCal last week, dropping
to the Trojans' No. 10 Nicole Leim
bach and the Bruins' No. 25 Daniela
Bercek.
Liu held on to the first set in both
contests but lost the next two, while
Babos was blown away in straight

sets.
Leimbach allowed Babos just two
games, an unforgiving feat not even
Florida's No. 1 Megan Bradley (39-
1) could accomplish against Babos
last November at the elite ITA Na
tional Indoor Championship final.
"Before I hadn't played (Suzij for
a few years." Liu said. "Now that I've
seen her game, I know what to attack.
It's not just about her physical game,

it's [also] about seeking out a mental
weakness and playing to that."
Liu added: "It's when she takes
that first set that she really takes off.
I'm going to need to play smart all
the time."
On the doubles side, the tandem
of Liu and Yelsey (15-2, 10-1) has
risen to the top of the doubles lineup
as a result of senior Erin Burdette's
shoulder injury.
After defeating the No. 2 doubles
pairing of UCLA's Daniela Bercek
and Riza Zalameda last Saturday,
the No. 29 Stanford pair brings
added confidence to the table against
Cal's Stephanie Kusano and Babos.

Despite an unfavorable 9-11
record. Kusano and Babos pulled off
an 8-3 upset of No. 10 Barnes and
Burdette during the team's first
showdown.
Meanwhile, Liu and Yelsey
notched a perfect 8-0 win over Jessi
ca Shu and Marion Ravelojaona in
March.
"Even though we've been win
ning pretty easily, we have to make
sure not to overlook any team," Liu
said. "Everyone else plays their best
tennis against us because they have
nothing to lose."
Match play begins tomorrow at

weakness and playing to that."
Liu added: "It's when she takes
that first set that she really takes off.
I'm going to need to play smart all
the time."
On the doubles side, the tandem
of Liu and Yelsey (15-2, 10-1) has
risen to the top of the doubles lineup
as a result of senior Erin Burdette's
shoulder injury.
After defeating the No. 2 doubles
pairing of UCLA's Daniela Bercek
and Riza Zalameda last Saturday,
the No. 29 Stanford pair brings
added confidence to the table against
Cal's Stephanie Kusano and Babos.

Despite an unfavorable 9-11
record. Kusano and Babos pulled off
an 8-3 upset of No. 10 Barnes and
Burdette during the team's first
showdown.
Meanwhile, Liu and Yelsey
notched a perfect 8-0 win over Jessi
ca Shu and Marion Ravelojaona in
March.
"Even though we've been win
ning pretty easily, we have to make
sure not to overlook any team," Liu
said. "Everyone else plays their best
tennis against us because they have
nothing to lose."
Match play begins tomorrow at
noon.
On a day marked by seven
straight-set victories and a 7-0
shutout of Cal Poly, the top-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team (20-0,
11-0 Pacific-10 Conference) breezed
through a tune-up match yesterday
and has set its sights on tomorrow's
match against No. 21 California (11-
7,4-7).
Junior Alice Barnes and fresh
man Whitney Deason relinquished
just one game to their Mustang op
ponents, Chelsey Thompson and Ca
role Lee, at Nos. 2 and 4 singles, re
spectively.
Sophomores Theresa Logar and
Anne Yelsey also captured 6-0 sets in
the third and fifth singles positions,
respectively.
Thursday's quick win at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium brought the
Cardinal yet another step closer to
ending the regular season on a per
fect note.
With just one conference match
remaining, the Golden Bears are
well aware of Stanford's formidable
presence atop the player heap.
Rounding out 18 consecutive
years as the top Pac-10 team, the
Cardinal are familiarly poised to ran
kle the hearts and minds of one final
opponent before hunkering down
for the month-long stretch of prac
tice between now and the NCAA
Championships.
Since last year, Stanford has
racked up 49 consecutive wins.
Cal, meanwhile, under the guid
ance of seasoned head coach Jan
Brogan, will try to break its three
match losing streak and shake a sea
son of mixed results at Hellman Ten
nis Center at Berkeley.
Brogan, who has coached the Cal

ifornia squad since 1980, is just one
victory shy of her 500 th match win.
In those 25 years, Cal has appeared
at NCAAs 23 times and finished in
the nation's top 10 18 times.
The challenges of shaping a
young team — seven of 10 players
are freshmen — are reflected in
Cal's dip in the 2005 national stand
ings. This time last season, California
was ranked No. 10.
But to consider the dip a serious
cause for concern neglects the Gold
en Bears' recent 4-2 upset of No. 3
Northwestern.
To write Cal's youthfulness off as
a fatal Achilles' heel would be to ig
nore the stellar season of freshman
phenom Suzi Babos (30-6, 8-3), the
top player in the region and No. 4 in
the country.
While Stanford topped Cal 5-2 in
their meeting last month, Babos shut
down No. 9 junior Amber Liu, 7-5,6-
0.
Liu said she is prepared for an
other tough fight in the regular sea
son finale.
"It was good to have that 4-3
wake-up call against Southern Cali
fornia last weekend," Liu said. "I had
kind of a tough weekend, but I'm
[still] just working really hard. I
know that if you give it 100 percent,
you're inevitably going to gain more
confidence."
In their last meeting, Liu was ill
and Babos unstoppable.
But Liu and Babos both struggled
in sunny SoCal last week, dropping
to the Trojans' No. 10 Nicole Leim
bach and the Bruins' No. 25 Daniela
Bercek.
Liu held on to the first set in both
contests but lost the next two, while
Babos was blown away in straight

sets.
Leimbach allowed Babos just two
games, an unforgiving feat not even
Florida's No. 1 Megan Bradley (39-
1) could accomplish against Babos
last November at the elite ITA Na
tional Indoor Championship final.
"Before I hadn't played (Suzij for
a few years." Liu said. "Now that I've
seen her game, I know what to attack.
It's not just about her physical game,

it's [also] about seeking out a mental
weakness and playing to that."
Liu added: "It's when she takes
that first set that she really takes off.
I'm going to need to play smart all
