# Cardinal lacrosse bids two seniors farewell
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four years ago, the Stanford lacrosse
team was made up of mostly walk-ons — a
low-profile program in an East Coast dom
inated sport. This weekend, the Cardinal
will say goodbye to two women who have
since then helped to transform the team
into a national contender — senior mid
fielders Nina Pantano and Kelsey Twist.
On the field, both Twist and Pantano
have started for each of their 66 career
matches. Combined, the duo has earned
eight varsity letters, netted 207 career
scores and brought an off-the-field leader

with 97 career scores. "Sports have given
me lessons throughout my lifetime, such as
pushing myself out of my comfort zone and
challenging myself physically and mentally.
I've really grown as a person just from
working hard and setting goals for myself."

Although her classmates' lack of knowl
edge about lacrosse initially surprised
Twist, the Baltimore native looks back
fondly on her four years in a Cardinal uni
form.
"As an 18-year-old, moving from a place
where lacrosse is a way of life to a place
where people see a lacrosse stick and ask
what type of crazy contraption you're car
rying around was a culture shock," admit
ted Twist, whose 110 career tallies are
fourth all-time in Stanford's record book.
"However, playing with the players we
have on this team for the past four years has
