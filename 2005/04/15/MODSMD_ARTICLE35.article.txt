# Cardinal lacrosse bids two seniors farewell
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four years ago, the Stanford lacrosse
team was made up of mostly walk-ons — a
low-profile program in an East Coast dom
inated sport. This weekend, the Cardinal
will say goodbye to two women who have
since then helped to transform the team
into a national contender — senior mid
fielders Nina Pantano and Kelsey Twist.
On the field, both Twist and Pantano
have started for each of their 66 career
matches. Combined, the duo has earned
eight varsity letters, netted 207 career
scores and brought an off-the-field leader

ship that has proven invaluable to the bud
ding Stanford lacrosse program.
"Over the last four years, our team has
just grown tremendously in terms of our
toughness, both mentally and physically,"
Twist said. "This year, we are so willing and
ready to work really hard for big goals,
goals like winning the national champi
onship."
Pantano believes that Stanford's four
years of growth has altered the landscape of
collegiate women's lacrosse.
"Stanford has definitely been put on the
map since I've been here," Pantano said.
"The playing field has really been equal
ized. We're in the mix and we weren't be

fore. We're a force to he reckoned with
now."
While Pantano and Twist have both
helped develop Stanford lacrosse as a pro
gram. Stanford lacrosse has also helped the
two develop as people.
"My experience at Stanford has been so
much richer because of the relationships
with my teammates and my coaches," said
Pantano. who ranks fifth in school history
with 97 career scores. "Sports have given
me lessons throughout my lifetime, such as
pushing myself out of my comfort zone and
challenging myself physically and mentally.
I've really grown as a person just from
working hard and setting goals for myself."

Although her classmates' lack of knowl
edge about lacrosse initially surprised
Twist, the Baltimore native looks back
fondly on her four years in a Cardinal uni
form.
"As an 18-year-old, moving from a place
where lacrosse is a way of life to a place
where people see a lacrosse stick and ask
what type of crazy contraption you're car
rying around was a culture shock," admit
ted Twist, whose 110 career tallies are
fourth all-time in Stanford's record book.
"However, playing with the players we
have on this team for the past four years has
been a really excellent journey. Our team
has grown tremendously as lacrosse play
ers and as individuals over the past four
years."
After four years of so many memories
and successes, both the midfielders are al
ready dreading the day they finish their
playing days at Stanford. Pantano fears the
inherent joy of competition may prove ir
replaceable.
"I don't think I'm going to put lacrosse
down forever, but I don't think anything
can compare to the adrenaline rush from
competing in a game or from scoring a
goal," Pantano said. "I plan to still be in
volved in lacrosse. I want to coach and 1
foresee continuing a lot of the team as
pects, but 1 might never again have the rush
of competing and just fighting for the ball."
For Twist, leaving all her teammates
will be the toughest task.
"I will hands-down miss my teammates
the most," Twist said. "Just being able to
bond with these girls every single day has
become a major part of my life over the last
four years. I'm truly going to miss it."
However, perhaps more than the com
petition. perhaps more than the coaches or
even teammates of a year or two, each mid
fielder will ultimately miss her comple
mentary half, both on and off the field.
"Nina is just a fantastic teammate,"
Twist said. "She makes practice entertain
ing because she's hilarious, but also so in
tense because she's one of hardest workers
out there. As a player I have tremendous
respect for her, and as a person she's one of
my best friends."
Pantano feels much the same way about
Twist.
"Kelsey is really sweet," Pantano
added. "She's really a caring person and
loves to help anyone out. She's kind of silly
and she just makes me smile. She's just a
happy person. I've always felt an extra spe
cial connection with Kelsey because I
could tell we were both in it for the same
reasons. We're in it for the long haul and
we came to finish what we started."
Before they put down their "crazy con
traptions" for good. Twist and Pantano will
lead the Cardinal (7-5,4-0 Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation) in their last home
games this weekend, starting tonight at 7
p.m. against No. 19 Yale (5-5). Neither
Twist nor Pantano has ever lost a regular
season conference game, and that streak
will be on the line Sunday at 1 p.m., as Stan
ford concludes its MPSF regular season
against Denver (4-10,2-1 MPSF).
