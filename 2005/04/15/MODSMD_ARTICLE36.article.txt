# Track squad heads to Mt. SAC Relays
## 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tough competition is what drives
runners, sprinters, throwers, jumpers
and vaulters to break personal bests
and qualify for national meets. Lucki
ly, the Cardinal track and field team
will not have to go far this weekend to
find top-notch opponents. Starting
today, elite athletes from around the
world will gather in Walnut, Calif., for
the Mt. SAC Relays.
Junior discus thrower Michael
Robertson is ready for the challenge.
"I think it should go very well this
weekend," Robertson said. "It will be
the best competition I've been to in a
while. The number one thrower in the
world this year so far, Gerd Kanter,
will be there, and the top three discus
throwers from last year's Olympic tri
als will be there also."
Kanter hails from Estonia and cur
rently holds the year's best throw at
66.05 meters. Robertson's all-time
best of 64.90 meters was recorded last
year while he was attending Southern
Methodist. He has yet to reach that
mark this season.
"The season's going well," Robert
son said. "It started off slowly, but I
changed focus a little bit from last
year. I'm working real hard right now
to try to get the big distances later.
Things are coming along technically
little by little. I'm getting closer to a
good throw every week."
Last week at the UCLA meet,
Robertson threw the discus 59.59 me
ters, the third-best throw in Stanford
history.
"It was not a great throw," Robert
son said. "It was still off from my best
from last season by a bit."
Considering his experience with

high-level meets, though, including
the 2004 NCAA Championships and
U.S. Olympic Trials and the 2002
World Junior Championships,
Robertson should have no problem
dealing with the pressure from the
elite competition at Mt. SAC.
The middle distance and distance
men will also face a stellar pool of
competitors.
"There is a wide array of talent
from elite level world class to college
open athletes and everything in be
tween that," head men's coach Robert
Weir said. "It gives some of the ath
letes the opportunity to see world
class athletes in action, but at the same
time to be able to also participate. It is
really a competitive environment. It
will really help them in terms of get
ting qualifying performances for na
tionals."
Among the women's middle dis
tance and distance runners who will
compete this weekend are freshman
Lindsay Flacks, sophomores Teresa
McWalters and Ashley Freeman, ju
nior Anita Siraki and senior Sara Bei.
Two multi-events athletes, seniors
Nick Taylor and Ahimsa Hodari, have
already competed in the decathlon
and the heptathlon, respectively, at
the Azusa Pacific Multi-Events meet,
part of the Mt. SAC relays. Heading
into Thursday's action, Hodari and
Taylor were in sixth and ninth place,
respectively.
A few athletes will compete at Fri
day's Pomona-Pitzer Invitational in
Claremont, Calif., a smaller and less
competitive meet than the Mt. SAC
relays.
