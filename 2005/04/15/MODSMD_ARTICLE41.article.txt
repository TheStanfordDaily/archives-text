mitted out of a total of 20,194 appli
cations filed.

climb during the after-hours session
as traders anticipated the results of
the upcoming undergraduate trans
fer admission report.
"Everyone will be busy discount
ing fora strong transfer admission
cycle via more upticks in the coming
weeks," explained a senior college eq
uities analyst at Stanford Student En
teqirises. "We had high expectations
already that have now been con
firmed by the ('lass of 2009 report.
"In general, we're bullish on the
University," he added. "And prelimi
nary earnings estimates are looking
good, so this upward momentum

could continue well into the summer."

tures were pointing upward yester
day evening, with traders pricing in a

l ) 7 percent chance of stronger admis

elections results, with all undergrad
uate and joint applicant groups
being approved for fresh public
funding operations this coming fall.
"With increased regulatory
scrutiny on the part of the ASSU
and other bodies this past spring. 1
think a lot of people were worried
that some of these negotiated deals
wouldn't go through." said the vice
president of finance for the Stanford

Business Students Association. "But
those fears appear to have been un
warranted. which should provide a
nice boost to special-fees securities
over the next week or so as the
Street hashes all of this out."
The commodities markets re
mained largely unchanged, with
Jamba Juice smoothies by the 22-
ounce cup just touching $3.95 and
Treehouse Axe Burgers holding fast
at $4.75.

Points still at $1.10 and Cardinal
Dollars remaining at a 1:1 ratio with
the American dollar.
