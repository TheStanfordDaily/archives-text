## DON'T CATCH THIS 'FEVER' 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION SLUGGER 
When Ben (Jimmy Fallon), a hapless high
school geometry teacher, meets Lindsey (Drew
Barrvmore), a powerful careerwoman on the
fast-track to professional success, we know we
are getting set up. We've come to the theater for
a cute romantic comedy, we're waiting for the
boy meets girl moment, and the film hands it to
us with no hesitation.
However, not only is there no hesitation, but
there's no spunk, spark, wit or. dare 1 day it, orig
inality.That's where the real surprise comes in.
Based on the novel by Nick Hornby ("About a
Boy," "High Fidelity") and directed by Peter
and Bobby Farrelly, it would seem that "Fever
Pitch"

should be a
home run.

and Dumber" and "Shallow Hal" — what more
could a Hollywood exec ask for?
But while it makes reasonably good use of
stock sets and stock jokes, the film really doesn't
have anything new or fresh to offer up. Ben and
Lindsey begin their relationship with one goal in
mind — they need to be with someone. They
don't get together because one really likes the
other, but more out of desperation. Ben's con
cerned because Lindsey's a powerful career
woman. and Lindsey's concerned because Ben's a
school teacher, but in the interest of plot advance
ment. they get together anyway. And then the big
twist comes in: Ben's got a secret obsession.
In order to properly cash in on the recent suc
cess of the Boston Red Sox, "Fever Pitch" intro
duces Ben's character as the single most ob
sessed Sox fan in the history of baseball. Ben
sleeps in Red Sox pajamas on top of Red Sox
sheets — in a bedroom lined with Red Sox wall
paper. Calling him a "Red Sox fan" is like calling
Tiger Woods a "golfer."While Ben's Red Sox
fixation has been more than enough to send a
few girls running, Lindsey doesn't let it bother
her. That is, until Ben insists she rearrange her
schedule to attend every Red Sox game of the
season. That seems like a reasonable request.

right?
While Lindsey tries to he accommodating,
she can only go so far, and it's only a matter of
time before things come to a head.When we
reach this point in the film, things take a turn for
the melodramatic, but without any real tension

or anticipation. "Fever
Pitch" slips into a sort
of banality, which can
only come as a hearty
disappointment to Far
relly brothers fans.
With no sex jokes,
no gross-out humor
and no witty one-liners,
"Fever Pitch" is almost
completely devoid of
Farrelly flavor, and a
far cry from the broth
ers' "There's Some
thing About Mary."
"Fever Pitch" is disap
pointing because it
never seems to fully re
alize the potential of
the very likeable Fal
lon and Barrymore. It's

also missing the weird irreverence of the early
Farrelly films like "Me, Myself, and Irene." So if
the Hollywood execs were merely looking fora
way to make a buck on the Red Sox's first victo
ry in nearly a century, I have to ask. have the Sox
not suffered enough?


"I wasn't THAT bad on SNL, was I?"
