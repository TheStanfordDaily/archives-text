every geek, nerd, dork and fanboy can finally get

I rid of the awful taste that piss-poor director Joel
Shumacher left in their mouths with the travesty
that was Batman & Robin. With a stellar cast in

/ eluding Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Morgan

Murphy and Katie Holmes, the trailer gave us
II _x n _ J : ,_U /">it,;

Fuck Joel Shumacher on June 17.
