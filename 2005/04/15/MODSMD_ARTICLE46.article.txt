## Ram's Head's 'Company' comes on strong 
### JEN BEICHMAN INTERMISSION THEATRE CRITIC 
The Ram's Head Spring Musical
is no small thing on Stanford Cam
pus. As a genre, musical theater faces
the unenviable task of finding a sta
ble balance between occasionally
too-campy musical numbers and dia
logue that inevitably seems like filler.
Nothing can remove the tropes of
musical theater — as a director, you
can only embrace them and try to
make them work. And "Company"
does just that. It's well done musical
theater through and through — the

sopranos hit all the high
notes (with no
squeaks), the dance
numbers and the move
ment are choreo
graphed in such a way
that thev don't make it
difficult to understand
the lyrics and the pit or
chestra is perfect.
The performances
are all good, excellent
voices and excellent act
ing, hut Lisa Rowland
really steals the show.

First off. she has a
great character to
work with — the
cynical serial wife
Joanne. I found
myself waiting for
her to appear be
cause she nailed
her character
every time she
stepped onstage.
All the other ac
tors / characters
are excellent as
well, but mostly in
pairs or as a group.

The musical number
with Bobby's three
girlfriends, Cathy,
April, and Marta. is
better than any individ
ual girlfriend by her
self. In a musical all
about relationships (a
bit redundant, I know),
the dynamics of the
groups of characters
often matters more
than individual perfor
mances — and "Com
pany" does well to

draw its strength from those group
ings.
The set design is excellent and the
show is visually arresting. Perhaps
more impressively, "Company" actu
ally fills Memorial Auditorium, and
the huge stage never looks bare. The
set takes advantage of the stage's
height with three more levels above
the stage floor as well as a very real
flight of stairs (everyone's favorite set
piece). There's a frame in the back
with a perspective skyline of New
York City, and the frame acts as both
box for tableaus and as the stage's

backdrop. The clouds change from
scene to scene and. through an excel
lent use of lighting, simulate shifts in
time, mood and the season. The only
slight weakness in the overall produc
tion lies in its costume desigu.
Bv trying to combine the 1 l )70s set
ting of the play and the present, the
designer ends up with women who
look like they're pulled straight out of
the '70s and men who look like they
just walked in from the business
school.
T have only one caveat for the
prospective audience: "Company" is

highly distilled musical theater. At
times, it feels more like a revue of sev
eral sketches than a coherent show. It
has a non-linear plot line that requires
a lot of attention to put into a logical
order. Really, it breaks down into
scenes in full musical theater style (di
alogue that mysteriously segues into
song and dance), rather than a linear
story.
If you're the type of person who
occasionally puts up with the all the
song and dance in order to enjoy the
straightforward and farcical plots.
"Company" is probably not for you. If
you can enjoy a musical for its own
sake. well, you've probably already
seen the show. And if not. I bet I know
where you're headed tonight. Either
way. you'll be hard-pressed to find a
better example of musical theater on
campus.
Company, directed by Menitt For
rest Baer. is the Hum 's Head Spring
Musical. You can see it tonight, April
15, und tomorrow, April 76, at Bp.m.
in Memorial Auditorium. Tickets arc
available in White Plaza, at the door,
