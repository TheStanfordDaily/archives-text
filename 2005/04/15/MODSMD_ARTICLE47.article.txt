# Limit expenses and maximize your marginal jollies

### TAM VO INTERMISSION FINANCE GURU 
If living well is the best revenge,
living well for less is exponentially sat
isfying. Even if you aren't travel-sized
(and can therefore buy kids' clothing)
and require less fix>d and water (and
order off the kids' menu), there are
plenty of ways to cut corners and save
on expenses. Intermission does not
condone nor necessarily support the
less-ethical methods, we just wanted
to give you a full range of cost-effec
tive living options.
Good (.rub: You grab your 15
copies of the Stanford Directory and
10 more of the Unofficial Guide only
to find out half of them already have
the "Free Slice" coupons for Pizza My
Heart ripped out. Take advantage of
their standing deal fora slice of pizza
and a t-shirt for five bucks — always,
always order the most expensive slice
available. If you haven't already sub
scribed to free-food-alert@lists.stan
ford.edu. do so now.
If you are ridiculously spendthrift
but don't want to give the impression

that you're as cheap as George
Costanza, you may want to ditch your
ethics and save money the sneaky way.
Want to impress your date with a meal
from Spago but don't want to shell out
the bucks? Bring a worm or other eas
ily concealed equally undesirable par
tide and subtly place it on the plate of
noodles. You're going to hell, but
you'll get an 80 percent discount while
you're at it, including the senior citi
zens' one and the birthday discount!
Live in a dorm where people are
constantly ordering Domino's be
cause there's nothing to eat after the
dining halls close? Offer to pick up
their pizza for them in exchange fora
slice or two. Rearrange the remaining
pieces of the pie "artistically" in the
box to mask the white space. And for
anyone who has a friend with a Cost
co card, hit that up and make the
rounds for all the free samples of beef
jerky and bagel bites you could ever
want, washed down with tiny white
cups of cranberry-apple-grape juice.
A buck-50 will also get you a hot dog
and a refillable drink.
Locks for Less: Do yourself (and

us) a favor — get a haircut, kid. The
salon apprentices need a live head of
hair to refine their skills, and you've
got one. You don't have to do any
thing hut sit still. You won't walk out
with a faux-hawk unless you ask for
one, and the head stylists / teachers
are there to quality control. Juut

Fashion: Sell your clothes to Buf
falo Exchange and other secondhand
shops. Hell, round up the stray shirts,
pants, and garments in your laundry
room and sell them to the thrift
stores. Steal your roommate's while
you're at it, if you don't think they'll
object too strongly. Salvage clothes
that you're bored with by cutting
them up and incorporating them back
into your wardrobe. Don't forget,
ugly shoes make for great doorstops
and planters.

Come to think of it, Stanford sells
itself. Peddle your Stanford attire to
aspiring high-schoolers in the area, as
suring them "a REAL Stanford stu
dent wore this." Everyone loves
sports memorabilia, so head to \lir
rielees or ZAP to obtain some au
thentic Stanford athlete gear for re
sale. Your favorite shirt might just be
the new trim on an otherwise-blah
jacket. Don't forget, ugly shoes make
for great doorstops and planters.
Love clothes but can't afford them
off the rack in the stores? Don't pull a
Winona. Try them on to make sure
the sizes will fit you, and scrounge on
line for sites selling them at half
price. Hit up the outlets and look for
clothes that have minor rips and tears
that can be cheaply mended by a
seamstress. Chances are. you can
argue for 10 to 20 percent discounts.

Stanford Shopping Mall and looking
like everyone else, get graphic with

No More," they declare — don't
wash them when they get dirty, just

If living well is the best revenge,
living well for less is exponentially sat
isfying. Even if you aren't travel-sized
(and can therefore buy kids' clothing)
and require less fix>d and water (and
order off the kids' menu), there are
plenty of ways to cut corners and save
on expenses. Intermission does not
condone nor necessarily support the
less-ethical methods, we just wanted
to give you a full range of cost-effec
tive living options.
Good (.rub: You grab your 15
copies of the Stanford Directory and
10 more of the Unofficial Guide only
to find out half of them already have
the "Free Slice" coupons for Pizza My
Heart ripped out. Take advantage of
their standing deal fora slice of pizza
and a t-shirt for five bucks — always,
always order the most expensive slice
available. If you haven't already sub
scribed to free-food-alert@lists.stan
ford.edu. do so now.
If you are ridiculously spendthrift
but don't want to give the impression

that you're as cheap as George
Costanza, you may want to ditch your
ethics and save money the sneaky way.
Want to impress your date with a meal
from Spago but don't want to shell out
the bucks? Bring a worm or other eas
ily concealed equally undesirable par
tide and subtly place it on the plate of
noodles. You're going to hell, but
you'll get an 80 percent discount while
you're at it, including the senior citi
zens' one and the birthday discount!
Live in a dorm where people are
constantly ordering Domino's be
cause there's nothing to eat after the
dining halls close? Offer to pick up
their pizza for them in exchange fora
slice or two. Rearrange the remaining
pieces of the pie "artistically" in the
box to mask the white space. And for
anyone who has a friend with a Cost
co card, hit that up and make the
rounds for all the free samples of beef
jerky and bagel bites you could ever
want, washed down with tiny white
cups of cranberry-apple-grape juice.
A buck-50 will also get you a hot dog
and a refillable drink.
Locks for Less: Do yourself (and

us) a favor — get a haircut, kid. The
salon apprentices need a live head of
hair to refine their skills, and you've
got one. You don't have to do any
thing hut sit still. You won't walk out
with a faux-hawk unless you ask for
one, and the head stylists / teachers
are there to quality control. Juut
Salon on University Avenue. Jaxx on
El Camino and Rocket Salon are a
few of the more "upscale" places that
won't butcher you. Make the trek out
to Campbell and Faux Salon will be
happy to have you on Tuesday nights
at 6. Call them up and volunteer to be
a hair model, it won't cost you any
thing— just be sure to tip generously
if you're especially pleased.

gems such as "(insert generic movie
