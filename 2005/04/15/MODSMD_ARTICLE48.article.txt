## Beck CD revists old territory but still worth the listen 
### MIKE ORME INTERMISSION MUSIC CONNOISSEUR 
About three years ago, back when I was still
ii student at Stanford, 1 was asked to write a re
view of Beck's 2002 opus. "Sea Change." This
was my first review and I don't remember it very
well, but 1 do remember committing the cardinal
Beck sin of referring to him as "the 'Loser'"
somewhere in the first draft — how cliche! But
in that rather messy first effort, I began to better
understand Beck's artistic evolution and eager
!\ aw aited the fruits of his continued maturation.
And here I am. I've finished college and am
now out in the "real world." And once again.
I've been asked to review the new Beck album,
tins time 2005's "Guero." I admit I've written
the last hundred or so words with the aim of
cleverly comparing my maturation with Beck's,
but you know, I realize I can't really do that be
cause while 1 like where I've gone in three
years. I don't know if I condone Beck's new di
rection.
First off. there is no new direction. On
"Guero." Beck has chosen to retread old ideas
a puzzling decision from an artist whose
heady genre studies never looked back, calling
to mind a veritable Rolodex of '70s music icons.
On "Mellow Gold" and "Odelay," Beck slowly
morphed from Bob Dylan into George Clinton.
On "Mutations," Beck became bossa-nova star
Joao Gilberto. On "Midnite Vultures," Beck
stepped into Prince's golden codpiece. And for

"Sea Change," he revealed matured vocal and
songwriting abilities reminiscent of Nick Drake.
And let's not forget. Beck accomplished his mul
tiple-personality progression with the ease
shown by few artists since the original musical
chameleon, David Bowie.

For perhaps the first time.
Beck manages to integrate his
previous genre experiments
seamlessly — and I find it diffi
cult not to call "Guero" a suc
cess, as there are some really nice
moments. Highlights include "F.-
Pro," the album's first single and
a natural successor to "Devil's
Haircut," and "Summer Girl,"
an amalgam of 8-bit synths,
sunny pop and blues that actual
ly feels (for better or for worse) a
bit like "Hev Ya!" "Missing" and
"Earthquake Weather" are both

lovely ballads in which bossa-nova gui
tar and electronic beats live peacefully.
But to say the album is good based
merely on these qualities is a teleologi
cal copout: "It's good because it's
Beck." Given this, I will try to explain
why I give "Guero" a full star less than
much of the album deserves.
As with "Guero," a lot of Beck's
previous albums sounded dated, but
only on "Guero" does it really affect

the listenability, The difference here is that the
quality of tl»c songs is a Tittle too sketchy to qual
ify "Guero" a quality genre experiment. Beck
can get away with white-boy funk all over "Mid
nite Vultures" because, well, "Sexx Laws" and
"Nicotine & Gravy" and "Mixed Bizness" and
"Debra" kick ass. But the 10-fi hip-hop that

'Guero'
Beck

makes up almost half of
the album largely falls
flat, perhaps because the
songs :*ouiid too mid
ninetios, too cookie<ut
ter to make an impact
today. Perhaps Beck
should have learned
from the Beastie Boys'
latest release that if he
can't write hits in the
genre, perhaps he should
leave behind the four
tracks and Casios.

As I remember, in
my "Sea Change" review I said I
would accept the "grown up"
Beck on the condition that I could
have the "Midnite Vultures"-era
Prince-in-a-sequined-thong Beck
for the next album, but now that 1
have "Guero." I don't know what
to think. I really shouldn't com
plain about the album where
Beck has the maturity to revisit,
even reinvent, his past personali-

ties, but I suppose I wanted more youthful en
ergy and less filler thrown into the mix. Maybe
the ship has sailed on what l.want from Beck
and I should try to be happy with what really is
a wonderful, mature record. After all. Losers do
grow up someday — and Prince is now a Jeho
vah's Witness.


Do I look like Ctavid Spade? No. No No. No. No No.
