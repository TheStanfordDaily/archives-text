# Hot Hot Heat’s new release 'Elevator’ only luke-warm
## 
### DREW PETERSON INTERMISION 
I lining frolicked the lands of the
world, I think I can say that I really
like Canadian things. Age eight with
my family was my first trip to Cana
da. and I remember the experience
most by the French-speakers instinc
tively taking me as one of their own.
In high school 1 made rowing trips up
to the Canadian waters for regattas,
with crowds filled with rows of plaid
boarding school uniforms. My histo
ry class senior year took a field trip to

the excitement, culture, and funny accents of
( anada. 1 have never encountered anyone as
ridiculously pleasant as these neighbors up
north.
"Elevator," the new album from Canadian
sensation Hot Hot Heat, is no exception.
When I learned last week about Hot Hot
Heat's free Amoeba show. I'm not embar
rassed to say that I skipped down the hallway,
waiting for my neighbors to offer me a ride to

'Elevator'
Hot Hot Heat

the city. But 1 was
in fora major let
down. It seems
that more than a
few Stanford Stu
dents won't admit
to liking this Vic
toria. B.C. band
(it's either that or
they really don't
like the band,
which I find highly
unlikely). Closed
door after closed
door. I discovered

that 110 one would he head
ing to the show. Or. might I
add. even wanted to.
I'll admit — as
you've probably guessed
from my recent coming out
to liking all things Canadi
an — that I'm a big fan of
the band's 2002 hit album.
"Makeup the Break-

down.** 1 also really like cheap music shows. You
have to understand that Friday's performance
was going got be like the next big San Francisco
earthquake, except good.
And so you understand my initial disap
pointment \*ith Hot Hot Heat's newest album.
"Elevator." On "Makeup the Breakdown." the ut-

terly addictive
pop-punk tracks
were marred
only by the awful
lyrics. Unfortu
nately. "Eleva
tor" doesn't
make much of
an improve
ment in this
area. At discov
ering how horri
ble their lyrics
are, in fact, the

band released a lyrics sheet with the CD that
lists the songs in reverse order.
I wish this were something more extricable
from the overall message of Hot Hot Heat,

but little things get to me. The quality of the
album'gfMPhowever, allows me to grant
the albinWßnwwst one exception this time.The
pop-punk sound that the album serves up is
something Hot Hot Heat replicated if not im
proved upon from "Makeup the Breakdown,"
even after losing a guitarist in the process. Let
me warn all prospective listeners that "Eleva
tor" is most definitely a powerful punky pop
hybrid.
If you want to sit on a roof, throw on your
headphones, follow along with liner notes,
and extract deep meaning from lyrics. Hot
Hot Heat is just about as far as you could get
from a good idea. But that's not the kind of
band they are — and when it comes down to it,
that's not type of band they should be. In
stead. "Elevator" is the type of album you
grab aj<>ng vyith your spray can and skate-
background music to your
newesn|t>R?rasf|pus escapade. Or better yet, go
find the rooms of all those
didp't want to take me to San
FranciMplSßßpusly. You have my permission



Yeah il was really cool to dress in
shirts and lies . . . back when
Nirvana did it in 1992.
