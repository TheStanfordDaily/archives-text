# Roxy's Tax Day Ramblings: Get a Job!
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS, ENTREPRENEUR 
Ahhh, Tax Day. Yep. it's April
15th. and it'you haven't sent in your
tax returns yet, you'd better be on
your way to Monaco or the Cayman
Islands. Roxy knows how you feel,
she hates taxes too. But a girl's
gotta work, so 1 thought about some
professions that are pretty hard for

the government to tax.
Last night, as 1 was filling
out my W-2 and dreaming
about how much I'd rather
be getting filled with the

love of some sexy ac
countant, I asked my-

self, "Why am

forking over my
money to The
Man?" A man
should be giving me

money. Ladies, you
all know it's true.

You come home from a
long day of class and

then head right back
out. in a short skirt and
Uees, just to make 20

bucks . . . the hard way. Don't
worry, there's nothing wrong with a
little "secondary income," but I say
forget dinner and a movie, just give
me the money. There has to be an
easier way to make cash.,
So here's one that everyone can
enjoy. Become a bona fide sex con
sultant! This time of year, tax con
sultants are raking in the dough left
and right. "We'll get you a refund!"
their advertisements decfare. Re
fund? Roxy will get you an orgasm.
If you doubt Stanford could be a vi
able marketplace for sex consul
tants, think again. Watching "Fam
ily Guy." having sex missionary
style and then falling asleep can
only be interesting for oh so long.
That's where the sex consultant
comes in. All it takes is a little imag

ination. People will pay you to put
your head in the gutter and pull out
ideas their heads will never forget.
Don't trust your skills in giving
advice to the sexless masses at Stan
ford? Be a rap-video background
danger! I've watched "BET Uncut"
and there's a seemingly endless
supply of dancers who are willing to
"shake what their mama gave
them." The best part about being a
dancer is that in those videos,

money Calls from the sky. Yoa

don't even need a contract.
Just pick some Benjamins

up off the floor when the
shoot is done. Uncle Sam
will be none the wiser.

Guys, I know

you're probably feel
ing left out, seeing as
most rappers fea-

112 r ~-
ture sexy ladies in
their videos. Roxy

' suggests you start getting
paid for something you al
ready do for free. You

guessed it, be a sperm
donor! Forget the Califor
nia Cryobank. With a name

like that, they most likely have lots
of paperwork and background
checks. I'm talking about private
arrangements. You know, like that
desperate 39-year-old woman who
put that ad in The Daily back in
2002. Sure she had some pretty
tough specifications, but she of
fered 25 grand. 25 grand for some
man-juice. Wow.
If all else fails, try Internet porn.
This doesn't really need an expla
nation. Just head to the San Fer
nando Valley and tell the MILF
Hunter that Roxy sent you.
With all this new-found advice,
Roxy wishes everyone the best of
luck in their new professions. As
Robin Leach would say, may all
your wishes be champagne, dreams
be caviar and showers be golden!
