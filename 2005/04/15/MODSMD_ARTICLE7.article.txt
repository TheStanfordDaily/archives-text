# Card travel to Oregon for shot at No. 10 Beavers
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
What does it mean that No. 8 Stanford Softball is cur
rently fourth in the conference standings? Not much. The
very fact that the Cardinal are in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence says it all.
For the first time this season, all eight teams in the con
ference are ranked in the top 25 and half of them are in the
top 10. Oregon State, the only undefeated team in confer
ence play, is No. 10, while the team at the bottom of the
league standings, Arizona State, is No. 21. The No. 2 and
No. 3 teams in the country, Arizona and California, sit in
the middle of the conference standings.
When head coach John Rittman says that rankings
within the conference are irrelevant, he means it.
Stanford (28-7, 3-2) is heading into a road series in
Oregon this weekend, where the team will have the op
portunity to hand the conference leader its first loss in
months.
Tomorrow the Cardinal will take the field with No. 10
Oregon State (28-6, 7-0), which is riding a school record
22-game winning streak dating back to late February.
With a perfect start to the conference season, the Beavers
have already matched their win total from last season,
when the team finished 7-14 in Pac-10 play.
Oregon State's success depends heavily on the arm of
sophomore hurler Brianne McGowan (25-2), who has
garnered three of the last four conference Pitcher of the
Week awards and was recently named USA Softball Na
tional Collegiate Player of the Week. An imposing figure
at 6-foot-2, McGowan has already pitched a staggering 32
games, including 19 complete-game victories.
"She's a sophomore who's improved dramatically in
her first year and 3/4 at Oregon State," Rittman said.
"With McGowan we're going to have to lake a lot of
pilches, be patient with her and try to get people on base."
The rest of the Beavers' pitching staff has seen little ac
tion, combining for three wins and four losses. With a
chance to pass the Cardinal in the national rankings on the
line, it is a safe assumption that McGowan will be in the
circle tomorrow night.
Last weekend she pitched a complete-game shutout in
an upset victory over No. 2 Arizona and brought the
Beavers into the lop 10. She has registered a 1.71 ERA
with 194 strikeouts, while giving up only 144 hits in 180 in
nings this season.
McGowan is the rare pitcher who can hurl with the
best of them and is also a force with the bat. She has hit
more home runs (his season (8) than she has given up in
the circle (7). Her 23 RBI rank second on the team behind
leader Adrienne Alo's 24.
Junior Vanessa lapala has been dominant in confer

ence play, leading the Beavers with a .571 batting aver
age. She was named to the preseason watch list for USA
Softball Collegiate Player of the Year honors, joining
Stanford junior shortstop Lauren Lappin and sophomore
outfielder Jackie Rinehart on the 40-person list. Of the
three of them, only Lappin made the cut as one of 25 fi
nalists.
Stanford is 25-11 all-time against the Beavers and
swept the season series last year.
"OSU is on a good roll right now," Rittman said.
"They're playing good defense. McGowan's pitching well
and she's getting run support, which is huge."
After facing Oregon State, Stanford will travel to Eu
gene to take on No. 25 Oregon (23-13,3-4) in a two-game

series. Oregon was the last Pac-1()
team to break into the top 25, but
the Ducks sit only one place be
hind in the conference standings.
Oregon leads the conference in
sacrifice bunts, a strategy that
Stanford saw in its non-confer
ence game against San Jose State
last week, a 2-0 Cardinal victory.
Stanford's tough pitching and
alert infield play effectively neu
tralized the Spartan offense.
Shortstop Breanne Sabol is the
team's leading hunter with 13 sac
rifices, and she also leads the team
with a .345 batting average.
Sabol's offense has been key this
season, with the Ducks winning
every game in which she has tal
lied an RBI.
Freshman Lovena Chaput, a
recent conference Player of the
Week, leads the team with four
home runs and a .555 slugging per
centage.
Oregon holds a slim 16-14 ad
vantage all-time against Stanford
and won the best-of-three series in
each of the last two years.
"Oregon is a team that's al
ways scrappy," Rittman said.

"Their number one pitcher, Ani Nyhus from the Canadi
an national team, has been hurt, but they have some un
derclassmen who have done a good job taking over for
their injured star. They have good defense — they lead
the conference in executing double plays. They play a
good short game and they can move runners. They're
going to play us tough in both of these contests. It should
be a good challenge for us.

Sophomore Jackie Rinehart and the No. 8 Cardinal will go up against one of the toughest pitchers in the na
tion in Oregon State's Brianne McGowan. The Beavers are 7-0 in Pac-10 play.
