# No. 14 Stanford heads to desert to face Sun Devils
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
I lie Nit. 14 Stanford baseball team (19-11,4-2 Pacific-10 Conference) will find itself in un
lamiliar territor\ when il travels to Tempe. Ari/.. to face Arizona State (22-15. 3-3) this
weekend.
In recent years, the two teams have been the behemoths of the Pac-10. and their
matchups have often been dogfights for first place. But this season, both are mired in the
middle of the Fac-Kl standings and both are coming off recent series losses. The Cardinal
dropped two to Oregon State last weekend, while the Sun Devils suffered the same fate at the
hands of ('alilornia.
Bui the fact that the teams are a couple games out of first only raises the stakes. A sweep
b\ either team could sink the other's Pac-10 title hopes.

"We deliniteK want to stay afloat in the Pac-10 early and give ourselves a chance to win it
later." junior ace Mark Romanczuk said. "We have to at least take two out of three this
week, or get a sweep."

The Cardinal will rely on Romanczuk and the rest of (lie pitching staff to shut
down the Sun Devils' offense, the second-most prolific in the Pac-10. led by Jeff Lar
ish and his 13 homers. Bui with the closer and third starter positions up in the air. the
Cardinal staff is still trying to find a measure of consistency. It got roughed up in last
Saturday's doubleheader. allowing 23 runs over three games and blowing two
saves.

The Cardinal's two most reliable starters. Romanczuk and Saturday
starter Jeff Gilmore. had sub-par outings. Romanczuk allowed seven runs (five
earned) in 7 1/3 innings and Gilmore surrendered seven runs in four innings to
a talented Oregon State offense. The fact that they have experience with the
ups and downs of a college baseball season makes them more prepared to
lead the Cardinal staff in a time of uncertainty.
"When things aren't going as well for us collectively, I think guys can
turn to Jeff and me because we've been through it before," Romanczuk
said. "We understand what it's like to have a bad start or have a couple
had outings in a row. We've been through that.
"1 think it's going to take time. But I think it will help us down
the road when we do come into some tight games. We know what it's
like to lose, at least, and we ll have to earn it down the road."
L Gilmore said that the Cardinal's stable of raw talent down in
the bullpen still has to be given time to develop.

"Our younger pitchers happen to have a lot of talent," he said.
"And we teel very responsible for molding the raw stuff that [fresh
men] Nolan Gallagher and Erik Davis and the sophomores pos
sess. We feel responsible for molding them into mental com
petitors."
The younger pitchers on the Cardinal stall have all

Ihe physical tools to be upper-echelon pitchers, but the
adjustment from starting in high school to relieving in
college can be daunting. Gallagher— a dark-horse
candidate for the closer's role — has handled the
transition well, posting a 3.62 FRA. and Davis has
pitched well in his starts on Tuesday games.
The two persistent questions that have been
asked all year about the stall are which players will
step into the closer and third starter roles. The clos
er role seems to be more important in the Major
Leagues than it is in NCAA ball, and it's still uncer
tain whether the team will have one closer or a mul
tiple number of players who fill that role.
Romanczuk believes that, come playoff
time, the team will need a lire-tested closer to shut
down the other team in tight games.

"Both doubleheader games, we
were up," Romanczuk said. "If we
have a go-to closer, we sweep Ore
gon State."
Gilmore believes that the team
will more likely stick by its current
closer-by-committee system.
"There isn't going to be one clos
er," he said. "There isn't going to be

one setup man. The closer as an en
tity is not as important as that group
of guys keeping us in the ballgame,
late in the game."
Sophomore Blake Holler, 6-1
with a 2.53 ERA. and junior Matt
Manship, who hasn't allowed a run
in 12 innings this season, have occu
pied that role so far this season.
Sophomore Matt Leva, mean
while, has looked strong in the third
starter role, posting a 3.4K ERA over
31 innings.
But the team has a lot of options,
and that's never a had thing.

"I think our depth is probably our
strongest asset right now, and I think
that slowly guys are discovering
roles, and the coaches are putting
guys in certain roles ... the final
product hasn't really been formed
yet, but I think that over the next
week or two it will be. and we'll go
from there."
The staff will continue to search
for an answer to its pitching ques
tions this weekend against the Sun
Devils. The games on Friday and Sat
urday will begin at 6:30 p.m. and Sun
day's contest will kick off at 1 p.m.
