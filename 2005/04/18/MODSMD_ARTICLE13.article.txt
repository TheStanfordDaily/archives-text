On April IN, 1979, The Daily report
ed that Stanford has a low suicide rate
among universities despite rising
rates nationwide. Below is an excerpt:
"Suicide is the third leading cause
of death among college students.
Throughout the country suicide
rates for people aged 20 to 24 have
jumped from 5.6 per 100,000 in 1955
to 16.5 per 100,000 in 1975.
"According to Dr. David
Dorosin, director of Counseling and
Psychological services, the Stanford
community has averaged one suicide
a year during the past ten years. UC-
Berkeley shows a similar figure. Ac
cording to Sgt. Gordon Smith of the
University of California Police Ser
vices, Berkeley's suicide rate has de
creased from 5 to 3 a year over the

past few years to none last year. In
comparison Cornell University in
New York hit a peak of eight sui
cides two years ago. However ac
cording to Lt. Jay McGinnis of Cor
nell University police, there has yet
to be a suicide committed on that
campus this year.
" 'We attract a group of people
who have a high expectancy of them
selves and often we are faced with
disappointment,' Dorosin said. This
is supported by an Academic Coun
cil of Education survey performed
on Stanford freshmen. Survey re
sults show that 25 percent of fresh
men here expect to graduate with
honors compared to the national av
erage of 14 percent. In addition, 74
percent expect to graduate with a B
average or better compared to the

national average of 50 percent.
"Housing authorities recognize
the problem of suicide on campus
and have taken some steps to com
bat the situation. House associations
(RAs) are encouraged to see the
film, 'College Can be Killing,' made
by Chicago Public Television, Sem
inars are also offered to residence
staffs on dealing with suicide among
students."
On April 18, 1933, The Daily pub
lished a story previewing the annual
"Water Fete" to be held at Lake Lag.
Below is an excerpt:
"Returning to Lagunita after a
five-year absence, the Junior Water
Carnival, an All-University event,
will feature a grand regatta and
aquatic sports Friday.
"Their Aquatic Majesties, the
King and Queen of the festival, will
lead the procession across the lake in
their royal barges. The leaders will
be followed by every water-going
craft on or around Lagunita, some
thirty canoes, to present a spectacle
of color and interest.
"The afternoon will be one of un
ending interest, for Dan Ellis, chair
man of the carnival committee, has
announced an added number of
novel jousts such as canoe-tilting
and a tug of water.
