# Water in the Milk Bottle
## I am awesome; hire me

I am pretty much oblivious to the
passage of time. I usually skip
breakfast and lunch because by the
time I look at the clock, I'm already
late for class at 1:15 p.m. Later, I go
to TresEx and roam the aisles, mak
ing my selection only when I am late
for my next class, or when that one
lady eyes me suspiciously and asks
me — for the third time — if she can
help me find something.
I tend to take things as they
come, regardless of the issue. For in
stance, now that everyone else has
their summer plans in place and
nearly all the internship deadlines
have passed, I'm suddenly aware
that I need a summer job.
About a week ago, 1 started
searching my desktop for the old re
sume. Apparently I had deleted it.
Unfazed, I wrote another one, al
though I've since forgotten what ex
actly my responsibilities were on
previous jobs, and added a generic
cover letter.

Both compositions
lacked a certain luster.
I've done some re
search and tutoring —
informal things — hut
1 have yet to hold a
"real job." The re
sume-padding was
thin. Nonetheless, 1
thought the situation

could be improved by taking the re
sume and letter out to get a little
criticism.
First, 1 sent it them to Mod, a wise
and practical woman who is actually
employed. She responded with sev
eral edits.
"My skills might be a good fit," 1
had written.
"My skills ARE an EXCEL
LENT fit," she corrected.
I made the changes, but the result
seemed too obviously exaggerated.
1 confess 1 doubted Mod and her
practical wisdom. I packed up my
papers and headed out to see the
pros at the Career Development
Center.
Here I should mention that 1
have a gap. After 1 got the 8.5., 1 sat
on my ass for two years and watched
TV. (It sounds fun now, but it will
come back to bite you. Trust me.) 1
asked the career counselor how to
explain what I was doing during the
gap
"Well," she said, reasonably.
"What were you doing?"
"Urn," I said. "I was 17. I hung
out and watched TV."
The counselor flashed a pity
smile for my stupidity.
"You can't say that." she told me.
"Look, you tutored your neighbor's
kid for two hours a week and visited
your grandmother in Taiwan? Just
say you taught math and traveled."
By the time I left, I had gone
from a sometime performer of odd
jobs to a former project manager
with excellent written communica
tion skills and worldly experience.
In the past, 1 claimed larger
things. I have claimed to be brilliant,
a genius and a magical animorph
with the ability to fly. But these ob
vious falsehoods were designed sim
ply to bolster my ego to its current
ginormoussize. 1 have never exalted
myself with an intent to deceive.
Reading my new work history. I
was pained with a natural sense of
shame. But gradually, I developed a
flush of pride in the sudden explo
sion of my accomplishments.
Whereas I was once resigned to a
life as various forms of coffee-mak
ing peon, my higher aspirations now
seem within my hyperbolic reach.
Selling myself in interviews, of
course, will be another problem.
Fortunately, paranoia trumps pro
crastination, so for once I've
thought ahead. I am working hard to
Hatter myself into actually believing
what I've written down. That gets
me around embarrassment and
should bring new confidence to my
employment-seeking shtick.
I know they say the truth will
come out. but who's going to call me
on my resume? My ten-year-old
neighbor-tutee? I'll kick her tiny
ass. After all, I went to Kung Fu
practice about a dozen times in the
spring of 2(X)1. If that were on my re
sume, I could kick the ass of
Muhammad Ali.

I'm sure you have enjoyed reading my
awesome, brilliant, ass-kicking,
award-winning piece of column-writ
ing genius. I mean, my best-selling
book on job hunting. E-mail praise
for the author to igliu@stanford.edu.
She will respond in person until she
gets too damn busy. With a resume
like that, she'll be very much in de
mand.
