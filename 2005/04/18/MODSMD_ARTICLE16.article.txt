### COURTNEY WEAVER STAFF WRITER 
Let's be honest, I'm pretty badass.
Though don't have any tattoos, rocker boyfriends or mug
shots to date, I bend the rules in my own sort of way. I skip the
occasional I-Hum lecture and bike on the sidewalks. I've even
said the word "sex" on national television. So when the founder
of the Stanford Motorcycle Club picked me up for our interview
on the "Cadillac of Motorcycles," I have to say I wasn't blown
away at the proposition.
My dreams of joining Hell's Angels with my hair blowing
wildly in the wind were further thwarted by an oversized hel
met. But in true journalistic fashion, I chivalrously put my rebel
rousing tendencies aside for one ride and realized that, sports
bike or not, I was the closest to a Biker Babe that I was ever
going to get.
Unfortunately, my biker image trailed far behind that of my
driver's, Chris Pumo, co-term by day and biker by lunch breaks.
Pumo's leather jacket and ripped jeans proved his slight edge on
the coolness factor. Also, while I was only trailing along for one
Sunday afternoon ride, Pumo can be credited as the founder of
the Stanford Motorcycle Club.
Pumo started the organization about a month and a half ago
as a way to organize a forum for all of the area's bikers. Fed up
with having to travel to San Jose fora group ride, he posted fly
ers near motorcycle parking spaces and on parked motorcycles
around campus. He received a surge of responses, and thanks to
the resurrection of an old motorcycle Stanford e-mail list and
word-of-mouth. the club has grown in size to about 30 people.
Members range from senior Robby Ratan. who bought his
first motorcycle from eßay three months ago, to 51-year-old
Craig Haggart, a Stanford Linear Accelerator Center staff
member, who has been riding motorcycles for more than 35
years.
Pumo bought his first bike, a 1980 Kawasaki, three years
ago. Since then, the Kawasaki has had two successors. Pumo is
now working on putting together a 1970 Harley Davidson,
which he bought last summer disassembled in cardboard boxes
— and without a frame.
After reading how-to books and talking to mechanics, Pumo
said he has been able to complete roughly 60 percent of the job
and hopes to finish it entirely by this summer.
"It's like a giant Lego set for adults, only a little more com
plicated," Pumo said.
While Pumo's parents initially disapproved of his first mo
torcycle purchase, his dad has since come around, though Pumo
says that his mother is still a little more hesitant.
"1 don't know if anyone's mom would love them riding a mo
torcycle," he said.
That said, however, members hardly go on their share of joy
rides.
Weekly meetings are Fridays at 11:30 a.m. at the Stanford
Driving Range Parking Lot. where the group meets to ride up
to Alice's, on the corner of Skyline and Highway 84. for lunch.
On the weekends, members will sometimes take a longer ride,
such as the one planned fora Half-Moon Bay mechanic show
next Sunday.
In the future, Pumo hopes to plan an overnight for the group,
and he is thinking about trying to make the club officially Stan
ford-affiliated in order to increase publicity. However, the lat
ter is not a huge priority for Pumo.
"I'm not so interested in [making it official]." he said. "I'm
more interested in Stanford riders getting together and being
able to go fora ride at a moment's notice."
For club members such as Haggart. biking gives new mean
ing to the word passion.
"Riding a motorcycle on a twisty road is sort of a combination
of riding a horse and dancing," Haggart said. "There's a won
derful fluidity about the skill it takes to do it well, and the ma
chine both responds to your input and moves in a certain way on
its own. Even a mild' motorcycle has an incredible power-to
weight ratio, so the response can be incredibly exhilarating."
Ratan. who just bought his bike last year, also expressed his
enthusiasm for the sport.

"In my first month I put over 1,000 miles
on the bike just cruising around the foothills."
he said.
In his second month, he was less lucky.
"1 crashed because I hit some gravel while going
around a blind turn." Ratan said. "Luckily it wasn't
too bad. and 1 learned an important lesson about rider
attitude: Never ride in a rush."
Ratan's fall is the only one to date for the club.
"I guess accidents happen " Pumo said. "Motorcycling is
not badminton."
He noted that group traveling, in addition to being more fun,
is also safer.
"Safety is a really important thing to me," Pumo said. "I try
to make all club rides, safe rides."
Pumo said that the club keeps the group pace to the slowest
or least experienced member. Other club members agreed this
was a good tactic.

To me, it's not so much about going fast in an absolute
sense, but going fast in a relative sense," Haggart said.
"That is, anyone can go 135 m.p.h. in a straight line on a
modern motorcycle; the fun — and.in my opinion, the
real skill — comes from going 30 or 40 in a corner
where you would normally do 20 or 25."
Ratan agreed that absolute speed is not his
favorite aspect of riding.
"The thing 1 love most about riding is that
you are really part of the landscape — you
feel the air temperature and smell the
trees — as opposed to a car. where you
are a passive observer through a win
dow," Ratan said.
Ratan pointed out that
there was an ever further perk
of the job: "Chicks dig guys
with bikes."

Driving Range Parking Lot. where the group meets to ride up
to Alice's, on the corner of Skyline and Highway 84. for lunch.
On the weekends, members will sometimes take a longer ride,
such as the one planned fora Half-Moon Bay mechanic show
next Sunday.
In the future, Pumo hopes to plan an overnight for the group,
and he is thinking about trying to make the club officially Stan
ford-affiliated in order to increase publicity. However, the lat
ter is not a huge priority for Pumo.
"I'm not so interested in [making it official]." he said. "I'm
more interested in Stanford riders getting together and being
able to go fora ride at a moment's notice."
For club members such as Haggart. biking gives new mean
ing to the word passion.
"Riding a motorcycle on a twisty road is sort of a combination
of riding a horse and dancing," Haggart said. "There's a won
derful fluidity about the skill it takes to do it well, and the ma
chine both responds to your input and moves in a certain way on
its own. Even a mild' motorcycle has an incredible power-to
weight ratio, so the response can be incredibly exhilarating."
Ratan. who just bought his bike last year, also expressed his
enthusiasm for the sport.

"In my first month I put over 1,000 miles
on the bike just cruising around the foothills."
he said.
In his second month, he was less lucky.
"1 crashed because I hit some gravel while going
around a blind turn." Ratan said. "Luckily it wasn't
too bad. and 1 learned an important lesson about rider
attitude: Never ride in a rush."
Ratan's fall is the only one to date for the club.
"I guess accidents happen " Pumo said. "Motorcycling is
not badminton."
He noted that group traveling, in addition to being more fun,
is also safer.
"Safety is a really important thing to me," Pumo said. "I try
to make all club rides, safe rides."
Pumo said that the club keeps the group pace to the slowest
or least experienced member. Other club members agreed this
was a good tactic.

To me, it's not so much about going fast in an absolute
sense, but going fast in a relative sense," Haggart said.
"That is, anyone can go 135 m.p.h. in a straight line on a
modern motorcycle; the fun — and.in my opinion, the
real skill — comes from going 30 or 40 in a corner
where you would normally do 20 or 25."
Ratan agreed that absolute speed is not his
favorite aspect of riding.
"The thing 1 love most about riding is that
you are really part of the landscape — you
feel the air temperature and smell the
trees — as opposed to a car. where you
are a passive observer through a win
dow," Ratan said.
Ratan pointed out that
there was an ever further perk
of the job: "Chicks dig guys
with bikes."

Let's be honest, I'm pretty badass.
Though don't have any tattoos, rocker boyfriends or mug
shots to date, I bend the rules in my own sort of way. I skip the
occasional I-Hum lecture and bike on the sidewalks. I've even
said the word "sex" on national television. So when the founder
of the Stanford Motorcycle Club picked me up for our interview
on the "Cadillac of Motorcycles," I have to say I wasn't blown
away at the proposition.
My dreams of joining Hell's Angels with my hair blowing
wildly in the wind were further thwarted by an oversized hel
met. But in true journalistic fashion, I chivalrously put my rebel
rousing tendencies aside for one ride and realized that, sports
bike or not, I was the closest to a Biker Babe that I was ever
going to get.
Unfortunately, my biker image trailed far behind that of my
driver's, Chris Pumo, co-term by day and biker by lunch breaks.
Pumo's leather jacket and ripped jeans proved his slight edge on
the coolness factor. Also, while I was only trailing along for one
Sunday afternoon ride, Pumo can be credited as the founder of
the Stanford Motorcycle Club.
Pumo started the organization about a month and a half ago
as a way to organize a forum for all of the area's bikers. Fed up
with having to travel to San Jose fora group ride, he posted fly
ers near motorcycle parking spaces and on parked motorcycles
around campus. He received a surge of responses, and thanks to
the resurrection of an old motorcycle Stanford e-mail list and
word-of-mouth. the club has grown in size to about 30 people.
Members range from senior Robby Ratan. who bought his
first motorcycle from eßay three months ago, to 51-year-old
Craig Haggart, a Stanford Linear Accelerator Center staff
member, who has been riding motorcycles for more than 35
years.
Pumo bought his first bike, a 1980 Kawasaki, three years
ago. Since then, the Kawasaki has had two successors. Pumo is
now working on putting together a 1970 Harley Davidson,
which he bought last summer disassembled in cardboard boxes
— and without a frame.
After reading how-to books and talking to mechanics, Pumo
said he has been able to complete roughly 60 percent of the job
and hopes to finish it entirely by this summer.
"It's like a giant Lego set for adults, only a little more com
plicated," Pumo said.
While Pumo's parents initially disapproved of his first mo
torcycle purchase, his dad has since come around, though Pumo
says that his mother is still a little more hesitant.
"1 don't know if anyone's mom would love them riding a mo
torcycle," he said.
That said, however, members hardly go on their share of joy
rides.
Weekly meetings are Fridays at 11:30 a.m. at the Stanford
Driving Range Parking Lot. where the group meets to ride up
to Alice's, on the corner of Skyline and Highway 84. for lunch.
