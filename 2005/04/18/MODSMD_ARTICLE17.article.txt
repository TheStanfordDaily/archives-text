# Church losing pull over Catholics
## 
### ANDRES KWON MICHIGAN DAILY (U. MICHIGAN 
(U-WIRE) ANN ARBOR, Mich. — While
the Roman Catholic Apostolic Church man
dates that divorce, homosexuality, abortion
and birth control are unacceptable, accord
ing to the World Values Survey conducted
by the University of Michigan's Institute for
Social Research, not every Catholic agrees.
According to political science Prof.
Ronald Inglehart, director of the World Val
ues Survey, most practicing Catholics did not
accept divorce 50 years ago. By 2(XX). howev
er, only 6 percent of the Catholic respon
dents in the United States said that divorce
was never justifiable.
Attitudes toward abortion and homosex
uality have followed the same pattern. Ingle
hart found that the percentage of U.S.
Catholics who believe that abortion is never
justifiable fell from 50 percent in 1981 to 37
percent in 2(KX). The percentage of U.S.
Catholics saying that homosexuality is never
justifiable dropped from 60 percent in 1981
to 19 percent in 2000.
This increasing approval of the "forbid
den practices" is not a pattern unique to the
United States or to Catholics. Inglehart said
Protestants have witnessed a similar pattern.
"Overall," he said, "although there has
been only a slight decline in church atten
dance. there's been a major decline in the im
portance of religion in rich nations."
Inglehart referred to secularization as an
occurrence in developed nations, where the

majority of people take survival for granted.
In the developing world, on the other hand,
he said that people who are economically in
secure "seek a sense of security — that
somehow (their survival) is in the hands of
some benevolent being."
Nevertheless, "people are not becoming
more amoral," Inglehart pointed out. He said
that the environmental movement, for exam
ple, although secular, has a moral tone to it.
"We have different moral values now —
it's a more individualistic version of reli
gion."
The initial purpose of the World Values
Survey was to trace social and cultural
change.
"It's clear it's taking place and it has im
portant implications," said Inglehart.
As predicted by the survey. Catholic stu
dents at the University had contrary views
on the many different issues.
LSA senior Kenneth Buck pointed out
that Jesus had strong words on divorce —
that it should not be allowed unless adultery
was committed.
LSA junior Jen D'Souza agreed.
"In certain situations, divorce should be
allowed, especially when there's physical
abuse," she said.
Buck professed that homosexuality in it
self is not a sin.
"The Church doesn't say you'll go to hell
if you're homosexual — the lifestyle is what
is sinful, not simply being homosexual," he
said.
LSA senior Elizabeth Bovair disagreed.

"Jesus' message is to love one another
and not to judge.? she said. '.'There's such a
lack of love in this world, how could you tell
somebody not to love?"
On abortion, LSA senior Karlee Boike
said, "I am pro-life and I agree with the
Church's teachings on this matter, but I do
not think it is my place to make the decision
for someone else. It's a moral issue, not a po
litical one."
Some students said they felt that abor
tion. as well as the spread of disease, can be
partially avoided by better knowledge of
birth control.
"People are going to have sex regardless,
and they need to be educated so that abor
tion rates don't rise and STD rates don't rise,
especially AIDS," said junior Melissa
Housefield, a student in nursing.
Many Catholics feel that the influence
of the Catholic Church's hierarchy in their
lives, values and attitudes has weakened.
Elizabeth Benki said her local priest and
the Pope filled significant roles in her faith,
but officials in between didn't really make
an impact.
"I feel that the hierarchy fails to realize
the changing nature of human beings and
their cultures," Bovair said.
Others said they trust the Church's hier
archy. University alum Robert Shereda said,
"The Church's hierarchy [is] a thoughtful
and diverse group that cares deeply about
their Church and the people they serve."
Buck said that his faith in the hierarchy
hasn't diminished.

"I still trust the Holy Spirit is guiding the
bishops and the Church in general," Buck
said.
Bovair commented on the future of the
church.
"I hope the Church uses this opportunity
with the election of the new pope to really
get back to the basis of what our faith really
is,? he said. ?It's not about politics, not about
hierarchy, not about power. It's about the
belief that Christ died for each and every one
of us. whether you are the person sitting in
the back row of the church questioning your
belief or the pope himself."
Buck said he hopes the new pope will
stand as firmly as Pope John Paul 11. who
wasn't on the "liberal" or "conservative"
side, but right there with the Gospels. He
pointed out that the Church's teachings on
these controversial issues "have been its con
sistent teachings for 2.000 years."
Shereda agreed.
"Terming sides of the debates concerning
the Church as liberal' or 'conservative' is
disingenuous and unnecessarily divisive —
heterodox' and orthodox' are more honest
and accurate," he said.
University alum and accounting graduate
student Vincenzo Villamena said. "We may
have different opinions and different rea
sons for (having different opinions), but
whether we agree with these ideologies or
not is not going to change the greater mes
sage of the Church, which is to love each
other."
