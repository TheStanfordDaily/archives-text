## Editorial Sketchy TAs still a problem 
### 
In gigantic lecture classes, it often seems as it pro
fessors are just figures you see on the distant stage,
waving their hands and pontificating, while teaching
assistants are our real teachers. They grade our prob
lem sets and papers, and they are the ones we turn to
when numbers and vocabulary words stop making
sense.
But the relationship between student and TA is
not always perfect. In addition to the usual (and valid)
complaints that come up year after year — TAs who
don't speak English fluently, students who don't show
their TAs any respect, etc. — there are important
concerns about what constitutes appropriate behav
ior between TAs and students. These concerns can
range from complaints about "grad student sketchi
ness" to more serious issues of sexual harassment.
University administrators are aware of this issue
and have taken steps to address it. TAs are expected
to attend a workshop at the beginning of the year out
lining appropriate and inappropriate behavior re
garding the TA / student relationship. And in most
cases, simply following common sense is enough to
avoid difficult or inappropriate situations.
Unfortunately, problems still exist; there are still
TAs who make inappropriate remarks or act in other
ways that can make their students feel uncomfortable.
One important step in addressing this problem is in-

creasing awareness on both sides. Students should
have a clear idea of what kinds of behavior are inap
propriate coming from their TAs and who they can
approach with complaints. TAs should have an even
clearer idea of the line between friendliness and ha
rassment. and who they can talk to when questions
arise about that line.
Individual departments and Stanford adminis
trators should do all that they can to facilitate this
process. Annual workshops for TAs are great, but
they should be held more regularly, and TAs should
be given an explicit code of conduct that they sign
and agree to follow. Likewise, Stanford should give
students information at the beginning of classes
and on the Internet about the rules governing TA
behavior and who students can turn to when those
rules are broken.
Ideally, the relationship between TAs and students
should be a comfortable one. Unfortunately, this isn't
always the case, and unclear boundaries and misun
derstandings only exacerbate the problem. Hopeful
ly. once TAs and students can learn this information,
they can push it to the back of their mind and focus on
more important matters — like, say, the next
midterm. But if problems arise, students will know
what to do. they will know that the University will sup
port them.
