The sticky notes on the world
atlas indicated places in need of ju
nior Helen Shi's prayers.
"People had written specific
prayer requests and sticky noted
them on the country, and so I
prayed for some of those countries
and what I knew of what was going
on — like Darfur, Indonesia, and
someone had written a prayer re
quest for some people who were
working in Kenya and Mexico." she
said.
The Intervarsity Graduate
Christian Fellowship organized a
24/7 Prayer at Stanford — a full
168 hours of prayer — starting last
week at 9 a.m. on April 9 and end

ing at 9 a.m. on April 16. The sec
ond annual event is intended to in
spire members of Stanford's Chris
tian community to pray on a regular
basis.
A room in the basement of Old
Union was reserved for prayer
through the entire week. Dozens of
students and community members
signed up to participate— many
signing up for multiple time slots —
even though the event was adver
tised almost exclusively through e
mail lists.
"It was just something 1 wanted
to and will continue to do, on a per
sonal basis," said Sam Peterson, a
second-year master's student in
electrical engineering.
