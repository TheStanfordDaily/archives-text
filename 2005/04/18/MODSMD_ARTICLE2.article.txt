The sticky notes on the world
atlas indicated places in need of ju
nior Helen Shi's prayers.
"People had written specific
prayer requests and sticky noted
them on the country, and so I
prayed for some of those countries
and what I knew of what was going
on — like Darfur, Indonesia, and
someone had written a prayer re
quest for some people who were
working in Kenya and Mexico." she
said.
The Intervarsity Graduate
Christian Fellowship organized a
24/7 Prayer at Stanford — a full
168 hours of prayer — starting last
week at 9 a.m. on April 9 and end

ing at 9 a.m. on April 16. The sec
ond annual event is intended to in
spire members of Stanford's Chris
tian community to pray on a regular
basis.
A room in the basement of Old
Union was reserved for prayer
through the entire week. Dozens of
students and community members
signed up to participate— many
signing up for multiple time slots —
even though the event was adver
tised almost exclusively through e
mail lists.
"It was just something 1 wanted
to and will continue to do, on a per
sonal basis," said Sam Peterson, a
second-year master's student in
electrical engineering.
Peterson, who signed up for six
hours total, said the event brought the
various Christian communities on
campus closer together and was an ex
cellent way for individuals to reaffirm
their faith.
"I went in the middle of the night
and was able to go and play |guitar]
and sing without bothering any
body," he said. Praying alone is "a
vital part of life — to go away from
where other people are watching

you. away from where there are dis
tractions."
There were prayer slots available
24 hours a day and individuals and
groups could sign up fora slot. The
prayer room had items to promote
prayer, including paper to sketch on.
pillows, journals. Bibles, Christian
music and prayer guides. Prayer re

notes, in a prayer journal and on drop
off requests.
One organizer, third-year me
chanical engineering doctoral student
Paul Leu, said he prayed for Pope
John Paul II and for the election of a
new pope. He participated and
helped organize the event last year

and said some non-Christians partici
pated in the week-long event.
"1 think prayer is such a simple
thing, yel it is such an essential part of
our faith," he said. "It's something
that we should he doing on a daily
basis, and this kind of event was to
promote that — encourage people to
do it on a daily basis."
Leu said the timing of the event
was to promote and not conflict with
other events the Christian community
is planning, such as a Veritas Forum
and the All Campus Gathering in
May. But while the other events were
important, coordinators said the main
focus of 24 / 7 Prayer was to promote
praying.
