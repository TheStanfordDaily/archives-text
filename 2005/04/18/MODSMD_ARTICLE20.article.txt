## Welcome to the champagne room 
### 
There's no sex in graduate school.
.. none. Oh, there's schooling in grad
uate school. But you don't want
schooling, you want sex. And there's
no sex ... in graduate school.
The last time I got laid was one
year, one month, one week, four days,
23 hours, six minutes and 47 seconds,
48 seconds, 49 seconds ago. Not that
I'm keeping count or anything.
Now, the absence of any action in

my life is not a great tragedy (sadly, not even for me).
However, forced celibacy is a widespread affliction that
affects more than just this writer. In fact, I bet if I asked
all the single graduate students reading this to e-mail me
if they got any in the last week, the only sex-related mes
sages in my inbox would be the usual penis enlargement
spam.
Back in my home country of England, university is tra
ditionally where young people suddenly discover the pro
fundity of sex and coincidently start fucking like rabbits. I
had assumed (or hoped, rather) that the same was true in
the land of the free.
Such assumptions were largely based on a succes
sion of college movies — after all, how could real life
fail to live up to "Animal House"? However, as I re
alized during my frequent contemplations of the mis
ery of existence, all those movies are about under
graduates.
Occasionally (once again during moments of misery
contemplation) I find myself running through the rea
sons why we end up here. Along with the obvious
love of the subject, general geekiness and so on — 1 feel
that many of us. myself included, believe that our quali
ty of life could be that of a "real" student. That is to say
that the rabbit-like shagging of lore would be available if
so desired.
This isn't true.
I think what's worse is that many of us didn't actually
have the Delta house experience back in our youth, and
we foolishly thought that the moment hadn't actually

passed since we had another five years of school left.
Even if you have more modest aims than to throw a
fully-fledged toga party, you're still going to be disap
pointed with the sexual climate. Take, for example, the
difficulties facing a single guy trying to talk to girl at a
party.
Assuming you can even tind a party with a detinable
male-to-female ratio, the process would still be a terrible
struggle. The number of girls that turn up to the average
graduate sausagefest is so low that a kind of spontaneous
shielding effect takes place.
Everything that could be mistaken for female is im
mediately encircled by a pack of hungry, salivating elec
trical engineers (and 1 suppose other types as well). So
unless you have low enough self-respect to join the pack,
you find yourself standing in the corner watching the 1 +
1 9 clusters intermingle, cursing the day you decided that
graduate school would be "fun."
Of course, the complicated path to humping is noeas
ier for the females of the species. Fora start, have you
seen the electrical engineers? Also, who knows how to a)
flirt with 19 men simultaneously or b) fight out of the
crowd to start on one that caught your eye on the other
side of the room?
What's especially depressing is that this is not just a
techie phenomenon. I'm reliably informed that no one's
really getting any over in the humanities either. In fact,
the "champagne room" observation is credited to a
group of girls whose natural habitat is far from the dark
recesses of the science and engineering quad.
So there you have it: It ain't going on in grad
school. Those of you who haven't taken the fateful
step to continued education yet should take this op
portunity to reflect carefully before making any rash
life choices. There's no sex in graduate school . . .
none.

If \ou did happen to get laid last week, please don 7 e-mail
me. My life is miserable enough already without needing to
hear about your sexual conquests. However, if you have
anything interesting to say, e-mail navins@stanford.edu.
