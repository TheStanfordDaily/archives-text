There's a reason there arc stan
dards in research, whereby aca
demics subject their methodology
and findings to rigorous indepen
dent review before releasing them to
the public. Studies that are not eon
ducted or presented accurately can.
in the hands of those who do not
have the research background to ac
curately interpret the conclusions,
have an adverse impact on policy
and practice.
On April 15. The Daily covered a
study about Teach For America's
impact that did not meet these stan
dards ("Study raises questions about
Teach for America"). Sadly, we fear
that the study and the article could
have real costs for kids and for soci
ety.
In 2004, the Carnegie Corpora
tion. Hewlett Foundation and Smith
Richardson Foundation commis
sioned a study by Mathcmatica Poli

cy Research to find out whether
Teach l or America had a positive
impact on student achievement. The
$2 million study, which was conduct
ed across six geographic regions, was
meant to resolve a long-standing de
bate between Teach For America
and its critics, most visible among
them Stanford Education Prof.
Linda Darling-Hammond.
Mathcmatica found that Teach
For America teachers outperform
even the veteran and certified teach
ers in their schools in a statistically
significant way. Before communicat
ing these findings, the Mathcmatica
researchers spent months subjecting
their study to independent review by
other researchers, to ensure that its
methodology and findings were accu
rate.
Mathematical study was so ex
pensive because they conducted a
rigorous "experiment" as the basis
for their analysis. They randomly as
signed students to the classrooms of

Teach For America corps members
and other teachers in their schools,
and then analyzed and compared the
gains students made on a norm-ref
erenced standardized test adminis
tered at the beginning and end of the
year.
The Daily's story reports on Dar
ling-Hammond's recent study,
which she says shows that Teach For
America corps members have less
impact on student achievement than
certified teachers. Her study was re
leased before she subjected it to rig
orous independent review and be
fore she showed it to us.
Even a cursory review reveals sig
nificant flaws in her paper, among
them that the conclusions stated in
the study arc inconsistent with the
data in the study, and that sample
sizes are not stated and are question
able based on what we know. In fact,
it looks like in a couple of cases, her
