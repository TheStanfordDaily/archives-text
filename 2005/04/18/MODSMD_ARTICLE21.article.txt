## Considering the social responsibility of academia and journalism 
### WENDY KOPP 
There's a reason there arc stan
dards in research, whereby aca
demics subject their methodology
and findings to rigorous indepen
dent review before releasing them to
the public. Studies that are not eon
ducted or presented accurately can.
in the hands of those who do not
have the research background to ac
curately interpret the conclusions,
have an adverse impact on policy
and practice.
On April 15. The Daily covered a
study about Teach For America's
impact that did not meet these stan
dards ("Study raises questions about
Teach for America"). Sadly, we fear
that the study and the article could
have real costs for kids and for soci
ety.
In 2004, the Carnegie Corpora
tion. Hewlett Foundation and Smith
Richardson Foundation commis
sioned a study by Mathcmatica Poli

cy Research to find out whether
Teach l or America had a positive
impact on student achievement. The
$2 million study, which was conduct
ed across six geographic regions, was
meant to resolve a long-standing de
bate between Teach For America
and its critics, most visible among
them Stanford Education Prof.
Linda Darling-Hammond.
Mathcmatica found that Teach
For America teachers outperform
even the veteran and certified teach
ers in their schools in a statistically
significant way. Before communicat
ing these findings, the Mathcmatica
researchers spent months subjecting
their study to independent review by
other researchers, to ensure that its
methodology and findings were accu
rate.
Mathematical study was so ex
pensive because they conducted a
rigorous "experiment" as the basis
for their analysis. They randomly as
signed students to the classrooms of

Teach For America corps members
and other teachers in their schools,
and then analyzed and compared the
gains students made on a norm-ref
erenced standardized test adminis
tered at the beginning and end of the
year.
The Daily's story reports on Dar
ling-Hammond's recent study,
which she says shows that Teach For
America corps members have less
impact on student achievement than
certified teachers. Her study was re
leased before she subjected it to rig
orous independent review and be
fore she showed it to us.
Even a cursory review reveals sig
nificant flaws in her paper, among
them that the conclusions stated in
the study arc inconsistent with the
data in the study, and that sample
sizes are not stated and are question
able based on what we know. In fact,
it looks like in a couple of cases, her
study tries to draw conclusions from
as few as two or three teachers — a
laughably low standard for policy
analysis.
Yet Darling-Hammond knows
that regardless of the study's flaws,
she can use it to raise questions
around Teach For America in the
media. If. of course, the media will
take the bait.
Journalists shoulder greater re
sponsibility when researchers don't
hold themselves to high standards.
Covering the findings of a "study"
and including a few paragraphs at
the end quoting "the other side"
does not go far enough because busy
readers will base their opinions on
the headline and the first few para
graphs alone.
When researchers share stud
ies with the press before they
share them with independent ex
perts and with the study's subjects
themselves, journalists should be
skeptical. It's easy to be duped,
and when that happens the real
life consequences can be really
significant.
Friday, the day The Daily's arti
cle ran. was the day selected Stan
ford seniors received letters of ac
ceptance to Teach For America.
They're committed people and
clearly they don't want to do some
thing that doesn't have a positive im
pact on kids' lives. So it's certainly
possible that reading about this
"study" could lead some Stanford
undergrads to decide not to join
Teach For America this year, or not
to apply in the future. Ultimately,
kids and communities —who have
been under-served for decades —
will suffer.
What those in academia and jour
nalism, as our country's thought
leaders, choose to write about im
pacts what becomes viewed as fact
and what becomes policy. And the
choices made by these people will
help determine whether Teach For
America's movement to end educa
tional inequity grows and changes
the trajectory of educational out
comes in our country, or whether it
peters out, leaving us right back
where we started.

Wendy Kopp is the president and
founder of Teach for America.
