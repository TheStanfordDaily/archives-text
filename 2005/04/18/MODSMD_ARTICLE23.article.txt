## Legacy of double standards 
### 
On April 13,
The Daily pub
lished Noah
Weiss' article,
"Legacy admis
sions: does a
family history at
the Farm mat
ter?" 1 can't say
how much it
does, but 1 can

pretty confidently say it shouldn't.
In an era when many, particularly
those who are politically conserva
tive, denounce affirmative action
programs as reverse discrimination,
I am consistently bemused by the
lack of condemnation toward legacy
preference. Although Stanford does
not publish its legacy admission
rates, one alumnus who wrote a let
ter in response to The Daily article
speculated that it was around 30 per
cent.
Considering that affirmative ac
tion policies rarely bump black ap
plicants even to the 12 percent ad
mission rate that would be propor
tional to their percentage share of
the population. I'm flabbergasted by
why so few people see anything
wrong with legacy preference.
Of course, whereas the intent be
hind affirmative action is to favor
those without much influence or
leverage, legacy programs generally
favor the already powerful in soci
ety, so "the ones on top," as Lauryn
Mill once rapped, "won't make it
stop, so convinced that they might
fall."
Given that, as I often contend, a
healthy top 10 percent of any high
school class could thrive here, Stan
ford is not lacking for strong candi
dates for admission. Legacy pro
grams don't exist to help find those
few qualified candidates.
They do, however, strengthen
Stanford's fundraising goals and
boost alumni giving rates. In the
United States, money is power, and
those in power have an incredible
sense of entitlement. I know in my
family, when a relative was not ad
mitted to a school, her alumna moth
er immediately ceased t>ivint> to the

university as she had been doing for
the previous 20 years. I would hope
that this is the exception to the rule,
hut my instinct tells me it's not.
Knowing that legacy preference
does exist, my ears always perk up
when a friend or acquaintance says
a parent went to Stanford. Just as
with the classic moment of ques
tioning if a minority candidate only
got in because of affirmative action.
I occasionally wonder to myself
whether that person would have
gotten in without legacy prefer
ence. It obviously doesn't matter ei
ther way but. just as with affirma
tive action, it does slightly under
mine that person's status, knowing
they may have ridden in on special
treatment as much as stellar test
scores and incredible extra-curricu
lar activities.
And at least the goal of affirma
tive action is to expand access to
higher education. Legacy prefer
ence only helps those already in a
position to take advantage of it.
Weiss' article noted that minority
alumni favor legacy programs as
much as white alumni. I'm sure they
do. Anyone getting special favors
doesn't want that cut off. Maybe in
25 (or 40!) years from now, I too will
favor legacy preference when I want
my son or daughter to be admitted.
But for now, 1 don't see how lega
cy preference does anything but re
inforce advantages to those who al
ready have them while also helping
to maintain class boundaries. I've
said it before and I'll say it again; We
as future leaders need to have a bet
ter discourse on issues of class.
Meanwhile. Stanford should end
any sort of legacy preference. If the
admissions office's stated goal is to
find and admit the best and bright
est. then that's what it should do. It's
unfortunate that as a consequence,
we may just have to find alternate
ways to get that fancy new building
funded.
