# Op-Ed
## Armenian genocide column inconsistent 
### CIHAN BARAN 
In her op-ed, Ani Kardashian
rightly speaks of the lack of aware
ness of past atrocities in today's
community ("Armenian genocide
must not he forgotten," April 15).
Yet her deliberate attempts to dis
tort the past and represent on side of
what has been going on as a histori
cal discussion is a terrible blow to in
tellectual integrity. The question of
the so-called "Armenian genocide"
is an open one. People who are un
aware of this issue should bear in
mind that there is no foregone con
clusion about this matter, as in the
case of Holocaust.
Let's view the issue in the frame
work that Kardashian has set up for
us. I claim that it is plausible to es
tablish the inconsistencies analyti
cally in her message. She claims that
the "Young Turk regime emerged,
consisting of radical young military
officers who were troubled by the ..
. the numerous minority groups in
habiting the empire ..." So it is said
that the Young Turks were troubled
by more than one minority.
The point then becomes obvious.
Any serious student of history

knows that the Ottoman Empire
was a vast mosaic of ethnic diversity.
The Empire tolerated and treated
with respect throughout its history
Arabs. Bulgarians, Greeks, Slavs,
Armenians and peoples of many
other ethnicities. If these Young
Turks were keen on their radical na
tionalism. why did they try to only
exterminate the Armenians of all
the different ethnicities? Why would
they pick on a particular race as op
posed to all the others? Of course,
Kardashian, while speaking of many
ethnicities in the Ottoman Empire,
isn't able to speak of genocides that
relate to other people.
But then, let's raise our heads
above kardashian's politicking and
biased ways and at least try to put
things in a better perspective. The
end of 19th century was completely
transforming for the Ottoman Em
pire. With the advent of such ideas
as democracy and nationalism,
many groups within the Ottoman
Empire claimed their independence
â€” Balkan nations are such exam
ples. Armenians, however, had not
yet formed such an independent
state. As the Ottoman Empire
weakened, the Armenians saw

World War I as an opportunity for
independence. They have allied with
Russia, who was battling the Ot
toman Empire, to back-stab the Ot
toman Nation from the inside. In
their zeal against the Ottoman Na
tion. many villages were burned, in
nocent Turks killed, tortured and
raped. As a result of these evil deeds,
the Ottoman Government forcibly
deported them to other regions
(such as south-eastern Anatolia).
Even more disgraceful statements
follow from Kardishian. Identifying
taking position in a historical and
open debate as "denial," she writes,
"This denial has arguably contribut
ed to future genocides, including the
Holocaust and more recent geno
cides in Rwanda and Darfur." I dare
Kardashian to prove and show evi
dence for this statement. Where can
we find reference in Hitler's "Mein
Kampf" to Ottoman Empire and
what allegedly happened to the Ar
menians? How does the right of a na
tion to defend itself spouse such huge
