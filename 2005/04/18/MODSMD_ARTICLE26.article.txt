# Month-long series discusses Iran
## Groups promote awareness of culture, politics, history in Iran 
### RAGHAV THAPAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an effort to discuss the role of Iraq in
the world today and provide students with
historical context to understand U.S.-Iran
ian relations, several student groups and
departments are hosting a lecture series
throughout the next month entitled "Past
and Present."
The series began last night with a talk by
Abbas Milani, a research fellow and Iran
expert at the Hoover Institution, who
spoke about on Iran's ancient culture and
place in global history. There will be a
speaker event every Sunday night until
May 17 to increase student awareness
about cultural, political and security issues
related to Iran.
On April 24, William O. Beeman, a vis
iting professor from Brown University,
will speak on how misperceptions of Iran

are usually derived from the 1979 Iranian
revolution and the subsequent hostage cri
sis. The event coordinators said they hope
he can correct any false views or stereotyp
ing of people with Iranian heritage.
Mehdi Javanmard, a third-year electri
cal engineering doctoral student and event
coordinator said, "Having lived in Iran be
fore, [Beeman] should provide us insight
into the culture and people of Iran."
On May 1, Shahram Aghamir, a jour
nalist currently working for KPFA 94.1 FM
Berkeley, will host a talk on Iran's path to
ward self-determination. The presentation
will focus on the 1953 British and Ameri
can coup that brought Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi back into power. A docu
mentary entitled "Anatomy of a Coup:
The CIA in Iran" will follow the talk.
The fourth talk of the series is sched
uled for May 8 and will feature three short
lectures on contemporary Iran. Kaveh
Ehsani, a research scholar at the Universi
ty of Illinois at Chicago, will give the first
talk on Iran's current political identity. Mi
lani, who will focus on reform movements
and the media, will follow him. The night
will conclude with a speech on the role of
women and religious minorities in Iran by
Nayereh Tohidi, an associate professor of

women's studies at California State Uni
versity at Northridge.
The final lecture on May 15 will be
given by Bennington College Political Sci
ence Prof. Mansour Farhang, who served
as an advisor to the Iranian foreign min
istry and as ambassador to the United Na
tions. He negotiated with United States of
ficials during the hostage crisis and re
signed from his position in protest when his
efforts to negotiate the release of the
American hostages in Tehran failed. He
will discuss U.S.-Iranian relations and
Iran's nuclear program.
The goal of the lecture series is to raise
campus awareness about the major issues
that exist in Iran and the global communi
ty today. Coordinators said they hope stu
dents will gain a more complete and accu
rate perspective of the complexities and
nuances surrounding modern Iran.
"Hopefully this speaker series will dis
pel some commonly held myths regarding
Iran," Javanmard said.
The series is sponsored by the Persian
Student Association, The Muslim Student
Awareness Network and the Coalition for
Justice in the Middle East, in conjunction
with the Department of Religious Studies
and the History Department.
