# Panel seeks Kashmir solution
## 
### DAISY CHUNG STAFF WRITER 
Nearly 70 students and community members filled the
Meyer Forum Room to hear a presentation entitled "A Di
alogue on Kashmir," which addressed the long-standing
territorial dispute between India and Pakistan.
Located between the borders of India. Pakistan and
China, Kashmir is currently under Indian rule. However,
frequent violence along the border has created instability,
attracting the attention of human rights activists world
wide.
Management Science and Engineering Prof. Ron
Howard spoke at the event about conflict resolution, de
scribing voluntary social systems in which people solve
disputes without resorting to violence. He posed the
concept of a society that functions without the use of
force.
Howard compared the Indian government's statement,
"An India without Kashmir is unthinkable," with the Pak
istani government's similar stance.
"From the positions people have taken, it's clear that no
peaceful solution is possible right now," Howard said.
"That's the real problem."
Stanford student Dhiraj Bakaya, a Kashmiri activist,
opened the event by presenting the history of Kashmir and
described current efforts to resolve the conflict. Kashmir,
which translates to "Land of the I lindu Saints." has been

the focus of hostilities since 1339.
Bakaya presented the positions of several interest
groups, including the Indian and Pakistani governments,
Islamic militant groups and Kashmiri leadership.
A panel of seven undergraduate and graduate students
and community members fielded questions from the audi
ence. The participants represented various regions in and
around Kashmir, and many of the panelists shared the ex
periences of their family and friends as well as their
thoughts on the situation.
One of the central topics of discussion was indepen
dence. Students explored the possibility of an independent
Kashmiri nation, and the panelists volleyed back and forth
about the complications, benefits and drawbacks of such a
solution.
A member of the audience brought up partition as an
other possible solution to the resolution.
"In the past, many colonial territories were divided up
arbitrarily according to geography and not the people liv
ing within them, and we should remember this when parti
tioning Kashmir," Howard said.
The panel ended before all the speakers and audience
members had a chance to voice their opinions. One of the
organizers of the event, sophomore Deepa Alagesan, said,
"Our main objective is to engage in some dialogue. It's a
very emotional issue obviously, but we are trying to get stu
dents to put their heads together and come up with ideas
about how we can resolve this conflict peacefully."
