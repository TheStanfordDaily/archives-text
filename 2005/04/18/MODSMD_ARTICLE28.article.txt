## Fade Into Bolivian Early thoughts on a long season 
### 
Here I sit in a Harvard dorm room,
awaiting my hoy Sameer Narang to
finish his dinner at the illustrious eat
ing club. The Fox, as I write my column.
After attending the Harvard-Yale baseball
doubleheader there's no doubt in my mind
that this column must be about baseball.
So what happened in the first week of the
season?
As I looked at the standings for the
American League East on the morning of
April 12, I noticed something startling —
the standings were the exact inverse of the
final standings of the 2004 season. The Yan
kees were — and remain — cellar dwellers
and the Blue Jays, apparently returning to
1993 form, were in first.
And with that, I'd like to welcome every-

body to the 2005 baseball
season, a season in which no
lead is apparently safe.
Today, first place teams
include the Orioles, the
White Sox and the Wash
ington Nationals. I hope
these teams savior their
time in first as it will most
certainly not last more than
two weeks.

Sidenote: I just read about the new, pri
vately financed Yankee stadium. Will this
actually happen? I went to the Yanks' stadi
um in the summer of 2002 (and hopefully I'll
go again soon) and there's no doubt that the
Yankees need a new home park. History
aside, the stadium comfort factor in"The
House that Ruth Built" is among the worst
in the Major Leagues.
Another sidenote: As I walk around the
streets of Boston. I can't help but notice the
plethora of Red Sox hats. Quite literally,
three out of every five people are sporting a
Sox hat. Do they even know Jason Varitek
from Bronson Arroyo? My guess is no.
Yet another sidenote: Barry Zito, 0-3?
Ouch. As sorority rush has just ended, I'd
like to point out that Tonya Harding was ap
parently a Kappa. For any of those girls who
have recently rushed Kappa, please protect
your knees.
So, on to the Giants. First of all, there
should be little to no worry about the Giants
starters (I just read a stat that in 16 major
league starts, Noah Lowry is undefeated).
Where the worry should lie is in the bullpen.
Through the signing of Armando Benitez,
I thought the bullpen failures of 2004 were
over for the Giants. If Matt Herges wasn't
blowing one of his eight saves in 31 opportu
nities, it was Dustin Hermanson unable to
save key games down the stretch. A look at
the bullpen in 2004 shows a 4.53 ERA and a
.283 opponents' batting average, the highest
in the majors.
Fast forward to 2005 and the Giants are
now 1-4 against the Dodgers. Amazingly,
washed-up pitcher Jeff Fassero (5.2 innings
and a 1.59 ERA) is one of two Giants reliev
ers with an ERA below five.
A recent example shows the problems
that the Giants bullpen has been having.
With a comfortable 8-5 lead last Tuesday,
Benitez was brought in to close out the
Dodgers. However, to quote the excellent
Web site, Baseball-Reference.com. "when
the history of baseball is retold, the chronic
unthinkable failures of this great Met in any


Neil Davis
and all clutch situations" will un
doubtedly cloud the memory of
this closer.
Granted, Benitez was in the
New York spotlight and had re
ceived the reputation as a choker.
But with history repeating it
self, Benitez, apparently unable to
control his cutter (his only decent
pitch), gave up four runs in the
bottom of the ninth and the
Dodgers won, 9-8.
Fact about Benitez: He has
yielded more postseason home
runs than any other reliever in
Major League history (through
four postseasons). Moreover, six
times in 10 postseason save oppor
tunities, Benitez blew the save.
Through the Giants' first six
games, every reliever had given up
at least one run and the totality of
their collective relief effort yield
ed these statistics: 17.1 innings
pitched, a .370 opposing average
and a 10.90 ERA (dead last in the
Majors).
Benitez's blown save is em
blematic of closers' troubles shut
ting the door this season. Through
April 9, there had been 22 saves
and 33 blown saves. Apparently no
lead is safe, as there were 39 blown
saves in the first 99 games last
year.

Neil Davis is a senior who is in Bean
town for the Boston Marathon. E

this closer.
Granted, Benitez was in the
New York spotlight and had re
ceived the reputation as a choker.
But with history repeating it
self, Benitez, apparently unable to
control his cutter (his only decent
pitch), gave up four runs in the
bottom of the ninth and the
Dodgers won, 9-8.
Fact about Benitez: He has
yielded more postseason home
runs than any other reliever in
Major League history (through
four postseasons). Moreover, six
times in 10 postseason save oppor
tunities, Benitez blew the save.
Through the Giants' first six
games, every reliever had given up
at least one run and the totality of
their collective relief effort yield
ed these statistics: 17.1 innings
pitched, a .370 opposing average
and a 10.90 ERA (dead last in the
Majors).
Benitez's blown save is em
blematic of closers' troubles shut
ting the door this season. Through
April 9, there had been 22 saves
and 33 blown saves. Apparently no
lead is safe, as there were 39 blown
saves in the first 99 games last
year.
