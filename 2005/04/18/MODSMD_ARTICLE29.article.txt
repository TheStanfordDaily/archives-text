# Card suffer rare Pac-10 sweep at ASU
## 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
For 64 straight weekends of Pacific-10 Conference
play, the No. 14 Stanford Cardinal had won at least one
game in a three-game series.
But they couldn't make it 65.
In a wild and disappointing weekend of baseball in the
desert, the Cardinal (20-14, 4-5) were swept by Arizona
State (25-15,6-3), dropping each game in a very different
fashion. It was the first time Stanford was swept in a Pac
-10 series since April of 1997.
What may be the hardest pill to swallow is the fact that
the Cardinal were in the final two games through the last
out.
There was no shortage of drama Saturday night as the
Sun Devils won, 6-5, on a game-ending walk by freshman
Nolan Gallagher.
The Cardinal led 5-3 heading into the bottom of the
ninth inning, but two of Stanford's most consistent re
lievers were unable to pick up the final three outs.
Arizona State designated hitter Rocky Laguna
opened the ninth with a single back up the middle to set
the table for rightfielder Travis Buck. Buck, a preseason
All-American and a member of Team USA, crushed a 2-
2 offering from sophomore reliever Blake Holler over
the right field wall to tie the game at 5-5.
Stanford wasn't out of the woods yet, with no outs and
the heart of the Sun Devil lineup coming up, but things
were looking good when Holler retired Arizona State
RBI leader Tuffy Gosewisch and Pac-10 home run lead
er Jeff Larish in order. However, leftfielder Colin Curtis
walked and sophomore second baseman Seth Dhaenens
reached on a controversial infield hit to chase Holler
from the game. Television replays showed that Dhae
nens was out but the inning continued.
Gallagher entered and issued a four-pitch walk to
third baseman Joey Hooft before walking shortstop Joe
Persichina on five pitches to end the game.
The late-inning collapse spoiled starting pitcher Jeff
Gilmore's best start of the conference season. Gilmore
went 6 2/3 innings, giving up just three runs on four hits,
but earned a no decision once ASU took the lead.
"A summer ball coach told me a year ago the best
starting pitchers in the game, they don't make their
money because they win games," Gilmore said. "It's be
cause they stop the losing streak and they can right the
ship with their performance alone."
Sunday's contest was certainly the wackiest of the
bunch â€” featuring a successful triple steal, a designated
hitter who pitched and relief appearances by both the
Friday night and Saturday night starters. Despite the an
tics, ASU came out on top, 10-9.
The triple steal was a vital part of a seven-run Arizona
State rally in the sixth inning that erased a 5-3 deficit and
rocketed the Sun Devils into the lead.
With two outs and the bases loaded, Larish broke for
home and slid in just ahead of the pitch by junior reliev-

Riding a two-game win streak into Tempe, Ariz., junior Chris Minaker and the Cardinal found themselves chasing the Sun
Devils all weekend in ASU's three-game sweep. Stanford hosts San Jose State in a non-conference game Tuesday night.
