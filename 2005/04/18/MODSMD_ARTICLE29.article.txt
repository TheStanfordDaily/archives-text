# Card suffer rare Pac-10 sweep at ASU
## 
### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
For 64 straight weekends of Pacific-10 Conference
play, the No. 14 Stanford Cardinal had won at least one
game in a three-game series.
But they couldn't make it 65.
In a wild and disappointing weekend of baseball in the
desert, the Cardinal (20-14, 4-5) were swept by Arizona
State (25-15,6-3), dropping each game in a very different
fashion. It was the first time Stanford was swept in a Pac
-10 series since April of 1997.
What may be the hardest pill to swallow is the fact that
the Cardinal were in the final two games through the last
out.
There was no shortage of drama Saturday night as the
Sun Devils won, 6-5, on a game-ending walk by freshman
Nolan Gallagher.
The Cardinal led 5-3 heading into the bottom of the
ninth inning, but two of Stanford's most consistent re
lievers were unable to pick up the final three outs.
Arizona State designated hitter Rocky Laguna
opened the ninth with a single back up the middle to set
the table for rightfielder Travis Buck. Buck, a preseason
All-American and a member of Team USA, crushed a 2-
2 offering from sophomore reliever Blake Holler over
the right field wall to tie the game at 5-5.
Stanford wasn't out of the woods yet, with no outs and
the heart of the Sun Devil lineup coming up, but things
were looking good when Holler retired Arizona State
RBI leader Tuffy Gosewisch and Pac-10 home run lead
er Jeff Larish in order. However, leftfielder Colin Curtis
walked and sophomore second baseman Seth Dhaenens
reached on a controversial infield hit to chase Holler
from the game. Television replays showed that Dhae
nens was out but the inning continued.
Gallagher entered and issued a four-pitch walk to
third baseman Joey Hooft before walking shortstop Joe
Persichina on five pitches to end the game.
The late-inning collapse spoiled starting pitcher Jeff
Gilmore's best start of the conference season. Gilmore
went 6 2/3 innings, giving up just three runs on four hits,
but earned a no decision once ASU took the lead.
"A summer ball coach told me a year ago the best
starting pitchers in the game, they don't make their
money because they win games," Gilmore said. "It's be
cause they stop the losing streak and they can right the
ship with their performance alone."
Sunday's contest was certainly the wackiest of the
bunch — featuring a successful triple steal, a designated
hitter who pitched and relief appearances by both the
Friday night and Saturday night starters. Despite the an
tics, ASU came out on top, 10-9.
The triple steal was a vital part of a seven-run Arizona
State rally in the sixth inning that erased a 5-3 deficit and
rocketed the Sun Devils into the lead.
With two outs and the bases loaded, Larish broke for
home and slid in just ahead of the pitch by junior reliev-

Riding a two-game win streak into Tempe, Ariz., junior Chris Minaker and the Cardinal found themselves chasing the Sun

er Matt Manship. Later in the same
at-bat Dhaenens drove in two with a
single to left.
The seven-run rally put the Car
dinal in a hole, but they showed their
usual resilience, picking up four runs
in the top of the eighth.
Facing Sun Devil reliever Zech
ery Zinicola — who also went 2-for
-4 with two runs as the game's desig
nated hitter — the Cardinal strung
together five hits to plate four and
make it a 10-9 game heading into the
ninth.
With one out in the final inning
junior Chris Minaker singled into
right, but the game ended one batter
later as Buck made a sliding catch on
a John Hester line drive and fired it
into the infield to double off Mi
naker at first. ,
The game also featured relief ap
pearances by ASU's starting pitch
ers in the first two games, Erik Aver
ill and Jason Urquidez. Both pitch
ers threw over 95 pitches in their

starts and were pitching on very
short rest.
Lost in the defeat was the out
standing performance of sophomore
centerfielder Jim Rapoport, who
went 4-for-5 with three RBIs, two
runs and a solo homer. The homer
was his second of the series and his
third of the year. He also extended
his career-high hit streak to 13
games and bumped his hatting aver
age to a team-leading .392.
"Last year 1 didn't get too much
playing time," Rapoport said. "This
year I've been more selective at the
plate. I'm not trying to get to anxious
and I'm waiting to get a good pitch I
can handle"
Rapoport was responsible for
half of the Cardinal's offense in Fri
day night's 9-2 loss. Averill pitched
eight strong innings and held the
Cardinal to only two runs on five
hits.
Rapoport's first home run of the
series came in the fifth inning of Fri
day night's game, but the Cardinal
already trailed 9-1, and it was too lit
tle too late against the dominating
Averill.
Averill's counterpart, junior
starter Mark Romanczuk. struggled

in his seven innings, giving up all
nine runs on 12 hits.
After Stanford scored one run in
the top of the first, ASU answered
right back, picking up three runs in
the bottom half of the frame and
would hold the lead throughout.
However, the biggest blow of the
game came in the bottom of the
fourth inning when Larish crushed a
Romanczuk pitch well over the right
field fence and onto the street out
side the stadium. Larish's 14 homers
lead the Pac-10 and are the third
most in the nation.
"They're ready to hit or get extra
base hits when they're even or ahead
in the count," said Gilmore about an
ASU lineup that posted 25 runs in
three games.
The Cardinal face off against San
Jose State on Tuesday at Sunken Di
amond and look to get back on the
Pac-10 winning track next weekend
against Washington.
"We have to practice Monday to
go over what we were lacking this
weekend," Gilmore said. "Tuesday
night we have a game and that's
going to be a good benchmark as to
where we are going into this next
weekend against Washington."
