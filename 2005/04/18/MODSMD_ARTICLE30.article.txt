# Volleyball ends regular season with two losses
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITER 
The regular season ended on a sour note
for the Stanford men's volleyball team,
which dropped two consecutive matches to
No. 6 Brigham Young University (20-9,15-
7 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) this
weekend.
The No. 9 Cardinal (11-14, 10-12) had

the crowd on its feet both nights, but the en
ergy in Maples Pavilion reached boiling
point on Friday in one of the closest match
es of the season.
Leading 29-26 in game one, the Cougars
missed two consecutive opportunities to
seal the win before pulling out a 30-28 victo
ry.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal came back
strong in game two, with an ace by senior

David Vogel launching them to an early 4-1
lead. Senior Craig Buell added another ace
to push Stanford's lead to 13-8.
"Our serving was outstanding in game
two, and that really got us in a good posi
tion," head coach Don Shaw said. "[BYUJ
struggled, and when their passing goes bad.
they can really struggle. Of course, we also
forced some hitting errors, and that really
made a huge difference."

Stanford closed the game on a 12-4 run
and defeated the defending national cham
pions by the impressive score of 30-18 on a
serve from redshirt senior Kevin Hansen.
"They passed pretty poorly that game,"
junior Ben Redely said. "They didn't get any
offense going, so they made it easy on us."
BYU returned to the court with a
vengeance in game three, building a
20-14 lead. Stanford stormed hack
and a slam hy Buell pulled Stanford
to within one at 24-25 before the
Cougars responded with a 4-1 run to
take a 29-25 lead. As in the first
game, the Cardinal thwarted two of
BYU's game-point attempts, but the
third time was again the charm for
the Cougars as they won 30-26 to
take a 2-1 lead in the match.
"They changed their lineup in
game three, got a little bit better
passing lineup, and they didn't
make quite as many unforced hit
ting errors," Shaw said. "So, they
made a nice adjustment, but we had
chances to win and just couldn't
pull it off."
Stanford started game four with
an early 2-5 deficit but fought back to
tie at 7-7 with another huge slam by
Buell and an ace by Reddy. Compe
tition remained intense throughout
the game, so much so that falling by
one point at 22-23 prompted a Cardi
nal timeout. The match fluctuated
between ties and small leads for each
team, and the advantage swung in
BYU's favor at the right time, giving
them a match point at 27-29.
However, Stanford was not ready
to call it a night, and neither was the
crowd. The throngs of Cougar fans
engaged in a frenzied cheer battle
with the Stanford student section as
everyone in Maples rose to their feet.
Energized by the crowd, the Cardinal
fought back to tie the game twice,
once at 29-29 and again at 30-30, be
fore falling 30-32.
"The fans were really into it and
everything," Reddy said. "It was a lot
of fun, but we just didn't execute at
the end. We had some chances and
didn't take care of it."
Reddy ended the match with a
team-high 19 kills, helped by
Hansen's 46 assists. Defensively,
Vogel contributed 13 digs, but BYU
outblocked Stanford 12.5 to eight.
"1 feel like we could play better,"
Shaw said. "We made a few mistakes
at some times that really hurt us. We
had our chances in just about every
game. But |BYU is] a very good
team, very talented. We have to play
a little bit better, at a little bit higher
rate, to beat a team like that."
Returning to Maples on Saturday
fora rematch, the Cardinal hoped to
correct those mistakes but fell 3-1
again.
"I thought we played kind of the
same," Shaw said. "We made some
mistakes that we shouldn't be mak
ing."
Early in the first game, Shaw made
an uncharacteristic move by substitut
ing freshman Jesse Meredith in for
redshirt junior Will Clayton. As the
Cardinal continued to slide from their
6-6 tie, Clayton reentered the game,
but BYU opened up a 20-15 lead.
Stanford fought back to force a tie
at 27-27, but BYU scored the next
three points to take the game.
"We need to finish the job," Shaw
said. "We get the chance, but we

seem to make bad decisions and do
strange things."
In game two. the Cardinal came
from behind with ;i slam from Buell
to tie the game c > ( ). After falling be
hind again, a sneaky short serve from
Vogel pulled Stanford back to 15-15.
Losing the next three points

prompted Shaw to make another
lineup change, this time putting in
junior Nick Manov. The 6-foot-6
opposite hitter powered the Cardi
nal back to a 20-20 tie with a ser
vice ace.
I he rest of the game was a hard
fought, close battle that brought the

fans to their feet. Stanford failed to
capitalize on its first game-point at
29-26 and six more chances. The re
silient Cougars would eventually
earn a 34-32 victory.
"|BYU] made a couple of unbeliev
ably good plays, but we also made
some real bad decisions when we could

have just finished the deal," Shaw said.
"That really hurt. (The end of game
two) was a real turning point."
Hansen, who finished the match
with 48 assists, agreed that it was a
critical point in the match.
"I'm pretty disappointed,"
Hansen said. "I mean, we should
have closed out game two; we had a
few game-points that we didn't really
take advantage of. We've been strug
gling with that in the past, closing out
games."
Stanford finally managed to do
that in game three, jumping out to a
11-4 lead with the help of an ace from
Vogel and one of Hansen's signature
sneak attacks off a fake assist.
The Cougars crept back late in the
game to make the score 24-19,
prompting a Stanford timeout. Shaw
called a second timeout when BYU
came within one point at 26-25, but
the Cardinal never surrendered the
lead en route to a 30-28 win.
"That really speaks to our team;
we don't really ever give up," Hansen
said. "Just because we're down 2-0,
we're not going to let up. That's sort
of our team M.0."
But in game four, Stanford al
lowed the Cougars to break out of a
series of ties through 9-9 and take a
four-point lead. Two aces from
Reddy could not stop BYU's mo
mentum, and the Cougar lead in
creased to 21-12. A four-point run
later in the game highlighted by an
ace from Hansen only made a tem
porary dent in BYU's lead. The
Cougars closed out the match with a
30-20 win.
"(The Cougars] have a lot of mo
mentum and a lot of offensive
power, so when they get that mo
mentum going, it's hard to stop that.
I'm obviously disappointed, but
these matches didn't mean too
much for us. We were just playing
for home or away next week. So
we're just kind of looking to the
next match."
Shaw also adopted the c'est-la-vie
attitude with regard to the fourth
game. The duo of Victor Batista
(with 21 kills in the match) and Ivan
Perez (with 19) simply overpowered
the Cardinal. No other player for
BYU had double-digit kills.
"I think in game four there was no
more gas left in the tank," Shaw said.
"We don't have a lot of options,
when you play with basically the
same seven guys."
Losing both matches this week
end dropped the Cardinal to eighth
in the MPSF. meaning that they will
now play at No. 8 Cal State
Northridge in the play-in match for
the conference playoffs.
Despite the losses this weekend.
Shaw said he is optimistic.
"I'm really proud of the way our
guys played," he said. "Out of the
eight games that we played this
weekend, we had a legitimately good
chance to win six of the eight, even
seven of the eight. We won two, but
we had our chances to win a lot of
other games. We need to just close
the deal. We're outmatched a lot of
the time, but we hang in there and we
get our chances to win. We need to be
able to execute to make sure we win
those close games."
