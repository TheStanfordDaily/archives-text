# Softball perfect in Oregon
## No.8 Cardinal hand OSU's McGowan her first Pac-10 loss 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
In the first game, Stanford's
pitchers took care of business; in
the next, the Cardinal hatters did
the work. And in the final game of
the Stanford softball team's three
game set in Oregon, the rain de
layed play fora couple of hours be
fore the Cardinal prevailed again.
Freshman third baseman
Michelle Smith homered in all
three games and tied former All-
American Jessica Mendoza for the
Stanford single-season home run
record with her 15th in a 9-5 win
Sunday.
With its three wins over the
weekend, Stanford improved to 31 -
7 overall and 6-2 in the Pacific-10
Conference.
Rookie starters provided major
sparks for the Cardinal Friday
night, as the team's 3-0 win
snapped the Beavers' 22-game win
streak and handed them their first
conference loss.
The Cardinal bats were quiet in
Friday's 3-0 win over No. 10 Ore
gon State (29-7, 8-1), as spectators

in Corvallis, Ore., witnessed a clas
sic Pac-10 pitcher's duel. Freshman
phenom Becky McCullough (12-1)
took the circle for Stanford while
Brianne McGowan, who entered
the weekend with a 1.84 ERA and
a 25-3 record, pitched for the Pac
-10 leading Beavers.
McCullough continued her
dominance in conference play, lim
iting the Beavers to three hits over
seven innings of work while her
teammates managed to push runs
across the plate against OSU's ace
in the first and final innings of the
game.
Smith recorded the game-win
ning hit in the first. With junior
shortstop Lauren Lappin on after a
single. Smith drilled a two-run
homer over the centerfield fence.
McGowan settled down after
the first and kept the Beavers with
in two runs until the seventh. Stan
ford freshman second baseman
Tricia Aggabao singled up the mid
dle and sophomore Jackie Rine
hart followed with an RBI triple to
right-centerfield. Smith and Ag
gabao both went 2-for-3 with a run
scored.
Stanford picked it up offensive
ly on Saturday against No. 25 Ore
gon (25-16, 3-7), exploding for 17
runs, 10 of which came in the
game's final frame. The Cardinal
went yard three times, including
Smith's 14th home run of the sea
son in the 17-7 win.

The Cardinal offense was heavi
ly aided by the Ducks' poor de
fense. After Lappin — who fin
ished 3-for-5 with two RBI — sin
gled in the first, senior catcher
Leah Nelson and Smith were both
hit to load the bases. Two errors
brought home Lappin and Nelson,
while Aggaboa, who went 3-for-4
with two RBI, added an RBI sin
gle.
After Stanford picked up a run
in the second to make it 4-0, Ore
gon's mistakes kept leading to its
undoing. A walk and a hit batsman
led off the inning. Senior Megan
Sickler reached on a fielder's
choice but freshman Anna Beard
man followed with a three-run
homer to make it 7-0.
Oregon closed the gap to 7-2 in
the fifth, but that was the closest it
would get, as Stanford scored 10
runs on nine hits in the seventh.
After a single by junior centerfield
er Catalina Morris and the inning's
first out. Stanford hit three straight
singles. The Cardinal scored seven
more runs by the time the next out
was made.
Smith hit her 14th home run this
year in grand fashion, clearing the
bases. Sophomore Linsday Key
capped off the barrage with a
three-run blast.
Stanford used three pitchers in
Saturday's matchup. Junior Laura

Senior outfielder Megan Sickler and the No. 8 Stanford softball team got a dominating pitching performance from
freshman Becky McCullough to shut down OSU on Friday before the offense exploded for 26 runs in two wins over
Oregon.
Severson started for the Cardinal
and allowed one run in 3.2 innings
but it was McCullough in relief
who picked up her second win of
the weekend. McCullough came
on in the third to end Oregon's
rally, working her way out of a
bases-loaded jam.
The Ducks did minimal damage
in the bottom the seventh, hitting
two RBI singles and a three-run
home run against sophomore
righty Danika Dukes.
While Stanford was ready to
head home early after Sunday's 1
p.m. start. Mother Nature had dif
ferent plans. Rain held up the
game for almost two hours before
the first pitch was finally thrown
around 2:40 p.m.
Stanford's bats remained hot
from Saturday, however, and the
Cardinal wrapped up the weekend
with a 9-5 win.
Stanford now readies itself fora
doubleheader Wednesday against
Cal State-Sacramento and Sacra
mento State before hosting cross
bay rival California on Friday. The
Cardinal then head to Berkeley for
their fourth and fifth games of the
week on Saturday and Sunday.
