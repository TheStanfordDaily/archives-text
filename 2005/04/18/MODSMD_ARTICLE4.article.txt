# Chavez celebration ends with words from a friend
## 
### CHRIS PEDREGAL 
The week-long Cesar Chavez
Commemoration celebration came to
a close Friday with a final presenta
tion in Dinkelspiel Auditorium that
synthesized the themes explored
throughout the week — unifying
Chavez's life with the struggles that
Latinos face today.
Keynote speaker Monsignor Eu
gene Boyle, a retired priest of the Dio
cese of San Jose and a friend of
Chavez, spoke about his experiences
working in the labor movement to win
rights for farm workers.
He emphasized the role of the
Catholic Church in the movement, ex

plaining that it was not only about pol
itics, but also about faith.
"[Chavez] was a very spiritual man
and that affected everything that he
did," Boyle said.
Freshman Martha Alvarez, the
hospitality chair for the event, said she
thought the program was very suc
cessful.
"A lot of work was put into it and it
was very well planned," she said.
Though the events throughout the
week had been well attended, not as
many people as expected showed up
for the final show. Alvarez said she
was a little disappointed by the
turnout.
"I wish more Latinos were aware

about these issues," she added. "I
think a lot of Stanford students might
not know who Chavez was."
Chris Gonzalez Clarke, the assis
tant director of the El Centro Chicano
community center, said he believes
the Cesar Chavez celebration is very
important and meaningful for the en
tire Stanford community, not just the
11 percent of the student body that is
Latino.
"This event is for anyone who is
concerned with social change and
wants to know how an individual can
make a difference," Clarke said,
adding that he does not believe that
there has been a decrease in student
interest over the past years.
"Now there is a diversity of is
sues," he said. "Before, when Chavez
was alive, there was one main issue
that everyone cared about — the
farm workers."
Alvarez agreed that there are
many different issues and challenges
facing Latinos today.

" This celebration is a good time
for Latinos to come together and
learn about these issues," she said.
"The Latino community is very di
verse and everyone comes from dif
ferent backgrounds, so not everyone
knows a lot about the farm workers'
movement."
Both Clarke and Alvarez said they
want to see the commemoration fes
tivities continue in the future. The tra
dition is especially important now —
12 years after Chavez's death — since
the younger students are less aware of
Chavez's message, Clarke said.
"I couldn't make it to Chavez's fu

neral. but not going has been one of
my biggest regrets," he added. "Fifty
thousand people went to the funeral,
and the Stanford students that came
back were so energized and hopeful. I
wish 1 could have been there. That is
why it is important that we continue
the annual celebration, so we can
keep that energy and the faith in non
violence alive."
At the close of his speech, Boyle
lifted his fist and shouted "Viva
Chavez, Viva!" It's this spirit, coordi
nators said, that they hope to keep
alive by continuing the tradition for
years to come.
