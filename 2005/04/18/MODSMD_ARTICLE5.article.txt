## Alum campaigns in Texas 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Some would argue that Julian Castro doesn't need pub
lic relations to make him look like the perfect politician.
He was born on Mexican Independence Day, grew up
in a mostly Mexican-American neighborhood in San An
tonio, and attended Stanford University and Harvard Law
School. Then, with all of the opportunities in the world, he
went back home.
Castro, Class of 1996, is trying to become the next mayor
of San Antonio — the eighth largest city in the United
States with a population of more than 1.2 million people.
He graduated at the top of his class at San Antonio's
Thomas Jefferson High School, home of the Mighty Mus
tangs. Arriving at Stanford in 1992, along with his identical
twin Joaquin, Castro graduated with honors and distinction
and a double major in communication and political science.
Harvard Law School was the next stop for the Castro
brothers after a brief hiatus in San Antonio. In 2001, Julian
Castro returned to San Antonio and became the youngest
city council member ever elected.
Castro remembered fondly

then again. Castro has youth and

American west side, where Ins moth

People at Stanford loudly re

one seems surprised that Julian is a
contender lor mayor or that his
brother Joaquin serves in the Texas
Stale I louse of Representatives.
I remember him being a bridge

recalled seeing Castro at the com
munity center during his lime at
Stanford and said she is very proud
of him.
"lie was very well-liked and re
spected." she said. "Me was in the
ASM ) and tome that meant that you
had to be able to work."
And work he did. Moth he and his
brother wrote honors theses about
economic development in San Anto
nio; Julian's was entitled "The
Urban Prosperity Myth: San Anto
nio's I conomic Development in the

|W7()s." Political Science Prof. Luis
Fraga, Castro's thesis advisor, and
said he remembers the first day he
met the brothers when they enrolled
in his urban politics class.
"I just remember these identical
twins who sat right in the middle of
the class." I raga said with a chuckle.
'They came to talk to me after class.
1 remember them saying they were
from San Antonio."
Castro's hometown has always
had a strong hold on him. and his
brother as well. Fraga said it was al
ways apparent to him that they in
tended to go back to San Antonio
one day.
"I was always surprised by how
genuine their commitment was: not to
hold office, not to Ix; a power broker
but to contribute," Fraga added.
"There was something about the way
they understood pities — that it was
a responsibility, not a game."
Castro turned his honors thesis
into his campaign strategy this year:
promotes economic development
for San Antonio with his "Smart
Growth — Knowledge Economy
Agenda." I le refers to this as transi
tioning from a "smiles-based econo
my" based on tourism to a "files
based economy" dependent on
knowledge and the high-tech sector.
I Jsing this approach, Fraga said.
Castro is able to branch-out and be
more than just an ethnic politician.
('astro's goal is to represent all of San

Antonio, not just Latinos.
"1 am very proud of him." Fraga
said, "He fully understands that the
best leaders are the ones who help
people reconcile differences in a way
that helps them grow."
Luz I lerrera. Class of 1995. now a
lawyer in Compton, met the Castro
brothers when she was the resident as
sistant in Casa Zapata. She said they
became even better acquainted when
they attended law school together.
"They were always just well put
together, siempre peinaditos |well
groomedj," she said. "Very charis
matic, very easy to talk to."
Herrera remembered Julian as
very responsible and said she would
vote for him if she lived in San Anto
nio. It's simple, she said, because he
represents the future.
"The truth of the matter is that I
think elected officials need to repre
sent the city they serve, and San An
tonio is a very young. Latino city,"
Herrera said. "So who better than
Julian to represent that interest, to
represent who that city is about?"
When interviewed, Castro
pointed to a Daily article published
on April 28, 1995. Accompanying
the article is a picture of the broth
ers sitting back-to-back on the
Rosetta in the Main Quad with
Memorial Church in the back
ground. In the story, it's evident
that the two already had politics on
the brain.
