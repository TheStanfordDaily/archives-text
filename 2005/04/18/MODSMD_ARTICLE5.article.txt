Some would argue that Julian Castro doesn't need pub
lic relations to make him look like the perfect politician.
He was born on Mexican Independence Day, grew up
in a mostly Mexican-American neighborhood in San An
tonio, and attended Stanford University and Harvard Law
School. Then, with all of the opportunities in the world, he
went back home.
Castro, Class of 1996, is trying to become the next mayor
of San Antonio â€” the eighth largest city in the United
States with a population of more than 1.2 million people.
He graduated at the top of his class at San Antonio's
Thomas Jefferson High School, home of the Mighty Mus
tangs. Arriving at Stanford in 1992, along with his identical
twin Joaquin, Castro graduated with honors and distinction
and a double major in communication and political science.
Harvard Law School was the next stop for the Castro
brothers after a brief hiatus in San Antonio. In 2001, Julian
Castro returned to San Antonio and became the youngest
city council member ever elected.
