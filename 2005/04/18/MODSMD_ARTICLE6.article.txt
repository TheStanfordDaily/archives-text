## 
### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
San Antonio mayoral candidate Julian Castro spoke
with The Stanford Daily about April 12 on his Stanford
experience and life in politics.
The Daily: Where did you live when you were at Stan
ford?
Julian Castro: I lived in Soto the fist year, and then I lived
in Lagunita the last three years — Naranja and I think my
last year I was in Eucalypto.
TD: What student groups were you involved with?
JC: I was in Derechos [the Latino pre-law group] and the
ASSU [as a senator]. (He was also an RAin Naranja and
involved with the Stanford Democrats.)
Candidate proud of hometown

II): When did you lirsl know you
wiinled to he involved with politics?
11 ere at Stanford?
JC: I think in college. When I was at
Stanford, getting to see the Hay
Area and getting to compare that to
where I grew up and seeing the chal
lenges and opportunities in San An
tonio.
11): I low do you feel Stanford con
tributed to or prepared you fora ca
reer in politics?
JC: It gave me a sense of different
peispectives and applications for
different perspectives and an order
ly way of analyzing problems — in
terms of learning how to write well,
learning how to problem solve well.
I I): What are some anecdotes you
feel accurately capture your Stan
ford experience?
JC: I think probably when you get
there and everybody yells out your
name, it's a very welcoming envi
ronment compared to a lot of other
places. I went to Harvard Law
School, and Stanford seemed to go
out of its way to support you.
II): What made you choose Stan
ford over the others schools that ac
cepted you?
JC: I think, well, first it was one that
both my brother and I both got into,
and it felt like a welcoming place.
11): I low helpful was it to have your
brother here with you?
JC: It was important because we
hadn't been away much from home
at that point. It blunted some of the
culture-shock, for lack of a better
word. It was a much bigger school
than we were used to a much
more diverse school. Lite May Area
in general had a much more devel
oping economy; San Antonio has a
much more family-oriented atmos
phere.
Tl>: Do you feel that students who
attend prestigious institutions such
as Stanford and Harvard have a
civic responsibility? What about
Latino students particularly?
JC: I think anybody who has gotten

great opportunities has a responsi
bility to use them to benefit others.
It is particularly meaningful for Lati
nos because past generations were
closed oil from those opportunities.
I'D: What do you love about San
Antonio that makes you so passion
ate about it?
JC: I think that it's a town of hard
working and straightforward people
that is diverse in its own right, and
it's a big city but it still feels like a
small town.
I'D: What did you like about Stan
lord and the Bay Area? Where did
you hangout?
JC: Just there at the coffee house
and in the dorm. We didn't have a
car or a bike. I didn't even hang out
in Palo Alto.
I D: What did you like least about
Stanford?
JC: I think probably that it was dis
connected from the real world, so to
speak—just in terms of you have
everything there.
I'D: I low important was the Latino
community when you were here at
Stanford? What about in San Anto
nio?
JC: Very important. Professor
I raga and other students were a
great support system. It's also very
important [in San Antonio] and to
me — but also to the city. The Lati
no community has helped build San
Antonio.
I'D: In light of your making CNN's
" Pop live in "05"list Alberto Gon
zales' appointment to U.S. attorney
general and President George W.
Bush's supposed large Hispanic
vote-share, do you ever feel like a
political commodity?
JC: No. 1 think because there have
been other Latino politicians that
have succeeded, there is a special
meaning to a Latino community.
But more and more we are able to
be judged just on the merits of our
candidacy. One of the things is that 1
love seeing Latinos succeed because
it is a big inspiration to others; I

know 1 enjoyed seeing |former San
Antonio mayor] Henry Cisneros
succeed here in the 80s.
I'D: What made you want to run for
city council? For mayor?
JC: I wanted to run for council be
cause I felt like I could make a dif
ference in improving the neighbor
hoods 1 represent and try to bring
better economic development to
San Antonio.
Tl): You said once in an interview
that you haven't ruled-out running
for governor. Do you still feel the
same way?
JC: 1 think we have a lot of work to
do here with development, the com
munity. 11 want to focus] on people
who don't necessarily have a lot. but
have a lot of potential — the home
less and folks who are lower income.
1 wouldn't rule out anything in the
future, but there is no way to plan
for that.
TD: What is San Antonio's place on
a national scale, do you think?
JC: An emerging first-tier city, I
think overall, because it looks like
America is going to look in the fu
ture.
TD: How involved are you with the
Democratic Party?
JC: With the traditional party, not
very much, because I have been in a
non-partisan position. I'm a Demo
crat, but my brother has been a lot
more involved since he is in the state
legislature.
TD: Who is endorsing your run for
mayor?
JC: 1 have the endorsements of two
former mayors, Cisneros and Bill
Thornton, the AFL-CIO. the Sierra
Club, the San Antonio Firefighters
and the Texas League of Conserva
tion Voters.
TD: Where do you usually hang out
in San Antonio?
JC: Probably. Rosario's restaurant.
But these days I'm pretty much
hanging out around my campaign
office.
