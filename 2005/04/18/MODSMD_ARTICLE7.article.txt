# Econ. lecturer departs for Wellesley
## 
### SARAH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
Economics Lecturer David Johnson, who is
praised by students for his lively lecturing style, is
teaching his last quarter at Stanford before depart
ing to Wellesley College. His wife, Anne Pringle,
has accepted an assistant professorship in Har

yard's Department of Organismic and Evolution
ary Biology.
"We knew all along that our time in California
would probably be limited to my wife's three-year
post-doctoral fellowship at UC Berkeley," said
Johnson, who announced his decision to leave last
summer. "Had Stanford been seeking junior facul
tv in my wife's field, we most certainly would have

considered staying."
Students who have taken Johnson's classes are
overwhelmingly enthusiastic about the instructor,
noting his energized teaching style and his tenden
cy to tie concepts to current events.
"He's the best professor I've had at Stanford,"
said sophomore Stayan Gajwani,
who is currently taking his third class
from Johnson. "He's very good at ex
plaining concepts and saying why
they apply to the real world. He
spends the first 10 to 15 minutes of
class talking about something that's
going on in the world and explaining
why and how it's relevant."
Other students touched on his
unique lecturing style.
"He brings a certain intensity to
class that makes you want to pay at
tention and work hard." said junior
Adam Eichner who chose to take
"Development Economics" this
quarter specifically because Johnson

is the teacher.
Johnson said he strives to make
his courses "interesting, important
and relevant," and said he recognizes
the liveliness of lectures.
"1 suppose I'm a bit animated in
lecture," Johnson said. "But how can
one not be excited about social secu
rity reform or tradable pollution per
mits?"
As Johnson's time at Stanford
comes to a close, his students say they
are disappointed not to be able to
take more classes from him in the fu
ture.
"People for the most part are sad
to see him go because he's a really
good lecturer," said junior Ben Back
es. "I think people wish he would be
around more so they could take more
classes from him. Also, there's less in
centive to get to know him now since
he won't be here next year, which is

too had."
Johnson said he will miss both the
students and staff at Stanford in addi
tion to "the endless office-hour dis
cussions with students about matters
both sublime and ridiculous" and
"the kind e-mails, letters, comments
and evaluations from the students
concerning the extent of my teach
ing's impact on their lives."
As he looks to the future, Johnson
said he hopes to reform mathematics
education in the United States so that
gender bias is no longer an issue. In
the long-term, he thinks he will return
to secondary school teaching.
"1 could indeed teach economics
at the college level for the rest of my
career and continue to enjoy the ful
fillment 1 have at Stanford." Johnson
said. "As a hopeless idealist, howev
er. 1 know my value added is greater
at the secondary level."
