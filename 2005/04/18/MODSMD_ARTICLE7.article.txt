praised by students for his lively lecturing style, is
teaching his last quarter at Stanford before depart
ing to Wellesley College. His wife, Anne Pringle,
has accepted an assistant professorship in Har

"We knew all along that our time in California
would probably be limited to my wife's three-year
post-doctoral fellowship at UC Berkeley," said

summer. "Had Stanford been seeking junior facul

considered staying."
Students who have taken Johnson's classes are
overwhelmingly enthusiastic about the instructor,
noting his energized teaching style and his tenden
cy to tie concepts to current events.
