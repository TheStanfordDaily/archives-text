# Students dress up for QSA drag ball

### DANIEL NOVINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Several hundred women in suits, men in dresses and students in every
imaginable costume converged in Tresidder's Oak Room Saturday
night for Genderfuk, Stanford's annual drag ball. The event gave stu
dents not only a reason to party, but also one to support gender aware
ness issues.
The Queer / Straight Alliance, or QSA, has helped promote Gen
derfuk for more than 10 years. This year, the QSA advertised more
heavily than in years past, promoting the event not only at Stanford, but
also at seven other local universities. Anyone with a college ID was wel
come at the party, which featured performances from 12 student groups
and the professional drag hip-hop group Nappy Grooves.
"It's unique," said senior Hannah Leslie, president of the QSA. "Just
look at the crowd dressed up in drag. People are having fun in a unique
environment. The event lets students perform, and lets everyone fuck
with gender. Genderfuk gives us visibility on campus, but mostly it's just
fun."
Leslie added that Genderfuk may be the last QSA-sponsored party
of the year, although there might be a queer formal in May.
Senior Hunter Hargraves, who hosted the show under the name Fe
licia Fellation, said that he feels the event filled an essential role at Stan
ford.
"Genderfuk is important because it's important to defy gender,"
Hargraves said. "It's okay for anybody to dress as a girl, as a boy or an
drogynously. Drag is an art and this party is yet another example of a
group doing art at Stanford."
Among the students dressed in drag was co-terminal student Bo
Barfield, who arrived clad as a prostitute.
"I sort of want to be the head mistress of all the whores in New Or
leans," Barfield said.
Many of the students at Genderfuk said they enjoyed all the cos
tumes and the overall atmosphere.
"The event gives me good vibes," said senior Bonnie Johnson, who
attended the party. "I came to show solidarity with the community and
have a good time."
Freshman Sawyer Cohen said he enjoyed watching his roommate,
Fareez Giga, perform.
"I love to see people pushed beyond their normal boundaries,"
Cohen said.
