EMIO GRECO | PC
Intense, physical, and spellbinding, award-winning Emio Greco
PC makes its West Coast debut at Stanford with a program
that compellingly conveys the struggles between body and
mind. Classical one moment, tribal and gutsy the next, Greco's
Rimasto Orfano (Abandoned Orphan) is a provocative vision on
duality, time, and place. A free post-performance discussion is
open to the public.
