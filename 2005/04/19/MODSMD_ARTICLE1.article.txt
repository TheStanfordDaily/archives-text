# Gas line accidentally cut
## Central campus roped off to shield passersby from fumes 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
Fire trucks, police cars and traffic con
trollers swarmed central campus yesterday af
ternoon after a contractor accidentally rup
tured a natural gas line outside the Terman En
gineering Annex. The safety workers blocked
off Duena Street and Escondido Mall from
1:45-3 p.m. to keep students out of harm's way.
According to Cpt. Patrick Morris of the
Palo Alto Fire Department, the Terman Engi
neering Annex is under renovation, and a con
tractor that was working on the exterior unin
tentionally broke the gas line as he drove a scis
sor lift over the area.
Fortunately, because there was little wind at
the time of the incident, none of the gas from
the outdoor pipeline entered nearby buildings,
Morris said. The gas was less dense than the air,
so it rose and dissipated quickly, he added.
Still, Morris said that bicycle, pedestrian
and vehicle traffic was redirected to prevent
passersby from inhaling the gas. The blockade
was also created as a precautionary measure in

case of a sudden explosion — an unlikely pos
sibility, according to Morris. A large group of
firefighters was standing by in case the situa
tion took a sudden turn for the worse.
Due to the renovations, no students, staff or
faculty were inside of the Terman Engineering
Annex when the leak occurred. Morris said.
Although the contractor sent the construction
workers home, no one was forced to evacuate
adjacent buildings because the gas was concen
trated outdoors.
Morris said that this type of accident com
monly occurs during renovation projects.
"During remodeling projects, things such as
gas lines aren't always where they're expected
to be," he said. "So I wouldn't say that this in
cident was due to bad work practice."
Morris added that the Terman Engineering
Annex is part of old campus, and because it
was constructed so long ago, the records of
pipeline locations are more inaccurate and in
complete than in newer buildings.
Morris indicated that the pipeline rupture
should not reflect poorly on Stanford Facilities
Operations.
"In general my experience has been that the
University is very safe and conscientious dur
ing renovation projects," he said. "Stanford is
always looking to make things safer in the fu
ture."
