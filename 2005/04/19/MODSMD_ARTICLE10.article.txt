On April 19, 1940, 'Hie Daily pub
lished a preview of the Junior Prom,
featuring the "Aristocrat of Jazz:
Duke Ellington." Below is an excerpt:
"Duke Ellington, the creator of a
new vogue in modern dance music
and his orchestra will play in the
Pavilion tonight from y to 1 o?clock
for I,(XX) dancers at Stanford'.'s semi
formal Junior Prom.
"When 'Sophisticated Lady,'
the Duke's famous theme song, sig
nals 'sign-off time,' those 500 danc
ing couples will have heard four
hours of distinctive rhythm, weird
melody, and amazing syncopation
— handled by Ellington and his
crew of 13. Ivie Anderson, famous
negro vocalist, will sing with the or
chestra.
"Feature of the evening will be a
45-minute floor show from the or

chestra, during which time the Duke
and his band will play the swing tem
pos that have made his name synony
mous with a new, creative tendency in
American music.
"Late yesterday afternoon less
than 25 bids were still available at the
A.S.S.U. office. Priced at $3.50, they

April 19, 19M, The Daily covered
the Idlest developments in an ongoing
row between students and administra
tion over parking ticket fines. Below is
an excerpt:
"Dean of Students Joel Smith has
filed with the interim Judicial Body
(1JB) notice of intention to appeal the
student Judicial Council's decision
which stated that students no longer
have to pay Stanford parking fines.

"The judicial council refuses to
recognize the jurisdiction of the IJB.
an all-faculty body.
"Smith told The Daily Wednesday
that the case raises again the question
of the council's disputed authority to
invalidate University regulations.
"The council ruled last Friday that
the University cannot force students
to pay parking tickets while it allows
hundreds of faculty and staff to ignore
them.
"In the past, students with unpaid
fines have been denied permission to
re-register, but there has been no
punishment for delinquent faculty
and staff members.
"Since September, over 800 tick
ets of 22,000 issued have gone unpaid.
Most of the 8(X) belong to faculty and
staff.
"Parking fines are $2 if paid
promptly. The money goes into the
University general fund.
"Meanwhile, Vice President for
Business Affairs Alf Brandin is orga
nizing meetings between the business
staff and the Dean of Students office
to discuss enforcement of faculty
staff fines.
"One alternative they are consid
ering is taking delinquent ticket hold
ers to court, according to Don Carl
son. assistant director of University
relations."
