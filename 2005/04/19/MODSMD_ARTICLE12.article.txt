## Making globalization work for the poor 
### ADAM STONE LIJA MCHUGH 
Have you ever seen a "Fair Trade Certified"
logo on a bag of coffee? If you have, then you al
ready know the work of this week's social en
trepreneur. Paul Rice.
In 1998, Paul Rice founded TransFair, the
only independent certifier and promoter of Fair
Trade products in the United States. He has
been awarded an Ashoka Fellowship for Social
Entrepreneurship for his work on the behalf of
farmers in the developing world.
The Daily: What is the big idea behind Fair
Trade?
Paul Rice: Right now. everyone from activist or
ganizations to the World Bank itself is showing
us data that globalization has led to a dramatic
rise in trade and increased wealth.
But the questions is: Who is getting that
wealth? There are still three billion people who
are surviving on $2 a day. Globalization is not

solving that problem. Some
people even believe that it's
worsening that problem.
The big idea behind fair
trade is that you can actually
make globalization work for
the poor. We help communi
ties that are currently victims
of the market to become com
petitive, profitable players in
the market.
TD: In order to get Fair Trade

certification, companies must show that farmers
have been paid a lair price, among other things.
Doesn't this raise the cost for consumers?
PR: Fair trade does cost companies who are get
ting certified. From a business perspective, the
only way fair trade will work is if they can pass
that extra cost onto the consumer. At the end of
the day, fair trade will live or die by the con
sumer.
Consumers in this country are like a sleeping
giant. They are not indifferent to world poverty
— they just don't know about it or what to do to
change things.
Fair trade is not a boycott. It's more like a
"buy-cott". Let's buy from companies who are
trying to do the right thing. Let's buy from com
panies who have been independently audited
and certified to guarantee that their product
comes from farmers who got a fair price.
TD: Fair Trade requires not only labor stan
dards, but also environmental standards. What
does Fair Trade do for the environment?
PR: Fair trade products are typically certified
organic. We have very strong environmental
stewardship criteria within the fair trade stan
dard.
If you want to get certified, you cannot cut
down your forest. We require conservation and
reforestation. Farmers also have to protect their
soils and streams, as well as monitor how chem
icals are used, worker safety and health, and pest
management.
Fair trade and the environmentalist move
ment go hand in hand. You cannot save the trees
unless you help the people under the trees find
another option.
TD: How did you go from graduating from Yale
in 1983 to founding TransFair in 1998?
PR: I studied economics and political science as
an undergraduate and was really interested in
poverty and underdevelopment. Two months
out of college, I went to Nicaragua to stay for
year and get some hands-on experience in inter
national development.
I ended up staying for 11 years. During those
years. I worked on several different develop
ment projects, survived the war and lost a lot of
friends in the war. And this became my life.
After four years of working on fair trade in
Nicaragua, 1 decided that the most important
thing I could do with my life is to come back to
the States and put fair trade on the map.
I went to get an M.B.A. at Berkeley and
wrote the business plan for TransFair while I
was there. I spent a few years raising the money,
then launched it in 1998.
TD: Many students want to make the world a
better place. What advice do you have for them?
PR: Go live your dream. Don't let student loans
stop you. and don't take no for an answer. Use
your youth and the relative freedom of that to
explore.
For those of us who dream of a more sustain
able world, we should explore the possibility
that business and markets aren't the enemies.
In our era, the challenge is to find ways to
make business work for the poor — not to just
opt out. Our challenge is to figure out how the
system works and find a way to enrich the lives
of the poor, develop those communities and
make it all work.
