# Thinking and building green
## 
### LAUREN DIETRICH 
When people think of pollution, they
think of cars spouting out exhaust. They
think pesticides seeping into the soils and
into pristine forests.
They don't often think about the build
ings they live and work in.
According to the United States Green
Buildings Council, or USGBC, buildings in
the United States represent 36 percent of
total energy use, 30 percent of greenhouse
gas emissions, 30 percent of raw material
use, 12 percent of potable water consump
tion and 30 percent of our waste.
Faced with complex environmental
problems, many universities are stepping
up to the challenge by designing and con
structing sustainable buildings.
The USGBC has developed a Leader
ship in Energy and Environmental Design,
or LEED, rating system that attributes
points to different sustainable building fea
tures, resulting in a scorecard and an overall
rating (certified, silver, gold, platinum) that
summarizes the extent to which a building
operates in a sustainable way.
In order to build and run greener build
ings, architects and developers can incorpo
rate local, recycled and sustainable harvest
ed materials, use native plants for landscap
ing, minimize pavement to allow for slow
discharge of storm water to municipal sew
ers, minimize construction waste and mini
mizing the use of energy and water.
Carnegie Mellon University, Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology, state
funded colleges in Arizona and Washington
and the University of North Carolina have
all committed to achieving the LEED silver
rating in all future development. Many other
universities have committed to the lower
level of LEED certification, and several
schools, including Stanford, have written
their own sustainable building guidelines,
often closely related to LEED standards.
The Bren School of Environmental Sci
ence and Management at the UC-Santa
Barbara has taken sustainable building to
the next level by designing the Donald Bren
Hall, the most sustainable building in the
country, and one of the few that has
achieved a LEED platinum rating. The mo
mentum from this building's success led to
the university's development of a campus
sustainability office and guided UCSB's ac
ceptance of LEED silver as the minimum
standard for future development.
"The Bren School is based on the
premise that there are workable solutions
to many environmental problems," said
Prof, of Snow Hydrology, Earth System Sci
ence and Remote Sensing Jeff Dozier, who
was Dean of the Bren School during the
planning and construction of Bren Hall.
Dozier said one of the challenges of sus
tainable development is that the construc
tion and operations budgets are paid from
different pots of money. Although one enti
ty is usually responsible for an overall uni
versity budget, the development and facili
ties operations divisions are usually sepa
rated. each still driven to minimize their
own budgets without fully taking into ac
count what is most effective for the univer
sity as a whole for the long term. Sustain
able buildings, however, need to take into
account both budgets in order to design the
most efficient and environmentally-friendly
building.
The key to achieving success is often fac
ulty and administration input and involve
ment.
"In typical construction on campus, the
faculty member / future building occupant
is only interested in the design / layout of
their future space," said Mo Lovegreen,
who was Managing Staff Officer for the

Bren School while Bren Hall was in con
struction.
Lovegreen explained that sustainable
building features are often lost in value en
gineering because no one stands up for their
long-term value.
"We need to educate our administrators
as well as the folks in the field on the bene
fits of going green." Lovegreen added.
Indeed, sustainable building success sto
ries on our Stanford campus have had at
their root faculty members who. during the
building planning process, constantly reiter
ated their commitment to developing a sus
tainable building to Stanford's Project
Management division of Land and Build
ings.
Examples of sustainable buildings at

Stanford include the Leslie Sun Shao Ming
Field Station at the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve and the new Carnegie Center for
Global Ecology. Similar to Donald Bren
Hall, these buildings faced myriad chal
lenges and opportunities in demanding sus
tainability as central to the programmatic
mission, since they required project teams
to consider building lifecycle during the de
sign and construction process.
" The reason for [Leslie Shao-Ming Sun
Field Station's] success was the commit
ment of the team, particularly the building
users, to find sustainable solutions that
worked with their program objectives," said
Laura Goldstein, a project manger who
worked on this recently completed Stan
ford building.

Examples of sustainable buildings at

Stanford include the Leslie Sun Shao Ming
Field Station at the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve and the new Carnegie Center for
Global Ecology. Similar to Donald Bren
Hall, these buildings faced myriad chal
lenges and opportunities in demanding sus
tainability as central to the programmatic
mission, since they required project teams
to consider building lifecycle during the de
sign and construction process.
" The reason for [Leslie Shao-Ming Sun
Field Station's] success was the commit
ment of the team, particularly the building
users, to find sustainable solutions that
worked with their program objectives," said
Laura Goldstein, a project manger who
worked on this recently completed Stan
ford building.
