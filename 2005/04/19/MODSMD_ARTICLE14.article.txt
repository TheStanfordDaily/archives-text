# Virgin paper: how Stanford is killing forests
## 
### COLIN MILLER EMMA YUEN GUEST COLUMNISTS 
Close your eyes fora moment and pic
ture a forest ecosystem, a thriving com
munity of interconnected plants and ani
mals. including about 6,000 trees. Then
imagine that this forest has been clear
cut, now devoid of the living giants whose
roots once stabilized the soil.
Six thousand is the approximate num
ber of trees logged on behalf of Stanford
University every year. According to
Peninsula Sanitary Services, the company
that runs the Stanford Recycling Center,
in 1998 Stanford used 13,500 reams of 8.5
by 11-inch paper in an average month.
That's a total of 81 million sheets of
paper per year.
You would be hard-pressed to find
many at Stanford advocating for defor
estation and environmental destruction.
It is important to recognize that at an elite
educational institution such as Stanford,

education and the dissemination of
knowledge requires a lot of paper. Is
there a way to conserve precious natural
resources without compromising our aca
demic imperative?
Some would say that the most appro
priate resolution to this problem is to use
more recycled paper. Returning fora mo
ment to our hypothetical forest, it is re
vealing to note that, according to the
Stanford Recycling Center, out of all
American forests logged commercially,
42 percent of the national timber harvest
becomes pulpwood and is destined for
the manufacture of paper and paper
products.
Purchasing recycled paper instead of
virgin paper could theoretically prevent
the logging of millions of trees every year.
The production of recycled paper also uses
less than half as much energy and water
(60 and 58 percent less, respectively) and
contributes far less to both air and water
pollution than virgin paper manufacturing

(74 and 35 percent less, respectively).
There are actually two varieties of re
cycled paper. Most paper mills recycle
"pre-consumer waste," employing old,
unused scraps from previous production
processes. According to the Buy Recy
cled Business Alliance, a consortium of
eco-conscious businesses, most unused
paper — about 90 percent — ends up in
peoples' homes and businesses, where it
is discarded within a year.
And unless this paper is recycled, it
will end up either in the nation's rapidly
filling landfills or burned. When this
paper is recycled, it becomes a feedstock
for the paper industry and is then called
"post-consumer waste" paper. Although
the federal government and many state
and local governments mandate the use
of 30 percent post-consumer waste paper
for government offices, virgin paper still
comprises 90 percent of all paper on the
market today.
The crucial benefit of recycling paper

made from post-consumer waste is that it
prevents more trees from being logged
for paper production and channels a
waste stream into a useful and mar
ketable commodity. This is known as
"closing the resource loop." Unless more
consumers demand or post-consumer
waste paper, the "resource loop" in the
paper production process remains open
to the logging of many more trees and
greater pollution.
With all of these clear environmental
benefits, why hasn't Stanford committed
to purchasing 100 percent post-consumer
waste paper? One explanation is simple
economics. Stanford, along with over
1,500 other schools, hospitals and other
large-scale institutions, is a member of
the Educational and Institutional Buying
Consortium. Members of this coopera
tive can purchase 100 percent post-con
sumer waste recycled paper — known as
Aspen 100 — but as a result of
much lower demand. Aspen 100 is
significantly more expensive than
virgin paper as offered through the
consortium.
While post-consumer waste
paper appears prohibitively expen
sive, there are precedents at other
universities indicating that this may
not always be the case.
Last April at Princeton Univer
sity, the student group Greening
Princeton persuaded the university
administration after a two-year
campaign that it was in everyone's
best interest to purchase 100 per
cent post-consumer waste recycled
paper for everyday use. Armed
with a mandate to purchase only
post-consumer waste paper,
Princeton Procurement was able to
renegotiate its paper-buying con
tract with Boise Cascade, lowering
the price of PCW paper in a special
wholesale deal so that its cost was
comparable to that of virgin paper.
According to Stefani Fukushi
ma, the manager for campus-wide
agreements at Stanford's Procure
ment Department, only 18 percent
of general office products pur
chased through Corporate Ex
press, Stanford's office supplier, in
clude recycled content. According
to the Princetonian Daily, most col
leges and universities in the coun
try buy 30 percent post-consumer
waste recycled paper.
"In order to make 100 percent
post-consumer waste paper cheap
er, more schools can make the com
mitment that Princeton made,
mandating 100 percent post-con
sumer waste paper," said Kim Carl

son, a graduate student in the Earth
Systems department, who has been
studying this issue. "This will give E
& I the leverage to negotiate lower
prices on 100 percent PCW with
Boise or another supplier."
Why else does a world-class edu
cational institution like Stanford fall
so far behind others in this arena?
Although some academic depart
ments, such as Anthropological Sci
ences, Comparative Studies in Race
and Ethnicity and German Studies
have committed themselves to using
100 percent recycled post-consumer
waste paper, these examples are the
exceptions to the rule.
According to Kiira Mancasola, a
junior and former recycling intern
with Peninsula Sanitary Services,
"Individual departments, who are
responsible for buying their own
paper, are just set in their ways;
there's a stigma about post-con
sumer waste paper because people
don't know that it's of equal quali
ty [to virgin paper)."
Mancasola's work as an intern
with Peninsula Sanitary Services at
the Stanford Recycling Center con
sisted primarily of debunking pre
vailing myths about recycled paper.
The first myth is that it is of inferior
quality to virgin paper. According to
information supplied by the Buy Re
cycled Business Alliance, in 1998,
the U.S. Council of Mayors conduct
ed a study with the Government
Printing Office to determine the rel
ative quality of 30-percent PCW
paper compared with virgin paper.
The study determined that there was
virtually no change in performance
from virgin to recycled paper.
The study also debunked anoth
er common misconception regard
ing PCW recycled paper: that it
jams up in copy machines. One in
dication of the fallacy of this idea is
that FedEx Kinko's employs post

consumer waste recycled content
paper in many of its copy machines,
including the campus branch, at
which post-consumer waste paper
is available upon request.
All of these facts aside, what has
Stanford done about this pressing
and timely issue? For over five
years. Peninsula Sanitary Services
and Stanford's on-campus recy
cling center, have advocated con
sistently fora policy comparable to
Princeton's, but so far few results
are visible.
Although a "Buy Recycled Poli
cy" proposal was submitted last
April, immediately following the
events at Princeton University,
Stanford's top administrators have
not yet moved to accept an Envi
ronmentally Preferable Purchasing
Policy that would mandate a mini
mum of 30 percent post-consumer
waste-content recycled paper.
According to Therese Brekke, a
University planner and architect,
the Procurement Department held
a fair last May to educate depart
ments on the issue of PCW-content
recycled paper.
Concerned students such as
Becca Miller, a sophomore, say
that it is often easy for institutions
to maintain the status quo, even
with the best intentions in mind.
"We feel that if Princeton did it.
so can we," said Miller. "But we
need more administrators to take
proactive steps towards making
Stanford a more sustainable
place."

Don't forget to recycle this paper
when everyone's had the chance to
read it.
