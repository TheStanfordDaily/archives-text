# Virgin paper: how Stanford is killing forests

### COLIN MILLER EMMA YUEN GUEST COLUMNISTS 
Close your eyes fora moment and pic
ture a forest ecosystem, a thriving com
munity of interconnected plants and ani
mals. including about 6,000 trees. Then
imagine that this forest has been clear
cut, now devoid of the living giants whose
roots once stabilized the soil.
Six thousand is the approximate num
ber of trees logged on behalf of Stanford
University every year. According to
Peninsula Sanitary Services, the company
that runs the Stanford Recycling Center,
in 1998 Stanford used 13,500 reams of 8.5
by 11-inch paper in an average month.
That's a total of 81 million sheets of
paper per year.
You would be hard-pressed to find
many at Stanford advocating for defor
estation and environmental destruction.
It is important to recognize that at an elite
educational institution such as Stanford,

education and the dissemination of
knowledge requires a lot of paper. Is
there a way to conserve precious natural
resources without compromising our aca
demic imperative?
Some would say that the most appro
priate resolution to this problem is to use
more recycled paper. Returning fora mo
ment to our hypothetical forest, it is re
vealing to note that, according to the
Stanford Recycling Center, out of all
American forests logged commercially,
42 percent of the national timber harvest
becomes pulpwood and is destined for
the manufacture of paper and paper
products.
Purchasing recycled paper instead of
virgin paper could theoretically prevent
the logging of millions of trees every year.
The production of recycled paper also uses
less than half as much energy and water
(60 and 58 percent less, respectively) and
contributes far less to both air and water
pollution than virgin paper manufacturing

(74 and 35 percent less, respectively).
There are actually two varieties of re
cycled paper. Most paper mills recycle
"pre-consumer waste," employing old,
unused scraps from previous production
processes. According to the Buy Recy
cled Business Alliance, a consortium of
eco-conscious businesses, most unused
paper — about 90 percent — ends up in
peoples' homes and businesses, where it
is discarded within a year.
And unless this paper is recycled, it
will end up either in the nation's rapidly
filling landfills or burned. When this
paper is recycled, it becomes a feedstock
for the paper industry and is then called
"post-consumer waste" paper. Although
the federal government and many state
and local governments mandate the use
of 30 percent post-consumer waste paper
for government offices, virgin paper still
comprises 90 percent of all paper on the
market today.
The crucial benefit of recycling paper

made from post-consumer waste is that it
prevents more trees from being logged
for paper production and channels a
waste stream into a useful and mar
ketable commodity. This is known as
"closing the resource loop." Unless more
consumers demand or post-consumer
waste paper, the "resource loop" in the
paper production process remains open
to the logging of many more trees and
greater pollution.
With all of these clear environmental
benefits, why hasn't Stanford committed
to purchasing 100 percent post-consumer
waste paper? One explanation is simple
economics. Stanford, along with over
1,500 other schools, hospitals and other
large-scale institutions, is a member of
the Educational and Institutional Buying
Consortium. Members of this coopera
tive can purchase 100 percent post-con
sumer waste recycled paper — known as
