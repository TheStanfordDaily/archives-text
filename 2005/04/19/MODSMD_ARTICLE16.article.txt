## Editorial Bill on Armenian genocide falls outside of Senate's purview 
### 
Last week, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
passed a bill to commemorate the 90th anniversary of
the Armenian genocide of 1915. Calling this event
"the first genocide of the 20th century," the bill draws
a connection between the Armenian genocide and
"the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region
of the Sudan." Genocide is an important and timely
issue that the Stanford community should be aware
of, but that doesn't mean the Senate was right to pass
a bill on it.
A Senate meeting is not the proper setting for dis
cussing such a sensitive, non-campus-related issue.
The issue of the Armenian genocide remains hotly
contested, especially among the Turkish and Armeni
an communities at Stanford. Some still hesitate to
label the incidents of 1915 as "genocide," choosing to
use words like "massacre" or "atrocities" to describe
(he events instead. The Daily's editorial board is cer
tainly not in a position to evaluate these claims â€” but
neither, we believe, is the Senate.
We doubt that the individual senators appreciate
the political nuances of this issue sufficiently to make
an informed decision on the bill. Political naivete is re
flected in the bill's language, which comes across as
unnecessarily emotive. For example, it stridently de-

nounces "the denialist campaign of the Turkish
regime, which strives to falsify history and erase any
trace of the Armenian Genocide ..." Such strong lan
guage seems ill-suited to generating thoughtful de
hate on the issue among the student body.
Moreover, the Senate's decision to pass this bill
sets up a strange precedent for future Senate meet
ings. After deciding to commemorate an event that
took place 90 years ago, is the Senate going to com
memorate the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of
the Soviet Union, the Tiananmen Square incident?
While the Armenian Genocide deserves attention,
singling it out as the subject of a bill seems arbitrary.
We are also skeptical about how much of an impact
such bills are likely to make on the average Stanford
student's consciousness. In general, there are better
ways of raising awareness of pressing international is
sues such as genocide.
In this case, for instance, the Senate could work
with the Armenian Students Association to organize
activities to commemorate the event and educate
Stanford students at the same time. Such a course of
action would be much more visible and productive,
and would be more likely to start the kind of dialogue
that an event of such gravity deserves.
