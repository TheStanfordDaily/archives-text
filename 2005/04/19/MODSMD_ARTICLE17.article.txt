## The 						Day of Anti-Awareness 
### 
On April 13, students across the
country participated in "National
Day of Silence" to raise awareness
about anti-gay bias in high schools
and colleges. Whether or not inten
tionally silencing your protest is ef
fective I'll leave to you, but I will say
that the Day of Silence has grown by
leaps and bounds since its creation 10
years ago.
To counter this success, conserva-

lives have created the "National Day of Truth." Let's do
the math here: An anti-anti-gay-hias day means they are
for discrimination against gays?
No. the conservatives claim: they are respectful in
their protest.
Sure â€” They respectfully wear shirts that say "homo
sexuality is sinful" and also "damaging" and "wrong."
Somehow, that doesn't seem respectful to me. But
maybe they smile as they tell you your lifestyle choice is
wrong atid you're going to hell. Maybe that's what they
mean by respectful.
The thinking (yes, someone was thinking) behind the
event is that conservative Christians are a repressed pop
ulation. Previously, the organizers say. Christians have
been repressed when speaking out against homosexual
ity. First the lions in Roman times and now those tyran
nical "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" fellows? Chris
tians just can't get a break.
So here's what 1 propose. Let's have protests against
other marginalized groups. That way, those in power/
the majority can finally get their voice.
National Women's month will be countered by
Misogyny Month. Men will respectfully espouse the
virtues of sexism, citing Biblical passages that explain
how men are superior to women. They'll wear shirts
(wife-beaters actually) that say "Vaginas Are Shame

ful." The glass ceiling becomes a wall the Christian Right
rallies behind. Eve Ensler cowers as her reign of feminist
terror ends.
Then, after Black History Month, in March we can all
observe White Power Month. There, the organizers
hope people can respectfully speak about the virtues of
racism, citing Biblical passages about slavery. Then peo
ple can respectfully burn crosses on the front lawns of
certain members of the community. Pat Robertson will
channel the spirit of Strom Thurmond for the keynote
address. This will all be so that white conservative Chris
tians can finally get their voice.
The day after Deaf Awareness Day, adamant pro
speaking people will have a day that responds to the
"pro-deaf agenda," and reveal the truth about lifestyles
from a speaking Christian's point of view. It shall be
called the"Day of Cacophony" The protesters will hand
out pamphlets that say people who can't speak are not
exercising their first amendment right to free speech and
are therefore un-American.
Furthermore, since they believe sign language to be a
pact with the devil, they will urge deaf people to stop liv
ing their "destructive" lifestyle, begin speaking, and ac
cept Christ.
The protestors will wear shirts that say "The Truth is,
the Silent are not Truthful." The organizers of the event
say that the day's aim is not to attack deaf people, but to
give voice to the previously silenced non-deaf popula
tion.
Well, I'll admit, maybe these other days are unlike
ly. I'm just thankful the"Day of Truth" is here. Final
ly, conservative Christians can come together and be
unafraid of voicing their rabid hatred and intolerance.

Chris thinks a protest defending discrimination isn 7 an in
sult to the first amendment; its an insult to things that
breathe. Send complaints to cholt@stanford.edu
