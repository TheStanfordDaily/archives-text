Teach for America puts teachers where
they are needed
Regarding the article "Study raises questions about
Teach for America" (April 15): It is hard to argue with the
fact that many Teach for America teachers leave the pro
fession. But if you focus on what they do while they are in
the profession, you might have a different kind of story.
Of the uncredentialed new teachers entering the pro
fession, TEA teachers are more prepared. In my experi
ence, they are also very motivated and dedicated to mak
ing a difference in the life of a child. All of the TEA teach
ers I have known care about helping out their students and
do so every day.
More to the point, these young teachers are entering a
profession that is suffering from a shortage of qualified
and credentialed teachers. If there were an abundance of
qualified credentialed teachers waiting for openings, then
TFA would not need to exist. When that day comes, 1 am
sure TFA will close its doors.
The reality is that in many places, schools have a hard
time finding anyone to teach. It is in these places that
TFA puts teachers, and the hope is that a bright, ener
getic young teacher will give a group of students the
chance to receive a high-quality education. If not fora
program like Teach for America, many of these positions
would go unstaffed. with long term substitutes filling out
the year.
The study referred to in your article seems to be miss
ing the boat about the state of education today. It is a sad
day when the only way to know if a school or teacher is
successful is a standardized test score. Seems a lazy way to
find out whether people are quality teachers.
I don't care whether a TFA teacher can increase the

test scores more than a credentialed teacher. Most teach
ers are just trying to do what they feel is best for their stu
dents. Most students know and appreciate this.

Media perperpetuate falsehood that
America is at war
Although The Daily's call for an Iraq exit strategy
("Anyone know where the exit is?" April 15) is spot-on,
you — and nearly the entire rest of the media in every
form — continue to misstate America's present situation.
The United States is not, in fact, at "war," either offi
cially or legally, with any country on Earth. President
George W. Bush declared the"State of Emergency"
against Afghanistan "over" in 2(X)2. Congress never offi
cially declared war against Iraq; hence, the United States
committed an illegal invasion and consequential ongoing
illegal occupation, of a sovereign nation which posed no
threat to United States territory nor to that of its neigh
bors.
And, of course, the "war on terror" is, at best, a sim
plistic, point-of-focus slogan.
Hence, the United States is not in a state of war in any
sense of the word. Are we employing the tactics of war
against a native people who refuse to be ruled by Ameri
ca? Yes. Does that mean we're at war? Obviously not.
Perpetuating this falsehood ensures the American pub
lic will continue to slumber while the Bush administration
continues to abuse "war powers" it has not been granted.
