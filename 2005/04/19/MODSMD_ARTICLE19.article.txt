# Tales of a 19th-grade nothing
## The
						era of the Abercrombie man 
### 
In the wake of
prominent femi
nists speaking on
campus and Julie
Park's Op-EcJ
piece from a few
months back
about negative
media images for
women, I'm feel
ing a little left out.

You see, in modern times dominant
media images for men are also dam
aging. And as we usher in the era of
the modern, intelligent, empowered,
and equally capable "Apprentice"
female, we are also allowing to sneak
in the back door the era of the Aber
crombie Man.
Now I know that you're supposed
to be at least IX to buy the Aber
crombie catalog, so you may not
have seen it I know this because I
worked there my first summer here.
According to the manager. I had, at
28, finally achieved a "good college
look." (Great, well that's about 10
years late, but it's a paying position
so why not?)
For those of you who haven't
seen it.the catalog is the ultimate
paradox: naked models selling
clothing. Aside from the moral im
plications of marketing such a cata
log to kids, I was struck by the male
imagery presented. Every guy in
there is tall, tan, in really good
shape, with perfect teeth and com
pletely hairless from their neck
down.
Now in California, and probably
elsewhere, Abercrombie represents
what is cool for the modern high
school / college popular crowd, so it
should come as no surprise to see its
effects on the modern man (me). I'm
in the gym five days a week, mostly
for cosmetic purposes, and I've
spent more money on creatine and
protein shakes than I'd care to
admit. I've artificially tanned and
spent 30 minutes, twice a day with
Whitestrips on my teeth. But hair re
moval is where 1 (sort of) draw the
line.
Okay, so I've shaved my chest,
but I'm keeping my arm and leg hair.

Unless you need extra speed swim
ming or biking, I'm not sure there's
any good reason fora man to shave
his arms or legs. Yet all over campus
I see it.
When I've asked guys why they
do this, they say shaving your arms
and legs makes them look bigger. If
that were the main effect, why would
girls do it? Do you know any girls
who want their legs to look bigger?
Maybe if you want to look bigger, try
a little more weight and a little less
razor.
And as for being tall, well, that's
the counter for people who com
plain that media images are forcing
women into plastic surgery. You see,
all the men in media are tall (or
made to look so) and no one's ever
heard swooning over "short, dark
and handsome." And "tall" is an at
tribute just as immutable as a wom
an's chest size. At least chest size is
something you can fake; it's not as
though I can save up $5000 and go
get myself into the six-foot club.
Finally and most importantly, the
men in the Abercrombie catalog are
never doing anything very cerebral.
They're usually playing rugby or just
lying around naked. What's more,
the modern leading man is usually
much stronger than he is smart. Joey
(from "Friends") has his own show,
whose humor centers on him being
good-looking and charmingly
stupid. The Rock, Vin Diesel, and
Brad Pitt are hardly the pensive
type. And the last guy to play "the
Bachelor" — representing the most
eligible man in America — was a
professional football player. Fantas
tic.
So who is the Abercrombie man?
He's tall, he's strong, he's well
groomed and above all. he's stupid!
Got it. Now where's my supermodel
girlfriend? Oh. 1 left out one other
attribute of the Abercrombie man:
He's rich. Thanks, Donald.

Glenn I ruitt is recovering from leg
implant surgery, and it's hard for him
to talk with White-strips on his teeth. So
instead of calling, just e-mail him at
