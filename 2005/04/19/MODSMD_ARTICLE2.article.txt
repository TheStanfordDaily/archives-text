# U.S. occupation leader to speak on Iraq, terror
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Ambassador L. Paul Bremer 111. the former chief admin
istrator of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, will speak tonight
in Memorial Auditorium on the war and its broader implica
tions for global terrorism.
The event is part of what has become an annual collabo
ration between Stanford in Government, or SIG, and the
ASSU Speakers Bureau to bring a big-name political speak
er to campus in the spring. The tradition began two years ago,
when Janet Reno, the former U.S. attorney general, spoke
on campus. Last year. SIG and the Speakers Bureau enlisted
Democratic presidential candidate Carol Moseley Braun.
Bremer is a more polarizing figure than Reno or Braun.
As the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, or CPA,
which oversaw the reconstruction of Iraq's economy, infra
structure and government, he was the most visible American
administration official in Iraq.
Bremer and the provisional authority were frequently
criticized by Democratic officials for missteps in the recon
struction efforts, such as the absence of basic utility services
and the deterioration of civil order in some regions.
