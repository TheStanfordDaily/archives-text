# U.S. occupation leader to speak on Iraq, terror
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Ambassador L. Paul Bremer 111. the former chief admin
istrator of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, will speak tonight
in Memorial Auditorium on the war and its broader implica
tions for global terrorism.
The event is part of what has become an annual collabo
ration between Stanford in Government, or SIG, and the
ASSU Speakers Bureau to bring a big-name political speak
er to campus in the spring. The tradition began two years ago,
when Janet Reno, the former U.S. attorney general, spoke
on campus. Last year. SIG and the Speakers Bureau enlisted
Democratic presidential candidate Carol Moseley Braun.
Bremer is a more polarizing figure than Reno or Braun.
As the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, or CPA,
which oversaw the reconstruction of Iraq's economy, infra
structure and government, he was the most visible American
administration official in Iraq.
Bremer and the provisional authority were frequently
criticized by Democratic officials for missteps in the recon
struction efforts, such as the absence of basic utility services
and the deterioration of civil order in some regions.
"The war in Iraq, terrorism and
homeland security are all issues partic
ularly important to Stanford students,
judging by student attendance at other
events related to these topics this
year," said May Chiang, chair of SIG.
"Bremer has extensive experience in
all of these areas."
Before serving in Iraq, Bremer
spent 23 years in the State Depart
ment and served as Ambassador to
the Netherlands.
Security at the event will be tighter
than usual. Two armed Stanford
deputies, four special event patrols
and a secret service detail will secure
the area and protect Bremer, who will
arrive in a motorcade.
The largest cost associated with the
event, however, is not the security, but
the speaker himself. A marquee
speaker such as Bill Clinton or Colin
Powell can earn more than $1(R),(XX)
per speech. Contractual obligations
prevented the event's organizers from
revealing the amount Bremer re
ceived.
"It's a five-figure number,obvious
ly." said senior Chris Lin, chair of the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate, which
oversees student groups' budgets.
"It's in the tens of thousands, but
nowhere near a hundred thousand."
I le hinted that the actual figure falls
near middle of that range.
The Speakers Bureau and SKi are
splitting the cost evenly and received
additional help from other campus

groups, including the Society for In
ternational Affairs at Stanford and the
Roosevelt Institution. The Stanford
Democrats were asked to co-sponsor
the speech, but declined.
"It was too rich for our blood," said
Stanford Democrats President Marie
Jonas, a sophomore.
Bremer, who is writing a book
about his experiences in Iraq, has
asked that his comments this evening
be off-the-record. According to senior
Josh Meltzer, director of the Speakers
Bureau, the request stemmed from an
obligation to his publisher to limit his
media coverage.
The Daily will be providing full
coverage of Bremer's speech despite
his request.
"A public event like this one can
not be off-the-record, because neither
Bremer, the Speakers Bureau nor
Stanford in Government can control
whether or not audience members
write about what they hear," said
Daily Editor in Chief Cynthia Cho.
"The Daily has a responsibility to its
readers to cover the event."
Bremer took heat last September
for criticizing the administration's re
construction plans in what he assumed
were off-the-record speeches at De-
Pauw University in Indiana and at an
insurance conference in West Vir
ginia. Bremer's assertion that "we
never had enough troops on the
ground" became campaign fodder
when his remarks went public.
Tickets to Bremer's speech are free
for members of the Stanford commu
nity and will be available today in
White Plaza and at the Graduate
Community Center from noon to 1
p.m. and at the door this evening.
