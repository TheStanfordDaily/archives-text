## Stanford should greet Bremer with skepticism 
### RACHELLE MARSHALL 
"Bremer's history with Coalition
Provisional Authority question
able"
One of the benefits of a Stanford
education is that it prepares students
to play a constructive role in nation
al and world affairs. That is the only
justifiable reason for inviting L. Paul
Bremer to speak here 011 April IM.
Bremer's actions as head of the
Coalition Provisional Authority in
Iraq until last June provide lessons
in how not to rebuild a war-torn
country.
Until he took up his post in May
2003, Bremer's career included
stints as President Ronald Reagan's
ambassador-at-large 011 terrorism
and as managing director of Henry
Kissinger's global consulting firm.
As chairman of the National Comis
sion on Terrorism in 20(H) Bremer
drew protests from human rights
groups by advocating that restric
tions be dropped on hiring sources
with records of human rights abuses.
He had no experience in major re
construction efforts before he went
to Iraq.
Experts in the State Department
warned that chaos and factional
strife were almost certain to follow
the overthrow of Saddam Hussein,
but there was no evidence that Bre
mer was clued in 011 these reports.
According to New York Times
columnist Paul krugman, when Bre
mer took up his post as head of the
occupation authority lie seemed
"oddly disengaged from the prob
lems of postwar anarchy."
He focused entirely instead on
the need to privatize Iraq's state
owned industries, an approach that
resulted in squandering the initial
goodwill of the Iraqi people and that
delayed the reconstruction of their
country.

Iraq's infrastructure had been al
most completely destroyed by
American bombing in 1991. Be
tween mid-March and mid-April
2003, U.S. planes dropped another
30,000 bombs on Iraq, destroying
transmission lines, communication
networks, power plants and other fa
cilities, and causing thousands of
civilian casualties.
Instead of taking immediate ac
tion to restore vital services and pro
vide Iraqis with security and a
means of earning a living, Bremer
disbanded the army, fired 500,000
Iraqis from their jobs, and hired tens
of thousands of foreign contract
workers to do the work of recon
struction, so that Iraq's unemploy
ment rate jumped to 67 percent. In
September 2003 Bremer decreed
that Iraqi state companies would be
privatized and that foreign firms
could own Iraqi banks, factories and
mines, and take KM) percent of the
profits out of Iraq.
Bremer also parcelled out securi
ty functions to foreign firms.
Interrogators hired by private
companies have been accused of
masterminding the torture of prison
ers at Abu Ghraib, but they cannot
be charged because Bremer decreed
that all foreign contract workers
were immune from Iraqi law and
U.S. military justice. At least one se
curity firm. Cluster Battles, is sus
pected of perpetrating a multimil
lion dollar fraud scheme in Iraq, but
they are also untouchable because
Bremer granted broad immunity
from local prosecution to companies
paid out of Iraqi oil funds.
Cluster Battles was not the only
organization suspected of defraud
ing the Iraqis. The Coalition Au
thority under Bremer issued some
$20 billion worth of contracts fi
nanced by Iraqi oil revenues, most of
them to American companies on a

no-bid, cost-plus basis. A U.N.-
sponsored audit and the CPA's own
inspector general documented ex
tensive corruption and waste in the
handling of the oil money, and found
that $8.8 billion couldn't be account
ed for at all.
Meanwhile, by late June 2004 the
authority had spent only $366 mil
lion of the $18 billion approved by
Congress for reconstruction in Iraq.
According to the Office of Man
agement and Budget, not a cent of
the U.S. aid money had been spent
on health care, sanitation or water
projects.
Today hospitals still lack antibi
otics, pain medication, and even
clean water. Dahr Jamail, a journal
ist who has just returned from Iraq,
spoke at Cubberley Auditorium on
March 8 and showed slide after slide
of buildings bombed into rubble,
streets littered with bodies, and hos
pital beds filled with grievously hurt
children â€” scenes we don't see on
American television.
Since the U.S. invasion, more
than 1,540 Americans and tens of
thousands of Iraqis have died. Iraq is
now a place of lawlessness and mis
ery, where women are afraid to go
out alone. Acute malnutrition
among children has doubled since
2003.
Yet in July 2003 Bremer said,
"Never before in warfare have so
many people been freed with so few
casualties in such a short time, with
so little damage done to the country
and its people." The former head of
the Coalition Provisional Authority
deserves a polite hearing when he
appears at Stanford, but a skeptical
one as well.
