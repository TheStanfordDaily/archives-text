### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Paul Berg, emeritus professor
of cancer research, will receive the
seventh annual Biotechnology
Heritage Award from the Chemi
cal Heritage Foundation, or CHF,
in conjunction with the Biotech
nology Industry Organization this
June. The honor will be presented
at the 810 Annual International
Convention 2005 in Philadelphia.
The award is granted to indi
viduals who have contributed to
the field of biotechnology and
have also worked to promote pub
lic understanding of scientific dis
covery. According to the CHF
Web site, recipients must also be
involved in philanthropy or entre
preneurship in biotechnology.
Berg said that he considers the
award a great distinction.
"My career at Stanford has
been very rewarding because of
the amazing colleagues and stu
dents I've been associated with,"
he added.
Philip Pizzo, dean of the Med
ical School, called Berg one of the
most remarkable scientists work
ing today.
"Dr. Berg's fundamental dis
coveries have transformed the
biosciences and led to the revolu
tion in genetic engineering with
the consequent explosion in
biotechnology and the develop
ment of a large number of life-sav
ing drugs and pharmaceuticals,"
Pizzo said in an email. "Equally
important, he has been a wonder
ful spokesperson for science, med
icine and humanity. I lis contribu

tions will have an impact for
decades to come."
Berg, along with colleagues
Walter Gilbert and Frederick
Sanger, received the Nobel Prize
in Chemistry in IMKO for research
developing techniques to map the
structure and function of DN A.
Berg has also received the Cal
ifornia Scientist of the Year
Award, the New York Academy
of Sciences Award and the Na
tional Medal of Science, among
many other honors.
Additionally, Berg's pioneer
ing work with gene splicing has
earned him great respect within
the scientific community, several
of his colleagues agreed.
"Paul Berg's scientific creativi
ty underlies our knowledge of the
genetics of all living things, and
our ability to understand the func
tioning of cells from any species,"
said Arnold Thackray, president
of CHF, in the foundation's April
13 press release.
Although Berg hasn't taught
since 2(MH) and no longer actively
conducts laboratory research, he
has since written various scientific
articles and a biography on
George Beadle, a geneticist and
winner of the Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine. Addi
tionally, Berg is still involved in
public policy activism regarding
biomedical issues.
In the fall of each year, the for
mer winners of the Heritage
Award and members of the nomi
nating committee submit names
of worthy candidates. The nomi
nating committee selected the
winninu candidate in October.
