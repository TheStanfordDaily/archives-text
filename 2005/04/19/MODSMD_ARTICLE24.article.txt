I was channel-surfing this afternoon when I
came across curling on ESPN2. This
wasn't your run-of-the-mill Canadian
competition featuring the Newfoundland
Seal Clubbers versus the Alberta Guys-Who-
Weren't-Good-Enough-to-Play-on-t he-
Local-Bant am-Hockey-Team-as-Kids. I
could watch that. In fact, 1 could spend an en
tire afternoon glued to the screen if the plot
line were compelling enough.
This wasn't official curling. This was the
World Skills Competition (I'm pretty sure it
was "skills" and not "skill/."), or the equiva
lent of the World Curling Federation All-Star
game. The North American team was led by
Jason Larway from Seattle, a Casey Jacobsen
look-alike with bleached surfer spikes. His
primary opponent, the skip for the European

team, was Peter Narup, a
thick Swede with a shaggy
black goatee who looked
like he was fresh off the boat
— the Viking boat — ready
to pillage and plunder.
After an hour of watch
ing the two skips throwing
stones toward the bulls-eye
and screaming at their team
mates to sweep the ice faster

to slow the deceleration rate of the stone, I re
alized (a) I should be working on a problem
set now, and (b) I would be a dominant curler
because I'm an expert at random games that
require no true athletic ability.
Case in point: I played my second game of
Wiffle ball in the claw and won one of two.
Last night 1 was the last one standing in the
heated game of hallway knockout basketball
on the Nerf hoop over my door. I am warming
up my Cherry Bomb for the upcoming four
square competition for which I have already
bought a vintage, original recess quality red
rubber kickball.
The most noteworthy accessories to my ca
sual sporting life are the little red inflatable
balls that athletes and Yell Leaders launched
into the crowd after sporting events all fall
and winter. There's the mini soccer ball spon
sored by McKenna Family Dentistry, two Fi
delity Investments basketballs and one
Buck/Cardinal basketball that I collected
over a range of soccer and hoops games this
year.
These balls are essential to dorm golf, the
newest game that I've picked up. Dorm golf
involves kicking the balls through the halls of
FroSoCo, across the bridges to other Sterling
Quad dorms, up stairs, through ladders and
around bicycle obstacles to the hole. The
game is taken seriously by its participants
(read: me), and rules are strictly enforced. To
add a measure of legitimacy to the game, the
winner of each hole gets to wear the ceremo
nial pUstic gladiator breastplate.
We continually add legendary shots to the
game's lore. Mike Albanese, in his first-ever
round, revolutionized the game with a flick
from 10 feet that made it through a doorway
and up a flight of stairs. Mike Krieger, the
Brazilian Wiffle ball phenom, once sank a 65-
foot putt around a corner to win a hole, 23-24.
Maybe it's because I'm not on the dorm
golf Instant Classic highlight reel, but I don't
