# Bickerstaff places second at Nationals
## Women earn ninth-place finish 
### SCOTT ALIEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Co-term student Ryan Bickerstaff
was one of more than S(K) athletes to
swim under the original London
Bridge Saturday. He also biked and
ran over the 140-year old structure
that once spanned the River Thames
en route to a second-place finish at the
Collegiate National Championships
Triathlon in Lake Havasu City, Ariz.
More than S(K) triathletes, includ
ing 25 members of the Stanford
triathlon team, competed in the event,
which kicked off at 6:45 a.m. Saturday
and consisted of a 1,500-meter swim, a
40-kilometer bike ride and a 10-kilo
meter run.
Stanford finished sixth in the team
competition with a score of 817. the
sum of the place-finishes of the team's
top three male and top three female
finishers. Colorado took first-place
honors with a score of 486. including
three top-30 finishes.
Bickerstaff headlined Stanford's
performance, finishing in 1:58:18. Indi
vidual champion Brendan O'Brien of
UC-San Diego crossed the finish line
39 seconds earlier.
"I felt I was fully capable of win
ning the race as long as I finished the
bike at or near the lead, because run
ning is my strongest event." said Bick
erstaff, who was competing in his first
Olympic-distance race since the Ju
nior World Championships in 2001.
After spending time on both the
cross-country and track teams. Bicker
staff resumed consistent swim and
bike training in January and was

poised to win the individual title run
ning away after he built a one minute
and 15 second lead during the bike
portion of the race.
"Under normal circumstances that
type of lead would have assured me of
a win. but toward the end of the bike,
my hamstrings started to cramp up."
said Bickerstaff. who used a computer
program that created a three-dimen
sional version of the Lake Havasu
course to virtua-train leading up to
Saturday. "I knew I was in trouble at
the beginning of the run and almost
thought I was going to have to drop
out because my hamstrings started to
cramp up really bad.''
Bickerstaff said he slowed his pace,
hoping he would be able to work out
the cramp, but his lower back started
cramping as well. While O'Brien
passed him and his run split was about
three minutes slower than usual, his
overall time was still a personal best
for the draft-illegal racing format,
which prohibits biking in groups.
"Without the cramping problem, I
would have won by a substantial mar
gin, so I am really excited with where
my fitness is right now." he said.
Bickerstaff said the second-place
finish compared favorably to his
money-making appearance on
"Wheel of Fortune" last April.
"It is definitely nice to win $ 12.<MK)
for 30 minutes of 'work' calling out let
ters, but competing in sports after
countless hours of preparation and
training is a much more rewarding ex
perience." he said.
