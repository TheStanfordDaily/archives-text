# Bickerstaff places second at Nationals
## Women earn ninth-place finish 
### SCOTT ALIEN MANAGING EDITOR 
Co-term student Ryan Bickerstaff
was one of more than S(K) athletes to
swim under the original London
Bridge Saturday. He also biked and
ran over the 140-year old structure
that once spanned the River Thames
en route to a second-place finish at the
Collegiate National Championships
Triathlon in Lake Havasu City, Ariz.
More than S(K) triathletes, includ
ing 25 members of the Stanford
triathlon team, competed in the event,
which kicked off at 6:45 a.m. Saturday
and consisted of a 1,500-meter swim, a
40-kilometer bike ride and a 10-kilo
meter run.
Stanford finished sixth in the team
competition with a score of 817. the
sum of the place-finishes of the team's
top three male and top three female
finishers. Colorado took first-place
honors with a score of 486. including
three top-30 finishes.
Bickerstaff headlined Stanford's
performance, finishing in 1:58:18. Indi
vidual champion Brendan O'Brien of
UC-San Diego crossed the finish line
39 seconds earlier.
"I felt I was fully capable of win
ning the race as long as I finished the
bike at or near the lead, because run
ning is my strongest event." said Bick
erstaff, who was competing in his first
Olympic-distance race since the Ju
nior World Championships in 2001.
After spending time on both the
cross-country and track teams. Bicker
staff resumed consistent swim and
bike training in January and was

poised to win the individual title run
ning away after he built a one minute
and 15 second lead during the bike
portion of the race.
"Under normal circumstances that
type of lead would have assured me of
a win. but toward the end of the bike,
my hamstrings started to cramp up."
said Bickerstaff. who used a computer
program that created a three-dimen
sional version of the Lake Havasu
course to virtua-train leading up to
Saturday. "I knew I was in trouble at
the beginning of the run and almost
thought I was going to have to drop
out because my hamstrings started to
cramp up really bad.''
Bickerstaff said he slowed his pace,
hoping he would be able to work out
the cramp, but his lower back started
cramping as well. While O'Brien
passed him and his run split was about
three minutes slower than usual, his
overall time was still a personal best
for the draft-illegal racing format,
which prohibits biking in groups.
"Without the cramping problem, I
would have won by a substantial mar
gin, so I am really excited with where
my fitness is right now." he said.
Bickerstaff said the second-place
finish compared favorably to his
money-making appearance on
"Wheel of Fortune" last April.
"It is definitely nice to win $ 12.<MK)
for 30 minutes of 'work' calling out let
ters, but competing in sports after
countless hours of preparation and
training is a much more rewarding ex
perience." he said.
Junior John Duchi finished 22nd
in 2:05:26 and Nate Matter, who
rowed as an undergraduate, finished
47th in a personal-best time of 2:09:40
to round out Stanford's top three.
The triti finished sixth among men's
teams with a score of 74, only 13 be
hind men's team champion UC-San
Diego.
Head coach Eric Bean said he was
particularly impressed with Matter's
race.
"He just had a career outing,"
Bean said. "He dropped about four
minutes on the swim, which is nor
mally his weak point. It was by far his
best performance, and he improved
the most out of anybody. He was so
fast in the swim that I missed him
coming out of the water."
The Stanford women placed
ninth out of 29 teams with a score of
103. Senior Kristen Bell finished 23rd
in 2:28:10, graduate student Angela
Strange finished 28th in 2:29:27 and
senior Tenley Bick placed 52nd in
2:36:18.

Junior Bristin Jones, who trained
with a triathlon team in Florence
where she was abroad last quarter
after e-mailing the coach on a whim,
had modest hopes heading into Sat
urday.
"When asked what my goal time
was. I said. I don't know if I'm in
good enough shape to beat my time
from last year,'" Jones said. "But 1
did by 12 minutes. I don't know how
I did it."
Jones finished 86th in a time of
2:42:56. She said the entire weekend,
from the bus ride down on Thursday
to the post-race banquet and dinner
fostered inter- and intra-team bond
ing.
"The team as a whole did ex
tremely well." Bickerstaff said. "Ev
eryone was really supportive of ev
eryone else in the pursuit of their
goals, whether it was winning, finish
ing. or improving upon a past perfor
mance."
Stanford's best finish at Nationals
came in 2(X)3. when it finished third

overall. The team fell to ninth the fol
ic >wing year and placed sixth last year,
the first year that place-finishes
rather than times were used to com
pute team scores.
The team will take a one-week
break before returning to its daily
training routine. Bean said it's up to
the individual athlete how hard he
wants to work for the remainder of
the spring.
"From the beginning of the sea
son up until Nationals, we're here to
make and reach team goals," Bean
said. "1 was very pleased with this
weekend. But after that race it's all
about individual goals. Whatever
goal someone has, we help them with
that."
Bickerstaff has his sights set on
Beijing.
"1 haven't finalized my plans for
the summer yet. but 1 plan on turning
professional at some point so that 1
can compete in some higher-profile
races."he said. "My longer-term goal
is to make the 2(X)8 Olympic Team."

Bean, who hasn't competed in
several years, said he is entertaining
thoughts of getting back into the
sport after Saturday's race.
"Nationals got the competitive
juices going again," he said. "You
miss the adrenaline rush and I got a
little taste of it this weekend. I might
want to jump back into it. but I figure
I will ease back into it slowly. It's not
something I can do half-ass."
Senior Charlie Anderson, co
president of the Stanford triathlon
club and a third-year graduate stu
dent in biology, said he will begin
training fora better performance
next year after placing 104 th in
2:16:18. He also expressed hope that
the club would continue to grow.
"We have an interesting mix of
people who are interested in
triathlon for the fun and some who
are really serious about it," Ander
son said. "There are a good amount
of people who are competitive, and
next year we might have a chance to
enlarge that group even more."
