# Women's lacrosse picks up two wins
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Spectacular individual performances
propelled the women's lacrosse squad to
two hard-fought victories in its last two
home contests of the season. On Friday, a
last-minute game-winning goal from junior
attacker Sarah Bach allowed the Cardinal
to squeak by Yale, 9-8. Against Denver on
Sunday, sophomore attacker Michelle
DeChant tallied five goals. Bach and junior
attacker Megan Burker contributed a hat
trick apiece and Stanford rode its high
powered offense to a 17-14 victory.
Stanford (9-5, 5-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) started with an offen
sive explosion against Yale (6-6), which
came into the contest ranked No. 19 in the
nation. Quick scores from sophomore mid
fielder Liz Piselli and senior midfielder
Kelsey Twist gave the Cardinal a 2-0 lead
just seven minutes into the game. After a
lone Yale goal, tallies from senior midfield
er Nina Pantano, Bach and freshman mid
fielder Ariana Parasco gave the Cardinal a
5-1 lead in the waning minutes of the first
half.
"We started with a huge team effort,"
Burker said. "Our offense stepped up with
everyone contributing a lot more than in
other games. We had depth to fall back on,
and our defense stepped up too. We were
stronger all over the field."
However, Yale responded to Stanford's
initial run with an even larger streak of its
own. The Bulldogs scored two goals in the
last two minutes of the first half and anoth
er two goals in the first seven minutes of the
second half to tie the game at 5-5.
Twist's second goal, with 21:50 remain
ing, briefly stemmed the Bulldogs' momen
tum, placing the Cardinal in front 6-5. How
ever, over the next seven minutes, Yale ex
ploded for another three goals, capping a 7-
1 run for the Bulldogs and giving Yale its
largest lead of the game, 8-6, with 15:14 re
maining.
"At times it was a little frantic to try to
figure out what can get us back on track and
get the momentum to shift," Burker said.
"Finally, we realized that what we needed
to do we already knew how to do. We came
up with big defensive stops and caught up
with Yale. We knew we could compete with
them."
The Cardinal defense held Yale score
less in the last 15 minutes, and a pair of
scores from freshman attacker Daphne

Patterson tied the game at 8-8 with 4:22 re
maining, setting the stage fora fantastic fin
ish. After both teams stalled on offensive
possessions. Bach netted the game-winner
on an unassisted breakaway with 55 sec
onds left and controlled the ensuing draw,
allowing the Cardinal to run out the clock
on the dramatic victory.
Bach's game-winner, which left nearly a
minute on the clock, ran counter to the Car
dinal's initial plans.
"We had planned to get the last shot,"
Burker said. "We were looking around,
looking to run a set, but Sarah made a real
ly great hard drive and did just what we
needed."
After Friday's thriller, Sunday's game
against Denver (4-11,2-2 MPSF) provided
the Cardinal with more breathing room
than the 17-14 final score might indicate.
Denver's Kate Broderick netted the first
score two minutes into the contest, but the
1-0 lead would be the Pioneers' last, as the
Cardinal exploded for five goals in less than
nine minutes. Led by DeChant's four first
half tallies, Stanford continued its offensive
dominance in the latter portions of the first
half, building a 10-6 halftime lead.
"Our offense worked hard this past
weekend to help out the defense," Burker
said. "The offense had a good game last
week against Notre Dame, but we felt like
we'd still been putting pressure on the de
fense, instead of stepping up and saying we
can outscore the other team. We have a
huge amount of scoring depth and we can
outscore the other team. We just kept
putting it in against Denver."
The two MPSF foes traded three goals
apiece to start the second stanza, increasing
the score to 13-9. The contest had been
competitive up to that point, but a timely
Stanford scoring spurt iced the game and
ensured the Cardinal a fifth consecutive un
defeated regular season in conference play.
In a flurry lasting fewer than four minutes,
Burker's third goal, DeChant's fifth, Bach's
third and Pantano's second put the Cardi
nal up 17-9 with 12:32 to play. Denver's
three scores in the final 10 minutes only
made the final margin appear respectable.
"It's definitely a big win for us," Burker
added. "It meant a lot for us to finish the
season strong on our home field and give
that to Nina and Kelsey. Let them end with
a win. Winning the MPSF also means a lot
to our team. We want to prove we can dom
inate in the West and are ready for any East
Coast competition."
