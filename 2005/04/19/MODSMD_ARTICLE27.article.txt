# Golfers finish fifth at U.S. Intercollegiate
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Playing in their final regular-season
tournament and competing on their
home course for the only time this spring,
the Stanford men's golf team needed a
solid showing at last weekend's U.S. In
tercollegiate to build some momentum
for the upcoming postseason. Did the
Cardinal get the job done?
Oh. definitely sorta maybe.

After a disappointing first two rounds
on Saturday that dropped Stanford back
to a tie for seventh place, the Cardinal
charged back with the best round of the
day on Sunday and scaled the leader
board to post a fifth-place finish. Fresh
man Rob Grube led the team and added
to an impressive rookie resume with a
runner-up finish individually, one shot
behind Arizona State's Pat Moore's two
under-par total of 208. USC won the
tournament with a six-over-par 846.

Although fifth place was less than
Stanford expected heading into the
weekend, it was more than the Cardinal
could have hoped for after an opening
round 294 (14 over par) filled with loose
iron shots and repeated failure to convert
opportunities on the greens.
"In the morning, 1 putted well, but the
driver was off-line," sophomore Matt
Shin said of his play on Saturday. "I had
a hard time putting myself in good posi
tion to make birdies. In the afternoon, 1

hit the driver well, but putted poorly."
That was the Cardinal's first day of
competition in a nutshell.
Inconsistency hounded every member
of the team on Saturday and touched
every facet of the game.
Grube put on a clinic from tee to
green, but he watched the hole shrink to
thimble-like proportions when he took
his putter out of the bag. His teammate,
senior Kevin Blue, seemed to
make every putt he looked at on
Saturday. His ballstriking, how
ever, which explored all parts of
the clubface, meant that his
snaking 20-foot putts rolled in
for frantic par saves, rather than
birdie bids.
Grube paced the team on the
first day, shooting rounds of 71
and 70. His one-over-par total
of 141 was good fora seventh
place tie Saturday evening.
Blue rebounded from a first
round 74 with a 71 on Saturday
afternoon and stood in a tie for
23rd place after 36 holes.
Sophomore Zack Miller shot 73
in his opening round and stum
bled in his second 18 holes,
shooting 77. He was tied for
52nd.
One shot behind Miller was
junior Scott Mac Donald. who
carded rounds of 77 and 74,
while Shin shot a pair of 76's
and dropped back to a tie for
63rd place.
Despite the ragged start, this
Cardinal team was determined
not to repeat the sins of last
year, when they limped to the
finish line in April and May.
On Sunday. Stanford provid
ed fans with a tantalizing vision
of what could be for this team at
the upcoming Pacific-10 Con
ference Championship.
Grube marched to a two
under-par 68 on a day when low
scores were a rarity, despite a
continuing feud between he and
his putter. Knocking down flag
sticks all morning, Grube could
easily have gone as low as 65
with merely average putting
(for him) as he missed no fewer
than four birdie putts inside 10
feet.
Nonetheless, the second
place finish was the best of his
young career.
"It is frustrating (to not win),
but I try to look at it positively."
Cirube said. "I am going to see
my coach in Palm Springs this
week to work on my short game
and putting. After this week's
session. I'm hoping to improve

the weak parts of my game in
order to make a push for the
postseason."
Miller was even hotter than
Grube on Sunday and was four
strokes under par with only one
hole remaining. A triple-bogey
on that final hole derailed what
would have been the lowest
round of the tournament, but
his 69 nonetheless propelled
him to a 25th-place finish.
A final-round 73 tied Blue
for 23rd place, while Mac Do
nald shot 74 to tie for 54th. Shin
finished with a 77 on Sunday,
tying for 77th place overall.
A number of Stanford play
ers also competed in their home
event as individuals, not con
tributing to the team's score.
Senior Pat Phillips (72-69-
74) wrapped up his regular-sea
son college career with his best
performance of the year, a
ninth-place finish.
Sophomore Matt Savage (76-
71-78) tied for 54th place, while
junior Kyle Gentry shot 78-75-
75 to tie for 72nd. Freshman
Teddy Collins rounded out the
individuals by carding rounds of
76, 76 and 81 to claim 86th
place.
In Pleasanton, Calif., the
Cardinal women began first
round action at the Pac-1()
Championship on Monday. On
the first day of the three-day 54-
hole event at Ruby Hill Country
Club, Stanford shot a 16-over
par 304 to sit in seventh place
overall.
Junior Kelly Husted and se
nior Wendra Liang each shot
three-over-par 755, while
sophomore Jenni Tangtiphai
boontana carded a 77.
Fellow sophomore Lauren
Todd, who received two bags of
intravenous fluids fora stomach
virus Sunday evening, battled
gamely through Monday's 18
holes, shooting 77.
Junior Stephanie Lue strug
gled, shooting 87.
"The greens were a littler
firmer and faster today [than in
Sunday's practice round],"
coach Caroline O'Connor said.
"We just didn't make the ad
justments early."

runner-up finish individually, one shot
behind Arizona State's Pat Moore's two
under-par total of 208. USC won the
tournament with a six-over-par 846.

Although fifth place was less than
Stanford expected heading into the
weekend, it was more than the Cardinal
could have hoped for after an opening
round 294 (14 over par) filled with loose
iron shots and repeated failure to convert
opportunities on the greens.
"In the morning, 1 putted well, but the
driver was off-line," sophomore Matt
Shin said of his play on Saturday. "I had
a hard time putting myself in good posi
tion to make birdies. In the afternoon, 1

hit the driver well, but putted poorly."
That was the Cardinal's first day of
competition in a nutshell.
Inconsistency hounded every member
of the team on Saturday and touched
every facet of the game.
Grube put on a clinic from tee to
green, but he watched the hole shrink to
thimble-like proportions when he took
his putter out of the bag. His teammate,
senior Kevin Blue, seemed to
make every putt he looked at on
Saturday. His ballstriking, how
ever, which explored all parts of
the clubface, meant that his
snaking 20-foot putts rolled in
for frantic par saves, rather than
birdie bids.
Grube paced the team on the
first day, shooting rounds of 71
and 70. His one-over-par total
of 141 was good fora seventh
place tie Saturday evening.
Blue rebounded from a first
round 74 with a 71 on Saturday
afternoon and stood in a tie for
23rd place after 36 holes.
Sophomore Zack Miller shot 73
in his opening round and stum
bled in his second 18 holes,
shooting 77. He was tied for
52nd.
One shot behind Miller was
junior Scott Mac Donald. who
carded rounds of 77 and 74,
while Shin shot a pair of 76's
and dropped back to a tie for
63rd place.
Despite the ragged start, this
Cardinal team was determined
not to repeat the sins of last
year, when they limped to the
finish line in April and May.
On Sunday. Stanford provid
ed fans with a tantalizing vision
of what could be for this team at
the upcoming Pacific-10 Con
ference Championship.
Grube marched to a two
under-par 68 on a day when low
scores were a rarity, despite a
continuing feud between he and
his putter. Knocking down flag
sticks all morning, Grube could
easily have gone as low as 65
with merely average putting
(for him) as he missed no fewer
than four birdie putts inside 10
feet.
Nonetheless, the second
place finish was the best of his
young career.
"It is frustrating (to not win),
but I try to look at it positively."
Cirube said. "I am going to see
my coach in Palm Springs this
week to work on my short game
and putting. After this week's
session. I'm hoping to improve

the weak parts of my game in
order to make a push for the
postseason."
Miller was even hotter than
Grube on Sunday and was four
strokes under par with only one
hole remaining. A triple-bogey
on that final hole derailed what
would have been the lowest
round of the tournament, but
his 69 nonetheless propelled
him to a 25th-place finish.
A final-round 73 tied Blue
for 23rd place, while Mac Do
nald shot 74 to tie for 54th. Shin
finished with a 77 on Sunday,
tying for 77th place overall.
A number of Stanford play
ers also competed in their home
event as individuals, not con
tributing to the team's score.
Senior Pat Phillips (72-69-
74) wrapped up his regular-sea
son college career with his best
performance of the year, a
ninth-place finish.
Sophomore Matt Savage (76-
71-78) tied for 54th place, while
junior Kyle Gentry shot 78-75-
75 to tie for 72nd. Freshman
Teddy Collins rounded out the
individuals by carding rounds of
76, 76 and 81 to claim 86th
place.
In Pleasanton, Calif., the
Cardinal women began first
round action at the Pac-1()
Championship on Monday. On
the first day of the three-day 54-
hole event at Ruby Hill Country
Club, Stanford shot a 16-over
par 304 to sit in seventh place
overall.
Junior Kelly Husted and se
nior Wendra Liang each shot
three-over-par 755, while
sophomore Jenni Tangtiphai
boontana carded a 77.
Fellow sophomore Lauren
Todd, who received two bags of
intravenous fluids fora stomach
virus Sunday evening, battled
gamely through Monday's 18
holes, shooting 77.
Junior Stephanie Lue strug
gled, shooting 87.
"The greens were a littler
firmer and faster today [than in
Sunday's practice round],"
coach Caroline O'Connor said.
"We just didn't make the ad
justments early."
Play will continue today and
tomorrow, with groups begin
ning from split tees at 8 a.m.
Playing in their final regular-season
tournament and competing on their
home course for the only time this spring,
the Stanford men's golf team needed a
solid showing at last weekend's U.S. In
tercollegiate to build some momentum
for the upcoming postseason. Did the
Cardinal get the job done?
Oh. definitely sorta maybe.

After a disappointing first two rounds
on Saturday that dropped Stanford back
to a tie for seventh place, the Cardinal
charged back with the best round of the
day on Sunday and scaled the leader
board to post a fifth-place finish. Fresh
man Rob Grube led the team and added
to an impressive rookie resume with a
runner-up finish individually, one shot
behind Arizona State's Pat Moore's two
under-par total of 208. USC won the
tournament with a six-over-par 846.
