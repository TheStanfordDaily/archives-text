Last Saturday, the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team
(21-0, 12-0 Pacific-10 Conference) secured a convincing, 6-1
win over No. 21 California (12-8,4-8 Pac-10) to close out an
other perfect season in the Pac-10.
While the Cardinal basked in the glory of being league
champion for the 18th year in a row, there was little cause for
celebration for Cal, which finished third-to-last in the con
ference.
Golden Bears head coach Jan Brogan will have to wait
until next season to reach a milestone of her own — her
500 th win.
The Cardinal got off to a solid start, securing the doubles
point with wins at Nos. 2 and 3 doubles, after Cal's top tan
dem of Suzi Babos and Stephanie Kusano pulled the rug out
from No. 29 Amber Liu and Anne Yelsey.
With a 9-8 (7) tiebreak victory, the No. 49 Golden Bears
team saved three match points to snap No. 29 Liu and
Yelsey's 10-match winning streak. But rather than letting
their two-point loss dampen their spirits, Liu and Yelsey (15-
3, 10-2) proceeded to put on a display of singles brilliance.
"To be honest, losing that match didn't hurt our confi
dence at all," Liu said. "If anything, it fired us up more. We
hadn't been playing in the top doubles position until last
week down in L.A., where we came off a big win against
UCLA. We've been playing [at) a new level, and once you're
at that level it's only a matter of executing just a little bit
more [each time]."
Liu, a junior and two-time defending NCAA Singles
Champion, jumped out to a commanding lead in the top sin
gles position to take the first set from Babos, 6-2. While the
two waged a closer battle in the second, Liu served out a tight
7-6 (7) decision.
Ranked fourth in the nation, Babos (30-7) is the second
best freshman in the country, behind only Northwestern's


MATT COIEMAN/The Stanford Daily
Junior Alice Barnes has been unstoppable of late, having lost only one singles match since
January.
No. 3 Audra Cohen. Bahos faced
Cohen on the Wildcats' turf in
March, handing her a hard-fought
4-6,6-2,6-4 defeat.
No. 9 Liu rises to 14-3 after dis
patching one of her toughest oppo
nents all season.
"1 came out a lot stronger in the
first set than the last time 1 played
her," Liu said. "For that I can
thank all the extra practice I've
been putting in."
Liu admits that her serve, usual
ly the perfect complement to her
flawless groundstrokes, didn't help
her as much as she'd hoped.
"My serve wasn't that great until
the very end. where it was crucial in
the tiebreak," Liu said. "I'm glad
that 1 stuck it out and didn't give up.
because Babos was playing just as
well as she did (in March]."
Babos dropped Liu. 7-5, 6-0, at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium last
month.
At No. 2 singles, junior Alice
Barnes made quick work of Ku
sano, notching a 6-2, 6-2 straight
set win.

Improving to 21-6, No. 29
Barnes has lost just one match
since January and is matching her
singles success with her newfound
partner at No. 2 doubles, sopho
more Theresa Logar.
In just her 10th doubles match
of the season, Logar helped
Barnes inflict a punishing, 8-0
shutout on Tiffany Lee and Jessica
Shu (5-IS).
At No. 3 singles, Logar (23-3)
pulled out a straight-set victory of
her own, breezing past Monica
Weisener (13-16), 6-4,6-0.
Sophomore Anne Yelsey
rounded out Stanford's host of
straight-set wins, defeating Shu. 6-
3,6-4.
While some members of the
Stanford squad will head to the
Pac-10 Individual tournament this
Thursday in Ojai, Liu will remain
behind to rest up for NCAAs.
With a month remaining until
the national contest, Liu reflects
the team's enthusiasm and relief in
finishing a stellar regular season.
"We didn't want any doubts
about having to share the Pac-10
title, and we all went into Saturday's
match really pumped up." Liu said.
"The weather was also great, so it
seemed like everything went in our
favor."
