Last Saturday, the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team
(21-0, 12-0 Pacific-10 Conference) secured a convincing, 6-1
win over No. 21 California (12-8,4-8 Pac-10) to close out an
other perfect season in the Pac-10.
While the Cardinal basked in the glory of being league
champion for the 18th year in a row, there was little cause for
celebration for Cal, which finished third-to-last in the con
ference.
Golden Bears head coach Jan Brogan will have to wait
until next season to reach a milestone of her own â€” her
500 th win.
The Cardinal got off to a solid start, securing the doubles
point with wins at Nos. 2 and 3 doubles, after Cal's top tan
dem of Suzi Babos and Stephanie Kusano pulled the rug out
from No. 29 Amber Liu and Anne Yelsey.
With a 9-8 (7) tiebreak victory, the No. 49 Golden Bears
team saved three match points to snap No. 29 Liu and
Yelsey's 10-match winning streak. But rather than letting
their two-point loss dampen their spirits, Liu and Yelsey (15-
3, 10-2) proceeded to put on a display of singles brilliance.
"To be honest, losing that match didn't hurt our confi
dence at all," Liu said. "If anything, it fired us up more. We
hadn't been playing in the top doubles position until last
week down in L.A., where we came off a big win against
UCLA. We've been playing [at) a new level, and once you're
at that level it's only a matter of executing just a little bit
more [each time]."
Liu, a junior and two-time defending NCAA Singles
Champion, jumped out to a commanding lead in the top sin
gles position to take the first set from Babos, 6-2. While the
two waged a closer battle in the second, Liu served out a tight
7-6 (7) decision.
Ranked fourth in the nation, Babos (30-7) is the second
best freshman in the country, behind only Northwestern's

Junior Alice Barnes has been unstoppable of late, having lost only one singles match since
January.
