# Yim to represent Stanford gymnastics at Nationals
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Coachcs are often proud of their teams. But it's not as
common to hear them say that an individual has the po
tential to he among the best athletes ever to graduate
from a school that boasts 10 Directors' Cups, over 376 in
dividual NCAA titles, and 199 Olympic medals.
That is exactly what the head coach of the women's
gymnastics team said about freshman Tabitha Vim at the
beginning of the season.
"As long as she can stay healthy, she can be one of the
best athletes Stanford has ever seen," said Kristen Smyth
this past January.
Yim's potential will be put to the test this Thursday as
she vies for an All-Around or individual event title at
NCAA Nationals in Auburn. Alabama. Thanks to her
score 0f39.25 at Regionals two weeks ago, Yim is the top
at-large qualifier in the All-Around competition. She
will compete against 11 other at-large All-Around qual
ifiers and against all of the gymnasts from the 12 teams
that qualified for Nationals.
Of those 12, Utah and UCLA will likely be vying for
the top place on the podium. For the first time in live
years, however. Stanford will not be among the mix. In
juries kept the Cardinal from finishing among the top
two qualifying spots at Regionals.
"It is a bummer that no one else on my team can go,"
said Yim. "But even though none of the other girls will
be there, 1 will still be competing for them."
Yim's toughest competition in the All-Around will
likely come from UCLA Olympians Kristen Maloney

and Tasha Schwikert, who posted respective average
All-Around scores of 39.6 and 39.5 in the regular season.
Yim has yet to post scores in that range this season, but
she has only had one chance to do so.
Regionals marked Yim's debut in the All-Around for
Stanford, after she coped with an Achilles tendon injury
throughout the season. She ruptured her Achilles just
days after taking fourth place at Olympic trials last sum
mer. The injury kept Yim from competing in the Games.
Yim's performance at Regionals proved that she is
once again ready for action.
Yim's strengths are the balance beam and the uneven
bars. Smyth said that she has a good chance to make a
mark on the podium in one or both of those events. In
order to do so. Yim will have to qualify for Saturday
night's event finals by posting one of the top four event
scores on Thursday night.
In order to improve her shot at a title, Yim has up
graded her dismount off the balance beam from a
cartwheel with a one-and-a-half-twisting layout to a
round-off with a double-twisting layout. The improved
dismount should be easier to stick, since it does not have
a blind landing.
Yim might also upgrade her dismount off the uneven
bars. She has been performing a relatively simple dou
ble-back dismount to protect her Achilles, but she might
add a full twist if she qualifies for event finals.
The upgrade might make a crucial difference, since
the competition on bars will be tight. Yim was ranked
No. 7 in the event at the end of the regular season. Her
average score of 9.K94, however, was only 0.002 behind
that of top-ranked Schwikert.
