# Beecham's ethics questioned
## Councilman gets free tickets 
### KILLEEN HANSON STAFF WRITER 
After Palo Alto Council member Vic Ojakian re
ceived criticism for accepting free tickets to Stanford
sporting events in 2003. he said he decided against ac
cepting the offer again in 2004 "so as to avoid any ap
pearances of conflict." Palo Alto Council member
Bern Beecham took the opposite route and collected a
gift of free tickets from Stanford for the second year in
a row.
Beecham was within his legal rights, but his decision
has been met with an outcry from local watchdogs and
ethicists.
The California Fair Political Practices Commission
states that "State and local officials and employees are
prohibited from receiving a gift or gifts totaling more
than $360 in a calendar year from certain sources."
The restriction is designed to discourage officials
from granting individuals or organizations that provide
such perks any unfair preferences or privileges.
Beecham reported at the beginning of April that the
value of the tickets he received in 2004 did not exceed
$159.
Ojakian implied in an interview with The Daily that
the ethicists' criticism may lie in the fact that he and
Beecham serve on the City of Palo Alto's liaison com
mittee. This committee works closely with Stanford on
a variety of issues, including those concerning the Uni
versity's land use.
"In the past, the land use issue has caused concern
among members of the Palo Alto public," Ojakian
said. "In recent years there has been more of a focus on
finding mutually beneficial actions. We meet jointly in
a liaison committee and explore ways to work together
for the good of Palo Alto and Stanford. We've talked
about how to improve the Caltrain station's area and
other matters."
However, the concern over the two council mem
bers' acceptance of the tickets is not that the Universi-

ty might buy the loyalty of the men,
said Kirk Hanson, executive direc
tor of the Markkula Center for Ap
plied Ethics at Santa Clara Univer
sity, in a Palo Alto Weekly article
published last April. Rather, some
argue that the tickets will increase
bias favoring Stanford.
In the same article, Beecham
said that he sees nothing wrong
with attending Stanford sporting
events. Rather, doing so provides
an opportunity to interact with
local citizens. There is an advan
tage, he added, in meeting with
members of the community out
side of City Hall and in a more re
laxed setting.

Ojakian said that he also at
tends events at Stanford as a way to
show the residents of Palo Alto
that he is accessible, adding that
the gifts in no way influenced the
policies he supports.
"No one should conclude that
means I'll vote a certain way," he
added. "I've voted for or against
Stanford projects in the past."
The Stanford Office of Public
Affairs offers the tickets to offi
cials and others as a way for the
University to reach out and invite
Palo Alto residents to events on
campus.
Jean McCown, director of com
munity relations for the Universi
ty, said interaction between Stan
ford and Palo Alto is frequent and
friendly. She added that Stanford
makes use of the city's fire service
and that Palo Alto also leases some
sites on Stanford land, including

various utility facilities and nearby
public schools.
"We traditionally invite commu
nity members to a variety of events
on campus," McCown said. "These
may include sporting events. Lively
Arts events and events like Commu
nity Day. We use the opportunities
to invite our neighbors, not just offi
cials. In the case of the sporting
events, where there is a monetary
price affixed to the tickets, the offi
cials can report the tickets."
She added that she sees no
problem with gifting tickets to
Beecham and other local political
figures.
"These events are good oppor
tunities to build relationships with
our neighbors and are our way of
extending hospitality to the com
munity," McCown said. "There
should be no sense of obligation, no
more than anv social invitation."
