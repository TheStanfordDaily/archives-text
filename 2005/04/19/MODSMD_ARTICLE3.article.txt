# Beecham's ethics questioned
## Councilman gets free tickets 
### KILLEEN HANSON STAFF WRITER 
After Palo Alto Council member Vic Ojakian re

sporting events in 2003. he said he decided against ac

the ethicists' criticism may lie in the fact that he and
Beecham serve on the City of Palo Alto's liaison com

finding mutually beneficial actions. We meet jointly in
a liaison committee and explore ways to work together
for the good of Palo Alto and Stanford. We've talked
about how to improve the Caltrain station's area and
other matters."
