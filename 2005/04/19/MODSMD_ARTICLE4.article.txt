### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Hoover Institution Fellow
Kiron Skinner was recently appointed
by President George W. Bush to the Na
tional Security Education Board, or
NSEB. Skinner, also an assistant profes
sor of history and political science at
Carnegie Mellon University, specializes

in American foreign policy, internation
al relations and international security.
The NSEB will be Skinner's third ap
pointment to an executive advisory com
mittee. Since 2(H) 1. she has been a mem
ber of Defense Secretary Donald Rums
feld's Defense Policy Board. In2oo4,she
became a member of the Chief of Naval
Operations Executive Panel.
The NSEB was formed in December

-1991 under the National Security Educa
tion Act. which aims to educate U.S. cit
izens about foreign cultures, strengthen
U.S. economic competitiveness and en
hance international cooperation and se
curity.
The NSEB oversees and advises the
administration of the National Security
Education Program, or NSEP, which
provides undergraduate scholarships

and graduate fellowships to students
who wish to study languages and cul
tures in areas that are critical to U.S. na
tional security and that are underrepre
sented by study-abroad programs.
Skinner, who is particularly interest
ed in the Middle East, will serve a four
year term on the 13-member board,
which is comprised of seven federal offi-
ciuls and six non-federal officials.
All board members are appointed
by the U.S. president.
"We need Americans to really
understand cultures and have com
mand of foreign languages," Skin
ner said.
While Skinner has already met
with the board and is familiar with
its work, she said she looks forward
to getting fully involved as she as
sumes her position later this spring.
"My main goal is to make sure
the program meets the best scholar
ly standards for the study of foreign
languages and cultures," Skinner
said.
She added that she hopes par

ticipants who complete the lan
guage and cultural training pro
grams run by the NSEP will be
given the opportunity to use their
knowledge in governmental work.
Skinner's colleague Peter
Schweizer, a research fellow at the
Hoover Institution, said he is proud
of her appointment and feels that
she is a good fit for the position.
"The National Security Educa
tion Board needs first-rate scholars
who take national security very se
riously," Schweizer said. "Believe it
or not, it can be hard to find that
combination. 1 think Kiron Skinner
fits that description perfectly."
Skinner worked at the Hoover
Institution in the early 1990s for
former Secretary of State and
Hoover Fellow George Shultz. She
became a Hoover fellow herself in
1995.
Skinner said she feels that her af

filiation with the Hoover Institu
tion has proven to he an invaluable
resource for her work in foreign
policy and will continue to serve her
well in the future.
"The Hoover Institution has a
wonderful archive for those study
ing foreign relations, and I've made
extensive use of the archives," Skin
ner said.
She added that she plans to con
tinue learning from her interactions
with other Hoover Fellows and
other visitors to the Stanford cam
pus.
"Hoover's work is at the inter
section of history, theory and poli
cy," Skinner said. "1 really hope to
confer with Stanford's distin
guished scholars and visitors as I
work to make the NSEP scholarly
and relevant to the challenges the
U.S. is currently facing."
New York University graduate

student Leslie Johns, who worked
with Skinner for over three years at
Carnegie Mellon University, said
she is confident that Skinner will be
an excellent addition to the NSHB.
"She's a wonderful educator
who is deeply committed to both
her students and her academic re
search," Johns said. "Despite her
busy schedule, she has also dedicat
ed much of her time to public ser
vice. Kiron has a unique back
ground as both a political scientist
and a historian, and I am confident
that her dedication and diverse
skills will be beneficial to the
NSEB's work."
Among many other accomplish
ments. Skinner is the editor of two
books on Ronald Reagan — "Rea
gan: A Life in Letters"in 2001 and
"Reagan, in His Own Hand" in
2003 — both which made The New
York Times Bestsellers list.
