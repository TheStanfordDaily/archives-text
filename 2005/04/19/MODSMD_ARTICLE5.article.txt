# Seniors post college rejection letters at local high school
## Gunn seniors shun rejection 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
Harvard. Princeton. Yale. Stanford. Gunn
High School seniors have been rejected from
all of them. And instead of therapy, they are
turning to a new tradition.
For the second straight year, some Gunn se
niors are venting their frustration and disap
pointment with the college process by publicly
posting rejection letters for all their classmates
to see. Dubbed "The Wall of Rejection." the
bulletin board sits in a shadowy, open-air pas
sageway near a sun-drenched courtyard where
students gather to relax between classes.
"It's a community-builder," said Anne-
Marie Balzone, Gunn's assistant principal for
college guidance. The wall, she added, was
conceived of by students and is voluntary. "1
think it helps students deal with the process."
This proved true for Gunn senior Chris
Carlsson. who initially posted his rejection let
ter from UCLA just for kicks.
"It was the first letter I got, and the wall was

looking empty," he said, adding that he will be at
tending UC Santa Cruz in the fall. "But now I
talk to people who got letters from the same
school."
Most Gunn seniors do not post on the wall.
There are more than 400 seniors in this year's
graduating class, but just 40 letters are taped
up. many of them from the same people.
"I don't feel like I need to post them." said
senior Kevin Rui. who has chosen Santa Clara
University.
Senior Stephanie Yee — rejected from Har
vard. Stanford and Johns Hopkins — agreed.
"I don't see the point," she said. Yee will at
tend Cal-Berkeley in the fall.
An unintended consequence of the wall, Rui
said, is the fear it inspires in juniors, who pay
more attention to the postings than seniors.
"It's a preview of what's to come," he
added, a message not lost on junior Danielle
Negrin.
"It's very intimidating." she said. "I lose a

Balzone said she understood
how underclassmen could be
frightened, but noted that the
postings might help them keep re

"It's an eye-opener for ju
niors," she said.
The most represented school on
the wall is UCLA, with six rejec

four from UC Santa Barbara and
two each from the University of
Southern California, Stanford and
Berkeley.
And while the directors of ad

dents, most are spared the fate of
Christine N. Van Gieson, director
of admissions at UCSB. On one
letter, her name is circled in pencil,
with the words "most hated per
son" scribbled in jagged print.
The majority of the graffiti and
decorations on the wall, however,
are not spiteful, but expressions of
disappointment, humor and self
deprecation.

letter, someone has written "Party

freshman spots was tough, with
4.000 high school seniors applying.
