DESK ENTROPY
Definition
Desk entropy is a spatiody
namic quantity that measures
a workspace's degree of
disorder, and the inability to
find anything when you really
need it.
Any spontaneous activity,
whether productive or unpro
ductive, disperses crap matter
and increases overall desk
entropy.
Efforts to reverse desk entropy
are temporary, and inevitably
decrease over time
