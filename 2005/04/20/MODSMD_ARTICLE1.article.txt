Habemus papam! We have a Pope! Bavarian Car
dinal Joseph Ratzinger from Germany was elected
the 265 th pope on Tuesday. April 19, by the 115 car
dinals who convened in the Sistine Chapel. Bells
were rung, white smoke billowed into the sky and 78-
year-old Ratzinger officially took on the name Bene
dict XVI.
"From what I've heard, the new pope seems to be a
very warm, personable man, which stands in contrast to
his perceived hardness that comes across in his writ
ings," said Father Carl Schlichte. acting director for the
Catholic Community at Stanford. "I hope with the ex
ample of his predecessor John Paul 11. that this humani
ty will be manifest to the Church and the world during
these next years."
Schlichte said he was surprised by the selection of the
name Benedict XVI, explaining that Benedict XV
served as pope during World War I and aimed to make
peace while maintaining Vatican neutrality.
"Perhaps in our current world that seems to be in a
state of conflict, Benedict XVI is hoping to bring his
skills as a diplomat and peacemaker to the forefront in
the same way the predecessor from whom he took his
name did," Schlichte said.
