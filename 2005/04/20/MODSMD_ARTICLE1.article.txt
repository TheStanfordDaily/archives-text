# German cardinal named new Pope

### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Habemus papam! We have a Pope! Bavarian Car
dinal Joseph Ratzinger from Germany was elected
the 265 th pope on Tuesday. April 19, by the 115 car
dinals who convened in the Sistine Chapel. Bells
were rung, white smoke billowed into the sky and 78-
year-old Ratzinger officially took on the name Bene
dict XVI.
"From what I've heard, the new pope seems to be a
very warm, personable man, which stands in contrast to
his perceived hardness that comes across in his writ
ings," said Father Carl Schlichte. acting director for the
Catholic Community at Stanford. "I hope with the ex
ample of his predecessor John Paul 11. that this humani
ty will be manifest to the Church and the world during
these next years."
Schlichte said he was surprised by the selection of the
name Benedict XVI, explaining that Benedict XV
served as pope during World War I and aimed to make
peace while maintaining Vatican neutrality.
"Perhaps in our current world that seems to be in a
state of conflict, Benedict XVI is hoping to bring his
skills as a diplomat and peacemaker to the forefront in
the same way the predecessor from whom he took his
name did," Schlichte said.

Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Germany was elected
by a conclave of cardinals as the 265 th pope.
Ratzinger took the title of Pope Benedict XVI.
Some students agree with Pope
Benedict XYTs self-characterization
as "a simple, humble worker in the
vineyard of the Lord." as he said in his
first Papal speech.
"I am thrilled to hear that Joseph
Cardinal Ratzinger was elected Pope
Benedict XVI." sophomore Dennis
Adams said. "I have complete faith in
the Holy Spirit that he will do a fan
tastic job as the leader of the Church.
I had originally speculated that this
Pope would be from Latin America,
but 1 was not surprised that Cardinal
Ratzinger was elected. He was a great
servant of the Church during Pope
John Paul IPs pontificate, and 1 know
that he will serve the Church equally
well as Pope."
Junior Alex Rivas said he was dis
appointed by the cardinals' choice,
adding that he hopes that Pope Bene
dict XVI will merely serve as a transi
tional pope who will not make the
church more restrictive.
"I feel a bit alienated from the cen
tral church in Rome right now," said
Rivas. a Roman Catholic. "The gap
between my personal beliefs and
those of the central church is growing.
American Catholics are much more
liberal than the church in Rome, and I
was disappointed that the church's

leaders chose someone who is conser
vative and not from outside of Eu
rope."
Rivas said he believes that the
church leaders could have done a bet
ter job of addressing the needs and
concerns of all Catholics by paying
more attention to Africa and Latin
America.
"Hopefully it will turn out that the
reformers in Rome will be able to
make progress after a short transi
tional reign of Pope Benedict XVI,"
Rivas said.
Adams, however, said he hopes
that the new Pope will bring unity to
the Church.
"I know that in the American
church there is a significant rift be
tween what the church teaches and
what the American Catholics be
lieve," Adams said. "However. I do
not believe that changing the church's
stance on issues such as birth control,
priestly celibacy and the ordination of
women is a solution to bridging the
rift."
He added that the role of the
church is not to adopt the views of the
majority but to represent the truth.
"So if the Holy Spirit has revealed
to the church the positions to take on
those issues, then those are the posi
tions that we Catholics should faith
fully accept," Adams said. "Ratzinger
has a history of defending these views
strictly, so I feel secure in knowing
that he will not sacrifice moral truths
for popularity."
