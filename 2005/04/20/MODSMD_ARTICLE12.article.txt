On April 20, 1999, The Daily ran
an article on how some professors
were concerned with the partisan na
ture of the Hoover Institution.. Below
is an excerpt:
National coverage of Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's possible 2000
presidential bid has included reports
on his exploratory committee, which
reads like a laundry list of current
and past Hoover Institution fellows,
including Provost Condoleezza
Rice.
The attention has raised long
standing issues regarding the institu
tion's relationship to the University,
as well as questions about the appro
priateness of cross-appointments be
tween the University and the institu
tion.
"Stanford's affiliation with the
Hoover Institution is again involving

the University in national politics,"
wrote Political Science Prof. John
Manley and English Prof. Ron Reb
holz in a recent letter to The Daily.
They urged the University commu
nity to ask itself, "What are the costs,
not just the benefits, of deepening
and continuing [University] rela
tions with Hoover?"
"By way of the Hoover Institu
tion, Stanford is being associated
with partisan politics and it hap
pens to be conservative, but I don't
want to stand for its name (being
cited] on the liberal side either.
When it happens, however, it al
ways happens on the conservative
side, because it is Hoover," Reb
holz said.
Rice observed that the relation
ship between Hoover and the Bush
campaign may have less to do with a
general institutional stance than
with the fact that many of its fellows

served in the administration of
Bush's father. President Bush.
On April 20,1977, The Daily cov
ered a story about the University
Provost advocating fora change in
an undergraduate student's chemistry
grade. Below is an excerpt:
A statement by Provost William
Miller that he would favor changing
an undergraduate's grade is the first
time in University history that an ad
ministrator has overruled a profes
sor on grading, according to Om
budsman John Goheen.
In a confidential letter acquired
by the Daily, Miller wrote he favored
changing a grade Chemistry Prof.
William Bonner gave to sophomore
Peter Cohen from a B to an A-.
Cohen began his grievance over
his Chemistry 33 grade 13 months
ago.
Bonner can appeal Miller's rec
ommendation to President Richard
Lyman. Bonner hung up. though,
when the Daily called him for com
ments on the case.
According to Goheen. until 1974.
professors' grade decisions were
final. In 1974, he said, an academic
grievance procedure was estab
lished. with a chain of appeals from
department chairmen up to the pres
ident.
This is the first case under the
grievance procedure, Goheen said,
where a student has won the appeal.
