# But that's not the point...
## R U There, God? It's me, Netiquette 
### 
One of the most interesting things
to observe in college is the changing re
lationship of students to technology,
especially the Internet. I can't imagine

college without In
stant Messenger.
The idea of having
to walk to some
one's room to find
them for dinner or
call them every
time you want to
share a funny story
is beyond me.

j ,
the advent of thefacebook.com has
again revolutionized college life, and
people who graduated even as recently
as 2004 have no idea how useful it is, es
pecially for Internet stalking.
I often wonder if this reliance on the
Internet is going to change when we
graduate. Are my co-workers going to
sit in their cubicles and 1M me, or am I
just going to have to leave that part of
my life behind?
1 sure hope not. The Internet has
become a vital part of my social life. I
have facebook friends, and I have real
friends. 1 have people I can have great
AIM conversations with, and people I
can have great real conversations with.
1 owe some of my best friendships
to the convenience of AIM. Some peo
ple see this as a problem. These people
are not on the facebook.
1 won't go into my theories about
why AIM is a brilliant technology. My
real subject is more complicated. If
you've ever played Trivial Pursuit 90's
Edition, then you've probably gotten
the question about what etiquette is
called on the Internet. The answer to
this question is, obviously, Netiquette.
However, netiquette itself can be
quite obscure. It is an art form, like cre
ating the perfect mixtape, and as such
it has certain rules. Some people do not
obey these rules. I tend to chalk this up
to stubbornness — refusal to join the
Internet world, and therefore opposi
tion to me and my kind. However. I'm
giving you the benefit of the doubt and
writing them down for you:
Do not make your background one
color and your font another color.
Your font must also be of a practical
size. Avoid the extremes. No Arial size
22 or 8(I have been guilty of the latter).
And I hate it when 1 copy and paste,
and another person's font infects mine,
although I guess I can't blame you for
expressing yourself.
Punctuation, capitalization, apos
trophes: these are optional. So is good
spelling and grammar. However, I am
assuming that you will spell out all of
your words. If you ask me, "r u there?"
I will not respond. "LOL" is forbidden,
and 'ROTFLMAO" deserves mock
ing. "Brb" and "ttyl" are acceptable
only because they are businesslike
things to say in the first place.
You must have an away message,
preferably with details. An away mes
sage tells a lot about a person, so select
yours carefully. For example, quoting
yourself is very risky. And of course
the selection of an away message is
very important if you are quoting any
kind of song lyric, because people like
me will read into that shit. This is your
warning.
Finally, if you have i am away from
my computer right now," I promise
you that somewhere out there I am en
raged.
Show that you are idle. I know it
shows people you don't want to talk to
that you are at your computer and ig
noring them, but if you care that much
you can just lie.
Although 1 am anti-emoticon in
principle. I admit that I use them. They
are really only acceptable when they
are in a very small font and therefore
easy to ignore, or when you use the
giant cheesy smile with lots of teeth.
The thing is sometimes you need that
little yellow smiley-face to make sure
people know you're being good-hu
mored instead of angry or bitter.
Why do people put links to their on
line blogs or diaries in their profiles?
Do you really want the entire world to
know that you are pissed off or lonely?
If so, go ahead. But I personally don't
understand you.
1 seem ridiculous, but I say all these
things because I truly believe that In
stant Messaging is an "increasingly
valid form of expression," to quote
Murray from "Clueless." There are
guidelines and delicacies in real life, so
why not in virtual life? Please, if you
are a regular user of AIM. or even if
you only use it sporadically (to quote
Clueless again). use proper netiquette!

Show that you are idle. I know it
shows people you don't want to talk to
that you are at your computer and ig
noring them, but if you care that much
you can just lie.
Although 1 am anti-emoticon in
principle. I admit that I use them. They
are really only acceptable when they
are in a very small font and therefore
easy to ignore, or when you use the
giant cheesy smile with lots of teeth.
The thing is sometimes you need that
little yellow smiley-face to make sure
people know you're being good-hu

Why do people put links to their on
line blogs or diaries in their profiles?
Do you really want the entire world to

If so, go ahead. But I personally don't

1 seem ridiculous, but I say all these
things because I truly believe that In
stant Messaging is an "increasingly
valid form of expression," to quote
Murray from "Clueless." There are
guidelines and delicacies in real life, so
why not in virtual life? Please, if you
are a regular user of AIM. or even if
you only use it sporadically (to quote
Clueless again). use proper netiquette!
