### LAURA CARWILE STAFF WRITER 
With Spring Quarter finally here, most stu
dents are finding time to relax and worry less
than in previous months. But with the Draw
coming up, students are faced with a decision
that will affect many aspects of their life next
year: Who will they room with?

Many students have had bad experiences
with roommates — especially freshman year,
when they have absolutely no idea who they'll
be living with and no choice in the matter —
and these students know how important it is to
have a compatible student to live with. So here,
to make your hardest Spring Quarter decision
a little easier, is a Letterman-esque top ten list
of things to look for in your next roommate.

Someone who likes the same decor that you do. Not the biggest deal
in the world, but it's nice to share a room with someone who loves
pink just as much as you do. You don't want to fight over her huge
Led Zeppelin poster when you need the wall for Britney Spears. "1
love my roommate because she and I love the colors green and yel
low." said freshmen Clea Alsip. "It makes our room look
nicer and it bonds us — if either of us find something cute, we
know the other one will like it!"

Someone who feels the same as you do about sharing. A
roommate who is constantly borrowing things may not seem
like a problem to some, but it can really grate on your nerves
when they throw on your newest pair of jeans before you've
gotten the chance to break them in. Sharing is a personal
thing, and many people feel differently about it, but just
make sure that if you like keeping your things to yourself,
your new roommate knows that.

Someone who is clean (or isn't, if you aren't either). Everyone wants the
roommate who will selflessly clean up after them, but unfortunately
those kind of people are one in a million."I love when my roommate
makes my bed and holds my hair back when I'm sick," said freshman

Evan Brown. Instead, you should find a roommate whose cleaning
habits resemble yours. It might seem like a clean roommate will
keep a messy one from getting buried in her own clothes, but it
could cause more conflict to have two different cleaning abilities

under the same roof. Try to find someone who treats their room the
same way you do. and then you can share in the joys of a clean room

together (or the acute misery of being the messiest room on the floor).

Someone who respects the tie on the door, but doesn't abuse it. We all

know the universal symbol for "don't come in right now!" But just
because you've taken the time to drape the doorhandle with your
hair accessory doesn't mean that your roommate will respect it. If
this will be a problem for you, make sure you find a roommate who
respects when you need a few hours in the room with someone who
isn't your roommate. However, this can go the other way: make

sure you aren't living with someone who thinks a con
stantly-clothed doorknob is okay. You live there too.

Someone with a compatible sleep schedule. Sleeping is
one of the most important things a college student will do,
and for that reason it is important for you to do some re
search into your potential roommmate's sleeping habits.
If you don't want the light on at 5 a.m., and she doesn't
want it on at midnight, you might consider finding some
one who, like you, is either a morning or night owl.

Someone who may be a friend, but won't be an enemy. We are
all probably planning on living with a friend, and hopefully a
good one. However, it may not be the best idea to live with your

best friend if you don't know what she's like to live with. Re
member that as much as you love someone, living with them

may be a different story. "I live with my friends," said
sophomore Mackenzie Cooper. "It has made us grow

closer, because we are good at living together."
Choose your friend-roommate based on her compati
bility qualities, not the strength of your friendship, be

cause what you don't want at the end of the year is an in

compatible ex-friend who is still living in the same room.

Someone who respects privacy. This one is pretty self
explanatory. Have a journal? Secret computer
files? A crush on your RA? Make sure your room-
mate understands that before you lived with her.
you (hopefully) didn't have to hide your stuff. It
might be smart to keep quiet about things you don't

want her to know, but because you'll be living to- i
gether, it's important to have a roommate who (
isn't going to go searching through your desk with- \
out your permission or inviting her 50 closest *
friends to sleep in your bed when you're gone.

Someone who has her own life. You don't want a roommate who
waits in her bed all day for you to get back so you can hang out to
gether. You are already living with this person, which implies a lot

of time together, so you should look for someone who has their
own life here. Playing sports all day, spending hours in the li

brary or hanging out with a different crowd may not seem like
qualities that make a perfect roommate, but the reality is that

you're already sharing a room — you don't have to, and
probably don't want to, share your whole life.

Someone whom you respect as a person. Yeah, yeah,
it may sound cheesy, but imagine how hard it is to
live with someone with qualities that you dislike
about human nature in general. Hate laziness? How
will you feel with a roommate who sleeps 19 hours
a day? Can't stand liars? Then don't choose one as
your roommate. You don't have to love everything

about them — we all have annoying qualities that we are
trying to change. Just makq sure that you respect the per
son enough, because if you don't, you'll be sleeping in
your friend's room just to get away from them.

Someone you can talk to about problems. Just like
in a good relationship, good roommates know

that the most important thing to have is com
munication. Ignoring the problems, even the
little ones, may seem like a good idea for the
moment, but in the long run, it leads to a
greater chance of a blow-up come April. "My
roommate and I talk about everything," said
freshman Liz Kreiner. "Living together made

us better friends, and we know when something
is wrong, so we always talk about it." The best

roommate is someone who you can talk about stuff
with, even if you don't necessarily like her love of
dark brown or her taste in guys.

With Spring Quarter finally here, most stu
dents are finding time to relax and worry less
than in previous months. But with the Draw
coming up, students are faced with a decision
that will affect many aspects of their life next
year: Who will they room with?

Many students have had bad experiences
with roommates — especially freshman year,
when they have absolutely no idea who they'll
be living with and no choice in the matter —
and these students know how important it is to
have a compatible student to live with. So here,
to make your hardest Spring Quarter decision
a little easier, is a Letterman-esque top ten list
of things to look for in your next roommate.

Someone who likes the same decor that you do. Not the biggest deal
in the world, but it's nice to share a room with someone who loves
pink just as much as you do. You don't want to fight over her huge
Led Zeppelin poster when you need the wall for Britney Spears. "1
love my roommate because she and I love the colors green and yel
low." said freshmen Clea Alsip. "It makes our room look
nicer and it bonds us — if either of us find something cute, we
know the other one will like it!"

Someone who feels the same as you do about sharing. A
roommate who is constantly borrowing things may not seem
like a problem to some, but it can really grate on your nerves
when they throw on your newest pair of jeans before you've
gotten the chance to break them in. Sharing is a personal
thing, and many people feel differently about it, but just
make sure that if you like keeping your things to yourself,
your new roommate knows that.

Someone who is clean (or isn't, if you aren't either). Everyone wants the
roommate who will selflessly clean up after them, but unfortunately
those kind of people are one in a million."I love when my roommate
makes my bed and holds my hair back when I'm sick," said freshman

Evan Brown. Instead, you should find a roommate whose cleaning
habits resemble yours. It might seem like a clean roommate will
keep a messy one from getting buried in her own clothes, but it
could cause more conflict to have two different cleaning abilities

under the same roof. Try to find someone who treats their room the
same way you do. and then you can share in the joys of a clean room

together (or the acute misery of being the messiest room on the floor).

Someone who respects the tie on the door, but doesn't abuse it. We all

know the universal symbol for "don't come in right now!" But just
because you've taken the time to drape the doorhandle with your
hair accessory doesn't mean that your roommate will respect it. If
this will be a problem for you, make sure you find a roommate who
respects when you need a few hours in the room with someone who
isn't your roommate. However, this can go the other way: make

sure you aren't living with someone who thinks a con
stantly-clothed doorknob is okay. You live there too.

Someone with a compatible sleep schedule. Sleeping is
one of the most important things a college student will do,
and for that reason it is important for you to do some re
search into your potential roommmate's sleeping habits.
If you don't want the light on at 5 a.m., and she doesn't
want it on at midnight, you might consider finding some
one who, like you, is either a morning or night owl.

Someone who may be a friend, but won't be an enemy. We are
all probably planning on living with a friend, and hopefully a
good one. However, it may not be the best idea to live with your

best friend if you don't know what she's like to live with. Re
member that as much as you love someone, living with them

may be a different story. "I live with my friends," said
sophomore Mackenzie Cooper. "It has made us grow

closer, because we are good at living together."
Choose your friend-roommate based on her compati
bility qualities, not the strength of your friendship, be

cause what you don't want at the end of the year is an in

compatible ex-friend who is still living in the same room.

Someone who respects privacy. This one is pretty self
explanatory. Have a journal? Secret computer
files? A crush on your RA? Make sure your room-
mate understands that before you lived with her.
you (hopefully) didn't have to hide your stuff. It
might be smart to keep quiet about things you don't

want her to know, but because you'll be living to- i
gether, it's important to have a roommate who (
isn't going to go searching through your desk with- \
out your permission or inviting her 50 closest *
friends to sleep in your bed when you're gone.

Someone who has her own life. You don't want a roommate who
waits in her bed all day for you to get back so you can hang out to
gether. You are already living with this person, which implies a lot

of time together, so you should look for someone who has their
own life here. Playing sports all day, spending hours in the li

brary or hanging out with a different crowd may not seem like
qualities that make a perfect roommate, but the reality is that

you're already sharing a room — you don't have to, and
probably don't want to, share your whole life.

Someone whom you respect as a person. Yeah, yeah,
it may sound cheesy, but imagine how hard it is to
live with someone with qualities that you dislike
about human nature in general. Hate laziness? How
will you feel with a roommate who sleeps 19 hours
a day? Can't stand liars? Then don't choose one as
your roommate. You don't have to love everything

about them — we all have annoying qualities that we are
trying to change. Just makq sure that you respect the per
son enough, because if you don't, you'll be sleeping in
your friend's room just to get away from them.

Someone you can talk to about problems. Just like
in a good relationship, good roommates know

that the most important thing to have is com
munication. Ignoring the problems, even the
little ones, may seem like a good idea for the
moment, but in the long run, it leads to a
greater chance of a blow-up come April. "My
roommate and I talk about everything," said
freshman Liz Kreiner. "Living together made

us better friends, and we know when something
is wrong, so we always talk about it." The best

roommate is someone who you can talk about stuff
with, even if you don't necessarily like her love of
dark brown or her taste in guys.
