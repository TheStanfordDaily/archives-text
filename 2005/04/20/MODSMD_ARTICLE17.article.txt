## Editorial University and students need to aid efforts to stop drunk driving 
### 
II you drove down Palm Drive on Saturday night,
you were in lor a hit of a surprise: blinding lights com
ing from a DUI checkpoint where the Stanford De
partment of Public Safety, with officers from the Los
Altos and Palo Alto police, led an effort to decrease
drunk driving on campus.
Drunk driving is a serious matter, and this and fu
ture public safety efforts ought to be supported by the
University and students. Enforcement efforts such as
checkpoints should be complemented by more inno
vative approaches such as expanding student trans
portation services and holding more on-campus activ
ities, particularly on the weekends.
At Stanford, it is difficult to determine the preva
lence of drunk driving. The difficulty getting off cam
pus and the density of the campus party scene lead
many to believe that Stanford students do not drive
drunk. On the other hand, when the temperature
drops at night, driving rather than walking to parties
can become tempting. And while almost everyone
seems to agree when sober that driving drunk is not
worth the risk, drunk students do not always view the
world in such a rational manner.
The checkpoint on Saturday provided a strong de
terrent to students who would consider driving while
even slightly inebriated. The checkpoint makes the
possibility of being caught and punished fora DUI
seem much more real, and it emphasizes the serious
ness of the situation.
We believe that continued use of DUI checkpoints

will assist in decreasing drunk driving, but the Stan
ford Police cannot be alone in their efforts. The Uni
versity should assist in providing on-campus trans
portation; otherwise, students may try to find ways
around the checkpoints and possibly endanger other
neighborhoods by driving in the areas surrounding
campus.
With the exception of the Marguerite's Midnight
Express, which runs from the Palo Alto train station
to main campus every 30 minutes until 2:30 a.m. on
Friday and Saturday nights, and 5-SURE, there are
few options for getting around campus late at night on
the weekend. Because the Midnight Express does not
offer door-to-door pick-up, and because many stu
dents, particularly males, do not know if 5-SURE ser
vices apply to them, neither of these options is ideal.
Creating a Marguerite line dedicated to circling the
Campus Drive loop on weekend nights and expand
ing 5-SURE services — increasing the number of
carts and drivers, and clearly publicizing the pro
gram's mission to the student body — would provide
students with more alternatives to driving drunk.
Finally, while many students on a given weekend
night will not go off-campus to party, some of those
who are bored with campus life will. Getting drunk
off-campus and potentially having to leave a car far
away encourages students to consider drunk driving.
If there were more to do on campus, there might not
be as many students who felt the need to leave.
