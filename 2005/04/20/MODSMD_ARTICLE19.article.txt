## Naming the next great white Pope 
### 
Every commentator and pundit is
going to tell you what the election of
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger means to
the future of the Roman Catholic
Church. Honestly, they're probably
well-versed in the issues and prob
lems facing the church and what the
election of this hard-line conservative
means to the future of the church.
But what about this name? Bene
dict XVI? Apart from the originality

being off the chart, who's named Benedict? Wasn't the
nerdy kid with the thick glasses in your school named
Benedict?
The pope chooses his own name â€” and does he ever
have some cool names to choose from: Urban, Innocent.
Hilarius, Pious and, of course, Nicholas are just a few of
the great ones. Nobody names a kid Urban or Hilarius,
so this was his chance to have a name that nobody else
had. Too bad.
Or he could have made up his own name. John Paul
li s predecessor. John Paul I was, obviously, the first of
his nominal line. And he's the pope, so nobody's going to
make fun of his name no matter how ridiculous it may be.
Did he ever consider taking a woman's name? How great
would that be if the new pope were called, say, Mary I?
He could have done worse, I suppose. There have
been 23 popes named John and 16 named Gregory, so
perhaps he chose Benedict to pull into a tie for second.
Maybe there's a competition up in heaven and the Bene
dicts have a pretty good crew going, and Ratzinger just
wanted in on it.
And here's some food for thought: Word is that the

next pope to take the name Peter (a la the first pope) will
signify that he or she marks the second coming of the
Lord. Who is going to go through life for some 70 years
feeling that he or she is the living God. waiting for it to be
revealed through a smoke signal? Come on people.
So it seems that our new pope blew it on the name
front. I mean, by the year 1 (KK) there had already been
seven Benedicts. There hasn't been a Nicholas in S(K)
years, but I'm not sure my letter to the Vatican urging
the new pope to take that name got there in time.
What do we know about other Benedicts? The first
Benedict served for only four years, from 575 to 579, and
not many records remain from his ever-so-brief papacy.
Benedict II went on to become the patron saint of Eu
rope, not half-bad fora Benedict. He is remembered as
a scholar and is known for his support of monasteries
around the Catholic world.
My favorite is Benedict IX. It is rumored that he was
only 11 years old when he became pope, although other
sources say he was 18. He sold his office 13 years into his
term for perhaps 650 kilograms of gold (which would be
worth about $10.5 million today) so that he could get mar
ried, then regretted his decision and retook the papacy.
More recently, Benedict XIV is remembered for pro
mulgating unpopular bulls that prompted many new
converts to leave the church. Benedict XV was pope dur
ing World War I and is largely considered to be one of
the least notable popes of the 20th century.
And this brings us to Benedict XVI. the first German
pope in a thousand years. While he may have chosen an
unoriginal, nerdy name, he is still the pope, and we
should respect him for that and wish him luck over the
coming years. He'll need it.
