# Student in critical condition
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Michael Johnson, a first-year busi
ness student at UC-Irvine who was res
cued by paramedics after nearly drown
ing in Avery Pool Sunday, was still in
critical condition at Stanford Hospital
as of 2 p.m. yesterday afternoon. The
Daily was unable to reach hospital offi
cials for comment by press time.
The 35-year-old was spotted sub

merged in the pool during an inner-tube
water polo match hosted by the Gradu
ate School of Business. It is uncertain
how long he was underwater before he
was pulled out.
911 was called at 10:13 a.m., and a
lifeguard and paramedics administered
CPR before Johnson was transported
by ambulance to the Stanford Medical
Center. He is currently joined by his im
mediate family, his girlfriend — also a
UC-Irvine business student — and

classmates. Additional information is
being withheld due to privacy concerns.
Classes were cancelled at the Paul
Merage School of Business at UC-
Irvine on Monday so that students, fac
ulty and staff could comfort each other
and attend a special non-denomination
al prayer and support meeting led by
members of the UC-Irvine Counseling
Center.
"Our thoughts, prayers and host
wishes are with our student and his fam
ily, and we extend our fervent hope for
his recovery," said Andrew Policaco,
dean of IJC -Irvine's Graduate School
of Management.
Members of the Stanford communi
ty have also extended their support to
Johnson's family and friends.
"()n behalf of Stanford faculty and
staff and Dean Robert Joss, who is out
of the country this week. I want to say
that our prayers and deepest concern
are with the family and friends of this
student, as well as with all of those who
were participating in this event," said

Dan Rudolph, senior associate dean of
the Stanford CiSB. "We continue to
work closely with our students, its well
as the UC-Irvine community and ex
tend our continuing concern and sup
port."
The inner-tube water polo match
was part of the CiSB s annual Challenge
For Charity, during which MBA pro
grams participate in friendly competi
tion to raise funds for charities like the
Special Olympics and the Ronald Mc-
Donald House.
Stanford Challenge for Charity
weekend games began on Friday and
included the business schools of the
University of Washington, Pepperdine,
the University of Southern California,
UCLA, UC-Davis, Stanford, UC-
Irvine and UC-Berkeley. The last day
of activities was cancelled following the
