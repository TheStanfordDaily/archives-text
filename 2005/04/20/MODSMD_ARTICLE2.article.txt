# Student in critical condition
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Michael Johnson, a first-year busi
ness student at UC-Irvine who was res
cued by paramedics after nearly drown
ing in Avery Pool Sunday, was still in
critical condition at Stanford Hospital
as of 2 p.m. yesterday afternoon. The
Daily was unable to reach hospital offi
cials for comment by press time.
The 35-year-old was spotted sub

merged in the pool during an inner-tube
water polo match hosted by the Gradu
ate School of Business. It is uncertain
how long he was underwater before he
was pulled out.
911 was called at 10:13 a.m., and a
lifeguard and paramedics administered
CPR before Johnson was transported
by ambulance to the Stanford Medical
Center. He is currently joined by his im
mediate family, his girlfriend — also a
UC-Irvine business student — and

classmates. Additional information is
being withheld due to privacy concerns.
Classes were cancelled at the Paul
Merage School of Business at UC-
Irvine on Monday so that students, fac
ulty and staff could comfort each other
and attend a special non-denomination
al prayer and support meeting led by
members of the UC-Irvine Counseling
Center.
