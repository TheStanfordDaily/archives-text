Editorial on Senate bill is
'wrong and unethical'
Fact is fact, and for the editorial
board to even bring up an historical
fact as being debatable is wrong and
unethical. The Stanford Daily
should look into the historical facts
of the Armenian Genocide ("Bill on
Armenian genocide falls out of Sen
ate's purview," April 19) before
making sweeping generalizations
that it was wrong to pass such a bill.
I am disgusted that the editorial
board would even decide to publish
such an article when not only the Cali
fornia legislature has passed such bills,
but numerous states throughout the
union, numerous cities and many
other countries.
In the future please look into the
facts surrounding such a sensitive
topic to many people in the world
before insulting a large part of the
community.

Daily propagates 'unjustified
stereotypes' about TAs
The Daily's editorial "Sketchy
TAs still a problem" (April 18) prop
agates largely unjustified stereotypes,
makes laughably absurd suggestions

and accuses nearly half of The Daily's
reading audience of unspeakable be
havior. What will next week's editori
al be, "Many men still rapists?"
Obviously graduate students do
and will cross the line between inap
propriate flirtation and outright ha
rassment. but almost certainly in less
than epidemic numbers. The sugges
tion that "increasing awareness" is
needed to combat this is mind-bog
gling. •
Is the author suggesting that the
average undergraduate is so clueless
that they don't know about any of
the myriad of ways to report harass
ment? Or that the average TA is so
stupid that they can't remember the
definition of sexual harassment from
one quarter to the next?
As for that nether region of be
havior which does not cross the line,
but is neither welcome nor appreci
ated, let's remember that the street
goes both ways. I cannot count the
number of times that students
shamelessly flirted with me or a col
league in an overt attempt to win
our favor. TAs will stop hitting on
students the day that students stop
hitting on TAs — which is to say,
never.
Finally, the tragi-comic sugges
tion that TAs forcibly sign a "code of
conduct" is beneath contempt. For

most of us, teaching is a labor of love
which consumes countless hours of
personal time with virtually no com
pensation besides the satisfaction of
a job well-done. The graduate stu
dent community awaits The Daily's
printed retraction and apology.

Genderfuk deserved more photos
The Daily's article on Genderfuk
("Students dress up for QSA drag
ball," April 18) was rather disappoint
ing given how awesome an event it
was. I'd say Genderfuk warranted a
whole slew of photos. You should
have at least shown a picture of Joey
Greenwell, or our Drag Oueen. Sky
lar. Where's the love?
There was also an error concerning
the Oueer Formal in your article that
1 found damaging, seeing as how I am
organizing the event: there will be a
Oueer Formal on May 7, not maybe.
It will be Stanford's first Oueer For
mal. It won't be an extravagant event,
seeing as how it is our virgin formal,
but it will still rock. Publicity for the
event is starting this week.
