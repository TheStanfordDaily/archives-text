In 1934 the
Nye Committee
was appointed to
figure out why
the United
States had en
tered World War
I and whether
the munitions
companies had
been behind our

involvement. Now the point of this
article has nothing to do with how
screwed up it is that we didn't know
why we entered a war in which
126,(HM) American soldiers lost their
lives. The point is that the committee
reported back that while Germany
owed America around $27 million,
Britain owed America around $2.3
billion — or N5 times as much. Some
have drawn the conclusion that we
entered the war because it was not in
our economic interest for Britain to
lose.
Now let's think about this a bit
more. We saved Britain's bacon and
altered the course of Western histo
ry. .. because they owed us money.
We saved them because they owed
us money. There's a fundamental
lesson here: In dealings between na
tions, the debtor is the one with the
power, not the creditor.
When one nation loans another
nation money, there is no mecha
nism for collection. There is no in
ternational repo man. If the Ger
mans conquer Britain we can't just
say. "Hey mates, we get dibs on Liv
erpool." No — if a nation suffers, its
creditor is the one that loses money.
This leads to some conclusions as
startling as the Lake Lag monster.
For instance, neither China nor
Japan can ever pursue policies (such
as war or sanctions) that will prove

economically ruinous to America,
because they've lent us so much
money that if we couldn't pay them
back, their economies would col
lapse.
World peace is potentially at
hand here! Every country should
just go out and hock itself. If Israel
owed a ton of money to various Mid
dle Eastern nations, no one would
attack it. They wouldn't want to
drive it into the sea. Because if they
destroy Israel, their own money is
gone.
If we had loaned a ton of money
to Sudan, we'd have an interest in
saying, "Look guys, it does your
agriculture-based economy no good
to kill all the farmers. Why don't you
settle down and get your economy
on track; or we'll shoot you and find
someone who'll do what we say, be
cause that's our money you're play
ing with right now!"
And maybe if we allowed pariah
nations like North Korea, Cuba and
Saddam's Iraq to freely export their
goods and use their profits to loan us
money (by buying our bonds and
stocks) they wouldn't constantly be
thinking of ways to attack us. You
can bet that Kim Jong II wouldn't
care about nukes if he were buying
diamonds for his blonde bombshells
with the dividends of Microsoft
stock. Because then wefd have
power over him. We'd be able to say,
"If you do this, we're just not gonna
pay you back," and he'd be screwed.
Whereas right now, we have no non
military way to hurt him.
So you see fellows, debt is the key
to world peace. Go out... and bor
row.
