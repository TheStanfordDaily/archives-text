## The 						Trouble with 'The Trouble with Islam' 
### OMAR SHAKIR 
On Monday evening, I attended
the event "Confessions of a Muslim
Dissident" featuring Irshad Manji,
the author of the top-selling book
"The Trouble with Islam."
To the casual observer, this event
aimed to highlight the courage of a
feminist Muslim leader in standing
up against the anti-Semitic, homo
phobic and misogynistic elements of
her faith and reforming her religion
in the face of widespread (and some
times violent) opposition. However,
if one scratches slowly beneath the
surface, it becomes apparent that
this event was consciously planned
and executed to bash an entire faith
as a means of scoring political points.
The motivations of the event's or
ganizational sponsors emphasize
this sad reality. Although Manji
boasted having a wide array of co
sponsors in her speech, the organiza
tion Manji's publicist contacted orig
inally to host the event was Hillel,
the major Jewish organization on
campus. According to most sources,
Hillel funded the majority of this
event, coordinated logistical plan
ning and only sought other co-spon
sorships after the event had been
planned.
Hillel's mission statement out
lines the ambitious goal of
"provid[ing| a connection to Jewish
life" and one of the major Jewish co
sponsors of this event Chabad de
fines its primary objective as "con
veyjing] a compelling, rich, and
meaningful Judaism that will inspire
all."

These objectives immediately
call into question what interest these
organizations had in hosting this
event and describing the necessity
fora reformation of Islam. These
groups serve important roles on
campus and should focus on the
wonderful missions they outline on
their Web sites.
If the genuine aim of the event
was to foster discussion about Islam,
one would assume that the hosting
organizations would notify and co
ordinate the event with campus
Muslim organizations, who dedicate
themselves to exactly that goal. Yet,
neither the Islamic Society of Stan
ford University nor the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network was in
formed about the event until last
Monday (long after the event was
scheduled). As an organization that
itself represents a religious commu
nity, Hillel has a unique responsibil
ity to maintain respect for other reli
gious communities and not host
events aimed at calling for reform in
another?s religion. By hosting such a
controversial event without consult
ing the targeted group, the event
served to create polarization, and
not dialogue.
Moreover. Manji's tone and sub
tle rhetorical insinuations paint the
picture of an outdated, intolerant Is
lamic faith. Without a scholarly
background in Islam and with only
her personal experience to guide
her, Manji makes many unwarrant
ed assertions about "her faith" in a
sarcastic, cynical manner without
any basis in textual scripture. Al
though she extensively praised Is

lamic history and tradition, she
made these points in order to criti
cize the Islamic faith as it is practiced
today.
To the resounding cheers of a
largely non-Stanford audience,
Manji suggested that Muslims today
do not engage in any independent
thought, believe in a vast worldwide
"Jewish Conspiracy," support slav
ery and can only exist in intolerant,
closed societies. By emphasizing her
"heroism' in standing up to institu
tional Islam, she further emphasized
the message of a backwards culture
in many Muslim countries. Her pa
tronizing tone and entertainer-like
style deliberately aimed to polarize
the Muslims in the audience, who
she claimed are governed only by
"emotion" and not reason.
Unfortunately, this event is not
an isolated incident — it is an exten
sion of an ongoing chain of Islamo
phobic events targeting Stanford
students by Hillel and other Jewish
on- and off-campus organizations.
Last year, Hillel brought Daniel
Pipes, who has publicly stated that
there is no harm in resorting to
Japanese-style internment camps
against Muslims today, to campus to
argue that militant Muslims are
those Muslims who actually practice
their faith.
This year, Jewish organizations
brought a professor who argued that
Arabs are untrustworthy and worse
than the Nazis (Ruth Wisse, who
spoke on Oct. 29, 2004), a gay Mus
lim to hHk about the way Muslims
abuse gays in their countries (Ali,
who spoke on Dec. 1, 2004). and an
Arab woman to discuss "the Arab
World's Hatred of America and Is

rael" (Nonie Darwish, who spoke on
Nov. 10,2004).
Just a few months ago, Hillel
hosted fervent racist David
Horowitz, who stated in his speech
that the anti-war and Muslim organi
zations on campus are "led by 60
Stalinists and include Muslim pro
terrorist groups" as well as "North
Korean Marxist-Leninist groups"
("Horowitz criticizes academia as
'leftist.' " Feb. 2).
These kinds of events serve to
create a hostile environment to
wards Muslims on campus. When
Hillel, a fully staffed and housed or
ganization with a nearly $1 million
annual operating budget, relentless
ly attacks Muslims at Stanford, who
lack a single staff person and are
comprised only of student leaders
operating with a meager $20,000 an
nual budget, not much can be done

to alter the tone of discourse on cam
pus.
In a post-Sept. 11 America where
Muslims are frequently targeted for
their beliefs and at a time in which
Stanford lacks an Islamic Studies
Program and fails to offer a basic
"Intro to Islam" course, these events
combine to create great misconcep
tions and stereotypes about Muslims
at Stanford. The recent breakdown
of relations between the Muslim and
Jewish communities on campus is
truly sad — however, real dialogue
cannot take place in the absence of
mutual respect for one another's be
liefs and cultures. Monday's event
proved that Hillel has little respect
for Muslims.

dent Awareness Network was in
formed about the event until last
Monday (long after the event was
scheduled). As an organization that
itself represents a religious commu
nity, Hillel has a unique responsibil
ity to maintain respect for other reli
gious communities and not host
events aimed at calling for reform in
another?s religion. By hosting such a
controversial event without consult
ing the targeted group, the event
served to create polarization, and
not dialogue.
Moreover. Manji's tone and sub
tle rhetorical insinuations paint the
picture of an outdated, intolerant Is
lamic faith. Without a scholarly
background in Islam and with only
her personal experience to guide
her, Manji makes many unwarrant
ed assertions about "her faith" in a
sarcastic, cynical manner without
any basis in textual scripture. Al
though she extensively praised Is

lamic history and tradition, she
made these points in order to criti
cize the Islamic faith as it is practiced
today.
To the resounding cheers of a
largely non-Stanford audience,
Manji suggested that Muslims today
do not engage in any independent
thought, believe in a vast worldwide
"Jewish Conspiracy," support slav
ery and can only exist in intolerant,
closed societies. By emphasizing her
"heroism' in standing up to institu
tional Islam, she further emphasized
the message of a backwards culture
in many Muslim countries. Her pa
tronizing tone and entertainer-like
style deliberately aimed to polarize
the Muslims in the audience, who
she claimed are governed only by
"emotion" and not reason.
Unfortunately, this event is not
an isolated incident — it is an exten
sion of an ongoing chain of Islamo
phobic events targeting Stanford
students by Hillel and other Jewish
on- and off-campus organizations.
Last year, Hillel brought Daniel
Pipes, who has publicly stated that
there is no harm in resorting to
Japanese-style internment camps
against Muslims today, to campus to
argue that militant Muslims are
those Muslims who actually practice
their faith.
This year, Jewish organizations
brought a professor who argued that
Arabs are untrustworthy and worse
than the Nazis (Ruth Wisse, who
spoke on Oct. 29, 2004), a gay Mus
lim to hHk about the way Muslims
abuse gays in their countries (Ali,
who spoke on Dec. 1, 2004). and an
Arab woman to discuss "the Arab
World's Hatred of America and Is

rael" (Nonie Darwish, who spoke on
Nov. 10,2004).
Just a few months ago, Hillel
hosted fervent racist David
Horowitz, who stated in his speech
that the anti-war and Muslim organi
zations on campus are "led by 60
Stalinists and include Muslim pro
terrorist groups" as well as "North
Korean Marxist-Leninist groups"
("Horowitz criticizes academia as
'leftist.' " Feb. 2).
These kinds of events serve to
create a hostile environment to
wards Muslims on campus. When
Hillel, a fully staffed and housed or
ganization with a nearly $1 million
annual operating budget, relentless
ly attacks Muslims at Stanford, who
lack a single staff person and are
comprised only of student leaders
operating with a meager $20,000 an
nual budget, not much can be done

to alter the tone of discourse on cam
pus.
In a post-Sept. 11 America where
Muslims are frequently targeted for
their beliefs and at a time in which
Stanford lacks an Islamic Studies
Program and fails to offer a basic
"Intro to Islam" course, these events
combine to create great misconcep
tions and stereotypes about Muslims
at Stanford. The recent breakdown
of relations between the Muslim and
Jewish communities on campus is
truly sad — however, real dialogue
cannot take place in the absence of
mutual respect for one another's be
liefs and cultures. Monday's event
proved that Hillel has little respect
for Muslims.

On Monday evening, I attended
the event "Confessions of a Muslim
Dissident" featuring Irshad Manji,
the author of the top-selling book
"The Trouble with Islam."
To the casual observer, this event
aimed to highlight the courage of a
feminist Muslim leader in standing
up against the anti-Semitic, homo
phobic and misogynistic elements of
her faith and reforming her religion
in the face of widespread (and some
times violent) opposition. However,
if one scratches slowly beneath the
surface, it becomes apparent that
this event was consciously planned
and executed to bash an entire faith
as a means of scoring political points.
The motivations of the event's or
ganizational sponsors emphasize
this sad reality. Although Manji
boasted having a wide array of co
sponsors in her speech, the organiza
tion Manji's publicist contacted orig
inally to host the event was Hillel,
the major Jewish organization on
campus. According to most sources,
Hillel funded the majority of this
event, coordinated logistical plan
ning and only sought other co-spon
sorships after the event had been
planned.
Hillel's mission statement out
lines the ambitious goal of
"provid[ing| a connection to Jewish
life" and one of the major Jewish co
sponsors of this event Chabad de
fines its primary objective as "con
veyjing] a compelling, rich, and
meaningful Judaism that will inspire
all."

These objectives immediately
call into question what interest these
organizations had in hosting this
event and describing the necessity
fora reformation of Islam. These
groups serve important roles on
campus and should focus on the
wonderful missions they outline on
their Web sites.
If the genuine aim of the event
was to foster discussion about Islam,
one would assume that the hosting
organizations would notify and co
ordinate the event with campus
Muslim organizations, who dedicate
themselves to exactly that goal. Yet,
neither the Islamic Society of Stan
ford University nor the Muslim Stu
dent Awareness Network was in
formed about the event until last
Monday (long after the event was
scheduled). As an organization that
itself represents a religious commu
nity, Hillel has a unique responsibil
