"Service is the rent we pay for living on
this earth," said Maya I larris, director of the
Racial Justice Project at the Northern Cali
fornia chapter of the American Civil Liber
ties Union during her speech last night.
Part of the Stanford Black Pre-law Soci
ety's speaker series, the talk focused on 1 lar
ris's career path with emphasis on her cur
rent work in public interest law.
After graduating from Stanford Law
School in 1W2,1 larris worked as a corporate
litigator for several years, during which mak
ing money to support her family and pay off
her student loans was her chief priority.
Though she said that she learned a great deal
from working in the corporate sector, she
found it difficult to be passionate about her
work and the clients she represented.
It was "just a job." she said.
Harris said she made the transition to
public interest law because "that's why I
went to law school here in the first place."
Before joining the ACLU, she served as
dean of Lincoln Law School in San Jose at
age 29, and was perhaps the youngest law
school dean in the country, she said.
"It is not always easy to make the transi
tion from a corporate law firm to public in
terest law," Harris said, adding that her own
transition was made easier by the numerous
connections she had made within the field at
Stanford.
In this vein, Harris said that every oppor
tunity she has had "was a door that had been
opened by a relationship I built in the first

five years of law school."
In a way. her job at the ACLU was made
possible by one such contact, Angela Black
well, an advisory council member at Boalt
Law School at UC-Berkeley. who presented
Harris with the opportunity.
Harris said that Blackwell has been one
of her most important role models during
her law career.
"One thing as a young woman of color is
that you do not meet a lot of mentors who
look like you," she said.
At the ACLU, Harris has tackled various
issues related to discrimination, including
racial profiling, the elimination of racial jus
tice disparities in the criminal justice system
and educational equity in California public
schools.
"The racial disparities in the criminal jus
tice system are due to racial bias in the crim
inal justice system." she said.
Harris has also worked to abolish Cali
fornia's "three strikes" law and has cam
paigned against California Prop. 54. which
would allow California public agencies to
obtain information on race, ethnicity and
national origin.
Harris explained the difference between
front-end and back-end spending, a major
component of her work at the ACLU.
Front-end spending, she said, refers to the
funds the state pours into public education,
whereas back-end spending refers to the
money the state puts into incarceration. For
African-Americans, state spending tends to
overwhelmingly favor the back end. Harris
said, a trend that she hopes to reverse.
She also described her experience tour

ing California public schools, witnessing ap
palling conditions, including rats in class
rooms. broken toilets and a dearth of text
books.
"Schools in California are still largely
separate and unequal." Harris said, noting
that 50 years have passed since the decision
of Brown v. Board of Education.
The ACLU is often attacked from both
sides of the political spectrum, Harris said.
On one hand, there are those who oppose
the idea that some people deserve preferen
tial treatment because of their disadvan

taged background. On the other, others can
not understand how the ACLU can take
part in litigation to defend the Ku Klux
Klan's right to free speech.
"There is a challenge to balance the re
active work with the proactive work that
we do," Harris said, adding that despite
the more mundane tasks of reading and
responding to e-mail, she loves her cur
rent work. "I am daily connected to peo
ple whose lives I am actively working to
improve. That's what I find the most satis
fying."

Lending a few words of advice to the stu
dents in attendance, Harris suggested that
they attend the best law school possible,
where they can also be happy.
Senior Kristen A. Jones, president of the
Black Pie-Law Society, said, "The purpose
of the speaker series is to bring lawyers from
all fields of law to campus to give students
not only an opportunity to network with pre
mier lawyers in their field, but to gain a sense
of clarity and understanding of the vast num
ber of ways and fields in which a person can
practice law."
