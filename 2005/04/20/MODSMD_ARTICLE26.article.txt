# Hurlbut pitches an ethical solution to stem-cell debate
## 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ STAFF WRITER 
Human Biology Prof. William Hurlbut says
he may have found a way to crack the moral
and ethical dilemmas of stem-cell research
with a controversial technique known as Al
tered Nuclear Transfer, or ANT.
This method, which allows for the obtaining
of stem cells without destroying normal human
embryos, is drawing criticism from other re
searchers, wht) argue that the method will not
solve the moral issues at hand.
In an address to the President's Council on
Bioethics in December, Hurlbut outlined ANT
in three steps. First, scientists extract a cell nucle
us from a cell; then they silence a specific gene,
called the CDX 2 gene, by not allowing its expres
sion, in the removed nucleus; and finally they in
sert the genetically-altered nucleus into a devel
oping egg cell. This process results in a fusion
process that eventually produces hundreds of
stem cells, which can then be used for research.
According to Hurlbut. ANT sidesteps the
moral issue of destroying human embryos to
obtain stem cells because the process only in
volves destroying mutant embryos that cannot
develop into human embryos because their
genes have been altered.
The method has been tested on mice, with
promising results. However. George Daley, a
member of the executive committee for the
Harvard Stem Cell Institute, called the propos
al "flawed" and is doubtful that ANT will work
in humans the lamt way as it has on mice.
"It is not known jvhether human CDX2-de
ficient the same stage as mice
and whether they could be used to derive em
bryonic stem c<*ns," Daley said.
In an article entitled "Altered Nuclear
Transfer in Stem-Cell Research — A
Flawed Proposal," Daley and his colleagues
Douglas Melton and Charles Jennings of
the Harvard Stem Cell Institute highlighted
what they sec as inherent contradictions in
ANT's research methodology. For instance,
embryos must be destroyed in order to re
search the ANT process itself, which is ex
actly what Hurlbut wants to prevent.
Additionally, the Harvard scientists argue
that Hurlbut's ethical basis for advocating
ANT presents a double standard because it
permits the destruction of altered embryos,
which might have developed normally if the

CDX 2 gene hadn't been silenced.
These scientists say that conducting re
search to validate this method would he too
costly and reap little reward, according to the
article. Instead, they advocate the current
method of obtaining stem cells because they
believe it has the potential to develop new
treatments and save lives, which they say out
weighs the ethical issues surrounding stem-cell
research, Daley said.

tentially solve a major ethical dilemma for
many people who see the benefits of stem-cell
research but who take a pro-life stance on the
issue.
"ANT is not a distraction or a diversion of
resources, but a morally reasonable proposal
that can benefit those on both sides of the de
bate," Hurlbut said. "It should not be seen as
too complex and time-consuming if it sustains
social consensus."
Hurlbut added that several scientists are in
terested in conducting research on ANT with
human cells. If proven successful, this method
has important implications for improved treat
ments of diseases, better medical therapy and
high-accuracy drug testing.
Barbara Koenig, Prof, of Neurology, said
she recognizes the importance of such research
and deliberation on the topic, but she is less op
timistic that both sides of this debate can arrive
at a common solution.
"Because the boundary between life and
death is socially mediated and understood, sci
entific facts like this will inevitably be inter
preted in context," Kt>enig said. "There is no
neutral reading of nature."
