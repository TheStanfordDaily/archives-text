Typically dominated by Harry Potter,
"The Da Vinci ( ode" and the latest John Gr
isham thriller. Amazon.com's latest bestseller
list ranks a book on economics as third in
sales.
Using traditional economic models to an
swer everyday questions, rem >wned ea momist
Steven Levitt, a fellow at the Stanford Center
for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sci
ences. or CASBS, has found the right recipe for
his hugely popular book entitled "Freakonom
ics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden
Side of Everything," which he co-authored
with journalist Steven Dubner.
The book examines unconventional top
ics. including the financial success of crack
dealers, the danger of owning a swimming
pool and the scrupulousness of public school
teachers. The authors claim that the key to
understanding these and many other issues is
to determine the behavioral incentives that

govern people's actions.
Much of "Freakonomics" is concerned
with human behavior, and, according to
Levitt, his time at Stanford's CASBS added
significantly to his research and the content of
the book.
"While I was at Stanford I worked on a
whole range of things, many of which show up
in 'Freakonomics'," he said. "For instance,
the impact of having a distinctively Black
name, how realtors cheat their clients and the
destruction caused by crack cocaine."
One of Levitt's more controversial and fa
mous studies was also completed at Stanford
with Law Schixil Prof. John Donohue. In
2(XM). the pair released "The Impact of Legal
ized Abortion on Crime." The study argued
that the legalization of abortion after Roe vs.
Wade is partly responsible fora large drop in
the U.S. crime rate because unwanted chil
dren are more likely to get involved with
crime.
Levitt came to Stanford on a sabbatical
from his professorship at the University of

Chicago. Levitt said that what he most en
joyed about the Farm was the flexibility and
independence he was given while working at
CASBS.
"In my daily life at the University of Chica
go. I have a million demands on my time," he
said. "At C ASBS. my time was my own. with
out interruptions, committees or obligations.
When I first got to Stanford. I could only work
for 15 minutes without a break because I was
so used lo being interrupted. By the end. I
could work for four hours without interrup
tion. Sadly. I'm back to a 15-minute attention
span now."
Levitt's research at Stanford and else
where has proven to have wide appeal.
Levitt said he was shocked at the book's
success.
"Total disbelief." he said. "We are at least
as puzzled as everyone else. We thought we
wrote a good book—just like every parent
thinks they have the most beautiful baby —
but we never dreamed it would be selling like
this."
