First-year Stanford Law School student
Steven Jones has been released from the in
tensive care unit after collapsing for un
known reasons on April 9 while jogging
around campus.
Although additional information
about his condition and prognosis is not
available due to privacy concerns, what is
public knowledge is the outpouring of
support from the law school community.
His classmates made daily visits to the
hospital and sent the Jones family meals
and best wishes.
"I am really proud of the way the students
have rallied around Steve and his family,"
said Cathy Glaze, the law school's associate
dean of student affairs. "The family seems to
be quite touched by the outpouring of love,
not to mention food. When Steve is ready to

see more people, I am sure that they would
love students to visit him."
Larry Kramer, dean of the law school,
said he was impressed by the student, faculty
and staff responses to Jones' medical emer
gency.
"Everyone in the law school community
was saddened and concerned about what
happened to Steve," Kramer said. " The re
sponse was tremendous â€” students, faculty
and staff came forward with offers to help
Steve and his family in whatever way possi
ble. So many people have visited him that the
hospital staff asked us to stop so he could
have more space to recover. As someone rel
atively new to the Stanford community, it
was an affirming reaction to a terrible
tragedy."
The Law School and the University have
offered to help the Jones family in any way
possible. Jones' mother and stepfather are
staying in the law school's condominium at
Pearce Mitchell, and his father is staying at
the guest house for the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, Glaze said.
"For all of us. we will have to see what
comes next as Steve begins the recovery
process," Kramer said. "But we and the stu
dents remain willing and anxious to help in
whatever way she needs."
