### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITKR 
The Stanford Medical School is testing
the effectiveness and safety of the drug Du
loxetine, intended for patients suffering
from dysthymia, a chronic and low-grade
form of depression.
"Dysthymia is a less severe form of de
pression which affects approximately 3 to
6 percent of the population." said Lorrin
Koran, professor of psychiatry and behav
ioral sciences and the study's protocol di
rector. "Some of the symptoms of this dis
ease include sad moods, difficulty enjoy
ing life, low self-esteem, pessimism, strong
feelings of guilt and difficulty concentrat
ing."
The researchers will administer Duloxe
tine — which has already been approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
treatment of major depression — to 24 vol
unteers suffering from dysthymia.
"We will administer the drug fora period
of 12 weeks to see how it affects the dis
ease." Koran said. "Because very little is
known about the treatment of dysthymia.

we recommend that volunteers stay on the
drug for six months to a year after they begin
to feel better, and then begin gradually re
ducing their doses."
According to Koran, though there will
be no monetary compensation for volun
teers, they will benefit from access to careful
evaluation and care.
The disease has been misunderstood for
years, Koran said.
"Many people with dysthymia think it is
simply a part of their personality." he
added. "It is not. It is a biological problem
that responds to medications and cognitive
psychotherapy." •
Nona Gamel, clinical research coordina
tor for the Stanford Medical Center, said
that it is easy to determine whether volun
teers are suffering from dysthymia or are
simply in a bad mood.
"People have to be feeling down or de
pressed for most of the time for at least two
years — so that would be a long time to sim
ply be in a bad mood," she said. "Ideally
people who are not suffering from this dis
ease would be able to remember a time
when they felt better, or there are days when

they feel better. So it is possible to tell the
difference between a person suffering from
dysthymia and someone who is always a lit
tle subdued or lacks self-confidence."
Dysthymia, according to Koran, usually
begins during the teenage years and more
rarely in the early twenties. If left untreated,
it can remain with the individual for his or
her entire life and will "markedly diminish
enjoyment of life."
linlike other similar tests, the study will
not administer a placebo to a control group
of patients, Gamel said.
"It is a preliminary study to see if the
drug can be helpful for dysthymia." she said.
"If we have positive results, a placebo-con
trolled study would be the logical next step."
Koran said that the most important thing
is for people who are suffering from dys
thymia to know that it's not just a part of
their personality and that the disease is
treatable.
"I've treated patients in their 50s and 60s
who didn't even know they had dysthymia,"
he said. "After going through the treatment,
they told me they had no idea that life could
be this good."
