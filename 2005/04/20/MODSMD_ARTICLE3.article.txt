A full-size trawl net decorated White Plaza and
students feasted on free sustainably caught Dunge
ness crab Monday afternoon during the kick-off
event for Earth Week 2005. More than 400 students
who attended or passed by the event signed cards en
couraging legislators to limit the fishing practice
called bottom-trawling in vulnerable ecosystems.
Students fora Sustainable Stanford, one of the
main groups organizing the week's festivities, has
placed "Global Witness" displays around White
Plaza, highlighting specific stories about the impacts
of environmental damage on communities around
the world.
"We wanted to make sure people realize that
Earth Week is about the interaction between people
and the environment in addition to recycling and
conserving our natural resources," said sophomore
Erin Gaines, a coordinator for Students fora Sus
tainable Stanford.
Sophomore Becca Miller, also of Students fora
Sustainable Stanford, agreed with Gaines.
"So many people see themselves as humanists be
fore environmentalists, but we really wanted to show
that they are intrinsically integrated," she said.
On Friday, Stanford in Government will host a
panel entitled "President Bush's Environmental
Policies," featuring Larry Goulder, professor of envi
ronmental and resource economics, Thomas Moore,
senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and David
Victor, director of the program on energy and sus
tainable development. The panel will be followed by
a celebration in White Plaza.
Dorm environmental representatives have also
been encouraged to send out information on Earth
Day and tips on energy and water conservation to
their residents.
While the Monday event focused on over-fishing,
Gaines said it is important for students to be aware of
other major environmental issues, including climate
change, the loss of biodiversity and habitat conver
sion.
"Many of these global issues lead to serious prob
lems for humans, including, but not limited to, loss of
topsoil necessary for agriculture, land loss due to sea
level rise and the spread of diseases," Gaines said.
Miller said that sometimes people need to realize
that others' access to clean water and air around the
world depends on major environmental issues.
"We talk a lot about the kind of esoteric destruc
tion caused by global warming, but people don't
think about the people in South
America and Central America
who will be suffering higher rates
of malaria because of the seasonal
weather pattern changes caused by
global warming," Miller said.
She added that she hopes Earth
Week will not only acquaint stu
dents with environmental prob
lems on a national and global scale,
but also on the local level.
"One of our main campaigns
right now is focused on creating a
sustainability coordinator position
on campus, similar to positions at
numerous universities in the coun

try," Gaines said in an e-mail. "The
person would coordinate the ef
forts of students, faculty and staff
to most efficiently and economi
cally address environmental issues
and sustainable development on
campus."
Miller said that she thinks stu
dents will become interested in the
message of Earth Week if they see
their friends and peers participat
ing in the activities, adding that she
hopes the energy generated by
some of the events will be conta
gious.
"I just want everyone at Stan
ford to realize that the people who
control the environment are not
the environmentalists," Miller
said. " They are the politicians, the
businesspeople, the everyday citi
zens."
