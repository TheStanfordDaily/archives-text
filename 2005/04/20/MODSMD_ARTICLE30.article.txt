Getting a job out of college, I've been told, is
difficult. Unless you're an engineering major
and are slowly building your life arc toward a
dramatic re-creation of the Michael Douglas melt
down in "Falling Down," chances are good that you
will spend the next two months wondering if your de
tailed knowledge of (insert meaningless liberal arts
major here) will translate into a salary.
Let me provide the majority of you with a sneak
preview: You will spend your twenties in a Sisyphan

quest for meaning, and the final
result of your labors will be less fi
nancially rewarding than being a
gigolo at the Lilith Fair.
This column is not for those of
you who will be attending medi
cal school (thanks for providing
that tricky "social conscience"
thing 1 never found), business
school (make sure you like Briani
power ties) or law school (some
day you will realize the error of

your ways). Virtually everyone I talk to has a plan of
some kind, as if they were reading up for the MCATs
at age seven.
Meanwhile, my personal career aspirations have
been pretty one-dimensional. At age 10.1 wanted to
be the centerfielder for the San Francisco Giants; at
age 13, the centerfielder for the Modesto A's; at age
16, the centerfielder fora Division 1 program. This
dream flamed out pretty quickly in high school, as 1
gradually realized that when scouts/coaches/my
mother shouted "Hey, we got a future Beltran out
there!" they were being sarcastic.
By 181 had realized that the only thing 1 was ca
pable of achieving that would make me genuinely
happy was to make enough money to buy a George
Foreman grill, a bag of boneless chicken breasts and
a plasma TV with all four ESPNs. And now. at 21,
armed with a Stanford education, I want... exactly
the same thing.
As far as preparing myself for my undoubtedly il
lustrious future, too, I have come up a little short. 1
managed to graduate from college in three years,
something that never fails to impress people until 1
reveal that I was a political science major, at which
point their facial expressions mimic the response of a
distracted mother to her three-year-old's finger
painting.
1 also expend significantly more effort organizing
intramural Softball practices than 1 do examining na
tion-building policies in sub-Saharan Africa. The
concept of a five-day work week is entirely foreign to
me, having never attended a class meeting on Friday.
If I ever mistakenly think about the harsh reality of
gainful employment. 1 am reduced to cowering for
days in the comer of my room, where I subsist en
tirely on David sunflower seeds. Belgian beer and
Big League Chew.
So what are my career goals? I want to throw a
ball back from the bleacher seats at Wrigley. I want
to own a Santurce Cangrejeros jersey. I want to eat
ballpark food in Japan. I want to go to work wearing
a shirt that says "Douchebags" in the L. A. Dodgers'
script font. These are. unfortunately, not things that
usually pay well.
A small percentage of us are bom without a pas-


Dan NkCarthy
sion for any particular kind of work.
What do you do with your life if you don't
like anything except sports and video
games, and you aren't good enough at ei
ther of them to make a living? The obvi
ous answer is that you suck it up and
spend the next 40 years of your life be
hind a desk, filling your off time with en
thralling conversations about Merlot and
rustproofing your deck. (Actually, that's
pretty ambitious; what sounds more real
istic is rustproofing the aluminum walls of
the abandoned Quonset hut I'll be living
in on the local Air Force base.)
I know there are more of you out
there like me. I know some of you read
ESPN .aim and think to yourself that Bill
Simmons probably pulls down six fig
ures, and that you could write at least as
well if you sat down and watched every
movie that came out between 1983 and
1991, with the added bonus of not leaking
emotion like an overtaxed Hefty bag at
the mere mention of the Red Sox or
Brandon Walsh.
At worst, one or two of you share my
unique traits: the ability to recite the
batting orders of every team in the orig
inal RBI Baseball and an appreciation
for the Baby Bull Sandwich at SBC
Park. We represent the new lazy man's
sports proletariat: unclean, unskilled,
abhorrent to those who do any of the
actual work.
We are needed. We long to feel im
portant. And someday, when the fate of
the human race is dependent on me de
feating someone in a game of RBI or
Wiffle ball, you will be thankful for keep
ing my skills in peak form.
So someone, please, hire me. My title
could be something understated, yet
classy, like "Amateur Outdoor Recre
ation Consultant" or "Junior Sports En
tertainment Critic." I can promise you
my best work, if only because I am moti
vated by the abject horror of putting on a
tie every morning. It would be nothing
short of a national tragedy to let an indi
vidual of my indispensable talents go to
waste.
And I am all about applying myself.

So someone, please, hire me. My title
could be something understated, yet
classy, like "Amateur Outdoor Recre
ation Consultant" or "Junior Sports En
tertainment Critic." I can promise you
my best work, if only because I am moti
vated by the abject horror of putting on a
tie every morning. It would be nothing
short of a national tragedy to let an indi
vidual of my indispensable talents go to
waste.
And I am all about applying myself.

Getting a job out of college, I've been told, is
difficult. Unless you're an engineering major
and are slowly building your life arc toward a
dramatic re-creation of the Michael Douglas melt
down in "Falling Down," chances are good that you
will spend the next two months wondering if your de
tailed knowledge of (insert meaningless liberal arts
major here) will translate into a salary.
Let me provide the majority of you with a sneak
preview: You will spend your twenties in a Sisyphan

quest for meaning, and the final
result of your labors will be less fi
nancially rewarding than being a
gigolo at the Lilith Fair.
This column is not for those of
you who will be attending medi
cal school (thanks for providing
that tricky "social conscience"
thing 1 never found), business
school (make sure you like Briani
power ties) or law school (some
day you will realize the error of

your ways). Virtually everyone I talk to has a plan of
some kind, as if they were reading up for the MCATs
at age seven.
Meanwhile, my personal career aspirations have
been pretty one-dimensional. At age 10.1 wanted to
be the centerfielder for the San Francisco Giants; at
age 13, the centerfielder for the Modesto A's; at age
16, the centerfielder fora Division 1 program. This
dream flamed out pretty quickly in high school, as 1
gradually realized that when scouts/coaches/my
mother shouted "Hey, we got a future Beltran out
there!" they were being sarcastic.
By 181 had realized that the only thing 1 was ca
pable of achieving that would make me genuinely
happy was to make enough money to buy a George
Foreman grill, a bag of boneless chicken breasts and
a plasma TV with all four ESPNs. And now. at 21,
armed with a Stanford education, I want... exactly
the same thing.
As far as preparing myself for my undoubtedly il
lustrious future, too, I have come up a little short. 1
managed to graduate from college in three years,
something that never fails to impress people until 1
reveal that I was a political science major, at which
point their facial expressions mimic the response of a
distracted mother to her three-year-old's finger
painting.
1 also expend significantly more effort organizing
intramural Softball practices than 1 do examining na
tion-building policies in sub-Saharan Africa. The
concept of a five-day work week is entirely foreign to
me, having never attended a class meeting on Friday.
If I ever mistakenly think about the harsh reality of
gainful employment. 1 am reduced to cowering for
days in the comer of my room, where I subsist en
tirely on David sunflower seeds. Belgian beer and
Big League Chew.
So what are my career goals? I want to throw a
ball back from the bleacher seats at Wrigley. I want
to own a Santurce Cangrejeros jersey. I want to eat
ballpark food in Japan. I want to go to work wearing
a shirt that says "Douchebags" in the L. A. Dodgers'
script font. These are. unfortunately, not things that
usually pay well.
A small percentage of us are bom without a pas-

sion for any particular kind of work.
What do you do with your life if you don't
like anything except sports and video
games, and you aren't good enough at ei
ther of them to make a living? The obvi
ous answer is that you suck it up and
spend the next 40 years of your life be
hind a desk, filling your off time with en
thralling conversations about Merlot and
rustproofing your deck. (Actually, that's
pretty ambitious; what sounds more real
istic is rustproofing the aluminum walls of
the abandoned Quonset hut I'll be living
in on the local Air Force base.)
I know there are more of you out
there like me. I know some of you read
ESPN .aim and think to yourself that Bill
Simmons probably pulls down six fig
ures, and that you could write at least as
well if you sat down and watched every
movie that came out between 1983 and
1991, with the added bonus of not leaking
emotion like an overtaxed Hefty bag at
the mere mention of the Red Sox or
Brandon Walsh.
At worst, one or two of you share my
unique traits: the ability to recite the
batting orders of every team in the orig
inal RBI Baseball and an appreciation
for the Baby Bull Sandwich at SBC
Park. We represent the new lazy man's
sports proletariat: unclean, unskilled,
abhorrent to those who do any of the
actual work.
We are needed. We long to feel im
portant. And someday, when the fate of
the human race is dependent on me de
feating someone in a game of RBI or
Wiffle ball, you will be thankful for keep
ing my skills in peak form.
So someone, please, hire me. My title
could be something understated, yet
classy, like "Amateur Outdoor Recre
ation Consultant" or "Junior Sports En
tertainment Critic." I can promise you
my best work, if only because I am moti
vated by the abject horror of putting on a
tie every morning. It would be nothing
short of a national tragedy to let an indi
vidual of my indispensable talents go to
waste.
