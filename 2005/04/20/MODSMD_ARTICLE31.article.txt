# Card romp, 8-2
## Taylor hits for the cycle, Domaracki hits first career home run 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Freshman Michael Taylor stepped
to the plate with one out in the bottom
of the eighth inning last night at
Sunken Diamond knowing that he
needed only a single to complete a
cycle.
Taylor, the most physically impos
ing player on the team at 6-foot-6 and
235 pounds, had found his home run
power in the second inning, connect
ing for his first of the year. He followed
that up with a triple to the gap in left
center in the fourth inning, and hit a
double to left in the fifth.
All Taylor needed now, as junior
John Mayberry, Jr. led off third base,
was a single.
"It definitely crossed my mind, but
1 wasn't thinking hit a single,'" Taylor
said after the game. "I wanted to get
the run in no matter what happened â€”
that was my first concern. After that, I
was just trying to put a good swing on
it."
His seeing-eye liner shot past the
glove of diving San Jose State first
baseman Brandon Fromm into right
field, completing the first cycle by a
Stanford player since Edmund Muth
accomplished the feat against UCLA
in 1998. Taylor's three RBI alone
would have been enough for the Car
dinal (21-14) to dispatch the Spartans
(20-15-1), 8-2.
But Taylor's power surge proved to
be contagious, and he got some help
from the rest of the offense. The Car
dinal hit a season-high four home runs,
including a two-run shot to right by
freshman Brendan Domaracki in the
fourth inning, the first home run of his
career. Taylor, who had led off the in
ning with a triple, scored from third.
Stanford scored six of its eight runs
on the long ball. Mayberry hit a two
run blast over the left field scoreboard

in the third inning, his fifth of the year,
and junior Jed Lowrie added to the
home run parade in the fifth with a
drive off the batter's eye in dead center
field, his team-leading 11th.
Taylor's big night accounted for the
two other runs. His fifth-inning double
scored Hester from first, and his single
in the eighth scored Mayberry.
While the offense went to work, the
Cardinal pitching staff held San Jose
State to two runs on eight hits. Fresh
man Erik Davis (2-0) allowed one run
in four innings while striking out three
in his third consecutive Tuesday start.
Though he didn't pitch five innings, he
earned the win because of a pre-game
arrangement.
Sophomore Greg Reynolds had an
encouraging performance, bouncing
back after allowing five runs in 2/3 of
an inning against Arizona State on
Sunday. Reynolds held the Spartans to
one run in three innings of work. The
6-foot-7 righthander looked comfort
able on the mound and had good com
mand of the strike zone, issuing no
walks. y'H
Reynolds got himself out of trouble
in the sixth. San Jose State led off the
inning with three consecutive hits,
capped by Fromm's RBI single. But
Reynolds settled down and induced
two grounders to third baseman
Adam Sorgi, the second of which re
sulted in a double play.
Freshman Nolan Gallagher, fast
becoming one of the team's most reli
able relievers, closed out the game
with three strikeouts over two score
less innings.
San Jose State, meanwhile, used
the opportunity of playing a non-con
ference game to throw six pitchers.
Each of Taylor's four hits came off a
different pitcher, but last night, it
didn't seem to matter who was throw
ing to him.
It also didn't matter that players
were talking about the cycle in the
dugout after Taylor's fifth-inning dou
ble, defying a long-held baseball su
perstition.

ter brought it up in the dugout after the

Freshman Michael Taylor became the first Stanford player to hit for the cycle since Edmund Muth in 1998,
going 4-for-4 with three RBI in Stanford's 8-2 win over San Jose State last night.
third at-bat," Taylor said. "Guys were
saying that would jinx it, hut 1 was like,
I don't believe in jinxes, guys."
Head coach Mark Marquess said
that he was aware that Taylor had a
chance for the cycle after he hit the
triple in the fourth inning.
"A cycle is so rare, you usually
don't think about it," Marquess said.
"But when the ball bounced off the
post of the fence [in left) and he got the
triple. I started thinking about it, be
cause that's the hardest one to get. It's
funny. I normally wouldn't think
about it, but after he got the double I
thought, if he just gets a single ... and
then it left my mind."
Sophomore centerfielder Jim
Rapoport, the team's leading hitter,
missed the game due to food poison
ing, which he has been battling all
week. He is expected to be back in the
lineup when Stanford takes on Wash
ington this weekend. Senior Cameron
Matthews made his first career start in
Rapoport's place.
