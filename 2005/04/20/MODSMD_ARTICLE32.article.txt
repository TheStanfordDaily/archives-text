# Tennis shuts out Broncos after tough loss to Cal
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
It has been a season of heartbreakers
for the No. 21 Stanford men's tennis team.
After six 4-3 losses earlier this season, the
Cardinal suffered a narrow 5-2 loss to
arch-rival No. 22 California on Saturday
before bouncing back with a 7-0 shutout of
Santa Clara yesterday. Stanford (13-10. 4-
3 Pacific-10 Conference) lost the doubles
point against the Bears and only managed
to earn two wins in singles, losing three of

four split-set matches.
Stanford's top doubles pair, the No. 4
duo of senior Sam Warburg and junior KC
Corkery, defeated Cal's No. 21 Conor Ni
land and Patrick Briaud, 8-6, but the Car
dinal's third doubles pair of sophomores
Eric McKean and James Wan fell 6-8.
"I think that the Cal team played us
pretty smart, but I don't think we made
any fundamental mistakes," Wan said.
"We could have made our first volleys and
our serves a little better."
On the middle court, Cal's second dou

bles pair broke senior Phil Sheng and ju
nior Jon Wong to go up 6-4 and did not
allow the Cardinal duo another game fol
lowing that break. With the 8-4 victory,
Cal claimed two of the three doubles
matches and consequently the doubles
point.
"Doubles is a matter of making first
serves, first volleys and returns of serve,"
head coach John Whitlinger said. "I think,
at times, we get into a little trouble in
those three things. We're going to contin
ue to work on it and try to get better at

those aspects, but just didn't quite do it
[Saturday]."
Following doubles, a short ceremony
was held to honor Sheng and Warburg as
seniors before singles play commenced.
Freshman Phil Kao played at the final sin
gles spot and was the Ju"st to finish his
match. His 2-6,2-6 loss gjaye Cal its second
point of the day. .$* â– *
