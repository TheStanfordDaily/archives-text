# Tennis shuts out Broncos after tough loss to Cal
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
It has been a season of heartbreakers
for the No. 21 Stanford men's tennis team.
After six 4-3 losses earlier this season, the
Cardinal suffered a narrow 5-2 loss to
arch-rival No. 22 California on Saturday
before bouncing back with a 7-0 shutout of
Santa Clara yesterday. Stanford (13-10. 4-
3 Pacific-10 Conference) lost the doubles
point against the Bears and only managed
to earn two wins in singles, losing three of

four split-set matches.
Stanford's top doubles pair, the No. 4
duo of senior Sam Warburg and junior KC
Corkery, defeated Cal's No. 21 Conor Ni
land and Patrick Briaud, 8-6, but the Car
dinal's third doubles pair of sophomores
Eric McKean and James Wan fell 6-8.
"I think that the Cal team played us
pretty smart, but I don't think we made
any fundamental mistakes," Wan said.
"We could have made our first volleys and
our serves a little better."
On the middle court, Cal's second dou

bles pair broke senior Phil Sheng and ju
nior Jon Wong to go up 6-4 and did not
allow the Cardinal duo another game fol
lowing that break. With the 8-4 victory,
Cal claimed two of the three doubles
matches and consequently the doubles
point.
"Doubles is a matter of making first
serves, first volleys and returns of serve,"
head coach John Whitlinger said. "I think,
at times, we get into a little trouble in
those three things. We're going to contin
ue to work on it and try to get better at

those aspects, but just didn't quite do it
[Saturday]."
Following doubles, a short ceremony
was held to honor Sheng and Warburg as
seniors before singles play commenced.
Freshman Phil Kao played at the final sin
gles spot and was the Ju"st to finish his
match. His 2-6,2-6 loss gjaye Cal its second
point of the day. .$* ■*
No. 13 Corkery pickeg up the first Car
dinal win at the secorfd jingles spot. The
All-American led 6-5 in the first
set, and following a number of
deuces. Corkery closed out the first
set 7-5. The junior then closed out
the second set and the match with a
forehand volley winner. The re
maining four matches all went to
three sets.
After splitting sets, Wan led 3-1
in the final set at the third singles
position. However, the sophomore
could not hold on to his lead and ul
timately lost 6-4, 0-6, 6-4. Trailing
3-1, Stanford would have to win the
remaining three matches to notch a
win.
No. 2 Warburg started his first
set strong with a 6-4 win against No.
16 Niland, who rebounded to win
the second set, 6-4. Warburg
snagged an early break at the be
ginning of the third and deciding
set en route to a 6-2 win.
While McKean and Sheng won
their first sets only seconds apart,
they could not seal the deal in their
second sets. In the third set, McK
ean trailed 3-5 but managed to
stretch his opponent to a tiebreak
er at 6-6. McKean fought back from
6-3 down to extend the tiebreaker
to 9-9, but ultimately lost 9-11.
Sheng began to cramp in the final
set and eventually lost 4-6, 7 6, 6-0,
completing Cal's 5-2 win.
"In a lot of our matches, we're in
a position to possibly close out the
team" Whitlinger said. "But I have
to give Cal credit — they did a
great job of hanging in there. They
fought very hard, and they de
served to win."
Prior to yesterday's match

against Santa Clara, Wan com
mented: "I'm pretty excited about
our new doubles lineup; hopefully
it will work out."
Stanford's new doubles pairs
did work out against the Broncos,
as the Cardinal posted three dou
bles victories en route to a 7-0
shutout at home. Corkery and
Wan defeated their opponents at
the second doubles position 8-2,
and Sheng and Wong followed
suit with an 8-4 victory at the third
doubles spot. Finally, with a lob,
Warburg and McKean finished
their 8-5 victory at the top spot
and completed the Cardinal's
doubles sweep.
Whitlinger also made slight
changes to the singles lineup for
Tuesday's match. McKean shifted
to the sixth singles position and
earned a quick 6-0, 6-1 victory.
McKean's most recent doubles
partner, Warburg, was the next
match to come off the court. With a
backhand passing shot. Warburg
closed out the final home match of
his Stanford career in fine fashion.
Of the four remaining matches,
Corkery, Kao and Wan were all in
the final games of their matches. As
a ball sailed long. Corkery picked
up a win at the second singles posi
tion. Moments later, Kao and Wan
tallied Cardinal victories at the
fifth and fourth positions, respec
tively. Finally, Sheng closed out his
match at the third position. 7-6,6-3.
"Especially in the close matches,
it's been tough not winning the
doubles point — not that we
haven't had chances to come back
in singles," Whitlinger said. "We
can't quite find what we need yet in
doubles, but we're continuing to
look at all combinations to see what
we can do to improve so we can get
a better end result."
