# 'Just a little freshman'
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
She is a 2004 Olympian, five-time Pacific-10
Conference champion, two-time NCAA
champ, six-time All-American. and was re
cently named Pac-10 Swimmer and Newcomer
of the Year. But if you ask Caroline Bruce,
she'll tell you that she is "just a little freshman
like everybody else."
Bruce, who swept the 100-yard and 200-
yard breaststroke events at the NCAA Cham
pionships in March, last week became the ninth
Swimmer of the Year from Stanford and the
first to take home Swimmer and Newcomer of
the Year honors in a single year.
"I never really thought about the champi
onships when I came in," Bruce said. "I always
thought that it would be awesome to be na
tional champion, but it wasn't really something
I was set on. As the meet came closer and my
coach started to tell me that I could do it.it
started to seem more realistic. But it was not
something that I was thinking about coming in.
It's really hard to believe. But I have been very
blessed to have such an amazing coach and
amazing team."
Although she is indisputably one of the best
swimmers in the nation, Bruce insists that
swimming does not dominate her life or her
self-image.
"On Saturday, I went to the beach," she said.
"I like just going places and traveling around
here because it's so beautiful. I like hanging out
with friends, going to parties, just normal col
lege stuff. 1 don't really think about swimming
except when I'm at the pool. It's not like I think
about being an Olympian every day."
With her powerful frame and massive
shoulders, Bruce looks every inch the elite ath
lete. but she sees herself as just a student who
has been given the opportunity to experience
what most people can only dream of.
"She seems to have a smile on her face 99
percent of the time," said head coach Richard
Quick, who announced his retirement after 17
years as Stanford's head coach yesterday. "She
always has a positive response to any situation.
It's not that she doesn't get discouraged or dis
appointed sometimes, but she quickly recovers

and becomes even more determined. She is just
a very positive individual, and that really radi
ates to the rest of the team."
Bruce said she steps on the blocks before
every race with the same attitude.
"My teammates always comment that 1
don't seem to get nervous before a race and it's
true," Bruce said. "No matter what the race is,
I go out there and have fun and give it my best
shot. Whether it's the Olympics or just a dual
meet, I have the same approach. I like having
fun and just enjoying the moment. Some peo
ple get too involved in the details, but I just
don't really think about it."
She is enthusiastic about the opportunities
for travel that competitive swimming offers
and the people she has been able to meet —
from her club teammates in Wichita, Kans., to
Olympic veterans — but is just as eager to talk
about her plans fora Communication major
and her aspirations to one day work for ESPN.
Caroline started swimming at age seven,
following the lead of her older siblings.
"Our aunt got us into it," she recalled. "She
used to teach lessons in her backyard pool, so
we started there and ended up joining club
swimming. I was still doing other sports
through my sophomore year of high school
when I dislocated my knee, but I have been re
ally focused on swimming since I was about 12
and realized it was something I loved."
Her older brother and sister are also top col
legiate swimmers, both of whom have competed
in the Olympic Trials. Michael graduated from
Stanford in 2(X)4 and held the Pac-10 record in
the 200-yard breaststroke for two years. Lizzy is
a junior at North Carolina and All-American in
the breaststroke. It was hearing Michael rave
about his experiences at Stanford that made Car
oline want to don a Cardinal suit, and her arrival
has been a blessing for the team.
When she came to Stanford in the fall, she
was put in the difficult position of filling the va
cancy left by one of the world's great breast
strokers, 2004 grad Tara Kirk, a world record
holder and Olympic medalist. Bruce befriend
