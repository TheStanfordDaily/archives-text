# Women earn weekend split
## 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Losses don't come very frequently for the No. 3
women's water polo team (16-5, 7-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation). And when they do, they tend to come
in agonizingly close and fiercely contested fashion. Enter
ing this weekend's competition, the Cardinal had dropped
only four games all season. In two of tljose games the win
ning tally came in the final period of play, and in all but one
the final margin of victory was a single goal.
Friday, the Cardinal added to their list of hard-to-swal
low losses. Taking on top-ranked UCLA, the Stanford
women hoped to knock off a Bruins squad that featured a
number of Olympic and Junior National team members.
Despite falling behind early, the Cardinal rallied before ul
timately falling, 7-5.
The women bounced back Sunday to hand No. 14 UC-
Davis a 12-5 defeat in commanding fashion.
A predominantly pro-Cardinal crowd filled the Avery
Aquatic Center stands and lined the fence Friday, taking
the intensity of an already hyped matchup to a new level.
The Cardinal were unable to feed off the crowd's ener
gy in the early stages of the game. The Bruins stmck first
at 6:20, working a shot off of a cross-pass that tipped the
fingers of sophomore goalie Meridith McColl and drifted
across the goal line. A minute later, the Bruins capitalized
on another six-on-five advantage to lead.
With just over two minutes remaSiAin the period,
UCLA junior Thalia Munro took freshman
Gabrielle Dominic and netted the Bflnftird goal of the
evening. That play concluded the firwßßd scoring, and
despite playing physical and the Car
dinal faced an early 3-0 deficit.
"UCLA played extremely well to begin with and shot
the ball really well," head coach John Tanner said. "They
didn't significantly outplay us in the first quarter, but they
really were efficient with their chances and had two really
nice shots to start."
The Bruins took advantage of several Cardinal defen
sive lapses early in the second period and built their lead
to 5-0. The fifth goal was recorded by standout sophomore
driver Kelly Rulon on a three-on-two breakaway.
Despite being down five goals to the best team in the
nation, the Cardinal slowly began to turn things around at
both ends of the pool. Junior two-meter Nancy El-
Sakkary put the Cardinal on the board on a goal assisted
by junior driver Scotti Shafer, but it
was strong efforts in the defensive
zone that set up the play. Senior Kelty
Luber intercepted a UCLA pass,
which McC'oll then sent down the
pool to Shafer on a breakaway.
Shafer decided to work an ejection
rather than continue the break, and
the move paid off when El-Sakkary
converted the Cardinals man-up ad
vantage.
Seconds later, UCLA head coach
Adam Krikorian was red-carded for
disputing a call and was forced to
leave the pool deck. The ejection got
the crowd back into the game. UCLA
tallied its sixth score shortly after play
resumed, but sophomore two-meter
Christina Hewko brought the Cardi
nal back to within four with a goal
with only 48 seconds remaining in the
half.
The Cardinal broke from their
halftime locker room meeting with a
spirited cheer that could be heard in
every corner of the stands. Senior

Hannah Luher won the opening
sprint, and things started clicking on
both ends for the Cardinal. An
chored hy spectacular saves from
McColl in net and Hannah Luber in
the field, the Cardinal defense held
the high-powered UCLA offensive
scoreless for nearly 13 minutes as
Stanford clawed its way back into the
game.
"We're fighters, and we weren't
going to give up until the end," Mc-
Coll said. "Our team came together
and decided we needed to be nails on
everything. If you give a team like
UCLA an inch, they'll take it and
make something happen. We had to
take that (inchJ back and play Stan
ford water polo the way we know
how."
Hewko notched her second goal
of the game at 4:15 in the third period
after receiving a pass from sopho
more Katie Hansen.
Playing against the clock as well as
the Bruins in the final period, Stan
ford managed to generate several
scoring opportunities but was unable
to capitalize until Shafer sent a pic
ture-perfect lob shot into the upper
left corner of the cage from six meters
out.

The Bruins crushed Stanford's
hopes fora miraculous final two min
utes by netting yet another power
play goal, putting the game out of
reach. The Cardinal continued to
fight, and Hewko buried a right-to
left shot off the side bar to complete
her hat-trick ; with 38 seconds remain
ing in the game.
Although disappointed with the
result, Hewko said that a more con
sistent effort might have led to a dif
ferent outcome.
"I don't think we were ready for
[UCLA's physicality] at the begin
ning of the game," Hewko said.
"But obviously as the first quarter
went on we got in our groove and
started coming back. We need to be
up at that level from the beginning
of the game, and that will make the
difference."
As they continue to prepare for
end-season tournaments, the Cardi
nal said they are optimistic about
their ability to make the adjustments
necessary to see results.
"We're really excited about the
opportunity to play these teams
again," McColl said. "We've got a lot
of talent in the pool, and when we put
it all together, great things happen."

with only 48 seconds remaining in the
half.
The Cardinal broke from their
halftime locker room meeting with a
spirited cheer that could be heard in
every corner of the stands. Senior

Hannah Luher won the opening
sprint, and things started clicking on
both ends for the Cardinal. An
chored hy spectacular saves from
McColl in net and Hannah Luber in
the field, the Cardinal defense held
the high-powered UCLA offensive
scoreless for nearly 13 minutes as
Stanford clawed its way back into the
game.
"We're fighters, and we weren't
going to give up until the end," Mc-
Coll said. "Our team came together
and decided we needed to be nails on
everything. If you give a team like
UCLA an inch, they'll take it and
make something happen. We had to
take that (inchJ back and play Stan
ford water polo the way we know
how."
Hewko notched her second goal
of the game at 4:15 in the third period
after receiving a pass from sopho
more Katie Hansen.
Playing against the clock as well as
the Bruins in the final period, Stan
ford managed to generate several
scoring opportunities but was unable
to capitalize until Shafer sent a pic
ture-perfect lob shot into the upper
left corner of the cage from six meters
out.

The Bruins crushed Stanford's
hopes fora miraculous final two min
utes by netting yet another power
play goal, putting the game out of
reach. The Cardinal continued to
fight, and Hewko buried a right-to
left shot off the side bar to complete
her hat-trick ; with 38 seconds remain
ing in the game.
Although disappointed with the
result, Hewko said that a more con
sistent effort might have led to a dif
ferent outcome.
"I don't think we were ready for
[UCLA's physicality] at the begin
ning of the game," Hewko said.
"But obviously as the first quarter
went on we got in our groove and
started coming back. We need to be
up at that level from the beginning
of the game, and that will make the
difference."
As they continue to prepare for
end-season tournaments, the Cardi
nal said they are optimistic about
their ability to make the adjustments
necessary to see results.
"We're really excited about the
opportunity to play these teams
again," McColl said. "We've got a lot
of talent in the pool, and when we put
it all together, great things happen."

Sophomore Christina Hewko scored three goals in Stanford's 7-5 loss to
UCLA Friday and tallied three more in a 12-5 win over UC-Davis on Sunday.
Losses don't come very frequently for the No. 3
women's water polo team (16-5, 7-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation). And when they do, they tend to come
in agonizingly close and fiercely contested fashion. Enter
ing this weekend's competition, the Cardinal had dropped
only four games all season. In two of tljose games the win
ning tally came in the final period of play, and in all but one
the final margin of victory was a single goal.
Friday, the Cardinal added to their list of hard-to-swal
low losses. Taking on top-ranked UCLA, the Stanford
women hoped to knock off a Bruins squad that featured a
number of Olympic and Junior National team members.
Despite falling behind early, the Cardinal rallied before ul
timately falling, 7-5.
The women bounced back Sunday to hand No. 14 UC-
Davis a 12-5 defeat in commanding fashion.
A predominantly pro-Cardinal crowd filled the Avery
Aquatic Center stands and lined the fence Friday, taking
the intensity of an already hyped matchup to a new level.
The Cardinal were unable to feed off the crowd's ener
gy in the early stages of the game. The Bruins stmck first
at 6:20, working a shot off of a cross-pass that tipped the
fingers of sophomore goalie Meridith McColl and drifted
across the goal line. A minute later, the Bruins capitalized
on another six-on-five advantage to lead.
With just over two minutes remaSiAin the period,
UCLA junior Thalia Munro took freshman
Gabrielle Dominic and netted the Bflnftird goal of the
evening. That play concluded the firwßßd scoring, and
despite playing physical and the Car
dinal faced an early 3-0 deficit.
"UCLA played extremely well to begin with and shot
the ball really well," head coach John Tanner said. "They
didn't significantly outplay us in the first quarter, but they
really were efficient with their chances and had two really
nice shots to start."
The Bruins took advantage of several Cardinal defen
sive lapses early in the second period and built their lead
to 5-0. The fifth goal was recorded by standout sophomore
driver Kelly Rulon on a three-on-two breakaway.
Despite being down five goals to the best team in the
nation, the Cardinal slowly began to turn things around at
both ends of the pool. Junior two-meter Nancy El-
Sakkary put the Cardinal on the board on a goal assisted
by junior driver Scotti Shafer, but it
was strong efforts in the defensive
zone that set up the play. Senior Kelty
Luber intercepted a UCLA pass,
which McC'oll then sent down the
pool to Shafer on a breakaway.
Shafer decided to work an ejection
rather than continue the break, and
the move paid off when El-Sakkary
converted the Cardinals man-up ad
vantage.
Seconds later, UCLA head coach
Adam Krikorian was red-carded for
disputing a call and was forced to
leave the pool deck. The ejection got
the crowd back into the game. UCLA
tallied its sixth score shortly after play
resumed, but sophomore two-meter
Christina Hewko brought the Cardi
nal back to within four with a goal
with only 48 seconds remaining in the
half.
