# Women earn weekend split

### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Losses don't come very frequently for the No. 3
women's water polo team (16-5, 7-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation). And when they do, they tend to come
in agonizingly close and fiercely contested fashion. Enter
ing this weekend's competition, the Cardinal had dropped
only four games all season. In two of tljose games the win
ning tally came in the final period of play, and in all but one
the final margin of victory was a single goal.
Friday, the Cardinal added to their list of hard-to-swal
low losses. Taking on top-ranked UCLA, the Stanford
women hoped to knock off a Bruins squad that featured a
number of Olympic and Junior National team members.
Despite falling behind early, the Cardinal rallied before ul
timately falling, 7-5.
The women bounced back Sunday to hand No. 14 UC-
Davis a 12-5 defeat in commanding fashion.
A predominantly pro-Cardinal crowd filled the Avery
Aquatic Center stands and lined the fence Friday, taking
the intensity of an already hyped matchup to a new level.
The Cardinal were unable to feed off the crowd's ener
gy in the early stages of the game. The Bruins stmck first
at 6:20, working a shot off of a cross-pass that tipped the
fingers of sophomore goalie Meridith McColl and drifted
across the goal line. A minute later, the Bruins capitalized
on another six-on-five advantage to lead.
With just over two minutes remaSiAin the period,
UCLA junior Thalia Munro took freshman
Gabrielle Dominic and netted the Bflnftird goal of the
evening. That play concluded the firwßßd scoring, and
despite playing physical and the Car
dinal faced an early 3-0 deficit.
"UCLA played extremely well to begin with and shot
the ball really well," head coach John Tanner said. "They
didn't significantly outplay us in the first quarter, but they
really were efficient with their chances and had two really
nice shots to start."
The Bruins took advantage of several Cardinal defen
sive lapses early in the second period and built their lead
to 5-0. The fifth goal was recorded by standout sophomore
driver Kelly Rulon on a three-on-two breakaway.
Despite being down five goals to the best team in the
nation, the Cardinal slowly began to turn things around at
both ends of the pool. Junior two-meter Nancy El-
Sakkary put the Cardinal on the board on a goal assisted
