finishes of junior Bryan Kelley and sophomore
Keith Avila in the javelin. Kelley threw the
javelin 190'5", while Avila threw a mark of
187\
"Keith and Bryan did a solid job this week
end," Weir said. "They came close to a season
best for both of them, so that was very excit
ing."
Sophomore Joaquin Chapa finished third
with a new personal best of 3:43.22 in the 1500-
meter run. His time qualified him for the
NCAA regionals.
The men's distance and middle distance had
another stellar weekend at the Mt. SAC relays.
Senior lan Dobson ran a career-best in
the 5,000-meter run, finishing fifth in
13:27.45. His time is the second-best in
school history.

with redshirt freshman Neftalem Araia, sopho
more Jonathan Pierce and senior Chris Emme,
all met the NCAA regional qualifying mark in
the S,(KK)-meter run on Friday.
Middle-distance runners senior Evan Fox
and redshirt freshman Russell Brown both had

solid performances in the 1,500-meter run. fin

3:45.03 and Brown's time of 3:45.24 were both
regional qualifying marks.
Freshman pole vaulter Graeme Hoste won
the pole vault with a mark of 16'3.25".
The women had an exciting weekend as
well, starting Wednesday at the California Invi
tational Heptathlon Championship, where se
nior Ahimsa Hodari competed. After two full
days of competition, Hodari finished fifth with
4,625 points.
"That was an improvement for Ahimsa,"
head women's coach Edrick Floreal said. "It is
another step for her in preparation for region
als."
At the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational, fresh
man Danielle Maier won the javelin throw in
145'9", setting a new freshman record for the
Cardinal and qualifying for regionals in her first
meet of the season.
Junior Samantha Shepard finished third in
the pole vault with a vault of 11 '5.75".
The women also performed well at the Mt.
SAC Relays. Senior Sara Bei finished third in
the 5,000-meter run, qualifying for regionals in
15:41.57.
"Sara had a fantastic performance," Floreal
said. "She shows great leadership and did a
great job this weekend."
" I felt pretty good," Bei said." I was ready to
be where I'm at right now."
Due to a lower-back injury early in the
school year, Bei did not begin training inten
sively until January.
"The season has been going pretty well."
Bei said. "I am getting back in to things. Indoor
season was really rushed because of my injury,
but now I have been getting a lot more training
under me, and I have been pretty happy with
the races so far. so I am really excited for the
rest of the season."
Despite her injury. Bei said she is optimistic
about her chances for the rest of the season.
"I am really thankful for the opportunity to
race and do a few hard workouts," Bei said. "I
am getting less mileage now than before, but I
am feeling confident that I will be able to ac
complish the goals I set for myself before the in
jury."
Along with Bei, junior Anita Siraki quali
fied for regionals in the 5.000 meters as well,
finishing in 16:37.73.

best in the hammer throw, finishing eighth. She

the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational with a regional
qualifying mark of 189'.
Freshman Melissa Yunghans had two solid
performances in the throws, finishing seventh
in the discus on Saturday and second in the shot
put on Sunday.
This Saturday, the Cardinal will compete at
home on Cobb Track and Angell Field against
California at the annual Big Meet. With only
two rival teams competing, the meet is more
like the annual football Big Game than a track

meet.
"I am excited," Bei said. "It is pretty
straightforward â€” you just heat the girls in
hlue. It is a fun meet to dominate Cal in the dis
tances."
The Cardinal women have never the lost the
Big Meet, and both Floreal and Weir said they
are excited for the team competition this week
end.
"This is one of the meets where the athletes
really come together as a team." Weir said.
