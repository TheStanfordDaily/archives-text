# Seniors learn 'Real' cooking

### CASSIDY DEUNE STAFF WRITER 
"It's that fast, that easy — nothing to be scared of," said
David lott, a Stanford chef, as he garnished a steaming
plate of penne pasta with pesto and arugala.
lott and his colleagues in Stanford Dining teamed up
with the Senior Class Council and the Stanford Parents'
Club to teach anxious seniors how to fill their plates with
healthy, easy-to-make meals. About 80 seniors and their
domestic tutors took over Tresidder Memorial Union last
night to learn everything from how to make fajitas to the
importance of buying fresh produce.
The event was the first of the Real World series orga
nized by the senior class presidents. According to organiz
ers, while similar events have occurred in past years, this is
the first time that a series of tutorials on real-world skills —
including basic finances and bartending — is being offered
to seniors preparing to leave the Stanford bubble.
"Regardless of whether we are going to a job or med
school or grad school, we're all getting kicked off of
University dining and realize that we have to cook,"

said Jen Graham, a senior class president and event co
ordinator. "The senior class has our formal and pub
night, but we wanted to do a different event that would
be more useful to students. Basically I asked myself,
'What do 1 need to learn before I graduate?' then put
on an event for it."
Graham is not the only one who would like to feel more
comfortable in the kitchen. Some student gourmands
came for inspiration and recipe ideas, but most attended
the event to get a hold of the basics of kitchen-sawy.
"I'm working on learning how to cook, or else I'm going
to starve," senior Brooks Kincaid said. "Plus it saves
money. It's is so damn expensive to eat out. Plus chicks dig
it."
Seniors wandered from various stations sampling and
learning from the experts — chefs from Stanford Dining
and parents. Demonstrations included Mexican chili-bean
salad, tabbouleh and the perfect cup of French-pressed
coffee.
Students were advised to buy fresh ingredients, invest in
