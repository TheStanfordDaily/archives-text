# Bremer highlights successes
## 
### BARRETT W. SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
With Secret Service agents stand
ing watch from either side of the
Memorial Auditorium stage, L. Paul
Bremer, the former leader of the
American occupation in Iraq, took
the velvet-curtained stage last night
to highlight what he called successes
of the American reconstruction ef
forts in Iraq and the war's signifi
cance in combating global terrorism.
Several students rushed to criticize
his policies in Iraq as soon as the ses
sion was opened to questions.
Opening his comments with an
invocation of September 11 — an
event that "brought home to Ameri
cans the new world we live in" —
Bremer described the new face of
terrorism.
"People ask: What's the root
cause of this terrorism?" he said.
"The root cause of the terrorism,
ladies and gentleman, is a hatred of
the West — of our success. They
hate us for what we are."
"It's fair to ask where the hatred
comes from," Bremer said. "What
motivates these guys? Well one
thing is for sure — it's not poverty."
Bremer spent only a small part of
his 50-minute speech on the issue of
terrorism before turning to his experi
ences in Iraq overseeing a reconstruc
tion staff of 3,(X)() from 25 countries.
He painted a vivid picture of Sad
dam Hussein's brutality, describing
well-known atrocities against his
people, including chemical attacks
and machine-gun shootings, as well
as lesser-known cruelties like
"human shredding machines" and
specialized "rape rooms" in police
stations.
"Undoubtedly, there are people
in this room who opposed the war,
and 1 understand that," he said. "But
I've got a challenge for you. When
it's safe in Iraq, go visit some of these
killing fields, these mass graves. I

guarantee once you have seen the
brutality of this regime with your
own eyes you will understand that
whatever else you thought, you will
understand we did a noble thing in
freeing the Iraqi people from one of
the most vicious tyrannies in the 20th
century."
During the lengthy question-and
answer session following Bremer's
remarks, opponents of the war al
most immediately began attacking
several of his comments. One ques
tioner contrasted Bremer's focus on
the humanitarian justifications for
the war with the administration's
stated aim of destroying chemical
and biological weapon stockpiles
that were never found.
"I'm a student of history," Bre
mer said. "Objectives of wars
change. The Civil War — as Lincoln

said in his first inaugural — was not
about slavery. But it became about
slavery. The Iraq war was initially
not about the human rights of the
Iraqi people. But that's what it be
came. Doesn't make it wrong."
Political Science Prof. Larry Dia
mond, who spent several months in
Iraq as an adviser to Bremer's provi
sional government, attended the
speech.
"I think that it was very eloquent,
but that he left out a lot of things,"
Diamond said. "For example, he left
out the fact that he was initially ex
tremely skeptical about the 25 per
cent quota" requirement for female
members of the new Iraqi parlia
ment. "We had to work very hard to
persuade him on that, but I give him
