# SLAC restarts accelerator

The B-mesons are back in business.
The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center's B-Factory
experiment — which produces B-mesons to probe the
mystery of how matter won out over anti-matter in the
moments following the Big Bang — is up and running
again, five months after it was shut down due to safety
concerns.
On Oct. 11, electrician David Simon was severely
burned while doing maintenance work on a live electrical
panel. SLAC shut down its accelerators indefinitely, and
in December the U.S. Department of Energy issued a
safety report concluding that "unsafe conditions have be
come a part of the everyday business" at SLAC.
Jonathan Dorfan, director of SLAC, shut down all the
accelerators immediately following the October fire, and
since then the lab has implemented "on the order of two
dozen" measures to improve safety, said John Seeman,
head of SLAC's accelerator department.
Seeman said SLAC no longer
does "hot work," or maintenance on
live electrical panels of the sort that
literally blew up in Simon's face.
"The people 1 work with feel that
they're better-trained now and have
better procedures, and they're more
conscious of safety issues," Seeman
said.
SLAC's other major accelerator,
the SPEAR 3 synchrotron radiation
facility, resumed operation shortly
after it was deemed safe in January.
David MacFarlane, a SLAC
spokesperson, said in a press release,
"I don't remember the last time the
accelerator complex was off for this
long. Everyone involved with the B-
Factory is excited to resume data
collection."
The B-Factory uses a two-mile
long particle accelerator to collide elec
trons with positrons, producing B
mesons. The Baßar detector records
the events, which can provide insight
into the "fundamental physics of the
universe," Seeman said.
Stanford's B-Factory is in compe
tition — friendly competition, ac
cording to Seeman — with the KEK
laboratory in Japan, whose Belle de
tector collects the same type of data.
The Belle has been running while the
Baßar detector was shut down, but
Seeman said the B-Factory's schedule
for the next 18 months has been re
configured to make up for lost time.
Both experiments have been run
ning for about four years, Seeman
said. The B-Factory experiment is
slated to run until 2008.
