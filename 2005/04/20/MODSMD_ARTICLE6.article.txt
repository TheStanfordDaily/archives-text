# SLAC restarts accelerator

The B-mesons are back in business.
The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center's B-Factory
experiment — which produces B-mesons to probe the
mystery of how matter won out over anti-matter in the
moments following the Big Bang — is up and running
again, five months after it was shut down due to safety
concerns.
On Oct. 11, electrician David Simon was severely
burned while doing maintenance work on a live electrical
panel. SLAC shut down its accelerators indefinitely, and
in December the U.S. Department of Energy issued a
safety report concluding that "unsafe conditions have be
come a part of the everyday business" at SLAC.
Jonathan Dorfan, director of SLAC, shut down all the
accelerators immediately following the October fire, and
since then the lab has implemented "on the order of two
dozen" measures to improve safety, said John Seeman,
head of SLAC's accelerator department.
