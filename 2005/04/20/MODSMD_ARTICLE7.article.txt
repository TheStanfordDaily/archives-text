thanked Elections Commissioner Troy Steinmetz for his
work during the election and established the wording for
the Senate Oath and the minimum vote required to cen

In past years, senators who missed many standing
committee meetings were expelled from the Senate.
However, the Senate has passed a bill adding the option
of censuring a senator for missing-three or more of these
committee meetings. The bill also established some pro
cedures for censuring a senator.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the Armenian
Student Association inquired if the Senate was going to
officially respond to the article printed in The Daily yes
terday regarding the recognition of the Armenian Geno
cide.
ASSU Undergraduate Chair Chris Lin, a senior, said
there would be no official statement from the Senate, but
individual senators can decide to submit articles address
ing the topic on their own.
