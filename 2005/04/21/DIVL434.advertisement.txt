Don't guess whether
you qualify for the EITC.
Know.
There's a lot to know about qualifying for the
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). You need to work
and earn less than $34,692. If you have children,
they must meet three qualifying tests. And that's
just to name a few. But the most important thing
to know is you can get help figuring it all out.
Visit us on the web, call 1-800-TAX-1040 or ask
your tax preparer. When it comes to getting
help claiming everything you honestly deserve,
consider it done.
