## The
						stigma of snacks and quickies part II 
### 
Two weeks ago, I wrote a
rather disapproving column
about the tempo of life on
the Stanford campus. Inspired by
Isabel Allende's words, I was tired
of living in a culture of snacks and
quickies. My column was an appeal
to slow things down or at least to
pay attention to the effects that
such a ridiculously fast-paced life
has on our health. To illustrate
these effects, I discussed the pit
falls of snacking and even
promised a follow-up article about
quickies.
Lately I have been feeling like a
huge hypocrite. Like many of my
fellow seniors, I have entered the
pre-real world stage and between
my last column and now, I did not
even have enough time to sleep, let
alone to sit down fora full-size
meal.
After several months of anxious

waiting, I finally
found out that
after graduation
I will move to
New York City
fora year-long
fellowship. The
initial euphoria
quickly disap
peared, and soon
I realized that I

have less than two months to tie all
the loose ends before I leave the
Farm and the blessed West Coast.
My to-do list is growing faster
than I can cross the completed
items off: fulfill the cursed GERs,
finish up the honors thesis, order
my cap and gown, send out gradu
ation announcements to anyone
who would be remotely interest
ed in buying me a gift, change my
Thefacebook.com status to
"alumnus/alumna," pay the ITSS
bill and the library fines and find
a place to live in the Big Man
zana.
I wish the concept of a time
transplant was not a mere figment
of imagination of South Park cre
ators. In one of the episodes of the
fine show, Cartman is struck with a
mysterious illness. The doctor di
agnoses him with "running out of
time" and declares that a time
transplant is the only thing that
could save him. Well, if that proce
dure actually existed, many of us
could certainly use one.
If this is your last quarter and
you get more mailings from the
Stanford Alumni Association
and the Senior Gift Committee
than from the all of the credit
card companies combined, you
know what I am talking about.
The rest of you — profros, un
derclassmen, prospective
coterms or fifth-years — may be
laughing now, but sooner of later
this day will come for you, too.
This prelude to the real world
will ruthlessly consume your
time, energy and peace of mind.
But before you pick up that old
copy of the Alumni Association
magazine and try to improve your
score on the terribly outdated and
dorky "101 Things to Do Before
You Graduate from Stanford"
test, sit down and think. If taking
Mummies for Dummies or playing
frisbee golf were that essential to
make your undergraduate experi
ence memorable, you would have
done it by now.
According to the wisdom of
Econ 1, there are trade-offs to
every choice that we make. At
Stanford, whether it comes to
classes, clubs, publications or so
cial activities, the choices are co
pious. We do not have the luxury
of 48-hour days or time trans
plants.
It is impossible to take every
class that sounds interesting or to
partake in every single Stanford
tradition, and that is why we pick
and choose. And these choices are
what makes your college experi
ence different from your parents'
or your freshman roommate's, so
appreciate your own path.
To those who have been expect
ing an article about quickies, don't
be disappointed: I actually have
nothing critical to say about that
particular form of sexual expres
sion. Stay safe, be happy and enjoy
the (last) spring quarter!
