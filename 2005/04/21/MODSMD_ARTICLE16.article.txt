# Stanford researches sleepless nights
## 
### COURTNEY WEAVER STAFF WRITER 
Like eating vegetables, exercising and
brushing one's teeth, we all know that getting
enough sleep is essential. But many people
don't get enough sleep — and not because
they're too busy to hit the sack — because
they literally can't.
Sleep disorders — ranging from restless leg
syndrome, or RLS, to sleep apnea — can
make it difficult for some to get their requisite
eight or so hours of sleep. But new research
suggests that many disorders can be treated, or
at least managed.
RLS is characterized exactly by its name;
it's a disease that causes an uncontrollable
urge to move or twitch one's legs. RLS suffer
ers have trouble sitting on airplanes, going to
movies and even sleeping. A new study by re
searchers at Stanford's School of Medicine
shows that treatment of RLS may be easier
than previously thought.
Co-investigator of the study and medical
student Scott Leibowitz said that about 10 to
15 percent of the population nationwide suf
fers from RLS and about half of this group in
herits the disorder. RLS can also be a side ef
fect of pregnancy and diseases such as Parkin
son's or even iron deficiency.
According to Leibowitz, RLS has "literally
driven people crazy," referring to one specific
instance of suicide.
A previous study conducted at Stanford in
2003 tested the effectiveness of taking the drug
Ropinirole, a drug that counters the effects of
a specific brain chemical — dopamine — that
can hinder sleep when it acts on one part of the
brain. The 2003 study looked at whether tak
ing the drug on a regular basis could treat RLS.
The new research, which is underway, tests
whether Ropinirole proves as effective when
used on an as-needed-basis.
The 12-week-long study is observing men
and women between the ages of 18 and 70 who
experience RLS intermittently, about two to
four times a week. Participants will come in
four times a week to report on the status of
their RLS and how it impacts their lives and
moods.
Local study participant Debby Rice decid
ed to participate in the research experiment
after years dealing with the "uncontrollable
urge" to move her legs, which she experiences
as a result of her RLS.
"It is almost as though I try to rein my legs
in, but after a period of time, the urge is too

strong and I must move them," said Rice. "The
severity of the urge varies, and sometimes
when I am on a plane I have almost continual
movement — like I am shaking water off my
leg. Most often, the sensations occur at night,
just before I go to sleep."
Having experienced RLS since age 13, Rice
has tried to remedy its bothersome symptoms
with treatments ranging from hot baths to vi
tamins, but none had proved effective.
"It has been a very strange and difficult
malady to describe, because it doesn't really
hurt, but it is very annoying," Rice said. "I
know that when the symptoms start, I'll have
five to six hours of no sleep."
Rice was thrilled about the possibility of an
RLS study at Stanford.
"I saw the ad in The [San Jose] Mercury
[News] and I was thrilled that someone was
delving into this problem," she said. "The pos
sibility of getting relief — or even finding in
formation about this condition caused me to
pick up the phone immediately. My husband,
who has silently suffered with my kicking legs,
practically dialed the phone for me."
So far, Rice is happy with the study?s
Ropinirole treatment and optimistic about her
condition in the future.
"I am thrilled with the preliminary results
and am already getting great relief," she said.
Psychology Prof, and sleep disorder spe
cialist Dr. William Dement estimates that
about 15 percent of the general population
suffers from RLS, but that since it affects
mostly older people, only roughly 5 percent
of undergraduates are affected by the con
dition. According to surveys he has dis
tributed over the years, a "very large per
centage" of Stanford students suffer from a
sleep disorder, depending on how strictly
you define what constitutes an actual sleep
disorder.
Dement said the most prevalent disease
among college students was biological clock
dependent alerting, which causes young peo
ple to fall asleep and wake up at later hours be
ginning in the early stages of adolescence.
Additionally, he estimated that roughly 9
percent of undergraduates experience sleep
apnea a condition which causes loss of breath
fora period of several seconds during sleep
and that even more students experience its
milder cousin snoring. According to Dement,
half the male undergraduate student body
snores and one fourth of the female under
graduates also suffers from snoring.
Freshman Koji Gardiner has been suffer-

ing from sleep apnea since tenth grade, when
he started to experience it once or twice a
month. Though the disease disappeared for
the most part after one year, it has since reap
peared with his arrival at Stanford.
Though Gardiner finds it hard to define an
exact time frame for his sleep apnea attacks,
he believes they occur for roughly 30 seconds
until he is able to wake up and take a few deep
breaths.
"I'm aware that I can't breathe and that if I
could only wake up, I could breathe," Gar
diner said.
Gardiner's attacks were more frequent,
however, than he originally realized. While he
thought that he experienced them only spo
radically, his girlfriend told him that they oc
curred at least two or three times in the space
of one night.
The disease is intensified by sleeping on
one's back, according to Webmd.com, an on
line health resource, and after doing research
on his condition. Gardner has since switched
to sleeping on his side. Sleep apnea can often
be a cause of exhaustion and tiredness due to
its prevention of deep sleep during the night.
However, Gardner is unsure whether his
fatigue is a result of his sleep apnea.

"I'm really tired all the time, but I don't
know if it's because of that," Gardiner said.
Dement said that chronic sleep loss is the
most prevalent sleep problem among college
students. While he said that sleep specialists
are unable to determine whether it's a behav
ioral or educational issue, he feels that it is an
issue that is significantly lacking awareness
and attention on campus.
"The last big challenge in the [sleep] field is
to get into the mainstream education," De
ment said.
Clete Kushida, a sleep disorder specialist at
the Stanford Medical Center, agrees that
chronic sleep loss is a significant issue on col
lege campuses.
"Even though college-age students are
very efficient sleepers, meaning that they are
able to sleep over 90 percent of the time that
they are in bed, they are often chronically
sleep deprived and carry a large sleep debt,"
he said.
Dement feels similarly.
"Easily one half of the student body would
benefit greatly from taking sleep as seriously
as [they take healthy] eating and fitness," said
Dement. "Sleep deprivation can get you into
horrible tragedy."

about 15 percent of the general population
suffers from RLS, but that since it affects
mostly older people, only roughly 5 percent
of undergraduates are affected by the con
dition. According to surveys he has dis
tributed over the years, a "very large per
centage" of Stanford students suffer from a
sleep disorder, depending on how strictly
you define what constitutes an actual sleep
disorder.
Dement said the most prevalent disease
among college students was biological clock
dependent alerting, which causes young peo
ple to fall asleep and wake up at later hours be
ginning in the early stages of adolescence.
Additionally, he estimated that roughly 9
percent of undergraduates experience sleep
apnea a condition which causes loss of breath
fora period of several seconds during sleep
and that even more students experience its
milder cousin snoring. According to Dement,
half the male undergraduate student body
snores and one fourth of the female under
graduates also suffers from snoring.
Freshman Koji Gardiner has been suffer-

ing from sleep apnea since tenth grade, when
he started to experience it once or twice a
month. Though the disease disappeared for
the most part after one year, it has since reap
peared with his arrival at Stanford.
Though Gardiner finds it hard to define an
exact time frame for his sleep apnea attacks,
he believes they occur for roughly 30 seconds
until he is able to wake up and take a few deep
breaths.
"I'm aware that I can't breathe and that if I
could only wake up, I could breathe," Gar
diner said.
Gardiner's attacks were more frequent,
however, than he originally realized. While he
thought that he experienced them only spo
radically, his girlfriend told him that they oc
curred at least two or three times in the space
of one night.
The disease is intensified by sleeping on
one's back, according to Webmd.com, an on
line health resource, and after doing research
on his condition. Gardner has since switched
to sleeping on his side. Sleep apnea can often
be a cause of exhaustion and tiredness due to
its prevention of deep sleep during the night.
However, Gardner is unsure whether his
fatigue is a result of his sleep apnea.

"I'm really tired all the time, but I don't
know if it's because of that," Gardiner said.
Dement said that chronic sleep loss is the
most prevalent sleep problem among college
students. While he said that sleep specialists
are unable to determine whether it's a behav
ioral or educational issue, he feels that it is an
issue that is significantly lacking awareness
and attention on campus.
"The last big challenge in the [sleep] field is
to get into the mainstream education," De
ment said.
Clete Kushida, a sleep disorder specialist at
the Stanford Medical Center, agrees that
chronic sleep loss is a significant issue on col
lege campuses.
"Even though college-age students are
very efficient sleepers, meaning that they are
able to sleep over 90 percent of the time that
they are in bed, they are often chronically
sleep deprived and carry a large sleep debt,"
he said.
Dement feels similarly.
"Easily one half of the student body would
benefit greatly from taking sleep as seriously
as [they take healthy] eating and fitness," said
Dement. "Sleep deprivation can get you into
horrible tragedy."

Like eating vegetables, exercising and
brushing one's teeth, we all know that getting
enough sleep is essential. But many people
don't get enough sleep — and not because
they're too busy to hit the sack — because
they literally can't.
Sleep disorders — ranging from restless leg
syndrome, or RLS, to sleep apnea — can
make it difficult for some to get their requisite
eight or so hours of sleep. But new research
suggests that many disorders can be treated, or
at least managed.
RLS is characterized exactly by its name;
it's a disease that causes an uncontrollable
urge to move or twitch one's legs. RLS suffer
ers have trouble sitting on airplanes, going to
movies and even sleeping. A new study by re
searchers at Stanford's School of Medicine
shows that treatment of RLS may be easier
than previously thought.
Co-investigator of the study and medical
student Scott Leibowitz said that about 10 to
15 percent of the population nationwide suf
fers from RLS and about half of this group in
herits the disorder. RLS can also be a side ef
fect of pregnancy and diseases such as Parkin
son's or even iron deficiency.
According to Leibowitz, RLS has "literally
driven people crazy," referring to one specific
instance of suicide.
A previous study conducted at Stanford in
2003 tested the effectiveness of taking the drug
Ropinirole, a drug that counters the effects of
a specific brain chemical — dopamine — that
can hinder sleep when it acts on one part of the
brain. The 2003 study looked at whether tak
ing the drug on a regular basis could treat RLS.
The new research, which is underway, tests
whether Ropinirole proves as effective when
used on an as-needed-basis.
The 12-week-long study is observing men
and women between the ages of 18 and 70 who
experience RLS intermittently, about two to
four times a week. Participants will come in
four times a week to report on the status of
their RLS and how it impacts their lives and
moods.
Local study participant Debby Rice decid
ed to participate in the research experiment
after years dealing with the "uncontrollable
urge" to move her legs, which she experiences
as a result of her RLS.
"It is almost as though I try to rein my legs
in, but after a period of time, the urge is too

strong and I must move them," said Rice. "The
severity of the urge varies, and sometimes
when I am on a plane I have almost continual
movement — like I am shaking water off my
leg. Most often, the sensations occur at night,
just before I go to sleep."
Having experienced RLS since age 13, Rice
has tried to remedy its bothersome symptoms
with treatments ranging from hot baths to vi
tamins, but none had proved effective.
"It has been a very strange and difficult
malady to describe, because it doesn't really
hurt, but it is very annoying," Rice said. "I
know that when the symptoms start, I'll have
five to six hours of no sleep."
Rice was thrilled about the possibility of an
RLS study at Stanford.
"I saw the ad in The [San Jose] Mercury
[News] and I was thrilled that someone was
delving into this problem," she said. "The pos
sibility of getting relief — or even finding in
formation about this condition caused me to
pick up the phone immediately. My husband,
who has silently suffered with my kicking legs,
practically dialed the phone for me."
So far, Rice is happy with the study?s
Ropinirole treatment and optimistic about her
condition in the future.
"I am thrilled with the preliminary results
and am already getting great relief," she said.
