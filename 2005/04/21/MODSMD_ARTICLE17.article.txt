# Ban lifted on silicon breast implants

"We live in a toxic culture," said Donovan Yisrael, com
munity health specialist at Vaden Student Health Clinic, re
ferring to the negative body-image messages delivered to
men and women through the media.
Having a negative body image can lead some to over-ex
ercise, but it is becoming increasingly popular nationwide to
undergo plastic surgery fora more dramatic change. In 2003
alone, more than 250,000 women underwent breast augmen
tation surgery, according to the American Society of Plastic
Surgeons.
Getting implants are more than a trend and societal stan
dards are the primary motivation for women who choose to
undergo such surgery, said junior Chethana Kulkarni.
"The buxom look has always been the classic image of
beauty, even during the 905." Kulkarni said. "Though runway
models were very thin, most magazine images and major ac
tresses were still fairly voluptuous women."
While most plastic surgery has been deemed relatively
safe, recent controversy has arisen over the decision by a fed
eral advisory panel to allow the commercial sale of previous
ly banned silicon breast implants
According to an April 7 article published in the New York
Times, health regulators estimate that up to 93 percent of sil
icone breast implants rupture in a women's breast within a
decade of surgery.
The rupture results in silicone leakage into the body,
which could lead to infection, pain, scarring — and in the
worst-case scenarios — connective-tissue and autoimmune
diseases, cancer and lupus.
Silicone-gel implants were first introduced in 1962 as
women in the United States were influenced by the allure of
the curvy and sensual Marilyn Monroe. At the time, the Food
and Drug Administration, or FDA, did not require docu
mented proof that ensured the safety and effectiveness of all
medical devices, so the possible complications from silicone
gel implants were unknown.
In 1992, silicone-gel implants were banned in the United
States when serious health concerns arose over the breaking
and leaking of implants. Several women complained of tissue
diseases, including multiple sclerosis, that resulted after their
implants ruptured. The FDA restricted the use of these im
plants to breast cancer patients and those participating in
strict research studies.
Women who wished to have cosmetic breast enhancement
surgery were left with only one option: saline implants. While
saline implants are safer and less expensive than silicone gel
implants — saline implants cost approximately $400, silicone
$800 — women often refuse saline implants because they feel
and look less natural.
Critics of the ban, however, have long contended that the
overlooked issue in restricting the number of women who can
receive breast implants is self-image. Such critics believe that
some women may receive much-needed self-esteem boosts

through breast enhancement.
Students here on campus have mixed feelings about plas
tic surgery — including breast implants.
Freshman Kate Vander Ploeg said that she thinks motiva
tion based on social pressure is a key factor for women con
sidering breast enhancement.
"I'm not a supporter of women who go out of their way to
impress men by dressing up or trying to change their physical
features, but there are different motives for getting breast im
plants," Vander Ploeg said. "I guess it all depends on who and
what you're doing it for."
And on the flip side, Vander Ploeg pointed out that many
women undergo breast reduction surgery for legitimate reasons.
"The stigma that surrounds breast enhancement does not
surround breast reduction, even though both are often done
for cosmetic reasons," Vander Ploeg said.
Senior Emersdn Sykes differentiates between medicine
and morality in considering the controversy over breast im
plants.
"The breast implant culture is kind of sad, but that's my
personal opinion," said Sykes. "The ban should be based on
medical issues. I know there have been serious problems with
implants."
Whether or not silicone implants are very dangerous is still
being debated.
A study by the FDA published in the May 2001 Journal
of Rheumatology supported the idea that the safety of sili
con implants is questionable. According to the study, in
which 344 women with silicone-gel implants were ques
tioned about symptoms experienced after breast implanta

tion. women who had experienced ruptures did not report
symptoms or illnesses different from women with intact im
plants.
The FDA also reported that while there was a correla
tion but not causation between leaking silicone gel and soft
tissue syndrome, also known as fibromyalgia. Women who
developed fibromyalgia before receiving implants could
not be distinguished from women who had a preexisting
condition of fibromyalgia. But since the study was a self-re
port not based on a medical examination, women who
completed the report may not have been aware of any
problems.
Conflicting evidence caused a nine-member federal advi
sory panel of plastic surgeons and other experts to overturn
the 1992 ban in October 2003. Yet the chairman of the panel
later wrote a letter to the FDA asking the administration to
reject the panel's overturn. The FDA agreed, ruling that
more studies were necessary to test the safety of silicone im
plants.
But last Wednesday, the same panel voted 7 to 2 to legal
ize silicone breast implants for women considering cosmetic
breast surgery. The vote came as a result of a three-day panel
featuring plastic surgery experts and women who had under
gone breast enhancement surgery.
While some women offered testimony that their implants
broke and leaked silicone into their bodies, causing serious ill
ness, many others testified that implants did nothing but
boost their self-confidence.
Because of a lack of findings that linked silicone implants
to debilitating disease, the panel recommended to allow Cal
ifornia-based Mentor Corporation to offer silicone breast im
plants to women who wish to undergo surgery for cosmetic
reasons. Another company, Inamed, had its petition to sell
the implants rejected because the panel found the company's
research inadequate.
If the FDA decides to approve the panel's recommenda
tion, many more women may decide to undergo cosmetic
breast enhancement. This is an implication that worries many
people, including Yisrael.
Yisrael sees the breast implantation culture as a mani
festation of distorted body image. Considering the risks as
sociated with silicone breast implants, Yisrael points out
that undergoing breast enlargement is similar to eating dis
orders.
"Overdieting and surgery are drastic means," said Yisrael.
"The fact that we do them in the name of beautification is ob
sessive."
While breast enhancement is not an issue that comes up
very often in Yisrael's interaction with Stanford students, he
still feels that cosmetic surgery is as much a manifestation of
body image issues just as overdieting.
According to the Yisrael, bad body image is a "culturally
transmitted disease" that spreads through conversations, lan
guage and the media.
"We have bad body image conversations — 'I'm so fat,'
Tm so ugly,' " he said. "It's normal, but it's not healthy."

to debilitating disease, the panel recommended to allow Cal
ifornia-based Mentor Corporation to offer silicone breast im
plants to women who wish to undergo surgery for cosmetic
reasons. Another company, Inamed, had its petition to sell
the implants rejected because the panel found the company's
research inadequate.
If the FDA decides to approve the panel's recommenda
tion, many more women may decide to undergo cosmetic
breast enhancement. This is an implication that worries many
people, including Yisrael.
Yisrael sees the breast implantation culture as a mani
festation of distorted body image. Considering the risks as
sociated with silicone breast implants, Yisrael points out
that undergoing breast enlargement is similar to eating dis
orders.
"Overdieting and surgery are drastic means," said Yisrael.
"The fact that we do them in the name of beautification is ob
sessive."
While breast enhancement is not an issue that comes up
very often in Yisrael's interaction with Stanford students, he
still feels that cosmetic surgery is as much a manifestation of
body image issues just as overdieting.
According to the Yisrael, bad body image is a "culturally
transmitted disease" that spreads through conversations, lan
guage and the media.
"We have bad body image conversations — 'I'm so fat,'
Tm so ugly,' " he said. "It's normal, but it's not healthy."

"We live in a toxic culture," said Donovan Yisrael, com
munity health specialist at Vaden Student Health Clinic, re
ferring to the negative body-image messages delivered to
men and women through the media.
Having a negative body image can lead some to over-ex
ercise, but it is becoming increasingly popular nationwide to
undergo plastic surgery fora more dramatic change. In 2003
alone, more than 250,000 women underwent breast augmen
tation surgery, according to the American Society of Plastic
Surgeons.
Getting implants are more than a trend and societal stan
dards are the primary motivation for women who choose to
undergo such surgery, said junior Chethana Kulkarni.
"The buxom look has always been the classic image of
beauty, even during the 905." Kulkarni said. "Though runway
models were very thin, most magazine images and major ac
tresses were still fairly voluptuous women."
While most plastic surgery has been deemed relatively
safe, recent controversy has arisen over the decision by a fed
eral advisory panel to allow the commercial sale of previous
ly banned silicon breast implants
According to an April 7 article published in the New York
Times, health regulators estimate that up to 93 percent of sil
icone breast implants rupture in a women's breast within a
decade of surgery.
The rupture results in silicone leakage into the body,
which could lead to infection, pain, scarring — and in the
worst-case scenarios — connective-tissue and autoimmune
diseases, cancer and lupus.
Silicone-gel implants were first introduced in 1962 as
women in the United States were influenced by the allure of
the curvy and sensual Marilyn Monroe. At the time, the Food
and Drug Administration, or FDA, did not require docu
mented proof that ensured the safety and effectiveness of all
medical devices, so the possible complications from silicone
gel implants were unknown.
In 1992, silicone-gel implants were banned in the United
States when serious health concerns arose over the breaking
and leaking of implants. Several women complained of tissue
diseases, including multiple sclerosis, that resulted after their
implants ruptured. The FDA restricted the use of these im
plants to breast cancer patients and those participating in
strict research studies.
Women who wished to have cosmetic breast enhancement
surgery were left with only one option: saline implants. While
saline implants are safer and less expensive than silicone gel
implants — saline implants cost approximately $400, silicone
$800 — women often refuse saline implants because they feel
and look less natural.
Critics of the ban, however, have long contended that the
overlooked issue in restricting the number of women who can
receive breast implants is self-image. Such critics believe that
some women may receive much-needed self-esteem boosts

through breast enhancement.
Students here on campus have mixed feelings about plas
tic surgery — including breast implants.
Freshman Kate Vander Ploeg said that she thinks motiva
tion based on social pressure is a key factor for women con
sidering breast enhancement.
"I'm not a supporter of women who go out of their way to
impress men by dressing up or trying to change their physical
features, but there are different motives for getting breast im
plants," Vander Ploeg said. "I guess it all depends on who and
what you're doing it for."
And on the flip side, Vander Ploeg pointed out that many
women undergo breast reduction surgery for legitimate reasons.
"The stigma that surrounds breast enhancement does not
surround breast reduction, even though both are often done
for cosmetic reasons," Vander Ploeg said.
Senior Emersdn Sykes differentiates between medicine
and morality in considering the controversy over breast im
plants.
"The breast implant culture is kind of sad, but that's my
personal opinion," said Sykes. "The ban should be based on
medical issues. I know there have been serious problems with
implants."
Whether or not silicone implants are very dangerous is still
being debated.
A study by the FDA published in the May 2001 Journal
of Rheumatology supported the idea that the safety of sili
con implants is questionable. According to the study, in
which 344 women with silicone-gel implants were ques
tioned about symptoms experienced after breast implanta

tion. women who had experienced ruptures did not report
symptoms or illnesses different from women with intact im
plants.
The FDA also reported that while there was a correla
tion but not causation between leaking silicone gel and soft
tissue syndrome, also known as fibromyalgia. Women who
developed fibromyalgia before receiving implants could
not be distinguished from women who had a preexisting
condition of fibromyalgia. But since the study was a self-re
port not based on a medical examination, women who
completed the report may not have been aware of any
problems.
Conflicting evidence caused a nine-member federal advi
sory panel of plastic surgeons and other experts to overturn
the 1992 ban in October 2003. Yet the chairman of the panel
later wrote a letter to the FDA asking the administration to
reject the panel's overturn. The FDA agreed, ruling that
more studies were necessary to test the safety of silicone im
plants.
But last Wednesday, the same panel voted 7 to 2 to legal
ize silicone breast implants for women considering cosmetic
breast surgery. The vote came as a result of a three-day panel
featuring plastic surgery experts and women who had under
gone breast enhancement surgery.
While some women offered testimony that their implants
broke and leaked silicone into their bodies, causing serious ill
ness, many others testified that implants did nothing but
boost their self-confidence.
