# Juniors crawl for AIDS charity
## 
### STEPHANIE FAGLIANO 
Leo Chau and Sean Duffy, juniors at the University
of Colorado at Boulder and Columbia University, re
spectively, will crawl 33 miles on June 10 and 11 to
enter the Guinness Book of World Records for the
longest distance continuously crawled. In the process,
they are raising money for the Elizabeth Glaser Pedi
atric AIDS Foundation, or EGPAF, an international
organization that works to provide care and treatment
for those suffering with HIV / AIDS and to fund re
search for new treatments.
Chau and Duffy have already raised more than
$1(),(XX) to date and aim to bring in more than $2(),(XX)
by the time they break the record.
"We are crawling so children can as well," Chau and
Duffy stated on their Web site. "The Elizabeth Glaser
Pediatric AIDS Foundation is more than deserving."
The two estimate that the crawl will take up to 38
hours; they must keep at least one knee in contact with
the ground at all times, except during bathroom
breaks.
As they crawl the 120 laps around a track in Col
orado Springs, their only protection will be knee pads.
Even during meals, one knee must remain on the
ground. Both students will crawl the entire distance in
tandem without trading off.
Duffy explained in an e-mail to The Daily why he
and Chau chose EGPAF as their charity.
"Columbia University Dance Marathon also works
with the charity and through this they really inspired
Leo and I," he said. "No child should be born with
AIDS and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foun

dation is working hard to assure that goal."
Because they were unable to find a guide to crawl
ing on the Internet, Chau and Duffy said they have also
considered compiling a crawling manual based on their
experience.
Starting the training process and forming a workout
routine was a strenuous undertaking, Duffy said.
"We have been doing tons of core work, back work,
shoulder work, leg work, as well as crawling itself," he
added. "We are also running a great deal, cycling, rock
climbing, and every Tuesday and Thursday at 8 a.m.
you can find me on the Stairmaster."
For Chau, the most difficult part of the preparation
has been finding free time.
"This event has literally engulfed us with work far
beyond what we had imagined," Chau said. "We have
never taken on anything this big and were quite sur
prised with how much work was needed to make this
event a success."
Majoring in molecular, cellular and developmental
biology, Chau said his ultimate goal is to graduate from
medical school and specialize in pediatrics. He said he
hopes to work for Doctors Without Borders sometime
in the future.
Duffy, who studies neuroscience and behavior, said
he aspires to become a surgeon.
So far they have been interviewed by five radio
stations nationwide, featured in four news articles
and have been contacted by three news stations
around Colorado Springs. They also created a Web
site — 33milecrawl.com — with information about
the crawl and a daily log they have kept throughout
their training.
