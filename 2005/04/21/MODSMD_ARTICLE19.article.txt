# Women politicians discuss barriers
## 
### CHUAN-MEI LEE DESK EDITOR 
Oakland Councilmember Desley
Brooks and Washington Court of Ap
peals Judge Mary Kay Becker spoke on a
panel focusing on women's role in poli
tics last night as part of the Women's
Community Center's month-long Her
story celebration. They described how
women in politics have different experi
ences than their male peers and offered
perspectives on the barriers that women
in the field continue to confront.
Brooks argued that female politicians
are sometimes not taken as seriously as
men in similar positions.
"If I were a man, would you talk to me
like that?" Brooks asked. "I can't tell you
the number of stupid things people have
said to me."
Brooks also said that she has seen
some of her female colleagues defer to
men, in effect turning power over to their
male colleagues voluntarily.
"There are things we need to do col
lectively to hold on to our power," she
said.
Becker, a Stanford alumna, said she

was initially afraid people would assume
that she was specializing in what some
consider to be "softer" issues, such as
those relating to children and women.
"After time went by, I realized the
thing to do was to elevate children's is
sues to the level of the gas tax or the for
est tax," she said,
California Assemblywoman Carol
Liu, who was originally scheduled to
speak at the event, cancelled at the last
moment. According to senior Allison
Gaw, one of the panel's coordinators, Liu
had to attend an event with her husband.
The irony of the situation was not lost
upon Gaw, who said that Liu, who is part
of an older generation, "had to go with
her husband."
Toward the end of the talk, both
Brooks and Becker were asked to com
ment on their relationships with the
press.
"I hate the press," Brooks said, half
jokingly.
"I try to stay away from [the media]
because if they're going to write it, it's
going to be different from how you'd
write it," Becker said.
However, they agreed that as politi

cians there is no avoiding the press.
Rather. Becker said that the challenge for
journalists is to understand complicated
issues, such as legislative budgets, and the
best way to convey them to the public.
Becker told The Daily that she had al
ways wanted to works as a foreign corre
spondent. While at Stanford, she worked
as a news editor for The Daily the day
that President John F. Kennedy was shot.
She eventually entered politics after
getting involved in environmentalism
and co-authoring "Superspill," a fictional
account of a major oil spill on Puget
Sound in Washington state.
Senior Jen Chen, who said she plans
to attend law school next year, attended
the talk because she was interested in see
ing what career paths are available to
lawyers.
"I actually really enjoyed it," Chen
said. "They came from slightly different
perspectives, but they agreed on some
important things, like not giving into out
side events."
Chen is a member of the Sigma Psi
Zeta Sorority, which co-sponsored the
event with the Stanford Women's Com
munity Center.
