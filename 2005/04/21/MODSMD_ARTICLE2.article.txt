Two debates on gay marriage, a film screening and
Genderfuk. the annual drag-themed party. These have
all been part of this year's Queerness Awareness Days,
or QuAD. celebration, which began early this month and
will culminate on May 7 with the Queer Formal.
According to OuAD coordinator Kate Pedatella, a
senior, one of the program's priorities is to reach out to
student organizations that are not directly linked to the
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community
Resources Center. This has resulted in not only a variety
of events, but also a diverse audience at these events, Pe
datella added.
The first activity of the month, for example, was co
sponsored by the Asian American Activities Center.
The discussion shed light on what it is like to be queer
and Asian American.
"People with just one identity or both felt like they
had something to learn and contribute," Pedatella said.
Senior John Snowden said that many of the topics
highlight themes and issues that are not only relevant to
the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities,
but to the Stanford community as a whole.
"You don't have to be queer-identified to have an in
terest in queer issues, and [campus queer groups] have
done an incredible job of making their programs exciting

and accessible to everyone," Pedatella said.
Qu AD organizers said that the events have been well
attended. GenderFuk attracted hundreds of community
members last Saturday despite the $3 entry fee, and Pe
datella attributed its popularity to its novelty.
GenderFuk was an "opportunity for anyone to ex
press themselves in a way that they don't normally get
the chance to," she said.
Some of the smaller events are expected to draw be
tween 15 and 50 attendees, she added.
The gay marriage events, including the debate held
last night, attracted audience members from all over the
