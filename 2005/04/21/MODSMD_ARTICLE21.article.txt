## Editorial Make rush shorter, less intense 
### 
The fliers promise, "This is the time of your life!"
Or, more creatively, "Find Brotherhood while Riding
a Mechanical Bull!" And yes. Interfraternity Council
and Intersority Council rushes can often he the entry
way to fun. supportive communities that are a part of
Stanford's social life. On the other hand, the rush pro
cess itself can be overlong and taxing for potential fra
ternity brothers and sorority sisters.
Both demand unreasonable time commitments
from potential pledges. Each fraternity hosts four
three-hour events over a period of two weeks, and
rushees are expected to attend at least three of them.
For students interested in rushing more than one fra
ternity, the hours start to add up, and the process can
take over people's lives. Potential sorority sisters face
a shorter, but more intense process, with daily
marathon bonding sessions taking place over one
week. At the first session, an "open house." rushees
are expected to visit all five sororities, even if they are
only interested in one of them.
According to the Office of Student Activities'
Greek life Web page, "Going Greek at Stanford does
not mean a risk in sacrificing other opportunities ..."
However, given the large time commitment involved
in fraternity rush, it is difficult to see how participation
in rush would not require sacrifices in other areas.
Certainly, any student who accepts membership into

a fraternity is agreeing to spend substantial time with
other members of that organization. But it is unfair to
expect students who have not yet received a commit
ment from an organization to devote such a significant
portion of their time to it.
Sorority rush also has its problems, too. Sorority
members invite a decreasing number of applicants to
each day's invitational party, meaning that potential
sorority sisters go through every party with the threat
of being "cut" from the process hanging over their
heads. Of course, rejections are an unavoidable part
of any application process, but the format of sorority
rush â€” not just the threat of rejection, but the em
phasis on relatively superficial interaction at parties
has uncanny similarities to "Survivor."
In the end. the rush process reinforces the unfor
tunate belief that application processes must be dif
ficult and grueling, so that applicants can prove
themselves "worthy." We encourage both fraternity
and sorority members to rethink the less pleasant
aspects of rushing. In particular, they should go fur
ther in emphasizing creative programming and in
depth interviews. Furthermore, they should take the
OSA's promise that Greek life does not mean "sac
rificing other opportunities" more seriously, and
find ways to make the process less time-consuming
and intensive.
