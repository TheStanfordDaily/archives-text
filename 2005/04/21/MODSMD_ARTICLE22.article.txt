# Writing in the Margins
## This one's for the little guy 
### 
I'd like to believe that my column is
widely adored and loved. II not loved
and adored, then at least read by a
large audience with great interest.
There are at least 1,000 people who
wake up every morning and ask them
selves, "Is it Thursday yet?" Well, my
dear readers, it is Thursday, and that
means I'm here to make your day more
exciting. And as a token of my appreci
ation for your never-ending devotion to

my beautiful prose, this week's column will be about one
of the little people without whom 1 would be nothing.
Alyssa Schwartz lives two floors above me. Currently,
the door to her room is covered with a ceiling-high, con
struction paper tree-trunk which severely limits access to el
cuarto de Alyssa. Based on previous experience, I
wouldn't be surprised if she stalks me in the hall today and
quietly offers this sage suggestion: "I think you should
write this week's column about having a ceiling-high, con
struction paper tree-trunk blocking your door."
Alyssa likes giving me suggestions for my columns. God
knows 1 need all the help I can get. How many words can I
devote todustjackets? But what she offers as relatable fod
der for "Writing in the margins" is often Alyssa-only
quirks. Recently, I sat down to have a conversation with
Alyssa about some of the column ideas she has offered.
Me: So, Alyssa, what are some of the things you've told
me to write about?
Alyssa: Well, 1 really like the smell of paperbacks, es
pecially new ones. And I buy paperbacks based on their
texture. I can't handle glossy covers; they have to be matte.
1 oftfcn buy books that 1 never read.
Alyssa's obviously holding out on me. 1. the book
lovers' everyman, enjoy the smell of paperbacks, especial
ly old paperbacks with browning pages that reek of acid.

and half of the books on my bookshelf remain unopened,
years after I handed over $25 for their overpriced leaves.
But I have a plan. Alyssa's too kind to push me out of her
room. As long as I don't budge from her couch, I can work
on breaking her down until she confesses to her strange lit
erary ways.
It took a long time (the batteries in my tape, recorder
ran out. so I couldn't transcribe the conversation), but
eventually Schwartzie gave in and handed me her red
Stanford University notebook filled with pages of books,
alphabetized by title (not the author's name). Alyssa has
kept this notebook since the end of freshman year — she's
now a junior.
The notebook reveals interesting little details. For ex
ample. she's on a first name basis with certain authors, like
Dave Eggers. who is referred to. lovingly, as Dave. She also
tries to relate everything in her reality to that of books, as
though she's constantly trying to inform us that she really,
really identifies with Don Quixote.
Alyssa started reading when she was 3. It didn't take her
long to begin checking out large, widely read books, like
those of John Grisham (age 9). She reads cookbooks and
makes sure to visit obscure literary landmarks, like Klicki
tat Street where Ramona from the Beverly Cleary books
lived. While this is all very interesting, I can't help but feel
that she's still not telling me the whole truth.
I, being somewhat normal, may not be able to handle
the truth. So, I dedicate this column to the memory of her
often normal, always interesting and sometimes humorous
quirks — so that I never have to write about them again.

Alyssa Schw artz is a really great person, and Seth's ego just
went on a trip this week. She has many relatable book quirks
and would love to talk to you about them at
aaschwart:(p ] stanford.edit. Send your complaints and per
sonal attacks to Setli Shamban at sshamban@stanford.edu.
