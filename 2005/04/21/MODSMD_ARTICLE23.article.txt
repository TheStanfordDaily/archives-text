# Op-Ed
## Vetting and understanding research 
### UNDA DARLING-HAMMOND 
On April 18, an Op-Ed by Wendy kopp. president of
Teach for America, or TFA, criticized The Daily's cover
age of a study presented the previous week at the Ameri
can Educational Research Association meetings in Mon
treal ("Considering the social responsibility of academia
and journalism"). Her concern was both The Daily's head
line and article ("Study Raises Ouestions about Teach for
America," April 15) and the study itself, which I conduct
ed with colleagues here at Stanford.
Kopp alleged that the study had not been independent
ly reviewed (not true), that the analyses might have had
small sample sizes, which were not published (not true â€”
the large sample sizes were published in the appendix) and
that the study was at odds with another study of TFA by
Mathematica Policy Research, which endorsed the pro
gram's effectiveness (also not true, as described below).
Much larger than the Mathematica study (which looked
fora single year at only 41 TFA teachers and about 57
other teachers spread across six different cities), our study
looked at achievement gains on six tests over a six-year pe
riod for more than 132, (XX) students taught by more than
4,400 teachers in Houston, Texas.
The study found that certified teachers are more effec
tive than uncertified teachers in producing student
achievement gains. Uncertified TFA teachers and others
were less effective than fully prepared and certified teach
ers of comparable experience levels in similar schools.
This is not a very surprising finding. Nor should it be
threatening to an organization that aims to serve inner city
children well and has gone to some lengths to try to learn
how to do so. It also is not a wholesale condemnation of
TFA, whose recruits generally became certified over two
or three years of teaching in Houston.
We were able to confirm a key finding of the Mathe

matica study and another study conducted by researchers
at the Hoover Institution: Compared to other similarly ex
perienced teachers in similar schools serving low-income
and minority students, at least in some years and on some
tests. TFA teachers were about as effective as other teach
ers in teaching reading and (on one test) a bit more effec
tive in teaching math. Like the other studies, we found that
this comparison was due mostly to other underprepared
teachers who predominate in these schools. In fact, in some
years TFA teachers were more likely to be certified than
other teachers in the same or similar schools.
However, we found that the positive results for TFA
did not hold up in all years on all tests. When Houston's
teachers were relatively better prepared in later years, the
comparison to TFA recruits became less favorable. Over
all. uncertified TFA recruits had a significant negative ef
fect on achievement on five of six tests. Like the other stud
ies, we also found that although they became more effec
tive when they became certified, virtually all of the TFA
teachers left within three years, providing few Houston
students with the benefits of their emerging competence.
It's important to look beyond specific programs to ask
the bigger policy question: Rather than pitting under-pre
pared teachers against others in comparisons of effective
ness. how can policies provide well-qualified teachers to
low-income students of color? Urban districts that have
staffed all their schools with well-prepared teachers have
addressed salaries and working conditions as well as prepa
ration and induction to ensure that teachers will be pre
pared to teach effectively and will want to stay in teaching.
While a band-aid tina bleeding sore is helpful in a crisis,
healing the wounds of inequality and poverty is also a pol
icy problem worth solving.
