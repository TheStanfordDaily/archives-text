The objective
of Stanford Uni
versity, Jane and
Leland Stanford
wrote in their
Founding Grant
in 1885, is "to
qualify its stu
dents for person
al success, and
direct usefulness

in life ... to promote the public
welfare by exercising an influence
in behalf of humanity and civiliza
tion; teaching the blessings of liber
ty regulated by law, and inculcating
love and reverence for the great
principles of government as de
rived from the inalienable rights of
man to life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness." It's interesting, 1
think, to keep that stated objective
in mind when reading the following
information and quotes:
Sources of funds for the 2003-2004
fiscal year:
37 percent sponsored research
16 percent endowment income
3 percent other investment income
19 percent student income
9 percent health care services income
4 percent expendable gifts
12 percent other income

"What could universities be?
Well, the course offerings could be
designed for the benefit of the stu
dents. Too often the courses of
fered are not what undergraduates
should study but what the faculty
wants to teach . . .
"The social class markings that
the degree brings are an escalator
to a more successful life after grad
uation. It is not so much the educa
tional experience as the social class
identification that is the payoff. It's
what the degree connected to the
name of the institution stands for.
The endowment of social class is
the selective private university's
major asset...
"A knowledgeable friend of a
private university with a superior
academic reputation echoed the stu
dent's observation while reaching
out to include the faculty. When
asked what he thought Stanford
University's most serious problems
might be. he replied: 'Just one. I
wonder whether this excellent, re
search-oriented faculty and this
splendid student body with its di
verse interests haven't drifted to
ward a kind of unwritten agreement:
you don't bother us too much, and
we won't bother you too much.' "
— Richard Huber, "How Profes
sors Play the Cat Guarding the
Cream." 1992.
"At a more pragmatic level.

does college truly lead to better
jobs? Not necessarily. The more
people go to college, the less a col
lege degree is worth. Though col
lege graduates definitely earn more
than high school graduates, more
and more businesses require a col
lege degree for jobs that used to be
performed by people without de
grees. It's not unheard of for book
stores to insist on some college ex
perience for their applicants, and
many positions, regardless of the
nature of the business, are open
only to college graduates. Yet the
salary of these jobs is often mini
mal, and the types of jobs that
count as 'college jobs' would sur
prise many people.
"The Bureau of Labor Statistics
defines the following as college
jobs: manager of a Blockbuster
video store, legal secretary, insur
ance claims adjuster. Not all col
lege graduates get 'college jobs.'
Some end up waiting tables, or sell
ing clothing, or driving vans."
— Zachary Karabell, "What's
College For?" 1998.
"At present, the universities are
supposed to provide, in a more sys
tematic way, what the leisure class
provided accidentally and as a by
product. This is a great improve
ment, but it has certain drawbacks.
University life is so different from
life in the world at large that men
who live in an academic milieu tend
to be unaware of the preoccupa
tions and problems of ordinary
men and women; moreover their
ways of expressing themselves are
usually such as to rob their opin
ions of the influence that they
ought to have upon the general
public. Another disadvantage is
that in universities studies are or
ganized, and the man who thinks of
some original line of research is
likely to be discouraged. Academic
institutions, therefore, useful as
they are, are not adequate
guardians of the interests of civi
lization in a world where everyone
outside their walls is too busy for
unutilitarian pursuits.
"In a world where no one is
compelled to work more than four
hours a day, every person pos
sessed of scientific curiosity will
be able to indulge it, and every
painter will be able to paint with
out starving, however excellent
his pictures may be. Young writ
ers will not be obliged to draw at
tention to themselves by sensa
tional pot-boilers, with a view to
acquiring the economic indepen
dence needed for monumental
works, for which, when the time at
last comes, they will have lost the
taste and the capacity."
— Bertrand Russell, "In Praise of
Idleness and other essays," 1935.
In next week's column, I'm
going to look at careers.
