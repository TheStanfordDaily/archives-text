Most senators abstained on
Armenian genocide bill
On April 19, The Daily editorial
hoard criticized the ASSU Under
graduate Senate's passage of a bill re
garding the 1915 Armenian genocide
("Bill on Armenian genocide falls
outside of Senate's purview"). The
Daily was right to admonish the Sen
ate for passing a bill on a "non-cam
pus-related" issue. According to the
ASSU Constitution, Senate resolu
tions can only be passed about an
issue only "if there is at least one Stan
ford student who is affected by the

matter in a substantially different
manner than would be the case if he or
she were not a university student."
However, The Daily failed to re
port that the bill was passed by a vote
of 4-1-5. Half the senators present ab
stained on the vote because we felt it
was an inappropriate topic for the
Senate to consider. In retrospect, our
stance on passing bills on non-cam
pus-related issues would have been
clearer had we voted no.
It should be made clear to students
that only four senators felt it was ap
propriate to address non-campus-re
lated issues. Rather than casting one

"no" vote and five abstentions, the six
who objected should have been unit
ed in a "no" vote, on the basis of this
being an issue outside the purview of
the ASSU.
I hope that the controversy over
this matter makes it clear to the new
Senate that it is inappropriate — and
unconstitutional — for the ASSU to
take stances on issues that do not have
a direct effect on Stanford students.
