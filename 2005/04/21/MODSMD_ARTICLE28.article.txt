## The 						Double Clutch Fun, games and PSAs at KZSU 
### 
With my experience as a PA announc
er and with an unhealthy obsession
with sports issues and statistics, I
decided to augment my winter schedule by
getting involved with the KZSU sports de
partment.
For those of you who have been avoiding
the radio lately — and I know it's easy with
all those iPods floating around — KZSU 90.1
FM is Stanford's noncommercial radio sta
tion, which claims to cover more sports than
any other student station in the country.
And what a blast it is. KZSU Sports gets to
follow Stanford teams all around the coun
ty. chase down coaches and propagate their
yoices across the South Bay and through the
internet.
And to be honest, I'd much rather listen to

a dedicated student bring
tne a college game than
Someone who earns his keep
by shilling for Coke or
Mickey Mouse.
I quickly caught on to the
Internet-only Softball
broadcasts to hone my craft,
where I am on a rotating
two-man crew with Eric
Ford and hardened KZSU
sports veteran Andy I-Mel-

low-Glue (pronounced 'Aymeloglu').
Ford presents a warm narrative of a calm
observer, guiding the listener through each
inning. Avmeloglu's straighforward style
couples with his random-access collection of
stats fora no-nonsense approach.
In between this I try to bring in my knowl
edge of coaching with a running analysis on
the game dynamics and strategy, although
I'm sure the listenership wants me to shut up
and announce the game. I began my gig imi
tating the Red Sox radio men I used to listen
to in Boston. Maybe I should have modeled
myself after Harry Doyle from Major League
instead.
A friend once told me that you couldn't
teach the two requirements for broadcasting:
talent and knowledge. When you consider
that no fewer than eight broadcasters moon
light at The Daily, including managing editor
of sports Scott Allen, those things are pretty
well taken care of.
The broadcasters pay their dues with engi
neering time. A staffer huddles, beaver-like,
in the basement studio, patching in the game
and cueing up the underwriting spots and
public service announcements for when the
broadcaster goes to the bathroom.
The PSAs we have are actually quite var
ied. There's one in which Barry Bonds trash
es the AL while stumping against drunk driv
ing, one in which Willie Nelson calls for mar
ijuana legalization and a spot about drowsy
driving in which the guy's voice seriously
makes me want to go to sleep.
Then there's the Bootleg.com cart, where
Sean Bruich invites us to the "super busy
message boards." Fora good time, ask Sean
about that dead weight of an inside joke.
One of the unglamorous jobs of being a
sports director is coordinating the broadcast
engineering, which means harassing the
KZSU sports department until one of us
gives up our Saturday afternoon or weekday
evening. There was more than one week
where we didn't come through, starting a
Marx Brothers-like sequence of frantic e
mails from Sean, leading to the general
KZSU staff bailing us out to get the games on

the air. (Thanks, guys.)
Although Ford was caught in
egregious profanity by rooting for
Washington in last week's softball
broadcast, we are dealing with ded
icated Stanford fans, and at times
we shamelessly abdicate what an
other station would call "profes
sionalism."
Women's basketball broadcast
er Daniel Novinson is knowledge
able and talented, but as a fresh
man he is also rough around the

edges. During one broadcast, he
launched into an unprompted
tirade expressing his great dislike
for USC.
I will never forget walking into
the studio on the night of the
women's game at Cal. Novinson had
somehow wound up alone on the
broadcast in a hostile arena, running
on nothing but adrenaline the entire
first half. His frenetic pace held up
so long I was worried he would need
oxygen at one of the breaks.
I was engineering the women's
NCAA tournament loss to Michi
gan State when I relayed to Novin
son at a break that I was a Michigan
fan (we have a lot of those on the
staff too, for some reason). He then

informed the listening audience
"how much Topher despises Michi
gan State." Great.
He's not the only one to cross
radio boundaries. Last fall's volley
ball match against Washington saw
the Cardinal come back from two
games down and survive eight
match points to win.
The broadcasters kept us
abreast of their hyperventilation,
leg twitching and. at one point, An
drew Rogers' bladder control.
Upon announcing the service ace
that won it for Stanford, Brad Bur
ton threw off his headset and burst
into the raucous on-court crowd.
That left Rebecca Harlow to ex
haustedly blurt out the radio call

letters before going to break to
enjoy the celebration herself.
As for my enjoyment, there's
few places I'd rather be on a warm
spring afternoon than with a head
set announcing a Softball game.
Following the powerhouse team
into the Pacific-10 Conference
schedule has been nothing but joy
— if you forget about the time I was
chased away by coach John
Rittman for walking on the freshly
tended field.

Christopher P. Anderson would like
to thank chief engineer Mark
Law rence as well as Scott Allen, who
