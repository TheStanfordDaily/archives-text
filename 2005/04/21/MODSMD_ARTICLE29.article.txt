# Grube makes it look easy

To answer your question, no â€” uiit's not this easy.
Maneuvering a golf ball around some of the most pun
ishing courses in the country, from the wind and rain of Ore
gon to the greens of California's Pasatiempo Golf Club.
Fighting the finest young players in the land from tee to
green on the weekends while fighting the onset of sleep in I-
Hum lecture during the week. Placing a storied Stanford
golf program squarely on your back when you're already
toting around a full academic load and a backpack jammed
with the densest reading material this side of Webster.
Let's just say it puts winning that $10 Nassau at the club
last weekend to shame.
But watch Rob Grube and you're bound to think doing
all that is as easy as he makes it seem.
"[Grube] is a person I wish I could have recruited," first
year coach Conrad Ray said. "I'm lucky to have him."

North Carolina golf powers of Duke and Wake Forest.
"I tried to spend my time at Duke and Wake because I
didn't know anything about them," Grube said. "My phi
losophy was to look at the schools independent of the golf
programs and figure out where I would be happiest."
Give the recruiting assist to some well-placed Cardinal
alumni. Grube's parents, John and Ann, are both Stanford
graduates, as is his sister Katie, a lacrosse player and mem
ber of the Class of 2004.
Last but not least, Stanford junior Kyle Gentry played
with Grube for two years at the Robert Louis Stevenson
School in Carmel, Calif. No pressure.
"Like my dad, Kyle said i want you to do what's best
for you,"' Grube said. "Once I said I was going to Stan-

Freshman Rob Grube leads the Cardinal with a 72.3 stroke average and was runner-up at last weekend's U.S. Intercolle
giate. He will look to lead Stanford in the Pacific-10 Conference Championship, which begins Monday.
