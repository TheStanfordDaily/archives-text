# Grube makes it look easy

### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
To answer your question, no — uiit's not this easy.
Maneuvering a golf ball around some of the most pun
ishing courses in the country, from the wind and rain of Ore
gon to the greens of California's Pasatiempo Golf Club.
Fighting the finest young players in the land from tee to
green on the weekends while fighting the onset of sleep in I-
Hum lecture during the week. Placing a storied Stanford
golf program squarely on your back when you're already
toting around a full academic load and a backpack jammed
with the densest reading material this side of Webster.
Let's just say it puts winning that $10 Nassau at the club
last weekend to shame.
But watch Rob Grube and you're bound to think doing
all that is as easy as he makes it seem.
"[Grube] is a person I wish I could have recruited," first
year coach Conrad Ray said. "I'm lucky to have him."
Lucky indeed. With a junior resume that included an
American Junior Golf Association All-American honor, a
runner-up finish in the Illinois State Amateur Champi
onship and a victory at the California State NorCal Cham
pionship, Grube was not short on options for college.

"In your junior year [of high school], coaches can send
you official recruiting letters, so you get a mess of letters
from every university, some you didn't even know existed,"
Grube said. "You kind of open them and look through
them and narrow down your choices and go on official vis
its."
Eventually, the field thinned to three contenders and a
battle between East and West: Stanford vs. the traditional
North Carolina golf powers of Duke and Wake Forest.
"I tried to spend my time at Duke and Wake because I
didn't know anything about them," Grube said. "My phi
losophy was to look at the schools independent of the golf
programs and figure out where I would be happiest."
Give the recruiting assist to some well-placed Cardinal
alumni. Grube's parents, John and Ann, are both Stanford
graduates, as is his sister Katie, a lacrosse player and mem
ber of the Class of 2004.
Last but not least, Stanford junior Kyle Gentry played
with Grube for two years at the Robert Louis Stevenson
School in Carmel, Calif. No pressure.
"Like my dad, Kyle said i want you to do what's best
for you,"' Grube said. "Once I said I was going to Stan-

giate. He will look to lead Stanford in the Pacific-10 Conference Championship, which begins Monday.
lord, I told my dad, and he said
'Yes!', and they were really excit
ed. They were good in terms of let
ting me decide on my own, hut they
definitely wanted me to come
here."
Ray, who has occupied the
coach's office only marginally
longer than Grube has his Donner
dorm room, says that his talented
freshman is still "a ways off" from
reaching his potential.
That's a little hard to believe
when Grube was assaulting pin
placements that had other players
breaking clubs in frustration at last
weekend's U.S. Intercollegiate.
Yet, sophomore Zack Miller,
who also found instant success in his
rookie campaign, said a constant de
sire for improvement is what his
teammate will need if he wants to
continue on his current path.
"It's a great feeling to come onto
the college scene and have a lot of suc
cess," Miller said. "One of the hardest
parts is to try to continue to work hard
even when things are going great. It's
easy to take things for granted. Al
ways strive to get better, because now
that you have a great year under your
belt, guys out there are now seeing you
as the one to beat."
No problem there.
How did Grube celebrate a run
ner-up finish at Stanford's most re
cent event and his best performance
as a collegian? He called up his high

school swing doctor for some quick
help with a troubled putter that had
likely cost him a chance at his first
tournament victory.
"It's an individual sport," Grube
said. "To improve the team, you
have to improve yourself."
With a team-leading stroke av
erage of 72.3, the lowest fora Stan
ford freshman since a performance
by a guy named Tiger in 1995,
Grube is certainly holding up his
end of the deal. But this individual
sport also involves four other play
ers from week to week whose per
formances he can't control. Or so
you might think.
"Rob is a great leader," sopho
more Matt Savage said. "[He's
someone] who pushes and encour
ages his teammates to be the best."
"1 can't say enough about Rob,"
Ray said. "Right now he's leading
more by example than anything.
That really speaks volumes among
the guys, too. That's really what
they look at when they ask them
selves 'Who should we follow?' or
Who's leading the charge for us?"'
When the Cardinal begin post
season play on Monday at the Pacif
ic* 10 Conference Championship,
there will be no guarantees. Seeing
Grube in the lineup and pushing to
ward the top of the leaderboard,
however, may be as close as it gets.
With a solid showing, Stanford
will advance to the NCAA Western
Regional on May 19 at the Stanford
Golf Course.
If Grube does in front of the
home crowd what he's been doing
all year long, just try to remember:

No problem there.
How did Grube celebrate a run
ner-up finish at Stanford's most re
cent event and his best performance
as a collegian? He called up his high

school swing doctor for some quick
help with a troubled putter that had
likely cost him a chance at his first
tournament victory.
"It's an individual sport," Grube
said. "To improve the team, you
have to improve yourself."
With a team-leading stroke av
erage of 72.3, the lowest fora Stan
ford freshman since a performance
by a guy named Tiger in 1995,
Grube is certainly holding up his
end of the deal. But this individual
sport also involves four other play
ers from week to week whose per
formances he can't control. Or so
you might think.
"Rob is a great leader," sopho
more Matt Savage said. "[He's
someone] who pushes and encour
ages his teammates to be the best."
"1 can't say enough about Rob,"
Ray said. "Right now he's leading
more by example than anything.
That really speaks volumes among
the guys, too. That's really what
they look at when they ask them
selves 'Who should we follow?' or
Who's leading the charge for us?"'
When the Cardinal begin post
season play on Monday at the Pacif
ic* 10 Conference Championship,
there will be no guarantees. Seeing
Grube in the lineup and pushing to
ward the top of the leaderboard,
however, may be as close as it gets.
With a solid showing, Stanford
will advance to the NCAA Western
Regional on May 19 at the Stanford
Golf Course.
If Grube does in front of the
home crowd what he's been doing
all year long, just try to remember:
It's not this easy.
To answer your question, no — uiit's not this easy.
Maneuvering a golf ball around some of the most pun
ishing courses in the country, from the wind and rain of Ore
gon to the greens of California's Pasatiempo Golf Club.
Fighting the finest young players in the land from tee to
green on the weekends while fighting the onset of sleep in I-
Hum lecture during the week. Placing a storied Stanford
golf program squarely on your back when you're already
toting around a full academic load and a backpack jammed
with the densest reading material this side of Webster.
Let's just say it puts winning that $10 Nassau at the club
last weekend to shame.
But watch Rob Grube and you're bound to think doing
all that is as easy as he makes it seem.
"[Grube] is a person I wish I could have recruited," first
year coach Conrad Ray said. "I'm lucky to have him."
Lucky indeed. With a junior resume that included an
American Junior Golf Association All-American honor, a
runner-up finish in the Illinois State Amateur Champi
onship and a victory at the California State NorCal Cham
pionship, Grube was not short on options for college.

"In your junior year [of high school], coaches can send
you official recruiting letters, so you get a mess of letters
from every university, some you didn't even know existed,"
Grube said. "You kind of open them and look through
them and narrow down your choices and go on official vis
its."
Eventually, the field thinned to three contenders and a
battle between East and West: Stanford vs. the traditional
North Carolina golf powers of Duke and Wake Forest.
"I tried to spend my time at Duke and Wake because I
didn't know anything about them," Grube said. "My phi
losophy was to look at the schools independent of the golf
programs and figure out where I would be happiest."
Give the recruiting assist to some well-placed Cardinal
alumni. Grube's parents, John and Ann, are both Stanford
graduates, as is his sister Katie, a lacrosse player and mem
ber of the Class of 2004.
Last but not least, Stanford junior Kyle Gentry played
with Grube for two years at the Robert Louis Stevenson
School in Carmel, Calif. No pressure.
"Like my dad, Kyle said i want you to do what's best
for you,"' Grube said. "Once I said I was going to Stan-

Freshman Rob Grube leads the Cardinal with a 72.3 stroke average and was runner-up at last weekend's U.S. Intercolle
giate. He will look to lead Stanford in the Pacific-10 Conference Championship, which begins Monday.
lord, I told my dad, and he said
'Yes!', and they were really excit
ed. They were good in terms of let
ting me decide on my own, hut they
definitely wanted me to come
here."
Ray, who has occupied the
coach's office only marginally
longer than Grube has his Donner
dorm room, says that his talented
freshman is still "a ways off" from
reaching his potential.
That's a little hard to believe
when Grube was assaulting pin
placements that had other players
breaking clubs in frustration at last
weekend's U.S. Intercollegiate.
Yet, sophomore Zack Miller,
who also found instant success in his
rookie campaign, said a constant de
sire for improvement is what his
teammate will need if he wants to
continue on his current path.
"It's a great feeling to come onto
the college scene and have a lot of suc
cess," Miller said. "One of the hardest
parts is to try to continue to work hard
even when things are going great. It's
easy to take things for granted. Al
ways strive to get better, because now
that you have a great year under your
belt, guys out there are now seeing you
as the one to beat."
