A 54-year-old woman was found dead
and decomposing Tuesday in a car parked
on El Camino Real near Stanford's athletic
fields and across the street from Palo Alto
High School.
Although the death is still under investi
gation by the Santa Clara County Coroner,
foul play has been ruled out.
"There did not appear to be anything
suspicious," said Palo Alto Police Lt. Doug
Keith in an interview with The Daily. "It is
premature to say that the death was due to
natural causes, but there were no signs of a
forced struggle and nothing to indicate it
was a crime scene."
The woman may have been in the car for
up to four days, left unnoticed due to a sun
shade covering the windshield. She was fi
nally found by a man who came across her
while looking at used cars for sale parked
nearby.
The victim's name has yet to be released.
"We're investigating it as an unattended
death." Keith said. "It is being classified as a
coroner's case, and the coroner will perform
an autopsy to figure out the actual cause of
death."
