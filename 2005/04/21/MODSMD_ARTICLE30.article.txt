### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
It is the end of an era for Stanford women's swim
ming. After 28 years of coaching and winning 12 na
tional championships, Richard Quick has decided that
the time has come for him to retire as head coach, the
athletic department announced Tuesday.
Though it was a difficult decision for him to make,
Quick said he is confident that he is doing it for the
best possible reasons.
"I have two major reasons," he explained in an in
terview with The Daily. "One of them is named Blake
— he's my grandson and he's 13 years old. And my
other reason is Emily — she's my granddaughter and
she is 10 years old."
Quick's family lives in Texas and he plans to spend
his retirement close to them.
"If I could have somehow talked them into not con
tinuing to grow up, I would have stayed coaching
here," Quick said. "I love Stanford, I love the student
athletes I get to work with and I love everything about
the athletic department, the athletic director and all
the wonderful coaches on the staff. There just isn't a
better place in the world to work. And I am still en
thusiastic about coaching and being here. But my
grandkids just won't cooperate. They keep growing
up."
The decision to retire wasn't spur of the moment
for the 62-year-old Quick.
"I have actually been thinking about it for the last
four or five years," he said. "It just got to be a time
where, if I did this fora year or two or three more, pret
ty soon my grandkids are gone and I just didn't want to
miss them."
In the 17 years since Quick arrived on the Farm
from the University of Texas, he has led the team to
seven national championships, including five in a row
between 1992 and 1996. The team has won the Pacific
-10 Conference crown 14 times and amassed a 123-10
record during his tenure. He has been Pac-10 Coach of
the Year four times and NCAA Coach of the Year
twice, in addition to three times when he was at Texas.
He put together five straight national titles with the
Longhorns, and then won a sixth consecutive champi
onship in his first year with the Cardinal. Before
coaching at Texas, he worked at Auburn, building the
foundation fora program that had claimed three na
tional crowns in a row before finishing second this
year.
Quick has made his mark beyond the collegiate
scene, coaching American athletes to international
success. Over the years he has coached at the World
Championships, the Goodwill Games* the Pan Pacific
Games, the World University Games and the Pan-
American Games. He has been a coach at every
Olympic Games dating back to 1984, three times as
head coach and three times as an assistant. In his three
stints as head coach, Americans brought home 47
medals.
In addition to his work with the entire national
team. Quick has also worked privately with some of
the top swimmers in the nation, including former Stan-
