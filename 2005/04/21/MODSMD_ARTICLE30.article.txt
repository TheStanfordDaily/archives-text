# Quick retires after 28 years
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
It is the end of an era for Stanford women's swim
ming. After 28 years of coaching and winning 12 na
tional championships, Richard Quick has decided that
the time has come for him to retire as head coach, the
athletic department announced Tuesday.
Though it was a difficult decision for him to make,
Quick said he is confident that he is doing it for the
best possible reasons.
"I have two major reasons," he explained in an in
terview with The Daily. "One of them is named Blake
— he's my grandson and he's 13 years old. And my
other reason is Emily — she's my granddaughter and
she is 10 years old."
Quick's family lives in Texas and he plans to spend
his retirement close to them.
"If I could have somehow talked them into not con
tinuing to grow up, I would have stayed coaching
here," Quick said. "I love Stanford, I love the student
athletes I get to work with and I love everything about
the athletic department, the athletic director and all
the wonderful coaches on the staff. There just isn't a
better place in the world to work. And I am still en
thusiastic about coaching and being here. But my
grandkids just won't cooperate. They keep growing
up."
The decision to retire wasn't spur of the moment
for the 62-year-old Quick.
"I have actually been thinking about it for the last
four or five years," he said. "It just got to be a time
where, if I did this fora year or two or three more, pret
ty soon my grandkids are gone and I just didn't want to
miss them."
In the 17 years since Quick arrived on the Farm
from the University of Texas, he has led the team to
seven national championships, including five in a row
between 1992 and 1996. The team has won the Pacific
-10 Conference crown 14 times and amassed a 123-10
record during his tenure. He has been Pac-10 Coach of
the Year four times and NCAA Coach of the Year
twice, in addition to three times when he was at Texas.
He put together five straight national titles with the
Longhorns, and then won a sixth consecutive champi
onship in his first year with the Cardinal. Before
coaching at Texas, he worked at Auburn, building the
foundation fora program that had claimed three na
tional crowns in a row before finishing second this
year.
Quick has made his mark beyond the collegiate
scene, coaching American athletes to international
success. Over the years he has coached at the World
Championships, the Goodwill Games* the Pan Pacific
Games, the World University Games and the Pan-
American Games. He has been a coach at every
Olympic Games dating back to 1984, three times as
head coach and three times as an assistant. In his three
stints as head coach, Americans brought home 47
medals.
In addition to his work with the entire national
team. Quick has also worked privately with some of
the top swimmers in the nation, including former Stan-
ford stars Jenny Thompson, Dara
Torres, Misty Hyman and Tara
Kirk. Thompson is the most deco
rated Olympian in American histo
ry with 12 medals, and Torres won
five medals at the Sydney Olympics
in 2000.
Kirk, who finished her eligibility
at Stanford last year, continues to
work with Quick and regularly
trains with this year's team. She
credits Quick with much of the suc
cess that she and other Stanford
swimmers have experienced over
the years.
"He has recruited great athletes
and he has coached them to suc
cess," she said. "1 think that he is the
majority of Stanford women's
swimming. Richard is really great at
encouraging swimmers to have big
dreams."
Though it will be hard to lose
such an integral part of the Stanford
program, the team understands and
supports his decision.
"A lot of us are sad that he is
leaving, but we realize that family is
an important part of someone's
life," said junior Dana Kirk, Tara's
sister and one of three Olympians
on this year's roster. "All of us hope
to be moms someday and we under
stand that family should be the most
important thing in your life. So we
are happy for him that he is going to
be able to spend more time with his
grandchildren."
Although retiring from coaching.
Quick is not leaving swimming be
hind entirely. He plans to stay in
volved in USA Swimming, the na
tional governing body of the sport,
and run clinics around the country.
"And hopefully Stanford may
ask me to give them some advice on
things every once in a while," he
said. Quick and Athletic Director
Ted Leland have discussed this pos
sibility and it seems likely that
Quick will be a regular consultant
for the team.
No candidates fora new head
coach have been announced, but
"there will be a lot of wonderful
coaches applying for this position

because it is a wonderful position,"
Quick said. "We are in the process
of looking at some wonderful
coaches right now."
When a new coach has been
hired, Quick will help to implement
his successor's program, staying
with the team through the World
Championships at the end of the
summer before bowing out in
September.
The athletes who have trained
and learned from Quick do not hes
itate to praise their coach and say
they are saddened by news of his de
parture.
"I would say that there is no pos
sible way that any team can be suc
cessful without a great coach, and
the Stanford women are the most
successful women's program ever,"
Dana Kirk said. "He is obviously
the best coach in women's college
swimming and it's really sad that he
is leaving. A lot of my success is due
to some of the things that he has
brought out of me, like believing in
me, believing in all the swimmers.
And that is one thing that no one
does as well as Richard, making you
believe in yourself."
Quick's success as a coach is re
flected in the success of the athletes
he works with, but, to them, he is
more than just a coach.
"The things he has taught us are
not just lessons for swimming,"
Dana Kirk said. "They are lessons
for life."
Long after he has left the Farm,
Quick's legacy will live on in the
swimming world, but he would be
happy just to know that he has made
some small impact on his swimmers.
"My hope would be that they had
a wonderful experience with Stan
ford and Stanford women's swim
ming, and that I was a small part of
that and that we had some fun to
gether reaching for really high
goals," he said.
For the hundreds of Stanford
swimmers who have learned from
Quick through the years, he has
played more than just a small part.
"We're sad that he is leaving us
because, in every swimming rela
tionship, your coach is like your
dad," Dana Kirk said, holding back
tears. "He is definitely like a parent.
It's going to be hard to see him leave
but we understand."
