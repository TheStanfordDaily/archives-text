# Softball splits double-header against Hornets
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
It was a long day yesterday for both No. 7
Stanford and Sacramento State. The teams
took the field at 2 p.m. for the first game of
their non-conference doubleheader and
didn't shed their uniforms until more than
five hours later. As if the twin bill wasn't al
ready long enough, the Cardinal and Hor
nets battled for 11 innings — and a season
long three hours and 10 minutes for both
squads — in the first game, with the Hornets
besting Stanford. 3-2. The Cardinal leveled

the upset with a 16-1 five-inning rout in game
two.
"We came out in the first game a little
sluggish and they scored two runs," head
coach John Rittman said. "It seemed like
every break was going their way and we just
could not get a break. Their two pitchers did
a good job of shutting us down and their third
baseman made two outstanding plays. It was
like every ball we hit was right at them and
every ball they hit found a hole. It was frus
trating, but we came back in the second game
and got it done."
With 14 hits in the first game, Stanford

was getting at least half of its job done, but it
was unable to push across the critical run.
The Cardinal, who stranded 15 runners, had
a chance to win in the seventh with runners at
the corners and nobody out. But Nikki Cin
quel retired the next three batters en route to
her 13th win.
Freshman Becky McCullough pitched an
impressive 102/3 innings in the start, and de
spite allowing 14 hits, the righthander limited
the Hornets to two earned runs. She struck
out 10 but saw her record fall to 13-2.
Sacramento State took a 2-0 lead until ju
nior centerfielder Catalina Morris hit a single

to left-centerfield to tie the game.
The Hornets scored the winning run with
two outs in the 11th. With runners on first
and second, a ground ball deflected off of
freshman first baseman Erin H6we's glove
and allowed Hilary Johnson to score.
If the Cardinal had any pent-up frustra
tion, they surely got rid of it in the second tilt.
Stanford exploded for 10 runs in the first in
ning and four more in the second. The Cardi
nal hit six home runs in the game.
"After coming up short in the first game.
we needed to turn it around in min
utes," said junior shortstop Lauren
Lappin, who homered in her first at
bat. "But we have the capability to
do that and we difl it successfully. It
was a real test of the character and
intensity of the team, and we came
through."
Junior Laura Severson (13-4)
picked up the win in the circle, going
four innings and allowing one run on
one hit. Freshman Lauren Nydam
pitched the final frame in relief.
Morris went yard twice and was
one of six Cardinal who had a multi
hit game.

Third baseman Michelle Smith,
who earned Pacific-10 Conference
Player of the Week honors for her 10-
RBI effort last weekend, also hit a
home run. Dinger No. 16 puts the
freshman in sole possession of first
place for Stanford's single-season
home run record.
The long day at the plate and in the
diamond probably won't rough up
the Cardinal much for this weekend's
matchups with California. The
women are used to facing such task
ing days.
"When we were all younger that
was what you did," Lappin said. "We
haven't done it in a while, so our bod
ies aren't used to it, but we know what
it feels like."
