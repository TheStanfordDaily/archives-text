# Olympians lead men's crew team
## 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The saying goes "all roads lead but for
Stanford oarsmen Jamie Schroeder and Adam Kreek
the road led to another, equally storied city in the
Mediterranean.
Last summer, they represented their native lands at
the Summer Olympic Games in Athens. Schroeder, a
senior from Wilmette, 111., sat in the two-seat of the
United States' coxless four. Kreek, a junior from Lon
don, Ontario, rowed in the five-seat of the Canadian
eight.
Unfortunately, neither boat saw the results it had
hoped for entering the Games. Favored to take first in
the men's eight event, Kreek and his boatmates posted
a time of 5:20:46 down the two-kilometer course in the
first heat of competition. That time shattered the previ
ous Olympic record of 5:23:23, but it was the Americans
who took the heat with a 5:19:85.
The Canadians were dealt a cruel hand of fate when
stroke Jeff Powell suffered a pulled pectoral muscle in
the subsequent repechage heat. Competing at less than
full strength in the final, the Canadians struggled to a
fifth-place finish.
"The edge just sort of came off for the final," Kreek
said. "We went out in the final and at about the thou
sand-meter mark we were about a half-boat down to
the Americans. Nobody expected to be that far down,
and the boat just sort of exploded."
Schroeder and his three boatmates made it to the
men's four Final B event, where they took fourth. De
spite returning home without a medal, Schroeder said
the experience was thrilling.

Senior Jamie Schroeder (second from left) rowed for the U.S. last summer in Athens. Though he returned without a medal, he said it was the best year of his life.
"It was the best year of my life,
no question," he said.
A back injury in May almost pre
vented Schroeder from making the
Olympic v.|uad. But even in such a
discouraging situation, he managed
to find a silver lining.
"I was really distraught over the
fact that I probably wasn't going to
make the team and that I'd taken a
whole year to do nothing,"
Schroeder said. "But then I realized
how incredibly awesome it was that
I had been able to be outside of the
normal, everyday thing."
Despite losing nearly five weeks
of training due to his injury,
Schroeder returned from his rehab
program to put forth a strong show
ing in his pair time trials, which
earned him a spot in the U.S. four.
What makes Schroeder's jour
ney to the Olympics even more im
pressive is that he only picked up
rowing four years ago.
"I was at Northwestern at the
time," Schroeder said. "My room
mate and I were lilting weights, just
trying to get in shape, and someone
said we should give rowing a try.
We ended up going down to try it
and I really liked it."
After his summer internship ar
rangements fell through, Schroeder
spent the summer rowing in New
York. There, a national team coach
advised him to transfer to a school
with a varsity rowing program.
Schroeder chose the Farm in
large part due to the bioengineering
opportunities it offered. The deci
sion allowed him not only to "reach
the next level as a rower," hut to
gain valuable experience in
biomedical imaging as well," he
said. After graduation, Schroeder
plans to continue study at Oxford.
Kreek's path to Stanford con
tained more twists than his team
mate's. He began rowing in his
hometown as a junior in high
school.
"I didn't have anything to do in
the spring, so I was looking fora
sport," Kreek said.
Upon graduation, however,
Kreek gave up rowing fora period
to work on an oil rig in northern Al
berta. Eventually, he decided that

college offered him the best chance
to explore his interest in geotechni
cal engineering. He enrolled at the
University of Victoria in British
Columbia and resumed rowing.
The national team's rowing facili
ties were also conveniently located
in Victoria.
"It was a fairly easy transition from
University of Victoria into the train
ing center squad because the coach
was really open and would let you join
in on the workouts," Kreek said. "All
you had to do was keep up."
Kreek did that and more, mak
ing the national team and helping
Canada to consecutive gold medals
at the World Championships in
2003 and 2004. He also found row
ing to be the perfect channel for his
energy.
"My mind is usually racing and
going all over the place, and I found
that once I trained myself to sit
down and focus, it was almost a
kind of relief," Kreek said. "My
mind would turn off and become al
most meditative. It's nice to be able
to be in a 7.one while training be
cause it can be really rhythmical
and invigorating."
After competition ended in
Athens, Kreek arrived on campus
as a student for the first time. In ad
dition to having fun studying and
"looking at rocks, dirt and water,"
Kreek has made an immediate con
tribution to the men's squad. But
both he and Schroeder were quick
to point out that it takes more than
two men to row an eight-man boat.
Schroeder summed it up with a
musical metaphor.
"The critical aspect of rowing is
putting in your own resources and
efforts as well as with a group," he
said. "It's like a choir — you have
to learn how to sing well yourself,
but it's really being with a group
that makes the music."
Kreek added that the program is
not short on talent.
"There are a couple of guys in the
boat who have the physiology to be
international caliber athletes, and the
other guys are just really solid univer
sity athletes," he said. "It's really fun
rowing with these guys, because
they're like a pack of wild horses —
everyone just wants to go for it."
The Cardinal will have the op
portunity to do just that when they
take on No. 9 Oregon State and No.
2 California at Redwood Shores the
next two weekends.

a time of 5:20:46 down the two-kilometer course in the
first heat of competition. That time shattered the previ
ous Olympic record of 5:23:23, but it was the Americans
who took the heat with a 5:19:85.
The Canadians were dealt a cruel hand of fate when
stroke Jeff Powell suffered a pulled pectoral muscle in
the subsequent repechage heat. Competing at less than
full strength in the final, the Canadians struggled to a
fifth-place finish.
"The edge just sort of came off for the final," Kreek
said. "We went out in the final and at about the thou
sand-meter mark we were about a half-boat down to
the Americans. Nobody expected to be that far down,
and the boat just sort of exploded."
Schroeder and his three boatmates made it to the
men's four Final B event, where they took fourth. De
spite returning home without a medal, Schroeder said
the experience was thrilling.

Senior Jamie Schroeder (second from left) rowed for the U.S. last summer in Athens. Though he returned without a medal, he said it was the best year of his life.
"It was the best year of my life,
no question," he said.
A back injury in May almost pre
vented Schroeder from making the
Olympic v.|uad. But even in such a
discouraging situation, he managed
to find a silver lining.
"I was really distraught over the
fact that I probably wasn't going to
make the team and that I'd taken a
whole year to do nothing,"
Schroeder said. "But then I realized
how incredibly awesome it was that
I had been able to be outside of the
normal, everyday thing."
Despite losing nearly five weeks
of training due to his injury,
Schroeder returned from his rehab
program to put forth a strong show
ing in his pair time trials, which
earned him a spot in the U.S. four.
What makes Schroeder's jour
ney to the Olympics even more im
pressive is that he only picked up
rowing four years ago.
"I was at Northwestern at the
time," Schroeder said. "My room
mate and I were lilting weights, just
trying to get in shape, and someone
said we should give rowing a try.
We ended up going down to try it
and I really liked it."
After his summer internship ar
rangements fell through, Schroeder
spent the summer rowing in New
York. There, a national team coach
advised him to transfer to a school
with a varsity rowing program.
Schroeder chose the Farm in
large part due to the bioengineering
opportunities it offered. The deci
sion allowed him not only to "reach
the next level as a rower," hut to
gain valuable experience in
biomedical imaging as well," he
said. After graduation, Schroeder
plans to continue study at Oxford.
Kreek's path to Stanford con
tained more twists than his team
mate's. He began rowing in his
hometown as a junior in high
school.
"I didn't have anything to do in
the spring, so I was looking fora
sport," Kreek said.
Upon graduation, however,
Kreek gave up rowing fora period
to work on an oil rig in northern Al
berta. Eventually, he decided that

college offered him the best chance
to explore his interest in geotechni
cal engineering. He enrolled at the
University of Victoria in British
Columbia and resumed rowing.
The national team's rowing facili
ties were also conveniently located
in Victoria.
"It was a fairly easy transition from
University of Victoria into the train
ing center squad because the coach
was really open and would let you join
in on the workouts," Kreek said. "All
you had to do was keep up."
Kreek did that and more, mak
ing the national team and helping
Canada to consecutive gold medals
at the World Championships in
2003 and 2004. He also found row
ing to be the perfect channel for his
energy.
"My mind is usually racing and
going all over the place, and I found
that once I trained myself to sit
down and focus, it was almost a
kind of relief," Kreek said. "My
mind would turn off and become al
most meditative. It's nice to be able
to be in a 7.one while training be
cause it can be really rhythmical
and invigorating."
After competition ended in
Athens, Kreek arrived on campus
as a student for the first time. In ad
dition to having fun studying and
"looking at rocks, dirt and water,"
Kreek has made an immediate con
tribution to the men's squad. But
both he and Schroeder were quick
to point out that it takes more than
two men to row an eight-man boat.
Schroeder summed it up with a
musical metaphor.
"The critical aspect of rowing is
putting in your own resources and
efforts as well as with a group," he
said. "It's like a choir — you have
to learn how to sing well yourself,
but it's really being with a group
that makes the music."
Kreek added that the program is
not short on talent.
"There are a couple of guys in the
boat who have the physiology to be
international caliber athletes, and the
other guys are just really solid univer
sity athletes," he said. "It's really fun
rowing with these guys, because
they're like a pack of wild horses —
everyone just wants to go for it."
The Cardinal will have the op
portunity to do just that when they
take on No. 9 Oregon State and No.
2 California at Redwood Shores the
next two weekends.
The saying goes "all roads lead but for
Stanford oarsmen Jamie Schroeder and Adam Kreek
the road led to another, equally storied city in the
Mediterranean.
Last summer, they represented their native lands at
the Summer Olympic Games in Athens. Schroeder, a
senior from Wilmette, 111., sat in the two-seat of the
United States' coxless four. Kreek, a junior from Lon
don, Ontario, rowed in the five-seat of the Canadian
eight.
Unfortunately, neither boat saw the results it had
hoped for entering the Games. Favored to take first in
the men's eight event, Kreek and his boatmates posted
a time of 5:20:46 down the two-kilometer course in the
first heat of competition. That time shattered the previ
ous Olympic record of 5:23:23, but it was the Americans
who took the heat with a 5:19:85.
The Canadians were dealt a cruel hand of fate when
stroke Jeff Powell suffered a pulled pectoral muscle in
the subsequent repechage heat. Competing at less than
full strength in the final, the Canadians struggled to a
fifth-place finish.
"The edge just sort of came off for the final," Kreek
said. "We went out in the final and at about the thou
sand-meter mark we were about a half-boat down to
the Americans. Nobody expected to be that far down,
and the boat just sort of exploded."
Schroeder and his three boatmates made it to the
men's four Final B event, where they took fourth. De
