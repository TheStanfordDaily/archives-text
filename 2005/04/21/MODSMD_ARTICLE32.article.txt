# Olympians lead men's crew team

The saying goes "all roads lead but for
Stanford oarsmen Jamie Schroeder and Adam Kreek
the road led to another, equally storied city in the
Mediterranean.
Last summer, they represented their native lands at
the Summer Olympic Games in Athens. Schroeder, a
senior from Wilmette, 111., sat in the two-seat of the
United States' coxless four. Kreek, a junior from Lon
don, Ontario, rowed in the five-seat of the Canadian
eight.
Unfortunately, neither boat saw the results it had
hoped for entering the Games. Favored to take first in
the men's eight event, Kreek and his boatmates posted
a time of 5:20:46 down the two-kilometer course in the
first heat of competition. That time shattered the previ
ous Olympic record of 5:23:23, but it was the Americans
who took the heat with a 5:19:85.
The Canadians were dealt a cruel hand of fate when
stroke Jeff Powell suffered a pulled pectoral muscle in
the subsequent repechage heat. Competing at less than
full strength in the final, the Canadians struggled to a
fifth-place finish.
"The edge just sort of came off for the final," Kreek
said. "We went out in the final and at about the thou
sand-meter mark we were about a half-boat down to
the Americans. Nobody expected to be that far down,
and the boat just sort of exploded."
Schroeder and his three boatmates made it to the
men's four Final B event, where they took fourth. De
spite returning home without a medal, Schroeder said
the experience was thrilling.
