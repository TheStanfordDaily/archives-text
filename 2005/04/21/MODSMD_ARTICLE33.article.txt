### 
Three of the 11 Cardinal wrestlers who competed at the Uni
versity National Championships last weekend in Evanston, 111.,
left will All-America honors and an invitation to University World
Team Trials in May.
Senior Matt Gentry placed second with a 6-1 record at 163
pounds, sophomore Tanner Gardner placed fourth with a 4-2
mark at 121 pounds and freshman Scott Loescher went 6-3 at 163
to place eighth.
Gentry, the only National Champion in Stanford wrestling his
tory, won his first six matches before falling to Missouri's Matt Fell
in the final of the freestyle event. Under new freestyle rules, com
petitors wrestled in a best of three two-minute bouts format, with
scores resetting after each period. Gentry lost 8-2,4-2 to Pell.
"I was pretty happy with how I did," Gentry said. "He was a little
better in the freestyle. I had just as many takedowns as he did, but
they're not worth as much in freestyle wrestling."
There were over 1(X) entrants in the 163-pound weight class
and Stanford placed three wrestlers in the top 12. In addition to
Gentry, Loescher placed eighth at 163 and junior Ray Blake went
6-1 in the consolation draw after losing his first bout to finish 12th.
Loescher could have finished even higher, but he wrestled his
last three matches with a broken hand. He won one of those
matches and then injury defaulted to eighth place after he was as
sured of All-America honors.
Freshmen Bobby Pease and Luke Feist picked up a pair of
wins.
Stanford begins preparation for the U.S. Open to be held in Las
Vegas beginning next Friday. About 15 members of the team will
compete.
