# GSC proposes new office
## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
A plan to radically change the ad
ministration of Stanford's five gradu
ate schools has been proposed by the
Graduate Student Council Diversity
Committee to increase diversity
among both students and faculty.
Announced at last night's meeting
of the Graduate Student Council, or
GSC, the proposal suggests the cre
ation of an office of the vice provost
for graduate education, which would
include a dean of graduate policy, a
dean of graduate life and a dean of
graduate diversity.

The current administration is
"wasting a lot of resources and ener
gy," said GSC Diversity Committee
Co-Chair Alice Lincoln, a third-year
chemistry doctoral student.
At the core of the recommenda
tions is the creation of an entirely new
administrative position, the Vice
Provost of Graduate Education,
which would assume some of the re
sponsibilities of the current Dean of
Research and Graduate Education.
The GSC Diversity Committee
was created in May 2004 to address
diversity issues facing Stanford's
graduate schools, specifically the
under-representation of women and

ethnic minorities, Lincoln explained.
"I was originally concerned about
women in chemistry," Lincoln said.
"And [GSC Diversity Committee
Co-Chair] John Davis raised the issue
of minorities."
According to data from Stanford's
Web site, 36 percent of graduate stu
dents are female and 21 percent are
ethnic minorities. Comparatively, 49
percent of Stanford's undergraduate
students are female and 45 percent
are minorities, discounting 5 percent
for unspecified international stu
dents.
Lincoln said that while these
numbers are largely on par with the
national average for graduate
schools, the data are skewed because
they are simply an average of the
varying diversity levels of the
schools. Thus, the data fails to reflect
the varying diversity levels among
Stanford's graduate schools.
The University has refused to dis
close separate diversity information
for each school, citing confidentiali
ty issues, Lincoln added.
While the proposal was originally
designed to increase diversity, it ac
tually addresses the centralization of
the graduate administration as a
whole.
"(The committee! realized there
are a lot of things at the graduate
level that can be done better," Lin
coln said. "We want to get all the de
partments of the University working
together to make graduate educa
tion better."
Members of the GSC Diversity
Committee met with the dean of
every graduate school and most of
the diversity officers on campus.

They discovered that each school
has different diversity policies, and
that each dean plays a major role in
determining the priority placed on
diversity within a particular school.
The proposal is "pioneering
work," said GSC Member Tom Lee,
a third-year electrical engineering
doctoral student.
"A group of us went to a meeting
of other grad student representative
bodies across California and asked
them what they were doing about di
versity," he added. "None of them
said it was on their agenda."
GSC Chair Moriah Thomason, a
student at the School of Medicine,
said she was impressed with the com
mittee's work.
"When does a university stop and
look at its principles and standards?"
she asked at the meeting. "This
group has basically self-initiated this
movement that will have a remark
able impact."
Thomason said that the Commis
sion on Graduate Education, or
CGE, a group designed to improve
graduate education practices, will be
informed of the proposal when it
meets with the GSC Diversity Com
mittee today.
The CGE is scheduled to publish
its report in June.
"It's incredibly good timing,"

Thomason said. "The right people
will be listening, and they can have a
serious impact."
Lincoln said she is optimistic that
the committee's findings will be well
received. The GSC Diversity Com
mittee also presented its recom
mended model to University
Provost John Etchemendy, who Lin
coln said is also taking it under con
sideration.
"Everybody is really excited at
making progress on this issue," Lin
coln said. "We're all working toward
the same goals."
Chief among those goals is
putting Stanford at the head of the
pack in diversity among graduate
students and clearing any miscon
ceptions of what that diversity en
tails, the committee members
agreed.
According to Lincoln, one such
misconception is that professional
schools are notably more diverse
compared to other graduate schools.
"The common thought is that
there's not enough women in chem
istry," she said. "But chemistry has
as many women percentage-wise as
business. Until someone can sit
down and look at it University-wide,
these myths arc going to persist and
that can keep something from being
changed."

The CGE is scheduled to publish
its report in June.
"It's incredibly good timing,"

Thomason said. "The right people
will be listening, and they can have a
serious impact."
Lincoln said she is optimistic that
the committee's findings will be well
received. The GSC Diversity Com
mittee also presented its recom
mended model to University
Provost John Etchemendy, who Lin
coln said is also taking it under con
sideration.
"Everybody is really excited at
making progress on this issue," Lin
coln said. "We're all working toward
the same goals."
Chief among those goals is
putting Stanford at the head of the
pack in diversity among graduate
students and clearing any miscon
ceptions of what that diversity en
tails, the committee members
agreed.
According to Lincoln, one such
misconception is that professional
schools are notably more diverse
compared to other graduate schools.
"The common thought is that
there's not enough women in chem
istry," she said. "But chemistry has
as many women percentage-wise as
business. Until someone can sit
down and look at it University-wide,
these myths arc going to persist and
that can keep something from being
changed."
