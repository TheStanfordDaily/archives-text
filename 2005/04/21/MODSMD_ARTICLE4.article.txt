# GSC proposes new office

### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
A plan to radically change the ad
ministration of Stanford's five gradu
ate schools has been proposed by the
Graduate Student Council Diversity
Committee to increase diversity
among both students and faculty.
Announced at last night's meeting
of the Graduate Student Council, or
GSC, the proposal suggests the cre
ation of an office of the vice provost
for graduate education, which would
include a dean of graduate policy, a
dean of graduate life and a dean of
graduate diversity.

The current administration is
"wasting a lot of resources and ener
gy," said GSC Diversity Committee
Co-Chair Alice Lincoln, a third-year
chemistry doctoral student.
At the core of the recommenda
tions is the creation of an entirely new
administrative position, the Vice
Provost of Graduate Education,
which would assume some of the re
sponsibilities of the current Dean of
Research and Graduate Education.
The GSC Diversity Committee
was created in May 2004 to address
diversity issues facing Stanford's
graduate schools, specifically the
under-representation of women and

ethnic minorities, Lincoln explained.
"I was originally concerned about
women in chemistry," Lincoln said.
"And [GSC Diversity Committee
Co-Chair] John Davis raised the issue
of minorities."
According to data from Stanford's
Web site, 36 percent of graduate stu
dents are female and 21 percent are
ethnic minorities. Comparatively, 49
percent of Stanford's undergraduate
students are female and 45 percent
are minorities, discounting 5 percent
for unspecified international stu
dents.
