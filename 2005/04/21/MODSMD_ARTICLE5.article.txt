# Gay marriage debate heats up
## 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Evan Wolfson of the Freedom to
Marry Coalition and Reverend Lou
Sheldon of the Traditional Values
Coalition debated the issue of gay
marriage last night at the Law
School in front of an audience of
hundreds of students, faculty and
community members.
Moderated by KQED host Angie
Coiro, the debate covered a range of
legal, ethical, scientific and moral is
sues before opening up for ques
tions.
Sheldon affirmed a "natural"
view of marriage — that procreation
is only possible through heterosexu
ality and separate from the legal and
social issues surrounding homosexu
ality. But Wolfson attacked what he
called Sheldon's attempt to impose
religious beliefs on the legal system
and charged Sheldon with being
"anti-separation of church and
state."
Some of Sheldon's statements
drew muffled groans and jeers from
the audience, composed mostly of
law students, while Wolfson, with
whom the audience was clearly
aligned, sparked bursts of laughter

in the room with his sharp retorts.
Wolfson, who graduated from
Harvard Law School, was most re
cently named one of the Time Mag
azine's "100 Most Influential People
in the World" and was also included
in The National Law Journal's "100
most influential lawyers in America"
in 2000 for his appearance before the
U.S. Supreme Court in the Boys

Scouts of America v. James Dale
case.
Across the table and ideological
worlds apart from Wolfson sat Shel
don, a Presbyterian pastor who first
took opposition to the "homosexual
agenda" in 1972. Since then the
cause has consumed his life as the

Audience sides with Wolfson

Traditional Values Coalition has
risen to become the most prominent
anti-gay marriage organization in
America.
Wolfson opened the debate by
dismissing polls that indicate Amer
icans disapprove of gay marriage
and instead made an appeal to a dif
ferent kind of values.
"The values are simple: love,
commitment, fairness, freedom."
Wolfson said. "Ask yourself, which
position reflects these core Ameri
can values?"
Wolfson challenged the Ameri
can majority opinion and repeatedly
cited the California Supreme
Court's 194K ruling of Perez v. Lip
pold — a decision that declared
bans on interracial marriages uncon
stitutional — as a precedent to
today's debate over gay marriage.
"In 1948, 90 percent of the popu
lation was against interracial mar
riage, but California's courts were
the first to have the courage to strike
down the ban as unconstitutional,"
Wolfon said.
"Not everything should get put
up to a vote," he added. "There are
rights and there should be protec
tion for the unpopular."
Sheldon, in response, accused gay
marriage supporters of pursuing a
political agenda to "forcefully rede
fine and undermine society's most
basic and fundamental institution."
"The basic unit of society is the
family, and the family is sexually.

spiritually and culturally brought to
gether," he said. "The cornerstone
of a family is marriage, and the
essence of marriage is the consum
mation of a coupled union, a union
of husband and wife."
The two exchanged salvos of sta
tistics and scientific findings regard
ing divorce rates, psychology of chil
dren raised by same-sex couples and
even genetics.
" The lowest divorce rate in the
country is in Massachusetts," Wolf
son cited to support the state's
breakthrough gay marriage law.
"And there are no locusts descend
ing on Massachusetts."
At one point, the room erupted
into laughter when Sheldon coun
tered one of Wolfson's claims by say
ing, "That's typical liberal goobalee
gooble."
"The government has no business
telling people what sexuality they
should be, and we don't have that
right," Sheldon said. "But marriage
is a legal institution. Homosexuality
is a gender identity conflict, a social
issue — not a legal issue to be given
legal rights for."
The event was sponsored by the
American Constitution Society, or
ACS, and the Federalist Society.
"People read a lot about this
issue but rarely get an opportunity
to hear both sides directly respond
to each other," said third-year law
student and ACS president Daniel
Goldman following the debate.

"They were fresh and real per
spectives on an issue that felt tan
gible."
But not everyone in the audience
left the debate so optimistic. An au
dience member, who requested to be
anonymous, accused Sheldon during
the question-and-answer session of
endorsing anti-gay signs with the
words "hate" and "kill." Sheldon
firmly denied any association with
the signs during the session, but his
response did not appease the audi
ence member.
"I just don't understand how people
can preach so much love and yet have
so much hate," said the anonymous at
tendee after the room had been vacat
ed. "I'm just so livid, so hurl."
Law student Elliot Fladen, who
identifies himself as a "moderate
Republican who supports equal
rights," handed Wolfson the clear
victory.
"Sheldon was clearly not in his el
ement," Fladen said. "He's a
spokesman who can't wrestle in an
intellectual forum with a Harvard
trained lawyer."
He added that since most of the
people attending the debate agree
strongly with equal rights, it seemed
hard to respect or view the issue
from the other side.
"We tend to stereotype and it's a
trap we fall into," Fladen said.
"Wolfson definitely fell into that
trap and sometimes didn't respect
Sheldon."
