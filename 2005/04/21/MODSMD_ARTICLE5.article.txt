# Gay marriage debate heats up

### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Evan Wolfson of the Freedom to
Marry Coalition and Reverend Lou
Sheldon of the Traditional Values
Coalition debated the issue of gay
marriage last night at the Law
School in front of an audience of
hundreds of students, faculty and
community members.
Moderated by KQED host Angie
Coiro, the debate covered a range of
legal, ethical, scientific and moral is

view of marriage â€” that procreation
is only possible through heterosexu
ality and separate from the legal and
social issues surrounding homosexu
ality. But Wolfson attacked what he
called Sheldon's attempt to impose
religious beliefs on the legal system
and charged Sheldon with being
"anti-separation of church and
state."
Some of Sheldon's statements
drew muffled groans and jeers from
the audience, composed mostly of
law students, while Wolfson, with
whom the audience was clearly
aligned, sparked bursts of laughter

in the room with his sharp retorts.
Wolfson, who graduated from
Harvard Law School, was most re
cently named one of the Time Mag
azine's "100 Most Influential People
in the World" and was also included
in The National Law Journal's "100
most influential lawyers in America"
in 2000 for his appearance before the
U.S. Supreme Court in the Boys

Scouts of America v. James Dale
case.
Across the table and ideological
worlds apart from Wolfson sat Shel
don, a Presbyterian pastor who first
took opposition to the "homosexual
agenda" in 1972. Since then the
cause has consumed his life as the
