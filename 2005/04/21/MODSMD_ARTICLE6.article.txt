# YWCA 24-hour sexual assault center opens at Vaden clinic
## 
### JESSICA HANLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The YWCA Sexual Assault Center — slated to open
on May 2 at Vaden Student Health Center — will offer
services to victims of sexual assault, stalking, and do
mestic and dating violence. It will be open 24 hours a day
to all members of the Stanford community, including
spouses and summer residents.
"The YWCA has a long and excellent track record in
assisting county residents who have experienced a sexu
al assault," said Ira Friedman, director of Vaden. "I am
very pleased that these excellent services will be much

more accessible to members of the campus communi
ty."
The need to improve Stanford's existing sexual as
sault resources became clear when several students and
victims complained about the lack of communication
between support services, including the police and med
ical and housing services. Some victims said they had to
repeat their stories of assault several times, and others
said they didn't even know where to turn.
"We're hoping that this new service will provide a
comprehensive and coordinated response system that
will make [it] easier for the sur
vivor to report the incident and re
ceive support and assistance
throughout the process," said Car
ole Pertofsky, director of health
promotion services at Vaden and
co-chair of the University's new
advisory committee on sexual as
sault issues. "The [YWCA] will
provide an advocate who will be
assigned to the case through the
entire process."
This advocate will facilitate a vic
tim's access to medical, psychologi
cal, emotional, spiritual and legal
services. As a central resource, the
advocate will also relieve the victim

of the task of seeking help from var
ious sources and will accompany vic
tims to any medical evidence exams,
which they must undergo within
three days following an assault.
The new center will not replace
any existing sexual assault services,
though University programming
will emphasize it as victims' primary
resource. Sexual assault victims of
any gender, religion or sexual orien
tation can consult the center for
help, either in person or via a 24-
hour telephone hotline.
Because it is a nonprofit organi
zation, the YWCA center will be
able to offer students a heightened
level of confidentiality, Pertofsky
added, whereas University officials
are legally bound to report certain
information.
Many students said they feel the

new sexual assault center will be a
valuable addition to Stanford's ex
isting resources.
"I think the new center is a great
idea, especially if it helps victims
feel supported and decreases their
burden of seeking help," junior
Nicole Preston said.
The addition of the YWCA Sex
ual Assault Center will be formally
presented to students tonight at the
reception for the Take Back the
Night march — an annual interna
tional rally to raise awareness about
violence against women, children
and families.
The reception begins at 7 p.m. at
the Women's Community Center
and will welcome the new YWCA
staff to Stanford. Both the march
and reception are co-sponsored by
Vaden and the Women's Center.
