## Naimark takes helm at OSP 
### SAM FLOAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Norman Naimark, professor of
Eastern European Studies and senior
fellow at the Hoover Institution, has
been named the new director for the
Overseas Studies Program, or OSP,
and will begin his term on Sept. 1. He
will replace Amos Nur, professor of
earth sciences, who has headed OSP
for the past five years.
As director, Naimark will be re
sponsible for all of Stanford's overseas
campuses and programs.
More than 500 students participate
in overseas programs at Stanford each
academic year, and Naimark said that
he will do whatever he can to make it
possible for more students to take ad
vantage of these opportunities. Study-

ing abroad instills students with a
new outlook on life, particularly in
the emerging global community, he
said.
"The generalizations about the
world getting smaller and our lives
becoming more internationalized
underemphasize, if anything, the
ways in which changes around the
globe influence everything we do,"
Naimark said.
"Globalization is much more than
Americanization. Spending signifi
cant time abroad in a foreign culture

will help build the sense among our
students of being world citizens."
While Naimark said that he needs
to get better acquainted with OSP's
operations before he can talk about
opening new centers abroad, he be
lieves that the existing programs are
very successful and have undergone
an exciting period of expansion and
enrichment.
Once he starts his job in the fall.
Naimark said he would be thrilled to
talk to students and encourage their
interest in OSP.

"I think it is essential that our stu
dents engage in at least some of their
education abroad," he added.
Also a senior fellow at the Insti
tute for International Studies,
Naimark brings a great deal of ex
perience to the OSP. During his ju
nior year at Stanford 40 years ago,
he studied at OSP center in Beu
telsbach, Germany. He has also
served as the director for the Stan
ford program in Krakow, Poland,
and has taught at the center in
Moscow.
