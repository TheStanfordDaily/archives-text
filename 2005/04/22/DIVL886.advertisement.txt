Statement regardi 11 g the election o I Pope
Benedict XVI
I have lieon disheartened to lioar many media reports tlial seem ready to condemn and
dismiss I lis II oliness, Pope Benedict XVI, almost within moments of his election.
As L alholics, we believe that none other than the I loly Spirit of God made this choice,
working through the College of Cardinals.
bach pope, lilce each person, is a unique tji ft of C jod who equips each with all that is
necessary lo do what is needed (cI. hphesians 4: 1 2). Joseph Ratzinger's most manifest
gills to date have heen his intelligence and zeal, and while it is true that detractors gave
him un flatte ring nicknames lilce "Cods Rottweiler when he served as the Church's
chief spokesman ol doctrinal orthodoxy, his election lo succeed his holovod friend,
John Paul 11, is a now moment ol grace in his life and the life of the world.
I lis I lohness has a deep and profound love for Jesus L hrist and the Church. I Everyone
who has met him in person (I know several individuals who have) seems to agree that
he is a humhle, soil-spoken, and even a charming man. hffectivo leaders change their
approach to meet the challenges sot before them. I expect Pope Benedict's love and
zeal lo ho revealed much differently now than in the past to reflect the new and more
complex responsibilities ho must embrace. And throughout the days to come,
God will provide in ways thai neither the Pontifl nor wo expect!
Conventional wisdom says that a now pope s choice ol name says much about how he
boos himself in the role of I niversal Shepherd. I he last pope named Benedict had to
deal with World War I and a Catholic flock at war with itself; he literally spent his life
being a peacemaker and a healer, both inside and outside the L hurch. May tl lis
Benedict strive to ho the blessing his name implies, pouring himself out, just as Jesus
did, for the lilo of the world (of. John 6:51).
