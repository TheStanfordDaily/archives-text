# Rough Pac-10 ride continues for Card
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
No one ever expects the Pacific-10
Conference season to be easy, but even
the No. 24 Cardinal baseball squad
didn't expect it to be this hard.
Three weeks into the conference
schedule, Stanford (21-14) is 4-5 in
league play, having lost a series to No. 9
Oregon State and been the victim of a
No. 21 Arizona State sweep. Now,
perched just two spots from toppling out
of the national rankings, the Cardinal's
road to redemption goes through anoth
er struggling conference foe-the hungry
Washington Cougars, who share sixth
place in the Pac-10 with Stanford.
Like Stanford, Washington was ex
pected to be one of the traditionally
strong teams that would dominate the
Pac-10 in 2005. However, after a 4-7 sea
son start, the Huskies took some time to
regain their groove and the conference
schedule hit the adjusting squad hard-
Washington has lost two of its three Pac
-10 series to No. 25 Southern California
and No. 6 Arizona.
"There's no question that the confer
ence seems more challenging than

usual," junior
hurler Jeff
Gilmore said.
"All of a sudden

State is competi
tive, USC is im
proved, Cal is

gon State has

cally. There
have been a few
surprises and
the traditionally
good programs
are still good."
This week
end's three
game series will
doubtlessly be a
battle for life in
the Pac-10
standings, and
the teams are so
evenly matched
that prediction-

making is futile. The Cardinal and
Huskies rank fifth and sixth in the league
in hitting, respectively, and fourth and
third in pitching, respectively.
Stanford and Washington each
boast a power-hitting duo of upper
classmen that bears a large chunk of the
responsibility for their team's offensive
output. The Cardinal lineup, of course,
is anchored by juniors Jed Lowrie and
John Mayberry, Jr., who are both hit
ting .326 and have a combined 16
homeruns this season. The Huskies'
key pair of players is senior Taylor
Johnson and junior Brent Lillibridge,
who are batting at .328 and .333, re
spectively with a combined 14 homers.
All four of those players rank among
the top eight in the Pac-10 in RBI.
The squads' pitching staffs are equal
ly comparable, as the Huskies pitchers
have a 4.05 ERA, with the Cardinal not
far behind at 4.17. Head coach Mark
Marquess has not announced his starting
pitchers for the weekend, but tonight's
contest will likely pit a seasoned veteran
(Cardinal junior Mark Romanczuk)
against a sophomore phenom (2004 Pac
-10 Pitcher of the Year Tim Lincecum).
Due to the Huskies' rocky start,
Lincecum already has one more loss
than he did all of last season. But he still
has the best opponent batting average in
the league (.197) and ranks third in the
conference in strikeouts (80 in 67 1/3 in
nings). And when the Huskies took two
of three from the Cardinal in Washing
ton last season, Lincecum was the win
ning pitcher on both occasions, picking
up the victory in relief on Friday night
and then another in his Sunday start.
Washington's second and third
starters — Kyle Parker and Matt Kasser
— are less frightening than their sopho
more counterpart. Opponents are hit
ting nearly .300 on Kasser's watch, while
Parker has given up more extra-base hits
than any other Washington pitcher.
Rotation regular Gilmore is likely to
take the mound on Saturday, while
sophomore Matt Leva could get the nod
for Sunday, as he has for the past two
weekends.
Gametime for today's contest is 6
p.m. at Sunken Diamond and 1 p.m. is
the slatedstart time for tomorrow and
Sunday's games.
