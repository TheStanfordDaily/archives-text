## Religious groups plan to meet 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The University is organizing a meeting between sever
al student groups on campus in the wake of the controver
sy surrounding Hillel at Stanford's co-sponsorship of an
event entitled "The Trouble with Islam" on Monday.
After the talk, one student published an Op-Ed criticizing
the event, and in today's Daily, the executive director of
Hillel responded.
Dean of Religious Life Scotty McLennan said that he has
been wary about the role the media has played in the contro
versy.
"Part of respectful dialogue is not playing things out in
the press and in Op-Eds," he said. "They should be sitting
down and talking to each other."
The University Offices of Religious Life and Student
Activities are hosting the private meeting, and according
to Ibrahim Al-Mojel. president of the Islamic Society of
Stanford University, or ISSU, invitations have been sent
to all the groups that co-sponsored Monday's speaker
event featuring Irshad Manji, author of "The Trouble
with Islam Today: A Muslim's Call for Reform in Her
Faith."
In addition to Hillel, the co-sponsors were the Institute for
Research on Women and Gender; the Jewish Community
Relations Council; the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgen
der Community Resources Center; the Women's Center; the
Stanford Jewish American Alliance; and Chabad at Stanford.
McLennan confirmed that there would be a meeting, al
though he did not wish to speak at length before it takes place.

"My perspective is one of trying to make sure that we have
conditions of mutual respect between Stanford Associated
Religions groups, and that the Office of Religious Life is in
cluded when speakers come to campus that raise issues that
effect our constituent organizations," McLennan said.
Stanford Associated Religions, or SAR, is a group of
campus religious organizations, including Hillel and
ISSU.
On Wednesday, McClennan met privately with Al-Mojel,
a third-year graduate student in management science and en
gineering, to discuss how to uphold SAR's code of conduct.
McLennan is also scheduled to sit down individually with
a representative from Hillel.
The SAR Web site states that member groups have
pledged to "[treat] with respect the ministries [and the reli
gious traditions] of others."
"For me, that means to make sure there is good dialogue
between groups, especially when there are controversial
speakers coming to campus," McLennan said.
Al-Mojel said he was not notified that Manji was com
ing to speak until less than a week before the event.
McLennan also agreed that they should have provided
earlier notice.
Adina Danzig, executive director of Hillel, defended
Manji's talk. In an interview with The Daily, she also said that
"there should be some kind of courtesy or protocol to notify
when speakers come to campus who criticize other religions."
Al-Mojel said that he was particularly surprised by Hil
lel's decision not to notify in much advance his group of
