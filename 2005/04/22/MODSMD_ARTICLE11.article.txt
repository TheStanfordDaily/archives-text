# Magazine aims to capture the college spirit
## 
### ANDREW BURMON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A new magazine designed to reflect the interests and is
sues of college students is in the works. A project hatched
between University of South Carolina graduate Tripp
Wulbern and his friend, former model Michael Malyerck,
College Magazine — which already exists online — will
hit news stands in January of next year.
The publication will be similar in format to magazines
like Maxim and HFM, though James Phillips, the maga
zine's communications director, stressed that the "style
and humour will be entirely unique."
College might seem a blase name, but the title on the
Web site — collegemagazineonline.com — looks ex
actly like the letters on actor Jon Belushi's t-shirt in the
classic college film "Animal House." This is no coinci
dence, Wulbern said.
The online addition of the magazine does just that, in
cluding sections for sex stories and drink recipes. Titles of
the sex stories range from the relatively placid "What are
Friends for?" to the blunt "Middle of the Week Meets the
Middle of My Legs." The Web site also includes a variety
of centerfolds, as well as movie and music reviews.
Wulbern said the longer print version of the magazine
will include more serious issue-based stories, political
commentary and sports updates.
Uniquely, all stories appearing in College Magazine
will be written by student reporters.
"That is one of the ways which this magazine will be
authentic," Phillips said.
While the magazine will take a serious approach to

some topics, it will not lose sight of online edition's lewd
allure, he added.
Wulbern and Malyerck say putting together the mag
azine has been an odyssey.
"This is all we've been doiiif>," Wulbern said. "It's a
ton of work."
After preliminary research showed that a market exist
ed for the publication, the two said they hope to enjoy a
handsome return on their labor. Wulbern, who sold his bar
to work on the magazine, said major advertisers are already
lining up and everything seems to be coming together.
Several initial editions of College Magazine al
ready circulated have met enthusiastic reviews. Wul
bern and Malyerck said they hope this response is in
dicative of future success. Maybe then they'll be able
to stop working from home.
As the release date for the first full issue draws near,
the Wulbern said they are working hard with a close-knit
team to create just the right synthesis of humor, raunchi
ness and true insight to create a product that could po
tentially become a staple at colleges across the nation.
