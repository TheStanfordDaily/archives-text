# Investment reforms pitched
## SCID report encourages greater responsibility 
### NILA BALA STAFF WRITER 
For almost a year the Stanford Coalition for
Investment Disclosure, or SCID, has been push
ing for increased transparency and credibility in
the University's investing policies. This week, the
group took a step closer to its goal, releasing a de
tailed proposal for investment reforms.
"The proposal is a shift from asking the ques
tion 'Why is disclosure important?' to 'Why is
disclosure a bad thing?' " said senior Raphael
Ginsburg, who has been involved in formulat
ing the suggestions.
The proposal grew out of the resistance
SCID encountered at a public town-hall meet
ing held two weeks ago. Endorsed by the Stan
ford Community for Peace and Justince and
Students fora Sustainable Stanford, the docu
ment will be presented to the University's Ad
visory Panel on Investment Responsibility, or
APIR, at a meeting on April 25. APIR is the
committee that manages student input on en
dowment issues.
Ginsburg said he believes this proposal dif
fers from SCID's past arguments for disclosure.
"APIR has not been very receptive to disclo
sure, so this proposal is a more concrete step,"
he said. "Realistically, reforms are better re
ceived than complete disclosure. We have both
the ASSU's support and a petition to support
reforms. Ultimately, the proposal is a shift to
focus on reforms that the panel would be more
receptive to."
Included in the list of reforms is the forma
tion of a Web site that would allow students
and members of the Stanford community to
easily access the Statement on Investment
Disclosure and other relevant documents.
SCID leaders also said they want the Univer
sity to release their proxy voting guidelines so
that the public can gain a better understanding
of its corporate policies.

"Proxy voting is a process in which all public
shareholders get to vote on certain policies,"
Ginsburg said. "Members of the community
need to have access to a record for Stanford's
stance so they can get involved."
Business School Finance Prof. George Park
er, chairman of the APIR, said that there are
only a few situations where corporate policies
affect Stanford's investments.
"The real issue is investment responsibility
— what companies are doing vis-a-vis what the
students or other constituents of the University
believe those companies should be doing along
the lines of the environment, human rights, di
versity and the several other values to which the
University is committed," Parker said. "Only in
the most extreme situations, as with core tobac
co stocks, does the University decide that cer
tain investments are not eligible investments."
The proposal also advocates more APIR
meetings and more student involvement. It
also recommends that students play an active
role in researching various corporations'
funding policies.
"[APIR] only meets for five to six hours a
year so members on the panel don't feel like
with that capacity they can research issues of
the investing world," Ginsburg said. "For ex
ample, students would want to know if we are
funding corporations involved with the Su
danese governments, so we should have stu
dents — who are paid or receive academic
credit — research corporations."
Senior Anna Mumford, a student represen
tative on the APIR, said she believes that re
forms such as the Web site will be welcomed by
the older panel members. However, SCID
members said they still anticipate opposition to
the aspects of the proposal regarding disclosure.
"I think it is clear to everyone on APIR that
APIR's policies need to be made more explicit
and more public, so I see recommendations like
the Web site probably being adopted," Mum
ford said. "I think it is likely the more substantial
recommendations for public equity or private
equity disclosure will be immediately dismissed
by the more conservative APIR members."
SCID leaders said they are still hopeful that

the APIR members will recognize the need for
change and accept the reforms.
"Stanford has always been a leader in invest
ment responsibility," Ginsburg said. "Disclo
sure is becoming a pretty standard thing. Public
universities do it. Many people care about this
issue, and I expect the panel to take the issue of
investment disclosure seriously."
