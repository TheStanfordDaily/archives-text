### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
With the results certified and the
seventh ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate ready to take office next Tuesday,
it seemed as though there would be
no surprises or unexpected twists in
this year's ASSU elections.
However, on Monday night, cur
rent Senator and Appropriations
Chair Dan Stringer, a junior, de
clared that he was abdicating his po
sition on next year's Senate.
Stringer had received 976 votes in
this year's election, the most votes
received by any candidate, and was
also considered to be a contender
for the Senate chair position.

things that I've thought about made
me decide that it wasn't something I
wanted to do."
A lack of time to devote to school

Stringer's decision to resign.
"Last quarter 1 didn't put as much
energy into my academics as I would
[have]like[d] to," Stringer said. "I'd
hope this quarter would be better but
I still found myself not being able to
spend as much time on that aspect of
my Stanford experience."
In addition to needing more time
for his studies, Stringer said that he
wanted to be able to "refocus and re

"It's important to take time to do
