# Stringer resigns from Senate
## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
With the results certified and the
seventh ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate ready to take office next Tuesday,
it seemed as though there would be
no surprises or unexpected twists in
this year's ASSU elections.
However, on Monday night, cur
rent Senator and Appropriations
Chair Dan Stringer, a junior, de
clared that he was abdicating his po
sition on next year's Senate.
Stringer had received 976 votes in
this year's election, the most votes
received by any candidate, and was
also considered to be a contender
for the Senate chair position.
"It came as quite a shock to me,"
said ASSU Undergraduate Senate

Chair Chris Lin, a senior. "I hadn't
expected this. It would have been
much more ideal if he had made the
decision not to be a senator four
weeks ago, before the election."
As a result, the senate candidate
who received the 16th highest vote
count, freshman Andrew Jimenez
Barragan, will now fill the vacancy as
the 15th senator.
"I'm ready to serve," Barragan
said. "One good thing you're going to
get out of me is a good listener. I'm
willing to work and talk with the stu
dent body and the Senate."
Stringer said that because of time
commitment issues, he was uncertain
if he wanted to continue with his po
sition next year.
"I ran for Senate at the beginning
of the quarter," Stringer said. "1 was
continuously thinking about if I want-

Ed to do it. Over the past couple of
weeks some time issues and other
things that I've thought about made
me decide that it wasn't something I
wanted to do."
A lack of time to devote to school
work was a primary factor in
Stringer's decision to resign.
"Last quarter 1 didn't put as much
energy into my academics as I would
[have]like[d] to," Stringer said. "I'd
hope this quarter would be better but
I still found myself not being able to
spend as much time on that aspect of
my Stanford experience."
In addition to needing more time
for his studies, Stringer said that he
wanted to be able to "refocus and re
flect on life experiences."
"It's important to take time to do
that," Stringer said. "So with all the
other commitments I had, 1 didn't
have time to do all those things that
are very important to me."
Lin said that Stringer's perfor
mance over the past year has been ex
ceptional.
"Dan did a very dedicated job as
appropriations chair," Lin said. "It's
probably the most time-consuming
position after the senate chair and
has the most direct responsibility to
ward student groups, so I was look
ing forward to having him back."
While it would have been possible
for him to continue as a senator next
year. Stringer said he felt that it
would not be in the best interest of
the student body if he could not put
100 percent into his job.
"I figured that I could just con
tinue to serve on the Senate, but not
put as much energy into it and not
give it my all," Stringer said. "I de
cided that that wouldn't be the best
thing for the Senate in general, it
wouldn't be what the people who
elected me to be in the Senate want
ed me there for."
Barragan said that Stringer's deci
sion to abdicate is a result of his ded
ication to the Senate.
Lin said Stringer's knowledge of
how to run the appropriations com
mittee — which decides how much
money to allocate to student groups
— would have been valuable to the
incoming Senate.
"In my mind it's good to have old
senators returning," Lin said. "We
are going from having three people
with direct previous Senate experi
ence down to two people."
Nevertheless, Lin and Stringer
agree that next year's Senate will
continue to run smoothly despite the
recent change.
"The incoming senators, includ
ing Andrew Barragan, seem to have
a lot of energy and a lot of great
ideas," Stringer said. "I think that will
serve the Senate and Stanford as a
whole. There are people around, my
self included, that the incoming sena
tors can draw on for support."
Stringer stressed that his decision to
step down should not have an impact
on any student who is considering par
ticipating in the ASSU in the future.
"I was thinking 'Is this going to
scare people off from Senate?' he
said. "I don't want Senate to seem
like this huge thing that it doesn't
necessarily need to be. It definitely
doesn't need to be something that's
overbearing or extremely time-con
suming."

thing for the Senate in general, it
wouldn't be what the people who
elected me to be in the Senate want
ed me there for."
Barragan said that Stringer's deci
sion to abdicate is a result of his ded
ication to the Senate.
Lin said Stringer's knowledge of
how to run the appropriations com
mittee — which decides how much
money to allocate to student groups
— would have been valuable to the
incoming Senate.
"In my mind it's good to have old
senators returning," Lin said. "We
are going from having three people
with direct previous Senate experi
ence down to two people."
Nevertheless, Lin and Stringer
agree that next year's Senate will
continue to run smoothly despite the
recent change.
"The incoming senators, includ
ing Andrew Barragan, seem to have
a lot of energy and a lot of great
ideas," Stringer said. "I think that will
serve the Senate and Stanford as a
whole. There are people around, my
self included, that the incoming sena
tors can draw on for support."
Stringer stressed that his decision to
step down should not have an impact
on any student who is considering par
ticipating in the ASSU in the future.
"I was thinking 'Is this going to
scare people off from Senate?' he
said. "I don't want Senate to seem
like this huge thing that it doesn't
necessarily need to be. It definitely
doesn't need to be something that's
overbearing or extremely time-con
suming."
