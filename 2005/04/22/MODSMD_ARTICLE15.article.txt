# Herstory highlights hormones
## 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
Female sex hormones have reached an almost
mythical status in today's society, and very few people
are sure exactly how they work and influence women's
health from puberty through menopause. This was the
topic tackled by Marcia Stefanick, professor of re
search medicine, who spoke at the Women's Commu
nity Center on Wednesday night as part of the annual
Herstory celebration.
To begin her talk, Stefanick highlighted the pio
neering efforts of figures like Margaret Sanger, the

first advocate of birth control, who made positive,
progressive impacts on medical and pharmacological
treatment for women.
Stefanick worked to exposing pharmaceutical compa
nies that did not cite complete lists of side effects, or at
times, cited unproven medical benefits of synthetic hor
mone treatments for women.
"There are so many myths about what these sex hor
mones do," she said.
Studies have shown that taking some hormones in
creases the risk of dementia, but until July 2002 many
doctors still encouraged their female
patients to take them due to biased
pharmaceutical marketing strategies
and limited independent research.
In 2002, an eight-year-long study
proved that women taking hormones
-T- both in the form of oral contra
ceptives or menopausal drugs â€”
could in fact suffer side effects, in
cluding heart attack, and stroke. Be
fore the report, pharmaceutical com
panies routinely denied the potential
for these side effects.
Stefanick briefly reviewed the
history of birth control and argued
that there has been a backward trend
in women's rights when it comes to
contraception.
"Right now we are reversing to
where we are back in the 605," she
said. "There is a huge movement
against many of today's freedoms in

oral contraception. We are going to
have to fight some of the battles
again."
She cited a New York Times arti
cle about pharmacists who refuse or
who are told not to distribute emer
gency contraception.
Senior Jane Nevis, one of the
event's coordinators and a Women's
Community Center staff member,
said she found the talk informative.
"I enjoyed the depth and the ex
planation of the history, politics and
economic forces that influenced
women's health care," she said.
Medical student Abel Romero,
one of several male audience mem
bers, echoed Nevins' comments.
"[Stefanik] did a particularly ex
ceptional job in demonstrating the
unnecessary bureaucracy that stems
from a barrage of women's health
providers," he said. "I also like the
way she contrasted America and Eu
rope. She highlighted the issue that
there seems to be more interest in
economic and political factors than
on women's health."
