# Students volunteer on Westly campaign
## 
### TOLU OLORUNNIPA 
In an effort to help Stanford
alumnus Steve Westly oust Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger next year,
12 members of the Stanford
Democrats headed down to Los
Angeles last weekend to volunteer
at the California state Democratic
convention.
Many of these students, who were
mostly undergraduates, said they
were attracted to Westly because of
his ties to the Stanford community.
Having lived most of his life within
10 miles of Hoover Tower, Westly
graduated from Stanford in 1978 and
received his master's degree in pub
lic management from the Graduate
School of Business in 1983.
Westly is not new to politics — he
was even a member of the Under
graduate Senate and as co-president
for the ASSU.
Kai Stinchcombe, a second-year
graduate student and former Stan
ford Democrats president who at
tended the convention, said that the
group stayed busy during the week
end speaking to delegates about
Westly's policies and encouraging
them to support him in his bid for
governor. The students were also ac
tive in interacting with various cau
cuses, making sure Westly was given
an opportunity to speak with numer
ous political groups.
"[The students'] role at the con
vention was absolutely critical to the
success that Steve experienced at the
convention," said Brian Johnson, a
graduate student at the Business
School and deputy political director
for Westly's campaign. "They had a
lot of interaction with him, getting
him to speak in front of different
groups, supporting him when he was

speaking to the party-at-large on
Saturday morning, working the
booth at the convention when Steve
was there and working with other
volunteers and delegates."
The students spent most of their
time drumming up publicity, orga
nizing events and vying for support.
Volunteer coordinator Zach Levine
said that the group created a "buzz"
around Westly's campaign.
He added that the young
Democrats who volunteered stood
out at the convention and were vital
to Westly's publicity efforts.
"They did a great job," Levine
said. "They really proved them
selves and made us feel that we
wanted to get them more involved
in the future."
Stinchcombe called Westly a
"young person's candidate." Stinch
combe said he was first drawn to the
campaign because most of the people
working for him are under age 30.
"He was clearly excited to see
us," Stinchcombe added.
Johnson agreed that Westly ap
preciated the students' efforts.
"Steve was energized," he said.
"Having young, smart, excited peo
ple surrounding him throughout the
entire weekend really kept him
going strong."
Stinchcombe and Johnson, as
well as many other Stanford stu
dents, said they plan to continue
their involvement in Westly's cam
paign while on campus.
Jude Barry, Westly's campaign
manager, said he hopes to Encourage
Stanford students and alumni to con
tinue to support Westly.
"The Stanford students were an
integral part of our convention oper
ation and Stanford students and
alumni are going to be an integral
part of this campaign," Barry said.
"We're going to run the campaign
from Menlo Park or possibly even
Palo Alto. We expect Stanford stu
dents and alumni to play a peak role
in the campaign and that's one of the
reasons we're going to have our
headquarters located within a short
drive of the Stanford campus."
Sophomore Marie Jonas, presi
dent of the Stanford Democrats, also

attended the convention and said that
while Westly "is a great candidate,"
many of the students went to Los An
geles mainly for the experience.
"It was so valuable," she said.
"It was really inspiring, seeing a lot
of the speakers who were there.
There was a lot of energy there
from the Democrats from around
California."
While the Stanford Democrats
were enthusiastic about helping
Westly's campaign, Jonas said the
organization has not officially made
him their candidate of choice.
"The group itself doesn't endorse
Westly," she said. "We're going to
have an open discussion about the
pros and cons of all the candidates."
