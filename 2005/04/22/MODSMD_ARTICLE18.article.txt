The innocent-looking bicycle. To most,
it is merely a two-wheeled land vehi
cle, invented in the 19th century. Just
glancing at the number of bikes at Tresid
der, one gets the feeling that it's the most
common and seemingly harmless mode of
transportation among Stanford students.
But to the pedestrian (i.e. me), bicycles
are instruments of death and destruction
that terrorize the alleyways of campus.
Of the many modes of transportation
that color the Stanford roadways — bicy
cles, skateboards, golf carts and powered
wheelchairs — bicycles have come to domi
nate the streets more and more aggressively
with their aerodynamic frames and swift
pedals.
Not only are bicyclists growing more and
more arrogant as they attempt to subvert
the natural transportation hierarchy by
passing golf carts drivers, but they are also
displaying a general disregard for the laws of
transportation by pedaling through stop
signs, riding on sidewalks and crashing into

pedestrians.
This behavior is inex
cusable.
You'd think that we
could live in comfortable
harmony, each respect
ing one another's mode
of transportation to class.
Yet bicyclists have come
to tyrannize and oppress
others, taking advantage
of their incredible speed

(up to an incontestable 15
m.p.h.) and their undeniable ability to slice
through traffic.
And 1 don't understand why it has to be
the pedestrians they crash into. It's not like
you can't see us. We move at around 2
m.p.h.
But anyway, this is not to say that I've al
ways lived in fear of these deadly, accident
prone, two-wheeled land vehicles. I, too,
was once a bicyclist, not unlike you or Lance
Armstrong. I, too, succumbed to buying a
bicycle when I first enrolled at this universi
ty-
And why would I have thought other
wise? The advantages of bicycling are clear.
You can't deny the incredible speed and
mobility they give you as you pedal to class
in a startling four minutes, wind blowing in
your hair, cruising at a precarious 10 to 15
m.p.h.; or the power they grant you as you as
you glide down those bicycle ramps, picking
up more and more speed to brush past those
unsuspecting pedestrians or ridiculous
looking motorized-scooter riders.
Plus, everyone else was getting a bike.
And, as the kind of pathetic person who now
lives in perpetual fear of a two-wheeled ve
hicle, I'm not really the type of person who
"resists" peer pressure. I like to fit in. I want
to be cool. And bicycles were the"in" mode
of transportation.
But don't let the advantages of bicycling
fool you. Bicycles are not "recreational" or
"user-friendly" forms of transportation.
They are unwieldy, pedestrian-hating,
death machines.
The intersection at the clock tower (or
the "intersection of death" as it is popularly
referred to), for example, is a violent free
for-all. Five different paths filled with
crazed, pedestrian-hating bicyclists spill into
a common square of space. Only the strong
survive.
I was not one of the strong.
After suffering two collisions with other
bicycles and one with the clock tower itself,
I decided to give up bicycling — partly for
my own safety, partly for the good of
mankind.
But to my dismay, 1 have found that the
life of the pedestrian is no safer than that of
the bicyclist. Rather than being able to
avoid the bicyclists, we are forced to move
closer to them as they trespass onto our side
walks and corridors in the Quad. And their
desire to "overtake" us on our own side
walks or take shortcuts through large
crowds repeatedly endangers our existence.
Plus, is it really that great of an accom
plishment? Congratulations, you overtook a
pedestrian. Maybe someday you'll be able
to outrace that kid in the wheelchair.
In any case, pedestrians have just as
much a right to our sidewalks and cross
walks as do golf carts, bicycles, and yes —
even those most hated and ridiculed of vehi
cles— the motorized scooter. Just because
we use our legs to move instead of some me
chanical contraption with "wheels" and
"engines" doesn't make us any more ex
pendable.
And so, to those who bike to class, 1 be
seech you. We are all students at heart,
struggling to make the most of our higher
education, just trying to make our way to
class. Crash amongst each other if you have
to — you can even take out that golf cart if
you want, or the powered wheelchair, if
that's your thing, you sadistic bicyclist. Just
don't hurt the pedestrian.
