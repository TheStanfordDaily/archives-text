# One Girl, One Goal: Become Greek

You may have
seen the throngs. The
mini-skirt-wearing,
trendy-purse-toting, per
fect-hair-sporting throngs.

It could only mean one
thing: sorority rush.

From March 30 to April 4,
Stanford girls whipped out their
best schmoozing skills in hopes of
getting an invitation to join one of

Stanford's five Intersorority Council
sororities.

For Silvia Sanchez, a freshman living

in Roble. the experience was eye-opening.

"Throughout the year I had sororities in

the back of my mind," said Sanchez. "I was
pretty much set on joining even before the
rush process started."

Rush officially started on a Friday night
with an Open House, at which girls could
attend 35-minute "parties," each spon
sored by one of the five sororities, to
begin deciding the process of mutual se
lection.

"The first day was so much fun: it was
completely different from what 1 expect
ed." said Sanchez. "I came in with a pre
conceived notion of what a sorority is all
about, but the girls completely changed
my mind about everything. They are just

normal people who don't live up to all the
bad things people say about them."
Sanchez said the best part of the night was
that she felt she could be herself around the
sorority girls.

On Saturday morning, the girls anxiously
went to find out how effective their social skills
had been and which sororities had invited them
back for another round of parties.

Sanchez was happy to discover that her performance

at the Open House had won her four invites — one to
Kappa Alpha Theta, one to Pi Beta Phi, one to Chi Omega and
one to Delta Delta Delta.

The second night, the girls could potentially attend up to four soror
ity parties, each lasting 40 minutes, depending on how many invites they
had received from the previous evening. If a girl received five invites,
then she would have to choose only four out of the five.
"When we arrived at the parties, the sorority girls were in two lines
and we walked through the lines, talking to one girl at a time," said
Sanchez. "Also, each of the sororities prepared a skit to let us know what
they are all about."

Sanchez said that at this event she felt even more comfortable than at
the last.
"I didn't feel like I was being interrogated at all. it was more like a con
versation." she said. "It's a process of mutual selection so I was gauging
them just as much as they were gauging me."
After the parties, the competition increased as sororities narrowed
their choices for new recruits. On Sunday morning, the remaining girls
nervously picked up their second invites to see which parties they could
attend that night. At this point, the girls going through the process had to
narrow their choices from four sororities to three.
"1 went to three parties tonight and spent 45 minutes at each one,"
said Sanchez after going through the Sunday night round. "The main em
phasis of these events was the philanthropic aspect of the sororities. I was
very impressed with all of the good things these girls do for the commu
nity."
Sanchez said that her positive opinion of the sororities was only rein
forced by the night's events.
"Overall, today was just a very awesome day," she said on Sunday. "I
really liked the fact that we got to participate in the girls' charities. I felt
like 1 got to take part in something really good and it only made me want
to join the sororities even more."
However, while trying to establish friendships with the sorority mem
bers, Sanchez did not have time to meet the other girls who were being
recruited.
"I haven't met too many of the rushees and the ones I have met, 1
don't know very well," she said. "But they all seem like really nice girls
who are looking forward to the same things that I am. They seem like
very driven and goal-oriented girls, as most Stanford people are."
The next morning, the girls went to pick up their vital fourth-round in
vites. While the girls were allowed to attend a maximum of two one-hour
parties, Sanchez received only one invite — to Tri Delt, her first-choice
sorority.
This last event was more formal than the previous three and was held
at the Sheraton in Palo Alto. According to Sanchez, there were dramat

icaily

fewer girls
than there

were at the be
ginning of the
rush process.

" This event was a
lot more personal than
the others had been,"

said Sanchez. "The girls
showed us a video and told

us about what made them
choose their particular sorori
ty."

After attending the parties,
the rushees were not allowed to

talk to any of the sorority members
or any of the other rushees, in hopes

that they would be able to make their
own final decision without any influence

or pressure.
The next day came the moment of truth

— bid day. From 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., the few re
maining girls picked up their sorority bids and

decided which bid they would accept.
Sanchez received one a bid to join Tri Delt,
which she accepted.

"From the very beginning I had Tri Delt in mind
because 1 knew a few of the girls in the sorority and

got along with them really well," she said. "During the
process I clicked with the Tri Delt girls more than with

any of the other sororities. I could really see myself living
with these girls, being their close friend and confiding in

them."
Sanchez said she felt the rush process was a very positive
experience and is excited about becoming a part of Tri Delt.

"There are many advantages to joining a sorority, you get to
miss out on the Draw, you have networking opportunities for the
future and you make a lot of close new friends." she said. "I feel re
ally bad for the girls who dropped out in the middle of the process or
who didn't get any bids."
