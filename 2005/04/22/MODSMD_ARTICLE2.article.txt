# Starting job worth the wait
## OF Lewis makes smooth transition 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
In his freshman campaign dur
ing the spring of 2003, junior Chris
Lewis, a highly touted prospect
out of Santa Margarita, Calif., was
handed the starting job at second
base. Lewis was eager to start his
Cardinal career — maybe a little
too eager. He played solid de
fense, but he struggled with his bat
and was relegated to the bench
after hitting just .179 in 18 starts.
Lewis began last season as one
of a group of four talented middle
infielders who would have to com
pete for starting jobs at shortstop
and second base. He started the
first four games at second along
side junior Jed Lowrie at short but
went hitless in his first eight at
bats. Lowrie, Lewis' roommate in
Mirrielees, moved over to second,
and Chris Minaker eventually won
the starting job at short. Lowrie
developed into an All-American,
and Lewis didn't get another shot
at the starting job.
After playing a utility role and
doing some pinch-hitting but
mostly just watching for two years,
Lewis has found a home in left
field. He's also found his niche at
the plate. As it turned out, the
time he spent waiting to play
taught him the virtue of patience.
"I think that my freshman year
1 didn't get good pitches to hit,"
Lewis said, "and I used last year as
a learning experience to get my
self better pitches to hit and to try
to work the count better."
The turning point may have
come last year on April 20, when
third baseman Jonny Ash broke
his finger while laying down a sac
rifice bunt in a game against St.
Mary's. Lewis took over for Ash
and started eight games, hitting
.348 with three homers and five
RBI.
Head coach Mark Marquess
searched fora way to get Lewis'
bat into the lineup this fall, trying

him out at three of the four infield
spots. Lewis spent a lot of time at
third base, but sophomore Adam
Sorgi won that job. Finally, Mar
quess approached Lewis about
playing left field, and Lewis
jumped at the opportunity.
"I just wanted a chance to help
the team, and if left field was the
place where I was going to do the
best job, then that's fine with me,"
Lewis said.
Lewis knew that in the Cardi
nal baseball program, opportuni
ties to play everyday are few and
far between.
"As a young player, you kind of
take it for granted when you're in
there, and you don't realize what a
privilege it is to be playing at this
level," he said.
So far this year, Lewis' new ap
proach has paid dividends. He has
developed into a consistent offen
sive threat, hitting .271 with five
home runs (second on the team)
and 23 RBI (fourth). His produc
tion picked up when he filled in
for Ash last season, but Lewis said
that it may have been more a func
tion of the fact that pitchers didn't
know what he could do. He be
lieves that the turnaround didn't
really happen until this year.
"I don't think anybody had
seen me hit in a while, so they
might have left a couple of pitches
over the middle of the plate that I
could hit out of the park," he said.
"Once they realized that I could
hit the ball out of the park, they
started to not throw me as many
fastballs. Anybody can hit fast
balls, but this year, I'm doing a
better job of hitting the curves."
Lowrie agreed.
"This year he knows what
pitches he can hit hard, and he
waits for those pitches," he said.
"He's really matured, and he real
ly has a better approach at the
plate."

Junior Chris Lewis has finally found his niche in the Cardinal lineup as
the team's leftfielder and a constantly developing power threat.
outfield, as well. He dropped two
fly balls in early-season series
against Fresno State and Cal
State-Fullerton but has made only
one error since. Lowrie calls him
the team's best defensive outfield
er.
"If you spend enough time out
there, you start to figure it out,"
Lewis said of his new position.
"Most of the work 1 needed to do
was strengthening my arm for the
outfield and being able to throw
accurately to a target."
Lewis could return to the in

field if the team needed him there
—he played one game at third
base earlier this year when Sorgi
was laid low with the flu. But
Lewis seems to be doing fine at his
new position.
Lowrie, however, senses that
his friend might miss the infield a
bit more than he lets on.
"He doesn't verbalize it that
often, but when he practices with
us he has a little extra flair than he
has in the outfield. He gets a little
Latin once in a while."
Lewis may be flashy in prac
tices, but the remarkable thing
about his play this season is that it
has been so steady.
"As long as I'm in the lineup,
that's really all I care about," he
said.
