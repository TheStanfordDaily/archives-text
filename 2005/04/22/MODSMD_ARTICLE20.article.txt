Metal pieces went flying last Thursday as excited freshman and
sophomore boys tore apart an old car with sledgehammers, crow
bars and bats in a University-sanctioned rush event. Each guy

was allowed to keep the piece that he ripped off the car, turn
ing the event into an all-out demolition contest.

"I was able to get a door handle," said freshman
rushee, John Clark. "It was pretty sweet because we just
railed on this wreck of a car for however long we wanted."

This attack on machinery was just one of the many ex
citing fraternity rush events that took place every
night from April 4to 21. More than 300 guys showed
up nightly to participate in dodgeball games, paint-

ball fights and more, making turnout for this
year's rush one of the largest turnouts in Stan
ford history.

"This is the really fun part," said sophomore
and Kappa Alpha member Graham Brant-
Zawadzki. "You just get the chance to meet

a lot of guys and participate in some great
activities. Everyone is pretty laid back

and out to have a good time."
The

process is run by the Interfraternity Council, which includes eight
housed and three unhoused fraternities on campus. Each week, a frater
nity is allowed to have two weekday evening events and one weekend
event, such as a barbecue or retreat. The rushees are able to attend
whichever events they would like, but because multiple fraternities
schedules events on the same nights, they are forced into being selective
from the start.
Unlike sorority recruitment, there is no "invite" process, which
means that a person can technically return to whichever fraternity he
chooses as many times as he likes.
"You don't get called back, but you get a sense of whether you should
go back," said freshman rushee Sam Fankuchen. "I saw kids come the
first week and not come back the second week. It was either because
they figured the frat wasn't right for them or they got hints from people
in the house. That's the nature of the process. It's very mutual."
Some freshmen approached the process without a strong sense of
which frat they wanted to join.
"I had 110 preconceived notions," Clark said. "As far as 1 was con
cerned, Greek life was like 'Animal House.' which it actually seems to be
living up to pretty well."
More frequently, however, they went in with a sense of where they
would fit in best. For Fankuchen, the choice came down to the quality
and environment of the particular fraternity.

"I was really drawn to the traditions of [Sigma Alpha Epsilon]," said

Fankuchen, who received a bid from the fraternity. "They have more
formals and coat-and-tie events, but they also have such strong tradition

in terms of the way things have been carried on for decades. The guys

there all know this and are really into keeping the tradition going

and spending a lot of time together."

Other rushees were drawn into a particular house be
cause of friends or teammates. Clark, who is on the

Rugby team, found that going through rush with

Sigma Chi — which already houses a number of

his teammates and friends — made the choice
much easier.

"1 was close with so many of the guys there
and it just felt comfortable," said Clark, who

received a bid from Sigma Chi. "I probably
could have gotten more out of rush by

going in not knowing anyone and being
less biased, but that just wasn't the case."

For sophomore Luis Cerna, the

process has been different from what
most freshmen rushees go through.
Cerna decided not to rush last year, but
since then has become good friends
with guys in SAE. Fie said that rushing
this year as a sophomore made the pro
cess much more comfortable.

"I realized this year that all the peo-

ple I hang out with and all my friends
are involved in the Greek community,"

said Cerna, who received a bid from
SAE. "Everyone who really enjoys going

out and being social is Greek. I have been
hanging out with the guvs in SAE for over a

year, and it just works."

Cerna found himself having to make a con-

scious effort throughout the process to act as a

rushee and not as a member.

"I honestly don't know many people in my
pledge class," said Cerna. "I think I only really met

two, and one of them thought that I was an active and was

thus sucking up to me."
One of the reasons many guys said they rushed was to
avoid the often-dreaded housing Draw.
"Mv nrimarv reason is to have the group of friends.

—JiJ— or — '
but there are a lot of practical bonuses," said Fankuchen.
"Skipping the Draw and having a good cook are key."

However, not everyone found the rush process to be
fun and games. Many felt that it consisted of awk-

ward conversations and premature judgments.
Freshman Joel Lewenstein, who ended up choos-

ing the unhoused fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi.
said he felt that rush brought out qualities in
guys reminiscent of pre-teen year behavior.

"It formalizes the social process
that happened informally in middle
school," said Lewenstein. "It's like an of-

ficial state-sanctioned 'you're cool' and
'you're not, so you have to sit at this

lunch table? "
While the structured social process

may have made fora slightly nega
tive experience for some, there is

certainly time for just plain
crazy behavior. Delta Chi

pledges found themselves
running around scantily-

clad while being shot at by
rushees with paint balls.
"It was really

funny," Clark said.
"They would just stand

there and four people
would shoot at once
and they would
just scream and

fall to the
ground. I

shouldn't
say it was
awesome.

sophomore boys tore apart an old car with sledgehammers, crow
bars and bats in a University-sanctioned rush event. Each guy

was allowed to keep the piece that he ripped off the car, turn
ing the event into an all-out demolition contest.

"I was able to get a door handle," said freshman
rushee, John Clark. "It was pretty sweet because we just
railed on this wreck of a car for however long we wanted."

This attack on machinery was just one of the many ex
citing fraternity rush events that took place every
night from April 4to 21. More than 300 guys showed
up nightly to participate in dodgeball games, paint-

ball fights and more, making turnout for this
year's rush one of the largest turnouts in Stan
ford history.

"This is the really fun part," said sophomore
and Kappa Alpha member Graham Brant-
Zawadzki. "You just get the chance to meet

a lot of guys and participate in some great
activities. Everyone is pretty laid back

and out to have a good time."
The

process is run by the Interfraternity Council, which includes eight
housed and three unhoused fraternities on campus. Each week, a frater
nity is allowed to have two weekday evening events and one weekend
event, such as a barbecue or retreat. The rushees are able to attend
whichever events they would like, but because multiple fraternities
schedules events on the same nights, they are forced into being selective
from the start.
Unlike sorority recruitment, there is no "invite" process, which
means that a person can technically return to whichever fraternity he
chooses as many times as he likes.
"You don't get called back, but you get a sense of whether you should
go back," said freshman rushee Sam Fankuchen. "I saw kids come the
first week and not come back the second week. It was either because
they figured the frat wasn't right for them or they got hints from people
in the house. That's the nature of the process. It's very mutual."
Some freshmen approached the process without a strong sense of
which frat they wanted to join.
"I had 110 preconceived notions," Clark said. "As far as 1 was con
cerned, Greek life was like 'Animal House.' which it actually seems to be
living up to pretty well."
More frequently, however, they went in with a sense of where they
would fit in best. For Fankuchen, the choice came down to the quality
and environment of the particular fraternity.

"I was really drawn to the traditions of [Sigma Alpha Epsilon]," said

Fankuchen, who received a bid from the fraternity. "They have more
formals and coat-and-tie events, but they also have such strong tradition

in terms of the way things have been carried on for decades. The guys

there all know this and are really into keeping the tradition going

and spending a lot of time together."

Other rushees were drawn into a particular house be
cause of friends or teammates. Clark, who is on the

Rugby team, found that going through rush with

Sigma Chi — which already houses a number of

his teammates and friends — made the choice
much easier.

"1 was close with so many of the guys there
and it just felt comfortable," said Clark, who

received a bid from Sigma Chi. "I probably
could have gotten more out of rush by

going in not knowing anyone and being
less biased, but that just wasn't the case."

For sophomore Luis Cerna, the

process has been different from what
most freshmen rushees go through.
Cerna decided not to rush last year, but
since then has become good friends
with guys in SAE. Fie said that rushing
this year as a sophomore made the pro
cess much more comfortable.

"I realized this year that all the peo-

ple I hang out with and all my friends
are involved in the Greek community,"

said Cerna, who received a bid from
SAE. "Everyone who really enjoys going

out and being social is Greek. I have been
hanging out with the guvs in SAE for over a

year, and it just works."

Cerna found himself having to make a con-

scious effort throughout the process to act as a

rushee and not as a member.

"I honestly don't know many people in my
pledge class," said Cerna. "I think I only really met

two, and one of them thought that I was an active and was

thus sucking up to me."
One of the reasons many guys said they rushed was to
avoid the often-dreaded housing Draw.
"Mv nrimarv reason is to have the group of friends.

—JiJ— or — '
but there are a lot of practical bonuses," said Fankuchen.
"Skipping the Draw and having a good cook are key."

However, not everyone found the rush process to be
fun and games. Many felt that it consisted of awk-

ward conversations and premature judgments.
Freshman Joel Lewenstein, who ended up choos-

ing the unhoused fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi.
said he felt that rush brought out qualities in
guys reminiscent of pre-teen year behavior.

"It formalizes the social process
that happened informally in middle
school," said Lewenstein. "It's like an of-

ficial state-sanctioned 'you're cool' and
'you're not, so you have to sit at this

lunch table? "
While the structured social process

may have made fora slightly nega
tive experience for some, there is

certainly time for just plain
crazy behavior. Delta Chi

pledges found themselves
running around scantily-

clad while being shot at by
rushees with paint balls.
"It was really

funny," Clark said.
"They would just stand

there and four people
would shoot at once
and they would
just scream and

fall to the
ground. I

shouldn't
say it was
awesome.

but it
kind of
was."
