## Editorial Stanford needs sustainability director 
### 
In Stanford's 2(X)2 Guidelines for Sustainable
Buildings, the Environmental Stewardship Commit
tee recommended that the University appoint a sus
tainability coordinator. This coordinator would "act
as an educator, rather than an inspector,' so that the
Project leam develops the knowledge and commit
ment to achieve the best balance for the project." This
position was filled part-time for two years, but has
been vacant for the past nine months.
Even without a sustainability coordinator, the Uni
versity has made a significant effort toward making
Stanford's buildings more environmentally sustain
able. A Green Dorm project is currently in the plan
ning stages, and "green" measures have been incor
porated into renovation projects under Housing's
Capital Improvement Program.
And it's worth noting that the position, as de
scribed in the guidelines, is hardly one of great power.
But a sustainability coordinator could still play a very
real and very significant role in giving environmental
consciousness a more prominent role in University
planning.
Some of the current construction projects' incor
poration of sustainable building principles leaves
much to be desired. In the plans for the Munger Grad
uate Residences, for example, the inclusion of multi
ple bathrooms for most apartments and a washer and
dryer in every apartment are only the most blatant of
a raft of concerns about size, energy use and space that

seem to belie the University's stated environmental
commitment. While it's hard to pin down the exact
impact that a sustainability coordinator would have
had on the final design, employing at least one staff
member whose primary concern was to advocate for
green design could have potentially done a great deal
more to ensure these issues were taken seriously in
the planning process.
We hope that this voice will be present in planning
future projects.
Stanford's position seems especially poor when
compared to the University's peer institutions. Har
vard's Green Campus Initiative currently includes
two program co-chairs, a director and 11 staffers.
While Stanford administrators need not match Har
vard's efforts tit-for-tat, the significant discrepancy
does seem to imply that sustainability is not a priority
here on the Farm.
Stanford has already taken steps to make this a
truly green campus. But today. Earth Day, is a good
time to remind administrators that they could do bet
ter. Students and administrators can and should af
firm their personal dedication to the environment, but
when it comes to a process that involves tradeoffs be
tween dozens of competing needs and requirements,
that is not enough. Hiring a full-time sustainability di
rector would be an important step in signaling Stan
ford's dedication to the environment and to its own
Guidelines for Sustainable Buildings.
