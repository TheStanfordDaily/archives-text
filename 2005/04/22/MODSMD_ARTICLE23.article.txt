## The
						break-down shake-down: notes from the attritive university 
### 
In the course of a Stanford school
year, one is almost certain to en
counter several columns and articles in
this paper lamenting widespread yet
well-masked depression on campus.
At the same time, one will hear the
rather louder chorus of platitudes
praising the University: "The best four
years of our lives," "the school where
everybody smiles," "another sunny
day on the Farm."
There is something incongruent

about this picture. Either "everybody" enjoys a high qual
ity of life or psychic anxiety grips the majority of us, but
not both at the same time. Most probably, we undergrad
uates are in some ways built up and in other ways broken
down. But what no administrator will say publicly, and
what is the great evasion of University self-representa
tion, is just how much breaking down occurs.
The University purports to provide us with an accre
tive education. Our research projects gather force and de
liver us to theses and awards. The junior-year internship is
a necessary ritual, and job placement or graduate-school
admission a Edenic inevitability. General contentment
rises as friendships and behaviors settle in.
Much of this is true. It can be attested to by anyone who
has witnessed a quarter-culminating performance by the
Institute for Diversity in the Arts and the social bonds
borne thereof, or by anyone whose seminar finished with
a well-crafted essay and a class-wide dinner trip.
But the rosy experience is not universal. A senior
friend of mine recently recalled the tone of her Sopho
more College program and of the liberally endowed
Freshman and Sophomore Programs generally. She re
membered how University officials constantly empha
sized the need to meet professors and undertake research
projects.

According to my friend, no matter how worthy the
goals, the many ways in which one can live and study at
Stanford were subsumed to the sole path of research.
Personally, 1 have found that the initial excitement
over a course or project often becomes, within weeks, a
Sisyphean push to have it over with. Even fora seasoned
chooser of courses like myself, the joys of learning are fre
quently achieved only at the high expense of stress and
strain. What is supposed to build us up seems only and ul
timately to break us down. Under the upright cloak of an
accretive university there rest the slumped shoulders and
caffeine-addled minds of the denizens of the attritive uni
versity.
I think it is fair to say that an air of self-congratulation
surrounds the elite universities of this country, and no less
with the Farm. But let us momentarily adopt a more self
interrogating stance:
Why does White Plaza have a friendly cacophony at
the beginning of the quarter, and the chilly, forbidding
air of a Hawthorne tale by the end? Why is "midterm
season" such an accurate and portentous cliche? How
many caffeine addictions are borne of the 10-week
sprint? And how many times is that coffee mug the last
witness to our final strung-out session copy-editing a
seminar essay?
There is much that is accretive about our university, of
course. I must, for example, acknowledge that a good
friendship of mine was forged over Stern Late Nile cram
sessions. And the annual raft of school acceptances and
job offers does testify to our academic attainment, or at
least our employability. But it is psychic balance and com
munal values that quite often wane and dribble and peter
out, and just because these attritive sufferings are less
publicized should not make them less damning.
