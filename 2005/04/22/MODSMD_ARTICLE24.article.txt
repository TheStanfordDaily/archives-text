## God is Green 
### BECCA MILLER 
Last October, the President of the
National Association of Evangelicals
pledged his 30 million members to the
work of "creation care." Creation
care, better known to most Ameri
cans as environmentalism. empha
sizes that every person has a responsi
bility and obligation to protect the
earth. The Christian right isn't the
only religious group mobilizing mem
bers in defense of the environment.
Both the Coalition on the Environ
ment and Jewish Life and the Islamic
Foundation for Ecology and Environ
mental Sciences have entered the
public discourse on environmental
ism.
Religious people across the coun
try are recognizing that their faiths
impel them to sustain the earth. For
religions that are based in God's cre
ation of the earth, the earth becomes
more than just a background for
human activity — it is God's gift to
humans and the basis fora covenant
in which humans are expected to be
the stewards of creation. In this light,
our care for the environment is not

merely a benevolent pastime; instead
it is fulfilling a commandment from
God. In addition to this creation-cen
tered approach, the fragile relation
ship between humans and the envi
ronment is becoming clearer every
day. In December 2(K)4, the world wit
nessed a natural disaster of epic pro
portions. There is now a general sci
entific consensus that thousands of
deaths could have been prevented
had the coastal eco-system been more
intact. Increasingly, protecting the en
vironment means protecting each
other, the central rule of all religions.
For the first time in human history,
humans are causing environmental
destruction on a biblical scale. Global
climate change, deforestation and ex
tinction of animals are all causing de
struction that before now was only in
the realm of God. More than ever,
every religious person should feel a
unique obligation to work toward a
cleaner, healthier earth — the earth
that was intended for us, not the earth
we have created in our relentless pur
suit and use of natural resources.
There are 34 student religious
groups on campus. Every year they

enrich Stanford through community
service, social justice campaigns, so
cial action awareness and various
valuable spiritual offerings. Rarely,
however, do they explicitly address
environmental issues or collaborate
with environmental groups on cam
pus.
This is a call to action for religious
groups on campus. On this Earth Day,
every religious person and every reli
gious organization should take this
opportunity to revitalize our commit
ment to stewardship of the earth. We
must embrace our obligation to envi
ronmentalism; we must work togeth
er to create an environmentally sus
tainable campus, community and
world.
Religious organizations are a great
vehicle for environmental protection
because they already have the infras
tructure for massive mobilization. But
this obligation is just as poignant at an
individual level. Protecting the earth
that God made begins right here, right
now — it is about recycling, compost
ing, reducing gas use, turning off lighft
and saving water. It is about enjoying
and protecting our natural spaces,
parks, mountains and reserves. It is
about using our votes as our voices to
support legislation that we feel will
protect the earth for our children.
Earth Day was created in 1970 as a
secular holiday, but religious people
everywhere should welcome it into
their traditions of celebration. It is an
opportunity for us all to make room in
religious and spiritual lives for the
earth that we are so blessed to live on.
