# Techie Saves the World
## Who's your pope? 
### 
I'm not Catholic, so hopefully 1 won't
feel guilty writing about their affairs. But
the last pope had a term that lasted near
ly 27 years, so I don't know how long it'll
he until 1 can nag about a new one. Plus,
Pope Benedict XVI. born Joseph

Ratzinger in 1927,
looks too much like
the emperor from
"Star Wars" to re
sist.
Writing about
papal and other
Catholic issues as a
Protestant is a pre
carious job. I don't
wish to pass any

judgment on the Catholic Church — I
only wish to pass judgment on the selec
tion of its disturbingly conservative new
head of state. In all fairness, however, I'm
not going to dwell on his involvement in
the Hitler Youth in 1941 or his service in
the German army during the last few
years of World War Tw< >.
As far as 1 understand, he was op
posed to Nazi principles, left the Hitler
Youth for religious reasons and desert
ed the army shortly before the Ger
man surrender in 1945. And last 1
checked, we are 60 years removed
from all that. I'm a firm believer in
judging a man by who he is today, not
by who he may or may not have been
decades ago. Unfortunately, though,
the sight isn't much prettier — at least
not to this progressive Christian.
'ITie pope is, in a sense, the figurehead
fora group of a people who permeate
class and racial lines and national borders
globally. The key word in the preceding
sentence is, without a doubt, "globally."
While Catholicism, and Christianity in
general, has followed a downward trend
in Europe for decades, the opposite has
held true in the developing nations of
Latin America and Africa. Today, more
than 275 million Catholics live in Brazil
and Mexico, comprising well over a
quarter of the world's Catholics — and
that's just two countries in Latin Ameri
ca.
The Philippines is the third most
Catholic-heavy nation with close to 70
million, and Nigeria, Uganda and the
Democratic Republic of Congo together
make up another 60 million. What I'm
trying to demonstrate here (albeit long
windedly), is that Catholicism is no
longer a European phenomenon, but in
creasingly a truly international faith. Isn't
it time that a man — or woman, but I
won't even think of going there — who
represents the ever-more dominant non-
European Catholics occupy the papacy?
And if such a selection is tix) progres
sive, as it apparently is, couldn't the car
dinals at least have chosen a pontiff with

these people's basic human interests at
heart? The recently selected German is
strictly pro-life and stringently anti-birth
control, including condom use to pre
vent the proliferation of sexually trans
mitted diseases. Both these convictions,
while traditionally religious, are im
mensely counterproductive in the re
gions of the world where population is
ballooning and the spread of HIV/
AIDS is rampant. 1 would not ask that a
pope support such practices, but at least
he should not be as diametrically op
posed to them. Considering the growing
number of faithful in Latin America and
especially in Africa, issues of overpopu
lation and AIDS affect the Catholic
Church as much or more than anybody
else. A blind condemnation of tried-and
true methods of decelerating population
growth and slowing the epidemic is just
that blind.
And then there is the ever-present
issue of homosexuality — or, as
Ratanger described it in the late '80s, an
"intrinsic moral evil" and a "disorder."
In this day and age, when many modern
ized countries are on the verge of grant
ing same-sex marriage (knock on wood),
to have the spiritual leader of a billion
people — many of whom are certainly
gay — label homosexuality as "evil" is.
well, intrinsically absurd. I was hoping —
and even praying — that the conclave
could sack up and for once give Chris
tianity an air of tolerance. Excuse the
brief theological tangent, but at what
point will the church actually accept and
live up to one of its central tenets: "we are
all God's children"?
Ultimately, though, the most glaring
qualm I have about this new pope is not
his advanced age, not his being Euro
pean rather than Latino or African, not
his conservative convictions regarding
birth-control, not his stance on homosex
uality and certainly not his resemblance
to Darth Vader'sdark lord. It is rather his
steadfast belief, in his own words, that
"only in the Catholic Church is there
eternal salvation." Such a statement
should. I guess, be expected from the
leader of a religious faith — a leader who
is wholeheartedly devoted to his faith
(hopefully). However, the pope has be
come more than just a symbol of a uni
tary religion, but has, whether we like it
or not, become a moral role model for all
people. And such a man should not
make such exclusionary statements, but
should do everything he can to unite.
After all. there are plenty of divisive is
sues in today's world —we don't need
another.

Kalani hopes that iti coming years, Pope
Benedict XVI will make him eat his words.

I'm not Catholic, so hopefully 1 won't
feel guilty writing about their affairs. But
the last pope had a term that lasted near
ly 27 years, so I don't know how long it'll
he until 1 can nag about a new one. Plus,
Pope Benedict XVI. born Joseph

Ratzinger in 1927,
looks too much like
the emperor from
"Star Wars" to re
sist.
Writing about
papal and other
Catholic issues as a
Protestant is a pre
carious job. I don't
wish to pass any

judgment on the Catholic Church — I
only wish to pass judgment on the selec
tion of its disturbingly conservative new
head of state. In all fairness, however, I'm
not going to dwell on his involvement in
the Hitler Youth in 1941 or his service in
the German army during the last few
years of World War Tw< >.
As far as 1 understand, he was op
posed to Nazi principles, left the Hitler
Youth for religious reasons and desert
ed the army shortly before the Ger
man surrender in 1945. And last 1
checked, we are 60 years removed
from all that. I'm a firm believer in
judging a man by who he is today, not
by who he may or may not have been
decades ago. Unfortunately, though,
the sight isn't much prettier — at least
not to this progressive Christian.
'ITie pope is, in a sense, the figurehead
fora group of a people who permeate
class and racial lines and national borders
globally. The key word in the preceding
sentence is, without a doubt, "globally."
While Catholicism, and Christianity in
general, has followed a downward trend
in Europe for decades, the opposite has
held true in the developing nations of
Latin America and Africa. Today, more
than 275 million Catholics live in Brazil
and Mexico, comprising well over a
quarter of the world's Catholics — and
that's just two countries in Latin Ameri
ca.
The Philippines is the third most
Catholic-heavy nation with close to 70
million, and Nigeria, Uganda and the
Democratic Republic of Congo together
make up another 60 million. What I'm
trying to demonstrate here (albeit long
windedly), is that Catholicism is no
longer a European phenomenon, but in
creasingly a truly international faith. Isn't
it time that a man — or woman, but I
won't even think of going there — who
represents the ever-more dominant non-
European Catholics occupy the papacy?
And if such a selection is tix) progres
sive, as it apparently is, couldn't the car
dinals at least have chosen a pontiff with

these people's basic human interests at
heart? The recently selected German is
strictly pro-life and stringently anti-birth
control, including condom use to pre
vent the proliferation of sexually trans
mitted diseases. Both these convictions,
while traditionally religious, are im
mensely counterproductive in the re
gions of the world where population is
ballooning and the spread of HIV/
AIDS is rampant. 1 would not ask that a
pope support such practices, but at least
he should not be as diametrically op
posed to them. Considering the growing
number of faithful in Latin America and
especially in Africa, issues of overpopu
lation and AIDS affect the Catholic
Church as much or more than anybody
else. A blind condemnation of tried-and
true methods of decelerating population
growth and slowing the epidemic is just
that blind.
And then there is the ever-present
issue of homosexuality — or, as
Ratanger described it in the late '80s, an
"intrinsic moral evil" and a "disorder."
In this day and age, when many modern
ized countries are on the verge of grant
ing same-sex marriage (knock on wood),
to have the spiritual leader of a billion
people — many of whom are certainly
gay — label homosexuality as "evil" is.
well, intrinsically absurd. I was hoping —
and even praying — that the conclave
could sack up and for once give Chris
tianity an air of tolerance. Excuse the
brief theological tangent, but at what
point will the church actually accept and
live up to one of its central tenets: "we are
all God's children"?
Ultimately, though, the most glaring
qualm I have about this new pope is not
his advanced age, not his being Euro
pean rather than Latino or African, not
his conservative convictions regarding
birth-control, not his stance on homosex
uality and certainly not his resemblance
to Darth Vader'sdark lord. It is rather his
steadfast belief, in his own words, that
"only in the Catholic Church is there
eternal salvation." Such a statement
should. I guess, be expected from the
leader of a religious faith — a leader who
is wholeheartedly devoted to his faith
(hopefully). However, the pope has be
come more than just a symbol of a uni
tary religion, but has, whether we like it
or not, become a moral role model for all
people. And such a man should not
make such exclusionary statements, but
should do everything he can to unite.

sues in today's world —we don't need
