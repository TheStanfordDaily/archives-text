Armenian genocide is historical fact
As an alumnus, a former ASSU senator and an Armeni
an American, I am troubled by The Daily's reaction to the
Undergraduate Senate's Armenian Genocide resolution.
The Senate has adopted similar bills in the past. For ex
ample, resolutions regarding Burmese human rights and
California migrant workers have been passed although
the issues did not specifically impact Stanford students.
In past years and this year. The Daily has printed
letters and op-eds containing denialist language re
garding the genocide, which has affected Stanford stu
dents just because they go to Stanford. Moreover.
Stanford students must be aware that the Turkish gov
ernment funds academic chairs at American universi
ties while it imprisons scholars in Turkey. Its recent
"gift" to UCLA was rejected by the faculty as an at
tempt to revise history.
The genocide is an historical fact, as researched and
concluded by unbiased organizations, including The New
York Times editorial board, and to dismiss it as full of po
litical nuances is shameful and academically dishonest.

Daily's coverage of Trouble with Islam' is suspect
I have to wonder why The Daily chose to "cover" my
recent presentation not with a news article, but with
an op-ed ("The Trouble with 'The Trouble With
Islam,' " April 20). This decision is especially suspect
in light of my offer to speak to The Daily before the
speech — an offer that went unanswered by the edi
tor-in-chief.
If I wallowed in the victim complex that my Muslim
detractors do, I would claim that I've been marginal
ized or, better still, silenced. But the truth is, 1 haven't
been. I'm energized by the Muslim woman who intro
duced me at my Stanford speech, as well as by the Mus
lim students who approached me afterwards to express
support for my core message: that no religion ought to
be immune from scrutiny when it comes to respecting
universal human rights.
It's a message that doesn't threaten people of faith,
only people of dogma.
Editor's Note: Irs had Manji called The Daily at 3
p.m. Monday and offered to meet with editors at 4
p.m. Given the extreme short notice, The Daily could

Rush is fun
As a member of Stanford's Greek
community, I feel compelled to re
spond to The Daily's editorial
"Make rush shorter, less intensive"
(April 21). Campus fraternities and
sororities have a legitimate interest
in taking great care when selecting
new members, and prospective
members deserve an opportunity to
take their time when considering
whether to join. Joining a fraternity
or sorority is a lifelong commitment
to that organization and its values: It
is a decision to be made with care and
deliberation. Students aren't just se
lecting who they're going to party
with or live down the hall from.
Stanford's policy of collective re
sponsibility holds that members of
Greek organizations are all responsi
ble for the conduct of each individu
al member. This should cause active
and prospective members alike to

take Greek recruitment even more
seriously than the undeniably in
tense and time-consuming process of
joining a campus a capella group or
theatrical production. In light of
these realities, rush may be, if any
thing, unreasonably short.
Finally, while smashing a car with
the Delta Kappa Epsilons or throwing
things off Sigma Nu's b&lcony is cer
tainly exhilarating. The Daily is mis
taken to call the laid-back atmosphere
of rush process "intense," and it's hard
to imagine "in depth interviews" mak
ing anything less stressful for the par
ticipants. Nor is rush necessarily the
be-all-end-all of recruitment; Sigma
Phi Epsilon, for example, continues to
recruit throughout the spring, and up
perclassmen join year round.
In fact, if The Daily is going to in
sist on labeling Greek recruitment an
"application process," it will have to
admit that rush is among the least
"difficult and grueling" processes a
Stanford student has to endure. I
went to rush events every night my
freshman year because there was
free food and exciting things to do.
The Daily's editorial board should
lighten up; rush is fun.
