Armenian genocide is historical fact
As an alumnus, a former ASSU senator and an Armeni
an American, I am troubled by The Daily's reaction to the
Undergraduate Senate's Armenian Genocide resolution.
The Senate has adopted similar bills in the past. For ex
ample, resolutions regarding Burmese human rights and
California migrant workers have been passed although
the issues did not specifically impact Stanford students.
In past years and this year. The Daily has printed
letters and op-eds containing denialist language re
garding the genocide, which has affected Stanford stu
dents just because they go to Stanford. Moreover.
Stanford students must be aware that the Turkish gov
ernment funds academic chairs at American universi
ties while it imprisons scholars in Turkey. Its recent
"gift" to UCLA was rejected by the faculty as an at
tempt to revise history.
The genocide is an historical fact, as researched and
concluded by unbiased organizations, including The New
York Times editorial board, and to dismiss it as full of po
litical nuances is shameful and academically dishonest.

Daily's coverage of Trouble with Islam' is suspect
I have to wonder why The Daily chose to "cover" my
recent presentation not with a news article, but with
an op-ed ("The Trouble with 'The Trouble With
Islam,' " April 20). This decision is especially suspect
in light of my offer to speak to The Daily before the
speech â€” an offer that went unanswered by the edi
tor-in-chief.
If I wallowed in the victim complex that my Muslim
detractors do, I would claim that I've been marginal
ized or, better still, silenced. But the truth is, 1 haven't
been. I'm energized by the Muslim woman who intro
duced me at my Stanford speech, as well as by the Mus
lim students who approached me afterwards to express
support for my core message: that no religion ought to
be immune from scrutiny when it comes to respecting
universal human rights.
It's a message that doesn't threaten people of faith,
only people of dogma.
