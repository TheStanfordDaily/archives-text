## Hillel’s role in Irshad Manji event misconstrued 
### ADINA DANZIG 
Omar Shakir's mischaracterization and mis
representation of the Irshad Manji event and
Hillel's program ("The Trouble with The Trou
ble With Islam,' " April 20) is troubling. But
what is more disturbing is The Daily's irrespon
sible and biased coverage. While The Daily had
advance notice of the Irshad Manji event that
took place Monday evening, the paper elected
not to cover it with a news story in Tuesday's
paper. Yet on Wednesday, The Daily published
a biased OpEd about the program. While opin
ion pieces are critical to quality discourse, The
Daily is also supposed to be a source of news.
How can a reader evaluate Shakir's opinion if
there is no news coverage of Manji's presenta
tion? The Daily's actions degrade The Daily and
insult its readership.
Regarding the planning of the event, it is strik
ing to me that Shakir noted how the event was
planned "according to most sources," yet did not
check his facts by speaking with someone at Hillel.
While Hillel indeed was the organization contact
ed by Manji's publicist alerting us to her Bay Area
visit, Hillel initially served as a conduit toother or
ganizations on campus to inform them of her pos
sible appearance and encourage others to help
make her appearance possible, as it seemed Manji
— a bestselling author who has spoken at scores
of campuses and other venues in the United States
and Canada, who has been acclaimed by OUT

Magazine and Thomas Friedman, and who was
commended on International Women's Day last
month — was an author the Stanford community
might want to hear. Based on a similar assessment,
the Stanford Bookstore, the Women's Center, the
Lesbian, Bay, Bisexual and Transgender center,
the Institute for Research on Women and Gen
der, the Stanford Jewish American Alliance and
Chabad at Stanford along with Hillel co-spon
sored this event because Manji articulates mes
sages relevant to these communities.
Significantly, the Bookstore initially commit
ted to being the primary sponsor of the event, as
the Bookstore viewed this as an opportunity to
bring to campus a widely acclaimed New York
Times best selling author. The Bookstore staff
members who made the initial commitment to
headline the event no longer work on campus.
The new staff was not informed of the background
on this event, became uncomfortable with the
level of controversy that might ensue. To the
Bookstore's credit, they did not withdraw from
the event, but they and no longer felt comfortable
as the primary sponsor.
Shakir made unfair and unfounded accusations
that Hillel sanctions attacks on Islam. Nothing
could be further from the truth. Hillel in fact
viewed Manji's visit as an opportunity to hear
from a faithful Muslim woman writer who has be
come an international personality through her ar
ticulate and fresh perspective on the need for
Muslims and non-Muslims alike to support a

movement for independent questioning within
Islam similar to what exists in other religious tra
ditions and once more prominent within Islam.
Omar notes the wonderful mission statement
outlined on Hillel's Web site. A visit to the Web
site calendar page will show that, indeed, Hillel
supports a plethora of programs that span a range
of Jewish and interfaith education, Shabbat and
holiday celebrations, social action initiatives, cul
tural events and social programs. Israel-related
programs include cultural programs, such as
music and dance, educational discussion pro
grams, such as "Israel at Heart," travel programs,
and political programs — which span the range of
political discourse in Israel from the left to the
right. These programs are part of our broad-based
programmatic activity that cqptinues to appeal to
Jewish and non-Jewish students on campus.
Notably, earlier this month, as part of Hillel's
social action programming, Hillel co-sponsored
"STANDFast for Darfur," along with Muslim
Student Awareness Network, the Islamic Stu
dents of Stanford University and Students Take
Action Now: Darfur, a Hillel-affiliated student
group. This program was an example of excellent
partnership to raise awareness and funds for the
people of Darfur. As part of our ongoing effort to
build bridges, Hillel looks forward to future pro
ductive coalition-building opportunities.
