# Shortstop Lappin leads Cardinal
## Queen of Diamonds 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
At the ready between second and
third base, Lauren Lappin eyes the bat
ter through her dark sunglasses. When
the ball is hit, it looks like a line drive into
leftfield. but Lappin is there, diving to
her right and springing up to fling the
ball to second base.
Another double play for Stanford's ju
nior shortstop, another Cardinal victory.
"You need good range and good
hands," Lappin said of what makes a
good shortstop. "And you need consis
tency. You get a lot of balls so you need
to be consistent physically and mental
ly."
Lappin has the skills to get the job
done. In the field, she has more assists
than anyone else on the team, boasts a
.948 fielding percentage and leads the
squad with seven double plays turned.
She is also one of the Cardinal's most en
tertaining players to watch; never afraid
to get dirty, she dives and spins to make
catches.
But Lappin is more than simply a
great softball player. She has become a
leader on the team and the voice of ex
perience in a young infield, where the
Cardinal usually have a freshman on
each base and often in the circle. Always
modest, Lappin downplays her own im
portant role.
"Although they are young and inex
perienced, they play like upperclass
men," she said of the freshmen. "They
play with a high energy that I love, so it's
easy to be a leader. I think the key is to
be vocal. You have to talk to the out
fielders and the infielders and you need

to know what is going on and what the
situation is."
Under her guidance, the team has a
fielding percentage of .975 and is com
mitting less than one error per game.
"It is almost like having a coach on
the field," head coach John Rittman
said. "Lauren is somebody who under
stands the Xs and Os of the game, but
also knows what it takes to win. That re
ally rubs off on the rest of the team. She
is somebody who works hard and loves
the sport and she is a great person to
have on the field."
When she is not making acrobatic
catches and turning double plays. Lap
pin also leads the Cardinal offense with a
team-high .383 batting average. Al
though she has only 22 RBI this season
— half as many as freshman powerhouse
Michelle Smith — Lappin has crossed
the plate 44 times, accounting for nearly
a fifth of the team's offensive output. She
has one of the squad's highest on-base
percentages and is a quick and smart
runner who leads the team with seven
stolen bases.
For her excellence in the field, in the
batter's box and running the bases, Lap
pin has received many honors in her first
two and a half years on the Farm and is
in line for more this season. As a sopho
more, she was a first-team All-Pacific-10
Conference pick. Pacific Region first
team selection, second team Ail-Ameri
can and named to the NCAA Region
All-Tournament Team.
Before the beginning of her junior
campaign, Lappin was named to the 50-
person preseason watchlist for USA
