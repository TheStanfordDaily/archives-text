## Jeff Dorman Sucks! Folks, my name isn't Spencer 
### 
Well, as April 24th rolls around, it's that
time of the year again. Upon the an
nual commemoration of the Armeni
an Genocide, Armenians around the world
plead for Turkey to recognize that it killed 1.5
million Armenians in the early 20th century,
Turks cowardly allege that the genocide never
happened and Americans listen to both sides,
only to go back to looking for the remote buried
in the couch.
Not this year.
People, my first name isn't Spencer. My full
name is Aram Spencer Baron Porter. Two of
those names are Armenian ("Aram" and
"Baron," the latter shortened from "Baronian,"
for those of you scoring at home), representing
the half of my heritage that comes from the land
of lamb, rice pilaf and more lamb.

So, fed up with people say
ing, "Armenia, that's not a
country!" and/or "Why are
you so hairy?" I'm going to
take on The Daily's editorial
hoard to show how Armenian
culture is "campus-related." I
mean, if Hillel has a house on
the row and MEChA receives
special fees, it's not much to
ask the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate to make Stanford

community members aware of the first geno
cide of the 20th century, one that decimated Ar
menian culture, families and ways of life.
Therefore, in attempt to force the issue, and
to show that even you (yes, you!) know a few
Armenians in this world, I offer you the top 10
Armenian sports stars in history.
No. 10: Garo Yepremian.
The famed Miami Dolphins Super Bowl
Kicker describes how he learned about college,
as quoted in The Sporting News: "[My brother]
called me and said, 'Look, you always wanted to
get a formal education, and if you come to the
States and kick a football, you can get a free ed
ucation.'"
"I said, 'You mean I can come to America
and kick a football and get four years of college
free?' He said yes, and I said, 'Well, this is a
great country.' Yepremian and his brother prac
ticed for six weeks before finding out he was too
old to start college."
One of the best NFL placekickers of all time,
and a man who played in the first football game
he saw. I give you the great Garo Yepremian.
No. 9: Steve Bedrosian.
"Bedrock" was a stellar reliever through his
15-year baseball career, winning the Cy Young


Spencer Porter
award in 1987 after saving 40 games
for the Phillies. I have nothing funny
to say here, so I'll move on.
No. 8: Cher.
Yeah, OK, so she's not an athlete.
But really, what would a list of fan
tastic Armenians be without Cher?
And yes, I do believe in life after love.
"Cher"ilyn Sarkissian.
No. 7: Youri Djorkaeff.
Djorkaeff, a striker for the French
National soccer team that won the
World Cup in 1998, comes in at num
ber seven. As the first entry on the list
without the traditional "ian" or
"yan" ending to his last name, I grant
Youri the official "I didn't know you
were Armenian!" award. Congratu
lations, Youri!
No. 6: Principal Seymour Skinner
from"The Simpsons."
Yeah, OK, so he's not much of
an athlete either. But when the
real Seymour Skinner showed up
in Springfield, and the principal we
know and love was revealed to be
Armen Tanzarian. he rode a mean
Harley straight out of town. That
probably requires some skill,
doesn't it? Hey man. there aren't
many Armenian athletes, lay off
me.
No. 5: Jerry Tarkanian.
The former UNLV and Fresno
State basketball coach is remem
bered for many accomplishments,
the greatest being his 1990 Runnin'
Rebels that won the National Cham
pionship. And because I like to pre
sent all my Armenian brethren in a
positive light, I'm going to casually
skip over his NCAA recruiting viola
tions right... here
No. 4: Raffi!
Okav, seriously, this will be the

last non-athlete on the list, but who
doesn't love Raffi, the fantastic chil
dren's singer. While I'm talking
about Armenian non-athletes, may I
also offer Arsinoe Baron, my grand
mother, who not only offered pre
draft advice to Eli Manning in a past
column, but for many years woke up
at absurd hours to bounce along with
Denise Austin or "Body by Jake.'' A
true inspiration to us all. and the only
woman who still gets a hug when she
calls me "chunky."
No. 3: Ara Parseghian.
The famed Notre Dame football
coach checks in at number three,
mostly due to his two national cham
pionships and coach of the year
award in 1964. However, even with a
career coaching record of 170-58-6,
he lives on in movie magic as the
coach of the Irish when "Rudy"
Ruettiger walked on to the team.
No. 2: Garry Kasparov.
Kasparov, a chess grandmaster by
the age of 17, has been the world
champion since 1984, retiring recent
ly to focus on Russian politics. In re
cent news, Kasparov was beaten over
the head by a former fan, who was
dismayed that the chess grandmaster
chose politics over chess. The
weapon used in the beating was, iron
ically, a chessboard, which had just
been signed by Kasparov.
No. 1: Andre Agassi.
Image is everything, people, and
Andre Agassi, a very handsome man
if I may say so myself, embodies that
to the fullest. An Armenian who was
once hairy, but has lost some follicu
lar luster in recent years, Agassi has
won every Grand Slam tournament
and a gold medal in the Olympics,
making him one of the tennis greats
and the greatest Armenian athlete of
all time.

Aram Spencer Huron Porter, a senior,
is Armenian (no kidding). Say

plead for Turkey to recognize that it killed 1.5
million Armenians in the early 20th century,
Turks cowardly allege that the genocide never
happened and Americans listen to both sides,
only to go back to looking for the remote buried
in the couch.
Not this year.
People, my first name isn't Spencer. My full
name is Aram Spencer Baron Porter. Two of
those names are Armenian ("Aram" and
"Baron," the latter shortened from "Baronian,"
for those of you scoring at home), representing
the half of my heritage that comes from the land
of lamb, rice pilaf and more lamb.

So, fed up with people say
ing, "Armenia, that's not a
country!" and/or "Why are
you so hairy?" I'm going to
take on The Daily's editorial
hoard to show how Armenian
culture is "campus-related." I
mean, if Hillel has a house on
the row and MEChA receives
special fees, it's not much to
ask the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate to make Stanford

community members aware of the first geno
cide of the 20th century, one that decimated Ar
menian culture, families and ways of life.
Therefore, in attempt to force the issue, and
to show that even you (yes, you!) know a few
Armenians in this world, I offer you the top 10
Armenian sports stars in history.
No. 10: Garo Yepremian.
The famed Miami Dolphins Super Bowl
Kicker describes how he learned about college,
as quoted in The Sporting News: "[My brother]
called me and said, 'Look, you always wanted to
get a formal education, and if you come to the
States and kick a football, you can get a free ed
ucation.'"
"I said, 'You mean I can come to America
and kick a football and get four years of college
free?' He said yes, and I said, 'Well, this is a
great country.' Yepremian and his brother prac
ticed for six weeks before finding out he was too
old to start college."
One of the best NFL placekickers of all time,
and a man who played in the first football game
he saw. I give you the great Garo Yepremian.
No. 9: Steve Bedrosian.
"Bedrock" was a stellar reliever through his
15-year baseball career, winning the Cy Young


Spencer Porter
award in 1987 after saving 40 games
for the Phillies. I have nothing funny
to say here, so I'll move on.
No. 8: Cher.
Yeah, OK, so she's not an athlete.
But really, what would a list of fan
tastic Armenians be without Cher?
And yes, I do believe in life after love.
"Cher"ilyn Sarkissian.
No. 7: Youri Djorkaeff.
Djorkaeff, a striker for the French
National soccer team that won the
World Cup in 1998, comes in at num
ber seven. As the first entry on the list
without the traditional "ian" or
"yan" ending to his last name, I grant
Youri the official "I didn't know you
were Armenian!" award. Congratu
lations, Youri!
No. 6: Principal Seymour Skinner
from"The Simpsons."
Yeah, OK, so he's not much of
an athlete either. But when the
real Seymour Skinner showed up
in Springfield, and the principal we
know and love was revealed to be
Armen Tanzarian. he rode a mean
Harley straight out of town. That
probably requires some skill,
doesn't it? Hey man. there aren't
many Armenian athletes, lay off
me.
No. 5: Jerry Tarkanian.
The former UNLV and Fresno
State basketball coach is remem
bered for many accomplishments,
the greatest being his 1990 Runnin'
Rebels that won the National Cham
pionship. And because I like to pre
sent all my Armenian brethren in a
positive light, I'm going to casually
skip over his NCAA recruiting viola
tions right... here
No. 4: Raffi!
Okav, seriously, this will be the

last non-athlete on the list, but who
doesn't love Raffi, the fantastic chil
dren's singer. While I'm talking
about Armenian non-athletes, may I
also offer Arsinoe Baron, my grand
mother, who not only offered pre
draft advice to Eli Manning in a past
column, but for many years woke up
at absurd hours to bounce along with
Denise Austin or "Body by Jake.'' A
true inspiration to us all. and the only
woman who still gets a hug when she
calls me "chunky."
No. 3: Ara Parseghian.
The famed Notre Dame football
coach checks in at number three,
mostly due to his two national cham
pionships and coach of the year
award in 1964. However, even with a
career coaching record of 170-58-6,
he lives on in movie magic as the
coach of the Irish when "Rudy"
Ruettiger walked on to the team.
No. 2: Garry Kasparov.
Kasparov, a chess grandmaster by
the age of 17, has been the world
champion since 1984, retiring recent
ly to focus on Russian politics. In re
cent news, Kasparov was beaten over
the head by a former fan, who was
dismayed that the chess grandmaster
chose politics over chess. The
weapon used in the beating was, iron
ically, a chessboard, which had just
been signed by Kasparov.
No. 1: Andre Agassi.
Image is everything, people, and
Andre Agassi, a very handsome man
if I may say so myself, embodies that
to the fullest. An Armenian who was
once hairy, but has lost some follicu
lar luster in recent years, Agassi has
won every Grand Slam tournament
and a gold medal in the Olympics,
making him one of the tennis greats
and the greatest Armenian athlete of
all time.

Aram Spencer Huron Porter, a senior,
is Armenian (no kidding). Say
"Parev " at porters@stanford.edu.
Well, as April 24th rolls around, it's that
time of the year again. Upon the an
nual commemoration of the Armeni
an Genocide, Armenians around the world
plead for Turkey to recognize that it killed 1.5
million Armenians in the early 20th century,
Turks cowardly allege that the genocide never
happened and Americans listen to both sides,
