Well, as April 24th rolls around, it's that
time of the year again. Upon the an
nual commemoration of the Armeni
an Genocide, Armenians around the world
plead for Turkey to recognize that it killed 1.5
million Armenians in the early 20th century,
Turks cowardly allege that the genocide never
happened and Americans listen to both sides,
only to go back to looking for the remote buried
in the couch.
Not this year.
People, my first name isn't Spencer. My full
name is Aram Spencer Baron Porter. Two of
those names are Armenian ("Aram" and
"Baron," the latter shortened from "Baronian,"
for those of you scoring at home), representing
the half of my heritage that comes from the land
of lamb, rice pilaf and more lamb.

So, fed up with people say
ing, "Armenia, that's not a
country!" and/or "Why are
you so hairy?" I'm going to
take on The Daily's editorial
hoard to show how Armenian
culture is "campus-related." I
mean, if Hillel has a house on
the row and MEChA receives
special fees, it's not much to
ask the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate to make Stanford

community members aware of the first geno
cide of the 20th century, one that decimated Ar
menian culture, families and ways of life.
Therefore, in attempt to force the issue, and
to show that even you (yes, you!) know a few
Armenians in this world, I offer you the top 10
Armenian sports stars in history.
No. 10: Garo Yepremian.
The famed Miami Dolphins Super Bowl
Kicker describes how he learned about college,
as quoted in The Sporting News: "[My brother]
called me and said, 'Look, you always wanted to
get a formal education, and if you come to the
States and kick a football, you can get a free ed
ucation.'"
"I said, 'You mean I can come to America
and kick a football and get four years of college
free?' He said yes, and I said, 'Well, this is a
great country.' Yepremian and his brother prac
ticed for six weeks before finding out he was too
old to start college."
One of the best NFL placekickers of all time,
and a man who played in the first football game
he saw. I give you the great Garo Yepremian.
No. 9: Steve Bedrosian.
"Bedrock" was a stellar reliever through his
15-year baseball career, winning the Cy Young
