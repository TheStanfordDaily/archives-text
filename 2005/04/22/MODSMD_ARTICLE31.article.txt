# Lacrosse heads east to face Greyhounds
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON STAFF WRITER 
Nearly 2,500 miles will separate the
women's lacrosse team and the Stanford
campus this Saturday, as Stanford (9-5) ven
tures to Baltimore, Md. to face the Loyola
Greyhounds (4-8). Ironically, many of the
Cardinal will feel as at home as they ever
have in their Stanford careers.
Both Stanford's leading scorer, junior at
tacker Sarah Bach, and Stanford's leading
stopper, freshman goalie Laura Shane, grew
up in Baltimore, as did head coach Michelle
Uhlfelder. From freshmen Shane,

Katharine Fox, Bri Ned, Amanda Soto and
Alicia Soto, to senior midfielder Kelsey
Twist, to the sophomores and juniors in be
tween, this Cardinal squad has a distinctive
Maryland flavor up and down the lineup.
All told. 12 of the 25 Cardinal on the ros
ter hail from the state of Maryland. With an
other eight Cardinal from the nearby states
of Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York and
Connecticut, 80 percent of the team stems
from the East Coast area, and this Satur
day's contest places all but five Cardinal
much closer to home than many of them
ever expected.
"This weekend is special in so many

ways," said junior attacker Megan Burker,
one of five Baltimore natives on the squad.
"My dad has made it to all but three of my
games at Stanford, which is huge, hut now
my grandparents can come, as can my high
school coach and all my family from back
home. Lots of the players feel the same way.
I've been waiting to come to Baltimore my
whole career, and my junior year, here we fi
nally come!"
Although one might expect the team to
divide along geographic lines, the players re
port the heavy Baltimore presence has not
dominated the team chemistry.
"I actually think, although we have big

group from Maryland, our team is one of
most diverse lacrosse teams in Division I,"
Burker said. "We have lots of girls from all
over the country, from Texas to Seattle, and
not many other teams can boast that.
"Also, the girls we do have from Balti
more were searching for something differ
ent in their college experience. There's cer
tainly no Baltimore clique. In fact, the girls
that aren't from Baltimore are special and
we get to learn a lot from them. They bring
something unique, something we wanted on
our college team."
