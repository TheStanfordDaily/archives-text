# Shafer shines for four seasons
## 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four years ago, junior driver and Stanford team captain
Scotti Shafer wrote up a list of pros and cons for two schools.
Not coincidentally, those two schools boasted the top two
women's water polo programs in the nation. Shafer, twice
named San Diego Flayer of the Year, had been strongly re
cruited by both programs and was torn between the two.
She could stay in southern California to play for power
house UCLA, or she could head north to Palo Alto and be
come a member of the Cardinal.
With the signing deadline fast approaching, Shafer was
close to choosing UCLA.
"I was pretty close," she said. "I was crazy about water
polo and was really one dimensional. UCLA was ranked
No. 1 and Stanford was No. 2. So I thought, 'OK. I want to
go No. I.' I wanted the best school for water polo and that
was all I was really thinking about."
But an 11 th-hour e-mail from Stanford head coach John
Tanner changed her mind, as well as the course of history for

both programs.
"If he hadn't written [that e-mail], I probably would've
gone to UCLA," Shafer said.
Instead, she now fills an invaluable role in the Cardinal's
march toward the postseason.
"She has a really clear sense of what other teams are try
ing to accomplish and does an excellent job countering any
move the other team might make," Tanner said. "She's very
alert in the water and has gotten better and better about un
derstanding what she ain do to stay a step ahead of some
one guarding her."
As one of the shortest members of the Cardinal squad at
5-foot-6, Shafer does not rely on size or strength to maintain
her edge over opponents. She takes advantage of her speed
and quickness to find offensive opportunities and to provide
tight coverage on defense. Those skills, combined with an
ability to make unpredictable decisions, make her an effec
tive player on both sides of the ball.
"To me, she's just a really scrappy player," Tanner said.

Despite standing at just 5-foot-6, senior Scotti Shafer has
used her unique vision and speed in the pool to become a
key part of the Cardinal's game plan.
"The thing she dties for our team Ls pro
vide a lot of movement. She provides a
lot of problems for defenders because
they can never assume that she's going to
stay still. It's really hard to play team de
fease when you have someone who's in
constant motion."
Developing as a water polo player
during her years at Carlsbad High
Schix)l, Shafer looked up to former Car
dinal standouts Brenda Villa and Margie
Dingeldein. as well as to UCLA star
Coralie Simmons. But it was Dingeldein,
a U.S. Olympian this past summer, who
influenced Shafer's playing style the
most.
"Margie and I are about the same size
and I always respected how well she
could get open and counterattack."
Shafer said. "I feel like I play really simi
larly to her. I probably move more than
most people on the team and drive inside
because I'm not going to score the ball
from out at seven meters."
Shafer's attention to detail and com
petitive drive help make her the ideal

team leader. Other members ol the Car
dinal squad will often look to Shafer for
advice on how to approach a certain de
fensive formation or where to pass in a
certain situation.
"I'm definitely more a leader by ex
ample," Shafer said. "1 think people re
spect me because they know that I know
the game really well. I've always paid
more attention to coaches since I've al
ways had the disadvantage of not being
big."
Shafer always kx)ks to improve her
knowledge of the game and spends
hours watching video to become more
familiar with her opponents. This knowl
edge benefits the entire team during
pregame strategy discussions.
Despite playing against players big
ger and stronger than she, Shafer brings
a calm composure to the pool.
"She's been around the high levels of
our sport for quite awhile, and she
doesn't seem to be daunted by any chal
lenge," Tanner said. "The fact that she's
so tenacious is inspiring to the team. The
bigger the game, the more she seems to
be in her element. Her smile just gets big
ger and brighter when we're getting
ready for important games."
With frequent words of wisdom,
Shafer's high sch(x>l coach guided the de

velopment of her markedly persistent at
titude. Shafer said the scope of his guid
ance extended far beyond water polo.
"He used to give us little quotes,"
Shafer said, "and he always [men
tioned] Churchill's saying, 'Never,
never, never give up.' Whenever 1 get
down I just think of that. But he also
kind of inspired me to want to go to col
lege, and my being here has a lot to do
with his influence."
If Shafer had chosen UCLA over
Stanford four years ago, it would be
hard to argue that she had made the
wrong choice. Not only would she have
become a member of the top-ranked
program in the nation, but she would
have joined many of her Junior Nation
al squad teammates in the process. Her
two closest friends on the team, Kelly
Rulon and Krishna Kunkel, signed on
with the Bruins.
But considering Shafer's track
record as a consistent and reliable
water polo decision-maker, it would be
safe to conclude that she made the right
choice in deciding to come to Stanford.
As Stanford enters its end-of-the-sea
son tournaments, Shafer and her Car
dinal teammates hope to make that de
cision pay off — with the 2005 national
championship title.a

influenced Shafer's playing style the
most.
"Margie and I are about the same size
and I always respected how well she
could get open and counterattack."
Shafer said. "I feel like I play really simi
larly to her. I probably move more than
most people on the team and drive inside
because I'm not going to score the ball
from out at seven meters."
Shafer's attention to detail and com
petitive drive help make her the ideal

team leader. Other members ol the Car
dinal squad will often look to Shafer for
advice on how to approach a certain de
fensive formation or where to pass in a
certain situation.
"I'm definitely more a leader by ex
ample," Shafer said. "1 think people re
spect me because they know that I know
the game really well. I've always paid
more attention to coaches since I've al
ways had the disadvantage of not being
big."
Shafer always kx)ks to improve her
knowledge of the game and spends
hours watching video to become more
familiar with her opponents. This knowl
edge benefits the entire team during
pregame strategy discussions.
Despite playing against players big
ger and stronger than she, Shafer brings
a calm composure to the pool.
"She's been around the high levels of
our sport for quite awhile, and she
doesn't seem to be daunted by any chal
lenge," Tanner said. "The fact that she's
so tenacious is inspiring to the team. The
bigger the game, the more she seems to
be in her element. Her smile just gets big
ger and brighter when we're getting
ready for important games."
With frequent words of wisdom,
Shafer's high sch(x>l coach guided the de

velopment of her markedly persistent at
titude. Shafer said the scope of his guid
ance extended far beyond water polo.
"He used to give us little quotes,"
Shafer said, "and he always [men
tioned] Churchill's saying, 'Never,
never, never give up.' Whenever 1 get
down I just think of that. But he also
kind of inspired me to want to go to col
lege, and my being here has a lot to do
with his influence."
If Shafer had chosen UCLA over
Stanford four years ago, it would be
hard to argue that she had made the
wrong choice. Not only would she have
become a member of the top-ranked
program in the nation, but she would
have joined many of her Junior Nation
al squad teammates in the process. Her
two closest friends on the team, Kelly
Rulon and Krishna Kunkel, signed on
with the Bruins.
But considering Shafer's track
record as a consistent and reliable
water polo decision-maker, it would be
safe to conclude that she made the right
choice in deciding to come to Stanford.
As Stanford enters its end-of-the-sea
son tournaments, Shafer and her Car
dinal teammates hope to make that de
cision pay off — with the 2005 national
championship title.a
Four years ago, junior driver and Stanford team captain
Scotti Shafer wrote up a list of pros and cons for two schools.
Not coincidentally, those two schools boasted the top two
women's water polo programs in the nation. Shafer, twice
named San Diego Flayer of the Year, had been strongly re
cruited by both programs and was torn between the two.
She could stay in southern California to play for power
house UCLA, or she could head north to Palo Alto and be
come a member of the Cardinal.
With the signing deadline fast approaching, Shafer was
close to choosing UCLA.
"I was pretty close," she said. "I was crazy about water
polo and was really one dimensional. UCLA was ranked
No. 1 and Stanford was No. 2. So I thought, 'OK. I want to
go No. I.' I wanted the best school for water polo and that
was all I was really thinking about."
But an 11 th-hour e-mail from Stanford head coach John
Tanner changed her mind, as well as the course of history for

both programs.
"If he hadn't written [that e-mail], I probably would've
gone to UCLA," Shafer said.
Instead, she now fills an invaluable role in the Cardinal's
march toward the postseason.
"She has a really clear sense of what other teams are try
ing to accomplish and does an excellent job countering any
move the other team might make," Tanner said. "She's very
alert in the water and has gotten better and better about un
derstanding what she ain do to stay a step ahead of some
one guarding her."
As one of the shortest members of the Cardinal squad at
5-foot-6, Shafer does not rely on size or strength to maintain
her edge over opponents. She takes advantage of her speed
and quickness to find offensive opportunities and to provide
tight coverage on defense. Those skills, combined with an
ability to make unpredictable decisions, make her an effec
tive player on both sides of the ball.
"To me, she's just a really scrappy player," Tanner said.

Despite standing at just 5-foot-6, senior Scotti Shafer has
used her unique vision and speed in the pool to become a
key part of the Cardinal's game plan.
"The thing she dties for our team Ls pro
vide a lot of movement. She provides a
lot of problems for defenders because
they can never assume that she's going to
stay still. It's really hard to play team de
fease when you have someone who's in
constant motion."
Developing as a water polo player
during her years at Carlsbad High
Schix)l, Shafer looked up to former Car
dinal standouts Brenda Villa and Margie
Dingeldein. as well as to UCLA star
Coralie Simmons. But it was Dingeldein,
a U.S. Olympian this past summer, who
influenced Shafer's playing style the
most.
