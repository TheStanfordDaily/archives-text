# Shafer shines for four seasons

### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four years ago, junior driver and Stanford team captain
Scotti Shafer wrote up a list of pros and cons for two schools.
Not coincidentally, those two schools boasted the top two
women's water polo programs in the nation. Shafer, twice
named San Diego Flayer of the Year, had been strongly re
cruited by both programs and was torn between the two.
She could stay in southern California to play for power
house UCLA, or she could head north to Palo Alto and be
come a member of the Cardinal.
With the signing deadline fast approaching, Shafer was
close to choosing UCLA.
"I was pretty close," she said. "I was crazy about water
polo and was really one dimensional. UCLA was ranked
No. 1 and Stanford was No. 2. So I thought, 'OK. I want to
go No. I.' I wanted the best school for water polo and that
was all I was really thinking about."
But an 11 th-hour e-mail from Stanford head coach John
Tanner changed her mind, as well as the course of history for

both programs.
"If he hadn't written [that e-mail], I probably would've
gone to UCLA," Shafer said.
Instead, she now fills an invaluable role in the Cardinal's
march toward the postseason.
"She has a really clear sense of what other teams are try
ing to accomplish and does an excellent job countering any
move the other team might make," Tanner said. "She's very
alert in the water and has gotten better and better about un
derstanding what she ain do to stay a step ahead of some
one guarding her."
As one of the shortest members of the Cardinal squad at
5-foot-6, Shafer does not rely on size or strength to maintain
her edge over opponents. She takes advantage of her speed
and quickness to find offensive opportunities and to provide
tight coverage on defense. Those skills, combined with an
ability to make unpredictable decisions, make her an effec
tive player on both sides of the ball.
"To me, she's just a really scrappy player," Tanner said.

Despite standing at just 5-foot-6, senior Scotti Shafer has
used her unique vision and speed in the pool to become a
key part of the Cardinal's game plan.
