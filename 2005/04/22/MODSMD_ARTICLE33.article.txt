# Tennis takes on Pac-10 foes
## Warburg begins conference title defense with first round victory at league championships 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Four days. Four draws. Two titles?
The No. 21 Stanford men's tennis team began Pacific
-10 Conference Tournament play yesterday in Ojai, Calif.,
where the Cardinal are competing for individual titles in
the singles and doubles draws of the 105 th annual Ojai
Valley Tennis Tournament.
Taking a short break from the usual dual-match for
mat, the Cardinal (13-10, 4-3) sent eight players to com
pete in the historic tournament. Each of the eight teams in
the conference sent four players to compete in the singles
draw and two doubles teams to compete in the main dou
bles draw. The invitational draws for singles and doubles
have similar formats, with brackets of 32 and 16, respec
tively.
"The tournament's nice to get away from the rigors of
dual-match competition," head coach John Whitlinger
said. "You want to go down there and play as many match
es as possible, and you want to go down there and not get
injured. It's a great tournament, and there's great history
to it. It's an honor to compete in and an honor if you win."
While the Cardinal claimed fourth in team rankings in
the Pac-10, Stanford's chances for capturing both a singles
and a doubles title look good as senior Sam Warburg is the
defending Pac-10 singles champion, and Warburg and ju
nior KC Corkery are the defending NCAA doubles cham
pions. Warburg is currently ranked second in the ITA poll
after Baylor's Benedikt Dorsch. At No. 4, he and Corkery
are the highest ranked pair in the Pac-10.
While Warburg is the top-ranked singles player in the
Pac-10, No. 6 UCLA boasts Luben Pampoulov at No. 6
and Benjamin Kohlloeffel at No. 8. and has five singles
players ranked in the top 125.
After playing in his final home match in Tuesday's win
over Santa Clara, Warburg reminisced about his time at
Stanford.
"I love being out there; competing is always amazing.
Knowing that it was going to be the last time I played a
match for Stanford in that stadium, it definitely hit me
pretty hard. It still hasn't been able to sink in completely.
"My goal [now] is to go [to Ojai] and win the tourna
ment. I'd love to be able to defend my title, and I'm really
excited for the challenge."
While doubles play begins today, singles play began
yesterday and the Cardinal got off to a good start in the
main draw. Warburg picked up a 6-0, 6-2 win against
Southern California's Adam Loucks,
and sophomore James Wan ad
vanced to the next round as Roger
Matalonga of Arizona retired after
an injury. Senior Phil Sheng lost in a
close match to No. 12 Jamil Al-Agba
of USC by a score of 6-1, 2-6, 6-3.
Corkery withdrew from singles play
in the first round.
In the second round. Warburg
picked up a 6-2,6-2 win over Califor
nia's Daniel Sebescen.
Junior Jon Wong, sophomores
Eric McKean and Dave Ryan and
freshman Phil Kao all competed in
the invitational singles draw. The
sophomore roommates were dealt
straight-set losses and Wong lost a
tight three-setter. Kao was the only
Cardinal in the invitational draw to
advance to the following round, earn
ing a 6-1, 6-0 win against Arizona's
Tim Mullane. The freshman then
won his next round 6-4. 6-2 against
Eric Pickard of Oregon.
In the main doubles draw, the de
fending NCAA champions, and the
duo of Sheng and Wong, will com
pete for the Cardinal. McKean and
Wan will play together in the invita
tional draw as will Kao and Ryan.
Doubles play begins at 9 a.m.
Last year, Corkery teamed up with
James Pade, a junior who is red-shirt
ing, and the duo lost 8-3 in the finals to
UCLA's Philipp Gruendler and Pam
poulov. Corkery and Pade also lost in
the finals their freshman year.
"I feel like if I don't win Pac-lOs,
it's going to be disappointing," Cork
ery said. "I've lost in the finals of that
tournament four times now. It's real
ly kind of frustrating — getting to the
finals isn't going to be enough any
more."
Following Corkery and Warburg,
the next highest ranked pair in the
conference is Cat's Patrick Briaud
and Conor Niland, who are currently
ranked 12th. Washington's Daniel
Chu and Alex Slovic are ranked 15th.
"Normally at this time of the year,
at least for the past two years, people
have been worn down as we're gear
ing up for NCAAs," Corkery said. "I
feel like we've always been [a little]
mentally and strategically (tired] at
this point in the season, especially
after going through the Pac-10 sched
ule. But this year doesn't seem to be
that way. We seem pretty enthusiastic
about improving and getting better,
and hopefully we'll use that energy
and keep it going throughout the
NCAAs."

Chu and Alex Slovic are ranked 15th.
"Normally at this time of the year,
at least for the past two years, people
have been worn down as we're gear
ing up for NCAAs," Corkery said. "I
feel like we've always been [a little]
mentally and strategically (tired] at
this point in the season, especially
after going through the Pac-10 sched
ule. But this year doesn't seem to be
that way. We seem pretty enthusiastic
about improving and getting better,
and hopefully we'll use that energy
and keep it going throughout the
NCAAs."

Sophomores Eric McKean and James Wan will play as a doubles team in tfie
invitational draw tomorrow.
Four days. Four draws. Two titles?
The No. 21 Stanford men's tennis team began Pacific
-10 Conference Tournament play yesterday in Ojai, Calif.,
where the Cardinal are competing for individual titles in
the singles and doubles draws of the 105 th annual Ojai
Valley Tennis Tournament.
Taking a short break from the usual dual-match for
mat, the Cardinal (13-10, 4-3) sent eight players to com
pete in the historic tournament. Each of the eight teams in
the conference sent four players to compete in the singles
draw and two doubles teams to compete in the main dou
bles draw. The invitational draws for singles and doubles
have similar formats, with brackets of 32 and 16, respec
tively.
"The tournament's nice to get away from the rigors of
dual-match competition," head coach John Whitlinger
said. "You want to go down there and play as many match
es as possible, and you want to go down there and not get
injured. It's a great tournament, and there's great history
to it. It's an honor to compete in and an honor if you win."
While the Cardinal claimed fourth in team rankings in
the Pac-10, Stanford's chances for capturing both a singles
and a doubles title look good as senior Sam Warburg is the
defending Pac-10 singles champion, and Warburg and ju
nior KC Corkery are the defending NCAA doubles cham
pions. Warburg is currently ranked second in the ITA poll
after Baylor's Benedikt Dorsch. At No. 4, he and Corkery
are the highest ranked pair in the Pac-10.
While Warburg is the top-ranked singles player in the
Pac-10, No. 6 UCLA boasts Luben Pampoulov at No. 6
and Benjamin Kohlloeffel at No. 8. and has five singles
players ranked in the top 125.
After playing in his final home match in Tuesday's win
over Santa Clara, Warburg reminisced about his time at
Stanford.
"I love being out there; competing is always amazing.
Knowing that it was going to be the last time I played a
match for Stanford in that stadium, it definitely hit me
pretty hard. It still hasn't been able to sink in completely.
"My goal [now] is to go [to Ojai] and win the tourna
ment. I'd love to be able to defend my title, and I'm really
excited for the challenge."
While doubles play begins today, singles play began
yesterday and the Cardinal got off to a good start in the
main draw. Warburg picked up a 6-0, 6-2 win against
Southern California's Adam Loucks,
and sophomore James Wan ad
vanced to the next round as Roger
Matalonga of Arizona retired after
an injury. Senior Phil Sheng lost in a
close match to No. 12 Jamil Al-Agba
of USC by a score of 6-1, 2-6, 6-3.
Corkery withdrew from singles play
in the first round.
In the second round. Warburg
picked up a 6-2,6-2 win over Califor
nia's Daniel Sebescen.
Junior Jon Wong, sophomores
Eric McKean and Dave Ryan and
freshman Phil Kao all competed in
the invitational singles draw. The
sophomore roommates were dealt
straight-set losses and Wong lost a
tight three-setter. Kao was the only
Cardinal in the invitational draw to
advance to the following round, earn
ing a 6-1, 6-0 win against Arizona's
Tim Mullane. The freshman then
won his next round 6-4. 6-2 against
Eric Pickard of Oregon.
In the main doubles draw, the de
fending NCAA champions, and the
duo of Sheng and Wong, will com
pete for the Cardinal. McKean and
Wan will play together in the invita
tional draw as will Kao and Ryan.
Doubles play begins at 9 a.m.
Last year, Corkery teamed up with
James Pade, a junior who is red-shirt
ing, and the duo lost 8-3 in the finals to
UCLA's Philipp Gruendler and Pam
poulov. Corkery and Pade also lost in
the finals their freshman year.
"I feel like if I don't win Pac-lOs,
it's going to be disappointing," Cork
ery said. "I've lost in the finals of that
tournament four times now. It's real
ly kind of frustrating — getting to the
finals isn't going to be enough any
more."
Following Corkery and Warburg,
the next highest ranked pair in the
conference is Cat's Patrick Briaud
and Conor Niland, who are currently
ranked 12th. Washington's Daniel
Chu and Alex Slovic are ranked 15th.
"Normally at this time of the year,
at least for the past two years, people
have been worn down as we're gear
ing up for NCAAs," Corkery said. "I
feel like we've always been [a little]
mentally and strategically (tired] at
this point in the season, especially
after going through the Pac-10 sched
ule. But this year doesn't seem to be
that way. We seem pretty enthusiastic
about improving and getting better,
and hopefully we'll use that energy
and keep it going throughout the
NCAAs."
