# Tennis takes on Pac-10 foes

### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
Four days. Four draws. Two titles?
The No. 21 Stanford men's tennis team began Pacific
-10 Conference Tournament play yesterday in Ojai, Calif.,
where the Cardinal are competing for individual titles in
the singles and doubles draws of the 105 th annual Ojai
Valley Tennis Tournament.
Taking a short break from the usual dual-match for
mat, the Cardinal (13-10, 4-3) sent eight players to com
pete in the historic tournament. Each of the eight teams in
the conference sent four players to compete in the singles
draw and two doubles teams to compete in the main dou
bles draw. The invitational draws for singles and doubles
have similar formats, with brackets of 32 and 16, respec
tively.
"The tournament's nice to get away from the rigors of
dual-match competition," head coach John Whitlinger
said. "You want to go down there and play as many match
es as possible, and you want to go down there and not get
injured. It's a great tournament, and there's great history
to it. It's an honor to compete in and an honor if you win."
While the Cardinal claimed fourth in team rankings in
the Pac-10, Stanford's chances for capturing both a singles
and a doubles title look good as senior Sam Warburg is the
defending Pac-10 singles champion, and Warburg and ju
nior KC Corkery are the defending NCAA doubles cham
pions. Warburg is currently ranked second in the ITA poll
after Baylor's Benedikt Dorsch. At No. 4, he and Corkery
are the highest ranked pair in the Pac-10.
While Warburg is the top-ranked singles player in the
Pac-10, No. 6 UCLA boasts Luben Pampoulov at No. 6
and Benjamin Kohlloeffel at No. 8. and has five singles
players ranked in the top 125.
After playing in his final home match in Tuesday's win
over Santa Clara, Warburg reminisced about his time at
Stanford.
"I love being out there; competing is always amazing.
Knowing that it was going to be the last time I played a
match for Stanford in that stadium, it definitely hit me
pretty hard. It still hasn't been able to sink in completely.
"My goal [now] is to go [to Ojai] and win the tourna
ment. I'd love to be able to defend my title, and I'm really
excited for the challenge."
While doubles play begins today, singles play began
yesterday and the Cardinal got off to a good start in the
main draw. Warburg picked up a 6-0, 6-2 win against
