# Pac-10 play starts in Ojai
## Women still undefeated 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Having brought another regular season to a
perfect close, members of the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team (21-0,12-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) are about to face a month-long lapse in play
before the NCAA Championship frenzy begins.
The Pac-10 Individual Championships, which
began yesterday in Ojai, Calif., mark the final four
days the Cardinal will be in action before hosting
an NCAA first-round match next month.
The collegiate competition runs alongside the
Ojai Valley Tennis Tournament, a highly regarded
amateur event steeped in more than a century of
history.
But assistant coach Frankie Brennan said he
feels no pressure as he approaches the tournament,
held at the Ojai Valley Athletic Club and Libbey
Park.
"It's not a, 'God, we really need to win' kind of
tournament," Brennan said. "It's a time (to focus
on J the girls. We coach a little bit, gauge our
progress and enjoy our time together."
Deciding to enter the 32-player singles draw is
usually left up to the individual players. This year,
junior Alice Barnes, sophomores Theresa Logar
and Anne Yelsey and freshman Whitney Deason
chose to represent the Cardinal in the main draw.
All four Cardinal defeated their first-round op
ponents. No. 22 Barnes (21-7) conceded one game
to Arizona State's Kady Pooler in a swift conquest
ending 6-1,6-0.
No. 49 Logar (24-3) had a tightly tuned run of
her own, ousting the Sun Devils' Jocelyn Burkett,
6-2,6-2.
No. 46 Deason (29-3) cruised past Arizona's
Stephanie Balzert, 6-3,6-4.
Yelsey (22-5) survived the Wildcats' No. 86
Maja Mlakar in three sets, 6-3,3-6,6-0.
Falling to 17-12 this season. No. % Pooler has
now come up short against three Cardinal foes.
Logar unseated her twice at No. 3 singles in league
match play, including a three-set battle marked by
unforgiving weather conditions in Tempo, Ariz., in
March.
Burkett has fared no better, slipping to a 15-16
record after losing her third match to the Cardinal.
In the invitational bracket, Stanford's Kara
Guzman, Joanna Kao and Jessica Leek also
stepped up to play. Leek, a junior, is seeing her first
match play since going abroad to Florence, Italy,
earlier this year.
No. 10 Amber Liu, a junior and two-time de
fending NCAA Singles Champion, will sit out the
tournament for the second year in a row.
"For me personally, I prefer to stay at Stanford
and rest up for NCAAs," said Liu, who is 14-3 this
season. "But for the other girls, it's a great oppor

tunity to take on some league opponents they don't
face in the regular lineup."
For No. 23 senior Erin Burdette, missing the
Ojai action dye to an aggravated shoulder injury
strikes a more personal chord.
"Having lived in Ojai my junior year of high
school, I was a little hummed that I was unable to
play the Pac-10 Individuals," Burdette said. "I re
ally enjoy that tournament and visiting the small
town."
Burdette's absence has caused a shuffling of
Stanford's doubles teams, as she usually competes
in the No. 1 position with Barnes. Despite their re
cent struggles, the veteran duo is celebrated for
Burdette's powerful serve and Barnes' great an
gled shots.
Barnes and Burdette (19-6) reached two indi
vidual tournament finals earlier in the season.

title, while clinching Pac-10 Indoor honors.
On Wednesday, Burdette said that she hadn't
been able to hit a ball in the last 10 days, but she was
looking forward to her tentative return to the
courts yesterday.
No. 45 freshman Lejia Hodzic (18-5) also re
mained on the Farm after suffering an ankle injury
in last Saturday's match against No. 21 California.
While some members of the Stanford lineup try
their luck in Ojai and others bide their time at the
Farm, team solidarity endures as the squad gears
up fora national showdown.
"(My] disappointment over missing Ojai was
short-lived, because I know NCAAs are the most
important event," Burdette said. "I will do every
thing 1 can to rest, recuperate and help the team
when the time comes."
