### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITER 
Ever hungry fora run at the national championship,
the men's volleyball team will have to wait another year
for its next chance.
On Wednesday, the season ended for the No. 10 Car
dinal (11-15, 10-13 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
with a loss to No. 8 Cal State-Northridge (18-13,10-12)
in the play-in match of the conference playoffs.
"We didn't play as well as we could have," Stanford
head coach Don Shaw said. "Northridge had something
to do with that — they played well."
In fact, Northridge senior Nils Nielsen recorded a ca
reer-high 29 kills in the match.
On the Cardinal's side of the net. departing senior
David Vogel led his team with 16 kills and 13 digs. Also
playing in his final game for Stanford, senior Craig Buell
contributed 12 kills and hit .550.
Redshirt senior Kevin Hansen finished his Stanford
career with 51 assists, making him only the third player
in Stanford history to record over 5,000 assists. With a
career total of 5,036 assists, Hansen will leave the Cardi
nal as the third-best setter in Stanford history.
In game one of the match. Vogel put away two con
secutive kills to bring the Cardinal back from a two
point deficit and tie the game at 6-6. Northridge re
sponded by jumping to a 15-9 lead, but the Stanford
squad refused to quit. After taking a timeout, the Cardi
nal closed the gap to 16-14. But the Matadors quickly re
covered, pulling ahead by eight at 27-19 and ultimately

winning 30-23.
Game two was a stalemate through 9-9, when a Vogel
ace gave Stanford some momentum. Later in the game,
Northridge reclaimed a five-point lead, but Vogel once
again brought the Cardinal back to 20-20, forcing two
Matador timeouts. Northridge gained a lead at 28-27,
but a kill by Stanford junior Ben Reddy and two Mata
dor hitting errors off Vogel's serve gave the Cardinal a
30-28 victory.
With the match tied 1-1, Northridge pulled to an 18-
13 lead in game three. The Stanford squad fought back
to tie the game 22-22. After the Matadors gained a 27-25
lead, the Cardinal came back to tie through 29-29. A pair
of Northridge blocks gave the Matadors a 31-29 win.
Knowing that the season was on the line. Stanford
came out strong early in game four, again keeping the
score tied through 9-9. But Northridge won the next four
points, bringing the score to 13-9 and prompting the Car
dinal to call a timeout. After Stanford came back to with
in two points at 18-16, the Matadors turned up the heat
and sailed to a 30-19 victory, closing out the match.
The two teams were almost even in terms of kills and
hitting percentages. Northridge had 66 kills at a .331 hit
ting percentage, while Stanford had 64 kills at .241. How
ever, the Matadors ended the match with nine aces
(compared to Stanford's one. courtesy of Vogel) and
14.5 team blocks to Stanford's seven.
"It's tough to end on a sour note, but our team has a
lot to be proud of," Shaw said. "Making the playoffs was
an improvement from last year, and the guys worked
hard day in and day out. I'm proud of them."
