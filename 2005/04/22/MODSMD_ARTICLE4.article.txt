vs.
STANFORD
Today, 6 p.m.
Smith Family Stad.

With California holding a
24-13 advantage in the all-time
series, the softball rivalry be
tween the Bears and Cardinal is
a bit lopsided. But the No. 7
Stanford squad (32-8, 6-2 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) doesn't care.
The Cardinal aren't con
cerned with the Golden Bears'
No. 2 ranking either. For them,
beating Cal (39-6, 6-3) these
next three days is simply about,
well, beating Cal.
"We try not to think about
who they are and what they're
ranked, but we definitely want
to beat them because they're
Cal," junior shortstop Lauren
Lappin said.
The Cardinal were swept by
the Bears in 2003 in three one
run games. Last season, Stan
ford stole a 5-3 win in Berkeley,
scoring four runs in the top of
the seventh to take the lead. At

home, the Cardinal were shut out twice, falling 1-0 and
6-0. This year, Stanford is looking to turn things
around.
"They're definitely one of the toughest teams in our
conference and one of the toughest teams in the nation,
so they always put up a good fight." Lappin said.
"We've always played right along with them but hope
fully we'll take some more games than usual this year."
The Bears have remained at or near the top spot in
Cal boasts two veteran hurlers

the polls with a lot of help from a pair of aces —
righthanders Kelly Anderson and Kristina
Thorson.
Thorson (17-4) added two more victories
last weekend and improved her season strike
out total to 159. Anderson, who recently
pitched a complete-game win, stands at 21-2.
The senior has pitched in three Women's Col
lege World Series.
"They're a veteran squad," Lappin said.
"They have a lot of seniors in their lineup that
have played all four years, so they have a lot of
experience. They do have some standout play
ers, people who are kind of hot with the bat
right now."
Lappin and the Cardinal must contend with
Cal catcher Haley Woods, who has 51 RBI this
season.
Third baseman Vicky Galindo, the Bear's
leadoff hitter, is also packing a punch with a
.381 batting average. Galindo is not only fast
around the bases, but she is skilled as both a
slapper and a power hitter.
"They're probably the two key sparks to [the
Bears'] lineup, so we're going to try to contain
them," Lappin said of Woods and Galindo.
The Bears played a make-up game on Mon
day against No. 9 Oregon State (29-7, 8-2) and
handed the Beavers their second conference
loss (the first was delivered by Stanford). OSU
still sits atop the Pac-10 standings, with Stan
ford in second and Cal at a close third.
With one month remaining in the regular

season, the Cardinal still have a series of Pac-10
teams to play, all of which are in the top 25.
"It's such a tough conference [that] it'll come
down to the last few games to determine the
conference champion," Lappin said.
The Cal matchup is not "do-or-die" accord
ing to Lappin, but bringing down the second
ranked Bears will help the Cardinal's postsea
son chances.
"Our whole season doesn't rely on these
three games," she said. "But they are very im
portant. They're central to winning the confer
ence and getting a good seed in the tournament,
so hopefully we are successful this weekend."
Led by Lappin's .383 batting average — .417
in league games — , Stanford leads the confer
ence in batting average. Lappin is followed by
senior catcher Leah Nelson (.377 overall),
freshman Michelle Smith (.345) and junior
Catalin Morris (.338). Smith, who has homered
her way to the top of the team RBI list, is hitting
.400 in Pac-10 games.
Righthanded freshman Becky McCullough
(13-2) takes the circle this weekend with a 1.80
ERA. Veteran teammate junior Laura Sever
son (13-4) heads into her start holding opposing
batters to a .197 average.
Cal wraps up a six-game roadtrip and Stan
ford comes back from its five games away when
they meet at Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadi
um today at 7 p.m. The teams then travel across
the bay to Levine-Friche Field for Saturday's
and Sunday's 1 p.m. starts.
