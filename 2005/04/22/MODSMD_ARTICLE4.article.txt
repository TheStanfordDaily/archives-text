STANFORD
Today, 6 p.m.

With California holding a
24-13 advantage in the all-time
series, the softball rivalry be
tween the Bears and Cardinal is
a bit lopsided. But the No. 7
Stanford squad (32-8, 6-2 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) doesn't care.
The Cardinal aren't con
cerned with the Golden Bears'
No. 2 ranking either. For them,
beating Cal (39-6, 6-3) these
next three days is simply about,
well, beating Cal.
"We try not to think about
who they are and what they're
ranked, but we definitely want
to beat them because they're
Cal," junior shortstop Lauren
Lappin said.
The Cardinal were swept by
the Bears in 2003 in three one
run games. Last season, Stan
ford stole a 5-3 win in Berkeley,
scoring four runs in the top of
the seventh to take the lead. At

home, the Cardinal were shut out twice, falling 1-0 and
6-0. This year, Stanford is looking to turn things
around.
"They're definitely one of the toughest teams in our
conference and one of the toughest teams in the nation,
so they always put up a good fight." Lappin said.
"We've always played right along with them but hope
fully we'll take some more games than usual this year."
The Bears have remained at or near the top spot in
