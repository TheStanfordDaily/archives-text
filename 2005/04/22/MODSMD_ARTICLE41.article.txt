# Job title inflation still spreads; Intermission editors promoted
## Marten and Vo senior editors, Tan zer awarded editor position

It's a nationwide epidemic that
shows no signs of slowing down.
While it might not he airborne or
even potentially lethal, critics argue
that it still has the potential to un
dermine all that corporate America
stands for.
Job title inflation might be a rela
tively new phenomenon, but that
doesn't mean it hasn't already enact
ed a "devastating toll" on organiza
tions around the country, according
to industry experts. Suddenly those
who were once simple secretaries
are now senior administrative office
managers. Those who were once
happy-go-lucky high school teachers
are now secondary education execu
tive instructional professionals.
But what's in a name, anyway?
Shakespeare might have thought that
an everyday handyman would smell
just as sweet as a micro-task oversight
assistant, but we beg to differ.
It's obvious that having a more
prestigious title changes other peo
ple's perceptions of the everyday
drudgey that makes up your 9-to-5.
So our question is, why couldn't it
also change yours?
For example, we were running
into a bit of a problem at Intermis
sion. Sam Tanzer, our beloved assis
tant editor, was feeling a bit "shaft
ed." He was doing most of the work
and yet Brendan Marten and Tam
Vo were the ones who each enjoyed
the coveted "editor" title.

What to do? It was clear some
thing had to be done. There was no
way in hell Brendan and Tarn were
going to give up their cush jobs so
that some young upstart hooligan
could get his deserved credit. And
there was no way that Sam was will
ing to continue working while not
being accorded the recognition he,
uhh, "deserved."
The solution soon became un
avoidably obvious to everyone at the
office.

Sam was shortly thereafter pro
moted to editor.
But then Brendan and Tam were
disgruntled. They had been at The
Daily for years, yet some asshole —
with the halls to have "Tanzer" as a
last name — was getting to be listed
as having the same status as them.
What to do?
Therefore, in order to statisfy the
dynamic duo, Brendan and Tam
were upgraded to senior editors.
In the end, Sam got the editor

title he rightfully earned. Brendan
and Tarn had their egos stroked and
retained their cush jobs. In other
words, everyone was a winner.
Thus, while job-inflation oppo
nents might point out how the con
tinual inflation of job titles will only
result in a relentlessly upgrade spiral
toward increasingly meaningless de
scriptions of people's work func
tions, we can only answer that, well,
the word's not out yet.
Being a "senior editor" still

sounds like hot shit for the moment,
just like how having $500 in the
bank made it sound like your family
was loaded back in the 19305. Sure,
a year or two from now everyone
might catch on. But they haven't
yet. Our titles still have currency.
And sometimes, it's only the "now"
aspect of life that really matters.
So until we're forced to "pro
mote" ourselves again, you can bet
we'll be milking this shit for all it's
worth.
