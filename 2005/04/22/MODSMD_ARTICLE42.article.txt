### TIM LIPUS ASSHOLE 
On Wednesday, Tim Lipus, Ass
hole, interviewed various unfortu
nate partygoers at EBF's 4 / 20
Happy Hour. Intermission told him
to research the Stanford communi
ty's views on each of the seven conti
nents. But Tim Lipus, Asshole,
would not be so easily controlled.
Tim Lipus, Asshole, approached a
very nice Girl In Black Top.
Tim Lipus Asshole: So, what's your
favorite continent?
Girl In Black Top: South America,
maybe?
TL, A: Not Africa?
GIBT: Hull?
TL, A: Are you saying you don't like
black people?
GIBT: What? That's completely un
fair.
TL, A: Your words, not mine.
Having visibly offended his first inter
viewee, Tim Lipus, Asshole, moved
on to a pair of unsuspecting girls near
by.
TL A: What's your favorite continent?
First Giil: (Sees open bag of Kettle
Chips nearby) Kettle Chips!
Second Girl: "The U.S.A.!"
TL A: This is too easy.
[Awkward pause]
First Girl: Wow, these chips are good.
This was no challenge at all. Tim
Lipus, Asshole, moved on. Soon, he
struck up a conversation with a Per
fectly Normal Guy.
TL, A: What's your favorite continent?
Perfectly Normal Guy: Antarctica.
TL, A: Why's that?
PNG: Why not?
TL, A: Is it because there are polar

bears there?
PNG: What?
TL, A: OH MY GOD! You thought
there were polar bears there! There
are no polar bears in Antarctica!
You moron!
PNG: You said that, not me.
TL, A: Whatever, moron.
Asshole, walked away
laughing hysterically to himself. He
soon encountered a Slightly Flushed
Asian Girl and stopped dead in his
tracks.
AG: Get back here.
TL, A: (Under his breath) Uh oh.
This isn't good.
AG: I'm here to deliver a message.
I'm supposed to tell you that [name
deleted] doesn't want you within
three feet of her.
TL, A: Um...
AG: What you did to her was com
pletely unacceptable. This time you
crossed the line. She is never speak
ing to you again.
TL, A: We 11...
AG: The concept of personal space is
not some fucking joke. It's a serious
issue.
TL, A: I know, but...
AG: And if you ever so much as
think of trying what you tried a sec
ond time, she's issuing a restraining
order.
TL, A: OK, OK, but hear me out. In
my defenseâ€”just listen to what 1
have to say, OK?
AG: Yes?
TL, A: It was really funny.
[Shocked and angry pause]
AG: (Glares) You just don't get it, do
you?
Indeed, he did not
get it at all In fact, we hope for your
sake that you never have to go through
the experience for yourself
Unless, of course, you like to laugh.
