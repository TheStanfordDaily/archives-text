## ‘A Lot Like’ every other love story 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
In the first five minutes of "A Lot Like Love" we meet our two
main characters, follow them onto an airplane and witness them
join the mile-high club (in the airplane lavatory, of course) without
ever exchanging a word. What a way to start a movie with a bang
Oliver (Ashton Kutcher)is a happy-go-lucky, mildly dim-

witted recent college grad with no job. no prospects, and

no girlfriend. It's the middle of the 1990s and he's busy

attempting to grow out of his pseudo-Kurt Cobain
phase when he meets the punked-out wannabe-
Courtney Love-r, Emily (Amanda Peet). She's on
the rebound from her latest guitarist-boyfriend
break-up, and looking fora quickself-esteem boost
— hence the need to seduce Oliver in the bathroom
at 30,000 feet. .. L

While the initial premise may seem a little flimsy, it works

as an adequate springboard for the somewhat unconventional re-

lationship that develops between Oliver and Emily. After the airplane

encounter, the two rendezvous briefly inNew York —
drinking, taking photographs <md making a bet about
whether Oliver will become rich and successful in the
next six years. He says he shanking on a little phenom
enon called "the Internet." I hear it's the next big thing
Taking its cues from the style of "When Harry Met
Sally," the film tracks the break - ups and make - ups
of Oliver and Emily through the next six years as
they change jobs, apartments, and lovers.

We see them survive bad acting au
ditioas, swank New Year's parties, and even the dot
com boom (and bust), but with each stumble in their personal

and professional lives, oar protagonists rush to get back together.
"A Lot like Love" does have its flaws, and it cannot extend beyond acer-

tain level of predictability. It often teeters on the edge of the ridiculous,
and falls definitively over the brink at the very end as the characters re-

alize that perhaps they mean more to each other than they ini-

tially thought But while the ending if the movie may be a

bit rough around its edges, the bulk of the film does a

good job of creatinga coherent ;ind entertaining story
. The most surprising part of "A Lot Like Love"
comes from its strong dialogue and good charac
terizations. Amanda Peet really excels as the
chain-smoking and enigmatic Emily. She emerges
to really drive the film and gives her character an

unexpected depth as the film progresses. Kutcher is

less commendable, but allows Oliver a genuine impish-

ness that is likeable enough. (Let's just say that he probably

won't be doing Shakespeare any time soon.) So. if 1 had to give
a definitive answer, I would say that "A Lot Like Love" is definite-

ly one of the top five Ashton Kutcher movies
I've ever seen. Maybe top three. Okay fine, it's
the best Ashton Kutcher movie I've ever seen.
It's surely deserving of the adjective "cute" and
if you're really aching fora "romantic" flick
that's worth a chuckle or two, I would say "A
Lot Like Love" just might be a lot like what
you're looking for.




Sex on a car: Check the suggestive placement
of Amanda Peet's hand. Now, take a moment
for this brief hypothetical exercise . . . imagine
that Ashton Kutcher is Peet and Peet is Kutcher.
"His" hand would be on "her" breast and "his"
other hand would be on "his" crotch. Hot.



For Christ's sake, they're in the middle of a
public parking bt. You'd think they'd show
some more restraint. Then again, it looks like
it's treating the both of them pretty well, so we
can't complain. What was this movie rated
again?
