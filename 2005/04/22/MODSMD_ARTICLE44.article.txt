## Sampling Continental Cuisine 
### BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION CUISINE EXPERT 
Let's face it: Food from around the world can be extremely delicious, but it's a royal pain to leave the country.
That's why we're happy to bring you our "Best of the Bay Continental Tour." Dine like a globe-trotter, minus the
shots and layovers. Come on, you didn't just think we'd be eating Treehouse for the rest of our lives... or did you?
