## 'Lennon' more like Yoko Ono Jukebox form falls flat 
### MERRITT FORREST BAER INTERMISSION CRITIC 
I will begin bluntly: T am sick of jukebox musicals. For
those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, a
"jukebox" musical is a show that uses a bunch of previously
written songs (often by the same composer or music group),
and ties them together with a loose plot.
Meet "Lennon." the new musical playing at the Or
pheum Theatre through May 14 that awkwardly tells the
story of John Lennon's life using many of his songs. I'm not
quite sure who to blame for this new wave of said jukebox
musicals. Most likely, it is the massive successes of "Mamma
Mia!" the "ABBA" musical, and "Movin' Out." the Billy
Joel musical, that have producers swarming like moths to a
flame around musicals of the jukebox variety.

However, in the past few years since "Mamma Mia!" arrived
on Broadway, no jukebox musicals have come close to eclipsing
its achievements (and I'm not talking about artistic achievements
of which there are none to be found in "Mamma Mia!")

"Lennon" begins just as you might expect — with a pop version
of "Imagine." The show employs a cast of nine, men and women of

different ages and races, who all play John Lennon at different points
throughout the production. When director/ author Don Scardino was trying
to figure out who might actually plav Lennon in a stage production, he real
ized that trying to bring Lennon back to life would be disastrous. So instead,
using the idea of unity beyond all boundaries, he chose a multiethnic cast that
would all portray Lennon.
In a theatrical device that comes off as forced and contrived, the actors all
pass around a pair of glasses to symbolize who is actually playing Lennon in
any given scene. Unfortunately, the entire show feels like a Disney candv
coated pop concert of Lennon's music. The stage is set up like a rock

concert — Natasha Katz's lighting is thrilling and is reminiscent
of the latest concert tour. The fact that most of the audience

learns nothing new and finds no intriguing insight into the life
of John Lennon speaks volumes about the lack of excite
ment in plot.
Speaking of plot, of which there is very little, I

would like to propose a new title for the show: Yoko Ono.
The show spends much of its two-and-a-half hours prais-

ing Lennon's mistress and wife. Describing the couple as
soulmates. showing Lennon cheating on her and re-

counting how the saintly Yoko took him back and made
him "a better man" seemed a little out of place in a musi
cal called "Lennon." What made this even more distract-

ing and awkward for me was my awareness that Yoko Ono
herself worked very closely on the project and was actually
in the audience watching the show. Understanding this
strange dynamic of self-praise was incredibly discomforting

for the audience.
However, for all of the mediocrity of plot, 1 must dispense lav
ish praise to the phenomenal cast. Straight from New York, this

cast is the best group of performers to gather onstage in San Fran
cisco this season. Many of the cast members are Tony award winners
or nominees, and they belt out the Lennon repertoire as though it was

written just for them.Marcy Harriell and Julia Murney sing with a pas
sion and presence that immediately takes you to the heart of Lennon's

words. These two vocal powerhouses represent the very best of what Broad
way has to offer — breathtaking and inspiring. Similarly. Will Chase and Chad
Kimball give performances that bring to mind the original cast of "Rent" —
pop with an edge. It is only in the hands of such versatile and ardent perform-

ers that the show really takes flight.The last 10 minutes of the production.

as they discuss Lennon's death, are incredibly captivating. If only the

other 110 minutes were equally as insightful.
