## Coachella: Kind of like Wood stock Half the hippies, twice the hipster 
### SAM TANZER INTERMISISON MUSIC GUY 
Every year, teenagers and 20-
somethings from all over the
world descend on Southern Cali
fornia and swarm around a little
town called Indio.
Indio itself is nestled in the
highly urbanized area between
Joshua State Park and something
called the "Salton Sea," and the
nearest city that shows up on
most maps is, um, Bakersfield.
OK. so maybe the area's not all
that developed, but people don't
exactly come to Indio to see the
local sights. For the past five
years, Indio has played host to a
desert rock music festival called
Coachella, and people come for
the music.
And they come in droves. Last
year more than 50,000 fans made
it to the two-day tent festival to
see the Radiohead, the Pixies and
the Cure, and this year's sixth-an
nual event boasts a lineup just as
impressive. So right now, get out
a pencil and mark off Saturday,
April 30 and Sunday, May 1 on
your calendar... or the back of
your hand, or whatever. But this
is important, not like that PWR 2
deadline. So do it now. Seriously.
Coachella awaits. But instead of
just reviewing
Coachella
this year,

we at Intermission decided it
would be a much better use of
profits from our Financial Mar
kets issue to bring you a preview
of the festival ahead of time. This
way, you'll be able to decide for
yourself if it's worth those 80
bucks a day for tickets or those
hours on the road each wav,

pies and decked-out teens will
gather will gather in Indio, lines
will form and the festival gates
will finally open at 11:00 am.
Look for headlines Coldplay,
Weezer and the Wilco —* an alt
rockers dreafrt. Know ymt've
listened to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot
so many times it skips. You're
roommate's tired of it and so are
we — it's time for the real thing.
For the more technologically
inclined, veteran performers The
Chemical Brothers will be there
as well, and they're sure to put on
a great show. Into the while goth
thing? How does Bauhaus sound.
We bet it sounds pretty g00d... if
you can get past the Primacy of
Marilyn Manson, that is. Like
shoegaze rock? Well, Sigur Ros
isn't coming (you can stop quiv
ering in excite
ment now),
but MB3 is.

And so is Four Tet. Prepare to be
amazed at the clashing rhythms...
and maybe a little confused, too.
Day one of Coachella has
pretty much everything you
could ask for. Day one alone, in
fact, would probably be the best
American music festival this
.year. But one-daujestivals just
aren't eaough for rabid fans
eager to set up tents neajr huge
stages and sleep under the stars
with thousands oi peers who S
"share their concern's and aspira
tions — you know, like where to
obtain tomorrow's beer, or how
to get that "damn Jim guy to stop
smoking all our weed." And one
day is certainly not enough for
Coachella.
■ Ifdiwrwftfowft't-hßve it; day ■
two does. This year, day two's
headliners rock a little harder
(not necessarily better) than day
one's —Nine Inch Nails head
lines day two. Hard rock fans
can't do much better than that,
except maybe by melding Led
Zeppelin and Metallica into one
ail-star super-band, the likes of
which the world has never known
... but enough of that. And re
member that band Prodigy,
those guys who gave you such
brilliant advice as "breathe" and
"smack my bitch up"?
Well, apparently they
still exist. And more
importantly, they're

ready to put on a hell of a show.
But day two isn't all about the
hard stuff. Singer / songwriter
Bright Eyes is there to steal the
hearts of countless girls, and new
acts like the Arcade Fire will
make their presence felt as well.
Don't forget prog-rockers The
Firery Furnace, and there's even
an assoiiiij&ent of such hip-hop
artists at Aesop Rock.
Hipjlries, beer, pot (unofficial
ly)* P petty milich any other drug
you can think of (even more un
officially), goths, punks, mods,
new age kids, teenagers, those
few creepy old guys, those not
so-attractive women who crowd
surf and take off their tops and
those blazing hot 22-year-olds
who do the <mme —Ooachella's
pretty much got everything.
They've bottled water for when
you get thirsty, and they're more
than happy to charge you two
dollars a bottle.
Even without the music,
Coachella would be a great time
for all but the most socially re
pressed Stanford students. Throw
the music into the mix and, well,
music festivals just don't get any
better than Coachella. So instead
of asking yourself if it's worth the
money and inconvenience, ask
yourself a couple other questions;
Do you like music? Do you enjoy
not being lame? If you answered
yes to either, Coachella is worth it.
