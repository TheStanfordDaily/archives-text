### ROXY SASS INTERMISSION SEX GODDESS 
Spring is here, and things are heating I
up. I'm not talking about the temperature •
outside. I'm talking about your discus- 1
sion sections. Yeah, that's right. I mean 1
that steamy, dreamy, hunk of teaching,
assistant. So what are you waiting for? (
Get your TA on the floor! Roxy Sass pre- 1
sents the authoritative guide to getting iti
on with your teaching assistants — orga-1
nized by subject for your convenience. 1

Computer Science
Find his apartment. He's in there, absorbed in a game of "Halo
2." Pry his hand off the joystick, and get your hands on his stick o'

joy. Provided with ample Mountain Dew,
these guys can go for hours. And those skin
ny, nerdy frames tend to be very flexible.
(Think lotus position .. .) On the other
hand, he hasn't lifted anything heavier than
a videocard fora while. You might have
to be on top.
Pick-up line to try: "I'd love to instanti
ate your structure."

Chemistry
Feeling the
chemistry be-

tween you and your TA? Who says
organic chem can't be orgasmic
chem? You spend every section
discussing Os ... oxygen atoms,
that is. Seriously, though, chemistry
TAs are a special breed. With all

their talk of energetic collisions, ex-

cited states, and the heat of are- t

action — Roxy can hardly keep

her skirt on. So go to your

TA's office hours. Turn

O-chem into Oh! Oh!

OHHHH! chem.

Pick-up line: i

"You're exciting my

electrons — want to try some
chemical bondage?"

PoliSci / Public Policy
They're sensitive, they're in
touch, they feel your pain. Plus,
they need to practice having clan
destine affairs before launching
their political careers. Add new
meanings to branches of govern
ment with "suspended congress"
and "congress of a cow". (That's
kama sutra, for the sexually illiter
ate among you.)

Pick-up line:
What's your
policy on sex
education?

IHUM
First of all, these are TFs, not
TAs, and they may have too
much self-respect to do it with a
student. They tend to be older,
and have a higher probability of
being married. (Not that that's
ever stopped Roxy ...) They're
more experienced in the art of
pleasure than your average grad
student. They're also a nice step
ping stone on your way to sleep
ing with professors. And, if a post
— coital discussion of the mean
ing of life is your cup of tea, full
speed ahead.
Pick-up line: "I love the hu-

manities . . .
I'm very fuzzy,
wanna feel?

Math
Math TAs
tend to be inter

national students. International stu
dents sometimes have accents. Ac
cents are hot. Therefore, math TAs
are hot. Gently remove his thick
glasses, stare deeply into those
eyes — and reach for his zipper. If
that fails, try to impress your TA with
your superior mathematical intelli
gence. (Note: Contrary to popular
belief, the equation "you +/ne = us"
is not in fact calculus.) However, the
integral of e A x definitely is. Think

about it.
Pick-up line:

"Could I inte-

grate your

natural ,

log?"






"Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some office hours
to attend."
