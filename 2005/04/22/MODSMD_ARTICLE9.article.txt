# Cyclists roll into tough races in Santa Cruz
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford cycling team travels to
Santa Cruz, Calif, this weekend for three
races over two days on a course reminis
cent of the steep rises and falls of the
Boardwalk rollercoaster nearby. There,
Stanford is looking to wrap up its regular
season with one more thrilling ride be
fore beginning preparation for the West
ern Collegiate Cycling Conference
Championships to be held next weekend
in Reno, Nev.
Saturday will consist of a Road Race,
including a 460-foot climb, and cyclists
will compete in a Hill Climb Time Trial
and an Individual Time Trial on Sunday.
Stanford is ahead of California atop the
WCCC Team Omnium standings —
rankings based on teams' best finishes
throughout the season — and has sever
al riders at or near the top of the Individ
ual Omnium standings for the Men's and
Women's A, Band C Divisions.
The final Omnium standings will not
be determined until after Conference
Championships, where team points will
be worth 1.5 times more than during the
regular season.
"We will do our best to focus on win
ning at least one event to widen our Om
nium points gap," said co-term masters
student Amber Rais, who races
Women's A and will compete in all three
races this weekend. Rais joined the team
midway through last season and is sec
ond in the Women's A standings.
Based on the Omnium scoring sys
tem, Cal cannot cut into Stanford's 14-
point lead until the Conference Champi
onships, but Stanford could widen its
lead by winning an event as a team in
Santa Cruz.
"The race is only an hour away, so it
provides individuals a chance to gain
some Individual Omnium points for
themselves," sophomore captain Rand
Miller said.
Miller, 12th in the Men's A standings,
said he felt good about the team's
chances during fall training, when team
members made daily rides through the
surrounding foothills and 60-mile week
end rides to the coast.
"This season has been an amazing
year for Stanford cycling as a whole, and
it has been exciting to watch the team de
velop into a cohesive, fun-loving and fast
group of cyclists," Miller said. "From the
very beginning of the year, I could tell
this group had potential."
That potential has blossomed into re
sults throughout the season, which began
on a surprisingly high note.
In early February, Rais, doctoral stu
dent David Pierce and Chris Montague-
Breakwell drove to San Diego to com
pete in the first race of the year. Riding
against schools that were fielding full
teams of cyclists, they expected little
more than to gain early-season experi
ence. Instead, they took second overall in

the Road Race, as Pierce and Montague-
Breakwell finished first and ninth, re
spectively, in the Men's A, and Rais took
top honors in the Women's A.
Pierce, in his sixth year with the team,
has worn the yellow jersey as the Men's
A Omnium leader throughout most of
the season and will compete in all three
races this weekend.
At the first team-targeted race of the
season at UC-Davis one week later,
Stanford sent approximately 35 riders
and earned top finishes in every event,
winning the weekend's top honors as a
team and continuing Stanford's rise to
the top of the team standings.
"We didn't make the Team Omnium
an explicit goal to begin with, but as the
season continues, it has become obvious
that this team has both the strength and
enthusiasm to make this happen," Rais
said.
One key to Stanford's success has
been longtime head coach Art Walker,
who rode for Stanford in the early 80s
and is in his last year at the helm of the
team.
"He has truly helped me develop as a
rider," Pierce said. "We want to send him
out on a high note with some great indi
vidual and team results."
Rais echoed Pierce's sentiments.
"Art is an invaluable source of cycling
wisdom, not to mention an administra
tive genius," Rais said. "We will be hard
put to fill the void he leaves."
Walker has helped foster a tight-knit
group of riders on the Farm.nthusiasm to
make this happen.
"The team is full of awesome, laid
back people who just happen to be crazy
fast bike racers," Miller said. "I cannot
think of a better group of people to spend
my weekends with."
Miller reflected on a particularly
memorable weekend in late February,
when Stanford sent a large contingent of
riders to UCLA.
Upon completion of the Team Time
Trials, there was a half-hour wait before
results were posted. While waiting,
Miller said he and his teammates passed
the time stretching and quoting "An
chorman," until one Stanford cyclist re
turned with some good news.
"He looks at the results and yells,
'Hey Stanford, we won every catego
ry!,'" Miller said. "We all jumped up and
were screaming and yelling like we had
won the Superbowl. It was awesome, and
we ended up winning the other event of
the day as well."
Miller can move up as high as seventh
in the Men's A Individual Omnium
standings with a solid showing the next
two weeks.
On the women's side, senior Allison
Paine will be looking to move up in the
Women's B standings. She agreed that her
teammates, not just her own strong finish
es, have made this season enjoyable.
Stanford leads team Omnium

"It's been a great season because we've
had such a fun, enthusiastic group of cool
people coming out on team rides through
out the fall and winter, and coming out to
race weekends for the last couple of
months," said Paine, who began racing as a
sophomore. "Half of the fun has been
road-tripping with good friends, cheering
teammates on after your race is over, grab
bing burritos with the whole crew as a post
race meal, and piling as many people and
bikes as will fit into a room at Motel 6."
Paine is ranked 11th in the Omnium
standings and will compete in all three
races in Santa Cruz.
"1 think climbing is my strong point, so
I'm reaUy looking forward to the hill climb
time trial on Sunday," Paine said. "It's a
brutal 4.5-mile climb with about 2.5 to 3
miles at 10 percent grade. A bunch of us
went down last weekend to check out the
courses and rode it at a leisurely pace, and
all I can say is that it's going to hurt, a lot."
Miller and freshmen Ryan Parnes and
Alicia Cooperman also test-rode the
course at Santa Cruz.
Parnes is in second place in the Men's B
standings and trails UC-Santa Barbara's
Aaron Patterson by six points. Cooperman,
who raced on the varsity cycling team at Ex
eter Academy in New Hampshire, is in
fourth place in the Women's B standings.

Both made huge splashes at UC-Irvine
on April 9 and 10. Despite being outnum
bered, Stanford won both the Individual
Time Trial and the Criterion, a short, in
tense race on a loop track in which racers
ride a specified number of laps. Parnes won
the Men's B Individual Time Trial and
placed second in the Criterion, while
Cooperman won both of the Women's B
races.
"It was amazing to win two races in a
row and definitely worth the seven-hour
drive each way," said Cooperman, who
credited her new, super-light bike. "Espe
cially since we spent Sunday afternoon eat
ing burritos at Newport Beach."
Saturday's first race, the Men's B, be
gins at 8 a.m. and the final race of the day,
the Men's A, starts at 1 p.m. Many of Stan
ford's racers Saturday will compete in Sun
day's two races, as well.
"Everyone has different strengths and
weaknesses, but the great thing about col
legiate cycling is that it gives everyone a
chance to try several different events and
disciplines," Rais said. "Most people race
as many events as possible each weekend,
whether or not they would consider those
events as specialties."
Come Sunday afternoon, a beachside
round of celebratory burritos might be in
order.

who raced on the varsity cycling team at Ex

Both made huge splashes at UC-Irvine
on April 9 and 10. Despite being outnum
bered, Stanford won both the Individual
Time Trial and the Criterion, a short, in

ride a specified number of laps. Parnes won
the Men's B Individual Time Trial and
placed second in the Criterion, while
Cooperman won both of the Women's B

The Stanford cycling team will compete in three races this weekend in Santa Cruz. There
are two weekends of racing remaining before Nationals.
The Stanford cycling team travels to
Santa Cruz, Calif, this weekend for three
races over two days on a course reminis
cent of the steep rises and falls of the
Boardwalk rollercoaster nearby. There,
Stanford is looking to wrap up its regular
season with one more thrilling ride be
fore beginning preparation for the West
ern Collegiate Cycling Conference
Championships to be held next weekend
in Reno, Nev.
Saturday will consist of a Road Race,
including a 460-foot climb, and cyclists
will compete in a Hill Climb Time Trial
and an Individual Time Trial on Sunday.
Stanford is ahead of California atop the
WCCC Team Omnium standings —
rankings based on teams' best finishes
throughout the season — and has sever
al riders at or near the top of the Individ
ual Omnium standings for the Men's and
Women's A, Band C Divisions.
The final Omnium standings will not
be determined until after Conference
Championships, where team points will
be worth 1.5 times more than during the
regular season.
"We will do our best to focus on win
ning at least one event to widen our Om
nium points gap," said co-term masters
student Amber Rais, who races
Women's A and will compete in all three
races this weekend. Rais joined the team
midway through last season and is sec
ond in the Women's A standings.
Based on the Omnium scoring sys
tem, Cal cannot cut into Stanford's 14-
point lead until the Conference Champi
onships, but Stanford could widen its
lead by winning an event as a team in
Santa Cruz.
"The race is only an hour away, so it
provides individuals a chance to gain
some Individual Omnium points for
themselves," sophomore captain Rand
Miller said.
Miller, 12th in the Men's A standings,
said he felt good about the team's
chances during fall training, when team
members made daily rides through the
surrounding foothills and 60-mile week
end rides to the coast.
"This season has been an amazing
year for Stanford cycling as a whole, and
it has been exciting to watch the team de
velop into a cohesive, fun-loving and fast
group of cyclists," Miller said. "From the
very beginning of the year, I could tell
this group had potential."
That potential has blossomed into re
sults throughout the season, which began
on a surprisingly high note.
In early February, Rais, doctoral stu
dent David Pierce and Chris Montague-
Breakwell drove to San Diego to com
pete in the first race of the year. Riding
against schools that were fielding full
teams of cyclists, they expected little
more than to gain early-season experi
ence. Instead, they took second overall in

the Road Race, as Pierce and Montague-
Breakwell finished first and ninth, re
spectively, in the Men's A, and Rais took
top honors in the Women's A.
Pierce, in his sixth year with the team,
has worn the yellow jersey as the Men's
A Omnium leader throughout most of
the season and will compete in all three
races this weekend.
At the first team-targeted race of the
season at UC-Davis one week later,
Stanford sent approximately 35 riders
and earned top finishes in every event,
winning the weekend's top honors as a
team and continuing Stanford's rise to
the top of the team standings.
"We didn't make the Team Omnium
an explicit goal to begin with, but as the
season continues, it has become obvious
that this team has both the strength and
enthusiasm to make this happen," Rais
said.
One key to Stanford's success has
been longtime head coach Art Walker,
who rode for Stanford in the early 80s
and is in his last year at the helm of the
team.
"He has truly helped me develop as a
rider," Pierce said. "We want to send him
out on a high note with some great indi
vidual and team results."
Rais echoed Pierce's sentiments.
"Art is an invaluable source of cycling
wisdom, not to mention an administra
tive genius," Rais said. "We will be hard
put to fill the void he leaves."
Walker has helped foster a tight-knit
group of riders on the Farm.nthusiasm to
make this happen.
"The team is full of awesome, laid
back people who just happen to be crazy
fast bike racers," Miller said. "I cannot
think of a better group of people to spend
my weekends with."
Miller reflected on a particularly
memorable weekend in late February,
when Stanford sent a large contingent of
riders to UCLA.
Upon completion of the Team Time
Trials, there was a half-hour wait before
results were posted. While waiting,
Miller said he and his teammates passed
the time stretching and quoting "An
chorman," until one Stanford cyclist re
turned with some good news.
"He looks at the results and yells,
'Hey Stanford, we won every catego
ry!,'" Miller said. "We all jumped up and
were screaming and yelling like we had
won the Superbowl. It was awesome, and
we ended up winning the other event of
the day as well."
Miller can move up as high as seventh
in the Men's A Individual Omnium
standings with a solid showing the next
two weeks.
On the women's side, senior Allison
Paine will be looking to move up in the
Women's B standings. She agreed that her
teammates, not just her own strong finish
es, have made this season enjoyable.
Stanford leads team Omnium

"It's been a great season because we've
had such a fun, enthusiastic group of cool
people coming out on team rides through
out the fall and winter, and coming out to
race weekends for the last couple of
months," said Paine, who began racing as a
sophomore. "Half of the fun has been
road-tripping with good friends, cheering
teammates on after your race is over, grab
bing burritos with the whole crew as a post
race meal, and piling as many people and
bikes as will fit into a room at Motel 6."
Paine is ranked 11th in the Omnium
standings and will compete in all three
races in Santa Cruz.
"1 think climbing is my strong point, so
I'm reaUy looking forward to the hill climb
time trial on Sunday," Paine said. "It's a
brutal 4.5-mile climb with about 2.5 to 3
miles at 10 percent grade. A bunch of us
went down last weekend to check out the
courses and rode it at a leisurely pace, and
all I can say is that it's going to hurt, a lot."
Miller and freshmen Ryan Parnes and
Alicia Cooperman also test-rode the
course at Santa Cruz.
Parnes is in second place in the Men's B
standings and trails UC-Santa Barbara's
Aaron Patterson by six points. Cooperman,
who raced on the varsity cycling team at Ex
eter Academy in New Hampshire, is in
fourth place in the Women's B standings.
