Statement regarding the election of Pope
Bene diet XVI
I have been disheartened to hear many media reports that seem ready to condemn and
dismiss I lis 110l iness, Pope Benedict XVI, almost witliin moments of liis election.
A- L atholics, we believe that none other than tlie 1 loly Spirit o I God made this choice,
working through the College of Cardinals.
bach pope, lib e each person, is a unique gift o I God who equips each wi th nil that is
necessary to do what is needed (cf. hpbesians 4:12). Joseph l\at/.itiger's most manifest
gills to date have heen his intelligence and zeal, and while il is true that detractors gave
him unflattering nicknames like "God's Rottweiler" when he served as the Church's
chiel spokesman of doctrinal orthodoxy, his election to succeed his heloved friend,
John Paul 11, is a new moment of grace in his life and the life o I the world.
Mis II oliness has a deep and profound love for Jesus Christ and the C hurch. hveryone
who has met him in person (I know several individuals who have) seems to agree that
he is a humble, soft-spoken, and even a charming man. Effective leaders change their
approach lo meet the challenges set before them. I expect Pope Benedict's love and
zeal lo he revealed much dilferently now than in the past lo reflect the new and more
complex responsibilities he must embrace. And throughout the days lo come,
God will provide in ways that neither the Pontiff nor we expect!
Conventional wisdom says thai a new pope's choice of name says much about how he
sees himself in llie role ol I niversal Shepherd. I he last pope named Benedict had to
dea ! with World War I and a Catholic flock at war with itself; he literally spent his lite
being a peacemaker and a healer, both inside and outside the Church. May this
Benedict sirive lo be the blessing bis name implies, pouring himself out, just as Jesus
dill, lor the lile ol the wor Id (cf. John 6:51).
