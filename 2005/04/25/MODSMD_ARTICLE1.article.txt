# Fashion, food and dance
## Naija celebrates culture 
### KATHERINE COX 
Students from the Nigerian Student
Association, or Naija, and members of the
Nigerian dance group Kuumba performed
in the cultural show "Who We Be," which
featured Nigerian food, dance, history,
music and fashion.
Naija Co-President junior Kristy An
wuri said the cultural show reflected the
group's mission to "educate the Stanford
community about Nigeria's culture and
heritage."
"We are speaking to the general Stan
ford community, trying to promote a truer
and better image of Nigeria," she said.
In a video segment, edited by Gustavo
Mendiola that prefaced the live portion of
the show, Anwuri said, "Nigeria is always
in the news for something corrupt that is
going on there, and we are simply trying to
break down the mystique of Nigeria as a
primitive and corrupted nation."
Junior Morin Oluwole, a participant in
the show, expressed her hope that audi
ence members would "better appreciate
the significance of Nigerian culture and its
broad influence on other cultures in the
world."
Sunday's show, the second annual
Nigerian cultural production, differed
from the first in that the group "tried to ex
pand the show to incorporate more facts
about Nigerian culture, food and fashion,
while incorporating a theatric element,"
Anwuri said.
Traditional Nigerian garb was mod
eled by students during a runway segment
and native foods were served during inter
mission.
Several of the show's "acts" were
dramatizations of Nigerian social interac
tions by Nigerian student performers.
"The main premise of the show is a wed
ding," Anwuri said. Throughout the event

pretend couples prepared fora wedding
ceremony which was enacted at the end.
Anwuri said the wedding theme actual
ly involved some of the more serious ma
terial in the production.
"This portion deals with Christian and
Muslim marriages between families and
the tensions they entail," she said. "The
show touches on AIDS issues in Africa,
but more specifically in Nigeria."

Although she added that the show was
meant to educate the entire Stanford com
munity, Anwuri commented on the signif
icant number of Nigerians in this area.
"We have a large Nigerian population
here, as is true of most universities," she
said. "Nigerians account for about one
fifth of the African-American population,
and there are always a lot of Nigerians in
essentially every metropolitan area."
