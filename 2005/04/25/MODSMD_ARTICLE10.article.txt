### DANIEL NOVINSON STAFF WRITER 
The tsunamis that rocked South
cast Asia in December have posed
major technological challenges to sci
entists and innovators worldwide.
This was the topic of Friday's install
ment ol the "Alter the Waves," con
ference series, which has presented
varying responses to the disaster that
claimed more than 1(X).(H)0 lives.
Moderated hy Leonard Ortolano,
director of the Haas Center for Pub
lic Service, the panel of speakers in
cluded Dipak Basu, a public service
worker who works to bring commu
nication equipment to areas dam
aged by the tsunamis; Arvind Prab
hudevof Volunteers for India Devel
opment and Empowerment, a group
that aims It) address socio-economic
problems in India; and Ashok Gadg
il, a visiting professor teaching two
courses at Stanford this quarter and
who patented IJVWaterworks, a
technology that uses ultraviolet rays
to cost-effectively purify drinking
water.
Gadgil spoke first, highlighting
the difficulty of introducing highly
technical solutions into culturally tra
ditional or technologically conserva
tive societies.
"We are all struijylinii to figure out

how to make this effort work togeth
er," Gadgil said. "The common
weakness has been trying to bring to
the table technologies for which there
is no standard template for imple
mentation."
Basu began his segment of the talk
by calling attention to the youthful
ness of the audience members.
"It's really exciting for me to be in
a group like yours with the whole fu
ture ahead of you," he said. "You can
do a lot of work in the near future that
I've waited to do for much of my life."
Basu then explained the impor
tance of communication equipment
in responding to disasters.
"The first person arrives after the
tsunami and they are surrounded by
disaster," Basu said. "Your first and
most important need is communica
tions. You need to upload pictures
and budgets as soon as possible."
While Basu advocated the need
for high-tech equipment, he also em
phasized the need for innovations de
signed to respond to the demands of
the population, including nutrition
and sanitation.
"Technology is very much sub
servient and a provider of the needs
that people actually have," Basu said.
Last to speak, Prabhudev echoed
Basu's sentiments, stressing the im
portance of teaching people how to

use new technology.
"No donation alone is sufficient,"
he said. "We need to focus on pre
paredness, on knowledge transfer, on
the creation of awareness among
people."
All three speakers said they hoped
the event caused audience members
to think about the broader issues that
resulted from the tsunami.
"I'm very happy to work with
'Stanford students and their questions
were extremely penetrative," Basu
said. "I hope I fired up some imagina
tions and people go and do some re
ally good work."
Prabhudev said events such as the
panel discussion are important be
cause they energize the organizations
working to attack international chal
lenges and allow experts to learn
from one another's efforts.
Students in the audience said they
identified with the speakers' passion.
"I believe very strongly in the
cause of bringing technology to com
munities affected by disaster and de
veloping culturally sensitive solutions
to their problems," freshman Grace
I Isu said. "I know a lot of the people
on the panel are authorities on the
subject and I definitely learned a lot
about the burdens they have to face
and the procedures they have to go
through to help these communities."
