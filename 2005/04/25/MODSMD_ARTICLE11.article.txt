### BOB BOREK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Iran has been a scapegoat for the United States
since the Iranian Revolution of 1978 and 1979," said
William Beeman, visiting professor of anthropology
and director of Middle East studies at Brown Univer
sity, last night during his lecture "Iran Today: An An
thropological View."
The talk was the second event in the "Iran: Past and
Present" lecture series sponsored by the Persian Stu
dent Association, or PSA, in conjunction with the Mus
lim Student Awareness Network, or MSAN, and the
Coalition for Justice in the Middle East, or CJME.
Beeman began his lecture by holding up a copy of
"Atomic Iran," a book by Jerome Corsi, as an example
of the negative stereotypes perpetuated about life in
Iran and the danger that the nation presents to the
United States. He also argued that Americans have
had a monolithic image of Iran for the last 25 years.
Beeman said that the unchanging idea of Iran "ob
scures our taking a look and seeing what Iran is really

like. In another five to lOyears a very different Iran will
emerge from the one that existed pre-revolution."
One of the most important factors in the reforma
tion of Iran is that the average age is only 23, Beeman
said. With the majority of the population under the age
of 25, there will be a large number of new voters in the
next five years who did not even live through or know
the details of the Iranian Revolution. He said he ex
pects the conservative views in Iran — preserved most
strongly by those over age 70 — to begin to fade in
coming years.
Beeman also said that Iran is an enormously diverse
country with a vital culture that has a widespread in
fluence, especially in Asia.
"The power of Iranian civilization trumps every
thing else," he said. "It is such a tremendously power
ful influence."
He said that although there are a large number of
different ethnic groups in Iran, they all still identify
themselves as Iranian.
