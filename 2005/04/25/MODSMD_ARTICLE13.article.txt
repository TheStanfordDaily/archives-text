# Water in the Milk Bottle
## Use the magic word 
### 
A car on the road becomes a per
son, with its own distinct appearance
and character, and commuting is like
going to a huge party for people who
need anger management.
I'm the odd guest at the gathering
— easygoing, if awkward and liable
to accidentally stick my elbow in
someone's eye. That's when the ac
companying person, who has been
keeping her rage in delicate check,
suddenly explodes, shrieking and
glaring high beams out of her dam
aged ocular organs.
I think these outbursts are bad for
my heart. I've tried to counter them
by playing soothing music, but the
unreliable local stations usually
leave me weighing irritating
tweenage poppers vs. Soviet classical
vs. seizure-like keyboard solos on
Jazz 91.1.
The near-collisions are probably

my fault, of course, but
even the angry suffer
the occasional faux
pas. Sometimes I feel
I'm being judged too
harshly for wearing a
minivan hand-me
down, the sign of a
slow, distracted, tail
gate-worthy soccer

mom.
1 envy the rare, charismatic peo
ple who always seem to get a free
pass. Ambulances, for instance, and
the retirement-home tour bus. The
only time I've personally been at
tached to any such vehicle is the sum
mer I raced Route 66 with the Stan
ford Solar Car Project.
They say the middle of the coun
try is friendlier, but given that those
red states brought us Bush, I would
disagree. Nonetheless, as we rolled
down the highway at 28 miles per
hour, the truckers on the CB radio
sounded pretty cheerful and even
shared a few laughs. "Hey," we over
heard one man saying, "did y'all sec
that UFO?"
I haven't seen any UFOs. out
here, but last week there was a guy
on a unicycle, pedaling down Ju
nipero Serra while I waited at the
light. I was amused and grinned
broadly, communicating to him that
his appearance was both unexpected
and mood-lifting. As he rolled by, he
made eye contact and dipped his
head, as if to tell me "you're wel
come."
It made me think that there are
people who deliberately go around
looking weird to make strangers
happy. Then it made me think that
there are people who deliberately go
around looking weird to get an ad
vantage in traffic. If only I were a
cute, delightful spectacle, everyone
else would smile and let me cruise on
by.
But I don't look too weird in my
car, except when bobbing up and
down to radio tunes. While my car
dancing is often quite exuberant, I
doubt it?s particularly amusing. I
have few visual memories of child
hood, probably due to severe my
opia, but I clearly recall watching a
black low-rider whiz by with its
spiky-haired navigator rearing vio
lently back and forth to the beat of
inaudible heavy metal (just a guess
— I have never seen anyone do that
to smooth jazz or Peter Gabriel). I
thought he was ignoring the road. I
also thought he was insane.
There are other ways to get spe
cial attention, but there's a fine line
between being cute like the Jelly
Belly-like bug and obnoxious like
that one party limo dressed as a neon
caterpillar. Considering that I have
no artistic ability (again, nearsight
edness), 1 wouldn't want to get into
any ugly costuming that might pro
voke my roadmates further.
With limited skills, I've decided
to concentrate only on surviving
those critical, gauche moments
where I try to switch lanes into some
one's side. Surfing for suggestions, I
found a Web site on road rage
(www.awesomelibrary.org / road
rage.html) that suggested handling
such situations with a simple apolo
gy. It even offered a printable page
to help.
I now have a neat little board with
bold, two-inch letters to tell the road
worries "SORRY." So far, it's been
working pretty well. A simple apolo
gy, a simple wave of priestly forgive
ness. Less honking, no flicking on the
high beams and far fewer dirty looks.
Of course, with this new-found abso
lution. I've started cutting people off
deliberately and only pretending to
be sorry afterwards. This brings up
the overall rage a little, but all the
same — it makes me happy.
