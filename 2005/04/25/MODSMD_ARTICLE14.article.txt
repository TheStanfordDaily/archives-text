# Abroad alternatives abound for students
## 
### COURTNEY WEAVER STAFF WRITER 
For students who want to step away from the bubble, Stan
ford offers a large array of opportunities. Its overseas centers
range from those in Australia to Kyoto; Bejing to Paris; Santi
ago to Moscow. Nearly 30 percent of Stanford undergrads take
this route.
But if you want to study in Spain — or any of the countries
where Stanford does not have a program — youfll have to
look to other programs.
Junior Stephen Dorsey, a philosophy and Spanish major,
chose Hamilton Collegefs Madrid program over Stanfordis in
Santiago, ibecause it was more in line with what my interests
were,i he said.
ill also appealed to me that it was fora semester and not a
quarter, because I was able to get a month more abroad,! said

Dorsey, who spent fall semester in Madrid.

He chose to apply to Hamiltonis pro-

gram because it's "a pretty well

known program and it is one

of the ones that Stan-

ford recommends

which makes

trans-

ferring
units easi
er.!

While the

Stanford pro
grams empha-

size language
skills, and classes

are often taught in
the native language.

many Stanford cours
es abroad are taught in

D —
English. Dorsey was also
attracted to the Spanish-

only policy of the program.
"We signed a waiver be-

fore we left saying that we

would only speak Spanish while

we there," he said.
"I stayed with a host family with a 12-year-old sister and a
six-year-old brother and spent a lot of time with them," Dorsey
said. "We went on a lot of trips with the program and traveled
all over Spain to lots of museums and cathedrals."
Dorsey was also able to take classes towards his Spanish
major. His department allows up to 25 units to be transferred
from abroad.
"I took a class on the history of modern Spain, a Spanish
language class and an art history class on Spanish art from the
Roman times to up to the 18th century'," he said.
"I also did an internship where for half of the class 1 taught
Spanish at a local school to third and fifth graders, and for the
other half of the class 1 studied the education system and non
profit groups in Spain."
Though Dorsey enjoyed the program, attending a non-
Stanford program did have drawbacks. For example, he had to
stop out from Stanford in the fall.
"It would have been easier not to disenroll. and the draw is
easier for you coming back [if you study through Stanford],"
he said. "I had to wait and go through the walk-in sessions the
day before the quarter started because those people who are
on Stanford programs get first priority to the housing thati's

available."
But Dorsey said he is glad he decided to do the program
through Hamilton.
"Logistically, it would have been easier but I also enjoyed
meeting people from different schools. I guess there were pros
and cons," he said.
"I think you should just figure out what your interests are,
and for me, my interests were in Spain and in Europe," he said.
"There are benefits to doing the Stanford program but the
most important thing is where you go."
Spanish Prof. Michael Predmore agreed that there are
plenty of excellent opportunities for students to study abroad
through non-Stanford affiliated programs.
"We in the Spanish Department endorse three programs
that we have the highest regard for based on on-site visits, fac
ulty and feedback from our students," Predmore said. "The
Hamilton Program, which is affiliated with small liberal arts

colleges in the east; the Madrid Campus of St.
Louis University; and the Center for Cross-Cultural Stud
ies in Seville."
Predmore said that the Spanish Department assesses dif
ferent abroad programs based on itheir academic quality, the
rigor of the program, the home stays and the quality of the cul
tural excursions.
"I wish that Stanford had [a program in Spain], but these
programs are so good that I think they serve our students as
well," he said. "These programs are strong as a result of 30
years of experience."
Predmore estimated that between 50 and 60 students go to
Spain each year, making it the second most popular overseas
destination, second only to England.
Stanford offered a program in Salamanca until it was shut
down 20 years ago in the late 1980s to make room fora pro
gram in Santiago. The Overseas Studies Program is develop
ing a program in Spain, but the details and date when it will
open is yet to be determined.
While Predmore is very supportive of the campus in Santi
ago, he disagreed with the Overseas Studies Program taking
away the campus in Salamanca.
"Overseas Studies wanted to put up a program in Santiago
and the Salamanca program had to be sacrificed," he said. "1
never understood that. I always thought it was unfortunate
that they tried to play one off of another."
Predmore does recommend the Santiago program to his
students, however, in addition to other abroad programs in
Spain, depending on the particular student's interests.
il went to participate in the Santiago program and I have al

ways tried to have been supportive of that,! he said. lWhile I
was unhappy that they closed down the program in Spain, I
was never unhappy that they set up a program in Santiago.!
Dorsey felt that Predmorefs feelings echoed the general
sentiment of the Spanish department as a whole.
"Within the Spanish Department, I think therei's an under
standing that therei's a lot of student interest in Spain," Dorsey
said. "They like the Santiago program but they understand
that therei's a lot of demand for the Spain program too. They
want people studying [abroad]."
Junior Nathan Aleman studied in Seville through lAccen
tal,i a program run by Trinity Christian in Illinois.
"One of my friends from [home in] Riverside did it. He
liked it and recommended it," Aleman said.
He decided to do a non-Stanford program for two main rea-
sons.

"The biggest thing was that 1 want
ed to go to Spain,"Aleman said.

"The second biggest reason

was that 1
was lucky

enough that
I really did-

nft have to
take classes for

my major when
1 was abroad. I

got to take classes
on Spanish history

and art. I had

friends sitting in
Berlin and doing a

problem set, and I just
felt that that was a

waste to be in Berlin and

be doing that."
Aleman thinks that the

ability to really experience
an environment is the most

valuable part of studying
abroad.

/aui uau,
"I think that the best thing to
study [while] abroad is where

you actually are,i he said, litis a
better opportunity in terms of life

than sitting in a Stanford class-

room and taking Stanford classes. [It

allows you to] feel the environment of your class when you
walk around."
Junior Sasha Lubomirsky, who traveled to Prague through
the American Institute for Foreign Study, or AIFS, agreed
that studying with a non-Stanford program had cultural ad
vantages.
"I loved doing a non-Stanford program," she said. "It al
lowed me to focus on the experience and not the grades.
Even though the credit transfers, the grades don't. I know
my friends who were abroad through Stanford programs
were a lot more concerned with their schoolwork. I had a
four-day week and could use the weekends to travel around
to Poland, Austria, England, the Netherlands, Ukraine,
Hungary and Germany."
She added:'Tm not sure I could have done all that if my
academics were more rigorous."
Having classes with non-Stanford students also appealed to
Lubomirsky.
"I liked being exposed to what other college kids are
like,"she said. "We take for granted we know what college
students are like, but we only know a very, very particular
type. Meeting kids from colleges across the country and
learning about their experiences was interesting and illumi
nating."
