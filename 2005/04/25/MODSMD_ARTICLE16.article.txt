## Editorial ASSU executives evaluated 
### 
East spring, a scandal-plagued ASSU executive
race prompted the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
to hold an unprecedented special election for pres
ident and vice-president of the student body. Ju
niors Cliioke Borgelt-Mose and Kory Vargas Caro
won the election and, now that their tenure has
come to an end, we want to review the services they
provided to the Stanford community in the past
year.
We hope that some of the policies they have in
stituted will continue to positively affect campus
life. I his year's increase in candidates for ASSU
elections can, at least in part, be attributed to
Borgelt-Mose and Vargas Caro's efforts to expand
the student body's understanding of the importance
of student government.
There are several other key achievements that
Borgelt-Mose and Vargas Caro leave as their legacy.
1. I hey served as capable liaisons between the
I Jniversity administrators and the student body in a
notable effort to improve communication. For ex
ample, they helped run advertisements at Flicks that
encouraged students to apply to various University
committees.
2 I hey spearheaded the Finding Diversity Con
ference, a two-day event last February that focused
on graduate-student and faculty diversity. The
event was well received by those who attended and
highlighted critical issues.

3. They instituted the ASSU Dorm Outreach
program, which encourages Senators to visit dorms
to improve the communication and accessibility be
tween the student body and the ASSU.
4. They worked with Office of Student Activities
and the Alumni Association to improve the Alumni
Association's student database in an effort to tailor
outreach to young alumni. For example, the
database now includes relevant information on stu
dent participation in volunteer student organiza
tions.
While Borgelt-Mose and Vargas Caro leave be
hind some concrete successes, they also leave plen
ty room for the new executive officers, Melanie
Kannokada and Aneto Okonkwo, to create their
own innovative policies, as many improvements still
need to be made.
The student body is largely unaware of what the
ASSU does while in office. The ASSU Web site
needs to be better maintained to provide students
with up-to-date information regarding the work of
the executive officers, their goals and the current
University issues that concern the ASSU. Finally,
much more needs be done to lower the cost of living
at Stanford, especially given the seemingly perpetu
al increases in tuition.
Borgelt-Mose and Vargas Caro served the Uni
versity well during their term. We hope Kannokada
and Okonkwo build on their successes.
