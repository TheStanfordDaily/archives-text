# Sketch
## But some of my best friends are graduate students 
### 
I was amused to glance at The
Daily editorial lhat rested above my
Lrolumn last week: "Sketchy TAs still
w problem." The juxtaposition of my
rant on the (extremely) rare mating
habits of graduate students and the
editorial board's rant on the floods of
grad sketchiness enveloping campus
was quite delightful.
On the other hand, the contents of
said editorial were a shade offensive
to anyone in the graduate student

community who (caches. Which is to say, pretly much all
of us.
Now I understand thai you're all a litde sensitive.
Alter all. you are still very young. And apparently a lit
tle sheltered. Hut, even with that in mind, it was hard not

Actually, given the general tone, the suggestion that
we all sign the"I will not think inappropriate thoughts"
pledge before starting our teaching duties was surpris
ingly mild. Why not do it properly?
You could have us all teach via videoconference. Or
spike the drinking water with bromide. Hell, why not just
castrate everyone presumably being educated by eu

student....
(I'll pause to take a breath here.)
Sketch. Interesting word. Such a descriptive term.
Filoquent. yet derogatory. Well maybe not eloquent, but
definitely derogatory. It sort of reminds me of the insults
that got hurled back and forth on playgrounds during my
elementary school days — it reflects a similar level of in
tellectual discourse.
1 suppose, in fact, that the obsession of using the term
"sketch," "sketchy," "sketchiness," and so on (and given
the title of my column, I can hardly claim it's one-sided)
is representative of an interesting facet of life on the
Farm.
Despite the etymology of the word, it would appear
that there are two distinct components to the University.
It's always been puzzling to me that, at Stanford at least.

one becomes an entirely different person when one
reaches grad school.
Apparently, if you're under the age of 22, you're an
affable, outgoing and, most importantly, socially accept
able individual. Then you graduate. At that point, you
undergo a sudden transition and become a shuffling, sus
pect figure that is always of the verge of sexually harass
ing one of your former compatriots.
Now, being shunned isn't so bad. but when it's done
with the assumption that you're some kind of wild beast
unable to control your base instincts, it does hurt a little.
Look, 1 know that sexual harassment does happen.
That TAs aren't perfect. That some of us (electrical en
gineers) may occasionally lack social skills. However, it
seems to me that much of the perception of graduate stu
dent "sketchiness" is just that — perception. And it isn't
helped by editorials that typecast without a second
thought.
If 1 were being particularly honest, 1 would point out
that a large part of the problem is that we have more in
common than otherwise. So perhaps it's not surprising
that grad students hit on undergrads and it's not surpris
ing that undergrads think they're being hit on. After all
that's what most of life is about.
Unfortunately, such aspects of life now involve un
derstanding the subtleties of appropriateness. And sub
tle is well, subtle. For everyone concerned. Which brings
me to a final point: Pigeonholing is easy (sorry EEs) and
cheap, and it would be negligent of me to do the same. So
I'd like to make it clear that I don't actually think that
you're all crazy and paranoid. Just most of you ...
Seriously though, we are just like you, except a few
years older. Bear that in mind, remember that behavior
should be judged by actions — not stereotypes — and
perhaps we'll end up with something that resembles a
community rather than a couple of mutually disdainful
factions.

I'd like to point out that I have nothing against young peo
ple per se; in fact some of my best friends are undergradu
ates. .. Well that's not actually true, but email navins@stan
ford.edu if you want to help me broaden my horizons.
