New pope respects those with
different religious views
As Catholic chaplain I qui under
stand Kalani Leifer's concern about
some of the statements of Cardinal
Joseph Katzinger—now Pope Benedict
XVI ("Who'syour Pope?" April 22). But
the fact is that (Ordinal Ratzinger never
said that "only in the Catholic Church is
there eternal salvation."
Such a statement demands putting
all Muslims. Jews and Protestants
into eternal damnation, a position
specifically condemned by the very
church office that Pope Benedict
used to head. Cults maintain that only
their particular brand of doctrine has
any validity, but in his first sermon
Benedict said he wants to work with
other faiths.
And it was Pope John Paul II who
went to mosques and synagogues for
prayer services. Granted he was con
demned by some fundamentalist
Catholics for doing this, but John
Paul and now Benedict both indicate
that we have to respect those who

hold differing religious views.

Daily's editorial was 'lazy journalism'
In a May 2(K)3 Daily Op-Ed, for
mer San Francisco Mayor Willie
Brown criticized The Daily for stat
ing that the Armenian Genocide is
not an established truth. 1 myself met
with your then-editor-in-chief and
placed in The Daily's office the Cali
fornia Handbook of Education,
which contains a comprehensive set
of references on the state-recognized
Armenian Genocide that is obligato
ry education in California public
schools. The then-editor assured me
that in future years, The Daily would
diligently research the topic.
This promise was proper. A jour
nalist has a single responsibility: to
only publish truth. In claiming that
The "Daily's editorial board is cer
tainly not in a position to evaluate
these claims" about the genocide
("Bill on Armenian genocide falls

outside of Senate's purview," April
19), the staff maintains an unbroken
tradition of reckless and lazy journal
ism: to give equal time to opposing
parties' accounts, however false one
account may be. This negligence dis
honors the 9()th anniversary of my
family's slayings. The staff has the his
torical materials and time to live up to
its obligations by the 91st anniversary.

Sfvonandam should look in the mirror
The incessant complaining about the
dearth of social life in graduate school
reached a new height with Navin
Sivanadam's column ("Welcome to
the champagne room," April 18),
which detailed his lack of a sex life
and blaming it on the poor graduate
school party scene.
The myth of the sketchy grad stu
dent looms large on this campus —
helped along by the editorial board's
hysterical warning about teaching as
sistants ("Sketchy TAs still a prob

lem," April 18), and no one man, no
matter how dedicated, can prevent the
phrase "I'm a grad student" from in
stantly turning off anyone working on
her first degree.
However, in the course of his dis
cussing how sexuality blooms in the
British college scene, he seems to have

forgotten that he's in grad school.
If Navin is still in the wild and free
phase of his life, he would probably have
more luck frequenting parts of San
Francisco proper — such as the Haight,
where free love was practically invented.
Grad students don't tend toward
"hookupculture." What else is new? Why
does he feel the need to continually trash
the electrical engineering department?
Those who get their action know
where to find it (yes Navin, even the
electrical engineers). If he's unable to
land a woman in the grad scene, it

may be that the women aren't inter
ested, and he's looking in the wrong
place. Assuming he's old enough, he
could purchase a slate of adult bever
ages and throw his own party, disin
vite the EEs and woo the fawns and
does uninhibited.
He should take a look in the mirror
and quit projecting his troubles onto
the students of other departments.

Editor's Note: Christopher P. Anderson
writes a weekly sports column in The Daily.
Beeman countered stereotypes (hat
Iranian women are oppressed, an
image that is supported by the fact that
they are forced to wear a veil over their
heads.
To illustrate this negative stereo
type, Beeman read an excerpt from
"Atomic Iran" that describes Iranian
women as "virtual animals, beasts of
burden, second-class citizens."

In response, Beeman noted that
more than half of the university
students in Iran are women and
many are in engineering and med
ical fields. He said that the literacy
rates for men and women under the
age of 25 are equal, adding that
there are 14 women in the Iranian
Parliament.
Beeman also showed a number of
pictures of women wearing veils in
fashionable ways, taking part in cam
paigns and competing in sports such
as chess, polo and karate.
Beeman said that these changes
are "not due to the enlightenment of

the government. Women have done
this themselves."
He said that women took the
egalitarian rhetoric of the Iranian
Revolution and interpreted it literal
ly, holding the revolutionaries to
their word.
"It will be the youth and the
women that are going to change the
nation in the next ten years," Bee
man said.
During the question-and-answer
session, several audience members
said they were concerned that the
high quality of life Beeman de
scribed only exists for the wealthy
minority.
The economic situation in Iran is
improving thanks to oil exports, and
the real question is whether the
money will trickle down to the popu
lation as a whole, Beeman said in re
sponse.
He also said that "the Iranian
population has adopted a posture of
confrontation to governmental con
trols."
Several other questions touched
on the U.S. government's role in
helping to reform Iran, to which Bee
man replied, "The United States is
not the actor that is needed in this sit
uation."
He noted that since former Presi
dent Clinton placed an economic
embargo on Iran, the United States
has been reliant on economics to ex
ercise influence in Iran.
Beeman predicted that "with
China rising as an economic force,
Iran is not going to need us. We're on
the brink of becoming economically
irrelevant."
"If we only have patience in the
West to wail for Iran to develop on
its own, I think that we will be very
pleased. Iran is quite capable of tak
ing care of itself," Beeman said.
