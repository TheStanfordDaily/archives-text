New pope respects those with
different religious views
As Catholic chaplain I qui under
stand Kalani Leifer's concern about
some of the statements of Cardinal
Joseph Katzinger—now Pope Benedict
XVI ("Who'syour Pope?" April 22). But
the fact is that (Ordinal Ratzinger never
said that "only in the Catholic Church is
there eternal salvation."
Such a statement demands putting
all Muslims. Jews and Protestants
into eternal damnation, a position
specifically condemned by the very
church office that Pope Benedict
used to head. Cults maintain that only
their particular brand of doctrine has
any validity, but in his first sermon
Benedict said he wants to work with
other faiths.
And it was Pope John Paul II who
went to mosques and synagogues for
prayer services. Granted he was con
demned by some fundamentalist
Catholics for doing this, but John
Paul and now Benedict both indicate
that we have to respect those who

hold differing religious views.

Daily's editorial was 'lazy journalism'
In a May 2(K)3 Daily Op-Ed, for
mer San Francisco Mayor Willie
Brown criticized The Daily for stat
ing that the Armenian Genocide is
not an established truth. 1 myself met
with your then-editor-in-chief and
placed in The Daily's office the Cali
fornia Handbook of Education,
which contains a comprehensive set
of references on the state-recognized
Armenian Genocide that is obligato
ry education in California public
schools. The then-editor assured me
that in future years, The Daily would
diligently research the topic.
This promise was proper. A jour
nalist has a single responsibility: to
only publish truth. In claiming that
The "Daily's editorial board is cer
tainly not in a position to evaluate
these claims" about the genocide
("Bill on Armenian genocide falls

outside of Senate's purview," April
19), the staff maintains an unbroken
tradition of reckless and lazy journal
ism: to give equal time to opposing
parties' accounts, however false one
account may be. This negligence dis
honors the 9()th anniversary of my
family's slayings. The staff has the his
torical materials and time to live up to
its obligations by the 91st anniversary.

Sfvonandam should look in the mirror
The incessant complaining about the
dearth of social life in graduate school
reached a new height with Navin
Sivanadam's column ("Welcome to
the champagne room," April 18),
which detailed his lack of a sex life
and blaming it on the poor graduate
school party scene.
The myth of the sketchy grad stu
dent looms large on this campus —
helped along by the editorial board's
