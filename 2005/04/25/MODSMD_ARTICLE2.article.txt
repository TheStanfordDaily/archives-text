# Soccer bonds workers and tutors
## Janitors join intramurals 
### SAM FLOAM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Janitors and students from Habla la Noche and
Habla el Dia teamed up to play their first intramural
soccer game yesterday. Although the team lost to
Larkin by one goal, the participants involved had the
unique opportunity to build student-worker relations.
Habla la Noche and Habla el Dia are student-run
groups through which students tutor janitors in Eng
lish.
Stanford's intramural program is generally re
served for students and those with valid ID cards, but
the janitors received permission to participate in
games every Sunday from the Intramural Department
because they are sub-contracted workers.
Eric Eldon, Class of 2004 and business manager of
The Daily, organized the team and found eight work
ers and five students from the program to join.
According to senior Patricia Hernandez, one of the
coordinators of Habla La Noche, around 15 janitors
participate in each of the tutoring programs. Hernan
dez said that there is more interest in the program
among students than the janitors, who often only
come when they have the available time.
Habla la Noche and Habla el Dia hold other events
in addition to the soccer games, including barbeques
for workers and their families.
"We want to get to know the workers and their
families outside of class," said Hernandez. "It helps us
understand and learn more from one another."
The student tutors and janitors are matched up
based on their knowledge of Spanish and English. The
workers in both programs learn from a pre-set cur
riculum as well as special workplace-oriented conver
sation.
Hernandez said she believes that the program
helps raise awareness and break the language barrier
between students and workers.
"Most students don't take the time to get to know
the workers and don't understand where the workers
are coming from," she said. "I feel that having pro
grams like this helps students understand what they
don't usually take time to learn."
Similar tutoring programs have been formed at
other schools, including UC Berkeley and Santa Clara
University.
