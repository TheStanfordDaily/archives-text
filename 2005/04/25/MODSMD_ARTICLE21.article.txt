It's hard to be
lieve, given
where I am
today, but a year
ago, I was just be
ginning to come

out. I had told some close friends
and had begun taking my first, high
ly tentative, sometimes embarrass
ing steps toward being out at Stan
ford. but 1 was in no way fully confi
dent in being openly gay at Stanford.
In a stroke of good timing, as I
was in the midst of this process, the
Queer Awareness Days, or OuAD,
was taking place. Among the many
activities to promote awareness, ac
ceptance and acknowledgement of
lesbian, gay, trans and bisexual, or
LCJBT, students and their allies at
Stanford was the National Day of Si
lence.
The National Day of Silence,
founded by students at the Universi
ty of Virginia in 1996, is now the
largest student-led action toward
creating safe and open communities
for LGBT students at middle
schools, high schools and colleges
across the country.
Students pledge not to speak on
the Day of Silence to reclaim the si
lencing that LGBT students often
experience. Instead, they wear shirts
that display "Freedom of Silence"
on the front and information about
the day on the back, and carry cards
to hand to people that explain why
they are not talking.
Despite my habit of talking
(seemingly) non-stop. 1 decided to
make the pledge and be silent for the
day. A few people asked questions,
but so many people participated that
by midday it seemed like everyone
on campus understood what was
going on. Many professors knew
about the National Day of Silence as
well, and those who didn't quickly

figured it out. All the professors we
encountered were accommodating
to our silent political observation.
It was empowering to convey a
message about the silencing of my
sexuality. But what was even more
powerful, for me, was seeing how
many of my friends and fellow stu
dents participated. The number of
people involved made the day feel
very inclusive and supportive. In one
of my classes, well over half of the
student were wearing shirts and
being silent.
The day concluded with a special
event at the LGBT Community Re
sources Center, where students per
formed songs and spoken word and
read poetry and other passages that
were meaningful to them.
After many years of silencing my
self, 1 finally began the process of
coming into my own and vocalizing
who 1 was last year. Although 1 still
have many issues to figure out (who
doesn't?), the open and accepting
community at Stanford has made my
experience coming out extremely
comfortable.
The Day of Silence was one of the
most memorable moments in this
process. I encourage everyone —
queer or straight — to participate;
it's quite affirming to know that you
are helping to create a space for
LGBT students. Even if you choose
not to be silent for the day, you can
still wear the T-shirt to show support
for the cause.
This year's Day of Silence will be
observed at Stanford on Tuesday.
You can pick up a "Freedom of Si
lence" T-shirt today at the LGBT
Community Resources Center, lo
cated on the second floor of the Fire
Truck House. The student perfor
mance event will also take place at
the LGBT-CRC at 8 p.m.
