## Teach for America deserves credit 
### RAPHE BECK 
In her Op-Ed piece ("Vetting and
understanding research," April 20),
Education Prof Linda Darling-Ham
mond continues her long-standing
criticism of emergency credential
teaching programs, in particular
Teach For America, or TFA.
1 am proud to be an alumnus of
both Stanford and Teach For Ameri
ca, and while 1 do not disagree with
Darling-Hammond's assertion that
well-trained, certified teachers are
preferable to less-trained, uncertified
ones, nor do 1 question her research, I
think it is absurd the way she ignores
the realities about placing teachers in
underserved communities, and 1 have
grown tired of hearing her criticize
Teach For America from the comfort
of Stanford's halls.
My TFA experience was in many
ways typical of the thousands of TFA
corps members who dedicate at least
two years to teaching in rural or inner
city communities. 1 taught high school
English and drama in Warren County,
N.C., which is the poorest county in
that state. 1 replaced a (certified)
teacher who was fired because he had
no control over his students. Over 75
percent of my students qualified for

tree lunch and almost all read far
below their grade level.
1 had been a teacher in the summers
between my years at Stanford, and I at
tended an intensive training program
and worked as a student teacher before
beginning my job in Warren County.
My teaching experience was extremely
challenging, but I'm proud of what I
gave to the job.
Of course, a graduate of Stanford's
School of Education might have been
more effective in my position than I
was. Unfortunately, none applied for
the job. In fact, no one from any pres
tigious teacher training program ap
plied for any job in Warren County
that year, or any other year, except for
those who did so through TFA. Where
are the certified teachers Darling-
Hammond so emphatically wants to
replace TFA teachers in these com
munities?
New teachers are expensive to
school districts, and Darling-Ham
tnond is correct that teachers who
leave after a few years, as I did, are a
drain on school budgets that are al
ready too shallow. But her data will
not show that in my school, for exam
ple, I created a school newspaper
where none existed before and that
students still publish that paper 10

years later. Her figures do not reflect
that 1 began an ongoing tradition of
after-school plays where none had
ever been produced before. Her re
search does not recognize that many
of my students were inspired by an en
ergetic young teacher to stay in
school, to go to college and in many
cases to become certified teachers
themselves and serve their home
county.
Stanford is blessed with a won
derful School of Education, and 1
fully support its efforts. But 1 wish
that Darling-Hammond would
cease trying to frame discussions of
TFA and teacher certification pro
grams as win/lose propositions.
Doesn't our nation's public educa
tion system have enough need of im
provement without lobbing criti
cism at others who are trying to fix
it? How that criticism serves Stan
ford, students at the School of Edu
cation or the underserved communi
ties Darling-Hammond studies is
beyond me.
