## No. 24 Cardinal sweep Huskies 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Friday night's Pacific-10 Confer
ence contest at Sunken Diamond
turned into a pitcher's duel between
Washington's established ace and the
Cardinal's brand-new one.
Husky righthander Tim Lincecum
relied heavily on his overpowering yet
precise fastball. First-time Friday
starter Jeff Gilmore, a junior, leaned
on his carefully crafted offspeed arse
nal. They struck out a combined 20
batters, allowed four hits each and gen
erally frustrated opposing batters in
complete game efforts.
But in a contest in which every hit.
every base runner, every ball and every
strike mattered. Gilmore and the Car
dinal (24-14.7-5) emerged with the 2-1
victory over the Huskies (24-17.4-8).
"It didn't feel different pitching on
a Friday night," said Gilmore, who was
told last Monday that he would pitch
the series opener. "But it did feel dif
ferent going against Tim Lincecum,
who is arguably the best pitcher in the
Pac-10. There's a heightened aware
ness to keep your team in the game."
The win was the first step to gaining

a much-needed conference series
sweep, as the Cardinal took Saturday
night's tilt, 10-6, and Sunday's game, 6-
3. Stanford and Washington, who were
tied for sixth place in the Pac-10 com
ing into the series, are now in fifth and
seventh place, respectively.
"When you get the first two, there's
definitely an air of confidence [going
into the third game]," freshman right
fielder Michael Taylor said. "We have
kind of a killer instinct to get the sweep
and that's an advantage, especially at
home."
The home crowd, though sparse,
was especially vocal in Friday night's
nailhiter, lamenting every Washington
runner and cheering tirelessly while
waiting for the Cardinal to break the 0-
Otie.
All the scoring came in the sixth in
ning. The Huskies broke the scoreless
tie in the top of the inning, as junior
Brent Lillibridge reached base on a
double, stole third and came home on
an RBI single by leftfielder Zach
Clem.
But the Cardinal answered right
back in the bottom of the sixth. After
getting runners on first and second,
junior John Mayberry Jr. boosted a
double into the outfield. Junior Chris
Lewis scored standing up from sec
ond, but junior Jed Lowrie was
nailed at the plate — or he would
have been if Washington catcher
Joey Dunn had held onto the ball.
Thinking he was out, Lowrie began
walking back to the dugout until the
crowd and his teammates alerted him

to the dropped ball, and he dove in
for what ended up being the game's
winning run.
While stunning pitching and a little
luck gave Stanford a victory on Friday
night. Saturday night's contest was de
cided by that dreaded 'E' column on
the scoreboard. The Huskies, who be
fore this weekend were tied for the best
fielding percentage in the Pac-10, com
mitted five costly errors on Saturday.
The Cardinal capitalized, scoring in
every inning in which the Huskies
made an error.
Stanford's lineup tagged the Wash
ington pitching staff with 13 hits, led by
Mayberry's 3-for-4, two-run perfor

mance. Though the team's production
tends to come primarily from the first
four spots in the order, the Cardinal's
five through nine hitters crossed the
plate six times in the game.
Stanford's offensive showing suit
ed junior starter Mark Romanczuk
well, as it gave him some room to find
his rhythm on the mound. He al
lowed just two runs despite scattering
seven hits in four innings. Freshman
reliever Nolan Gallagher gave up the
next three Musky runs but picked up
the first win of his career. Junior Matt
Manship, who has gradually pitched
his way into the Cardinal's closing
role, tossed the final three innings of

the game, grabbing his second save
and giving up one run (his first
earned run of the season in 12 ap
pearances).
"That's just vintage Manship."
Ciilmore said, referring to Manship's
freshman season as the team's closer.
"It's getting more and more exciting to
watch that guy pitch, because when he
goes out there, you get the feeling that
it's game over."
With the series win locked up after
the first two games, the Cardinal were
able to plav with desire instead of des
peration on Sunday afternoon. The
bottom five of the order anchored the
Stanford effort again, tallying eight of

the team's 10 hits and driving in all six
of the Cardinal's runs.
"We're probably all getting more
confident and comfortable in our
roles," Taylor said of the lower half of
the order.
The offense was backed by more
solid pitching, including a 5 1/3 inning,
two-run stint from starting sophomore
Matt Leva — who collected his second
win of the season — and a solid finish
from head coach Mark Marquess' fa
vorite bullpen option, sophomore
Blake Holler.
"This is the second weekend that
we've really leaned on Blake,"
Gilmore said. "He's proved that he's

not just a one-inning closer — he can
come in in the sixth inning and get the
job done."
Though Stanford will not play a se
ries this weekend, the team has more
than a little work left before it can jump
into the highly competitive Pac-10
race.
"[There'll be] no sense of relief,"
Taylor said. "[Marquess) would never
allow it. We had a slow start, and this
[sweep) didn't exactly put us right in
the driver's seat. We still have a lot to
do."
The Cardinal will face Santa Clara
tomorrow at 6 p.m. at Sunken Dia
mond.
