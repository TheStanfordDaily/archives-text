## No. 24 Cardinal sweep Huskies 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Friday night's Pacific-10 Confer
ence contest at Sunken Diamond
turned into a pitcher's duel between
Washington's established ace and the
Cardinal's brand-new one.
Husky righthander Tim Lincecum
relied heavily on his overpowering yet
precise fastball. First-time Friday
starter Jeff Gilmore, a junior, leaned
on his carefully crafted offspeed arse
nal. They struck out a combined 20
batters, allowed four hits each and gen

complete game efforts.
But in a contest in which every hit.
every base runner, every ball and every
strike mattered. Gilmore and the Car

The win was the first step to gaining

night's tilt, 10-6, and Sunday's game, 6-

seventh place, respectively.
"When you get the first two, there's
definitely an air of confidence [going
into the third game]," freshman right
fielder Michael Taylor said. "We have
kind of a killer instinct to get the sweep
and that's an advantage, especially at
home."
The home crowd, though sparse,
was especially vocal in Friday night's
nailhiter, lamenting every Washington
runner and cheering tirelessly while
waiting for the Cardinal to break the 0-
Otie.
All the scoring came in the sixth in
ning. The Huskies broke the scoreless
tie in the top of the inning, as junior
Brent Lillibridge reached base on a
double, stole third and came home on
an RBI single by leftfielder Zach
Clem.
But the Cardinal answered right
back in the bottom of the sixth. After
