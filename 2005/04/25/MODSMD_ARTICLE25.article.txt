# NFL Draft
## Six Stanford players selected in 2005 Draft 
### 
Stanford had three players selected in the first three rounds of the NFL draft for the first time since 1993. That year
Darrien Gordon. Glvn Milburn and John Lynch were selected in the first, second and third rounds, respectively.

Oshiomogho Atogwe
Second Pick of the Third Round (66th overall)

Atogwe recorded 76 tackles (45 solo),
four interceptions, seven pass deflections
and two of his Stanford career-record 11
forced fumbles last season to earn All-Pac
10 Conference honorable mention. The
Windsor. Ontario native is considered un
dersized at 5-foot-11,2(X) pounds.

Veteran safety Aeneas Williams' retirement coupled with
questions about how strong safety Adam Archuleta will be upon
returning from a back injury means Atogwe will be competing
for significant playing time this summer. The Rams' made
shoring up their secondary a top priority this offseason. They
took Florida State safety Jerome Carter in the fourth round and
signed free agent safeties Michael Hawthorne and Michael
Stone.
"There are just no nicks on him in terms of a particular area
where we might have to get him up to speed," Rams head coach
Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. "He is a very solid
player ... He will make an immediate impact for us on special
teams, and he is going to have a chance to go in there at safety and
earn a spot as a starter potentially."

Alex Smith
Seventh Pick of the Third Round (71st overall)

Smith led the Cardinal with 52 recep
tions (second in the nation among tight
ends) for 706 yards and three touchdowns
last season, earning All-Fac-1() honors. He
finished his career with 107 receptions, the
most ever by a Stanford tight end, and was
the runner-up to first-round selection

Heath Miller of Virginia for the Mackey Award, which is given to
the nation's top tight end. The Bucs marveled at the 6-foot-5.257-
pound Smith's pass catching and route-running skills, but say he
needs to improve his blocking.
Tampa Bay, which runs a lot of two tight-end sets under head
coach Jon Gruden, acquired veteran tight end Anthony Becht
during the offseason, but Smith should compete for playing time
with backups Will Heller and Nate Lawrie.
"He can stretch (the field)," Gruden told the Tampa Tribune.
"He's good after the catch. He's accomplished as a receiver, and
he's a versatile guy. You'll see him at Stanford shift into the back
field, he'll play 'H,' he'll play fullback. He can get down the field
in a hurry. We think he has tremendous upside. He's a black belt
in karate. He's got great flexibility. He's a heck of a kid and I think
he wants to be great. He'll give our tight end group a different dy
namic than we've had here."

Stanley Wilson
Eighth Pick of the Third Round (72nd overall)

Wilson had 54 tackles and an intercep
tion last season, earning an AII-Pac-10 honor
able mention. The 5-foot-11, 189-pound Wil
son is a gifted athlete who starred for the track
team during the offseason for most of his Stan
ford career. He improved his draft status con
siderably after solid pre-draft workouts.

The Lions return starting cornerbacks Fernando Bryant and
Dre' Bly, as well as last year's third-round selection. Keith Smith.
Wilson will provide depth in the secondary and will compete for
playing time with backups Chris Cash and Andre Goodman. The
Lions selected USC's Mike Williams and Shaun Cody with their
first two picks this weekend.

Newberry, Svitek and Bergeron also drafted
On Sunday three more Cardinal players' names were called. The Washington Redskins took Jared Newber
ry and the Kansas City Chiefs took tackle Will Svitek in the sixth round. The reigning NFC Champion
Philadelphia Eagles took linebacker David Bergeron in the seventh round.
