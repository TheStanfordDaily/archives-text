# Softball tops No. 2 Bears

### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
When Stanford faces off with California, excite
ment ensues. This weekend's three-game softball
ries was no exception as the No. 7 Cardinal topped
the No. 2 Bears in two of three meetings. Stanford
won Friday with a six-run rally, secured a victory Sat
urday with a spectacular defensive play to end the
game and lost a tight contest Sunday.
With the two wins, Stanford will remain ahead of
Cal in the conference standings and should also
boost the Cardinal higher in the national polls, while
Cal will likely slip a hit.
"We're not really concerned with the national
rankings, just with playing consistent softball." head
coach John Rittman said. "Any time you beat Cal,
which is a senior-dominated team, you feel pretty
good. But I felt like we could have won the last one,
too. But I think we played well this weekend."
The series kicked off Friday night at Stanford in
front of a season-high 804 fans, including members of
the women's basketball team who sported "10th
Man Club" t-shirts and led cheers.
Cal's ace Kristina Thorson was dominant early
and the Stanford defense held strong, as freshman
Becky McCullough worked her way out of a bases
loaded jam in the first inning.

hoard in the third with freshman
Michelle Smith batting, but her blast
into leftfield fell inches short of the
outfield wall and into the glove of
Cal's Emily Friedman.
Cal finally broke the scoring
drought in the fourth inning, going
up 1-0 on an RBI single from Julie
Meyer. Based on the way the game
was going, it seemed that might be
enough.
McCullough got herself into an
other jam early in the fifth inning,
loading the bases with no outs. She
hit one batter and walked another
before a third reached base when a
bunt that looked to be rolling foul
stopped dead on the line. The Bears
tallied three runs in the frame before
McCullough ended the inning with a
strikeout.
But just when it looked like Cal
had it all locked up, the Stanford
batters started a rally of their own.
Fresh into the game, Cal's Kelly
Anderson found herself in an unen
viable position — bases loaded,
one out and Stanford's best home
run threat in the batter's box. Smith
who broke the single-season
home run record on the Farm last
week with her 16th blast — kept it
in the park, but her RBI single
opened the floodgates for the Car
dinal. Senior Leah Nelson drew a
walk to bring home junior Catalina
Morris and sophomore Jackie
Rinehart's two-RBI double to deep
centerfield knotted up the score at
four runs apiece, bringing Thorson
back into the circle.
Freshman Tricia Aggabao tagged
Thorson for an RBI single to give
Stanford its first lead of the night and
a sacrifice grounder from freshman
designated player Erin Howe sealed
the 6-4 victory for the Cardinal.
McCullough got the win for Stan
ford and Anderson took the loss, de
spite having only pitched 1/3 innings.
McCullough gave up four runs on
five hits with three strikeouts. Lead
ing the Stanford offensive burst,
Morris went 2-for-3 with a run
scored and a stolen base, and Rine
hart went l-for-3 with two RBI and a
run.
In Berkeley on Saturday, the Car
dinal got on the board first, scoring
two runs in the third inning. Nelson
grounded out to score Morris to
break the scoreless lie and Rinehart
followed with her third RBI of the
weekend, a single to bring home
pinch runner Shoney Hixson.
Cal answered in the fifth, as a sac

rilice fly from Vicky Galindo plated
Meyer to cut the Stanford lead in
half.
The score remained 2-1 heading
into (he bottom of the seventh, when
Galindo singled to centerlield with
two outs and a runner on third base.
Pinch runner Katelyn Valenzuela
was headed for home plate as the

would-be tying run. but a charging
Morris picked up the groundball and
hurled it to Nelson in time for the tag
at home and the final out of the
game.
Junior pitcher Laura Severson
(14-4) pitched a complete game for
the Cardinal, giving up one run on six
hits. Anderson (21-4), who also

pitched the full seven innings, took
her second loss of the series, giving
up two runs on seven hits with six
strikeouts. Morris went 2-for-4 for
the Cardinal with a run scored and
Rinehart was also 2-for-4 with an
RBI.
The Bears avoided a scries sweep
Sunday, winning a hard-fought one

run battle. Galindo scored the lone
run of the game in the first inning
when a throw by Aggabao went off
the runner's helmet fora two-base
error. Kaleo Eldridge hit into a field
er's choice to bring Galindo home
from third.
The Cardinal had a chance to tie
the game in the bottom of the sev
enth, but Cal second baseman Jessi
ca Pamanian contributed two clutch
defensive plays to preserve the Cal
victory.
Jackie Rinehart reached base on
a double and advanced to third on a
sacrifice bunt by Aggabao. Howe's
hard liner looked like it would squirt
through to the outfield, but it
bounced off of the glove of the short
stop to Pamanian. who threw out
Rinehart at home.
Freshman Anna Beardman,
pinch running for Howe, stole sec
ond and advanced to third on a wild
throw by Cal catcher Haley Woods.
Senior Elizabeth Bendig hit a shot
toward second and Beardman took
off from third, but again Pamanian
stepped up, diving to knock the ball
out of the air and making the throw
to first to catch Bendig and end the
game.
McCullough (14-3) took the loss
for Stanford, despite giving up only
two hits and striking out five. Thor
son (18-4) got the win with seven
strikeouts. Smith went 2-for-3 on
Sunday and Rinehart was l-for-3,
giving her a weekend batting aver
age of .400 with three RBI.
Despite the close loss on Sunday,
the Cardinal said they considered
the weekend a success.
"With the rivalry, both teams are
really up for the game," Rittman
said. "Just like with any other team
though, you need to bring your 'A'
game and you can't let your emo
tions get to you. You need to play
your game, and I thought we did a
good job of that this weekend."
Stanford won the season series
against the Bears for the first time in
four years and this weekend also
marked the first time this season that
Cal has lost two games in a row. The
Cardinal will have little time to savor
the series victory however, as they
prepare to face Saint Mary's tomor
row and then set off on a grueling
road trip with a Friday afternoon
game in Washington, followed im
mediately by three games in Los An
geles.
"It's always nice to have two wins
over a Pac-10 team, no matter what
their ranking," Rinehart said. "We
know that we will have tough week
end on the road coming up, with four
games. So we will need to come out
strong for practice and work hard
this week."
