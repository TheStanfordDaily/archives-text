# Football back on the Farm

### ALEX GYR DESK EDITOR 
There is something different
about spring football. The sun is
shining, the nearby baseball and
Softball fields are packed and there is
a buzz about the upcoming season
— even if the first real game is still
more than four months away.
That feel was in the air this Satur
day at Stanford Stadium as the Car
dinal held their annual Spring Foot
ball Game, concluding 15 days of
spring practice under new head
coach Walt Harris.
The event, which was closer to a
series of drills than a full scrimmage.

brought locals, students, parents and
future recruits to get the first real
glimpse at next year's squad.
"The football aspect is really to
get the fans excited about next sea
son and to show them that the team
is really working hard and playing at
a certain level," said sophomore Doc
Dean, a fan who attended the event.
"It's just a good chance fore every
body to get out and see the team,
meet the guys and see how every
thing is working."
While football was the name of
the game, many fans came out to
enjoy themselves and socialize with
fellow football fans.
"It is also a social event as well as

[a] football [game]," Dean said. "It
was a good time to see some of my
friends at the game. Other than that
it was free food and the Oscar Mayer
Wienermobile."
On the field, the action was fairly
one-sided, with the offense scoring
on eight of its first nine possessions
and 11 times overall. It wasn't simply
a great offensive performance — the
defense was limited to just a few
plays to prevent giving away too
much to opposing teams that may
have scouts watching.
"We penalized the defense,"
Harris said. "We made them play

Stanford played its annual Spring Game at Stanford Stadium on Saturday. The game marked the end of the fifteen
day spring practice.
straight up."
Six of the Stanford scores came
through the air, four on the ground
and one on a fumble recovery. The
biggest play for the offense came on
a double-reverse by senior Hanker
Gerren Crochet, who raced down
the sideline fora 62-yard touch
down.
The one turnover of the scrim
mage occurred when sophomore
Nick Sanchez picked off a T.C. Os
trander pass late in the scrimmage.
"It has been a little tough at times,
but were growing steadily," Ostran
der, a junior, said. "We can see that
we're getting better. We can see that
guys are getting it better. It's going to
(ake a lot of dedication over the
spring and summer without coaches
there for us to really improve."
Ostrander split reps with last
year's starting quarterback, senior
Trent Edwards.
While most were optimistic with
the Cardinal's prospects, Saturday
showed that are clear areas for im
provement. For instance, the first
two kick attempts were blocked, and
Harris made it clear after the game
that the team is still not a finished
product.
"We're a long ways behind,"
Harris said. "We have so much to
do. I think all of us were hoping that
we were able to do more than what
we were actually able to do."
After the game the coaching staff
handed out awards to the four most
improved players through the spring
and the member of the team the
coaches deemed the "Unsung Play
er." Crochet and junior nosetackle
turned fullback Nick Frank took the
"Most Improved" awards on the of
fensive side, while junior linebacker
Michael Okwo and senior defensive
end Casey Carroll won it on defense.
Sophomore linebacker Brandon
Willetts won the "Unsung Player"
award.
"We were looking for guys that
bought into our program, worked
real hard and excelled." 11 arris said.
"We wanted to tell those players
that we appreciated the extr;i effort
that they give."
Stanford's next game won't come
until Sept. 10. when the Cardinal
head to Annapolis, Md. to face off
against Navy.
"That's going to be a real chal
lenge." Harris said. "Any time you
play on the road it's going to be
tough . . . and P.S., they won 10
games last year."
