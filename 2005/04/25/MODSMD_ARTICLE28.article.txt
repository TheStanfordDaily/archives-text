# Men's golf heads to Pac-10s
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The last lime wasn't good. It was disappointing and,
frankly, embarrassing.
The last time the Stanford men's golf team played in a
Pacific-10 Conference Championship, the Cardinal fin
ished l()th. How many teams are there in the Pac-10?
That's right.
This year, however, a new list of names will make up
Stanford's lineup as the team comes off a solid showing at
last weekend's U.S. Intercollegiate at Stanford, trying to
make its case fora spot in the NCAA Western Regional.
Should the Cardinal emerge victorious from this week's
Pac-10 Championship, they would lock up the confer
ence's automatic bid to the NCAA Regional. Barring a vic
tory. however, Stanford is playing to earn an at-large bid
from the selection committee, which will pick the top 12
teams from Stanford's district to advance to the regional
round of NCAA competition.
Though the selection system is anything but an exact
science, Stanford appears to be in decent shape heading
into today's opening round, ranked seventh in the most re
cent coaches' poll. With the Regional played at the Stan
ford Golf Course this year, a solid finish at Pac-lOs could
pave the way for Stanford's first team appearance at the
NCAA Championship since 19%.
"I feel like we've done pretty well head-to-head against
some of the teams on the 'bubble,'" coach Conrad Ray

said. "I'm confident that if we just go up to Pac-lOs with the
same goal we've had all year, kind of playing one'shot at a
time and not getting ahead of ourselves, we'll be okay."
Before the Cardinal start salivating at the chance to
compete at the Regional on their home course, attention
must turn this morning to the par-71 6,6()6-yard Walla
Walla Country Club in Walla Walla, Wash., a course Stan
ford has never played.
"We really don't know much about it," senior Pat
Phillips said. "[Although the course is short], if they have
narrow fairways, long rough and the greens are firm, the
golf course doesn't have to have much [length] to be diffi
cult."
In addition to tackling a new layout, players will also
have to adjust to an unusual competition format this week.
Instead of playing in teams of five and counting the four
best scores of each round toward the team total, schools
will bring six players each to the event, counting the lowest
five scores in the team competition.
Ray's lineup will include seniors Phillips and Kevin
Blue, juniors Kyle Gentry and Scott Mac Donald, sopho
more Matt Savage and freshman Rob Grube.
"It's definitely a tournament where we can play well."
Ray said. "I think our team that's going is well suited to the
course, from all accounts, and I think the morale is pretty
good with the team right now. and guys are feeling pretty
g<K)d about their game. I'm anxious to see what happens."
