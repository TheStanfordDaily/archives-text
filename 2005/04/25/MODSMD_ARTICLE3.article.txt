# 'Achievers' shatters stereotypes
## 
### DAVID KUO 
A workaholic. A shy and socially awkward comput
er programmer. A loveable stoner. A seductress. A tal
ented writer stuck penning one-liners for fortune cook
ies. These were the title roles of the Asian American
Theater Project's stereotype-busting show "Achiev
ers," which concluded its run yesterday in the Ballroom
of the Asian American Activities Center.
The five Asian-American college graduates por
trayed in the show inhabit a dank two-bedroom apart
ment in Los Angeles. Already missing their idyllic col
lege days, the quintet is evicted and must learn to adapt
to life's harsh realities, exploring their hopes, fears and
outgrowing their archetypes in the process.
One character. Murphy, the fortune-cookie author,
struggles to seek an Asian-American identity that tran
scends media stereotypes. At the same time, his friends
Ellen and Akira attempt to confront the painful scars of
their childhood in trying to reconcile who they are with
what their parents wanted them to become. In one
flashback, it is revealed that Akira's father sexually mo
lested her as a young girl, a wound that has never
healed.
While it addressed the difficult aspects of being an
Asian American, the play wasn't only about psycholog
ical dilemmas. Comic relief was in ample supply thanks

to the pre-med turned stoner and the socially awkward
porn collector. I n addition, the character Johnny Wang,
a figment of Murphy's imagination, served as the
counter-stereotype — he is bad at math, has a mon
strous vocabulary and is exceptionally well-endowed.
"Each character was distanced from their stereo
type," said Rich Liu, who plays the stoner Shingo. "The
play was a good way to send a message."
Director James Kung, a senior, said he believes the
billing of an all-Asian cast did not diminish from its ac
cessibility to all people.
""Achievers' used Asian-American motifs but the
writer, Michael Golamco, wrote it so that American
youth could relate to it,"he said.
Kung added that he felt the play addressed stereo
types in the media about Asian-Americans in perform
ing arts.
"There's this preconception that Asian-Americans
can't act," Kung said.
Freshman Gordon Koo, who attended the play, said
he felt that the performance was successful in forcing
the audience to rethink Asian-American identities in
the media.
"'Achievers' addressed issues that Asian-Ameri
cans face that aren't acknowledged by everyone else,"
he said. "The play broke through Asian-American
stereotypes."
