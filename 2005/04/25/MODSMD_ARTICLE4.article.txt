### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
An unidentified 19-year-old UC Berkeley
student was shot more than 30 times with a BB
gun by three members of the Pi Kappa Phi fra
ternity Friday in an alleged hazing incident.
The fraternity has since expelled the members
suspected of the shooting.
UC Berkeley university officials have yet
to take disciplinary action against the fraterni
ty or the three suspects, but the national chap
ter, Berkeley's Student Judicial Affairs board
and the judicial body within the university's
Interfraternity Council are investigating the
incident.
The student was a pledge of Pi Kappa Phi
and was allegedly picked up by approximately
15 fraternity members late Friday night. He
was then taken to the fraternity house where
he was stripped down to his t-shirt and boxers.
Fraternity members aged 19, 20 and 23 in
terrogated him as to the whereabouts of other
pledges, and when the student was not com
pliant, they tried to force him to drink beer

and smoke marijuana. When he refused, they
reportedly blew marijuana smoke in his face
and took turns shooting at his chest and arms.
The student left the house and checked
himself into the emergency room at Kaiser
Permanente Oakland Medical Center Satur
day. He was treated for welts and bruises and
a nurse contacted Berkeley police that
evening.
The student said he does not want to press
charges, but if the district attorney decides to
prosecute, the three suspects involved could
face felony charges of assault with a deadly
weapon and misdemeanor charges of battery
and discharging a firearm within city limits.
Officials at Pi Kappa Phi's national chapter
said the organization does not tolerate hazing.
UC Berkeley also has a strict zero-tolerance
policy on hazing and disciplined the fraternity
once before fora violation of the policy in 2001.
In recent years, the Berkeley chapter of Pi
Kappa Phi has been disciplined several times
for other offenses, including a fight in 2004, al
cohol violations and dangerous conduct in
2003 and alcohol use to recruit pledges in 2000.
