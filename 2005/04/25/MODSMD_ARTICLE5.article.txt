had been listed in critical condition since
being hospitalized. Hellen Allrich, media re

Clinics, confirmed Johnson's death yesterday
but would not provide further details.
Johnson was participating in Challenge
for Charity Weekend which is the culmina

efforts by West Coast business schools. Pro
ceeds from the event benefited the Special
Olympics, an organization that Johnson avid

ly supported.
Swimmers noticed Johnson on the bottom
of the pool during an inner-tube water polo
match and called 911. It remains unknown
how long he was submerged.
This week, he was surrounded by his im
mediate family, girlfriend and classmates at
Stanford Hospital.
Johnson grew up in Oregon and graduat

North American motor sports.
As Captain of the U.S. ice karting team, he
led the team to two world championships in
1999 and 2000. While at UC Irvine, Johnson
