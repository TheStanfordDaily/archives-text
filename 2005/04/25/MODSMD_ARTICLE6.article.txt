### DAISY CHUNG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford in Government took Earth Day as an opportu
nity to spotlight President George W. Bush's environmental
policies ranging from the trans-Atlantic oil pipeline to the
Kyoto Protocol. The group held a debate Friday to raise
awareness about the politics behind the environment.
The panelists addressed the prompt, "Is President Bush a
good or bad environmentalist?"
Experts from the Hoover Institution and the Stanford In
stitute for International Studies, or SI IS, offered perspectives
on recent environmental legislation and the Bush adminis
tration's track record.
Political Science Prof. David Victor, a senior fellow at
SIIS, said Bush's environmental policies have not been par
ticularly original.
"The Bush record has continuity with previous adminis
trations as far back as Reagan," he said. "It's probably the
same as what a Kerry administration would have done - not
the same as what they said they were going to do, but what
they would have been able to do."
The administration's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol was
a major point during the debate.
"The administration has lost some credibility domestical
ly by not layout out their objectives and internationally by re
jecting outright efforts to decrease emissions," said Econom
ics Prof. Larry Goulder, also a senior fellow at SIIS.
On this point, Victor reminded the audience that "the
president does not act alone — we need to talk about the ap
paratus that makes these decisions, which includes both the
president and Congress."
Thomas Moore, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution
and former advisor to President Ronald Reagan, called for
further analysis of the allocation of government funds.
"We could save millions of lives by spending a fraction of
the Kyoto Protocol funds on Africa and Southeast Asia," he
said. "We should examine the cost-benefit analysis and look
at how these policies affect human beings."
Goulder encouraged the audience to be more critical of
the way the media portrays environmental issues.
"An excellent direction for careers would be to study the
media," he said. "Looking at how it has changed as an insti
tution will better equip the public to deal with the informa
tion it presents."
Junior Adam Freedman attended the event in order to
understand the complexities of the administration's policies.
"When I read about the current administration's envi
ronmental policies, I am usually appalled," he said. "I
thought that in academic debate, I'd actually get an accurate
picture of the issues and feel less angry."
