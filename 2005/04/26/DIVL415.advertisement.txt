Greenhouse-gas concentrations diverged from their natural (orbital-scale)
trends millennia ago. CO2 levels began an anomalous rise 8,000 years ago just
as deforestation began in Europe, and methane levels began an anomalous
rise 5,000 years ago when irrigation for wet rice farming began in Southeast
Asia. Long before the industrial era, much of the southern tier of Eurasia was
deforested and many of the river valleys and even terraced hillsides were used
to grow rice. The anthropogenic anomalies -- the difference between the
observed gas concentrations and those expected from the orbital trends --
were 35-40 ppm for CO2 and -200-250 ppb for methane. The warmth of the
current interglacial is not natural -- had nature remained in control, Earth
would have cooled significantly by now, but the gases generated by
agriculture kept climate in a warm interglacial state.
