## Junkyard U.com lets students post for-sale and wanted ads 
### TOLU OLORUNNIPA 
"Find the stuff you never thought you would find," is the
slogan sketched amidst images of books, furniture, iPods and
cars at JunkyardU.com, a new electronic marketplace for
college students looking to find and sell items online.
But despite the catchy motto, the Web site hasn't quite
made it off the ground; there are no items listed for sale from
any California school.
Carey and Lisa Harnash. two recent post-graduate stu
dents based in South Florida, founded JunkyardU.com three
months ago. Carey Harnash, who attended the University of
Miami, said the frustration he and his wife experienced in try -
ing to buy and sell items using fliers and billboard announce
ments during college motivated them to create the Web site.
"What this does is give you a national audience," Carey
Harnash said of the Web site. "You don't have to worry
about anybody posting over you or the weather or anybody
pulling (your flyer] down. That's really the premise of the
site."
He added that the Web site is unique because it is both re
gion- and college-specific, giving students the option of
searching for items only at their schtx)! or in their state if they
so choose. Lisa 1 lam ash said that online auction sites such as
eßay are not geared specifically toward college students and
are not ideal for students who seek to buy large furniture.
Students can peruse appliances, books. DVDs, furniture,
instruments, tickets and even jobs offered at any school.
They can also view pictures and descriptions before decid

ing what to purchase. Because JunkyardU.com acts as a
classified ad Web site only and does not directly sell the
items it displays, students must contact the seller by phone
or e-mail.
The Web site, which the Harnashes said aims "to be the
largest on-line marketplace designed for and specifically
catering to college students," currently lists more than 350
colleges and universities.
To sell items, students can pay either $9.99 fora 30-day
listing or $14.99 fora 60-day listing.
Stanford students who have visited the Web site said they
have mixed feelings about the idea. Some, like freshman Tim
Edmond, said they liked the idea of avoiding shipping costs,
adding that they would definitely consider purchasing items
from students at Stanford or elsewhere in the Bay Area.
However, junior Dave Emme said that there are more
cost-efficient ways for college students to buy and sell items.
"Most things are available through connections on cam
pus," he said. "You can send an e-mail out on a list and always
find someone willing to pick it up."
Other students expressed concern about the Web site's
apparent lack of users. Junior Armando Munoz said that
other online options such as eßay and su.market — a Stan
ford resource for posting for-sale and wanted ads — are bet
ter-established and appealing for sellers.
"It's going to be hard for [the site] to get started," he said.
"When 1 go to the site and see that there are no users, I'm not
going to want to pay $9.99 if I know that not many people are
going to see [the posting]."
Carey Harnash said he remains optimistic about the site's
future.
"We're really going through a grassroots effort." he said,
adding that he is in the process of personally contacting vari
ous colleges to gain publicity for the site.
