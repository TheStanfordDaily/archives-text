# Google's book digitization projects faces some obstacles
## 
### JESSICA YU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Four months ago, Google announced its plans to
partner with five major institutions — University of
Michigan, Harvard University, Stanford University,
New York Public Library and Oxford University — in
an effort to make thousands of books digitally available
to the public. The logistics of the project are still uncer
tain. Moreover, publishers are concerned about possi
ble copyright violations.
However, according to Google and its partners, digi
tizing the thousands of texts held in each institution's
collection will make reliable resources readily available
to the public.
"The founders of Google had been trying to find out
how to organize the world's information and how to
make it universally accessible," said Adam Smith, prod
uct manager for Google Print, the division of Google
that is working on the project.
Universities such as Stanford are eager to cooperate.
The project allows for more "user-friendly access to the
texts [Stanford] has invested in," said Andrew
Herkovic, foundation relations and strategic projects
manager for Stanford's libraries. "Digitizing texts al
lows us to have much superior discovery and access to
the content we hold. There's a whole new future by an
alyzing texts through automated means. Think laser
precision guided research.'"
The "new future" may be a long way off. Considering
Stanford's enormous collection — more than 7.5 mil
lion books — the project will take years to complete, al
though Stanford hopes to have its entire collection digi
tized within a decade.
In order for Google to digitize Stanford's books,
Stanford must loan books in its collections to Google,
which will transport the volumes to its Mountain View,
Calif, headquarters. The books will be scanned and re
turned to Stanford's shelves.
However, logistics of the project are up in the air, as
Google and Stanford are caught up in the very early
stages of planning.

"We really don't know how many books Google will
be processing at a time," Hervokic said. "We don't
know if we can work out a process for getting the books
into their hands, scanned, and back into our system in
volumes that would suit their ambitions."
However, according to Herkovic, every effort will be
made to avoid disruption of library services.
"We will manage [disruptions] as best as we can. The
people here are committed to making sure this will not
disrupt our service to the community," said Herkovic.
"You might be out of luck with a book fora few weeks,
but we will ask Google for the book you are looking for,
if it comes to that. We're working very closely with the
library to ensure that there is none or very little disrup
tion over at the library."
In addition to exercising caution in ensuring that li
brary services are able to continue smoothly, the two
partners are taking heed in ensuring that they are not in
fringing copyright laws.
"Copyright issues are huge in the digital age," said
Herkovic. "It's very complicated. There are no tidy
ways to know: Do 1 have the right to copy this? We tend
to air on the side of: If in doubt, pay the fees."
Jonathan Zittrain. Co-director of Harvard Law
School's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, said
that Google and Stanford?s partnership does not violate
copyright law.
"Under U.S. law such digitization is what one would
call a 'prima facie' or 'at first glance' infringement," Zit-

train wrote in an e-mail to The Daily. "One would then
look to legal defenses and privileges, such as fair use. to
suggest that on balance, digitizing books that are no
longer in print for archival purposes is not in fact copy
right infringement."
According to Google, books considered part of the
public domain will be available for full viewing online,
while those under copyright or from publishers will only
be available in small excerpts.
To be considered part of the public domain, books
must be copyrighted before 1923 in the United States.
Outside of the United States, books must be copyright
ed before the 1900s to be considered part of the public
domain because different copyright laws apply interna
tionally.
By showing only sentences from books not consid
ered in the public domain, Zittrain said, Google appears
to abide by the law.
"Showing only snippets of a book, rather than entire
pages seems to be classic fair use," he wrote.
While some publishers have expressed their concern
over the project, none have threatened a lawsuit against
Google or any of the participating institutions.
"Surely there is a way — through some combina
tion of compulsory licensing, fair use, micropay
ments, and privileges for educational use — to make
millions of obscure but desired works instantly
searchable and available to those with interest," said
Zittrain.
