# Video games ON THE BRAIN

Video games have come a long way from the days of Ninten
do's Mario and his friends. Razor-sharp graphics, complicated
plots, live game options — even soundtracks and songs made
purely for the games — have enticed millions of users to spend
hours in front of their TV screens.
According to a study published by the University of Michigan,
college males spend an average of 16 hours playing video games
each week. The same study cited that eighth graders boys spend
about 23 hours a week playing video games, while the girls in the
same grade play about 12 hours a week on average.
One of the most popular games at Stanford is Halo for Mi
crosoft's Xbox. The plot of the game revolves around saving earth
from an alien onslaught with an arsenal of sophisticated weapons.
Last November, Microsoft sold 2.4 million copies of Halo 2, gener
ating $125 million in revenue and shattering all other records for
one-day media sales. The big draw for Halo is the multiplayer ac
tion, where up to 16 players per game can battle it out over the In
ternet on Xbox live or through Local Area Networks. Xbox live
players come from more than 24 countries. There are even several
groups dedicated to Halo enthusiasts on www.Thefacebook.com.
Sophomore psychology major Kenisha Harding is one of the
many dedicated Halo fans on campus.
l i played a few games before 1 came to Stanford, but now I
play a lot more because it's something to do take a study break,"
Harding said. "It's so easy to do when you have nothing else to do.
You can just call up a friend. Especially with Xbox live, you can
play with so many different people and pretty much whenever
you want to."
Another popular game is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas,
known as GTA. The game has a complicated plot: In order to save
family members in San Andreas, the player must take control of
the streets and find food to survive.
Senior Bobby DeHaro and his suitemates play GTA and
James Bond: Rogue Agent.
"I've never been a very big video game person," said DeHaro.
"I just like to play because it builds suite comradery. No one in our
suite is a video game addict, although one suitemate does stay up
late at night playing GTA."
Others have put down their game controls to pursue other ac
tivities. Senior John Wheaton plays games occasionally with his
friends in his fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, but doesn't play
games on his own.
"I don't play video games anymore," Wheaton said. "I used to
play a lot in high school, but now I do other stuff like play basket
ball outside."
