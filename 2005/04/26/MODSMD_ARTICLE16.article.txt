## Editorial eGroups holds promise, but has problems 
### 
If the latest venture from Stanford
Student Enterprises, or SSE, is success
ful, you'll soon see an end to lines of stu
dents waiting in White Plaza to buy tick
ets. The program, called eGroups, should
allow student groups to quickly and easi
ly set up online payment options for pur
chasing tickets or paying club dues.
The program is one of the most help
ful businesses to come out of the SSE in
many years. It holds promise to de
crease the logistical burden of student
groups and to facilitate easier payment
by students. In addition, eGroups offers
student group management tools and
automatic deposit into their ASSU
banking accounts. Still, eGroups will
only be successful if many student
groups use it. And as the costs of using
the service vary, costs that are too high
may scare away groups and buyers.
Thus far, eGroups has managed the
online sales for 10 student groups, most
notably the Senior Class' pub crawl tick
et sales during winter and spring quar
ters. The Web site generates and fulfills
the orders, while Pay Pal handles the fi
nancial part of the transaction.
By facilitating easier online transac
tion, eGroups allows student groups to
focus on their real goals — event plan
ning, C.D. creating, etc. — as opposed
to the logistical hassles associated with
student group sales.
In addition, the staff at SSE's Capital
Group have been willing to explain
eGroups to interested students. The
helpful attitude will go a long way to as
sist groups in moving from tried and
true practices of selling in White Plaza
to new e-commerce possibilities.
However, eGroups is not without

fault. While it provides a great service to
student groups, it does so at a cost. With
each transaction there is a shipping and
handling fee added to the amount of the
item, even when students pick up tickets
in White Plaza, and there is no shipping
or handling associated with the item. In
addition, sellers must pay a Pay Pal fee
of $0.30 plus 2.V percent per transaction.
This fee is among the lowest fees for
sellers on Web sites.
In addition, however, SSE charges
buyers and sellers for the service. They
currently charge student groups $10 for
the ability to have a posting online. The
flat fee is reasonable for the services
provided. But SSE also tacks on a trans
action fee to the buyer. This transaction
fee has ranged from $0.25 for pub crawl
tickets to $2.74 for senior formal tickets.
As a dollar amount, that isn't too high.
But when it equates to 4 to 5 percent of
a transaction, it may be enough to dis
suade students — some of whom, for
now at least, are hesitant to spend
money online — from using the service.
To SSE's credit, the Capital Group
has analyzed the fees and is attempting
to leverage them in the most effective
way. The group believes that buyers are
less sensitive to added fees than sellers.
While this may seem to be true at start,
given the small size of campus, there are
few sellers who will not later be buyers.
SSE has to tack on additional charges
to recoup its initial investment — but it
needs to be careful. Services such as
eGroups can dissuade customers by
charging too much per transaction. SSE
must search for the proper balance or
else it could turn students off and risk
failing at an innovative venture.
