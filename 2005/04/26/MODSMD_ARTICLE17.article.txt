# Holt's harangue
## Pledging the papal fraternity 
### 
After days of deliber
ation, the highly discern
ing brothers of Gamma
Omega Delta have se
lected their pledge class:
one exchange student
from Germany.
Ratzinger was given
the pledge name "Bene
dict," referring to his
ability to scarf scrambled

eggs at The Conclave's annual breakfast
cook-off. He was rolled out of his apartment
late at night, and while still in his white night
gown he found himself in front of millions of
people. Sure, they cheered, but I bet he was
a little embarrassed. In some of the press
photos you can see a teddy bear clutched in
his frightened hands.
The brothers of Gamma Omega Delta, or
"The Conclave" as they are commonly re
ferred to across campuses nationally, is an
ancient body (or comprised of ancient bod
ies, depending on your perspective). The
youngest member is taking Centrum silver
and the oldest voting member is 79. Benedict
isn't exactly a spring chicken, either; at 78
he's one of the oldest pledges ever.
Like most fraternities, it's exclusive and
limited to men. The Conclave used to be
called "Ye old he-man woman haters club,"
and in order to be a member, you had to
swear off the ladies. Thus, there has never
been one named Alfalfa. Although The
Conclave has dropped the older club name,
co-eds the world over continually describe

The Conclave's attitude as "high and
mighty."
1 give Benedict a lot of respect for going
through what has to be the most elaborate
and cruelest initiation rituals in the world.
Doing keg stands and running naked
through dorms pales in comparison to what
Benedict had to do. He basically had to have
the majority of 120 people decide that he is
God's Shepard on this planet. It's much
more than learning a fraternity handshake
and a handbook. You also have to be the
smartest kid in your Sunday school class.
Benedict was chosen and 1 give him papal
props for what his position demands. People
are right now poking fun at him because of
his name, his being a former Hitler Youth
member and his resemblance to the Emper
or. Yet I have to believe that The Conclave
took all of these things into account. Some
Cardinal had to have cracked a joke about
how his first edict would be about "crushing
the Jedi." I'm sure some wisenheimer pre
dicted that he would be the first pope in
lederhosen. Yet, after all of these hazing rit
uals. and probably some arcane ones we
don't even know about. The Conclave be
lieved he was still a strong enough candidate
for pledge-ship.
I 'm only guessing of course, because your
average fraternity or sorority has nothing on
The Conclave's secrecy. Imagine if after
every vote in your frat house, the ballots
were burned. Do you know how long it
