TFA alumnus' claims lack evidence
Teach for America, or TFA, founder Wendy
Kopp, in her heated initial response to the
recently published study of alternative certi
fication ("Considering the social responsi
bility of academia and journalism." April
18), called into question Education Prof.
Linda Darling-Hammond's research proto
cols and academic integrity. It was a charge
that sounded pretty weak coming from a
non-academic political activist with a specif
ic axe to grind. Now, Op-Ed writer Raphe
Beck, himself a former TFAer, complains
that he has "grown tired of hearing Darling-
Hammond criticize TFA from the comfort
of Stanford's halls" ("Teach for America de
serves credit," April 25).
Get real. Yes, Darling-Hammond is an
internationally recognized expert and re
searcher, but she is far from being an ivory
tower theorist. As those who have actually
been reading the papers lately know. Dar
ling-Hammond has been the driving force

behind East Palo Alto High School (now in
its fourth year) and the exciting new K-12
Stanford-affiliated charter that will soon he
serving that shamefully under-served com
munity. As one who works closely with Dar
ling-Hammond. I know from first-hand ex
perience how many long, difficult hours she
puts in creating, maintaining and nurturing
these schools and so many other important
projects.
I am sure that Beck was a wonderful TFA
teacher and that he really did, before leaving
teaching after two years, create a school
newspaper and produce plays and inspire
students who went on to become teachers
themselves. But then he makes the extraor
dinary claim that his experience ' was in
many ways typical of the thousands of TFA
corps members." Really? How does he
know that? Where is his evidence?
People will continue to debate (rationally
and courteously, 1 hope) how best to reform
