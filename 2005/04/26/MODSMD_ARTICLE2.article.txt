# Report outlines anthrax response
## 
### BEA SANFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Almost four years after the anthrax scare swept the
United States, a study has been published on how to
respond in the event of a widespread attack.
The report — a collaboration between the Veter
ans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Stanford
University School of Medicine and the University of
Toronto — found that combined usage of antibiotics
and vaccination is the most cost-effective way to treat
people in the wake of an attack. It also estimated the
cost of treatment at $46,099 per person.
The findings serve to "reinforce guidelines already
developed by experts and add greater weight to
them," said Robert Fowler — one of the authors of
the study and a former Stanford postdoctoral scholar
now at the University of Toronto — even though
much of the study's conclusions may be what others
