# Report outlines anthrax response
## 
### BEA SANFORD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Almost four years after the anthrax scare swept the
United States, a study has been published on how to
respond in the event of a widespread attack.
The report — a collaboration between the Veter
ans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Stanford
University School of Medicine and the University of
Toronto — found that combined usage of antibiotics
and vaccination is the most cost-effective way to treat
people in the wake of an attack. It also estimated the
cost of treatment at $46,099 per person.
The findings serve to "reinforce guidelines already
developed by experts and add greater weight to
them," said Robert Fowler — one of the authors of
the study and a former Stanford postdoctoral scholar
now at the University of Toronto — even though
much of the study's conclusions may be what others

would deem common sense, he
added.
Senior author Douglas Owens,
senior investigator at Veteran Af
fairs Palo Alto and associate pro
fessor of medicine at Stanford's
Center for Primary Care and Out
comes Research and the Center
for Health Policy in the Stanford
Institute for International Studies,
said that the study emphasized the
importance of vaccination treat
ment alongside of antibiotics,
while more emphasis has been
given to antibiotic treatment in the
past.
The study also stressed the im
portance of responding quickly in
the event of an attack.
"If there were a large-scale an
thrax attack, we will have to treat a
million people or more in poten
tially a few days, maybe not even a
few days," Owens said. "You real
ly have to be prepared to give an
tibiotic prophylaxis and vaccina
tions to a lot of people in a very
short time."
The likelihood of an anthrax at
tack remains mostly a matter of
speculation. However, if an attack
did occur, results could be cata
strophic if people were not pre
pared to respond swiftly and effec
tively. he added.
"Officials agree that bio-terror
ism is a very serious threat,"
Owens said.'"lf [an anthrax attack]
occurs, hundreds of thousands or
more could be killed."
While Owens said that different
cities could potentially have differ
ent plans of response, he explained
that "the point is [that) people
need to plan for distribution sys
tems."
Owens said he hoped the study
would motivate people to develop
such systems, claiming that "in
most places we're not that well
prepared."
Although most experts agree
that staging an anthrax attack
would be hard, only a limited num
ber of chemicals exist that could be
effectively used as a bioterrorism
weapon, and anthrax is near the
top of the list. Fowler said.
"While [staging an anthrax at
tack] is relatively difficult, it is
possible," he said, adding that "it
already happened in a small
way." when in September of 2001,
22 anthrax cases resulted in five
deaths.
Because no widespread attack
has yet occurred, those running the
study had to rely on conjecture to
gauge the risks of a possible attack.
"Coming up with a model fora
rare event that hasn't happened
yet is difficult," Fowler said. "We
used a mathematical model that
tried to predict risks that are un
known, and used what data is
available, mostly expert opinion."
