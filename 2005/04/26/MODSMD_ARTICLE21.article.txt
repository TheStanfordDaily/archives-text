# Tales of a 19th-grade nothing
## Campus traffic and the miracle of the four-way stop 
### 
California traffic is pretty bad. In fact,
we may have the most infamously had traf
fic this side of the Big Apple. 1, for one, find
it endlessly annoying to have to go any
where near the only major U.S. city that
does not have a single highway that goes
completely through it as if taking part in
the misery that is San Francisco traffic is
some sort of civic burden which balances
the city's other charms. Try driving a stan
dard transmission car up a street so steep
you can't see it over your hood. But traffic
on the suburban Stanford campus is an
equally brilliant jewel in the country's
worst-traffic-state crown.
It's easy to see why such a simple traffic
system was chosen. I mean, 1 am often con
fused by the awkward "grid" pattern used
in the rest of Palo Alto and much prefer the
meandering loop method instead. In addi
tion. the absence of through streets is an ex
cellent excuse to make Stanford students
the world's foremost experts on the word
"bollards." (Seriously, say that word to any
of your friends who don't go to school here
and see what happens.) I have to admit,
though, I do get a little chuckle when some
campus-driving rookie heads the wrong
way down one of campus loops at night.
Most egregiously, however, in a throw
back to simpler times, there are no traffic
lights on campus to deal with the myriad
intersections - there is only (be it ever so

humble) the four-way
stop. Now, the concept
is simple, and seductive
ly so (as evidenced by
the fact that there are
1,022 of them). You see,
the guiding principle is
"taking turns," which
the majority of the
early-private-preschool
crowd should be familiar

with from. say. about age 2 (if your parents
ever opted fora "discussion" with you in
stead of a spanking before you were 5, this
is you). You see. if you are the last of the
cars to arrive at the intersection, you are
the last to go.
This, unfortunately, is only how it works
in the rest of the world. On the Stanford
campus, there are a few corollary rules: 1) if
you have an expensive car, you have the
right of way at all times, especially if you did
not pay for that car. This is in sharp contrast
to the rest of the world where if you drive
something valuable you usually don't want
to put it in an altercation with a '92 Celica
with more bumper stickers than original
paint. 2) If someone is turning across the
campus loop then at least two cars that are
staying "on the loop" are allowed to go con
secutively. I mean, turners are obviously al
most to where they're going, so what kind
of hurry can they be in? 3) Coming to a

complete stop means that you're not in a
hurry, and two or more cars can go in front
of you. Everyone who needs to get some
where is always rolling, so the stoppers can
wait. 4) You can always inherit the right-of
way of anyone you can get parallel with.
Then, as in White Plaza, there are the bicy
cles.
At the four-way stop, only the first bicy
cle has to stop, then while they're crossing,
every other cyclist that can see the intersec
tion is allowed to go right through. As an
extra challenge to motorists, some of them
do actually stop and will then engage you in
a fun game of' Are-you-gonna-hit-me?" to
pass the time. As a fun alternative, if traffic
gets too hectic, and traffic rules too burden
some, they can always just take their bikes
onto the sidewalks, where they only have to
stop if they kill a pedestrian. What's worse,
the crime rates have been so high recently
that they've only been able to spare a few
Stanford sheriffs to devote to policing this
stop-sign misbehavior.
For my part, I'm just going to stick with
taking turns. Because blessed are the keep
ers of the four-way stop, for they shall in
herit the turn.
