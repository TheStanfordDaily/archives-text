### SAMANTHA FRENCH 
On April 18. Navin Sivanandam wrote an
entertaining column about the "no sex" phe
nomenon plaguing graduate students at
Stanford University ("Welcome to Ihe
champagne room"). His column, while en
gaging, was a bit simplistic. Stating that grad
uate students here don't have sex is like com
menting on the tendency of the sun to set at
night: It's obvious. I'm here to tell you why,
as well as to rebut his April 25 follow-up ar
ticle ("But some of my best friends are grad
uate students") in which he attempts to de
fend the social habits of graduate students at
Stanford.
Stanford University is the third (and last)
graduate school I've attended. As such. I
consider myself fairly well-qualified to com
ment on the social scene (or lack thereof)

here. To put it nicely (and I'm being gener
ous here), graduate students — and particu
larly those at Stanford — are socially malad
justed.
I had a relatively normal experience as an
undergrad at a private university much like
Stanford. I had fun. I partied and I joined a
sorority. All the while, I was ambitious and
academically successful.
Then I went to law school. Let me just tell
you this: Attending three years of law school
will make you think twice about ever hiring
an attorney to represent you. I'd guess that
more than 75 percent of my graduating class
was heavily medicated at some point during
our legal education. You name the flavor of
crazy, I saw it in law school. Understandably,
the social environment was representative of
this dysfunction.
And then I came to Stanford. Stanford is

a unique blend of bona fide social maladjust
ment coupled with a weak attempt to dis
guise said maladjustment with a thin veneer
of "California cool." Not so much. Students
here do not say "thank you" when someone
holds the door for them. They don't cover
their mouths when they cough, nor do they
appear to regularly engage in acts of person
al hygiene. The social interactions 1 have had
with students at this school are laughable,
and they indicate that common social decen
cy is not a concept that is grasped by these
otherwise intellectual individuals. Here are a
couple of choice examples:
A short time ago I told a male friend in
the graduate school that I thought he has
nice hair. Apparently, in language under
stood by Stanford grad students, this trans-
lates roughly to "I want to mount you" or
"I've got the herp" or something equally re
pulsive and untrue.
At the beginning of the year, I met a
male grad student for the purposes of orga
nizing some graduate-level social events.
He seemed like a nice guy. And he later e
mailed me to ask if I wanted to go to dinner
with him. I said sure, and we had a fun time
at dinner. A week later I received an e-mail
from him stating that there just wasn't any
chemistry between us. I didn't even think it
was a date. Seriously. Who asks people out
via e-mail anyway? Oh yeah, Stanford grad
students do. Seriously though, a mere con
versation — or even a social outing — does
not a date make. I get drinks with my male
friends. I go to dinner with them. Welcome
to the 21st century people: men and women
can be friends.
Remember how I mentioned I joined a
sorority as an undergrad ? Well despite the
concerns of many Greek-skeptics, I was
never hazed nor was I ever sexually as
saulted at a frat party. No my friends, the
latter happened here, at a GSC-sponsored
party in the new Graduate Community
Center. While ultimately a harmless occur
rence, this incident serves to illustrate my
point, which is that social interactions in
the Stanford graduate community are thor

oughly abnormal.
I think that at least a partial explanation
for the social retardation among Stanford
graduate students can be found in the fact
that 29-year-old individuals live in dorms.
Yeah, I know you all balk when I say dorms
— hey, I hate to break it to you, but you're
living in a dorm. There's no other way to say
it, so deal. This seems to sort of halt the so
cial development process at, oh, say fresh
man year of college. Furthermore, no mat
ter how much he might hit it off with a po
tential hookup, when a 29 year-old man, at
tractive as he may be, invites a female back
to his dorm room, you've gotta laugh.
That's so hot.
To be fair, I don't mean to insinuate that
friendship is impossible to find at the gradu
ate level. I have many lifelong friends from
the various universities I've attended, and I
feel extremely fortunate to have had some
really wonderful experiences. But by and
large, the social maladjustment of graduate
students — particularly at Stanford —is a
formidable deterrent to the formation of
healthy relationships. Trust me, I've tried.
Based on the foregoing reasoning, it is not
difficult to understand why sex is unattain
able for most graduate students at Stanford.
If they can't even master the basics of friend
ship, what makes them eligible to conquer
the more intricate and highly complex nu
ances of a sexual relationship?
