On April 18. Navin Sivanandam wrote an
entertaining column about the "no sex" phe
nomenon plaguing graduate students at
Stanford University ("Welcome to Ihe
champagne room"). His column, while en
gaging, was a bit simplistic. Stating that grad
uate students here don't have sex is like com
menting on the tendency of the sun to set at
night: It's obvious. I'm here to tell you why,
as well as to rebut his April 25 follow-up ar
ticle ("But some of my best friends are grad
uate students") in which he attempts to de
fend the social habits of graduate students at
Stanford.
Stanford University is the third (and last)
graduate school I've attended. As such. I
consider myself fairly well-qualified to com
ment on the social scene (or lack thereof)

here. To put it nicely (and I'm being gener
ous here), graduate students — and particu
larly those at Stanford — are socially malad
justed.
I had a relatively normal experience as an
undergrad at a private university much like
Stanford. I had fun. I partied and I joined a
sorority. All the while, I was ambitious and
academically successful.
Then I went to law school. Let me just tell
you this: Attending three years of law school
will make you think twice about ever hiring
an attorney to represent you. I'd guess that
more than 75 percent of my graduating class
was heavily medicated at some point during
our legal education. You name the flavor of
crazy, I saw it in law school. Understandably,
the social environment was representative of
this dysfunction.
And then I came to Stanford. Stanford is

a unique blend of bona fide social maladjust
ment coupled with a weak attempt to dis
guise said maladjustment with a thin veneer
of "California cool." Not so much. Students
here do not say "thank you" when someone
holds the door for them. They don't cover
their mouths when they cough, nor do they
appear to regularly engage in acts of person
al hygiene. The social interactions 1 have had
with students at this school are laughable,
and they indicate that common social decen
cy is not a concept that is grasped by these
otherwise intellectual individuals. Here are a
couple of choice examples:
A short time ago I told a male friend in
the graduate school that I thought he has
nice hair. Apparently, in language under
stood by Stanford grad students, this trans-
