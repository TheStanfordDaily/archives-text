### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Ten Stanford students will be heading to the
Ecuadorian capital of Quito this summer de
spite recent political upheavals including the
dismissal of the Supreme Court and the re
moval of President Luck) Gutierrez.
Members of the student organization Vol
unteer in Latin America, or VI LA, said the sit
uation in Quito is safe and their plans for the
summer will not be affected. Every year Stan
ford students volunteer at a center for street
children in Quito from July to September.
"I don't feel that we are going to be affected
in any way, or that anything is going to prevent
us from doing what we are going to do —we
are gong to be fine," said Patricia Hernandez, a
senior who is one of two trip leaders for VILA
thisvear.

Hernandez went to Quito as one of eight
volunteers two years ago and has been in a in
stant a intact with host families and people who
work at the center. She said the word from
Quito is that everything is under control, there
is no violence and stability will be maintained.
"People didn't like the president or what he
stood for," Hernandez said "Now it is going to
be all about the people and a chance for the
people to get the change they want to see hap
pen"
The ousted president of Ecuador was re
moved from office by Congress on April 20 for
' 'abandonment of the post." His vice president,
Alfredo Palacio, has since replaced Gutierrez
and appointed a new cabinet. However, no
L-atin American nation has yet recognized the
Palacio government.
Ecuador, a country of 125 million, has had
six presidents since 19%, three of whom were

later driven from office. Weeks of protests and
the militiiry's withdrawal of support eventually
forced Gutierrez to flee the country to Brazil,
where he anil his family were granted asylum
Protesters began to accuse Gutierrez —an
ex-army colonel who participated in a coup in
20(X)—of corruption when he attempted to
overhaul the Supreme Court. Some of his eco
nomic pt ilicies have spurred criticism and anger
for hurting the natit >n's ptxjr.
"We've been reading all about it in the
news," said VILA organizer Rachel Nieder
man, a junior, who asserted that all VILA'S
a>ntads in Quito assure her the situation is
under control. Ihe State Department has not
issued a travel warning in Ecuador despite the
situation, she added.
"We have been talking about the news and
what that might mean for our program."
she said. "The people in Ecuador are pret
ty happy that the president is not in power
anymore and there isn't an uprising. It is
pretty stable and it won't affect our ability
to get in, be safe, and effectively help the
shelter."
The shelter where Stanford students
will be volunteering is locally funded and
caters to street children, some of whom
live at the facility. Four Stanford students
will be living in the center at a time, pro
viding tutoring and other services for the
children.
