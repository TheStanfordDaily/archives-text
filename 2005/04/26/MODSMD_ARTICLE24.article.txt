# Alumna to take the reigns at NRA
## 
### FRANCIE NEUKOM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Standing 5-feet-tall, 55-year-old alumna
Sandra Froman, an attorney from Tucson,
would probably be the hist person mistaken
fora gun enthusiast. But behind her mild
mannered facade lies the soul of an experi
enced hunter — not to mention the new
president of the National Rifle Association.
Appointed at the association's annual con
vention last weekend, she is the second
woman to ever hold this post.
But Froman, Class of 1971, was not al
ways a gun lover. In fact, she grew up in San
Francisco in a firearm-free environment.
"I didn't have any strong feeling about
them one way or another," she told The Los
Angeles Times in an April 18 article.
Her attitude changed when a strange
man attempted to break into her Los Ange
les house at night when she was home alone.
"I had no way to protect myself," she
said in an interview with Casa Grande Val
ley Newspapers on April 19. "Fortunately,
the fellow didn't get into the house, but I
was very frightened and very angry that
somebody would try to break in."
Froman called the called the incident an
epiphany, inspiring her to reevaluate her
lifestyle.

"What would have happened if he had
gotten in?" she said. "I had to take respon
sibility for my own personal safety."
The very next day, Froman signed up for
a number of gun-safety and marksmanship
classes at a nearby gun store. She soon pur
chased her own semiautomatic pistol and
began competing in shooting competitions.
It was then that she started to notice the dif
ference between her friends at the firing
range and those at her law firm, especially
concerning their politics and opinions to
ward guns.
"I would go to the range and everybody
was very friendly," she said. "When I would
talk to the lawyers in my law firm, they were
horrified that I had a gun and was learning
how to shoot. When I was at the range, I
asked one of the folks, 'Why do some people
not like guns?' And this man said to me that
if I wanted to learn about the politics of gun
control, I should join the NRA. So I did."
Her interest in guns grew steadily, and
she even spoke at a constitutional-rights
rally in Phoenix about the freedom to own
firearms. After the speech, a former presi
dent of the N R A approached her and asked
if she had ever considered running for the
NRA's board of directors. She followed his
advice, eventually holding the position of
vice president before becoming president

last weekend.
Froman told The Los Angeles Times
that she hopes to attract more women to the
NRA during her term as president. Ihe as
sociation estimates that there are currently
2 million female hunters and 4 million fe
male target-shooters nationwide. Women
have become an important source of new
membership for the organization, and
NRA officials have attributed the develop
ment of all-female programming to Fro
man's efforts.
"We have Women on Target programs
now — instructional programs and hunting
programs for women that are taught by
women for women to get more women in
volved in the shooting sports," Froman said,
in The Times article.
"Froman said she believes strongly in the
value of the NRA as an institution and sees
gun control as a broader issue than most
people consider it to be.
"The NRA isn't just about owning a
gun." she told Casa Grande Valley News
papers. "It's about freedom. It's about mak
ing sure that the values that make America
great continue to be the values that this
country lives by and that the efforts that our
forefathers made to secure freedom in
America are not forgotten and are always
celebrated and preserved."
