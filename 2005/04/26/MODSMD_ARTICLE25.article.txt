# Math professor hired away by Harvard Univ.

### JIN YOON 
Despite the University's efforts to keep
him on the Stanford faculty. Mathematics
Prof. Horng-Tzer Yau has decided to de
part the Farm for Harvard University,
where he will become a tenured professor
on July 1.
Before arriving at Stanford two years
ago, Yau was a professor at New York Uni
versity's Courant Institute of Mathematical
Sciences. Throughout his academic career,
he has contributed to the study of mathe
matical physics and partial differential
equations.
In 2(X)2, he received the Mac Arthur
Foundation Fellowship, which is often re
ferred to as the "genius grant" and award
ed to people who show exceptional merit in
their field. During his two years at Stan
ford. he taught two graduate courses, "Par
tial Differential Equation," and "Mathe
matical Physics."
Besides teaching and researching, he
contributed to the mathematics communi
ty by running mathematics and mathemat
ical physics seminars. He was also involved
in the faculty recruiting process, serving on
the Appointment Committee last year.
"We are extremely sorry, because he's a
great mathematician," said Yakov Eliash-

berg, chair of the Mathematics Depart
ment. "It's a big loss."
Mathematics Prof. Rate Mazzeo, a col
league, echoed the same sentiment.
"He's a very distinguished mathemati
cian, very gifted man in every way," he said.
The rationale for his departure remains
unclear, and Eliashberg refused to com
ment on Yau's personal reasons for leav
ing. He also emphasized that the Dean's of
fice and the Mathematics Department
tried very hard to keep him through "what
ever means available."
According to an April 19 article in The
Harvard Crimson, Harvard Mathematics
Department Chair Joseph Harris applaud
ed the administration for doing "whatever
it took to get the guy (Yau)."
As one of various tactics to attract facul
ty members. Stanford helps them secure
housing by making special loans available,
Eliashberg said. Stanford's Mathematics
Department recently recruited Andras
Vasy, an associate professor at MIT who
has done extensive work with linear partial
differential equations, he added.
Eliashberg noted that even though
Stanford is hiring many brilliant mathe
maticians, Yau's role "cannot be replaced."
When approached for an interview, Yau
declined to comment.
