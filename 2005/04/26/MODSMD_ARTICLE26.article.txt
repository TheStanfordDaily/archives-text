# Campaign volunteers speak at Dems meeting

### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Democrats got a taste of what
next year's California Democratic gubernatorial
primary might hold last night when representa
tives from the campaigns of candidates Phil An
gelides and Steve Westly addressed the group's
weekly meeting at the Nitery in Old Union.
"1 think Democrats have been, for lack of a
better word, 'wusses' for too long. We need a fire
breather," said Noah Finneburgh. volunteer for
the campaign of State Treasurer Phil Angelides.
Finneburgh painted Angelides as "the anti-
Arnold," saying voters would respect the way he
had stood up to Republican Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger from the beginning.
Steve Aronowitz, political director for State
Controller Steve Westly's campaign, said Westly,
who has a background in business and education
as well as politics, stands a better chance of at
tracting moderates and independents.
"Quite frankly, 1 think he's the candidate who
can win," Aronowitz said. "The message of rais
ing taxes is not one that can win."
Both representatives said their respective can
didates would welcome Stanford activists into
their campaigns. Aronowitz, a Stanford graduate,
said Westly would be receptive to giving Stanford
students positions of responsibility in his cam
paign and already has several working for him.
Westly is a Stanford alumnus and was a lec
turer at the Graduate School of Business before

being elected controller. Aronowitz, now a sec
ond-year law student at UC-Berkeley, said West
ly was his freshman adviser in 19%.
Sophomore Marie Jonas, president of the
Stanford Democrats, said the group invited the
representatives in order to "raise some questions
about what kind of party we want to see, what
kind of candidate we want to work for."
Jonas said the Stanford Democrats cannot en
dorse political candidates, but many of their
members individually volunteer for campaigns.
She said one of the group's goals is to get mem
bers involved in state-level politics, since they
have a better chance of being influential instate
campaigns than in national campaigns.
Likely joining Angelides and Westly in the
race will be State Attorney General Bill Lockyer,
who has not yet launched his campaign.
While Westly and Lockyer both publicly sup
ported Schwarzenegger early on in his governor
ship, Angelides has persistently opposed the Re
publican.
Finneburgh implied that Westly and Lockyer
had not done enough to distinguish themselves
from the celebrity governor, who despite a recent
slip in approval ratings, would still be a strong fa
vorite to win re-election against any Democrat,
according to polls. Aronowitz countered by say
ing that voters would respect Westly's indepen
dent thinking and penchant for innovation. An
gelides has been in politics and public service for
30 years, while Westly earned a fortune with
e√üay.
