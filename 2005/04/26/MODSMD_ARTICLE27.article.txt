## Soto Tape Chronicles Plenty of drama at the NFL Draft 
### 
My favorite Simpsons episode is the one
in which Lisa becomes a star hockey
goalie. The episode opens at a school
assembly where Lisa finds out that she has
failed gym class. At home. Marge consoles her
despondent daughter by reminding her that
sports aren't everything.
At that moment Homer comes walking into
the kitchen chanting, to the tune of a stadium
organ, "Sports! Sports! Sports! Sports! Sports!
Sports! Sports! Sports!"
Welcome to my life.
At one point I had aspirations of making it
as an athlete. My Spanish grandfather used to
promise me that he would talk to an old friend
of his from the war who became a celebrated
scout for FC Barcelona, and together they
would sign me to a professional soccer con-

tract. Part of the deal was
that I would quit school,
move to Spain and train at
the youth soccer academy in
Barcelona.
Those dreams were
dashed by my parents (mer
cilessly and repeatedly) and
by my vertical leap of two
sheets of paper (you can kind
of slip them under me with-

out wrinkling if you do it really fast).
I'm not bitter about it, and as a fan 1 really
like seeing others succeed. With that in mind, I
spent some time last weekend watching the
National Football League anoint its next gen
eration of superstars.
As far as sports drafts go, the NFL draft is
mildly captivating. Unlike baseball teams that
pick high school kids no one has heard of, the
NFL looks for talent among a set of recogniz
able names whose college games are nationally
televised. And unlike baseball players, whom
you won't see in a major league uniform for at
least three years, you know that the football
players chosen in the first rounds will soon get
a chance to prove themselves professionally.
There is added drama in the NFL draft be
cause there is no single player who can guaran
tee success for the team that chooses him. Un
like basketball, football is too complex and too
much of a team sport for one person to domi
nate. And since size is a premium, that one per
son will not be an 18-year-old who has never
set foot in a college classroom.
The draft has the requisite dose of excite
ment and everyone holds his breath when NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue steps to the
podium to announce a selection. Behind the
scenes there is enough back-room scheming
and closed-door dealing to make the United
Nations proud.
If I were better versed in the social sciences
I would try to draw a correlation between the
risk tolerance of teams and their first-round se
lections. I think it would be fascinating to see if
commentators are correct when they say that
certain players are too immature to play pro
fessional ball. There was lots of talk of Maurice
Clarett, but what evidence is there that his col
lege performance and woes will imply future
success?
Look at the cases of Lawrence Phillips and
Randy Moss, two troubled but talented college
players. Seven years into his career. Moss is an
indisputable success and is considered one of
the top receivers in the league. Phillips, on the
other hand, never found his way, and after ar
rests for drug use and domestic violence and
stints in Europe and Canada, he bowed out of
football.
Knowing which players are more likely to
