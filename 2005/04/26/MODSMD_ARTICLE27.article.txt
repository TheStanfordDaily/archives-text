## Soto Tape Chronicles Plenty of drama at the NFL Draft 
### 
My favorite Simpsons episode is the one
in which Lisa becomes a star hockey
goalie. The episode opens at a school
assembly where Lisa finds out that she has
failed gym class. At home. Marge consoles her
despondent daughter by reminding her that
sports aren't everything.
At that moment Homer comes walking into
the kitchen chanting, to the tune of a stadium
organ, "Sports! Sports! Sports! Sports! Sports!
Sports! Sports! Sports!"
Welcome to my life.
At one point I had aspirations of making it
as an athlete. My Spanish grandfather used to
promise me that he would talk to an old friend
of his from the war who became a celebrated
scout for FC Barcelona, and together they
would sign me to a professional soccer con-

tract. Part of the deal was
that I would quit school,
move to Spain and train at
the youth soccer academy in
Barcelona.
Those dreams were
dashed by my parents (mer
cilessly and repeatedly) and
by my vertical leap of two
sheets of paper (you can kind
of slip them under me with-

out wrinkling if you do it really fast).
I'm not bitter about it, and as a fan 1 really
like seeing others succeed. With that in mind, I
spent some time last weekend watching the
National Football League anoint its next gen
eration of superstars.
As far as sports drafts go, the NFL draft is
mildly captivating. Unlike baseball teams that
pick high school kids no one has heard of, the
NFL looks for talent among a set of recogniz
able names whose college games are nationally
televised. And unlike baseball players, whom
you won't see in a major league uniform for at
least three years, you know that the football
players chosen in the first rounds will soon get
a chance to prove themselves professionally.
There is added drama in the NFL draft be
cause there is no single player who can guaran
tee success for the team that chooses him. Un
like basketball, football is too complex and too
much of a team sport for one person to domi
nate. And since size is a premium, that one per
son will not be an 18-year-old who has never
set foot in a college classroom.
The draft has the requisite dose of excite
ment and everyone holds his breath when NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue steps to the
podium to announce a selection. Behind the
scenes there is enough back-room scheming
and closed-door dealing to make the United
Nations proud.
If I were better versed in the social sciences
I would try to draw a correlation between the
risk tolerance of teams and their first-round se
lections. I think it would be fascinating to see if
commentators are correct when they say that
certain players are too immature to play pro
fessional ball. There was lots of talk of Maurice
Clarett, but what evidence is there that his col
lege performance and woes will imply future
success?
Look at the cases of Lawrence Phillips and
Randy Moss, two troubled but talented college
players. Seven years into his career. Moss is an
indisputable success and is considered one of
the top receivers in the league. Phillips, on the
other hand, never found his way, and after ar
rests for drug use and domestic violence and
stints in Europe and Canada, he bowed out of
football.
Knowing which players are more likely to


Jordi Mata-Fink
do well in the NFL would take
away some of the crapshoot fun of
the draft. But we would still be left
with the human drama that makes
the draft worth watching. Much
like NBC's coverage of the
Olympics, ESPN intersperses in
sightful commentary and analysis
with human interest stories about
the lives of the young men called to
the podium.
Alex Smith, the first overall pick,
chose Utah over Harvard, complet
ed his economics degree in four
semesters, and now stands to resur
rect the miserable 49ers franchise.
Adam "Pac-Man" Jones, the
sixth overall pick by Tennessee, is
the first man in his family to live
past the age of 21. His father and
uncle were both murdered in their
teens and Pac-Man now takes his
little brother around with him ev
erywhere to protect him from
harm.
Stories like these put faces with
names and help fans connect with

the players, which in turn gives us
some small amount of vicarious
thrill.
The most intriguing part of the
draft was watching the expression
on the face of Cal quarterback
Aaron Rodgers who. for three ago
nizing hours, sat in the convention
center waiting for his name to be
called. Projected as a top-five pick,
Rodgers fell to No. 24 before Green
Bay chose him as the successor to
Brett Favre.
Arguably. Rodgers is in the best
imaginable situation fora young
quailerback— he can sit on the
sidelines fora few years and learn
the system from a master before
being thrown to the wolves — but
I'm sure this did not make the wait
any less painful.
I guess Rodgers now knows, if
only fora brief instant, what it's like
to be the one who fails gym class and
is the last one chosen on the play
ground. Maybe, once the signing
bonus lands in the bank account,
he'll use the slight as motivation and.
like Lisa, prove himself to the
naysayers

My favorite Simpsons episode is the one
in which Lisa becomes a star hockey
goalie. The episode opens at a school
assembly where Lisa finds out that she has
failed gym class. At home. Marge consoles her
despondent daughter by reminding her that
sports aren't everything.
At that moment Homer comes walking into
the kitchen chanting, to the tune of a stadium
organ, "Sports! Sports! Sports! Sports! Sports!
Sports! Sports! Sports!"
Welcome to my life.
At one point I had aspirations of making it
as an athlete. My Spanish grandfather used to
promise me that he would talk to an old friend
of his from the war who became a celebrated
scout for FC Barcelona, and together they
would sign me to a professional soccer con-

tract. Part of the deal was
that I would quit school,
move to Spain and train at
the youth soccer academy in
Barcelona.
Those dreams were
dashed by my parents (mer
cilessly and repeatedly) and
by my vertical leap of two
sheets of paper (you can kind
of slip them under me with-

out wrinkling if you do it really fast).
I'm not bitter about it, and as a fan 1 really
like seeing others succeed. With that in mind, I
spent some time last weekend watching the
National Football League anoint its next gen
eration of superstars.
As far as sports drafts go, the NFL draft is
mildly captivating. Unlike baseball teams that
pick high school kids no one has heard of, the
NFL looks for talent among a set of recogniz
able names whose college games are nationally
televised. And unlike baseball players, whom
you won't see in a major league uniform for at
least three years, you know that the football
players chosen in the first rounds will soon get
a chance to prove themselves professionally.
There is added drama in the NFL draft be
cause there is no single player who can guaran
tee success for the team that chooses him. Un
like basketball, football is too complex and too
much of a team sport for one person to domi
nate. And since size is a premium, that one per
son will not be an 18-year-old who has never
set foot in a college classroom.
The draft has the requisite dose of excite
ment and everyone holds his breath when NFL
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue steps to the
podium to announce a selection. Behind the
scenes there is enough back-room scheming
and closed-door dealing to make the United
Nations proud.
If I were better versed in the social sciences
I would try to draw a correlation between the
risk tolerance of teams and their first-round se
lections. I think it would be fascinating to see if
commentators are correct when they say that
certain players are too immature to play pro
fessional ball. There was lots of talk of Maurice
Clarett, but what evidence is there that his col
lege performance and woes will imply future
success?
Look at the cases of Lawrence Phillips and
Randy Moss, two troubled but talented college
players. Seven years into his career. Moss is an
indisputable success and is considered one of
the top receivers in the league. Phillips, on the
other hand, never found his way, and after ar
rests for drug use and domestic violence and
stints in Europe and Canada, he bowed out of
football.
Knowing which players are more likely to

do well in the NFL would take
away some of the crapshoot fun of
the draft. But we would still be left
with the human drama that makes
the draft worth watching. Much
like NBC's coverage of the
Olympics, ESPN intersperses in
sightful commentary and analysis
with human interest stories about
the lives of the young men called to
the podium.
Alex Smith, the first overall pick,
chose Utah over Harvard, complet
ed his economics degree in four
semesters, and now stands to resur
rect the miserable 49ers franchise.
Adam "Pac-Man" Jones, the
sixth overall pick by Tennessee, is
the first man in his family to live
past the age of 21. His father and
uncle were both murdered in their
teens and Pac-Man now takes his
little brother around with him ev
erywhere to protect him from
harm.
Stories like these put faces with
names and help fans connect with

the players, which in turn gives us
some small amount of vicarious
thrill.
The most intriguing part of the
draft was watching the expression
on the face of Cal quarterback
Aaron Rodgers who. for three ago
nizing hours, sat in the convention
center waiting for his name to be
called. Projected as a top-five pick,
Rodgers fell to No. 24 before Green
Bay chose him as the successor to
Brett Favre.
Arguably. Rodgers is in the best
imaginable situation fora young
quailerback— he can sit on the
sidelines fora few years and learn
the system from a master before
being thrown to the wolves — but
I'm sure this did not make the wait
any less painful.
I guess Rodgers now knows, if
only fora brief instant, what it's like
to be the one who fails gym class and
is the last one chosen on the play
ground. Maybe, once the signing
bonus lands in the bank account,
he'll use the slight as motivation and.
like Lisa, prove himself to the
