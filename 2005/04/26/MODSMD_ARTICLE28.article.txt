# No. 3 water polo beats Cal
## 
### WES MATEO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It takes more than a few star players to win a na
tional championship — but for the No. 3 women's
water polo team (18-5, 10-3 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation), depth is not an issue.
After Saturday night's regular season finale,
five members of the Cardinal squad had tallied at
least 25 goals this season. Throughout the year, the
Stanford defense received noteworthy contribu
tions from up and down the lineup.
Wrapping up their regular season competition
over the weekend, the Cardinal once again show
cased their repertoire of quality two-way players.
The Cardinal opened their weekend by defeating
No. 10 San Jose State, 13-5. Friday. Saturday, they
won their fifth consecutive Big Splash matchup
against No. 7 California in a hard-fought 9-8 victo
ry. In both matches, every Stanford starter record
ed at least one goal while a total of nine players fac
tored into the Cardinal's weekend scoring.
Friday night's showdown against the Spartans
marked the final career home game for senior cap
tains Hannah and Kelty Luber. Both were honored
prior to the start of the game. In their four years on
the Farm, Hannah developed into a consistent
scoring threat and an excellent field shot-blocker,
while Kelty established herself as the anchor of the
Cardinal defense.
Fittingly, each netted a goal before saying
farewell to the Avery Aquatic Center — Hannah's
came off a fast break near the end of the first peri
od, and Kelty's came on a power-play a period later
to put the Cardinal up 7-2.
Against the Spartans, red-hot sophomore
Christina Hewko continued her recent scoring
tear, posting a hat-trick for the third consecutive

game. Also producing multi-goal efforts in the
game were sophomore two-meter defender Alison
Gregorka, junior two-meter Nancy El-Sakkary
and sophomore driver Katie Hansen. Junior Scotti
Shafer and freshman Megan May rounded out the
scoring for Stanford with one goal apiece.
The Cardinal routinely capitalized on their
speed advantage, beating the Spartans in transition
and working five of their goals on fast-break coun
terattacks.
Saturday evening, the Stanford women traveled
across the bay to take on a tough Golden Bears
squad in the Big Splash. From the first minutes of
play, it was apparent that the match would be close
ly contested and a difficult test for the Cardinal.
Hansen put Stanford up early, notching her first
goal of the night at 6:25 in the first quarter. But the
Bears made a strong statement with two quick
goals in the third minute of play to go up one.
Hannah Luber tied the score by converting a
break-away opportunity, but a goal from Califor
nia sophomore Annie Wright shortly thereafter
put the Bears back on top.
The see-saw battle continued for the remainder
of the first half of play. The Cardinal received goals
from Hansen and junior driver Laurel Champion
during six-on-five advantages, and the two teams
went into the half tied at 4-4.
In the third period, the Stanford women were
able to create some separation by building a two
goal lead. Gregorka provided the crucial goal of the
game, sending a cross-cage shot off the bar and in
to put the Cardinal ahead 7-5 with 2:15 remaining
in the perit>d.
The Bears made an inspired effort to keep
themselves within striking distance, but they ulti-

Complex in Berkeley. The win marked Stanford's fifth consecutive triumph over the Bears in the Big Splash.
