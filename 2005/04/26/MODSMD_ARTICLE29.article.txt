# Barnes, Yelsey champions in Ojai
## Cardinal keep win streak alive 
### MIA LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Call it a case of deja vu.
Call it a case of the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team (21-
0,12-0 Pacific-10 Conference) doing what it does best: winning.
However you phrase it, the top-ranked Cardinal propelled ju
nior Alice Barnes to her second consecutive doubles victory this
weekend at the Pac-10 Individual Championships in Ojai, Calif.
And not just any doubles victory. Last year, Stanford chalked
it up to surprising good luck when Barnes teamed up with Erin
Burdette for the first time at the tournament's beginning, and
emerged with a Pac-10 title.
But after reclaiming the title with an 8-1 victory over Ari
zona's Dianne Hollands and Maja Mlakar (27-9,8-2), Barnes re
considered the role luck played in her breakout victory with re
cent partner sophomore Anne Yelsey.
"I think we gelled right from the start," Barnes said. "We
were prepared to have a tough start and take a little while to ad
just to each other's playing styles. But because we both play what
you'd call 'conventional doubles,' we already had a good under
standing of each other's movements and ball placement."
While Barnes and Yelsey had forged a promising 4-0 record
going into Sunday's match at Libbey Park, Stanford's numbers
paled in comparison to No. 14 Mlakar and Hollands' month
long, seven-match winning streak.
"1 would say we were nervous, but we were aware of how well
they've been playing this year," Barnes said. "Erin and I beat them
pretty convincingly at Ojai last year, but we struggled with them in
the regular season this year. They've really been in top form."
Sunday marked the Wildcats' first upset since being edged by
UCLA's No. 4 Daniela Bercek and Riza Zalameda on their
home turf, 9-7.
"We got off to a good start, and once we had that we just
served really well like we'd been doing all week," Barnes said. "If
you get a couple of breaks up on someone in an [8-game pro-set],
it puts so much pressure on the other team."
Stanford's Whitney Deason, a freshman, and sophomore
Theresa Logar also entered the doubles tournament. The pair
was leading Washington's Saskia Nauenberg and Mugette Ahn
in the first round, 6-5, when Deason had to retire due to injury.
In singles, the Cardinal came up just short of victory, as No. 22
Barnes let a final decision slip through her fingers against South
ern California's No. 9 Nicole Leimbach, 5-7,6-0,6-3.
Barnes was also runner-up in the 2004 Pac-10 competition,
deferring to California alumna Raquel Kops Jones in straight
sets.
While admitting that second place is nothing to scoff at, the
Cambridge, U.K., native expressed disappointment over drop
ping the singles title.
"With the way I was playing, I thought I could have won that
match," Barnes said. "I sat back a little too much and wasn't ag
gressive enough in the second set. When I realized my mistake,
it was too late. I had game points in three games in the third set
that I didn't convert. If I had converted, I could have been serv
ing for the match instead of serving to stay in it."
Despite the final results, Stanford took a hearty command of
the 32-member singles field, seeing all four of its contestants
through to the quarterfinals and three to semis, discounting Dea
son's withdrawal.
In her quarterfinal match, Logar (26-4) breezed past Ari-

they've been playing this year," Barnes said. "Erin and I beat them
pretty convincingly at Ojai last year, but we struggled with them in
the regular season this year. They've really been in top form."
Sunday marked the Wildcats' first upset since being edged by
UCLA's No. 4 Daniela Bercek and Riza Zalameda on their
home turf, 9-7.
"We got off to a good start, and once we had that we just
served really well like we'd been doing all week," Barnes said. "If
you get a couple of breaks up on someone in an [8-game pro-set],
it puts so much pressure on the other team."
Stanford's Whitney Deason, a freshman, and sophomore
Theresa Logar also entered the doubles tournament. The pair
was leading Washington's Saskia Nauenberg and Mugette Ahn
in the first round, 6-5, when Deason had to retire due to injury.
In singles, the Cardinal came up just short of victory, as No. 22
Barnes let a final decision slip through her fingers against South
ern California's No. 9 Nicole Leimbach, 5-7,6-0,6-3.
Barnes was also runner-up in the 2004 Pac-10 competition,
deferring to California alumna Raquel Kops Jones in straight
sets.
While admitting that second place is nothing to scoff at, the
Cambridge, U.K., native expressed disappointment over drop
ping the singles title.
"With the way I was playing, I thought I could have won that
match," Barnes said. "I sat back a little too much and wasn't ag
gressive enough in the second set. When I realized my mistake,
it was too late. I had game points in three games in the third set
that I didn't convert. If I had converted, I could have been serv
ing for the match instead of serving to stay in it."
Despite the final results, Stanford took a hearty command of
the 32-member singles field, seeing all four of its contestants
through to the quarterfinals and three to semis, discounting Dea
son's withdrawal.

players, it can be a tense time,"
Barnes said. "II you're playing oppo
nents who are placed lower than you
in the regular singles lineup, you
don't want to take losses in those
opening rounds. Just the same, if
you're playing in a lower singles posi

some big wins."

best team in the league."
Call it a case of deja vu.
Call it a case of the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team (21-
0,12-0 Pacific-10 Conference) doing what it does best: winning.
However you phrase it, the top-ranked Cardinal propelled ju
nior Alice Barnes to her second consecutive doubles victory this
weekend at the Pac-10 Individual Championships in Ojai, Calif.
And not just any doubles victory. Last year, Stanford chalked
it up to surprising good luck when Barnes teamed up with Erin
Burdette for the first time at the tournament's beginning, and
emerged with a Pac-10 title.
But after reclaiming the title with an 8-1 victory over Ari
zona's Dianne Hollands and Maja Mlakar (27-9,8-2), Barnes re
considered the role luck played in her breakout victory with re
cent partner sophomore Anne Yelsey.
"I think we gelled right from the start," Barnes said. "We
were prepared to have a tough start and take a little while to ad
just to each other's playing styles. But because we both play what
you'd call 'conventional doubles,' we already had a good under
standing of each other's movements and ball placement."
While Barnes and Yelsey had forged a promising 4-0 record
going into Sunday's match at Libbey Park, Stanford's numbers
paled in comparison to No. 14 Mlakar and Hollands' month
long, seven-match winning streak.
"1 would say we were nervous, but we were aware of how well
they've been playing this year," Barnes said. "Erin and I beat them
pretty convincingly at Ojai last year, but we struggled with them in
the regular season this year. They've really been in top form."
Sunday marked the Wildcats' first upset since being edged by
