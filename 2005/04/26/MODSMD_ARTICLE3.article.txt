# Ivy League TAs call to unionize
## 
### KILLEEN HANSON STAFF WRITER 
Graduate teaching assistants at Columbia and Yale
began a five-day strike last Monday to demand that their
respective institutions recognize them as a union. Similar
strikes took place at the University of Michigan in 1999
and on all University of California campuses in 1998.
Victoria Stodden. a statistics graduate student who has
been working as a teaching assistant, or TA. for the past
several years, said she is not familiar with graduate stu
dent TAs at Stanford trying to unionize. However, such
graduate student unions exist at other universities. At the
University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Stodden
was forced to join a union.
In 2CXX), unions represented graduate students at 27
public colleges and universities.
The graduate students at the two
east coast schools are seeking recog
nition fora Teaching Assistant/Re
search Assistant union and demand
ing, among other things, health care
for family members and a process
through which they can raise issues
to the universities. As graduate stu
dents, they already receive partial
health benefits and a stipend during
their years at Columbia or Yale.
Most graduate students have their
tuitions covered by their universities
and receive a yearly stipend; grad
students typically receive stipends of
$IS,(HX) at Columbia and between
$17,000 and $25,000 at Yale.
The National Labor Relations
Board ruled last year, reversing a
four-year ruling, that graduate stu
dents at private institutions are stu
dents, not workers, and therefore
cannot form unions. A union can
only be formed if the university vol
untarily grants that right, which is
what the current strike intends to
achieve.
At Yale, classes went on as usual
either because "the grad students in
volved is not participating in the
strike or because the faculty have

made other arrangements," said
Yale Spokesperson Tom Conroy in
an interview with CNN.
At Columbia, however, many
classes were canceled or moved off
campus.
The student strikers said they are
seeking recognition as a union be
cause they say the universities are de
pending more from them as workers
and that they should receive the ap
propriate recognition. Administra
tors, on the other hand, cited teach
ing, grading and research as neces
sary components of a graduate edu
cation.
Stanford President John Hen
nessy wrote in Teaching at Stanford:
an Introductory Handbook, "At
Stanford, we place a high value on

collaborative learning — not only
among faculty, academic staff, and
teaching assistants, but also between
faculty and students. Stanford is
committed to being a great research
and teaching university. We believe
it is not only possible but vital that we
give teaching as much emphasis and
support as we give research."
Further, a successful track record
of teaching has become more impor
tant for doctorates searching for their
first academic position. At research
institutions like Stanford, search
committees look for candidates with
both excellent scholarship and teach
ing ability. The appointment papers
for junior faculty at Stanford now in
clude a portion for candidates to list
their teaching experiences.
