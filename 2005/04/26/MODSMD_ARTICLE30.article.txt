# Offense powers lacrosse to a victory over Loyola
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON STAFF WRITER 
Coming off two dramatic, high-scoring
victories — 9-8 over Yale and 17-14 over
Denver — the women's lacrosse team
probably wasn't expecting an even more
thrilling match last Saturday against the
Loyola Greyhounds. But that's exactly
what it got in Baltimore, Md..
Against one of the most storied pro
grams in women's lacrosse, the Cardinal
played their most up-tempo match of the

season en route to a 20-16 win. Junior at
tacker Megan Burker and freshman at
tacker Daphne Patterson led the offense
with five goals apiece, while junior attack
er Sarah Bach and sophomore midfielder
Liz Piselli each added a hat trick.
"It's a huge win," said Bach, whose 30
scores pace the Cardinal. "We got an e
mail from one of our coaches Monday
night, talking about how our team has
never beaten a team with such a long histo
ry as Loyola. It was nice to get a win."
After Loyola (4-9) started the contest

by firing two quick scores past freshman
goalkeeper Laura Shane, Stanford's offen
sive wizardry quickly overwhelmed the
Greyhounds. Before 20 minutes had
elapsed, the Cardinal had already notched
seven tallies in a row to build a comfortable
7-2 lead. A three-goal spurt later in the first
half preceded another three-goal streak to
start the second stanza, and Stanford (10-5,
5-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
widened its lead to 13-6 with just under 25
minutes to play.
Bach attributed the offensive output in

part to careful scheming.
"On offense, our motion looked really
fluid," Bach said. "We had heard they were
a little weaker in the defensive end on
things their offense ran, so in practice our
offense was running their offense for our
defense to practice. We took advantage
and capitalized. People took advantage of
whoever was defending them."
To their credit, the Greyhounds contin
ued to fight on the offensive end, clawing
back into the contest despite the seven-
goal deficit. After the two squads
traded goals, Loyola's Sydney
Greene tallied three consecutive
scores in just over a minute to cut
Stanford's lead to 14-10. Stanford
responded with yet another run of
three scores, but Loyola then un
loaded a four-goal spurt on the Car
dinal to tighten Stanford's lead to
17-14.
Greene and Kate McHarg pow
ered the Greyhound offense with
six goals apiece, a statistic Bach
doesn't mind as long as the offense
continues to fire on all cylinders.
"I think it was the Yale game
when our coach was finally like, 'Al
right, if we're going to win, our of
fense is going to have to beat the
other team,"' Bach said. "Our of
fense has been kicking it into high
gear ever since. In my years here, 1
know we've never scored 20 goals,
period. The defense is doing enough
to win. They're doing their job;
they're getting it done."
Loyola would pull no closer.
After the teams traded tallies again,
Patterson's fourth and fifth marks
of the contest put Stanford in front
20-15 with only 48 seconds to play,
icing the Cardinal victory. Greene's
sixth score with 16 seconds remain
ing produced the final margin.
Stanford returns to action this
Saturday, when the Cardinal visit
Columbus, Ohio, fora date with
Ohio State. After their trip to Ohio,
Stanford will have another week to
prepare for the MPSF playoffs,
which begin May 5 in Moraga, Calif.
