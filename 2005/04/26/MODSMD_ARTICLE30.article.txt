# Offense powers lacrosse to a victory over Loyola
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON STAFF WRITER 
Coming off two dramatic, high-scoring
victories — 9-8 over Yale and 17-14 over
Denver — the women's lacrosse team
probably wasn't expecting an even more
thrilling match last Saturday against the
Loyola Greyhounds. But that's exactly
what it got in Baltimore, Md..
Against one of the most storied pro
grams in women's lacrosse, the Cardinal
played their most up-tempo match of the

season en route to a 20-16 win. Junior at
tacker Megan Burker and freshman at
tacker Daphne Patterson led the offense
with five goals apiece, while junior attack
er Sarah Bach and sophomore midfielder
Liz Piselli each added a hat trick.
"It's a huge win," said Bach, whose 30
scores pace the Cardinal. "We got an e
mail from one of our coaches Monday
night, talking about how our team has
never beaten a team with such a long histo
ry as Loyola. It was nice to get a win."
After Loyola (4-9) started the contest

by firing two quick scores past freshman
goalkeeper Laura Shane, Stanford's offen
sive wizardry quickly overwhelmed the
Greyhounds. Before 20 minutes had
elapsed, the Cardinal had already notched
seven tallies in a row to build a comfortable
7-2 lead. A three-goal spurt later in the first
half preceded another three-goal streak to
start the second stanza, and Stanford (10-5,
5-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
widened its lead to 13-6 with just under 25
minutes to play.
Bach attributed the offensive output in

part to careful scheming.
"On offense, our motion looked really
fluid," Bach said. "We had heard they were
a little weaker in the defensive end on
things their offense ran, so in practice our
offense was running their offense for our
defense to practice. We took advantage
and capitalized. People took advantage of
whoever was defending them."
To their credit, the Greyhounds contin
ued to fight on the offensive end, clawing
back into the contest despite the seven-
