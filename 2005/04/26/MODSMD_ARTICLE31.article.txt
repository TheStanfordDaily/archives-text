# Strong rebound for freshman Yim
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Walking was a considerable challenge for
freshman Tabitha Yim less than nine months ago.
A ruptured Achilles' tendon kept her from com
peting at the Olympic Games and from training

for several months. Saturday night, however, she
tumbled her way to a third-place finish on the
floor exercise at NCAA Nationals. Yim also
claimed respective sixth- and seventh-place finish
es on bars and beam.
"For her to come back from that Achilles' rup
ture last July was truly phenomenal," head coach

Kristen Smyth said. "The crowd was on their feet
for her ... Knowing her struggle, so many people
have a huge amount of respect for her gymnastics
and who she is as a person."
Support from her teammates was the fuel for
her comeback.
"1 wouldn't have been able to motivate myself
to come back if 1 had not known that my team was
counting on me," Yim said. "I missed them so
much this weekend."
The Cardinal did not qualify to compete as a
team at Nationals for the first time in five years
due to an injury-plagued season. Last year they
tied with Alabama for third place. The Crimson
Tide finished second this year on their home turf
behind Georgia. Utah, UCLA, Michigan and Ne
braska rounded out the top five.
"It was hard to be there without the whole
team," Smyth said. "There is nothing more excit
ing than watching your team compete on the last
day of the year. But I was very proud of Tab and
how she represented Stanford."
Yim garnered four first-team Ail-American
honors, a record number fora freshman in Stan
ford's gymnastics program, Smyth said. Yim re
ceived honors in floor, bars, beam and the Ail-
Around by virtue of the fact that she finished
among the top four gymnasts in each of those cat
egories in Thursday's preliminary competition.
Balance beam was Yim's highlight in the pre
liminary competition. She upgraded her dismount
to a round-off double twisting layout and stuck it
cold to earn a 9.925 — the top beam score in one
of the two preliminary sessions of competition.
"Beam went so smoothly, 1 felt like I did the
best that I could that day," Yim said.
Since she finished in the top four on beam in
her session, Yim progressed to the finals on beam
on Saturday night. By random drawing, she was
put into the nerve-racking position of being the
first gymnast to compete on the event.
One slight wobble on her flip-flop layout series
was enough to take Yim out of podium con
tention. She scored a 9.8375 —just one-tenth of a
point but six places behind first place finisher se
nior Kristen Maloney of UCLA. Maloney also
won the vault, providing an impressive end to a ca
reer plagued by a shin injury that required five op
erations.
Yim topped Maloney on floor exercise, how
ever, tying for third place with a 9.925. Yim re
ceived a standing ovation for her performance
on floor in the preliminary competition. She was
the last gymnast to compete in a squad with the
Nebraska team since her own team was not
there. The Nebraska team adopted her and
cheered her on — which Yim said was her fa
vorite part of the meet.
"Nebraska was just as wonderful for her as she
was for them," Smyth said. "She is the kind of ath
lete that is always jumping around cheering for
other teams and other people."
The competition provided Yim with experi
ence that will prove invaluable next year. No team
members will graduate, but three incoming fresh
men have signed letters of intent, including Na
tional team member Kelly Fee and Canadian
Olympic team captain Heather Purnell.
Yim is determined not to be without her team
at Nationals next year. When Smyth told her to
take two weeks off before returning to training for
next season, she responded, "Do 1 have to?"
"I am so excited for next year," Yim said. "I'm
ready to go."
