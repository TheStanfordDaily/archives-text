# 'Twinsgate' rocks San Antonio

### SARA INES CALDERON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A case of mistaken identity or toiled political chi
canery?
Julian Castro, Class of 1996 and the front-runner in the
race for San Antonio mayor, found himself in a hit of a po
litical bind last week when he was accused of using his
identical twin, Joaquin, also Class of 1996, as a stand-in at
a river parade.
"[Joaquin] was standing in the River Parade because I
had to host a neighborhood leaders meeting," said Julian
in an April 22 interview with Reuters. Julian is currently a
city councilman, and his brother is a representative in the
Texas state assembly.
This was the second time the twins have been accused
of using their resemblance for political gain. In his 2002
run for the Texas house, Joaquin was accused of using Ju
lian as his stand-in.
The parade was part of an annual citywide celebration
called Fiesta and featured the city council members riding
a float down the San Antonio Riverwalk.
The brothers had previously ridden together in the

parade, they said, but this year Julian made a last-minute
decision not to attend. Joaquin arrived at the event, and
when his brother did not show, he rode on the float
alone.
The brothers claim that the mix-up occurred because
no one informed the parade announcer it was in fact
Joaquin on the float and not Julian. The incident has
drawn criticism from other mayoral candidates, including
Phil Hardberger and Julian's fellow councilman Carroll
Schubert.
"To pretend someone else is you is a question of credi
bility," Hardgerger said in an interview on a local televi
sion station.
Opponents also called the incident "deceitful" and
"immature."
The event has been dubbed "Twinsgate," and the two
discussed the mishap on The Today Show, Good Morning
America, CNN and National Public Radio, among others.
Julian has enjoyed a double-digit lead in recent polls,
also according to Reuters, and he shrugged off the incident
at a press conference with his brother on Thursday where
Julian and Joaquin held up shirts reading, "I am Julian"
and"I am NOT Julian," respectively.
