# Tuition to be waived for low-income admits

Of the students Stanford admits
each year from Logan High School in
Union City, some end up on the Farm
while others choose less-expensive
University of California schools. But
Sharon Hope, program manager for
the public high school's college and
career center, says that many talented
students from low-income families
don't even consider Stanford because
of its $40,(XX)-a-year price tag.

$45,000 per year will not be expected
to contribute any money toward their
child's undergraduate education at
Stanford. The student may still have
to do work-study and take out loans,
but Stanford will cover everything
else, from tuition to books to tooth

In an interview with the Daily,

University Provost John Etchemendy
said the new policy "will end up hav

low-income families.
"But it has a huge advantage in
being easier to explain," Etchemendy
said. "One of the things we're worried
about is that there's this perception
that there are schools that people
without a lot of income can't afford to
go to. Nothing could be further from
the truth, even right now, without the
change in policy."
Etchemendy said students whose
parents earn under $45,000 currently
comprise about 15 percent of the un
dergraduate population and account
fora total of $2.3 million per year in
parental contributions to the Univer

Besides eliminating the parental
contribution, Stanford also hopes to re
duce the self-help expectation â€” such
