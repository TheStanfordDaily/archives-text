# Tuition to be waived for low-income admits
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Of the students Stanford admits
each year from Logan High School in
Union City, some end up on the Farm
while others choose less-expensive
University of California schools. But
Sharon Hope, program manager for
the public high school's college and
career center, says that many talented
students from low-income families
don't even consider Stanford because
of its $40,(XX)-a-year price tag.
University President John Hen
nessy recently announced a financial
aid policy intended to change that. By
2010, families earning less than
$45,000 per year will not be expected
to contribute any money toward their
child's undergraduate education at
Stanford. The student may still have
to do work-study and take out loans,
but Stanford will cover everything
else, from tuition to books to tooth
paste.
In an interview with the Daily,

University Provost John Etchemendy
said the new policy "will end up hav
ing an effect on a relatively small
number of students," because Stan
ford already covers most costs for
low-income families.
"But it has a huge advantage in
being easier to explain," Etchemendy
said. "One of the things we're worried
about is that there's this perception
that there are schools that people
without a lot of income can't afford to
go to. Nothing could be further from
the truth, even right now, without the
change in policy."
Etchemendy said students whose
parents earn under $45,000 currently
comprise about 15 percent of the un
dergraduate population and account
fora total of $2.3 million per year in
parental contributions to the Univer
sity.
Besides eliminating the parental
contribution, Stanford also hopes to re
duce the self-help expectation — such
as loans and work-study — for those
students to $4,500 a year, which would
cost the University about another $1.7
million. Etchemendy estimated that
both goals could be accomplished with
around $K0 million, Stanford will soon
launch a campaign to raise.
That would be money well-spent,
said Alice Kleeman, college adviser at
Menlo-Atherton High School, which
serves students from East Fait) Alto
and East Menlo Park, two low-in
come neighborhoods, as well as from
the affluent Atherton.

"Right now, there aren't a lot of
students that |the new policy] would
apply to," she said, noting that few if
any of the 14 students Stanford admit
ted from Menlo-Atherton this year
are from families earning less than
$45,000.
"However, I think as it becomes
more widely known, it gives students
more hope earlier that there might he
a way for them to go to a school like
Stanford." That hope, she said, could
be a powerful motivator.
That's why Etchemendy said that
one of the most important aspects of
the plan is getting the word out.
Kleeman said she already knew of
the proposal through a variety of
sources, including Stanford's own out
reach efforts. Across the bay at

Logan, Hope hadn't yet heard about
it, hut she knew of similar proposals
by Harvard and Yale, both of which
garnered national headlines by elimi
nating parental contributions for low
income families.
Etchemendy said, "When Harvard
made that announcement, we looked
at our financial aid program and we
were convinced that, really, ours is as
generous and in many cases more gen
erous than their new program. Initial
ly we thought, why should we change
a program that is already allowing
these students to afford to come to
Stanford?
"Then we got to thinking about
this image problem, if you will," he
added. "The point is that the general
perception among certain groups of

high school students is that they can't
afford 1 it.and we realized that this is a
good way to counteract that percep
tion."
As much as she applauds Stan
ford's plan. Kleeman said she worries
that the University also misses out on
some of the top middle-class students
because of its expense.
"1 had a student a number of years
ago who chose to go to UC Davis be
cause his family was a middle-income
family and couldn't meet the gap be
tween what Stanford could offer [in fi
nancial aid] and what they expected
for his family contribution." she said.
Hope said that's a common occur
rence among Logan students.
"If you have a student who's ad
mitted to Stanford and they're also

admitted to UC-Berkeley, and cost is
an issue, they're going to go with the
one they can afford," she said. And
though Stanford does offer financial
aid to middle-class families, "the plan
involves loans — that's the scary tiling
for kids, and parents too."
Etchemendy cited statistics show
ing that Stanford's financial aid pack
ages make the ratio of family income
to expected parental contribution rel
atively equal across all income brack
ets. ITiat is, on average, low-income,
middle-income and high-income fam
ilies all end up paying somewhere be
tween 12 percent and 20 percent of
their annual incomes to send a child to
Stanford, though that percentage will
drop for the lowest bracket when the
new policy takes effect.

Of the students Stanford admits
each year from Logan High School in
Union City, some end up on the Farm
while others choose less-expensive
University of California schools. But
Sharon Hope, program manager for
the public high school's college and
career center, says that many talented
students from low-income families
don't even consider Stanford because
of its $40,(XX)-a-year price tag.
University President John Hen
nessy recently announced a financial
aid policy intended to change that. By
2010, families earning less than
$45,000 per year will not be expected
to contribute any money toward their
child's undergraduate education at
Stanford. The student may still have
to do work-study and take out loans,
but Stanford will cover everything
else, from tuition to books to tooth
paste.
In an interview with the Daily,

University Provost John Etchemendy
said the new policy "will end up hav
ing an effect on a relatively small
number of students," because Stan
ford already covers most costs for
low-income families.
"But it has a huge advantage in
being easier to explain," Etchemendy
said. "One of the things we're worried
about is that there's this perception
that there are schools that people
without a lot of income can't afford to
go to. Nothing could be further from
the truth, even right now, without the
change in policy."
Etchemendy said students whose
parents earn under $45,000 currently
comprise about 15 percent of the un
dergraduate population and account
fora total of $2.3 million per year in
parental contributions to the Univer
sity.
Besides eliminating the parental
contribution, Stanford also hopes to re
duce the self-help expectation — such
as loans and work-study — for those
students to $4,500 a year, which would
cost the University about another $1.7
million. Etchemendy estimated that
both goals could be accomplished with
around $K0 million, Stanford will soon
launch a campaign to raise.
That would be money well-spent,
said Alice Kleeman, college adviser at
Menlo-Atherton High School, which
serves students from East Fait) Alto
and East Menlo Park, two low-in
come neighborhoods, as well as from
the affluent Atherton.

"Right now, there aren't a lot of
students that |the new policy] would
apply to," she said, noting that few if
any of the 14 students Stanford admit
ted from Menlo-Atherton this year
are from families earning less than
$45,000.
"However, I think as it becomes
more widely known, it gives students
more hope earlier that there might he
a way for them to go to a school like
Stanford." That hope, she said, could
be a powerful motivator.
That's why Etchemendy said that
one of the most important aspects of
the plan is getting the word out.
Kleeman said she already knew of
the proposal through a variety of
sources, including Stanford's own out
reach efforts. Across the bay at

Logan, Hope hadn't yet heard about
it, hut she knew of similar proposals
by Harvard and Yale, both of which
garnered national headlines by elimi
nating parental contributions for low
income families.
Etchemendy said, "When Harvard
made that announcement, we looked
at our financial aid program and we
were convinced that, really, ours is as
generous and in many cases more gen
erous than their new program. Initial
ly we thought, why should we change
a program that is already allowing
these students to afford to come to
Stanford?
"Then we got to thinking about
this image problem, if you will," he
added. "The point is that the general
perception among certain groups of

high school students is that they can't
afford 1 it.and we realized that this is a
good way to counteract that percep
tion."
As much as she applauds Stan
ford's plan. Kleeman said she worries
that the University also misses out on
some of the top middle-class students
because of its expense.
"1 had a student a number of years
ago who chose to go to UC Davis be
cause his family was a middle-income
family and couldn't meet the gap be
tween what Stanford could offer [in fi
nancial aid] and what they expected
for his family contribution." she said.
Hope said that's a common occur
rence among Logan students.
"If you have a student who's ad
mitted to Stanford and they're also

admitted to UC-Berkeley, and cost is
an issue, they're going to go with the
one they can afford," she said. And
though Stanford does offer financial
aid to middle-class families, "the plan
involves loans — that's the scary tiling
for kids, and parents too."
Etchemendy cited statistics show
ing that Stanford's financial aid pack
ages make the ratio of family income
to expected parental contribution rel
atively equal across all income brack
ets. ITiat is, on average, low-income,
middle-income and high-income fam
ilies all end up paying somewhere be
tween 12 percent and 20 percent of
their annual incomes to send a child to
Stanford, though that percentage will
drop for the lowest bracket when the
new policy takes effect.
