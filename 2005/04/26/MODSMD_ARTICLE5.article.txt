Hoover Institution fellows Peter
Berkowitz and Michael McFaul pub
lished an Op-Ed in The Washington
Post on April 12 raising concerns about
the lack of faculty and courses special
izing in Islamic studies at American

universities.
They cited two major reasons for the
need to strengthen this academic field
â€” Islam is the second largest religion
in the world, and experts in the field are
an asset to national security.
"Our declared enemy A1 Qaeda and
other Muslim extremists find in Islam
justifications for their murderous ha

tred of us," Berkowitz said in an inter
view with The Daily. "We need to un
derstand the religious grounds of the
war they are waging against us much
better. Also, we need to understand
Islam better to pursue peace."
Islamic studies programs encompass
a number of topics including the Koran,
the history and culture of people who

profess Islam and the regions where
they live. Berkowitz also emphasized
the importance of studying languages,
especially Arabic.
"In general, we think that language
is the key to understanding people and
their way of life," Berkowitz said.
