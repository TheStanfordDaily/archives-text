# Hoover fellows call for Islam expertise

### ANNY LIN STAFF WRITER 
Hoover Institution fellows Peter
Berkowitz and Michael McFaul pub
lished an Op-Ed in The Washington
Post on April 12 raising concerns about
the lack of faculty and courses special
izing in Islamic studies at American

universities.
They cited two major reasons for the
need to strengthen this academic field
— Islam is the second largest religion
in the world, and experts in the field are
an asset to national security.
"Our declared enemy A1 Qaeda and
other Muslim extremists find in Islam
justifications for their murderous ha

tred of us," Berkowitz said in an inter
view with The Daily. "We need to un
derstand the religious grounds of the
war they are waging against us much
better. Also, we need to understand
Islam better to pursue peace."
Islamic studies programs encompass
a number of topics including the Koran,
the history and culture of people who

profess Islam and the regions where
they live. Berkowitz also emphasized
the importance of studying languages,
especially Arabic.
"In general, we think that language
is the key to understanding people and
their way of life," Berkowitz said.
When it comes to funding such
studies, Berkowitz pointed to gov
ernment resources, private foun
dations and the universities them
selves.
"In many cases, elite universi
ties have large endowments,"
Berkowitz said. "If there is a will,
universities can invest more re
sources in this area."
Stanford, for instance, received
a $9 million endowment in the fall
of 2003 to fund a program and pro
fessorship in Islamic studies. The
University was able to create the
Sohaih and Sara Abbasi Program
in Islamic Studies within the Reli
gious Studies Department.
According to Robert Gregg,
professor of religious studies and
acting director of a committee on
Islamic studies at Stanford, the
funds have so far been used for
supporting courses, sponsoring
lecture and seminar series and con
ducting faculty searches and re
cruitment.
"The primary element in
strengthening Islamic studies in
volves the hiring of experts in the
field — scholars of national and in
ternational prominence who will
join others at Stanford who teach
in this area," Gregg said. "We have
not had an Islamicist in the Reli
gious Studies Department, and

early planning led to a decision to
attempt to recruit a faculty mem
ber in that academic discipline."
Meanwhile, sophomore Omar
Shakir, co-president for the Coali
tion for Justice in the Middle East
and treasurer of the Muslim Stu
dents Awareness Network, voiced
concern over the inability of the
current Islamic studies curriculum

to meet student demands.
"There is no 'Introduction to
Islam' offered by the University,"
Shakir said. "The demand for
classes is unbelievable," adding
that the first meeting of islam in
the West' attracted several times
more than the enrollment limit.
Timur Kuran, a visiting professor
of economics, agreed that there is

considerable student interest in a
comprehensive, interdisciplinary
approach to Islamic studies. Dur
ing his time at Stanford, he has
taught the course "Economic His
tory and Modernization of the Is
lamic Middle East," which drew
130 students.
"Since the beginning of the year
both undergraduate and graduate
students from several of the social
sciences have been coming to see
me for advice on projects related to
the Middle East," Kuran said.
One change that may address
the problem comes from the Intro
duction to the Humanities, or I
HUM, program, which will be of
fering a winter-spring course se
quence called "Worlds of Islam:
Global History and Muslim Soci
eties," said Ellen Woods, associate
director of the I-HUM Program.
The course description promises
"a chronological and geographical
overview of a broad range of times
and places in which Islam has been
the dominant cultural framework."
It will also cover the basic elements
of the Muslim faith and the related
political, social and cultural prac
tices.
Woods anticipates that this
course will draw more than 100 stu
dents and noted that the I-HUM
winter-spring course sequence
"Approaching Religion" also con
siders Islam alongside the study of
Judaism and Buddhism.
"By including two different dis
ciplinary approaches to Islamic
Studies among the eleven 1-HUM

winter-spring course sequences,
we acknowledge the wide range of
student interests in Islam, from the
political to the personal, and hope
to encourage dialogue among stu
dents and faculty exploring these
different points of view," Woods
said.
Berkowitz agreed that this is a
step in the right direction, adding
that the new I-HUM course will
expose students across the acade
mic spectrum to information they
otherwise would not have learned.
"The main improvement 1 rec
ommend is incorporating the
study of Islam and the wider Mid
dle East into conventional disci
plines and departments — histo
ry, literature, political science,
economics and so on," Berkowitz
said. "This will provide a check
against politicization and intellec
tual ghettoization at the universi
ty, and will promote truly inter
disciplinary conversation."
Kuran also supported the com
prehensive approach to the study
of Islam, especially at Stanford.
"Among other major universi
ties. Princeton. Harvard, Berkeley
and Chicago have long had Middle
East Studies departments," Kuran
said. "Their course offerings hap
pen to be concentrated, however,
in the humanities. Under the cir
cumstances, Stanford has an op
portunity to become a major play
er in the field by offering some
thing unique, namely, a program
that is grounded in both the hu
manities and the social sciences."

of economics, agreed that there is

considerable student interest in a
comprehensive, interdisciplinary
approach to Islamic studies. Dur
ing his time at Stanford, he has
taught the course "Economic His
tory and Modernization of the Is
lamic Middle East," which drew
130 students.
"Since the beginning of the year
both undergraduate and graduate
students from several of the social
sciences have been coming to see
me for advice on projects related to
the Middle East," Kuran said.
One change that may address
the problem comes from the Intro
duction to the Humanities, or I
HUM, program, which will be of
fering a winter-spring course se
quence called "Worlds of Islam:
Global History and Muslim Soci
eties," said Ellen Woods, associate
director of the I-HUM Program.
The course description promises
"a chronological and geographical
overview of a broad range of times
and places in which Islam has been
the dominant cultural framework."
It will also cover the basic elements
of the Muslim faith and the related
political, social and cultural prac
tices.
Woods anticipates that this
course will draw more than 100 stu
dents and noted that the I-HUM
winter-spring course sequence
"Approaching Religion" also con
siders Islam alongside the study of
Judaism and Buddhism.
"By including two different dis
ciplinary approaches to Islamic
Studies among the eleven 1-HUM

winter-spring course sequences,
we acknowledge the wide range of
student interests in Islam, from the
political to the personal, and hope
to encourage dialogue among stu
dents and faculty exploring these
different points of view," Woods
said.
Berkowitz agreed that this is a
step in the right direction, adding
that the new I-HUM course will
expose students across the acade
mic spectrum to information they
otherwise would not have learned.
"The main improvement 1 rec
ommend is incorporating the
study of Islam and the wider Mid
dle East into conventional disci
plines and departments — histo
ry, literature, political science,
economics and so on," Berkowitz
said. "This will provide a check
against politicization and intellec
tual ghettoization at the universi
ty, and will promote truly inter
disciplinary conversation."
Kuran also supported the com
prehensive approach to the study
of Islam, especially at Stanford.
"Among other major universi
ties. Princeton. Harvard, Berkeley
and Chicago have long had Middle
East Studies departments," Kuran
said. "Their course offerings hap
pen to be concentrated, however,
in the humanities. Under the cir
cumstances, Stanford has an op
portunity to become a major play
er in the field by offering some
thing unique, namely, a program
that is grounded in both the hu
manities and the social sciences."

Hoover Institution fellows Peter
Berkowitz and Michael McFaul pub
lished an Op-Ed in The Washington
Post on April 12 raising concerns about
the lack of faculty and courses special
izing in Islamic studies at American

universities.
They cited two major reasons for the
need to strengthen this academic field
— Islam is the second largest religion
in the world, and experts in the field are
an asset to national security.
"Our declared enemy A1 Qaeda and
other Muslim extremists find in Islam
justifications for their murderous ha

tred of us," Berkowitz said in an inter
view with The Daily. "We need to un
derstand the religious grounds of the
war they are waging against us much
better. Also, we need to understand
Islam better to pursue peace."
Islamic studies programs encompass
a number of topics including the Koran,
the history and culture of people who

profess Islam and the regions where
they live. Berkowitz also emphasized
the importance of studying languages,
especially Arabic.
"In general, we think that language
is the key to understanding people and
their way of life," Berkowitz said.
When it comes to funding such
studies, Berkowitz pointed to gov
ernment resources, private foun
dations and the universities them
selves.
"In many cases, elite universi
ties have large endowments,"
Berkowitz said. "If there is a will,
universities can invest more re
sources in this area."
Stanford, for instance, received
a $9 million endowment in the fall
of 2003 to fund a program and pro
fessorship in Islamic studies. The
University was able to create the
Sohaih and Sara Abbasi Program
in Islamic Studies within the Reli
gious Studies Department.
According to Robert Gregg,
professor of religious studies and
acting director of a committee on
Islamic studies at Stanford, the
funds have so far been used for
supporting courses, sponsoring
lecture and seminar series and con
ducting faculty searches and re
cruitment.
"The primary element in
strengthening Islamic studies in
volves the hiring of experts in the
field — scholars of national and in
ternational prominence who will
join others at Stanford who teach
in this area," Gregg said. "We have
not had an Islamicist in the Reli
gious Studies Department, and

early planning led to a decision to
attempt to recruit a faculty mem
ber in that academic discipline."
Meanwhile, sophomore Omar
Shakir, co-president for the Coali
tion for Justice in the Middle East
and treasurer of the Muslim Stu
dents Awareness Network, voiced
concern over the inability of the
current Islamic studies curriculum

to meet student demands.
"There is no 'Introduction to
Islam' offered by the University,"
Shakir said. "The demand for
classes is unbelievable," adding
that the first meeting of islam in
the West' attracted several times
more than the enrollment limit.
