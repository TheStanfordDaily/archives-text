# Caltrain fares hiked, express trains added
## 
### CHANTEL RUSH 
The Caltrain Board of Directors
voted unanimously on Friday to accept
a 50-cent fare increase and a new ser
vice plan that will reduce Caltrain ser
vice to the California Avenue station
and increase the number of Baby Bul
let express trains to the Palo Alto sta
tion.
There will be a three-phase imple
mentation of the adopted changes. On
July 1, the first 25-cent fare increase
will go into affect, followed by service
changes on August 1 and a second 25-
cent fare increase at the beginning of
next year.
On weekdays, there will be 12 more
express Baby Bullet trains stopping at
the Palo Alto station near University
Avenue, which is frequented by Stan
ford students and affiliates.
Introduced last June, Baby Bullets
are now a hit with Caltrain riders, in
cluding many students — especially
from the graduate schools — who de
pend on the Caltrain to commute.
Law school student Salena
Copeland said that the increase in
Baby Bullet trains will make her com
mute to her job in San Francisco easier
this summer.
"For most of Bay Area commuters,
the Baby Bullet is the best option," she
said.
Nonetheless, Copeland said she
was troubled by the 50-cent fare in
crease, remarking that it was"a bit too
much."
Caltrain officials stressed that dis
counted passes will still be available to
groups and frequent riders, and gradu

ate students and faculty with free pass
es from Stanford will also not be affect
ed by the price hike.
During a public hearing before the
vote, Gayle Likens, Palo Alto's trans
portation manager, voiced concern
over the proposal's effect on the city's
business community. The original
proposal called for an almost 50 per
cent decrease in train service to the
California Avenue station, which
would narrow the transportation al
ternatives for business commuters,
including the 23,000 employees at the
Stanford Research Park.
Caltrain spokesperson J ayme Kunz
said these concerns were assuaged by
the proposal's final modifications,
which call for "only a slight reduction
in service to California Avenue, not 50
percent."
Kunz said that the ultimate goal of
the service changes is "not to cut ser
vice but increase revenue by increasing
ridership."
She emphasized that all of the
changes are part of Caltrain's effort to
continue successful operation and im
prove the economic functioning of the
train system.
The new service plan and in
creased fares were proposed during
Caltrain's annual fiscal budget re
view. Starting in January, financial
analysts and other senior planners
began brainstorming ways to respond
to Caltrain's financial crisis — name
ly, its $13.6 million deficit.
A formal proposal was first present
ed on March 14 and will go into affect
in July, the beginning of Caltrain's next
fiscal year.
