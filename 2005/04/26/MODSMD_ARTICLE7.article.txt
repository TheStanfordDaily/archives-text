# Magazine names rocker, activist as student leaders
## 
### JENNIFER LIU STAFF WRITER 
If you picked up a copy of Current
magazine last week, you might have no
ticed that one of the faces on the cover
looked a little familiar. If you did. you're
either a fan of MC Lars, or you've seen his
alter-ego, senior Andrew Nielsen, around
campus.
Current Magazine, a student-run pub

lication produced in cooperation with
Newsweek, featured Stanford's Nielsen,
senior Johnny Madrid and 13 other stu
dents from around the country in an arti
cle entitled "The College Vanguard: 15
Students You Don't Know ... But Will."
While the editorial, business and de
sign staff is primarily composed of Har
vard University students, the content of
the magazine is written by college stu
dents from campuses across the country.

In an interview with The Daily, Harvard
sophomore Anjali Salooja, the president
of Current, said the magazine conducted a
nationwide search to find the 15 who
made the cut.
"The Current staff searched for stu
dents who have devoted themselves to de
veloping something unique within their
particular fields of interest — something
that really has an effect on the world out
side of themselves or their college cam

pus," she said. "In many cases, these stu
dents already have made an impact on the
national stage, and we felt that this was a
good indication that they would continue
to do so in the months and years ahead."
Musician Nielsen, who uses the name
MC Lars for gigs, was recognized by the
magazine for "[combining] his satire with
modern technology to create addictive
tunes with incessant hooks, sure to in
vade campus dance parties across the
country," Salooja said.
Featured in national media out
lets, including MTV and Rolling
Stone, Nielsen is currently taking the
quarter off to tour. He said that
though he was glad to be graduating
this summer, his activities at Stanford
have contributed to his musical inter
ests.
"Being involved with KZSU has
allowed me to set up shows at the
CoHo and granted me access to 20
years of hip-hop vinyl for inspiration
and education in that world," he said.
"Studying abroad in Oxford sopho
more year let me connect with a
British label that put out my 2003
album, which eventually led to get
ting on this tour with Bowling for
Soup."
Nielsen said he plans to continue
his career with the release of an LP or
a complete album in 2006. but also
hopes to earn his doctorate in litera
ture within the next few years.
Social activist Madrid was fea
tured in the magazine for his eight
years of work in foster care advocacy
after having lived in 19 foster homes
during his teenage years. At Stan

ford, he teaches a seminar on public
speaking and manages the Stanford
Foster Care College Project.
Outside of Stanford, he helped
create the Foster Child Bill of Rights,
which became law in 2001. Last year,
Madrid received the Harry S. Tru
man Scholarship, an award honoring
students for their work in public ser
vice. But in the future, he said he
plans on going into the private sector
and will start a new job at Goldman
Sachs following graduation.
"While I want to dedicate my life
to making the lives of other people
better, despite what is commonly
said. I feel that it is possible to make a
difference from the private sector
angle by sitting on boards and lever
aging business contacts for the right
causes," Madrid said. "Also, because
of my long history with foster care, I
wanted to separate my professional
self from my service self, at least for
now. Should I come back to the pub
lic sector, I think I'd be a stronger
candidate in many respects for having
worked in the private sector."
So far, Madrid has been invited to
sit on the board of Foster Care Alum
ni of America, a nonprofit organiza
tion.
Madrid said he was both shocked
and honored to discover he'd been
selected for the magazine's cover
story.
"They sent a photographer up all
the way from Los Angeles to take my

picture," he said. "The picture they
used was funny—l've heard com
ments ranging from 'artistically
grounded' to 'looks like you just ate a
bad burrito.'"
Salooja said the magazine picked
Nielsen for the cover because he
"came across as an incredibly dynam
ic personality."
"We were confident that he would
convey that dynamism through the
visual medium as well." she said. "We
wanted someone who would excite
people to pick up the magazine and
find out what exactly he had done to
be named one of America's next stu
dent leaders."
Nielsen was flown to New York
for the photo shoot.
"The photo shoot was at the
Newsweek offices in New York," he
said. "The two girls on the cover with
me were a poet (Chinaka Hodge) and
an activist (Erica Dhawan) and they
were nice. The Newsweek people
gave us sandwiches."
Madrid said that he didn't realize
the magazine would be so widely cir
culated.
"I've been getting a lot of e-mails
from friends and strangers from dif
ferent schools almost daily who said
they saw my picture," he said. "One
grad student called me because she
wanted to become a foster parent.
Overall, it's been a rewarding experi
ence, affirming some of the advocacy
work I've done around foster care."

the magazine would be so widely cir
culated.
"I've been getting a lot of e-mails
from friends and strangers from dif
ferent schools almost daily who said
they saw my picture," he said. "One
grad student called me because she
wanted to become a foster parent.
Overall, it's been a rewarding experi
ence, affirming some of the advocacy
work I've done around foster care."
If you picked up a copy of Current
magazine last week, you might have no
ticed that one of the faces on the cover
looked a little familiar. If you did. you're
either a fan of MC Lars, or you've seen his
alter-ego, senior Andrew Nielsen, around
campus.
Current Magazine, a student-run pub

lication produced in cooperation with
Newsweek, featured Stanford's Nielsen,
senior Johnny Madrid and 13 other stu
dents from around the country in an arti
cle entitled "The College Vanguard: 15
Students You Don't Know ... But Will."
While the editorial, business and de
sign staff is primarily composed of Har
vard University students, the content of
the magazine is written by college stu
dents from campuses across the country.

In an interview with The Daily, Harvard
sophomore Anjali Salooja, the president
of Current, said the magazine conducted a
nationwide search to find the 15 who
made the cut.
"The Current staff searched for stu
dents who have devoted themselves to de
veloping something unique within their
particular fields of interest — something
that really has an effect on the world out
side of themselves or their college cam

pus," she said. "In many cases, these stu
dents already have made an impact on the
national stage, and we felt that this was a
good indication that they would continue
to do so in the months and years ahead."
Musician Nielsen, who uses the name
MC Lars for gigs, was recognized by the
magazine for "[combining] his satire with
modern technology to create addictive
tunes with incessant hooks, sure to in
vade campus dance parties across the
country," Salooja said.
Featured in national media out
lets, including MTV and Rolling
Stone, Nielsen is currently taking the
quarter off to tour. He said that
though he was glad to be graduating
this summer, his activities at Stanford
have contributed to his musical inter
ests.
"Being involved with KZSU has
allowed me to set up shows at the
CoHo and granted me access to 20
years of hip-hop vinyl for inspiration
and education in that world," he said.
"Studying abroad in Oxford sopho
more year let me connect with a
British label that put out my 2003
album, which eventually led to get
ting on this tour with Bowling for
Soup."
Nielsen said he plans to continue
his career with the release of an LP or
a complete album in 2006. but also
hopes to earn his doctorate in litera
ture within the next few years.
Social activist Madrid was fea
tured in the magazine for his eight
years of work in foster care advocacy
after having lived in 19 foster homes
during his teenage years. At Stan

ford, he teaches a seminar on public
speaking and manages the Stanford
Foster Care College Project.
Outside of Stanford, he helped
create the Foster Child Bill of Rights,
which became law in 2001. Last year,
Madrid received the Harry S. Tru
man Scholarship, an award honoring
students for their work in public ser
vice. But in the future, he said he
plans on going into the private sector
and will start a new job at Goldman
Sachs following graduation.
"While I want to dedicate my life
to making the lives of other people
better, despite what is commonly
said. I feel that it is possible to make a
difference from the private sector
angle by sitting on boards and lever
aging business contacts for the right
causes," Madrid said. "Also, because
of my long history with foster care, I
wanted to separate my professional
self from my service self, at least for
now. Should I come back to the pub
lic sector, I think I'd be a stronger
candidate in many respects for having
worked in the private sector."
So far, Madrid has been invited to
sit on the board of Foster Care Alum
ni of America, a nonprofit organiza
tion.
Madrid said he was both shocked
and honored to discover he'd been
selected for the magazine's cover
story.
"They sent a photographer up all
the way from Los Angeles to take my

picture," he said. "The picture they
used was funny—l've heard com
ments ranging from 'artistically
grounded' to 'looks like you just ate a
bad burrito.'"
Salooja said the magazine picked
Nielsen for the cover because he
"came across as an incredibly dynam
ic personality."
"We were confident that he would
convey that dynamism through the
visual medium as well." she said. "We
wanted someone who would excite
people to pick up the magazine and
find out what exactly he had done to
be named one of America's next stu
dent leaders."
Nielsen was flown to New York
for the photo shoot.
"The photo shoot was at the
Newsweek offices in New York," he
said. "The two girls on the cover with
me were a poet (Chinaka Hodge) and
an activist (Erica Dhawan) and they
were nice. The Newsweek people
gave us sandwiches."
Madrid said that he didn't realize
the magazine would be so widely cir
culated.
"I've been getting a lot of e-mails
from friends and strangers from dif
ferent schools almost daily who said
they saw my picture," he said. "One
grad student called me because she
wanted to become a foster parent.
Overall, it's been a rewarding experi
ence, affirming some of the advocacy
work I've done around foster care."
