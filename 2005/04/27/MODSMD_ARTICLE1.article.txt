# STAND urges Univ. divestment
## 
### ANDREW LEIFER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students from the campus group Students Tak
ing Action Now: Darfur. or STAND, presented a
report on divestment yesterday before the Stanford
Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility, or
APIR, in their continued effort to have the Univer
sity divest from corporations that support the cur
rent Sudanese government.
As part of its larger campaign to raise awareness
and bring an end to genocide in Darfur. members of
STAND are urging Stanford to divest from four
companies that do business in Sudan: the oil com
panies PetroChina, ABB Ltd. and Sinopec; and the
weapons supplier Tatneft.
Junior Ben Elberger and freshman Seth Silverman,
both members of STAND, identified these corpora
tions and presented their findings to APIR yesterday.
"We know Stanford has about $1 million in a
company called PetroChina," Elberger said. "We
don't know exactly the holdings of the rest. But ac
cording to APIR Chair George Parker, Stanford
has holdings in every company."
Parker, a professor of finance at the Graduate
School of Business, would neither deny nor confirm
Stanford's investment in the four companies.
In the 2003-2004 fiscal year, income from Stanford's
endowments funded 16 percent of the
University's costs. However, how the
endowment is invested is unknown
since specific endowment information
is not disclosed to the public.
STAND formally presented a 29-
page report and a Request for Re
view to APIR. The report aims to di
rectly link the four companies to the
genocide occurring in the Darlur re
gion of Sudan. The ethnic violence
has been deemed a genocide by the
U.S. House of Representatives, the
U.S. Senate and the State Depart
ment. Accordingly, American com
panies have been banned by the gov
ernment from doing business with
Sudan since 2002.
"U.S. companies are not allowed
to operate in Sudan because it's a
regime that supports terrorism, and
it's a regime that has been an actor in
human rights violations that have
been egregious under its several
decade reign," Silverman said.
STAND leaders said the group is
targeting these companies as a direct
way to stop the violence in Sudan. Its
report singled out three oil-produc
ing companies that directly provide
revenue to the Sudanese govern
ment, SO percent of which goes to
wards weapons, the group claims.
The fourth company, Tatneft, is a
Russian-based oil corporation
which, according to STAND, trades
weapons such as MiG fighter jets
and T-90 tanks for Sudanese oil.
STAND members allege that all
four companies contribute to the
genocide and thus constitute a "sub
stantial social injury," as defined by
a 2002 APIR document.
In addition to the report,
STAND also presented APIR with a
petition signed by more than 1,100
student and faculty members calling

for the University to divest from the
four corporations. In an Op-Ed in
The Daily today, faculty and staff
demand the same.
"They gave a very carefully done
and passionate presentation on Dar
fur," Parker said. "I think it was re
ceived quite attentively."
If they choose to, the advisory
panel will make a recommendation
to the Standing Committee on In
vestment Relations, which will pre
sent their findings to the Stanford
Board of Trustees, which could call a
vote on the issue.
"Stanford has adopted this state
ment of'substantial social injury' be
cause it doesn't want to be an institu
tion, and it shouldn't be an institu
tion that is complicit in genocide, and
it owes it to its community members
and the people of Darlur to remove
its investments from that region,"
Silverman said. "We believe that
Stanford has an obligation to divest."
STAND leaders said they are opti
mistic about their efforts thus far and
have received ample student support.
"Students are and should be ap
palled to learn that Stanford has in
vested in companies that are sup
porting genocide," Silverman said.
STAND'S campaign is just one
element of a larger concern on cam
pus about Stanford's investment re
sponsibility in general. Apart from
STAND, the Stanford Coalition for
Investment Disclosure, or SCID,
which also presented recommenda
tions at yesterday's meeting, has
been working for more than year to
bring greater transparency to Stan
ford's investments.
SCID's report detailing these rec
ommendations was released last week
and calls for reforms to the investment
selection and disclosure process.
The meeting was held behind
closed doors. Members attending re
ceived boxed lunches.
When asked why the meeting was
closed to the public, Parker replied,
"We just didn't have enough food."
