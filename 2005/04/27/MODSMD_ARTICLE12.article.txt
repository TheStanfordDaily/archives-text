# Five students win scholarships
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At least five Stanford juniors are certain they are going
to graduate school: Susanna Rinard, recipient of the Bei
necke Scholarship, and Philip "Flip" Tanedo, Phillip
Dumesic, Arvind Ravi and Devarati Mitra, recipients of
the Goldwater Scholarship.
Philosophy major Rinard, one of 355 juniors from %
schools to receive the Beinecke award, contributed to the
philosophy of biology and epistemology by challenging a
popular theory of group selection. The prize grants schol
ars in the sciences and humanities $2,<XX) before entering
graduate school on top of $30,(XX) during actual graduate
study.
Rinard said she intends to attend graduate school in phi
losophy atone of the nation's top doctoral programs before
beginning a career in academia. Her areas of interest in
clude core analytic philosophy, including metaphysics and
epistemology, as well as general philosophy of science.
"I have been passionate about philosophy since fresh
man year, when I took an introsem with Peter Godfrey-
Smith," Rinard said. "I can't imagine a better life than one
devoted to philosophy, and the Beinecke Scholarship will
help get me there."
Rinard attributed the development of her philosophical
skills to many of her professors.
"They have spent many hours discussing philosophy
with me in person, online and over the phone," Rinard
said. "I am also indebted to the Undergraduate Research
Programs staff for their help in writing the application."
The Goldwater Scholarship was given out to 320 sopho
mores and juniors interested in mathematics, natural sci
ences and engineering and provides up to $7.5(X) per year
for one to two years.
Tanedo, one of the four Goldwater winners and a dou
ble-major in physics and mathematics, is currently doing
research in particle physics with Prof. Savas Dimopoulosof
the Physics Department.
"I feel that the award is a testament to the guidance of
my faculty mentors and their ability to foster their passion
for science in the students who work with them," he said.
Tanedo said he plans to use his scholarship funds to pur
sue his dream of becoming a theoretical physicist and to
support his love of road cycling.
"One of the secrets of being a good scientist is having a
healthy life outside of science," he said. "There's this say
ing that learning science is like drinking out of a lire hose
â€” your best bet is to take in as much as vou can and net

completely soaked in a subject. I agree with this, but with
the caveat that the best way to do this is by keeping your
body and mind in a state where it is most receptive to learn
ing."
Biological sciences major Dumesic has worked at the
School of Medicine and the Mayo Clinic. I le is studying the
physiology of human skin and, more specifically, two types
of genes in the epidermis.
"My Goldwater application represented not just a sin
gle lucky experiment or an isolated finding, but all of the re
search work I have done - from that of six years ago to that
of six weeks ago," Dumesic said. "For that reason, winning
the award was extremely satisfying."
He added that he plans to enroll in a medical scientist
training program to obtain a joint medical-doctoral degree
in genetics and to give his scholarship winnings to his par
ents as a thank you for their support throughout his educa
tion.
Ravi, a chemistry and mathematics major, has worked
at the Washington University in St. Louis researching lym
phocyte motility in the National Institutes of Health in
ternship program. At Stanford, lie joined a lab at the
School of Engineering, evaluating the possibility of gener
ated new medicines by manipulating bacterial assembly
lines.
"I was naturally excited to hear the good news and
made sure to call my parents and my sister, who is my
biggest fan," Ravi said, adding that he hopes to pursue a
joint medical-doctoral degree in chemistry and ultimately
help discover new diagnostic and treatment procedures.
Mitra, a biological sciences major, has participated in
summer research at both the National Cancer Institute and
National Institute of Child Health and Human Develop
ment at the National Institutes of Health. She is currently
working on an honors thesis that focuses on transcription
coupled I)NA repair.
"I'm really honored that the fellowship committee re
ceived my application so well and am excited about now
pursuing the research I proposed," Mitra said. "I plan on
using the scholarship to both help fund my research as I
pursue an M.D./Ph.D. and help pay for my living expenses
throughout medical and graduate school."
Mitra added. "Doing research at Stanford has made me
learn to think creatively about science in a whole new way
and has definitely been one of the highlights of my under
graduate experience."
Interestingly. Tanedo, Dumesic anil Mitra all live in La
gunita, making the housing area one of the most Goldwa
ter-dense places in the country. Tanedo said.
