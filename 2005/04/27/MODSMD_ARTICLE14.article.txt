# But that's not the point...
## An Ode to the Profro 
### 
With the commencement of Admit
Weekend tomorrow, our campus
will soon be swarming with short
people carrying shiny red folders in hand
and meal cards around their necks. It's a
strange time of year. Those of us who are
RoHos have a stranger sleeping on our
floor, later asking us how to put our trays
away at dinner. Those of us who are not
RoHos are only vaguely aware the week
end exists at all. We're just pissed that it's a
dry weekend and we only know it's arrived
because the line for Jamba Juice is even
longer than usual.
Most of us are pretty condescending
about ProFros. They're under our feet,
they're keeping us from our weekend party
schedule and mostly, they just seem young.
As this weekend approaches. I've been
doing a lot of thinking about growing up.
As a resident assistant in a freshman dorm
(er, technically I'm a CAin FroSoCo, but
none of you know where that is), I've got
ten a lot of flak from my friends for spend
ing all my time with freshmen and sopho
mores. My pals make disparaging remarks
about I-Hum and PWR

papers. They mock my
freshmen for heading
out to frat parties, say
ing that, as older stu
dents, they are "so over
the Stanford party
scene." Even the
sophomores conde
scend to the freshmen,
and the hierarchy con
tinues. Each class

thinks: "Oh, how much those young
grasshoppers have to learn."
I'm not going to lie — there is a palpa
ble difference between the four classes.
The sophomores in my dorm are visibly
older than the freshmen. My freshmen will
feel ages older than the high school seniors
who are going to be flooding the campus
and hopping in the fountains this weekend.
When my friends come over to the dorm,
it's almost absurd how much older and set
tled they are compared to the residents
who stop by my room.
None of this is to say that I've reached
the pinnacle of maturity — that's definite
ly not the case. But it's an undeniable fact
that each day, each month you spend in col
lege changes you a little bit, and you can't
help but growing up a lot by the time you
reach the end of it.
However, the most important thing I've
learned as an RA is that if there are advan
tages in maturity or wisdom or just plain
experience as a senior, tljere are definitely
good things to be said for the younger peo
ple among us.
At the beginning of the year. I saw
freshmen reaching out to each other, over
coming personal hang-ups in order to meet
new people and make new connections. In
many ways, those interactions seem prefer
able to the cliquish behavior 1 see at Pub
Night and in the Row houses. It's not that
freshmen are not cliquish, but there is a
fresh attitude to their interaction that I
wish I could take with me when I leave the
dorm.
We lose that freshness when we let our
selves become the old. jaded seniors wor
ried about the "real world." And more
than that — when we let ourselves get too
comfortable only hanging out with each
other, all sort of trying to impress each
other in that awkward Stanford way (and
don't deny that you do it). We lose that
challenging experience of getting to know
people with a different background, and
we lose that exciting experience of having
to leave our comfort zones.
There are merits to being older, just as
there are merits to being younger. Some
things you can only learn by experience. 1
am so excited to see my freshmen and
sophomores in two or three years. In an al
most parental way, 1 am looking forward
with bated breath to see how they "turn
out." At the same time I'm glad that I know
them now, when they are young and before
they become too cool for me. 1 hope they
never lose the enthusiasm they have now.
Maybe I'm just going through a pre
graduation crisis, which is why I'm bab
bling about youth and experience. 1 may or
may not have spent the past two hours pan
icking about all the things 1 need to do be
fore I graduate. I've also have been known
to wail despondently about how I'm getting
old. usually in reference to my inability to
drink hard liquor anymore.
Hysteria aside. 1 know that my life isn't
over yet. 1 can still have that unbridled en
thusiasm for life that my freshmen had
when they first got here during Orientation.
I can still get to know someone without feel
ing constrained by the ruts I've gotten my
self into as an "older and wiser" upperclass
man. And when I graduate this June, I can
enter the "real world" with that wide-eyed
wonder that the ProFros will have when
they see the Oval and MemChu for the first
time. I just have a few more years of valu
able experience under my belt.

Have you reached the pinnacle of maturity,
or do you still feel like you re about 13 years
old? Either way, e-mail Emily at em
wood@stanford.edu to commiserate.
