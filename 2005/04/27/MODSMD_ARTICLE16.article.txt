"I love going to school at Stanford,',' said
Crosetto, a first-year student at the Stanford
Graduate School of Business. "I love the
weather — especially after two cold winters
in New York."
Crosetto transferred to Stanford after
spending his first undergraduate year at Har
vard for what he said was a more conducive
and social environment here.
"It was a better fit," he said. "There was
much more of a teamwork emphasis, more
group projects and people studying together."
An economics major and double minor in
art history and political science, Crosetto
graduated from Stanford in 2002 and went to
work for Goldman Sachs in New York as an
investment banker.
"Investment banking is a really challeng
ing lifestyle," Crosetto said of his 100-hours
a-week job.
When asked why he decided to stop
working and go to business school, Crosetto
said, "In terms of future goals, it was time to
take a step back and learn more about gen
eral business."
After a two-year break from the books, it
would seem that going back to school could
be difficult, but Crosetto found that he was
one of the youngest people in his class. Ac
cording to the Business School's admissions
Web site, students enroll after having
worked for about four years.
"It's a challenge getting back in the mode

of going to school again after working,"
Crosetto acknowledged. "It's different be
cause almost everyone who goes to business
school has worked for some time and it's a
challenge to get back in the mode of class and
readings. I have finals and midterms and all
that kind of stuff — it's an adjustment.
Crosetto said he returned to the West
Coast for business school in part because of
the class size.
"Stanford is clearly one of the top
schools," he said. "It has a great reputation
and is very small, with 370 kids in a class. It is
just a more collaborative environment with
unparalleled faculty."
Having attended Stanford as an under
grad, he is in a unique position to make a di
rect comparison about how the two experi
ences are different.
"The classes are smaller," he said. "Most
have 65 students or less, so that is a com
pletely different experience. There is no
intro to Econ' class with 400 kids."
He also said the mix of students in the
business school is somewhat different than
that of the undergraduate population.
"The people are different because busi
ness school students tend to be a lot more out
spoken," Crosetto said. "Also, the Business
School is 20 percent international students —
I have met a lot more people from other coun
tries than I did when I was an undergrad."
Crosetto said he feels that the Business
School should be more integrated into the
University as a whole.
"One program I am working on is getting
the business school integrated into the rest of
the rest of the University," he said.
