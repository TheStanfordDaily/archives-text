Salena Copeland thought she knew exactly what Stanford
Law School was going to be like. At 27 years old, Copeland,
now a first-year student, had plenty of friends with law school
experience who told her what to expect. In a lot of ways, she
was right — but in a lot of other ways, she was completely off
the mark.
"I always had a realistic impression of law school," she
said. "Still, it is entirely different to prepare for something
than to actually live it."
Copeland said she was immediately confronted with an
experience wholly different than her undergraduate career.
Copeland grew up in East Texas and attended the Uni
versity of Texas at Austin, where she was an English major.
Copeland never took a pre-law course; the extent to which
she was prepared to study law began and ended with "Histo
ry of American Cinema."
When she graduated in 2000, she joined the Americorps
fora year after which she bounced between Virginia and
Texas working at a natural foods store and teaching at a pre
school while taking continuing education classes. She finally
ended up in California working for nine months at a home
less shelter in Menlo Park that served the East Palo Alto
community. After four years of real life, Copeland enrolled
at Stanford Law in the fall of 2004.
She quickly learned that the first year of law school at
Stanford "has no wiggle room." Her entire first year has been
filled mostly with required classes with room for about one
elective. The biggest difference between undergraduate and
graduate level work for her has been the time commitment.
"At University of Texas we did work and then partied,"
Copeland said. "Academics did not dictate a lifestyle. Law
school at Stanford could now literally take up every second
of the day."
She spends an average of about 40 hours a week doing
reading, homework and partaking in a laundry list of activities.
"The work is like a vacuum," she said. "It'll suck up all
your time if you let it. But then again, some do a lot less and
do just fine."
Once Copeland and the other first-year law students are
able to gauge the amount of work they need to do, they can
begin to enjoy the incredible educational opportunities in
front of them.
"Law school molds my brain in a very different way than
my undergraduate experience," Copeland explained. "It
changes the way you think."
In her experience, the discussions and lectures are "so

cratic — a back and forth that pushes us to think," she said.
"My favorite professors are responsive to questions and
often play out a number of hypotheticals."
Copeland said she was shocked by the aggressiveness with
which firms and industries have recruited them.
"There is always a lot of free food and alcohol," she said.
"We're smart kids, but it is still surprising how firms are out
so much."
Since potential suitors are omnipresent, Copeland said
she realized that at Stanford, "you don't need a 4.2 [GPA] to
get a job," she said. "I realized that 1 don't have to kill myself
to be a top student."
This is part of perhaps Copeland's greatest insight in her
first year of law school: academic excellence is only a single
part of her experience.
"Law School is about activities, making connections,
being with friends and not just about being in the classroom,"
she said.
Friends? Who has time for friends?
"Yes, we do have time to hang out with friends," she said
with a laugh. The school sponsors social events for its stu
dents, such as "panels" that are often just an excuse for
friends to get together. There is also a weekly event called
"Bar Review" on Thursday nights for law school students to
go bar hopping in Palo Alto and San Francisco.
"You can pull back on the studying and have time fora so
cial life, a balanced life," she said. "There are ways to get out
of Stanford Law School, a bubble within a bubble."
Copeland places an important emphasis on her activities
outside of the classroom. She is co-chair of the National
Lawyers Guild and next year's co-President of Women of
Stanford Law. Copeland admits that "activities take more
time than homework."
Copeland says that her classmates have played an enor
mously positive role in easing her transition to professional
school. "What is unique about Stanford is that the students
recognize that this is a learning experience, not a competi
tion," she said.
Every class will have "gunners," law-speak for students
who talk during every single class, but even the vast majority
of "gunners" are caring and helpful people, Copeland said.
When it comes to giving her own advice to Stanford un
dergraduates who are thinking of attending law school,
Copeland suggested that people take a year off after getting
their undergraduate degree.
"Getting real life experiences and doing something be
sides school, stuff you just want to do. helps in appreciating
school more," she said.
