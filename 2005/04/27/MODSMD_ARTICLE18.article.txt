Linlike the cut-throat days of the pre-med experience,
once you get into medical school, "as long as you pass, you're
fine," explained Josemaria Paterno. a first-year medical stu
dent at the Stanford's School of Medicine.
This year's first-year medical school class is made up of 87
students who stay together for the first two years, which are
preclinical.
"You're with the same kids, so there's that continuity and
sense of community with your class," Paterno said. "It's com
fortable because you see a lot of familiar faces."
Paterno said that he thinks Stanford has a much less com
petitive atmosphere than most medical schools. "At Stan
ford we don't have the I lonor Society for the top 15 percent,
so it's very chill," Paterno safd. "People help each other out.
It's a very collegial environment."
Unlike the undergraduate university, the medical school
caps the quarterly course load at 35 units. Paterno said that
most students take 30 or more units.
"People are well-equipped to handle the work." Paterno
said. "Because med school classes are pass / fail, everyone is
not out to kill the curve and get that A / A+. The motivation
for mastery comes from within."
Medicine students find whatever ways they can to make
time for such a heavy course load, explained Paterno.
"[The professors J film all the classes, so you can watch them
all online instead of going to class," he said. "You can watch

them at 1.5 speed and get a 1 hour lecture done in 40 minutes."
In making the transition from undergraduate to graduate
work, Paterno has found the faculty "just as supportive, if not
more" than those from his undergraduate years.
Paterno stressed the importance of finding a good faculty
mentor for students who want to do research.

"Most people want to do research if they want to go into
a competitive residency program," he said. "For some sub
specialties, it is important that your research is in that field."
So far, Paterno's biggest challenge has been planning his
future. "Medicine is so broad," he explained. "Trying to
find the right lab and the right kind of research is very diffi
cult."
Paterno said he aspires to do well and get into a good res
idency. but as fora specializing, he is still looking. He de
scribed himself as a sort of "'Goldilocks' — looking for
what's just right, the perfect fit."
In looking back at his preparation for medical school, Pa
terno said he would do some things differently.
"1 would shadow more doctors and ask more and more
questions — not just [from] academic doctors, but also
[from] doctors in private practice."
Paterno attended Stanford as an undergraduate and de
cided to stay at Stanford for medical school because he had
"started to grow some roots here," he said. "This place was
not just a school but a home also." Paterno also wanted to
stay near his seven drawmates from his sophomore, junior
and senior years.
"[My drawmates] are still here, which is one of the reasons
why I stayed here. I still see them a lot."
Paterno also received advice to stay from his faculty men
tors as an undergraduate.
"They told me you'll want to stay here because of all the
connections I'd made here," he said. "It's important to know
how to use the resources here."
Like many medical schools throughout the country, Stan
ford is redesigning its curriculum to have a more integrated
systems-based approach.
"Stanford is in the second year of its new curriculum," Pa
terno said. "I think its heading in the right direction, and part
of our responsibility as a class is to give the faculty continual
feedback about our courses to keep improving."
Did his Stanford education help or hinder his admission
into medical school? Paterno doesn't seem to think so.
"Stanford looks for certain things," Paterno noted. "This
is a big research school. If you have done research, and have
strong board scores and a good GPA and good letters of rec
ommendation. then you're okay."
