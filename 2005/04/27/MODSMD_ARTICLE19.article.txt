## Editorial New pope can change the world 
### 
Over the weekend. Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger was installed as Pope Benedict
XVI, the successor to the late Pope John
Paul 11. We believe that this key historic
event affects everyone, Catholics and
non-Catholics alike. As the religious lead
er of more than one billion people world
wide, Pope Benedict XVI has the author
ity to effect change and reform that could
impact the lives of many people around
the world. As such, we are eager to see
what actions Pope Benedict XVI will take
during his term.
The new pope's conservative views re
lied the views held by practicing
Catholics around the world, many of
whom want a leader who will preserve the
traditions of the Church. Like his prede
cessor Pope John Paul 11. Pope Benedict
XVI takes a conservative stance on many
issues like abortion and homosexuality.
Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the
conciliatory language Pope Benedict XVI
used during his inaugural homily, and we
hope that he will continue in this spirit of
reconciliation throughout his term by
uniting people, not dividing them.
While Pope Benedict XVI is known
for his conservative leanings, we still feel
that there is room for reform in the
Catholic Church. One issue that the
Church needs to address immediately is
that of child molestation by Catholic
priests. At the very least, the new pope
ought to make a public statement ac
knowledging the severity of the issue. He
should then set strict rules condemning
such behavior within the church. Priests
charged with molestation should immedi
ately be removed from their position

within the Church — a common-sense
measure that the Church has yet to em
brace.
Although the new pope is not from
Asia, Africa or Latin America — a disap
pointment for some Catholics — Pope
Benedict XVI must pay great attention to
the Church's members in these regions.
After all. Brazil is the country with the
greatest number of baptized Catholics in
the world, and the Catholic Church is ex
periencing tremendous growth in Asia
and Africa. We hope that the new pope
will be more understanding of the partic
ular conditions of life in the developing
world.
In particular. Pope Benedict XVI
should be sensitive to the pressures of
overpopulation and the spread of sexual
ly transmitted diseases in developing
countries. So far, the Church's reluctance
to acknowledge the benefits of condom
use has had far-reaching ramifications in
developing countries, particularly sub-Sa
haran Africa. That said, the new pope
should review the Church's stance on con
traception and its current implementa
tion, in an attempt to light these disturb
ing trends in the developing world.
In a similar vein, we trust that the new
pope will lake into consideration the real
ities of modern life and appreciate the
complex interplay between modernity
and religious doctrine. There are no easy
answers to questions in the interface of re
ligious principles and everyday life, espe
cially when dealing with controversial is
sues. We hope Pope Benedict XVI will
provide thoughtful leadership, making
these decisions easier, not toucher.
