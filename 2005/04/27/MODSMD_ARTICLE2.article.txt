# Munger parking plans accepted
## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
University administrators have decided to accept rec
ommendations from Stanford's Traffic Advisory Com
mittee to build the proposed parking structure for the
Munger housing project to be constructed directly under
neath Wilbur Field and delay the widening of Campus
Drive.
Robert Reidy, vice provost of Land and Buildings, said
that the parking garage will hold 850 parking spaces, 380
more than currently exist in this area on the east side of
campus.
TTie Munger project includes 600 beds, and planning
data suggests that 80 percent, or 480, of those residents
will own cars. This apparent shortfall of 100 parking
spaces due to the allocation of only 380 new car stalls, ac
cording to Reidy, will be recovered by removing the tem
porary trailers on the corner of Escondido and Campus
Drive.
Reidy said that throughout the planning stage, prox-
imity and land use were the driving
factors in the final decision to place
the parking structure beneath
Wilbur Field.
"We explored four options above
ground: structures on the Maples
pavilion parking lot, Wilbur parking
lot, Wilbur playing field and between
the Wilbur and Stern Dorms," Reidy
said. "We also explored two under
ground options which were under the
graduate residences or under Wilbur
field. Land use led us to the under
ground solution as the appropriate
response, and proximity led us to
under the residences, or under
Wilbur field."
To make the final decision be
tween placing the structure under
neath Wilbur Field and underneath
the Munger residences, the committee
considered engineering concerns and
flexibility of the construction schedule.
" The final decision eliminated the
technical engineering complications
that would be created if the parking
were located under the residences
and leveraged the ability to be flexi
ble in separating the construction
schedule for the garage and hous
ing," Reidy said.
Chris Christofferson, a member of

the Traffic Advisory Committee and
associate vice provost of land and
buildings, said that there was no op
position from committee members.
"We took the proposal to the traf
fic advisory group for their review
and recommendation," he said.
"They were unanimously in support
of the Wilbur Field location."
The field will be closed off during
construction of the parking structure,
which will last several months. After
construction is completed, the field
will be reopened on top of the new
underground garage.
"Two major advantages of this
proposal are that we will retain a bal
anced parking count close to the user
groups while also retaining the field
on top of the underground garage,"
Christofferson said.
David Beaver, assistant professor
of linguistics and resident fellow of
Arroyo in Wilbur, said that while he
was not opposed to the idea of mov
ing the parking structure under
Wilbur Field, the project will likely
cause discomfort.
"This construction will require
the removal of 19,(KK) truck loads of
dirt," he said. "If my calculations are
correct, that would require a truck
leaving every few minutes for the
next several months. There will be a
great deal of noise and dust, but I am
in favor of a plan that keeps the car
park out of the way and preserves the
use of the field."

Angela Du, a freshman living in Rin
conada, said she is skeptical about the
location of the new parking structure.
"It would he really annoying to
have to deal with construction," Du
said. "II they could finish it during
summer I guess it wouldn't be a huge
deal, but then we would have to deal
with all of the extra traffic around
Wilbur Field, which would be a has
sle. I know a lot of people at Berkeley
who had construction going on and it
really disrupted their sleep and
studying."
Reidy. however, said that traffic in the
area would not be a problem and widen
ing Campus Drive is not necessary.
"Early on we believed that the ad
ditional occupants would trigger the
need to widen the road," Reidy said.
"After considerable study by traffic
engineers, it was determined that
that at this time we did not need to
widen the road."
Campus Drive will, however,
have to be widened at some point to
accommodate further construction
in coming years.
"We know that sometime in the
future — say 15 years from now —
there will be a need to widen the road
to respond to future campus devel
opment," Reidy said. "However,
most of the future eastern campus
growth is planned housing and the
traffic created by housing is less com
pared to an equivalent amount of of
fice or research space."
