## In defense of the post office 
### 
II 1 didn't know better,
I'd say that you don't like
the post office. You grum
ble about its slow service
and complain that the lines
are too long. You moan
about its employees and
whine about your P.O. box
being too low to the
ground.
But I do know better

And I know you love the post office. Well. 1 do
at least, and you should too.
The |X)st office is very much a 19th century
institution dressed in 21st century clothes. It
tries to make itself sexy with all that delivery
confirmation and priority mail, but in reality, it
uses many of the same methods to transport
mail that it did one or two hundred years ago.
True, the horses have been put out to pas
ture and the Pony Express has been replaced
by overnight jets and those trucks with the
driver's side on the right, but the basic gist of
the institution of the post office has remained
the same. In fact, it has improved.
Everywhere in this vast country, the fourth
largest on the planet, postal employees walk
door-to-door delivering mail at no cost to the
recipient. That there exists a system to deliver
mail door-to-door in itself is amazing, but that
it's free boggles the mind.
The post office is one of the only federal
agencies that gets not a single dime of your tax
dollars. Its operations are financed entirely by
those jieople that send mail â€” the post office
survives one stamp at a time.
And stamps are still pretty cheap. 1 know,
you'll tell me that e-mail is free, but it's not, re
ally. We all pay that insane $ 12 per month to be

able to send e-mail in the first place. That
works out to about 50 postcards per month,
not a huge number considering I sent over3(X)
e-mails in that time.
But if you're like me, you hate getting e
mail and love getting postcards. E-mail falls
into one of three categories: junk, annoying an
nouncements and useful stuff. And 1 know you
get eight in the first two categories for every
one in the last.
Getting real mail is fun. Over the course of
this year, I've received 36 postcards from 14
different countries (yeah, it's great to hear how
good a time all your friends are having abroad
when you're stuck on campus all year long). E
mail from Paris looks like e-mail from any
where. but a postcard from Paris looks just in
credible.
But the post office is in trouble. The rise of
the Internet, with its online bill paying and e
mail services, has meant a decline in real mail
traffic. T his has forced the post office to raise
rates a little bit and cut back on services. There
is a slippery slope here, but you can help to stop
any slide before it begins.
Send somebody a postcard or a letter or a
package (try sending those homemade brown
ies through e-mail and tell me how they taste).
The post office will be around for centuries if
we decide that it's worth keeping around. And
it is worth keeping around, because every time
I go in there. I see somebody smile because
they just got a postcard or a letter from some
body far, far away.
And delivering joy is really what the post
office is all about.
