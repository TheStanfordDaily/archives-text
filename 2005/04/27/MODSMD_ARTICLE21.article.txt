Article on Berkeley pledge
sensationalized a minor incident
Regarding The Daily article "Berkeley
pledge shot by fraternity brothers" (April
25): There is, of course, no legitimate excuse
for fraternity hazing, and the perpetrators of
this incident at Cal seem to be a particularly
sordid bunch. But. after reading the article,
we can say one or two things thing in their
defense: a) they didn't kill him. b) and they
didn't shoot him with a firearm. To me. that
was a surprise; I got the distinct impression
from your headline that a murder had been
attempted across the bay. I understand your
headline is semantically accurate, but it lacks
the precision that allows a reader to grasp
what truly happened.
There are further problems. This incident
did not happen last Friday, as The Daily sug
gests. It did not happen last week. It didn't
even happen the week before. The alleged
hazing incident, according to the San Jose
Mercury News and the Daily Californian,

occurred on April 8. That is 17 days ago. It is
not news.
The news to be reported (judging from
the Daily Californian's April 22 account,
"Fraternity Feels the Sting of Hazing") is
that three members have now been expelled
from the chapter. Phis is mentioned in one
sentence of the story in your paper. The im
pression the reader gets is that the incident
occurred on Friday (April 22), and by Mon
day (April 25) the perpetrators had been
shown the door. 1 was surprised that the fra
ternity boys at Berkeley had moved that fast;
such responsible, expeditious action would
redound to their credit. Of course, I was right
to be surprised. It wasn't true.
I know news is slow on this campus. It must
be terribly difficult to put together a com
pelling daily paper. But I don't believe that
difficulty is any excuse to sensationalize an in
cident that only resulted in minor injuries.
