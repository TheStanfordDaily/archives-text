# Techie repairs the world
## Give peace a chance 
### 
In the United States we tend to believe
that our wars result in some kind of net good,
that they make the world a better place in gen
eral. We believe that violence can create
something good. That's why we invade places
like Iraq — to make the world a safer place
and benefit the Iraqis. But. in truth, how has
this principle ever benefited America?
Revolutionary War: Roughly 30,000
American troops and an unknown number
of civilians. French, Indian and British
troops died. And today are we any better off
than Australia or Canada, really?
War of 1812: We declared war and basi
cally lost because nothing changed. 25,000
people died.
Mexican-American War: We started this
war, took a large part of Texas and all of Cal
ifornia from Mexico. 37,(HH) people died.
American Civil War: Roughly 600,000
people died. Blacks remained oppressed for
another 100 years. Could have been prevent
ed (and the Union preserved) if the North
had voted for Douglas rather than Lincoln.
Slavery might have ended more peacefully,
as it did in Brazil 20 years later.
Spanish-American War: The U.S.S.
Maine blew up in Havana Harbor, which
many now think was the result of an acci-

dent. We went to war
against Spain and took
many of their posses
sions. 7.5(H) people died.
And here's where the
numbers get really crazy:
Philippine-American
War: We fought to keep
the Philippines in the
Union and won. About
600, (XX) dead

World War I: A European war involving
mutual aggression by both sides. We decided
to get involved, in part because we had
loaned Britain tons of money. 121,000
Americans died. 14 million Europeans died.
Would the world have been worse-off if Ger
many had won?
World War II: The only war we've been
involved in that wasn't a war of choice. I'll
give it to you.
Korean War: Although begun by a North
Korean invasion, the main casualties of the
war came after we reinvaded. 54.0(H) Ameri
cans, 2.5 million Koreans, 1 million Chinese
dead for our "proxy" war. In Pyongyang,
where 400,000 people once lived, two build
ings were left standing.
Vietnam War: 60,(HH) Americans, 3 mil

lion Vietnamese and 600,000 Cambodians
dead.
Persian Gull War: Saddam invaded
Kuwait, and we attacked him. About 25.(XX)
deaths total. Our subsequent sanctions im
poverished Iraq, once a relatively wealthy
nation. 500,000 children died as a result.
Iraq War: Who can say?
This does not include the numerous po
lice actions, such as the occupation of the
Dominican Republic and Haiti, covert oper
ations and Indian wars. We chose to get in
volved in every one of these wars except
World War 11. Except for the Mexican-
American war, most of these wars didn't
even benefit us. I realize hindsight is 20/20.
I'm only using America as an example, but
nearly all industrialized countries have a his
tory of aggression and slaughter. History
keeps telling us the same thing over and over
again; that war rarely leads to anything good.
When will we listen to it?
