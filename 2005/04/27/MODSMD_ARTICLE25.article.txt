## An open letter to the Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility 
### 
We the undersigned, as faculty and staff of Stanford University,
request that Stanford's endowment fund divest itself of equity
(shares) in five transnational companies that are complicit in the
genocide in Darfur: China National Petroleum Company, Siemans
AG, Alcatel SA. ABB Ltd. and Tatneft.
In March 2004, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator
for Sudan described the situation in Darlur as an instance of "eth
nic cleansing" and"the world's greatest humanitarian crisis." In
July 2004, both houses of the United States Congress passed a res
olution declaring the atrocities in Darfur to constitute genocide.
In September 2004 then-Secretary of State Colin L. Powell de
clared that genocide has been committed in Darfur. for which the
Sudanese government and the so-called Janjaweed militia groups
bear responsibility. On January 25,2005, a special United Nations
commission of inquiry concluded that "the Government of Sudan
and the Janjaweed are responsible for serious violations of inter
national human rights and humanitarian law amounting to crimes
under international law" and including "killings of civilians, tor
ture, enforced disappearances, destruction of villages, rape and
other forms of sexual violence, pillaging and forced displacement,
throughout Darfur."
While we understand that the request that the endowment di
vest itself of its holdings in certain corporations is a serious matter,
we find the evidence that genocide and other human rights viola
tions are taking place in Darfur extensive and compelling. In re
questing that the endowment divest itself of equity in the compa
nies above, we are requesting that the Advisory Panel on Invest
ment Responsibility honor an ethical principle expressed in the
Stanford University Statement on Investment Responsibility Con
cerning Endowment Securities of October 15. 2002, as follows:
"When the Trustees adjudge that corporate policies or prac
tices cause substantial social injury, they, as responsible and ethi
cal investors, shall give independent weight to this factor in their
investment responsibility practices ..." The Statement of Invest
ment Responsibility defines "substantial social injury" as includ
ing "actions that violate, subvert, or frustrate the enforcement of

rules of domestic or international law intended to protect individ
uals and/or groups against deprivation of health, safety, basic free
doms or human rights."
In light of this principle, we find the evidence that genocide and
other human rights violations are taking place in Darfur so extensive
and compelling that in this case divestment seems a humane and
thoughtful response. As members of the Stanford University com
munity. we confront, in this issue, a still unfolding crisis whose human
cost is staggering. We urge that the members of the Advisory Panel
and the University's Board of Trustees adjudge this cost in human
lives and human rights worthy of the profound consideration implicit
in the serious act of divestment from the above-named corporations.
