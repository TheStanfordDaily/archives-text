## Right in the Babymaker Greedy Pohlad ruining Twins 
### 
In case you hadn't noticed, the American
League consists only of the Boston Red
Sox and New York Yankees, with the other
12 franchises cowering in the shadows like
Devil Rays fans. So when Baseball Pope Peter
Gammons picked the Minnesota Twins to win
the 2005 World Series, it came as something of
a surprise to most insiders.
Still, there is one pressing reason why the
Twins won't succeed (at least not in the con
ventional "wins and losses" sense): Carl
Pohlad.
Money-grubbing does not begin to describe
Pohlad, the 87-year-old owner of the Twins
and the 258 th richest man in the world. In 2001
Pohlad attempted to sell the franchise to
Major League Baseball fora sum far over its
market value, claiming it to be a worthless

franchise that couldn't com
pete. In response, the Twins
reached the ALCS the fol
lowing year, and their fans
vilified Pohlad as a real-life
Mr. Burns — a parallel that
borders on nonfiction, as he
got his start foreclosing on
farms during the Depression.
Pohlad's Twins, who cur
rently play in the cavernous

55,000-seat Hubert H. Humphrey "Hefty
Bag" Metrodome, are pushing fora new pub
licly funded ballpark. Twins fans, however,
who would rather see Johan Santana in a Yan
kees cap than put any more money than they
have to in Pohlad's coffers, are still reluctant.
Pohlad's contribution to the new ballpark's
estimated $478 million pricetag will be around
$125 million, but there are no restrictions on
where that money could come from. That
means that Pohlad is free to raise the money by
any means he sees fit. This could include pimp
ing out Torii Hunter as a male prostitute, hir
ing blind orphans to manufacture Twins mem
orabilia — or, most likely, by hiking ticket
prices and selling stadium naming rights, so the
Twins will spend the next 40 years in style at
Tampax Field or Durex Park or something
equally abhorrent.
The other $353 million, of course, will be
pried directly from the pockets of the Hen
nepin County, Minn., taxpayers, whose love
for the Twins will, at long last, be quantified in
monetary form. And if their legislators don't
pass a referendum raising sales taxes, say hello
to your San Antonio/Mazatlan/Honolulu
Twins.
The threat to move a franchise to increase
profits has been around almost since time im
memorial in sports, as heartbroken fans in
New York, Brooklyn, Boston, Philadelphia,
Kansas City, New Orleans, D.C., Montreal,
Oakland, Los Angeles — well, you get the pic
ture — could tell you. Most egregious, though,
was the example of the NHL's Hartford
Whalers in 1997. After an 18-year marriage be
tween franchise and city, owner Peter Kar
manos Jr. essentially held the Whalers ransom
in exchange fora new arena paid for by the city
of Hartford. When the resolution to pay for it
fell short, he whisked the Whalers away to
Raleigh and renamed them the Hurricanes. Of
course, Karmanos painted the situation so it
looked like Hartford fans didn't love their
team — even though to keep them in town
Whaler fans would have had to buy season
tickets at a per capita rate of almost 13 times
that of New York Yankees fans.
Pohlad, using Karmanos' example, seems
to be preparing to let the Twins slowly rot in
the Metrodome, a venue more poorly suited
for baseball than an abandoned warehouse, in
an effort to force the taxpayers into a pony-up
or-kiss-them-goodbye situation.
Publicly funded stadiums are, almost un
equivocally, financial disasters. For one thing,
they put the burden of a pro sports franchise
on people who don't necessarily want to sup
port it, instead of placing the onus for making
the team profitable on the ownership. Under
the current system, if the Twins don't get their
stadium deal and end up moving or being con
tracted, Pohlad can make it sound like the pub
lic didn't want to produce the cash to keep
them around.
Furthermore, stadiums have a way of turn
ing into black hole* for public funds that be
come obsolete long before they've "paid for
themselves" — an assertion that is dicey, at
best. Pohlad can agitate fora retractable roof,
Corinthian leather seats and whatever other
additions he wants, but no matter how modern
the stadium, it will almost certainly be out of
date in the next 10 years as the arms race that
is the ballpark business continues.
The worst consequence of the stadium pro
liferation, however, is the quick-fix mentality
— the idea that success on the field is as simple
as new stadium = increased revenue = better
players = championship. But hey, PNC Park,
which is lauded as nothing short of a baseball
Taj Mahal by all its visitors, really turned the
Pirates' fortunes around, right? Of course,
none of this negative evidence will halt
Pohlad's drive to squeeze the Twins out of ex
istence, even though a relatively small outlay
on his part would make him a Minnesota
sports hero for generations and shore up the
Twins' financial viability in the long run.
"With the substantial contribution we're
making, I don't know how they can say no,"
Pohlad said of lawmakers and fans.
Easy, Carl. They'll just wait until you die.

the current system, if the Twins don't get their
stadium deal and end up moving or being con
tracted, Pohlad can make it sound like the pub
lic didn't want to produce the cash to keep
them around.
Furthermore, stadiums have a way of turn
ing into black hole* for public funds that be
come obsolete long before they've "paid for
themselves" — an assertion that is dicey, at
best. Pohlad can agitate fora retractable roof,
Corinthian leather seats and whatever other
additions he wants, but no matter how modern
the stadium, it will almost certainly be out of
date in the next 10 years as the arms race that
is the ballpark business continues.
The worst consequence of the stadium pro
liferation, however, is the quick-fix mentality
— the idea that success on the field is as simple
as new stadium = increased revenue = better
players = championship. But hey, PNC Park,
which is lauded as nothing short of a baseball
Taj Mahal by all its visitors, really turned the
Pirates' fortunes around, right? Of course,
none of this negative evidence will halt
Pohlad's drive to squeeze the Twins out of ex
istence, even though a relatively small outlay
on his part would make him a Minnesota
sports hero for generations and shore up the
Twins' financial viability in the long run.
"With the substantial contribution we're
making, I don't know how they can say no,"
Pohlad said of lawmakers and fans.
Easy, Carl. They'll just wait until you die.
