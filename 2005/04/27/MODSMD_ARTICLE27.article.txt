# Warburg defends singles title
## Tennis dominates at Pac-10s 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
A Pacific-10 Conference singles title, a Pac-10 dou
bles title, the No. 1 singles player in the country and the
No. 1 doubles team in the country. It's shaping up to be a
pretty good week for the No. 21 Stanford men's tennis
team.
The Cardinal (13-10, 4-3) traveled to Ojai, Calif., to
compete last Thursday through Sunday in the Pac-10
Championships. Despite being behind No. 6 UCLA, No.
13 Washington and No. 19 Southern California in the
team rankings, Stanford made its presence clear in both
of the main draws of this individual tournament with
Stanford capturing both the individual singles and dou
bles Pac-10 titles.
"1 know we didn't win some of those tight [matches],"
head coach John Whitlinger said, "but 1 thought we
stayed together pretty well as a team. [Assistant Coach
Dave Hodge and I] were very happy with what went on
down [in Ojai]."
Senior Sam Warburg defended his singles title. About
an hour later, he also went on to claim the doubles title
with junior KC Corkery.
"I was definitely fatigued [after singles]," Warburg
said. "I had a long match, and there was a lot of pressure,
a lot more pressure than I've felt in a while. There was
only a little time [between matches] so it was hard to
change focus. But once I got out on the court, I was fired
up and ready to go. I knew that KC needed me to step up
and play well, because I knew he was going to play well."
In addition to both players' strong serves and tough
returns, the support of their teammates helped propel
them through the draw as well.
"Everyone felt like they had a lot of support when
they were playing because everyone that wasn't playing
at the time came up and was watching and cheering for
the other guys on the team," Corkery said. "It was some
thing that I thought r<#illy helped us throughout the tour
nament."
This was Corkery's first Pac-10 doubles titles after
multiple appearances in the finals of this tournament.
