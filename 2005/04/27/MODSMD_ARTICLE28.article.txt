## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Stanford's 7-0 win over Saint Mary's (9-
42,2-15 Pacific Coast Softball Conference)
last night was one of those games a Cardinal
fan could expect to go home from early and
happy. With junior Laura Severson breez
ing through the Gaels' lineup, and the Car
dinal (35-9, 8-3 Pacific-10 Conference)
scoring in the first three innings, the game

was nearly over before the sun set.
With a doubleheader coming up on Sun
day, the focus on the game was to get ready
fora four-game weekend.
"I didn't want to throw a lot of pitches,"
Severson said. "I was just focusing on get
ting ahead, making my pitches break and
letting my defense work for me. I use mid
week games as stepping stones for the
weekend to feel good about the weekend
when we play our Pac-10 games."

While Severson delivered a quick top of
the first inning, the Cardinal bats stretched
out the bottom half as long as they could.
After Gaels pitcher Kate Albaugh (1-3) put
a runner on with a walk, senior catcher Leah
Nelson homered for Stanford's first runs.
Sophomore leltfielder Jackie Rinehart fol
lowed with a standup triple and scored on
freshman Tricia Aggabao's bloop single.
"She worked a lot inside and I happened
to catch a pitch over the plate and I got my

hands around," Aggabao said. "I was lucky
enough to drive in a run."
With a 3-0 lead, Severson had a one-two
three inning before giving way to the Stan
ford offense again in the second. New pitch
er Lauren Gardner fared no better than Al
baugh in the circle. Junior Catalina Morris
doubled to deep center with two outs and
scored on a double to left-centerfield by ju-
nior shortstop Lauren Lappin.
After the Gaels went three-up and
three-down in the third, Stanford ju
nior pinch-runner Shoney Hixson
stole a base and came in to score on
Aggabao's single up the middle in the
bottom half of the inning.
Freshman Lauren Nydam came
in to pitch for Stanford in the fourth.
After falling behind 3-1 against the
first batter, Nydam moved the count
to 3-2 before inducing a groundout.

She also recorded her first of four
strikeouts in four innings of work.
Megan Galloway stepped in for
Gardner in the fourth, and though
Stanford put runners on the corners,
the righthander didn't allow the Car
dinal to score. Senior Katherine
Hoffman was tagged out at the plate
in a double play after she tried to
make it home on a pop up.
The Gaels finally put runners on
the basepath with one out in the fifth
via two free passes from Nydam.
The shutout would be preserved
though; freshman Michelle Smith,
playing at third, took out the lead
runner on a fielder's choice and
Nydam ended the threat with a

strikeout.
The Cardinal loaded the bases in
the bottom half of the fifth. Galloway
was well on her way to getting two
quick outs, but Hixson's speed al
lowed her to stretch a blooper into a
single. The next two batters reached
and Galloway hit senior Meghan
Sickler on the elbow to force in a run.
Errors plagued the Saint Mary's
defense all night. After Hoffman
flew out. the Gaels' third baseman
threw past the catcher and allowed
the runner at third to score.
"If any defense gives us extra
outs, it's our job to take advantage of
it and I think we did a good job of
that," said Aggabao, who went 3-
for-4 with two RBI.
Stanford scored two runs to bring
the score to 7-0 in that inning. With
the bases still loaded. Galloway
managed to make a double play and
the Cardinal's attempt to end the
game early by the mercy rule was
thwarted.
The Gaels' lone hit came from a
bunt by Staci Haniaguchi in the fol
lowing frame but Saint Mary's was
unable to produce any runs. Nydam
walked one more opponent before
getting Michelle Mathis to pop up to
end the game.
Severson and Nydam combined
fora one-hit shutout, while the
Stanford offense finished withl2
hits. The game allowed for plenty of
Stanford players to work at the
plate and on the field and show
cased the depth of head coach John
Rittman's squad.
"I feel like anyone of our players
could play an important game, too,"
said Severson, stressing that this was
more than just a game where every
one got to play. "This is to get people
chances so that they feel confident
for games where we do need them to
come in."
