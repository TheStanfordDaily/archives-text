# Card fall to Broncos
## 
### JESSICA PETERS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Beginning with the first batter of the
night, Stanford made the Santa Clara
Broncos (19-22,4-13 West Coast Confer
ence) feel more at home than they
should have at Sunken Diamond. Cardi
nal starter Erik Davis, a freshman
righthander, gave up a leadoff walk,
three hits and three runs — with the help
of an infield error — and was relieved
before the second out of the game was
registered.
From that point, Santa Clara hitters
entered the batter's box with a confi
dence that was evident in the final num
bers: seven runs on 13 hits, including two
doubles and the game's only home run.
The effort amounted to a 7-5 upset of the
No. 20 Cardinal (24-15, 7-5 Pacific-10
Conference).
"Santa Clara did a good job of hitting
pitches that weren't great," head coach
Mark Marquess said. "They didn't get
good pitches, but they hit well."
The Stanford bullpen struggled to
stop the damage, managing only to slow
it for the next few innings. Freshman re
liever Nolan Gallagher stepped in for
Davis and had the longest stint of the
evening, limiting the Broncos to two runs
(one unearned) on four hits in 3 2/3 in
nings.
Santa Clara starter Anthony Rea had
the cleanest Broncos outing of the night,
picking up the win to improve to 3-5.
Rea, who leads all Broncos starters with
a 3.84 ERA this season and was lights
out as a closer in 2004, allowed only one
hit in two scoreless innings on the
mound.
The rest of Santa Clara's predeter
mined rotation, however, wasn't as sharp
as Stanford's run and hit totals might in
dicate — the staff allowed six base
knocks and an astonishing 11 walks but
benefited from the Cardinal's failure to
bring their baserunners home.
Stanford got its first significant

chance to jump into the game in the
fourth inning. Righthander Dylan
Hickey began to lose his ability to lo
cate his pitches and walked sopho
mores Jim Rapoport and Adam Sorgi
to lead off the inning. Two singles and
one sacrifice fly later, Rapoport and
Sorgi had crossed the plate for Stan
ford. The inning held much more op
portunity for the Cardinal, but the bot
tom of the order stranded three
baserunners to end the frame.
"We really just never got anything
going offensively and left a lot of guys on
base," Marquess said, though he indicat
ed that overall, he has been fairly pleased
with the offense's performance this sea
son. "We're just nowhere near the offen
sive team that we were last year."
Santa Clara and Stanford each added
another run in the fifth. Broncos right
fielder Jason Matteucci led off the inning
with a base hit off sophomore reliever
Greg Reynolds and scored Santa Clara's
sixth run on a sacrifice fly. In the bottom
half of the inning, Stanford junior Chris
Lewis got aboard on a walk and came
home on a sacrifice fly by junior John
Mayberry, Jr.
Reynolds, who is typically an effec
tive reliever in Tuesday contests, threw
three innings but was lifted after allow
ing a solo home run in the eighth inning.
Junior closer Matt Manship stepped in
during the final frames while the Cardi
nal offense attempted to chase down the
Broncos.
Catching Santa Clara looked possible
in the eighth when the Cardinal loaded
up the bases on an error and and two
walks, followed by another walk to bring
Stanford within two. But Santa Clara re
liever Patrick Overholt got Sorgi (3-for
-4) to pop out to end the threat and Stan
ford stranded three runners for the sec
ond time in the game.
The Cardinal will have two non-con
ference games before their next Pac-10
tilt — one game at UC-Davis on Mon
day and another at Nevada on Tuesday.
