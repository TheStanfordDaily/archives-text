# Men sweep OSU, set for Saturday's Big Row
## 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
This past weekend, a Stanford sports team
accomplished a feat it hadn't accomplished in
more than a decade.
If you follow Stanford crew, you probably
know what happened. But if you don't follow
Stanford crew, now would be a good time to
start.
On Saturday morning, the No. 5 men's
team stroked its way to a clean sweep of No. 9
Oregon State. Despite their higher national
rank, the Cardinal didn't have history on their
side as they entered the weekend's competi
tion. In the last 11 years, the Stanford men had
managed nothing better than a split in their
matchups against the Beavers. But this year's
squad not only broke that trend â€” it broke it
in dominating fashion.
The Stanford and Oregon State first varsi
ty eights led off the morning's competition.
Knowing that an early lead would translate
into a critical psychological edge, both boats
approached the line focusing their mental and
physical energy on a strong start.
Neither team was able to establish an ad
vantage in the opening meters, but the Cardi
nal's training efforts paid off when they made
their first move 40seconds into the race.
"We've been focusing in practice on get
ting free speed' by making the motion of our
strokes as tluid and relaxed as possible,"
sophomore Donny Simkin said. "Around the
30th stroke of our start against Oregon State,
we could tell that the boat was strong and
smooth and that we were going to win."
As the two boats neared the five-hundred
meter mark about a minute later, the Cardinal

executed their second major push. This time,
it created some separation.
"We Ux)k a series of moves and it opened
up a lead that we built for the remainder of the
race," junior Jake Cornelius said. "It was a
good race for us because we found a nice
rhythm early on and continued to push."
The Cardinal had open water between
themselves and Oregon State as they passed
beneath the bridge half way down the course.
They never looked back and cruised across
the finish line seven seconds ahead of the Ore
gon State boat.
The men's second varsity eight followed
the same race strategy and made two moves in
the first five hundred meters. The responsibil
ity of inspiring the boat's oarsmen fell to
sophomore coxswain A1 Garcia.
"When we made our first move. Al voiced
his desire to 'bury them'," said junior Jeremy
Barton, who sat in the fourth seat of the sec
ond varsity boat. "At 1:40 in, he called in a
German accent to 'put ze foot down."
After the Oregon State boat pulled even
25 strokes into the race, the Cardinal's move
allowed them to pick up a three-seat lead. By
the time they reached the bridge, their lead
had been extended to six seats.
"We executed our race plan and had men
tally broken the Oregon State boat by the
half-way mark," sophomore Justin Brown
said.
The Cardinal turned their lead into an in
surmountable margin over the next 500 me
ters. Despite a late charge, the Oregon State
boat was unable to close the gap. The Stan
ford second varsity eight posted a 6:02 time,
coming across the line with four seconds to
spare to give the Cardinal the sweep over the

Beavers.
"We rowed the body of the race at proba
bly a 34/35 strokes per minute cadence, which
is lower then the 36/37 we're hoping to row by
Pac-10's," said senior Eric Feeny. "But based
on the good feel of [our practices] the days be
fore, we decided not to make rate calls."
The weekend's success was made even
sweeter by the fact that some of the Cardinal's
most bitter defeats have come at the hands of
the Beavers,
"A lot of our guys have a history of losing
to them," Cornelius said. "Some of our most
painful losses [have comej to Oregon State,
which makes this weekend especially reward
ing for the whole program."
With their strong performance this week
end, the Cardinal also reasserted their status
as one of the top five collegiate rowing pro

grams in the nation.
But while pleased with their sweep, the
Cardinal know that there will be greater chal
lenges to overcome before they can be satis
fied with their season.
"We're just trying to gain as much speed as
possible because Washington, Cal and Ore
gon State are all going to be very fast," sopho
more Kevin Baum said. "In the end though,
[these races are] all just stepping stones for the
Pac-10 championships in a few weeks."
On Saturday night, the Cardinal have the
opportunity to take on one of the toughest
programs in the nation. No. 2 California.
Earlier this season, the Stanford men pulled
off a stunning upset of the Bears in the first
heat of competition at the San Diego Crew
Classic. Knowing they have both the
strength and potential, Stanford looks to re

peat its effort when the two teams square off
this weekend.
Competition begins promptly at 5:30 p.m.
Saturday at Redwood Shores, just a few miles
North on 101. With morale and confidence
high after this past weekend, the Cardinal
hope to continue their recent success and
make history against the legendary California
program.
The Stanford men have defined new stan
dards for themselves this season - standards
that in the past they have never had the po
tential of reaching. In the tradition of Stanford
rowing, they will work to pysh themselves to
new heights - both in this weekend's competi
tion versus California and in next month's Pa
cific-10 Championships.
If you don't follow Stanford crew, now
would be a good time to start.
