## 
### RACHEL HODARA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There were only two teams on the
Cobb Track and Angell Field this past
Saturday, one in red and one in blue.
The stakes were high, though, as the
men and women of Cardinal track and
field battled their biggest rival, UC
Berkeley, for the Big Meet Title.
The women beat Cal for the sixth
consecutive time, and the men came
very close, falling short with 78 points to
Cal's 85. The teams came together for
the meet, which featured a ceremony to
honor the graduating seniors at both
Cal and Stanford before the final event,
the 4x400-meter relay.
The women were carried to victory
by several standout performances.
Sophomore Arianna Lambie won
the 1,500-meter, setting a new Big Meet
record with her time of 4:17.13. Cur
rently, Lambie is ranked fourth in the
country and second in the Pacific-10
conference in the 1,500. Lambie ran
with senior Sara Bei. who finished sec
ond in 4:24.47.
"1 felt really excited to beat Cal,"
Lambie said. "I felt good running with
Sara. The plan was to share the burden
of the race but go as hard as we could."
Lambie is thriving under the tute
lage of women's distance coach Dena
Evans, who emphasizes quality over
quantity for her runners.
"Dena's approach is to make sure
that I stay healthy and do everything
with precision," Lambie said. "1 feel re
ally good about the training and Satur
day was a good race that showed that I
am progressing well."
For distance runners especially,
avoiding injuries is key. Lambie dealt
with two injuries last year but is only
getting stronger this year. Her enthusi
asm is sure to bring her and the rest of
the women's team success in the major
meets coming up.
" I am really excited to go to Pac-10's
at UCLA and help win that meet for
Stanford for the first time ever in school
history," Lambie said.
Sophomore Katy Trotter won the
3,000-meter steeplechase in 10:18.50,
the best mark this season in the Pac-10,
and Alicia Craig blew the rest of the
competition away in the 5,000-meter
run. She finished the race in 16:29.66.
Senior Christine Moschella earned
a total of 18 points for the women, run
ning and scoring in four different
events. Moschella won the 400-meter
dash in 53.76, placed second in the 200-
meter dash in 24.05 and ran on both of
the women's winning relays — the
4xloo-meter relay and the 4x400-meter
relay.
Along with Moschella, sophomores
Jakki Bailey. Janice Davis and Ash
leigh Purnell made up the 400-meter
relay that won in 44.57. The 1,600-
meter relay, which included Moschella,
freshman Laura Mottaz, sophomore
Ashley Freeman and junior Chinny
Offor, finished in 3:41.08.
Freshman Erica McLain scored 10
points for the Cardinal, winning both
the triple and the long jump in 42'9"
and 207.25", respectively.
Freshman Danielle Maier scored
points as well, finishing first with anoth
er personal best in the javelin throw.
Her winning mark was 145'4".
"Danielle continues to move for
ward and excel," women's head coach
Edrick Floreal said. Sophomore Lind
sey Gannaway and freshman Maura
Burk both cleared the high jump at 1.70
meters, scoring valuable points for the
women.

Junior Sarah Hopping set a new
personal best on her way to winning the
hammer throw in 1%'4".
The men had an equally successful
meet but lost to Cal, whose men domi
nated in the hurdles and most of the
throwing events. The Cardinal men's
talent was showcased in the middle dis
tance and distance events.
"The middle distance and distance
core group as a whole did a fabulous
job," head men's coach Robert Weir
said. "They scored 34 out of a possible
36 points. We would like to see that
kind of strength and display of athleti
cism in some of the other areas of our
program."
Senior Don Sage, in only his second
meet of the outdoor season, won the
1,500-meter in 3:47.65.
"I did not know what to expect,"
Sage said. "It was my first 1 J>oo of the
year, and the guys on my team are real
ly good runners, so to be competitive in
that situation was a good confidence
booster." Sage attributed most of his
success to the talent of his team.
"I could not have run the way I did
without lan (Dobson], Lauren [Jesper
son) and Joaquin [Chapa] in there."
Sage said. "We feed off of each other
when we race. There is much more of a
team aspect in the race then you would
think."
It has been a rough road for Sage
ever since he returned from the USA
Cross Country Nationals in February,
where he placed third overall in the
4.000.
"I was sick one week, worn down
the next week, and am trying to race my
way back into shape," Sage said. If his

performance on Saturday is any indica
tion. he is well on his way to prime con
dition. Sage will play a major role for
the Cardinal at Pac-10's and nationals.
The teamwork of redshirt freshman
Nef Araia. senior lan Dohson and ju
nior Ryan Hall led to a one-two-three
finish for the Cardinal in the 5,000-
meter. Araia won in 14:14.73.
Redshirt freshman Michael Garcia
won the 800-meter in 1:50.85 to score
for the men.
"Michael is going to do wonderful
things for our program in the future,"
Weir said.
Junior David Vidal won the 3000-
meter steeplechase in 8:51.53, rounding
out a sweep of the middle and long dis
tance races by the Cardinal men.
The sprinters had an excellent
showing as well. Freshman Wopamo
Osaisai won the 100-meter dash in
11.14, and senior Curt Goehring won
the 400-meter dash in 47.39.
The Cardinal won the very last
event, the men's 4x400-meter relay,
closing with a huge win over Cal. The
relay was made up of Garcia, redshirt
freshman Russell Brown. Goehring
and senior Nick Sebes. running in that
order. The relay finished in 3:13.53.
"The 4x4 performance was out
standing," Weir said. "The perfor
mances of Sebes and Goehring —
those will be some very very big shoes
to fill when they graduate this year.
They have done an enormous job for
the program."
Other winners were junior Michael
Robertson in the discus, with a throw of
193-11. and Feranmi Okanlami in the
triple jump, with a mark of 48'1".

without lan (Dobson], Lauren [Jesper
son) and Joaquin [Chapa] in there."
Sage said. "We feed off of each other
when we race. There is much more of a
team aspect in the race then you would
think."

ever since he returned from the USA
Cross Country Nationals in February,
where he placed third overall in the
4.000.

the next week, and am trying to race my
way back into shape," Sage said. If his
