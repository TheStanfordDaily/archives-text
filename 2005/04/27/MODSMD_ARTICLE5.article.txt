# Universities' right to express under attack, says Hennessy

### BOB BOREK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Freedom of scholarly inquiry is
our greatest privilege," said Univer
sity President John Hennessy last
night during the fourth installment
of the Spring Speaker Series on lead
ership and civic responsibility.
Hennessy began by quoting sev
eral lines from Jane and Leland Stan
ford's founding documents, which
emphasize freedom of expression,
the formation of personally success
ful people useful to society and the
promotion of the public welfare.
Today, universities' rights to free
dom of inquiry and expression are
under attack in a way that it has not
been since the founding of the na
tion, Hennessy said.
In the post-Sept. 11 world, uni
versities are now being asked to re
strict information from international
students and from the general pub
lic, information that is labeled as
"sensitive but unclassified," he ex
plained.
"Here we have a much more dif

ficult territory because it is not al
ways clear what information is classi
fied," Hennessy said.
It is critical for university leaders
to stand up and identify classified re
search and information as a danger
zone, he added.
Hennessy then turned the talk to
the ways in which Stanford aims to
provide students with skills that will
propel them to leadership roles. To
this end, students are first provided
with a foundation in the humanities
that allows them to engage and expe
rience a diversity of thought, he said.
"A residential university is the best
way to educate young people and pre
pare them" because it allows them to
both live and learn in an intellectually
vibrant community, he said.
As for how the University can
work for the public interest in the
long-term. Hennessy said that Stan
ford must be "willing to lead, to take
proactive steps, to support research
in areas which we think could lead to
a greater public good."
He used stem cell research as an
example of this effort, adding that

the University has a responsibility to
understand the potential of such
studies, despite ethical debates.
Judgment cannot be made on the re
search until all potential benefits of
the new technology are known, Hen
nessy said.
Speaking briefly on his role as
leader of an expansive, diverse com
munity of more than 25,000, he said
that he always looks to the Funda
mental Standard when he makes de
cisions that could affect the campus
population.
Whenever he is faced with a
particularly difficult choice, Hen
nessy said he reviews the core mis
sion of the institution, adding that
his decisions are often influenced
by Jane Stanford's words: "We are
here for our children's children's
children."
He also stressed Stanford's role in
preparing students to become global
citizens, expressing his hope that the
University help students build an
ethical framework from the values
they bring when they first arrive on
campus.
