# Stanford is not STD-free zone

When that pick-up line finally works, contracting a
sexually transmitted disease is likely to be the last
thing on students' minds. Perhaps this is the problem.
Medical professionals are increasingly concerned
about the rise in people afflicted with sexually trans
mitted diseases, especially in genital warts, herpes and
chlamydia.
Nationwide, it is estimated that one out of every
four potential sexual partners is likely to have a sexu
ally transmitted disease. One in 500 is likely to carry
HIV.
While Stanford keeps no statistics due to confiden
tiality, Vaden Student Health Center estimates the
Stanford population to be on track with national
norms.
"People assume Stanford students to be more edu
cated, but that doesn't necessarily correlate to prac
tice," said senior Cat Alquero, who works at the Sex
ual Health Peer Resource Center at Vaden.
Still many students assume that the Stanford bub
ble is more-or-less a STD-free zone.
"1 think there is this conception that Stanford is
somehow safer because of this mentality that every

one is smart and well-educated," freshman Jess
Schafer said. "There is also the sense that there is less
dating, less sex and therefore less STDs."
However, less dating does not necessarily mean less
sexual activity among those who are sexually active,
just a lack of monogamy.
In fact, Donnovan Somera Yisrael, a sexual health
educator with Health Promotion Services, also a part
of Vaden, points out that fewer relationships often
leads to more partners, potentially increasing the like
lihood of contracting a disease.
However, according to Yisrael, it does not matter if
you do not know your partner's last name, if he or she
is drunk or sober or your third partner that week, as
long as proper precautions are taken.
Biologically — psychological ramifications aside
— you are safer hooking up with multiple people if
you consistently and successfully use condoms than if
you are in a monogamous relationship for years with
out being tested, he said.
"It has nothing to do with how the hook-up hap
pens," Yisrael said. "An STD has Hothing to do with
whether it's a random hook up or your husband of 20
years. All we care about, from a biological sense, is
whether people are using protection."
Condoms are the first recommendation for pro
tecting yourself from STDs, or now commonly re
ferred to as STls, since many ailments take the form of
infections. Alternatives include abstinence or
monogamy in conjunction with testing.
"The most effective way to stop STDs is the using
contraception," Alquero said. "If we want to reduce
the rate of STDs we need to increase education on
contraception and de-stigmatize any negative percep

tions that may exist about using protection."
While condoms are a student's best weapon against
STDs, many still hook up worry-free, believing they
are protected by the common birth control pill.
"1 think that people are more worried about preg-

nancies than STDs," senior Kate
Berglund said. "So if they are on
birth control and drunk they don't
really think about it."
Yisrael agreed that students
locus more on the threat of preg
nancy that contracting chlamydia.
" There is the idea that no matter
who you are you can get somebody
pregnant, but with STDs people
think of it differently," he said.
"You think you know the person;
they are a Stanford student; you
what car they drive, what frat
they are in and feel safer with them
and feel less of a need to use a con
dom."
No matter how well students
may think they know their part
ners, Somera emphasized the
importance of being tested regu
larly.
Students have two options: ei
ther confidential, comprehensive
screening through medical services
at Vaden or anonymous HIV test
ing upstairs in the SHPRC through
the HIV*PACT program. Health
Promotion Service also offers indi
vidual consultations to discuss
concerns about sexual health and
relationships in a confidential en
vironment.
