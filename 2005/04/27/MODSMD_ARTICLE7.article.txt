# New ASSU Senate inaugurated
## 
### SAL UMBERTO BONACCORSO STAFF WRITER 
At the final meeting of the sixth
ASSU Undergraduate Senate, a
new crop of senators was sworn in
and a new senate chair was elect
ed. But that wasn't before the Sen
ate, passed two bills that will
change the governing body's by
laws.
Measure A passed with 78.1
percent of the student body's vote
in the election. Accordingly, the
programming general fees and the
community service fees will be
abolished, and one join program
ming and community service gen
eral fee fund will be created.

As a result, several wording
modifications had to be made to
the Senate by-laws, and a new pol
icy had to be established so that
the fee could not be disproportion
ately spent by programming or
community service student groups.
The bill that was passed by the
Senate allocated at least 30 per
cent of the funds to programming
student groups and 30 percent to
community service groups.
The remaining 40 percent of
the funds will be distributed to
student groups regardless of their
status.
Several joint bills — bills that
must be passed by both the Senate
and the Graduate Student Council

— were also under consideration.
Ultimately passed by the Senate,
these bills dealt with the confirma
tion of the members of the Nomi
nations Commission and the 2005-
2006 financial manager of the
ASSU.
ASSU Vice President Aneto
Okonkwo, a junior, managed the
election of the new senate chair.
Senator Chris Nguyen, a sopho
more, was elected unanimously
and will preside over next year's
Senate meetings.
Before the meeting was ad
journed, 13 of the 15 newly elected
senators officially took office after
reciting the Senate oath to serve
the Stanford community.
