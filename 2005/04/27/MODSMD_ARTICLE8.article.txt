# LIVERight race raises awareness
## 
### FRANCOIS JEAN-BAPTISTE 
Registration for LlVERight, the first annual 5-kilome
ter run and fundraiser organized by Stanford's Asian Liver
Center and the Answer to Cancer Foundation, has been ex
tended to Friday, April 29. The run, intended to raise
awareness about hepatitis Band liver cancer, will begin at
8:30 a.m. Saturday at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.
According to the LlVERight Web site, as many as one
in 10 Asian Americans are carriers of hepatitis B, and most
don't even know they are infected.
Eric Sue. Class of 2004, the outreach coordinator for the
Asian Liver Center, said he hopes the run will shed light on
an issue that "hasn't received much attention in the public
eye."
"We're trying to put hepatitis Band liver cancer on the

map, much like HIV / AIDS and breast cancer," he added.
"Stanford students have worked tirelessly to put on this
event, taking care of all the logistical details, fundraising
and advertising."
Liver cancer has received little federal research funding.
Sue said.
"The Asian Liver Center's research goals can only be re
alized with the generous support of our donors as wel as
funds raised through events like LlVERight," he added.
Stanford-based Asian Liver Center is composed of
three branches — liver cancer research, outreach and edu
cation and the clinic.
"The Asian Liver Center research team has identified as
potential treatment and prognostic targets, several highly
expressed genes that have biological
functions relating to liver cancer de
velopment," Sue said.
Senior Sei-Gyung Kim. an intern
at the Asian Liver Center, said money
is being raised from race participants,
donations from supporters and corpo
rate sponsorships. The money will go
toward the Asian Liver Center's out
reach and programming efforts.
"1 have encountered people who
are shocked to hear about the high
rate of hepatitis Bin the Asian pop
ulation," Kim said. "It's easy to think
of cancer as something that only af
fects the older population, but he
patitis Band liver cancer have taken
the lives of people as early as in their
20s and 305."
Hepatitis B is a preventable dis
ease that, like other sexually transmit
ted diseases, is largely transmitted
through unprotected sexual contact,
blood transfusions and from mothers
to children. A majority of individuals
inflicted with liver cancer have al
ready been living with hepatitis B, ac
cording to the LlVERight Web site.
"4(H) million people in the world
are chronically infected with hepati
tis B. compared to 47 million people
who are living with HIV/AIDS,"
Sue said.
Seventy Stanford students have al
ready registered for LlVERight. and
the Asian Liver Center has produced
jade LlVERight bracelets, which will
be sold at the event for $10 each.
"It is easy to become pigeon-holed
in our thinking, like getting absorbed
in our studies and not thinking outside
the bubble." Kim said when asked
why it is important for students to at
tend the event.
"Every time I read the stories on
our Web site 1 am inspired to do some
thing about the disease that has gone
unnoticed for so long." she added. "In
raising awareness about this silent
killer, it is critical to start on this cam
pus— Stanford is building leaders
who will undoubtedly influence policy
and education in generations to
come."
