# Former S. Korean leader visits
## Kim speaks on nuclear crisis, reunification 
### JIN YOON 
Drawing on his life-long promotion of democracy
and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula, Kim Dae
jung, former president of the Republic of Korea, ad
dressed Stanford community members last night. Kim
discussed the current issues that affect inter-Korean
relations and offered his predictions for the future of
the region.
Former Secretary of State William Perry intro
duced Kim and praised his devotion to advancing rep
resentative government and human rights. He also ap
plauded Kim's effort to promote economic reform and
engagement with North Korea during his presidency.
Kim won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2(XM) for his com
mitment to democracy and his efforts to reduce ten
sion between North Korea and South Korea.
He first discussed the significance of the inter-Ko
rean summit in 2000, arguing that the conference,
along with South Korea's continuing humanitarian
and economic aid to North Korea, has had a positive
impact on the North Koreans' impression of South
Korea.
Many North Koreans previously regarded South
Korea as a "puppet of U.S. imperialism, trying to seize
an opportunity to attack North Korea," Kim said.
Shedding light on the current nuclear crisis in North
Korea, Kim warned that the country's possession of
nuclear weapons could provoke neighboring countries
like South Korea, Japan and Taiwan to shore up their
nuclear capabilities, perhaps igniting a risky arms race.
"North Korea must completely abandon its nuclear
weapons program and agree to receive thorough in

spections," Kim said.
He also stressed the critical role of the United
States in disarming North Korea, calling for the Unit
ed States to "provide security guarantees and lift the
sanctions from the North Korean economy."
He added that these actions should be carried out in
a multilateral framework such as the Six Party Talk, a
series of discussions that involved North and South
Korea, Japan, the United States, China and Russia.
Kim emphasized that cooperation between South
Korea and the United States is crucial in preventing
nuclear proliferation throughout the region. In order
to ensure peace and stability in the future, he said it
will be essential to achieve a nuclear-free Korea, to
conduct discussions using the Six Party Talk frame
work and to strengthen the South Korea-U.S. alliance.
Kim then addressed the prospect of uniting the two
Koreas, saying that attempts for reunification should

be guided by the three principles of "peaceful coexis
tence, peaceful exchange and peaceful reunification."
These, he said, are the "gist of the Sunshine Policy,"
which was created to encourage North Korea to im
plement reforms for increased openness.
Kim estimated that it could take at least 10 to 20
years to achieve reunification given the economic bur
den that South Korea would have to bear.
"We do not want a rapid reunification," Kim said,
citing the reunification of Germany in suggesting that
such an event could exacerbate tension among citi
zens.
During the question-and-answer session, Kim spent
a great deal of time expressing his concerns about
Japan's refusal to acknowledge the past atrocities that
it committed against Korean citizens. In omitting some

historical facts from textbooks and
failing to take responsibility for
crimes perpetrated during WWII,
Japan is not properly educating its
citizens, Kim said.
Gi-Wook Shin, professor of so
ciology and director of the Korean
studies program at Stanford,
Kim's strong rhetoric against
Japan stood in striking contrast
with his policies toward Japan dur
ing his presidency.
"I was quite surprised by the
tone of his speech regarding

Japan's denial of its past wrongdo
ing since his administration's poli
cies were directed toward promot
ing reconciliation between South
Korea and Japan," Shin said.
A Japanese graduate student
from the Center for East Asian
Studies, who asked to remain
anonymous, responded to Kim's
criticism of Japan.
"The Japanese are fully aware
of what we did," he said. "Japanese
education is not lacking in educat
ing people with essential historical
facts."
