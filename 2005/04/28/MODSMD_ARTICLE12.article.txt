# Clawing my way to a healthy diet
## 
### PRIYA JAYACHANDRAN HEALTH COLUMNIST 
Yesterday I ate a chocolate-covered bear
claw. For me, donut consumption is not some
thing that is planned. It's one of those things that
just happens, much like a car accident or the birth
of a sibling. The craving appears suddenly — and
before I know it — the food is in my stomach.
To my credit though, 1 only ate half the bear
claw before the guilt got to me. Having heard so
much recently about the dangers of being over
weight, I've been a little preoccupied with main
taining a healthy diet.
Indeed, it has come to my attention that one
of life's most basic activities has become way too
complicated in recent years. Since the dawn of
humankind, people have been eating. Sure,
things have come a long way since a herd of hairy
men would chase down a wild beast and devour
the flesh off its bones. (Well, actually that's basi
cally what happens at Black Angus every Friday
night — minus the running — so maybe things
haven't changed all that much.)
What has changed significantly in the past 30
years is the amount of time we spend eating. And
not onlv is it the amount of

time we spend eating, hut in
the past five years or so, the
amount of time we spend dis
cussing how we shouldn't be
eating what we're eating. The
term "obesity epidemic" has
been tossed around like Brit
ney Spears rumors on the In
ternet. Health officials con
stantly scold us to eat less, cit
ing statistics about rates of

heart disease and diabetes.
The obesity problem is due in part to the in
crease in food variety and availability that has
marked the economic growth of the past few
decades. In just the one-block area around my
house, for example, there is a large supermarket,
five fast-food establishments and four sit-down
restaurants.
When I succumbed to temptation yesterday,
it only took a 30-second car ride to get to Happy
Donuts and indulge. It was probably a lot easier
to diet back in the l5(X)s when your only option
was a lump of unsalted. maggot-infested meat.
And dieting keeps getting more complicated.
For years we were told to cut down on fat. Then
came the Atkins diet, and we were led to believe
that carbohydrates were the real demons. Store
shelves were filled with everything from low
carb ice cream to low-carb bread. But as Krispy
Kreme's profits shrank. American waistlines
continued to expand.
The media warned us about the economic and
social ramifications of the obesity epidemic on a
daily basis. Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation"
became a best-selling book. Morgan Spurlock's
"Super Size Me" was a hit at the box office and
"The Biggest Loser," a popular TV show featur
ing a weight loss challenge that publicly humili
ates obese people, was widely watched.
The situation got so bad that the good people
of Sesame Street have started feeding Cookie
Monster fruits and vegetables, rationalizing that
cookies are a "sometimes food." McDonalds did
away with the Super Size option. Instead, some
funeral casket manufacturers, like the Southern
Heritage Casket Co. of Alabama, introduced the
option for their larger customers.
Then, just last week, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture replaced the classic food pyramid with
MyPyramid, which is actually a series of 12 impos
sibly complex and highly specific pyramids that
combine food and exercise recommendations.
And to top off everything, there was a frenzy
of media activity surrounding the recent blas
phemous statement that obesity might not be
that bad. According to new data from the Na
tional Center for Health Statistics, the oft-cited
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
statistic that obesity kills 4(M),(MX) Americans
each year might be an over-estimate of almost 75
percent. The actual number may be closer to
HX).(XX).
Perhaps this means we've been a little melo
dramatic in our response. Now I'll argue that
lOO.(MX) deaths is still pretty bad. but the new
findings have been enough to spark an ad cam
paign by the Center for Consumer Freedom. The
campaign promotes the food and restaurant in
dustry, which has faced increasing blame for con
tributing to the obesity epidemic.
So which is it? Is obesity the most dangerous
health threat of modern times, or have its effects
been blown out of proportion by the media? And
should I be cutting fats or consuming proteins
while cutting carbs? How exactly am 1 supposed
to know if I'm getting three ounces of fiber? It's
all very confusing.
Sticking to a diet plan is hard enough when we
are sure of what we ought to be doing. How is the
public supposed to lose weight and get healthy
when there are so many conflicting messages
coming from the media, the food industry and
the government? Providing accurate, consistent
and practical nutrition education is the first step
to improving the health status of the American
people.
Until that happens. I at least have a good ex
cuse to keep eating donuts: "Yeah, it probably
isn't good for me, but really, who knows any
more." So if you'll excuse me. 1 believe there is
half a bear claw waiting for me in the fridge.
