# NEED AN ENERGY JOLT?
## Think twice before asking for that Red Bull and vodka 
### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
A flushed bartender slams two ice-filled glasses on the
countertop and pours in a can of Red Bull and shots of
vodka. Twenty-somethings gulp down the energizing
drinks before hitting the dance floor.
Caffeinated mixed drinks such as Red Bull-and-

vodka and rum-and-Coke have become
common in bars, clubs and parties. People
like them fora variety of reasons, including the
unusual taste and the energy buzz they receive

from the caffeine.
"The Red Bull and vodka mix is very popular,"
said Ken Stavn, a bartender at Nola Restaurant and
Bar in downtown Palo Alto. "On a busy night, we'll

get at least 20 to 30
orders. Peo
ple like the

combination be-

cause it gets them a little
pepped up when they are
: drinking. It gets them charged

I up when they are out."
Red Bull contains about 80

milligrams of caf
feine, which is equivalent to about two 12-ounce cans of
Coke or one 6-ounce cup of coffee. Naturally occurring in
foods such as coffee and chocolate, caffeine was added to
Coke products as a replacement for cocaine and is now
common in energy drinks such as Red Bull, Rock Star,
KMX and others.
But senior Joy Chen said she doesn't drink Red Bull and
vodka for the caffeine — she merely likes the taste.
"(Red Bull and vodka] tastes really good — the vodka
makes the Red Bull taste much better," she said.
As it turns out, mixing the two mood-altering drugs of
caffeine and alcohol may turn out to be dose of trouble.
The two drugs act on different ways in the body: While caf
feine is a nervous system stimulant, alcohol is a nervous sys

tem depressant.
"Caffeine masks the depressant effect of alcohol, which
can make people feel like they are less drunk than they real
ly are," Ralph Castro, alcohol and drug educator at the
Vaden Health Center, said.
"A person may have had a
lot of alcohol but will still
feel energetic even if

their blood alcohol level is very high. It can place them in
dangerous situations because they're not getting the normal
behavioral cues that would stop them from continuing to
drink."
Both caffeine and alcohol take about the same amount of
time to metabolize in the body, but if they are taken in dif
ferent ratios, the effects of one drug may be felt more heavi
ly once the other wears off.
"If someone was to have one Red Bull with two or three
shots of vodka, for example, the person would feel fine until
the caffeine wore off and then the alcohol would hit them
like a ton of bricks," Castro said.
The caffeine and alcohol mixture may lead to a higher
rate of dehydration, given alcohol is a diuretic and that caf

feine is suspected to be one as well. Unlike other perfor
mance drinks such as Gatorade or Powerade, Red Bull does
not contain electrolytes, so it does not replenish the impor
tant minerals that are lost during perspiration and from
waste elimination.
Combining the two drugs at once can also place an addi
tional strain on the liver, according to Castro, especially if the

person is also taking other medications such as
oral contraceptives or if the person smokes
cigarettes.
Castro said that as the popularity of the

energy drink-alcohol combination increases, he

is getting more questions about mixing caffeine

and alcohol during his alcohol prevention pro
grams.
"What I'm concerned about is that students often

don't know how much of each drug they are ingesting," he
said. "Your average red cup is about 16 ounces. If you fill
one-fourth of it with alcohol and the rest with Coke or Red
Bull, that's about the equivalent of four mixed drinks. And
they may have two red cups of this mix. This is probably
more than they originally intended to consume, which was
probably one or two drinks max."
Drinking four mixed drinks for women — or five, for
men — constitutes "binge drinking." Castro explained that
about 30 percent of Stanford students had had a binge
drinking episode at least once during their time at Stanford.
"But that is less than the national average, which is about
44 percent," Castro added. "Stanford students are generally
good at regulating their drinking behavior."
