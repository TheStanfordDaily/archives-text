# Say goodbye to those itchy eyes and that runny nose
## 
### PAM SUD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the sunny, dry weather and the burgeoning flow
er buds of spring hit campus, so do the allergy symptoms
that many students know all too well. But to combat the
sneezing, congestion, wheezing and itchy eyes that come
with allergies, there are a few options to consider.
Why the sudden burst in allergenic sources? The
grass pollens of Northern California, the most prevalent
source of allergy in the region, intensify around this time
of year.
"Grass pollens grow during the winter, then when it
dries out by March or April, the grasses dry out and pol
linate," said Richard Moss, professor of pediatrics at the
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital who is an expert in
pulmonary and allergy departments. Now that the grass

pollens have arrived.
Moss said he has begun to
see an avalanche of asth
ma attacks and nasal al
lergies.
Vaden Health Center
sees a surge in allergy-re
lated visits during spring
quarter. According to
Robyn Tepper, the chief
physician of medical ser
vices at Vaden. allergy
was number 12 on their
top 20 diagnoses list in
the fall. Allergies cur
rently occupy the number
five spot.
"Some patients really
feel miserable," Tepper
said. "Their eyes are

J —
itchy, swollen and runny. Sometimes they can't wear
their contacts. Patients with asthma may experience ex
acerbations, because there is a relationship between
asthma and allergies."
There are many measures that students can take to
combat the allergy phenomenon. The first tip from
Vaden is to try the over-the-counter antihistamines like
loratidine, which can be found in products such as Clar
itin and Allarvert. Pseudoephedrine, commonly known
as Sudafed. can help with congestion, but often keeps
people awake at night.
In addition to drugs, there are also simple measures
that students can take to lessen the severity of allergies
in their own dorm room. "First and foremost, it is im
portant to reduce exposure," Moss said.
This can be done by keeping windows closed, using
air conditioning and spending less time outside when the
pollen count is high. Keeping a ventilated room and en
suring that dust-collecting objects like blinds and carpets

are kept clean can often mitigate symptoms.
For grass pollens and dust mite allergies. Moss rec
ommended keeping a small High Efficiency Particulate
Air, or HEPA, filter in the dorm room. The HEPA filter
has a specially designed filter (hat purifies even the
smallest particles from the air.
"If allergies are severe and not controllable by medi
cation, allergy shots should be considered." Tepper said.
"It is not for everyone, but some people really do well
with them."
Allergy shots require a visit to the allergist, who ad
ministers skin tests and determines the appropriate re
sponse to allergies. They also require a commitment to
come in consistently every week for shots.
For students who suffer from severe or chronic aller
gies, there is some hope. Allergies begin to become less
acute when people hit 18 to 22 years of age.
"The most severe is the early teen years," Moss said.
"College is the age where we start to see a decline."
