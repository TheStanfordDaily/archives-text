## Editorial Religious groups must seek more productive dialogue 
### 
Last week, self-described "Muslim dissi
dent" Irshad Manji gave a speech (>n what she
thought were some of the major flaws in Islam
today. ITiis event was co-sponsored by the
Stanford Bookstore, the Institute for Research
on Women and Gender; the Lesbian, Gay, Bi
sexual and Transgender Community Re
st >urces Center, the W< >men's Center, as well as
a number of Jewish organizations on campus;
the Stanford Jewish American Alliance,
Chabad at Stanford, the Jewish Community
Relations C ouncil and I lillel at Stanford.
In general, we could see how a skeptical
examination of religion might promote a
healthy level of religious dialogue on cam
pus. However, we are concerned with the
form that such religious dialogue is current
ly taking. In particular, we fail to see how a
decision by these groups to sponsor an
event criticizing another religion could be
considered tactful or even appropriate.
Their decision was clearly unwise and inju
dicious. and could be interpreted as disre
spectful to Muslims.
What is more disturbing is that Manji's
talk is one event in a long series of pro
grams organized by the Jewish and Muslim
communities that, intentionally or not,
seem designed to provoke controversy.
Earlier this past academic year, the Muslim
community invited a Jewish speaker to
comment on the Arab-Israeli conflict,
while the Jewish community invited a Mus
lim speaker to criticize the flaws in Islam.
Far from creating greater religious aware
ness among the Stanford community,
events like these generate more hostility
between religious groups.
Such hostility has spilled over onto The
Daily's opinion pages. While a certain
amount of debate is healthy, many of the
Op-Eds have had a confrontational tone that
does little to address the problems.
Altercations like these detract from the
kind of religious discourse that we would like

to foster on campus. True religious dialogue
is reasoned and productive; it requires a
great deal of empathy and humility.
We appeal to the better nature of those
involved to behave rationally in this given
situation. As dignified individuals, surely we
could learn to respect other individuals who
might hold differing religious viewpoints
than we do. We must become more aware of
he>w (>ur words and acti<>ns can be seem as in
sensitive or disrespectful.
Amid this controversy, Dean of Religious
Life Scotty McLennan has emerged as a
voice of reason, recognizing that respectful
and productive dialogue does not involve
"playing things out in the press and in Op-
Eds" ("Religious groups plan to meet," April
22). We applaud the role McLennan plays in
building religious community on campus. He
looks well-poised to mediate the conflict be
tween members of the Muslim and Jewish
communities on campus and to get the two
groups to explore more productive lines of
discourse. Future plans fora new Office of
Religious Life structure that will house reli
gious groups — bringing them closer togeth
er physically — also hold promise.
McLennan should also initiate efforts to
develop a common, detailed and enforce
able set of guidelines — beyond the more
general agreement signed by members of
Stanford Associated Religions — that all
religious groups will pledge to follow when
scheduling speakers and events. Campus
religious groups and political groups
scheduling events with a religious compo
nent should always approach Stanford's
Office of Religious Life for advice and
guidance in how to make sure their pro
gramming tactfully and thoughtfully navi
gates these delicate issues. In this way, we
hope that each religious group at Stanford
will he more understanding and respectful
of other faiths and conduct themselves ap
propriately in the future.
