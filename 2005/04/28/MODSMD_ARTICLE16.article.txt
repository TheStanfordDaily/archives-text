# Let it be
## Technology taking over human functions? 
### 
You might think your
job is safe from the on
slaught of technology as
long as you're not a
checkout clerk, farmer
or call center worker.
But I think technology
will take over a good per
centage of the jobs we're
pursuing.
Journalist: This one is

obvious. Jobs in journalism are being elimi
nated not only by syndication and freelanc
ing, but also by newsblogs and other ama
teur-written news. Increasingly, the job and
privilege of journalism are being spread to
society at large.
Doctor: What do doctors do? Although
doctors are more than machines, you could
replace a lot of their functions with pro
grams that stored and updated a huge body
of medical knowledge in order to query pa
tients for their symptoms, order tests, inter
pret the results and prescribe treatments.
Computers obviously surpass people in the
ability to store knowledge. What would take
a doctor several years of medical school and
experience to learn, a computer can "learn"
in the time it takes to download a few pro
grams. Moreover, computers could be pro
grammed to stay abreast of the latest health
news, for example, by searching online —
something many doctors don't find much
time to do. But Internet health news does
more than help doctors — it sometimes re
places them. Already, many people go to
the Internet instead of doctors to find out
what might be wrong with them and what
they can do about it. Computer programs
could read tests more accurately and use
statistical and epidemiological data to pre
scribe the optimal course of treatment.
Actor: Three words: computer generated
graphics. "Monsters, Inc." and "Finding
Nemo" used actors for voices, and comput
er animation for the images. In a technology
called morphing, actors' previously filmed
takes are combined to make new scenes.
Jeremy Rifkin writes in"The End of Work'
that morphing "allows movie and television
producers to isolate, digitize and store every
visual expression, movement and sound of
an actor and then reprogram them in virtu
ally any new combination, effectively creat
ing new roles and performances for the
artist." Anyone up for the next season of "I
Love Lucy?"
Writer: Two weeks ago, some Mi l' grad
uate students got a computer-written paper
accepted to the World Multi-Conference on
Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics.

They wrote the program such that it would
generate "context-free" writing, but it's not
so much harder to generate meaningful text.
Scott French spent $50,000 to develop an ar
tificial intelligence program and used it to
write a romance novel in the style of a best
selling author. The book sold more than
15,(KK) copies in the first printing in IW3.
There's now a prize for the best computer
written novels of more than 70,000 words.
Compared to lots of human writing, the sto
ries are pretty good.
College professor: I include this one be
cause many people reading this column
might be in this job or considering it. I think
video lectures and online courses will chip
away at an already tenuous job market. I
foresee students being "taught" by video
presentations and videotapes of famous
professors (students at all schools could be
taught by Ivy League lecturers). Think of
how we have lectures and section — and re
place the lecturers with videos. That
wouldn't be so different from what we have
now, given that lecturers (as opposed to sec
tion leaders) don't interact much with stu
dents.
Friend: The Japanese robot wakamuru
can housesit, "understand" and interact
with people, and even talk about news it
finds each day on the Internet. The Arthur
and D.W. children's plush toys, when con
nected to a computer, have vocabularies of
10,000 words and can "talk" with children
responding to their gestures (sqeezing).
The range of things that "only people"
can do is getting smaller. You might still
think, "But computers can't invent — they
only can do what they're programmed to
do." However, Stanford's John Koza is
working on "automatic programming," or
getting computers to solve problems they
weren't programmed to solve, by creating
their own programs.
It seems inevitable that computers and
robots will soon be able to carry out a good
percentage of human functions. So what will
people be doing in the future? My hope is
that we'll take care as a society to maintain
fulfilling jobs for our own species, even as we
pass many such jobs to computers and ma
chines. Maybe someday, computers and ma
chines will handle most of the work associat
ed with keeping our species fed. housed and
clothed; and most people — not just the
privileged minority — will get to spend their
lives in creative and investigative pursuits.
