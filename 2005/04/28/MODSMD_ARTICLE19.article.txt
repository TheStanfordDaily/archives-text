# Writing in the margins
## How did I get here? 
### 
The summer before se
nior year, stuck in the mid
dle of downtown Chicago
without any friends and no
computer, 1 sat on my bed
and read. One night I
chose a book by Anne
Fadiman to entertain me.
Literature and its trap
pings have always sur
rounded Fadiman. Her fa

ther was an editor; her mother a journalist.
She grew up having adventures in her father's
study, with its ancient, musky tomes. She and
her husband even read books to each other as
a way of keeping passion in their marriage.
The book was well written and engaging, but
the title frustrates me. She named it "Ex Lib
ris: Confessions of a Common Reader." Fadi
man is anything but a common reader. She's
an extraordinary reader. She lives in a highly
literate world, one of New Yorkers and The
New York Times Book Review, and guest
edits "Best American Essays."
1 am a common reader. I was illiterate until
some point in my sixth year, when 1 became
literate and read voraciously. "Voraciously"
should not be taken literally. I viewed reading
as a status symbol. Occasionally, my new
found literacy led me to open a book and skim
some lines. Then, with great recklessness, 1
would declare that I had read the book. No
one really questioned me about my practices.
And who would? My family doesn't set a
very good example. My mother brashly de
clares that she only reads People Magazine,
and my brother has amassed an impressive
collection of "Cliffs Notes" in his lifetime.
Only my father reads books with any regular
ity. But he reads before he goes to bed — out
of sight, out of mind.
Fadiman would chastise my family. She'd

argue that with hooks on the shelves and no
one demonstrating that reading is enjoyable,
children can't he expected to read. But they
should read. They ought to. My family repre
sents one of those literarily dysfunctional fam
ilies. I come from a truly common literary
world.
Coming to Stanford exacerbated this
feeling. During the first few weeks of school,
I discovered that many of my peers descend
ed from the same literary tree as Fadiman.
The Anne Fadimans of the world had found
me and pushed me into the corner. Their ex
traordinary lives and upbringings had be
come the norm. They told stories about
reading Jane Austen with their families; how
their parents corrected their imperfect
speech. I couldn't chime in with stories from
my past. No one in my family has the proper
knowledge of English required to cure my
broken speech. And we watch more televi
sion than can possibly be good for us.
Learned activities don't form threads in my
past. All I have are tragic adventures with
mud. Legos and anti-social rabbits. 1 never
quite understood how 1 got into Stanford be
fore, but 1 had never felt like such a mistake.
1 don't like living in the margins. I'd like to
think that 1 do belong here, and in the process
of deciding how I fit in, I discovered that Anne
Fadiman is a common reader (with the help of
a really pretentious twist): She's common in
sofar as we are all common. No two people
take the same route to reading. We all take
strange and fantastic journeys as we move to
ward. and away from, books. In the same way,
we are all common Stanford students. No two
people have arrived here from the same road,
and in our differences, we are the same.

Yes, yes. I know I'm heartwarming. Send me
vour praise at sshamban@stanford.edu.
