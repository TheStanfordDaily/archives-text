### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
"Winning is the only thing that
counts," said former Chief Execu
tive Officer and Chairman of Gen
eral Electric Jack Welch last night.
Then he paused, and fora moment,
a packed Memorial Auditorium sat
silent, enthralled by arguably the
most celebrated American business
legend of all time.
Only moments before, Welch
had the entire auditorium booming
with laughter and applause as he re
ferred to certain Microsoft employ

ees as a "pot of duds."
Both serious and lively, Welch
was characteristically direct and
passionate, analyzing contemporary
business issues, answering ques
tions, discussing his new book,
"Winning," and sharing the man
agement strategies that turned GE
from an uncoordinated mammoth
into an agile industry leader.
Welch discussed the importance
and effectiveness of "people build
ing" by placing emphasis on human
resources, using a system for identi

tying and rewarding exemplary per
formers and leading by example.
"The day you become a leader,
managing live, 10,15 people, your 112 u
ture becomes tied to them," Welch
said, touching on the very core of his
management doctrine — the quality
of the members determines the
quality of the team.
"What so many businesses don't
recognize is that the chief human re
sources officer is at least equal if not
more important than the chief finan
cial officer,"he said. "If you're
coaching a baseball or football
team, would you want a bunch of ac
countants hanging around or people
who know how to talk to your play
ers?"
To stimulate performance, man
agers should assess their employees'
work and constantly keep in touch
with the employees to encourage
improvement, Welch added.
"You got grades back in school,
so why not now?" he asked. "Not
having differentiation is the cruelest
thing in a company. People need to
know where they stand."
Welch explained his three-tiered
20-70-10 system. "Stars," the top 20

percent performers, are rewarded
with hefty financial bonuses and
recognition, while "Lemons", the
bottom 10 percent, are replaced.
The middle 70 percent, he said, need
to be told what to do to get into the
top 20 percent.
"Mission and values — define
them clearly," Welch said. "Set the
tone of your company and then ex
hibit the behavior. You can't be
afraid to put it out there."
Welch demonstrated that the
scope of his business doctrine ex
tends from the boardroom to the cu
bicle. He also offered the audience
of mostly Stanford business students
a few points of advice for entry-level
workers.
"There are five clear-cut things in
looking fora job," Welch said.
"First, find people like you — peo
ple who'll laugh at your jokes, peo
ple with the same sensibilities. If
you're a nerd, go hang out with
nerds."
Second, go where there are
smarter people, Welsh said, "where
you can learn and grow."
Welch also encouraged seeking
jobs at brand-name companies and
establishing a presence at the work
place. The final reason for settling
on a job should be a passion for the
work itself.
"Be sure the work turns your
crank," Welch said. "Don't go for an

extra $10. Do it because it really
turns you on. because it really ex
cites you."
In 1981, when Welch became the
youngest man at age 44 to hold the
positions of chief executive officer
and chairman at GE, his name was
already a fixture in business lore.
Some 20 years later, he had made
GE America's "Most Admired
Company" according to Fortune
magazine for four years running be
fore he retired. Welch has also been
known for his ability to successfully
balance work and family.
Welch spoke on the important of
this aspect of his career.
"Work-life balance is something
you earn," Welch said with an inten
sity wrought with decades of experi
ence. "It's an old fashioned chip sys
tem. You make your boss look good,
you put chips in the bag. You take
time off to see your kid's ballet, you
take chips out. If you're a star, if you
deliver, you get flexibility."
It was these insights that many in
the audience appreciated, particu
larly from a leading figure like
Welch.
"The work-life balance keeps
getting brought up in class, but we
just discuss management strate
gies," said Anshuman Bapna, a sec
ond-year student at the Graduate
School of Business. "Managing our
emotions and life choices — you can

only get from hearsay. And who's
more influential than Jack Welch?"
Other business students in the
audience said they liked Welch's
clear and direct approach.
"He gave such candid answers."
said Kaniron Ansari. a first-year
Business School student. "He's a
straight shooter, no beating around
the bush. It's helpful to us and he
covered practical kinds of things
that just made sense."
The event's coordinators said
they were pleased by the over
whelming success. Efe Cakarel, stu
dent organizer for the View From
the Top Speaker Series, said
Welch's talk drew unprecedented
numbers.
"This was the first time we had
Memorial Auditorium, and it was a
full house," Cakarel said. "It shows
the level of excitement and demand
for Jack Welch."
Amy Eirich of Stanford corpo
rate relations said she thought the
speech was especially valuable for
MBA students.
"The speaker series is designed
to bring in top leaders in the indus
try to expose students to formal
leadership thinking," she said.
"Stanford business students will be
future leaders of companies and the
world. The aim is to help them think
ahead and to expose them to the
challenges they'll face."

recognize is that the chief human re
sources officer is at least equal if not
more important than the chief finan
cial officer,"he said. "If you're
coaching a baseball or football
team, would you want a bunch of ac
countants hanging around or people
who know how to talk to your play
ers?"
To stimulate performance, man
agers should assess their employees'
work and constantly keep in touch
with the employees to encourage
improvement, Welch added.
"You got grades back in school,
so why not now?" he asked. "Not
having differentiation is the cruelest
thing in a company. People need to
know where they stand."
Welch explained his three-tiered
20-70-10 system. "Stars," the top 20

percent performers, are rewarded
with hefty financial bonuses and
recognition, while "Lemons", the
bottom 10 percent, are replaced.
The middle 70 percent, he said, need
to be told what to do to get into the
top 20 percent.
"Mission and values — define
them clearly," Welch said. "Set the
tone of your company and then ex
hibit the behavior. You can't be
afraid to put it out there."
Welch demonstrated that the
scope of his business doctrine ex
tends from the boardroom to the cu
bicle. He also offered the audience
of mostly Stanford business students
a few points of advice for entry-level
workers.
"There are five clear-cut things in
looking fora job," Welch said.
"First, find people like you — peo
ple who'll laugh at your jokes, peo
ple with the same sensibilities. If
you're a nerd, go hang out with
nerds."
Second, go where there are
smarter people, Welsh said, "where
you can learn and grow."
Welch also encouraged seeking
jobs at brand-name companies and
establishing a presence at the work
place. The final reason for settling
on a job should be a passion for the
work itself.
"Be sure the work turns your
crank," Welch said. "Don't go for an

extra $10. Do it because it really
turns you on. because it really ex
cites you."
In 1981, when Welch became the
youngest man at age 44 to hold the
positions of chief executive officer
and chairman at GE, his name was
already a fixture in business lore.
Some 20 years later, he had made
GE America's "Most Admired
Company" according to Fortune
magazine for four years running be
fore he retired. Welch has also been
known for his ability to successfully
balance work and family.
Welch spoke on the important of
this aspect of his career.
"Work-life balance is something
you earn," Welch said with an inten
sity wrought with decades of experi
ence. "It's an old fashioned chip sys
tem. You make your boss look good,
you put chips in the bag. You take
time off to see your kid's ballet, you
take chips out. If you're a star, if you
deliver, you get flexibility."
It was these insights that many in
the audience appreciated, particu
larly from a leading figure like
Welch.
"The work-life balance keeps
getting brought up in class, but we
just discuss management strate
gies," said Anshuman Bapna, a sec
ond-year student at the Graduate
School of Business. "Managing our
emotions and life choices — you can

only get from hearsay. And who's
more influential than Jack Welch?"
Other business students in the
audience said they liked Welch's
clear and direct approach.
"He gave such candid answers."
said Kaniron Ansari. a first-year
Business School student. "He's a
straight shooter, no beating around
the bush. It's helpful to us and he
covered practical kinds of things
that just made sense."
The event's coordinators said
they were pleased by the over
whelming success. Efe Cakarel, stu
dent organizer for the View From
the Top Speaker Series, said
Welch's talk drew unprecedented
numbers.
"This was the first time we had
Memorial Auditorium, and it was a
full house," Cakarel said. "It shows
the level of excitement and demand
for Jack Welch."
Amy Eirich of Stanford corpo
rate relations said she thought the
speech was especially valuable for
MBA students.
"The speaker series is designed
to bring in top leaders in the indus
try to expose students to formal
leadership thinking," she said.
"Stanford business students will be
future leaders of companies and the
world. The aim is to help them think
ahead and to expose them to the
challenges they'll face."
