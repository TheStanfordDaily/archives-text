'Confessions of a First Year'
needed School of Education
perspective
Thank you for the feature article, "Con
fessions of a First Year" (April 27). While I
found it both entertaining and informative, I
was sorely disappointed to find no student
represented from the School of Education.
If this article attempted to answer the ques
tion on every senior's mind, "What do I want
to do with my life?" 1 believe it failed to pro
vide a broad perspective of potential career
paths.
As recipients of an elite education, I hope
Stanford students might seriously consider
education as a professional opportunity to
give others the benefits of education that
they, themselves, have already received.

Senior, art history
'Achievers' article came a
a little late
First off, 1 would like to extend a big
"thank you" for running a front-page story
and photo on the Asian American Theater
Project's play, "Achievers" in The Daily ("
'Achievers' shatters stereotypes," April 25).
The cast, crew and I labored three months on
this production.
On that note, I would also like to extend
a candid, half-joking "screw you" for releas
ing this article the day after the performance
closed. We have repeatedly requested cov
erage of our production for over a week
now. Despite our repeated requests to both
the news department and Intermission, 1
was personally told by the writer of
the article that these requests were
handed down over and over again
and that no one wanted to cover us
â€” until a writer reluctantly came in
on Friday and was blown away by
the production.
1 am especially upset when 1 con
sider the fact that both the editor in
chief of The Daily and one of the edi
tors of Intermission are Asian Amer
ican. If students who are Asian
American won't even support us,
then 1 honestly don't know why we
even bother. This article could've eas
ily been written on Tuesday, Wednes
day (dress rehearsals) or Thursday
(opening night) and given us some
much-needed publicity.
We put on four tremendous per
formances for the people who cared
enough to see them and we will con
tinue to put on quality productions in
the future. 1 just hope that someday,
some student publications will actual
ly care enough to recognize us as a
group and help us out.
