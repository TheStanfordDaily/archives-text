## The 						lie of the Stanford Prison Experiment 
### CARLO PRESCOTT 
I read recently in the entertainment indus
try trade journal Variety of Maverick Enter
tainment, the principle of whom is Madonna,
that intends to produce a film based on the
"infamous" Stanford Prison Experiment. 1
read this with considerable consternation.
According to the article, the project's prin
cipal investigator and the film's driving force.
Prof. Philip Zimbardo this "landmark" exper
iment is a classical treatise on the "power of
the situation" and a full-blown explanation of
the evils of every prison from Folsom to Abu
Ghraib. I can assure you. it is neither. 1 say this
not because 1 am an African American ex-con
who served 17 years in San Quentin for at
tempted murder or one who spoke before
Congress on the issue of prison reform. I say it
because I was the Stanford Prison Experi
ment's chief consultant. 1 armed the Zimbar

do, Craig Haney and Curt Banks with the
ideas that enabled them to infuse this study
with the verisimilitude that it hangs its hat on
to this day. And shouldn't.
Regrettably, the gulf between verisimili
tude and real prison life is a huge leap of faith
that still raises serious issues of validity from
the get-go. Nevertheless,ideas such as bags
being placed over the heads of prisoners, in
mates being bound together with chains and
buckets being used in place of toilets in their
cells were all experiences of mine at the old
"Spanish Jail" section of San Quentin and
which I dutifully shared with the Stanford
Prison Experiment braintrust months before
the experiment started. To allege that all
these carefully tested, psychologically solid,
upper-middle-class Caucasian "guards"
dreamed this up on their own is absurd.
How can Zimbardo and, by proxy, Maver
ick Entertainment express horror at the be

havior of the "guards" when they were mere
ly doing what Zimbardo and others, myself in
cluded, encouraged them to do at the outset
or frankly established as ground rules? At the
time, 1 had hoped that I would help create a
valid, intellectually honest indictment of the
prison system.
In hindsight, 1 blew it. I became an unwit
ting accomplice to a theatrical exercise that
conveniently absolves all comers of personal
responsibility for their abominable moral
choices. It seems that Maverick Entertain
ment. riding shotgun with Zimbardo, is re
peating historical folly (and dramatic con
trivance) of the worst kind. And do you hon
estly believe Hollywood will come anywhere
close to honoring or doing right by the field of
psychology in this exercise?
