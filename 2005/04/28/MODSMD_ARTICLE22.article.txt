## The
						Double Clutch Handless coach motivates others 
### 
When offensive lineman Gerrit Wood
went to visit Willamette University in
1995 with the hopes of playing college
football, he was a little nervous about getting in
the coach's car at the airport. And it wasn't just
because he was driving a manual transmission.
The coach, Mark Speckman, was born with
out hands.
Wood says that's the first thing people notice
about Speckman, but they soon learn how special
he would be under any circumstances.
The offensive coordinator when Wood en
rolled, Speckman is now the head coach at
Willamette, where he has accumulated a 41-29
record in seven seasons. Under Speckman, the
Bearcats are 21-14 in the Northwest Conference,
a league that has recently produced two Division
111 national playoff champions (Linfield in 2004

and Pacific Lutheran in 1999).
Speck can do just about ev
erything he needs to get done
— driving, writing, eating,
typing on a computer, stuffing
envelopes. He even played
practice catcher for his broth
er at one time, by holding the
mitt between his arms and his
chest. He made it work, even
if he came home with some
nasty bruises.

The only thing nobody has
seen him do is tie his shoes; everything else just
takes a bit more time.
He hasn't let those extra seconds slow him
down. Speckman began assaulting the offensive
record books upon arrival at Willamette in 1995,
working under Dan Hawkins (now the head
coach at Boise State). Before that, he coached
and taught social studies in high school in Califor
nia for 17 years while also operating a mentoring
program for at-risk youth.
Forced to use flawless technique as a player
because he couldn't grab, he was named Hon
orable Mention All-America as a linebacker at
Azusa Pacific. According to Wood, the coach is
"super competitive" and unbeatable in racquet
ball.
He is also a husband, father and a motivation
al speaker in great demand, having made himself
a success with a positive style that is all his own,
but at the same time irresistibly contagious.
"He's taken lessons from his teaching career,"
current Willamette offensive coordinator Glen
Fowles said. "Practice goes at a brisk pace. Each
session is short, concise, intense and then we
move on."
It's important to keep it focused and not waste
practice time, Fowles said, as Willamette is a top
flight academic school in SalenvOre.
The mantra for the program is "figure it out,"
which Speckman has been doing since his youth
in the Peninsula suburb of Belmont. He was for
tunate to have coaches who wanted him to suc
ceed and who gave him a chance.
1 first heard of Speck when I was on the coach
ing staff at a San Jose high school. My employer
sent me a tape of Speckman lecturing about the
fly series, a decades-old running offense of misdi
rection with multiple backs going every which
way. Speck is considered the foremost contempo
rary expert on the system.
They tell me when it's run right, it's unstop
pable. Division 1-A teams have been known to
run fly-style plays (usually handing off to a re
ceiver in motion), but with so much pressure to
sell tickets with the passing game, few major-col
lege teams would consider committing to it today.
However, the offense has enjoyed remarkable
success in high school and Divisions II and 111 —
including Speckman's 1989 and 1990 Merced
High School teams which both went 14-0.
Because it goes against the grain of "modern"
football philosophy, implementing the fly re
quires a stubborn commitment and some outside
the-box thinking. It's not hard to imagine why
Speckman would be attracted to it.
He shares that creativity with his players.
Wood said that as his class got older, Speckman
trusted them to make their own pre-snap adjust
ments and to advise him on the game plan. This
empowered players and built friendship and loy
alty between the coach and his men.
His ostensible "disability" has become so
transparent to those who know him that only one
person I interviewed explicitly mentioned it with
out my bringing it up first.
Former Pacific Lutheran coach Frosty Wes
tering. a football legend in his own right, echoed
others when he said, "1 don't think you could
even call it a handicap; he's turned it into a
strength."
Frosty said he especially liked Speckman's
compliment about the epic Willamette-PLU
series.
"He told me, Td like to play you every Satur
day.' "
Speck has stayed in close contact with many of
his players, writing recommendations and attend
ing a recent slate of weddings. He reportedly
quipped that wedding gifts for his players were
bankrupting him.
Speckman's whole life is a success story, and
according to Fowles, he doesn't motivate the
team with "Saturday-morning speeches that only
last you two plays." Rather, he teaches a life les
son that keeps players overcoming their own ob
stacles years after they've hung up the cleats — a
lesson that continues to touch and inspire hun
dreds of people, from players and students, to
businessmen and fellow coaches.
Not bad fora guy who can't tie his shoes.
