# No. 3 Cardinal set for MPSF tournament
## 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
The No. 3 women's water polo team's thrilling 9-8 victo
ry at Cal in last Saturday's Big Splash amounted to little
more than a better position in the conference rankings —
and some Bay Area bragging rights.
The stakes will be higher when the Cardinal (18-5, 9-3
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) return to Spieker
Aquatics Complex in Berkeley this weekend. This time, the
Cardinal will be competing fora berth in next month's
NCAA Championships.
A strong showing this weekend is critical to the Cardinal's

effort to reach the national championship tournament.
As the result of major format changes, this year's NCAA
tournament will feature a field of eight teams, rather than
four, from across the nation. Five of the eight teams will be
the winners of their respective conference tournaments.
The three remaining bids will be awarded at-large by the
NCAA Women's Water Polo Committee. The recipients of
these at-large bids will be determined by a number of factors,
including conference tournament performance.
It's highly likely these at-large bids will go to members of
the MPSF — eight of the nation's top 10 teams will compete
at Berkeley this weekend in the MPSF tournament.
The Stanford women finished their regular season sched-

ule with a 9-3 conference record. That mark was bettered
only by top-ranked UCLA (12-0) and No. 2 Southern Cali
fornia (11-1). No. 4 Hawaii finished with an MPSF record
identical to Stanford's, but the Cardinal's 9-5 victory over the
Rainbow Wahine in early February served as the tiebreaker.
Consequently, this weekend's bracket features the Cardinal
seeded third, one spot ahead of Hawaii.
By merit of holding one of the top three tournament
seeds, the Cardinal have a bye for the first day of competi
tion. On Friday afternoon, they will take on the winner of the
first-round matchup between Cal (15-9, 6-6) and San Jose
State (11-16,3-9).
The Cardinal and the Spartans have squared off against
each other three times this season. In all three matches, the
Cardinal won by a margin of at least six goals, but Stanford
will likely face Cal in the second round.
Led by All-American sophomore Elsie Windes (46 goals)
and junior Allison Gold (35 goals), the Bears enter this
weekend's tournament having won three of their last four
decisions. They have also performed well in close contests, as
two of those four victories came in overtime.
The Cardinal met the Bears only once this season, and the
matchup proved to be quite a challenge for the Stanford
women. For the first half of play, the Bears countered every
Stanford goal with one of their own. The two teams went into
the half tied at 4-4, but the Cardinal managed to build a two
goal lead in the third period. The Bears continued their as
sault on the Cardinal defense and twice during the final peri
od managed to bring themselves back within one goal.
Sophomore Katie Hansen put the Cardinal ahead to stay by
netting her third goal of the day with 1:15 remaining.
If the quarterfinal competition proceeds as the national
rankings predict it should, the Cardinal will find themselves
lining up against 2004 national champion USC in the tour
nament semifinal.
Despite losing both times they faced the Women of Troy
this season, the Cardinal put forth an improved performance
in the second meeting. The Stanford defense delivered its
finest effort of the season, shutting down the USC power
play and holding the Women of Troy to their lowest regula
tion goal total of the season. On the offensive end, the Car
dinal tallied five goals against senior goalie Sarah Mix to
force overtime. The two teams held each other scoreless
until USC sophomore Brittany Hayes won it for the Women
of Troy as time expired in the second overtime period.
But the Cardinal know the danger of looking past oppo
nents and are concentrating only on the game at hand, tak
ing things one step at a time. And if all goes well for the Stan
ford women, those steps will lead them to Ann Arbor, Mich.,
and a shot at the NCAA title.
