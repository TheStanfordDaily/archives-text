New records will be set when some of the very best in
track and field gather under the lights this Sunday for the

elite collegiate and Olympic-caliber athletes.
"The Cardinal Invite promises to be an exciting meet,"
men's head coach Robert Weir said.
The Cardinal athletes not competing at the Cardinal In
vite will travel to Philadelphia for the Penn Relays, which
promise to be just as exciting. In the same spirit of the Car
dinal Invite, the Penn Relays will feature current and fu
ture Olympians and high-profile competition.
At this year's Cardinal Invite, the race to witness will be

the world record in the 30k run, and Matt Gonzales, a se
nior at New Mexico who finished sixth in the 5,000-meter
run at Olympic Trials this past summer.
Dobson entered his senior year as one of the best dis
tance runners in the nation. Last season Dobson finished
third at the NCAA championships in the 3,000-meter
steeplechase and competed at the Olympic Trials in the
same race. -

mous names in the track and field world as well. Jen Rhines
of Saint Davids, Penn., an Olympic competitor in the
marathon, holds the fastest mark in the pool of 10,000-
meter competitors.
The women's 1,500-meter run will feature a familiar
name in Stanford history, 2003 graduate Lauren Fleshman.

Fleshman was a 14-time All-American and the NCAA
champion three years in a row in the 5,000-meter run. All-
American status is garnered by finishing in the top eight at
an NCAA Championship race.
Jonathon Riley, another familiar Stanford name, will
compete in the 5,000-meter run. A 2002 graduate, Riley
was a 15-time All-American and three-time NCAA cham
pion. Riley was a 2004 Olympic competitor in the 5,000-
meter run and is just one on a list of former Cardinal ath
letes competing on Sunday who are also Olympians.

On that same list is Gabe Jennings, who will compete in
the 1,500-meter run. Also a 2002 graduate, Jennings ran on
the U.S. Olympic team in Sydney as a sophomore at Stan
ford.
Senior Don Sage will join a field of 1,500-meter runners
that includes Alan Webb, famous for his record-setting
high school indoor and outdoor miles and 1,500-meter
