# Senior Liang nears end of long walk
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In just a few weeks, it will all be
over. For senior Wendra Liang,
hours on the driving range watching
balls fade into the distance and hun
dreds of four-foot putts hitting the
bottom of the cup will recede into
the background of a master's de
gree in anthropological sciences
and preparations for law school.
The game that soaked up her
high school summers in Northern
California and kept her pining for
the spring to thaw the ground at
Phillips Exeter Academy in New
Hampshire; the game that finally
brought the San Francisco native
back home to the sun-splashed
Stanford campus will become noth
ing more than a hobby, a way to
spend a day away from work.
Road trips, practice rounds, late
night talks at the 10-miles-from
nowhere Motel 6? All in the past.
"It's going to be really sad to
leave the team," Liang said. "I'll

miss the girls, I'll miss [coach] Car
oline [O'Connor] â€” a lot. Not only
girls on this team, but just seeing
girls who play for other schools who
I've been playing with since I was 11
or 12."
Such is life for the student-ath
lete "going pro in something other
than sports," as the NCAA's adver
tising campaign puts it.
"It's really weird, because
you've spent so long always looking
to the next year and what you're
going to do differently, from junior
golf to college golf and every year
of college golf," Liang said. "It's
weird looking to next year and not
having a really defined goal, golf
wise."
After 35 events, three top-10 fin
ishes, a tournament victory and
four years at the collegiate level, a
broader perspective on her own
golfing career seems unavoidable.
In a way, golf is nothing but a
long walk, occasionally interrupted

Senior Wendra Liang has hit the course in over 35 events. The only senior on the Stanford women's
golf team, Liang hopes to wrap up her Cardinal career at NCAAs.
