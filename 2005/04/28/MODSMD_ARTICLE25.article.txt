# Senior Liang nears end of long walk
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In just a few weeks, it will all be
over. For senior Wendra Liang,
hours on the driving range watching
balls fade into the distance and hun
dreds of four-foot putts hitting the
bottom of the cup will recede into
the background of a master's de
gree in anthropological sciences
and preparations for law school.
The game that soaked up her
high school summers in Northern
California and kept her pining for
the spring to thaw the ground at
Phillips Exeter Academy in New
Hampshire; the game that finally
brought the San Francisco native
back home to the sun-splashed
Stanford campus will become noth
ing more than a hobby, a way to
spend a day away from work.
Road trips, practice rounds, late
night talks at the 10-miles-from
nowhere Motel 6? All in the past.
"It's going to be really sad to
leave the team," Liang said. "I'll

miss the girls, I'll miss [coach] Car
oline [O'Connor] — a lot. Not only
girls on this team, but just seeing
girls who play for other schools who
I've been playing with since I was 11
or 12."
Such is life for the student-ath
lete "going pro in something other
than sports," as the NCAA's adver
tising campaign puts it.
"It's really weird, because
you've spent so long always looking
to the next year and what you're
going to do differently, from junior
golf to college golf and every year
of college golf," Liang said. "It's
weird looking to next year and not
having a really defined goal, golf
wise."
After 35 events, three top-10 fin
ishes, a tournament victory and
four years at the collegiate level, a
broader perspective on her own
golfing career seems unavoidable.

Senior Wendra Liang has hit the course in over 35 events. The only senior on the Stanford women's
golf team, Liang hopes to wrap up her Cardinal career at NCAAs.
by the hitting of a small white ball.
During her own walk, Liang has
picked up some valuable course
knowledge, growing as both a per
son and player since the day she ar
rived on the Farm with her golf
clubs and some hefty shoes to fill.
"It was hard being the only fresh
man." Liang said. "It was a really
well-established team, and we had
just lost two really high-profile play
ers (All-America selections
Stephanie Keever and Hilary
Homeyer). 1 wasn't as comfortable
with or as assured about myself a
few years ago, which made it harder
when I was trying to find my place in
;C team that was already very close."
Despite the new challenges of
collegiate competition. Liang found
herself playing in nine events that
first season and 11 tournaments in
her sophomore campaign, which in

cluded a win at the Peg Barnard In
vitational at Stanford. An NGC'A
Ail-American Scholar Athlete
award followed shortly after the
season, as Liang prepared to build
on her momentum in her junior
year.
Meanwhile, she was experienc
ing an entirely different sort of vic
tory in her outlook on the game and
her team.
After deciding late in the recruit
ing process to sign with Stanford
over Harvard, Liang's choice paid
immediate dividends as she made a
connection with coach O'Connor,
who is now in her 10th season at the
helm of the women's golf program.
"In junior golf, I used to be real
ly stressed out when I played be
cause I thought that if you weren't
'intense' the whole time, you
weren't taking it seriously." Liang
said. "Caroline has really empha
sized playing for yourself and free
ing yourself up to forget about me
chanics and have fun just playing
golf, which was a difficult mental
hurdle for me."

For someone who swam compet
itively on her high school team and
who traveled to New York with vio
lin in hand to perform at Carnegie
Hall, happiness was a life that didn't
constantly orbit around that little
white ball.
Having survived the trials of her
freshman experience, Liang took
the opportunity to welcome those
trying to find their own niche in the
Stanford family.
"Wendra was welcoming and in
terested in all the freshmen last year
and made a big effort to learn more
about each of us," sophomore
Jenna Seki said. "She had more
than a few funny freshman-year sto
ries to tell as well, so it made us feel
comfortable with her right away."
With the graduation of two se
niors and no arrival of freshmen this
year. Liang began her senior season
leading a team of six. a number
which quickly turned to five with an
injury to junior Stephanie Lue.
Rather than having to compete
in practice for their starting spots,
Stanford's five remaining players

simply played in every event for
much of the year with their team
mate sidelined.
For the senior leader, the pres
sure to perform on a weekly basis
would have been a burden just a
few years ago.
But now? She's all about the sil
ver lining.
"We haven't had to qualify
every single week, so you feel like
you can take more risks in trying
out different shots and trying out
different things in your swing."
Liang said.
As she prepares to wrap up her
career with what she calls the hard
est-working team in her time at
Stanford. Liang's toughest job, fit
tingly enough, may be keeping ev
eryone else relaxed.
"I mostly try to keep every
body's spirits up," Liang said. "My
team makes a lot of fun of me for
being silly. I like keeping things on
the lighthearted side."

long walk, occasionally interrupted

Senior Wendra Liang has hit the course in over 35 events. The only senior on the Stanford women's
golf team, Liang hopes to wrap up her Cardinal career at NCAAs.
by the hitting of a small white ball.
During her own walk, Liang has
picked up some valuable course
knowledge, growing as both a per
son and player since the day she ar
rived on the Farm with her golf
clubs and some hefty shoes to fill.
"It was hard being the only fresh
man." Liang said. "It was a really
well-established team, and we had
just lost two really high-profile play
ers (All-America selections
Stephanie Keever and Hilary
Homeyer). 1 wasn't as comfortable
with or as assured about myself a
few years ago, which made it harder
when I was trying to find my place in
;C team that was already very close."
Despite the new challenges of
collegiate competition. Liang found
herself playing in nine events that
first season and 11 tournaments in
her sophomore campaign, which in

cluded a win at the Peg Barnard In
vitational at Stanford. An NGC'A
Ail-American Scholar Athlete
award followed shortly after the
season, as Liang prepared to build
on her momentum in her junior
year.
Meanwhile, she was experienc
ing an entirely different sort of vic
tory in her outlook on the game and
her team.
After deciding late in the recruit
ing process to sign with Stanford
over Harvard, Liang's choice paid
immediate dividends as she made a
connection with coach O'Connor,
who is now in her 10th season at the
helm of the women's golf program.
"In junior golf, I used to be real
ly stressed out when I played be
cause I thought that if you weren't
'intense' the whole time, you
weren't taking it seriously." Liang
said. "Caroline has really empha
sized playing for yourself and free
ing yourself up to forget about me
chanics and have fun just playing
golf, which was a difficult mental
hurdle for me."

For someone who swam compet
itively on her high school team and
who traveled to New York with vio
lin in hand to perform at Carnegie
Hall, happiness was a life that didn't
constantly orbit around that little
white ball.
Having survived the trials of her
freshman experience, Liang took
the opportunity to welcome those
trying to find their own niche in the
Stanford family.
"Wendra was welcoming and in
terested in all the freshmen last year
and made a big effort to learn more
about each of us," sophomore
Jenna Seki said. "She had more
than a few funny freshman-year sto
ries to tell as well, so it made us feel
comfortable with her right away."
With the graduation of two se
niors and no arrival of freshmen this
year. Liang began her senior season
leading a team of six. a number
which quickly turned to five with an
injury to junior Stephanie Lue.
Rather than having to compete
in practice for their starting spots,
Stanford's five remaining players

simply played in every event for
much of the year with their team
mate sidelined.
For the senior leader, the pres
sure to perform on a weekly basis
would have been a burden just a
few years ago.
But now? She's all about the sil
ver lining.
"We haven't had to qualify
every single week, so you feel like
you can take more risks in trying
out different shots and trying out
different things in your swing."
Liang said.
As she prepares to wrap up her
career with what she calls the hard
est-working team in her time at
Stanford. Liang's toughest job, fit
tingly enough, may be keeping ev
eryone else relaxed.
"I mostly try to keep every
body's spirits up," Liang said. "My
team makes a lot of fun of me for
being silly. I like keeping things on
the lighthearted side."
It will all he over in a few weeks.
Until then, she's just enjoying the
walk.
