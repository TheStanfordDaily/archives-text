## Hordes of ProFros hit up campus 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
With red folders and maps in hand, prospective
freshmen, or ProFros, will flock to campus today for
Admit Weekend. Some ProFros began arriving on
Wednesday, and more than 1,000 ProFros are ex
pected to attend in total, said student coordinator
Caity Rocha, a sophomore.
Eight student organizers were chosen through an
application process to work under the wing of Matt
Sargent, a Stanford alumnus and admissions officer.
This will be Sargent's second year heading up the
event. Sargent and the coordinators have toiled
since last fall to scheme up a combination of activi
ties to convince ProFros to enroll in Stanford.
Although freshmen cannot apply to be student
coordinators, they can take leadership roles in the
dorms as house hosts, or HoHos, and room hosts, or
RoHos, Rocha said.
HoHos prepare dorm programming for the
weekend, student coordinator Lindsay Rand, a
sophomore, said. Most dorm activities feature slide
shows, skits and icebreaker games to help the
ProFros get to know each other.
"The HoHos invest a lot of time in the planning,
especially the head HoHos," she added. "I think a
lot of HoHos get involved because they want the
prospective freshman to see what they see in Stan
ford. The weekend is about making a personal con
nection with the students who visit, and I think a lot
of the volunteers want to share their experiences
