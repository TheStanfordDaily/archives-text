## Hordes of ProFros hit up campus 
### MIMA MOHAMMED STAFF WRITER 
With red folders and maps in hand, prospective
freshmen, or ProFros, will flock to campus today for
Admit Weekend. Some ProFros began arriving on
Wednesday, and more than 1,000 ProFros are ex
pected to attend in total, said student coordinator
Caity Rocha, a sophomore.
Eight student organizers were chosen through an
application process to work under the wing of Matt
Sargent, a Stanford alumnus and admissions officer.
This will be Sargent's second year heading up the
event. Sargent and the coordinators have toiled
since last fall to scheme up a combination of activi
ties to convince ProFros to enroll in Stanford.
Although freshmen cannot apply to be student
coordinators, they can take leadership roles in the
dorms as house hosts, or HoHos, and room hosts, or
RoHos, Rocha said.
HoHos prepare dorm programming for the
weekend, student coordinator Lindsay Rand, a
sophomore, said. Most dorm activities feature slide
shows, skits and icebreaker games to help the
ProFros get to know each other.
"The HoHos invest a lot of time in the planning,
especially the head HoHos," she added. "I think a
lot of HoHos get involved because they want the
prospective freshman to see what they see in Stan
ford. The weekend is about making a personal con
nection with the students who visit, and I think a lot
of the volunteers want to share their experiences
and expertise."
Freshman Charlie Davis, head
HoHo in Ujamaa, said he is looking
forward to the event after all the
work he has done.
"I'm most excited for the check
in just to see a bunch of new faces
and to give the ProFros a good first
impression of Stanford students," he
said.
Sophomore and student coordi
nator Tom Wang said that this year,
many non-freshmen have shown in
terest in helping with Admit Week
end. To give them a chance to par
ticipate, student coordinators creat
ed a new position called a volunteer
core, or VoCo. Upperclassmen who
work as VoCos will help out at regis
tration and various other activities,
Wang said.
ProFros will be able to choose
from a plethora of informative activ
ities throughout the weekend. Rand
added. For instance, they can take
campus tours, learn about financing
their education, visit classes on Fri
day and interact with professors at
Faculty Night Panels. The Haas
Center, Vaden Health Center and
the Cantor Arts Center will wel
come ProFros as visitors.
Rand said that there will be many
parties and fun activities, too.
"The biggest events planned for
the weekend include an activities
fair on Thursday, a University Wel
come and an a capella concert on
Friday and the annual Pro Fro Cele
bration on Saturday night," Rand
said.

Rocha said that the coordinators
and HoHos are particularly excited
about the HoHoPaloozas — parties
planned for today and tomorrow
night that will feature DJs, food and
games like Dance Dance Revolu
tion. The party tonight will be held
on East campus, and the Friday
night party on West campus, but
ProFroscan go to both, regardless of
where they are staying.
All activities and parties will be
alcohol free.
The Admit Weekend alcohol
policy will be strictly enforced start
ing today to ensure that the entire
campus stay dry for the weekend.
Rand added. Breaking the dry-cam
pus policy could result in severe con
sequences.
Although it the weather forecast
predicts that it will rain. Admit
Weekend organizers said they are
not worried that the showers will
negatively affect the ProFros' im
pression of the University,
"It rained the year that I was a
Pro Fro at Admit Weekend, and I
still came," Rand said. "Rain or
shine. Admit Weekend is as much
about getting a feel for student life as
it is a sense of the campus. You can
still tell if you like a place whether
it's raining or not."
Hopefully, the coordinators' pre
dictions wiil prove correct since
many ProFros have high expecta
tions for the weekend.
"I'm looking for an experience
that far exceeds any other college
visit I've had and will leave me want
ing to come back and discover what
only four years can uncover," said
