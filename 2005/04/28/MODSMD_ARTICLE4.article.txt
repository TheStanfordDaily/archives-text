# GSC elects co-chairs to lead next year
## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
"We're going to be co-chairs,"
said first-year law student Jenny
Allen with a smile.
On paper, Allen and Tom Lee,
an engineering graduate student,
were elected chair and deputy
chair, respectively, at last night's

meeting of the Graduate Student
Council, or GSC. In practice, the
two aren't far from finishing each
other's sentences.
"We work really well together."
Lee said. "I can't think of anyone
on the GSC who I'd rather work
with."
Brimming with enough opti
mism to fill the brand-new Gradu

ate Community Center, the two
said they cannot wait to confront
the pressing concerns of graduate
student life.
"Were both going to make a
huge impact on the grad student
community," Allen said.
Lee added, "We're going to
have a good time with this. We look
forward to serving the grad stu

dents at Stanford."
Graduate student life at Stan
ford is far from perfect, however,
and the two acknowledge there's a
lot of work to be done.
"1 think it's pretty well known
that the last election had a pretty
low turnout," Lee said. "It hurts the
grad student voice."
Together, Allen and Lee said
they plan on using their trademark
teamwork to tackle the tough issues.
"We're going to have big
dreams," Allen said. "I always like
to say, 'go big or go home.' "
Lee, expanding on his counter
part's lofty objectives, elaborated.
"Our number one goal is to in
crease student involvement." he
said. Visibility is a challenge. There
are changes that need to be made
that can't be made because not
enough grad students come out [to
vote)."
Lee said that they need to work
to improve graduate housing, ath
letic facilities, club sports and the
experiences of international stu
dents and students with families.

The two said their academic di
versity exemplifies how they will
complement one another perfectly.
In addition, this is Allen's first year
on the Farm while Lee first enrolled
as an undergrad 11 years ago.
"We'll each handle those tasks
and duties that fit our skills the
best," Lee said. "Both of us have
room to grow."
According to Allen, the idea of
co-chairing the GSC began when
GSC leaders first contacted her
about taking the job.
"1 knew it was a job that re
quired two passionate people," she
said. "I didn't want to do it without
Tom Lee."
However, both GSC by-laws
and practical concerns inhibit the
council from having formal co
chairs.
"The person with the actual title
is the person who's going to be the
face of the GSC to the administra
tion and the rest of the University,"
Lee said. "The University needs

some sort of point person to inter
act with."
He added that Allen is more
than up for the job.
"There are some extra duties
she's going to have to do and I think
she's well suited to them," he said.
"I think the graduate community is
getting an incredible person to be
that voice."
The chemistry between the two
was palpable as they sought elec
tion at the meeting, and it was clear
there would be no hard feelings to
ward the eventual victor.
Following Allen's enthusiastic
campaign speech, Lee sighed.
"That's what I get for following
a lawyer," he jokingly lamented.
After the winner was an
nounced, Allen maintained that
both really won the election.
"We're both going to be there
for each other," she said. "We can
delegate, we're productive, and we
can work as a team."
Finding a common ground

among the leadership will not be an
issue in leading the (JSC next year.
Both operate from the same frame
of mind and perspective, they said.
"She's been an incredible en
couragement to me," Lee said.
"Likewise," Allen responded.
For the all-but-official co-chairs,
reading each other's minds, it
seems, is only a matter of time.
Outgoing GSC Chair Moriah
Thomason, a medical student, said she
was pleased with the election's results.
"I'm confident that the future of
the GSC is in capable hands," she said.
In other matters, 13 newly-elect
ed GSC members were on hand to
formally accept their positions on
the council.
The incoming members exer
cised their voting power for the first
time, electing medical student
Stephen Hunt as financial officer
and current Public Relations Offi
cer Donna Winston, an education
graduate student, as programming
coordinator.
