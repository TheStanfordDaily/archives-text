# Tower Clock to tick in time for Admit Weekend

What's big, tall and correct only two times a day?
The Stanford Tower Clock at the corner of Escondi
do and Lasuen Malls, otherwise known as the Inter
section of Death. In case you haven't noticed the ab
sence of chimes every fifteen minutes, the Tower
Clock has been out of service for almost two months.
At the end of February, Stanford Facilities Oper
ations discovered a leak in the roof of the Tower
Clock and promptly turned the clock off as a precau
tionary measure during repairs.
Adding to the concern about the Tower Clock
was the discovery of water coming in from the foun
dation. When the moisture problems dried up, the
clock mysteriously would not start.
Stanford facilities representatives said they want
ed to fix the clock by Community Day, but that dead
line came and went. Now, they hope to have the
clock functioning in time for the Admit Weekend
festivities, which begin tomorrow.
Karen Frey, administrator of Facilities and Oper
ations, said she is optimistic about this deadline.
"Kevin Binkert, our clock expert, was here as
planned on Tuesday," Frey said. "The
bushings and fly wheel were worn so
he hopes to refurbish them Wednes
day and bring them back Thursday or
Friday to reassemble the clock and
have it working."
Frey said Binkert hopes that the
existing tly wheel will not need to be
replaced.
Some Stanford students have ex
pressed disappointment regarding

the troubled timepiece.
"1 definitely used it on a daily basis
when it worked but since it hasn't
been working, I do not trust it," said
freshman Claire Werneke.
Other students haven't been too
disgruntled by the Tower ('lock crisis.
"It would be nice if it worked but I
don't mind that much because I have
a watch,"
said senior Albert Chan.
Hut watch-clad or not, most stu
dents who were asked agreed that the
Stanford campus has lost a certain
ring to it without the Tower Clock ac
curately marking their time on the
Farm.
