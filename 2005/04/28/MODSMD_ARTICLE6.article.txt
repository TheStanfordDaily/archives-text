# House leaders evaluate party scene
## 
### ANDREW SCHNEIDER 
Fall quarter started with a bang. Every
Thursday, the Sigma Chi Penthouse dance
floor was filled, and fraternity and Row
houses threw parties on Friday and Satur
day nights. The party scene continued for
several weeks after winter break, but quick
ly ran out of steam. Now. midway through
spring quarter, there has been only one solid
weekend of parties. Is this just an off-year?
Junior Brian Goodman, president of

Theta Delt, said he docs not think that the
fraternity party scene has been waning.
'it feels like the fratsare doing their part
in throwing parties," Goodman said,
adding that he thinks the Row houses are
failing to supplement fraternity efforts by
filling in on nights when Greek houses are
unable to throw their usual shindigs.
"In previous years, there was a separate
scene in the Row houses that we went to
every weekend," Goodman said.
Senior Marc Whitaker. social manager

at Bob, said he does not blame Row houses
for the apparent lack of parties. Rather, he
holds student groups and un-housed frats
accountable for the drought in all-campus
clambakes.
"Not that many groups have come up to
talk to us about throwing parties this year,"
Whitaker said.
More groups usually pay to host parties
in Row houses, and Whitaker implied that
these party-partnerships are benefi
cial for both the groups and houses in
volved.
"It doesn't really make that much
sense for Row houses to throw their
own parties because it costs a lot of
money," Whitaker said. "Generally,
Row house staff and residents loan
their space to other groups because it's
cheaper for the houses and fun for
everybody."
Whitaker said that the difference in
the quantity of Row-house parties

from year to year often depends 011 the
houses' residents. The character of a
house changes with each group that
draws into it.
"In past years, it's just been about
certain groups wanting to throw par
ties," Whitaker said.
Although complaints about the
lack of weekend parties have been
floating around campus this year, Joey
Greenwell, assistant director at the
Office of Student Activities, said that
the number of registered parties has
actually increased over the past five
years. He said he estimated that the
number of registered parties on cam
pus this year matched, and perhaps ex
ceeded. last year's total.
Sophomore Tyler Bennett said the

perceived damper on the campus
scene can be attributed in part to the
fact that students simply tire of parties'
repetitive nature. 1 le added that he at
tended many more fraternity parties
as a freshman than he does now.
"Everybody's generally drunk, so
it's pretty much impossible to meet
any new people, which is what most of
us are looking to do," he said.
Rather than the party scene, Ben
nett said he prefers a "more chill, less
plastered and dark atmosphere."
(ioodman echoed this sentiment.
" The party scene with upperclass
mcn is pushed to small groups as op
posed to big, campus-wide parties,
which fiats throw more as a service to
Stanford than for their own pleasure."
