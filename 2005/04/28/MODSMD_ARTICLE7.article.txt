# Excavation inspires art

### EMMA VAUGHN DESK EDITOR 
A new psychedelic art movement, termed
"Jokes for Birds," has arrived on campus.
It can he seen on the front lawn of the Theta
Delta Chi fraternity house, which has been
transformed into an installation project featur
ing hanging bicycle mobiles, shopping carts,
Starbucks cups and whatever else the residents
can find to string up.
"We're pretty sure that it will spread all over
the world," Lidow said. "The whole school
should soon become one huge art installation."
The impetus behind the piece came from the
recent discovery of the legendary Theta Delt mo
torcycle, which was dug up from the house's vol
leyball court two weeks ago by seniors Will

Rothacker and John Rote. The bike has been part
of the fraternity's mythology for more than a
decade.
"There has always been this story that an old
Theta Delt buried a motorcycle in the volleyball
court and people have kind of half believed it,"
senior Nicholai Lidow said. "Two years ago a
guy went looking for it with a metal detector but
found nothing so we figured it didn't exist. Now
that we've found it, it's caused a lot of excite
ment." Lidow and others have been working
with Mullen on setting up the display.
Theta Delt residents immediately began
brainstorming ways to celebrate the finding. At
the suggestion of hanging the unearthed vehicle,
Mullen decided to make it the centerpiece of his

art installation.
"We've started painting it, and
we're going to hang it on the roadside
part of the exhibit when its done,"
Mullen said.
The motorcycle, which dates back
to I WO. is an appropriate fit with the
transportation theme of the project.
Other wheeled objects strung up so
far include a plastic St. Joseph that
sits in a shopping cart filled with beer
bottles. On one branch there is a
small buggy designed by sophomore

Britton Caillouette, made up of a
plastic seat attached to a gold table
and a red bicycle wheel. Every item is
composed of multiple objects molded
together into original shapes.
"Words are really inadequate,"
Lidow said. "It's not something you
can describe. Everything is a combi
nation of so many other things."
Although most of the materials
have been found or donated from dif
ferent areas of campus, the project is
still in need of funds for essential sup
plies, including paint and rope.
"We need rich, wealthy, hot ma
trons," Mullen said jokingly. "If there
are any art-loving sugar mamas out
there, please give me a call."
Most of the students on campus

seem to embrace the exhibit's creativi
ty-
"lt really is awesome to drive by
and see it," sophomore Heidi
Moseson said. "They've put all
these random objects together in a
really incredible display. It gives off
this impression of both chaos and
order, and you can't help but just
stare at it."
The residents of Thcta Delt said
that they hope more people will join in
the project by helping in its actual con
struction or by donating new parts.
"We want people to add their cre
ativity in whatever way they can,"
Lidow said. "Or they should start their
own node at another place on campus.
Let the Revolution beuin."
