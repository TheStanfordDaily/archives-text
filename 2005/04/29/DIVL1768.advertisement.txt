Help is on the way
It is becoming ever clearer that the
momentum of change is growing steadily
throughout the world. Event follows so
quickly on event that few can discern the
logic of the sequence by which the new
supplants the old. We, your Elder Brothers,
recognize the inevitability of this process and
watch it with satisfaction, knowing, as We
do, that all is moving towards the more
perfect expression of the Plan.
For men, however, this is a time of testing
and trouble as they seek to understand and
cope with the effects of their actions. The
logic of happenings escapes them and
makes them doubt the divinity in which they
place their trust. Thus, for men, has it always
been, as they struggle blindly to enforce
their will or to escape the consequence of
their endeavors.
As we move from age to age, such periods
of tension and indecision are repeated again
and again. Each new age brings into the
world new and unfamiliar forces which
gradually impose themselves on men and
invoke response. Thus it is today, as men
search dimly for the new direction which the
new age energies demand of them. Some
there are who sense the way and seek to
educate their brothers in the required action.
Many, though, are afraid of change and see
only an impending chaos and breakdown if
the 'radicals' have their way.

"... the momentum of change is growing
steadily throughout the world."
Into this divided world has come the Christ.
His is the task to reconcile these disparate
groups and to bring order out of the present
confusion and tumult. That His is not an easy
task should be apparent to all. That the gulf
between the groups is vast and entrenched
is equally clear. How, then, must He work to
bridge the chasm between the old and
fearful and the burgeoning new? How, too,
can He counter the deep materialism which
is the hallmark of the present time? How
deal with the intolerance of the religious
groups and help them to experience unity?
Presenting Himself as a man among men,
Maitreya will make no claims, demand no
allegiance. Simple and direct will be His
approach, moderate and calm His manner.
His clarity of mind will arrest attention. His
wisdom will overcome men's fears. His
sincerity of utterance will melt men's hearts
and remove the burden of hate and greed.
Thus will men experience a new appearance
of divinity, one which includes them in its man
ifestation, and sees no distance or separation.
As the Embodiment and Agent of cosmic
power and love, Maitreya will open the
hearts of all who can respond, and, turning
men from the fear and division of the past,
ready them for the glory of the future.
