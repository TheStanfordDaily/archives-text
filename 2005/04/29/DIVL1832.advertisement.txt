The 2005 Commencement Issue will be
distributed over Commencement Weekend
to all graduates, faculty, staff, students,
parents and visitors around campus —throughout all
three days of graduation! This issue will highlight
the events of the past four years and is often kept
by seniors as a reminder of their Stanford
graduation. Don't miss this opportunity to
congratulate your graduate on his or her success
and hard work!
You may design your Congratulations Ad personally
or leave it up to us. You may include a photograph of
your graduate fora special added touch!
Typesetting and layout are included in our low price.
Albo,
We are so proud of you!
If your accolades we.re
words, they'd fill several
Dickens novels.
Good luck in P.C.I
—Jamail and suril
