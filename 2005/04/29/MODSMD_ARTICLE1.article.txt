## Hennesst launches $94M international initiative 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is about to take a giant step toward fulfill
ing University President John Hennessy's vision of a
"global university."
Hennessy announced yesterday that Stanford has
raised $94 million dollars in gifts fora new multi-disci
plinary program focused on international studies.
This international initiative is the latest in a series of
large-scale interdisciplinary projects to be launched,
and Hennessy told The Daily that it should also further
Stanford's efforts to broaden its global presence and
reputation.
The most generous gift came from Stanford alumni
Bradford Freeman and Ronald Spogli, founding part
ners of the Los Angeles-based investment firm Free
man Spogli & Co., who together donated $50 million to
ward the initiative.
The money will be used to create up to 10 interdisci
plinary professorships and to endow the directorship of
the Stanford Institute for International Studies, or SIIS.
It will also support the work of the institute's centers
and programs and, together with funds from the Office
of the President, serve as seed money to support com
petitive interdisciplinary research grants. The current
director of SI IS is Political Science Prof. Coit D. Black-
er.
The gift is the largest ever to be
received by an international studies
program at Stanford, according to
Klas Bergman, associate director for
communications at SI IS.
The Stanford News Service re
ported that the initiative will tackle
three broad themes: "pursuing
peace and security in an insecure
world; reforming and improving
governance at all levels of society;
and advancing human health and
well being."
Stanford is uniquely situated to
approach some of the most stubborn
issues in global politics today. Hen

nessy said in an interview with The
Daily.
"The scope and challenge of in
ternational problems around the
world have grown more acute," he
said. "Universities could be one of
the most important sources of solu
tions."
In their current state, SIIS and
its research centers, including the
Center for International Security
and Cooperation, or CISAC, have
been conducting research in areas
like homeland security and risk
management. Bergman said this re
search would take on a "Universi
ty-wide dimension" under the new
initiative.
For instance, Bergman said he
envisioned a collaborative effort be
tween SIIS and the Medical School
to research defense against biologi
cal attacks and the spread of infec

tious diseases, including the African
AIDS epidemic.
SIIS is currently located in Encina
Hall, which is also the site of the Po
litical Science Department. Bergman
said that, with funds provided by the
initiative, the "master plan" down
the road will be to make changes to
Encina to better outfit the building as
a hub for international studies.
According to Bergman, the first
serious plans for the initiative began
last spring when Hennessy appoint
ed Blacker and Engineering Prof.
Elisabeth Pate-Cornell to chair the
Faculty Steering Committee.
In the past several years, the Uni
versity has launched two other major
multidisciplinary initiatives, Bio-X
program in the James H. Clark Cen
ter and the Environmental Initiative.
Bergman added that another
multidisciplinary project focused on

the arts is in the pipeline but that
more specifics are not available.
Over the past year, Hennessy has
made publicized visits to India and
China, and the University has also
prioritized the opening of one or two
new overseas campuses in addition to
the recently-opened site in Beijing.
Hennessy said that some of the
money for the new initiative will be
used for scholarships to bring more
international students to campus.
Funding for these scholarships will
be supported by alumni Craig and
Susan M<;Caw.
Bergman said the hope is to even
tually extend need-blind financial
aid, which is currently available only
to American students, to interna
tional students.
Right now, international students
who cannot meet tuition costs on
their own "basically have to

scrounge around for money, look for
loans, find some money in their
home country," Bergman added.
Both of the lead donors are al
ready heavily involved in University
affairs. Freeman is a member of the
Stanford Board of Trustees, and
Spogli is a member of the board of
visitors at SIIS.
The other $44 million in funding
came from various sources, includ
ing an anonymous gift to the Gradu
ate School of Business to support its
Center for Global Business and the
Economy; a donation from Susan
Ford Dorsey, who has served on the
Haas Center's national advisory
board since 2001, to enhance the
master's program in international
policy studies; and a contribution
from San Francisco philanthropist
Walter Shorenstein to endow the
Asia Pacific Research Center.
