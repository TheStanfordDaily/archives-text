### SAMUEL CHEN STAFF WRITER 
After three trying days of compe
tition against the nation's best in col
legiate swimming, the No. 3 Stan
ford men's swimming and diving
team (6-1. 3-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) concluded its season at the
2005 NCAA Division I Men's Swim
ming and Diving Championships,
held from March 24 to 26.
With 36 teams scoring points, the
Cardinal came in second in the final
team standings with 414 points,
falling behind only the defending
champion No. 2 Auburn Tigers, who
finished with 491 points. This was a
repeat of the 1-2 finish that occurred

at the 2004 meet. At the competi
tion. held at the University of Min
nesota in Minneapolis, the Cardinal
team proved that they had what it
takes to compete and succeed with
the best, despite losing a strong se
nior class following last season's sec
ond-place finish.
"Fans, swimming journalists and
our competitor teams all severely
underestimated us all year and so we
were out to prove ourselves and earn
respect all season," said sophomore
Shaun Phillips, who competed in the
200-yard, 500-yard, and 1650-yard
freestyle events, as well as the 800-
yard freestyle relay.
On the first day of competition,
it was obvious that it would be the

competition in the field - not the
record books - that would set the
pace for the events of the meet. In
the first event, both California and
Auburn broke NCAA and Ameri
can records in the 200-yard
freestyle relay, with Cal finishing on
top with a blistering time of 1:15.78.
Stanford touched the wall fourth in
the event, with the quartet of
sophomores Ben Wildman-To
briner, Kyle Ransom, Matt Crowe
and senior Jayme Cramer clocking
a 1:17.46. In the following 500-yard
freestyle event, the top Stanford
performer was Phillips, who came
in fifth in another field whose top

finisher, Michigan's Peter Van
derkaay, broke a pool record, com
ing in nearly five seconds ahead of
his nearest competitor. In the third
event, the 200-yard individual med
ley. Stanford junior Tobias Oriwol
finished seventh in the finals, with a
time of 1:46.66. while first-place fin
isher Florida junior Ryan Lochte,
broke NCAA and American
records in the event.
The trend only continued as the
50-yard freestyle sprint ap
proached. in which Auburn senior
Fred Bousquet and Cal senior Duje
Draganja both broke NCAA and
American records of 19.05 in their
swims, with Bousquet finishing at
18.90 in the finals.
In the sixth and final event,
Stanford finally pulled it together
to win the 400-yard medley relay

with the quartet of seniors Gary
Marshall, Jayme Cramer and Matt
McDonald and sophomore Wild
man-Tobriner taking a come-from
behind win to set a pool record of
3:06.45 by over two seconds. At the
end of the day, Stanford was in
fourth, following Auburn, Arizona
and Cal.
On the second day of competi
tion, the Cardinal's performance
propelled them into the second spot.
In the 100-yard breaststroke,
Marshall finished his collegiate ca
reer with the Cardinal's second top
finish of the meet, touching the wall
at 52.68. In the 1 (K)-yard backstroke,
Cramer and sophomore Hongzhe
Sun tied for fourth with 46.55, be
coming the last two swimmers to fin
ish within a second of victorious
Northwestern sophomore Matt
Grevers.
