# Water polo falls to UCLA in OT
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR STAFF WRITER 
It seemed as if the championship
matchup between No. 2 Stanford and
top-ranked UCLA would never end.
But after a regulation and an over
time battle, the clock ran down too
fast for the Cardinal to score just once
more. And now, one month later, the
NCAA trophy belongs to the Bruins.
When a shot from UCLA's Josh
Hewko bounced off the top bar,
teammate Logan Powell was there
for one more play.
"We had three players ejected
and I was the next guy in line to
play," Powell said. "I was in the right
place at the right time."
With 13 seconds left in overtime
play, Powell's shot got tipped,
touched a couple hands and ulti
mately managed to go in to give
UCLA a 10-9 win.
A stunned Cardinal team had to
watch its opponent celebrate a nation
al championship at Stanford's home
pool for the second year in a row.
One night after defeating Loy
ola Marymount, Stanford faced
UCLA for the fifth time this sea
son. With the season series split,
and a crowd of 3,044 on hand, the
NCAA final was the perfect stage
for one last match.
Stanford took the lead in the first
period, 3-2, but by the end of the half
the Bruins had come back to post a 4-
5 goal advantage. Their one-goal lead
held up through the end of the third.
While there was plenty back
and-forth action the first three peri

ods, the match really heated up in
the fourth.
UCLA's 2(X)4 Olympian Brett
Ormsby opened up the final quarter
with a goal but junior driver Peter
Vare lias pulled the Cardinal within one.
Azevedo finally posted his first
and only goal of the night to tie the
game at 7-7, but regulation time ran
out before either team could notch a
game-winner.
As the players lined up for over
time, the Cardinal urged the boister
ous crowd to make noise.
With the support of the spectators,
the Stanford squad took advantage of
the absence of three Bruin players
who had fouled out â€” Jacobs, Chris
Pulido and Albert Garcia, who scored
twice in the match. A shot by Hopkins
skipped in for the lead. Ormsby, how
ever, followed up with his second goal
and the match was tied again.
With 1:54 in the second period of
overtime, Hopkins passed across the
pool to Varellas, who shot the ball
cross-cage for his third goal.
The Bruins answered less than a
minute later to tie it up again at 9-9.
The Bruins' game plan seemed to
be to doubte or triple-team Azeve
do. But even when left alone
though, the three-time Player of the
Year struggled with his shots.
"The ball wouldn't go in the goal
today." Azevedo said. "A lot of my
shots weren't going where I wanted
them to go."
