# Women fail to qualify for Nationals but are optimistic about future
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"I can't wait for next year" was like
ly the thought running through the
head of every Stanford gymnast after
the No. 16 Cardinal (4-8,4-3 Pacific-10
Conference) failed to qualify to
NCAA Nationals this past weekend.
The team needed to place second
at the West Regional on Saturday in
order to qualify, but it placed fourth
with a 194.75 behind No. 2 UCLA,
No. 11 Penn State and No. 24 Wash
ington. With help from its three
Olympians, UCLA finished well
ahead of the pack with a 197.025.
Only 0.625, however, separated the
Cardinal from second place and
what would have been a five-year
streak of qualifying to Nationals.
"The beauty of it. though, is that
the entire squad returns next year
and three great incoming freshmen
have signed letters of intent," head
coach Kristen Smyth said. "We'll get
this team healthy and the future
looks very bright."
The future of this season still
looks bright for Tabitha Yim, one of
the team's six freshmen. The fourth
place finisher at Olympic trials se
cured herself an individual bid to
compete in the All-Around at Na
tionals in Alabama from April 21 to
23. She earned her spot by having
one of the top two All-Around
scores excluding those posted by
gymnasts on qualifying teams.
Yim scored a 39.25 in her debut as
an All-Around competitor for the
Cardinal, putting her in fifth place at
Regionals behind competitors from
UCLA and Penn State. She will
enter Nationals as the top-seeded in

dividual qualifier and has a good
chance to make a mark on the podi
um on beam and bars.
"It was unbelievable to see Tab
perform as well as she did in her first
time competing All-Around in col
lege," Smyth said. "Her comeback
[from a pre-season injury) was abso
lutely inspiring."
At the beginning of the season,
however, no one would have guessed
that Yim would be competing alone
at Nationals. With a preseason rank
of No. 3, a third-place finish at Na
tionals last year, and two freshmen
coming off top-10 finishes at Olympic
trials, the team's sights were set on a
national championship. The thought
of failing to qualify for nationals was
hardly on the radar screen.
Injuries changed all that.
Freshmen Liz Tricase and
Stephanie Gentry, along with junior
Ail-American Glyn Sweets, three of
the team's best competitors, stood on
the sidelines at Regionals due to re
spective ankle, toe and foot injures.
Their presence was particularly
missed on the vault. Stanford's weak
est event of the evening. With only
three of six vaults having the requi
site difficulty to start from a 10, Stan
ford posted a mere 48.225. The score
just edged out last-place finisher, No.
14 Central Michigan, and was over a
point behind second-place finisher
Penn State. Although the Cardinal
outscored Penn State on every other
event, they could not make up the
deficit incurred on vault.
The team returned to the gym
yesterday. They will practice along
side Yim for the next two weeks be
fore taking two weeks off and then
starting training once more.

"We're starting our quest for next
year's Nationals right now." Smyth
said.
