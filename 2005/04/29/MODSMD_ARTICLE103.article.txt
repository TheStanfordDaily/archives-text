Oh, the things that could have been.
The Stanford football team took a stunning,
28-17 halftime lead against top-ranked South
ern California Saturday at Stanford Stadium
but came up tantalizingly short in the end, los
ing to the defending national champions, 31-28.
It was an impressive evening, all in all, for
the Cardinal, who entered the game a 22-point
underdog and fell behind 10-0 in the first quar
ter. But the tears in the eyes of the Stanford
players and the head coach's steely gaze
showed that the Cardinal were not content
with a moral victory.
"I want them to be real disappointed with
the loss," head coach Buddy Teevens said.
"We had an opportunity to beat a real good
football team, and we lost."
Nonetheless, the Cardinal pushed the Tro
jans (4-0,1-0 Pacific-10 Conference) all over the
football field for the last 20 minutes of the first
half, outscoring them 28-7 over that stretch. The
Cardinal (2-1,0-1) outclassed the most-respect -
ed team in the nation, running up the score
thanks to smarts, skill and determination.
"We played really well fora quarter-and-a
half," said quarterback Trent Edwards, who com
pleted 20-of-26 passes before the break. "But a
football game isn't a quarter-and-a-half long."

Stanford kept Heisman Trophy candidate Reggie Bush and top-ranked (JSC in check for one half, but the
Trojans rallied from a 28-17 halftime deficit and won 31-28 en route to another national title.
by J.R. Lemon's gritty 82-yard
touchdown run as time expired at
the end of the first half. The tailback
ran a routine play into the line, the
kind of rush that both teams, 55,750
fans and a national TV audience all
expected to result in five yards and
the end of the half.
At halftime, Teevens told the
team "that [the Trojans] were gonna
come out and play." he said. "They're
a great football team and they have a
lot of pride. We were gonna have to
play harder in the second half."
Stanford tried, but so did (JSC,
which played a more inspired brand
of football in forcing four punts and
a turnover on downs.
"We didn't make too many ad
justments at halftime. it's just that we
came out a little Hat in the first half,"
said Leinart, who was 24-of-30 pass
ing for 308 yards. "We know we're a
second-half team, and you can never

win a game in the first half."
A 51-yard pass from Leinart to
Smith, who finished with eight
catches for 153 yards, set up a 1-yard
touchdown run by Leinart, which
brought USC within four points 12
minutes into the third.
Ryan Killeen prolonged the ex
citement by missing a 23-yard field
goal after Stanford's defense made
an inspired stand deep in its own ter
ritory. but with six minutes to play, a
33-yard punt return by Bush set up a
3-yard touchdown run by LenDale
White that completed the scoring.
Stanford would record just its sec
ond first down of the half on its last
possession, but on the next series,
Edwards' fourth-down pass was just
out of Smith's reach and the Trojans
were able to run out the clock.
"Deep in our hearts, we know we
could have beaten this team and
have beaten this team," Lemon said.
"That hurts more than anything."
