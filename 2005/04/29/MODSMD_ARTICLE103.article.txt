Oh, the things that could have been.
The Stanford football team took a stunning,
28-17 halftime lead against top-ranked South
ern California Saturday at Stanford Stadium
but came up tantalizingly short in the end, los
ing to the defending national champions, 31-28.
It was an impressive evening, all in all, for
the Cardinal, who entered the game a 22-point
underdog and fell behind 10-0 in the first quar
ter. But the tears in the eyes of the Stanford
players and the head coach's steely gaze
showed that the Cardinal were not content
with a moral victory.
"I want them to be real disappointed with
the loss," head coach Buddy Teevens said.
"We had an opportunity to beat a real good
football team, and we lost."
Nonetheless, the Cardinal pushed the Tro
jans (4-0,1-0 Pacific-10 Conference) all over the
football field for the last 20 minutes of the first
half, outscoring them 28-7 over that stretch. The
Cardinal (2-1,0-1) outclassed the most-respect -
ed team in the nation, running up the score
thanks to smarts, skill and determination.
"We played really well fora quarter-and-a
half," said quarterback Trent Edwards, who com
pleted 20-of-26 passes before the break. "But a
football game isn't a quarter-and-a-half long."
The Cardinal's impressive half was capped
