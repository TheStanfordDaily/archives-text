top spot in every finals competition, tak
ing at least two of the top three scores in ill I
but one event.

best and the meet wasn't over until it
was truly over."
On Friday, the Cardinal Ux)k the top

tour spots in both the A elements and B
figures events, with impressive scores
coming from all classes. Katie Norris
