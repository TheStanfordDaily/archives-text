# Gentry and Kharbush fall short of title goals at NCAAs
## 
### BLAIR CRITCHLOW STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford wrestling team's
two star competitors, co-captains
Matt Gentry and Imad Kharbush,
fought hard hut fell short of their ul
timate goals of individual national
titles in St. Louis over a week ago.
Despite going down in the tourna
ment, both wrestlers can look back
on great seasons for the Cardinal (6-
7-1, 2-5-2 Pacific-10 Conference),
and for Gentry, a senior, a great col
legiate career.
After a first-round bye, the 174-
pound Kharbush won his first match
in a 4-1 decision over Eastern Illi
nois' Kenny Robertson. The junior
continued with a 16-7 drubbing of
Northwestern's Jake Herbert in his
next bout.
The fourth round would be the
beginning of the end as Kharbush
fell 15-4 to Cornell's Joe Mazzurco.
In the consolation bracket, Khar
bush dropped a razor-thin 3-2 deci
sion to Mitch Hancock of Central
Michigan. That loss eliminated
Kharbush from competition and
dropped him to honorable mention
All-American status.
"All in all, it was bittersweet,"
Kharbush said. "It definitely did a lot
for my confidence. The tournament
showed me that I'm at a level I need
to be at to be a national champion.
Obviously though, it was really disap
pointing to lose to a lower seed in my
third match. It was even more disap
pointing in my fourth match to lose a
shot at being an All-American."
Gentry began his title defense at
an amazing pace. After his own first
round bye, the third seed put on
back-to-back clinics, earning 15-0
technical falls against Danny Clum
of Wyoming in five minutes and
then Matt Hill of Edinboro in three
minutes and 29 seconds.
On the second day of competi

tion, Gentry was matched up against
sixth-seeded Trent Paulson of lowa
State, who he defeated at the Mid
lands Tournament earlier this sea
son. Both 157 pounders battled hard
to a 6-6 tie at the end of regulation. In
overtime, Paulson was able to secure
the upset by scoring a takedown fora
sudden victory decision, 8-6.
The painfully close defeat ended
the senior's quest at repeating as na
tional champion, and Gentry entered
the consolation bracket to face sev
enth-seeded Matt Lebe of West Vir
ginia. With the bout deadlocked at
three, Lebe scored a takedown fora
5-3 sudden victory decision.
"On the first day I was wrestling
really well and I won my first two
matches 15-0, which is a technical
fall, and that doesn't happen very
often in the NCAAs, so I was
happy," Gentry said. "On the sec
ond day, I just had an off day. I wres
tled two guys who I had beaten be
fore, and I lost to them in overtime.
I didn't wrestle my best, and to win
the NCAAs you need to wrestle at
your best."
Gentry ended his collegiate ca
reer short of where he wished, but
the 157 pounder will remain a Cardi
nal wrestling legend. Gentry holds
the school's all-time and consecutive
wins records and remains Stanford's
only wrestling national champion.
"I guess some career highlights
would be obviously winning a na
tional title, and being Pac-10 champi
on and Pac-10 wrestler of the year
last year," Gentry said. "But other
highlights would be the fight. It's
winning the close matches, [or] fight
ing in the tough matches and pulling
it out. I guess I would want my lega
cy to be someone who worked hard
and was exciting to watch."
