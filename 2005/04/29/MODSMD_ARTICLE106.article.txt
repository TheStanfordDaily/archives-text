# Lacrosse earns two wins at home
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON STAFF WRITER 
Spectacular individual perfor
mances propelled the women's
lacrosse squad to two hard-fought vic
tories in its last two home contests of
the season. On Friday, a last-minute
game-winning goal from junior at
tacker Sarah Bach allowed the Cardi
nal to squeak by Yale, 9-8. Against
Denver on Sunday, sophomore at
tacker Michelle DeChant tallied five
goals. Bach and junior attacker
Megan Burker contributed a hat trick
apiece and Stanford rode its high
powered offense to a 17-14 victory.
Stanford (9-5,5-0 Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation) started with an
offensive explosion against Yale (6-
6), which came into the contest
ranked No. 1 ( ) in the nation. Quick
scores from sophomore midfielder
Liz Piselli and senior midfielder
Kelsey Twist gave the Cardinal a 2-0
lead just seven minutes into the game.
After a lone Yale goal, tallies from se
nior midfielder Nina Pantano, Bach
and freshman midfielder Ariana
Parasco gave the Cardinal a 5-1 lead
in the waning minutes of the first half.
"We started with a huge team ef
fort." Burker said. "Our offense
stepped up with everyone contribut
ing a lot more than in other games.
We had depth to fall back on. and
our defense stepped up too. We
were stronger all over the field."
However, Yale responded to
Stanford's initial run with an even
larger streak of its own. The Bulldogs
scored two goals in the last two min
utes of the first half and another two

goals in the first seven minutes of the
second half to tie the game at 5-5.
Twist's second goal, with 21:50
remaining, briefly stemmed the
Bulldogs' momentum, placing the
Cardinal in front 6-5. However, over
the next seven minutes, Yale explod
ed for another three goals, capping a
7-1 run for the Bulldogs and giving
Yale its largest lead of the game, 8-6,
with 15:14 remaining.
"At times it was a little frantic to
try to figure out what can get us hack
on track and get the momentum to
shift," Burker said. "Finally, we real
ized that what we needed to do we
already knew how to do. We came
up with big defensive stops and
caught up with Yale."
The Cardinal defense held Yale
scoreless in the last 15 minutes, and a
pair of scores from freshman attacker
Daphne Patterson tied the game at 8-
8 with 4:22 remaining. After both
teams stalled on offensive posses
sions, Bach netted the game-winner
on an unassisted breakaway with 55
seconds left and controlled the ensu
ing draw, allowing the Cardinal to run
out the clock on the dramatic victory.
Bach's game-winner, which left
nearly a minute on the clock, ran
counter to the Cardinal's initial plans.
"We had planned to get the last
shot," Burker said. "We were look
ing around, looking to run a set, but
Sarah made a really great hard drive
and did just what we needed."
