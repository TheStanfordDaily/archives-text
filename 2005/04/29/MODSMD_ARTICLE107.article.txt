# Bodensteiner walks tight rope

### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Most basketball players (or ath
letes in any sport) will tell you that all
the hard work and training they en
dure is more than worth it when they
step out on the court and perform to
the highest level in real competition.
Hundreds of 94-foot sprints and shoot
ing drills are a pleasure in retrospect
when the game-winning shot hits noth
ing but net.
But what if there were no game
day?
What if you went from practice and
the weight room on Monday, to prac
tice on Tuesday, to full practice and an
individual workout on Wednesday?
You'd be junior Clare Bodensteiner.
redshirting for the No. 4 Stanford
women's basketball team. Th u r s -
day: gameday. But not for Bodenstein
er. She shows up to the arena at 11 a.m.
for extra shooting and stays to shoot
around with the rest of the team until 1
or 2 p.m.
On the road, the rest of the team

After cheering her teammates on

night and has earned her day off for the
week on Sunday.
Wasn't it just Monday?
After watching the former all-state
high school player spend her first two
years behind a host of talented guards,
head coach Tara VanDerveer ap

her junior year off to get stronger and
prepare for the departure of two se
nior starters at her position. She would
be VanDerveer's first non-injury red
shirt in 19 years at Stanford.
"Tara talked to me about it last
spring, so I had spring, summer and fall
to think about it," Bodensteiner said.
"Looking at things, we have a lot of
guards; [guard Susan King Borchardt]
decided to come back for her senior
year; and I can do a lot of things with
my fifth year academically, so that had
a lot of influence on whether 1 wanted
to stay [fora fifth year] or not."
On a team that exudes unselfish
ness, Bodensteiner may be the most
shining example. To wit, her own will
ingness to help the Stanford program
has been instrumental in moving her
down the depth chart.
