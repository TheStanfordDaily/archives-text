# Bodensteiner walks tight rope
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Most basketball players (or ath
letes in any sport) will tell you that all
the hard work and training they en
dure is more than worth it when they
step out on the court and perform to
the highest level in real competition.
Hundreds of 94-foot sprints and shoot
ing drills are a pleasure in retrospect
when the game-winning shot hits noth
ing but net.
But what if there were no game
day?
What if you went from practice and
the weight room on Monday, to prac
tice on Tuesday, to full practice and an
individual workout on Wednesday?
You'd be junior Clare Bodensteiner.
redshirting for the No. 4 Stanford
women's basketball team. Th u r s -
day: gameday. But not for Bodenstein
er. She shows up to the arena at 11 a.m.
for extra shooting and stays to shoot
around with the rest of the team until 1
or 2 p.m.
On the road, the rest of the team
heads back to the hotel after
shootaround. Bodensteiner? She hits
the gym fora little extra conditioning.
After cheering her teammates on
to another victory Thursday night, Fri
day means travel and another work
out. Saturday would be another

"gameday," but Bodensteiner has
extra shooting and workout again. She
travels home with her team Saturday
night and has earned her day off for the
week on Sunday.
Wasn't it just Monday?
After watching the former all-state
high school player spend her first two
years behind a host of talented guards,
head coach Tara VanDerveer ap
proached Bodensteiner about taking
her junior year off to get stronger and
prepare for the departure of two se
nior starters at her position. She would
be VanDerveer's first non-injury red
shirt in 19 years at Stanford.
"Tara talked to me about it last
spring, so I had spring, summer and fall
to think about it," Bodensteiner said.
"Looking at things, we have a lot of
guards; [guard Susan King Borchardt]
decided to come back for her senior
year; and I can do a lot of things with
my fifth year academically, so that had
a lot of influence on whether 1 wanted
to stay [fora fifth year] or not."
On a team that exudes unselfish
ness, Bodensteiner may be the most
shining example. To wit, her own will
ingness to help the Stanford program
has been instrumental in moving her
down the depth chart.
"Clare sees the big picture," Van-

Clare Bodensteiner, the first non-injury redshirt in head coach Tara Van-
Derveer's 19 years on the Farm, spends countless hours in the gym.
Derveer said. "She was hostess [during
recruitment] for [freshman] Candice
[Wiggins], hostess for [freshman[ Cissy
[Pierce] and she was talking to Susan
about coming back, and those three peo
ple play ahead of her. She is an incredibly
unselfish young lady."
Yet, characteristically, Bodenstein
er tells it as if she's getting the best of
this deal.
"My whole job the whole year is just
to work hard in practice, and anybody
can do that," Bodensteiner said. "I've
got it easy this year. The last two years,
I'm sitting there in the game, wonder
ing 'When am I going to go in?' 4 Am I
going to go in?' Just sitting back and
seeing things from a different perspec
tive has been great, and I'll get an extra
spring and fall that the ordinary stu
dent-athlete wouldn't have."
As Bodensteiner has discovered,
however, a redshirt year brings chal
lenges of its own. While she practices
dribbling with medicine balls and
sweats through an extra set of sit-ups,
her teammates answer questions about
the road to the Final Four.
Removed from the spotlight of a
top-five team, Bodensteiner's hours of
work will go unnoticed by all but her
teammates until she steps on the court
next fall.
"One of the most challenging things
about being a redshirt is that you can
become anonymous, because you're
never going to get in the game," said
Beth Burns, the team's strength coach
and Bodensteiner's near-constant
companion in her year of training.
"Clare's never going to be anonymous.
You can see the respect she garners
from everybody and the energy that
she brings."

Think a redshirt can't make an impact
on gameday? Watch the Cardinal at
Maples Pavilion and wait for the media
timeouts. Ask for your money back if
Bodensteiner isn't the first one to start
slapping high-fives, get up on her feet
and run out on the court like her fold
ing chair is on fire.
Sophomore Brooke Smith, Boden
steiner's roommate, remembers her
NCAA-mandated redshirt last season
after transferring from Duke.
"Probably right about now is where
it seems like, 'Okay, it was fun, let's
move on, I want to play now,'" Smith
said. "But she does whatever she's
doing with all her enthusiasm, and she
knows what she's putting this year in
for."
Meanwhile, Bodensteiner is discov
ering the joys — or pains — of having
plenty of time and a room full of
weights at her disposal. According to
Burns, the junior is quickly becoming
the strongest and most physically fit
member of the team as she puts in
workout after extra workout.
As for next season, senior starters
Kelley Suminski and Borchardt will
depart, each leaving behind almost 30
minutes per game of playing time.
Where Bodensteiner will fit into a
guard mix including Wiggins. Pierce,
junior Krista Rappahahn and sopho
more Markisha Coleman remains to
be seen.
"I think she's going to do really well
the next two years," VanDerveer said.
"You hope that every single player you
coach has Clare's attitude and work
ethic, and those things go a long way
with me."
In the meantime, the weekend is al
most here, which means Bodenstein
er's work week is about to hit high gear.
But hey, at least she's got it easy.
