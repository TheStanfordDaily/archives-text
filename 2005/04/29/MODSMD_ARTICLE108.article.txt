# Luber twins do it all for No. 3 water polo
## 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
The first thing that jumps out at
you about senior twins Hannah and
Kelty Luber is their height. Both list
ed at 6-foot-2, they tower over all but
a few of their competitors. But in
women's water polo, which features
a wide range of positional roles, it is
difficult to imagine players of their
size being able to excel in more than
one dimension.
But thal'frwhere the Luber twins
defy the odds. Combining speed,
strength and agility, they have devel
oped, over their four years on the
Farm, into two remarkably versatile
forces capable of handling any oppo
nent or situation. And beyond their
unquestionable contributions in the
pool, the Luber twins provide a lead
ership presence that is as great a rea
son as any for the high hopes held by
the No. 3 Cardinal (12-4, 5-2 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) as
they enter the final stages of their
season.
The official position listed beside
Kelty and Hannah's names in the
team media guide is "2-meter / de
fender." It is a listing that clearly de
notes responsibilities in both ends of
the pool, but it doesn't do justice to

the array of talents and abilities
these two players possess. Not only
do they have the size and tenacity to
compete for inside possessions near
the two-meter mark, hut they also
demonstrate the quickness and vi

sion of the pool needed to run the of
fense from the perimeter.
Hannah and Kelly's styles of play
reflect respective orientations - Han
nah's toward offense, and Kelty's to
ward defense - but that doesn't stop

either of them from factoring promi
nently into both the Cardinal's at
tack and defensive schemes.
"They have similar playing styles
and complement each other really
well in the water," head coach John
Tanner said. "Hannah plays a fair
amount of two-meter offense, and
Kelty plays a fair amount of two
meter defense. But they both do a lot
of driving and have major roles on
our power play. They're also both
fast, so they can cover a lot of
ground/" • •.> • • > ?».
Their versatility is probably due
to the fact that their particular posi
tional roles have evolved slightly in
each of the four seasons they have
played for the Cardinal.
"Basically we're just utility play
ers and try to do whatever the team
needs us to do," Hannah said.
And true to their word, the Luber
sisters have done just that - especial
ly this year when the call of duty has
extended far beyond the Avery
Aquatic Center pool. As the only se
nior members of this year's squad,
Kelty and Hannah's charge as cap
tains has been to strike a very deli
cate balance — the balance of push
ing their teammates to new heights

Senior twins Kelty and Hannah Luber are two of the most versatile players on
the Cardinal squad.
while remaining focused and ap
proachable. And if the Cardinal
squad's cohesiveness at this stage of
the season is any indicator, then the
Lubers have struck that balance
with the greatest possible precision.
"Their level of play is intimidat
ing to me, but never their attitudes
or personalities," freshman Megan
Nesland said. "They each make it a
point to help the younger players on
the team and to make themselves
available for whatever we need. I've
never been on a team that has
meshed as completely as this one,
and Hannah and Kelty both play a
large role in the maintenance of that
atmosphere."
But of course, the Lubers' com
bined eight years of collegiate expe
rience also translates to a pool lead
ership presence from which the en
tire Cardinal squad benefits. The
Luber twins make it a point to build
trust and build confidence not only
in each other, but in every other
member of the team.
"As a freshman, they have really
helped me become acclimated to this
level of play," freshman driver Jenna
Scalmanini said.
Considering how well-rounded
their playing and leadership abilities
are as members of the water polo
team, it should come as no surprise
to learn that Hannah and Kelty's
academic and world interests are
equally well-rounded.
"They're both really determined
people and come from a really bal
anced background," Tanner said.

"They have a lot of activities and in
terests and know so much about
movies, music and the arts in addi
tion to being really good athletes."
Having spent summers they spent
with their aunt in Barcelona, Spain,
the twins gained an early apprecia
tion for the diversity of cultures, peo
ples and language. That appreciation
has been with them ever since.
During their time here at Stan
ford, they have developed their pro
ficiency in Spanish and Portuguese
while gaining substantial introduc
tions to French, Italian and Swahili.
According to Hannah, their musical
preferences range from "60s and 70s
stuff like Jackson Browne or George
Harrison, to dorky 80s like Oingo
Boingo and XTC, to blues like RL
Burnside and John Lee Hooker, to
funky world music from Brazil, parts
of Africa and France, to newer
music like Elliot Smith, Ray LaMon
taigne and Tracy Chapman."
Both agreed that it would be im
possible to name a favorite cinema
piece, song or artist.
Looking ahead to what awaits
them beyond graduation, both Han
nah and Kelty expressed their desire
to simply relax fora bit and enjoy
themselves. Ultimately, both hope
to continue their travels and to pur
sue the variety of life experiences
the world has to offer.
But no matter what challenges
come their way, the Lubers need do
only what they've done in the pool
their last four years as members of
the Cardinal — relax, breathe and
let their passion, skills and desire
take care of everything else.
