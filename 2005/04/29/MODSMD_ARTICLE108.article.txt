# Luber twins do it all for No. 3 water polo
## 
### WES MATEO STAFF WRITER 
The first thing that jumps out at
you about senior twins Hannah and
Kelty Luber is their height. Both list
ed at 6-foot-2, they tower over all but
a few of their competitors. But in
women's water polo, which features
a wide range of positional roles, it is
difficult to imagine players of their
size being able to excel in more than
one dimension.
But thal'frwhere the Luber twins
defy the odds. Combining speed,
strength and agility, they have devel
oped, over their four years on the
Farm, into two remarkably versatile
forces capable of handling any oppo
nent or situation. And beyond their
unquestionable contributions in the
pool, the Luber twins provide a lead
ership presence that is as great a rea
son as any for the high hopes held by
the No. 3 Cardinal (12-4, 5-2 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) as
they enter the final stages of their
season.
The official position listed beside
Kelty and Hannah's names in the
team media guide is "2-meter / de
fender." It is a listing that clearly de
notes responsibilities in both ends of
the pool, but it doesn't do justice to

the array of talents and abilities
these two players possess. Not only
do they have the size and tenacity to
compete for inside possessions near
the two-meter mark, hut they also
demonstrate the quickness and vi

sion of the pool needed to run the of
fense from the perimeter.
Hannah and Kelly's styles of play
reflect respective orientations - Han
nah's toward offense, and Kelty's to
ward defense - but that doesn't stop

either of them from factoring promi
nently into both the Cardinal's at
tack and defensive schemes.
"They have similar playing styles
and complement each other really
well in the water," head coach John
Tanner said. "Hannah plays a fair
amount of two-meter offense, and
Kelty plays a fair amount of two
meter defense. But they both do a lot
of driving and have major roles on
our power play. They're also both
fast, so they can cover a lot of
ground/" • •.> • • > ?».
Their versatility is probably due
to the fact that their particular posi
tional roles have evolved slightly in
each of the four seasons they have
played for the Cardinal.
"Basically we're just utility play
ers and try to do whatever the team
needs us to do," Hannah said.
And true to their word, the Luber
sisters have done just that - especial
ly this year when the call of duty has
extended far beyond the Avery
Aquatic Center pool. As the only se
nior members of this year's squad,
Kelty and Hannah's charge as cap
tains has been to strike a very deli
cate balance — the balance of push
ing their teammates to new heights
