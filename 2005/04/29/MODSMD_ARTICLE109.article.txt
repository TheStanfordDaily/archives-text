# Frosh Taylor handles pressure
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
Coming into the season, Michael Taylor knew
that he would face a high-pressure situation. Not
only would the freshman have to adjust to the col
lege game and show that he belonged on one of
the best baseball teams in the country, but he
would also be thrown right into the starting lineup,
taking Brian Hall's spot in right field.
But if Taylor's feeling the heat, he's not show
ing it. He was cool as a cucumber hist Tuesday,
coming around from first to score what proved to
be the winning run against Santa Gara to cap a
six-run Cardinal comeback.
And earlier this year, the heat of playing in
Texas against the No. 1 Longhoms didn't make
Taylor sweat, either. He broke out of a season
opening 5-for-28 slump that weekend, collecting
three consecutive multi-hit games. (Since that se
ries, he's hit 338t0 raise his season average to .293.)
Taylor came to the Farm with big expecta
tions riding on his broad shoulders (he stands at
an imposing 6-foot-6 and weighs in at 235). There
hadn't been a more anticipated arrival at Sunken
Diamond since that of John Mayberry, Jr., a first
round draft pick, two years ago. Taylor was
handed a starting job at the beginning of the sea
son — an honor that not even Mayberry, Jed
Lowrie or Sam Fuld was awarded — and he was
billed as a true five-tool player.
How does Taylor handle the pressure?

All he has to do is think of the alternative.
"It's a lot better being here right now than
being in some podunk town, eating 7-11 hot dogs
and nachos and stuff," he said, referring to the
travails of a minor league baseball player. "Here
you get fed well, get taken care of, get a chance to
have an education, get a chance to play some
high-caliber baseball with these great players. It's
definitely worth it."
Taylor, like Mayberry. decided to forego the
draft and sign with Stanford, though he was al
most guaranteed a spot in the first round. His ad
justment to college ball has been a difficult one,
but Taylor has handled it in typical fashion.
"I've come through a lot of hard work and ad
justments," he said. "I cut down my stride, right
off the bat, and I also had to make sure that my
hands get to the ball."
He said that he is also trying to put the ball in
play more often to give himself a chance to use his
speed on the basepaths. His power game is still de
veloping— he has six doubles and a triple to his
credit this season, but no home runs yet — but Tay
lor is confident that it will come with experience.
Part of the reason that he doesn't feel the
pressure of living up to the expectations he's cre
ated is that, well, he doesn't pay much heed to
what people say about him.
"The pressure is not anything more than I put
on myself to come out every day and perform,"
he said. "There's pressure just trying to win. I
mean, what other people think about me off the

field is for them to do. Guys like you are going to
write your articles, and I don't even really read
them anymore. I stopped picking up papers and
reading articles after my sophomore year [of
high school in Apopka, Fla.] because I just real
ized that the game's fickle. One weekend you're
everything, the next weekend you're awful. If
you never read anything, then you're just who
you are to yourself."
Taylor does not lack confidence, something
that Lowrie thinks is a key ingredient of his suc
cess thus far.
"He's a confident guy, and that's what you
need to be," Lowrie said. "I think he straddles the
line of confidence and cockiness pretty well, which
is especially important fora baseball player."
But Lowrie also characterized Taylor as a
team player, and that, more than any other acco
lade, is what Taylor wants to be remembered for.
"When I'm done playing baseball, whether
that's three years from now or 25 years from
now, I want to sit back and say I put everything I
had into the game, and I was either good enough
or I wasn't," he said. "I never want to look back
and say I should have gotten more out of myself
here or there. I just want to be able to say 1 gave
it everything 1 had, and this is how it worked out."
If the early results are any indication, he is
well on his way. .
