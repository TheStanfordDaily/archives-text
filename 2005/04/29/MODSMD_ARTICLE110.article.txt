# After mission, junior Clayton back on the court
## 
### ALICE ANN SPURGIN STAFF WRITER 
With the playoffs just around the
corner, the pressure is on.
The No. 10 Stanford men's volley
ball team (10-12,9-10 Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation) will play its last
away game of the regular season to
morrow against No. 12 Pacific (12-15,
6-13).
Though the Cardinal, ranked sev
enth in the conference, are currently
set to play into the postseason. Pacific
will be fighting to change that. The
Tigers are just one spot out of the play
offs, and they are hoping to climb into
playoff contention at the last minute.
Redshirt junior Will Clayton feels
that the Cardinal are ready to defend
their playoff position.
"We've been playing our best volley
ball all season during the last couple
weeks," Gayton said. "I think it's really
important for us to continue the mo
mentum we've built up through the next
two weekends and into the playoffs."
Clayton ought to know what he's
talking about. After all, he first joined
the team as a freshman five years ago
for the 2000-2001 season.
Prepared to play at the outside hitter
or opposite position, Gayton was sur
prised when the coaching staff switched
him to middle blocker. Standing only 6-

foot-4, he did not have the height of
most middle blockers. However, it was
a perfect fit. Gayton finished that sea
son fifth on the team with 64 kills and
third for service aces, with 14.
"Contrary to all my expectations
coming in, I ended up getting a lot of play
ing time my freshman year in a position I
never expected to be playing," Gayton
said. "I remember being totally surprised
when the head coach included my name
in the opening game starting lineup — 1
thought he'd made a mistake."
Years of experience in the sport
helped Gayton transition from high
school to college play successfully. He
has been playing volleyball since sev
enth grade, when a Boy Scout leader
who coached a local high school team
let him play at a camp for freshmen
and sophomores. - |
"1 was puny compared to most of
thenguys, by far the shortest guy on the
court," Gayton said. "But this gave me
some good motivation to improve my
skills so I could compete who
were better than I was."
Despite his dedication to his sport
and his promising freshman season.
Gayton left the team for two years.
Recognizing a greater dedication to his
faith, he traveled to Baltimore, Md., to
complete his Mormon mission.
"I don't regret my decision fora
second," Gayton said. "My mission is

the most valuable experience of my life
thus far. Some pursuits take priority
over others - they're simply more im
portant. And it's been my experience
that when I've prioritized the most im
portant things, God has facilitated the
other areas of my life."
Rejoining the team after his time
off, he admits, was a challenge.
"1 didn't do any weight-training or
play any volleyball, because I was fo
cused on my mission responsibilities,"
Clayton said. "As a result, I lost 40
pounds of muscle mass while I was
gone. There were lots of wide-eyed
family members wondering how I got
so skinny. But the coaches and my
teammates were absolutely patient and
supportive as I got back into volleyball
shape. I was really impressed by the way
they encouraged and helped me. All in
all, it took about eight months before 1
felt like myself on the court again —
just at the end of last season."
At the end of that season, Clayton
was named to the All-MPSF Scholar-
Athlete Team.
"Yes, I am a nerd," Clayton joked.
"This is going to ruin my street cred,
but I've been waiting for the right mo
ment to pull this out: I have read every
play ever written by William Shake
speare. It was part of an English course
earlier this year, and it nearly killed
me."

Though being an English major
means staying up late into the night after
a long day of classes and practice, the ex
perience has been great for Gayton.
"For some reason, I think it's a lot
easier to read a book or outline a paper
than to do a problem set when you're
traveling," he said. "You can read a
book with you anywhere - on a plane or
a bus or in a hotel room. Doing problem
sets and lab reports can be trickier."
While the life of a student-athlete at
Stanford can be challenging, Clayton
feels that being a part of the volleyball
team is an invaluable experience.
"Truth be told, it requires a lot of
mental and physical stamina to get
through the season successfully," he
said. "When you try to stay in top com
petitive form from September through
April, you get tired sometimes. But the
length of the season is also one of the
things that have made it a valuable ex
perience. Who else has the opportuni
ty to compete against such highly
ranked teams and develop their skills
in such an intensive way? Because the
season is so long and demanding, you
feel like you've been part of something
that was truly important when the sea
son ends."
