## 
### CARLING NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
A Pacific-10 Conference singles
title, a Pac-10 doubles title, the No. 1
singles player in the country and the
No. 1 doubles team in the country. It's
shaping up to be a pretty good week for
the No. 21 Stanford men's tennis team.
The Cardinal (13-10, 4-3) traveled
to Ojai, Calif., to compete last Thurs
day through Sunday in the Pac-10
Championships. Despite being behind
No. 6 UCLA, No. 13 Washington and
No. 19 Southern California in the team
rankings, Stanford made its presence
clear in both of the main draws of this
individual tournament with Stanford
capturing both the individual singles
and doubles Pac-10 titles.
"I know we didn't win some of those
tight [matches]," head coach John
Whitlinger said, "but I thought we
stayed together pretty well as a team.
[Assistant Coach Dave Hodge and I]
were very happy with what went on
down [in Ojai]."
Senior Sam Warburg defended his
singles ti'ie. About an hour later, he
also went on to claim the doubles title
with junior KC Corkery.
"I was definitely fatigued [after sin
gles]," Warburg said. "1 had a long
match, and there was a lot of pressure,
a lot more pressure than I've felt in a
while. There was only a little time [be
tween matches] so it was hard to change
focus. But once I got out on the court, 1
was fired up and ready to go. I knew
that KC needed me to step up and play
well, because I knew he was going to
play well."
In addition to both players' strong
serves and tough returns, the support of
their teammates helped propel them
through the draw as well.
"Everyone felt like they had a lot of
support when they were playing be
cause everyone that wasn't playing at
the time came up and was watching and
cheering for the other guys on the
team," Corkery said. "It was something

that I thought really helped us through
out the tournament."
This was Corkery's first Pac-10
doubles titles after multiple appear
ances in the finals of this tournament.
Yesterday's ranking reflected last
weekend's results, as Warburg
claimed the top singles spot in the na
tion, as well as half of the top doubles
pair in the country, along with Cork
ery. Corkery remained No. 13 in sin
gles, and sophomore James Wan
checked in at No. 76.
The tournament consisted of main
singles and doubles brackets but also
two invitational draws for singles and
doubles. Corkery withdrew from sin
gles due to a minor injury. Senior Phil
Sheng came close to an upset of the
Trojans' No. 17 Jamil Al-Agba in the
first round but ultimately lost, 6-1,2-6,
6-3. Wan won two matches before
falling 6-4, 6-2 in the quarterfinals to
eventual finalist Alex Vlaski of Wash
ington.
Warburg cruised through his first
two singles rounds with ease. In the
quarterfinals, the senior met No. 41
Alex Slovic, a lefty from Washington.
The two split sets, and the third set
came down to a tiebreaker that War
burg won, 7-5.
In the semifinals, Warburg beat No.
10 Sven Swinnen in straight sets. Then
came the final test: whether or not War
burg would be able to defend his Pac-10
singles title.
No. 7 Vlaski had defeated Wan in
the quarters. Earlier this year, in the
regular dual match season, he retired
after splitting sets with Warburg. The
two seniors exchanged numerous
breaks early in the first set and pulled
even at 5-5 when Warburg held serve to
go up 6-5. With a double fault on set
point from Vlaski, the Cardinal earned
the following game and consequently
the first set.
The second set followed a similar
pattern, and the opponents found
themselves even at 5-5 once again.
With an uncanny repeat of the first set.

Warburg held serve and then broke,
with Vlaski giving up the match with
yet another double fault.
In the invitational singles draw, ju
nior Jon Wong and sophomores Eric
McKean and Dave Ryan fell in the first
round, while freshman Phil Kao won
two matches in straight sets before de
ferring in the quarterfinals to UCLA's
Mathieu Dehaine in three sets.
Stanford's other duo in the main
doubles draw. Sheng and Wong, lost in
the first round to a duo from UCLA.
Ryan and Kao exited the invitational
doubles draw in the first round while
McKean and Wan made quick work of
a duo from Arizona State, 8-0. Howev
er, McKean and Wan then dropped an
8-5 decision to California's Lennart
Maack and Dean Wallace in the semifi
nals.
In the semifinals. Corkery and War
burg avenged their regular season loss
to UCLA's No. 20 Alberto Francis and
Kris Kwinta with an 8-4 win.
"When they [both] return well. I'm
really not sure if anybody can beat
them," Whitlinger said. "They seemed
to have it going this weekend, they
communicated well and they were fired
up."
Warburg had similar sentiments.

"I think when you return really well
it takes so much pressure off your
serve," the senior said. "There's a pre
mium in holding serve in men's tennis."-
Craving even more revenge, the de
fending NCAA Champions entered
the finals looking to even the score
against Washington's No. 21 Daniel
Chu and Alex Slovic after being upset
by the Huskies in March.
In a fashion similar to their play in
the rest of the tournament, Corkery
and Warburg began the mach in a dom
inating way and took an early 6-1 lead.
While Washington earned a few breaks
to get back in the match, they were not
able to make a full comeback, and the
Cardinal pair clinched the Pac-10 title
with an 8-6 win.
"When Sam and I play well togeth
er, it makes it very difficult for other
people to get in any sort of rhythm be
cause we can both return well, and we
both can play well on our service
games," Corkery said. "In the last
month or two, we've been trying to do
just enough to win. But I feel like this
[weekend], we tried to kill people in
stead of just tTying to beat them. "
