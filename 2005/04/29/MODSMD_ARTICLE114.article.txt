# Intermission hits up the Stanford red light district
## 'Pre-Comm': Is The Stanford Daily plagued by this sexual dysfunction? 
### TEAM INTERMISSION INTERMISSION STAFF 
You knew the day would fi
nally come (hehe, you know
you get it — oh wait, we
haven't told you what the
issue is about yet...) when
we'd decide to an issue about
sex.
Okay, so maybe we did this
same theme the year before,
and maybe we did it even the
year before that. Perhaps those
issues were better than this

one. Maybe we're basically ripping
of an old theme and executing it
rather poorly. But you wouldn't
have known that if we hadn't told
you, so sit back, smile and pcetend
like everything we're telling you is
earthshattering.
And after all, to many, the no
tion of sex at Stanford at all is
shocking enough.
Sure, you might have "hooked
up" at that EBF party last week,
but does mistaking your room
mate's face fora casserole while af
flicted with a serious case of the
munchies really count as kissing?
Does tripping and doing a face
plant on your RA's shin reqjly
count as "going down" on her?
No.
Let's face it. Stanford students
are often lacking when it comes to
the Action Department. That's
why we're trying to help y'all out by
presenting an easy how-to-hook-up

(for real) guide (see pages 4-5).
Which brings us to an important
question: •'You were drunk, how
did you remember that?"
That's right. We all know most
people "hook up" when they're
shitfaced. So how in the world are
they able to recount — in extensive
detail — their steamy encounters
when they can't remember where
they were or who it was with?
We don't know. Which makes
us think: Most of you are big pa
thetic liars.
All the more reason to read our
guide. Why not become informed,
actually get some, and then stop
having to feel like you're in fiction
class time everytime you're doing
the "locker room" talk with the
boys (or girls).
There's a saying that there are
two sides to every story. But if you
know what to do when it comes to
the opposite (or same) sex, you

know there will only be one ac
count ... a very, very positive one.
So stop bitching and get off your
ass. Go make something of your
self. whether that involves sex or
not. Just stop talking about shit that
didn't happen.
