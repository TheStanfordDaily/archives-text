### TIM LIPUS ASSHOLE 
Wednesday, Intermission once again
unleashed Tun Lipus, Asshole, on EBF's
Happy Hour. This time we told him to do
some research on sex at Stanford. It seems
he luui his own agenda. Tim Lipus, Ass
hole, began the evening by approaching
an Attractive Girl From Manila.
Tim Lipus Asshole: So Mildred, can I
ask you a question?
Attractive Girl From Manila: My name's
not Mildred.
TL, A: Anyway, which word do find
more erotic? Now pay attention.
"Moist," or "congressman"?
AGFM: (confused) What did you just say?
TL, A: "Moist"? Or "congressman"? It's
a simple question.
AGFM: Moist, I guess.
TL, A: OK. Now, who would you rather
sleep with?
AGFM: Oh God, what is this guy doing?
TL, A: Senate majority leader Bill Frist
or House Majority Leader Tom DeLay?
AGFM: That question is retarded.
TL, A: What did you just say?
AGFM: I said, you're retarded.
TL, A: ME? You want to sleep with ME?
That's awesome. You're really hot.
[Awkward silence]
AGFM: Yuck.
Having visibly disturbed this very nice
girl, Tim Lipus, Asshole, made his way
over to a Perfectly Normal Guy.
Perfectly Normal Guy: Hey asshole, you
quoted me last week.
TL, A: Can we quote you calling me an
asshole?
PNG: No! This is all off the record.
TL, A: Wow. It's going to be really funny
when we quote you.
PNG: No, seriously. I don't really want to
be quoted.
TL, A: Wait. You don't really wanted to

be quoted, or you really don't want to be
quoted? Think about this. If you gel it
wrong, we're totally going to quote you.
PNG: Hold on, let me think ... DONT
QUOTE ME.
TL, A: I really need a tape recorder.
PNG: What?
TL, A: Oh well. It's going to be really ;
funny when we reconstruct this conver
sation later.
PNG: You mean like The Daily recon
structs all its bullshit quotes and ends up
being completely wrong?
TL, A: Can we quote you on that?
PNG: (visibly intoxicated) Yeah. Fuck
yeah.
[Five minutes later]
PNG: Are you seriously trying to recon
struct that conversation?
TL, A: Yeah. It's probably really inaccurate,
but we're totally going to publish it iinyway.
A fter sacrificing the last of his journal
istic integrity, Tim Lipiis, Asshole once
again caught sight of the Attractive Girl
From Manila.
TL, A: So Mildred, you want to hook up
with me now?
AGFM: My name's not Mildred. And
no, I definitely do not.
TL, A: Hmm. It's a good thing no means
yes. (To friend) Hey, what's up? I'm still
trying to get this Mildred girl to hook up
with me.
AGFM: My name is NOT MILDRED!
TL, A: (To friend) I think I'm wearing
her down.
AGFM: Okay, asshole. Listen up. Not
that my personal life is any of your busi
ness, but I have a boyfriend.
