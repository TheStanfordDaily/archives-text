## A 						'HITCH' IN OUR PLANS THE 						HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY 
### CHRIS LEE TAM VO FAILED INTERMISSION HITCHHIKERS 
Opening today, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to
the Galaxy" is the film adaptation of the first
hook in the cult series written by the late Douglas
Adams. Infusing mordant British humor with an
irreverent science fiction spin, the books have
generated their own cultural lore. Chief among
the facts that every good galactic hitchhiker
should know: 1) Dolphins are the smartest crea
tures on earth: 2) Never leave home without a
towel; and perhaps most importantly 3) The an
swer to life, the universe and everything is the
number 42.
In their never-ending quest for brilliant enter
tainment copy, intrepid Intermissionaries Chris
Lee and Tam Vo met with the movie's producer,
Robbie Stamp, as well as attended a screening in
order to write up both a moving interview and a
stylish movie review. What follows is neither of
those things.
CHRIS: Don't panic, Tam â€” even though
we've lost our entire interview with producer
Robbie Stamp and missed our movie screening,
we're still going to write this 500 word article pro
moting "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"
which may or may not be the best sci-fi epic
ever!!!
TAM: Recall that we were pulled over by a
cop in San Francisco during this epic misadven
ture.
CHRIS: This was after you telling me how you
were such a sweet-talker with the police, getting
your friends out of tickets all the time.
TAM: Ironic after I'd been pointing out all the
cars with broken taillights on the way to the inter

view in San Francisco, because that's what the
cop pulled us over for.
CHRIS: Oh, but you worked her. You
worked her GOOD.
TAM: The valets at the Ritz Carlton were de
lighted to see a beat-up minivan pull up in front of
the hotel lobby for the press conference
CHRIS: Oh, and what a press conference it
was! Our "college roundtable," jam-packed with
you, me and that frumpy girl from the city college
that will remain anonymous.
TAM: She asked everything we wanted to
know, like "What are your plans for merchandis
ing this movie?" Of course, Disney has its hand in
this cash cow.
CHRIS: I was so relieved when she asked,
"Do you think if this movie does well, you'll make
the sequel?" I hasn't sure if I'd have the guts.
TAM: I was entranced by Robbie Stamp's
robot pin.
CHRIS: And I was entranced by his English
teeth -1 mean, wit!
TAM: He did seem confident that American
audiences would respond well to the British
humor.
CHRIS: Especially because Mos Def is in the
movie.
TAM: He bridges the racial AND cultural di
vide!!
CHRIS: In all fairness, though, I do like that
Martin Freeman from"The Office" is in it. I
think he's a pretty good choice for Arthur Dent.
TAM: And Stamp was very respectful of au
thor Douglas Adams. He said that the two of
them worked together a lot in prepping for the
movie before Adams passed away.
CHRIS: Hey Tam, isn't it funny how instead
of using direct quotes we're paraphrasing what

Robbie supposedly said to us? Why is that?
TAM: Because YOU LOST OUR TAPE.
CHRIS: Oh. (Awkward silence)
TAM: Anyway. Robbie did admit that he had
some great real-life hitchhiking stories of his own.
CHRIS: 1 know, his eyes definitely lit up when
you asked him that! And then he said he couldn't
tell them to us.
TAM: 1 think I could have worn him down, if
they hadn't kicked us out after only TEN MIN
UTES.
CHRIS: It's ok. At least we got to go to the
screening.
TAM: Yes. The screening.
(shared mournful silence)
CHRIS: We were excited to redeem our San
Francisco adventure with a chance to screen the
movie. On Tuesday, we arrived at the AMC Mer
cado in Santa Clara early - to a screening of the
highly-anticipated David Duchovny flick "House
of D."
TAM: We felt tricked.
CHRIS: We'd been mistakenly directed to the
wrong theater.
Rather than spend two hours with a retarded
Robin Williams, we got lost on the way to the
AMC Saratoga, where a woman named Cricket
informed us that she was very sorry, but that all of
the seats were full.
TAM: And that we'd be fire hazards if we sat
in the aisle. We really couldn't see it ending any
other way than this.
CHRIS: Actually, I really thought we'd get to
see at least some of the
movie, Tam.
(angry silence)
TAM: What is it with you and silences?
CHRIS:...

TAM: Anyways, I guess the moral of this
story is -
CHRIS: Don't panic?
TAM: No.
CHRIS: Don't leave home without a towel?
TAM: No.
CHRIS: 42?
TAM: NO.
CHRIS: Well what is it then?
TAM: Always, always have backup filler!!!




Big-head robot
says:"I pity the
fool who don't
'Hitch' a ride not
to see this movie."
Confused? So
were the writers...
