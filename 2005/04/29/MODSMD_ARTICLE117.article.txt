# Stick to rapping, Ice Cube, cuz you ain't no 'XXX'

### JOSHUA SMITH INTERMISSION SECRET AGENT 
There was one particular image that
simply could not escape my mind's eye
while viewing the profoundly stupid
"XXX: State of the Union": that of a
"Family Guy" aside involving a high
speed covered wagon chase that inexplic
ably ends in a horse exploding. The un
called for "XXX" 's sequel shares Peter

l 'XXX: State of/^i—M
the Union'
Dir. Lee Tamahori

Griffin and Ca's over-the-top mentality,
but most unfortunately lacks the irony.
For better or worse, newly turned
family comedian Vin Diesel is replaced in
the lead role by Ice Cube, whose most no
table contribution to American cinema
up to this pointhasbeen his "Damn! Dey
got snakes down here dis big!?" line from
"Anaconda." In playing Darius Stone.
Cube demonstrates the unique ability to
state every line with the exact same vocal
inflection and sneering facial expression.
(Honestly, it's pretty impressive.)
What passes fora "plot" in this
schlock begins with the need to find a
new agent badass enough to assume
the XXX moniker (Diesel's old charac
ter has unceremoniously been killed on
a mission). Restoring his role as Gib
bons, a bored-looking Samuel L. Jack

son wants a replacement with "more
attitude" than his predecessor —
breaking Stone out of prison seems like
a good place to start.
Stone s mission? Halt Secretary of
Defense George Deckert's (Willem
Dafoe) plan to overthrow the govern
ment through an attack on the Capitol
during the president's State of the
Union address. Many explosions ensue.
Even with the setups, double-cross
ings and the rap-star appearance (Xzibit)
that seem required for the genre, "State
of the Union" never surprises. Perhaps
that's because the supporting cast follows
Cube's lead in never showing the emo
tion of disbelief. More likely, however,
the twists and t urns fail to drum up any re
action because they make the movie feel
as if writing the script were a homework

assignment in genre-conformity.
Whereas the original "XXX" played
itself off as an extreme sports version of
the James Bond franchise, its spawn (di
rected by a Bond veteran, "Die Another
Day" 's Lee Tamahori) is content to
allow the cars, breasts and explosions
speak for themselves with no underlying
motive. But with nothing to spoof, "State
of the Union" unwittingly parodies itself.
The intended-to-be-taken-seriously
slow-motion shot of Cube diving off an
aircraft carrier provided a laugh that the
flinch-inducing dialogue couldn't do
when it tried. The original has Russians
and a semblance of intrteue; the new one
has Cube dodging tanks on Constitution
Ave. in a Ford F-150.
For the most part, the sequel is more
than content to play to cliches, which

gets boring in a hurry. Cube saying, "We
don't trust the police" may have worked
on "Straight Outa Compton" in 1989,
but it feels as stale as old matzah here.
Even the action sequences in this movie
—surely proud of its high-action-to plot
ratio —seem stale. A guy jumpingfrom
a car onto a train? Woo-pid-ee-d00...
"XXX: State of the Union" spends its
seemingly infinite 94-minute running
time flirting dangerously with the so
bad-it's-awesome precipice, but sadly
never quite teeters over the edge.
There's simply no room in Cube's sneer
for some much needed self-deprecation
Perhaps the most egregious part of this
whole debacle is the unambiguous pitch
for another sequel in the film's waning
minutes. Suggestion: Avoid that future
atrocity like a kid with pink eye.
