# Intermission's guide to claiming your man (or woman) hood
## 
### INTERMISSION PANEL FOR SEX EDUCATION 
Sex at Stanford is a tricky subject. Stu
dents are notorious for putting a lot of time
into their education. They're willing to work
hard for their ticket into a top-tier profes
sional school, and they're willing to forego
bathing and sleeping for their coveted CS de
grees. When it comes down to it, most stu
dents are here to learn.
Which is all well and good, but it makes
life awfully hard for those of us who aren't.
Case in point: Try going up a girl's shirt when
she's studying for her Humßio midterm. We
dare you.
And don't even get us started on all the
weird taboos — "dormcest," "floorcest,"
and I think one guy even cautioned Intermis
sion against "incest," whatever that means.
Sometimes it seems like Stanford is doing
everything in its power to keep you from get
ting laid. There's a myth that no one really
"dates" at Stanford. According to one
would-be ladies man, "Dude, smart girls

Epilogue
Since he decided to settle, Michael has
never been happier. If you're an unwilling
member of the abstinent 50 percent, we rec
ommend you do the same.
So give true love the finger and say good
bye to candlelit dinners forever. Intermis
sion's advice is settle, settle, settle. Settle as
soon as you can, settle fast, and settle hard.
There's got to be one in a hundred girls who
likes you... for some reason. Sure, she might
not be the first girl on your list. But if you're
determined to settle. Intermission guaran
tees you'll find her eventually.
While it lasts, you'll he on top of the
world. If she realizes you're just in it for the
sex and leaves you in tears ... well, at least
she didn't mean much to you anyway. Plus,
you can always settle again. So what are you
waiting for?

have issues." Correct. These issues often in
clude such inconvenient qualities as "self-re
spect" and an aversion to being sexually ex
ploited. Too bad for you. But there's still
hope.
That's right. Despite all these obstacles,
sex at Stanford is still possible — it just might
not happen like you imagined. It might not
be ideal, but it's still sex, dammit, and it's still
worth it.
Stanford's 50 percent abstinence rate is
often quoted by the school's administration.
A lot of those 50 percent are waiting for mar
riage, and that's just fine — you pays your
money and you takes your choice. It's the
rest of that 50 percent that Intermission is
worried about. The cold hard fact is that
many Stanford students who want to be get
ting it on are just not getting it on. So Inter
mission is pleased to bring you one student's
year-long path to sex at Stanford. It worked
for him, and it will work for you. Follow the
path, and Intermission guarantees you sex in
two weeks flat. And yes, by "sex," we mean
"coitus."

"Michael" arrived at Stanford early one
morning in April, eager to attend all the
scheduled Admit Weekend events, visit
classes, and gain a more accurate percep
tion of the wonderful academic opportuni
ties Stanford had to offer him . . .OK, so
that's a load of crap, but he was pretty ex
cited about meeting a bunch of new peo
ple.
And all in all, he had a pretty good time.
He quickly learned the meaning of the
term "sexiled" because his RoHo was a
very bad RoHo and slept with a very at
tractive Pro Fro. He also learned about the
flexibility of certain phrases such as "strict
no alcohol policy." Michael was impressed.
In fact, he was so impressed that he came
back in September.

PI PHI
Don't even bother.
These girls are out of
your league. Or at least
that's the way they see it.

The doors were thrown wide open to a
world of possibilities. No longer did he
have to lie about his sexual exploits to fit in
with his friends. No longer did he have to
keep track of his roommate's class sched
ule so he could chart out his weekly
"Michael" time. No longer did he have to
dream.
Molly was just as eager for sex — we
mean coitus — as he was, and they went at
it like rabbits, if in fact the myth that rab
bits have copious amounts of sex is at all ac
curate. Instead of wondering "if' he was
going to have sex, the questions became
"when" and "where."
Intermission is pleased to address the
"where" question on the opposite page.
And if you're looking for Michael, he's
probably off doing "research" on top of
Hoover Tower.

HOOVER TOWER
Every Stanford student's wet dream. There's noth
ing sexier thatn having sex on top of a huge clock tower
that shares its name with a dead president and a con
servative think tank.
Plus, you'd make a great addition to a campus tour.

FED/EX KINKOS
The sign says it all.
And come on, you know
you've always been curious
about copying your ass.. .in all
sorts of situations. Why should
sex be any exception? Listen for
Michael and Molly late at night
when all is quiet and the city
sleeps.

LECTURE HALL
Ever been so bored in I-HUM
lecture that you just wanted to ...
have sex? You're not alone.
And here's something they
don't tell you in ECON 1: Lecture
halls are COMPLETELY EMPTY
at night.

THE OVAL
By day, it's hot, public and covered in itchy, itchy grass. NOT a good
idea. Just ask [name deleted so Intermission doesn't get hate mail].
By night, it's cool, private and inviting, the perfect spot to keep tryst
for those with a voyeuristic flair. Happy camping.

Michael arrived on campus an 18-year
old virgin — not that there's anything
wrong with that — eager to broaden his
sexual horizons. It's not that girls never
liked him, he told himself. It's just, well, ad
mission to Stanford takes a lot of work, and
he was willing to do whatever it took to get
in. Including postponing sex. (Good choice,
moron.)
So he was determined to do everything
he could to get laid. He went to all the frat
parties he could find. There, he learned the
meaning of phrases like "sausage fest,"
"Check out that awkward kid trying to
dance" and "No I will not make out with
you." And unfortunately, we're not talking
about Adam Sandler here. Seriously, no
one would make out with him. It sucked. It
sucked bad.
Michael couldn't understand what the
problem was. He was at the top of his class
in Math 51H and he never missed an I
HUM lecture and... OK, so you've proba
bly guessed it. Michael was a nerd, doomed
to wander the wilderness of abstinence.

WILBUR HALL
OK, so let's be realistic. Sex in Hoover Tower is appealing, but
it poses some pretty significant logistical difficulties. Same goes
for MemChu, the library and your lecture halls. In terms of sim
ple convenince, nothing beats your concrete shoebox in Wilbur.
Just move your roommate's pile of clothes out of the way,
tell her, "Yeah, of course I wash my sheets on a rgular basis,"
and get to work.

Ever tried the argu
ment that "sex in the
presence of God is a
beautiful thing"? Well,
neither have we, and
we're pretty sure it
won't work. It's also
kind of creepy.
Still, give it a shot
and let us know how
your partner responds.
We're pretty sure it'll
be worth it for the
humor value.

Months went by and Michael began to
understand Stanford's 50 percent absti
nence rate. Having sex was really hard. He
began to get desperate. There was this re
ally hot girl who sat next to him in I-HUM
section, but of course she had a boyfriend,
and the girls at the frat parties wouldn't
even look at him, and ... you get the pic
ture. Then one day when he was working
on a PWR 1 project with his partner Molly,
something different happened. He
reached across the table fora book, and
she grabbed his arm, looked deep into his
eyes, and...and... she kissed him.
Michael was taken aback. He barely
knew this girl, he certainly wasn't attracted
to her, he found her in-class comments in
tensely annoying and she wasn't exactly his
type... or anyone's type, he imagined. The
word that came to mind was "frumpy." But
he wasn't exactly male-model material,
and she was just as desperate as he was.
He moved in for another kiss.
