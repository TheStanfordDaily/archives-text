Stanford students are inherently
lazy. You don't "have time" to finish
that problem set or paper or pay your
ITSS bill (late fees start April 31, kids)
or call your latest crush, but you some
how manage to waste hours of time
online. Why not be productive and
add some aesthetics to your life?
Spring fashion finds are closer than
you think — you don't even have to
get up from your bed.
Minnie Wilde (www.niinnie
wilde.com) is a serendipitous find,
worth getting lost in the city for. The
postage stamp-sized boutique is packed
with unique handmade clothing andtac
cessories you won't find anywhere else.
Teri Olsen and Ann D'Apice, Minnie
Wilde's designers, have been known to
bake cupcakes for customers that visit
their San Francisco boutique off of
Hayes Street.
If you're a sucker for unique vin
tage fabric lining, large buttons and
piping like I am. you're in luck. The
Minnie Wilde line is inspired by the
'60s and '70s vintage aesthetic, with
great attention to details and a flatter
ing fit. The Wilde girl is described as
the "Holly Goliehtly for the new mil-

lennium - they design for the girl
who... is going out to define her
self: She stays up a lot and she
might just decide to go out to buy
a pair of shoes instead of paying
the rent." Move over, Marc Ja
cobs — these clothes are perfect
for petite gals and way more af
fordable. Minnie Wilde's one-of
a-kind pieces are a bit pricey but
worth the investment. From
swishy soft cotton yoked skirts to
corduroy motorcycle jackets with
mandarin collars. Minnie Wilde
evokes summer days of roller
skating down the street mixed
with late nights at rock venues,
with their puffed sleeves and sig
nature keyhole tops. Blend with
some hard lemonade, and you
have the perfect outfit.
The easiest way to jazz up your
wardrobe is to not buy a new one,
but to invest wisely in acces
