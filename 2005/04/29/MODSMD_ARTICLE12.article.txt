# Book highlights 100 leaders
## 
### DAVID KUO 
Author Peter Han spoke last night at the Graduate
School of Business as a part of his 10-city book tour pro
moting his book, "Nobodies to Somebodies," for which he
interviewed 1(K) successful and influential leaders, includ
ing Fortune 500 chief executive officers, Nobel laureates.
Pulitzer Prize winners, U.S. senators and leaders of major
nonprofits. The interviews all had one thing in common: a
focus on the formative years of each of their careers.
Han told the audience that the inspiration for the
book came during lunch with a friend, when the topic of
conversation stumbled upon the quintessential ques
tion: "I'm at a crossroads, what am I supposed to do
with my life?"
Alter graduating from Harvard in 199fi. Han worked
lirst at a management consulting firm, then at the Dell
Computer Corporation and finally at a startup company
where he was inspired to write the book.
"I wanted to write this book because many other peo
ple were asking the same questions I was," Han said,
adding that he decided to cover a wide breadth of lead
ers rather than interview one leader in depth.
"I approached 2,000 leaders and had a response from
100," Han said. "I launched huge waves of e-mails and
waited for them to bite back."
With his new full-time job at Microsoft, Han devoted
nights and weekends to writing.
"I had to rearrange my vacation hours in order to con
duct some of the interviews," he said.
Some of the notable personalities Han interviewed
were author Tom Clancy, Sen. Bill Bradley and even

Stanford President John I lennessy. Chief executive offi
cers of Best Buy, Reebok, Delta Airlines, Staples and
Coca-Cola were also included.
Han shed light on some of the book's findings and
shared several interesting anecdotes with the roughly 70
audience members who attended last night's talk.
The book was divided into three categories: finding
one's calling, chasing the dream and using a little magic.
Specifically, the book covers how the leaders developed
their careers and navigated the twists and turns they en
countered during their 20s and 30s.
When asked what all the leaders have in common,
Man said, "It was most important to be open to the un
expected turn." Moreover. Han called many of the lead
ers "equal opportunity learners," people who are willing
to gain knowledge from everyone around them, includ
ing mentors, coaches and parents.
The audience's response to Han's talk was largely
positive and many lingered afterward to purchase the
book and have it signed.
"The talk was very informative and gave a good sur
vey of the book," said Jason Liu, Class of 1997.
Sophomore Debby Chang also said she was pleased
not only by the speech but also Han's passion.
When asked what message he wanted to send to the
Stanford community, Han referenced an interview he
had with Pulitzer Prize winning reporter Paul Salopek:
"Make yourself vulnerable to change, to discomfort, to
the unexpected," Salopek had told him. "And in fact, em
brace it. You'll find that you may not always get what you're
looking for, but in the end, you'll look back and see that
everything eventually adds up to something."
