# Puzzle games have never been so sexy

Puzzle games: the final frontier.
Not many titles have managed to
stay in the hearts of the gamers in the
world. Too many are flat-out gim
micks or imitations of the all-power-

ful "Tetris," whose block
falling, line-building
charm has kept the masses
entranced for the last
decade and a half.
Enter "Polarium." Nin
tendo's newest puzzle title
made exclusively for the
Nintendo DS. The DS is

certainly lacking in quantity of titles
since its release, so "Polarium" has a
real chance to take its place as one of
the must-own games for this unique
platform.
"Polarium" takes full advantage
of the DS's stylus feature. In fact, the
stylus is the only way to control the
game. The premise of the puzzler is

deceptively simple: the player is pre
sented with a tile-filed screen with a
mix of black or white tiles. The play
er is charged with running a line
through the tiles to turn white tiles
black or vice versa. The end result?
Creating horizontal lines of the same
color that will then disappear.

"Polarium" takes this premise and
offers several different game modes
for your enjoyment. Puzzle mode fea
tures one hundred increasingly com
plex puzzles that you've got to solve
with a single stroke of the stylus. This is
definitely the meat of the game, as
these puz/les will rack your brain and
provide many hours of complex, philo

sophical thought (of course, hints are
available for all you non-geniuses).
Another great feature of Puzzle
mode is the ability to create your own
puzzles and then share them with
friends (either wirelessly or by generat
ing a complex password to distribute)
for them to solve. It's a nice addition

that definitely adds some playing time
to those folks that manage to solve all
the pre-set puzzles.
On the other side of "Polarium" is a
challenge mode that tries to offer a
more lengthy playing session time a la
"Tetris." Blocks fall from the top of the
screen (the dual screen setup actually
lets you see very far ahead of the play

ing field), and the goal is for the player
to try and eliminate as many blocks as
they can before the top overfills with
blocks. Unfortunately, the game
doesn't do very well in this depart
ment, as challenge mode begins with
the exactly same "puzzles" over and
over again, so doing well is just a mat-

ter of memorizing where all the blocks
fall.
Finally, like any good puzy.ler,
"Polarium" features a multiplaver
mode that allows players to go head
to-head. Wirelessly. (Did I men
tions the DS is really cool?) This is
where the game shines, as it thrusts
you into a battle of speed and wits.

Like so many multi-player puzzlers,
each player tries to make more and
more blocks appear on their oppo
nents screen hv doing well on his
own side. Also, multiplaver only re
quires one cartridge, which is a huge
plus.
The rest of "Polarium's" quali-

ties arc, unfor
tunately, sparse.
The graphics are
minimal, the
sound is average
(hardly any
music!) and the
control is basi
cally what you

J J
make of it, with everything relying
on your skill with the stylus. But as
a puzzle title, "Polarium" does
well. This is a much-needed addi
tion to the Nintendo DS's arsenal,
and it's highly recommended for
any puzzle freaks out there. Just
don't blow a gasket trying to figure
out the puzzles.
