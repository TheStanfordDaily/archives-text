## Coachella: Non-Vegas fun in the desert 
### WILL OREMUS INTERMISSION COACHELLA EXPERT 
You already know whether you like that skinny Coldplay guy
who tries to force way too much meaning into the word "Yellow."
You've heard Nine Inch Nails "Closer" so many times that your
whole existence is flawed. And you don't need Intermission to tell
you whether it's worth checking out Wilco or Wee/.er.
But what's the deal with those dozens of other bands on the bill
whose names are in smaller print on Coachella.com? Did you know
that Matmos, for instance, recorded an album based on sounds
recorded during medical procedures, including liposuction and
nose jobs? I didn't, until I looked them up about two minutes ago.
One of Coachella's unique pleasures is the possibility of stum
bling upon a brilliant act you had never heard of before. Almost as

categories.

WTF?!
Lots of bands just take the same old
crap and put it in a shiny new wrapper,
but some of this year's Coachella bands
are legitimately unusual. Nova Scotia's
Buck 65 used to do sample-based under
ground hip-hop. but on his last album he
emerged as an avatar of folk rap. and per
haps the only musician to evoke both
Bob Dylan and Public Enemy's Chuck
D. The Fiery Furnaces are a love-them
or-hate-them brother-sister team whose
bloopy concept album "Blueberry Boat"
veers between cheery kid-pop and prog
rock. Sage Francis's delivery is abrasive,
bordering on combative, and mind-twist -
ingly intelligent. Last year at Coachella
he wore a monk's robe and dramatically
put the hood up and down at opportune
times. The Dresden Dolls have been
called "cabaret punk," and though they
don't really sound like punk or cabaret,
the label still seems to fit. When I played
Wolf Eyes in the Intermission office,
Brendan protested, "This isn't music!"
Tam said it would be the perfect sound
track to a nightmare about getting a root
canal, sans anasthesia. I met the Blood
Brothers at a party once and they seemed
like upstanding young fellows, not at all
the type to record demonic hits like "Love
Rhvrnes with Hideous Car Wreck."

driving into Las Vegas at dawn, and it was per
fect - glitzy and sinister. Four Tet and Boom
Bip arrange disorienting beatscapes that are

heavy on bass, with the former favoring eerie
piano lines and the latter tending toward big

drums. Diplo is a genre-splicing hip-hop DJ
who earned underground fame for his col
laboration with M.I.A. who will also be per
forming.

Worth the hype

Of all the new groups being hailed as the next saviors of rock n roll, a few are actually
talented. The daughter of some reputedly badass Tamil revolutionary, London s M.I.A.

accurately, British grime artists like Dizzee Rascal. And she's a hottie. Also from Britain,
Bloc Party are being called this year's Franz Ferdinand, but they play with more sonic lay
ering and technical proficiency and less flamboyance. They reference the C ure, but their
show is sure to surpass last year's lackadaisical headlining performance by Robert Smith
and Co. And yes, they're also better-looking - but who isn tC ritics pets The Arcade I'ire

with ridiculous string arrangements - in a/good way. If I could have found a ticket lor less
than $70 on Craig's List, 1 would have skipped my ski trip to see them in the city. Two

friends who went say I made the wrong choice.

fun is stumbling upon a band that sounds incomparably and unfor
gettably godawful.
That happened to me last year when I stumbled (literally, be
cause it was 110 degrees out) into the show's smallest tent and
found myself in the presence of Erase Errata. They sounded like a
group of four-year-olds throwing an extended tantrum in the
dumpster out back of Sam Ash.
A friend who is way hipper than me later informed me that
Erase Errata are in fact the Bay Area's foremost practitioners of
post-feminist no-wave experimentalism. Which, to me, highlighted
the importance of knowing something about a band BEFORE
spending precious Coachella-hours listening to them. So here is a
brief guide to some of this year's lesser-known acts, helpfully bro-

ken down into boldfaced and capitalized pseudo-

Mindless entertainment

If you're not into the whole "originality" thing, there are plenty of
acts that provide midless fun, mostly of the retro variety - these groups
tend to use the word "The"in front of their band names. The Bravery is
the latest NYC*band to update the '80s alternative sound, with key
boards and darkly shiny choruses reminiscent of the Killers (who by the
way played to a tiny crowd at Coachella last year before they blew up).
I would say that The Raveonettes sound like The Jesus and Mary Chain
covering The Shangri-Las, but if you're enough of a music nerd to get
that reference then you probably already knew what The Raveonettes
sounded like. They're a Swedish boy-girl duo who play 19505-style

pop with heavily distorted guitars. The Faint, from Omaha, em-

ploy cheap-sounding synthesizers to make ambiguously iron-

ic Goth-Dance-Rock, "Which is even more fun than you'd
think. Tegan and Sara make sticky-sweet indie pop, but

the twin sisters sound so damn adorable you're tempted
to forgive them.

Blips, Bloops 'n' Beats

For those who find actual instruments to be
passe, Coachella this year will offer plenty of elec
tronic noise to complement your shrooming ex
perience. 1 put MB3 in my car's CD player while

Proven talent
There are plenty of established acts with whom you can't
go wrong. Maybe most exciting is Block Star, a.k.a. Mos Def
and Talib Kweli, who would be hands-down the best hip
hop duo in the world if it weren't fora couple freaks from
ATL named Big Boi and Andre. Aesop Rock spits hip-hop
poetry so dense you might have to stop bobbing your head
in order to parse it. Spoon and Pinback play brilliant, mini
malist indie rock. Listening to Mercury Rev is like overdos
ing on helium. If you haven't heard of Cafe Tacuba it's only
because the eclectic Mexico City alt-rock legends don't
record in English. And Bright Eyes - OK, you can go wrong

with Bright Eyes, because he wears everything on his

sleeve, including snot - but if you love the kid, you really
love him. Kcanc and Snow Patrol should delight any-

one who was pleased by the selection of Coldplay as

a headlining act. Masked rapper MF Doom's odd
ball flow drives the hip-hop kids wild, but if

you don't already know the words, they

are sort of difficult to understand
through the mask he wears on

stage. MF stands for "metal
face," naturally.

Surprises?
Lastly, don't forget to look
out for surprise performers.
Last year. Beck played. This
year, rumors include every
one from the White Stripes to
Bruce Springsteen. But if the
crowds are anything like last
year, you may want to skip
the surprise and see Matmos
instead.

fun is stumbling upon a band that sounds incomparably and unfor
gettably godawful.
That happened to me last year when I stumbled (literally, be
cause it was 110 degrees out) into the show's smallest tent and
found myself in the presence of Erase Errata. They sounded like a
group of four-year-olds throwing an extended tantrum in the
dumpster out back of Sam Ash.
A friend who is way hipper than me later informed me that
Erase Errata are in fact the Bay Area's foremost practitioners of
post-feminist no-wave experimentalism. Which, to me, highlighted
the importance of knowing something about a band BEFORE
spending precious Coachella-hours listening to them. So here is a
brief guide to some of this year's lesser-known acts, helpfully bro-

ken down into boldfaced and capitalized pseudo-

Mindless entertainment

If you're not into the whole "originality" thing, there are plenty of
acts that provide midless fun, mostly of the retro variety - these groups
tend to use the word "The"in front of their band names. The Bravery is
the latest NYC*band to update the '80s alternative sound, with key
boards and darkly shiny choruses reminiscent of the Killers (who by the
way played to a tiny crowd at Coachella last year before they blew up).
I would say that The Raveonettes sound like The Jesus and Mary Chain
covering The Shangri-Las, but if you're enough of a music nerd to get
that reference then you probably already knew what The Raveonettes
sounded like. They're a Swedish boy-girl duo who play 19505-style

pop with heavily distorted guitars. The Faint, from Omaha, em-

ploy cheap-sounding synthesizers to make ambiguously iron-

ic Goth-Dance-Rock, "Which is even more fun than you'd
think. Tegan and Sara make sticky-sweet indie pop, but

the twin sisters sound so damn adorable you're tempted
to forgive them.

Blips, Bloops 'n' Beats

For those who find actual instruments to be
passe, Coachella this year will offer plenty of elec
tronic noise to complement your shrooming ex
perience. 1 put MB3 in my car's CD player while

Proven talent
There are plenty of established acts with whom you can't
go wrong. Maybe most exciting is Block Star, a.k.a. Mos Def
and Talib Kweli, who would be hands-down the best hip
hop duo in the world if it weren't fora couple freaks from
ATL named Big Boi and Andre. Aesop Rock spits hip-hop
poetry so dense you might have to stop bobbing your head
in order to parse it. Spoon and Pinback play brilliant, mini
malist indie rock. Listening to Mercury Rev is like overdos
ing on helium. If you haven't heard of Cafe Tacuba it's only
because the eclectic Mexico City alt-rock legends don't
record in English. And Bright Eyes - OK, you can go wrong

with Bright Eyes, because he wears everything on his

sleeve, including snot - but if you love the kid, you really
love him. Kcanc and Snow Patrol should delight any-

one who was pleased by the selection of Coldplay as

a headlining act. Masked rapper MF Doom's odd
ball flow drives the hip-hop kids wild, but if

you don't already know the words, they

are sort of difficult to understand
through the mask he wears on

stage. MF stands for "metal
face," naturally.

Surprises?
Lastly, don't forget to look
out for surprise performers.
Last year. Beck played. This
year, rumors include every
one from the White Stripes to
Bruce Springsteen. But if the
crowds are anything like last
year, you may want to skip
the surprise and see Matmos
instead.

You already know whether you like that skinny Coldplay guy
who tries to force way too much meaning into the word "Yellow."
You've heard Nine Inch Nails "Closer" so many times that your
whole existence is flawed. And you don't need Intermission to tell
you whether it's worth checking out Wilco or Wee/.er.
But what's the deal with those dozens of other bands on the bill
whose names are in smaller print on Coachella.com? Did you know
that Matmos, for instance, recorded an album based on sounds
recorded during medical procedures, including liposuction and
nose jobs? I didn't, until I looked them up about two minutes ago.
One of Coachella's unique pleasures is the possibility of stum
bling upon a brilliant act you had never heard of before. Almost as

categories.

WTF?!
Lots of bands just take the same old
crap and put it in a shiny new wrapper,
but some of this year's Coachella bands
are legitimately unusual. Nova Scotia's
Buck 65 used to do sample-based under
ground hip-hop. but on his last album he
emerged as an avatar of folk rap. and per
haps the only musician to evoke both
Bob Dylan and Public Enemy's Chuck
D. The Fiery Furnaces are a love-them
or-hate-them brother-sister team whose
bloopy concept album "Blueberry Boat"
veers between cheery kid-pop and prog
rock. Sage Francis's delivery is abrasive,
bordering on combative, and mind-twist -
ingly intelligent. Last year at Coachella
he wore a monk's robe and dramatically
put the hood up and down at opportune
times. The Dresden Dolls have been
called "cabaret punk," and though they
don't really sound like punk or cabaret,
the label still seems to fit. When I played
Wolf Eyes in the Intermission office,
Brendan protested, "This isn't music!"
Tam said it would be the perfect sound
track to a nightmare about getting a root
canal, sans anasthesia. I met the Blood
Brothers at a party once and they seemed
like upstanding young fellows, not at all
the type to record demonic hits like "Love
Rhvrnes with Hideous Car Wreck."

driving into Las Vegas at dawn, and it was per
fect - glitzy and sinister. Four Tet and Boom
Bip arrange disorienting beatscapes that are

heavy on bass, with the former favoring eerie
piano lines and the latter tending toward big

drums. Diplo is a genre-splicing hip-hop DJ
who earned underground fame for his col
laboration with M.I.A. who will also be per
forming.

Worth the hype

Of all the new groups being hailed as the next saviors of rock n roll, a few are actually
talented. The daughter of some reputedly badass Tamil revolutionary, London s M.I.A.
makes political pop backed by dirty, stuttering beats reminiscent of Missy Elliott or, more
accurately, British grime artists like Dizzee Rascal. And she's a hottie. Also from Britain,
