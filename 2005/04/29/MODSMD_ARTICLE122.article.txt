# Roxy reveals the first-annual 'Big 5 Challenge'
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS, BOOKWORM 
Spring is in the air! Warm weather, sloshball
and tanned bodies lying in the sun. Roxy al
ways gets nostalgic spring quarter, with anoth
er year coming to an end. Seniors, not to scare
you, but there are only six weeks left in your
collegiate career. Staying up "til 4, sleeping 'til
noon and drinking on Tuesdays are all going to
end June 12. Well, that is, unless you get scared
of the real world and come back as a grad stu-

dent. Then again, who am I

kidding? Grad students don't

have fun. However, they do

spend hours in the libraries and
that got Roxy thinking about the
good ol' days.

Roxy's spent a fair amount of time
in the libraries during her tenure here,
and she wasn't reading books. Now I
want to fill you in on a secret and issue a

challenge at the same time. I'm talking about
the "Big 5 Challenge." Yep, the ultimate

gauntlet in sexual academia. Roxy
and a few very special friends are the
only people known to complete the
"Big 5." This adventure involves
knocking boots in all of the five
I major libraries on campus. Name
| ly: Green, Meyer, the Medical Li
brary, Jackson (the Business Li-

brary) and the Law Library. That
was the secret. The challenge is to find

yourself a partner (or partners), get a

map and start checking names off the list.

I'm an advice columnist,
so I can't just issue a chal
lenge and not help you
complete it. Here are some
tips for completing the "Big
5." First of all, having sex in
the library is likely to be
frowned upon by some
body. So the challenging
part of all this is handling it
in stealth-mode. Girls, wear

a skirt. Do not wear un
derwear. We all under
stand the human body,
and if you're going to get
some sweet sweet lovin'
between the stacks in a
short time-frame, excess
clothing is clearly the
enemy.
Guys, ixnay on the
undies as well. Heck, the
girls aren't wearing
them, you don't need
them and you're having
sex in a library. I thought
you were cool, don't
prove me wrong. The
guys will also want to
wear clothing that can
easily be removed.
Something with a zipper,

mesh shorts, whatever. Just avoid the button
fly jeans this time, okay? Remember, you want
to be able to get it off quick. Once the deed is
done you'll need to get dressed just as fast and
get back to studying.
Too easy for you. Miss Jenna Jameson?
Well then, for extra credit, 1 suggest you try the
lesser-known libraries on campus. The crown
jewel of all: the math library, a.k.a. la bibliote
ca del diablo. The math library is, in fact, a sin
gle room in Building 380. Even Roxy almost
got caught there. Do it there and you've prac
tically bought yourself a ticket to ride the
Bangbus.
If you've read this far, I trust you're on your
way to Green Library right now. For all the
ProFros in town this weekend, it's the big
building next to that funny showerhead-look
ing fountain thing. If any of you pull off the
challenge this weekend ... well I just don't
think it's possible. Go ahead, prove Roxy
wrong. I dare you.
See you in the stacks!
