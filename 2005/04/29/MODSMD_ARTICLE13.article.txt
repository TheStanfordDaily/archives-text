### LI TAO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"Normal people write hut crazy people have 'writ
ings/ " said Dave Eggers, author of "A Heartbreaking
Work of Staggering Genius" and "You Shall Know
Our Velocity," on Wednesday night during his talk on
the link between art and politics. Eggers began by ad
mitting that he was "not always a political person" and
that it took some time for him to realize how politics
affected him personally.
In April 2002, Eggers started a project dubbed 826
Valencia, a writing lab for high school students, in San
Francisco. Since its founding, the program has grown
to include other activities, including filmmaking, song
writing and writing college-admission essays with help
from professionals.
Through his tutoring. Eggers said that he was able
to see how policies, such as the No Child Left Behind
Act. impact students.
The event included presentations by several of Eg
gers friends who are famous in their own right.
Filmmaker Spike Jonze. director of the films
"Being John Malkovich" and "Adaptation." showed
the audience a documentary he made during the De
mocratic National Convention in 2000 on a day in the
life of presidential hopeful A1 Gore.
During the filming, Jonze visited Gore's house in
Tennessee in the morning and was invited join him on
vacation to North Carolina.
"It was a chance to see the human side of him." Jonze
said. "He is an honorable family man with a solid family."
The documentary was not shown during televised

coverage of the DNC and was relegated to "a single
TV on the convention floor." Although NBC Night
line offered to broadcast Jonze's work on national TV,
he declined.
He noted that the project "illustrated the power that
filmmakers have on politics" and "when to get involved."
Filmmaker David O. Russell, director of the film
"Three Kings," presented several clips from his 2(X)4 doc
umentary "Soldier's Pay" for which he interviewed sol
diers, generals and psychologists working in Iraq.
Among those featured in the documentary was a group
of soldiers from a supply unit that looted several hundred
thousand dollars in cash from a building in Baghdad.
"Real life mirrors fiction," Russell said, comparing
"Soldier's Pay" with "Three Kings," which also fo
cused on looting. The documentary highlights situa
tions "when soldiers don't have adequate armor and
equipment." he added.
Because the documentary was produced close to
presidential elections. Warner Bros, would not allow it
to be included at the beginning of the DVD re-release
of "Three Kings," as Russell had originally planned.
The third speaker, comedian Patton Oswalt, who
has appeared on Comedy Central, commented on
America's political orientation.
"Bush is not dumb — he's evil." Oswalt said before
spearing both liberal and conservative radio stations, as
well as actor Mel Gibson's film "ITie Passion of the Christ."
After Oswalt's performance, Eggers presented
high school students Jose Martinez and Amanda
Wolffenbuttel with 826 Valencia's Irving Hochman
Scholarships, each worth $ 1 ().()()() to be applied to
ward college tuition.
