## San Jose is so not worth Googling 
### 
Google — it's today's dominant search en
gine, the home page for numerous computer
users across the nation and the first place you
turn to for research when you're too lazy to do
real research using credible sources in some place
called a library.
We're all familiar with those colorful letters
on the Web site, which features pretty cartoon
animations around the holidays. You probably
even have some fond memories of googling your
own name to gauge how famous you are or
Googling your friends' names to, um, research
them
Google has grown so insanely popular that
even its strange name is now commonly used as a
verb (example: "Let me Google that for you").
And that's a sure sign of success, putting
"Google" up there amongst the ranks of other ac
complished words or nouns-turned-verbs, such
as "Xerox."
But now Google's expanding its franchise in
an attempt to top its own popularity. Following
its search engine came the cleverly named
Froogle for buying stuff, the not so cleverly
named Google News for news and now the new
Google Maps for, well, maps. Or at least it's new
to me.

I hadn't ever used Google
Maps before, partly because
there's no link to it from the
Google home page, partly be
cause I rarely go to places to
which I would need directions.-
But this past weekend, I
had the opportunity to try out
Google Maps when my room
mate and I happened to ob
tain a car and decided to take a
cruise ... .to San Jose.

Now, the question probably arises: "Why San
Jose?" 1 have no idea. Clearly, we knew nothing
about San Jose. We probably thought it sounded
a lot like "San Francisco" or "San Diego," so we
figured it was probably a decent city.
But in any case, we were on our way to San
Jose and thought we?d go see a movie at the Cin
earcs, the local movie theater. So while we were
in the car 1 had a friend use google Maps to find
directions. I was extremely disappointed by the
results.
Not only did Google Maps fail to recognize
the location "Cinearcs" or "that movie theater in
San Jose," it continually insisted that my friend
include the street address in the destination box.
What's the point of "map-googling" it if it
doesn't know where the Cinearcs is? If someone
types in "Cinearcs," it should know where the
damn Cinearcs is. There's nothing special about
Google maps otherwise.
If 1 have to type in some sort of "address" for
my destination point, then 1 may as well use
Yahoo or — dare I say it — an actual hardcopy
map.
Those sly ones at Google try to trick you, try
to make you think you're using some new magi
cal tool. The little balloons over the destination
points give you the impression of 3-D vision, as if
you're free floating over the glorious street ways
of Menlo Park and Fremont.
And the fact that you can move around the
maps just by dragging your mouse makes you feel
powerful, like you control the land, like God or
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
But I was not God. I was not Arnold
Schwarzenegger. 1 was lost.
Even the cast of "Lost" was nowhere near as
lost as we were in San Jose. At least those char
acters were equipped with all kinds of survival re
sources like transmitters and John Locke, the
crazy wilderness guy who hunts boars.
Plus, they got to chill on a tropical island in the
summer, even if it was a thousand miles off
course and inhabited by a monster. All we had
were bad directions from Google Maps (we final
ly got directions after entering an actual address)
and the city of San Jose.
And let me take a moment here to dwell on
San Jose. How can I relate to you the essence of
this city? The mysterious island on "Lost" with
the crazy Frenchwoman, wild boars, an eerie
soundtrack that plays whenever the unseen mon
ster comes to feed on people, and the blood and
gore that's spattered around to imply that the
monster has eaten said people — that's kind of
what San Jose was like.
It's a cold, barren land that's inhabited by
strange people, none of whom know where the
Cinearcs is. In terms of architectural beauty and
design, San Jose rivals the better known parts of
other big cities. They usually call those parts the
"ghetto" or "The Projects."
And it's because of this time we spent wan
dering the hell-hole that is San Jose that I've
turned against Google Maps and their horrible
directions. Maybe if I'd spent my time being lost
in a more hospitable place like Santa Cruz or, say,
Hawaii, I'd be a little more sympathetic to
Google Maps.
I will say, though, that even if the maps suck,
Google's satellite feature is pretty damn cool.
Many a time have I wasted on that satellite, map
googling my own location, friends' locations, my
own location again and other sites of interest just
to see a real aerial shot of the area.
In fact, I'd say Google Maps has the potential
to turn into the next stalkerish past-time among
college kids, up there with the high ranks of
www.Thefacebook.com, AIM and actual real
life stalking.
So I highly recommend the satellite. But be
wary of Google Maps and the driving directions
it gives you. And stay away from San Jose.

It's a cold, barren land that's inhabited by
strange people, none of whom know where the
Cinearcs is. In terms of architectural beauty and
design, San Jose rivals the better known parts of
other big cities. They usually call those parts the
"ghetto" or "The Projects."
And it's because of this time we spent wan
dering the hell-hole that is San Jose that I've
turned against Google Maps and their horrible
directions. Maybe if I'd spent my time being lost
in a more hospitable place like Santa Cruz or, say,
Hawaii, I'd be a little more sympathetic to
Google Maps.
I will say, though, that even if the maps suck,
Google's satellite feature is pretty damn cool.
Many a time have I wasted on that satellite, map
googling my own location, friends' locations, my
own location again and other sites of interest just
to see a real aerial shot of the area.
In fact, I'd say Google Maps has the potential
to turn into the next stalkerish past-time among
college kids, up there with the high ranks of
www.Thefacebook.com, AIM and actual real
life stalking.
So I highly recommend the satellite. But be
wary of Google Maps and the driving directions
it gives you. And stay away from San Jose.

Do you stax away from San Jose, too? E-mail Shiv
