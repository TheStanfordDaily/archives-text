# Admit Weekend: The real thing or just an act?
## 
### VICTORIA DEGTYAREVA STAFF WRITER 
Many Stanford students have
fond memories from Admit Week
end — spending time with their
RoHos, going to the CoHo for the
first time and FoHo-ing (that?s
fountain hopping, for you ProFros)
in the Claw. But Admit Weekend is
more than just an introduction to
crazy, acronymic "Stanford Speak."
It was a time to form first impres
sions of the University and making
that important final decision of
which school to attend.
Before coming to Admit Week
end. many prospective freshmen's
knowledge of the University was
limited to the stereotypically Cali
fornian image of sun, beaches and
palm trees.
"Since I'm from lowa, I was real
ly excited because I thought the
campus would be really close to
water," said senior Ritu Sarin. "I was
really disappointed when I found
out that we were far away from all of
the beaches and that 'Lake Lag' was
more of a swamp than a lake."
Many out-of-state students recall
that they shared Sarin's disappoint
ment with the University's location.
"Before I came to Admit Week
end I thought Stanford would be
sunny, happy and have lots of swim
ming and outdoor activities," said
freshman Jon O'Bryan, a Kentucky
native.
"Stanford really misrepresented
itself during Admit Weekend on the
huge amounts of rain it gets," fresh
man Summer Jackson joked. "It also
really under-stressed what a horrible
waste of time 1-Muni is."
Other students were surprised by
the sheer size of the campus.
"I wish I had a campus map dur
ing Admit Weekend so I wouldn't
have had to make a two-and-a-half
hour walk of shame from Roble
back to Wilhur." said freshman Kat
Lewin. "1 somehow found my way to
the Bookstore, joined a guided tour,
ended up at Memorial Auditorium
and 1 was still completely lost."
Admit Weekend also gave stu
dents a chance to test the myths they
had heard about both the social and
academic scenes at the University.

"At first 1 thought that students
would spend all of their free time
studying or doing hardcore pro
jects," Jackson said. "At Admit
Weekend, however, 1 discovered
that even though Stanford students
are exceedingly intelligent, they
don't feel the need to lord it over ev
eryone at every moment. They can
have conversations about the cur
rent political situation in Lebanon
and Syria, but they can also choose
to talk about that really funny
episode of 'The Family Guy' they
have seen recently."
Jackson recalled a night during
Admit Weekend when she saw one
of her RoHos coming back from
working on an engineering project at
5 a.m.
"This experience showed me that
students do work really hard, but
they're also really cool, normal peo
ple," she said.

While for most students Admit
Weekend dispelled the "nerd myth"
they had associated with Stanford,
O'Bryan found that his impression
of the social atmosphere at Admit
Weekend was less than satisfying.
"Coming out of Admit Weekend
I expected Stanford to have a really
crappy social scene and weak par
ties," he said. "But after I actually
enrolled in the fall. I realized that the
social scene isn't the worst — there
are better things than parties and ev
eryone is helpful and nice to fresh
men."
In contrast, freshman Sherrie
Chung said that Admit Weekend ac
tually set her expectations for the
University's social atmosphere too
high.
"I think 1 just got lucky at Admit
Weekend because I met a lot of real
ly cool people I clicked with right
away," she said. "So, compared to

Admit Weekend, Orientation was
like hell because it was really drawn
out, we were herded around every
where and 1 didn't seem to click with
anyone right away. But as the year
went on, it got a lot better."
Many students recall that they
were surprised by how happy every
one at Stanford seemed to be during
Admit Weekend.
"Although 1 thought everyone 1
met at Admit Weekend was very
genuine. 1 guess some people
thought some students were faking
how happy they were here," said
freshman Danny Arbeiter. "But, in
fact, what they say about the people
at Stanford is totally true. For the
most part, people really are happy
here all the time. For example, a few
days ago. I saw a girl skipping — yes,
skipping — down the hall, for no ap
parent reason. That's how happy
Stanford students are."
