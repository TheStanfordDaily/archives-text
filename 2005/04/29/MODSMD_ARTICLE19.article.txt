# Students should beware the power of plastic

(U-WI RE) WACO. Tex. — Visa — it's every
where you want to be. But should you really use
it?
"When we have credit cards, we spend more
money," Dr. James Roberts, associate professor
of marketing, said.
Roberts worked with professors around the
country researching spending habits of students in
schools around the nation. Roberts found that
compulsive buying is linked to misusing credit
cards — particularly with students.
"Credit is a very scary thing for college stu
dents because it's very easy to fall into the debt
trap," Millie Bittenbinder, a Temple sophomore,
said.
With credit cards, it is much easier for students
to "just charge it"and buy more expensive items
now, rather than waiting. The average student
graduates with between $3,000 and $4,000 in cred

it card debt. Some students in the survey owed
more than $7.(XX).
According to the national marketing study
Roberts worked with, an estimated two-thirds of
undergraduate students have at least one credit
card.
"The majority of students use credit cards fair
ly reasonably, but there is still a good share — a
growing share — [who) don't," Roberts said.
Part of the problem lies with schools that allow
credit card companies to advertise on campus.
Certain fund-raisers students participate in give
organizations money to sign people up for credit
cards.
"We have credit cards shoved down our
throats." Bittenbinder said. "I get at least 10 cred
it card offers in the mail a month."
Allowing payments for tuition has also in
creased the credit problem.
"Sadly, the way a lot of people intend to use a
credit card is not the way they actually use it." Dr.
financial consultant Franklin Potts, associate pro

fessor of finance, said.
Often people don't even realize how much
they have put on a credit card until the bill comes
in at the end of the month.
"I got credit cards for emergencies, and I
ended up using them for shopping and going out
to eat," Katie Johnson, a Sugar Land senior, said.
Johnson has five credit cards, including a cou
ple of store charge cards.
When using cash, a check or a debit card, the
money is immediately taken from the bank ac
count and a more careful record is kept of pur
chases, according to Roberts. With credit cards,
there is usually little-to-no thought or hesitatipn
about the price.
"Credit card companies count on human nature,"
Potts said. "It's very easy to lay out that plastic."
In the study, Roberts found that the students
who use cash could tell within a few dollars how
much money they spent at the bookstore.
"There is no immediate depletion of wealth
when you use a credit card," Roberts said.
