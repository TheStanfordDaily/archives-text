# Senate reviews report on female representation in faculty
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Even as admissions officers herald the most diverse
class of admitted undergraduate students, the Universi
ty continues to struggle when it comes to increasing the
representation of women and minorities on its faculty.
A report presented at yesterday's Faculty Senate
meeting by the Office of the Provost detailed minor
gains in the numbers of minorities and women over the
past year, but most agreed that this growth rate is dis
heartening.
As of September, women made up 23 percent of Stan
ford's faculty —just 0.4 percentage points more than a
year before. Minority representation grew by the same
amount, from 16.8 percent to 17.2 percent.
In an interview with The Daily, Vice Provost for Fac
ulty Development Pat Jones, who presented the report,
called the results "somewhat disappointing."
"The amount of growth in the representation of fac
ulty of color has been slow except for Asians," she said.
The number of Asian faculty members grew by 7.6 per-
cent, compared with a 2.2 percent
drop in black faculty members and a
1.7 percent increase in Hispanics.
Overall, 11.1 percent of the facul
ty is now Asian. 2.5 percent is black.
3.4 percent is Hispanic and just 0.2
percent is Native American.
Women have increased their ab
solute numbers in all types of faculty
positions, from the non-tenure line
professorships to the fully tenured.

although men continue to be hired at
a faster rate. For instance, 14 men re
ceived tenure between Sept. 2003
and Sept. 2004 and only b women re
ceived this status, a fact that is "quite
surprising and not something we'd
hoped for," Jones said.
She lauded Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Sharon Long for head
ing the only school to offer tenure to
women last year. In contrast, the
medical school awarded five tenure
positions — all to men.
Still, she pointed out, much
progress has been .made since 10
years ago, when women made up
only 17.1 percent of the faculty and

minorities made up just 13.1 percent.
And a discourse on faculty diver
sity wouldn't be complete without
mention of Larry Summers, Har
vard's president who made contro
versial comments about innate dif
ferences between the sexes in studies
of math and sciences during a speech
earlier this year.
"We still have some people at
Stanford who would give Larry Sum
mers a run for his money," said Com
puter Science Prof. Eric Roberts.
Law Prof. Deborah Rhode also
joked that Harvard is trying to re
cruit more female faculty by creating
a Department of Home Economics.
