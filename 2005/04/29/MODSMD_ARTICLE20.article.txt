# Drug used to focus comes with dose of nasty side effects
## Students depend on Adderall 
### GABRIELLE SHOSHAN JESSICA BRIGANTI DAILY TARGUM 
(U-WIRE) NEW BRUNSWICK. N.J. —Adder-
all — a prescription drug designed to treat attention
deficit disorder in children and adults — has become a
part of everyday life for many college students, who
use it not for ADD, but to help them study and some
times just to relax.
Doctors are prescribing the drug more than ever, in
some cases to college students who don't need the
treatment, which seems to be the root of the Adderall
craze.
"It was simple," Rutgers University senior Jeff
Ghusson said. "I went to a child psychiatrist in my
hometown. I admitted to him that I've taken Adderall
before, and it helped me study."
Ghusson's doctor then gave him a written test.
One of the questions he recalled was, "Do you look
out the window while in class?" Another part of the
test asked Ghusson to record his past study habits and
sleeping patterns.
"I knew what answers he was looking for, so I lied,"
Ghusson said.
Dr. Michael Spano of Bridgeport. Conn., considers
himself conservative when it comes to prescribing
medication. But he said, "sometimes it is hard to tell if
the patient's concerns are genuine or not."
Adderall is most often prescribed for people diag
nosed with attention deficit disorder and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, and in some instances,
narcolepsy, a pharmacist at the Shopßite pharmacy in
Marlboro, N.J., said.
Even so, these pills have found their way into the
hands of students for purposes other than intended.
"Adderall definitely helps while studying," said ju
nior Elise Cece, "But [after a while], you take it be
cause you want to, not because you have to study. It
just makes you feel good. It's like a cup of coffee with
a twist."
Students take Adderall fora variety of reasons: to
increase concentration in class, to aid them with their
homework or when cramming all night for an exam.
"It's a performance-enhancing drug," said Med
sOnline.com.
Others become dependent on the pills, believing
they can attribute their improved grades to taking
Adderall.
"After I saw the effects Adderall had on me when I
studied and the improvement in my grades, I don't
think I can do as well without it," said Jason Wilhelm,
a junior at the University of Rhode Island.
Spano said, "A lot of the tests for ADD are target
ed for children, and if a college student is lying just to
receive a prescription, the test will not stop them."
Even if there was a way to recognize when Adder

all is genuinely needed, college students can continue
to obtain it by other means.
For example, Rutgers junior Sue Fichtel buys pills
from other students with ADD.
Regarding a friend who sells her Adderall,
Fitchel said, "Basically, what she does is fill one
prescription on her insurance then goes to another
pharmacy and fills [the same prescription] but off
insurance [paying in cash]. Her doctor is an idiot
and prescribes her 90 pills a month, which is way
too much."
Fitchel said she pays her friend face value for the
pills, about $ 120, the cost the pharmacy charges for the
generic brand.
She estimates that is about $1.34 per pill.
The effects of Adderall last about six hours per
dose and remain active in the body longer than a dose
of Ritalin.
Online pharmacies such as LegalMedsOnline.com
have become popular in the last few years. Using
them, students can get their hands on a large variety of
drugs, including Adderall.
When ordering medication from this site, after
one has selected his drug of choice and proceed to
checkout, the first thing the site asks for is contact
and shipping information and a credit card number.
The site claims a prescription is required but can be
provided by one of their many online consultants. An
other online pharmacy, ePharmacylndex.com,
doesn't even require a prior prescription.
Because any doctor can prescribe Adderall, many
doctors and patients might not be as aware of the dan
ger signs as a trained psychiatrist would.
"It is part of our curriculum to learn how to treat
ADHD." said Dr. Najmi Shaikh, a psychiatrist and
director of medical health at Hurtado Health Cen
ter at the Rutgers College Avenue campus. "Psy
chiatrists were trained to diagnose symptoms of
ADHD. Not all doctors know the depth of the ill
ness as a trained psychiatrist would. It is very dan
gerous and should be taken with extreme caution
and under physician care."
Possible side effects of Adderall, as listed on
Drugs.com, include: restlessness, tremors, anxiety,
nervousness, headache, dizziness, insomnia, dryness
of the mouth, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, constipa
tion, impotence, changes in sex drive, decreased ap
petite, irritability, nausea, tics, allergic reactions,
panic, confusion, aggressiveness, increased blood
pressure and heart rate, blurred vision, abnormal
thinking, hallucinations, extreme fatigue, mental de
pression, physical and psychological dependence
and seizures, and in some cases it can cause serious
harm resulting in death.
Shaikh recommends alternative drugs such as
Strattera and more natural methods to help cope with
problems associated with concentration.
