OK, breathe.
The three minutes you're taking to
read this editorial could he the only three
minutes of personal time you'll have all
weekend — we're serious. That's the
beauty (or curse) of Admit Weekend.
Every hour of the day there's something
for you to do: a dean's talk at 2 p.m., a fac
ulty panel at 3 p.m., the activities fair at 4
p.m., dorm icebreaker at 5 p.m., dinner at
6 p.m. You get the picture (or at least
you're nodding your head).
All weekend long, you'll hear a lot of
people tell you how great you are and how
great Stanford is. Both are true. You
worked hard for years to get into Stanford;
80 percent of you had a grade point aver
age of 4.0 or above. Stanford has earned its
bragging rights, too, and you'll be told
why. .. constantly. The academics and re
search are top-notch; you'll learn a lot
from your professors and your peers. But
you know all of this already — that's why
you applied, right?
So let us tell you something you will
probably not hear from most people, if
any at all, this weekend: The Stanford
you see this weekend is, in many impor
tant ways, very different from the Stan
ford you will experience if you choose
you come here next year. Strangely, Stan
ford omits some of the best aspects of this
school in the process of, for lack of a bet
ter word, selling itself to you. Let us fill in
a few of the holes.
The University-organized parties
throughout this weekend in places like
White Plaza are in noway indicative of the
social scene at Stanford. With the excep
tion of the Black Recruitment Orientation
Committee, or BROC, party (which you
should all go to) none of the other parties
taking place in the next two days are par
ticularly memorable. For one thing, cam
pus parties are not alcohol-free, as they
are this weekend. (But there is a strict Uni
versity-enforced alcohol policy that pro
hibits underage drinking.) We know how

to have a good time, and we do. Every
weekend there are various social events,
ranging from scavenger hunts in San Fran
cisco to elaborately-themed dorm and frat
parties.
The University also neglects to tell you
about other traditions that are unique to
Stanford. The Band Run through campus
in the fall is one crazy party-on-the-go.
And you may have heard about Full Moon
on the Ouad. It is what it is: seniors and
freshmen (and even those in between)
gather under the moonlight to be kissed.
These — not the icebreaker-like bonding
activities you'll participate in during the
next couple days — are the kinds of events
that make this school so great.
We know one thing you will hear about
this weekend: the weather. University ad
ministrators sometimes joke that we get
bad weather during Admit Weekend so
that ProFroswill not come here just for the
weather. It is a fact that for more months
out of the year we have better weather
than our East Coast counterparts. But
what's really great (and we know that the
University won't tell you this) is that the
good weather often comes with a certain
kind of attitude that drives students to the
beach volleyball courts, to the fields to lie
out under the sun.
If the real Stanford were similar to
Admit Weekend it wouldn't be a fun place
to go to school. It's not a place where peo
ple will hold your hand (which happens,
literally, during Admit Weekend) or tell
you what to do. It isn't a superficial, first
day-of-summer-camp kind of school that
you may think it is after spending this
weekend here. And, despite what people
may tell you, it isn't a place where people
are happy all the time. But we work hard
and play hard. So if you take anything
away from this weekend, let us tell you
that you should look beyond the spin and
figure out what it is about Stanford you re
ally like. The answer isn't in that red fold
er you're holding.
