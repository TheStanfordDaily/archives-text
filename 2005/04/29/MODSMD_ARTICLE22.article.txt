## Notes from the CV university 
### 
"There's an art to this,"
a neighbor of mine coun
seled during my high
school years, as he in
structed me and a friend to
split and stack wood. It
was odd to imagine cre
ative guidance for this
farouche activity of iron
wedges, back braces and
blunt tools, accompanied
only by our panting and
uruntine.

C*" * C'
But it was true. To arrange that cord of
wood, one had to adhere to a craft model. In
the preparation of winter fuel, then, art was
vital.
That story comes back to me during this job
application season, because the same advice
my neighbor offered me several years ago
could well apply to the creation of resumes.
After all, there is an art or at least a craft to the
studiousness and concision with which one ar
ranges and edits a CV.
But if resume-writing is an art whose re
ward is employment, then it is also a document
and a way of life that neglects much of what is
worthwhile. This species of thought is taken to
a dangerous extreme at Stanford.
There are many activities for whose com
pletion resume-building is. if not the sole im
petus, a major one. The internship, the CPA,
the faculty-friend, the far-flung research pro
ject — there is likely no Stanford student un
versed in this surprise-free list. More striking is
the occasional student who admits to pursuing
an altruistic endeavor or foreign-language flu
ency solely for CV payoff.
This reality will come into particular focus
in the upcoming commencement period.
Commencement can be seen, curiously, as the
annual celebration of the twin achievements
of egoism and altruism. It features the in
evitable roll-call of thesis, fellowship and de
gree awards. The effect is to elevate the CV to
its own pedestal.
I find it quite depressing that a good deal of
student activity is carried forth chiefly or ex
clusively for resume ends. This is perhaps a re
ality of the modern university, and a corollary

to what I have previously deemed the
Rolodex approach of conversation among our
empirically minded students.
But the focus on the CV also diminishes the
valuable parts of life that can neither be quan
tified nor annexed for purposes of employ
ment. I have a friend who can quote "The Big
Lebowski" at will, and we hardly care that this
hilarious and endearing trait will never get him
a job. For there is no resume that can bring to
gether the private pleasures embodied by our
fellow travelers — the belly laugh, the chang
ing hair-style, the right recipe.
And as we all have friends who possess
such traits, so too do we know individuals for
whom those qualities are of greater impor
tance than the CV. It would be wrong to say
this university is populated only and always by
careerists.
But the appreciation of private pleasures is
an exception on this campus. This is not to fur
ther diminish them, but rather to say that cam
pus norms are determined ultimately by the
more forceful CV tendencies. At the CV uni
versity, activism is nearly always seen as a rup
ture or disturbance, cooperative houses exist
on the bemused periphery of most students'
lives and Vice Provost John Bravman can feel
comfortable making the misguided and unilat
eral proposal to relocate Ujamaa House.
At Stanford, the small and quirky fight a
lopsided battle against the CV forces. Not only
does so much of our activity service our re
sumes, but we tend also to extend the CV
mindset to the rest of our lives. Activism, co
ops and ethnic theme houses disturb us be
cause they seem tangential to CV goals, to be
sure, but they also disturb a general sense of
the direction of campus life.
I've often been struck by how the publica
tions that enumerate the "50 things to do be
fore you graduate Stanford" manage to re
duce the playful aspects of campus life to just
another list of obligations. If we tend to our
CVs as if they were art. then they are an art
that we could do with a lot less of.
