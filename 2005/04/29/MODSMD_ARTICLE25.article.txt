## Politics in the Classroom 
### 
A debate that continues to rage at Stan
ford, as well as at the "Stanford(s) of the
Last" and all institutions of higher learning
for that matter, has been to what degree the
classroom should be a political arena. The
dispute goes back to the trial of Socrates al
most two-and-a-half millennia ago. In that
case, Socrates lost his life for supposedly em
ploying the pulpit of intellect as a platform
from which to articulate his political lean
ings, concerning everything from democracy
to religion.
Over the next several thousand years
(this sounds an awful lot like an epic), the
discourse persisted, until the question of pol
itics in the classroom itself became a politi
cally charged issue. While biased instruction
was not a capital crime in McCarthy's Amer
ica as it had been in Classical Greece, such
action often resulted in firings and university
blacklisting — that is, if one's uncle's mis
tress' gardener was a communist. This effec
tively (though temporarily) hushed the liber
al biases harbored by many university em
ployees.
However, the Vietnam quagmire in the
'60s and '70s brought political discourse back
into the lecture halls, and consequently
reignited the dorm-room debate over the va
lidity of such dialogue — or monologue, as
the case may be. The controversial (selec
tion of President George W. Bush in 2000, in
concert with the often-irreversibly detrimen
tal actions taken since has once more
brought the politics of politics to the fore
front of university life. Here are the facts:
First, in the non-technical disciplines
(and perhaps in the techie ones, too) there
really is no such thing as pure "fact." Ev
erything is inherently biased: anything

taught is based at least to
some degree in theory —
anything learned is done
so with at least some sort
of a leap of faith. The
true problems arise not
when professors are bi
ased. but when they at
tempt to remain indiffer
ent, when they try (albeit
in vain) to pass their

knowledge off as fact. These cases of sup
posed neutrality are the instances when the
inexperienced student accepts opinion (ex
pert opinion, granted) as fact. If a profes
sor, or any lecturer for that matter, comes
clean, admitting his or her bias from the be
ginning, then any opportunity for mistaken
truths is eradicated.
A resounding argument against the per
meation of politics into academia is the de
sire of many students to learn absolute
truths, and then to draw their own conclu
sions. "We work so hard to get here," goes
the line of reasoning, "and we pay so much to
come here, that in return we deserve the
facts." This is an honorable but misguided
contention. It is precisely because of all the
work and money and talent that we have the
priceless opportunity to be exposed to the bi
ases of others — the chance to bypass the
dry "facts" and instead wrestle with the im
plications.
And these aren't just the "biases of oth
ers"— they're the excessively scrutinized
beliefs of the world's pre-eminent scholars.
Stanford's are the top intellectuals in their
respective fields, their opinions count —
their biases are not unfounded. Rather,
these partialities are (at least we hope they

are) firmly based in life experience and rig
orous study. However, these biases are not
facts.
Last Wednesday, in"The United States
in the 20th Century" (a class which 1 highly
recommend, incidentally — not to be biased
or anything). Prof. Kennedy (yeah, the one
who wrote your junior year AP U.S. text
book) made the contention that the decision
to drop the atomic bomb in 1945 was largely,
if not entirely, a military, not a political cal
culation. Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he as
serts, were targeted in hopes of ending
World War Two in an expedient and ulti
mately life-saving fashion — not in an at
tempt to intimidate the Soviet Union into
post-war submission. This is. of course, an
extremely controversial and political argu
ment, even after all these years. And I took it
as just that, an argument.
My lOth-grade social studies teacher
(while no David M. Kennedy) told us relent
lessly that everyone has something to teach,
and everyone has something to learn. That
statement is all the truer in the case of Stan
ford faculty, and juxtaposing our own views
with theirs on crucial issues has got to be the
most effective way of further refining our
outlooks on life — even, and perhaps espe
cially, when we fervently disagree.
And finally, if you can't handle having
your political beliefs challenged by other,
perhaps wiser academics, then you've got
bigger problems at hand. How strong — and
valid — are those political leanings if they
can't be questioned?

If it's not too political, Kalani encourages all
Pro Fro s to come to Stanford. To ask him why,
