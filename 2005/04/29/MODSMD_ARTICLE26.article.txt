## The
						truth about sexually transmitted diseases 
### 
As the Sexual Health and Relationship
Educator at Vaden Health Center, I am pas
sionate about helping Stanford students to
develop healthy attitudes about their sexual
ity. 1 have spent the last 12 years creating nu
anced messages regarding the complex topic
of human sexual behavior and health. Those
messages were not accurately conveyed in
The Daily article, "Stanford is not STD-free
zone" (April 27). In some cases my messages
were embarrassingly misconstrued. Instead
of addressing each specific quote and inaccu
racy. I will simply send the messages as I had
intended in the interview:
• This article focused on the biological risks
of sexual behavior. We at Health Promotion
Services (HPS) firmly believe that sexual
health also includes emotional, physical and
social health.
• Condoms (male and female) are the only
forms of contraception that also help protect
people from most sexually transmitted dis
eases (they only protect those parts of the
body that they cover).
- The three "Safe Sex Strategies" that drasti

cally reduce the chances of a person getting
infected with STD's are: 1) choosing not to
have sex. 2) using condoms correctly and
consistently and 3) being in a sexually
monogamous relationship in which both
partners have been tested for STDs
(monogamy without testing or testing with
out monogamy does not provide protection
from STDs).
• For most people, getting tested regularly is
not necessary. A person needs to be tested
for STDs if they have had unprotected (in
cludes condom breakage or other failure)
anal or vaginal intercourse. (Unprotected
oral sex is considered low risk for HIV but
can readily transmit herpes and some bacte
rial infections.) For general health, females
should receive yearly pelvic exams which
may include STD testing. Many couples
choose to get tested as they are entering into
a "serious" relationship. We believe that this
is a good practice and provides benefits to
the couple beyond the biological ones.
• In a sexual interaction, there is a differ
ence between biological safety and emo
tional safety. At HPS we promote and value

both, but we find that people get the two
confused. For example, if I know and
like/love someone, I may feel very comfort
able having sex with them but that does not
guarantee that 1 will be safe from STDs if
we have unprotected sex. Likewise, I may
be having a "random hook-up" with some
one, but if we use protection properly and
there is no failure of the device, then 1 am as
biologically safe as 1 would be having pro
tected sex with someone with whom I am
more comfortable. The way that we most
commonly see the consequences of this con
fusion is that a couple will use condoms
when the relationship is new. but a few
months later when they feel more comfort
able with each other, they stop using con
doms without first getting tested for STDs.
We acknowledge that comfort with your
partner does influence (but not guarantee)
one's ability to talk about and initiate safe
sex practices.
