# Women take on Tigers today
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford women's rugby team al
ready has a place in the history books. Sally
Ride, the first U.S. female astronaut, was
among the members of Stanford's inaugu
ral team in 1976.
Three decades later, this year's team is
just two wins away from adding its own
chapter to the history books by capturing
Stanford's first national title since 1999.
"We've been talking about this from day
one," senior flanker Katie Hill, the team's co
president, said. "The goal this season has
been to win the National Championship."
Stanford can realize that goal on its
home pitch at the Steuber Rugby Stadium
at the Final Four beginning today.
Standing in the way is Ivy League
Champion Princeton, which Stanford will
meet in today's second semifinal at noon.
Navy and Penn State will meet in today's
first semifinal and the winners will square
off tomorrow at noon for the National
Championship.

To get here, Stanford defeated previ
ously unbeaten UC-San Diego, 22-5, in the
Sweet 16 on April 17 in Gainesville, Fla.,
and knocked off No. 2 Virginia in the Elite
Eight, 43-27, the following day.
"We're so excited because everyone in
this group, even our filth-year seniors,
we've never been to this level before," ju
nior flanker Dena Acosta said. "When we
finished our last game in the Elite Eight, I
just started crying. This is my third year, so
I've been waiting for this fora long time.
It's going to be great to be playing here and
I think we're really going to benefit from
playing at home with all of our fans."
Princeton defeated UNC, 32-24, in the
Sweet 16 and Chico State, 25-17, in the
Elite Eight.
"Princeton is a good team," junior full
back Olivia Anglade said. "They know
what it's like, they've been here."
The Tigers, who won back-to-back titles
in 1995 and 19%, have been to the Final
Four six times since then, including last sea
son, when they lost to Penn State, 24-8, in
the National Championship at Stanford.

Stanford and Princeton have met on the
Final Four stage before — at the 1999 Na
tional Championship game in State Col
lege, Pa. Stanford, playing its first season in
Division I after capturing the Division II
national title the previous year, defeated
the Tigers, 43-31, in overtime after tying the
game with no time left on the clock. The
win capped an impressive run that included
a 10-game winning streak to end the regu
lar season and a snow-filled last-second vic
tory at Air Force to advance to the Final
Four.
Stanford reached the Final Four again in
2000 hut has not been back until this year.
"It's great to be here," Anglade said.
"And we feel like we deserve to be here. It's
not like we're some underdog team that has
just come out of nowhere."
Hill, a four-year member of the team,
said this year's team could make some
noise this weekend.
"This is probably one of the most athlet
ically and technically talented teams in my
four years here," Hill said. "We have al
ways been a strong team, but we have also
had the habit of choking at Nationals —
making it only to Sweet 16s or the Elite
Eight. There was definitely the sense
among our returners that we are not willing
to let another championship pass us by."
The team's most recent heartbreak came
in last season's Sweet 16, when it lost to
eventual champion Penn State, 20-5. Hill
said the feeling in her stomach after the loss
provided motivation to come back with
more fire this season. Acosta expressed the
same feeling.
"Knowing how close we are and feeling
it taken away, we're really going to work for
it this year," Acosta said.
Fielding a roster of nearly 50 women
under the guidance of new coach Jonathan
Griffin, who coached England's Lough
borough University to the women's colle
giate championship, Stanford breezed
through the regular season. It posted early
wins over UC-Davis, Nevada and Chico
State before kicking into high gear in
March with a 39-10 rout of California and
a 40-0 blanking of Humboldt State. After
suffering a 30-12 loss at British Columbia,
Stanford opened the PacCoast Playoffs
with a dominating 93-0 win over Oregon at
home.
But in the PacCoast final, Chico State
avenged its early-season loss and upset
Stanford 33-30. According to Hill, the loss

was exactly what a team so used to domi
nating West Coast teams before flounder
ing against tougher competition in the na
tional tournament needed.
"Chico beat us because they wanted it
more," Hill said. "And it was a wake up call
that we were going to have to fight for every
inch of the field and every point on the
scoreboard. I think that's what we did in
Gainesville."
Not a particularly big team, Stanford
will look to spread the field and get the ball
to its speedy wings against Princeton.
"East Coast teams tend to have a really
strong pack," Acosta said. "The best thing
about playing the East Coast teams is that
we have a really strong backline, so we're
going to look to get it out wide really quick.
Not many teams have the passing ability
that we have."
While Stanford and Princeton may

spend the first few minutes of the match
feeling out each other's strategy, Acosta
said she is confident the home team will
seize control.
"It's going to be a struggle up front, but
once our forwards get their heads in the
game, then we can win the ball and get it out
to the backs," she said. "I hope to start
dominating by the fifth minute."
"We're going to come out gunning for
them," Anglade said.
As the season wraps up with what she
hopes is a national title. Hill reflected on
the final season of her career.
"This season has been so bittersweet for
me," she said. "The Stanford women's
rugby team has been the most fulfilling ex
perience for me at Stanford and every game
this year has meant getting closer and clos
er to the end. But this is a damn good way
to go out!"

avenged its early-season loss and upset
Stanford 33-30. According to Hill, the loss

was exactly what a team so used to domi
nating West Coast teams before flounder
ing against tougher competition in the na
tional tournament needed.
"Chico beat us because they wanted it
more," Hill said. "And it was a wake up call
that we were going to have to fight for every
inch of the field and every point on the
scoreboard. I think that's what we did in
Gainesville."
Not a particularly big team, Stanford
will look to spread the field and get the ball
to its speedy wings against Princeton.
"East Coast teams tend to have a really
strong pack," Acosta said. "The best thing
about playing the East Coast teams is that
we have a really strong backline, so we're
going to look to get it out wide really quick.
Not many teams have the passing ability
that we have."
While Stanford and Princeton may

spend the first few minutes of the match
feeling out each other's strategy, Acosta
said she is confident the home team will
seize control.
"It's going to be a struggle up front, but
once our forwards get their heads in the
game, then we can win the ball and get it out
to the backs," she said. "I hope to start
dominating by the fifth minute."
"We're going to come out gunning for
them," Anglade said.
As the season wraps up with what she
hopes is a national title. Hill reflected on
the final season of her career.
"This season has been so bittersweet for
me," she said. "The Stanford women's
rugby team has been the most fulfilling ex
perience for me at Stanford and every game
this year has meant getting closer and clos
er to the end. But this is a damn good way
to go out!"

Founded in 1976, the Stanford women's rugby team defeated Princeton to win the 1999
National Championship.
The Stanford women's rugby team al
ready has a place in the history books. Sally
Ride, the first U.S. female astronaut, was
among the members of Stanford's inaugu
ral team in 1976.
Three decades later, this year's team is
just two wins away from adding its own
chapter to the history books by capturing
Stanford's first national title since 1999.
"We've been talking about this from day
one," senior flanker Katie Hill, the team's co
president, said. "The goal this season has
been to win the National Championship."
Stanford can realize that goal on its
home pitch at the Steuber Rugby Stadium
at the Final Four beginning today.
Standing in the way is Ivy League
Champion Princeton, which Stanford will
meet in today's second semifinal at noon.
Navy and Penn State will meet in today's
first semifinal and the winners will square
off tomorrow at noon for the National
Championship.

To get here, Stanford defeated previ
ously unbeaten UC-San Diego, 22-5, in the
Sweet 16 on April 17 in Gainesville, Fla.,
and knocked off No. 2 Virginia in the Elite
Eight, 43-27, the following day.
"We're so excited because everyone in
this group, even our filth-year seniors,
we've never been to this level before," ju
nior flanker Dena Acosta said. "When we
finished our last game in the Elite Eight, I
just started crying. This is my third year, so
I've been waiting for this fora long time.
It's going to be great to be playing here and
I think we're really going to benefit from
playing at home with all of our fans."
Princeton defeated UNC, 32-24, in the
Sweet 16 and Chico State, 25-17, in the
Elite Eight.
"Princeton is a good team," junior full
back Olivia Anglade said. "They know
what it's like, they've been here."
The Tigers, who won back-to-back titles
in 1995 and 19%, have been to the Final
Four six times since then, including last sea
son, when they lost to Penn State, 24-8, in
the National Championship at Stanford.

Stanford and Princeton have met on the
Final Four stage before — at the 1999 Na
tional Championship game in State Col
lege, Pa. Stanford, playing its first season in
Division I after capturing the Division II
national title the previous year, defeated
the Tigers, 43-31, in overtime after tying the
game with no time left on the clock. The
win capped an impressive run that included
a 10-game winning streak to end the regu
lar season and a snow-filled last-second vic
tory at Air Force to advance to the Final
Four.
Stanford reached the Final Four again in
2000 hut has not been back until this year.
"It's great to be here," Anglade said.
"And we feel like we deserve to be here. It's
not like we're some underdog team that has
just come out of nowhere."
Hill, a four-year member of the team,
said this year's team could make some
noise this weekend.
"This is probably one of the most athlet
ically and technically talented teams in my
four years here," Hill said. "We have al
ways been a strong team, but we have also
had the habit of choking at Nationals —
making it only to Sweet 16s or the Elite
Eight. There was definitely the sense
among our returners that we are not willing
to let another championship pass us by."
The team's most recent heartbreak came
in last season's Sweet 16, when it lost to
eventual champion Penn State, 20-5. Hill
said the feeling in her stomach after the loss
provided motivation to come back with
more fire this season. Acosta expressed the
same feeling.
"Knowing how close we are and feeling
it taken away, we're really going to work for
it this year," Acosta said.
Fielding a roster of nearly 50 women
under the guidance of new coach Jonathan
Griffin, who coached England's Lough
borough University to the women's colle
giate championship, Stanford breezed
through the regular season. It posted early
wins over UC-Davis, Nevada and Chico
State before kicking into high gear in
March with a 39-10 rout of California and
a 40-0 blanking of Humboldt State. After
suffering a 30-12 loss at British Columbia,
Stanford opened the PacCoast Playoffs
with a dominating 93-0 win over Oregon at
home.
But in the PacCoast final, Chico State
avenged its early-season loss and upset
Stanford 33-30. According to Hill, the loss

was exactly what a team so used to domi
nating West Coast teams before flounder
ing against tougher competition in the na
tional tournament needed.
"Chico beat us because they wanted it
more," Hill said. "And it was a wake up call
