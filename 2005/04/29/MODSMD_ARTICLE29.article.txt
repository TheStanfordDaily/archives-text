# Anglade leads Stanford ruggers
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Junior Olivia Anglade is anxious.
Midterms are almost here, her computer is
on the fritz and the cluster is a real pain to use.
And oh yeah, at nixin today, she needs to
help the Stanford women's rugby team heat
the ghost of East Coast superiority and take
one more step toward a national champi
onship in the university's oldest sport.
It's hard to believe that less than three
years ago, she was only curious,..
Back then, Anglade was an athlete with
out a team. Terms like "scrum." "maul" and
"prop" were part of a language she didn't
speak.
It was then that fortune used her old high
school passion to open up an unexpected
door.
"I was playing in the advanced soccer class,
and the women's rugby team practiced on the
same field after us in the afternoons,"
Anglade remembered. "At the beginning of
the year, when the freshmen come in. there's
heavy recruiting [for club sports] on all sides."
Beating a hasty escape from Flicks on a
Sunday night, she found herself assaulted with
an informational flyer, and so unwittingly set
out on the very adventure for which she had
been searching.
"I went out (to practice], and I was really
nervous," Anglade said. "I didn't want to go
in; I just wanted to watch."
Once she saw action, however, it was her
s(X)n-to-be teammates who were stopping to
watch - and marvel.
"Every year, there are one or two rookies
who just get it," said senior flanker Katie Hill,
co-president and co-captain of the team.
"Olivia was one of those few who seemed like
she'd been playing rugby all her life. It just
comes naturally to her."
After hesitating to join in the contact of
practice during those early days, Anglade, a
fullback, now seems right at home as she took
three opposing defenders fora ride into the
try zone in Stanford's Elite Eight matchup
with Virginia on April 18.
Then again, perhaps it should come as no
surprise that Anglade has taken to her new
home on the rugby pitch with such aplomb.

Geographical change has been her only con
stant as she has moved around the world dur
ing her father's 20-year career in the U.S.
Navy. A graduate of a high school in Seoul.
South Korea, for military dependents, she still
travels halfway around the world to spend
time with her family in Korea during holiday
breaks.
To a plate already filled with a new sport
and a major in civil engineering, Anglade
added 15 hours per week in Stanford's Army
ROTC program and a four-year active-duty
commitment after graduation.
"The military's always been a part of my
life," Anglade said. "It's a lot of things to jug
gle, but we manage, and all Stanford students
do it."
Uh, yeah, sort of.
While readers quickly reconsider their
own "busy" school weeks, Anglade, along
with the rest of her team, prepares to play in
her first Final Four.
It will be the team's fiercest competition
and biggest stage of the season, but excuse
their captain if she isn't overwhelmed by the
setting.
After just two years in the sport,
Anglade accepted an invitation to join the
Under 23 U.S. National Rugby Team for its
trip to New Zealand to compete against its
Kiwi counterparts in a country that wor
ships the game.
Not that she'd ever advertise the fact. Or
reveal it without some heavy-duty detective
work, for that matter.
"She's just amazing, because she doesn't
talk about it a lot," junior flanker Dena Acos
ta said." I was out when all this was happening,
because I was getting surgery. I came back and
I went to her room and saw all these pictures
and asked her where she'd gone. She said. Oh,
yeah, I went there with the National Team,"'
Though she might treat acclaim as some
thing to be endured rather than sought, it
seeks her out all the same as she traces out a
learning curve that approaches the vertical
and introduces her teammates to a standard
of excellence that transcends their regular sea
son schedule.
"It really puts you in a different light when
you're able to see the international game and
go to a culture where rugby is number one,"

coach Rob Holder said. "We in American
rugby tend to think of ourselves as a second
rate club sport. When you travel, you see
what's out there and it makes you bring back
a certain level of dedication. When [rookies]
see someone like Olivia who's really made a
commitment, then it kind of brings the rest of
the team up."
As Stanford tries to recruit a fresh set of
faces for the fall during Admit Weekend, the
advertising campaign could hardly have a bet
ter face than the young woman whose team
mates spontaneously broke into a cheer of
"Be Olivia" after a particularly inspiring per
formance.
"It makes us really proud to say that she's
on our team," Acosta said. "It also gives us a
little bit of credibility. We tell people to come
out to our games and say we have these na
tional players and they say Whoa, you're ac
tually for real, you're not just some second
rate club sport.' It's good, because I think our
whole team deserves to have that."
While Stanford roles through its Pacific
Coast League tilts on a yearly basis, it's the
battle of perceptions that represents the
team's biggest hurdle. Ii) a crusade to take
themselves more seriously and have others do
the same, Anglade's teammates could ask for
no better ally.
Fundraising?
She's on it.
Special-fees petitions?
Olivia did two.
Leading practice while the team was trying
to replace its old coach?
Do you even need to ask?
" In a club sport, students take on a lot of re
sponsibilities," senior Percy Link said. "Hav
ing someone who is willing to put in the time
and the work for it has kept our team afloat for
the last couple of years."
As fans crowd into Steuber Rugby Stadi
um for today's national semifinal, Anglade
and Stanford will look to move that much
closer to the ultimate goal.
"To upset UVA to get here is just awe
some." Anglade said. "Stanford having the fa
cilities, the beautiful stadium, just puts the
word out that West Coast rugby is here and
somebody should pay attention."
Don't worry, Olivia. Now they are.

Do you even need to ask?

Don't worry, Olivia. Now they are.

Junior Olivia Anglade is anxious.
Midterms are almost here, her computer is
on the fritz and the cluster is a real pain to use.
And oh yeah, at nixin today, she needs to
help the Stanford women's rugby team heat
the ghost of East Coast superiority and take
one more step toward a national champi
onship in the university's oldest sport.
It's hard to believe that less than three
years ago, she was only curious,..
Back then, Anglade was an athlete with
out a team. Terms like "scrum." "maul" and
"prop" were part of a language she didn't
speak.
It was then that fortune used her old high
school passion to open up an unexpected
door.
"I was playing in the advanced soccer class,
and the women's rugby team practiced on the
same field after us in the afternoons,"
Anglade remembered. "At the beginning of
the year, when the freshmen come in. there's
heavy recruiting [for club sports] on all sides."
Beating a hasty escape from Flicks on a
Sunday night, she found herself assaulted with
an informational flyer, and so unwittingly set
out on the very adventure for which she had
been searching.
"I went out (to practice], and I was really
nervous," Anglade said. "I didn't want to go
in; I just wanted to watch."
Once she saw action, however, it was her
s(X)n-to-be teammates who were stopping to
watch - and marvel.
"Every year, there are one or two rookies
who just get it," said senior flanker Katie Hill,
co-president and co-captain of the team.
"Olivia was one of those few who seemed like
she'd been playing rugby all her life. It just
comes naturally to her."
After hesitating to join in the contact of
practice during those early days, Anglade, a
fullback, now seems right at home as she took
three opposing defenders fora ride into the
try zone in Stanford's Elite Eight matchup
with Virginia on April 18.
Then again, perhaps it should come as no
surprise that Anglade has taken to her new
home on the rugby pitch with such aplomb.

Geographical change has been her only con
stant as she has moved around the world dur
ing her father's 20-year career in the U.S.
Navy. A graduate of a high school in Seoul.
South Korea, for military dependents, she still
travels halfway around the world to spend
time with her family in Korea during holiday
breaks.
To a plate already filled with a new sport
and a major in civil engineering, Anglade
added 15 hours per week in Stanford's Army
ROTC program and a four-year active-duty
commitment after graduation.
"The military's always been a part of my
life," Anglade said. "It's a lot of things to jug
gle, but we manage, and all Stanford students
do it."
Uh, yeah, sort of.
While readers quickly reconsider their
own "busy" school weeks, Anglade, along
with the rest of her team, prepares to play in
her first Final Four.
It will be the team's fiercest competition
and biggest stage of the season, but excuse
their captain if she isn't overwhelmed by the
setting.
After just two years in the sport,
Anglade accepted an invitation to join the
Under 23 U.S. National Rugby Team for its
trip to New Zealand to compete against its
Kiwi counterparts in a country that wor
ships the game.
Not that she'd ever advertise the fact. Or
reveal it without some heavy-duty detective
work, for that matter.
"She's just amazing, because she doesn't
talk about it a lot," junior flanker Dena Acos
ta said." I was out when all this was happening,
because I was getting surgery. I came back and
I went to her room and saw all these pictures
and asked her where she'd gone. She said. Oh,
yeah, I went there with the National Team,"'
Though she might treat acclaim as some
thing to be endured rather than sought, it
seeks her out all the same as she traces out a
learning curve that approaches the vertical
and introduces her teammates to a standard
of excellence that transcends their regular sea
son schedule.
"It really puts you in a different light when
you're able to see the international game and
go to a culture where rugby is number one,"

coach Rob Holder said. "We in American
rugby tend to think of ourselves as a second
rate club sport. When you travel, you see
what's out there and it makes you bring back
a certain level of dedication. When [rookies]
see someone like Olivia who's really made a
commitment, then it kind of brings the rest of
the team up."
As Stanford tries to recruit a fresh set of
faces for the fall during Admit Weekend, the
advertising campaign could hardly have a bet
ter face than the young woman whose team
mates spontaneously broke into a cheer of
"Be Olivia" after a particularly inspiring per
formance.
"It makes us really proud to say that she's
on our team," Acosta said. "It also gives us a
little bit of credibility. We tell people to come
out to our games and say we have these na
tional players and they say Whoa, you're ac
tually for real, you're not just some second
rate club sport.' It's good, because I think our
whole team deserves to have that."
While Stanford roles through its Pacific
Coast League tilts on a yearly basis, it's the
battle of perceptions that represents the
team's biggest hurdle. Ii) a crusade to take
themselves more seriously and have others do
