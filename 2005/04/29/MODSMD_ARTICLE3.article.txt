# Bravman addresses Uj move
## 
### MOLLY CUNNINGHAM 
More than 80 students packed the Drake Lounge at Uja
maa on Wednesday night fora town hall meeting with Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education John Bravman re
garding the proposed move of the African-American theme
house to Florence Moore Hall.
Although the controversial change, part of a larger hous
ing overhaul pitched earlier this year, would likely not be im
plemented for six to eight years, many students said they are
apprehensive of the University's commitment to the cultural

anchor Ujamaa provides.
Bravman began the meeting by explaining the develop
ment of the housing proposals goals and then opened the ses
sion to students' questions.
In its current form, the proposal would move Ujamaa to
Mirlo and Loro, which would be reconstructed to create a res
ident fellow apartment and to unify the two houses. Some of
the doubles would be converted to singles in an effort to pre
serve one important part of Ujamaa's appeal to upperclass-
men.
However, this change would re
quire some resident spaces to be elimi
nated, leaving room only for those who
rank Ujamaa as their first or second
choice in the Draw. While this would be
a compromise for the Ujamaa commu
nity, Bravman argued that the current
"over-stuffing" of freshman in Laguni
ta mini-doubles cannot continue.
The move to Florence Moore, in its
entirety, would care a price-tag of $125
million.
Students attending the meeting
stressed the need to preserve the integri
ty of Ujamaa's cultural programming,
which has earned nationwide respect and
heightened the appeal of the University
to prospective minority students.
Others said they were skeptical of
the feasibility of reconstructing Mirlo
and Loro and said they were worried
that sense of community that thrives at
the current location might be lost. The
students also expressed concern that
there hasn't been enough student input
involved in the proposal itself, and
called for greater transparency in the

process.
Senior Michael Brown, co-presi
dent of the Black Student Union, also
called fora solid commitment from the
University to guarantee that the crucial
aspects of Ujamaa would not be com
promised by the changes.
Bravman agreed to work with the
students to produce a draft of such a
commitment to be signed by University
President John Hennessy and Provost
John Etchemendy.
"I think that when students write an
actual proposal, the Stanford commu
nity will be in a better position to gauge
if the administration is moving in the
right direction," Brown said. "Current
ly, it appears as though the University
has an agenda all around with the hous
ing proposal that disregards student
voice and does not concretely tell stu
dents why."
Sophomore Maccarin Morton, who
moderated the town hall meeting, said
he felt the event went well, giving the at
tendees both a "forum for discussion
about the housing proposal as well as an
update about the current status."
While he feels a solid, written com
mitment with the University is needed,
Morton added, "I believe that the Uni
versity will do all it can to ensure that
the Ujamaa program thrives amidst the
housing changes."
