# From dugout antics to pitching domination:
## That's just 'Seves' 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR DESK EDITOR 
Laura Severson, or "Seves" to her team
mates, doesn't make just any first impres
sion. Her loud and vocal personality flows
into the stands during games. Her jokes and
high-energy attitude fill the field after prac
tice. You can hear her cheering from the
dugout just as sharply as you can see her
trademark bright red headband in her hair
while she's pitching.
Severson, a junior, has been vivacious all
her life, in and out of softball. Junior center
fielder Catalina Morris, who has lived with
Severson for two years and now shares a
room with her in Robinson, first met Sever
son during recruiting trips.
"Laura is definitely... a crazy girl, 1
would say," Morris said. "She's real talkative,
high energy, always having a lot of fun.
[When I first met her,] she just seemed like

she would be a lot of fun.'
For the Cardinal,
watching Severson pitch
is pretty enjoyable, too.
The Frankfort, 111., native
makes the same big im
pression when she takes
the circle.
"I feel that part of one
of my jobs as a leader on
the team is to get people
fired up and keep people
in the game," Severson
said. "And that's part of
my personality. I'm al
ways talking and being
loud so it comes naturally

to me. It's not something I have to force my
self to do. It's something that's fun and that I
enjoy; pumping my teammates up. That's the
fun part of the game for me, getting the team
going. And I've always been that way."
In the process of creating strong relation
ships both on and off the field with her team
mates, Severson makes sure they feel appre
ciated for their efforts. She's made personal
ized cheers in the past, establishing herself as
a team cheerleader her freshman and sopho
more years. And now, as one of the estab
lished aces and veterans on the team, Sever
son continues to leave a powerful mark in her
pregame tradition.
"She also does this — we call it a positive
message — she always says positive things
about the game or about the player, like
funny things that have happened, just to
make us all laugh and get pumped up for the
game," Morris said.
Her nurturing side may come from her
parents, whom Severson has cited as being
the most influential figures in her life. But her
parents aren't the only ones who have helped
to mold Severson into the person she is now.
In her first two years on the Farm, Sever
son had plenty of softball role-models in 2003
graduates Tori Nyberg and Maureen

"I feel that part of one of
my jobs as a leader on
the team is to get people
fired up and keep people
in the game. "
— Laura Severson

LeCocq, and Dana Sorenson, who left last
year.
"I just learned a lot from them," Severson
said. "They were some of my best friends on
the team. And Dana last year, she was like a
sjster to me. I learned so much from her and
we were really good friends. 1 never was jeal
ous or anything, I just used her as a resource
to get better. She's always been someone I
looked up to and was inspired by."
Severson had Sorenson's big shoes to fill
this season. Though Severson pitched often
last year, finishing with a 13-8 season and a
2.30 ERA, she took a larger role on the staff
this year.
"I think she was really excited," Morris
said. "She knew that with Dana leaving that
she was going to have to step it up. I think
she's just real excited to take on that position.
She's worked really hard and wants to fill that
role that Dana held."
But Severson doesn't feel any added pres
sure this year. She says she doesn't feel she is

in a different spot. She
relishes the opportuni
ty to pitch big games
and she enjoys having
younger players look
up to her. But, just as
she has always been the
team encourager, the
leadership role is one
she's had her entire
life.
In fact, taking the
top starter position
wasn't even the hardest
thing this season for the
5-foot-8 hurler. The

real challenge was not being able to play; Sev
erson sat out the beginning of the season with
an injured ankle.
"Coming back was difficult when I was
still in pain," Severson said. "I'm proud of
myself for overcoming it and keeping myself
positive throughout that whole time. My goal
has always been to come back stronger. Now
I feel that now that I'm 100 percent I can be
what I was at the beginning of the season be
fore, and that's something that I'm proud of."
Even at 100 percent, however, the righty
said she has a couple more expectations. Sev
erson played every position except catcher
before coming to Stanford — which was one
of the few programs that offered her the op
portunity to pitch — so of course, there's one
thing she misses.
';Being versa tile is somealways
prided myself on, and I definitely mjss getjljng
to hit and do all those other things, - "
said. "Maybe next year, we'll see.
still the dream there — to go back to my hit
ting days."
For the vocal and energetic "Seves," her
words will be the best way to get her hands on
the bat again.
"I'll ask coach and see what he says," she
said with a laugh.
