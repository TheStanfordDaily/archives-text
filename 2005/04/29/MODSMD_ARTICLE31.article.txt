# Card make grueling road trip
## 
### REBECCA HARLOW STAFF WRITER 
What do you get when you send 20 softball players 8(X) miles
away fora game and then make them fly another 1,200 miles to
play three more? One grueling weekend for the No. 5 Cardinal
(34-9, 8-3 Pacific-10 Conference) and, ideally, four conference
wins.
Because there are only eight softball teams in the Pac-10
(Southern California and Washington State do not have teams),
instead of playing a weekend series against schools within driving
distance of each other, opponents of No. 10 UCLA (24-11, 5-5)
and No. 24 Washington (25-15, 5-6) must lly between the cam
puses in Seattle and Los Angeles in one three-game weekend.
This week is the Cardinal's turn. The weekend kicks off Friday
afternoon against Washington and wraps up with three games
against UCLA, including a Sunday double-header. The first of
the Sunday games was added when a planned game at Stanford
was rained out earlier this month.
"We just need to be sure to stay hydrated, get a good night's
sleep and rest on the plane," head coach John Rittman said. "It's
a trip that we've done for many years now, so the older kids are
used to it, but the first time it can be draining."
The rookies said they aren't worried.
"I actually get a lot of studying done on planes — studying and
sleeping," freshman pitcher Lauren Nydam said. "It's not a nui
sance at all."
"When we travel with the team, we all have a lot of fun, we eat
good food and it's just great time to spend together," freshman in
fielder Anna Beardman said.

Physical and mental preparation will
be key this weekend, especially against
two of the best teams in the conference.
"The biggest thing is that once the
game starts, the adrenaline sets in."
Rittman said. "This is a Pac-10 series
against two great schools, great teams.
We really have a rivalry with everybody
in this league, so the kids will be up when
the game starts."
Stanford has won both games this
season against Washington, claiming a 6-
3 victory and then holding on fora 4-3
win at home three weeks ago. In those
two games, freshman Michelle Smith led
the Stanford offense, swatting two out of
the park and finishing with seven RBI on
4-for-7 hitting. Freshman pitcher Becky
McCullough earned the win in both
games.
For the Huskies, freshman pitcher
Caitlin Noble led the way against the
Cardinal with her first career home run
and finished the weekend with three
RBI. despite taking two losses in the cir
cle. She boasts a 12-7 record and a 1.90
ERA. Washington's other pitcher, Ash
ley Boek, is 13-8 with a 2.66 ERA.

"Last time we played them, they were both close games, both
decided by three-run homers," Rittman said. "Washington is
playing even better now. For us to beat them, we are going to have
to make sure to keep people off base in front of Kristen Rivera,
their big home run hitter, and we need to score some runs."
Rivera, 2(X)4 Pac-1() Player of the Year, paces the Huskies' of
fense with a .410 batting average, 14 home runs, 39 RBI and a .988
slugging percentage. Teammates Aimee Minor and Sarah Hyatt
have tallied 12 homers apiece and combined for 78 RBI.
Washington is riding a four-game winning streak, with recent
wins over UCLA and Nevada, and is undefeated at home this sea
son.
As s(x>n as the game ends on Friday, the Cardinal will hit the
road and get ready to face off with the two-time defending na
tional champion Bruins. This marks the first meeting between the
two schools since the Bruins claimed a 3-1 victory in 12 innings in
the Women's College World Series, which knocked the Cardinal
out of contention.
Though UCLA's roster has changed significantly since then,
the team has remained in the top 10 and posted big wins over No.
11 Georgia, No. 3 California and No. 2 Arizona this season.
"They lost their great pitcher, Keira Goerl, to graduation but
they have a freshman, Anjelica Selden, who is throwing really well
and Lisa Dodd (who pitched against us and beat us once last
year)," Rittman said. "They are a very capable team and they
have a lot of weapons offensively, with girls who can hit with a lot
of power, and they have great team speed. They are really the pro
totypical Pac-lOteam."
Ace pitcher Selden (16-6) boasts a 0.62 ERA and 280 strike
outs. All together the pitching staff has held opponents to a .172
batting average. Andrea Duran and Emily Zaplatosch headline
the Bruins' offense and Zaplatosch leads the team with 28 RBI.
No player has hit more than six homers but the offense is very bal
anced with eight different players posting at least two homers.
Despite the potential intimidation factor, the Cardinal said
they do not see this game as any different from any other on the
Pac-10 schedule.
"UCLA is always good and they always bring their 'A'
game, so we'll have to bring ours," Beardman said. "All we can
do is play Stanford Softball. We don't need to make an excep
tion for UCLA or play any differently. If we play our game we
should do well."
The trip to Los Angeles will be a homecoming for many mem
bers of the Stanford roster. Eight players — freshmen Nydam,
Smith, Beardman and Tricia Aggabao, as well as juniors Lauren
Lappin and Megan Bordelon and seniors Elizabeth Bendig and
Heather Shook — hail from Southern California and can count
on support from friends and family.
"I can't wait for my family to come out and watch me play,"
Beardman said. "It is always exciting to go home."
"I really am excited," Nydam agreed. "A lot of my friends and
former teammates and relatives are planning to come. It may be
sold out, which would be really disappointing, if they can't get in."
Although the team will be on the road, Stanford fans can still
watch two of this weekend's games. Tomorrow's afternoon game
will be shown tape-delayed on ESPN2 at 6 p.m. Sunday's second
game will be broadcast at 7 p.m., also on ESPN2.

bers of the Stanford roster. Eight players — freshmen Nydam,
Smith, Beardman and Tricia Aggabao, as well as juniors Lauren
Lappin and Megan Bordelon and seniors Elizabeth Bendig and
Heather Shook — hail from Southern California and can count
on support from friends and family.
"I can't wait for my family to come out and watch me play,"
Beardman said. "It is always exciting to go home."
"I really am excited," Nydam agreed. "A lot of my friends and
former teammates and relatives are planning to come. It may be
sold out, which would be really disappointing, if they can't get in."
Although the team will be on the road, Stanford fans can still
watch two of this weekend's games. Tomorrow's afternoon game
will be shown tape-delayed on ESPN2 at 6 p.m. Sunday's second
game will be broadcast at 7 p.m., also on ESPN2.

The Cardinal softball team will face UCLA this weekend for the first time since the Bruins eliminated
Stanford from the College World Series in June.
What do you get when you send 20 softball players 8(X) miles
away fora game and then make them fly another 1,200 miles to
play three more? One grueling weekend for the No. 5 Cardinal
(34-9, 8-3 Pacific-10 Conference) and, ideally, four conference
wins.
Because there are only eight softball teams in the Pac-10
(Southern California and Washington State do not have teams),
instead of playing a weekend series against schools within driving
distance of each other, opponents of No. 10 UCLA (24-11, 5-5)
and No. 24 Washington (25-15, 5-6) must lly between the cam
puses in Seattle and Los Angeles in one three-game weekend.
This week is the Cardinal's turn. The weekend kicks off Friday
afternoon against Washington and wraps up with three games
against UCLA, including a Sunday double-header. The first of
the Sunday games was added when a planned game at Stanford
was rained out earlier this month.
"We just need to be sure to stay hydrated, get a good night's
sleep and rest on the plane," head coach John Rittman said. "It's
a trip that we've done for many years now, so the older kids are
used to it, but the first time it can be draining."
The rookies said they aren't worried.
"I actually get a lot of studying done on planes — studying and
sleeping," freshman pitcher Lauren Nydam said. "It's not a nui
sance at all."
"When we travel with the team, we all have a lot of fun, we eat
good food and it's just great time to spend together," freshman in
fielder Anna Beardman said.

Physical and mental preparation will
be key this weekend, especially against
two of the best teams in the conference.
"The biggest thing is that once the
game starts, the adrenaline sets in."
Rittman said. "This is a Pac-10 series
against two great schools, great teams.
We really have a rivalry with everybody
in this league, so the kids will be up when
the game starts."
Stanford has won both games this
season against Washington, claiming a 6-
3 victory and then holding on fora 4-3
win at home three weeks ago. In those
two games, freshman Michelle Smith led
the Stanford offense, swatting two out of
the park and finishing with seven RBI on
4-for-7 hitting. Freshman pitcher Becky
McCullough earned the win in both
games.
For the Huskies, freshman pitcher
Caitlin Noble led the way against the
Cardinal with her first career home run
and finished the weekend with three
RBI. despite taking two losses in the cir
cle. She boasts a 12-7 record and a 1.90
ERA. Washington's other pitcher, Ash
ley Boek, is 13-8 with a 2.66 ERA.

"Last time we played them, they were both close games, both
decided by three-run homers," Rittman said. "Washington is
playing even better now. For us to beat them, we are going to have
to make sure to keep people off base in front of Kristen Rivera,
their big home run hitter, and we need to score some runs."
Rivera, 2(X)4 Pac-1() Player of the Year, paces the Huskies' of
fense with a .410 batting average, 14 home runs, 39 RBI and a .988
slugging percentage. Teammates Aimee Minor and Sarah Hyatt
have tallied 12 homers apiece and combined for 78 RBI.
Washington is riding a four-game winning streak, with recent
wins over UCLA and Nevada, and is undefeated at home this sea
son.
As s(x>n as the game ends on Friday, the Cardinal will hit the
road and get ready to face off with the two-time defending na
tional champion Bruins. This marks the first meeting between the
two schools since the Bruins claimed a 3-1 victory in 12 innings in
the Women's College World Series, which knocked the Cardinal
out of contention.
Though UCLA's roster has changed significantly since then,
the team has remained in the top 10 and posted big wins over No.
11 Georgia, No. 3 California and No. 2 Arizona this season.
"They lost their great pitcher, Keira Goerl, to graduation but
they have a freshman, Anjelica Selden, who is throwing really well
and Lisa Dodd (who pitched against us and beat us once last
year)," Rittman said. "They are a very capable team and they
have a lot of weapons offensively, with girls who can hit with a lot
of power, and they have great team speed. They are really the pro
totypical Pac-lOteam."
Ace pitcher Selden (16-6) boasts a 0.62 ERA and 280 strike
outs. All together the pitching staff has held opponents to a .172
batting average. Andrea Duran and Emily Zaplatosch headline
the Bruins' offense and Zaplatosch leads the team with 28 RBI.
No player has hit more than six homers but the offense is very bal
anced with eight different players posting at least two homers.
Despite the potential intimidation factor, the Cardinal said
they do not see this game as any different from any other on the
Pac-10 schedule.
"UCLA is always good and they always bring their 'A'
game, so we'll have to bring ours," Beardman said. "All we can
do is play Stanford Softball. We don't need to make an excep
tion for UCLA or play any differently. If we play our game we
should do well."
The trip to Los Angeles will be a homecoming for many mem
bers of the Stanford roster. Eight players — freshmen Nydam,
Smith, Beardman and Tricia Aggabao, as well as juniors Lauren
Lappin and Megan Bordelon and seniors Elizabeth Bendig and
Heather Shook — hail from Southern California and can count
on support from friends and family.
"I can't wait for my family to come out and watch me play,"
Beardman said. "It is always exciting to go home."
"I really am excited," Nydam agreed. "A lot of my friends and
former teammates and relatives are planning to come. It may be
sold out, which would be really disappointing, if they can't get in."
