(U-WIRE) NORMAL 111. —The decision to
approve over-the-counter access to emergency
contraception has been delayed, and students
across the country are demanding the Food and
Drug Administration approve emergency contra
ception now.
A few years ago the company that produces the
emergency contraception called Plan B submitted
an application to the FDA for approval, Nisha Gu
lati, senior campus organi/er at Illinois State Uni
versity for the Feminist Majority Foundation, said.
The Non-Prescription Drug Committee and the
Reproductive Health Committee determined
whether it was going to be safe and effective, what
side effects would reside and if Plan B met all the
requirements.

It was overwhelmingly voted 23-4 in favor of ap
proval. Gulati added. The decision then sat in the
hands of acting FDA Commissioner Lester M.
Crawford.
"Indecision existed for awhile and there was
delay after delay," Gulati said.
Right wing politicians intervened in the process
by writing letters to the Bush administration re
questing the denial of approval of Plan B. accord
ing to Jessie Raeder, senior campus organizer for
the Feminist Majority Foundation.
Currently two senators, Hilary Clinton and
Patty Murray, are threatening to block confirma
tion of the IDA nominee commissioner if Plan B is
not approved. Raeder added.
"Feminists, along with Clinton and Murray, are
pressuring Crawford to make a decision while he
delays," Gulati said.
In May 2004 the FDA nominee commissioner

rejected Plan B due to a lack of information. This
forced Plan B to resubmit its application, Gulati ex
plained. On Jan. 21,2(X)5, Crawford postponed the
approval for Plan B indefinitely.
"Allowing access to this drug would prevent up
to 1.7 million unwanted pregnancies a year," Raed
er said.
' The approval of over-the-counter emergency
contraception is long overdue," Gulati said. 'Twen
ty-six other countries including France and Eng
land have emergency contraception available."
Medical professionals are concerned the acces
sibility of Plan B over-the-counter will lead to the
misuse of the drug which continues to delay the ap
proval of the drug, Jim Almeda, health educator
for Student I lealth Services, said.
"The concerns are similar to the concerns for
birth control. There are health issues to assess be
fore handing out the drug," he said.
