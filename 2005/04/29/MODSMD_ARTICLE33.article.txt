# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## For the athlete in every ProFro

lam a grumpy senior. That's me I'm Stanford
Class of 2005, and I'm just about out of here.
So ProFros, write me off. I'm old. I'm de
crepit. I'm hardly worth Botox at this point — I
may as well just throw in the towel, rent a nice
condo by the beach and sip Ensure until it's time
to visit that great farm in the sky.
But 1 still see you all, clutching those red
folders, waiting for that first facial hair to come
in — puberty is a beautiful thing kids; changing
bodies, changing minds — and wondering if
"Van Wilder" is really true. No, you're proba
bly too young to have seen "Van Wilder." See,
I'm already dating myself — which is conve
nient since no girl will look at me twice.
But look at your dewy eyes! Look at that
sparkle of brilliance! Look at that girl in the
fourth row in MemAud! Call me a big softie full

of puppies, kittens and
Pro Fro kisses, hut I just have
to help you guys out. I mean, I
was so naive at your age that I
actually thought John Brav
man was underexposed, a
cappella groups would have
an impact on my life and
FroSoCo does in fact cause
the infamous "Triple O."
So with that spirit of pas-

sion an<J excitement just dripping from the most
recent Simps performance — "CoHo, FloMo,
HoHo, RoHo ... everything here is abbreviat
ed !o rhyme with 'Ho'! HAHAHAHAHA!
HOHOHOHOHQ! HAHO HAHO HAHO!"
— I would like to help you, Class of 2()o9er,
'cause the Simps just aren't cutting it.
I know that many of you are former athletes
who just can't cut it at the D-l level.
Hell. 1 was too. I'm sure that many of you
want to know where to devote your athletic en
ergies to on the farm. To that, I offer you a myr
iad of options.
For the athlete who can't make the varsity
roster, there is a wide array of club sports to join.
However, because of an Athletic Department
rule, there can be no club team in a sport where
a varsity sport currently exists. To that I say
"Curling ... it's the new football."
There are, however, the nationally powerful
ultimate Frisbee teams, the rugby team and the
men's lacrosse team, to name a few sports
you've at least watched before.
As for varsity teams that frequently need
student-athletes, there are the crew teams. Un
fortunately, my lawyers have advised me that I
cannot discuss this sport without jeopardizing
my friends, my family and myself. I 'm not here
to talk about the past; I'm here to talk about the
future. Thanks, Mark McGwire.
But what about other athletic activities?
Well, are free to walk around campus again

The Cardinal golf team's performance at the Pac-10 Championships gives the squad a good chance of being awarded a
berth to the NCAA Regional, which will be held at the Stanford golf course.
sides, so there is always ihe prospect
of a nice jog around campus. For
those of you who don't know the seri
al groper, he was just a guy who
would bike around campus a couple
years ago, grab a handful of grade-A
Pac-10 backside and bike off. Now. 1
know this may be a "serious" issue,
but 1 know fora fact that one girl ac
tually was flattered to be groped, and
to think of it. so would 1,
1 mean, think about it! What if you
saw the serial groper bike behind you.
thinking about grabbing your ass, and
then passing? What does that say
about your sexual attractiveness?

Think about the emotional conse
quence of a girl thinking she is so ugly
not even the serial groper would
touch her!
There must be more than just club
sports and groping, though. Well,
there is Facebook stalking, but I see
that an appalling number of you are
already on Thefacebook.com, which
just makes me empathize with the
NBA's proposal for an age limit more
and more.
Seriously though, the class of '09 is
in a great position to reap the benefits
of a renewed focus on student recre
ation. Back in the day (read: now),
students only had off-peak hours at
Arrillaga or had to endure the Petri
dish of cultured finger fungus that is
Tresidder Fitness. With the construc

ational athletes, your workout rou

tine will not he interrupted by some
one spilling his Treehouse nachos on
your Stairmaster.
Finally, there are intramurals.
You can compete just like you did in
highschool and also referee, thanks to
generally incompetent and easily per
suaded officials. The goal in intramu
rals is to win it all, thereby receiving
the coveted IM Champion shirt,
which I have never done. It would be
my crowning achievement, but after
losing 3-1 to KA on Wednesday, I
don't even know if 1 can get it done.
Maybe you. beautiful 2009er, can do
it.
Oh. and Class of 2005: Buy your
freaking formal tickets. Seriously.
It's at SBC Park for Chrissakes. What
more could you want?
