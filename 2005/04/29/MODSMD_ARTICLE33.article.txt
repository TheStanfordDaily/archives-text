# Jeff Dorman Sucks!
## For the athlete in every ProFro 
### 
lam a grumpy senior. That's me I'm Stanford
Class of 2005, and I'm just about out of here.
So ProFros, write me off. I'm old. I'm de
crepit. I'm hardly worth Botox at this point — I
may as well just throw in the towel, rent a nice
condo by the beach and sip Ensure until it's time
to visit that great farm in the sky.
But 1 still see you all, clutching those red
folders, waiting for that first facial hair to come
in — puberty is a beautiful thing kids; changing
bodies, changing minds — and wondering if
"Van Wilder" is really true. No, you're proba
bly too young to have seen "Van Wilder." See,
I'm already dating myself — which is conve
nient since no girl will look at me twice.
But look at your dewy eyes! Look at that
sparkle of brilliance! Look at that girl in the
fourth row in MemAud! Call me a big softie full

of puppies, kittens and
Pro Fro kisses, hut I just have
to help you guys out. I mean, I
was so naive at your age that I
actually thought John Brav
man was underexposed, a
cappella groups would have
an impact on my life and
FroSoCo does in fact cause
the infamous "Triple O."
So with that spirit of pas-

sion an<J excitement just dripping from the most
recent Simps performance — "CoHo, FloMo,
HoHo, RoHo ... everything here is abbreviat
ed !o rhyme with 'Ho'! HAHAHAHAHA!
HOHOHOHOHQ! HAHO HAHO HAHO!"
— I would like to help you, Class of 2()o9er,
'cause the Simps just aren't cutting it.
I know that many of you are former athletes
who just can't cut it at the D-l level.
Hell. 1 was too. I'm sure that many of you
want to know where to devote your athletic en
ergies to on the farm. To that, I offer you a myr
iad of options.
For the athlete who can't make the varsity
roster, there is a wide array of club sports to join.
However, because of an Athletic Department
rule, there can be no club team in a sport where
a varsity sport currently exists. To that I say
"Curling ... it's the new football."
There are, however, the nationally powerful
ultimate Frisbee teams, the rugby team and the
men's lacrosse team, to name a few sports
you've at least watched before.
As for varsity teams that frequently need
student-athletes, there are the crew teams. Un
fortunately, my lawyers have advised me that I
cannot discuss this sport without jeopardizing
my friends, my family and myself. I 'm not here
to talk about the past; I'm here to talk about the
future. Thanks, Mark McGwire.
But what about other athletic activities?
Well, are free to walk around campus again
tfftthbut the Serial groper tyrannizing their back-

The Cardinal golf team's performance at the Pac-10 Championships gives the squad a good chance of being awarded a
berth to the NCAA Regional, which will be held at the Stanford golf course.
