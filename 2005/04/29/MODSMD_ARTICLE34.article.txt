# Stanford sweeps Santa Cruz races
## Cyclists take shot at WCCC crown 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The racing conditions at the
Western Collegiate Cycling
Conference Championships,
which begin tomorrow in Reno,
Nev.. will be nothing like those
that teams braved last weekend
at UC-Santa Cruz.
Instead of steep hills and rain,
riders this weekend will battle
the effects of the high altitude
and a dry heat, but Stanford
hopes it enjoys similar success.
Stanford increased its lead in
the Team Omnium standings by
sweeping all three races in Santa
Cruz last weekend, and several
of the team's top riders re
mained in contention for Indi
vidual Omnium titles.
On Saturday, Stanford won
the Road Race behind masters
student Amber Rais' first-place
finish in the Women's A and
masters student Scott Giles'
third-place finish in the Men's
A. Rais' riding support. Ashley
Fouts and Sheela Singla, placed
fourth and sixth, respectively. .
"It's not unusual for
Women's As to be the top scor
ing category for our team and
that might not happen without
those two dedicated riders doing
a lot of hard work that might be
out of the spotlight," Giles said.
Stanford won both the Indi
vidual and the Hill Climb Time
Trials on Sunday. Rand Miller
and David Pierce placed seventh
and eighth, respectively, in the
Men's A ITT, and Rais and
Fouts placed first and third, re
spectively, in the Women's A.
Rais heads into tomorrow's
WCCC Championships tied
with UC-Santa Cruz's Brooke
Miller, who finished second in
Saturday's Road Race, for first
place in the Women's A Omni
um standings. Pierce is within
striking distance of Cal Poly's

Ken Hanson for first place in the
Men's A, while Giles is looking
to move up from eighth place.
Fouts is sixth in the Women's A
standings.
In the Women's B. freshman
Alicia Cooperman is in fourth
place in the Omnium standings
after riding to sixth-, third- and
seventh-place finishes in Santa
Cruz. Senior Allison Paine, who
finished third in Sunday's Hill
Climb, is 11th.
Ken Wu and Tevis Jacobs,
who placed third in the Men's C
Road Race, are both in the top
10 of the Men's C standings.
Stanford's A teams per
formed well in Sunday's ITT. as
Giles and Miller placed fifth and
sixth, respectively, for the men,
while Rais and Fouts finished 1-
2 for the women.
"The greatest thing about the
Men's A squad is that it mirrors
the team in general — strength
across the board," Giles said.
"Each rider on this squad could
probably do very well alone, and
if the situation demands, each
rider has demonstrated that they
can ride with the best in the con
ference and fight for and win
podium spots."
While the Men's A — Giles
included — enjoyed another
solid weekend in Santa Cruz, he
said he is impressed with the de
velopment and contributions of
the team's riders in other divi
sions.
"Our corps of new riders in
the Men's Cs and Women's Bs
have been learning to ride
strong and endure suffering for
the fruits of success and win
ning." Giles said. "We have
some real standouts in the high
ly contested Men's B field."
Among those standouts is
freshman Ryan Parnes, who had
three strong races in Santa Cruz
