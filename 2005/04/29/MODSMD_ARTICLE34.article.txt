# Stanford sweeps Santa Cruz races
## Cyclists take shot at WCCC crown 
### SCOTT ALLEN MANAGING EDITOR 
The racing conditions at the
Western Collegiate Cycling
Conference Championships,
which begin tomorrow in Reno,
Nev.. will be nothing like those
that teams braved last weekend
at UC-Santa Cruz.
Instead of steep hills and rain,
riders this weekend will battle
the effects of the high altitude
and a dry heat, but Stanford
hopes it enjoys similar success.
Stanford increased its lead in
the Team Omnium standings by
sweeping all three races in Santa
Cruz last weekend, and several
of the team's top riders re
mained in contention for Indi
vidual Omnium titles.
On Saturday, Stanford won
the Road Race behind masters
student Amber Rais' first-place
finish in the Women's A and
masters student Scott Giles'
third-place finish in the Men's
A. Rais' riding support. Ashley
Fouts and Sheela Singla, placed
fourth and sixth, respectively. .
"It's not unusual for
Women's As to be the top scor
ing category for our team and
that might not happen without
those two dedicated riders doing
a lot of hard work that might be
out of the spotlight," Giles said.
Stanford won both the Indi
vidual and the Hill Climb Time
Trials on Sunday. Rand Miller
and David Pierce placed seventh
and eighth, respectively, in the
Men's A ITT, and Rais and
Fouts placed first and third, re
spectively, in the Women's A.
Rais heads into tomorrow's
WCCC Championships tied
with UC-Santa Cruz's Brooke
Miller, who finished second in
Saturday's Road Race, for first
place in the Women's A Omni
um standings. Pierce is within
striking distance of Cal Poly's

Ken Hanson for first place in the
Men's A, while Giles is looking
to move up from eighth place.
Fouts is sixth in the Women's A
standings.
In the Women's B. freshman
Alicia Cooperman is in fourth
place in the Omnium standings
after riding to sixth-, third- and
seventh-place finishes in Santa
Cruz. Senior Allison Paine, who
finished third in Sunday's Hill
Climb, is 11th.
Ken Wu and Tevis Jacobs,
who placed third in the Men's C
Road Race, are both in the top
10 of the Men's C standings.
Stanford's A teams per
formed well in Sunday's ITT. as
Giles and Miller placed fifth and
sixth, respectively, for the men,
while Rais and Fouts finished 1-
2 for the women.
"The greatest thing about the
Men's A squad is that it mirrors
the team in general — strength
across the board," Giles said.
"Each rider on this squad could
probably do very well alone, and
if the situation demands, each
rider has demonstrated that they
can ride with the best in the con
ference and fight for and win
podium spots."
While the Men's A — Giles
included — enjoyed another
solid weekend in Santa Cruz, he
said he is impressed with the de
velopment and contributions of
the team's riders in other divi
sions.
"Our corps of new riders in
the Men's Cs and Women's Bs
have been learning to ride
strong and endure suffering for
the fruits of success and win
ning." Giles said. "We have
some real standouts in the high
ly contested Men's B field."
Among those standouts is
freshman Ryan Parnes, who had
three strong races in Santa Cruz
and leads the Men's B standings by
21 points. He placed second in the
Men's B Road Race, won the
Men's B ITT the following day by
three seconds and placed seventh
in the HCTT.
Last weekend also included
some sad news for the team. Men's
C rider Christopher Lucas suffered
a broken femur when he crashed at
the beginning of Sunday's ITT
alter catching his front wheel on
wet railroad tracks. Lucas under
went surgery to have the bones
pinned together and has begun re
habilitation therapy.
"It was a total freak accident, at
least in terms of the extremity of
consequence," said head coach Art
Walker, who visited Lucas in the
hospital. "Chris was by no means
our top scorer in the Cs. but the un
derstanding that this could have
happened to any of them, and a
growing understanding of the im
pact this will have for at least the

next several months of his life,
have caused this to he keenly felt
amongst his teammates."
Per doctor's orders, Lucas will
not travel to root on his team in
Reno. A Team Time Trial and Cri
terium will he held Saturday and
the WCCC season will culminate
with a Road Race on Sunday.
Stanford leads California by 28
points in the Team Omnium stand
ings, but with scores worth more
this weekend, the top spot is not se
cure.
"The extra 14 points added to
our lead by the first race of the
weekend [in Santa Cruz] seems
nontrivial, but is easily less than
typical swings of pure fortune
which occur during a champi
onship weekend," Walker said.
"The likelihood that the final mar
gin is less than those 14 points is
pretty small."
If Stanford can protect its lead
this weekend, it will mark the
team's first WCCC title since the
1995-1996 season and only its sec
ond since 1985. Walker echoed
Giles' sentiments that the key to
this year's success has been the
wealth of strong races in every di

vision.
"This team has had very pro
ductive lower category scoring rel
ative to some other years when the
team contended for the conference
title," Walker said. "In 1997 when
we last won Nationals, we did not
win our own conference because
our scoring was top-heavy — the
weakness in lower categories was
hidden at Nationals."
Walker, who began coaching
the team in 1992 after riding for
Stanford from 1983 to 1986, and
again in 1989 while in graduate
school, is leaving the team after
this season to be with his fiancee,
who took a faculty position in Port
land.
Giles said the team is poised to
send Walker out with a WCCC
title.
"I'm a lucky rider to be a part of
such an awesome team," Giles
said. "That feels pretty good and
I'm ready for Championships, but I
feel like the momentum of the
team is bigger than the sum of its
parts. There's that something in
the air. This team is ready to rum
ble."

Reno. A Team Time Trial and Cri
terium will he held Saturday and
the WCCC season will culminate
with a Road Race on Sunday.
Stanford leads California by 28
points in the Team Omnium stand
ings, but with scores worth more
this weekend, the top spot is not se
cure.
"The extra 14 points added to
our lead by the first race of the
weekend [in Santa Cruz] seems
nontrivial, but is easily less than
typical swings of pure fortune
which occur during a champi
onship weekend," Walker said.
"The likelihood that the final mar
gin is less than those 14 points is
pretty small."
If Stanford can protect its lead
this weekend, it will mark the
team's first WCCC title since the
1995-1996 season and only its sec
ond since 1985. Walker echoed
Giles' sentiments that the key to
this year's success has been the
wealth of strong races in every di

vision.
"This team has had very pro
ductive lower category scoring rel
ative to some other years when the
team contended for the conference
title," Walker said. "In 1997 when
we last won Nationals, we did not
win our own conference because
our scoring was top-heavy — the
weakness in lower categories was
hidden at Nationals."
Walker, who began coaching
the team in 1992 after riding for
Stanford from 1983 to 1986, and
again in 1989 while in graduate
school, is leaving the team after
this season to be with his fiancee,
who took a faculty position in Port
land.
Giles said the team is poised to
send Walker out with a WCCC
title.
"I'm a lucky rider to be a part of
such an awesome team," Giles
said. "That feels pretty good and
I'm ready for Championships, but I
feel like the momentum of the
team is bigger than the sum of its
parts. There's that something in
the air. This team is ready to rum
ble."

The Stanford cycling team will have a 28-point lead over California in the Team Omnium standings heading into the
conference championships.
The racing conditions at the
Western Collegiate Cycling
Conference Championships,
which begin tomorrow in Reno,
Nev.. will be nothing like those
that teams braved last weekend
at UC-Santa Cruz.
Instead of steep hills and rain,
riders this weekend will battle
the effects of the high altitude
and a dry heat, but Stanford
hopes it enjoys similar success.
Stanford increased its lead in
the Team Omnium standings by
sweeping all three races in Santa
Cruz last weekend, and several
of the team's top riders re
mained in contention for Indi
vidual Omnium titles.
On Saturday, Stanford won
the Road Race behind masters
student Amber Rais' first-place
finish in the Women's A and
masters student Scott Giles'
third-place finish in the Men's
A. Rais' riding support. Ashley
Fouts and Sheela Singla, placed
fourth and sixth, respectively. .
"It's not unusual for
Women's As to be the top scor
ing category for our team and
that might not happen without
those two dedicated riders doing
a lot of hard work that might be
out of the spotlight," Giles said.
Stanford won both the Indi
vidual and the Hill Climb Time
Trials on Sunday. Rand Miller
and David Pierce placed seventh
and eighth, respectively, in the
Men's A ITT, and Rais and
Fouts placed first and third, re
spectively, in the Women's A.
Rais heads into tomorrow's
WCCC Championships tied
with UC-Santa Cruz's Brooke
Miller, who finished second in
Saturday's Road Race, for first
place in the Women's A Omni
um standings. Pierce is within
striking distance of Cal Poly's

Ken Hanson for first place in the
Men's A, while Giles is looking
to move up from eighth place.
Fouts is sixth in the Women's A
standings.
In the Women's B. freshman
Alicia Cooperman is in fourth
place in the Omnium standings
after riding to sixth-, third- and
seventh-place finishes in Santa
Cruz. Senior Allison Paine, who
finished third in Sunday's Hill
Climb, is 11th.
Ken Wu and Tevis Jacobs,
who placed third in the Men's C
Road Race, are both in the top
10 of the Men's C standings.
Stanford's A teams per
formed well in Sunday's ITT. as
Giles and Miller placed fifth and
sixth, respectively, for the men,
while Rais and Fouts finished 1-
2 for the women.
"The greatest thing about the
Men's A squad is that it mirrors
the team in general — strength
across the board," Giles said.
"Each rider on this squad could
probably do very well alone, and
if the situation demands, each
rider has demonstrated that they
can ride with the best in the con
ference and fight for and win
podium spots."
While the Men's A — Giles
included — enjoyed another
solid weekend in Santa Cruz, he
said he is impressed with the de
velopment and contributions of
the team's riders in other divi
sions.
"Our corps of new riders in
the Men's Cs and Women's Bs
have been learning to ride
strong and endure suffering for
the fruits of success and win
ning." Giles said. "We have
some real standouts in the high
ly contested Men's B field."
Among those standouts is
freshman Ryan Parnes, who had
three strong races in Santa Cruz
and leads the Men's B standings by
21 points. He placed second in the
Men's B Road Race, won the
Men's B ITT the following day by
three seconds and placed seventh
in the HCTT.
Last weekend also included
some sad news for the team. Men's
C rider Christopher Lucas suffered
a broken femur when he crashed at
the beginning of Sunday's ITT
alter catching his front wheel on
wet railroad tracks. Lucas under
went surgery to have the bones
pinned together and has begun re
habilitation therapy.
"It was a total freak accident, at
least in terms of the extremity of
consequence," said head coach Art
Walker, who visited Lucas in the
hospital. "Chris was by no means
our top scorer in the Cs. but the un
derstanding that this could have
happened to any of them, and a
growing understanding of the im
pact this will have for at least the

next several months of his life,
have caused this to he keenly felt
amongst his teammates."
Per doctor's orders, Lucas will
not travel to root on his team in
Reno. A Team Time Trial and Cri
terium will he held Saturday and
the WCCC season will culminate
with a Road Race on Sunday.
Stanford leads California by 28
