# Tough course trips up golfers
## Stanford places sixth at Pac-10s

The final putts have been holed, and there are signa
tures on all the scorecards. All that remains now is the wait
ing.
On Wednesday, the Stanford mens golf team wrapped
up play at the Pacific-10 Conference Championship in
Walla Walla, Wash., with a four-round total of 1,438 (18
over par). The Cardinal's score was good fora sixth-place
finish and should make it difficult for the selection com
mittee to ignore Stanford as it narrows down the field for
the NCAA Western Regional in May.
Meanwhile, Washington mounted a final-round charge
on Wednesday to tie Arizona State at 1,425 (five over par),
winning the tiebreaker by shooting the lower score in the
last round.
The Regional will take place at the Stanford Golf
Course, offering the Cardinal an excellent chance to reach
their first NCAA Championship as a team since 1996.
This year's Pac-10 Championship, held at the Walla
Walla Country Club, forced players to learn a new and de
ceptive layout as they competed for the conference title.
"[The golf course] was a wolf in sheep's clothing," ju
nior Kyle Gentry said. "It had almost no rough and was
considerably shorter than every other course we play all
year, and yet it played really difficult. The greens were the
size of conference tables, and the trees, having experience
in them, were perfectly situated to block out your second,
third and even fourth shots."
The equal potential for making big numbers or going
low sent teams and players careening all over the leader
board during the week.
A case in point was Arizona State's Pat Moore, who ap
peared poised to capture his second consecutive tourna
ment victory, shooting rounds of 67,67,69 on Monday and
Tuesday. The wheels came off the wagon in his final nine
holes, however, as a rash of bogeys and double-bogeys al
lowed Washington's Erik Olson to sneak past him to claim
the individual crown.
For Stanford, freshman Rob Grube once again led the
way with his second consecutive top-five showing.
After a runner-up finish at Stanford's U.S. Intercolle
giate in which an uncooperative putter cost him his first col
legiate victory by just two strokes* Grube came out firing
once again in Washington, shooting rounds of 69 and 72 on
Monday. His five-under-par 66 on Tuesday tied for the low
round of the tournament, and he locked up a fourth-place
finish with a 73 on Wednesday morning.
"I have definitely hit the ball better than I ever have
during the past couple of weeks," Grube said. "I felt really
comfortable and confident out there. Personally, I'll take a
lot of momentum toward Regionals. I want to win a tour
nament before the year is done, and 1 feel that my game
and the home course advantage bode well fora victory."
