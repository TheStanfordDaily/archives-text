# Bach leads Card's offensive charge
## 
### DANIEL NOVINSON STAFF WRITER 
With the women's lacrosse
squad just a day away from its reg
ular-season finale at Ohio State (5-
8), junior attacker Sarah Bach
knows her performance will go a
long way toward determining the
Cardinal's fate. Fortunately for
Stanford (10-5, 5-0 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation), Bach's
performances have been nothing
hut clutch throughout this season.
Bach's nine scores in the Cardi
nal's first two contests of the sea
son preceded a four-goal game
against Colgate a month later,
highlighting her offensive explo
siveness. The Baltimore, Md., na
tive has found the back of the net
seven games in a row and leads the
team with 30 scores.
Not only have Bach's goals
come in bunches, they've also
come at crucial times. From her
breakaway game-winner with 55
seconds left in a 9-8 victory over
Yale to her latest offensive tri
umphs — hat tricks in consecutive
narrow victories over Denver and
Loyola — Bach has repeatedly
turned would-be losses into Cardi
nal wins. Not only is Bach Stan
ford's most prolific scorer, but with
a 53.6 shooting percentage — the
highest of any Cardinal with at
least five scores — Bach is also
one of the squad's most efficient
scorers.
Bach says self-confidence plays
an essential role in her offensive
dominance.
"Heading into a game, you
can't have wavering confidence, or
else you're not going to play well,"
Bach said. "Somehow, 1 came into
this season with a lot more confi
dence than in the past. I want to
keep that up and not let anything
rock my confidence at all. No mat
ter who's guarding me, if 1 make
the right move 1 can beat them. 1
just have to keep doing what I've
been doing right, and keep moving
in the attack."
By her own admission, even if
opponents do manage to slow
down her scoring, foes face a far

tougher task in trying to derail her
confidence.
"Basically, during a game in
which I'm playing well and scoring
goals, I'm thinking if I can do it one
time, I can do it again," Bach said.
"If not, my confidence doesn't
waver. I just gain more confidence
in my teammates — 1 know some
one else is doing a lot better."
While self-assured. Bach
doesn't let her on-the-field star
dom overwhelm her. She is quick
to credit her teammates and al
most dismissive of twice being
named the MPSF Player of the
Week.
"It's awesome to get recogni
tion for playing, but I think any
person on our team could have
gotten that every single week,"
Bach said. "It's pretty arbitrary,
but it's an honor."
Off the field. Bach is majoring
in psychology and aspires to be
come an elementary school teach
er after graduating.
"With one year left [at Stan
ford ], I just want to finish strong
and maintain the balance between
school and lacrosse," Bach said. "I
want to keep doing well."
Bach said she also wants to im
prove her game.
"I've been working periodically
on getting into the draw," Bach
said. "I also want to work on my
play in the midfield. On the offen
sive end. I want to be more of a
leader and direct our team better.
When I'm not doing something
well, I want to help other people
step up."
Bach envisions several ways her
team can step up against the Buck
eyes tomorrow.
"Offensively, we want to keep
up the momentum we've been
showing in previous games," Bach
said. "We're scoring a lot; we're a
solid unit and we've proven we can
beat defenses. In the midfield, we
need to start getting more draws.
At Loyola, we couldn't get a draw
fora little while and it hurt us.
"In practice, we're just working
on building what we've already

been doing and carry it into the next
game. We want to keep improving
and beat anyone that we play."
Win or lose in Columbus, Ohio,
Bach will continue to cherish the
connections she has made with her
teammates.
"We are the most close-knit
group of girls," Bach said. "I am ob
sessed with every one of my team
mates. On the field, I have the ut
most confidence in each and every
one of them. Off the field, we're
such good friends. We've been trav
eling a lot lately, and it's just fun to
go places with these girls."
