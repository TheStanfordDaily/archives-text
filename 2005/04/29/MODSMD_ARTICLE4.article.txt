engineering, medicine, business, the humani
ties and education, although undergraduates
and faculty from a variety of backgrounds will
be able to participate as well.
The d.school has already raised $35 mil

and its contiguity, is well positioned to pursue
such interdisciplinary initiatives [which] will
require new funding and new facilities, as well
as new ways of organizing teaching and re
search," he told the council.
The d.school will fill a unique role in the
design community at Stanford, as a truly
multi-disciplinary venture. The glue that will
hold the projects together will be what the
d.school's founders refer to as "design think-
