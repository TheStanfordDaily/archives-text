# Design institute is born

### BONNIE SWIFT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Institute for Design, com
monly referred to as the d.school is in the
process of being launched. It will be a place
for interdisciplinary design research and
teaching. Projects and courses at the d.school
will mainly be offered to graduate students in
engineering, medicine, business, the humani
ties and education, although undergraduates
and faculty from a variety of backgrounds will
be able to participate as well.
The d.school has already raised $35 mil
lion from a single private donor, and is close
to meeting its fundraising goals. In addition,
the Stanford School of Engineering has do
nated the Peteresen Building to house the
d.school, which is close to the Main Quad and

currently under renovation.
University President John Hennessy, in an
annual address made earlier this month to the
Academic Council, said the campus needs to
invest more in interdisciplinary projects that
benefit humanity and the environment.
"Stanford, with its breadth of excellence
and its contiguity, is well positioned to pursue
such interdisciplinary initiatives [which] will
require new funding and new facilities, as well
as new ways of organizing teaching and re
search," he told the council.
The d.school will fill a unique role in the
design community at Stanford, as a truly
multi-disciplinary venture. The glue that will
hold the projects together will be what the
d.school's founders refer to as "design think-

ing."
In a March 14TIME Magazine ar
ticle written about the new d.school.
Co-founder David Kelley is quoted,
"For me, it's like a religious thing. I
truly believe design thinking will
make your life better."
Having worked extensively de
signing products, services and envi
ronments, the founders of the
d.school adhere to the idea that that
innovation is most likely to occur
when strong multidisciplinary groups
come together and explore the inter
section of their different points of
view, a method that is relatively
novel in an academic setting.
George Kembel, also a co
founder of the d.school said that,
"Design thinking cultivates a culture
of collaboration, and enables mem
bers of a team to move more quickly
and build on one another's ideas."
Reducing differences in status
and increasing leadership based on
who has expertise related to the
problem at hand are also core princi
ples in design thinking, Kembel
added. Stanford's location in the Sili
con Valley places the University in a
very convenient location for collabo
rative work with technologically in

novative industries, he said.
Both Kelley and Kembel have ex
tensive experience in the real world
of design. As a tenured professor in
Mechanical Engineering who has
taught at Stanford for more than 25
years, Kelley is also the co-founder of
the world-renowned design firm,
I DEO. According to the TIME Mag
azine article, IDEO has worked to
"bridge the gap between modern de
sign and modern business."
Kelley designed the very first
Apple computer mouse and the
light-up "LAVATORY OCCU
PIED" sign used in Boeing 7475.
During the 19905. IDEO was one of
the most prominent product-design
firms in the Silicon Valley, working
with big firms and producing hun
dreds of user-friendly designs, ac
cording to the TIME article.
Following the dot-com bust. IDEO
adapted its business model, and in
stead of designing products, expanded
to the design of environments and
processes, from admission to hospitals
to stocking supermarket shelves.
According to TIME, the d.school
will "take graduate students from a
grab bag of disciplines... and put
them together with real companies
like General Motors and Electronic
Arts facing real business challenges."
This would "blur the lines between
the firm and the classroom with the
goal not only to help the companies
but also to train the next generation

of business leaders and designers."
Many experts are hailing the idea
for the institute as revolutionary.
However, not everybody views such
close ties between industry and edu
cation as a purely positive trend.
Lora Oehlberg, a junior in Me
chanical Engineering, has been
working with the d.school and spent
last summer working at Palo Alto
Research Center's Computer Sci
ence Lab looking at what she re
ferred to as "the sociability of televi
sion." She said that her design skills
have been useful for observing and
developing prototypes. Interdiscipli
nary work, she said, "broadens the
horizons of engineering."
"Working with [experts from]
other fields gives you a better appre
ciation for what others do, but also
how you fit in with the rest of the
world," Oehlberg wrote in an email
from Stanford in Berlin. In her opin
ion. the d.school will play an impor
tant role in facilitating interdiscipli
nary collaboration.
Although the d.school does not
have an official space on campus yet,
the idea has been brewing for several
years, and students and faculty in
volved with the institute are current
ly prototyping classes to see what
works best. Many d.school faculty
and graduate students were involved
with the Stanford start-up company
"Ignite," which produces inexpen
sive LED-based lamps for develop

ing countries.
The d.school has also launched a
variety of interdisciplinary classes â€”
one that focuses on what design can
do to help children with autism, an
other that develops environmentally
sustainable products and others that
could refine processes of everyday
living, such as the school day of a
first-grader.
Computer Science Prof. Terry
Winograd has collaborated with Kel
ley in a course that has become a pro
totype for the d.school teaching
method. The class, "Interdisciplinary
Interaction Design" executes projects
that cross the boundaries between de
sign and computing and focuses on
computer interactions that support
and enhance human experience, ac
cording to the d.school's Web site.
Stanford's Joint Program in De
sign was initiated by Prof. Robert
McKim in 1958. The design program
is offered by both the Mechanical
Engineering Department and the
Department of Art and Art History.
The d.school will expand the range of
collaboration beyond the engineer
ing and art departments to include
experts from other fields.
A core team of Stanford faculty
and students from computer science,
mechanical engineering, manage
ment science and engineering, and
the Graduate School of Business are
currently developing different as
pects of the d.school.
