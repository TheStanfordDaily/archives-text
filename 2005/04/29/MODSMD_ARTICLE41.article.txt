WASHINGTON. D.C. — Declaring President
George W. Bush the victor in the election against
Sen. John Kerry, White House Chief of Staff An
drew Card announced early this morning he was
confident that the president had won Ohio's elec
toral votes.
Bush left 4,000 of his supporters hanging in an
ticipation last night when he opted not to appear at
the Republican National Committee's "2004 Vic
tory Celebration" at the Ronald Reagan Building
and International Trade Center. Most television
networks' projections left Bush short of the neces
sary 270 electoral votes. Some people, including
Sen. Kerry, believe that provisional ballots and a
few remaining districts still uncounted in Ohio
leave the swing state too close to call.
As late as 3 a.m., Republican National Commit
tee Chairman Ed Gillespie, who was also chairman
of the festivities for the evening, tried to keep the
crowd's energy up. explaining that the remaining

votes to he counted in Ohio were not likely to to
tally erase Bush's 123,(XX) vote lead. Even though
there were 120,(MX) provisional votes that had to be
counted, Gillespie said, a large portion would be
discarded.
Still, the crowd of Bush supporters remained
confident and excited throughout the evening.
Many in the crowd were 20-something political
junkies who showed up to cheer on Bush's cam
paign for four more years in office and to rub el
bows with the staffs of the White House, the RNC
and Bush / Cheney '04 campaign.
"It is only fitting that our final stop to victory is
here in the Ronald Reagan Building," said Senate
Majority Leader Bill Frist.
The stage was draped with a giant American
flag and featured a blue backdrop with white stars
that illuminated the arched ceiling of the building's
modern interior. Against this setting, tiers of
cheering Bush supporters waved red and blue
cylindrical balloons declaring "GOP Victory."
Frist praised Bush's handling of a number of is
sues, including the Sept. 11 attacks. "We didn't run

away — we turned and faced our enemy," he said.
Frist also said the president had a plan to re
store economic growth and noted the tax cuts Bush
enacted all four years in office.
After every point he made, Frist repeated the
refrain that "President Bush has not wavered, and
we will win," and the audience chanted "we will
win" along with him.
Julia Tierney, a second year graduate student at
the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced Interna
tional Studies, said she is taking more of an interest
in the presidential election this year than ever be
fore.
"The world is in such an interesting place," she
said. "We're at a turning point in American histo
ry. This election will he a mandate for more of what
[ Bush] is doing or for something different."
As Bush received more and more votes
throughout the evening, the crowd of supporters
continued to cheer jubilantly.
