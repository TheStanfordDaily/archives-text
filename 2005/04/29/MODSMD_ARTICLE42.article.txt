# Major housing changes pitched by vice provost
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to improve undergraduate
students' residential experiences, the Uni
versity unveiled yesterday a proposal that
would fundamentally change the under
graduate housing system in coming years.
The changes will provide 650 new bed
spaces for undergraduates, more all-fresh
man housing, fewer occupants per room in
several residences and a Housing Draw that
places greater emphasis on seniority.
The proposal, entitled "Improving Un
dergraduate Housing at Stanford," was au
thored by Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman, who presented it
twice yesterday afternoon, to the University
Board of Trustees and to the ASSU execu
tives.
The plan would be implemented over the
next two to six years, depending on con
struction timelines and the University's
ability to raise enough funds.
However, Bravman said that nothing in
the proposal is final and that decisions will

not be made before feedback is collected
from students and other community mem
bers, a process that could take months or
even years.
"1 expect it will be a vigorous and honest
debate that takes into account the interests
of the University at large," he said in an in
terview with The Daily. "I'm hoping to
avoid flame-wars on e-mail chat lists and
angry letters to The Daily."
Becausethe changes would relocate Uja
maa House, from Lagunita to possibly Flo
rence Moore Hall. Bravman met with resi
dents for an hour and a half on Monday
night to go over the proposal.
He told The Daily that the proposed
changes to housing would:
. Meet demands for more all-freshman
housing: Bravman said that last year. 300 to
400 incoming students who listed a prefer
ence for all-freshman housing were put else
where. He also said he believes that most
freshmen are better served by all-freshman
housing. Bravman's proposal would turn

the dorms in Wilbur. Stern and Flo
rence Moore complexes, except for
theme dorms, into all-freshman
housing.
Create more desirable upper
class housing: The proposal would
convert Branner, Toyon, Roble and
Lagunita, "the four largest and most
elegant undergraduate residence
halls," as described in the proposal.

for upper-class use.
Restore academic program
spaces to residences: "Students tell
us all the time they don't have space
to study in their dorms," Bravman
said. The proposal would create,
through reorganization and con
struction, more study and seminar
spaces in residences all over cam
pus.
"Un-stuff" crowded dorm
rooms: Room occupancies would
be decreased at several residences
on campus. For example, Rohle
quads would become doubles, and
the Mirrielees apartments would

go back to housing two people in
stead of three.
Simplify the Housing Draw
along fairer lines: Bravman called
the current Housing Draw a
"labyrinthine" system that can re
sult in some students living in Bob
or Xanadu, popular Row houses, for
three years and other students living
in Wilbur all four years. The propos
al calls for "generally escalating
quality of housing over the course of
a student's time at Stanford."
