# Cardinal Ratzinger appointed new Pope
## 
### JENNY ALLEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Habemus papam! We have a
Pope! Bavarian Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger from Germany was
elected the 265 th pope on Tues
day, April 19, by the 115 cardi
nals who convened in the Sistine
Chapel. Bells were rung, white
smoke billowed into the sky and
78-year-old Ratzinger officially
took on the name Benedict XVI.
"From what I've heard, the

new pope seems to be a very
warm, personable man, which
stands in contrast to his per
ceived hardness that comes
across in his writings," said Fa
ther Carl Schlichte, acting direc
tor for the Catholic Community
at Stanford. "I hope with the ex
ample of his predecessor John
Paul 11, that this humanity will be
manifest to the Church and the
world during these next years."

Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger delivers his first address as Pope Benedict
XVI before a massive crowd in Rome.
Schlichte said he was surprised by the se
lection of the name Benedict XVI, explain
ing that Benedict XV served as pope during
World War I and aimed to make peace
while maintaining Vatican neutrality.
"Perhaps in our current world that
seems to be in a state of conflict, Benedict
XVI is hoping to bring his skills as a diplo
mat and peacemaker to the forefront in the
same way the predecessor from whom he
took his name did." Schlichte said.
Some students agree with Pope Bene
dict XVl's self-characterization as "a sim
ple, humble worker in the vineyard of the
Lord," as he said in his first Papal speech.
"I am thrilled to hear that Cardinal
Joseph Ratzinger was elected Pope Bene
dict XVI," sophomore Dennis Adams said.
"I have complete faith in the Holy Spirit
that he will do a fantastic job as the leader
of the Church. I had originally speculated
that this Pope would be from Latin Ameri
ca, but I was not surprised that Cardinal
Ratzinger was elected. He was a great ser

vant of the Church during Pope John Paul
li s pontificate, and I know that he will
serve the Church equally well as Pope."
Junior Alex Rivas said he was disap
pointed by the cardinals' choice, adding
that he hopes that Pope Benedict XVI will
merely serve as a transitional pope who will
not make the church more restrictive.
"I feel a bit alienated from the central
church in Rome right now," said Rivas, a
Roman Catholic. "The gap between my
personal beliefs and those of the central
church is growing, Catholics are
much more liberal than the church in
Rome, and 1 was disappointed that the
Church's leaders chose someone who is
conservative and not from outside Eu
rope."
Rivas said he believes the Church lead
ers could have done a better job of address
ing the needs and concerns of all Catholics
by paying more attention to Africa and
Latin America.
"Hopefully it will turn out that the re
formers in Rome will be able to make
progress after a short transitional reign of
Pope Benedict XVI," Rivas said.
