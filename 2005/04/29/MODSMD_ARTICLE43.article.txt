Habemus papam! We have a
Pope! Bavarian Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger from Germany was
elected the 265 th pope on Tues
day, April 19, by the 115 cardi
nals who convened in the Sistine
Chapel. Bells were rung, white
smoke billowed into the sky and
78-year-old Ratzinger officially
took on the name Benedict XVI.
"From what I've heard, the

new pope seems to be a very
warm, personable man, which
stands in contrast to his per
ceived hardness that comes
across in his writings," said Fa
ther Carl Schlichte, acting direc
tor for the Catholic Community
at Stanford. "I hope with the ex
ample of his predecessor John
Paul 11, that this humanity will be
manifest to the Church and the
world during these next years."
