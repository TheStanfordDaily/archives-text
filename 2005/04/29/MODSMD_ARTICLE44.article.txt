# ASSU election goes off without a hitch
## Kannokada/Okonkwo ticket wins 
### CYNTHIA H. CHO EDITOR IN CHIEF 
When the result of the ASSU ex
ecutive election was announced on
Friday, the 150 or so students gath
ered in the CoHo began to scan the
room to find the winners. The
Avalanche of Diversity slate was
there with supporters, including
megaphone-equipped members of
The Chaparral and an inflatable
turkey displayed on stage. But it
seemed as if neither the Carr /
Castillo slate nor the Kannokada /
Okonkwo slate had shown up.
Within minutes, however, the
victorious Melanie Kannokada and
Aneto Okonkwo, both juniors,
made their way from the back of the
CoHo to the stage to greet friends
and supporters.
Kannokada, who describes her
self as a "normally calm person,"
seemed to hold back tears as she re
ceived hugs and shook hands.
"What did 1 tell you? What did I tell
you?" shouted one eager supporter
as he approached the ASSU presi
dent-elect.
But Kannokada would be the
first to say that she was shocked by
the results.
"Everything that could have
gone wrong went wrong," she said

of her campaign in an interview
with The Stanford Daily following
the announcement. She listed the
late delivery of fliers and the failure
to receive endorsements from some
student organizations — including
the Students of Color Coalition and
The Daily — as two things that did
not work in her slate's favor. Both
Kannokada and Okonkwo admit
ted that before coming to the
CoHo, they thought that their
chances of a victory were slim.
However, no one seemed more
shocked than Victoria Carr. Sur
rounded by a dozen supporters, the
normally talkative junior remained
silent and seated at a table while her
running mate, junior Fernando
Castillo, stood by. The silence, it
seemed, was to maintain her com
posure. When she told The Daily
that she would prefer not to be in
terviewed. her eyes brimmed with
tears. Castillo also chose not to
comment.
The Carr / Castillo slate had run
a more visible campaign — in
White Plaza, for example, the
duo's posters greatly outnumbered
those of the Kannokada /
Okonkwo slate — and while no
slate had a clear edge going into
the two days of voting, there had
been some talk on campus that

Carr and Castillo would come out
on top. Among those who gathered
to listen to Elections Commission
er Troy Steinmetz, a sophomore,
announce the results of the elec
tion, there were more than a hand
ful of students who seemed sur
prised by the outcome.
While Kannokada and
Okonkwo were being interviewed
by The Daily, for example, one stu
dent approached the pair and
asked, "How did you do it? I mean,
did you get the IFC [Interfraternity
Council] vote?" The slate had re
ceived official endorsements from
both the IFC and the Intersorority
Council, as well as the Jewish Lead
ership Council and Club Sports.
Okonkwo said that while he and
Kannokada had not received what
some would say are key endorse
ments, they received support from
smaller student groups whose lead
ers encouraged members to vote.
He also explained that the pair ran
a "grassroots" campaign that fo
cused on door-to-door outreach in
order to "meet as many people as
possible." And he said that they
"focused on getting out the grad
vote."

appeared in The Daily on April 11.
