# Equally-priced meal plans unveiled
## Dining overhauled 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Dining officials unveiled
a plan to restructure residential din
ing yesterday in what they said was
an effort to make meal plans simpler,
more flexible and a better value for
students.
More than five months in the
making, the plan, which will go into
effect for the 2005-2(X)6 academic
year, came in response to student
feedback and a need for Stanford
Dining to tighten its budget. The
changes will make all residential din
ing halls all-you-care-to-eat, which is
more cost-effective for the Universi
ty. Students will be able to choose
from three meal plans, each of which
will cost $4,656 for three quarters.
This translates into $ 19.90 per day, an
average price increase of 2 percent
from the current system.
Two of the three new meal plans
will offer Cardinal Dollars, which
will be accepted at all Stanford Din
ing-run cafes. In addition to the
"unlimited" 19-meal-per-week
plan, which will not include Cardi
nal Dollars, there will be a 14-meal
per-week plan with 370 Cardinal
Dollars and a 12-meal-per-week
plan with 585 Cardinal Dollars.
Meal "points," which students use
now, will no longer exist.
The changes will not affect the
Row, eating clubs, or Yost and Mur
ray houses, which will maintain their
current dining programs.
"Our goal is to ensure that we are
responsive to students," said Rafi
Taherian, executive director of Stan
ford Dining.
Taherian and his staff gleaned stu
dent opinions through surveys and a
dinner series, during which adminis
trators talked one-on-one with un

dergraduates about their dining
needs.
Shirley Everett, associate vice
provost of residential and dining en
terprises, took part in the dinner se
ries and played a key role in develop
ing the proposal.
"We've taken into consideration
many, many opinions," she said.
"The challenge is to satisfy all of the
different palates."
Research conducted by Stanford
Dining indicated that student needs
had changed dramatically over the
past five years.
For example, the recent addition
of eateries such as Union Squared at
Tresidder Union has created a de
mand for greater flexibility, motivat
ing the decision to create Cardinal
Dollars that will be accepted at all
Stanford Dining venues.
"[Students] want to be able to go
around the campus, to eat in different
locations," Taherian said.
He also said he found there to be
a "perception of inequality" when
different meal plans are offered at a
range of prices.
"People with smaller meal plans
were paying more per meal; students
with larger meal plans felt like they
were subsidizing the smaller meal
plan." he said.
The new plan, Taherian ex
plained, will largely benefit ath
letes, freshmen and students on fi
nancial aid. Through surveys. Stan
ford Dining officials found that
athletes and freshmen often run
out of points under the a la carte
system. Also, the two-thirds of un
dergraduates who are on financial
aid were a major consideration,
Taherian said.
