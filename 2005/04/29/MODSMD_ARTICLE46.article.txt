## 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
Steve Jobs, chief executive officer of Apple Comput
er and PIXAR Animation Studio, will be Stanford's
2005 Commencement speaker. University President
John Hennessy announced yesterday.
Hennessy selected Jobs after receiving a list of rec
ommendations from a committee consisting of faculty
members Jody Maxmin and Eric Roberts, graduate
students Roger Stanley and Sohini Ramachandran
and senior class presidents Jen Graham. Steve Mvrick,
Paola Worsley and Spencer Porter.
"The name Steve Jobs is synonymous with innovation
and creativity over the past three decades," Hennessy
said in a press release. "Steve has been a leader and vi
sionary, a pioneer in the use of technology as a means to
create a more engaging and humanistic world. The advi
sory committee identified Steve as someone who per
sonified the spirit and creativity that have characterized
Stanford since its founding. This was an inspired recom
mendation, and I thank them for their thoughtful work."
Myrick explained that after gathering a list of sugges
tions from seniors, the committee narrowed the pool
based on several factors.

"A leader and visionary of the highest order and a fa
mously entertaining speaker. Mr. Jobs quickly rose to
the top of our list." he said. "We think that Mr. Jobs is
uniquely qualified to speak to seniors about the future of
technology, business and the creative arts. More impor
tantly, throughout his career he has maintained an in
tegrity that is a fine example for graduating seniors."
Seniors learned late last night via e-mail about
the selection.
"When 1 worked at Apple, all the VPs saw him as a
god because he turned Apple around as a company,"
said senior Timnit Gebru. who interned at Apple this
past summer. "What I'd like to learn from him is not to
give up and to never lose sight of what you can achieve."
Senior Amy Halvorsen agreed.
"I think it's a pretty appropriate selection for where we
are," she said. "I think it's impressive. I'm happy with it."
Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 and later co-founded
PIXAR in 1986. He is credited with igniting the person
al computer revolution that began in the 1980s and with
turning around Apple in the mid-19905, when it was on
the brink of bankruptcy.
