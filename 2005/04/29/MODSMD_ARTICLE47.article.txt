# Facebook helps frosh to forge friendships
## 
### DAVID HERBERT STAFF WRITER 
Felicia Yiu has already used The
facebook.com, the popular social
networking Web site, to sell concert
tickets and make new acquain
tances. She had 18 friends at Stan
ford as of Sept. 20. And that was be
fore she had even arrived on campus
for Orientation.
Yiu is one of 981 incoming fresh
men who joined Thefacebook before
they had moved into the dorms, tasted
dining hall food or heard the shrill
cries of "oh-eight!" from frenzied Ori
entation Volunteers.
"My friends from high sch(x)l kept
telling me to sign up," said Yiu. who
will live in Sena this year.
She said the site has already come in
handy. Stuck with several tickets to a
Pixies concert, she used the Web site's
search feature to find other Stanford
students who shared an interest in the
band, eventually selling the tickets and
making a few contacts in the process.
Her 18 Stanford friends online are
a collection of high school classmates,
students she met at a Stanford alumni
party in the East Bay and acquain
tances from her recent ticket experi
ence.
Other freshman have been using
Thefacebook's search feature to find
their dorm-mates. Larkin residents
Nila Bala and Kristin Hughes contact
ed each other through the Web site
and exchanged e-mails over the sum
mer. On move-in day, Bala was pleas
antly surprised to learn that Hughes
lives across the hall.

"It was easier coming to Stanford
knowing I knew a name and a face,"
she said. Besides being a social net
working tool, many students have also
come to view Thefacebook as a con
test to see who can have the most
"friends." With students racking up
dozens and even hundreds of friends
(one recent graduate clocked in at
764), some are beginning to wonder
what the true nature of Thefacebook
friendship is.
"You're not going to meet lifelong
friends online." said freshman An
drew Burmon. "I have no frickin' idea
(how many friends I have)," he added,
noting that he has received friendship
requests from Stanford students he
hardly knows. Having accepted all of
those requests. Burmon has 21 friends.
As Thefacebook's membership rolls
grow daily, some are concerned that
the program may have unintended
drawbacks for incoming freshmen.
"I think a lot of people are prone to
thinking slereotypically," said junior
Melissa Luu-Van, a resident assistant in
Larkin. where 59 of the 1 (X) freshman res
idents are registered (m Thefaceh >ok."lf
someone's picture looks 'gothy,' people
may think he or she is a 'goth.'"

community for Stanford freshmen.

after early acceptance letters are
mailed out in December. These e-mail
lists allow accepted students to contact
each other over the Internet, often at

Graduate students who commute on Caltrain from as far away as San Francisco can now
ride for free if they have special Go Pass stickers on their student ID cards.
