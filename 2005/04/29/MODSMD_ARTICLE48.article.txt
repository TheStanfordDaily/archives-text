# Union renovation now in the works
## 
### SARAH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
The University is planning a $24
million renovation of Old Union and
the surrounding areas to create a
more extensive student center by in
creasing the lawn space in the area,
opening up Old Union to White
Plaza and replacing the administra
tive offices that currently occupy Old
Union with spaces for student
groups.
"I think that it will greatly improve
campus life by providing a much
more defined center of student life in
the core of campus," said Eric Alli
son, a graduate student in aeronau
tics and astronautics who graduated
in 2002, and a member of the Student
Activities Space Task force. "It will
provide a signature location that peo
ple will associate with student life and
Stanford."
The task force was created in 2002
by Gene Awakuni, vice provost for
student affairs, to produce recom
mendations for how to best manage
the space in this region of campus and
includes students, faculty members
and administrators.
While a timeline for the changes
hasn't yet been released, the task
force has compiled a proposal with
five general recommendations for
the renovation.
First, the task force proposed the
creation of a "primary event zone"
between Tresidder Memorial Union
and the post office, which will include
an outside stage as an extension of
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The proposal also addressed the
need for more green space, prompt
ing the construction of more efficient

pathways and open space. The task
force suggested alleviating bike and
pedestrian traffic through White
Plaza by installing better bike racks
and linking pathways more directly
with those in the Main Quad.
The task force also expressed a
need for improved bike paths
across campus from east to west, to
make Santa Teresa Street more ac
cessible. Finally, the group recom
mended upgrading the areas where
students enter White Plaza in order
to make the space look more well
defined.
The plans urge the need for
restaurants in Old Union, including
food venues that will be open late at
night.
According to Laura Goldstein, a
facilities service administrator, the
offices inside Old Union will also
change. The registrar will move to a
different location, and the Offices of
Financial Aid and Undergraduate
Admission will relocate to the
Bakewell Building near the Ford
Center. The ASSU, the Office of Re
ligious Life and other shared offices
for student groups will relocate to
Old Union.
Both the Native American Cul
tural Center and the Asian American
Activities Center in the Old Union
Clubhouse as well as El Centro Chi
cano in the Nitery will remain where
they are.
"There was a feeling from the task
force that Tresidder and Old Union
should be more connected," said
Cathy Blake, assistant director of
campus planning and designing.
