# Black Student Union officers meet to review proposed changes
## Ujamaa contests housing plans 
### SIMON SHUSTER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Black Student Union held a
community meeting last night to dis
cuss the prospect of Ujamaa's relo
cation, which is proposed in the
housing changes announced last
month by John Bravman, vice
provost for undergraduate educa
tion.
BSU officers opened with an
overview of Bravman's proposal
and how they believe its enact
ment would uproot Ujamaa as a
hub for Stanford's black communi
ty. Yet much of the meeting served
as a forum for concerned and
angry community members to
voice their concerns, share their
personal fondness for Ujamaa and
call for sustained involvement in
relocation plans.
As written, the proposal would
move Ujamaa to Florence Moore

Hall, where the black-theme house
would not have the singles that often
attract new residents and would be
split into two separate but adjacent
dorms, BSU leaders said. The move
would happen in two to six years.
Some at the meeting said they
saw the stated intentions of the pro
posal as hypocritical in its treatment
of Ujamaa.
"Everything [Bravman] is trying
to give to the rest of the University,
he is taking away from our commu
nity," said audience member Kiah
Williams, a sophomore.
The main impetus for the propos
al has been threefold: to "unstuff"
the cramped dorm conditions on
campus, to offer premier housing
such as singles to more upperclass
men and to create more all-frosh
housing.
However, students at the meet
ing worried that Bravman's plan
would have the opposite effects on

Ujamaa.
"If the point is to unstuff under
graduate housing, then why would
they be taking away [Ujamaa's] sin
gles?" Williams said.
Another audience member said
that there are many incoming fresh
men who want to live in Ujamaa but
do not get to because of space re
strictions. He also said that the pre
mier living space in Ujamaa would
no longer be available to the upper
classmen living in the house.
Although the general sentiment
was one of disapproval, the BSU of
ficers did not say they intend to re
ject the proposal completely but
stated that they wanted the black
community's input to be instrumen
tal both in reforming the proposal
and in carrying out its provisions.
"We need to be at the table right
now for the rest of [the University's]
