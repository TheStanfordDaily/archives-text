While Admit Weekend provides ProFros with an
array of fun activities and experiences, it can be hard
to get a true sense of Stanford life after just a few days.
A number of factors and potential glitches can alter
the way you view the people and life at Stanford. You
and your RoHo could have very different concepts of
"fun." Your head HoHo could have had mono and
have left you and all the other ProFros in the dorm
without any plans. You could have had an allergic re
action to dining hall food and ended up puffy and red
in front of your potential classmates. Or you could just
hate acronyms.
Regardless of the quality of your experience over the
next three days, you are not going to walk away "know
ing" Stanford in its entirety. If the infamous Sarah Ball

had remained on campus fora while, maybe she would
have realized that Stanford isn't as cheerful and enthusi
astic as she so harshly deemed it to be. Then again,
maybe not. (Last spring, Sarah Ball wrote an Op-Ed that
was published in the Washington Post criticizing Stan
ford's Admit Weekend. She is at Duke now.)
To give ProFros a better perspective on campus
life. The Daily talked to ten individuals who are ac
tively involved in the Stanford community and asked
why they chose to come here. Some people came in
wanting to do one thing and ended up doing the oppo
site. Others walked in with specific goals that they pur
sued. And some say they came with no expectations at
all. Despite their different approaches to enrolling at
Stanford, what they have in common now is that they
have all found areas in which they shine.

While Admit Weekend provides ProFros with an
array of fun activities and experiences, it can be hard
to get a true sense of Stanford life after just a few days.
A number of factors and potential glitches can alter
the way you view the people and life at Stanford. You
and your RoHo could have very different concepts of
"fun." Your head HoHo could have had mono and
have left you and all the other ProFros in the dorm
without any plans. You could have had an allergic re
action to dining hall food and ended up puffy and red
in front of your potential classmates. Or you could just
hate acronyms.

astic as she so harshly deemed it to be. Then again,
