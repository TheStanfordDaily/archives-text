# Grad students can ride Caltrain free
## 
### PATRICK FITZGERALD STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council will soon finalize a one
year pilot program that will allow off-campus graduate stu
dents to ride the Caltrain for free.
According to Moriah Thomason, chair of the Graduate
Student Council, the program recently received approval for
funding from University Provost John Etchemendy and
needs a few finishing touches before its implementation pos
sibly by the end of winter quarter.
The GSC has been working to team up with Caltrain for
over three years, former GSC Chair Steve Allison said.
While the details are not finalized, he added that "grad stu
dents have been really excited" about the deal.
Transportation is one of the chief concerns of graduate
students at Stanford, according to Allison. The prospective
program "is our most popular advocacy effort," he said,
adding that riding the Caltrain is "almost prohibitively ex
pensive" for graduate students.
GSC member Marcus Folch agreed. Folch, who lives in
San Francisco and commutes twice a week to the Stanford
campus said he spends about $20 per week on transportation.
Thomason, who estimated the average annual cost of
transportation fora student living off campus to be $900, said
she receives e-mails daily from graduate students asking fora
program to help alleviate the costs of the Caltrain commute.
The pilot program is the first designed to help fund stu
dent use of Caltrain, which previously only negotiated with
businesses for special programs and had not made deals for
students.
"We really wanted to offer students the opportunity that
staff has," Thomason said, referring to Stanford's two-year
old program that provides free rides on the Caltrain for all
faculty and staff members.
With the stamp of approval for funding from Etchemendy
and University Manager Chris Christofferson, the Depart
ment of Parking and Transportation must make changes to
its system before it can begin distributing passes.
Both Caltrain and the University seem to be "playing the
numbers to get the most benefit for the least money out of
Stanford pockets," Thomason said.
Once in effect, graduate students
will only have to go through "a very
simple process" to take part in the
program, according to Allison.
Students will likely have to go
to the Parking and Transportation

Office and obtain a sticker for
their student IDs that will act as
train tickets. The program will
only be open to students who do
not live on land owned or leased
by Stanford.
Graduate students said they
are eager to take advantage of the
opportunities made possible by
free Caltrain rides.
