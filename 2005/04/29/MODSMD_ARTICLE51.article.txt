# Twelve reasons to explore the Bay Area this graduation
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
(1) Before your graduate takes the next
big leap into the real world, why not take an
adventurous leap together — out of a plane.
For the daring parent and graduate, there
are plenty of places around the Bay Area to
go skydiving. You can drive up past the
Golden Gate bridge to Santa Rosa
(www.skydivesantarosa.com) or northeast
to Byron for your unforgettable free-fall ex
perience (www.bayareaskydiving.com).
(2) A trip to San Francisco is not complete
without a visit to the infamous penitentiary,
Alcatraz. Surrounded by icy, shark-infested
waters, Alcatraz has been the subject of
many movies and books. If you're looking
for the ultimate experience, visit at night —
they even lock you up for fun. No better way
to scare a graduating senior into staying
away from crime. Check out
www.nps.gov/alcatraz for more info.
(3) For the history buffs or the hiking fa
natics, take a day trip to Angel Island. The
largest island in San Francisco Bay, Angel Is
land, was used by the Miwok Indians as site

for hunting and fishing for more than 6,000
years. A series of military operations took
place on the island from the Civil War to the
Cold War. Today visitors can hike around
the 13 miles of trails on the island, taking in
the awe-inspiring views of San Francisco and
Marin County. For more information, visit
www.angelisland.org.
(4) Bringing younger kids to graduation?
Inspire nerdiness in the younger siblings.
The Bay Area Discovery Museum combines
fun and learning with interactive displays.
Kids can design their own products in the Art
Lab, explore animal habitats in the Top Spot
• exhibit and even go in an underwater sea
tunnel to learn about the marine ecology of
the bay. The Think Tank exhibit opens May
14 and offers all sorts of mind games and puz
zles for everyone. Learn more at
www.baykidsmuseum.org.
(5) The rolling hills and picturesque pas
tures of Napa Valley make fora memorable
scenic wine-tasting day trip. Stop by
renowned wineries such as Robert Mondavi
and Domaine Chandon, but set aside some
time for charming boutique wineries such as
St. Supery and Merryvale. California coun

try cuisine shines at Thomas Keller's famous
Yountville restaurants Bouchon or The
French Laundry, but more casual venues
such as The Girl and the Fig in Sonoma or
Mustard's Grill in Napa also offer dishes that
perfectly pair with wine. Look at www.na
pavalley.org to start planning your trip.
(6) Enter a living museum of exotic or
chids and rare plants at the San Francisco
Conservatory of Flowers. Located on the
eastern end of Golden Gate park, the con
servatory features a special exhibit on medi
cinal plants from around the globe. Visit
www.conservatoryofflowers.org to find out
more about the different exhibits.
(7) Take off your Stanford regalia and
head to "that other school" across the bay.
While you're touring the campus, stop by
Ludwig's Fountain in Sproul Plaza. The
fountain was named after a pup — Ludwig
— who spent his dog days at the fountain
in the 19605. Many anti-war demonstra
tions and protests of all sorts have been
held at this historical monument. Take a
deep breath and inhale the liberalism.

reach the UC Berkeley Web site by typing

(8) In the spirit fqr a spook? Tour the San
Jose mansion of eccentric heiress Sarah Win
chester, who built a home with a never-end
ing series of rooms to defend herself from the
dead spirits of those who had been killed by
Winchester rifles. The experience is slightly
unnerving, but the house itself is astonishing.
Get hours of operation and directions at
www.winchestermysteryhouse.com.
(9) Get a dose of culture at the San Fran
cisco Museum of Modern Art. Works by
Frank O. Gehry, Frank Lloyd Wright and
Andy Warhol are included in the permanent
collection — and the special exhibits often
feature up and coming artists. Visit www.sf
moma.org before you go.
(10) Fora day at the beach, take the top
off that rented convertible (a must!) and
take the windy Highway 17 down to Santa
Cruz. Try a few rides on the carnival-like
boardwalk and then slather on the sun
screen and plop down the family at the
beach. Just one word of caution: ocean
water in Northern California is not warm,
so rent a wetsuit if you're looking to do

anything more than splashing around in
the waves. The Santa Cruz visitor's bureau
offers a variety of activities on its Web site:
www.santacruz.org.
(11) Ride on the Blue and Gold Ferry
from San Francisco to the sleepy town of
Tiburon. Situated right across the bay from
the city, Tiburon offers spectacular views,
antique shops and historic buildings. Rent a
bike at Demo Sport Tiburon (415-435-5111)
and coast around town — or, if you're feel
ing particularly athletic, try one of the trails
featured at www.marintrails.com. When
you've finished your day's workout, kick
back with a margarita at Guaymas to enjoy
some of the best Mexican food in the Bay
Area.
(12) Head to Gilroy fora shopping
marathon — there are 145 stores in this
massive outlet complex. From J. Crew to
Sony to Nike — you could literally shop all
day and not have time to visit every single
store. When you're done shopping (or
you've maxed out the credit card), check
out garlic-themed stores on Highway 101
and try the garlic ice cream — if you're dar
ing enough.

Conservatory of Flowers. Located on the
eastern end of Golden Gate park, the con
servatory features a special exhibit on medi
cinal plants from around the globe. Visit
www.conservatoryofflowers.org to find out
more about the different exhibits.
(7) Take off your Stanford regalia and
head to "that other school" across the bay.
While you're touring the campus, stop by
Ludwig's Fountain in Sproul Plaza. The
fountain was named after a pup — Ludwig
— who spent his dog days at the fountain
in the 19605. Many anti-war demonstra
tions and protests of all sorts have been
held at this historical monument. Take a
deep breath and inhale the liberalism.
Want to learn more? Amusingly, one can
reach the UC Berkeley Web site by typing

(8) In the spirit fqr a spook? Tour the San
Jose mansion of eccentric heiress Sarah Win
chester, who built a home with a never-end
ing series of rooms to defend herself from the
dead spirits of those who had been killed by
Winchester rifles. The experience is slightly
unnerving, but the house itself is astonishing.

www.winchestermysteryhouse.com.
(9) Get a dose of culture at the San Fran
cisco Museum of Modern Art. Works by
Frank O. Gehry, Frank Lloyd Wright and
Andy Warhol are included in the permanent
collection — and the special exhibits often
feature up and coming artists. Visit www.sf
moma.org before you go.
(10) Fora day at the beach, take the top
off that rented convertible (a must!) and
take the windy Highway 17 down to Santa
Cruz. Try a few rides on the carnival-like
boardwalk and then slather on the sun
screen and plop down the family at the
beach. Just one word of caution: ocean
water in Northern California is not warm,
so rent a wetsuit if you're looking to do

anything more than splashing around in
the waves. The Santa Cruz visitor's bureau
offers a variety of activities on its Web site:
www.santacruz.org.
(11) Ride on the Blue and Gold Ferry
from San Francisco to the sleepy town of
Tiburon. Situated right across the bay from
the city, Tiburon offers spectacular views,
antique shops and historic buildings. Rent a
bike at Demo Sport Tiburon (415-435-5111)
and coast around town — or, if you're feel
ing particularly athletic, try one of the trails
featured at www.marintrails.com. When
you've finished your day's workout, kick
back with a margarita at Guaymas to enjoy
some of the best Mexican food in the Bay
Area.
(12) Head to Gilroy fora shopping
marathon — there are 145 stores in this
massive outlet complex. From J. Crew to
Sony to Nike — you could literally shop all
day and not have time to visit every single
store. When you're done shopping (or
you've maxed out the credit card), check
out garlic-themed stores on Highway 101
and try the garlic ice cream — if you're dar
ing enough.
