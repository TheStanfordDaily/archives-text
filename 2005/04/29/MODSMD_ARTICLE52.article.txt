## Best of NEWS 2005 Coffins, Bat mitzvah mark Tree Week 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
There weren't four weddings, but there were two funerals, a
bat mitzvah and a royal procession at last night's information
meeting for prospective Tree applicants.
The secretive meeting — open only to applicants, former
trees and the recently selected Dollies — kicked off the 10-day
long selection period known as Tree Week. Before a winner is de
clared next Wednesday, the half-dozen applicants must impress
their judges with the most outlandish stunts their imaginations
can concoct.
The meeting last night was the first opportunity for the aspi
rants to prove their worth. With the current Tree, three former
Trees and a smattering of Dollies and band members watching,
the Tree-hopefuls made their way to the band Shak just east of
Burnham Pavilion.
Freshman Adam Monroe was the first to arrive, draped in
cloth and lying on a funeral bier carried by an entourage dressed
in black.
Sophomore Brad Burton followed with a more extravagant
funeral procession. He arrived in a wooden casket carried by his
Kappa Sigma brothers, also dressed in black. When the casket
was set down. Burton emerged and bloodily sacrificed a member
from the procession. After Burton entered the Shak, the others
>»■■■'< r v .... . « , i # /

silently placed the mauled sacrifice into the casket and departed.
"A good exit is important too," said senior Andrew Parker, a
former Tree.
Senior Erin Lashnits, who will be co-terming next year, ar
rived at the center of a bat mitzvah celebration, carried along in a
chair while dozens of supporters wearing pink "Erin for Tree"
shirts encircled her and sang Hava Nagila.
The last entrance stunt was performed by sophomore Christi
na Zempel, who arrived on a wooden sedan carried by four men
in Speedos. After a rhyming proclamation was read, Zempel de
scended from her throne, bedecked with peacock feathers, and
walked over the bodies of several prostrate peons to enter the
Shak.
The current and former Trees remained stoic throughout, of
fering short judgments on the entry processions. Trees are noto
rious for lying to the media, and information about the selection
process is hard to uncover. An inquiry into the rules governing
stunts, for instance, elicited this response from 2001-2(X)2 Tree
and co-term student Chuck Armstrong:
"Everything has to be somehow related to non-linear algebra
or non-Euclidean geometry."
In the coming week, expect "some pretty outrageous things
around campus." said senior Isaac Salier-Hellendag 111. the cur
rent Tree. "I have high expectations."
