### ALIYYA HAQUE DESK EDITOR 
After 24 years on the U.S. mainland.
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Gene
Awakuni will return home in the spring.
Awakuni. who graduated from the Uni
versity of Hawaii's main Manoa campus,
recently accepted the post of chancellor at
the University of Hawaii-West O'ahu
campus. He will begin his three-year term
on March 1, 2005.
During his three-year term at Stanford.
Awakuni spearheaded various efforts to
increase and improve student activities

space. This included overseeing the first
floor renovation of Tresidder Memorial
Union and planning the complete renova
tion of Old Union into a true student
union, a project set to begin construction
in approximately 18 months.
"I've tried to establish a close working
relationship with the students and have
tried to reach out to all student groups,"
Awakuni said in an interview with The
Daily. "When I first arrived at Stanford. I
noticed a bit of tension between students
and the administration, but now I feel that
this has changed quite a lot. I hope that the
administration continues to strengthen its

relationship with the student body, espe
cially in finding ways to provide more re
sources and funds to student groups."
Throughout his time at Stanford,
Awakuni was respected by both students
and fellow administrators. Associate
Dean of Students and Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe has worked closely
with Awakuni on a number of projects.
She praised the work he accomplished in a
reasonably short period of time.
"Vice Provost Awakuni should receive
a lot of credit for the work he has done in
terms of securing more space for
students," she said. "One of his
greatest legacies is the student ac
tivities-space use plan, which is the
first time the University has come
up with a comprehensive plan to
tackle the issue of student space."
Howe also noted Awakuni's
support for ASSU's Absolute Fun
program, designed to encourage al
cohol-free student events and ac
tivities across campus. He also
helped to create the James Lyon in
tern program, designed to give a
student with previous background
and experience in student leader
ship the opportunity to work close
ly with the vice provost.
Senior Joey Natoli, former
ASSU Vice President and current
James Lyons Intern to the Vice
Provost of Student Affairs, has in
teracted with Awakuni for over
two years and developed a close
working relationship with him.
"Vice Provost Awakuni fully
believed in empowering students
and the student voice/! Natoli said.
"Almost as important, he told stu
dents the truth. Throughout my
term in the ASSU, Vice Provost
Awakuni would explain the diffi
culties the University was facing,
and explain ways to more efficient
ly accomplish projects."
Senior Michael Ortiz, who
worked as a student aide in the Of
fice of the Vice Provost for Student
Affairs, also lauded Awakuni's
progress in improving Stanford's
housing, food services and student
activity space.
