## 
### BRENDAN MARTEN INTERMISSION EDITOR 
The University has announced
that, as of this September, Dean of
Admission and Financial Aid Robin
Mamlet will be working a reduced
number of hours while still perform
ing professional duties. She plans to
step down from her position alto
gether by June 1 of next year.
"After considerable thought
during the last few months . . .
I've made the decision to have this
be my last year at Stanford,"
Mamlet said to The Stanford Re
port. "This will mean I'll have
been at Stanford for five years,
and at this time, my desire is to be
more focused on my family, espe
cially my children, during this key
time in their development.
"The provost has graciously agreed
that I may begin to spend more time
with my family right away," she added.
"The quality and commitment of the
current staff in admission, financial aid
and visitor information services makes
this decision easier."
Mamlet presided over several sig
nificant changes in undergraduate
admission policies, including the no
table shift from Stanford's prior bind
ing early decision setup to it's current
non-binding, single-choice early ac
tion system.
"I think that this certainly may en
hance our ability to enroll a diverse
class," Mamlet said regarding the
change in a prior Nov. 7,2002 article.
"It certainly will not hinder it. Early
action gives students on financial aid
more flexibility - they can compare fi
nancial aid packages."

Indeed, Stanford's undergraduate
population witnessed unprecedented
diversity gains within its entering
classes during Mamlet's tenure. As
reported in an April 3,2002 Daily ar
ticle, the University announced that
— for the first time in its history —
more than half of its admitted class
were students from minority groups.
"The composition of students
she's brought about during her term
at Stanford couldn't be a more excit
ing, diverse and talented group of in
dividuals, at least in my opinion," said
Tom Hanada, a rising senior. "The
University has increasingly become a
more and more vibrant place to learn
and grow."
Mamlet has been praised during
her term by students and administra
tors alike. University officials had
nothing but kind words for the outgo
ing dean.
"We are very sorry to lose Robin
and she will be extremely difficult to
replace," said Provost John
Etchemendy to The Stanford Re
port. "Nonetheless, I respect her de
cision and am grateful for the guid
ance she will provide during this tran
sitional year."
According to University Presi
dent John Hennessy, Mamlet has
been a strong asset to the University
during her years of service.
"Robin's tenure has been marked
by succession of stellar freshman
classes and significant improvements
in our financial aid program," Hen
nessy said. "Her dedication to Stan
ford has been unparalleled."
