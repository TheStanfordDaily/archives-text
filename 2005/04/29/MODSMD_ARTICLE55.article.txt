# Parents visit campus
## 
### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
You know Parents' Weekend has arrived
when your roommate finally picks up the
socks that have been hidden underneath the
bed since last quarter or when the Bookstore
is besieged by inquisitive couples with armfuls
of Stanford memorabilia.
At the end of last week, some 3,(XX) parents
— coming from places as close as Redwood
City, Calif, and as far as India and Zimbabwe
— arrived on the Farm fora festive weekend
of tours, conversations with University offi
cials and a glimpse into their sons and daugh
ters' lives at Stanford.
"We're delighted to have some insights
into what happens here at Stanford," said
Claudia and Greg Myall, parents of Nathaniel,
a junior. "We've talked to friends whose chil
dren attend other schools and realized that
there's just nothing like this elsewhere."
Given the short duration of their stays,
moms and dads wasted no time, many arriving
early on Thursday, the day before the Univer
sity rolled out its red carpet and officially
kicked off the weekend-long event.
"I just visited the church and ate lunch at
the Old Union," said Sanne Lee of Los Ange
les, mother of freshman Jessica. "I'm glad that
I've got to see the campus and the extracurric
ular activities that are parts of my daughter's
life here."
Parents like Sanne Lee who are interested
in the University's architecture, had the op
portunity to take guided tours to the libraries,
the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, the
Rosenberg Athletic Hall of Fame and the
tech-equipped Wallenberg Hall.

"We are very impressed," said Rosalyn and
Paul Meyer of Maui, Hawaii, parents of fresh
man William, referring to their tour of the
James H. Clark Center. "The video about the
Bio-X program was just magnificent."
On Saturday, parents packed Memorial
Auditorium to watch the Fleet Street singers,
Stanford Improvisers and Stanford Taiko.
For parents of freshmen, the weekend
included a forum where they could raise
concerns and share tips on how to handle
having their children away from home for
the first time.
"Am I the only parent who thinks that my
child never calls home?" asked one mother
during a panel discussion moderated by Julie
Lythcott-Haims, dean of freshmen and
transfer students.
About one-third of the parents in atten
dance raised their hands in acknowledgment
of the lack of communication.
"See?" said Lythcott-Haims. "You're not
alone."
"Perhaps you should try e-mail," one par
ent said. "I think email works better than the
telephone these days."
"Or instant-messaging," another parent
said. "It's easier for us."
Exchanges like these were not uncommon
during Parents' Weekend, said Lythcott-
Haims, who held similar panels in previous
years.
"Parents are key partners of the University
in their children's education," she said. "Alle
viating parents' concerns is therefore one way
of helping the students."
