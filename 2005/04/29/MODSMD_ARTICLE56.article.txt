# Lamba Nu dubbed Jerry
## House renamed to honor chef, a Grateful Dead fan 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
Next year, students will no longer have to
venture off campus to immerse themselves in
the Dead House scene. Beginning in fall 2(M)5,
Lambda Nu, a residence overlooking Lake
Lagunita, will officially hear the name "Jerry,"
after Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead.
According to senior C.B. Buente, the resi
dent assistant in Lambda Nu, current residents
chose to rename the house in honor of their
beloved and long-time chef Sandy Coulson, an
avid Grateful Dead fan. Coulson is extremely
dedicated to the house's residents, Buente said.
Coulson told The Daily that she has been a
Grateful Dead enthusiast for more than 25
years — about the same amount of time she
has worked as a chef in Lambda Nu. In fact,
the kitchen walls are decorated with an array
of Grateful Dead paraphernalia, a testament
to her passion for the band.
"When Jerry died in 1995," Coulson said,
"I just didn't know how I was going to go on.
But the kids in this house have been amazing
for me. They've helped me through a lot, so
I'm there for them, too."
Coulson said she is thrilled about the deci
sion to rename the house Jerry, and added that
the residents' arduous efforts to push their
idea through the administration make her

"feel very loved."
"It's exciting that the University listened to
students," said senior T.G. Falcon, a resident
of Lamda Nu. "We're all trying to make Stan
ford a better place and it's great that the Uni
versity let us do so."
Jane Camarillo, director of Residential Edu
cation, said that students wishing to change their
residence's name must submit a petition with a
list of three to four suggestions for names,
ranked according to preference. They must also
give a brief explanation for each name, and Res
idential Education will have the final say.
"We suggested Jerry, The Grateful Dorm,
Good Lovin' and Brokedown Palace," Falcon
said. The latter two preferences are the names
of famous Dead tunes.
Camarillo added that students must also
submit "a proposal that should invite the in
volvement of the whole house, ensuring that
everyone currently living there has a say in
shaping the proposal."
The staff at Lambda Nu had to obtain a
large enough percentage of signatures from
the residents to convince the administrators to
accept the proposal, Buente said.
"Out of 60 residents, 57 signed the peti
tion," Falcon informed The Daily. "Our poli
cy vvfls to refrain from asking people more
than once, so that it was based on their first re
action. The fact that we got 57 signatures right
away shows that most people in the house are
pretty happy about the decision."
