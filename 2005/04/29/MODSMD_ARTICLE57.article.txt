# General Electric exec gives business tips
## 
### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
"Winning is the only thing that
counts," said former Chief Execu
tive Officer and Chairman of Gen
eral Electric Jack Welch last night.
Then he paused, and fora moment,
a packed Memorial Auditorium sat
silent, enthralled by arguably the
most celebrated American business
legend of all time.
Only moments before, Welch
had the entire auditorium booming
with laughter and applause as he re
ferred to certain Microsoft employ
ees as a "pot of duds."
Both serious and lively, Welch
was characteristically direct and
passionate, analyzing contempo
rary business issues, answering
questions, discussing his new
book, "Winning." and sharing the
management strategies that
turned GE from an uncoordinat
ed mammoth into an agile indus
try leader.
Welch discussed the importance
and effectiveness of "people build
ing" by placing emphasis on human
resources, using a system for iden
tifying and rewarding exemplary
performers and leading by exam
ple.
"The day you become a leader,
managing five,lo,ls people, your
future becomes tied to them,"
Welch said, touching on the very
core of his management doctrine -
the quality of the members deter
mines the quality of the team.
"What so many businesses don't
recognize is that the chief human
resources officer is at least equal if
not more important than the chief

financial officer,"he said. "If
you're coaching a baseball or foot
ball team, would you want a bunch
of accountants hanging around or
people who know how to talk to
your players?"

To stimulate performance, man
agers should assess their employ
ees' work and constantly keep in
touch with the employees to en
courage • improvement, Welch
added.

"You got grades back in school,
so why not now?" he asked. "Not
having differentiation is the cru
dest thing in a company. People
need to know where they stand."
Welch explained his three
tiered 20-70-10 system. "Stars,"
the top 20 percent performers, are
rewarded with hefty financial
bonuses and recognition, while
"Lemons", the bottom 10 percent,
are replaced. The middle 70 per
cent, he said, need to be told what
to do to get into the top 20 percent.
"Mission and values — define
them clearly," Welch said. "Set the
tone of your company and then ex
hibit the behavior. You can't be
afraid to put it out there."
Welch demonstrated that the
scope of his business doctrine ex
tends from the boardroom to the
cubicle. He also offered the audi
ence of mostly Stanford business
students a few points of advice for
entry-level workers.
"There are five clear-cut things
in looking fora job," Welch said.
"First, find people like you —
who'll laugh at your jokes, people
with the same sensibilities. If
you're a nerd, go hang out with
nerds."
Second, go where there are
smarter people, Welsh said,
"where you can learn and grow."
Welch also encouraged seeking
jobs at brand-name companies and
establishing a presence at the work
place. The final reason for settling
on a job should be a passion for the
work itself.
