## Wise choice of Commencement speaker 
### 
As a leading innovator and entrepreneur, Steve
Jobs is an especially appropriate choice fora Com
mencement speaker at a school that prides itself on
being forward-looking and creative.
As chief executive officer of Apple and co-founder
of Pixar, Jobs provides an example of success in the
resurgent technology sector that many graduating se
niors likely hope to emulate.
Jobs is credited with turning around Apple during
the mid-90s and with starting the personal computer
industry in the early KOs.
Although Jobs dropped out of Reed College to
work for Atari, his story is still relevant to Stanford
graduates. In fact, the unconventional aspects of his
experience provide a new view of entrepreneurship.
Jobs started Apple in his backyard garage. In addi
tion, he is known for his offbeat comments and
speeches.

Jobs embodies the drive that many Stanford stu
dents will need in order to be successful. After losing
control of Apple and being forced out of his position,
Jobs did not give up. He continued with the launch of
Pixar, which has been responsible for hit movies like
"Finding Nemo," "The Incredibles" and "Toy Story,"
and years later Apple asked Jobs to return to his post
as chief executive officer.
Although Jobs is not a Stanford alumnus, he is a
charismatic speaker with a distinctive approach to
business. For example, Jobs takes a $1 salary at Apple
because of the confidence he has in the value of his
stock options and the promise of his products. Be
cause of his contributions to technology and his inno
vative style of leadership, the Class of 2005 should be
well served by his speech this June.
