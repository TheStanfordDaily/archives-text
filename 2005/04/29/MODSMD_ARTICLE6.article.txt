# Barn to provide creature comforts
## 
### RONALD CHAN STAFF WRITER 
Tucked discreetly in the southwest
ern corner of campus alongside the golf
course, the Red Barn — an enduring
witness to Stanford's century-long pro
gression from a no-man's land to a lead

ing academic and technological huh —
stands as a vivid reminder of why the
University continues to be nicknamed
"the Farm" today.
But the historic building, like just
about every other part of campus, has
not shied away from touches of moder
nity. A $4 million renovation — the

third restoration since the barn's con
struction in 1880 — is set to transform it
into a premier equestrian facility com
plex accessible to the entire Stanford
community.
Listed since 1985 in the National
Register of Historic Places, the
Victorian-style Red Barn is one
of the few surviving structures on
campus that predate the Univer
sity's incorporation. According
to a published history of Stan
ford, Leland and Jane Stanford
originally used their land in
Santa Clara Valley to set up the
revolutionary Palo Alto Stock
Farm, where they experimented
with the scientific breeding of
first-rate horses. Before they
founded the University in 1891,
the Stanfords boarded some 550
horses, from champion trotters
to thoroughbred racers.
The founding couple is long
gone, of course, but their horse
manship remains. For the past 20
years, the 13-acre Equestrian
Center — which includes the Red
Barn, two other stables and a cov
ered riding ring — had been
leased to a local concessionaire as
a public boarding stable. When
the lease expired in August of last
year, the University resumed the
management of the center with
the intention of upgrading and
more fully integrating the facility
into academic life.
"Stanford has some of the best
athletic facilities in the world, so
it was time for the barn to step
forward and receive some much
needed care," said Vanessa
Bartsch, Class of 1999, who has
served as the barn's general man
ager since last year.
Changes are now being made
to improve the facility and keep
the horses that reside there as
healthy and strong as possible.
Newly-installed windows will
allow horses to get adequate ven
tilation while automatic troughs
mounted in each stall will provide
them with access to clean water
around the clock. The riding rings
are being refurbished so that
horses will not trip or injure
themselves on uneven footing.
Even the mats in the stalls, made
of a blend of foam core and rub
ber, have been specially engi
neered to maintain the health of
the horses' joints.
In addition, recent landscaping
projects have allowed a new arena
for trotting practice and show
jumping. The neighboring Stal
lion Barn is also being converted
into a student and boarder club
house, complete with improved
meeting space, locker rooms and
staff offices.
And, don't forget, no infra
structure development on campus
can make the grade without a gen
erous planting of palm trees.

All of these renovations have
been accomplished without com
promising the architectural in
tegrity of the Red Barn itself, ac
cording to Business Prof. George
Parker, a longtime horse-enthusi
ast and head of the advisory coun
cil on the Equestrian Center.

"[The Red Barn) is truly a
landmark on campus and an im
portant part of Stanford's histo
ry," Parker said. "Now the De
partment of Athletics is operating
the barn and will keep it at the
high standard of the other athlet
ic facilities on campus."

In Bartsch's mind, however,
the most significant improvement
goes far beyond the overhaul of
facilities.
"When I came to Stanford, 1
was told that if I wanted to bring
my horse, it would take me three
years on the waiting list and the

stall would cost three times as
much as it did back home," ex
plained Bartsch. an avid rider
since the age of four. "Instead, I
sold my horse and rode on the
equestrian team. But the team
was pretty much a second-class
citizen at its own barn. My prac

tice time had to go until 10 p.m.
some nights because we couldn't
get ring time."
But with the renovated Red
Barn and other facilities on the
site, the Equestrian Center will be
able to devote its attention to the
needs of students. Under the aus
pices of the Department of Ath
letics, Stanford will own some 20
horses specifically for use by the
intercollegiate Stanford Equestri
an Team, or SET, horseback-rid
ing lessons and summer camps.
The University will continue to
serve private boarders as it
strengthens the barn's equestrian
service for students, faculty and
staff. There are already 18 stu
dents on the waiting list to board
their horses at the new facilities.
The renovation — scheduled
for completion early in the sum
mer — is likely to most benefit
those who participate in horse
manship competitions. Gone are
the days when Stanford's national
champions and Olympic quali
fiers refused to ride because of
the poor upkeep of the barn.
"With a state-of-the-art eques
trian facility on campus, Stanford
joins the ranks of a handful of
other colleges and universities in
the country that can compete in
equestrian sports at the highest
level," Parker said.
Not surprisingly, members of
SET are thrilled at the prospect of
moving in to their new home.
"It is wonderful to see the Uni
versity putting resources into
making this one of the top eques
trian facilities in the country,"
said junior Alex Herbert, presi
dent of SET. "The new barn will
allow the team to practice at times
more suitable for student sched
ules. Instead of riding at 6 p.m. to
avoid crowds in the arena, we will
get to ride in the afternoon."
Herbert added that the
changes will also allow the horses
to spend more time outside of
their stalls, which will keep them
happier and healthier.
The Red Barn currently wel
comes students, faculty and other
visitors who are interested in
touring the facility. The Universi
ty has also pledged to maintain
the barn's traditions, such .as the
yearly Red Barn Festival, a day
long event for local families that
includes exhibition riding, pony
rides, a petting zoo and a barbe
cue,
"(The Festival] has always
been a great events" Bartsch said,
"But it was held by the former
management in the summer, a
time when students are not on
campus. So we have decided to
carry on the tradition, but in the
fall when we can incorporate the
whole Stanford community."

able to devote its attention to the
needs of students. Under the aus
pices of the Department of Ath
letics, Stanford will own some 20
horses specifically for use by the
intercollegiate Stanford Equestri
an Team, or SET, horseback-rid
ing lessons and summer camps.
The University will continue to
serve private boarders as it
strengthens the barn's equestrian
service for students, faculty and
staff. There are already 18 stu
dents on the waiting list to board
their horses at the new facilities.
The renovation — scheduled
for completion early in the sum
mer — is likely to most benefit
those who participate in horse
manship competitions. Gone are
the days when Stanford's national
champions and Olympic quali
fiers refused to ride because of
the poor upkeep of the barn.
"With a state-of-the-art eques
trian facility on campus, Stanford
joins the ranks of a handful of
other colleges and universities in
the country that can compete in
equestrian sports at the highest
level," Parker said.
Not surprisingly, members of
SET are thrilled at the prospect of
moving in to their new home.
"It is wonderful to see the Uni
versity putting resources into
making this one of the top eques
trian facilities in the country,"
said junior Alex Herbert, presi
dent of SET. "The new barn will
allow the team to practice at times
more suitable for student sched
ules. Instead of riding at 6 p.m. to
avoid crowds in the arena, we will
get to ride in the afternoon."
Herbert added that the
changes will also allow the horses
to spend more time outside of
their stalls, which will keep them
happier and healthier.
The Red Barn currently wel
comes students, faculty and other
visitors who are interested in
touring the facility. The Universi
ty has also pledged to maintain
the barn's traditions, such .as the
yearly Red Barn Festival, a day
long event for local families that
includes exhibition riding, pony
rides, a petting zoo and a barbe
cue,
"(The Festival] has always
been a great events" Bartsch said,
"But it was held by the former
management in the summer, a
time when students are not on
campus. So we have decided to
carry on the tradition, but in the
fall when we can incorporate the
whole Stanford community."

Tucked discreetly in the southwest
ern corner of campus alongside the golf
course, the Red Barn — an enduring
witness to Stanford's century-long pro
gression from a no-man's land to a lead

ing academic and technological huh —
stands as a vivid reminder of why the
University continues to be nicknamed
"the Farm" today.
But the historic building, like just
about every other part of campus, has
not shied away from touches of moder
nity. A $4 million renovation — the

third restoration since the barn's con
struction in 1880 — is set to transform it
into a premier equestrian facility com
plex accessible to the entire Stanford
community.
Listed since 1985 in the National
Register of Historic Places, the
Victorian-style Red Barn is one
of the few surviving structures on
campus that predate the Univer
sity's incorporation. According
to a published history of Stan
ford, Leland and Jane Stanford
originally used their land in
Santa Clara Valley to set up the
revolutionary Palo Alto Stock
Farm, where they experimented
with the scientific breeding of
first-rate horses. Before they
founded the University in 1891,
the Stanfords boarded some 550
horses, from champion trotters
to thoroughbred racers.
The founding couple is long
gone, of course, but their horse
manship remains. For the past 20
years, the 13-acre Equestrian
Center — which includes the Red
Barn, two other stables and a cov
ered riding ring — had been
leased to a local concessionaire as
a public boarding stable. When
the lease expired in August of last
year, the University resumed the
management of the center with
the intention of upgrading and
more fully integrating the facility
into academic life.
"Stanford has some of the best
athletic facilities in the world, so
it was time for the barn to step
forward and receive some much
needed care," said Vanessa
Bartsch, Class of 1999, who has
served as the barn's general man
ager since last year.
Changes are now being made
to improve the facility and keep
the horses that reside there as
healthy and strong as possible.
Newly-installed windows will
allow horses to get adequate ven
tilation while automatic troughs
mounted in each stall will provide
them with access to clean water
around the clock. The riding rings
are being refurbished so that
horses will not trip or injure
themselves on uneven footing.
Even the mats in the stalls, made
of a blend of foam core and rub
ber, have been specially engi
neered to maintain the health of
the horses' joints.
In addition, recent landscaping
projects have allowed a new arena
for trotting practice and show
jumping. The neighboring Stal
lion Barn is also being converted
into a student and boarder club
house, complete with improved
meeting space, locker rooms and
staff offices.
And, don't forget, no infra
structure development on campus
can make the grade without a gen
erous planting of palm trees.

All of these renovations have
been accomplished without com
promising the architectural in
tegrity of the Red Barn itself, ac
cording to Business Prof. George
Parker, a longtime horse-enthusi
ast and head of the advisory coun
cil on the Equestrian Center.

"[The Red Barn) is truly a
landmark on campus and an im
portant part of Stanford's histo
ry," Parker said. "Now the De
partment of Athletics is operating
the barn and will keep it at the
high standard of the other athlet
ic facilities on campus."

In Bartsch's mind, however,
the most significant improvement
goes far beyond the overhaul of
facilities.
"When I came to Stanford, 1
was told that if I wanted to bring
my horse, it would take me three
years on the waiting list and the

stall would cost three times as
much as it did back home," ex
plained Bartsch. an avid rider
since the age of four. "Instead, I
sold my horse and rode on the
equestrian team. But the team
was pretty much a second-class
citizen at its own barn. My prac

tice time had to go until 10 p.m.
some nights because we couldn't
get ring time."
But with the renovated Red
Barn and other facilities on the
site, the Equestrian Center will be
able to devote its attention to the
needs of students. Under the aus
pices of the Department of Ath
letics, Stanford will own some 20
horses specifically for use by the
intercollegiate Stanford Equestri
an Team, or SET, horseback-rid
