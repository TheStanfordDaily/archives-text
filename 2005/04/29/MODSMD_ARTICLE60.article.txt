## OSP must embrace change 
### 
If truth is the daughter of time, as an
old proverb had it, so is debate the par
ent of change. This lesson has recently
come home to me with the public and
private exchange over my critiques of
the Overseas Studies Program, or OSP
(most recently, "The sun never sets on
Stanford," Feb. 18). But the fine points
of "debate" aside, a good deal of ink
will have been spilled in vain unless
change actually occurs at the OSP
The dissenters to my arguments
have laid responsibility for cultural im-

mersion mainly at the feet of students, who should, the
thinking goes, break the fetters of the "Stanford-in" cen
ters themselves. But useful as this advice is, so too does it
neglect a truism: behavioral change rarely occurs without
the propelling force of structural change.
And so I offer a few suggestions, hardly comprehensive,
perhaps already considered, probably imperfect:
First, English-taught classes should be phased out as
much as possible, if not eliminated. Some will argue that
such a change would limit foreign travel to those with pre
vious language skills. In Beijing, Berlin, Florence and
Paris, classes are already taught in a mix of English and the
native language; these programs assume some level of stu
dent proficiency. The extension of native-language classes
to the entire curriculum would certainly challenge students
— but that is an argument for, not against, such a change.
A restoration of native-language classes must not pre
vent the linguistically unprepared from studying abroad.
But with some imagination there must be a way to better
prepare students, rather than neutering the class slate once
abroad.
Second, OSP should end its overindulgent exercise of
allowing students to request that they live near friends also
going abroad. These lucky pairs, separated by an apart

ment floor or city block, often end up living all but togeth
er. What might form a safety net for travel neophytes has
thus devolved into a way for partners and best friends to
more easily commingle. There must be another way to
soften the landing for apprehensive travelers; as to the
friends and lovers category, well, they'll have to take the
bus. It is for their, and our, own good.
Third, OSP should require all students to complete an
internship during each quarter spent abroad. Here, OSP
could reference its own Krupp Internship Program at the
Berlin center.
The pursuit and arrangement of internships may ini
tially prove difficult. Class time will be lost and remunera
tion will be scarce or unavailable. But there are few better
stepping-stones on the path to worthwhile education than
an internship — an argument made by OSP itself, about its
Krupp program. The obstacles will fade, and the rewards
will be vast.
Arguments may be marshaled to counter any of the
above suggestions. But, as the brokers of the University so
often remind as, there are few barriers that a mental and fi
nancial effort cannot overcome.
Change is imperative because, while I have never un
covered a study-abroad program with a Web site and pub
licity as sophisticated as that of OSP, I have met dozens of
non-Stanford students whose study-abroad programs
seemed, by their accounts, less polished but far more im
mersive.
Change is imperative because, though students are
hardly organizing fora study-abroad revolution, we will
broaden our own horizons and seek a more distinctive ex
perience if OSP forces — yes, forces — us to.
Change is imperative because, as no commencement
speaker fails to remind us, the world's leaders are being
trained at Stanford — and if the training fails the test of
