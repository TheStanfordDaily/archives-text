# Let it be
## No more majors 
### 
Ever notice that some people have
an easy time choosing a major, but
others agonize about the choice for
years? I've been talking with several
friends in the second category.
Whether they want to do something
that doesn't require them to special
ize or whether they can't decide what
to specialize in, they don't want to
pick a major.
And 1 say they shouldn't have to.

The only students who should have to choose majors are
those who have an easy time doing so anyway: the students
who know that what they want to do after college requires
academic specialization.
Pre-med students can major in biology. Future math
professors can major in math. But why should the rest of us
have to specialize as undergrads?
A bachelor's degree used to be the last degree many
people earned, and employers looked for students who
had majored in a subject relevant to the job. But now, with
postgraduate degrees required for more and more jobs, it
doesn't make sense to specialize as an undergrad since it's
the subject you study in your final degree that counts. With
interdisciplinary work becoming more popular, you don't
really need a bachelor's degree in the subject you study in
grad school. I have friends in the biology grad school who
studied math and physics as undergrads, and my biology
faculty advisor has a Ph.D. in physics.
The people who make decisions about academic re

quirements (i.e. the faculty and administrators) usually
hold terminal degrees, which means they have specialized
in a specific field. In my experience, faculty tend to want
students to follow in their path. No wonder they want un
dergraduates to narrow their focus.
What would be better than having majors?
There is the individually-designed major option. How
ever, an IDM still requires that you plan your courses
ahead of time, fulfill the core requirements of one of your
three mentors' departments and show that your plan can't
be achieved by any combination of the scores of majors
and minors available at Stanford. As a first step, I'd say
Stanford should make IDMs easier to apply for (i.e. allow
students to apply at any time of year, instead of just once a
year) and give students more freedom in how they design
an IDM.
What if students didn't have to choose majors and just
needed a certain number of upper division courses to grad
uate? If this were the case, every course you took would be
like an elective — a class you enrolled in by choice, not be
cause your major required it. And you could choose a ca
reer without feeling pushed into your department's associ
ated career paths. But most importantly, you could focus
on getting an education instead of fulfilling degree re
quirements.
I wonder what sophomores would talk about then.
