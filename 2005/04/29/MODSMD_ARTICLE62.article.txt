# Holt's harangue
## C is for crazy people 
### 
Remember Cookie Monster? He
ate a lot of cookies. That's why he's
called Cookie Monster: he eats cookies
in monstrous, hilariously exaggerated
amounts. As a child, you laughed at his
antics. It was cute, it was pure.
Now Cookie Monster is qualifying
his eating. According to the makers of
Sesame Street, the new season will fea
ture a more "health conscious" theme.
Now Cookie Monster is being lectured

by a pompous owl who reminds me of those health nuts 1
routinely like to eat bacon cheeseburgers in front of.
Telling Cookie Monster not to eat cookies is like medi
cating Big Bird for his continual hallucinations about his
imaginary friend "Snufflupugus."
I can just imagine the scene. Grover tells Cookie Mon
ster: "This is an intervention. We're worried about you."
Cookie Monster, crumbs still falling from his furry
mouth, replies: "Me can quit anytime me want."
The Count replies: "Three! Ah ha ha! Ybu've tried to
quit three times!"
Then, Cookie Monster, after years of therapy and condi
tioning, finally gets that monkey off his back. He begins to
chain smoke and only eats granola bars. He thinks the hol
lowness they leave in his Muppet body can only be outdone
by the hollowness of his soul.
Now, don't get me wrong. I'm all for teaching kids about
good eating habits. Obesity is a problem in this country, but
then again so is anorexia. Personally, I've always thought

Elmo had an eating disorder because you never really see
him eat and his arms are as thin as an MJ trial defense.
1 just think to a certain degree it gets a bit ridiculous. It's
silly to take away Cookie Monster's cookies, therefore cor
rupting a Sesame Street tradition thirty some odd years old.
Somehow, "The Tofu Monster" doesn't have the same ring
to it.
If you're going to be politically correct on Sesame Street,
there are better places to start. The Count would probably
have to be staked because having a vampire on the show that
sucks the blood of misbehaving children probably isn't the
best image for the wee ones. And gosh darn it, why hasn't
Bert or Ernie found that special someone? And Oscar the
Grouch — why not make him friendly, clean and move him
into an upper end apartment?
But no. The folks at PBS want to corrupt one of the most
pure images I have from my childhood. According to the
Sesame Street folks. Cookie Monster's going to be eating
healthier cookies and eating "the occasional object." What
the heck does that mean? So they're going to be feeding him
Lego blocks? Rocks? Laxatives? I thought they were
putting him on a diet because he had bad eating habits. Now
they're feeding him things that aren't food? It looks like
public television has finally crossed a line. Forced dieting is
one thing, but force feeding things that just aren't food is
sick. Where is Social Services when you need them? Cook
ie Monster is obviously not in a healthy environment.
Speaking of which. Sesame Street features singing
vegetables. Forgive me here, but what kind of message


Chris Holt
are we sending to our children that
it's not OK to eat inanimate cookies
but we should encourage them to eat
singing, smiling, cute vegetables?
Wouldn't that confuse the hell out of
the kids who are told to eat singing
vegetables but not singing trees or
rocks? "But Mommy, I don't want to
eat the singing tomato. Its screams
burn the fibers of my being." Little
Billy then tries to eat the vacuum, be
cause it's the only thing on Sesame
Street that isn't smiling and singing.
With the exception of little Billy,
though, I think kids are smart. If you
want to make a show about eating
healthy, you do it with characters the

kids look up to and respect. Cookie
Monster has never been much of a role
model. He hasn't seen his kids in years,
blowing child support on Oreos and
EL Fudge. Sure, Cookie Monster
probably hasn't been getting nutrition
for the last thirty years, but wouldn't
you like to age as well as he does? If
PBS wants to do a health show, which
1 encourage, then get the Count to
count calories and put Big Bird on the
Atkins diet or something. Don't touch
the C-monster though, or else I'm
coming for you.
C is for Cookie and that is good
enough for me. Cookie Monster, I feel
for you dude. You keep eating your
cookies and I'll keep making adult
jokes about a kid show.
