## An ugly display of character

I'm pretty sure my popularity will
plummet for writing this column - and
analyzing the sociological underpin
nings of Stanford based on Theface
book.com is somewhat problematic â€”
but here goes:
It seems that every Ivy League
school has a reputation: Brown is the
hippy Ivy, Yale is the gay Ivy, Princeton
is the serious Ivy. Stanford seemed to
be gunning to be the athletic Ivy, but de
spite winning 10 consecutive Director's

Cups, "superficial Ivy" may be a better label.
There are a remarkable number of Thefacebook.com
groups devoted to how hot people are. These ultra-exclu
sive, self-congratulatory groups fill the apparently un
tapped role of ensuring that everyone else knows just how
thin, tall and gorgeous certain people are.

It's funny to me that the people who are supposedly so
good looking can't just count their blessings for having
good complexion and chiseled abs and then make their way
to class, no doubt drawing attention from all passersby and
causing numerous bicycle accidents at the Intersection of
Death near the Quad.
Instead, they must confirm the bitter assumptions of the
rest of us that, in fact, there is a very positive correlation be
tween looks and superficiality.
If I have my lineage of Thefacebook.com groups cor
rect, first came "Pretty People." Perhaps just randomly,
nearly all of them were white girls. So then "Association of
Weightroom Hardasses" emerged from the primeval ooze
of superficiality, so that white males could be self-congrat
ulatory about how hot they are. Not to be left behind, we
got "Brown People Are Pretty Too," "Arab Girls are
Sexy," "Hot Jewish Ladies" and "Hapas Are Hot."
