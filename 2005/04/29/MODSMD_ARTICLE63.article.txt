# A 						break from the bubble
## An ugly display of character 
### 
I'm pretty sure my popularity will
plummet for writing this column - and
analyzing the sociological underpin
nings of Stanford based on Theface
book.com is somewhat problematic —
but here goes:
It seems that every Ivy League
school has a reputation: Brown is the
hippy Ivy, Yale is the gay Ivy, Princeton
is the serious Ivy. Stanford seemed to
be gunning to be the athletic Ivy, but de
spite winning 10 consecutive Director's

Cups, "superficial Ivy" may be a better label.
There are a remarkable number of Thefacebook.com
groups devoted to how hot people are. These ultra-exclu
sive, self-congratulatory groups fill the apparently un
tapped role of ensuring that everyone else knows just how
thin, tall and gorgeous certain people are.

It's funny to me that the people who are supposedly so
good looking can't just count their blessings for having
good complexion and chiseled abs and then make their way
to class, no doubt drawing attention from all passersby and
causing numerous bicycle accidents at the Intersection of
Death near the Quad.
Instead, they must confirm the bitter assumptions of the
rest of us that, in fact, there is a very positive correlation be
tween looks and superficiality.
If I have my lineage of Thefacebook.com groups cor
rect, first came "Pretty People." Perhaps just randomly,
nearly all of them were white girls. So then "Association of
Weightroom Hardasses" emerged from the primeval ooze
of superficiality, so that white males could be self-congrat
ulatory about how hot they are. Not to be left behind, we
got "Brown People Are Pretty Too," "Arab Girls are
Sexy," "Hot Jewish Ladies" and "Hapas Are Hot."

Then, mutating like a virulent
strain of disease, new groups followed:
"Don't Hate Me Because I'm Beauti
ful," "Sexiest Stanford Guys," "Stan
ford's Finest," "The In Crowd," "Per
fect 10" and "Hottest Stanford Girls
(and Yes, there actually are Some)."
climaxing (I hope) with the subtly ti
tled "The-hottest-men-on-the-planet
and-you-can-only-be-allowed-in-this-
group-by-invite."
It's sickeningly ironic that at a
school where many students struggle
with eating disorders, we have a group
called "Did You Just Call Me Fat?" It
essentially mocks overweight people
with such jabs as, "We make airplane
trips intimate by pulling up the arm
rest dividers," and "We prefer to be
called 'husky' or 'big boned.'" Fitting
ly, the group's members are mostly
thin blonde girls.
I won't go so far as to say I've never
made a fat joke, but that is pretty low.
Not only must we make self-congratu

latory groups flaunting our good
looks, but now we have to make
groups to mock the overweight? If
Stanford students are supposed to he
the enlightened and well-educated fu
ture leaders of our society, I'm begin
ning to fear for that society.
It's not enough that every adver
tisement, magazine cover and televi
sion show is conforming to a narrow
standard of beauty. Now we, as highly
privileged and educated individuals,
must rub salt in the wound and mock
those who don't conform while simul
taneously creating cliquish barriers
between those who do and everyone
else.
I understand that many Theface
book.com groups are created out of a
silly attempt to blow off steam and
mean no ill will toward anyone. But I
do think it's telling that even some of
the best-educated succumb just as eas
ily to the temptations of superficiality
and image.
