# Tales of a 19th-grade nothing
## The
						games these kids play 
### 
Stanford is an academic beacon
whose influence can he seen and felt
for miles and miles. There are actual
ly seminars held at California high
schools on how to get your son or
daughter into Stanford. I've often
heard the words "best and brightest"
thrown around casually (even in re
gard to my own trade school alma
mater), but one really might expect
that this is the place where those indi-

viduals might truly be found. Think it's a place where
you'd never expect silly games to be played, right?
Wrong.
Stanford kids may not play the same sort of games
that other college kids do, but theirs are just as ridicu
lous. Here are some that I've seen:
I'm a bigger slacker than you are! — This is, by far,
Stanford's favorite game. In a school full of band kids,
valedictorians and other such type-A, overachiever
geeks, the claim is laughable if not just plain sad. I can
not count the number of times I've overheard students
bragging about how hard they're not working, that they
just started studying last night or how close they are to
failing right out of school. Of course, you almost always
see those same students studying in the library, sneaking
off to read ahead for class, finishing their paper a week
early or sending off an application fora White House in
ternship. All the while avoiding seeing anyone they
know and answering any queries over their whereabouts

with an IM away message which reads, "Out partying!!!
Don't call before noon, LOL." Seriously, this campus is
more closeted than Ricky Martin, — the only difference
being that everyone here is ashamed of being smart and
working hard. Listen: IT S STANFORD! AND EV
ERYONE HERE IS HARD-WORKING AND
SMART! OKAY?!?!
I can wear flip-flops in cold weather when you can't!
— This is always a fun one to watch. Now I know this is
California, but according to my limited geographical
skills, this is northern California, and it is not sunny all
the time. There is an identifiable winter, and when the
temperature is below 50 degrees, footwear that involves
socks is a pretty solid idea. But stroll around campus on
a brisk January morning and you're likely to see more
than a few students smiling their way through the early
stages of frostbite on their toes. Honestly folks, despite
the proliferation of Abercrombie, Rainbow and Hollis
ter, few, if any, of us are actually surfers and the ability to
get sand easily out of our footwear isn't that big of a deal
— especially when balanced against our health. Tell you
what, I'll just assume that you're tough, or that you have
a fantastic pedicure and you can go ahead and put your
dang shoes on. deal?
