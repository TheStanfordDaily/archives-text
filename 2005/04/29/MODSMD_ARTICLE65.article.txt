## Drink, damn it 
### 
The only thing
worse than sitting
alone in the dark,
sipping hard
liquor while con
templating the
fleeting misery
that passes for ex
istence in these
parts, is doing the
same with water.

I mention this because I'm about
to launch into a tirade, and it would
dishonest of me to do so without ac
knowledging the blinding hypocrisy
of lecturing on the merits of drinking
while living a (temporarily) teetotal
life.
Now, the more intelligent of you
will have deduced two things from
the preceding paragraphs: I don't
drink, and I think you should drink
more. The object of today's lesson is
the latter.
While I do not imbibe at the mo
ment, I have done so in the past and
will do so in the future, so I feel my
thoughts on the matter have at least a
little value.
First things first: Before you decide to
blame your next hangover on my
sage advice, I should make it very
clear that I don't care.
Having gotten that out of the way,
let me make an observation. The Stan
ford campus is a very quiet place. Were
you to wander around late at night,
you would mostly be greeted with si
lence. This is concerning - universities
should, after all, be hot beds of drunk
en revelry (or something like that).
When I was a young man (now
that's a tragic way to start a sen
tence), struggling toward my 8.A., it
was rare that I made it home without
stumbling across drunken people
singing and pools of congealing
vomit. Ah, how I miss those days.
I must confess that my late night
wanderings are generally con
strained to graduate habitats —it
may well be that in the younger, seed
ier parts of campus there are all kinds
of gallivanting and cavorting going
on. But I doubt it.

The connection between deathly
quiet and sobriety should be obvious
to anyone who hasn't been brain
washed by the cult of Absolute Fun.
However, it would be remiss of
me not to offer for consumption the
meaty idea - that is to say that vege
tarians and other soulless vampires
(synthetic blood only of course) may
find this unpalatable — that a life
without occasional excess is barely a
life at all and is certainly not one
brimming with activity.
The thought of a life full of vim
and vigor brings me neatly (well
maybe not so much) onto my next
point: Americans are crazy.
While this could be expanded into
an entire book, let me instead dwell
on one little thing. You can buy a
shotgun, drive a car, be drafted into
the army and be executed — all at
the tender age of 18. And yet, you
can't have a drink.
Even more concerning than the
sheer absurdity of the law is the fact
that no one appears to complain. I
mean, you grumble occasionally
about various regulations and rules
the University may impose. But no
one stands up to say: "The law is
wrong."
There are campaigns on campus
for every political cause you could
possibly imagine (and several you
probably couldn't), why not one to
legalize the fun and frolics of youth?
Of course, the downside of youth
ful drinking is that one would lose the
ability to hide from the hoards of chil
dren by visiting a bar. The upside,
though-of having bars filled with exu
berant youth-probably makes up for
it.
On that thought, I will end and
propose a toast: "To drinks, drunks
and youth. May you all live in harmo
ny."

you 're an under-aged, hard-drinking,
blood-sucking vegetarian who wants
to start a campaign for teenage alco
holism. Thus- column first appeared on
