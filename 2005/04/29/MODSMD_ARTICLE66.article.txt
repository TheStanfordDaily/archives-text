## Decisions and decision makers

Is there such a thing as po
litical objectivity? By defini
tion, the answer seems to be
no. Politicians tend to line up
the facts to back-up their argu
ments, almost to the point
where it is impossible to distin
guish which came first, the
facts or the point of view. Does
this make the politician and
the policy one and the same?

It shouldn't, but it often does, especially when
it comes to Democrats and President George W.
Bush. Although many detest the man for the di
rection he's taken the country, critics still ought to
judge his actions from behind some sort of objec
tive veil of ignorance. Consider the Bush adminis
tration and the Middle East.
There is no denying that in his first four years,
Bush initiated a long-term process to reform the
Middle East. He did not attack Iraq because of its
oil or over some personal vendetta against Sad
dam Hussein, but because he is a true believer in
his crusade to spread freedom — well, at least his
economic version of it — around the world.
So we invade Iraq.
Short term: horrible idea. The execution of the
plan, if there ever was one, left much to be desired;

we probably invaded the wrong country (how
many of the Sept. 11 hijacker's were Iraqi?) and
worst of all, he lied to us in order to scare us into
giving him our tacit consent.
Long term: still unclear. The question is whether
the ends justify the means. Democracy is taking
hold in Iraq better than anybody foresaw, but
there is still much work to be done.
The insurgency rages on, but notably less so
since the January elections. The Bush administra
tion could do itself a huge favor by renouncing any
intentions to build permanent military bases in
Iraq (which they are already building) and by
bringing Sunnis into the process, thereby taking
away much of the insurgency's popular support.
But regardless of the outcome, there will al
ways be a normative and a moral question about
what the United States done in Iraq.
The normative question concerns whether free
dom and democracy should be imposed upon a
people by sword. To an extent this can be translat
ed into an empirical question based on the eventu
al health of Iraq's democracy, but there will always
be that lurking hypocrisy surrounding the means.
The moral question is unanswerable but worth
debating: Will the outcome in Iraq be worth the
necessary loss of life? Progress always has costs,
but it is so difficult to weigh the dead bodies on a

scale with another people's freedom on the other
side. Which is heavier will always be in the eye of
the beholder.
The invasion of Iraq has arguably brought a sec
ond country that much closer to its own freedom:
Lebanon.
Is what is happening in Lebanon right now a di
rect consequence of a liberated Iraq? In reality, it
is impossible to tell. But it would be an awfully
good coincidence for there to have been pro-west
ern democratic revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine
and potentially now Lebanon without the strong,
pro-democracy stance that Bush's administration
has taken.
The lesson here is not easily learned. Bush has
done so much that our side of the aisle disagrees
with that it is almost too easy to uniformly dismiss
each and every endeavor that has his administra
tion's mark on it.
Are Bush's ends for the Middle East com
mendable? Yes. Are his means admirable? So far
no, but we'll just have to wait and see how the his
tory books record the first eight years of the 21st
century. There is still much to be written.
