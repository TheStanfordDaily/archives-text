## Selective service 
### 
Six months. 17 days. That's
how long I've been 18 years
old. $250,000 and five years in
prison. As of now, that's what
I owe the federal government
for evading the draft. 1 am a
hardnosed liberal, aren't I?
OK, OK, so maybe I'm not
actually a draft-dodger. After
all, last time I checked. Presi
dent Bush isn't looking to
commit political suicide, and a

quarter of a million dollars makes me weak in
the knees. To be quite honest, my apparent re
fusal to register for Selective Service is ground
ed for the most part in laziness, not dissent.
I recently logged onto www.sss.gov to do a lit
tle research, under mounting pressure from my
big brother and a five-year incarceration. And as
1 navigated the excessively draft-happy Web site
I became increasingly, well, draft-unhappy.
However, during the nervous hour or so I spent
surfing the Selective Service System, or SSS, I
did gain a better understanding of what exactly it
is that I'm avoiding.
The most notable facet of the System (the
strategic third "S" in "SSS" conveniently differ
entiates it from the Nazi secret police), is its
striking similarity to the College Board's Web

site. You've got your exceptionally ecstatic mod
els representing everyone from the ambiguous
blonde Asian to the Texan jock, from the token
black guy to the gawky musician. And not to be
outdone, you've got the pensive kid and the
stock kid from Guam. The only ones missing are,
of course, the women.
But the uncanny resemblance to the pro
foundly detested collegeboard.com accounts for
only a small portion of my distaste for the SSS —
after all, the Board didn't hinder my getting to
where I am today. I guess what really bugs me,
go figure, is what the Selective Service stands for
— all the baggage that the draft carries, and the
idea that upon registration there's a chance I'll
be lugging that baggage around.
The most ominous page I found on the Web
site discussed "how the draft has changed since
Vietnamv"-Most notably* f|f-a draft were heM"
today, thetfi' would be fewer reasons tofexcuse k
man from service." Great. Prior to 1971 a full
time student "could qualify fora student defer
ment if he could show he was . . . making satis
factory progress towajd a degree . .. Under the
current draft law, a college student can have his
induction postponed only until the end of the
current semester."
And thus it seems that the far-reaching tenta
cles of the draft could penetrate even the

durable walls of our Stanford bubble. It is be
coming increasingly apparent that a reinstate
ment of the draft — the first in over 30 years —
is not all that unlikely. Take the American gov
ernment's recent claims of Iranian nuclear aspi
rations, coupled with North Korea's declaration
of nuclear missile possession, not to mention the
perpetual degeneration of the war in Iraq.
I am not, however, an alarmist or a pessimist;
I am an idealist — a pragmatist at best. If ulti
mately there is a draft in Bush's second term,
which I personally wouldn't bet on, I know that
I will not take part. I'll be a happy Swiss in
Switzerland. However, I know that not everyone
is blessed with dual citizenship. Even more
pressingly, I am aware that many, including my
self, are privileged or wealthy enough to avoid
the draft, as exemplified by Bush in Vietnam.
But I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get
there ''' 'I*' 1 " " •' ni ,r ' t ti >>
The idealistic part of me would be content to
continue avoiding registration — most likely,
though, by the time this gets printed I'll have
given in to simple pragmatism and, you know, le
gality.
