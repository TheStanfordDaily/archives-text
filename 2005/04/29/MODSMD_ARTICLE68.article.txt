## Writing while inebriated 
### 
I write better
while drunk.
Well, it's not that
I write better, it's
just that writing is
boring and it's
much easier to
tolerate while
drunk. When the
night is winding
down and I'm
drunk and unoc-

cupied, I find that the words flow eas
ily. Now, many nonsensical e-mails
have shown me that for the majority
of people, the urge to write while ine
briated should be resisted, but my
drunken writing is almost indistin
guishable from what I write when
sober. In fact. I'm writing this column
while drunk.
For me, alcohol can be a produc
tivity-enhancing drug. Many short
stories and columns would still be
trapped in my mind were it not for the
magic brew. And the Greeks agreed.
They used to have big drunken par
ties called symposia in which they ar
gued philosophy and hooked up with
each other. Yes, the basis of most
Western thought is the ancient equiv
alent of a frat party.
So. if alcohol has been such a boon
to my writing and to Western civiliza
tion, imagine what harder drugs could
do? Some people might find it hard to
imagine that drugs like cocaine could
benefit society, but most doctors
would disagree. Ritalin, a drug mil
lions of children are given to counter
act hyperactivity, is similar in chemi
cal structure to speed and has physio
logical effects that are exactly the
same as cocaine. If we put cocaine in
a pill and prescribed it to these kids in
the same doses, it would have exactly
the same effect as Ritalin. Now, our
doctors seem to think that these chil
dren's lives are being enhanced by
narcotics.
Many non-hyperactive people
take Ritalin (and cocaine) illegally,
because it helps them concentrate
(basically the same effect alcohol has

on me). For these people the drug un
questionably increases their produc
tivity.
What I'm not saying. Mom, is that
you should go out and take cocaine or
drink to finish that paper. That would
he a bad idea. But these examples do
raise an interesting question. Isn't it
possible that the right drugs, in the
right doses, could enable healthy peo
ple to work harder and be happier at
the same time? If this is true, wouldn't
it enhance society as a whole to en
courage research into developing
these drugs? Imagine a world where
there are no bitch jobs, where every
thing seems wonderful if you pop a
few pills. Imagine a world where your
hidden talents come to the forefront
under the influence of certain magical
substances. If there were no drug
laws, drug companies would have an
interest in developing drugs that
could increase productivity and hap
piness at the same time with relative
ly mild side effects.
Emotions are just chemical reac
tions in our brains. And there are
times when we need certain emotions
and times when we don't need them.
Soldiers need to be brave. Judges
need to be dispassionate. The sooner
we allow drug companies to research
drugs that will control the emotions,
the sooner we will become a rational
society, in which we are no longer
slaves to our hormones.
Productivity will increase because
feelings will no longer get in the way
of business. Happiness will increase
because negative emotions will no
longer occur when they are not need
ed. What is the downside? Only free
will suffers. But if free will is simply
the result of random chemical inter
actions in the brain, what good is it?
Won't we be more free when we can
choose what we feel?
