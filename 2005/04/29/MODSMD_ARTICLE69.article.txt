# Writing in the margins
## Fiction is bogus, man 
### 
School is
bogus. I would
rather do my
laundry than
spend another
minute on
French. Unfor
tunately, I'll
probably spend
another minute
doing French
and never do my

laundry. Doing laundry would re
quire me to wait around fora ma
chine to open up, and god knows I
have at least three weeks of laundry
to do. You do not want to know
how good I smell because words
just can't even begin to describe it.
I need to enroll in a five-unit class
devoted to chores, because no
one's going to penalize me for not
doing my laundry.
Fresh out of high school and
desperately afraid of college cours
es, I cared a little too much first
quarter. Required reading spilled
out of me; my life revolved around
my workload. I was no hermit,
that's for sure, but if you didn't go
to Stanford, you probably didn't
hear much from me. The stress of
putting school ahead of life forced
me to crack open a book for plea
sure. I needed 40 to 50 minutes a
day to devote to the mellow plea
sures of escaping into someone
else's world.
These days, I enjoy avoiding my
work. I do my work, don't get me
wrong, but I'd really rather eat in
the dining hall seven days a week
than do my work. The stack for this
week seems fairly tall. Knowing
this, I brought Nietzsche with me to
Lake Lagunita in order to read
while my friend Lauren and I con
quered the Lake on our co-opted
raft/flotation device.
I stared at Lake Lag all last
quarter. I've always liked the lake,
ever since I ventured there during
Admit Weekend, but when it's sky
blue, and the ducks are resting on
the surface as the wind blows little

waves, I love Lake Lag. To prove
my love, I will include this embar
rassing statistic: I have 107 pictures
of Lake Lag's water-filled glory.
Now that it's spring quarter, and
the Lake's days are numbered, it's
time to stop taking it for granted
and launch my fat ass out onto the
water.
Today has been one of the more
exciting days of my life. It took
Lauren and me awhile to figure out
how to properly steer and name
Bounderby, but give Stanford stu
dents three hours and two large
pieces of wood, there isn't anything
we can't do. We stopped every now
and then, determined to read, and
so we did, but no matter how inter
esting Nietzsche is, he's just not
compelling when I'm on a thing
called Bounderby, and we float
around conquering forests of
aquatic plants in the name of God,
Glory and Amazalondra.
No book can compete with the
murky water, strange plants and
gentle rocking. Not even Alice
Munro could steal me away from
the amazing world right before me.
I'm not sure any author could con
vey my day properly in the written
word. I can't either. Neither Lau
ren nor I brought a camera, causing
us great distress. Sometimes words
fail to communicate.
My life at that moment is more
interesting than anything in any
book, assigned or pleasurable.
Sure, it seems sort of trite, I can
image being 65 and telling young
people about that time when I was
on a raft on a tiny, temporary lake.
One day, it'll be written in some
coming-of-age novel, but that's
for another time. I have to go back
to the lake. We're going to raft in
the darkness and avoid doing
work, because really, school is
bogus, man.

Seth thinks Lake Lag shouldn't be
filled. Send your two cents to ssham
