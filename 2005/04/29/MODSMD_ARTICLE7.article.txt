# SPCTRM tackles info translation
## Program takes clinical research to the next level 
### NILA BALA STAFF WRITER 
Six years ago, Dr. Philip Pizzo left a children's hospital
in Boston to become the dean of Stanford's School of
Medicine. Soon after his arrival, he received an e-mail
from an assistant professor detailing the difficulties he was
facing in his clinical research.
In response. Pizzo assembled a survey of clinical re
searchers who found that more than half got assistance
with biostatistics — an integral part of examining clinical
data — informally or "on the curbside." Without regular
access to biostatisticians, many clinical researchers at Stan
ford were running into road blocks.
After years of investigation, the Stanford / Packard
Center for Translational Medicine, or SPCTRM, has been
created as a multidisciplinary response to the problem.
"SPCTRM will help provide the infrastructure that will
enable Stanford physicians and investigators to design and
implement clinical trials with the highest standards possi
ble," Pizzo said.
"[Pizzo] saw a necessity to build on basic research and
develop and enhance translational capabilities," said
Steven Alexander, professor of pediatrics. "Translation
doesn't work without a lot of infrastructure, which six
years ago was lacking at Stanford."
So what does "translation" in the clinical sense mean?
Alexander said that the Stanford has expanded beyond
the original definition of the word.
"Translation incorporates the specific processes used
to make a discovery and put it into practice." Alexander
said. "In the broadest sense, translation is bench to bed
side research — working with all the steps from something
uncovered in the lab to using those dis
coveries on humans. In fact, we've
taken it a step further and made it
bench to bed-side to bench. We take
research back to the lab to develop and
refine it."
One of SPCTRM's major goals is to
automate many of the systems involved
in handing off research from one stage
to the next. Researchers h< >pe it will cen
tralize many of the processes involved in
clinical research to increase the quality
of results. The list of services SPC TRM
will provide includes a Web site de
signed to track clinical trials, the hiring
of biostatisticians and informatics con
sultants and the centralization of clinical
research inquiries.
A main component ol SPCFRM's
agenda, Piz/o said, is to conduct "clini

cal research with the highest degree of
integrity and excellence."
While the program is not a direct re
sult of the fatal incidents caused by
drugs like Vioxx and Paxil, Alexander
said he believes that preventing similar
failures in clinical research has been a
driving factor in SPCTRM's efforts.
"Drug companies are being told to
open up research data with the two big
scandals over the last year or so,"
Alexander said. "Partly as a response
to public confidence, our Web site will
make every trial being conducted
available to the public."
Willi funds from Stanford I lospital
and C linics and the Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital among other
sources, Alexander and his team plan
to have SPC fully operational by
September of this year. At that point,
SPCTRM will absorb research coordi
nator education. training and monitor
ing programs currently offered
through the Academic Consortium for
Clinical Kxcellence in Scientific Stud

"We will at some point, when
everything is in place with the new bio
statisticians and data managers, say
'the store is open for business,' but it's
not that business isn't already happen
ing," said Harry Greenberg, professor
of medicine and senior associate dean
of research.
"Some of the services SPCTRM
promises are already being provided,"
Alexander said. "We want to intro
duce two or three new additions at a
time, and then add a few more, since
we can't completely stop clinical re
search while putting in the new pro
gram."
He added that he is very excited
about the changes SPCTRM will bring
to the Stanford community.
"SPCI RM builds on the strength
of Stanford Hospital, the University
and the School of Medicine," Alexan
der said. "1 hope that people will look
up at Stanford and say 'This is a differ
ent kind of place for clinical research.' "
