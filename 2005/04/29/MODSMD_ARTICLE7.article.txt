# SPCTRM tackles info translation
## Program takes clinical research to the next level 
### NILA BALA STAFF WRITER 
Six years ago, Dr. Philip Pizzo left a children's hospital
in Boston to become the dean of Stanford's School of
Medicine. Soon after his arrival, he received an e-mail
from an assistant professor detailing the difficulties he was
facing in his clinical research.
In response. Pizzo assembled a survey of clinical re
searchers who found that more than half got assistance
with biostatistics — an integral part of examining clinical
data — informally or "on the curbside." Without regular
access to biostatisticians, many clinical researchers at Stan
ford were running into road blocks.
After years of investigation, the Stanford / Packard
Center for Translational Medicine, or SPCTRM, has been
created as a multidisciplinary response to the problem.
"SPCTRM will help provide the infrastructure that will
enable Stanford physicians and investigators to design and
implement clinical trials with the highest standards possi
ble," Pizzo said.
"[Pizzo] saw a necessity to build on basic research and
develop and enhance translational capabilities," said
Steven Alexander, professor of pediatrics. "Translation
doesn't work without a lot of infrastructure, which six
years ago was lacking at Stanford."
So what does "translation" in the clinical sense mean?
Alexander said that the Stanford has expanded beyond
the original definition of the word.
"Translation incorporates the specific processes used
to make a discovery and put it into practice." Alexander
said. "In the broadest sense, translation is bench to bed
side research — working with all the steps from something
