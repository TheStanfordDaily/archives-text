# Water in the milk bottle
## Ignorance is Bliss When it Conies to Banking 
### 
In the last year or so, a lot of my
friends have told me they've begun
to disregard the news. "It's just too
depressing," they say. "I can't bring
myself to face it."
That is how I feel about my bank
account.
With me, money flows like water.
Flows out, that is — rushes out in
torrents, then dribbles away and all

the while there's
that tiny bit at the
top that's perpet
ually just evapo
rating.
As with any
problem that
needs correction,
I try to begin by
observing the
process, looking
for the chink in

the pipes, the weakness where
things go wrong. So fora few
months, I went around and watched
myself spend money. This was rea
sonably pleasant.
Less pleasant was finally sitting
down to evaluate my transaction
history. The evaporating bit appar
ently comes from my foodie habit
combined with a lack of kitchen
skills (read: patience). I have long
since marked up this expense as un
avoidable. Instead, I'm choosing to
target the major leaks.
In my recent statements, the
large purchases have been a WWI
16mm movie camera off Ebay, with
lenses, etc., and a Fender Stratocast
er, with amp, etc.
As the use of 'etc.' might suggest,
I am still not sure exactly what all I
bought, as I have yet to make use of
the camera or learn to play the guitar.
My penchant for creating such
useless outlets for my liquid cash
How clearly indicates a false sense of
incredible wealth. The question
then becomes. How can I spend
money in a way that makes me feel
as poor as I actually am?
Thus far, I've found only two
things that really make me cringe —
parking meters and vending ma
chines.
There's something about count
ing out weighty little coins and feed
ing them one by one into the coin slot
that makes you feel the money pass
ing out of you. The coins are tricky to
manipulate. The dimes get jammed
in together or you drop some nickels
or you don't count the change fast
enough and the vending machine re
funds you, nonconsensually.
In short, coins do not flow like
water. They flow like toilet paper.
Like toilet paper in a public re
stroom where the toilet paper roll
has obviously been compressed so
that it does not actually roll.
I thought perhaps if all my trans
actions were as ungainly as a mis
shapen roll of toilet paper, I might
feel the same distress about my
other purchases. So I tried paying
for things in cash only, coins only,
which worked until I started confus
ing Susie B's for quarters. And while
I did feel deeply saddened with each
passing coin. I also felt embarrassed.
People stare. People stare at me
for many reasons, like when I sing to
myself while snowboarding. But
when you pay for books in coins, and
confuse your coins, people stare be
cause you are slow. Partly because
slow looks stupid, but also because
slow prevents soccer moms from
picking up their kids on time and
causes all kinds of people to hate you.
So I had to give up on that, but
fortunately, serendipitously, some
thing else happened to curb my reg
ular free-spending ways.
During Dead Week, just before I
went online to flagrantly book a
flight to Rome, I received a call from
my bank.
"Did you purchase any maga
zines or cosmetics online over the
weekend?" the lady asked.
I had not. Some random person,
possibly my guardian angel, had
spent the weekend using my debit
card for calcium supplements and
the DVD of White Chicks. (Appar
ently the companies could only ship
to the billing address.)
In consequence, I spent nothing
and went nowhere fora week until I
received my new debit card. Now,
while this does not permanently
cripple my debit spending habits, 1
did have to move money around be
tween accounts and ATMs and in
the process I have gotten extremely
confused about it all.
And, as I have mentioned, I do
not like to look at my statements.
Now that I have no idea how much
money is behind the plastic, I've
been spending quite conservatively.
