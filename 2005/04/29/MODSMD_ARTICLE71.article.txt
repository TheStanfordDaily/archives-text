# Leaning on Legacy for admission
## 
### NOAH WEISS STAFF WRITER 
They are the students who have
owned a Stanford sweatshirt of every
size, from a baby small to an adult
large; went to nursery school in Es
condido Village; and were in the
stands to watch the Big Game when
"The Play" put a sour end to Elway's
collegiate career.
They are the children of alumni.
At Harvard, their acceptance rate
was 40 percent in 2(X)3. At Princeton,
35 percent and at the University of
Pennsylvania, 41 percent. With ac
ceptance rates at these top universi
ties in the low teens, legacy appli
cants are more than three times as
likely to receive a thick admission
package than other students.
Cornell University even sends
children of alumni letters encourag
ing them to apply.
Unlike all of the Ivy League
schools, which now fully disclose
their legacy admission statistics,
Stanford does not report on both the
percentage of legacy applicants ad
mitted and what percent of the study
body are children of alumni.
"We do not release any data that
is broken down by any subgroup of
applicants, whether broken down by
legacy connection, special talent, ge
ography [or] academic interest," said
Director of Admissions Anna Marie
Porras.
The only legacy information Por
ras could divulge was that "each year
[Stanford is] unable to offer admis
sion to the majority of legacy appli
cants,"
At other top-tier universities like
Harvard, Princeton and University
of Pennsylvania, legacy students on
average make up about 13 percent of
the student body.
In defense of Stanford's non-dis
closure policy, Porras said, "This is
not a practice in place to keep legacy
data private. This is a consistent and
long standing practice for all sub
groups of applicants."
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions does, however, provide
admission data of ethnic- and racial
minority students. The class of 2(X)8
is 8.45 percent Black and 10.82 per
cent Hispanic.
Legacies bring sense of tradition
It is argued that children of alum
ni bring a sense of tradition and a link
to a school's history that other stu
dents do not.
"This is a university that was
founded by parents in memory of
their child," Porras said. "This is a
community that honors family ties at
its core but also recognizes our im
portant responsibility to invite new
members into the Stanford family."
Howard Wolf, president of the
Stanford Alumni Association, sup
ports the legacy policy because it
"provide[s[ for intergenerational
transfer of loyalty to Stanford."

Moreover, "Stanford's legacy ad
mission policy acknowledges the
vital role in support of one of the
University's most valuable stake
holders; its alumni," Wolf said.
The extent to which legacy con
tributes to an applicant's admission
varies across universities. At the
University of Michigan, applicants
are rated on a "selection index" of
150 points, where 100 points is usual
ly enough to be admitted; students
with legacy receive four points.
At Harvard, the admissions dean
personally reads every application
from alumni children and uses the
legacy status "as a tie-breaker be
tween comparable candidates," ac
cording to a series of Pulitzer Prize
winning articles published by The
Wall Street Journal published

Jan. 13,2003.
Stanford uses a similar
approach in evaluating pos
sible applicants.
"Among equally quali
fied candidates, [legacy]
could be a plus factor,!

Porras said.
"Such consid
eration, how
ever, is never
enough to
admit a stu
dent who
would not 4
be com-

pelling in our
process without
such considera-

tion."
Porras em
phasized that
by no means
do legacy
considera-

tions com
promise the

academic
standards Stan-

ford to which it holds
admitted students.

"Legacy is an additional factor
that is considered in an application,!
she said. "It does not substitute for
academic success in high school and
preparation for the rigors of Stan
ford."
One who
called "Tottt*' to maintain his fami
ly's privacy, believed that legacy

played a much bigger factor.
"I wouldn't be surprised if they
didnit closely read the essays on my
application," Tom said."l think the
legacy overshadows everything else.
As long as you have hallway decent
grades and can be near the top of
your class in high school, you can
make it."
Tom's legacy spans four genera
tions and includes 10 people, from
his great-great grandfather and

great-great uncle in the 1910s, to him
and his two cousins who are current
ly students. He said he thought that
the weight legacy has in admission
considerations was evident in his ap-

plication.
"The only spot on the entire ap
plication form where they said eat
tach another sheet if you need more
spacei was the erelatives at Stanford'
space," I'om said. "1 needed to attach
another sheet."
In his high schooHs history, the
only other student Stanford admit
ted was a football player on an ath
letic scholarship.
"Without the legacy factor, 1

would not have gotten in here" said
Tom, even though he was salutatori
an. "But now that I'm here, I feel like
I fit in. And who knows, maybe this
will show Stanford that kids from my
area can make it here."
Freshman David Sinsky had sim
ilarly suspect feelings about the im
portance of legacy, even though his
family's record paled in comparison
to Tom's. Sinsky has a sister who is
currently a junior and a dad who at
tended Stanford in the 19705.
"When they asked for the gradu
ation date [of my dad], 1 had to leave
that blank," Sinsky said. "Hopefully
my kids won't have to do that for me,
but at the rate Ifm going, you never
know."
Sinsky attributed much of his ad
mission to his sister.
"Part of the reason my sister
helped me was that we had a lot of
the same test scores, even though
she's a lot smarter than me," Sinsky
said. "After they accepted her, it
probably made it harder for them to
reject me."

Trade Stanford a
building
for an admission?
Another special group of
applicants are those stu
dents whose families have
been major donors to the

view with The Wall
Street Journal pub
lished on April 13,
2(X)3, former Dean of

Admissions Robin
Mamlet said, "I will
certainly factor in a
history of very signifi
cant giving to Stan

major donors.
While the media has often
depicted legacy admissions as
affirmative action for wealthy
white students, this image is

changing.

jp "The ksgacy pool is becom
ing more and more diverse,"
Porras said. "We have
begun to see applications
from the children of
alumni

whose back-

grounds were
significantly underrepresented on
campus before Stanford's successful
affirmative-action programs of the
1970s and 1980s."
Alumni Association President
Wolf noted, "Our alumni of color
are as interested in maintaining our
legacy admission policy as are our
majority alumni."
Wolf recalled that during the Mi
nority Alumni Conference last
spring, one woman stood up during

Mamlet's question-and-answer ses
sion in support of continued attention
to legacy. "Don't get rid of legacies,
because it's our children now," she
said, according to an article in the July
2(X)4 issue of Stanford Magazine.
"Her comment was met with a
round of applause from the crowd,"
Wolf said.
Political pressure
Lately, there has been an upsurge
in political criticism of legacy admis
sions. On Aug. 6,2(K)4, CNN.com re
ported that President Bush, a Yale
legacy admit, said admission should
be based only on merit and that there
should be no ispecial exception for
certain people.
In an article published on Oct. 29,
2003, The Wall Street Journal re
ported on a bill introduced by Sena
tor Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.),
who was a legacy admit at Harvard,
that would require colleges lto re
port on the race and economic status
of first-year students who are rela
tives of alumni.
With a history of calling for the
end of legacy admissions, Senator
John Edwards (D-N.C.) was a key
supporter of the bill.
"Requiring these disclosures
should encourage colleges to take a
hard look at a practice that tilts the
admissions process against the kids
who face the biggest obstacles," Ed
wards said.
Administrators at top universities
balked at having to hold their admis
sions process accountable to the gov
ernment. The bill has yet to be voted
on.
Without government interven
tion, changing the legacy admissions
policy will be difficult. Universities
depend on their alumni for both
their financial support and their vol
unteer efforts. Many alumni feel tied
to their alma mater because they
want to have their children follow
their legacy.
"The vast majority of legacy appli
cants are denied admission to Stan
ford," Wolf said. "We are concerned
and actively involved in creating real
istic expectations for the alumni par
ents of students who wish to apply by
educating them as to the competitive
nature of the admission process."
The want — and the expectation
— that one might share her cher
ished Stanford experience with her
child is something most students and
alumni have. In 1982, U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Con
nor, whose son Jay was a sophomore
and her son Scott had graduated,
succinctly expressed this desire in
her 1952 commencement address.
"You will all be lucky enough to
have your children attend this par
adise on earth ... that we call Stan
ford," she said.
