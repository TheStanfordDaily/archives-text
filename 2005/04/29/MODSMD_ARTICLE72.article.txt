# Cheating with a cell phone in hand
## 
### CAROLINE CICCONE 
It used to he that professors con
sidered cellphones annoying for in
terrupting lectures. But now, they
have another reason to keep cell
phones out of classrooms: Students
across the country are using cell
phones to cheat on exams.
A camera phone can store pic
tures of graphs, formulas, you name
it. Answers can be shared via text
messaging.
This trend is alarming to many
educators and some, like Stanford
economics instructor Mark Tendall,
are taking action to prevent this sort
of cheating.
"1 have included a few words
about cell phone use (Ino visible
cellphones?) to my usual Honor
Code reminders before exams ...
but as far as 1 am aware, we have not
yet had any specific cases (actual or
alleged cheating) in the economics
department," he wrote in an e-mail
to The Daily.
On campus, officials at the Of
fice of Judicial Affairs, a division of
the Office of the Dean of Students,
the use of cell phones to cheat hasn't
become a problem yet.
Laurette Beeson, judicial advisor,
said that in her five years at Stanford,
there has been only one case brought
to Judicial Affairs involving the use
of cell phones in cheating.
The case, processed in fall quarter
2002, involved two students accused
of text messaging each other during
an in-class exam. Both students pro
duced their cell phone records,
which showed no incidence of this
text messaging. Due to lack of evi
dence, the case was withdrawn.
As of July 16, the Office of Judi
cial Affairs reviewed 65 cases in
volving honor code violations in
2004.

There were 104 cases in 2(XK)-() 1,
84 in 2001-2002 and % in 2002-2003.
"The more articles live read say
itfs happening on the high school
level," Beeson said. But other than
the 2(X)2 incident, she has not seen
any evidence of cell phone cheating
on campus.
An article published in the Wall
Street Journal on Sept. 10 cited ex
amples of picture-sending at Vir
ginia State University and text-mes
saging at the University of Mary
land. The article reported that cell
phone use during exams is a grow
ing form of cheating.
While this kind of cheating may
not he taking place on campus,
some students are aware of the cell
phonei's capability as a cheating
tool.
Arihant Jain. Class 2004, says
that the use of cell phones to cheat is
common in private high schools in
India, where he is from.
"What's more interesting is
when people are in the same exami
nation room," Jain said. "Under
their proctor's nose, people are ball
sy enough to exchange answers, to
exchange pictures."
That's not to say that cheating
using cell phones doesn't happen
here, Beeson admits. Similarly, it's
impossible to compare the actual in
cidence of cheating to the number
of accused or charged perpetrators.
"We don't have any way to mea
sure what's not coming to us,i Bee
son said.
Yuen said that there is a lot of
potential for abusing technology to
cheat.
"There are so many different
mediums for storing information!
iPods, Black√üerrys, Treos, cell
phones," he said.
For now, Beeson hopes to edu
cate professors and teaching assis

tants about their roles and responsi
bilities involving the Honor Code,
and the possibility of cell phone use
in cheating.
"Teaching stall are more aware
of the possibility," Beeson said.
Employees of the Office of Judi
cial Affairs are aware that cell
phone cheating may become more
prevalent as students become more
comfortable and knowledgeable of
the capabilities of technology.
Beeson believes that this sort of

preventative education can help
students to realize when someone
might think they are cheating, even
when they are not. Then students
can protect themselves from a
wrongful accusation.
"You want to help students
avoid the appearance [of cheat
ing]," Beeson said.
At least for now, students, pro
fessors and administrators are be
coming aware of this new form of
cheating. Beeson says there is little

harm in reporting in questionable
situation.
"People certainly can report
them and should," she said. If stu
dents see something disconcerting,
under the honor code, students are
obligated to do something. People
should be asked to get off their cell
phones [in class]."

By snapping a digital picture with a camera cell phone during an exam and storing the image, students give them
selves an illicit edge when taking tests.
