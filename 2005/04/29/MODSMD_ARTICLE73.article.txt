# TYPE A: NOT JUST A PERSONALITY TRAIT

Robert Sapolsky wrote in his
book "Why Zebras Don't Get Ul

eType-A" people as immensely
competitive, overachieving, time
pressured and hostile."
Because people with these
traits seemed more prevalent in
their cardiology clinic than in
other clinics, Friedman and
Rosenman linked these behaviors
with an increased risk of heart dis
ease.
However, other doctors were
skeptical of the causal relation
ship between "Type-A" behaviqd
and heart disease. Many thouflijV
that heart disease was a cause,
and not a result, of "Type-A'ljljni
haviors.

studies and broke the constella

The phrase "Type A" is often
used to describe someone who is
fast-moving, aggressive, inconsid
erate and a stickler for detail.
This popular conception of
"Type A" has its origins in studies
from the 1960s that found a con
nection between people exhibit
ing these behaviors and an in
creased risk of heart disease.
"Type A" is not a personality
type," Dr. Wesley Alles, director
of the Stanford Health Improve
ment Program, said. "It is a chron
ic-progressive disease that pro
duces excessive risk for disease,
especially heart disease and Type
2 diabetes."
The "Type A" trait was origi
nally discovered when cardiolo
gists Dr. Meyer Friedman and Dr.
Ray Rosenman became aware of
the fact that'their upholstered
chairs in the lobby would wear out
more quickly than chairs in the of
fices of physicians in other fields.

shred the waiting room chairs
while waiting for their appoint

early 1960s to describe a collec

significant predictor of heart dis
ease," Sapolsky wrote in his book.
"These various studies have sug
gested that a high degree of hos
tility predicts coronary heart dis
ease, atherosclerosis, hemorrhag
ic stroke and higher rates of mor
tality with these diseases."
However, Sapolsky added,
studies have also shown that hos
tility leads to an increased risk of

What distinguishes "Type-

what Sapolsky called a feeling of
"tirne-pressuredness," which ulti
raately is a symptom of insecurity.

According to Sapolsky, Fried
man and Rosenmanfs work also
.suggests that insecurity predicts
cardiovascular
than hostility, "although theirs
appears to be a minority view in
the field."
Alles elaborated on "Type
A"disease as an interior struggle
with insecurity.
"It's not that "Type-A" people
are insecure, it's that they engage
in a lot of struggle to maintain se
curity and self esteem," he said.

"So 'Type-A" is definitely a be
havior pattern that is learned and
reinforced — it is not inherited."
People are classified as "Type-
A" by "using a structured interview
and video-tape that looks for signs
and symptoms," said Alles.
Alles suggested looking at these
types as a continuum, rather than
as a set of distinct categories since
the higher a persom's score, the
worse his or her symptoms are like
ly to be. Other types of tests used to
track "Type-A" behavior, such as

those conducted on paper, are not
as accurate.
Fortunately, there is a way for
individuals who have "Type A" to
cope. Alles suggested that "Type-
A' individuals undergo behavior
modification that employs igroup
support, cognitive re-structuring,
acceptance, affection, serenity and
self esteem to counter the unneces
sary struggle."
