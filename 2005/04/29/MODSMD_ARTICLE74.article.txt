New research suggests there may be treatment for those who cannot con
trol the impulse to steal.

study is completely confidential,
the illegality of shoplifting might
make kleptomaniacs wary.
"1 think people don't call us be
cause they think it's a sting,"
Koran explained.
Aboujaoude mentioned other
reservations kleptomaniacs might
have with participating in a trial.
"I think people are very hesitant
to come forward with this problem,
even to see a psychiatrist," he said.
"There's a lot of shame and a lot of
guilt in [admitting you're a klepto
maniac]."
The drug used in this study is
called Lexapro and is commonly
used to treat depression. It is a class
of drugs known as selective sero
tonin reuptake inhibitors, which
allow serotonin to remain in the ner
vous system. Serotonin, Koran ex
plained. is a chemical messenger that
tells nerves to "quiet down," making
them less likely to send a signal.
This mechanism is effective in
depression because certain parts of
the brain are hyperactive in the dis
ease. Quieting the nerves there
quells the hyperactivity and allevi
ates the symptoms of depression.
Although no one is sure how
kleptomania operates in the brain,
Koran studied the effects of this
drug on compulsive shoppers
through control trials and found
that there was improvement in two
thirds to three-fourths of the partic
ipants. Since both kleptomania and
compulsive buying are impulse con
trol disorders, he thought the drug
might also work for treating those
with an impulsive urge to steal.
While this is one of the first rig
orous trials to address this issue, the
researchers hope that the study and
its results will remove some of the
stigma from the condition and that
those placing themselves at risk
every time they step into a store will
finally find a solution.

Some people steal because they
cannot afford to buy the merchan
dise. Sometimes teenagers and
pre-teens will steal on a dare or as
an act of rebellion. And some peo
ple steal because they are driven to
it by urges they cannot control.
This last group consists of peo
ple with kleptomania.
Although "kleptomaniac" is a
term tossed around lightly in mod
ern speech, kleptomania is an offi
cially recognized disease falling
into the category of impulse-con
trol disorders, such as compulsive
gambling.
Impulse-control disorders sig
nificantly impact the lives of those
who suffer from them but they
have not been the subject of much
research.
A team of researchers at Stan
ford, led by Dr. Lorrin Koran, a
psychiatry professor, is seeking to
alter this trend by conducting the
first ever placebo-controlled study
of a drug that could alleviate the
symptoms of kleptomania.
The disorder has specific hall
marks that distinguish it from sim
ple shoplifting: Kleptomaniacs
feel an intense and irrational im
pulse to steal items they donft
need or could afford without re
sorting to theft.
No one is sure what causes the
uncontrollable urge to steal in
kleptomaniacs since so little re
search has been conducted on the
condition. As Koran explained,
the trend in psychopharmacology
has been to study illnesses that can
often be life-threatening, such as
schizophrenia and depression.
"The best estimate of people with
kleptomania is six in 1 ,000,"Koran
explained. "That's 35,000 in the Bay
Area by that estimate."
Yet because so few seek help,
the statistic is only a guess. It is not
based on hard epidemiological
data, added Koran. Although the
