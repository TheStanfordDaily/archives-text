# Giving blood: Centers aim to recruit student donors
## 
### EUGENIE KIM HEALTH EDITOR 
lor the generation <>112 people who lived through
World War 11. donating blood on a regular basis
was considered to be a commonplace civic duty.
Today it us still these Americans, now reaching
older ages. \\ ho support blood banks, lint as health
problems require them to request blood rather
than donate, both older and younger Americans
may be laced with a shortage of blood. The con
cern felt by many health officials is whether this
older generation will be able to depend upon
younger generations to sustain the blood supply.
To counter this potential future shortage. Stan
with 15 other universities, is taking
paring grassroots effort to promote blood do-

"Hazily.. the problem
into is

that it seems
blood is need
ed more and
more and

are having a
harder and
harder time
recruiting

"| You n g

so much going
on. so man\
media messages
out there that it's
difficult to filter out
what's important."
she added
Because ol this lack

of awareness among people-aged 17 to 24. the Ad
Council decided to work in conjunction with the
three major Mood groups the American Red
( loss. America's Blood ( enters and A A BB (for
merlv known as the American Association of
Blood Banks) to create the Blo'odsaves cam
paign. I hough the three blood organizations have
worked together on smaller projects, this is (he
first time the\ have joined forces tosiipport such a
large campaign.
"This is really an unprecedented partnership
between the three blood groups and the Ad ( oun
cil." I -illyn I isher. manager ol ( orporale Commu
nications at the Ad ( ouncil. said.
I'hrough a series of print, radio and television ad
vertisements and public service announcements, or
PSAs, launched in September 2(KM. these organi/a
tions sav llicv hope lo educate a new generation
about the importance of blood donations
As part ol me nationwide campaign, the Ad
Council, a iron prolit .organization that gathers
volunteer contributions Irom the advertising in
dustry to create public serv ice announcements, an
nounced on Jan, 2b that ii had selected lb Universi
ties to participate in a grassroots public education
campaign to promote blood donations on campus.
Stanford kicked oil us campaign with blood
drives on I eh. 2N and Mar I I he blood drives in
cluded promotions such as a drawing- lor a tree

bands printed with the Bloodsaves.com" Web
site and extensive llyering across campus to raise

awareness about the events.
The Bloodsaves Web site (http://www.Mood
saves.com) includes facts and statistics about the
need for blood donors, ;i zip-code search for near
by blood centers and an interactive qui/, to educate
the Web site visitors about myths about blood do
nation.
According to the Web site, approximately ft()
percent of the United States population is eligible
to donate blood, but only 5 percent actually take
the time and effort to donate.
"We do a lot of research before and during, and
focus groups show that young people really want
to make a difference in the world but that donating

blood is just not on the
radar," Fisher said.

Sop homo re
Mark Liao. an ex
ecutive officer of
the Stanford chap
ter of the Ameri
can Red Cross and
Bloodsaves' 011-
campus student
representative, said
that he was heart-

ened by (lie at

of the stu

the Univer
sity.
"We

that actually
stopped on

the spot and went to donate." hew rote in an e-mail
to the Daily. "They usually weren't aware they
could donate, and. thanks to our volunteers on that
day. these on-the-spot donors took the time to do
nate blood What a great feeling."
Despite the success of being able to spur some
students into donating blood for the first time.
Myndman s;iid that in the short term, the Blood
saves campaign on campus was not as successful as
event organizers had hoped it would be.
"I !n fortunately. the blood drives that we had
where we used Bloodsaves actually did very poorly."
she said "We actually had fewer people tum out this
time than we usually do during blood drives."
I isher said that the Ad Council is currently in
the process ol evaluating the success of the Blood
saves campaign by measuring the number of stu
dents who participated in the Bloodsaves-spon
sored blood drives and tracking the number of hits
that the campaign Web site received. Yet these
numbers may not provide the most accurate gauge
of whether the Bloodsaves campaign is reaching
people in the long term.
Fisher added: "Our goal with the (public service
announcement | campaign and the ad campaign is
really not to increase short-term donations but to
create a new generation ol lifelong blood donors."
