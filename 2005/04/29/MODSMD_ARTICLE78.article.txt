## Toilet technology talks 
### DANIEL BERDICHEVSKY 
"Welcome to Taiwan," said the toilet,
which then broke out in birdsong.
I hesitated fora while before remember
ing why I was there — and flinched when the
trashcan to my right whirred loudly and
opened its own lid. The air then crackled be
hind me: Some kind of dangerous deodoriz
ing process, I guessed. And that's when I
fled.
At the time I was in Taipei fora spring
break exchange program at National Taiwan
University. While there I did my duty as an
Innovation columnist. I visited a warren of
side streets that sold gadgets like Fry's Elec
tronics gone mad, spread out over 10 city
blocks. 1 flew in jumbo jets, took tours of
high-tech chip manufacturing plants and
even met a professor of parapsychology (i.e.
ESP). Companies had karaoke rooms for
their employees; the coffee shops featured
wireless Internet and very good gelato. Vend
ing machines served hot sandwiches or — if
you were in the mood for it — a sports drink
called "Pocari Sweat."
But nothing impressed me more than the
toilets.
Mind you, I went to a high school where
the custodians were lucky if students remem
bered what toilets were for and didn't rip
them out of the ground for sport.
So this, for me, was culture shock.
My very first night, I encountered a toilet
with a heated lid and a button marked
"shower." Against my better instincts I
pressed it — then jumped to my feet as hot
water sprayed me where I wasn't meant to be
sprayed. It hit the ceiling instead.
Since returning stateside, I've done a little
research. It turns out my experience was far
from unique: An American diplomat at a
function in Japan once pressed the wrong toi
let button and ended up on his hands and
knees trying to dry out the bathroom before
he caused a political incident.
I learned that Taiwan may be tops when it
comes to memory chips, but Japan is indis
putably the world's toilet leader. Some re
cent Japanese units recognize whether some
one is standing over them, then lift and lower
their lids automatically for male visitors.
Others take your blood pressure and other
vital signs, relaying them directly to your
doctor. (While I'm certain this must be very
useful, I'm not sure I'd want my doctor
knowing my bathroom habits.)
I even came across a press release about a
new a'slot'for SDTOemo
ry, the same format used in PDAs, MP3 play
ers and digital cameras. It was in Japanese, so
I couldn't make out precisely what the slot
was for, but 1 have my guesses: You can prob
ably have the toilet play whatever music
makes you the most... comfortable.
Japanese toilet technology is not all about
comfort; it can also be ecologically friendly.
In 1988, a top Japanese toilet manufacturer,
Toto, released the Otohime, a toilet accesso
ry that simulates the sound of running water.
Its target audience: People who are shy
about others overhearing them "powdering
their noses" and so would ordinarily flush the
toilet an extra time for camouflage.
Toto estimated that a Japanese company
with 400 female employees (who, their mar
ket studies indicated, were more bathroom
shy) could save 10 million liters of water per
year by eliminating these unnecessary flush
es. Market incentives triumphed, and the
Otohime proved to be a huge success.
Hoping to expand its clientele, Toto re
cently introduced its Neorest toilet in the
United States. It is heated, offers both "show
er" and bidet functions and automatically de
odorizes itself. The last would be perfect for
dorms, particularly over the weekend. The
cost, though, may not win many fans in the
University housing service: about $S,(XX) per
toilet.
Japanese companies don't have a
monopoly on premium toilets. One Ameri
can company sells a model with lumbar sup
port, drink holders and a security system for
keeping away unauthorized users.
Even in the United States, I sometimes
come across a public toilet with a sterile plas
tic wrap that rotates around the seat, along
with a label assuring me that the wrap is de
stroyed after each use. Some more ambitious
cities, including Boston and Seattle, have in
stalled self-cleaning bathrooms in urban
areas. The ones in Boston charge a quarter
and include space for advertisements to help
recoup costs.
I've often heard that every new technolo
gy can be benevolent or dangerous, depend
ing on how it is used, and toilets are no ex
ception. One had a label warning that "chil
dren. elderly persons and persons with sensi
tive skin are advised not to sit long on the
warmed seat" because it might "cause low
temperature burns."
Fortunately. I came through unscathed.
I can only imagine the future. Toilets that
reward children for good aim. Toilets that
massage you. Toilets with flat-screen enter
tainment units. Toilets with attached sinks
for brushing your teeth. Toilets that weigh
you - both before and after.
The talking toilet in Taipei may not have
had nearly that many bells and whistles, but
it worked: I felt so welcomed in Taiwan that
I'm heading back in May. This time, I'm
bringing along plenty of bathroom reading.

peared in The Daily on April 12, 2005.

Toilets were just the beginning; over spring
break Daniel also encountered three-way
showers and aggressive bathroom doors. To
