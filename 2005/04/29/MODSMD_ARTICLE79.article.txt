## Best of INNOVATION 2005 Mozilla Firefox browser blazes worldwide 
### MICHELLE KELLER MANAGING EDITOR 
Like David and Goliath, the
Mozilla Foundation — a small,
nonprofit organization offering
open-source software — is set to
battle the software giant Microsoft
in the realm of Internet browsers.
Mozilla's weapon of choice
against its Goliath? Mozilla Fire
fox 1.0: A super-fast Web browser,
in part created by Stanford sopho
more Blake Ross, set to compete
against Microsoft's Internet Ex
plorer.
As in the parable, the little
guy's chances are looking good.
Last Tuesday, the day Mozilla
Firefox was released, over one mil
lion people downloaded the
browser. People on all seven conti
nents are downloading and using
the browser — yes, even a re
search group in Antarctica is surf
ing the Web with Mozilla Firefox.
Since June of this year, Mozil
la's share of Web browsing in
creased three percentage points;
Microsoft's share, on the other
hand, slipped three, according to
the Internet usage tracker Web-
Side Story.
"I think Microsoft is getting a
little nervous," Ross said. "They
aren't sleeping anymore. They're
talking about us on their Weblog
and have started to contact the
press about us."
Balancing his time between
classes and the development of the
browser, Ross has been working
part-time at Mozilla to develop the
project and remains part of the
Mozilla Firefox core team.
"It's exciting because open
source software hadn't really
taken off until Firefox," Ross said.
"Other open-source products
were more for techie people and
weren't really developed for the
user."
Ross started working on build
ing "a better" browser while other
kids were just getting hooked on
instant messenger. He worked on
of Netscape at
tne age of 14 and eventually in
terned for the company following
his freshman year of high school.
Their first browser came to be
known as Phoenix. The duo pro
moted the browser to the Mozilla
Foundation and began working on
fixing the bugs, asking a group of
volunteers around the world to
help develop the software.
Phoenix developed into another

version, which they deemed Fire
bird, which developed into the
final version, the now-famous
Mozilla Tirefox.
Unlike companies such as Mi
crosoft, which keep their informa
tion closely guarded, the Mountain
View, Calif.-based Mozilla Foun
dation encourages programmers
to nitpick through the software
and make improvements. Users

who locate bugs are highly encour
aged to report them.
Kevin Christopher, a senior
and resident computer consultant
for Alondra, said that he has been
using browsers other than Internet
Explorer fora lew years and dis
trusts Microsoft's products. He
prefers using open-source
software.
"The concern 1 share with a lot
of other people is a general lack of
confidence in Microsoft's code:
We don't really know what is well
written versus what is held togeth
er by duct tape." Christopher said
Prof. Mendel Rosenblum in the
Computer Science Department
said he thought that Mozilla pre
sented an interesting challenge for

Microsoft.
"Browser innovation at Mi
crosoft proceeded very rapidly up to
the point they sufficiently crushed
Netscape, and then it totally
stopped," Rosenblum said. "Having
a good open-source browser that ap
pears to be evolving very quickly ex
poses Microsoft to the risk that
Mozilla will get good enough to start
luring folks to it."

If anything. Ross just wants to
see a better browser available for
the general public. He noted the
dissatisfaction with Internet Ex
plorer among his colleagues and
peers and said he believed Internet
browsing could be faster and more
efficient.
"Before Firefox, [Microsoft's)
Internet Explorer team had basi
cally disbanded," Ross explained.
" They weren't really making any
improvements on the browser be
cause they already dominated the
market. These days, we've heard
that they have about 100 people
working on the team and have
started to market Internet Explor
er — something they didn't do be
fore."

So why are people making the
switch?
Mozilla Firefox has a few fea
tures that may drag users away
from Internet Explorer. It is a fair
ly small file that downloads and in
stalls quickly and is easy to use.
During installation, users have an
option to import preferences,
stored passwords, bookmarks and
cookies from past versions of

Mozilla. Netscape and Internet
Explorer, making the transition
seamless. The tab feature is useful
for keeping several Web sites open
without cluttering your computer
screen.
Perhaps one of the most com
pelling reasons to switch to Fire
iox v however, is security. Hackers
typically attack 'the marlceV'gi&nf
Internet Explorer, in the world
of Web browsing — leaving Fire
fox relatively safe and sound.
Andrew Vogel, a senior and
computer science major, has been
using alternatives to Internet Ex
plorer fora while and is strong sup
porter of Firefox.
,Außecently, there have been
security concerns over Internet

Explorer, and that has turned out
to reinforce my decision and
prompted me to encourage my res
idents to use alternative
browsers,,Aii said Vogel, who
works as an RCC at Durand.
Mozilla Firefox is not com
pletely immune to attacks, hut the
lact that it is not wholly integrated
into the Windows operating sys
tem makes it more difficult to get
into sensitive files or to corrupt
other Windows-integrated pro
grams.
"Microsoft has tried to con
vince users that they need or want
to have the browser coupled into
every Microsoft application and
vice versa, and tried to convince
the government and European
anti-trust people that the browser
needs to be strongly coupled into
the operating system," said Com
puter Science Prof. David Cheri
ton.
"However, in my opinion, ex
perience has shown that this busi
ness-driven rationale has led to
software that is too 'integrated' to
be secure against viruses — kind
of like having a heart attack every
time you have a headache," Cheri
ton added.
What's next for Ross and the
young Mozilla Firefox team?
Fame? Fortune?
It's looking that way.
At the age of 19. Ross is busy
planning a Palo Alto-based start
up with a small group of people,
developing Mozilla Firefox further
and working to partner with com
panies so he can customize his soft
ware to their needs and provide
tech support.
The Mozilla Firefox team may
also work on a desktop search
function, much like Google's prod
uct.
Meanwhile, Ross will be busy
promoting his creation all over the
world. He plans on advertising
through posters, logo merchan
dise, thefacebook.com and other
college sites.
As much as he enjoys the fame
and success of his software. Ross is
'looKingroenjoy the rest* of his time
at Stanford.
"I'm planning on working real
ly, really hard for six months, get
ting this start-up off the ground
and when we hit it big, I can live a
normal college life," Ross said.
"You know, leave my room, see
people. That would be good."
