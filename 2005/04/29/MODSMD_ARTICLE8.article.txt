## 
### TOLU OLORUNNIPA 
More than 275 children between
the ages of 10 and 15 visited the
Stanford campus yesterday for the
annual Take Your Daughters and
Sons to Work Day. The program,
themed "Power in Possibilities,"
was administered by the Work Life
Office.
Students and their parents began
the day by attending a panel discus
sion with University Provost John
Etchemendy and Senior Assistant to
the University President Jeff Wach-

Tel, both who have children of their
own attending Stanford.
"It was fun for them to see par
ent-daughter and parent-son teams
who are all on the same campus and
hear their stories," said Program Co
ordinator Carol Skladany of the
Work Life Office.
After the opening activities,
which included performances by the
Stanford Improvisers and a
slideshow, the kids went to various
workshops.

Rebecca Brown tells her mom, Suzanne Chiessler, about her on-campus ac
tivities during Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Day.
Brandon Ponciano, 14, and nine
other students participated in
"Lights, Camera, Action!" a work
shop on filmmaking. The group
took on roles as actors, directors
and camera operators and pro
duced short skits about peer pres
sure, nutrition and drugs. They
teamed up with video technicians
from Stanford Video to create a
short film complete with stage
lights, a professional video camera
and plenty of action.
"I think it went pretty well," said
Ponciano, son of Patty Ponciano, a
sales manager for the travel study pro
gram. "It's cool learning about what
people are doing here." He looked
down at the floor and smiled before
adding, "Missing school is fun, too."
Teresa Rasco, director of the
Work Life Office, said that the goals
of the workshops were to enable stu
dents to directly participate in activ
ities that interest them and to give
them the opportunity to play a role
in some of the things that go on at
Stanford during the day.
"We wanted the children to expe
rience more than just coming to a
place and hearing people talk," she
said. "So one of the key elements of
the program is the hands-on partici
pation."
The 16 students who participat
ed in "Busted," a criminal law
workshop, put on a mock trial at
the Stanford Law School. Rosa
Gonzalez, an attorney by trade and
resident fellow at Yost House,
acted as the judge and the students
played the roles of the prosecution
and defense teams and the jury in
the sentencing case of a teenage
drag-racer convicted of vehicular
manslaughter.
"My little children, they cry every
night," said 13-year-old Sam Wilder,
who played Ms. Elena, the mother
of the victim. "They can't sleep, they
don't eat," he added, almost at the
point of tears.
Although the defense won the
trial. Wilder said he enjoyed the ex
perience.
"I just liked the acting, it was
fun," he added.
The workshops focused on a wide
range of fields, including technolo
gy, athletics and biology.

"We did a bunch of science ex
periments, played with dry ice and lit
a balloon on fire," said Drew Edel
men, 10, who attended the Chem
istry Magic Show.
Stanford faculty members and
students volunteered to run many of
these workshops.
"[Volunteers] are excited and
willing to share with young people
because they love what they do,'
Rasco said, adding that the volun
teers enjoyed teaching students
about their areas of expertise just as
much as the students enjoyed learn
in S
"lt's a mutually lun experience,
she said. "Kids need to know that a
job is a way to make a living, but it's
also a way to challenge yourself, to
accomplish things and to feel good
about what you're doing."
Parents got parenting tips from
Deborah Stipek, the dean of the
School of Education. Her presenta
tion focused on how to motivate
children to love learning.
"She was outstanding," said Gin
ger Brudos, a neuropsychologist,
who attended the event. "It's nice to
work in such a family-friendly envi
ronment."
Students ended the day by rejoin
ing their parents to debrief on the
day's activities.
Alexis Willis. 10, who attended
"Let's Get Physical," a workshop
about exercise and physical therapy,
came back showing off a heavily
bandaged ankle.
"What happened here?" anx
iously asked her grandmother, Mar
garet Willis, a staff member in the
Pediatrics Department.
"It's a long story," replied Alexis,
trying to maintain a serious facade.
She finally burst out in laughter and
explained that she had volunteered
to have her leg taped as part of the
workshop.
Willis, relieved, said that she en
joyed bringing her granddaughter
to work and that she plans to par
ticipate in the program again next
year.
Rasco said that she was pleased
with the overall outcome.
"It was stressful, but when you
look back on it you're glad to have
had the experience," she said.
"We've been very fortunate that on
the whole people really enjoyed
themselves. And that's our goal. The
hard part is thinking, 'Okay, what
can we do next year to make sure it's
new and fresh?'"
