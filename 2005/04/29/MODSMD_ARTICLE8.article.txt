# Univ. celebrates Take Your Child to Work Day
## 
### TOLU OLORUNNIPA 
More than 275 children between
the ages of 10 and 15 visited the
Stanford campus yesterday for the
annual Take Your Daughters and
Sons to Work Day. The program,
themed "Power in Possibilities,"
was administered by the Work Life
Office.
Students and their parents began
the day by attending a panel discus
sion with University Provost John
Etchemendy and Senior Assistant to
the University President Jeff Wach-

Tel, both who have children of their
own attending Stanford.
"It was fun for them to see par
ent-daughter and parent-son teams
who are all on the same campus and
hear their stories," said Program Co
ordinator Carol Skladany of the
Work Life Office.
After the opening activities,
which included performances by the
Stanford Improvisers and a
slideshow, the kids went to various
workshops.
