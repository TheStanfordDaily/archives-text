# Exploring identity through virtual reality
## 
### SIMON SHUSTER NEWS EDITOR 
Have you ever wondered when
science would catch up with Star
Trek and finally let you travel to
different worlds or even assume a
new identity, all before you can
say, "Beam me up, Scottie"? Well,
Stanford's Virtual Human Interac
tion Lab, VHIL, may be one step
closer to realizing this sci-fi fanta
sy.
Founded and currently run by
Communication Prof. Jeremy
Bailenson, VHIL is transporting
volunteers into virtual worlds,
where they interact with one an
other under the guises of various
computer-generated personas,
known as avatars. By studying
these interactions, researchers are
trying to understand how virtual
reality environments can influence
ail kinds of social behaviors —
from stereotyping to confidence to
feeling empathy for others.
What makes this lab unique,
said Bailenson, is not only the
quality of the virtual simulation,
but also its commitment to social
science.
"We want to study what hap
pens when humans interact with
other virtual humans," he said.
"There are tons of [ideas for) con
sumer products people offer us
that we don't do. We're social sci
entists."
Yet even in the more restricted
realm of social science, the possi
ble applications of virtual reality
technology seem limitless.
"Anything you can fathom, we
can do," Bailenson said. "|Your
virtual representation] can look as
much or as little like you as you
want, and it can behave as much or
as little like you as you want."
To illustrate, Bailenson de
scribed an online virtual class
room, in which a student can ren
der his avatar as "paying attention,
mimicking the teacher, while actu
ally being in the other room smok
ing a cigarette."
While this may sound like
child's play, the virtual worlds that

have actually been realized at
VHIL may have influential social
applications.
"We're using [the simulations
as a way to desensitize people who
have social anxiety," Bailenson
said. For instance, someone fearful
of public speaking can be placed
before a virtual audience, which
can either heckle or encourage the
speaker. In this way, a common
phobia can be overcome with rela
tive ease.
Practically any fear can be
faced in a virtual reality settmg be
cause the simulated experience
mimics the real world so convinc
ingly. In some experiments, the vi
sual sensations have been almost
too convincing, causing the sub
jects to react as if they were truly in
danger. For instance, when sub
jects were asked to step into a vir
tual pit, according to Bailenson,
some subjects fell to the floor or
tried to grab on to the ledge, and
about one-third of the volunteers
refused to take the virtual leap al
together.
As with most groundbreaking
technologies, virtual reality can
also serve ill intentions.
"Of course there are ethical
questions," Bailenson said. "If
you're a politician and you're try
ing to petition a group of Latino
voters, you can make yourself look
Latino. If you're trying to petition
Caucasians, you can make yourself
look Caucasian."
Still, this kind of deception is
hardly a new phenomenon,
Bailenson added, likening it to
someone wearing make-up to ob
scure his appearance.
"People that lift weights change
their muscles. These things hap
pen all the time, it's just a lot easi
er to make these things effective
when you're in an online medi
um," he said.
Notions of personal identity
can also be obscured in the context
of virtual reality.
In designing an avatar, pho
tographs of an individual are
"wrapped around" a stock, a
three-dimensional model of a

human head, explained Nick Yee,
graduate student researcher at
VHIL. In addition to the pho
tographs, a person's characteristic
facial gestures are recorded and
applied to the 3-D model.
"[The resulting virtual person]
captures about 95 percent of a per
son's facial variance," said Bailen
son. referring to the accuracy of
the simulations.
"But what happens if I take
Nick's face, and then I throw your
[facial] gestures on it. Who is that
an avatar of? Is that Nick or you?"
Bailenson asked.
"It looks like Nick, but it's ges
turing like you. You get all these
hybrid identity questions that
arise." he added.
Nonetheless, Bailenson said
that virtual reality technology
promises to help us answer ques
tions about personal identity that

might be impossible to answer
using other methods.
On the project Web site, the
question is posed, "How much
does an avatar need to resemble
(both visually and behaviorallv) its
respective owner in order for per
son-specific influences to take ef
fect?"
VHIL experiments hope to an
swer this question by testing how
much a person's appearance can
change before others in the virtual
setting no longer react to him as
the same person.
One virtual world at VHIL
promises to make police lineups
more effective. Using virtual reali
ty. police departments may one
day be able to graph the pho
tographs and gestures of suspects
onto a group of avatars, instead of
making live suspects line up be
hind the t>lass.

That way, a witness can enter a
virtual world and inspect the sus
pect-avatars as closely as needed,
all while remaining completely
anonymous.
"It can also help us parse out
false alarms," Bailenson said.
Presumably, a witness would
not come too close to the avatar of
someone who had assaulted him.
By monitoring the behavior of the
witness in the virtual world, police
would be able to judge the truth
fulness of a witness's testimony.
Various experiments are also
testing the nature of empathy. The
VHIL Web site describes one
world "designed to demonstrate
what it is like to walk a mile in the
shoes of another."

realm of social science, the possi
ble applications of virtual reality
technology seem limitless.
"Anything you can fathom, we
can do," Bailenson said. "|Your
virtual representation] can look as
much or as little like you as you
want, and it can behave as much or
as little like you as you want."
To illustrate, Bailenson de
scribed an online virtual class
room, in which a student can ren
der his avatar as "paying attention,
mimicking the teacher, while actu
ally being in the other room smok
ing a cigarette."
While this may sound like
child's play, the virtual worlds that

have actually been realized at
VHIL may have influential social
applications.
"We're using [the simulations
as a way to desensitize people who
have social anxiety," Bailenson
said. For instance, someone fearful
of public speaking can be placed
before a virtual audience, which
can either heckle or encourage the
speaker. In this way, a common
phobia can be overcome with rela
tive ease.
Practically any fear can be
faced in a virtual reality settmg be
cause the simulated experience
mimics the real world so convinc
ingly. In some experiments, the vi
sual sensations have been almost
too convincing, causing the sub
jects to react as if they were truly in
danger. For instance, when sub
jects were asked to step into a vir
tual pit, according to Bailenson,
some subjects fell to the floor or
tried to grab on to the ledge, and
about one-third of the volunteers
refused to take the virtual leap al
together.
As with most groundbreaking
technologies, virtual reality can
also serve ill intentions.
"Of course there are ethical
questions," Bailenson said. "If
you're a politician and you're try
ing to petition a group of Latino
voters, you can make yourself look
Latino. If you're trying to petition
Caucasians, you can make yourself
look Caucasian."
Still, this kind of deception is
hardly a new phenomenon,
Bailenson added, likening it to
someone wearing make-up to ob
scure his appearance.
"People that lift weights change
their muscles. These things hap
pen all the time, it's just a lot easi
er to make these things effective
when you're in an online medi
um," he said.
Notions of personal identity
can also be obscured in the context
of virtual reality.
In designing an avatar, pho
tographs of an individual are
"wrapped around" a stock, a
three-dimensional model of a

human head, explained Nick Yee,
graduate student researcher at
VHIL. In addition to the pho
tographs, a person's characteristic
facial gestures are recorded and
applied to the 3-D model.
"[The resulting virtual person]
captures about 95 percent of a per
son's facial variance," said Bailen
son. referring to the accuracy of
the simulations.
"But what happens if I take
Nick's face, and then I throw your
[facial] gestures on it. Who is that
an avatar of? Is that Nick or you?"
Bailenson asked.
"It looks like Nick, but it's ges
turing like you. You get all these
hybrid identity questions that
arise." he added.
Nonetheless, Bailenson said
that virtual reality technology
promises to help us answer ques
tions about personal identity that

might be impossible to answer
using other methods.
On the project Web site, the
question is posed, "How much
does an avatar need to resemble
(both visually and behaviorallv) its
respective owner in order for per
son-specific influences to take ef
fect?"
VHIL experiments hope to an
swer this question by testing how
much a person's appearance can
change before others in the virtual
setting no longer react to him as
the same person.
One virtual world at VHIL
promises to make police lineups
more effective. Using virtual reali
ty. police departments may one
day be able to graph the pho
tographs and gestures of suspects
onto a group of avatars, instead of
making live suspects line up be
hind the t>lass.

That way, a witness can enter a
virtual world and inspect the sus
pect-avatars as closely as needed,
all while remaining completely
anonymous.
"It can also help us parse out
false alarms," Bailenson said.
Presumably, a witness would
not come too close to the avatar of
someone who had assaulted him.
By monitoring the behavior of the
witness in the virtual world, police
would be able to judge the truth
fulness of a witness's testimony.
Various experiments are also
testing the nature of empathy. The
VHIL Web site describes one
world "designed to demonstrate
what it is like to walk a mile in the
shoes of another."
