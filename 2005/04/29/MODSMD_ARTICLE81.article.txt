# Diamond deems election in Iraq a tentative success
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The election in Iraq is over, and by now
most Stanford students have heard about the
unexpectedly high voter turnout and seen the
photos of Iraqis proudly showing their ink
stained fingers. But might domestic reactions
to the election fall in line with personal views
on the wisdom of U.S. policy in Iraq?
Not likely, says Political Science Prof. Larry
Diamond.
"I don't care whether you were for the war
or against the war, whether you thought it was
a good idea to hold elections or whether you
didn't, you just can't be ambivalent about what:
happened Sunday."
Diamond, also a senior fellow at the Hoove r
Institution, spoke about the election at Tresid
der last night. He served as a senior advisor to
the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq
from January to April of last year and has writ
ten a book about his experiences that will be
released in June.
The talk was organized by the Society for
International Affairs at Stanford. Official
results of voting will not be released lor anoth
er two weeks, and Diamond speculated that it
would be at least two to three days before any
one had "the faintest idea" of the victors.
Nonetheless, he said that "no matter what hap
pens," the election will be regarded as an im

portant historical moment in the histories of
Iraq and the Middle East. Diamond called
the images of Iraqis casting ballots for the first
time in over fifty years "deeply moving" and a
"real beginning" in the struggle for democracy
in Iraq, but he also had serious misgivings
about the security of the country.
"1 believe that the insurgency is going to ex
plode again pretty ferociously, pretty soon," he
said.
In the most emotional section of his talk.
Diamond raised his voice and pounded on the
podium with his fist as he warned that Iraq
would face more prolonged violence unless
President George W. Bush gives up on plans
for permanent military bases in Iraq.
"This, to my mind, is really, really dumb," Dia
mond said about the construction of military
bases, which he believes is already in progress.
Sunday's election will decide the make-up
of the 275 member transitional assembly that
will be charged with creating a permanent Iraqi
constitution. Diamond guessed that that the
assembly will meet in Baghdad for the first
time by the end of this month.
A few Stanford students with Iraqi parents
were eligible to vote. Polling places were set up
in five U.S. cities, with Los Angeles being the
closest site to Stanford.
