# Computer glitch reassigns 150 post office boxes

### GERRY SHIH STAFF WRITER 
Leaning against the counter, sophomore Preeya
Jayakar impatiently listened to a Stanford post office
employee while twiddling quarters with her fingers.
She had waited 25 minutes in line, only to he told now
that her P.O. Box had been reassigned lor the second
time in two weeks. She needed yet another new key,
and that would be found in Old Union.
With a scowl on her face, Jayakar stomped out of a
packed post office that reeked of frustration.
She wasn't the only one with a P.O. Box problem,
and she wasn't the only one frustrated.
According to University Registrar Roger Printup,
about 900 returning students were affected by a glitch
in the University computer system over the summer.
The bug prevented students from renewing their old
P.O. Boxes at the end of last year. To compound the
problem, a separate computer problem assigned many
returning students to different boxes and assigned
their old, supposedly unrenewed and empty boxes to
incoming freshmen. As a result, about 150 returning
students have now had their boxes permanently reas
signed. causing headaches for those affected.
"We've been trying to get the mailboxes of return
ing students back to them." said Eduardo Morales,
manager of the P.O. Box rental office. "Incoming
freshmen will have their boxes taken away, hut we un
derstand how important it is for students who have
been here for three or four years to keep their boxes,
and we're doing everything we can."
Despite a postal regulation that prohibits reassign
ments of P.O. Boxes, the post office allowed 750 of
the 900 students originally affected to reclaim their
old boxes, according to Printup. But on Sept. 28. the
post office decided to halt the reassignment of mail
boxes.
That left 150 students stuck with a new mailing ad
dress. To complicate the issue, many students have
not been able to retrieve their mail for weeks, as the
post office is holding some mail iri the midst of the
chaos.
Many of the 750 students — the lucky majority — af-
fected by the mix-up. like junior Al
lison McCarty, were only minimally
inconvenienced.
"They changed my lock, so I
went down to Old Union and just
exchanged my key," said McCarty.
"They let me keep the same P.O.
Box, so really it was about as much
trouble for them as it was for me."
Other students weren't as fortu
nate. Senior Wenfei Xie is one of
the 150 who now has to deal with a
permanent address change, and
for her it will take more than an
extra walk to Old Union to
straighten things out.
Addressing information for
credit card billings, magazine sub
scriptions, tuition checks and more
will all have to be changed, Xie
said. Plus, she has not received
some expected time-sensitive mail
for two weeks.
According to Printup, his office is
working to prevent future mix-ups.
"Everyone here at the Regis
trar's Office is dreadfully sorry,
and obviously we wish this had not
happened," Printup said. "But as
for the future, we will look at the
computer program like it's never
been looked at before and test it
like it's never been tested before."
