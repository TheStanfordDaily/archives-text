## Kramer takes office as new dean of Law School 
### MEGAN WATKINS DESK EDITOR 
Alumni and members of the Law School
community gathered in the Main Quad on
Friday evening to formally install Larry
Kramer as the 12th dean of the Law School.
Kramer, the former assistant law dean of
New York University, replaces Kathleen
Sullivan for the post.
In his speech, Kramer named the Law
School's small size and the large number of
loyal alumni as the strengths of the school.
However, he pointed to several areas of im
provement that he intends to focus on, includ
ing fostering stronger academic ties between
the Law School and the University at large.
Kramer said that many students now
choose to go after two degrees, one in law
and one in some other specialty, and he de
scribed the challenge of catering to changing
student needs.
"Students want to know that when they
get to law school they will have choices," he
said.
He explained that law is becoming more
specialized and that many students do not go
on to practice law.
"The education we are offering remains
partial and incomplete," Kramer said.
Kramer also suggested that the Law
School could better capitalize on the oppor
tunities that its small size affords.
"We need to make better use of the time
we get with students," he said.
With this challenge in mind, Kramer stat
ed the importance of preserving the small
community of the Law School. He proposed
that instead of trying to accomplish meeting

the full breadth of these goals on its own, the
Law School should seek to leverage the
strength of the larger university.
Having discussed the challenges to be
laced within the University, Kramer moved
on to address those that the world will face in
the coming years.
He noted that his generation has created
many problems relating to the environment,
peace and disease, among other issues. He
called for the community to set aside its cyn
icism and take active responsibility.
"Business as usual will not get the job
done," he stated.
Friday's celebration began with dinner
and music, followed by remarks from Uni
versity President John Hennessy, Kramer
and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen
Breyer, who received his undergraduate de
gree from Stanford in 1959.
Duane C. Quanini, Class of 1970, chair
man of Sonnenschein, Nath and Rosenthal
LLP and chair of the Stanford Law School
Board of Visitors, started the evening's
speeches by introducing Hennessy.
Hennessy spoke of the time and effort re
quired for the dean search and celebrated its
results.
"What's next for our great Law School
and University?" he asked.
He challenged attendees to rethink the
role of the Law School while remaining in
spired by its past achievements. He de
scribed challenges to be addressed in the
field, including, but not limited to, environ
mental law and biomedical law.
