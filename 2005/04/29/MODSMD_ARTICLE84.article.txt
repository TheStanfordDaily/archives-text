# Marching Band points the finger across the Bay
## Tree costume stolen 
### ALIYYA HAQUE DESK EDITOR 
In a heist more fitting for pre-Big
Game day than fora chilly January
Monday, thieves allegedly broke into
the Tree Room of the Band Shak last
week and stole the Band mascot's cos
tume, valued at over $2,500.
The incident was reported to the
Stanford Police Department.
"I took a report fora burglary at the
Band Shak fora costume on Jan. 18,"
said Deputy Vincent Larson. Larson
declined to comment on the method of
entry because of the ongoing investiga
tion. The detective in charge of the in
vestigation could not be reached by
press time.
The burglars have not been identi
fied, nor have they contacted senior
Isaac Salier-Hellendag, the student
who dons the outfit at sporting events
for the Band as the Tree. But circum
stances surrounding the crime lead
many Band members to suspect stu
dents from UC-Berkeley to be the per
petrators.
"Well, obviously the villains behind
the crime have an abundance of time
on their hands, a hatred of children and
all things fun, and a heart three sizes
too small," junior Chris Holt, the
Band's public relations director and a
columnist for The Daily. "Since Andy
Dick wasn't in town, we're guessing it
was the Weenies. The Tree is not just
the mascot of the Stanford Band, a
symbol of the University, and a gen
uinely cool thing to look at, but also a
children's icon that is adored by mil
lions."
The fact that the Tree's costume was
stolen does not come as a surprise to
some, since just last year the costume
was swiped twice, first during a Pier 39
Band rally during Big Game week and

again during winter break when the
University was officially closed.
In fact, the Tree's costume has been
a target for years. In the early 19905, the
Tree was stolen, only to be recovered
and ceremoniously destroyed by the
Band.
Many students also remember last
year's Big Game halftime festivities,
when the recovered Tree costume was
destroyed via a wood chipper. The Tree
sported a different costume during that
game and later built a new one.
There also have been several at
tempts to steal the costume during
2005, none of which were successful.
"During Big Game week, Band
members were in and around the
Shak around the clock, at one point
preventing a group from Cal from
stealing the costume," Salier-Hel
lendag said. "Over winter break,
there were still more attempts. I had
decided to keep my costume in my
room at Slavianski Dom during the
holiday, so again, the thieves were
unsuccessful."
It is the timing and circumstances of
this theft, however, that have left Band
members reeling.
"Unfortunately, mid-January was
not a time any of us really expected as
a reasonable period fora break-in, so
security around the costume was rela
tively low," Salier-Hellendag said.
"Last winter break, [former Tree]
Will Rothacker's costume was stolen
from the <&me room, and the thieves
actually cut the entire lock from the
door to break in. We rely on the Uni
versity and the Athletic Department
to repair these things, and over the
past year, the lock was never re
placed."
