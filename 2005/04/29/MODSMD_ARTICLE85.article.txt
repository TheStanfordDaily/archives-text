# Former reqs still apply to upperclassmen
## Faculty Senate changes GERs 
### KATIE BEARMAN DESK EDITOR 
Beginning next year, Stanford
students will be required to take
one less course to graduate, ac
cording to an announcement at
yesterday afternoon's Faculty
Senate meeting.
After fierce debates, the Senate
approved a proposal by the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Stan
dards and Policy to significantly
alter the General Education Re
quirements, popularly known as
GERs. The Senate mandated that
the changes to the core curriculum
will go into effect at the beginning
of the next academic year and will
apply to current students and in
coming freshmen.
Current students, however,
will still have the option of using
the old system to accumulate
GERs. As usual, they will be able
to choose between any set of
GER guidelines that have been in
effect since they matriculated.
Under the new policy. Area 2-
newly entitled Disciplinary
Breadth-will be a combination of
current Areas 2 and 3. "Discipli
nary Breadth" will be composed
of the following sub-categories:
engineering and applied sciences,
humanities, mathematics, natural
sciences and social sciences. Stu
dents will have to take one course
in each sub-category.
What is now known as Area 4
will be called Area 3: Education
for Citizenship. Current Area 4
sub-categories World Cultures,
American Cultures and Gender
Studies will be maintained, and
sub-category Ethical Reasoning

will be added. A minimum of two
courses in Area 4 will be required,
and the courses must be in two
separate sub-categories.
Notably, the title of sub-cate
gory World Cultures will change
to The Global Community as re
quested by the Department of
Cultural and Social Anthropolo
gy. CASA faculty members be
lieve that the previous name was
constraining and perpetuated a
dichotomous understanding of
"the West" and"the Other."
Various Stanford professors
are enthusiastic about the addi
tion of the Ethical Reasoning sub
category, claiming that it fills a
problematic gap in the current
Area 4 requirement.
"This new sub-area is intend
ed to help make students aware
of how pervasive ethical reason
ing and value judgments are
throughout the curriculum,"
said Philosophy Prof. Chris
Bobonich. "We wanted to pitch
the old requirements in a broad
er context so that students could
see why they're required and
also to add something to Area 4
that was missing."
Ethical Reasoning was not
added to the policy without oppo
sition. English Prof. Paula Moya
was concerned, for instance, that
the presence of the new sub-cate
gory could take away from stu
dents' understanding of the inter
action between people of differ
ent race, ethnicity and gender be
cause of the often abstract and
theoretical nature of ethics.
