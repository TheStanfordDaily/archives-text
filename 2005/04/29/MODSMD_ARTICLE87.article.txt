# Students protest Bush inauguration
## 
### BEA SANFORD CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While President George W. Bush
praised freedom and democracy at
his second inauguration in Washing
ton D.C., some Stanford students
were exercising their own freedom
in demonstrating against him.
At 11:40 a.m., about 30 students
walked out of their classes, con
vened at the History Corner and
marched to White Plaza fora rally
called "Stand Up For Change."
The focal point of the rally was a
10-minute speech by Larry Everest,
author of "Oil, Power & Empire:
Iraq & the U.S. Global Agenda."
"Today, moments after Bush was
inaugurated, he declared war on us,"
Everest said.
Everest described Bush's $40 mil
lion inauguration as "a coronation of
war, greed and intolerance."
Some passersby felt Everest's
rhetoric was too strong.
"He's sort of on the extreme,"
said senior Jessica Park. "That's
kind of alienating."
History of Modern Philosophy
Prof. Allen Wood also spoke at the
rally, with a note of disillusionment,
on perceived election failures.
"We know they stole the election
in 2000 in Florida, and whether or
not they stole this election in Ohio
they don't want us to know."
Wood acknowledged that "Stand
Up for Change" - and similar rallies
across the country — would be over
shadowed by the inauguration.

He quoted former President
Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Ad
dress in saying, "The world will little
note nor long remember what we say
here."
On the grassy spot near The
Claw, a group called the Neo Con
Artists drew attention to possible
vote fraud in the 2004 presidential
election.
One of the "artists," donning a
royal costume and face mask of
Bush, offered bystanders a chance to
"have their picture taken with King
George." The group's chart of po
tential poses included one called
"regicide," which depicted someone
slaying a king.
At the rally, a "New Term Reso
lutions" table invited people to voice
their plans for political action. One
person wrote, "1 will fight to support
recognition of the difference be
tween charity and justice." Another
simply scrawled, "Damn the Man."
Sophomore and Stanford Demo
crat Paco Torres, who helped orga
nize the event, said he was happy
with the turnout.
Many of the 30 students who par
ticipated in the walk-out wore or
ange bands on their arms or duct
tape over their mouths.
"The orange bands signify soli
darity to not be afraid, to wear it on
your sleeve quite literally," said ju
nior Francisco Cendejas, a partici
pant in the march.
