# Popular econ lecturer leaves for Wellesley
## 
### SARAH RIZK STAFF WRITER 
Economics Lecturer David Johnson, who is
praised by students for his lively lecturing style, is
teaching his last quarter at Stanford before depart
ing to Wellesley College. His wife, Anne Pringle,
has accepted an assistant professorship in Har
vard's Department of Organismic and Evolution
ary Biology.
"We knew all along that our time in California
would probably be limited to my wife's three-year
post-doctoral fellowship at UC Berkeley," said
Johnson, who announced his decision to leave last
summer. "Had Stanford been seeking junior facul
ty in my wife's field, we most certainly would have
considered staying."
Students who have taken Johnson's classes are
overwhelmingly enthusiastic about the instructor,
noting his energized teaching style and his tenden
cy to tie concepts to current events.

"He's the best professor I've had at Stanford,"
said sophomore Stayan Gajwani, who is currently
taking his third class from Johnson. "He's very
good at explaining concepts and saying why they
apply to the real world. He spends the first 10 to 15
minutes of class talking about something that's
going on in the world and explaining why and how
it's relevant."
Other students touched on his unique lecturing
style.
"He brings a certain intensity to class that
makes you want to pay attention and work hard,"
said junior Adam Eichner who chose to take "De
velopment Economics" this quarter specifically
because Johnson is the teacher.
Johnson said he strives to make his courses "in
teresting, important and relevant," and said he rec
ognizes the liveliness of lectures.
"I suppose I'm a bit animated in lecture," John
son said. "But how can one not be excited about so
cial security reform or tradable pollution per

mits?"
As Johnson's time at Stanford comes to a close,
his students say they are disappointed not to he
able to take more classes from him in the future.
"People for the most part are sad to see him go
because he's a really good lecturer," said junior
Ben Backes. "I think people wish he would be
around more so they could take more classes from
him. Also, there's less incentive to get to know him
now since he won't be here next year, which is too
bad."
Johnson said he will miss both the students and
staff at Stanford in addition to "the endless office
hour discussions with students about matters both
sublime and ridiculous" and"the kind e-mails, let
ters, comments and evaluations from the students
concerning the extent of my teaching's impact on
their lives."
