# Calif. votes on stem cell research
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As Stanford voters go to the polls
today, they will face a controversial
California proposition that could
bring the University tens or even hun
dreds of millions of research dollars
annually.
If passed. Proposition 71 — which has
the support of numerous Stanford faculty
members — would fund $3 billion of
stem-cell research over the next 10 years.
Supporters say this research could

lead to cures for diabetes, heart disease
and Parkinson's. Critics, on the other
hand, charge that Prop. 71 is an unaf
fordahle gamble for unknown returns.
"I believe that the passage of Prop. 71
will reshape the national debate on stem
cell research," said Dr. Philip Pizzo.dean
of Stanford's Sch(x)l of Medicine.
"1 have been a strong advocate for
stem-cell research, because I believe
this will yield fundamental knowl
edge that will enhance our under
standing of developmental biology
and eventually a number of disease

processes," Pizzo said.
He is not alone in supporting the
proposition. Biochemistry Emeritus
Prof. Paul Berg and Dr. Irving Weiss
man of the Medical School are mem
bers of the campaign's scientific advi
sory board. Dr. Judith Shizuru. also of
the Medical School, is on Prop. 71 's
executive committee.
"The Bush administration has
blocked a promising line of research
because of its own ethical ideology,
not because this line of research is
dangerous or likely not to work,"
Weissman said. "It is critical for bio
medical researchers like me to point
out what would be lost, which I did for
time and time again, to no avail."
Weissman is also the director of
Stanford's Institute for Cancer / Stem
Cell Biology and Medicine, which was
founded in December 2002 with a $12
million private grant.
While the University has not taken
an official stance on the ballot mea
sure. the administration released a
statement last August noting, "Cur
rent federal policy has significantly
limited the availability of funding to
enable this research to reach its full
potential. Stanford University strong
ly supports stem-cell research and be
lieves that it merits public funding."
