# Teevens out, Harris in as head coach
## 
### MARK THOMA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After making the difficult but
necessary decision to fire Buddy
Teevens on Nov. 29, Stanford Ath
letics Director Dr. Ted Leland knew
exactly what he wanted in the Cardi
nal's next head football coach â€” ex
perience.
Enter Walt Harris, who was hired
Dec. 13 and officially began his
tenure at Stanford yesterday.
"Other tlian Bill Walsh, Walt is
the most experienced and successful
head football coach that Stanford
has hired since Pop Warner in 1924,"
Leland said. "He has done a fantas
tic job at the University of Pitts
burgh for the past eight years, turn
ing their program into one of the na
tion's perennial bowl contenders.
He is a man of high integrity and
character, and we welcome him into
the Stanford community."
Harris, 58, is a South San Francis
co native who, in his eight seasons
with Pittsburgh, took the No. 19
Panthers to a Bowl Championship
Series game this year. He grew up in
the shadow of Stanford's unique
football program, and the bespecta
cled man with a creative mind has
shown throughout his career that he
can recruit talented players under
circumstances that are somewhat
less than ideal. He has a 63-67 life
time record, including a 39-23 mark
over his past six seasons, and he says
he's ready for the unique challenge
that Stanford offers.
"It's a huge responsibility to be
the head football coach at such a

tremendous academic institution,"
Harris said. "Our job as coaches is to
do the whole thing. It's not just about
athletics and winning championships,
but molding the whole student-ath
lete. "There's not one person I
talked to that can't sing the praises of
this university, and I'm honored to be
a part of that. I couldn't be more
thrilled to represent Stanford Uni
versity like so many great coaches
have in the past."
Harris comes with his own band
of praise-singers, including Jon Gru
den, who has won a Super Bowl as
coach of the NFL's Tampa Bay Buc
caneers and got his start when Harris
hired him as a graduate assistant at
Tennessee.
"I consider Walt Harris as good a
coach as there is in America," Gru
den said. "His track record with quar
terbacks, receivers and offensive
football teams is unprecedented, and
his winning percentage at Pitt speaks
for itself. Walt is a class act and Stan
ford should be proud to have him."
Harris, who is under contract for
the next five years, inherits a work
able if not wonderful situation. Stan
ford went just 10-23 over the past
three seasons, but the players
worked hard under Teevens, a
strong recruiter who left behind a
talented roster. Nonetheless, Harris
isn't going to take it easy this winter.
"Don't be a college coach if you
don't like to recruit," Harris said. "To
me, recruiting is what it's all about. A
coach is a teacher, and I take pride in
the teaching aspects of the job. I look
