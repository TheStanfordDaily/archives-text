# Frosh Wiggins named All-American
## 
### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's season may have come to an
end on Tuesday with its loss to Michigan
State in the Kansas City Regional Final,
but for one Cardinal player, the accolades
keep on coming. Saturday, freshman Can
dice Wiggins was one of 10 players in the
country named to the Kodak All-America
Team by the Women's Basketball Coaches
Association.
For Wiggins, who greets success with
the "aw, shucks" grin of a kid on the play
ground, the on-court accomplishments
seem to include every statistical category.
She led her team in scoring with 17.4 points
per game, while her 86 steals tied Stanford
great Kate Starbird for third-most in
school history. Wiggins' 612 points this sea
son make her the fifth-highest single-sea
son scorer in Cardinal history. From the
charity stripe, her 162 successful free
throws are a new Stanford record, surpass
ing Nicole Powell's old mark of 161.
When Wiggins arrived on the Farm in
the fall, she was young enough — at age 17
— to be a high school senior. Instead, head
coach Tara VanDerveer told her that she
would be treated as a college senior, not a
rookie. Eight months later, those words
seem prophetic, as Wiggins has collected
post-season hardware like a player in her
sixth year on campus.
"[Her impact) was pretty much instan
taneous," senior Susan King Borchardt
said after Stanford's 76-59 victory over
Connecticut in the NCAA Tournament.

Stanford's Candice Wiggins became just tfie ninth player to be named
an All-American as a freshman in women's basketball history.
"She's a really special freshman. She
just wants to win so badly, and she fit
in great right from the start."
Wiggins is just the ninth woman
in NCAA history to garner an All-
America selection as a freshman,
joining ranks with USC legend
Cheryl Miller and WNBA star
Chamique Holdsclaw.
She swept the Pacific-10 Confer
ence awards ceremony earlier this

year, taking home both Pac-l() Fresh
man ofthe Year and Player of the Year
honors, the first time a Pac-10 player
has won both awards in the same year.
"1 thought she would do really
well physically," VanDerveer said.
"The things that you never know
about are the intangible things in
terms of her maturity, her intensity.
What I didn't understand or know
when we were recruiting her were
the intangibles, and that is what sep
arates her from other players."
