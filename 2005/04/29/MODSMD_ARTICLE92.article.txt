# Frosh Wiggins named All-American

### ZACH JONES SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's season may have come to an
end on Tuesday with its loss to Michigan
State in the Kansas City Regional Final,
but for one Cardinal player, the accolades
keep on coming. Saturday, freshman Can
dice Wiggins was one of 10 players in the
country named to the Kodak All-America
Team by the Women's Basketball Coaches
Association.
For Wiggins, who greets success with
the "aw, shucks" grin of a kid on the play
ground, the on-court accomplishments
seem to include every statistical category.
She led her team in scoring with 17.4 points
per game, while her 86 steals tied Stanford
great Kate Starbird for third-most in
school history. Wiggins' 612 points this sea
son make her the fifth-highest single-sea
son scorer in Cardinal history. From the
charity stripe, her 162 successful free
throws are a new Stanford record, surpass
ing Nicole Powell's old mark of 161.
When Wiggins arrived on the Farm in
the fall, she was young enough — at age 17
— to be a high school senior. Instead, head
coach Tara VanDerveer told her that she
would be treated as a college senior, not a
rookie. Eight months later, those words
seem prophetic, as Wiggins has collected
post-season hardware like a player in her
sixth year on campus.
"[Her impact) was pretty much instan
taneous," senior Susan King Borchardt
said after Stanford's 76-59 victory over
Connecticut in the NCAA Tournament.
